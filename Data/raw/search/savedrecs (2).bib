Abstract = {Foliage (leaves, small-diameter stems and flowers and fruits if present)
   was harvested in March 1993 from Acacia angustissima, Cajanus cajan,
   Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala and given as a
   supplement at four levels (0, 50, 100 and 150 g dry matter/day) to a
   diet of maize stover fed ad libitum to sheep. Sixteen sheep were used
   and divided into four groups of four, each with a mean weight of 18 kg.
   Each group was allocated at random to one of the legumes. Four 4 x 4
   Latin square design experiments were carried out using 14-day periods
   and during the second week of each period feed intake, digestibility,
   nitrogen balance and microbial protein yield were measured. For each
   legume, other than C. calothyrsus, there was a significant increase (P <
   0.05) in dry matter intake as the level of supplement increased. For all
   four legumes, there was a significant increase (P < 0.05) in
   digestibility of organic matter, nitrogen balance (NB) and microbial
   protein yield as the level of supplement increased. As judged by
   increases in intake of digestible organic matter and NB, A. angustissima
   gave the best response, followed by C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala
   which were similar and then C. cajan gave the poorest response. (C) 1997

Journal = {INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {67},
Number = {6},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Fifteen Jamunapari male goats, weighing 22.0 kg were divided into 3
   groups of 5 animals each. The animals were offered rations containing
   leaves and twigs of leucaena leucocephala to provide 0, 25 and 50\% of
   CP of total rations in L-1, L-2 and L-3 groups. Three animals from each
   group were sacrificed after a feeding for 330 days for pathological
   examination of vital organs. Incorporation of leucaena in L-3 group
   resulted in significant(P<0.05) increase in DM consumption. Except EE,
   the digestibility of DM, OM, CP, ADF, NDF and cellulose was similar on
   different treatments. Incorporation of leucaena leaves in diets resulted
   in reduction of EE digestibility which was 62.7, 56.3 and 42.1 in L-1,
   L-2 and L-3, groups respectively. The average daily live-weight gain was
   39+/-2.3, 48+/-4.5 and 45+/-3.9g per head in L-1, L-2 and L-3 groups
   with no significant differences (P<0.05). Histopathological examination
   of vital organs did not reveal any significant change due to leucaena
   feeding, excepting in thyroid glands and kidneys. The thyroid glands of
   L-2 and L-3 revealed mild variation in size of follicles with normal or
   pale staining colloids. Kidneys revealed intense engorgement of
   interstitial blood vessels with extravasation of red blood corpuscles.
   It is concluded that leucaena may be providing up to 50\% CP of the
   ration for goats up to 330 days and it does not cause any serious
   disorder in vital organs.},

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Following the control of an invasive tree species, native forest
   ecosystem restoration can be prevented by a secondary invasion by
   another invasive species that inhibits the reestablishment of native
   trees. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the invasive shrub
   Leucaena leucocephala on the initial growth of planted seedlings of four
   native tree species (Pandanus boninensis, Rhaphiolepis indica, Schima
   mertensiana, and Terminalia catappa) after eradication of the invasive
   tree Casuarina equisetifolia in the Ogasawara Islands in the
   northwestern Pacific Ocean. In a 24-month field experiment, we compared
   the sizes of planted seedlings (diameter at ground level, height, and
   leaf number) among four treatments in a 2 x 2 design of initial seedling
   size (large vs. small) x L. leucocephala invasion (sowing L.
   leucocephala seeds vs. control). More than 75\% of the seedlings
   (excluding S. mertensiana) survived regardless of the treatments. For
   all four species, initially large seedlings tended to become larger
   plants at the end of the experiment than initially small seedlings. We
   detected significant effects of L. leucocephala invasion on one or more
   plant size parameters in all four species. Seedlings grown in L.
   leucocephala invasion quadrats were smaller than those in control
   quadrats at the end of the experiment. We detected significant
   interactions between initial seedling sizes and L. leucocephala invasion
   for three species. Together, these results indicate that secondary
   invasion by L. leucocephala after controlling C. equisetifolia inhibits
   the initial growth of native tree seedlings, depending on their size at
   the time of invasion.},

Title = {Translocation and Metabolism of Injected Glyphosate in Lead Tree

Journal = {WEED SCIENCE},

Volume = {57},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {In order to clarify the translocation and metabolism of glyphosate in
   lead tree, a mixture of glyphosate (0.5 mmol) and 14 C-glyphosate was
   injected into mini tree plants (1.5-cm trunk diameter and 120 cm tall),
   simulating a grown lead tree in a greenhouse experiment. Within 6 d
   after treatment (DAT), all leaves on the lead tree plants dropped.
   Analysis of nonlabeled glyphosate in both xylem and phloem every 15 d
   showed that glyphosate residues accumulated mainly in phloem, similar to
   the findings in established lead tree. In this experiment, glyphosate
   concentration in the phloem of three parts of the trunk, i.e., upper (15
   cm above the upper injection hole), middle (between the two injection
   holes), and lower (15 cm below the lower injection hole) parts,
   increased rapidly within 45 DAT, and decreased thereafter. Obviously,
   significant glyphosate metabolism occurred during the latter period.
   Further 14 C radioactivity measurement also exhibited similar
   time-course changes of glyphosate dissipation, except that a low level
   of radioactivity in the phloem of the upper part and a high level of
   radioactivity in the lower part were detected from 45 to 90 DAT,
   suggesting that more glyphosate metabolites in the phloem of the upper
   part might have translocated with photosynthetic assimilates and
   reallocated to the lower part of the mini tree. Thin-layer
   chromatography (TLC) analysis of metabolites derived from
   C-14-glyphosate also revealed that about 70\% of the radioactivity
   recovered in the phloem of the lower part comprised the unknown
   metabolites M1 (retention factor {[}Rf] : 0.83) and M2 (Rf: 0.94), with
   nearly 28\% of the radioactivity from sarcosine (Rf: 0.76), and less
   than 2\% of the radioactivity from aminomethylphosphoric acid (AMPA)
   (Rf: 0.49) and glyphosate (Pf: 0.36). It is concluded that active
   metabolism of glyphosate in this 90-d simulation experiment occurred
   mainly from 45 to 90 DAT, and the primary metabolism was modulated by
   C-P lyase.},

   driven by active transport when the Ni concentration in the solution is
   low; higher amounts (2 ppm) would inhibit this transfer or increase

   generally decreases Ni absorption. The depressive effect of cations is
   more pronounced as their capacity to be adsorbed or complexed is
   greater. This effect decreases with the mobility of the anion.},

Abstract = {Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 that nodulates Leucaena leucocephala
   degrades mimosine, a toxin produced by this tree legume. A cosmid clone,
   pUHR263, containing similar to 25 kb cloned DNA was isolated by plating
   Escherichia coli cells containing the cosmid clone library of TAL1145 on
   a minimal medium in which 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (HP), a degradation
   product of mimosine, was used as the source of nitrogen. Cosmid pUHR263
   was mutagenized by random insertions of Tn3Hogus, a transposon that
   makes transcriptional gus fusions when it is inserted in a gene in the
   correct orientation. Various pUHR263::Tn3Hogus derivatives that showed
   mimosine-inducible or mimosine-repressible GUS activities when
   transferred to the Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 were selected. Mutants
   of TAL1145 were constructed by transferring these Tn3Hogus insertions
   into the TAL1145 chromosome through double-homologous recombination.
   These mutants were classified into five classes on the basis of defects
   in mimosine degradation. The growth of these mutants was inhibited to
   different extents by mimosine applied to the growth medium. Mimosine
   forms a red-colored Fe-mimosine complex when FeCl3 is added to the
   medium. The inhibitory effect of Fe-mimosine on growth of the mutants
   was much less than that of mimosine.},

Abstract = {N2O has a global warming potential of 300 times greater than CO2, and in
   silvopastoral systems, urine is a source of N2O emission. The objective
   of the research was to evaluate the effect of the diet for bovines based
   on Leucaena leucocephala on N2O emissions in a simulated urine patch in
   a silvopastoral system. A Cynodon plectostachyus meadow was used, and 13
   samplings were carried out during March - April 2021. The treatments
   were, A: 20 kg of urea/ha from bovine urine fed with 100\% C.
   plectostachyus hay + 0\% L leucocephala, B: 36 kg of urea/ha from the
   urine of bovines fed with 16\% of L. leucocephala + 84\% of C.
   plectostachyus and C: 79 kg of urea/ ha from the urine of bovines fed
   with 33\% L. leucocephala + 67\% C. plectostachyus. A completely
   randomized design with four replicates was used. Static closed
   stainless-steel chambers were used to obtain gas samples at 0, 10, 20
   and 30 minutes. Environmental temperature, pH, humidity, nitrate and
   ammonium contents in the soil were recorded. Data were analyzed with the
   statistical program SAS 9.0. The N2O emission flux ( mu g/m(2)/h)
   between treatments did not present significant differences. The emission
   peak was observed on the fourth day of sampling in the treatments (A:
   17.49, B: 23.71 and C: 22.88 mu g N2O N m(2)/h). In addition, there was
   a positive correlation between the N2O flux and soil moisture. The
   increase in the amount of L. leucocephala in the diet of the animals did
   not influence the emission of N2O, due to the concentration of urea in
   the urine. However, a positive correlation with soil moisture was
   observed.},

Title = {Spread of common native and invasive grasses and ruderal trees following
   anthropogenic disturbances in a tropical dry forest},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Introduction: A fundamental challenge to the integrity of tropical dry
   forest ecosystems is the invasion of non-native grass species. These
   grasses compete for resources and fuel anthropogenic wildfires. In 2012,
   a bulldozer from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority cleared a
   570-m trail from a state road into a mature dry forest section of
   Guanica Forest to control a wildfire. We monitored colonization by a
   non-native invasive grass (Megathyrsus maximus), a highly invasive tree
   (Leucaena leucocephala), and a native grass (Uniola virgata), as well as
   natural regeneration, along the bulldozer trail. We determined whether
   bulldozing facilitated colonization by these species into the forest and
   the extent of spread.
   Results: Distance from propagule source and temporal variations strongly
   influenced colonization by our three focal species. Megathyrsus maximus
   invaded along the trail from source populations by the state road. The
   establishment of new colonies of M. maximus seedlings went as far as 570
   m inside the forest (i.e., at the end of the bulldozer trail), but we
   found most new colonies within 270 m of the road. Leucaena leucocephala
   exhibited a similar spreading pattern. Before disturbance, Uniola
   virgata was distributed widely across the forest, but the highest
   densities were found in areas near the latter portion (> 401 m) of the
   bulldozer trail. Subsequently, the species formed new clumps along more
   than half of the trail (250 to 570 m), apparently colonizing from
   undisturbed patches nearby.
   Conclusions: Bulldozing facilitated the invasion of non-native
   vegetation. The projected community assemblage will be more fire-prone
   than before since M. maximus carries fire across the landscape better
   than U. virgata, emphasizing the capacity of invasive plant colonization
   to alter local ecological processes after only a single wildfire and
   bulldoze event. Our results provide a valuable baseline for short-term
   vegetation response to anthropogenic disturbances in tropical
   semi-deciduous dry forests.},

Abstract = {Synergistes jonesii is a rumen bacterium that degrades
   3,4-dihydroxypyridine (3,4 DHP), the toxic breakdown product of mimosine
   in leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). Fecal culture is the most practical
   way to determine S. jonesii presence in zoological ruminants,
   particularly if feces can be collected from night penning facilities.
   Fresh rumen fluid and fecal or fecal slurry (sheep {[}Ovis spp.] only,
   1:4 wt to vol. feces and culture media) from cattle (Bos spp.) and
   sheep, known to be colonized by S. jonesii, were subjected various
   storage times (0, 6, 12, and 24 h) and temperatures (5, 23, and
   38degreesC). Samples were inoculated into a culture medium that
   contained 3,4 DHP. In general, storage temperature had no affect on
   detection frequency. Regardless of animal species, detection of S.
   jonesii was higher (P=0.001) in rumen (97\%) than in fecal (40\%)
   samples and level of detection in rumen samples was relatively
   unaffected by storage time. Detection frequency was similar for both
   fecal sample types regardless of time (34\% fecal vs. 29\% fecal
   slurry). For all fecal samples, detection frequency generally exhibited
   a linear decline (P=0.01) with time. This study showed that it will be
   important to collect fresh fecal samples (<6-h old) from night penning
   facilities, and because detection levels were low in fecal material,
   fecal assay would be most accurate on a whole herd rather than an
   individual animal basis.},

Title = {Factors affecting the early growth of Leucaena leucocephala .3. Role of
   indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and its importance in
   determining yield of leucaena in pots and in the field},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-53},
Abstract = {Previous work has shown that slow colonisation of roots by arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may be responsible for the slow early seedling
   growth of leucaena in some soils. The aim of the following experiments
   was to determine relative population levels of AM fungi in a range of
   Australian soils and their effect on the growth and phosphorus nutrition
   of the tropical tree legume leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), grown in
   pots and in the field. Soils chosen were typical of those used for
   leucaena production in Queensland and included sites at which previous
   commercial plantings of leucaena had failed.
   Large differences were found in mycorrhizal population levels between
   soils and results of a bioassay ranged from 12 to 52\% of leucaena root
   length infected. Results of the bioassay were significantly correlated
   with plant height of leucaena grown in pots at 28 and 42 days after
   sowing (P<0.05) and shoot weight 42 days after sowing (P<0.05). However,
   results of the bioassay were not positively correlated with plant growth
   of leucaena 63 days after sowing in pots or at any time in the field.
   This was because colonisation levels in most soils had reached levels
   that were adequate to meet the phosphorus requirements of the plant.
   Low population levels of AM fungi, therefore, do not appear to be a
   major long-term limitation to growth of leucaena in most soils. However,
   at 2 sites where previous commercial leucaena plantings had failed,
   other factors became relatively more important in limiting first season
   yield. These included poor soil physical structure, low phosphorus
   fertility and at 1 site, colonisation of leucaena roots with root knot
   nematode, a factor which had not previously been reported in Australia.
   Soil physical, chemical and biological factors, therefore, all need to
   be considered in selecting suitable sites for leucaena establishment.},

   The differences in their daily dry matter intake values were

   the liveweight gain of steers grazing irrigated Leucaena leucocephala
   Digitaria eriantha pastures in north-west Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {130},

Abstract = {Brahman Shorthorn steers (213+/-4.6 kg initial weight) were grazed on a
   pangola (Digitaria eriantha cv. Steudel) pasture interplanted with
   leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham) in rows 1.8-2.7 m apart
   in the Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) in north-west Western Australia.
   The leucaena comprised a mean of 46\% of the diet but ranged from 100\%
   of the diet on day I to c. 18\% on day 7 of a 7-day grazing period,
   within the rotational grazing system. It was suggested that the low
   herbage allowance of leucaena may have restricted the intake of the
   steers, reducing the quantity and quality of the herbage consumed.
   The steers were also supplemented with maize during the dry and wet
   seasons (1992 and 1992/93). The maize supplement was offered at 0, 0.5,
   1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 kg/head per day, over a 168-day period. Maize
   supplementation at 1.5 kg maize per head per day resulted in an increase
   in the liveweight gain of the steers grazing leucaena/pangola pastures
   in the dry season from 0.73+/-0.05 kg/day (mean+/-S.E.) for no
   supplementation to 1.1+/-0.05 kg/day for 1.5 kg/head per day of maize.
   Maize supplementation up to 2.0 kg/day did not further increase the
   liveweight gain. A. high rate of substitution of leucaena and pangola
   intake for the maize supplement occurred.
   There was a large seasonal difference in liveweight gain (mean 0.89 v.
   0.63 kg/day for the dry and wet seasons respectively; P<0.001)
   irrespective of the level of maize supplementation. This seasonal
   difference in liveweight gain was not primarily a function of the
   herbage on offer, but was most probably a direct function of the effect
   of the seasonal temperature and humidity influencing the feed intake and
   growth rate of these Brahman crossbred cattle.
   This system produced some of the higher liveweight gains recorded per
   hectare for a grazing system (1570-2110 kg/ha per year), as a result of
   the very good individual liveweight gains (250-340 kg/head per year) and
   high stocking rate (6.25 head/ha).},

Abstract = {To solve the water pollution problem by arsenic contamination resulting
   from human technological activities has for long presented a challenge.
   Biosorbents shows better efficiency and multiple reuses to increase
   their economic attractiveness. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
   technology is a robust artificial intelligence technology that can
   handle the complex and dynamic nature of adsorption processes. A single
   layer ANN model was developed to predict the sorption efficiency of
   arsenic species from water bodies using Leucaena leucocephala seed
   powder. Batch experiments resulted into standardization of optimum
   conditions: biosorbent dosage (4.0 g), arsenic concentration (25 mg/L),
   volume (200 mL) at pH 7.5 for As (III) and 2.5 for As (V).
   Back-Propagation and Lenvenberg-Marquardt techniques are used to train
   various neural network architectures and the accuracy of the obtained
   models have been examined by using test data set. The optimal neural
   network architectures of this process contain 14 neurons with minimum
   mean squared error. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was found best of
   BP algorithms with a minimum mean squared error for training and cross
   validation as 1.63694 x 10(-5) and 0.000157767 respectively.},

Abstract = {A water-absorbent hybrid hydrogel was prepared using arabinoxylans from
   flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) (FX) and galactomannans from subabul
   (Leucaena leucocephala) (SG) in the presence of kappa-carrageenan (kappa
   C) with variable concentration of potassium chloride as crosslinker
   (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.3 M), and evaluated on the basis of their
   swelling rate (\%). The optimized hydrogel (GAXH) from a blend of SG,
   kappa C, FX and KCl at 5.5\% w/v, 1.32\% w/v, 1\% w/v and 0.3M,
   respectively, showed 300\% swelling in water at room temperature and pH
   7.4 with 100\% retention of water for 30 days at 10 degree celsius.
   Blending 50\% w/w GAXH in the soil could retain 140\% water for 30 days,
   acting as a water reservoir in the soil system at 35 degree celsius and
   pH 7.4 which reached 100\% evaporation after 60 days. Incorporation of
   50\% w/w GAXH in sandy, loamy soil was used for the potted cultivation
   of cherry tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme) and observed
   for growth and composition of the tomatoes. GAXH enhanced the
   physiological growth of both the plant as well as cherry tomatoes by
   controlling the release of KCl into the soil and maintaining soil
   moisture when 3 day intermittent watering schedule was used. An
   additional advantage was an improved water use efficiency and reduction
   in water footprint from 3.23 cm(3)/g to 9.32 cm(3)/g and 19.87 mL/fruit
   to 8.56 mL/fruit, respectively. The fully ripened tomatoes grown on

   99-107 mg beta-carotene equivalent/100g fresh weight, 223-241 mg gallic
   acid equivalent/100 g fresh weight, respectively, than control cherry

Abstract = {Alley cropping with leguminous tree hedgerows planted on contours is an
   emerging practice in the northern highlands of Rwanda where field slopes
   range from 4 to 76\% and loss of soil fertility due to erosion is the
   principal impediment to food production. Sesbania sesban and Leucaena
   Leucocephala, the two woody species recommended for alley cropping in
   the region, do not perform equally well across sites: Sesbania is faster
   growing, but is more sensitive to pruning than Leucaena. We tested the
   hypothesis that the two species could be grown together to make the best
   use of their relative advantages. Species were planted in pure and 1:I
   mixed stands at 26 sites to give a range of altitudes, slopes, azimuths
   and soil fertility levels representative of the region. During two
   cropping seasons',growth spanning 19 months, in pure stands, Sesbania
   produced more biomass, grew taller and had thicker stems than Leucaena:
   for the same species, stem diameter and height were not different in
   pure and mixed stands. Biomass and number of poles from 1:1 mixed stands
   of Sesbania and Leucaena were equivalent to biomass and pole numbers
   from Sesbania in pure stands. However, mixed stands produced more
   biomass and pole numbers than Leucaena in pure stands. Growth of S.
   sesban was positively correlated with soil pH, potassium and altitude;
   whereas, growth of L. leucocephala was positively correlated with soil
   phosphorus, but negatively correlated with field slope. All other soil
   and site variables tested were nonsignificant. The study suggests that
   farmers can plant S. sesban and L. leucocephala in 1:1 mixtures in an
   alley cropping setting and retain levels of biomass production and bean
   pole numbers equivalent to those from S. sesban alone without
   compromising, future growth and production by Leucaena. As well, the
   impact of pH, K and P on growth and production of Sesbania and Leucaena
   as a function of field slope and altitude should be determined before
   extending their use to other regions.},

   Importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, grass competition and

Abstract = {Slow seedling growth is a Limitation to the more widespread adoption of
   the tree legume, leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). Three glasshouse
   trials examined the role of arbuscular mycorrhiza and phosphorus (P)
   nutrition in determining early growth and nodulation of leucaena.
   Treatments included soil types, inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (AM) fungi, P application, grass competition and fumigation with methyl
   bromide, an anti-fungal agent. Plant measurements included colonisation
   by AM fungi, nodule weight, tissue nitrogen (N) and P concentrations.
   Slower early growth of leucaena in a soil from Mt Cotton than in soils
   from Gayndah or Theodore was due to slow colonisation of roots by AM
   fungi. Sequential harvests of plants revealed that rate of colonisation
   in the Mt Cotton soil was only half that in the Theodore soil prior to
   28 days after planting resulting in subcritical P concentrations 21 days
   after sowing and an approximate halving of top dry weight 41 days after
   sowing. However, following increased infection, tissue P concentration
   and final plant growth 98 days after sowing were similar in both soils.
   Early seedling growth in the Mt Cotton soil was increased by inoculating
   the soil with mulch containing AM fungi but not with soil collected from
   beneath established leucaena added at a lower rate. Phosphorus
   application significantly increased growth of leucaena seedlings, but
   only the highest rate of 1200 kg P/ha was able to prevent early P
   deficiency. Final growth was reduced by 50\% in the presence of Panicum
   maximum as a result of increased competition for N and P and by 90\% in
   fumigated soil as a result of P deficiency.
   The results of these experiments confirm the important role of AM fungi
   on early seedling growth of leucaena. However, the potential to increase
   early growth using a soil or mulch inoculum containing AM fungi or P
   fertiliser may be limited by the high rates of application needed. More
   work is needed to determine whether slow rate of infection is a
   significant limitation in soils other than the Mt Cotton soil in the
   field.},

Abstract = {Forage cactus responds positively to organic fertilization. However,
   little is known about the mineralization dynamics of the various sources
   of existing organic fertilizers. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the
   release of nutrients from different manure types and the nutrient
   accumulation in forage cactus across different cropping systems.
   Different manure sources (cattle, goat, sheep, and broiler litter) were
   evaluated for the following cropping systems: (i) Gliricidia sepium
   intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertania; (ii) Leucaena leucocephala
   intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertania; and (iii) Cactus cv.
   IPA-Sertania in monoculture, in the tropical semiarid region of Brazil.
   The rate of decomposition and release of N, P, and K from manure was
   determined by incubating a litterbag, evaluated in different periods (0,
   4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 days). Broiler litter released the
   greatest amount of N and P. Sheep manure released the greatest amounts
   of K. The greatest accumulations of N, P, and K in cactus biomass
   occurred when broiler litter was applied. Cactus monoculture accumulated
   less N over 256 days, indicating that the presence of tree legumes
   favors the accumulation of N in cactus. Broiler litter promoted the best
   synchronism between N release and N uptake in different cropping
   systems.},

   Leucaena observed at 0.02 mg P was comparable with that observed at 0.8
   mg P l(-1), Increasing P concentration from 0.02 to 0.8 mg P l(-1)
   increased target soil pH from 4.3 to 4.7 and reduced the concentration
   of available soil Mn from 15.1 to 1.9 mg l(-1). Thus, the normal plant
   growth observed at the higher P concentration at pH<5 was mainly due to
   the alleviation of Mn toxicity as a result of its precipitation by
   excess P. VAMF colonization levels observed at pH 5.0-6.0 were similar,
   but maximal plant growth occurred at pH 6.0, suggesting that the optimal
   pH for mycorrhizal formation was substantially lower than for VAMF
   effectiveness. The poor growth of Leucaena at the lower P concentration
   in the unlimed soil was largely due to high concentrations of Mn2+ and

Abstract = {A study was conducted in long-term alley cropping plots established in
   1989 at International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan,
   southwestern Nigeria to determine the seasonal and yearly dynamics of
   dry matter and nutrient concentrations of hedgerow pruning under
   continuous cropping and response to fallow of 1-3 years. At one year
   after Leucaena leucocephala transplanting, pruning was started at the 75
   cm height. The pruning frequency increased from one to five times per
   year as trees grew. In continuous alley cropping without fertilizer
   application, pruning dry matter decreased gradually from a peak of 5 t
   ha(-1) at 3 years after Leucaena transplanting to about 2.5 t ha(-1) at
   11 years after transplanting, while the ratio of dry season to wet
   season biomass increased. Within 5 years after establishment, nitrogen
   (N) and phosphor-us (P) concentrations in pruning decreased and Mg
   increased with the continuous cropping. Fallow clearly increased pruning
   biomass and nutrient concentrations. At the completion of the first
   cycle (1993), the pruning N yield was 170 kg ha(-1) for the continuous
   cropping plot, and 269 for plots with 1 yr fallow, 344 for plots with 2
   yr fallow and 241 kg ha(-1) for plots with 3 yr fallow. In 1993 pruning

Abstract = {Crop response, tree biomass production and changes in soil fertility
   characteristics were monitored in a long-term (1986-2002) alley-cropping
   trial in Ibadan, Nigeria. The systems included two alley cropping
   systems with Leucaena leucocephala and Senna siamea on the one hand and
   a control (no-trees) system on the other hand, all cropped annually with
   a maize-cowpea rotation. All systems had a plus and minus fertilizer
   treatment. Over the years, the annual biomass return through tree
   prunings declined steadily, but more drastically for Leucaena than for
   Senna. In 2002, the nitrogen contribution from Leucaena residues
   stabilized at about 200 kg N/ha/year, while the corresponding value for
   Senna was about 160 kg N/ha/year. On average, the four Leucaena prunings
   were more equal in biomass as well as in amounts of N, P and cations,
   while the first Senna pruning was always contributing up to 60\% of the
   annual biomass or nutrient return. Maize crop yields declined steadily
   in all treatments, but the least so in the Senna + fertilizer treatment
   where in 2002 still 2.2 tonnes/ha of maize were obtained. Nitrogen
   fertilizer use efficiency was usually higher in the Senna treatment
   compared to the control or the Leticaena treatment. Added benefits due
   to the combined use of fertilizer N and organic matter additions were
   observed only for the Senna treatment and only in the last 6 years. At
   all other times, they remained absent or were even negative in the
   Leucaena treatments for the first 3 years. Most chemical soil fertility
   parameters decreased in all the treatments, but less so in the alley
   cropping systems. The presence of trees had a positive effect on
   remaining carbon stocks, while they were reduced compared to the 1986
   data. Trees had a positive effect on the maintenance of exchangeable
   cations in the top soil. Exchangeable Ca, Mg and K - and hence ECEC -
   were only slightly reduced after 16 years of cropping in the tree-based
   systems, and even increased in the Senna treatments. In the control
   treatments, values for all these parameters reduced to 50\% or less of
   the original values after 16 years. All the above points to the
   Senna-based alley system with fertilizers as the more resilient one.
   This is reflected in all soil fertility parameters, in added benefits
   due to the combined use of fertilizer nitrogen and organic residue
   application and in a more stable maize yield over the years, averaging
   2.8 tonnes/ha with maximal deviations from the average not exceeding
   21\%.},

Abstract = {Five tropical soils were either not inoculated or inoculated with the

   degree to which VAM effectiveness was expressed in the soils was
   evaluated prior and after solution P status was adjusted for optimal VAM
   activity. VAM effectiveness determined by monitoring P concentrations of
   pinnules of Leucaena leucocephala leaves as a function of time and as
   dry matter yield determined at the time of harvest, indicated that in
   three of the soils VAM effectiveness was either very restricted or
   altogether unexpressed irrespective of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungal (VAMF) inoculation if soil solution P was not optimized for VAM
   effectiveness. After P optimization, effectiveness was significantly
   increased by VAMF inoculation although in four of the soils, densities
   of indigenous VAMF propagules greatly exceeded that attained by the
   inoculum after it was mixed with soil. Mycorrhizal fungal inoculation
   effects varied from soil to soil, depending on the extent to which the
   effectiveness of indigenous and introduced endophytes was enhanced by P
   optimization and the similarity of inherent soil solution P
   concentrations to the range known to be optimum for VAM effectiveness.
   Of the indicator variables monitored, VAMF colonization was least
   sensitive to treatment effects followed by shoot P concentration
   measured at the time of harvest.},

Abstract = {Research was conducted to examine the effect of Rhizobial race and N
   fertilization on N-2 fixation and N partitioning in seedlings of the
   genus Leucaena. Seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) Dewit variety
   K-8 and L. retusa Gray variety Yellow Puff were grown in slender tubes
   filled with fritted clay and watered with nutrient solutions containing
   0, 2, or 8 mM nitrate N labeled with 0.1\% N-15. The seedlings were
   inoculated with Rhizobia loti race 94A3 or R. loti race 9408. After 12
   weeks the plants were harvested and the effects of N fertilization and
   Rhizobial race on nodulation N-2 fixation, and N partitioning were
   examined. Using the N-15-dilution method total N fixed by dinitrogen
   fixation was determined as well as distribution of fixed versus
   fertilizer N within the plant. Both Rhizobial races infected both
   Leucaena species resulting in an effective symbiosis. However, the 2
   Leucaena species responded quite differently to N fertilization. The
   addition of 2 mM N to the nutrient solution effectively eliminated
   nodulation in L. retusa yet increased both nodulation and N-2 fixation
   in L. leucocephala. The 8 mM N rate eliminated nodulation in both
   species. Due to the elimination of nodulation and N-2 fixation by N
   fertilization in L. retusa, the effect of N fertilization on
   partitioning of fixed N was only examined in L. leucocephala. Increasing
   the N content of the nutrient solution increased the proportion of total
   N in the shoot and reduced the proportion in nodules. A larger
   proportion of the fixed N was retained in the root and nodules than
   fertilizer N. Although the 2 mM N treatment increased the amount of N-2
   fixed in L. leucocephala compared to the 0 mM treatment, the proportion
   of fixed N-2 was reduced to less than one third of the total N in the

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae), an agroforestry tree
   with invasive properties, was targeted for biological control in South
   Africa. The seed beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer)
   (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was released in 1999 to curb its excessive
   seed production without negating its beneficial properties. The adult
   beetles oviposit on the seed pods and loose seeds of L. leucocephala and
   the hatching larvae enter the seeds and destroy them during their
   development. Although the beetle has become widely established in South
   Africa, its contribution to the weed's management is unknown. The aims
   of this pilot study were to assess: (i) the levels of seed damage
   inflicted by A. macrophthalmus on L. leucocephala populations and; (ii)
   the extent to which the endophagous immature stages have recruited
   native parasitoids. The study was carried out over seven months at three
   sites in the KwaZulu-Natal coastal region, where L. leucocephala is
   abundant. Mean seed damage was inconsistent, with considerable variation
   (2-62 \%) between sites and time of collection. On average, <30 \% of
   available seeds was damaged at each site. Five species of parasitoids
   (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) were consistently reared from beetle-damaged
   seeds, two of which (both Pteromalidae) were most commonly associated
   with the beetles. Mean mortality resulting from parasitism was similarly
   inconsistent and variable (1-22 \%) between sites and time of
   collection. Although parasitism increased with increased seed damage, on
   average only 7-9 \% of larvae/pupae were parasitized at the three sites.
   The modest levels of seed damage recorded in this study appear
   insufficient to regulate populations of L. leucocephala in South Africa.},

Abstract = {Two 4 x 4 Latin square design experiments were completed. In experiment
   1, four mature Anglo-Nubian x Fiji goats were used to study effects of
   supplementation of a basal diet of maize stover with Erythrina variegata
   (E) Gliricidia sepium (G) and Leucaena leucocephala (L). Parameters
   measured were dry matter intake (DMI) and nutrient digestibility. Maize
   stover (MS) was treated with urea, used as a control diet, and had a
   crude protein (CP) content of 9.3\%. Erythrina variegata was higher in
   CP than L and G. DMI of the urea-treated stover diet was lower (P <
   0.05) than the untreated MS supplemented with E, G or L. Among the
   legume supplements, DMI (g/kg W-0.75 per day) was lower (P < 0.05) in
   the MS/G diet compared to MS/E or MS/L diets. There were differences (P
   < 0.05) between the urea-treated maize stover (UTMS) and MS with either
   E, G or L on the digestibility of dry matter (DM), CP, neutral detergent
   fibre (NDF), OM and energy (P < 0.05), but no differences (P > 0.05)
   among MS/L, MS/E and MS/G. In experiment 2, four mature goats were used
   to measure the response of goats when the UTMS; MS/legume diets were
   sprayed with molasses. The DMI (g/kg W-0.75 per day) of the urea-treated
   MS sprayed with molasses was lower (P < 0.05) than the MS/legume, but
   DMI among the MS/legume diets did not differ. The digestibility of DM,
   CP, NDF, OM and energy of urea-treated MS were lower (P < 0.05) than
   values found for MS/legume diets. It is suggested that either E, G or L
   could be used as protein supplements to improve the nutritional quality
   of MS fed to mature goats. Addition of molasses to diets further
   improved DMI and apparent nutrient digestibility by the goats. This
   study shows the substantial effect of legume supplements on MS intake
   and digestibility by goats. Molasses, when available, should be sprayed
   on fresh leaves of Gliricidia sepium and other forage legumes, that are
   initially rejected, in order to improve their acceptance and DMI when
   fed in confinement or in cut-and-carry production systems. (C) 2003

Abstract = {Synergistes jonesii is a rumen bacterium that degrades toxic
   pyridinediols from Leucaena leucocephala. This work presents progress on
   the characterization of the degradation of dihydroxypyridines from L.
   leucocephala by S. jonesii, and particularly by its cell free extracts.
   The substrate 3-hydroxy-4-{[}1H]-pyridone (3,4-DHP) induced degradation
   of both 3,4- and 2,3-dihydroxypyridine (2,3-DHP) isomers, while 2,3-DHP
   induced only degradation of 2,3-DHP. The 2,3-DHP was an intermediate of
   the degradation of 3,4-DHP by cultures. The compound
   2,6-dihydroxypyridine inhibited degradation of 2,3 DHP by extracts of
   cells previously induced with this substrate. Cell-free extracts from S,
   jonesii had a high hydrogenase activity and degraded 2,3-DHP
   anaerobically either in the presence of methyl viologen under H-2 or in
   the presence of alpha-ketoacids under H-2 or N-2. Specific activity of
   2,3-DHP degradation was increased when FAD(+) or CoA were present. The
   pyridine ring of the 2,3-DHP is enzymatically reduced by S. jonesii in
   reactions that demand reducing power provided by hydrogenase activity or
   by the metabolism of pyruvate. An unidentified non-polar amino compound
   appeared in thin layer chromatography as 2,3-DHP was degraded. We
   anticipate that gas chromatography mass spectrometry will permit the
   purification and identification of products from the cell-free reaction
   mix, which represents a simpler system than cell cultures, so that a
   pathway for pyridinediol metabolism by S. jonesii can be proposed. (C)

   longer and the rest time was shorter in the sheep grazing in the wooded
   meadow. It was found that the body temperature taken by straight route
   decreased 0.25 and 0.38 degrees C in the dry and rainy season,
   respectively, in relation to the animals that grazed in monoculture
   meadows. Sheep ate more tree foliage and drank more water during the dry

   and forage legume diets were sprayed with molasses. The intake of the
   urea-treated stover diet sprayed with molasses was significantly lower
   (p<0.05) that that of the maize stover/forage legume diets sprayed with
   molasses. The DMI of the diets improved with the addition of molasses.
   The DMI among the goats offered the maize stover/forage legume diets +
   molasses did not differ significantly. (p>0.05). Statistically
   significant (p<0.05) differences were obtained in this second study
   between the urea-treated stover and the stover supplemented with forage
   legumes in the digestibility of DM, CP, NDF, OM and energy. The stover
   supplemented with forage legumes had a higher (P < 0.05) nutrient
   digestibility. The present studies demonstrated that the use of forage
   legumes as protein supplements improved the feed quality of maize stover
   in the diets of mature goats. It is suggested that molasses should be
   sprayed on fresh leaves of Gliricicia sepium and other forage legumes
   that are initially rejected, in order to improve acceptance and DMI when
   fed to ruminant animals in confinement or in a cut-and-carry system of
   production.},

Title = {Augmenting Leucaena leucocephala biomass with mineral

Abstract = {Food security in semi-arid regions is threatened by declining soil
   fertility, soil moisture stress and long frequent droughts as a result
   of erratic rainfall. Therefore we assessed the effects of augmenting
   Leucaena leucocephala biomass (organic manure) with mineral fertiliser
   on rainwater use efficiency, agronomic efficiency, grain and stover
   yields for two sorghum varieties (Macia and SV1) under rainwater
   harvesting techniques. The experiment was laid in split-split plot
   arrangement with rainwater harvesting method as main plot factor, with
   Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser as subplot factor and sorghum variety
   as sub-sub plot factor over three cropping seasons. Data collected
   include rainwater use efficiency, agronomic efficiency, grain and stover
   yields. Results show that tied contours have significantly (p <= 0.05)
   higher grain and stover yields from all varieties and seasons.
   Irre-gardless of sorghum variety, tied contours had significant (p <=
   0.05) sorghum grain and stover yield followed by infiltration pits and
   lastly standard contours. Grain and stover yields improved with
   increasing levels of Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser combination.
   Highest grain yields observed were 1.146 t ha-1 (Macia) and 1.1 t ha-1
   (SV1) from tied contour +15 t ha-1 biomass +150 kg ha-1 NPK fertiliser
   treatments. Rainwater use efficiency was significantly (p <= 0.05)
   higher from tied contours compared to infiltration pits and standard
   contour. Rainwater use efficiency was statistically (p <= 0.05)
   influenced by increasing application levels of Leucaena biomass + NPK
   fertiliser in all seasons. Agronomic efficiencies were considerably (p
   <= 0.05) affected by rainwater harvesting, Leucaena biomass + NPK
   fertiliser and interaction of all factors. It can therefore be concluded
   that Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser, tied contours and infiltration
   pits improve sorghum yields. Augmenting 2.5 t ha-1 biomass with 25 kg
   ha-1 NPK fertiliser under tied contours and Macia have better agronomic
   efficiency.},

Abstract = {The ultrafunctional potential of zinc oxide (ZnO) and copper oxide (CuO)
   nanoparticles (NPs) has generated a great interest in using such metal
   oxides as remarkable and electroactive nanocomposites in the studies on
   potentiometry and sensors. These nano-oxides were prepared from the
   extract of Leucaena leucocephala seeds as an environmentally friendly
   process. The development of a ZnO/CuO ``core-shell
   nanocomposite-modified{''} coated copper wire film sensor was proposed
   as a new method for potentiometric determination of pseudoephedrine
   hydrochloride (PSD) in pure and pharmaceutical dosage forms. With the
   existence of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a polymer with high molecular
   weight and ``o-nitrophenyl octyl ether (o-NPOE) as a solvent
   mediator{''}, PSD was combined with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) to
   produce pseudoephedrine hydrochloride-phosphotungstate (PSD-PT) as a
   sensing substance. The improved sensor showed a very high sensitivity
   and selectivity for determining and quantifying the PSD with a linear
   relationship of 1.0x10(-8)-1.0x10(-2) mol L-1. It was estimated that the
   regression equation was represented by the EmV = (-58.143) log {[}PSD] +
   526.71. With the proposed sensors, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride could
   be effectively determined in pure and commercial product forms.},

Abstract = {Soil organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) accumulation in the top
   0-0.15m of leucaena-grass pastures were compared with native pastures
   and with continuously cropped land. OC and TN levels were highest under
   long-term leucaena-grass pasture (P < 0.05). For leucaena-grass pastures
   that had been established for 20, 31, and 38 years, OC accumulated at
   rates that exceeded those of the adjacent native grass pasture by 267,
   140, and 79 kg/ha. year, respectively, while TN accumulated at rates
   that exceeded those of the native grass pastures by 16.7, 10.8, and 14.0
   kg/ha. year, respectively. At a site where 14-year-old leucaena-grass
   pasture was adjacent to continuously cropped land, there were benefits
   in OC accumulation of 762 kg/ha. year and in TN accumulation of 61.9
   kg/ha. year associated with the establishment of leucaena-grass
   pastures. Similar C : N ratios (range 12.7-14.5) of soil OC in leucaena
   and grass-only pastures indicated that plant-available N limited soil OC
   accumulation in pure grass swards. Higher OC accumulation occurred near
   leucaena hedgerows than in the middle of the inter-row in most
   leucaena-grass pastures.
   Rates of C sequestration were compared with simple models of greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions from the grazed pastures. The amount of carbon
   dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) accumulated in additional topsoilOC of
   leucaena-grass pastures <= 20 years old offset estimates of the amount
   of CO2-e emitted in methane and nitrous oxide from beef cattle grazing
   these pastures, thus giving positive GHG balances. Less productive,
   aging leucaena pastures > 20 years old had negative GHG balances; lower
   additional topsoil OC accumulation rates compared with native grass
   pastures failed to offset animal emissions.},

Abstract = {Three trials to evaluate the potential of alley cropping in maize
   production on the low fertility, acidic soils in Northern Zambia are
   described. Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Sesbania sesban,
   Albizia falcataria, Flemingia congesta, and Cassia spectabilis, were
   grown in alley crops with hybrid maize and soybean. All trials received
   recommended rates of P and K fertiliser; N fertiliser was applied at
   three rates as a subplot treatment. One trial received lime before
   establishment.
   Only in the limed trial was there a significant improvement in maize
   yields through alley cropping; when no N fertiliser was applied,
   incorporation of Leucaena leucocephala prunings resulted in an increase
   of up to 95\% in yields, with a smaller improvement being produced by
   Flemingia congesta. There was a significant correlation between the
   quantity of prunings biomass applied and the proportional increase in
   maize yields over the control treatment. It is suggested that the lack
   of effect of most of the tree species on crop yields was due to low
   biomass production.
   An economic analysis showed that alley cropping with limed Leucaena was
   only profitable when fertiliser costs were high in relation to maize
   prices. However, lime is both expensive and difficult to obtain and
   transport for most small scale farmers in the region, and is therefore
   not a practical recommendation. It is suggested that future alley
   cropping research should focus on screening a wider range of tree
   species, including other species of Leucaena, for acid tolerance and
   higher biomass production.},

Abstract = {Understanding carbon (C) dynamics of the silvopastoral systems can help

   the C concentration and storage in above- and belowground tree biomass
   as well as in the soils of fodder banks of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.)
   de Wit, Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) or a combination of the both species.
   The above- and belowground biomass was quantified by the destructive
   sampling. We also obtained samples from soil pits, 20-cm deep, and
   determined bulk density and organic carbon concentration. The mixed
   species banks produced more foliage dry matter (DM) (6.3 t DM/ha) than
   the pure fodder banks. The total living biomass stocks ranged from 31.5
   to 33.5 t DM/ha and did not differ between fodder bank types. The tissue
   C concentration was greater in stems (45.1\%) and roots (44.9\%)
   compared to the foliage component (43.4\%). Total soil carbon (TSC) in
   the 5-10 cm layer was greater in the fodder banks with legumes alone
   than in mixed species banks (35.7 vs. 30.8 t C/ha). TSC storage in the
   15-20 cm layer was greater in the nonlegume fodder bank than in the
   legume fodder bank (39.8 vs. 34.5 t C/ha). However, to the 0-20 cm
   layer, TSC was similar for all fodder banks. Thus, the three types of
   fodder banks had similar total C storage in plant biomass and soil, but
   the production of foliage biomass was higher in the mixed species banks.},

   clear that the best method to establish leucaena was by transplanting
   1-2-month-old seedlings at the beginning of the rainy season that had
   been pre-prepared in poly-bags at a nursery. However, with varied
   conditions at the study locations, such as the absence of a dry season
   water source, farmers have used other methods, including: direct
   seeding; poly-bag seedlings planted later in the wet season; or older
   bare-root seedlings harvested from a high-density nursery or from
   volunteer seedlings growing between rows of established leucaena. This
   paper elaborates on the different methods of establishment in farmer

   carbohydrate varies significantly. Green pods are of dual importance to
   supply fiber and nutrients. The empty fully ripened pods are fibrous.
   The seeds, besides having rich protein content, have 20-25\%
   galactomannan  gum which has the potential to be used as a laxative and
   in vegetable soups. Mimosine content is higher in the green pods, but it
   is thermolabile.},

Abstract = {The fast-growing Central American tree Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit (Leguminosae: Mimosoidaeae) has been widely planted in the tropics
   since the 1970s for agro-forestry, reforestation, and fodder. Since the
   mid-1980s the tree has suffered serious damage throughout its exotic
   range from the psyllid Heteropsylla cubana Crawford, which is also
   native to Central America. This article summarizes field studies on the
   tree and the psyllid conducted at 2 sites in north Thailand: a cool
   highland and a warm valley site. In the highlands, mean psyllid
   densities per shoot were slightly higher, defoliation was greater, and
   dry matter production losses due to the psyllid were >3 times higher
   than those at the valley site (62.5 and 18.3\% losses, respectively).
   Using field data, the lower thermal thresholds for tree growth and
   psyllid development were 11.2 and 9.6 degrees C, respectively. Psyllid
   abundance was negatively correlated to temperature. When maximum
   temperatures exceeded 36 degrees C, psyllid abundance fell dramatically,
   mortality increased, and body size decreased. These data suggest that
   the tree and the psyllid are climatically mismatched. H, cubana prefers
   new shoots, and population cycles were related to tree growth cycles.
   Finally, populations of the introduced parasitoid Psyllaephagus yaseeni
   Noyes (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), native coccinellids, and spiders showed
   little correlation to the psyllid population's intrinsic rate of
   increase. Percentages of parasitism by P, yaseeni were low (mean =
   1.2-1.9\%, maximum = 6.0\%) and no evidence of density dependent
   regulation was found.},

Abstract = {Leaf meals are potential alternatives to soybean meal (SBM) in fish
   diets in developing countries because they are cheaper. Moringa oleifera
   (MOR) and Leucaena leucocephala (LEU) reduced nutrient digestibility of
   diets compared with SBM in an earlier study. However, fish raised
   outdoors consume natural foods, which might offset the negative effects
   of leaf-meal diets. We conducted a feeding trial using mixed-sex Nile
   tilapia (5.2 g) to assess performance of fish fed 36\% protein diets
   with different concentrations of MOR and LEU leaf meals in place of SBM.
   Fish in static pools were fed daily to apparent satiation for 59 d.
   Individual weight gain (30.4-34.7 g), survival (91.8-97.3\%), feed
   conversion ratio (FCR, 1.6-1.9), proximate composition, plasma lysozyme
   activity, and intestinal proteolytic enzyme activity were similar among
   diets. However, fish fed diets containing leaf meals had higher
   concentrations of n-3 fatty acids than those fed the SBM control.
   Despite lower nutrient availability of the leaf-meal diets compared with
   the soy diet, MOR or LEU could replace up to 30\% of the SBM protein
   without reducing fish performance. Inclusion of poultry meal in the
   diets and probable nutrient supplementation from natural foods appeared
   to compensate for the lower nutritional value of the leaf meals compared
   with SBM.},

   cactus with tree legumes on soil microbial biomass and organic matter in
   the semi-arid tropic, state of Pernambuco, Brazil. We assessed the
   following cropping systems: (i) Gliricidia sepium intercropped with
   cactus cv. IPA-Sertania; (ii) Leucaena leucocephala intercropped with
   cactus cv. IPA-Sertania; and (iii) Cactus cv. IPA-Sertania in
   monoculture. Samples were collected during the dry and rainy seasons in
   the 0- to 0.10- and 0.10- to 0.20-m soil layers at 0, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5
   m in a perpendicular gradient from tree legume rows. The following
   responses were determined: delta C-13 and delta N-15, C and N, microbial
   activity and biomass, and metabolic, microbial, and mineralization
   quotient. delta C-13 and delta N-15 varied with the distance from the
   trees. In the dry season and beginning of the rainy season, the cropping
   systems showed similar values for C, N, microbial activity, carbon, and
   nitrogen in the microbial biomass. The presence of tree legumes at the
   end of the rainy season favored soil microbiota, which showed a reduced
   loss of C-CO2, with no indication of metabolic stress and greater
   microbial biomass and microbial quotient in relation to forage cactus in
   monoculture.},

Abstract = {The successful nodulation of legumes by a Rhizobium strain is determined
   by the competitive ability of that strain against the mixture of other
   native and inoculant rhizobia. Competition among 6 Leucaena rhizobial
   strains in single and multistrain inoculants were studied. Field
   inoculation trials were conducted in an oxisol and a mollisol soil, both
   of which contained indigenous Leucaena-nodulating rhizobia.
   Strain-specific fluorescent antibodies were used for the identification
   of the strains in Leucaena nodules. Mixtures of 3 recommended inoculum
   strains for Leucaena spp. (TAL82, TAL582 and TAL1145) were used in
   peat-based inocula either alone or with one of the three other strains
   isolated from the sites, B213, B214 and B215. Each of these latter 3
   strains was also used as single-strain inocula to study their
   competition with the native rhizobia in the 2 soil systems. In the
   oxisol soil, strains B213 and B215, when used as single-strain inocula,
   outcompeted the native rhizobia and formed 92 and 62\% of the nodules,
   respectively. Strain B214 was the least competitive in oxisol soil,
   where it formed 30\% of the nodules, and the best in mollisol soil,
   where it formed 70\% of the nodules. The most successful competitor for
   nodulation in multistrain inocula was strain TAL1145, which outcompeted
   native and other inoculum Leucaena rhizobia in both soils. None of the
   strains in single or multistrain inoculatns was capable of completely
   overcoming the resident  rhizobia, which formed 4-70\% of the total
   nodules in oxisol soil and 12-72\% in mollisol soil. No strong
   relationship was detected between the size of the rhizosphere population
   of a strain and its successful occupation of nodules.},

Abstract = {In separate experiments, mature rats were either given a ration
   containing L. leucocephala leaf meal at 15\% or 7.5\% level, or dosed
   orally each day with water extract of the leaf meal before and during

   greatly reduced, and they showed general symptoms of inanition. All the
   females were infertile and the males showed reduced libido and
   fertility. In the other experiments the majority of the females
   conceived, but on autopsy it was observed that they had a significantly
   larger proportion of foetuses dead and undergoing resorption as compared
   with those of the control group. The results suggested that the toxic
   material in L. leucocephala, probably mimosine, produced infertility in
   the rat by reducing the food intake; when food consumption was adequate
   for reproductive function, the toxic material caused a high incidence of
   fetal death and resorption. {[}L. leucocephala is distributed throughout

Abstract = {Phytoremediation strategies utilize plants to decontaminate or
   immobilize soil pollutants. Among soil pollutants, metalloid As is
   considered a primary concern as a toxic element to organisms. Arsenic
   concentrations in the soil result from anthropogenic activities such as:
   the use of pesticides (herbicides and fungicides); some fertilizers; Au,
   Pb, Cu and Ni mining; Fe and steel production; coal combustion; and as a
   bi-product during natural gas extraction. This study evaluated the
   potential of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), wand riverhemp (Sesbania
   virgata), and lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala) as phytoremediators of
   soils polluted by As. Soil samples were placed in plastic pots,
   incubated with different As doses (0; 50; 100 and 200 mg dm(-3)) and
   then sown with seeds of the three species. Thirty (pigeon pea) and 90
   days after sowing, the plants were evaluated for height, collar diameter
   and dry matter of young, intermediate and basal leaves, stems and roots.
   Arsenic concentration was determined in different aged leaves, stems and
   roots to establish the translocation index (TI) between the plant root
   system and aerial plant components and the bioconcentration factors
   (BF). The evaluated species showed distinct characteristics regarding As
   tolerance, since the lead tree and wand riverhemp were significantly
   more tolerant than pigeon pea. The high As levels found in wand
   riverhemp roots suggest the existence of an efficient accumulation and
   compartmentalization mechanism in order to reduce As translocation to
   shoot tissues. Pigeon pea is a sensitive species and could serve as a
   potential bioindicator plant, whereas the other two species have
   potential for phytoremediation programs in As polluted areas. However,
   further studies are needed with longer exposure times in actual field
   conditions to reach definite conclusions on relative phytoremediation
   potentials.},

Abstract = {Protein is a polypeptide, which is composed of a series of amino acids,
   with a relatively very large molecular weight, which ranges from 8,000
   to 10,000 Da. Separation of protein can be done by chemical, enzymatic
   or using an ultrafiltration membrane. Applications of protein
   concentrates product depends on its functional properties such as water
   absorption, oil absorption capacity and power emulsions, and foaming
   power which will affect the quality of product. Food product that use
   protein concentrates in the form of sausages, meatballs, bakery and
   beverages. Techniques of membrane separation are generally based on
   particle size and molecular weight of the thrust in the form of pressure
   differences, and different electric field concentration. This study aims
   to determine the role of membrane ultrafiltration to separate proteins
   and produce the characteristic functional properties. This study used
   two main factors, ultrafiltration membrane pressure (2.33 atm, 3.66 atm)
   and the separation time (15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes). The
   resulted showed leucaena seed protein concentrates obtained from the
   best treatment of 3.66 atm pressure and separation time 45 minutes.
   Concentrates of leucaena seed had the functional properties of the water
   absorption capacity of 3.3 g water/g of solid, oil absorption capacity
   of 1.43 g of oil/g solid, Bulk density of 0.55 g/ml, power emulsion

Abstract = {The toxic aromatic compound 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (HP) is an intermediate

   (pydB) gene that produce enzymes necessary for the degradation of HP. In
   order to coordinately express both genes in plant tissues under a single

   with varying glycine linkers between the two genes were developed. Prior

   highly recalcitrant to genetic transformation, we tested the expression
   and activity of the hybrid proteins in Nicotiana tabacum, a model plant
   system that can be easily transformed and analyzed. Seven independent
   transgenic tobacco lines were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated
   transformation, and stable integration and expression of pydA-pydB in
   these transgenic lines were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western analysis. Only one
   of the fusion constructs, G3, containing a 9-nucleotide linker between
   pydA and pydB, provided significant levels of resistance to 3 mM HP,
   indicating that the hybrid protein produced by this fusion construct
   could degrade HP.},

Abstract = {To examine the apparent absence of toxicity in ruminants fed on L.
   leucocephala in Hawaii, USA, goats were offered comparable diets of
   Leucaena and lucerne chaff (control) in Australia and Hawaii over 7 wk.
   Intake of mimosine, excretion of the ruminal metabolite
   3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone (DHP) and serum concentrations of thyroxine
   (T4) were measured in both studies. Mean mimosine intakes on the highest
   Leucaena diets in Australia and Hawaii were similar at .apprx. 20 g/day.
   In Australia, goats on the all-Leucaena diets became hypothyroid after
   only 3 wk of feeding, thyroid glands were enlarged and erosion of the
   esophageal mucosa and reticulo-rumen occurred. Excretion of DHP in the
   urine was related to the daily mimosine intakes, with recoveries of
   .apprx. 86\%. Goats fed on Leucaena in Hawaii exhibited no clinical
   signs of toxicity and excreted < 1\% of the mimosine intake as DHP in
   the urine. No degradation of DHP occurred in vitro with rumen fluid from
   Australian goats; 71\% of the added DHP was degraded after 5 h with
   rumen fluid from goats in Hawaii. The differences observed were
   attributable to a different microbial metabolism of mimosine and DHP in
   ruminants in Hawaii.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted near Hyderabad, India during 1991-1994 to
   quantify the effects of shoot pruning, fertilization, and root barriers
   around Leucaena leucocephala trees on intercropped sorghum (Sorghum
   bicolor) or cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) crop production under rainfed
   conditions. Crop plants grown with pruned trees attained higher dry
   matter and leaf area index than did those with unpruned trees. Two-year
   mean grain yields of sorghum with no root barriers were 76\% and 39\% of
   pure crop yield (1553 kg ha(-1)) for pruned and unpruned trees,
   respectively. Corresponding values for cowpea were 49\% and 26\% of pure
   crop yield (1075 kg ha(-1)). Sorghum or cowpea intercropped with trees
   responded to fertilizer application more strongly than did their
   respective pure crops, suggesting an increased need for fertilizer
   application in this agrisilviculture system over that currently used for
   pure crops. Impact of root barriers was small on either crop.
   Irrespective of root barriers, a high response to tree pruning suggested
   above ground competition for light dominated tree/crop interactions in
   this agrisilviculture system.},

   detergent fibre. Total phenols, total tannins, and condensed tannins
   (CT) were consistently the highest in MIC. Gas production was the lowest
   from MIC (P < 0.05) and the highest in LEU and STA. MIC + PEG largely
   reduced (P < 0.05) the lag phase and the fractional rate of fermentation
   and increased potential GP. Kinetic parameters of STA + PEG and LEU +
   PEG were not affected. LEU + PEG produced greater gas increment (P <
   0.05) than STD + PEG, although both legumes had the same CT. All legumes
   except MIC were more extensively degraded than CYN. However,
   fermentation of the legumes was differently affected by the presence and
   proportions of CT, indigestible fibre or both.},

Abstract = {The use of agricultural practices such as fertilization and
   intercropping can improve the production of forage cacti. The objective
   of this study was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of forage
   cactus intercropped with leguminous trees and fertilized with different
   sources of manure in the tropical semiarid region of Brazil. The
   research was carried out at the Agricultural and Livestock Research
   Enterprise of Pernambuco State during the period from March 2011 to
   September 2013. The following cultivation systems were used: (i)
   Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth + forage cactus cv. IPA-Sertania
   {[}Opuntia cochenillifera (L.) Mill]; (ii) Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.)
   de Wit + forage cactus; and (iii) forage cactus in monoculture. All of
   these systems were fertilized with different sources of manure (cattle,
   goat, sheep, and broiler litter). The goat and sheep manure (16.6 and
   16.5 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1)) provided the least production of cactus in
   the different cropping systems. Cattle manure provided greater
   production of forage and wood from legumes (1.4 and 4.3 Mg DM ha(-1)
   year(-1)) and cactus (20.9 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1)). Gliricidia produced
   more forage and wood than Leucaena. Total production of the forage
   cactus-Gliricidia system produced 4.7 and 3.8 Mg DM ha(-1) of biomass
   and wood in two years, respectively. The production and morphological
   characteristics of the cactus increased at further distance from the
   trees (3 m), and the opposite effect was observed for the concentrations
   of N, p, and K. Thus, cropping systems using forage cactus and tree
   legumes fertilized with manure represent an option for tropical semiarid
   regions.},

Abstract = {An experiment was carried out in a slash-and-burn production system in
   northern Laos to evaluate legume establishment methods and effects of
   legume species on fallow vegetation, weeds, yield of upland rice, and
   soil parameters. Cajanus cajan, Calliandra calothyrsus, Crotalaria
   anagyroides, Flemingia congesta, Leucaena leucocephala, and Sesbania
   sesban were dibbled separately or mixed with rice. Legume and planting
   method had no effect on rice yield. Legume establishment was slightly
   improved and vigor after rice harvest was higher when planted in
   separate hills. Compared to control (no legume), the above ground fallow
   biomass observed 13 months after establishment, consisting mostly of
   Chromolaena odorata, was reduced by 68\% with C. anagyroides and by 40\%
   with L. leucocephala, while other species had no effect. Most of the C.
   cajan and S. sesban plants died. In March 1995, 22 months after
   planting, the biomass was 0.21, 0.25, 1.62 and 2.56 kg m(-2) for F.
   congesta, C. calothyrsus, C. anagyroides, and L. leucocephala,
   respectively. Legume species had no effect on rice yield or weed biomass
   in the rice crop. The species tested can influence fallow vegetation but
   do not allow for field preparation without burning. Compared to
   mulching, burning of residue reduced weed biomass by 42\%, soil organic
   C by 9\% and the C/N ratio by 6\% but increased extractable P by 90\%
   and pH by 8\%.},

Abstract = {Currently, biomedical, food, and pharmaceutical industries are exploring
   biocompatible, biodegradable, and readily available polymers as an
   alternative to synthetic polymers. The naturally occurring
   galactomannans comprising of galactopyranosyl (Gal) and mannopyranosyl
   (Man) residues are an attractive alternative to synthetic polymers due
   to their wide availability, and easily maniputable physical, and
   chemical properties. In the present study, a natural polymer, Leucaenea
   leucocephala galactomannan (LLG) was extracted from the seeds of
   Leucaenea leucocephala by an aqueous method, derivatized by reductive
   amination process using ethylene diamine as aminating agent to form
   aminated LLG (AMLLG). The conditions for amination were optimized by
   varying the concentration of aminating agent, temperature of the
   reaction mixture and time of reaction and their effect on degree of
   substitution was determined. The derivatized galactomannan was
   characterized by FTIR, DSC, XRD, SEM and zeta potential analysis. The
   texture properties (firmness, consistency, and cohesiveness) and
   bioadhesive strength of AMLLG was also determined. Furthermore, the
   antimicrobial potential of AMLLG was evaluated against Escherichia coli
   and Staphylococcus aureus suggesting better antibacterial activity of
   AMLLG than chitosan (standard). Overall, the study highlights that the
   amine derivative of LLG could be a promising candidate as preservative
   in food industry and as a drug delivery vehicle in pharmaceutical
   industry.},

Journal = {FUEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {320},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Fossil coal can be replaced with renewable charcoal to reduce CO2
   emissions from ironmaking processes. Charcoals produced from three
   hardwood species, Acacia nilotica (W1), Albizia lebbeck (W2) and
   Leucaena leucocephala (W3), were evaluated as a reductant in ironmaking.
   Charcoals were produced with slow (5 \& DEG;C/min) and fast heating
   rates (50 ?/min) at 600, 800 and 1100 \& DEG;C. Charcoals were
   characterized using proximate, ultimate analysis, volume shrinkage,
   compressive loading, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy for their chemical,
   mechanical and physical properties. It was found that among the selected
   biomass species, fixed and total carbon content is higher in W1 (83-97;
   84-91\%) and W2 (83-96; 86-92\%) than W3 (76-89; 78-84\%) and increases
   with increase in carbonization temperature and heating rate. Charcoal
   yield in W1 (22-28\%), W2 (22-26\%) and W3 (23-28\%) decreases with an
   increase in carbonization temperature and heating rate. Charcoals
   produced at various carbonization conditions have at most 10\% ash
   content. Values from different tests indicate that W2 and W3 charcoal
   are potentially better reductant than W1.},

Abstract = {Variation in the nutritive value of three common pasture grasses:
   Brachiaria ruziziensis, Penniseturn purpureurn, Trypsacu or laxurn and
   leaves of two leguminous trees: Leucaena leucocephala and Calliandra
   calothyrsus, were determined throughout a calendar year. Sampling at
   each foliage was completed monthly between November 2001 and October
   2002 followed by analysis for their chemical components. The crude
   protein (CP) level in the tree leaves was higher than that in the
   grasses throughout the year while the reverse was true for NDFom and
   ADFom. There was an increase in the CP level during the rainy season for
   all forages, and this increase was higher (P < 0.01) in B. ruziziensis,
   P. purpureum, L. leucocephala and C. calothyrsus (P < 0.05),
   respectively, relative to the dry season samples. Lipid levels were
   higher (P < 0.05) in B. ruziziensis and C. calothyrsus during the rainy
   season. Sulfuric acid lignin (sa) was higher (P < 0.01) in B.
   ruziziensis and L leucocephala during the dry season. Brachiaria had the
   highest level of P irrespective of season. Seasonal variations in the
   levels of the nutrients in these foliages suggest that, throughout the
   year, different amounts of leguminous tree leaves would be needed to
   supplement diets of ruminants whose main feed comes from grazing natural
   pastures, as is the case in the Central African region. This will help
   to ameliorate the overall productive and reproductive performance of
   ruminants in the region. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   day onwards. Similarly, excretion of mimosine, 3,4-DHP and 2,3-DHP were
   observed even after withdrawal of leucaena from the diet. The feeding of
   LLM resulted in a reduced level of T-3 (Triiodothyronine) and T-4
   (Thyroxine) within a week of LLM feeding. The level of T3 and T4
   improved to normal after withdrawal of LLM from the diet. The serum
   aspartate transferase (AST) and serum alanine transferase (ALT)
   activities were within the normal range. Leucaena feeding improved milk
   yield and composition only up to 3 weeks of feeding. The concentration
   of mimosine, 3,4-DHP and 2,3-DHP in milk was 0 center dot 33, 0 center
   dot 05 and 0 center dot 02 that of blood, respectively. The secretion of
   mimosine, 3,4-DHP and 2,3-DHP in the milk might be a concern for health
   of the offspring of leucaena-fed animals as well as human beings
   consuming such milk..},

Abstract = {This research was carried out with the objective to evaluate the effect
   of including the biological product VITAFERT (R) (VTF), as microbial
   additives in the cattle fattened in silvopastoral system with Leucaena
   leucocephala supplemented with 6 g MS. kg PV-1 of sugar cane. Fifteen
   animals Zebu cross by trial were used during 165 days of rainy period.
   The treatments were: 1) grazing ad libitum + sugar cane, 2) grazing ad
   libitum + sugar cane + 6 mL. kg PV-1 VTF and 3) grazing ad libitum +
   sugar cane + 9 mL. kg PV-1 VTF. A random regression models were applied
   starting from a PROC MIXED, a trial were included as fixed effect and
   the animal nested inside treatment as aleatory effect and the residual
   error. Growth models of weight x age were used. Several indicators of
   the productive performance were determined. There were difference (P>
   0.001) for the daily half gain (GMD) in the treatments with inclusion of
   the VTF regarding the control. Also, there was difference (P> 0.001) in
   the increment of live (IP) and the hectare yield in the treatments where
   VTF was given with relationship to the control. The non-lineal model
   (Logistic) showed adequate adjusted for the first and second treatment.
   However, the lineal model presented appropriate adjusted in the third
   treatment. It is concludes that the use of the VTF as microbial
   additives in the fattened of beef cattle in silvopastoral systems with
   leucaena, complemented with sugar cane generated a productive effect
   contrasting on the GMD, the IP and the hectare yield in the treatments
   where VTF was given.},

   in an alley cropping system on the incidence and severity of rust
   (Uromyces appendiculatus (Pers.) Unger) on intercropped beans (Phaseolus

   at Chepkoilel Campus in Kenya. Each experiment consisted of three
   randomized blocks with treatments of three alley widths (2 m, 4 m and 8
   m) and a treeless control with two intra-row spacings of Leucaena (0.5 m
   and 1.0 m). Hedgerows were coppiced at 1.0 m height and pruned
   subsequently at 2-3 months intervals. No fertilizer was applied but
   Leucaena loppings were incorporated as green leaf manure. Rust on beans
   was assessed at three growth stages in each season, using the Centro
   International de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) scales. Microclimate was
   monitored in treatments, in 1994. Bean growth and yield were also
   measured. Rust increased with increasing alley width and was less severe
   in bean rows adjacent to hedgerows. Bean yield was highest in the
   treeless control plots and declined with decreasing alley width. Beans
   in 2 m alleys had significantly lower (p < 0.05) yields than 8 m alleys
   and treeless control plots. Bean growth was greatly modified in 2 m
   alleys and close to hedgerows. Light availability and diurnal
   temperature increased with alley width but relative humidity and leaf
   wetness duration decreased. Proximity to hedgerows also had marked
   effect on microclimate. The changes in yield, rust incidence and
   severity were examined in relation to microclimate, inoculum survival
   and dispersal.},

Abstract = {Availability of water, soil conditions and recurring disturbances are
   the main factors that limit plant establishment in disturbed sites in
   tropical dry forests. The objective of this study was to assess the
   effect of applying compost and of plastic mulch on survival and initial
   plant growth of the woody species Dodonaea viscosa, Leucaena
   leucocephala and Lysiloma divaricatum, in a degraded pasture in
   northwestern Morelos. In 2009, 121-124 plants of each species were
   planted; 500 mL of compost, made from cattle manure, grass and tomato
   plant residues, and later, a plastic mulch (40 x 40 cm square) were
   applied to plants of each species selected at random. The following
   treatments were obtained: 1) compost, 2) plastic mulch, 3) compost and
   mulch, and 4) control (without compost or mulch). Survival and growth
   were recorded bi-monthly for one year. Survival was analyzed with a
   generalized linear model, and analyses of variance were performed for
   growth variables. The species with the highest survival rate was L.
   divaricatum (61 \%) and that with the lowest was D. viscosa (8 \%).
   Plastic mulch increased survival by 17 \% to 31 \%, depending on the
   species. Addition of compost had a significant effect (p <= 0.05) only
   on growth in diameter of L. leucocephala. Use of plastic mulch increased
   restoration success and can be used in other sites where soil
   characteristics and water stress limit establishment of woody species.},

Abstract = {The development of new, safe, and effective methods of managing fungal
   pathogens is required. This study was conducted to perform an initial in
   vitro assessment of the antifungal activity of water-based plant
   extracts from three plants which are invasive in Egypt: Prosopis
   juliflora, Ipomoea carnea, and Leucaena leucocephala. These extracts
   were tested against three pathogenic fungi species that cause high crop
   losses in Egypt: Fusarium solani, Alternaria solani, and Colletotrichum
   circinans. Three extract concentrations, 10\%, 20\%, and 30\%, were
   tested using a completely randomized design, with three replicates per
   treatment. Antifungal activity was determined based on the effects of
   plant extracts on fungal radial growth inhibition, average daily growth
   of fungi, spore formation, spore germination, and total biomass.
   Inhibition of the growth of fungal strains increased with increasing
   plant extract concentration, with the highest inhibitory rate at the
   30\% extract concentration. In addition, spore density, spore
   germination, and total biomass decreased significantly with increasing
   extract concentration. The three fungal pathogens differed in their
   inhibition and their response to these plant extracts. Prosopis
   juliflora had the highest inhibitory effect on the three fungal
   pathogens, compared to the extracts from the other two invasive plants.
   The results of this feasibility study indicate that P. juliflora
   extracts have high antifungal activity and follow-up in vivo assays
   should be conducted to determine their efficacy in the safe and
   sustainable management of these and other fungal pathogens.},

   this work, six non-wood materials (Leucaena leucocephala, tagasaste,
   rice straw, Paulownia fortunei, Hesperaloe funifera and empty fruit
   bunches) were tested and compared to Eucalyptus globulus for paper
   production under Kraft conditions. All the raw materials were chemically
   characterized to determine holocellulose, cellulose, Klason lignin, ash,
   hot water solubles, 1\% soda solubles and ethanol-benzene extractives.
   In addition, a biometric test was performed to determine the length and
   the width of the fibres. The cellulosic pulps obtained from the raw
   materials were characterized to determine their yield, viscosity, Kappa
   number and drainage index. As regards the paper sheets made from the
   cellulosic pulps, they were characterized to determine brightness,
   stretch and tear index. A comparison of the results suggests that these

Abstract = {Soil moisture changes and maize yield were studied in 2-year-old alleys
   of Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia macrophylla at Chalimbana,
   Zambia. Field tensiometers were installed at 15, 30 and 45 cm depth, in
   fertilized and unfertilized alleys within the double hedgerows, and the
   first, second and third rows of maize, and were monitored throughout one
   maize growing season in 1989/1990.
   In general, maize growth (indicated by height and dry matter measured at
   roughly fortnightly internal) was higher (P < 0.01) in fertilized alleys
   than in unfertilized alleys, and there were no differences between
   Leucaena and Flemingia alleys. In both fertilized and unfertilized
   alleys, the maize plants were 20\% shorter (P < 0.01) in the first row
   (nearer the hedgerows) than in the second and third maize rows. Maize
   dry matter yield was 30\% more (P < 0.01) in unfertilized Flemingia
   alleys than in corresponding Leucaena alleys. The grain yield was
   similar in the fertilized alleys of Leucaena and Flemingia. However, in
   unfertilized alleys, the grain yield in Flemingia alleys was 50\% more
   than that of the corresponding Leucaena alleys. The fertilized alleys
   produced twice as much grain as unfertilized alleys when hedgerow
   prunings were added to the plots. The prunings as a source of nutrient
   did not appear to have any noticeable effect on crop productivity.
   The soil moisture content under both Leucaena and Flemingia hedgerows
   was higher than under the maize rows in the alleys throughout the
   growing season.
   The study shows that, under conditions of low fertility and no addition
   of fertilizers, Leucaena is twice as competitive, as Flemingia for soil
   resources, and reduces yield of alley-cropped maize from 2.2 t ha-1 to
   0.7 t ha-1. If, however, fertilizer is added, there are no short-term
   differences between the two hedgerow species.},

Abstract = {Different levels of purified condensed tannins (CT) extracted from
   Leucaena leucocephala hybrid-Rendang (LLR) were investigated for their
   effects on CH4 production, rumen fermentation parameters such as pH, dry
   matter (DM) degradability, N disappearance and volatile fatty acid (VFA)
   concentrations, as well as on populations of rumen methanogenic archaea
   and protozoa in vitro. Purified CT concentrations of 0 (control). 10,
   15, 20, 25 and 30 mg, and 500 mg of oven dried guinea grass (Panicum
   maximum) with 40 ml of buffered rumen fluid were incubated for 24 h
   using an in vitro gas production procedure. Total gas (ml/g DM)
   decreased at a decreasing rate (linear P < 0.01; quadratic P < 0.05)
   with increased levels of CT inclusion. CH4 production (ml/g DM)
   decreased at a decreasing rate (linear P < 0.01; quadratic P < 0.01)
   with increasing levels of CT. Total VFA concentration (mmol/L) decreased
   at a decreasing rate (linear P < 0.01: quadratic P < 0.01) with
   increasing CT inclusions. In vitro DM degradation and N disappearance
   declined linearly (P < 0.01) with increasing levels of CT. Estimates of
   rumen methanogenic archaea and protozoa populations using
   microbiological methods and real-time PCR assay showed linear reductions
   in total methanogens (P < 0.01) and total protozoa (P < 0.01) with
   increasing levels of CT. Methanogens in the order Methattobacteriales
   also declined, but with quadratic and cubic aspects. Results suggest
   that CT from LLR at a relatively low level of 15 mg of CT/500 mg DM
   reduce CH4 production by 47\%, with only 7\% reduction in degradation of
   feed DM. However, higher CT inclusions, while further reducing CH4
   emissions, have substantive negative effects on DM digestibility. (C)

   artificial infection of kids withH. contortusled to infection levels
   comparable to those observed in the farm environment on the basis of egg
   excretion. The anthelmintic activity ofLeucaena, compared to alfalfa,
   was demonstrated by its potential to reduce egg excretions (1524 vs.
   3651 eggs/g) and the larval development of excreted eggs (3.5 vs. 24\%).
   This anthelmintic potential was reported when the ratio
   ofLeucaenaincorporation in the diet was high (50\% DM intake). The
   voluntary dry matter intake (79.3 vs. 77.0 g Large Weigth(0.75)), the
   total tract dry matter digestion (0.585 vs. 0.620), and the growth (57.1
   vs. 71.3 g/d) of kids fedLeucaenacompared to alfalfa indicate
   thatLeucaenahas a high feed value. TheLeucaena, even at the highest
   intakes in the diets, has not shown any signs of poisoning in kids.
   Conclusions Leucaenafulfilled the conditions to be a good nutraceutical,
   and pelleting is a good method for its use.},

Abstract = {Effects of changes in temperature around roots on water uptake by roots
   and leaf transpiration were studied in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit., a subtropical woody plant species, and in Zea mays L. When the
   temperature around roots was rapidly lowered from 25 degrees C to 15
   degrees C, the water uptake by the roots and leaf transpiration were
   stimulated significantly within a short period (14 min). However, this
   effect did not occur when the cooling time was prolonged neither did if
   occur when the temperature around the roots was resumed from 15 degrees
   C to 25 degrees C. Both the hydraulic conductivity of roots and leaf
   transpiration were increased substantially at first (within 20 min) and
   then decreased steadily to a level lower than those of the control in
   which the roots were continuous exposed to a low temperature (15 degrees
   C). Low temperature also promoted the biosynthesis of ABA in roots and
   enhanced the xylem ABA concentration, but such stimulation did not occur
   untill about 30 min after cooling treatment. Leaf transpiration was
   reduced markedly, but the hydraulic conductivity of roots increased when
   the mot system was treated with exogenous ABA. It was suggested that
   some mechanisms other than ABA may be involved in the short-time
   cryo-stimulation of water uptake by roots and leaf transpiration.},

Volume = {226},

Abstract = {Prosopis juliflora and Leucaena leucocephala are notable examples of
   invasive woody plants that can spread throughout similar habitats in
   India. However, little is known about how these two species may interact
   with one another if future rainfall pattern shifts, which is
   particularly concerning. Recognizing the pivotal role of
   eco-physiological parameters in deciphering the dynamics of
   interspecific competition, a study was devised to elucidate the
   interplay between L. leucocephala and P. juliflora under simulated
   rainfall conditions. At Botanical Garden, Banaras Hindu University,
   Varanasi, UP, India, three fixed rainout shelter plots were established,
   each receiving distinct precipitation levels: low rainfall (LR), normal
   rainfall (NR), and high rainfall (HR). Within each plot, three replicate
   subplots were dedicated to pure stands of L. leucocephala (L), pure
   stands of P. juliflora (P), and mixed stands of the two species (LP).
   The findings of the study underscore significant variations in soil
   Inorganic N, N-mineralization, based on precipitation levels, with
   maximum values observed in HR plot and L. Similarly, biomass,
   photosynthetic rate, and transpiration rate exhibited significant
   variability in response to precipitation treatment, reaching their
   highest values in HR plot and L. Conversely, root length, root-shoot
   ratio, and water use efficiency peaked in LR plot and P, presenting a
   contrasting trend. This study suggests that L. leucocephala may
   facilitate the growth of P. juliflora by improving the soil's nitrogen
   availability and, consequently, the eco-physiological characteristics of
   the plant in mixed plant stands. Furthermore, L. leucocephala is
   providing P. juliflora with favourable conditions for robust growth
   under water stress-a scenario indicative of Facilitative approach.},

Abstract = {The Leucaena leucocephala trypsin inhibitor (LTI) + Bacillus
   thuringiensis (Bt) protoxins mix has been proposed as a novel larvicide
   agent in order to control the vector mosquito of dengue virus, Aedes
   aegypti, in their aquatic breeding sites. However, use of this
   insecticide formulation has raised concerns about its impacts on aquatic
   biota. In this context, this work aimed to assess the effects of LTI and
   Bt protoxins, separately or in combination, in zebrafish, in regard to
   the evaluation of toxicity at early life stages and to the presence of
   LTI inhibitory effects on intestinal proteases of this fish. Results
   showed that LTI and Bt concentrations (250 mg/L, and 0.13 mg/L,
   respectively), and LTI + Bt mix (250 mg/L + 0.13 mg/L) -10 times
   superior to those with insecticidal action - did not cause death nor did
   it induce morphological changes during embryonic and larval development
   (3 to 144 h post-fertilization) of zebrafish. Molecular docking analyses
   highlighted a possible interaction between LTI and zebrafish trypsin,
   especially through hydrophobic interactions. In concentrations near to
   those with larvicidal action, LTI (0.1 mg/mL) was able to inhibit in
   vitro intestinal extracts of trypsin in female and male fish by 83 \%
   and 85 \%, respectively, while LTI + Bt mix promoted trypsin inhibition
   of 69 \% in female and 65 \% in male ones. These data show that the
   larvicidal mix can potentially promote deleterious effects to nutrition
   and survival in non-target aquatic organisms, especially those with
   trypsin-like dependent protein digestion.},

Abstract = {The functioning of trees as a safety-net for capturing nutrients leached
   beyond the reach of crop roots was evaluated by investigating changes in
   exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, and K) and pH in a wide range of medium to
   long term alley cropping trials in the derived savanna of West Africa,
   compared to no-tree control plots. Topsoil Ca content, effective cation
   exchange capacity, and pH were substantially higher under Senna siamea
   than under Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, or the no-tree
   control plots in sites with a Bt horizon rich in exchangeable Ca. This
   was shown to be largely related to the recovery of Ca from the subsoil
   under Senna trees. The increase of the Ca content of the topsoil under
   Senna relative to the no-tree control treatment was related to the total
   amount of dry matter applied since trial establishment. The lack of
   increase in Ca accumulation under the other species was related to
   potential recovery of Ca from the topsoil itself and/or substantial Ca
   leaching. The accumulation of Ca in the topsoil under Senna had a marked
   effect on the topsoil pH, the latter increasing significantly compared
   with the Leucaena, Gliridia, and no-tree control treatments. In
   conclusion, the current work shows that the functioning of the often
   hypothesized `safety-net' of trees in a cropping system depends on (i)
   the tree species and on (ii) the presence of a subsoil of suitable
   quality, i.e., clay enriched and with high Ca saturation.},

Abstract = {The influence of simulated erosion on the abundance and activity of
   indigenous rhizobia was evaluated in an oxisol.  Surface soil losses in
   excess of 15 cm were generally associated with significant decrease in
   the numbers of rhizobia nodulating Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania
   grandiflora, and Vigna unguiculata.  Simulated erosion hampered
   nodulation, nitrogenase activity (but not specific nitrogenase
   activity), and dry matter accumulation even at imposed erosion levels
   that were not detrimental to rhizobial populations.  The adverse effect
   of simulated erosion on the rhizobium-legume symbiosis, therefore, was
   not completely explainable in terms of loss of rhizobia.  Total nutrient
   uptake values declined with increase in simulated erosion levels, and
   these values were better indicators of the impacts of simulated erosion
   on legume performance than tissue nutrient concentration values.  We
   conclude that establishment of effective rhizobium-legume symbiosis on
   highly weathered eroded soils would require not only re-infestation of
   the soils with appropriate rhizobia, but also replenishing them with
   lost nutrients that are critical for the formation and function of
   effective symbiosis.},

Abstract = {A maize-leucaena alley cropping system was studied on a N-deficient
   sandy Apomu soil series (Psammentic Usthorthent) at Ibadan in the forest
   zone of southern Nigeria from 1976 to 1980. In this system maize was
   grown in 4 m width alleys between leucaena hedgerows. Five to six annual
   prunings of the leucaena hedgerows yielded between 5-8 tons of dry
   tops/ha per year with N-yield of between 180 to 250 kg N/ha per year.
   Though efficiency of N utilization from leucaena prunings was low, the
   maize-leucaena alley cropping system can be utilized as a low N-input
   system. Addition of leucaena prunings from the full-grown hedgerows was
   able to sustain maize grain yield at .apprx. 3.8 tons/ha per year for 2
   consecutive years with no N addition, while with no addition of
   prunings, yield declined. Higher maize grain yields were obtained with
   supplementation with low N rates of 20 to 80 kg N/ha depending on
   variety and season. The maize-leucaena alley cropping system also has
   the potential for being developed as a stable alternative for the
   traditional bush fallow system. Leucaena plants, which have unique
   properties suitable for growing in alley cropping, still retain
   important functions of a traditional bush fallow: for nutrient
   recycling, source of green manure, firewood and staking material.

   measured. Growth and efficiency of food utilization were similar in
   groups fed on a control soybean meal diet or a basal diet containing 150
   g kg-1 of the whole leaf (WL) form of LLM. Supplementation of this basal
   LLM diet with FeSO4 or Al2(SO4)3 had little effect on growth or
   efficiency of food utilization, but the ratio of mimosine output to
   mimosine ingested (MO/MI) increased from 0.781-0.881 and 1.003 on
   addition of FeSO4 and Al2(SO4)3, respectively. Growth performance was
   unaffected by the addition of an enzyme mixture (containing cellulase,
   acid and neutral proteases and alpha amylase) to the basal LLM diet. In
   the 2nd experiment, 2 other forms of LLM were also tested: a ground leaf
   (GL) form, and a powder produced by grinding pellets of Leucaena leaf
   (GP). The WL and GP forms were each added at 50 and 100 g kg-1 diet and
   the GL form at 100 g kg-1 diet. These diets permitted daily intakes of
   mimosine ranging from 80-350 mg/replicate of 4 chicks. In comparison
   with control groups, growth performance was not impaired significantly

Abstract = {Synthetic dyes are persistent organic environmental pollutants that can
   cause extensive damage to living beings and to the ecosystem as a whole.
   Cost-effective, sustainable, and efficient strategies to deal with this
   type of pollution are necessary as it commonly resists conventional
   water treatment methods. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using
   the aqueous extract from the leaves, stem, and fruits of Leucaena
   leucocephala (Leucena) were produced and characterized through UV-vis,
   TEM, EDS, SDL, XPS, XRD, and zeta potential, and they proved to be able
   to promote adsorption to remediate methylene blue and tartrazine
   pollution in water. The nanoremediation was performed and did not
   require direct exposure to sunlight or any special lamp or a specific
   reduction agent. The AgNPs produced using the extract from the leaves
   exhibited the best performance in nanoremediation and also presented
   antioxidant activity that surpassed the one from butylated
   hydroxytoluene (BHT). Consequently, it is an interesting nanotool to use
   in dye nanoremediation and/or as an antioxidant nanostructure.},

Title = {How do roots control xylem sap ABA concentration in response to soil
   drying?},
Journal = {PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-16},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) and Leucaena leucocephala (a tropical tree) were
   subjected to different degrees of soil drying and changes in their root
   and xylem ABA concentrations were measured simultaneously. Additional
   treatments such as defoliation, light sheltering and stem girdling were
   applied so that phloem transport into roots was manipulated. When soil
   was dried, ABA concentration in xylem sap increased almost linearly with
   that of roots in both species. Such an increase was relatively plateaued
   at high root ABA concentrations, suggesting that severe soil drying
   might have hindered some parts of roots from delivering ABA into xylem
   flow. When H-3-ABA was loaded into roots and monitored for its
   disappearance, it was found that the capability of roots to catabolize
   ABA was much lower than that reported for leaves, with a half-life of
   1.15 h and a considerable amount (46\%) of fed H-3-ABA was remained
   unmodified during 21 h of incubation. Previous soil drying significantly
   reduced such a capability of catabolism and extended the half-life of
   fed H-3-ABA to 2.27 h, and the amount remaining unmodified was elevated
   to 50.7\%. Defoliation and light-sheltering treatments significantly
   reduced xylem ABA concentration of water-stressed plants. Using stem
   girdling approach, it was estimated that about 25 to 30\% of ABA in the
   xylem sap might come from shoot through phloem under soil drying
   condition. It was concluded that in addition to an enhanced ABA
   biosynthesis in roots during soil drying, a slowed ABA catabolism in
   roots and an increased import from shoots were also important
   contributions to the sensitive changes of xylem ABA concentration in
   response to such a stress.},

Abstract = {The effects of inter-row spacing of Leucaena leucocephala in an alley
   cropping system on the incidence and severity of diseases on
   intercropped beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and their yield were examined
   over two years (1993 and 1994) at Chepkoilel Campus in Kenya. Each
   experiment consisted of three randomized blocks with treatments of three
   alley widths (2 m, 4 m and 8 m) and a treeless control with two
   intra-row spacings of Leucaena (0.5 m and 1.0 m). Hedgerows were
   coppiced at 1.0 m height and pruned subsequently at two-to-three months
   intervals. No fertilizer was applied but Leucaena loppings were
   incorporated as green leaf manure. Incidence of angular leaf spot
   (Phaeoisariopsis griseola) and anthracnose (Colletotrichum
   lindemuthianum) on beans were assessed at three growth stages in each
   season, using the Centro International de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT)
   scales. Microclimate was monitored in treatments, in 1994. Angular leaf
   spot and anthracnose decreased with increasing alley width and were more
   severe in bean rows adjacent to hedgerows. Light availability and
   diurnal temperaturereaching the bean canopy increased with alley width
   but relative humidity and leaf wetness duration decreased. Proximity to
   hedgerows also had markedly reduced light levels, lower temperatures and
   higher relative humidity. Higher incidence and severity of angular leaf
   spot and anthracnose on beans in alleys than on beans in treeless plots
   were examined in relation to microclimate, inoculum survival and
   dispersal. The pattern of the diseases was best explained by
   microclimate changes induced by Leucaena hedgerows, especially effects
   of humidity.},

Abstract = {The Fitzroy Basin in central Queensland has the largest cattle herd of
   any natural resource management region in Australia, and legumes have
   been widely used to boost fertility of rundown soil and improve cattle
   liveweight gains. However, there is a paucity of information on the
   effect of leguminous pastures on hydrology and water quality. This study
   investigated runoff water quality over eight hydrological years from
   virgin brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) woodland and three improved
   pastures, namely, buffel grass (Pennisetum ciliare), butterfly pea
   (Clitoria ternatea) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). Runoff event
   mean concentrations and loads of total and dissolved nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and carbon in addition to total suspended solids are
   reported. Brigalow woodland had the greatest loss of sediment and
   nitrogen attributed to the inherently fertile Vertosols (clay soil), but
   the low occurrence and amount of runoff meant that it had a low risk to
   water quality. Despite a similar number of runoff events from the
   improved pastures, leucaena pasture had less total runoff and a lower
   maximum peak runoff rate in addition to lower nitrogen and carbon in
   runoff. Total suspended solids and carbon in runoff were greater from
   grass pasture than from the leguminous pastures, whereas nitrogen and
   phosphorus were greatest from the butterfly pea pasture, especially in
   the first 2 years post-planting. Greater exports of phosphorus from the
   improved pastures were concerning, given the potential for downstream
   impacts.},

   vitro, as determined by high-throughput sequencing},
Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {216},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {It has been suggested that condensed tannin (CT) fractions of different
   molecular weights (MWs) affect the level of methane (CH4) production in
   ruminant by altering the ruminal methanogenic diversity. In this study,
   the effects of unfractionated CTs (F0) and five CT fractions (F1-F5) of
   different MWs from Leucaena leucocephala hybrid-Rendang (LLR) on the
   population and diversity of rumen methanogenic archaea in vitro were
   investigated using real-time PCR and high throughput sequencing.
   Real-time PCR analysis showed that higher-MW CT fractions (fractions F1
   and F2) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased more total methanogens and
   methanogens from the order Methanobacteriales than the control (without
   CTs), unfractionated CTs F0 and lower-MW CT fractions (fractions F3-F5).
   Population of methanogens from the order Methanomicrobiales was not
   significantly (P > 0.05) different among all CT fractions and the
   control. Amplification of archaeal 16S RNA genes (targeting the V3
   region) of seven samples (obtained from in vitro gas production test)
   using Illumina Miseq sequencer, recovered 642,244 sequences (mean of
   91,763 sequences per sample) which consisted of a number of OTUs ranging
   from 91 to 155 and were assigned to 12 genera. Bioinformatic analysis
   illustrated that the natural rumen archaeal community of a cattle
   (without supplementation of CTs) was predominated by an unclassified
   genus, VadinCA11 gut group which is Thermoplasmata-associated (56.3\% of
   the total sequence reads), followed by Methanobrevibacter (25.1\%) and
   Methanomicrobium (15.3\%), while the remaining genera were below 1\% of
   relative abundance. Relative abundance of the unclassified
   Thermoplasmata-associated group (VadinCA11 gut group) increased
   significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing MWs of the CT fractions,
   whereas the predominant methanogen genus Methanobrevibacter was
   significantly (P<0.05) decreased. Condensed tannin fraction F4, but not
   the other CT fractions, significantly (P < 0.05) increased the second
   predominant methongen genus Methanomicrobium. Condensed tannin fractions
   of different MWs from LLR could alter the size of populations and
   diversity of rumen methanogenic archaea in vitro, which could contribute
   to the reduction of CH4 production, and the impact was more pronounced
   for CT fractions with higher-MWs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {An investigation of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and

   in one taxon and absent from the other) were always present in the
   Leucaena hybrid and assumed to be of nuclear origin, whilst three RAPD
   markers showed expression patterns identical to the cpDNA markers and
   were assumed to be of organellar origin. No RAPD or PCR-RFLP
   taxon-diagnostic markers were discovered for either P. aculeata or C.
   praecox. However, 21 RAPD markers were species-specific (polymorphic
   within one taxon but absent from the other) and Southern analysis
   indicated that none of the markers were of organellar origin. Only 67\%
   additivity of markers specific to P. aculeata and C. praecox was
   demonstrated in the hybrids between these two species, whilst in
   Leucaena 97\% additivity was demonstrated. Differences between the two
   hybridising situations were related to the behaviour of the molecular
   markers and the biology of the species.},

Abstract = {The enzymatic hydrolysis of lead tree seed protein with alcalase to
   obtain Lead Tree Seed Hydrosylate (LTSH) was optimized using response
   surface methodology (RSM). A three-tiered, factor face centered, central
   composite design (CCD) was used to study the influence of four
   independent variables namely: pH (7-9); hydrolysis temperature (50
   degrees C, 55 degrees C, 60 degrees C); hydrolysis time (30 min, 60 min,
   90 min); and enzyme/substrate (1\%, 2\%, 3\%) ratio on both yield and
   antioxidant activity. The CCD consisted of twenty-four experimental
   points and six replicates of central points. All data were analyzed
   using Design-Expert Software. The optimum conditions obtained from
   experiments were a pH of 9; an enzyme to substrate ratio of 2\%; a
   hydrolysis time of 90 min; and a temperature of 55 degrees C. Results
   showed that LTSH derived from optimized hydrolysis exhibited effective
   ferrous ion chelating activity (92.79\%) and strong reducing power
   (A(700) = 3.82) at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. LTSH also demonstrated
   high DPPH radical scavenging activity (76.21\%; IC50 1.99 mg/ml), as
   well as hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (66.72\%; IC50 2.45 mg/ml).
   Superoxide anion scavenging activity was 55.71\% (IC50 3.89 mg/ml) at 20
   mg/ml. These results suggest that LTSH has potential as a natural
   antioxidant of functional food and for use in food processing. (c) All

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the growth, production, and leaf contents
   of macronutrients, as well as the yield of forage sorghum cultivated on
   the alleys of Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp.) and
   Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) in the presence and
   absence of mineral fertilization. The experiment was conducted in two
   different periods: During the 2016/2017 double crop (cultivation carried
   out at the end of the crop cycle) and during the 2017/2018 crop
   (cultivation carried out at the beginning of the crop cycle). A
   randomized block design, in which the first factor refers to cultivation
   systems (single sorghum, sorghum cultivated in Gliricidia alleys, and
   sorghum cultivated in Leucaena alleys) and the second factor refers to
   mineral fertilization (presence and absence of fertilization), in a 3 x
   2 factorial arrangement was used. The leguminous plants were cut, and
   the residues were deposited in the alleys. The cultivation in alleys
   without mineral fertilization increased total forage biomass when
   compared to the single crop cultivation. Cultivation in Leucaena alleys
   showed a higher leaf content of nitrogen (N) when compared to the single
   crop, both in the presence and absence of mineral fertilization. In the
   double crop, sorghum cultivated in Leucaena alleys without fertilization
   presented a higher forage yield (up to 67\%) when compared to the single
   crop system. However, there was no difference in yield when mineral
   fertilization was applied to the treatments. Overall, the alley crops
   were able to increase the morphological (plant height (PH), stem
   diameter (SD), panicle diameter (PD), and panicle length (PL) and yield
   (leaf dry mass (LDM), stem dry mass (SDM), total green mass (TGM), and
   total dry mass TDM) variables of the crop, improving the productivity of
   forage sorghum.},

Abstract = {Both cDNA including 5'UTR and 3'UTR and genomic clones of cinnamyl
   alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) were isolated and characterized from a
   pulp-yielding leguminous tree Leucaena leucocephala (LlCAD1). The
   deduced amino acid sequence shared high identity with orthologous
   sequences of Acacia mangium x Acacia auriculiformis (83\%), Medicago
   sativa (83\%), Nicotiana tabaccum (83\%) and Aralia cordata (81\%). Full
   length cDNA contained 78 bases of 5'UTR and 283 bases of 3'UTR, while
   the genomic clone contained 5 exons and 4 introns. Western blot analysis
   revealed elevated expression of LlCAD1 in seedling roots and shoots
   compared to leaves. Sense and antisense CAD tobacco transgenics showed
   increased and reduced CAD activity accompanied by a change in monomeric
   lignin composition. Histochemical staining of lignin in down-regulated
   plants suggested an increase in aldehyde units and a decrease in S/G
   ratio. Down-regulation of CAD resulted in accumulation of syringic,
   ferulic, p-coumaric and sinapic acids compared to untransformed
   controls. These observations were validated by anatomical studies of
   down-regulated transgenic stems which showed thin walled, elongated
   phloem and xylem fibres, accompanied by a reduction in the density of
   vessel elements and amount of secondary xylem when compared to
   untransformed plants. Furthermore, Klason lignin analysis of CAD
   antisense transgenics showed 7-32\% reduced lignin and normal phenotype
   as compared to untransformed plants. Such a reduction was not noticed in
   up-regulated transgenics. These results demonstrate a unique opportunity
   to explore the significant role that down-regulation of CAD gene plays
   in reducing lignin content thereby offering potential benefits to the
   pulp and paper industry.},

Abstract = {The competitiveness of wild-type strains of Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena) and

   experiments in the greenhouse, Antibiotic resistance markers were
   selected for use in strain identification, but these genetic markers
   apparently lowered both competitiveness and effectiveness, except in the
   case of strain DS 144/2 where the genetically marked derivative was
   evidently superior to the wild-type parent strain in effectiveness. Four
   wild-type strains and their genetically marked derivatives were
   carefully evaluated using double reciprocal pairs, the results of which
   nevertheless allowed the formulation of some conclusions. Strains DS 65
   and DS 78 were more competitive than strain DS 144/2; only strain DS 78
   was more competitive than DS 158; and strains DS 158 and DS 65 were
   equally competitive, There was no correlation between nodule number and
   competitiveness. Shoot dry weight and nitrogen mass, as well as
   nitrogenase activity, decreased with some strain mixtures indicating
   that relatively ineffective symbioses had formed, as compared with
   single-strain inoculations using symbiotically competent strains.},

Abstract = {The antibacterial activity of methanol extracts of Ficus benghalensis
   (prop-root) and Leucaena leucocephala (pod seed) was evaluated by
   measurement of zone of inhibition against pathogenic bacteria,
   Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila. Control artificial feed and
   artificial feed supplemented with 5\% powder of F. benghalensis and L
   leucocephala were prepared. Juvenile Clarias gariepinus were divided
   into four groups, acclimatized to laboratory conditions and fed with
   respective feeds for 20 days prior to the experiment. Immunomodulatory
   response of supplementary feed was studied by challenging the fish
   intraperitoneally at weekly intervals, with A. hydrophila. One set of
   fish, not challenged with A. hydrophila was used as a negative control,
   to analyze any detrimental effect of supplementary feed, while positive
   control, comprised of challenged fish fed with non-supplemented feed.
   Other two groups of fish were challenged with A. hydrophila and fed with
   respective supplementary feeds.
   Blood was collected on weekly intervals for four weeks and serum samples
   were analyzed to evaluate the damage of fish by A. hydrophila through
   liver function tests. The increase in the levels of Serum glutamic
   oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic pyruvate transaminase
   (SGPT) in positive control group indicated the damage of liver 82
   kidney. However the levels did not change significantly in fish fed with
   supplementary feeds when compared to negative control group. Nitric
   oxide, SOD, ALP and lipid peroxidase indicated lower stress levels in
   these fish compared to positive control. Fish fed with supplementary
   feed showed increased lysozyme activity and phagocytic index indicating
   an increase in non-specific immune response. The immunoglobulin levels
   of in serum were analyzed by homologous sandwich ELISA, which showed
   higher antibody production in fish fed with supplementary feed. The
   current study suggests conclusively, immunostimulatory role of E
   benghalensis (prop-roots) and L leucocephala (pod seed) in C gariepinus

Abstract = {This research was conducted to analyze the effect of legume wafer
   supplementation on the performance of post weaning Ettawa Grade goats. A
   total of 16 post weaning Ettawa Grade goats (average body weight 13.10
   +/- 0.91 kg) were grouped into 4 group treatments and 4 blocks as
   replicate in a completely randomized block design. The treatments were
   T0 (basal diet/control), T1 (supplementation of 12.12\% wafer supplement
   of Indigofera zollingeriana), T2 (supplementation of 13.54\% wafer
   supplement of Leucaena leucocephala) and T3 (supplementation of 12.37\%
   wafer supplement of Calliandra calothyrsus). The feed intake, nutrient
   digestibility, average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency (FE), and
   income over feed cost (IOFC) were observed. The results showed that
   supplementation of legume wafer increased (P<0.05) the feed intake,
   organic matter digestibility, ADG, FE, and IOFC. Supplementation of I.
   zollingeriana wafer increased ADG by 55.08\%, FE by 34.91\%, and IOFC by

Abstract = {Water use and depth of water extraction of leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala) and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) pasture, irrigated with
   desalinated coal seam water (a by-product of the coal seam gas
   industry), were monitored to provide background information on root
   activity, spatial and temporal water use and deep drainage over a
   757-day period from August 2011 to August 2013. Methodology comprised
   measurement of soil water from surface to 4 m depth using 8 EnviroSCAN
   probes connected to dataloggers positioned within leucaena twin rows and
   within the Rhodes grass interrow. Just over 581,000 individual moisture
   measurements were collated and are reported here. Water extraction (and
   by inference root activity) of leucaena and Rhodes grass showed marked
   seasonal fluctuation with deepest and highest water extraction occurring
   during the first growing season; water extraction was greatly diminished
   during the following drier and cooler seasons due to the negative
   influences of lower soil moisture contents, lower temperatures and
   increased defoliation on pasture growth. The highest values of deep
   drainage below 4 m depth occurred when high rainfall events corresponded
   with high soil water storage in the entire profile (0-4 m depth). Given
   that water usage by both leucaena and Rhodes grass was greatest in the
   upper layers of soil (<1.5 m), future research should focus on how the
   level of competitive interaction might be managed by choice of row
   spacing and frequency of irrigation. Further studies are needed,
   including: (a) physical sampling to determine the depth of active roots;
   (b) how defoliation affects rooting behaviors and water use of leucaena;
   and (c) modelling of the water and salt balances of leucaena and grass
   inter-row systems using data from this study, with various levels of
   irrigation, to investigate the risks of deep drainage over an extended

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate fermentation and chemical
   characteristics and the in situ degradability of sorghum silages
   enriched with dried Leucaena. The experiment was conducted as completely
   randomized design with four treatments (0 - control silage, silage
   without leucaena; 10.0, 20.0, or 30.0\% inclusion of Leucaena) and five
   replicates, totaling 20 experimental units. The inclusion levels of
   leucaena influenced (P < 0.05) the pH values, and for each 1\% inclusion
   there was a reduction of 0.0023 points in the pH value, and in all
   silages presented values. Dry matter recovery did not show effect (P >
   0.05), with all silages having values above 90\%. Gas loss decreased (P
   < 0.05) as the level of leucine increased in sorghum silage. A linear
   increase was observed for dry matter (P <= 0.0001) and crude protein (P
   = 0.0008) contents in response to Leucaena inclusion. There was a linear
   (P < 0.05) linear effect on neutral detergent fiber, hemicellulose and
   acid detergent fiber. As leucaena inclusion levels increased, for each
   1\% inclusion a reduction of 0.179 was observed; 0.059 and 0.119\% for
   the values of neutral detergent fiber, hemicellulose and acid detergent
   fiber respectively. The inclusion of leucaena influenced (P < 0.05) the
   increase of silage lignin levels, probably due to the higher lignin
   content of the legume. The soluble fraction (a) of the silages increased
   along with the Leucaena inclusion levels, with highest values observed
   at the inclusion of 20 and 30\% of the legume, respectively. Potential
   degradation (A) increased linearly with the levels of Leucaena added to
   the silage; the highest value for this variable was observed at 30\%
   inclusion. Effective degradability (ED) increased up to the inclusion
   level of 20\% (46.77\%). Degradation rate (c) decreased markedly with
   the use of 30\% Leucaena. The use of the forage part of Leucaena dried
   for three hours leads to reduced gas production, increased dry matter
   and crude protein contents, and decreased fiber contents. The
   degradability of dry matter increases up to the inclusion level of 20\%.},

   Cunningham and the Leucaena hybrid had the highest accumulation of all
   forage legumes evaluated, and provided the best nutritional value of all
   the arrangements tested. Of all woody legumes tested in this system,
   Leucaena was considered feasible for intercropping with Massai grass.
   The intercrop of perennial woody Baru with maize is not recommended.
   Albizia lebbeck and Cratylia argentea require further study, especially
   the yield assessment at different cutting intervals and cutting heights.
   Arachis pintoi had a low participation in the intercropping, showing

   density in the topsoil. Our study included an area of young forest (10
   years old), with phosphorus-poor soils, and an area of old forest
   (congruent to60 years old). We used 16 plots (12 m x 12 m) per forest,
   in which we fertilized four plot replicates per treatment with nitrogen
   (N), phosphorus (P) and nitrogen plus phosphorus (NP). Another four
   replicates were kept as control. In four 1 m x 1 m sub-plots set of each
   experimental plot, tree seedling dynamics were studied over 2 years. The
   species with the highest recruitment were Acacia gaumeri and Leucaena
   leucocephala in the young forest, and Bursera simaruba and Phyllostyllon
   brasiliense in the old forest. Recruitment of A. gaumeri was affected
   more by light availability than fertilization, but its survival
   increased with N or with NP additions. Leucaena leucocephala benefited
   by fertilization (N, P, or NP) and the species regenerated on sites with
   lower light availability, but required high light conditions and N
   addition to increase its survival. The recruitment and survival of B.
   simaruba required low light availability, and the fertilization with P
   or with NP increased its regeneration. Phyllostyllon brasiliense was
   recruited only in the old forest. The addition of P resulted in the
   highest recruitment and the lowest survival among fertilization
   treatments, leading to a negative final seedling density. Canonical
   analysis revealed that in the young forest, the most important variables
   that influenced species recruitment were bulk density in the topsoil,
   fertilization with P, fertilization with N, and light availability. In
   the old forest, the P and N fertilizations and bulk density in the
   topsoil appeared to be the most important variables; only light was not
   significant. Light requirement differences between forests suggest that
   a large number of opportunistic species in the young forest could exist
   there. Overall, our results suggest that the dynamic of understory
   vegetation in Yucatan Peninsula is strongly influenced by nutrient
   availability, especially P. The responses of seedling dominant species
   to nutrient addition will vary, depending on the details of the site's
   light availability and soil bulk density, and the identity of species.

Abstract = {The effect of alley cropping with seven combinations of Acioa and
   Leucaena hedgerows and a control (no hedgerow) treatment on sequentially
   cropped maize and cowpea was studied in 1985 and 1986.  The trial was
   carried out on an Alfisol in the humid zone of southwestern Nigeria. 
   Hedgerows were established in 1983, using 4 m interhedgerow spacing and
   pruned to 25 cm height during cropping.
   Highest dry matter, wood, and nutrient yields of prunings of Acioa and
   Leucaena hedgerows were obtained with sole cropping.  Growing Leucaena
   and Acioa and the same hedgerow suppressed dry matter production and
   nutrient yield of Acioa more than of Leucaena owing to the latter's
   faster growth.  Total pruning dry matter yield was reduced as the
   proportion of Acioa increased in the combination.  Leucaena prunings had
   higher nutrient yield than Acioa.
   Under 22-month old uncut hedgerows, weed biomass declined in the
   presence of Leucaena, either alone or in combination with Acioa.  Weed
   weight under sole Leucaena hedgerows was about a third of that in the
   control plot.  There was no significant effect of alley cropping on weed
   biomass, although alley cropping with Acioa and Leucaena hedgerows
   resulted in the dominance of broadleaf weeds while the control had a
   mixture of broadleaves and grasses.
   Alley cropping with various combinations of Acioa and Leucaena hedgerows
   increased maize and cowpea yields compared to control.  Nitrogen
   application in both years increased maize grain yield.  Mean yield
   increase due to N application in both years was highest in the control
   (47.2\%) followed by the sole Acioa hedgerow (25.2\%) and less in
   hedgerows with Leucaena.  The results of observations over two years do
   not show any advantage for the tested Leucaena and Acioa combinations on
   maize and cowpea crops as compared to the sole hedgerows.},

Abstract = {A mixture simplex design (special cubic version of Scheffe's canonical
   polynomial) was used to investigate associative effects of feed mixtures
   incubated using an in vitro gas production technique. The model included
   the principal effects (single feeds), double and multiple interaction
   (mixtures of two and three feeds). Two forage trees (Leucaena
   leucocephala and Lysiloma latisiliquum) were evaluated in two separate
   incubation batches. Commercial concentrate feed, grass hay and a fodder
   tree were used to prepare the mixtures in all possible combinations
   resulting from 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 of grass, concentrate and
   one forage tree per batch. Pressure and gas volumes were monitored up to
   168 h. After incubation the residues were used to measure DM and OM
   digestibility (in vitro dry matter (IVDMD) and in vitro organic matter
   (IVOMD)). Cumulative gas production (CGP (ml)) profiles were fitted to
   the equation CGP = a + b(1 - e(-kt)). A significant associative response
   in total gas production (P < 0.01) was found when the forage trees were
   mixed with the concentrate but not with the grass. Grass and concentrate
   mixtures increased gas production but the interaction was significant
   only in the L. latisiliquum batch (P < 0.05). IVDMD and IVOMD were
   reduced by the inclusion of leucaena in the mixture (P < 0.01). Rate of
   gas production, k (\% h(-1)) was significantly depressed when L.
   latisiliquum was a component of the mixture (P < 0.01) but not in all
   remaining mixtures, including those that contained leucaena. It was
   concluded that mixture simplex designs are useful tools to identify and
   study in vitro associative effects of feed mixtures. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-30},
Abstract = {Prunings in hedgerow intercropping systems are a potential source of
   organic matter and their quality is an important characteristic driving
   decomposition and nutrient release. To determine the potential range of
   residue characteristics and the impact of canopy age on those, selected
   characteristics of Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, and Senna
   siamea hedgerow leaf residues were determined for `young' (5-10 weeks)
   and `old' (39-47 weeks) hedgerow canopies in six sites, representative
   in terms of soil for the derived savanna zone of West-Africa. The N
   content of the Leucaena and Senna residues decreased with age (from 4.8
   to 3.9\% and from 4.1 to 3.0\%, respectively, while the N content of the
   Gliricidia residues remained constant (3.9\%). The P content of all
   species decreased with age (from 0.30 to 0.20\%, on average). The lignin
   content of the Leucaena residues increased, and their polyphenol content
   decreased with age, while for the Senna residues only an increase in
   polyphenol content with canopy age was evident. Neither the lignin nor
   the polyphenol content of the Gliricidia leaf residues was markedly
   affected by canopy age. For all species, the P and ADF content were
   positively correlated with the ash and lignin content, respectively. The
   N content of the Leucaena and Senna residues was positively correlated
   with their P content while the lignin content of the same species was
   negatively correlated with the polyphenol content. Because of the low
   variation in certain residue characteristics between sites, the
   presented data and equations could potentially be used to reasonably
   estimate those characteristics if no other information is available. For
   other characteristics, such as polyphenol contents, measurements are
   preferable in view of the relatively high variation encountered.},

Abstract = {Faecal excretion and its annual distribution was studied through a
   completely randomized design with Holstein cows, using Voisin's Rational
   Grazing (VRG) system in guinea grass likoni (Panicum maximum likoni). A
   protein bank of Leucaena leucocephala (var Peru) and supplementation
   with humid Saccharina was used in the dry season. The grazing area has a
   total stocking rate df 3.9 animals/ha/year. Results show a notable
   variation of the organic matter distribution in the paddocks, from 40 to
   24 t of FM/ha/year, due to the rotations and the grazing intensity.
   Faecal excretion occurred in 65, 24 and 11\% of the grazing area, the
   shade building and the milking part our, respectively. There was an
   inadequate number of faecal excretions for this type of animal, due to
   animal consumption factors, together with a marked difference within
   seasons. The area covered by each dung patch was 0.05, 0.09 and 0.11
   m(2) for those circular, elongated and irregular, while the weight was
   of 3.5, 2.6 and 1.8 kg MF/dung patch, respectively It is concluded that
   under these conditions, the Increase in DM consumption is necessary as
   well as the use of organic matter produced outside the system to correct
   the non homogeneous distribution of the faecal excretion in the guinea
   grass likoni area under VRG. Also, possibilities for increasing the time
   of the animal in the grassland must be created.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {189-195},

Abstract = {Seed germination can be influenced by passage through the digestive
   system of animals, which can act as seed dispersers, depending on how
   seeds are affected. When passing through the animal digestive tract does
   not reduce the seeds germination, the dispersal agent is considered
   legitimate. The effects of ingestion by bovine cattle (Bos Taurus
   Linnaeus (1758)) on the viability and germination of seeds of the
   species Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth and
   Calopogonium mucunoides Desv. was investigated in this study, aiming at
   evaluating the role of cattle as legitimate dispersers of those forage
   plants. Seed samples were mixed with the food offered to three B. taurus
   females, whose feces were collected 36 hours after ingestion, and seeds
   recovered from the feces were quantified and tested for germination and
   initial seedling growth. Non-ingested seeds were used as a control. The
   percentage of undamaged seeds recovered ranged from 12.3 to 17.5\%. The
   germination capacity (germinability) of C. cajan was strongly inhibited
   by the cattle ingestion, whereas the germinability of C. mucunoides was
   less affected. The germinability of L. leucephala was not influenced by
   the ingestion probably due to their hard seed coat. The germination rate
   of C. mucunoides and L. leucocephala seeds was slightly increased by
   cattle ingestion, whereas the Emergence Rate Index (ERI) was reduced in
   the former. The ingestion by cattle also caused a decrease in the growth
   rate of C. cajan and C. mucunoides seedlings, although this inhibitory
   effect was smaller in C. cajan. The height of L. leucocephala seedlings
   was increased by ingestion. The results suggest that bovine cattle
   aren't legitimate seed dispersers of L. leucocephala, C. mucunoides and
   C. cajan.},

Title = {A Trait-Based Protocol for the Biological Control of Invasive Exotic
   Plant Species},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Selecting appropriate native species for the biological control of
   invasive exotic plants is a recurring challenge for conservationists,
   ecologists, and land managers. Recently developed trait-based approaches
   may be an effective means of overcoming this challenge. However, we lack
   a protocol and software platform that can be used to quickly and
   effectively select potential native plant species for performing
   biological control of the invasive exotic plant species. Here, our study
   introduces a protocol and a software program that can be used for
   trait-based selection of appropriate native plant species for performing
   biocontrol of invasive exotic plant species. In particular, we
   illustrate the effectiveness of this software program and protocol by
   identifying native species that can be used for the biological control
   of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, a highly invasive plant species
   found in many parts of the world. Bougainvillea spectabilis was the only
   native species selected by our software program as a potential
   biocontrol agent for L. leucocephala. When separately planting 4
   seedlings of B. spectabilis and two unselected species (Bombax ceiba,
   and Ficus microcarpa) as neighbors of each individual of L. leucocephala
   for 3 years, we found that B. spectabilis, which was functionally
   similar to the invasive L. leucocephala, significantly limited the
   invasion of the latter, while the unselected native plant species could
   not. That was because all the seedling of B. spectabilis survived, while
   half seedlings of unselected species (B. ceiba and F. microcarpa) died,
   during the experimental period when planted with L. leucocephala
   seedlings. Moreover, the growth of L. leucocephala was restricted when
   planted with B. spectabilis, in contrast B. ceiba and F. microcarpa did
   not influence the growth of L. leucocephala. Overall, our software
   program and protocol can quickly and efficiently select native plant
   species for use in the biological control of invasive exotic plant
   species. We expect that this work will provide a general protocol to
   perform biological control of many different types of invasive exotic
   plant species.},

   levels) of the fish were evaluated. The increase in the levels of SGOT
   and SGPT in liver of fish fed with non-supplemented feed indicated
   damage of most targeting organs by A. hydrophila. However, the levels
   did not changed significantly in fish fed with experimental feed till
   the end of experiment. Higher levels of nitric oxide and superoxide
   dismutase indicated lower stress in fish fed with supplementary feed
   compared to control group. Fish fed with supplementary feed also showed
   increase in lysozyme and phagocytic activity. The levels of

Abstract = {This research studied on the preparation of low cost-activated carbon
   from the carbonized carbon of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. It
   was found that the activated carbon prepared at 500 degrees C for 3 h

   non-polar iodine molecule. Both of adsorbents (503 and commercial
   activated carbon-UCS) modified by cationic surfactants (HDTMA and DDAB)
   were also applied for removal chromium (VI) ion (Cr2O72-), which as
   expected, adsorption capacity of Cr2O72- was clearly enhanced, comparing
   with adsorbent without modification. The physicochemical properties of
   as-modified adsorbents were investigated. Adsorption behaviour of
   Cr(2)O(7)(2-)onto modified adsorbent was well fitted on Langmuir and
   Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms as well as pseudo-secondorder kinetic
   model, suggesting to fast monolayer-physisorption process. The activated
   carbon (UCS-DDAB) exhibited a maximum q(max) of 3.46 mg g(-1).
   Thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption of Cr2O72- onto
   absorbent surface was endothermic process with spontaneous nature. This
   research was expected to improve the efficiency of activated carbon
   modified by cationic surfactants, and could be definitely applied for
   removal of Cr(VI) ion from wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Sixty three Holstein cows in two milk production groups: high and low
   were used under graminae and legume grasslands in the rainy period to
   observe the effect of cutting the grass for the control of legume
   consumption on the grazing habit in Leucaena protein banks. The time of
   access to the protein bank was 2 hr daily. A linear model controlling
   the factors previously reported (cutting and grazing time) was used. No
   cutting .times. grazing time interaction was found. Results indicate
   that total consumption time of cows did not vary (76.7 and 71.4\%),
   using cutting or not, but difference (P < 0.05) was found between time
   dedicated to leucaena and grass ingestion 62.7 vs. 37.3\% using cutting
   and 33.4 vs. 65.6\% when grass was not cut, respectively. There was an
   effect of the time used for grazing on animal performance. 93\% of the
   time was dedicated to consumption in the first hour and 57\% of the
   second hour in which rumination increases to 28.4\% of the time. The
   results suggest that it  is feasible to augment leucaena consumption by
   cutting the grass in the protein bank to regulate leucaena growth.},

Abstract = {The level of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) infection in the

   closely paralleled that of the development of infection, particularly
   during the first 10-30 days after planting. Significant changes in dry
   matter yield were also observed only after a significant portion of the
   root  length was colonized by Glomus aggregatum. The development of VAM
   infection was not accompanied by growth depression at any of the
   sampling periods. However, VAM roots had very high levels of Cu which
   was not translocated to shoots. It is hypothesized that such a diversion
   of Cu by the endophyte from the host could cause growth depression under
   conditions where the soil volume is supplied with sub-optimal levels of
   Cu.},

Abstract = {It has been shown that intraspecific competition and resource quality
   may affect life-history traits of insects, such as body size, fecundity,
   and survival. However, intraspecific competition and resource quality
   may interact with each other. The study of such interacting effects is
   crucial for understanding the influence of these ecological variables on
   the selection of specific life-history traits. Here, we investigated
   whether the interaction between intraspecific larval competition and
   variation in resource quality affects adult emergence and survival, egg
   size, fecundity, body size, and sexual size dimorphism (SSD) of the
   seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer)
   (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) when infesting Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit (Fabaceae), its host plant. In the
   laboratory, beetles were reared on seeds that differed in quality (e.g.,
   different hardness, seed size, water content), in the presence or
   absence of larval competition. Body size and SSD did not differ between
   treatments (with and without competition), nor were they affected by
   varying resource quality. Females subjected to competition during the
   larval stage and females emerging from seeds of higher quality,
   displayed the highest fecundity. The proportion of emergent adults was
   higher in the absence of competition. In addition, larger eggs were laid
   on the low-quality resource in the absence of competition, showing a
   trade-off between egg size and egg number. Adult survival differed among
   treatments and resource qualities, suggesting a higher investment in
   adult survival for individuals emerging from seeds of low quality in the
   presence of competition. Whether changes in specific traits could be
   selected for in detriment of others will depend on the strength of
   intraspecific competition, the variation in resource quality, and the
   plasticity in the life-history traits investigated. This needs further
   clarification.},

Abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from endophytic fungi are becoming a
   potential antibiotic resource. The inhibitive effects of VOCs produced
   by an endophytic fungus in Leucaena leucocephala were investigated on
   plant pathogens in this study. Using standard morphological methods and
   multigene phylogeny, the fungus was identified as Diaporthe apiculatum
   strain FPYF 3052. Utilizing a two- compartment Petri plate bioassay
   method, the VOCs from this fungus showed bioactivity ranging from 23.8\%
   to 66.7\% inhibition on eight plant pathogens within 24 hours. The
   SPME-GC/MS technique identified fifteen volatile compounds with dominant
   terpenoids gamma-terpinene (39.8\%), alpha-terpinene (17.2\%), and
   (-)-4-terpineol (8.4\%) from the VOCs. Commercial alpha-terpinene,
   gamma-terpinene, and (-)-4-terpineol demonstrated inhibition on the
   tested pathogens at concentrations from 0.2 to 1.0 mu l/ml within 72 h
   in the bioassay system. The inhibition rates were from 28\% to 100\%
   percent using 1.0 mu l/ml within 48 h. (-)-4-Terpineol was the most
   active of the terpenoids causing up to 100\% inhibition. The data
   illustrate that these monoterpenes play an important role in the
   inhibitive bioactivity of the VOCs of D. apiculatum FPYF 3052. Most
   importantly, (-)-4-terpineol is now for the first time, reported to have
   capability of strong antifungal activity and could be developed as an

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},

Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {Natural coagulants from plants resources have gained a lot of attention
   as it is renewable, biodegradable, non-hazardous, lower cost, and less
   sludge generated compared to chemical coagulants. However there are
   still some drawbacks, namely long settling time and possible increase of
   dissolved organic carbon in the treated water. In this paper we tried to
   address these drawbacks by utilizing citrate modified Fe3O4 to adsorb
   protein from Leucaena leucocephala as the active coagulating agent. The
   effect of trisodium citrate concentration and protein adsorption pH to
   the adsorbed protein was investigated. It was found that the trisodium
   citrate concentration of 0.5 M and pH 4.0 gave the highest protein
   adsorption. The obtained magnetic coagulant was furthermore
   characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray Diffraction,
   Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron
   Microscopy to observe the characteristics before and after protein
   adsorption. Furthermore, the effect of pH (2 to 10) and coagulant dosage
   (60 to 600 mg L- 1) to the removal of synthetic Congo red wastewater and
   sludge volume formation was investigated. It was found that pH 3 was the
   best pH for coagulation due to charge neutralization mechanism of
   leucaena protein. Furthermore the highest removal was obtained at dosage
   420 mg L- 1 with 80\% removal. This result was comparable with crude
   extract of leucaena with half settling time (20 min) and lower increase
   of permanganate value, indicating lower increase of dissolved organics

Abstract = {Appropriate N-15-labeling methods are crucial for estimating
   N-2-fixation in trees used in agroforestry systems. A 4-year field
   experiment was conducted on an Alfisol in Southwestern Nigeria to
   compare the estimates of N-2 fixed in Leucaena leucocephala, using two
   non-N-2-fixing leguminous trees, Senna siamea and S. spectabilis, as
   reference plants and three different methods of introducing N-15 into
   soil. The atom \% N-15 uptake pattern (as reflected in the leaves) was
   identical in both N-2- and non-N-2-fixing tree species irrespective of
   the N-15-application method. There was a significant decline in atom \%
   N-15 excess in the leaves of L. leucocephala (from 0.266 to 0.039), S.
   siamea (0.625 to 0.121), and S. spectabilis (from 0.683 to 0.118) from
   the first sampling 12 months after planting and the second sampling 18
   months after sampling. From the second harvest in 1991 until the end of
   the experiment (fifth) harvest in 1993, however, the atom N-15\% excess
   decline in leaves of the three species was less pronounced and depended
   on the method of N-15 application. In those plants to which the tracer
   was applied once at planting, the N-15 decline was steady between the
   second and the last prunings. In the split-application treatment, the
   atom N-15\% excess increased slightly at the third pruning and decreased
   during the subsequent two prunings. The reference tree and the method of
   N-15 application influenced the estimated proportion of N derived from
   atmospheric N-2 by L. leucocephala, calculated as 73 and 64\%,
   corresponding to 119 and 98 kg N ha(-1) of N-2 fixed per 6 months, when
   S. spectabilis and S. siamea were used as reference trees, respectively.
   The approach by which N-15-labeled fertilizer was applied to the soil in
   three splits gave slightly higher estimates of N derived from the
   atmosphere but this was of little agronomic significance because total
   N-2 fixed was similar for all methods.},

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {127-137},
Abstract = {The amounts of earthworm surface casts were monitored for 200 days after
   commencement of casting in three alley cropping experiments of different
   ages and hedgerow species. Casts were collected twice per week in
   transects from under the hedgerow to the middle of the interrow space.
   Average annual cumulative amounts of casts were higher in alley cropping
   systems with one to five years of cropping than in the no-tree control.
   After five years of cropping, amounts of casts were similar in all
   treatments. Within the alley cropping systems, casting activity was
   highest immediately under the hedgerows and decreased towards the middle
   of the interrow space. In systems using Leucaena leucocephala as
   hedgerow species, the hedgerow to interrow space gradient of casting
   activity became more pronounced with increasing length of cropping.
   Casting activity in the interrow space was reduced by 12\%, 55\%, 80\%
   and 86\% in the first, fourth, sixth and seventh year of cropping,
   respectively, compared to the casting activity under the hedgerows.
   Senna siamea, which produced a more recalcitrant mulch, did not show
   such a strong decline in casting in the interrow space. In a
   Dactyladenia barteri system, the difference in casting between interrow
   space and hedgerows was insignificant. With perpendicular distance from
   the hedge, largest gradients in casting activity occurred close to the
   hedgerows with up to -4.00 Mg ha(-1) cm(-1) in L. leucocephala but only
   -1.23 and -0.76 Mg ha(-1) cm(-1) in S. siamea and D. barteri,
   respectively. The shading effect of trees and a relatively low level of
   soil disturbance is apparently more beneficial for earthworms in a
   cropped system than a high supply of readily available food from fast
   decomposing L. leucocephala prunings.},

Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},

Pages = {365-372},
Abstract = {A postal survey of the level of awareness of leucaena toxicity and an
   on-farm study of the toxicity status of Queensland cattle herds grazing
   leucaena were conducted to investigate the prevalence of mimosine and
   dihydroxypyridine (DHP) toxicity in Queensland. In total, 195 of 356
   graziers surveyed responded to the postal survey. Sixty-three percent
   had inoculated their cattle with in vitro Synergistes jonesii inoculum
   (produced in an anaerobic fermenter) and 30\% of these had inoculated
   more than once. The remainder used inappropriate procedures. Many
   graziers (43\%) had occasionally observed toxicity symptoms of hair loss
   and poor animal growth rates. In the on-farm study, the toxicity status
   of 385 animals in 44 individually managed herds on 36 properties was
   determined by urine analysis of mimosine and DHP concentrations. No
   animals were experiencing mimosine toxicity, based on low concentrations
   of this compound found in the urine. Using the criterion that average
   herd urine concentrations of DHP > 100 mu g/mL was indicative of
   subclinical toxicity, 48\% of herds were exposed to subclinical toxicity
   due to dominant 3,4-DHP (21\%) or dominant 2,3-DHP (27\%) toxicity; many
   of these herds had been inoculated with S. jonesii and were thought to
   be protected. The finding that 27\% of herds were excreting high
   concentrations of 2,3-DHP was unexpected. Statistical analysis of
   herd-management data revealed that the method used by graziers to
   inoculate their herds was significantly (P < 0.05) but weakly linked to
   herd protection status. It was concluded that subclinical 3,4-DHP and
   2,3-DHP toxicity remains a problem in Queensland and is likely to be
   limiting animal production in a significant number of cattle grazing
   leucaena-grass pastures.},

Abstract = {Giant leucaena is a multipurpose tree-legume found throughout the
   tropics and sub-tropics. Its foliage is used as animal fodder due to
   high protein and fiber. Giant leucaena has several other advantageous
   traits such as fast-growth, high yields and strong tolerance to
   environmental stresses. Despite having these desirable qualities,
   leucaena tissues contain an undesirable attribute, a toxic non-protein
   amino acid, mimosine, found in all parts of the plant including the
   foliage. The goal of this research was to determine mimosine
   concentrations in various tissues and life stages of giant leucaena
   plants to inform use of leucaena foliage as a fodder. Mimosine was
   extracted from different parts of giant leucaena at different ages and
   quantified using HPLC analysis. qRT-PCR was used to determine the
   relative expression of mimosine synthase in leucaena tissues. Mimosine
   was present in all parts of the leaf, stem and root of giant leucaena,
   and concentrations changed depending on the age of the plant. Green
   seeds had the highest expression level of mimosine synthase. Mimosine is
   ubiquitous and abundant in leucaena tissues with younger and immature
   plants and tissues containing more mimosine than older mature plants and

Abstract = {The use of manure, organic mulch, and legume-based fertilizers can
   increase soil fertility in semiarid regions. However, the effects of
   such practices on soils prone to desertification are unknown. This study
   aimed to evaluate soil fertility and herbaceous stratum yield on soils
   amended with different organic inputs in the desertification hotspot of
   Iraucuba, Ceara state, Brazil. The experiments were performed in two
   areas with different soils (Planosol and Cambisol), in randomized blocks
   with a 2 x 2 x 3 + 1 factorial design. The factors consisted of (i)
   mulch (presence or absence of Copernicia prunifera {[}carnauba palm]
   straw), (ii) manure (sheep or cattle), and (iii) legume-based fertilizer
   (Mimosa tenuiflora {[}jurema], Mimosa caesalpiniifolia {[}sabia], and
   Leucaena leucocephala {[}leucena]), in addition to an untreated control,
   with three replicates. Soil chemical attributes and herbaceous stratum
   yield were assessed in the two areas. Positive effects of the combined
   use of carnauba palm straw, manures, and legume-based fertilizers on
   soil fertility were more evident for Planosol than for Cambisol. The
   combination of sheep manure with sabia-based fertilizer in Planosol, and
   cattle manure and leucena-based fertilizer in Cambisol increased
   herbaceous stratum yield. Herbaceous stratum yield in Planosol is more
   responsive to the input of great amounts of soil nutrients (especially
   P) and it increases soil organic matter levels, while in Cambisol,
   herbaceous stratum yield is more associated with the ability of inputs
   to make nutrients readily available. The use of organic amendments can
   reverse, in the short-term, degradation and desertification processes of
   soils in the Brazilian semiarid region.},

Abstract = {Leueaena gum derived from seeds of Leueaena leucocephala was evaluated
   as a binding agent in lactose-based tablets containing sodium
   salicylate. The binding properties of gum were compared with acacia and

   of repose, flow rate and percentage of fines. The tablet properties
   investigated included: uniformity of weight, hardness, friability,
   binding capacity, disintegration time and in vitro dissolution (k,
   t(50\%), A(30)). Like other binding agents, an increase in gum
   concentration decreases the percentage fines and friability and
   increases the hardness and disintegration time. Furthermore, the greater
   the binding concentration, the lower the k, A(30) and the higher the
   t(50\%). The results indicate that Leucaena seed gum is a potential
   pharmaceutical binding agent.},

Abstract = {Studies to determine the most efficient seed disinfection and

   Six disinfection periods with 1\%sodium hypochlorite (5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
   30 min) and mercury bichloride as the control. The scarification was
   carried out with hot water for 3 min, seed pre-germination 24 hr in
   sterile water at room temperature and a control treatment. A simple
   classification design with 3 replications was used. Daily measurements
   of height were taken from the in vitro sowing until 14 days and from
   these plants 9 explants were dissected for their analysis. Also, the
   response to two culture media in plant formation was tested. In the seed
   disinfection the best response was obtained with the mercury bichloride
   where contamination reached only 23.7\%. However, with sodium
   hypochlorite these ranged from 65.95 to 77.49\% (P < 0.001). The most
   effective scarification was seed pre-germination in water for 24 hr with
   germination values of 77.08\%, while in hot water it was of 59.2\% (P <
   0.001). The linear equation,for growth (y = 0.993 + 0.503x) was of good
   fit (r(2) = 0.99). Of the explants studied only the cotyledonal nodes
   formed plants and showed a superior response with the concentration of 5
   mg/litre of BAP. Further studies on disinfection, scarification and
   hormone concentration for the in vitro micropropagation of L.

Abstract = {Soil moisture depletion during dry seasons by planted hedgerows to lower
   levels than under natural fallow, would reduce drainage and nutrient
   losses in the following rainy season when food crops are grown. The
   volumetric water content of the 0-150 cm soil pro. le was measured under
   planted hedgerows (alternating Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia
   sepium) and natural fallow, both either annually cropped to sole maize
   or in a two-year crop/two-year fallow rotation, in the humid forest zone
   (annual rainfall 1700 mm) of southern Cameroon during the 1995-1996 and
   1996-1997 dry seasons. Hedgerows were cut to 0.05 m height, largely
   eliminating trees' water consumption during cropping phases. Differences
   in total soil water content at 0-150 cm depth, between systems, occurred
   only in the early phases of the 1996-1997 dry season. In both dry
   seasons, differences between systems in water content were found in some
   soil layers, all within 0-60 cm depth, yet, without consistent advantage
   of any system in exploiting the topsoil water resources. Soil water
   content was lower under L. leucocephala than G. sepium at 20-40 cm depth
   only. Below 60 cm depth, no differences in water regimes between systems
   were found. Under southern Cameroonian conditions it is unlikely that
   any of the systems has an advantage in accessing or recovering water and
   thus, if available, nutrients from the sub-soil. None of the systems
   examined was capable of delaying drainage and thus it appears unlikely
   that downward displacement of nutrients is delayed after the start of
   the rains.},

Abstract = {A detailed study of the soil chemical and physical properties in
   seven-year-old alley cropping trial containing Leucaena leucocephala and
   Flemingia congesta in Northern Zambia is described. There was a strong
   correlation between the maize yield and the total amount of nitrogen
   applied, both from prunings and fertiliser, suggesting that a major
   reason for the observed benefit from alley cropping, particularly with
   Leucaena, was due to an improvement in nitrogen supply. Leucaena
   produced significantly more biomass, and its leaves had higher
   concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium and lower C/N and
   C/P ratios than did those of Flemingia. There was also evidence that the
   trees had a beneficial effect on other soil chemical properties; under
   the hedgerows, particularly those of Leucaena, there were higher levels
   of organic carbon, Mg, K and ECEC, and pH values were also highest.
   It is suggested that higher levels of organic carbon in the alley crop
   treatments were responsible for the improvements observed in soil
   physical properties. Lower bulk density, lower penetration resistance,
   and a higher infiltration rate and pore volume fraction were measured in
   the alley crops, although there was no significant change in the soil
   water release parameters.
   A deteriorating effect of constant applications of nitrogen fertiliser
   on soil fertility was observed; as the level of urea application
   increased, there were significant decreases in Mg, K and pH, increases
   in Al and soil acidity, and higher penetrometer resistance. These
   results highlight the urgent need for further research on biological
   methods of maintaining soil fertility.},

Abstract = {Patterns of understory colonization by native and naturalized trees and

   species, Casuarina equisetifolia, Eucalyptus robusta, and Leucaena
   leucocephala, on a degraded coastal grassland site with reference to
   overstory composition and understory environmental conditions. 19
   secondary forest species were established in the plantation understories
   (with a total area of 0.52 ha), while no natural regeneration occurred
   in unplanted, though protected, control areas. The majority of these
   species (90 \%) and the total seedling population (97 \%) were
   zoochorous, indicating the importance of frugivorous bats and
   particularly birds as facilitators of secondary forest species
   colonization. Understory species richness and seedling densities were
   affected significantly by overstory composition, the most abundant
   regeneration occurring beneath Leucaena and least under Casuarina.
   Understory colonization rates within mixed-species stands were
   intermediate between those of single-species stands of the trees
   comprising their overstories. Significant negative correlations were
   found between understory species richness and seedling density, and
   forest floor depth and dry mass, especially for small-seeded
   ornithochorous species. Higher colonization rates near the peripheries
   of plantation plots relative to plot interiors were due in part to
   roosting site preferences by frugivores, particularly bats.
   The study results indicate that overstory species selection can exert a
   significant influence on subsequent patterns of colonization by
   secondary forest species and is an important consideration in the design
   of plantations for `catalyzing' succession on deforested, degraded
   sites.},

Abstract = {Rensch's rule states that males vary more in size than females when body
   size increases. The main cause of Rensch's rule has been credited to
   sexual selection. However, different degrees of plasticity between the
   sexes have also been proven to be useful for describing variations in
   sexual size dimorphism, particularly within an intraspecific context.
   For insects, in general, this rule has rarely been tested within
   species. Here, we tested whether Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus
   (Schaeffer, 1907) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) followed
   Rensch's rule when individuals emerged from seeds immediately after
   fruit collection and when they were reared for one generation, by
   measuring three morphological traits. Rensch's rule was not followed for
   any of the morphological traits. Variations in body size were similar in
   males and females for bruchines that first emerged from seeds and for
   those that were reared for one generation. These findings suggest that
   environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, and seasonality)
   are unlikely to drive differential plasticity in males and females of
   this seed-feeding beetle. It is possible that changes in the body size
   of A. macrophthalmus have a genetic basis. However, regardless of
   whether variations in body size have a genetic basis, our findings
   provide no support for Rensch's rule.},

   trend towards lower  percentages in wetter years. The calving percentage
   of the farm or control herd which did not graze leucaena was 90\%, with
   little fluctuation between years. The calving percentage of cows
   formerly grazing leucaena pastures improved from 54\% to 75\% when they
   were returned to the farm herd. Bulls used on the leucaena herd achieved
   high calving percentages (about 90\%) when used on the farm herd in
   subsequent years. It was concluded that high intakes of leucaena could
   depress calving percentages  and should be avoided in the first 3 months
   of pregnancy. Reasons for the depression in calving percentage, and the
   possible impact of DHP {[}3-hydroxy-4(1H)pyridone] degrading bacteria,
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {Three successive greenhouse experiments were carried out to determine
   the effectiveness of an initial application of benlate for obtaining
   soil free of mycorrhizal activity. An Oxisol was amended with P to
   obtain target concentrations optimal for mycorrhizal host growth or
   near-sufficient for mycorrhiza-free growth. The soil was not inoculated
   or was inoculated with the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus
   Glomus aggregatum and amended with benlate to obtain concentrations of
   0-100 mg kg(-1). At the former soil P concentration, benlate completely
   suppressed mycorrhizal formation and effectiveness, indicated by pinnule
   P content and shoot yield of Leucaena leucocephala in the initial
   experiment. The fungicide did not have significant effect on pinnule P
   content or shoot yield at the higher soil P concentration. In the second
   and third experiments, the inhibitory effect of the fungicide persisted
   through the first 30-40 days if the soil was not inoculated with G.
   aggregatum. Mycorrhizal activity in the benlate-treated and untreated
   low-P soils was similar in the third experiment if they had been
   inoculated with G. aggregatum. Our data suggest that benlate could be
   used to obtain mycorrhiza-free conditions at concentrations as low as 25
   mg kg(-1) for up to 90 days.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF LIVESTOCK SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {246-254},
Abstract = {Most sheep production systems are based on grazing medium to low quality
   grasslands, with or without supplements. In tropical areas, the
   inclusion of legume shrubs and trees like Leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala) in silvopastoral systems associated with grassland are an
   alternative to improve their productivity. An efficient way to test the
   impact of these innovations is by simulation models. Therefore, the
   objective was to validate the Pampa Corte model developed in Brazil
   adapted to sheep growth under Mexican conditions to simulate the effect
   of the inclusion of Leucaena in a silvopastoral system based on Guinea
   grass (Megathyrsus maximus cv. Tanzania). Three scenarios were
   simulated, T1 = 100\% Guinea grass, T2 = 80\% Guinea grass + 20\%
   Leucaena, and T3 = 60\% Guinea grass and 40\% Leucaena on a dry matter
   basis. Validation of the model was with data from a previous experiment
   on lamb growth fed a total mixed ration. Evaluation was from lineal
   regressions of simulated results over observed data. Results showed a
   coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.94 between observed and
   estimated figures. The simulation model also showed that as the
   proportion of Leucaena increases in the silvopastoral system, the daily
   live weight gain (DWG) also increases. The model provided good results
   for lamb growth in silvopastoral systems based on Guinea grass with the
   inclusion of Leucaena and validated with data from feedlot lambs fed a
   total mixed ration, both for extensive silvopastoral systems with 20\%
   Leucanea as for intensive silvopastoral systems with up to 40\% of
   Leucaena inclusion.},

   Congo Red Synthetic Wastewater},
Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {233},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Natural plant-based coagulant has been extensively studied these days
   due to its effectiveness and efficiency in wastewater treatment.
   However, utilization of plant-based coagulant happens to hold certain
   drawbacks, namely a long settling time and an increase of dissolved
   organic in the treated water. A combination of magnetic iron
   nanoparticles and plant-based protein was subsequently proposed as a
   solution. In this study, magnetic natural coagulant was synthesized via
   adsorption of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) protein on tannic
   acid-modified Fe3O4. The obtained magnetic coagulant was furthermore
   analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to observe the
   characteristics before and after protein adsorption. The effect of pH (2
   to 4) and coagulant dosage (25 to 250 mg L-1) on the removal of Congo
   red from wastewater and sludge formation was observed. The best
   condition was found at pH 2 due to the charge neutralization mechanism.
   Furthermore, the highest removal of 89.10\% with a sludge volume of 4 mL
   L-1 and a settling time of 5 min was obtained at a magnetic coagulant
   dosage of 100 mg L-1 and pH 2. The removal result was comparable with a
   crude extract of Leucaena, however with a much faster settling time.
   Furthermore, coagulation using magnetic natural coagulant resulted in
   higher removal of dissolved organics in the treated water, compared to
   crude extract, where the increase of organic contents was detected due
   to the presence of various soluble organic compounds in the crude
   extract. The results obtained in this study show a promising application
   of magnetic natural coagulant for sustainable water-wastewater
   treatment.},

Abstract = {Ileal and total tract nutrient and energy digestibility was studied in
   pigs fed three diets with increasing levels (0-200 g kg(-1))of leucaena
   meal (LM). The diets contained sugar cane molasses as the major source
   of energy. The composition of LM on a dry basis, was: 93.9\% organic
   matter, 42.0\% crude fibre, 4.14\% nitrogen, 16.95 kJ g(-1) gross
   energy. Either at the ileal or at the total tract level, the LM
   significantly depressed nutrient and energy digestibility. Estimated
   ileal and total tract nitrogen digestibility of LM was 52.8 and 57.0\%
   respectively indicating an almost zero disappearance of nitrogen from
   the large intestine. In vitro nitrogen digestibility of LM was 44.2\%.
   Daily ileal and faecal output of both short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and
   ammonia showed a slight trend to be proportional to the level of LM in
   the diet. This indicated a rather incomplete disappearance of SCFA and
   ammonia in the large intestine. At first approach it can be stated that
   digestibility of OM and CP are not strongly impaired by the introduction
   of 100 g kg(-1) of LM in the diet. It is suggested that methods to
   improve digestive utilization of nutrients contained in LM must be
   developed in order to avoid a deterioration of digestive efficiency in
   pigs fed considerable amounts of LM in the diet. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {Shortened fallows have resulted in declining upland rice yields in
   slash-and-burn upland rice systems in northern Laos. We studied the
   benefit of planted legume fallows for rice productivity, weeds, and soil
   nitrogen and phosphorus availability. Four systems were evaluated over a
   5-year period: 1-year fallow with native species, 1-year Cajanus cajan
   fallow, 1-year Leucaena leucocephala fallow, and continuous annual rice
   cropping. Rice was grown either once each year as continuous annual
   cropping or in alternate years of 2001, 2003, and 2005. C. cajan and L.
   leucocephala were sown with rice during the 2001 growing season. In
   subsequent years, L. leucocephala regenerated from root stock and did
   not have to be resown, whereas C. cajan was resown in 2003.
   Establishment of either C. cajan or L. leucocephala had no significant
   effect on rice yield in 2001, and rice yields ranged from 2.0 to 2.3
   t/ha. Rice yields declined rapidly in succeeding years, and rice yields
   in the four systems ranged from 0.7 to 1.1 t/ha in 2003 and from 0.3 to
   0.5 t/ha in 2005. Although two planted fallow systems increased nitrogen
   input because of greater biomass accumulation in 2003 and 2005 and soil
   phosphorus availability was higher following L. leucocephala fallow in
   2005, there were no significant differences in rice yields among the
   four systems in either year. Weed biomass during the rice growing season
   increased each year in all systems and increased more rapidly for
   continuous annual rice cropping, in which the dominant weed species was
   Ageratum conyzoides L. Among the other three systems, there were no
   significant differences in the weed biomass in 2003 and 2005. We
   conclude that C. cajan and L. leucocephala as 1-year fallows do not
   offset the negative effects of increased cropping intensity on rice
   yield in this region.},

Abstract = {The distribution, growth, and seed germination ability of the exotic
   lead tree in Penghu Islands, Taiwan, were studied. Survey results have
   shown that all lead tree plants existing throughout these islands
   belonged to the Hawaii type. Subsequently a comparison of germination
   requirements between this and the rare Salvador type, which distributes
   only in the island of Taiwan, was carried out. The objective of this
   research was to compare the germination requirements of the Salvador-
   and Hawaii-type lead tree plants. Lead trees in Penghu Islands have
   formed a pure forest with a height ranging from 2 to 4 m. All growth
   stages of the lead tree, i.e., vegetative, flowering, podding, and
   depodding stages, were found simultaneously in fall, but only vegetative
   and podding stages were observed in summer. Germination of both the
   Hawaii- and Salvador-type lead tree was evaluated under different
   environmental conditions, including temperature, pH, osmotic potential,
   burial depth, and lighting condition. The Salvador-type exhibited more
   than 60\% seed germination after 14 d at temperatures between 20 and 35
   C, whereas the seed germination of the Hawaii type increased from 20 to
   60\% with temperature increases from 20 to 35 C. The optimal temperature
   for seed germination of these two types of lead tree was 35 C.
   Increasing burial depth beneath the soil surface and darkness, as well
   as an osmotic potential below -0.4 MPa, also reduced seed germination.
   However, the germination of both types was not affected by pH ranging
   from 4.0 to 9.0. On the basis of the climatic and soil environment
   conditions in Penghu Islands, it is reasonable to predict that the
   summer season, in which lead tree seeds readily germinate on the ground
   or in shallow soils, is the optimal time for controlling this plant.},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Planting tree species with desirable traits may catalyze forest
   regeneration in increasingly common degraded lands by restoring soil
   properties and attracting seed dispersers. We sampled forest
   regeneration in an experimental plantation of Albizia lebbek, an
   introduced N-fixing species, on a degraded pasture in northern Puerto
   Rico, 27 years after its establishment. We hypothesized that the
   abundance of animal-dispersed tree species within this unmanaged
   plantation would be (1) greater than in adjacent pastures; (2) higher at
   distances closer to secondary forest; and (3) increased over the 20
   years since floristic surveys were last conducted in the site. We
   sampled forest structure and tree species composition, and compared the
   abundance of animal-dispersed tree species on plots located within the
   adjacent pasture and the A. lebbek plantation, within the plantation in
   plots distanced at 10, 35, and 60 m from secondary forest, and within
   the plantation at 7 vs. 27 years after plantation establishment. We
   found higher abundance of animal-dispersed tree species in the A. lebbek
   plantation than in the pasture. Distance from secondary forest had no
   effect on the abundance of animal-dispersed species. The abundance of
   animal-dispersed species increased by 14\% between 7 and 27 years after
   plantation establishment. In all, these results indicate that A. lebbek
   trees facilitated the establishment of native animal-dispersed species
   by shading out tall grasses and acting as perches for animals throughout
   the plantation. We found that A. lebbek lost its dominance in the site
   to another introduced N-fixing species, Leucaena leucocephala, possibly
   due to unfavorable traits such as susceptibility to pathogens. Our
   findings document a transition from an experimental plantation to a
   novel urban forest that harbors an array of native tree species, largely
   due to the digiersal of seeds by animals. A noteworthy example is the
   presence of Guaiacum officinale, an animal-dispersed and endangered tree
   species native to the dry forests of southern Puerto Rico. Our results
   highlight how monocultures of introduced tree species with desirable
   traits can catalyze the regeneration of native tree species in
   chronically degraded lands. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {An alley cropping experiment was conducted from 1986 to 1992 near
   Cotonou, Benin Republic on a field previously used as four-year
   bush-fallow. A no-tree control was compared with Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) de Wit and Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. grown in 4 m distant
   hedgerows. In the same experiment, application of 90-39-75 kg ha(-1) NPK
   fertiliser vs. no fertiliser and maize-cassava intercropping vs.
   rotation of sole crops was also tested. Topsoil samples (0-30 cm) were
   taken initially and again after four and six years. Alley cropping
   enhanced nitrogen recycling relative to the no-alley control by 253 kg
   ha(-1) yr(-1) for Leucaena and 131 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for Cajanus in the
   overall average but a maximum of 22 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) was recovered in
   total crop exports. Apparent fertiliser-N recovery increased from a low
   average of 14\% in the first year to 66\% in the second year up to a
   maximum of 109\% in the no-tree control in the last year. Soil nutrient
   depletion during the six years was significant for all nutrients except
   P, K falling from 0.5 to 0.1 cmol(c) kg(-1) soil and N from 0.08 to
   0.05\%. Hedgerow accumulation of N in the topsoil-plant system
   calculated as difference to a no-tree control was only 18 to 37 kg
   ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first four years after clearing, increasing to
   208 kg in Leucaena and 111 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in Cajanus without NPK
   during the last two years. During the first four years, average N, K, Ca
   and Mg losses from the topsoil-plant system of 223 kg, 160 kg, 176 kg
   and 80 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) were high but probably stored in the subsoil
   because corresponding leaching losses were only 10, 1, 15 and 6 kg
   ha(-1) yr(-1) at 150 cm depth during the second to fourth cropping year.
   Beyond the fourth year, markedly reduced nutrient losses from the
   topsoil and stable food crop yields in no-tree plots suggest that
   continuous maize-cassava cropping using balanced rates of mineral
   fertiliser is producing sustainable yields with almost closed nutrient
   cycles of the soil-plant system on our site.},

Abstract = {A 22-week experiment was conducted in controlled environments to
   investigate the effects of light and inoculum application on the,
   growth, nodulation and nitrogen fixation of 2 tropical legumes, viz
   Siris tree {[}Albizia lebbeck (L. Benth] and Subabul (Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.]. Two light regimes-high light and low light
   (stimulated shade) were used. Plants were either inoculated without the
   addition of inorganic nitrogen or they received inorganic nitrogen
   without inoculum application. Control plants neither received inoculum
   nor inorganic nitrogen. The results showed that in both species under
   high light, the inoculated plants outgrew the uninoculated ones.
   Although there appears to have been more investment of the biomass in
   the leaf area under simulated shade conditions for the inoculated
   plants, the lower net assimilation rate resulted in lower growth rate.
   The controlled plants had the least growth under both light regimes,
   though they grew better under low light indicating that these legumes
   may be able to withstand nitrogen stress under shade conditions. Also
   more nodules were produced and more nitrogen fixed under high light than
   under the low light. Although nitrogen fixation was reduced under low
   light, nitrogen uptake was higher for Albizia lebbeck for the inoculated
   treatments than the uninoculated treatments.},

Abstract = {Objective. Quantify the effects of mixing Leucaena (L) with King grass
   forage, fresh (K) or wilted (Kp), on the fermentation process and
   chemical composition of mixed silages. Materials and methods. Silos were
   produced mixing several proportions (kg: kg) K: L and Kp: L (100: 0; 75:
   25; 60: 40; 50: 50; 40: 60 and 0: 100) of both types of plants, under a
   completely randomized design of four replications. The quantity of
   organic acids (butyric, acetic, lactic), pH, ammonia nitrogen percent
   and some of the typical bromatologic nutrients of the forage before and
   after ensiling were measured. The treatment effects were evaluated
   through variance and regression analysis. Results. The results clearly
   proved the differences (p<0.05) between King grass and Leucaena which
   promote its mixing and wilting: better legume contents of crude protein
   (24 vs. 7\%), dry matter (33.77 vs. 22.05\%) and crude fiber (26.53 vs.
   32.5\%). Clear benefits on the conservation process of mixed silages
   were also measured: higher lactic productions and less butyric,
   acceptable pH (4.02-4.8) and protein degradation (<8\%). In addition, a
   positive effect on the chemical composition of the aforementioned
   silages was quantified (crude protein, dry matter and crude fiber
   progressive improvement). Conclusions. Mixed K+L silages are better than
   pure K if L is included below 25\% in KL and up to 40\% when K has been
   wilted. Higher inclusions of L will worsen the conservation process and
   will limit its elaboration.},

Abstract = {A survey of the leucaena toxicity status in four major goat-producing
   provinces of Thailand where leucaena is fed as the principal dietary
   component was conducted. Three adjacent dairy farms in one province
   where leucaena silage was being fed were also sampled. Urine samples
   were collected from 63 animals on six goat farms and from 32 cows on
   three dairy farms. Samples were acidified, cleaned and analysed by high
   performance liquid chromatography for 3,4-DHP and 2,3-DHP
   concentrations, using a modified procedure developed at the University
   of Queensland. Total DHP concentrations varied from 375 to 3357 mu g/mL
   on goat farms, and from 142 to 182 mu g/mL on dairy farms. These
   concentrations are indicative of subclinical toxicity that might cause
   reduced feed intake and productivity. The impact of high DHP on
   productivity needs to be further studied because leucaena is a readily
   available source of high-protein forage for ruminant industries in

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Effects of leaf water deficit and increase in endogenous ABA on
   photosynthesis of two tropical trees, Acacia confusa and Leucaena
   leucocephala, were investigated with two soil-drying methods, i.e. half
   or whole root system was subjected to soil drying. Half-root drying was
   achieved by allowing upper layer of soil column to dry and lower layer
   of soil column to remain watered. Half-root drying had little effect on
   leaf water potential, but when compared to the well-watered control,
   both methods of soil drying substantially increased the ABA
   concentration in xylem and reduced leaf conductance in both species.
   There was a significant relationship between leaf conductance and xylem
   ABA concentrations in both species, which was comparable to the same
   relationship that was generated by feeding ABA to excised twigs. The
   rate of photosynthesis was inhibited substantially in both soil-drying
   treatments and in both species, but photochchemical efficiency, measured
   as a ratio of variable fluorescence to a peak fluorescence emission of a
   dark-adapted leaf (F-nu/F-m), was not reduced except in the whole
   root-dried L. leucocephala plants where leaf water potential was reduced
   to -2.5 MPa. In all the cases where photosynthesis was inhibited, there
   was a concomitant reduction in both leaf conductance and calculated
   internal CO2 concentration. After two days of rewatering, leaf water
   potential and xylem ABA concentration rapidly returned to pre-treatment
   levels, but leaf conductance and photosynthesis of both whole-root and
   half root dried L. leucocephala remained inhibited substantially
   Rewatering led to a full recovery of both stomatal conductance and
   photosynthesis in soil-dried A. confusa, although its photosynthesis of
   whole-root dried plants did not recover fully but such difference was
   not significant statistically. These results suggest that
   drought-induced decline of photosynthesis was mainly a result of the
   stomatal factor caused by the increase of ABA concentration in the xylem
   sap. Non-stomatal factors, e.g. reduced photochemical activity and/or
   carbon metabolic activity, were species-specific and were brought about
   only at very low water potential.},

   kinetics were estimated at 90 days. The proteolytic bacteria were higher
   (P < 0.05) on CC-GO than CC-LL diet, while the other groups of bacteria,
   protozoa and fungi were comparable on both diets. The population of
   entodiniomorphs and holotrichs contributed 77.8 and 22.2\% of the total
   protozoa on CC-LL and CC-GO diet, respectively. Occurrence (\%) of
   isotricha and entodinium was highest, while occurrence of polyplastron
   and ophryoscolex genera was the least in rumen liquor of goats on both

Abstract = {The feasibility and efficacy of inoculating with rumen fluid as a method
   to control hydroxypyridone (DHP) toxicity in ruminants on high leucaena
   diets in eastern Indonesia were investigated. Rumen fluid collected from
   2 buffalo identified as `protected', due to low levels of DHP excretion
   in urine, was orally administered to animals identified as `unprotected'
   and concentrations of urinary DHP monitored. Control animals were dosed
   with water only. Treatments were randomly allocated to 10 recipient
   animals: 3 goats and 7 cattle. All animals were fed a diet containing
   freshly cut 100\% leucaena during the 18 day study period. Measurement
   of urinary DHP via colorimetric analysis commenced 8 days prior to
   animals being drenched with rumen fluid or water and continued for 10
   days afterwards. Urinary DHP levels in animals that received the
   inoculum did not differ from those in the control group 10 days
   post-inoculation (mean 425 mg DHP/L; P = 0.50). Unexpectedly, DHP levels
   in all animals (rumen fluid and water) declined with time, although the
   difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.12), and
   remained above considered safe threshold levels. These results suggest
   that transfer of rumen fluid to overcome leucaena toxicity in animals in
   eastern Indonesia may not be effective despite great care having been
   taken to ensure the viability of the anaerobic organisms during the
   inoculation process; this methodology is also not a practical solution
   to replicate on a commercial scale. The findings suggest that
   inoculation may not be necessary if animals previously naive to leucaena
   are able to adapt to DHP toxicity by other means.},

Abstract = {The objective of this experiment was to determine effects of Leucaena
   silage (LS) feeding on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and rumen
   fermentation in dairy steers. Four rumen fistulated dairy steers, 167
   +/- 12 kg body weight (BW), were randomly assigned to receive dietary
   treatments according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Treatments were as
   follows: T1 = 100 \% untreated rice straw (RS), T2 = 70 \% RS + 30 \%
   LS, T3 = 40 \% RS + 60 \% LS, and T4 = 100 \% LS, respectively. All
   animals were fed rice straw and LS ad libitum with concentrate mixture
   supplemented at 0.2 \% BW. The results found that dry matter intake and
   nutrient digestibility were the highest in dairy steers fed 60 \% LS (P
   < 0.05). Ruminal temperature and pH were not affected by LS feeding (P >
   0.05) while ruminal ammonia nitrogen and blood urea nitrogen
   concentration were linearly increased with increasing levels of LS
   feeding (P < 0.01). On the other hand, total volatile fatty acids and
   propionate (C-3) were improved by LS feeding especially in steers fed 60
   \% LS (P < 0.05) whereas acetate (C-2) production and C-2/C-3 ratio were
   decreased. Moreover, methane production was reduced together with
   increasing LS feeding level (P < 0.05). Based on this study, it could be
   concluded that 60 \% LS feeding could enhance feed intake,
   digestibility, and rumen fermentation end-product while reducing methane
   production in dairy steers. This study suggested that LS could be used
   as high-quality roughage for ruminant feeding in the tropical region.},

   (SAM) or their equal combination (LS). For the growth trial (Experiment
   1), 12 male FT sheep with mean initial body weight (BW) of 17.0 +/- 1.0
   kg (mean +/- SD) were randomly assigned to one of four dietary
   treatments in a Completely Randomized Design. The diets were
   Urea-treated RS (UTS) (Control), RS + L (LEU), RS + S (SAM), and RS +
   50\% L + 50\% S (LS). After 14 d of adjustment period, feed intakes and
   refusals were recorded daily, whereas BW was recorded bi-weekly for 12
   wk. Four rams weighing 17.0 +/- 1.0 kg BW were randomly assigned to the
   four treatments over a four period in a repeated (4 x 4) Latin square
   design to estimate the nitrogen (N) balance study (Experiment 2).
   Treatment diets were the same as that of Experiment 1. Dry matter intake
   of straw was highest (P = 0.0001) for sheep fed UTS. However, combining
   L with S increased (P = 0.0001) straw DM intake compared to feeding L or
   S alone. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in total feed
   intake between sheep offered UTS and LS, but both were significantly
   higher (P = 0.0001) than those offered LEU and SAM. Body weight gain
   (3.70 kg) and growth rate (196.15 g/d) were highest (P = 0.0001) for
   sheep offered LS compared to the other treatment groups. Values for N
   balance differed (P = 0.0001) among treatment diets. N balance for LUE
   and LS supplemented diets were higher than that of SAM but all were
   higher (P = 0.0001) than those offered UTS. Leucaena and Samanea leaves
   could, therefore, be utilized as supplement to poor-quality straws to
   improve the productivity of small ruminants especially during the long
   dry seasons in the tropics.},

Title = {Seed rain along a gradient of degradation in Caribbean dry forest:
   Effects of dispersal limitation on the trajectory of forest recovery},

Abstract = {Questions Tropical dry forests that experience severe disturbances
   (e.g., fires) often remain degraded for long time periods, during which
   non-native grasses and trees dominate. One barrier to native tree
   regeneration in degraded areas may be seed dispersal limitation. To
   better understand how dispersal limitation influences recovery from
   degradation, we tested whether the mode and rates of seed dispersal
   differed in degraded sites dominated either by the exotic tree Leucaena
   leucocephala or open areas dominated by introduced pasture grasses. We
   also tested whether L. leucocephala stands facilitate the recruitment of
   native trees by increasing their seed input compared to open grass
   areas. Location Guanica Commonwealth Forest, Puerto Rico. Methods Seed
   rain was measured for one year in traps located within five vegetation
   types that ranged in degree of forest degradation from open grass to
   intact native forest. Results In open grass areas, seed rain density was
   similarly low for L. leucocephala and abiotically dispersed native trees
   (mean {[}95\% CI] = 50.9 {[}15.1-171.0] vs. 34.2 {[}10.3-113.5] seeds
   m(-2) year(-1)), whereas it was even lower for animal-dispersed native
   trees (0.14 {[}0.03-0.67] seeds m(-2) year(-1)). Compared to open grass
   areas, L. leucocephala-dominated stands, even those with grass
   understories, had higher seed rain density of animal-dispersed trees
   (43.0 {[}12.9-143.6] seeds m(-2) year(-1)), but not abiotically
   dispersed trees (20.8 {[}6.3-68.5] seeds m(-2) year(-1)). Conclusions
   The dominance of L. leucocephala in disturbed Caribbean dry forests does
   not appear to be mediated by disproportionate seed arrival in open areas
   compared to native tree seeds. Rather, subsequent factors such as seed
   and seedling survival likely favor L. leucocephala in highly degraded
   areas. Since L. leucocephala stands increase the seed rain of
   animal-dispersed native trees, retaining them in highly disturbed
   Caribbean dry forests may facilitate the regeneration of native forests.},

Abstract = {The effects of dietary leucaena leaf meal on reproductive performance
   and growth of Nile tilapia were determined. In the preliminary trial,
   sexually mature Nile tilapia were fed with a control diet or a test diet
   which had leucaena leaf meal as the only protein source for 24 weeks.
   Fish fed with the leucaena diet lost some weight and had significantly
   low (P < 0.05) gonadosomatic index and fry production compared to those
   fed with the control diet. Subsequently, four isonitrogenous diets (20\%
   crude protein) containing varying amounts of leucaena leaf meal (0, 20,
   40 and 80\%) were fed to Nile tilapia broodstock. Mean weight gain of
   teh female fish decreased as the level of leucaena leaf meal in the
   diets increased. Females fed with the 80\% leucaena diet invariably lost
   weight. Mean weight gain of males fed with the control diet and the 20
   and 40\% leucaena diets did not differ significantly (P > 0.05).
   However, growth of males fed with the 80\% leucaena diet was remarkably
   low. Fry production was highest for those fed with the control diet and
   the 20\% leucaena diet. Fry production decreased slightly in fish fed
   with the 40\% leucaena diet and was significantly low (P < 0.05) for
   those fed with the 80\% leucaena diet. The low fry production was
   preceded by a decrease in body weight of the female fish. However, the
   gonadosomatic indices of the females and the males were not markedly
   affected by the diets. On the basis of both fry production and growth,
   leucaena leaf meal should not exceed 40\% of the diet of Nile tilapia
   broodstock.},

Abstract = {Scanty information on long-term soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics
   hampers validation of SOC models in the tropics. We observed SOC content
   changes in a 16-year continuously cropped agroforestry experiment in
   Ibadan, south-western Nigeria. SOC levels declined in all treatments.
   The decline was most pronounced in the no-tree control treatments with
   continuous maize and cowpea cropping, where SOC levels dropped from the
   initial 15.4 to 7.3-8.0 Mg C ha(-1) in the 0-12 cm topsoil in 16 years.
   In the two continuously cropped alley cropping (AC) systems, one with
   Leucaena leucocephala and one with Senna siamea trees, SOC levels
   dropped to 10.7-13.2 Mg C ha(-1). Compared to the no-tree control
   treatments. an annual application of an additional 8.5 Mg ha(-1) (dry
   matter) of plant residues, mainly tree prunings, led to an extra 3.5 Mg
   C ha(-1) (similar to0.2\% C) in the 0-12 cm top soil after I I years,
   and 4.1 Mg C ha(-1) after 16 years. The addition of NPK fertilizer had
   little effect on the quantities of above-ground plant residues returned
   to the soil, and there was no evidence that the fertilizer affected the
   rate of SOC decomposition. The fact that both C-3 and C-4 plants
   returned organic matter to the soil in all cropping systems, but in
   contrasting proportions, led to clear contrasts in the C-13 abundance in
   the SOC. This C-13 information, together with the measured SOC contents,
   was used to test the ROTHC model. Decomposition was very fast,
   illustrated by the fact that we had to double all decomposition rate
   constants in the model in order to simulate the measured contrasts in
   SOC contents and delta(13)C between the AC treatments and the no-tree
   controls. We hypothesized (1) that the pruning materials from the legume
   trees and/or the extra rhizodeposition from the tree roots in the AC
   treatments accelerated the decomposition of the SOC present at the start
   of the experiment (true C-priming), and/or (2) that the physical
   protection of microbial biomass and metabolites by the clay fraction on
   this site, having a sandy top soil in which clay minerals are mainly of
   the 1: 1 type, is lower than assumed by the model. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {We developed site-specific allometric models for Leucaena leucocephala x
   pallida var. KX2 trees in a shaded coffee agroecosystem in Hawaii to
   predict above- and belowground biomass and the regrowth potential of
   pollarded trees. Models were used to compare tree growth rates in an
   experimental agroforestry system with different pollarding frequencies
   and additions of tree pruning residues as mulch. For all allometric
   equations, a simple power model (Y = aX(b)) provided the optimal
   prediction of biomass or regrowth after pollarding. For aboveground
   biomass components (stem, branches, leaves, and seed and pods), stem
   diameter alone was the best predictor variable. Stump diameter provided
   the best prediction of coarse root biomass and aboveground regrowth
   after pollarding. Predictions of biomass from generalized allometric
   models often fell outside the 95\% confidence intervals of our
   site-specific models, especially as biomass increased. The combination
   of pollarding trees once per year plus the addition of tree mulch
   resulted in the greatest aboveground regrowth rates as well as
   accumulation of biomass and C in the stump plus coarse roots. Although
   optimal prediction required the development of site-specific allometric
   relationships, a simple power model using stem or stump diameter alone
   can provide an accurate assessment of above- and belowground tree
   biomass, as well as regrowth potential under specific management
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {Purpose Giant leucaena is a tropical tree-legume that thrives in
   alkaline and calcareous soils. It contains large amounts of mimosine,
   the physiological role of which is not well understood. The goals of
   this study were to determine i) if mimosine is released by giant
   leucaena into the rhizosphere ii) if mimosine enhances solubility of Fe
   present in various forms in alkaline soil, and iii) if mimosine enhances
   transition metal uptake in giant leucaena. Methods Mimosine in the
   extracts of rhizosphere soil and root exudates was analyzed by high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (LC/MS) to determine if it is released by giant leucaena.
   Iron concentration in tissue and aqueous samples was determined by
   ICP-OES analysis. Results Mimosine was detected in both the rhizosphere
   eluates and root exudates. Mimosine added to samples of goethite,
   hematite and FeCl3 increased Fe solubility in water. Giant leucaena
   plants grown in alkaline soils and supplied with mimosine had higher
   levels of chlorophyll, Fe and Mn than the control plants. Conclusion
   Mimosine is released by giant leucaena roots into the rhizosphere, where
   it interacts with Fe. Mimosine enhances solubility of insoluble
   Fe-oxides and prevents conversion of ferric Fe to insoluble oxides at an
   alkaline pH. Mimosine enhances Fe and Mn uptake in plants growing in
   alkaline soil conditions.},

Abstract = {Strain NGR234 produces highly mucoid (Muc+) colonies on laboratory media
   and induces nitrogen-fixing nodules on Leucaena plants. However, many
   transposon Tn5-induced exopolysaccharide mutants which were nonmucoid
   (Muc-) do not produce normal nodules on Leucaena plants. Instead, these
   Muc- (unconditional rough) mutants caused root hair curling and formed
   callus-like structures. When strain ANU265 (a Muc+ Sym plamsid-cured
   derivative of strain NGR234) was coinoculated with some Muc-
   callus-forming strains, normal nitrogen-fixing nodules (Nod+ Fix+) were
   formed. Both Muc- and Muc+ strains were present in the nitrogen-fixing
   nodules and no genetic exchange was detected between the strains.
   However, some Muc- strains, when coinoculated with ANU265, produced
   normal-sized nodules (instead of callus-like structures) that were
   unable to fix nitrogen. Examination by light microscopy of the
   callus-like structures produced by the Muc- (callus-forming) mutants on
   Leucaena  plants suggested that they are deformed nodules resulting from
   early inhibition of the normal infection process. Experiments with a
   specifically constructed transconjugant strain which produces varying
   amounts of exopolysaccharide (EPS) supports the conclusion that EPS is
   essential for correction of the nodulation behaviour of Muc- mutants.},

Abstract = {Botryococcus braunii is recognized as one of the most important
   microalgae species due to its high lipid content that may reach 75\% of
   its dry weight. This amount is relatively higher than that in other
   microalgae species, thus potentially exploitable for biofuel production.
   Culture media support the growth of this microalga to sustain its
   culture production. Leucaena leaves supernatant (LLS) has potential as
   natural growth culture supplement. The present study aims to analyse the
   best concentration of LLS with optimum light intensity as supplement for
   microalgae growth by using an experimental method. This study consisted
   of four treatments with three replications during 14 days of experiment
   or one cycle of growth phase of B. braunii. The concentrations of LLS on
   the treatment were 2.5, 7.5 and 12.5\%. The determination of light
   intensity for cultivation was based on the preliminary test, with 2500,
   5000 and 7500 Lux. The best growth-producing light intensity was used in

Abstract = {The taxonomical study of the external genitalia of the Heteropsylla
   cubana Crawford was conducted through periodical random samplings in
   sowings of L. leucocephala, located in different regions of the country
   and with different phenological statuses. Samples of infested growing
   shoots were taken and die winged animals were collected using a sweepnet
   Five samples were collected with 20 net sweeps each. In each sampling
   area, five specimens per sex were clarified and the genitalia of the
   females and the males were removed from the rest of the abdomen. The
   biological cycle was performed in laboratory conditions. Thirty Petri
   dishes were used as rearing units, with five repetitions in time. A
   recently emerged couple was introduced in each experimental unit and the
   morphological and behavioral changes in the different stages of the H.
   cubana were observed daily through the stereoscopic microscope. The
   position and dispersion statistics were determined for each indicator.
   The results demonstrated that all the psyllids collected in the adult
   stage in sowings of L. leucocephala in different regions of the country
   correspond to H. cubana. The polymorphism in the nymph and the adult
   populations of H. cubana was evident. The dimensions of the insect vary
   in each stage. In the egg stage, they measured approximately 0.6 mm of
   length and 0.3 mm of width. The nymph stage starts with similar
   dimensions to those of the eggs, up to 1.4 mm of length and 0.7 mm of
   width, approximately. In the adults, the dimensions range from 1.5 to 2
   nun of length, with average duration of 17 d for the adult-egg cycle.
   The values in the periods of pre-oviposition, oviposition and
   post-oviposition were in the interval from two to three days. The
   influence of the temperature on the length of the biological cycle of
   the insect was demonstrated. It is concluded that Heteropsylla cubana
   Crawford was the species found in the areas of L. leucocephala in the
   different regions sampled in Cuba. Its life cycle is composed of five
   nymph stages, with average egg-adult duration of 17 d. The periods of
   pre-oviposition, oviposition and post-oviposition were between two and
   three days, favourable range for the adequate reproduction of the
   insect. Further taxonomical and biological studies are recommended as
   basis for the diagnosis of the species, as well as the perfection of the
   sampling methodology. Besides, the proliferation of adults should be
   considered. All these aspects are indispensable tools for establishing
   alternatives to standardize the insect management.},

Abstract = {Four types of biochars were prepared from rice husk as farm waste,
   sugarcane bagasse as sugar cane juice store waste, residues of Leucaena
   leucocephala tree as horticulture waste and chicken manure as chicken
   farm reduce at 700(omicron)C, then evaluated as a alternative to control
   Tribolium castaneum, Rhyzopertha dominica, Oryzaephlius surinamensis and
   Sitophilus oryzae. The character of each type has been defined using
   Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with an Energy Dispersive X-Ray
   Analysis (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were
   used to identify the elemental composition and functional groups
   distributed on biochars surface. The elemental compositions refer to the
   chicken manure biochar exhibited a decrease in Carbon concentration and
   increase Oxygen content; there is a negative correlation between C and O
   contents. On the other hand, the chicken manure biochar is the only
   tested biochar that contains Ca, P, and Cl. The chicken manure biochar
   has the largest number of functional groups on its surface, the
   mortality of insects was recorded after 10 days which showed that the
   chicken manure biochar was the most effective which contains more
   different elements and functional groups on its surface. The most
   affected insects were O.surinamensis and R. dominica with mortality
   percentages 86.66 and 73.33. Smaller particles of chicken manure biochar
   were more effective than larger particles against both R. dominica and
   O. surinamensis, the smaller particles (1.80-0.94 mu m) recorded LC50
   1.29 and 0.56 g/kg against R. dominica and O. surinamensis. SEM images
   for the affected insects showed the adhesion of biochar particles on
   insect's body parts, also, the sensilla were disappeared as a result of
   the friction between biochar particles and insect cuticle. Our results
   may indicate the promising features of biochar as an alternative method
   to control some stored product insects with considering the source of
   biochar which affect its elemental and functional groups contents.
   Biochar had different efficacy depending upon its moisture contents,
   with increased moisture the toxicity of biochar decreased.},

Abstract = {In the Gambia, groundnut hay (GNH) and sesame seed cake (SSC) are used
   as supplements for the feeding of rams under grazing and zero-grazing
   conditions. Although GNH is widely available, there are periodic
   shortages of SSC. Therefore, two experiments were conducted during the
   dry season to study the potential of using the protein-rich leaves of
   trees as an alternative feed source to supplement grazing or confined
   rams. The objective of the first experiment was to investigate the
   effects of supplementing food with Leucaena leucocephela (leucaena),
   Gliricidia sepium (gliricidia), or GNH on the daily liveweight gain
   (DLWG) of grazing rams, The average DLWG for the groups that were fed
   leucaena, gliricidia, and GNH during the first 28 days of the trial were
   51.8, 61.9, and 79.8 g/day, respectively. At 48 days, average DLWGs were
   53.47 and 57.99 g/day for the leucaena-and GNH-fed groups. The second
   trial examined the performance of rams fed GNH ad libitum and
   supplemented with two levels of SSC, leucaena, or gliricidia to provide
   15 or 30 g crude protein/day. The rams supplemented with the higher
   level of gliricidia attained the highest DLWG at 83.73 g/day, whereas
   those supplemented with the lower level of SSC had the lowest level of
   DLWG at 68.25 g/day. The six treatment means were not significantly
   different. Because DLWG values with tree foliage were comparable to
   those obtained with traditional feed sources, appropriate methods of
   integrating leucaena and gliricidia in traditional sheep production
   systems should be explored.},

   forages during the dry season, that of Fe, Mn and Zn increased.
   Different patterns were observed with regard to age and season
   interaction effects. Within each season, concentration of the mineral
   either increased with age (Ca, Na), declined with age (K, P) or
   increased and then declined (Mg, Zn, Cu). Regardless of these
   fluctuations, the levels of all minerals except P and Cu were
   sufficiently high to meet estimated livestock requirements. In
   situations where the forages are fed exclusively, supplementary P and Cu
   would be required and Ca:P ratios corrected.},

Abstract = {Field microplot experiments were conducted in the semi-arid tropics of

   growth to addition of N fertilizer and plant residues and to examine the
   fate of fertilizer N-15 in a leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) alley
   cropping system, in which supplemental irrigation was used. Leucaena
   prunings, maize residues and N fertilizer were applied to alley-cropped
   maize grown in microplots which were installed in the alleys formed by
   leucaena hedgerows spaced 4.5 metres apart. The N-15-labelled fertilizer
   was used to examine the fate of fertilizer N applied in the presence of
   mulched leucaena prunings and maize residues.
   Application of leucaena prunings increased maize yield while addition of
   N fertilizer in the presence of the prunings produced a further increase
   in maize production. There was a significant positive interaction
   between N fertilizer and leucaena prunings in increasing maize
   production. The addition of maize residues in the presence of N
   fertilizer and leucaena prunings decreased maize yield and N uptake and
   increased fertilizer N-15 loss from 38\% to 47\%. Maize recovered
   24-79\% of fertilizer N-15 in one cropping season, depending on
   application rate of N fertilizer and field management of plant residues.
   About 20-34\% of fertilizer N-15 remained in the soil. More than 37\% of
   fertilizer N-15 was apparently lost from the soil and plant system
   largely through denitrification when N fertilizer was applied at 40 kg N
   ha-1 or more in the presence or absence of plant residues. Application
   of N fertilizer improved maize yield and increased the contribution of
   mulched leucaena prunings to crop production in the alley cropping

   by the separation process of the oil by using silica gel column
   chromatography with different solvents then classified into different
   lipid classes (neutral lipids /NL, glycolipids/GL, and

Abstract = {Green chemistry methods are now an intriguing field of study in
   agriculture, particularly in pest management. For this reason, novel
   approachesfor the moreefficient manufacturing of nanoparticles with
   improved biological characteristics have been developed. Because
   nanoparticle production is faster, this method is more eco-friendly and
   less toxic than old methods. The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles
   (AgNPs) using Leucaena leucocephala, Mentha aquatica, and Zingiber
   officinale extracts and their antibacterial activity against
   Pectobacterium cartovorum, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Xanthomonas
   axonopodis. The results showed that spectroscopic and microscopic
   methods, such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealed absorption peaks for
   Ll-AgNPs at 415 nm, 420 nm for Ma-AgNPs, and 430 nm for Zo-AgNPs,
   indicating the silver nature of the prepared colloidal samples. The TEM
   images revealed the quasi-spherical morphology of NPs with an average
   size of 12.51, 10.63, and 10.26 nm for Ll-AgNPs, Ma-AgNPs, and Zo-AgNPs.
   The Xray diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed a face-centered cubic (FCC)
   structure with crystallite. While distinctive peaks in an investigation
   using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy showed that
   several biomolecules were attachedto AgNPs, antibacterial activity was
   evaluated by an inhibitory zone test, which showed high efficiency
   against P. cartovorum, A. tumefaciens, and X. axonopodis, with an
   antibacterial function comparable to L. leucocephala, M. aquatica, and
   Z. officinale extract. The green production of silver nanoparticles has
   the potential to be a useful tool in pest management strategies against

Abstract = {Quantifying the size and turnover of physically uncomplexed soil organic
   matter (SOM) is crucial for the understanding of nutrient cycling and
   storage of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the C and nitrogen (N)
   dynamics of SOM fractions in leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala)-grass
   pastures remains unclear. We assessed the potential of leucaena to
   sequester labile, free light fraction (fLF) C and N in soil by
   estimating the origin, quantity and vertical distribution of physically
   unprotected SOM. The soil from a chronosequence of seasonally grazed
   leucaena stands (0-40 years) was sampled to a depth of 0.2m and soil and
   fLF were analysed for organic C, N and delta C-13 and delta N-15. On
   average, the fLF formed 20\% of SOC and 14\% of total N stocks in the
   upper 0.1m of soil from leucaena rows and showed a peak of fLF-C and
   fLF-N stocks in the 22-year-stand. The fLF delta C-13 and fLF delta N-15
   values indicated that leucaena produced 37\% of fLF-C and 28\% of fLF-N
   in the upper 0.1m of soil from leucaena rows. Irrespective of pasture
   type or soil depth, the majority of fLF-C originated from the
   accompanying C-4 pasture-grass species. This study suggests that fLF-C
   and fLF-N, the labile SOM, can form a significant portion of total SOM,
   especially in leucaena-grass pastures.},

Abstract = {Mice fed a diet containing 1\% (wt/wt) 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone (DHP)
   developed goiter even with a diet high in I, whereas mimosine (0.5\%
   wt/wt) did not produce goiter even with a low-I diet. Thyroid
   enlargement was apparent (measured morphometrically) by the 7th wk and
   was advanced by the 11th wk. Histologically the goiter was hyperplastic.
   No marked histological changes were found in other organs of mice fed
   DHP or any organs of mice fed mimosine, except for some atrophy of hair
   follicles. A single intragastric dose of DHP inhibited the uptake of
   125I by the thyroid in the rat but an equivalent dose of mimosine did
   not. The inhibition apparently occurs at the I binding step, as with
   methyl thiouracil, rather than at the I trapping step, as with
   thiocyanate. Chronic treatment of mice with DHP, as with 6-methyl
   thiouracil, increased the avidity of the thyroid in taking up 125I. The
   major conjugated form of DHP in mammals, DHP-3-O-glucuronide, was almost
   as effective a goitrogen as the unconjugated compound when given orally,
   but considerably less active than the free form in the blood stream. DHP
   is a potent antithyroid compound of the thiouracil type with low general
   toxicity, since mammals can tolerate a level of intake sufficient to
   produce goiter in spite of I supplementation. {[}This study is relevant
   to feed toxicity to cattle and sheep.].},

Abstract = {To examine the effect of biological invasion by early-successional
   exotic plant species on the secondary succession of native plant
   species, we compared secondary forests with and without koa haole
   invasion, which became established in fields that were abandoned for 55
   yr on Chichi-jima and Haha-jima in the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, in the
   northwestern Pacific. A comparison of the forest structure and the
   composition of secondary forest showed that the species richness of
   native plant species was significantly lower, and the basal area of
   late-successional alien plants (bischofia and Korean mulberry) was
   significantly larger in secondary forests with koa haole invasion than
   in those without koa haole invasion. The secondary forests in areas that
   had been invaded by koa haole had a significantly smaller basal area of
   native plant species and a greater area of late-successional alien
   plants in the understory than those in areas that had not been invaded
   by koa haole. These results suggest that in the Ogasawara Islands, the
   native species are incapable of replacing dense koa haole thickets
   directly and that invasion by koa haole promotes invasion and
   establishment of more aggressive alien plant species. Consequently, the
   invasion and expansion of koa haole has had a severe effect on the
   native plant community in the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands and may alter
   the secondary succession.},

Year = {1991},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-40},
Abstract = {In a series of pre-screening trials and experiments five different
   inexpensive and readily available materials were tested for their
   capability to effectively prevent or reduce destructive browsing by
   livestock and game on woody perennials in their early stage after
   planting.  These materials were fluffed-up sheep wool, sisal fibres,
   fibres from pods of the Kapok tree (Ceiba pentandra), extracts from the
   fruits of Solanum campylacanthum and the latex of Euphorbia tirucalli. 
   In all trials and experiments Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Witt was
   used as the test plant.  In a first trial, concentrated Solanum fruit
   extract damaged terminal buds and mature leaves of L. leucocephala. 
   After diluting the extract with water (2 parts extract:  1 part water)
   no further damaging effect on leaves and buds was observed.  All treated
   parts of the test plant proved tolerant to latex of Euphorbia tirucalli.
   In a subsequent short-term (24 hours) pre-screening of the five
   repellents in which three goats in an enclosure of 5 x 10 m were used as
   test animals, all but the latex of Euphorbia tirucalli showed promise as
   effective repellents and this was excluded from subsequent experiments. 
   The four materials were then exposed to two consecutive larger-scale
   experiments.  In spite of the deliberately increased stocking rate (8
   goats on 0.7 ha and 5 goats on 0.45 ha) and the removal of all
   alternative browse, all four repellents proved to have a retarding
   effect on browsing.  However, fluffed-up sheep wool and, to a lesser
   extent, fibres from pods of the Kapok tree showed the most promising
   results.},

Abstract = {Grass pasture rundown results from a depleted store of soil mineral
   nitrogen (N) over time. In these systems, mineral N is retained in the
   standing plant biomass, and/or immobilized in the soil organic matter.
   Leucaena leucocephala spp. glabrata is a leguminous shrub which is
   incorporated into grazing systems to provide a high protein fodder for
   beef cattle production. Leucaena can also enhance the soil N status
   through biological N-2 fixation and easily mineralisation of labile
   leucaena residues. However, there is limited information on the soil N
   dynamics of leucaena-grass system especially in the subsoil layers of
   the soil profile, including the primary N source for leucaena, and the
   effect of leucaena residue on accompanying green panic (Panicum maximum
   van trichoglume). We quantified the effect of pasture-type, soil-type
   and leucaena stand age on soil N stocks and delta N-15 values at
   different depths. A chronosequence of leucaena stands (0-40 years) and
   paired grass sites were sampled to 1.0 m depth. Using the delta N-15
   natural abundance technique, it was estimated that 73\% of leucaena N
   originated from atmospheric N-2-fixation. Total soil N stocks were 45\%
   higher beneath leucaena rows compared to the paired grass sites at 0-0.1
   m depth. In addition, total soil N stocks increased by 32\% in the
   surface at 0-0.3 m depth, attaining a maximum in the 40-year old stand.
   The N dynamics beneath the leucaena rows and mid-rows suggest a tight
   cycling of available N within the system. This study further highlights
   the importance of incorporating legumes into grazing systems to increase
   plant available N and mitigate pasture rundown.},

Abstract = {The potential of alley cropping systems supplied with a limited amount
   of fertilizer to restore crop productivity on a degraded site and to
   maintain crop productivity on a recently cleared, non-degraded site on
   `terre de barre' soils in Southern Benin was investigated from 1994 to
   1996. Leucaena leucocephala, Senna siamea and Gliricidia sepium were
   used as hedgerow species. Maize yields of the no-tree control plots
   dropped from the initial (1990) 401 kg ha(-1) and 2181 kg ha(-1) on the
   degraded and non-degraded sites, respectively, to 109 kg ha(-1) and 1346
   kg ha(-1) in 1996, even with application of a minimal amount of mineral
   fertilizer. The alley cropping systems produced on average (mean of
   three treatments and three years) 107\% more grain than the initial 1990
   values on the degraded site and 11\% less grain than the initial 1990
   values on the non-degraded site. Especially the Senna and to a lesser
   degree the Leucaena treatment yielded consistently more grain than the
   control. The Senna trees contained a larger amount of N and produced
   more wood during the first pruning on the degraded site (155 kg N ha(-1)
   and 14.0 ton fresh wood ha-(1)) than on the non-degraded site (49 kg N
   ha(-1) and 6.6 ton fresh wood ha(-1)) most likely because of differences
   in subsoil fertility, as indicated by the higher clay, exchangeable
   bases, and N content between 60 and 125 cm cm. N accumulation and wood
   production by the Leucaena and Gliricidia trees was similar in both
   sites (82 and 36 kg N ha(-1) and 4.6 and 9.3 ton fresh wood ha(-1),
   respectively). When a limited amount of fertilizer is available, Senna
   appears to be the best choice as hedgerow species on sites with a
   relatively fertile subsoil. For other soils, a N-2-fixing species may be
   a better choice.},

Abstract = {An assessment of ethanol production potential from dedicated energy
   crops was conducted for the State of Hawaii considering lands, crop
   species, and conversion technologies. Evaluation of the spatial
   distributions of soil types, zoning, and annual rainfall was conducted
   using geographic information system data. Saccharum officinarum
   (sugarcane), Pennisetum purpureum (banagrass), Leucaena leucocephala,
   and Eucalyptus grandis were selected as potential feedstocks for
   sugar-based and lignocellulosic ethanol production. The analysis shows
   that only one cropping scenario applied to all available agriculturally
   zoned lands in the state would be capable of producing enough ethanol to
   meet the state's current motor gasoline consumption on an energy
   equivalent basis. State goals of displacing 20\% (volume) of highway
   fuels by 2020 could be met by 14 of the 16 cropping and land use
   combinations. This indicates that the State of Hawaii could promote
   energy diversification through its choice of land leases. Distribution
   of suitable lands among islands is not consistent with motor fuel
   demand, suggesting that provisions must be made to support development
   of adequate storage and harbor facilities to enable movement of fuel
   between points of production and use. Comparison of possible production
   volumes with economic plant sizes indicates that sufficient feedstocks
   could be available on Maui, Hawaii, Oahu, and Kauai to realize economies
   of scale in production facilities. This study should be refined in the
   future to adequately address issues of environmental preservation, water
   consumption, and land use to provide additional guidance for policy and
   economic decision making. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   gained 67.1\% more weight during the dry season whereas only 34.1\% more
   weight was gained during the rainy season in comparison to the control
   group. Average weekly milk production in the goats receiving supplements
   was almost double that produced by the control group in dry season (361
   I I g versus 183 43 g) and about 32\% more milk was produced during the
   rainy season. There was a positive correlation between weight gain and
   milk production which was highest in the group receiving supplements
   during the dry season (r(2) = 0.96). This study has revealed that the
   reproductive performance, milk production and kid growth will be greatly
   improved in the WADG when the feed from natural pasture is supplemented
   with the leaves of C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {A random block design with six replications was used to study different
   methods for stimulating the asexual reproduction of Leucaena
   leucocaphala cv Peru. The experiment lasted five months The first
   treatment consisted of mixing 200 mg indoloacetic acid and 300 mg
   naphthalenacetic acid with 1 kg of zeolite powder (F-ICA-1). In the
   second experiment, 200 mg indoloacetic acid and 1000 mg naphthalenacetic
   acid were mixed with zeolite (F-ICA-2). There was a control treatment
   with zeolite only. At the end of the experiment, the aerial parts of the
   plant showed an inverse performance to that of the roots in stimulant
   concentrations. The length of regrowths was 28.8 cm and DM yield was
   32.81 g with F-ICA-2, No root development was observed. The values with
   F-ICA1 formula were 3.09 cm and 14.8 g DM respectively. Five roots and
   20 small roots 20 cm in length and a DM yield of 8.4 g were formed. The
   treatment with no auxins showed the poorest performance in all the
   indicators studied. It is concluded that a lower concentration of
   F-ICA-1 produced a more integral biological result. However, a longer
   duration experiment under field conditions, including a control with
   botanical seeds, is necessary.},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted for eight cropping seasons from 1988 to
   1991 in semiarid Machakos, Kenya, to compare the productivity of shrubs
   and crops in intercropping (alleycropping) versus block (sole) planting
   systems. The study, conducted in a split-plot experiment with three
   replications, consisted of two tree species (Leucaena leucocephala and
   Senna siamea syn. Cassia siamea) in the main-plots and combinations of
   two planting systems (alleycropping and block planting of the shrubs and
   maize) with five different ratios of land allocation for the shrub and
   crop (100:0, 15:85, 20:80, 25:75, and 0:100) in sub-plots. Thus, a sole
   maize and a sole tree were included in the subplot treatments. The
   spacing between hedgerows of shrubs in intercropping was 6.7, 5, and 4
   m, respectively, corresponding to 15, 20, and 25\% land allocation to
   shrubs. The trees were pruned to 0.5 m height four times a year.
   Intercropped hedgerows of senna and leucaena produced 10\% and 24\% more
   biomass than their respective block planting systems. On average,
   leucaena produced more biomass than senna. Maize alleycropped with
   leucaena yielded 16\% less grain than sole-crop maize, whereas senna
   intercropping caused hardly any maize-yield reduction. Compared with the
   respective sole-crop systems, leucaena intercropping did not affect land
   equivalent ratio (LER), whereas LER increased by 28\% with senna
   intercropping. The different tree:crop land occupancy ratios did not
   affect the production of either the component species or of the total
   system, except that LER declined with increased spacing between
   hedgerows. It is concluded that in semiarid highlands of Kenya, leucaena
   and crops should better be grown in sole blocks, not in alleycropping.
   In the case of slow-growing species such as senna, intercropping is
   worthwhile to consider only if the additional labour needed does not
   pose a serious problem for management, and the species has fodder value.},

Abstract = {A greenhouse investigation was undertaken to determine the influence of
   fresh organic matter on the formation and functioning of
   vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in Leucaena leucocephala
   grown in an acid aluminum-rich ultisol. In soil not amended with fresh
   organic matter or lime, plants failed to grow. Mycorrhizal infection
   level, mycorrhizal effectiveness measured in terms of pinnule P content
   of L. leucocephala leaves and dry matter yield of the legume increased
   with increase in fresh organic matter. Although VAM colonization level
   and dry matter yield of L. leucocephala were significantly higher if the
   test soil was limed (7.2 cmole OH-) than if amended with fresh organic
   matter, the latter was as effective as lime in off-setting the
   detrimental effect of aluminum on mycorrhizal effectiveness. The lower
   mycorrhizal colonization level and the lower dry matter yield noted in
   the soil treated with fresh organic matter appears to be related to the
   inadequacy of Ca in the soil amended with fresh organic matter. These
   observations are supported by the low calcium status of soil and plant
   tissues in the absence of lime. It is concluded that while fresh organic
   matter, in appropriate amounts, could protect sensitive plants and VAM
   symbiosis against Al toxicity in acid soils, maximum mycorrhizal
   inoculation effects are not likely to be attained unless the soils are
   also amended with Ca.},

Journal = {SOIL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {56},
Number = {6},
Pages = {632-647},
Abstract = {Stabilisation and protection of soil organic carbon (SOC) in
   macroaggregates and microaggregates represents an important mechanism
   for the sequestration of SOC. Legume-based grass pastures have the
   potential to contribute to aggregate formation and stabilisation,
   thereby leading to SOC sequestration. However, there is limited research
   on the C and N dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) fractions in
   deep-rooted legume leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala)-grass pastures. We
   assessed the potential of leucaena to sequester carbon (C) and nitrogen
   (N) in soil aggregates by estimating the origin, quantity and
   distribution in the soil profile. We utilised a chronosequence (0-40
   years) of seasonally grazed leucaena stands (3-6m rows), which were
   sampled to a depth of 0.3m at 0.1-m intervals. The soil was wet-sieved
   for different aggregate sizes (large macroaggregates, > 2000 mm; small
   macroaggregates, 250-2000 mm; microaggregates, 53-250 mm; and < 53 mm),
   including occluded particulate organic matter (oPOM) within
   macroaggregates (> 250 mm), and then analysed for organic C, N and delta
   C-13 and delta N-15. Leucaena promoted aggregation, which increased with
   the age of the leucaena stands, and in particular the formation of large
   macroaggregates compared with grass in the upper 0.2 m. Macroaggregates
   contained a greater SOC stock than microaggregates, principally as a
   function of the soil mass distribution. The oPOM-C and -N concentrations
   were highest in macroaggregates at all depths. The acid nonhydrolysable
   C and N distribution (recalcitrant SOM) provided no clear distinction in
   stabilisation of SOM between pastures. Leucaena-and possibly other
   legume-based grass pastures have potential to sequester SOC through
   stabilisation and protection of oPOM within macroaggregates in soil.},

Abstract = {The data presented here is the characteristics of biopellets and its raw
   materials. The raw materials of lignocellulosic waste (coffee skin,
   corncob, patchouli waste) and shrubs ( Leucaena leucocephala and
   Gliricidia sepium ) were collected from certain districts in Indonesia
   which provided quite abundant stocks of these raw materials. The raw
   material preparation and pelletization at room temperature (25 degrees
   C) using a manual press machine were carried out at Hasanudat high
   temperatures (225 degrees C) was carried out at The Integrated
   Laboratory of Forest Research and Development, Bogor, Indonesia. The
   evaluation of density, moisture content, volatile matter content, ash
   content, and amount of fixed carbon were also carried out at the
   laboratory. Meanwhile, evaluation of mineral content (sulfur, Na2O, K2
   O, Cl) and calorivic value was carried out at the Livestock Research
   Institute, Bogor, Indonesia. The results show that pelletization at high
   temperature produces better quality biopellets compared to pelletization
   at room temperature. Pelletization of L. leucocephala at high
   temperature produces the best quality biopellets with the highest
   density (1.17 g/cm(3) ) and calorific value (4726 kcal/kg) and the
   lowest moisture content (4.87 \%) and mineral content (0.01 \% of S,
   0.0014 \% of Na2O, 1.53 \% of I<2O, and 0.17 \% of Cl) among the other
   raw materials tested. This dataset is expected to be a primary source in
   comparing and determining the proper type of raw material for biopellet
   production as an alternative renewable energy source, es- pecially those
   originating from shrubs and similar lignocellulosic waste. (c) 2024 The

Abstract = {There are abundant local legume trees and shrubs potentially suitable
   for alley cropping systems in the sub-Saharan Africa, which are yet to
   be studied. The nitrogen contribution of two years old Albizia lebbeck
   and S. corymbosa to yield of maize grown in alley cropping was compared
   to that of Senna siamea, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala in
   four seasons at Ibadan. Maize shoot biomass and maize grain yield in A.
   lebbeck alley compared favourably with that in G. sepium and L.
   leucocephala. Maize biomass and grain yield in S. corymbosa alleys were
   the lowest. Within A. lebbeck, L. leucocpehala, and G. sepium alleys
   there were no significant differences in the maize yield in the alleys
   that received 0, 40 or 80 kg N/ha. Application of more than 40 kg N/ha
   in S. corymbosa alleys was not necessary as there was no significant
   increase in maize yield at the higher level of nitrogen. Maize yield and
   N uptake in A. lebbeck alleys were not significantly different from
   yield and N uptake in G. sepium, and L. leucocephala at the same
   fertilizer level. There was a significant correlation between hedgerow
   tree biomass and maize grain yield. At the end of twelve weeks after
   pruning application, the organic residues of the pruning applied in the
   alleys ranged from 5\% in G. sepium and 44\% in A. lebbeck in the first
   year compared with the original pruning applied which showed that the
   slow rate of A. lebbeck decomposition could have a beneficial effect on
   the soil. The maize N recovery from applied N fertilizer was low
   (10-22\%). Percentage N recovery from the prunings was low in the non-N
   fixing trees (12-22\%), while the recovery was high (49-59\%) in A.
   lebbeck as well as in the other nitrogen fixing tree prunings. Thus A.
   lebbeck, apart from enhancing maize growth and grain yield like in L.
   leucocephala and G. sepium, had an added advantage because it remained
   longer as mulching material on the soil because of its slow rate of
   decomposition. It was able to survive pruning frequencies with no
   die-back. This indicates that A. lebbeck is a good potential candidate
   for alley cropping system in West Africa. S. corymbosa performed poorly
   compared with the other legume trees. Though it responded to N
   fertilizer showing a positive interaction between the hedgerow and
   fertilizer application, it had a high die back rate following pruning
   periods and termite attack.},

   fixation in control plants of Acacia albida was 54.2 mg as measured with
   ARA, while it was 28.5 mg as measured with the N-15 dilution technique,
   compared to 30.7 mg calculated as accumulated N. In comparison, L.
   leucocephala fixed 41.6 mg N (ARA), 53.5 mg N (N-15 dilution technique)
   and 56.3 mg N (accumulated N). The Frankia-symbiosis had fixed 27.4 mg N
   as measured by ARA, 8.1 mg N as measured by N-15 dilution technique and
   12.3 mg N as accumulated N. There were no differences between the
   estimates based on traditional and modified ways of calculating N-15
   dilution.
   The immediate effect of water deficit treatment on N-2 fixation was
   continuously measured in all species with ARA, which started to decrease
   approximately 10 d after the initiation of the treatment, and declined
   to less than 5\% of the initial level after 21-28 d.
   The decrease in the amount of N derived from N-2 fixation was studied in
   L. leucocephala during the period of treatment. There was a 26\%
   decrease in amount of N derived from N-2 fixation as result of water
   deficit (as measured with ARA), while the decrease was 23\% when
   measured with both the N-15 dilution method and as accumulated N.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion has resulted in serious land degradation in Yuanmou dry-hot
   valley, Yunnan province, China. Vegetation restoration had been widely
   developed in this hot and arid area. In this work we investigate the
   quality of rhizosphere soils under four restoration species in the towns
   of Zuolin (gully bed) and Yuanma (slope area). The vegetation included
   two trees {[}Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. and Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis L.] for the slope area, one shrubland {[}Dodonaea viscosa
   (Linn.) Jacq. Enum.] and one native, natural grassland {[}Heteropogon
   contortus (L.) Beauv.] for gully bed. Soil physical (bulk density and
   soil moisture content), chemical {[}pH, soil organic matter, nitrogen
   (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) contents], and microbial
   (microbial biomass and microbe quantity) properties and soil enzyme
   (catalase, protease and urease) activities were determined. Compared to
   the soils collected from other vegetation types, the soil under Leucaena
   leucocephala had the highest content of soil organic matter, total N,
   available N, total P, available P, available K, microbial biomass carbon
   (C), and the highest microbe quantity and enzyme activities. Five
   parameters (organic matter, pH, microbial biomass N, total K and
   protease activity), which had the greatest weight in the principal
   components analysis, were selected to calculate the soil quality index
   (SQI). The final SQI values implied that restoring Leucaena leucocephala
   greatly improved the soil quality, while restoration with Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis decreased the soil quality of the slope area. Plant
   recovery with Dodonaea viscosa and Heteropogon contortus on the gully
   bed affected the population of soil microbial communities but didn't
   improve the SQI values. It can therefore be seen that types of plants
   used for recovery in gully-developed regions in dry-hot valleys must be
   chosen cautiously: Leucaena leucocephala is a good choice for soil
   revegetation of the slope area, but the revegetation patterns on the
   gully bed still need further study.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects on digestibility and growth when
   West African Dwarf (WAD) sheep were fed a basal diet of Tripsacum laxum
   with Leucaena leucocephala or dried poultry waste as supplement. Fifteen
   WAD sheep (12 rams and 3 ewes) were randomly allocated to three dietary
   treatments of 5 animals each, namely T1-basal diet of chopped T. laxum
   (control), T2-basal diet plus dried poultry waste, and T3-basal diet
   plus L. leucocephala. Animals had access to drinking water and a mineral
   mix ad libitum. They were weighed weekly after a 2-week adaptation
   period, for a duration of 12 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial,
   three rams randomly selected from each treatment group were used for the
   digestibility study. Results revealed that average daily intake of L.
   leucocephala (350.0 +/- 0.3 g/animal) was higher than that of dried
   poultry waste (260.0 +/- 0.1 g/animal). The supplemented groups, T2 and
   T3, gained 21.4 and 31.0 g daily respectively, while animals of the
   control group (T1) lost 6.0 g daily. There was a significant difference
   (P < 0.01) in dry matter intake between the control and supplemented
   groups, with T2 recording the highest intake. Organic matter intake of
   treatment 3 was significantly (P < 0.01) higher than that of T1 and T2.
   The differences in crude fibre (CF) ingestion between T2 and T1 as well
   as T3 and T1 were significant (P < 0.01), with the highest ingestion of
   CF occurring in T1. The dry matter digestibility of the supplemented
   groups was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the control. The
   organic matter digestibility of T2 and T3, as well as T1 and T3 were
   significantly different (P < 0.05), being highest in T3 (77.0 +/- 2.1
   \%) and lowest in T2 (58.1 +/- 1.0 \%) It was concluded from the study
   that T. laxum can be better utilized in West African Dwarf sheep when
   supplemented with dried poultry waste or L. leucocephala.},

Abstract = {Various combinations of a low-tannin herbaceous legume (Vigna
   Unguiculata) and foliage of tanniniferous shrub legumes (Calliandra
   calothyrsus, Flemingia macrophylla and Leucaena leucocephala) or a
   low-tannin shrub legume (Cratylia argentea), all mixed together with a
   low-quality tropical grass (Brachiaria humidicola), were tested in vitro
   for differences in the effects on ruminal fermentation. Two experiments
   with the gas transducer technique were carried out, where each forage
   mixture was tested either with or without polyethylene glycol in order
   to be able to identify tannin-related effects (n = 3). In Experiment 1,
   a stepwise replacement of V unguiculata by C. calothyrsus (5:0,4:1, 3:2,
   2:3, 1:4, 0:5) at a legume proportion of 1/3 or 2/3 in the mixture was
   evaluated. Together with two grass-alone and four pure legume treatments
   this added up to 30 treatments. In Experiment 2, V unguiculata was
   gradually replaced by each of the four shrub legumes (3:0, 2:1, 1:2,
   0:3) in grass-legume ratios of 2:1, adding up, together with two
   grass-alone treatments, to 28 treatments. When added alone, V
   unguiculata resulted in high fermentative activity as measured by gas
   production and kinetics as well as low proportion of undegraded crude
   protein. When V unguiculata was replaced by the low-tannin C. argentea
   in Experiment 2, there was no noticeable difference (P > 0.05) in
   fermentative activity. In both experiments, the effect of the
   substitution of V unguiculata by tanniniferous shrub legumes resulted in
   a declining gas production and an increasing proportion of undegraded
   crude protein (P < 0.001). However, the extent of these changes depended
   on the level of replacement and the shrub legume species (P < 0.001).
   The results of Experiment 2 illustrate that this was the consequence not
   only of different tannin contents (less adverse effects with L.
   leucocephala than with C. calothyrsus) but also differences in the
   chemical properties of the tannins present in these shrub legume species
   (much less adverse effects with L. leucocephala than with F macrophylla
   despite similar tannin contents). Furthermore these results indicate
   that, once the extent of the effects of a tanniniferous legume is known,
   one may calculate the maximal level of replacement of a low-tannin
   legume in a grass diet possible without negative effects on ruminal
   fermentation. This allows to improve dry season grass-based diets with
   as few as possible of the expensive and less well growing low-tannin
   legume. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Nanotechnology has become one of the most fascinating and advanced areas
   of research. Nanoparticles are widely used in the biotechnology and
   biomedical field. These metal nanoparticles have gained colossal
   consideration in recent times due to their indispensable and
   technological importance. Among the metal nanoparticles, gold
   nanoparticles are the most important due to its long history of
   medicinal use like the treatment of cancer and due to their sole
   properties, small size and high surface area. Gold nanoparticles
   biosynthesis process can be developing with the natural reducing agents
   such as flavonoids, terpenoids, and enzymes. Lamtoro have compounds such
   as flavonoids, coumarins, terpenes and sterols; its can help the
   formation of gold nanoparticles with biosynthesis process. This research
   employed the extract of Lamtoro for biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of
   nanoparticles is simple, single step, eco-friendly and a green approach.
   The purpose of this study, to determine how the preparation and
   characterisation of gold nanoparticles Lamtoro extract with eco-friendly
   biosynthesis process. The gold nanoparticles (NP's) were characterised
   by UV-Vis spectroscopy, particle size analyzer (PSA), Fourier Transform
   Infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive x-ray
   (SEM-EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. The
   result showed the effective producing indicated by colour changes of the
   solution from yellow to purple. The solution has a maximum wavelength of
   531 nm, the particle size of 1 nm, and the morphology has a spherical
   nanoparticle shape.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the variation of the concentration of mimosine in
   Leucaena forage with season, the time of defoliation and dehydration.
   Fresh samples were collected randomly from Leucaena regrowth and sorted
   into four types of samples (primordial tips, young leaves, mature leaves
   and edible twigs). The samples were divided into two portions and
   handled as fresh or air-dried. Mimosine was extracted from the fresh and
   air-dried samples with dilute hydrochloric acid. Chemical analysis was
   done by indirect spectrophotometric methods. A General Linear Model
   procedure was used to determine the impact of the variables on the
   concentration of mimosine. The results showed that air-dried samples in
   both seasons contained significantly (P < 0.05) more mimosine than the
   corresponding fresh samples by an average of 34\%. Fresh autumn samples
   collected at 12: 00 contained more mimosine (15.43\%) than samples
   collected at 15:00 (9.09\%) and 9: 00 (4.48\%) in comparison with
   corresponding summer samples. Similarly, air-dried autumn samples
   collected at 12: 00 contained more mimosine (47.15\%) than samples
   collected at 9: 00 (43.57\%) and 15: 00 (40.12\%) in comparison with the
   corresponding summer samples. Dehydration of samples elevated the
   concentration of mimosine by 39.09\%, 31.72\% and 31.03\% for samples
   collected at 9: 00, 12: 00 and 15: 00, respectively. It was concluded
   that dehydration of samples had the most significant impact on the
   concentration of mimosine followed by the time of defoliation and the
   season.},

   Panicum maximum, sown in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, was Studied during
   the period between 2000 and 2002. The design was complete random. The
   indicators were: percentage of dry matter (DM), Crude protein (CP),
   crude fiber (CF), ashes, and digestibility of the organic matter. The
   results showed decline (P < 0.001) for the DM percentage, with higher
   time of exploitation of the silvopastoral area. There was stability in
   the seasons, in both climatic periods, during the sowing in 1995. The
   protein content ill Guinea grass increased significantly with the
   highest values (12.2, 11.35, 10.68, and 7.56 \%) during the rainy season
   of 2002, for the sowings in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively.
   However, in the area with lower time of exploitation (1998), the DM
   percentage did not show differences compared with the sampling during
   the dry season in 2002. There was decline (P < 0.001) in the CF
   percentages between the rainy season in 2000 and ill 2002, for the
   sowings in 1995 and 1996. This effect was not seen ill the sowings in
   1997 and 1998. The digestibility was higher (P < 0.05) with the
   evolution of the system in the sowing in 1995 (52.97 vs 54.80 \%), when
   comparing the two samplings in the rainy season. In the rest of the
   sowing years, there were only seasonal differences. It is concluded
   that, with the evolution of the silvopastoral system, there is important
   stability ill the bromatological characteristics of Guinea grass, which
   are reflected markedly up to 811 year of exploitation. The presence of
   leucaena in the system affected the chemical performance of Guinea grass
   by improving its quality in both climatic periods.},

   dry matter (DM) degradability of Aleman-grass (AG), DM potential
   degradability (a+b), soluble fraction (a), maximum degradability (DM),
   degradation rate (c), ruminal pH and ammonia nitrogen, three ruminal
   cannulated Criollo Limonero steers were fed at 14-day adaptation period
   (F1) and samples were taken during the following 4-day period (F2).
   Diets were: T1, Aleman-grass (AG) + concentrate (CO); T2, PA + 2 kg
   Leucaena once a day and T3, PA + 2 kg Leucaena twice a day. During F2
   nylon bags were sequentially incubated on 0; 6; 12; 24; 48; 72 and 96 h,
   and rumen contents pH were measured on 0; 3; 6; 9; 12 y 24 h post
   feeding. A Latin Square design with three replications was used and
   ruminal degradability data was analyzed by nonlinear regression model.
   No differences between treatments were found for a, b and c. a+b was
   higher (P < 0.05) on T3 (62.91\%) than T1 (58.31\%) or T2 (59.17\%).
   Ruminal pH was higher (P < 0.05) in T3 (6.74) than T1 (6.66) and T2
   (6.65). Ammonia nitrogen values were 405.00; 486.14 and 508.25 mg L-1
   for T1, T2 y T3, respectively. It was conclude that L. leucocephala fed
   twice a day increases DM degradability of Aleman-grass.},

   three treatments: A) coast bermuda grass 68 (Cynodon dactylon) + 2 kg of
   concentrates with 58\% of Saccharina; B) coast bermuda grass 68
   associated with Leucaena and C) coast bermuda grass 68 associated with
   Leucaena + final molasses. From February to March grazing was limited to
   4 hr and ground freash sugar cane was supplied at a rate of 10
   kg/animal/day. The stocking rate was 4 animals/ha. A higher final weight
   (P < 0.05) was found in the treatment supplemented with Saccharina (389
   kg) in respect to the treatments supplemented with Leucaena (367 kg) and
   Leucaena + final molasses (369 kg). Live weight gain until incorporation
   to artificial insemination was 735 g/day for Saccharina and higher (P <
   0,01) for the treatments with Leucaena (611 and 622 g/day) without final
   molasses and with final molasses, respectively. With these treatments
   accumulated gains higher than 600 g/day were attained. No response to
   supplementation with final molasses diets with coast bermuda grass 68
   associated with Leucaena was found. The substitution of part of the
   cereals by Saccharina in diets for growing females and in coast bermuda
   68 grasslands is a useful alternative for animal production which merits

   pastures (normal weights being .+-. 25 g) although thyroxine levels
   measured in early autumn were nerve suggestive of serious thryoxine
   deficiency. Thus the higher productivity and consumption of leucaena on
   cv. Cunningham pastures, due to a higher density of plants and greater
   productivity per plant, resulted in better animal production than was
   obtained from cv. Peru pastrues, despite the thyroid enlargement of
   animals grazing cv. Cunningham. Leucaena-based pastures have potential

Abstract = {The sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural systems
   has the potential to partially mitigate climate change by removing
   carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Furthermore, incorporating
   forage legumes into a grazing system may aid in C storage, as mature
   unfertilized pasture soils are typically nitrogen (N) limited. Leucaena
   leucocephala, a leguminous shrub, is often incorporated into grazing
   systems to provide a source of protein for cattle production.
   Additionally, leucaena improves the N fertility of grazing lands.
   Despite this, there is limited research on the C and N dynamics beneath
   leucaena-grass pastures, particularly at depth in the soil profile (1
   m). We assessed the potential of leucaena to sequester SOC by estimating
   the origin (C-3 or C-4), quantity and vertical distribution of SOC
   stocks. A chronosequence of seasonally grazed leucaena stands (0, 9, 22,
   34, 40 years) were sampled for organic C and natural delta C-13
   abundance. Pasture type affected SOC stocks within the upper 0.2 m
   (grass < leucaena mid-row = leucaena row). SOC stocks were also affected
   by leucaena stand age. In the 0-0.3 m zone, SOC increased by 17-30\%
   over 40 years, equating to a sequestration rate of 280 kg ha(-1)
   year(-1). Soil delta C-13 values were depleted below the C-3 leucaena
   rows (-16 parts per thousand) compared to the C-4 grass pasture (-13
   parts per thousand). However, the majority of SOC displayed a C-4-C
   signature. Hence, SOC sequestration primarily occurred due to N
   accretion by leucaena (36 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) contributing to the
   increased C-4 grass productivity, humus formation and slowed SOC
   decomposition. Therefore, there is a need to maintain soil fertility in
   grazed pastures to ensure SOC stocks are accreted and conserved.},

Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted with 26 Holstein and Brown Swiss cows,
   the first (E-1) during the dry season (February to April) and the second
   (E-2) during the rainy season (July to September). Treatment L, which
   involved 3 hours daily of grazing in protein banks of leucaena and
   associated grasses, was compared with a control (T) of grazing in grass
   herbage only. The paddocks of grass alone received no fertilizer.
   Vegetation was scarce during the dry season, but abundant during the
   rainy season.  Individual supplementation with concentrate feed (16\%
   crude protein, CP) was according to production, but the maximum daily
   allowance was fixed at 7 kg. The experimental design was a cross-over
   (single reversal of treatments) with 21-day comparison periods. The
   three herbages-grasses alone, grasses in association with leucaena, and
   the leucaena-showed the following mean percentage chemical compositions
   in E-1 and E-2, respectively: CP, 5.9, 6.9 and 20.3; 7.3, 6.4 and 23.7;
   acid detergent fiber, 34.4, 34.3 and 28.2; 45.8, 44.3 and 27.6. Samples
   of rumen fluid of L and T cows had 179 vs. 148 mg/l of ammonia in E-1
   and 184 vs. 159 mg/l in E-2. Total and proportional concentrations of
   volatile fatty acids and pH of the rumen liquor revealed no consistent
   effect of the treatments. Lactational responses observed with L and T
   were: daily milk, 15.1 vs. 14.5 kg (P=0.05) in E-1 and 15.6 vs. 15.6 kg
   in E-2; fat percentage, 3.1 vs. 3.2 in both experiments; protein
   percentage, 3.7 vs. 3.6 and 3.2 vs. 3.3 in E-1 and E-2. Daily
   consumption of concentrates was 5.6 vs. 5.7 kg and 6.5 vs. 6.4 kg; and
   liveweight 542 vs. 540 kg and 506 vs. 497 kg for L and T in the two
   successive experiments. Presumably the positive effect of the protein
   bank on milk production during the dry season was due to increased

   of the prawns fed with the two Leucaena-containing diets were higher,
   but not significantly different from soybean-containing diet. The 
   content of the poisonous amino acid mimosine in the Leucaena leaves
   could be reduced about 70\% by soaking the leaves in freshwater for 24
   h. Highest weight gain was obtained with the feed containing these
   soaked leaves. In addition to growth and survival, the R-cells of the
   midgut glands of the postlarvae were investigated by light and electron
   microscopy. Although the statistical growth values and the proximate
   analyses of the test diets were similar, a food-specific ultrastructure
   was established after only 4 days of feeding. All diets resulted in
   subcellular characteristics typical for well fed prawns and, at that
   time, the Leucaena diets were already slightly superior to the soybean
   control. This indicates that different sources of macronutrients lead to
   different ultrastructures even if the proximate analyses of protein,
   carbohydrate and lipid are similar. Only slight changes in the R-cells
   were observed after 11, 20 and 28 days in the prawns fed with the
   soybean diet  compared to 4 days of feeding. In the diet containing
   unsoaked Leucaena leaves, however, many R-cells became heavily damaged
   after 20 and 28 days, whereas the prawns fed with the diet containing
   soaked leaves exhibited less pronounced distortion. Statistical analyses
   of growth and survival rate did not show these adverse effects at that
   time. Although it is highly probable that the mimosine is responsible
   for those pathological symptoms, complementary experiments could not
   clearly prove that.  The effects of feed components are visible on the
   cellular or organ level after only a few days, whereas the individuals
   (organism level) reflect them about 10 days later. Another 10 days later
   the changes are manifested in the population. Therefore it is suggested
   to use histology in nutrition studies as a supplementary source of
   information to statistical and biochemical parameters. The midgut glands
   can further be used to monitor the nutritional condition of prawns in
   aquaculture, sea ranching, and in ecological investigations. The study
   confirms that Leucaena leaves are a promising protein source for prawn
   diets if mimosine could be reduced to a very low level. A mimosine level
   of 0.25\% in the feed is still too high, if the diet is used
   uninterruptedly for several weeks.},

Abstract = {The space disposition of the nests of cut ants (Atta insularis) was
   studied in a silvopastoral system of Lecucaena leucocephala and Panicum
   maximum. The leucaena plants were sown between 1995 and 1997. The
   samplings were made in nine paddocks of this system between January and
   July in 2007. In the grassland, there were subtypes of typical Red
   Ferrallitic soil, the oxisol and hydrated or the ultisol. The paddocks
   were subdivided in 56 paddocks of 100 m(2). In these subdivisions, the
   number and distribution of the insect nests, the leucaena plants, and
   other shrubs were recorded. The variance/mean and Taylor indices were
   used to know the type of distribution of the nests. The factorial
   multivariated analysis was applied by multiple correspondences, as well
   as the Mann Whitney and Friedman tests to determine the effect of the
   soil, the trees and the paddocks in the leaf-cutting ants nests. The
   space distribution was of the aggregated type (ID=6.25, a=3.79 and
   b=1.42) with 99 nests ha(-1). The highest concurrence of nests (125
   nests ha(-1), P < 0.05) of leucaena (679 plants ha(-1), P < 0.001) and
   other trees (22 plants ha(-1), P < 0.05) took place in the hydrated red
   ferrallitic soil. The paddocks with this soil, sown in 1996, coincided
   with being the highest number of nests and of plants per hectare. It is
   concluded that the nests of A. insularis showed an aggregated space
   distribution. The soil and the tree plants affected the space
   distribution of the bibijagua nests in the leucaena-Guinea grass

Abstract = {The results of a field trial conducted at the Livestock Research
   Station, Thiruvazhamkunnu, Kerala to study the compatibility of
   different components in a silvo-pastoral system revealed that growth and
   yield of fodder species were significantly influenced by the tree

   Pennisetum purpureum Schum., Panicum maximum Jacq., Brachiaria
   ruziziensis Griseb. and Euchlaena mexicana Schrad. grown in association
   with Casuarina equisetifolia J. R. \& G. Forst. and Ailanthus malabarica

   formation. However, forage crops grown in combination with Acacia
   auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit. registered relatively lower values for growth and yield. Increased
   light infiltration into the understorey due to the cladophyllous canopy
   can be attributed as reason for the higher fodder productivity under
   Casuarina. Due to the combination of crown size and shape, tree height
   and spacing the amount of light intercepted by Ailanthus also was very
   low. Among the four multi-purpose trees used, Acacia recorded the
   maximum growth rate followed by Casuarina, Ailanthus and Leucaena.
   Forage productivity of the four species was in the order: Pennisetum
   purpureum > Panicum maximum > Brachiaria ruziziensis > Euchlaena
   mexicana. Casuarina with Pennisetum/Panicm were found to be optimal tree

Abstract = {Hypertension is a significant public health problem worldwide, a leading
   risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cause of premature death.
   Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity is one of the causes of
   hypertension. Lamtoro Gung has potential as an Angiotensin-I-converting
   Enzyme Inhibitory (ACE-I) due to the presence of peptide that able to
   inhibit its activity to prevent hypertension. The germination process
   was carried out to hydrolyse storage proteins and produce peptides that
   have a low molecular weight. This study investigated ACE-I activity from
   Lamtoro Gung seed during germination and evaluated the blanching effect
   on it. This experiment was conducted with a Completely Randomised Design
   (CRD), and the factor is the differences in germination duration (0, 12,
   24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h). Proteolytic activity and the degree of
   hydrolysis during germination were studied to know the correlation
   between germination and ACE-I activity. The highest ACE-I activity
   sample was blanched with three different durations (2, 4, and 6 s). The
   48 h germinated Lamtoro Gung had the highest ACE-I activity (70.62\%).
   This result was supported by the proteolytic activity (168.79 U/g
   protein dry matter) and degree of hydrolysis (23.26\%). Forty-eight
   hours of germination of Lamtoro Gung resulted in the highest ACE-I
   activity. Blanching of germinated Lamtoro Gung for 2 s could hold the
   ACE-I activity, but the longer duration decreased it.},

Abstract = {The tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) is an omnivorous fish native to the
   Amazon basin, which has high commercial value. Characteristics of
   rusticity and desirable growth in farming highlight this species for
   breeding in captivity. However, in commercial fish breeding, feed costs
   may represent 60-80\% of total costs of production, being the protein
   the most expensive nutrient in the diet. The objective of this study was
   to evaluate the growth of juvenile tambaqui fed with diets containing
   leucaena leaf flour as protein source. A total of 240 juveniles were
   distributed in 12 experimental aquaria (350 L) in a completely
   randomized design with four treatments (0\%, 8\%, 16\%, 24\% of
   inclusion of leucaena leaf flour in diet) and three replications. Weight
   gain, feed conversion ratio, specific growth rate, protein efficiency
   rate and cost of production per kilogram of live weight gained were
   calculated. For the studied variables, there was no significant
   difference (p>0.05) among treatments, indicating that it is possible to
   include up to 24\% of leucaena leaf flour in diets for juveniles of
   tambaqui, without compromising the variables studied, although the
   replacement has not represented reduction in cost of production per
   kilogram of fish.},

Abstract = {The disappearance of dry matter (DM), nitrogen and cell wan constituents
   of the pods of Leucaena leucocephaia and some Acacia species incubated
   in the rumen of Jersey cattle was studied. The chemical compositions of
   the pods (seeds+husks), seeds and husks were examined separately. Amino
   acid and lipid analyses were limited to the pods and seeds, while
   mineral and tannin analyses were done on the pods alone. The seeds had
   higher crude protein (CP) contents than the pods, with values ranging
   from 200 to 300 g CP kg(-1) DM. The Leucaena pods and seeds had higher
   (p > 0.001) CP contents than the Acacia pods and seeds. The neutral
   detergent fibre concentrations in the husks were higher than in the pods
   and seeds with the pods of A erioloba having the highest and those of A
   nilotica the lowest values. These values were highly influenced by the
   seed/husk ratio. A sieberiana and Leucaena had the highest and lowest
   concentrations of condensed tannins respectively. The pods of A tortilis
   and A karoo were particularly rich in macro- and micro-minerals, while
   the others contained sufficient quantities that could contribute
   substantially to the dietary requirements of small ruminants. The amino
   acid concentrations differed significantly (p < 0.001) among the pods,
   with the Leucaena pods having the highest concentrations. The Leucaena
   pods and seeds also had higher (p < 0.001) lipid contents than the
   Acacia pods and seeds. Dry matter and nitrogen degradabilities were
   higher (p < 0.001) for the pods of A nilotica and A sieberiana, while A
   karoo had the lowest values. The cell wall constituents of the pods of A
   tortilis and A erioloba were the most and the least susceptible to
   microbial degradation respectively. The rates of degradation of the
   fibre fractions as well as the lag times were similar (p > 0.05) among
   the pods. The results show that these pods can serve as a valuable
   source of nitrogen and minerals for ruminants fed roughage-based diets.

   the forages was studied, The in situ nylon bag incubation technique was
   used to study the degradation of feedstuffs in two Holstein bulls with
   rumen cannula fed star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis), ne DM and NDF were
   determined on the digestion residues, and the indicators characterizing
   the magnitude and extent of degradation were estimated. Gliricidia
   showed the highest nutrient values and was less degraded in the rumen,
   followed by leucaena: 63.37 \% and sapindus: 56.48 \%, while the
   Enterlobium cyclocarpum was poorly degraded: 33.48 \%. Fiber degradation
   was similar to that of the DM (77.43, 58.81, 43.49 and 31.04\%,
   respectively). The DM degradation rate was higher in gliricidia
   (0.070/hr) and no differences were found between the other plants
   (0.030. 0.026 and 0.03/hr). The results showed the high levels of
   protein and low fiber levels of these forage trees compared to grasses,
   allowing their use as a supplement to balance low quality pasture and

Abstract = {Researchers have always been interested in polysaccharide degradation
   because of the increased biological activity and usability following
   degradation. In this work, low molecular weight galactomannan (LMW-GM)
   was produced through the degradation of galactomannan by H 2 O 2 and
   oxalic acid (OA). The optimal reaction conditions were found by
   conducting the response surface optimization experiment based on single
   -factor experiment and kinetics analysis. Under these conditions, the
   LMW-GM yield was 69.48 +/- 1.02 \%. Ultimately, an analysis of the
   degradation process revealed that OA attacked GM indiscriminately, and H
   2 O 2 has a stronger effect on the removal of branched chains while
   degrading GM. Hence, the degradation steps were rearranged as H 2 O 2
   was added 20 min before OA at a constant total time. The LMW-GM yield
   was successfully increased to 76.49 +/- 1.27 \%. The goal of this work
   is hopefully to give a theoretical foundation for the low-cost
   preparation and industrial production of the degradation of
   galactomannan.},

Abstract = {Twenty-five 42-days old New Zealand white rabbits were weaned and
   accustomed to a control ration in the Ist week and randomly allotted to
   five groups of five rabbits each. They were offered the control ration
   (G-l), and in other groups a portion of the control ration was replaced
   by Leucaena leaf meal (LLM) treated with 1.2\% FeCl3 or untreated i.e.
   25\% LLM (G-2), 50\% LLM (G-3), 25\% treated LLM (G-4), and 50\% treated
   LLM (G-5) ration in pelleted form in a 8 weeks feeding cum metabolism

   was significantly lower (P<0.05) in G-4 and G-5. The overall excretion
   of DHP (2,3 and 3,4 DHP) was similar in all the groups. Severe hepatic

   mild or no damage to liver and kidney was recorded. All tissues were
   devoid of mimosine, but DHP was present in liver, kidney and lungs. The
   maximum DHP in liver indicated as the primary site of DHP metabolism. In
   vitro incubation of LLM with caecal contents revealed 72.68-100\%
   microbial degradation of mimosine. The overall DHP degradation ranged
   from 7.10\% to 37.81\% bring the highest in G-3. The results indicated

Abstract = {Disturbance of vegetation and soil may change the species composition of
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which may in turn affect plant
   species responses to AMF. Seasonal tropical forest in Mexico is
   undergoing rapid conversion to early-successional forest because of
   increased wildfire and may require restoration. The responses of six
   early- and late-successional tree species were tested using early- and
   late-successional AMF inoculum. The plants were germinated in the
   shadehouse and received three inoculum treatments: (1) soil from a
   two-year-old burned site, (2) soil froth a mature forest site, or (3)
   uninoculated controls. They were transplanted as seedlings to a site
   prepared by burning, and their growth was measured from September 1997
   to November MOO. All six species had the greatest growth response to
   early-seral inoculum, but the response to late-seral inoculum varied.
   Two tree species, Ceiba pentandra and Guazuma ulmifolia, were smallest
   with late-seral inoculum, even smaller than the uninoculated. plants,
   and the other species, Brosimum alicastrum, Havardia albicans, Acacia
   pennatula, and Leucaena leucocephala, had intermediate growth with
   late-seral inoculum. Of these, Brosimum, Havardia, and Ceiba occur in
   late-successional forest, and the others are early seral. Of the several
   growth measurements (height, cover, biomass, stem diameter),
   stem-diameter responses to inoculum were still significantly different
   into the third year for four of the species. The uninoculated plants
   became infected by residual inoculum in the burned experimental site
   within three months of transplanting, yet mycorrhizal responses
   persisted. The treatment, size differences may be due to different
   species composition of the inocula. The early-seral inoculum was
   dominated by small-spored Glomus spp., while the late-seral inoculum had
   a higher density of large-spored Gigasporaceae. The latter are known
   from greenhouse experiments to promote a smaller plant-growth response
   than Glomus. Mature forest trees may withstand the carbon drain from
   Gigasporaceae better than establishing seedlings, so the growth patterns
   we observed with inoculum source are consistent with a rapidly growing
   successional forest, followed by slower-growing mature forest. The
   results suggest that early-seral AMF should be used when seedlings are
   inoculated for restoration, even for late-seral tree species.},

   Post-fertilisation abortion of pods does not completely explain the

   number of seeds. The regulation is rendered through the inhibition of

   less than a certain critical load in the stigma. Such a control is shown
   to have implications in the evolution of pollen package units,
   generation of male gametophytic competition and the economy of packing

Abstract = {This is the first systematic study of rhizobia associated with Albizia

   SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins and clustering of phenotypic characters
   grouped the 31 rhizobial strains isolated from Albizia into eight
   putative species within the genera Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium and
   Rhizobium. Among these eight rhizobial species, five were unique to
   Albizia and the remaining three were shared with Acacia and Leucaena,
   two legume trees coexisting with Albizia in China. These results
   indicated that Albizia species nodulate with a wide range of rhizobial
   species and had preference of microsymbionts different from Acacia and
   Leucaena. The definition of four novel groups, Mesorhizobium sp.,
   Rhizobium sp. 1, Rhizobium sp. 11 and ``R. giardinii{''}, indicates that
   further studies with enlarged rhizobial population are necessary to
   better understand the diversity and to clarify the taxonomic

Abstract = {Nitrogen recovery from N-15-labelled prunings of Gliricidia sepium,
   Peltophorum dasyrrachis, Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena
   leucocephala, each of two different chemical qualities, was followed
   over three cropping cycles in a growth room. Half of the pots of each
   treatment received a further addition of unlabelled pruning material,
   from the same species as that previously applied, before the second and
   third crop cycle. The cumulative maize total N accumulation revealed the
   largest benefit from N rich, low lignin and polyphenols Gliricidia
   prunings followed by Leucaena, Calliandra and Peltophorum. Cumulative N
   recovery measured using N-15 over the three crop cycles ranged from 9\%
   from Calliandra prunings to 44\% from Gliricidia prunings. The vast
   majority of this N was recovered during the first crop cycle which
   agreed well with estimates using the N difference method. Recoveries in
   the second and third crops ranged from 0.4-5\% (N-15 method) and 6-14\%
   (N difference method) of the N initially applied. The protein binding
   capacity of polyphenols was the best predictor of N recovery at both
   initial and later crop cycles. Treatments which led to a large N
   recovery initially, continued to provide greater N benefits in
   subsequent cycles although with increasing harvest time this trend
   decreased. Thus, there was no compensation in initial N release from low
   quality prunings at later harvests and the agronomic implications of
   this are discussed. Addition of unlabelled Gliricidia prunings before
   the second and third cycle led to a positive apparent priming effect on
   previously applied N-15 labelled prunings. By contrast, repeated
   additions of Peltophorum residues, rich in lignin and active
   polyphenols, resulted in a reduced recovery of initially applied
   pruning-N-15. However, the maximum positive or negative effects on
   recovery of pruning N amounted to less than 2\% recovery of the initial
   amount of N added over 14 weeks. Thus the scope for regulation of N
   release from tree prunings during these later stages of decomposition
   appears to be limited.},

   sp. >Leucaena sp. >Gliricidia sp. Large differences in extractable P
   levels were observed. Senna sp. was associated with the highest
   extractable P level (11.5 mg kg(-1)) and Treculia sp. the lowest (4.9 mg
   kg(-1)). P sorption was highest on worm casts under Dactyladenia sp. and
   lowest on those under Treculia sp. Without fertilizer application, there
   were no significant differences in the dry weight of maize grown in the
   different worm casts. With NPK applications, the dry weight of maize
   grown in worm casts associated with Treculia sp. was significantly lower
   than that of maize grown in the other worm casts, mainly due to the low
   extractable P level. Despite a high organic C and exchangeable K status,
   maize grown in the worm casts still responded significantly to N and K
   applications. The N uptake by maize grown in worm casts associated with
   Treculia sp. was lower than that in the other treatments.},

Abstract = {Field and glasshouse experiments were conducted on an acidic red-yellow
   podzolic soil of low nitrogen status from southeastern Queensland to
   examine the use of nitrogen and lime in promoting leucaena growth. In
   the field, application of 25 kg nitrogen ha-1 at planting increased
   shoot dry weight by 77, 88, 52 and 51\% at weeks 5, 15, 32 and 52,
   respectively. Equivalent responses to lime (2.5 t ha-1) were 8, 31, 64
   and 74\%, respectively. In the glasshouse, shoot, root and noduble dry
   weights were increased by nitrogen application rates of 50, 100 and 200
   kg ha-1. Number, size and dry weight of nodules were suppressed at the
   highest rate (400 kg ha-1). Nitrogen concentration in youngest fully
   expanded leaves was increased over 5\% by nitrogen, and a critical
   nitrogen content of 4.5\% (90\% of maximum growth) is suggested.
   Inexplicably, lime application reduced shoot, root and nodule weights at
   high nitrogen applications. The apparent partial effectiveness of
   commercial leucaena Rhizobium and the implications of starter nitrogen
   and lime for leucaena establishment are discussed.},

Title = {Impact of residue quality on the C and N mineralization of leaf and root
   residues of three agroforestry species},
Journal = {PLANT AND SOIL},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {183},
Number = {2},
Pages = {221-231},
Abstract = {A laboratory incubation experiment with N-15 labeled root and leaf
   residues of 3 agroforestry species (Leucaena leucocephala, Dactyladenia
   barteri and Flemingia macrophylla) was conducted under controlled
   conditions (25 degrees C) for 56 days to quantify residue C and N
   mineralization and its relationship with residue quality.
   No uniform relation was found between the chemical composition of the
   above and below residues. The leucaena and dactyladenia roots contained
   more lignin (8 and 26\% respectively) and less N (2.0 and 1.0\%
   respectively) than the respective leaves (2 and 13\% Lignin and 2.9 and
   1.4\% N, respectively), whereas the differences between the lignin and N
   contents of the flemingia leaves and roots were not significant (4.6 and
   3.0\% lignin and 2.63 and 2.68\% N, respectively). The leucaena leaves
   contained more polyphenols than the roots (6.4 and 3.6\%), while the
   polyphenol content of the leaves and roots of the other residues was
   similar (5.0 and 5.1\% for dactyladenia and 4.0 and 3.5\% for
   flemingia). Three patterns of N mineralization could be distinguished. A
   first pattern, followed by residues producing the highest amounts of
   CO2, showed an initial immobilization of soil derived N, followed by a
   net release of both soil and residue derived N after 7 days of
   incubation. A second pattern, followed by the flemingia leaf residues
   which produced intermediate amounts of CO2 and had an intermediate
   quality, showed no significant immobilization of soil derived N, and
   significant mineralization of residue N. A third pattern, followed by
   both low quality dactyladenia residues, showed a low release of residue
   derived N and a continued inmobilization of soil derived N. Residue C
   mineralization was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with the residue
   lignin content, C-to-N ratio, and polyphenol-to-N ratio. The proportion
   of residue N mineralized (immobilized) after 56 days of incubation was
   significantly correlated with the residue N content (p < 0.01) and the
   C-to-N ratio (p < 0.05). The relations were quadratic, rather than
   linear. The ratio of the proportion of residue N mineralized
   (immobilized) over the proportion of residue C mineralized after 56 days
   was highly significantly correlated with the lignin content (p < 0.01)
   and C-to-N (p < 0.001), lignin-to-N (p < 0.01), polyphenol-to-N (p <
   0.01) and (lignin+polyphenol)-to-N ratios (p < 0.01) in a linear way.
   This indicates that due to the low availability of the residue C,
   relatively less N is immobilized for the very low quality residues
   ((lignin+polyphenol)-to-N ratio: 29.7) than for the residues with a
   relatively higher quality ((lignin+polyphenol)-to-N ratios between 3.3
   and 12.5).},

Abstract = {Plant-based foods may serve as alternative resources in meeting the
   nutritional requirements of predatory mites, when the preferred prey
   species is scarce. In laboratory studies, we evaluated the effect of
   various plant-based food resources associated with cassava on
   development and reproduction of Neoseitilus (= Amblyseius) idaeus
   Denmark and Muma, Typhlodromalus manihoti Moraes, and Typhlodromalus
   aripo DeLeon, three predatory mites that have been used in classical
   biological control of the herbivorous mite Mononychellus tanajoa
   (Bondar) in Africa. The tests included five treatments (diets): pollen
   of three plant species-Zea mays L. (maize), of Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) De Wit, and of Ricinus communis L.-cassava foliar exudate, and
   cassava leaf tissue (as the control). Neoseiulus idaeus did not complete
   development (hence no reproduction occurred) on any of the offered
   foods. Both T aripo and T manihoti successfully completed immature
   development-albeit in small proportions-on pollen of maize and L.
   leucocephala and on cassava foliar exudate. Only T aripo completed
   immature development on pollen of R. communis and cassava leaf tissue;
   on the latter two foods, however, only males reached the adult stage.
   Moreover, of the five diets, none except pollen of maize was suitable
   for reproduction, and only for T aripo, as T manihoti did not reproduce
   on any of these diets. The duration of immature development of T aripo
   was shorter on pollen of maize (6.9 days) than on cassava foliar exudate
   (11.1 days), while an intermediate value was recorded on pollen of L.
   leucocephala (8.6 days). Typhlodromalus manihoti developed faster on
   pollen of maize and cassava foliar exudate (6.8 days) than on pollen of
   L. leucocephala (9.8 days). Typhodromalus aripo lived much longer on
   pollen of maize and cassava foliar exudate compared with T manihoti,
   whereas the two predator species had nearly similar female longevity on
   pollen of L. leucocephala. These results suggest that consumption of
   pollen of maize, pollen of L. leucocephala, or cassava foliar exudate
   can enhance development of T aripo and T manihoti in the absence of M.
   tanajoa, their preferred prey. Pollen of maize was suitable for T aripo
   in completing oogenesis and hence allowing the predator to increase in
   abundance during shortages of M. tanajoa. The implications of our
   findings for the persistence of the acarine predator-prey system on
   cassava, and for the success of biological control of M. tanajoa in
   Africa are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The comparative effects of CaCO3 were determined in plants grown in pots
   of an acid soil. CaCO3 treatments were equivalent to nil, 250, 750, 1250
   and 2500 kg ha-1 (Ca0 to Ca4). L. leucocephala is a tree, well adapted
   to calcareous soils. M. lathyroides and L. bainesii are herbaceous
   species tolerant of acid soil conditions. Total dry matter {[}DM]
   production (tops + roots) of the 4 Leucaena lines exceeded that of M.
   lathyroides and L. bainesii. However, the top DM yield of the latter 2
   spp. exceeded that of Leucaena due to a low top/root weight ratio in
   Leucaena. The Leucaena lines gave successive total DM increases up to
   the Ca3 treatment, the overall increase being relatively large,
   especially in line 3; at Ca4 mean DM yields were below those at Ca3.
   Both M. lathyroides and L. bainesii had significant responses
   particularly at the Ca1 treatment, but at the Ca4 treatment their total
   DM yields were reduced below those obtained with no CaCO3 addition. In
   all Leucaena lines there was a significant increase in nodule DM pot-1
   between the Ca0 and Ca4 treatments. However, there was a decrease in
   nodule DM of lines 5 and 27A from the Ca3 to Ca4 treatment. Nodule DM of
   M. lathyroides and L. bainesii was only affected to a limited extent
   over the range of treatments Ca0 to Ca3, but at Ca4 a significant
   reduction occurred in both species. In all species CaCO3 additions
   progressively increased the concentration of Ca in the plant tops. The
   positive DM responses were considered to be primarily due to Ca,
   although Al may have had a confounding effect, especially in L.
   leucocephala. Line 3 of L. leucocephala had the highest Ca concentration
   as well as the greatest reduction in Al concentration.},

   systems. In general rice yields were higher with Leucaena leucocephala
   and Erythrina mulch as compared to Inga mulch, perhaps because of higher
   levels of available N provided by the rapidly decomposing leaves of
   Leucaena leucocephala and Erythrina sp. as compared to Inga. Weed
   control was greater, however, with the slowly decomposing Inga mulch.
   For all three hedgerow/crop systems there was a net export of P from the

Abstract = {Litterfall and fine root production is a major pathway for carbon and
   nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. We investigated leaf litterfall,
   fine-root mass, production and turnover rate in the upper soil (0-30 cm)
   under four major tree species (Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia nilotica,
   Azadirachta indica, Prosopis juliflora) of the semi-arid region of
   India. All the four tree species showed an unimodal peak of leaf
   litterfall with distinct seasonality. Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia
   nilotica had maximum leaf litterfall between September and December
   while Azadirachta indica and Prosopis juliflora shed most of their
   leaves between February and May. Annual leaf litterfall of the four
   species ranged from 3.3 Mg ha(-1) (Leucaena leucocephala) to 8.1 Mg
   ha(-1) (Prosopis juliflora). Marked seasonal variations in amount of
   fine root biomass were observed in all the four tree species. Fine root
   production was maximum in Prosopis juliflora (171 g m(-2) y(-1))
   followed by Azadirachta indica (169 g m(-2) y(-1)), Acacia nilotica (106
   g m(-2) y(-1)) and Leucaena leucocephala (79 g m(-2) y(-1)). Fine root
   biomass showed a seasonal peak after the rainy season but fell to its
   lowest value during the winter and dry summer season. Fine root turnover
   rate ranged from 0.56 to 0.97 y(-1) and followed the order Azadirachta
   indica > Leucaena leucocephala > Prosopis juliflora > Acacia nilotica.
   The results of this study demonstrated that Prosopis juliflora and
   Azadirachta indica had greater capability for maintaining site
   productivity as evidenced from greater leaf litterfall and fine root
   production.},

Abstract = {Inadequate supply of fodder is a serious constraint to the
   potentially-promising small-holder-dairy production system in coastal
   Kenya. Alley farming could be an approach to addressing this problem. A
   study of forage production based on Napier grass and leucaena in an
   alley cropping system was conducted on an infertile sandy soil in
   lowland coastal Kenya. The effects of leucaena hedgerows, Clitoria
   ternatea (L.) intercropping, addition of slurry (110 t ha(-1) yr(-1))
   and two harvesting managements (severe and lenient) on the yield of
   Napier grass fodder, were assessed. The study was initiated in 1989 and
   three years results are reported.
   Napier grass fodder yields did not decline in the presence of leucaena
   hedgerows in most harvests. Generally, the Napier rows adjacent to the
   hedgerows gave greater yields than in either the centre or sole Napier
   rows. Interplanting clitoria between Napier rows had a beneficial effect
   on Napier yields in the later harvests. Compared with sole Napier, the
   hedgerow treatment receiving slurry increased yield ha(-1) of Napier by
   50\%, of total forage by 80\%, and of nitrogen (measured over two
   harvests) by 200\%.
   During the first two years of cropping most treatments did not affect
   the OM and nitrogen content of the soil but by the end of the third
   cropping year, slurry application increased soil OM by 21\% and slurry
   and clitoria treatments each increased soil nitrogen by 33\%.
   The study demonstrated the increases in the supply and quality of
   forages for dairy cattle that can be achieved by planting complementary
   forages, legume and grass species in an intercropping system like alley
   farming and the benefits to soil composition by the return of slurry.},

Abstract = {An insect population in a Leucaena plantation intercropped with maize at
   15 and 40 days after sowing was studied during establishment. Samples
   were taken with an entomological net with 60 trappings/sample every two
   weeks. Contingency tables and proportion comparisons were used for
   analysing the data. The main insects affecting Leucaena were:
   Heteropsylla cubana (148-938) and Euxesta stigmatias (9-81) which had a
   lower incidence in maize and weeds. In maize,insect infestation was
   negligible and a high population of Dorn taeniatum, preying on larvae
   nymphs(Spodoptera frugiperda) was observed. However in weeds the highest
   incidence was of Draeculacephala cubana, Hortensia simiIis, Polymerus
   cuneatus and Diabrotica balteata. The presence of Mocis latipes was
   negigible. Regardless the number of insects collected, no important
   detrimental effect was found in crops. The results demonstrate that
   there was a greater incidence when plants were intercropped at 15 days
   and lower at 40 days. It is concluded that on intercropping at 15 days,
   the number of insects did not damage maize nor Leucaena during
   establishment and a land use is more efficient.},

Title = {Four Invasive Plant Species in Southwest Saudi Arabia Have Variable
   Effects on Soil Dynamics},
Journal = {PLANTS-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Predicting the direction and magnitude of change in soil dynamics caused
   by invasive plant species has proven to be difficult because these
   changes are often reported to be species- and habitat-specific. This
   study was conducted to determine changes in three soil properties, eight
   soil ions, and seven soil microelements under established stands of four
   invasive plants, Prosopis juliflora, Ipomoea carnea, Leucaena
   leucocephala, and Opuntia ficus-indica. Soil properties, ions, and
   microelements were measured in sites invaded by these four species in
   southwest Saudi Arabia, and these values were compared to the results
   for the same 18 parameters from adjacent sites with native vegetation.
   Because this study was conducted in an arid ecosystem, we predict that
   these four invasive plants will significantly alter the soil properties,
   ions, and microelements in the areas they invaded. While the soils of
   sites with the four invasive plant species generally had higher values
   for soil properties and ions compared to sites with native vegetation,
   in most instances these differences were not statistically significant.
   However, the soils within sites invaded by I. carnea, L. leucocephala,
   and P. juliflora had statistically significant differences for some soil
   parameters. For sites invaded by O. puntia ficus-indica, no soil
   properties, ions, or microelements were significantly different compared
   to adjacent sites with native vegetation. Sites invaded by the four
   plant species generally exhibited differences in the 11 soil properties,
   but in no instance were these differences statistically significant. All
   three soil properties and one soil ion (Ca) were significantly different
   across the four stands of native vegetation. For the seven soil
   microelements, significantly different values were detected for Co and
   Ni, but only among stands of the four invasive plant species. These
   results indicate that the four invasive plant species altered soil
   properties, ions, and microelements, but for most of the parameters we
   assessed, not significantly. Our results do not support our initial
   prediction, but are in general agreement with previous published
   findings, which indicate that the effects of invasive plants on soil
   dynamics vary idiosyncratically among invasive species and among invaded
   habitats.},

Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Fish offal and other high protein substrates are generally not suitable
   for anaerobic digestion because of the high levels of ammonia produced
   as a result of their biodegradation. In order to efficiently use these
   types of substrates to produce methane, co-digestion is used to balance
   the amounts of carbon and nitrogen in the feedstock. In this experiment
   an optimization procedure for maximizing the methane potential of fish
   offal, using river tamarind as the co-substrates was developed. Our
   experimental design tested the effects of substrate to substrate
   mixtures, as well as overall substrate to inoculum combinations, on the
   methane potentials. This was performed using batch style biochemical
   methane potential assays, which employed a methodology developed in our
   laboratory. The optimum of the 25 combinations tested was 50\% fish
   offal to 50\% river tamarind at a substrate to inoculum ratio of 0.03,
   with a specific methane yield of 144 +/- 6 NmL/gFM (330 +/- 14
   NmL/goDM). This gave much improvement when compared with the fish offal
   alone, which reached 63 +/- 4 NmL/gFM (317 +/- 20 NmL/goDM) at maximum.
   These results indicate that with the correct mixture, rivertamarind is a
   suitable co-substrate for anaerobic co-digestion of fish offal.},

Abstract = {Invasive exotic species are plants introduced into a new environment
   that adapt and establish themselves, which reproduce, dominate and
   remove or extinguish native species, thus causing biodiversity loss.
   This work objective was to diagnose the situation of riparian forests in
   the Marinheirinho sub-basin in Votuporanga/SP, in addition to identify
   and quantify exotic species and exotic invasive tree species. 56 sample
   areas were evaluated to cover fractions of riparian forests in all
   streams of the Marinheirinho sub-basin in its urban area. It was
   concluded that all streams are silted up, and the riparian forest is
   degraded due to erosion occurrences; equidae, cattle and pigs creation,
   vegetables and fruits plantings, solid waste and improper settlements.
   The state of vegetation regeneration is initial in most areas, with 47\%
   of native trees over 2 m tall, 9\% exotic species and 44\% invasive
   species, with brachiaria in many of them. Two exotic species, leucena
   and ipe-de-jardim, were found in 90\% of the areas, which shows a state
   of biological invasion and biodiversity loss and makes it necessary to
   public policies implantation and competent bodies actions.},

Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-29},
Abstract = {The commonly practiced ground-level planting was compared with a
   moisture-conserving open-pit sunken planting technique in an attempt to
   test the success of modified planting techniques that enhance tree
   survival and early growth in and environments. An indigenous species,
   Acacia mellifera (Vahl.) Benth., which is well adapted to the
   environmental conditions of the trial site, was used for the comparative
   study. Trial results showed that, after 21 months, height growth of
   seedlings planted in open pits was almost three times faster than that
   of seedlings planted at ground level. Total biomass production of open
   pit planted seedlings exceeded that of those planted at ground level by
   78\%. Shoot divided-by root ratios of biomass produced were 1 divided-by
   1.07 in sunken plantings and 1 divided-by 1.43 in level planting,
   suggesting that roots of sunken planted seedlings support a higher
   above-ground biomass production. No mortalities occurred in either of
   the two treatments because of the natural drought tolerance of A.
   mellifera. The highly significant differences in height growth
   performance suggested that this planting technique should be tested on
   other tree species on a larger scale. Accordingly, Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) de Wit was used for a second, larger experiment. The results of
   this trial largely confirmed those of the preceding one. After 31
   months, the increase in shoot length of seedlings planted in open pits
   was 50\% higher than that of seedlings planted at ground level. However,
   total biomass production was only 13\% higher for seedlings planted in
   open pits and no significant differences between the two treatments
   could be established. Nevertheless, there was a significant difference
   between the species' shoot-to-root ratios. This ratio was 1 divided-by
   1.04, for the sunken planting treatment, compared to 1 divided-by 1.60
   for level planting. Mortality among seedlings in the open pits was half
   that of the seedlings planted at ground level.},

Abstract = {Leaf extracts and mulch from 14 multipurpose trees were used to test

   caused by Gliricidia sepium, Tetrapleura tetraptera, Lonchocarpus
   sireceus, Senna siamea and Leucaena leucocephala. Terminalia superba,
   Tetrapleura tetraptera, Pithecelobium dulce, Gliricidia sepium and Senna
   siamea significantly reduced maize root growth at the lowest extract
   concentration, while shoot length was most significantly reduced by
   Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Alchornea coordifolia,
   Pithecelobium dulce, Terminalia superba, and Tetrapleura tetraptera at
   all concentrations. Growth of maize in pots and yield in the field were
   controlled by nitrogen supply and uptake. Fast-decomposing leaf material
   rich in nitrogen promoted growth and yield of maize. Thus Leucaena
   leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium, both nitrogen-fixing legumes with
   high nitrogen contents and fast-decomposing leaf materials,
   significantly increased maize growth and yield. This suggests that the
   negative effects of leaf extracts observed in the laboratory are
   ecologically irrelevant in the field.},

Abstract = {In an alley cropping system, prunings from the hedgerow legume are
   expected to supply nitrogen (N) to the associated cereal. However, this
   may not be sufficient to achieve maximum crop yield. Three field
   experiments with alley-cropped maize were conducted in a semi-arid
   environment in northern Australia to determine: (1) the effect of N
   fertilizer on maize growth in the presence of fresh leucaena prunings;
   (2) the effect of incorporation of leucaena and maize residues on maize
   yield and the fate of plant residue N-15 in the alley cropping system;
   and (3) the N-15 recovery by maize from N-15-labelled leucaena, maize
   residues and ammonium sulphate fertilizer.
   Leucaena residues increased maize crop yield and N uptake although they
   did not entirely satisfy the N requirement of the alley crop. Additional
   N fertilizer further increased the maize yield and N uptake in the
   presence of leucaena residues. Placement of leucaena residues had little
   effect on the availability of N to maize plants over a 2 month period.
   The incorporation of leucaena residues in the soil did not increase the
   recovery of leucaena N-15 by maize compared with placement of the
   residues on the soil surface. After 2 months, similar proportions of the
   residue N-15 were recovered by maize from mulched leucaena (6.3\%),
   incorporated leucaena (6.1\%) and incorporated maize (7.6\%). By the end
   of one cropping season (3 months after application) about 9\% of the
   added N-15 was taken up by maize from either N-15-labelled leucaena as
   mulch or N-15-labelled maize residues applied together with unlabelled
   fresh leucaena prunings as mulch. The recovery of the added N-15 was
   much higher (42.7\%) from the N-15-labelled ammonium sulphate fertilizer
   at 40 kg N ha-1 in the presence of unlabelled leucaena prunings. Most of
   the added N-15 recovered in the 200 cm soil profile was distributed in
   the top 25 cm soil with little leached below that. About 27-41\% of the
   leucaena N-15 was apparently lost, largely through denitrification from
   the soil and plant system, in one cropping season. This compared with
   35\% of the fertilizer N-15 lost when the N fertilizer was applied in
   the presence of prunings.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effect of replacing alfalfa hay by subabul
   leaf meal (SLM) on digestion, fermentation parameters and rumen bacteria
   and fungi activity of Najdi goats. Six Najdi goats (150 +/- 15 days of
   age and initial body weight of 35 +/- 1.1 kg) were randomly assigned to
   one of two dietary treatments in a balanced completely randomized design
   (three goats per treatment) for 56 days. Experimental treatments
   included alfalfa hay as control group and diet containing SLM (SLM
   replacing alfalfa hay at 50\% level). Bacterial and fungi activity and
   rumen fermentation parameters of animals fed experimental diets were
   determined. Dry matter disappearance (DMD) was unaffected by replacing
   SLM with alfalfa hay for both rumen bacteria and fungi in different
   incubation times, except for 48 h of incubation in specific culture
   medium of mixed rumen bacteria, which decreased for SLM group (P >
   0.05). NDF disappearance (NDFD) and ADF disappearance (ADFD) after 24
   and 48 h of incubation in specific culture medium of mixed rumen
   bacteria was not affected by experimental diets (P > 0.05). However, 72
   h after incubation, NDFD in SLM treatment decreased (P > 0.05). Gas
   production parameters of rumen bacteria were similar for both
   experimental diets, but partitioning factor (PF), efficiency microbial
   biomass production (EMBP), microbial protein production (MP), and
   organic matter truly digested (OMTD) decreased (p < 0.05) in specific
   culture medium of mixed rumen fungi for SLM diet. There was significant
   decrease in total protozoa population for diet containing SLM (p <
   0.05). Results indicated that replacement of alfalfa hay by SLM had no
   major effect on rumen microorganisms' activity of Najdi goats, so it may
   be used as an alternative for alfalfa (at 50\% level) in susceptible
   areas.},

Abstract = {Leucaena is a perennial fodder crop that can significantly improve beef
   production across substantial parts of the world's grazing lands. We
   surveyed leucaena cultivations across 350 000 km(2) of Australia's prime
   leucaena-growing region, using a new approach to quantify leucaena
   coverage and distribution. This approach uses high resolution imagery to
   detect leucaena by the distinctive alley cultivation pattern that is
   typical in the region and in many other parts of the world. We estimated
   there are similar to 123 500 ha of leucaena in the study region.
   Although no prior estimate of leucaena coverage has been based on
   exactly the same geographic area, our data strongly suggest that recent
   published estimates of leucaena coverage for Queensland and Australia
   are substantial overestimates. In addition to providing robust estimates
   of total leucaena coverage, we demonstrate how the method can also
   contribute to other survey objectives such as comparison of actual with
   potential spatial distribution, and assessment of statistical sampling
   power. We also discuss the potential application of the new method in

Abstract = {Ensiled king grass (Cenchrus purpureus (Schumach.) Morrone) is commonly
   used as feed in tropical ruminant production. However, ruminant
   performance can be limited by low nitrogen (N) content in tropical grass
   silage. A mixed feed of legume king grass silage may be an option to
   improve ruminant production. We investigated the effects of feeding an
   ensiled mixture of king grass forage and foliage of a browse tree
   legume, either leucaena (Leucuenu leucocephula (Lam.) de Wit) or
   gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp), on dry matter (DM) intake,
   DM digestibility, organic matter (OM) digestibility and N balance of
   Pelibuey sheep. Twelve male lambs 9--11 months old were blocked by
   initial bodywcight (33 +/- 3 kg, mean +/- s.d.) into three groups of
   four lambs and randomly assigned to one of three feed treatments: king
   grass silage (KS); mixed king grass and leucaena silage (KLS); and mixed
   king grass and gliricidia silage (KGS). Results showed that DM and OM
   were similar among silages. The N content was higher (P < 0.001) in KLS
   and KGS than in KS. DM intake and DM digestibility were higher (P <
   0.001) in KLS and KGS than in KS. OM digestibility was higher (P <
   0.001) in KLS than in KS. Nitrogen intake, faecal N, urine volume,
   urinary N, digested N, N digestibility, N retention and retained N N
   intake ratio from KLS and KGS treatments were higher (P< 0.05) than from
   KS. A lower (P< 0.01) urinary N N intake ratio was detected from KGS and
   KLS than from KS. This study demonstrated that, compared with silage
   made from king grass alone, legume king grass silage mixtures can
   improve intake and nutrient digestibility in Pelibuey lambs. Further, N
   retention can be enhanced when legume king grass silages are used as
   feed compared with king grass silage alone.},

Abstract = {Rapid development in hilly areas in Malaysia has become a trend that put
   a stress to the sloping area. It reduces the factor of safety by
   reducing the resistant force and therefore leads to slope failure.
   Vegetation plays a big role in reinforcement functions via anchoring the
   soils and forms a binding network within the soil layer that tied the
   soil masses together. In this research, three plant species namely
   Acacia mangium, Dillenia suffruticosa and Leucaena leucocephala were
   assessed in term of their soil-root shear strength properties. Our
   results showed that Acacia mangium had the highest shear strength
   values, 30.4 kPa and 50.2 kPa at loads 13.3 kPa and 24.3 kPa,
   respectively. Leucaena leucocephala showed the highest in cohesion
   factor, which was almost double the value in those of Dillenia
   suffruticosa and Acacia mangium. The root profile analysis indicated
   Dillenia suffruticosa exhibited the highest values in both root length
   density and root volume, whilst Leucaena leucocephala had the highest
   average of root diameter.},

Abstract = {With the advance of agriculture, there was consequent rising in
   environment degradation. Therefore, It is interesting the use of plants
   which have in their chemical composition substances capable of helping
   in the control of weeds to minimize the use of pesticides. Hence, the
   objective of this paper was to evaluate solutions of leucena extract on
   weeds that are frequent on soybean crop. The treatments were leucena
   extracts at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100\% at room temperature water and
   water heated to 80 degrees C. The extracts were obtained by crushing
   200g of leucena leaves and mixing them with one liter of distilled water
   with the help of a blender. Seeds were kept in B.O.D. at a temperature
   of 25 degrees C, with a photoperiod of 12 hours of light. Evaluations
   were done oil a daily basis, from the first to the last day of the
   experiment, varying according to the species. Results show a negative
   interference of the extracts, both hot and cold, in the root length of
   Ipomoea grandifolia, in the percentage of germination and in the root
   length of Arrowleaf sida and Hair beggarticks. There was no negative
   interference in the analyzed parameters for soybean seeds. Thus, the
   results indicate allelopatic potential of Leucaena leuucocephala as an
   alternative for the management of weeds without interfering on the
   development of the soybean crop.},

Abstract = {Changes in phosphorus fractions (resin, NaHCO3, NaOH, HCl, and
   H2SO4+H2O2 digest with separate organic and inorganic P determinations)
   resulting from laboratory incubation of two acid soils of the State of
   Parana with four levels of leucaena residue (O, 10, 20 and 30 t/ha) were
   evaluated. Residual P was the largest single fraction amounting to over
   60\% of the total P. Pi-NaOH (Pi associated with Fe and Al) and Po-NaOH
   (Po-humus) were the largest inorganic and organic P fractions,
   respectively. Pi-HCl was the lowest inorganic fraction. Incubation with
   leucaena residue caused labile P to increase but medium labile P and non
   labile P remained at original levels. The distribution of Pi and Po in
   the labile P fraction varied with soil. in the dusky latosol there was
   an increase in resin-Pi and NaHCO3-Po with no change in NaHCO3-Pi,
   whereas in the dark red latosol there was a decrease in both inorganic P
   fractions (resin-Pi and NaHCO3-Pi) and an increase in microbial P and
   NaHCO3-Po. The fact that resin-Pi plus NaHCO3-Pi has decreased in the
   dark red latosol suggests that leucaena residue additions estimulated an
   increase in microbial activity which increased the amount of soil Pi
   immobilized as organic P. It was found that Mehlich-1 solution (0,05N
   HCl + 0.025N H2SO4) extracted most of resin plus NaHCO3-Pi but it was
   not effective to extract NaHCO3-Po.},

Title = {In vitro Anthelmintic Efficacy of Three Plant Extracts against Various
   Developmental Stages of Haemonchus contortus},
Journal = {PAKISTAN VETERINARY JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Gastrointestinal nematodes, including Haemonchus (H.) contortus, have a
   notable impact in terms of impaired production, high fatalities, and
   substantial economic losses, affecting small ruminants in tropical
   countries, including Pakistan. The irrational use of synthetic chemicals
   has fueled anthelmintic resistance, particularly in H. contortus, as a
   formidable challenge, prompting a search for alternative treatment
   strategies. This study evaluated the anthelmintic potential of leaf
   extracts of three forage plants, including Leucaena leucocephala,
   Moringa oleifera, and Acacia ampliceps, against various developmental
   stages of H. contortus. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of
   secondary metabolites in the extracts. In vitro assays were performed to
   evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of the extracts on the inhibition of
   egg hatching, larval paralysis, and adult worm motility following the
   guidelines of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary
   Parasitology, while Albendazole was used as a positive control and PBS
   as a negative control. The highest concentrations of tannins and
   flavonoids in Acacia ampliceps and phenolic compounds in Leucaena
   leucocephala were detected in the extracts as major secondary
   metabolites. All the tested extracts showed significant time- and
   dose-dependent responses to various stages of H. contortus. The ED50
   values showed that the lowest dose of Leucaena leucocephala (0.285),
   Moringa oliefera (0.81), and Acacia ampliceps (0.245) inhibited egg
   hatching and larval and adult motility, respectively. Extracts of
   Leucaena leucocephala exhibited significant inhibition of egg hatching
   (70.3\%), whereas Moringa oliefera showed maximum percent inhibition
   (66.6) of larval motility. These findings suggest that these plants,
   traditionally used by local healers in Pakistan, may possess
   antiparasitic properties, encouraging further studies on the
   relationship between phytochemicals, extraction methods, and in vivo
   trials to explore their anthelmintic efficacy.},

Abstract = {A bacterial isolate STM 905, having high mimosine degradation ability,
   was isolated from the rhizosphere of Leucaena leucoceplala. The cells of
   this strain were rod shaped, Gram negative, motile, could grow in pH
   range of 5.0-11.0 and temperature range 15-42 degrees C. On 16S rDNA
   sequence analysis based identification the strain STM 905 was found to
   be closest to Pseudomonas putida strain BH. Growth of this bacterium in
   the presence of mimosine, as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, was
   correlated with the induction of an enzyme capable of mimosine
   degradation. This enzyme catalyses the degradation of mimosine to their
   corresponding 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone (DHP), pyruvic acid and ammonia.
   The maximum induction of mimosine degradation enzyme activity has been
   observed at 15-h growth of culture. The presence of glucose in the
   culture medium inhibited the mimosine degradation enzyme induction by
   mimosine, while the presence of NH4Cl in the growth medium had no
   significant effect of inhibition on mimosine degradation enzyme
   induction. The mimosine degradation enzyme was purified with 47\%
   recovery in three steps, ammonium sulphate fractionation, ion exchange
   and size exclusion-chromatography, with overall 34.59-fold purification.
   The purified native form had an estimated molecular mass of 280 kDa and
   was found to composed of four subunits each of molecular mass similar to
   70 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. Km for mimosine was found to be 1.3
   mM. The purified enzyme showed sharp pH optima at 7.2. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {Daily supplements of dried Leucaena leaf meal (500 g/head) were offered
   for 3 wk to steers in metabolism cages. The steers had previously been
   fed diets of oaten chaff (5 kg/head per day) or molasses and urea (4.5
   kg/head per day) with restricted forage (2 kg/head per day). Excretion
   rates of the primary degradation product of mimosine, 3-hydroxy-4(1H)
   pyridone (DHP) by steers fed the 2 diets were compared. These compounds
   appeared in urine on the 1st day after Leucaena feeding had commenced
   and output remained fairly constant after 4 days. Mean weekly urinary
   outputs (g) of DHP from steers fed the oaten chaff or molasses + urea
   diet were 13.45 and 7.50, respectively. These levels corresponded to
   0.23 and 0.13 of the amounts ingested. When steers were fed the molasses
   + urea diet, DHP continued to appear in urine up to 5 days after
   Leucaena was withdrawn from the diet. On the oaten chaff diet no DHP was
   detected after 3 days following withdrawal of Leucaena. The effects of
   casein or  formaldehyde-treated casein supplements on the output of
   urinary DHP by steers fed oaten chaff plus Leucaena was evaluated in a
   2nd concurrent experiment. The animals were fed the test diets for 3 wk
   before collections were made. Mean DHP outputs (g/day) from animals fed
   the control diet, control diet plus casein or control diet plus
   formaldehyde-treated casein were 1.89, 2.21 and 2.44, respectively.
   These results confirm substantial degradation of DHP and that the extent
   of degradation can be  affected by the dietary regime in which Leucaena
   is fed.},

Abstract = {Four Thai swamp buffaloes (SB) and four Murrah buffaloes (MB) fed a
   based diet of fresh ruzi grass (Bachiaria ruziziensis) with an increased
   proportion of fresh leucaena leaves. Intake of nutrients in animals
   increased when ruzi grass was mixed with leucaena. Digestibility of
   nutrients were the highest in SB and MB fed diets containing 25\% and
   50\% of leucaena, respectively, and nitrogen (N) balances in both animal
   breeds were varied among diets. The regression equation coefficient of
   mimosine + DHP in the urine was twice as high in SB than in MB. Urinary
   purine derivatives excretion rate in SB was higher than that in MB.
   Plasma triiodothyronine and thyroxine declined in both animal breeds fed
   a diet containing > 1 g mimosine intake/kg BW0.75/day. Plasma urea-N was
   the lowest in SB, but the highest in MB when fed a diet containing 84\%
   of leucaena. Plasma beta-HBA in SB have declined when diets contained >
   50\% of leucaena but that in MB was not affected by any diet. In
   conclusion, the effect of leucaena in diet upon buffalo breeds depends
   on the proportion of leucaena in the diet, mimosine contents and
   condensed tannins components.},

Abstract = {The presence of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) in sheep is a low
   productivity cause. This study aimed to determine the in vitro
   efficiency of Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Guazuma
   ulmifolia, and Bursera simaruba aqueous extracts at three different
   doses (0.75, 1.00, and 1.25 mL), inhibiting the egg hatching of GIN from
   sheep. The inhibition efficiency in egg hatching (IEH), larval
   identification, and its genera proportion were evaluated. Analysis of
   data was performed using Chi-square tests and analysis of variance. The
   four extracts obtained an IEH of 50\%, being similar (p > 0.05) between
   them. The 1.25 mL dose and its combinations of Leucaena leucocephala and
   Gliricidia sepium at 1.25 mL dose obtained the highest efficiency (68.0,
   85.0, and 77.0\%, respectively). Five genera of larva were identified
   (Haemonchus spp, Trichostrongylus spp, Oesophagostomum spp, Cooperia
   spp, and Nematodirus spp). The highest prevalence (p <= 0.05) was
   obtained by Haemonchus spp (58.0\%). According to the results, the four
   aqueous extracts exhibited ovicidal activity (GIN). However, the 1.25 mL
   dose and the Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium extracts at 1.25
   mL doses were the most effective.},

Abstract = {Feed quality in rangelands reaches an all-time low during the dry season
   thus affecting animal performance. The use of farm-formulated
   supplements is an alternative which can be adopted to minimise the
   effects of nutritional stress. However, the effects of supplementing
   nursing cows, twice a week with farm-formulated diets; on cow
   maintenance, calf weaning weight and conception rate is little known.
   Thirty indigenous Mashona cows were allocated to five treatments of a
   commercial supplement known as beef survival meal, urea-treated maize
   stover, Leucaena leucocephala meal, mixed forage meal and without
   supplements. The study was repeated with a new set of nursing cows each
   year for 3 years. Nutrient composition of treatment diets varied with
   Leucaena leucocephala having more crude protein than the other diets.
   Forage-supplemented groups had higher (P < 0.05) rate of weight increase
   and weaning weights with Leucaena leucocephala and beef survival meal
   having better results among the groups. Nursing cows that were in
   protein-supplemented groups had significantly higher (P < 0.05)
   conception rate than the group of nursing cows, which were not offered
   the protein supplements. We concluded that, with farm-formulated
   supplements given twice per week, nursing cows can maintain better body
   condition, wean heavier calves and successful conceive every year thus
   improving animal productivity.},

Journal = {FIELD CROPS RESEARCH},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {Farmers' maize (Zea mays) yields in semiarid Kenya are low because of
   low and erratic rainfall and soil nutrient depletion. An experiment was
   conducted in Machakos, Kenya, during November 1989-July 1995 to explore
   the potential of hedgerow intercropping (HI) with Leucaena leucocephala
   as an alternative strategy to the use of inorganic fertilizers for
   improving maize yields in semiarid bimodal highlands. The study,
   conducted in a randomized block design with three replications,
   evaluated on an operational scale with four treatments: sole maize with
   or without fertilizer; and HI with prunings of L. leucocephala hedges
   used as green manure or with prunings and maize stover fed to oxen and
   manure returned to soil. About 1.4 t ha(-1) of L. leucocephala foliar
   biomass and 1.2 t ha(-1) manure were incorporated each season in
   green-manure and ox-manure systems, respectively. Although sole maize
   responded to inorganic fertilizer in six of 11 seasons, maize yield was
   improved by HI, with prunings used as green manure, only once, 5 yrs
   after the commencement of the study, when rainfall exceeded 500 mm. Over
   the experimental period, maize yields were 15\% and 30\% less in
   green-manure and ox-manure systems, respectively, than in unfertilized
   maize, primarily because of the competition of hedgerows with crops for
   water. The fodder system of HI recycled only 27\% of N and 50\% of P
   exported from the field in fodder, grain and stover, and depleted
   nutrients more than the other systems. The green-manure system made a
   positive N balance, with similar P depletion as in the fodder system. No
   changes were detected in soil organic carbon or cations in any of the
   systems during the experimental period while extractable P was
   significantly improved by fertilizing maize. Net present value of
   returns from fertilizing maize at 40 kg N and 18 kg P ha(-1) was 10\%
   higher than from the unfertilized control. Fertilizer use would be 25\%
   more profitable, however, if P were applied only to match the amount of
   P removed by crop (9 kg P ha(-1) per season) and if maize were not
   topdressed (amounting to 50\% of the recommended N) in poor rainfall
   seasons. Of the two HI systems, only the fodder system was more
   profitable than either system of sole-cropped maize because the high
   value of fodder more than compensated the smaller maize yield obtained
   in HI. However, the fodder system may not give higher economic returns
   than a sole L. leucocephala fodder bank. Hence, HI using competitive
   species such as L. leucocephala and with the level of productivity
   observed in this study, is not appropriate for semiarid climates to
   increase cereal yields, either directly through green manuring or
   indirectly by fodder production and nutrient cycling through livestock.

   considerable losses occurred during drying at 60 and 145.degree. C, and
   as a result of blanching in hot water or FeSO4 solution. Loss rates of
   carotenes during storage were in the range 19-40 mg/kg per mo. and of

   were most stable during storage. Pelleting or inclusion of ethoxyquin
   did not reduce carotenoid loss rates below those of unpelleted leaf
   meal. The mimosine content of untreated sun-dried leucaena leaf meal was
   3.2\%, but the concentration decreased to 2.5 and 1.8\% on drying at 60

Abstract = {Soil infertility is one of the constraints contributing to poor sorghum
   production in semi-arid areas across Africa. To increase sorghum
   production, there is need to address soil fertility issues. Therefore,
   the objective was to assess the effects of Leucaena/cattle manure
   combination on grain and stover yields, harvest index and net return of
   two sorghum varieties (Macia and SV1) under rainwater harvesting
   techniques. The field experiment was conducted as a randomized complete
   block design over three cropping seasons in a split-split plot
   arrangement. Results show significant (P < 0.05) increase in sorghum
   grain yield with increased applications of Leucaena/cattle manure
   combination. Macia variety had statistically greater (P < 0.05) grain
   yield than SV1 variety. Tied contour show considerably higher yield for
   both varieties across all seasons. Stover yield show significant
   differences (P < 0.05) as affected by Leucaena/cattle manure and
   rainwater harvesting techniques. Rainwater harvesting techniques
   significantly influence (P < 0.05) harvest index, with tied contour and
   infiltration pits having comparably higher harvest index than standard
   contour. Application of Leucaena/cattle manure combination show
   significant increases in harvest index with increased application rates.
   However, no significant effect was observed at 20 and 30 t ha(-1) from
   SV1 variety across all seasons. Leucaena/cattle manure combination
   significantly influenced (P < 0.05) sorghum net return across all
   seasons except at 5 t ha(-1) where no significant effect was observed.
   Macia variety had higher net return than SV1. To increase grain yield
   and net return, farmers can adopt Macia variety, tied contour and 10 t
   ha(-1) Leucaena/cattle manure combination due to higher incremental
   yield per tonne.},

Abstract = {Caffeoyl coenzyme A O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) is an important enzyme
   that participates in lignin biosynthesis especially in the formation of
   cell wall ferulic esters of plants. It plays a pivotal role in the
   methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group of caffeoyl CoA. Two cDNA clones
   that code CCoAOMT were isolated earlier from subabul and in the present
   study; 3D models of CCoAOMT1 and CCoAOMT2 enzymes were built using the
   MODELLER7v7 software to find out the substrate binding sites. These two
   proteins differed only in two amino acids and may have little or no
   functional redundancy. Refined models of the proteins were obtained
   after energy minimization and molecular dynamics in a solvated water
   layer. The models were further assessed by PROCHECK, WHATCHECK,
   Verify\_3D and ERRAT programs and the results indicated that these
   models are reliable for further active site and docking analysis. The
   refined models showed that the two proteins have 9 and 10 alpha-helices,
   6 and 7 beta-sheets respectively. The models were used for docking the
   substrates CoA, SAM, SAH, caffeoyl CoA, feruloyl CoA, 5-hydroxy feruloyl
   CoA and sinapyl CoA which showed that CoA and caffeoyl CoA are binding
   with high affinity with the enzymes in the presence and absence of SAM.
   It appears therefore that caffeoyl CoA is the substrate for both the
   isoenzymes. The results also indicated that CoA and caffeoyl CoA are
   binding with higher affinity to CCoAOMT2 than CCoAOMT1. Therefore,
   CCoAOMT2 conformation is thought to be the active form that exists in
   subabul. Docking studies indicated that conserved active site residues
   Met58, Thr60, Val63, Glu82, Gly84, Ser90, Asp160, Asp162, Thr169, Asn191
   and Arg203 in CCoAOMT1 and CCoAOMT2 enzymes create the positive charge
   to balance the negatively charged caffeoyl CoA and play an important
   role in maintaining a functional conformation and are directly involved
   in donor-substrate binding.},

   association often effective. Lablab was effectively nodulated by its own
   fast-growing isolate but only formed root swellings, possibly
   ineffective pseudonodules, with the other isolates. Slow-growing
   rhizobia which were able to nodulate Macroptilium atropurpureus were
   unable to form nodules on these legumes except Lablab which was
   considered more akin to the cowpea group. All fast-growing isolates
   nodulated, often effectively, Vigna unguiculata and V. unguiculata ssp.
   sesquipedalis. The isolate from Lablab also effectively nodulated a
   number of other tropical legumes which have previously only been
   reported to nodulate with slow-growing nodule bacteria and it also
   produced ineffective nodulation on Medicago sativa. This is the 1st
   record of an effective fast-growing isolate from Lablab.},

Abstract = {The aims of this study were to evaluate forage production and
   nutritional quality of the elephant grass, leucaena and pigeon pea
   beans, grown in monocrop or in intercropping systems in Cerrado /
   Pantanal ecotones in both, dry and rainy, seasons. Experimental design
   was completely randomized with five treatments and five repetitions. The
   treatments were: elephant grass, leucaena and pigeon pea all of these in
   monocrop; intercropping elephant grass with Leucaena; intercropping
   elephant grass with pigeon pea. During the rainy season, it was carried
   out three cuts at intervals of 60 days, and in the dry season a single
   cut with 180 days. In the rainy season, the biomass produced of the
   forages elephant grass, leucaena and pigeon pea corresponded
   respectively to 72, 64, 76\% of the annual production. Under
   intercropping system, fodder behaves similarly, with the average of 72\%
   of annual production. During this period, the nutritional quality of the
   forages was also higher than the dry season. In the dry period, there
   was decreased the production of biomass and a reduction in the
   proportion of leaves in all the forage, regardless of cultivation
   system. In both seasons (rainy and dry), the forage grown under
   intercropping system showed higher dry matter production in relation to
   monocrop system, with most of this production coming of elephant grass.
   The intercropping elephant grass with the pigeon pea has the highest
   production of dry matter, while the intercropping elephant grass with
   Leucaena has better nutritional quality.},

   This study was aimed to determine the effect of the combination of
   Leucaena leucocephala, Swietenia mahagoni, and Artocarpus heterophyllus
   as a tannin source on in vitro ruminal fermentation kinetics. The
   combination leaves consist of Swietenia mahagoni (40\%), Leucaena
   leucocephala (30\%), and Artocarpus heterophyllus (30\%). The levels of
   combination leaves which used were 0\%, 50\%, and 100\% as forage
   sources (60\%) and concentrate 40\%. Feed fermentation was conducted
   using Menke and Steingass gas production technique for 48 hours. Kinetic
   of gas production was analyzed using the Fit Curve program. Data
   obtained were analyzed using one way ANOVA, and continued by DMRT. The
   results showed that gas production from soluble fractions (a) was not
   affected by the treatment. Gas production from the potentially degraded
   fraction (b) decreased significantly (P<0.05) at 100\% combination
   leaves. The potential extent of gas production (a+b) decreased
   significantly (P<0.05) at 100\% combination leaves. The gas production
   rate (c) increased significantly (P<0.05) at 100\% combination leaves.
   Inclusion of 100\% of combination leaves in the diet could reduce rumen
   gas production and the soluble and the potentially degraded fraction
   (a+b) and gas.},

Abstract = {The effects of leucaena hedgerows, mulching with leucaena foliage (0, 50
   and 100\% of harvested foilage), cowpea intercropping and addition of
   diary cattle slurry (55 t ha-1 per maize crop) on the yield of maize
   from a sandy soil were assessed.  The four-year results from five maize
   crops are reported.
   Except in the first year, yields of maize grain and stover were
   significantly reduced by 30\% in the presence of leucaena hedgerows. 
   Use of leucaena mulch eliminated this effect; application of all the
   harvested leucaena mulch (100\%) increased the total maize grain yield
   of the five crops by 44\% over sole maize.  Hedgerow and mulching
   management required an additional 36 mandays labour ha-1 which was more
   than compensated by the increased maize yields.  Furthermore leucaena
   hedgerows substantially depressed the growth of weeds between cropping
   seaons.
   Intercropping with cowpea significantly depressed yields of maize grain
   and stover when both crops were sown together, but not in later seasons
   when cowpea was sown four weeks after the maize.  Application of slurry
   increased the total yields of maize grain and stover by 35 and 37\%,
   respectively.  The grain yield of maize in leucaena hedgerow treatments
   fertilized with slurry did not respond to application of more than 50\%
   of leucaena foliage, which suggested that half of the foliage could be
   spared for feeding to livestock.  The cumulative yield of maize grain
   from the highest yielding organic system was 85\% of the yield from the
   fertilizer treatment.
   The study, which is continuing, demonstrates that large increases in
   agricultural productivity are possible through the intercropping of
   maize with woody forage and grain legumes and the integration of dairy
   cattle production into the system.  It thus shows the importance of
   exploiting crop/livestock interactions.},

Abstract = {The biomass and the diversity of the soil macrofauna was studied during
   three years in ten grasslands. The data were processed using a general
   linear model. The types of grassland varied from natural grasslands with
   or without leucaena on humic calcimorphic soil in a system for fattening
   cattle to grasslands of improved grasses with or without trees on a red
   ferralic soil in a system for dairy cattle. The number of individuals of
   the macrofauna was very variable in each system and between years and
   also showed interaction. In the grasslands 1, 2 and 3 that were
   established on humic soil in beef production systems, the highest number
   of individuals (between 6 and 14 individuals/m(2)) was found and showed
   the most stable performance during the three years. The,grasslands 4 and
   5, established in dairy systems on a brown soil, had, in general, a
   performance poorer than the rest, except the grassland 9 (star grass
   without shade on a red ferralic soil). This grassland had a lower number
   of individuals (3.57 and 3.70 individuals/m(2) in the first and third
   years, respectively). The grasslands 6, 7, 8 and 10, on a red ferralic
   soil, showed a similar performance (with values between 4 and 8
   individuals/m(2)) and the latter was the most stable during the last
   three years. The biomass was superior in those established on humic
   calcimorphic and brown calcic soil (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) with values higher
   than 30 g/m(2). The lowest biomass was found in the grasslands on red
   ferralic soil (6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). The macrofauna in all the grasslands
   was very similar and was composed of three phyla, five classes and seven
   orders. The classification of worms indicated the presence of two genera
   in all the grasslands. In the third system, the genus Diplotrema was
   also found. It is concluded that the macrofauna performance varied
   between the systems studied and biomass was superior in those developed
   on humic calciporphic and brown calcic soil. The third grassland had the
   best performance, with higher diversity of worms. The systems with trees
   maintained more stability in the performance of the macrofauna during
   the experiment.},

Abstract = {Xiaojiang drainage basin is one of the regions suffering from serious
   erosion and ecological degeneration due to the climate, geological and
   geomorphological conditions and the heavy human activities.
   Reforestation, which has been done since 1980s in the region, is an
   effective measure for the ecological restoration. Four types of
   plantations, i.e., Eucalyptus spp., Acacia mearnsii, Leucaena
   leucocephala and Pinus yunnanensis are investigated in the sample plots.
   Development processes and community structures of the tree layers, shrub
   layers and grass layers are studied with the ``ergodic hypothesis{''}
   method and the index of species richness, coverage, importance value and
   Shannon\_Wiener index et al, and erosion control abilities of the four
   types of plantations are compared in this paper. The result shows that
   the plantations of Acacia mearnsii and Leucaena leucocephala grow
   faster, which have higher crown coverages and stronger erosion control
   abilities than that of Pinus yunnanensis and Eucalyptus spp.. The Firms
   yunnanensis plantation has a higher secondary understory biodiversity,
   the Eucalyptus spp. plantation has a high secondary understory
   biodiversity, but the plantations of Acacia mearnsii and Leucaena
   leucocephala have low secondary understory biodiversities. Study in this
   paper shows that the four types of plantation have distinct effects in
   promoting plant diversity and have different erosion control abilities.
   So plantation species selection and association mode should be
   considered in the process of reforestation for ecological restoration.},

Abstract = {A sustainable management of soils with low natural fertility on family
   farms in the humid tropics is a great challenge and overcoming it would
   be an enormous benefit for the environment and the farmers. The
   objective of this study was to assess the environmental and agronomic
   benefits of alley cropping, based on the evaluation of C sequestration,
   soil quality indicators, and corn yields. Combinations of four legumes
   were used in alley cropping systems in the following treatments:
   Clitoria fairchildiana + Cajanus cajan; Acacia mangium + Cajanus cajan;
   Leucaena leucocephala + Cajanus cajan; Clitoria fairchildiana + Leucaena
   leucocephala; Leucaena leucocephala + Acacia mangium and a control. Corn
   was used as a cash crop. The C content was determined in the different
   compartments of soil organic matter, CEC, available P, base saturation,
   percentage of water saturation, the period of the root hospitality
   factor below the critical level and corn yield. It was concluded that
   alley cropping could substitute the slash and burn system in the humid
   tropics. The main environmental benefit of alley cropping is the
   maintenance of a dynamic equilibrium between C input and output that
   could sustain up to 10 Mg ha(-1) of C in the litter layer, decreasing
   atmospheric CO2 levels. Alley cropping is also beneficial from the
   agricultural point of view, because it increases base saturation and
   decreases physical resistance to root penetration in the soil layer 0 -
   10 cm, which ensures the increase and sustainability of corn yield.},

Abstract = {Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 can catabolize mimosine, a toxic amino acid
   produced by the tree-legume leucaena. The mid and pyd genes involved in
   mimosine degradation in TAL1145 are located in two clusters within a
   25-kb region in the chromosome, which was cloned in plasmid pUHR263. A
   5.5-kb EcoRI fragment, located between the mid and pyd genes in pUHR263,
   was characterized by sequencing and transposon- insertion mutagenesis
   and six open reading frames (ORF) were identified. Based on high
   homologies with other known proteins and conserved signature domains,
   ORF1 and ORF2 were identified as fba and fbp genes, encoding
   fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
   (FBP), respectively. The fba mutant showed a slightly reduced growth
   rate compared to TAL1145 while the fbp mutant did not show any growth
   defects. Both mutants could catabolize mimosine and formed normal
   nitrogen-fixing nodules on leucaena, suggesting that these genes are not
   involved in mimosine degradation and symbiosis.},

Title = {The concordance between greenhouse gas emissions, livestock production
   and profitability of extensive beef farming systems},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {370-384},
Note = {Greenhouse Gas and Animal Agriculture Conference (GGAA), Melbourne,
   AUSTRALIA, FEB 14-18, 2016},
Abstract = {Here we examine the concordance among emissions, production and gross
   margins of extensive beef farming systems by modelling a range of
   scenarios for herd management, animal genotype and pasture nutritive
   quality. We based our simulations on a case-study farm in central
   Queensland, Australia, and studied the influence of interventions
   designed for emissions mitigation, increasing productivity, or
   increasing gross margin. Interventions included replacing urea
   supplementation with nitrate, finishing cattle on the perennial forage
   leucaena (L), herd structure optimisation (HO), higher female fecundity
   (HF), and a leucaena finishing enterprise that had net farm emissions
   equal to the baseline (leucaena equal emissions; LEE). The HO
   intervention reduced the ratio of breeding cows relative to steers and
   unmated heifers, and lowered the ratio of costs to net cattle sales.
   Gross margin of the baseline, nitrate, L, LEE, HO and HF scenarios were
   AU\$146000, AU\$91000, AU\$153000, AU\$170000, AU\$204000 and
   AU\$216000, respectively. Enterprises with early joining of maiden
   heifers as well as HO and HF further increased gross margin
   (AU\$323000), while systems incorporating all compatible interventions
   (HO, HF, early joining, LEE) had a gross margin of AU\$315000. We showed
   that interventions that increase liveweight turnoff while maintaining
   net farm emissions resulted in higher gross margins than did
   interventions that maintained liveweight production and reduced net
   emissions. A key insight of this work was that the relationship between
   emissions intensity (emissions per unit liveweight production) or
   liveweight turnoff with gross margin were negative and positive,
   respectively, but only when combinations of (compatible) interventions
   were included in the dataset. For example, herd optimisation by reducing
   the number of breeding cows and increasing the number of sale animals
   increased gross margin by 40\%, but this intervention had little effect
   on liveweight turnoff and emissions intensity. However, when herd
   optimisation was combined with other interventions that increased
   production, gross margins increased and emissions intensity declined.
   This is a fortuitous outcome, since it implies that imposing more
   interventions with the potential to profitably enhance liveweight
   turnoff allows a greater reduction in emissions intensity, but only when
   each intervention works synergistically with those already in place.},

Abstract = {Steers were fed in pens on diets containing 0, 10, 20, 40, 67 and 100\%

   sorghum hay. Liveweight {[}LW] change, feed intake, mimosine intake,
   urinary output of 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone (DHP), serum thyroxine (T4),
   serum triiodothyronine (T3) and effective thyroxine ratio (ETR) were
   measured. Steers on the 67 and 100\% Leucaena diets had low feed intake
   (40-50 g (kg LW)-0.75), lost weight and were severely hypothyroid.
   Steers on the 0, 10 and 20\% Leucaena had intakes of 80-90 g (kg
   LW)-0.75, gained liveweight at 0.3-0.5 kg day-1 and showed normal
   thyroid function. Steers on the 40\% Leucaena diet had high feed intakes
   and grew well initally, but subsequently their feed intakes and rates of
   liveweight gain declined. Reduced feed intake was associated with serum
   T3 levels below 1.0 nmol l-1. DHP excretion in the urine was linearly
   related to Leucaena and mimosine intake (P < 0.01). Recoveries of
   mimosine eaten, as DHP in the urine, varied from 33\% with the 10\%
   Leucaena diet to 55\% with full Leucaena feeding. Feed intake declined
   as the proportion of Leucaena in the diet increased, but recovery of
   appetite was rapid when steers were transferred to an all-sorghum hay
   ration. Diets containing less than 1\% mimosine on a DM basis have
   little adverse effect on thyroid function or feed intake; above this
   level hypothyroidism and low feed intakes may occur. Under Australian
   conditions Leucaena can only safely be used as a supplement (< 30\%) to
   roughage diets, rather than as a major dietary component, until some
   solution to the toxicity problem is found.},

Abstract = {Imperata is shade-intolerant, although little is known of the relative
   roles of competition for light, water and nutrients in suppressing its
   growth. Shading of Imperata results in reduced carbohydrate storage,
   reduced rhizome and tuber-bulb production, reduced shoot dry weight,
   increased susceptibility to competition, increased susceptibility to
   herbicides and decreased vigor/regeneration. Herbaceous cover crops in
   the genera Calapogonium, Crotoleria, Mucuna and Pueraria have been shown
   to effectively suppress Imperata growth and can be used to prevent and
   in some cases eradicate Imperata. Tree fallows with fast-growing species
   such as Sesbania sesban, Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala can
   improve soil physical and chemical properties and suppress weed growth.
   Forest plantations have been successfully used, particularly with the
   use of moderate to high tillage, weeding and fertilizer inputs to
   suppress Imperata growth. These plantations produce marketable wood and
   reclaim the site for other uses. Additional research is needed to
   evaluate the specific nature of competition and allelopathic effects
   from Imperata. Continued evaluation of tree species and provenances for
   Imperata suppression, forms of tillage after woody fallow crops and the
   constraints to adoption of cover crops and trees as Imperata control
   measures are also needed.},

Abstract = {Soil samples to a depth of 90 cm were collected in 1996 from adjacent 1
   ha paddocks which had either been established to a leucaena-based or
   nitrogen-fertilised and irrigated pasture system in 1960 at Samford,
   south-eastern Queensland, to assess the impact of these production
   systems on soil chemical properties. The chemical properties were
   compared with those of soil samples collected from the site in 1960.
   Soil pH under both the nitrogen-fertilised and leucaena-based systems
   have declined significantly to a depth of 40 cm against that of the soil
   samples collected in 1960. However, the extent of acidification was
   higher under the more intensively managed nitrogen-fertilised system
   compared with the leucaena-based system. The acidification rates for the
   nitrogen-fertilised and leucaena-based pasture systems over the 36-year
   period are 5.1 and 1.0 kmol H+/ha. year, respectively, and are similar
   to values observed under annual pasture systems of temperate southern
   Australia. Associated with the decline in pH there was a decline in
   exchangeable Ca2+ in the nitrogen-fertilised system and a corresponding
   increase in exchangeable acidity.
   The contribution of the nitrogen cycle to net acidification for the
   leucaena-based pasture system was estimated to account for 20\% of the
   total net acid addition. This result is discussed in the light of a
   similar study undertaken in the semi-arid tropics where the contribution
   of the nitrogen cycle by a similar leucaena-based system was estimated
   to be 78\% of the net acidification.},

Abstract = {Human encroachment and rapid usage of antibiotics, and toxic chemicals
   have given rise to fatal waterborne diseases and drinking water crises.
   This work focuses on the phytofabrication of silver nanoparticle-doped
   polyurethane membranes (PUM) for wastewater treatment via amoxicillin
   degradation and its antimutagenic potential. Fresh leaf extracts of
   Acokanthera oppositifolia and Leucaena leucocephala were utilized for
   the reduction and capping of silver ions. The structural properties of
   nanoparticles were studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy
   dispersive analysis (EDAX), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FTIR). The ability of a polyurethane membrane embedded with silver
   nanoparticles to remove amoxicillin and residual antimicrobial in
   treated water was also tested. Additionally, antimutagenic activity
   against Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA 98 and 100) with
   2-aminofluorene and sodium azide mutagens was investigated in filtered
   water. The effectiveness of the developed membrane was assessed in a
   sewage sample using the catalase test and plating on an agar plate to
   estimate the reduction in the microbial population. The finding reveals
   that the membranes doped with nanoparticles of Leucaena leucocephala
   demonstrated the highest amoxicillin degradation (94\%) and
   antimutagenic (99.0\%) with pseudo-first-order kinetics R-2 of 0.96. The
   microbial population was reduced from 1.13x10(5) to 3.04x10(2 )and
   2.16x10(2) CFU/mL after filtration by PUM-doped nanoparticles of
   Acokanthera oppositifolia and Leucaena leucocephala, respectively. The
   results conclude that polyurethane membranes doped with silver
   nanoparticles are very effective in wastewater treatment and hold great
   promise for wastewater remediation applications.},

   space between the coffee plants, in the following treatments: Control,
   Leucaena leucocephala, Crotalaria spectabilis, Crotalaria breviflora,
   Mucuna pruriens, Mucuna deeringiana, Arachis hypogaea and Vigna
   unguiculata. The legume crops influenced the microbial activity, both
   under the coffee canopy and in the inter row space. The cultivation of
   Leucaena leucocephala increased the microbial biomass C, N and P.
   Although L. leucocephala and Arachis hypogaea provided higher microbial
   biomass, the qCO(2) decreased by up to 50\% under the coffee canopy and
   by about 25\% in the inter row space. The soil microbial biomass was
   enriched in N and P due to green manure residue addition.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) is a vigorous, rapidly growing, drought
   tolerant, palatable and high yielding tropical legume, enriched in
   protein (25-35\% CP) and other nutritional components.
   Despite abundant nutritional qualities Leucaena leucocephala contains a
   toxic compound mimosine which limits its full scale utilization.
   Ruminant animals, when fed on Leucaena diet, may show signs like
   alopecia, anorexia, lameness, ulcer in buccal cavity, sticky salivation,
   hypothyroidism and goiter. These are mainly attributed to mimosine
   itself and its metabolites produced in the rumen. Mimosine is converted
   to 3,4 dihydroxypyridine (3, 4 DHP) a goitrogenic factor which is
   usually converted to 2, 3, DHP (Ram et at., 1994) and subsequently to
   nontoxic residues in the rumen (Feng and Atreja, 1998). The 2, 3, DHP is
   as much toxic as 3, 4 DHP.
   In the present study, an attempt was made to elucidate the effect of
   feeding of Leucaena leaf meal (LLM) on body weight, circulating thyroid
   hormones, Aspartate amino transferase (AST) and Alanine amino
   Transferase (ALT) activities in cattle.},

Abstract = {The annual production of leaf litter and its contribution of N, P and K
   were determined in two grasslands of 50 ha. The grasslands were divided
   in 24 paddocks each and they were different in species composition. In
   both, dairy cows grazed with a stocking rate of 2.0 LAU/ha. The first
   grassland was composed of 30 \% Cynodon nlemfuensis cv Jamaicano, 30 \%
   Pennisetum purpureum clone CT-115, 15 \% Panicum maximum,v Likoni, 10 \%
   Paspalum notatum, 5 \% Dichantium annulatum, 5 \% Cynodon sp. and 5 \%
   Neonotonia wightii. The composition in the second grassland was 55 \%
   Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru/Panicum maximum cv Likoni, 10 \% Albizia
   lebbeck/Cynodon nlemfuensis, 10 \% Cajanus cajan/Cynodon nlemfuensis, 15
   \% Panicum maximum ev Likoni and 10 \% Leucaena leucocephala ev
   Peru/Cynodon nlemfuensis. The total leaf litter production was higher in
   the second grassland (216.2 vs 124.4 t of DM). The areas with Leucaena
   leucocephala/Panicum maximum, Cajanus cajan/Cynodon nlemfuensis and
   Leucaena leucocephalal/Cynodon nlemfuensis were outstanding and they
   contributed with 63, 14 and 12 \% of the total leaf litter,
   respectively. Likewise, the leaf litter in the second grassland provided
   more N (41.9 vs 27.6 kg/ha), P (11.0 vs 4.5 kg/ha) and K (26.0 vs 9.7
   kg/ha) than that of the first grassland that had no trees. The results
   corroborated that it is convenient to introduce shrub and tree species
   in grasslands composed, mainly, of grasses for increasing leaf litter
   production and make more efficient the biogeochemical cycle of
   nutrients.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many interspecific hybrids have been produced among Leucaena species,
   some with great potential for high-value wood and forage production.
   Superior hybrids are often highly sterile, and vegetative propagation
   would be essential for their exploitation. Four experiments were
   conducted to investigate factors affecting the rooting of cuttings of
   Leucaena hybrids. Nine hybrids were studied that represented different
   ploidy levels (2x, 3x, and 4x), different levels of seedlessness,
   different ages (5-16 years) and varying leaflet sizes. Rooting ability
   basically depended on genotype, with only a few hybrids failing to root.
   Cuttings required leaflets to root, and half or more of a leaf led to
   higher frequencies of better roots. One-node cuttings had the same
   rooting ability as two-node cuttings. Rooting ability decreased
   dramatically in the cooler, low-light winter seasons of lowland Hawaii.
   Etiolation treatments increased rooting ability significantly for two
   difficult-to-root hybrids.},

Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {226},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is a plant that is used as animal and human food
   worldwide. This plant contains the toxic compound namely L-mimosine. The
   main mechanism of action of this compound involves its ability to
   chelate metal ions, which may interfere with the proliferative activity
   of cells and being studied for the treatment of cancer. However, little
   is known about the effect of L-mimosine on immune responses. Thus, the
   aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of L-mimosine on immune
   responses in Wistar rats. Different doses of L-mimosine (25, 40 and 60
   mg/kg body weight/day) were administered orally by gavage to adult rats
   for 28 days. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed in animals, but
   a decrease in the T-dependent response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC)
   in animals treated with 60 mg/kg L-mimosine and an increase in the
   intensity of S. aureus phagocytosis by macrophages in animals treated
   with 40 or 60 mg/kg L-mimosine were observed. Therefore, these findings
   suggest that L-mimosine did not compromise macrophage activity and
   inhibited T-dependent clonal expansion during the immune response.},

Abstract = {The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of

   pomace treated with Aspergillus niger, to Leucaena silage on total gas
   production by using in vitro gas techniques. In addition, the effect of
   these enzymes on voluntary feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and
   rumen fermentation were determined using 8 male, crossbred Anglo Nubian
   x Native goats. The experiment was designed as a replicated 4 x 4 Latin
   square. The experimental treatments were randomly assigned to each
   sequence of feeding of the 4 experimental treatments, i.e., 0\%, 0.2\%,
   0.4\%, and 0.8\% (dry matter) of enzyme cocktail supplemented to
   Leucaena silage. The addition of 0.4\% enzyme cocktail increased total
   gas production at 96 h, which was not different from the addition of
   commercial cellulase. Gas production from the insoluble fraction (b) was
   improved by increasing the enzyme cocktail levels (P = 0.039). The
   voluntary intake of Leucaena silage increased with an increase in the
   addition of enzyme level (P = 0.025). The dry matter, organic matter,
   crude protein, NDF and ADF digestibility's were also increased by
   increasing the addition of enzyme cocktail level. The addition of enzyme
   cocktail increased the Prevotella\_1 in rumen fluid compared with the
   untreated group. In conclusion, at 0.4\%, the fibrolytic enzyme cocktail
   derived from A. niger increased feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and
   ruminal fibrolytic bacteria community in goats.},

Abstract = {The present research had as objective to evaluate the dynamics of the

   study was carried out in a waste dumo located in Salto de Pirapora, sao

   of individuals and species over time. The results indicate that the
   vegetation present in the waste dumps is in transition from pioneer
   forest to a more advanced successional stage. However, Leucaena
   leucocephala has established itself more expressively than other
   species, inhibiting the development of other species. Finally,

   the variables height, coverage, production of organic matter (kg/ ha),
   production of crude protein (kg/ha) and the percentage of FDN, reporting
   the best values of the silvopastoral system. It is concluded that the

Abstract = {Four rumen-fistulated male swamp buffaloes, 5-year-old with initiated
   live weight at 360 +/- 12kg, were randomly assigned according to a 4x4
   Latin square design to investigate the effect of feeding high level of
   dried Leucaena leaf (DLL) on feed intake, fermentation efficiency and
   microbial protein synthesis. The dietary treatments were the feeding
   levels of DLL at 0, 2, 4 and 6kg/head/day. All buffaloes were
   supplemented with concentrate mixtures at 0.1\% of body weight, and rice
   straw was fed adlibitum with the availability of water and mineral block
   at all time. The results revealed that the total feed intake and
   nutrient digestibility were significantly improved with the increasing
   levels of DLL feeding, and the highest was in the buffaloes consuming
   DLL at 6kg/head/day. Feeding high levels of DLL did not affect on
   ruminal pH and temperature, while ammonia nitrogen, blood urea nitrogen
   and volatile fatty acid concentration were significantly enhanced.
   Moreover, methane production was dramatically reduced by increasing
   levels of DLL feeding. Total direct counts of the micro-organism
   population were increased with the increasing levels of DLL feeding.
   According to the application of quantitative PCR to quantity
   cellulolytic bacteria (16S rRNA) targets, it was found that the
   population of total bacteria and Fibrobactor succinogenes was affected
   by treatments, while Ruminococcus flavefaciens and methanogen population
   were significantly decreased as buffaloes were fed with DLL. The
   nitrogen balance and microbial nitrogen supply were remarkably improved
   with the increasing levels of DLL feeding. Based on this study, it could
   be concluded that high levels of DLL feeding at 6kg/head/day could
   enhance feed intake, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation
   efficiency and microbial protein synthesis in swamp buffaloes fed on
   rice straw without any adverse effect.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out to evaluate in growth chambers the behaviour
   of tropical forage legumes under chilling-stress conditions. A
   hypothesis was made by which low temperatures (15/10 degrees C
   day/night) applied just before a cold stress (15/2 degrees C) period
   would influence the development of plant cold-hardening. Leucaena
   pulverulenta Sel 22, L. leucocephala cv. Peril and cv. Cunningham were
   studied. During seven days, plants were either submitted to a 15/10
   degrees C day/night regime, or maintained under 30/20 degrees C, as a
   control. To promote plant growth and recovery after the stress, a 30/20
   degrees C regime was used. The dry matter daily growth rate was
   determined. Sel 22 and cv. Cunningham showed more cold tolerance than
   cv. Peru. Legume recovery after stress was greater under the
   cold-hardening induction condition. The greatest sensibility was shown
   when plants suffered stress during active growth. Cv. Cunningham and Sel
   22 exhibited more cold-hardening than cv. Peru.},

Abstract = {A 100-day experiment of a randomized block design was conducted with
   forty Friesian x Zebu (Boran) crossbred growing steers to compare the
   value of wheat middling, an agro-industrial by-product (diet W), cowpea
   (Vigna unguiculata) hay (diet C), and wilted forages of leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocepala, diet L) and tagasaste (Chamaecytisus palmensis,
   diet T) as cattle feed. These feeds were fed daily at a level of 1.5 kg
   (on an air dry basis) to supplement the basal diet (diet H) of native
   hay. A mineral supplement containing 50 g bone meal and 10 g common salt
   was also given daily. The steers were group-fed, but during the last two
   weeks at the end of the experiment the animals were housed individually
   in feeding pens to estimate the feed intake and apparent digestibilities
   of the diets. The animals were weighed at the beginning of the
   experiment, thereafter every two weeks, and finally at the end of the
   experiment.
   The animals consumed all the offered supplements, except for tagasaste
   forage, of which one third remained unconsumed. The mean daily total dry
   matter intake during the individual feeding period ranged from 4.0 to
   5.0 kg between the diets (P<0.01). As to metabolizable energy and crude
   protein intakes, diet W ranked first, followed by diets L, C, T and H in
   descending order. The daily weight gain (g) was highest on diet W (411)
   again followed by diets L (371), C (236), H (86) and T (62). It was
   concluded that poor palatability may be a major problem in feeding
   tagasaste to growing cattle.},

Abstract = {Weed seed rain was monitored in held plots under three fallow types and
   four land-use intensities in Ibadan, Nigeria, in 1994 and 1995. The
   fallow types were natural bush, planted Leucaena leucocephala, and
   Pueraria phaseoloides. The land-use intensities consisted of continuous
   cropping, invoking Zen mayslManihot esculenta and fallowing for 1, 2,
   and 3 yr, with each fallow period followed by 1 yr of Z. maysl M.
   esculenta cultivation. In 1994, seed rain in plots cropped after P
   phaseoloides fallow was significantly lower than in plots cropped after
   bush or L. leucocephala fallow Pueraria phaseoloides plots had similar
   seed rain as bush fallow plots in 1995, and the seed rain in these plots
   was significantly lower than in L. leucocephala plots. Weed seed rain
   was significantly higher in continuously cultivated plots across all
   fallow types than in plots that were cultivated after one or more years
   of fallow. The lowest seed rain was in plots that were cropped once
   after a 3-yr fellow. The largest quantity of weed seed input in the
   plots occurred in either August or September reflecting the life cycle
   of the annual weeds that dominated the vegetation. Individual species
   differed in pattern and duration of shedding seeds within the fallow
   systems and land-use intensities. Annual weeds dominated the seed rain
   in continuously cropped plots, and seeds of perennial weeds were
   dominant in plots fallowed for more than 1 yr before cultivation. Weeds
   flowered earlier in continuously cropped plots than in plots that were
   cropped after 2 or 3 yr of fallow. Increased land-use intensity caused
   an increase in seed rain and consequently increased the soil seed bank.
   Pueraria phaseoloides fallow was more effective in shading weeds and
   probably reducing the quantity of light reaching them than the natural
   bush and planted L. leucocephala fallow systems, and this may have been
   the basis of the significantly tower seed rain in P phaseoloides plots.},

   Leucaena leucocephala was found to be active in photosynthesis at very
   high CO2 concentrations. Likewise, L. leucocephala had a higher
   lignocellulose composition than P pterocalpum. Also, a higher
   alpha-cellulose and hemicellulose content was observed in thin roots
   than in coarse roots and stem bark, while stem bark and coarse roots had
   higher level of lignin content. Overall results revealed that L.

Abstract = {This study explores the chemical composition, buffer N solubility, in
   vitro ruminal N degradability and in vitro ruminal biological activity
   of tannins in leaves from Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala,
   Morus alba and Trichanthera gigantea trees. These tree leaves are a
   potential protein source for ruminants, but their site-influenced
   nutritive value is largely unknown. Leucaena leucocephala leaves had the
   highest N content (42.1 g/kg DM), while T. gigantea leaves had the least
   (26.1 g/kg DM). Leucaena leucocephala had the highest buffer solubility
   index (20\%), while 10\% of the total N in leaves of the other three
   species was soluble. The rapidly fermentable N fraction `a' was highest
   in M. alba leaves (734.9 g/kg DM) and least in T. gigantea leaves (139.5
   g/kg DM). The rate of fermentation (c) was highest for M. alba
   (7\%/hours) leaves. No significant correlations were recorded between
   buffer solubility index of N and in vitro ruminal N degradability
   parameters: a, b, and c. The highest response to tannin inactivation
   using polyethylene glycol, in terms of percentage increase in 36-hours
   cumulative gas production, was recorded in M. alba (39\%) and T.
   gigantea (38\%) leaves. It was concluded that buffer solubility of N is
   not a good indicator of ruminal N degradation in the leaves of these
   tree species. Leaves of M. alba could be more valuable as a source of
   rapidly fermentable N when animals are offered low-protein, high-fibre
   diets compared with other tree species evaluated in the current study.
   However, when feeding M. alba leaves, the role of tannins must be
   considered because these secondary plant compounds showed significant in
   vitro ruminal biological activity.},

Abstract = {Although alley cropping is a technology for sustained crop production,
   analyses of long-term trials are lacking in the literature.  A trial was
   conducted to study the long-term effects of alley cropping on maize
   under continuous cropping with and without fertilizer.  Maize was
   planted twice a year for four years.  Maize yields were higher with
   alley cropping than without alley cropping from the fourth crop onward. 
   Fertilizer application increased yield for each crop.  Average yields
   over the eight crops were highest for the combination of alley cropping
   and fertilizer application.  The long-term effects of the treatments on
   maize yield were estimated by regression of grain yield on time
   expressed as consecutive maize crops.  A dummy variable was included in
   the multiple regression equations to account for cropping seasons in
   which drought or other factors severely reduced yields.  Without alley
   cropping, maize yields declined, while with alley cropping, maize yields
   increased over time.  Alley cropping with moderate fertilizer use may be
   the best means to stabilize yield and to increase productivity where
   long fallow periods are no longer possible.},

Abstract = {A greenhouse experiment was carried out with the objective of evaluating
   the effects of the elementary sulphur inoculated with Thiobacillus,
   compared with gypsum, in the amendment of a alluvial sodic saline soil
   from the Brazilian semiarid region, irrigated with saline water and
   grown with the tropical legumes leucena and mimosa. The treatments
   consisted of levels of sulphur (0; 300 and 600 kg/ha) and gypsum (1200
   and 2400 kg/ha), irrigation using different waters containing the salts
   NaHCO3, MgCl2, CaCl2, NaCl and KCI, with different electrical
   conductivities (ECs: 0.2, 6.1 and 8.2 dS/m at 25 degreesC). Based on the
   results it appears that saline water increased exchangeable Na+, K+,
   Ca2+, Mg2+, and soil pH. Sulphur inoculated with Thiobacillus was more
   efficient than gypsum in the reduction of the exchangeable sodium of the
   soil and promoting leaching of salts, especially sodium. Sulphur
   inoculated with Thiobacillus reduced the EC of the soil saturation
   extract to levels below that adopted in sod classification of sodic or
   saline sodic. Leucena was more tolerant to salinity and mimosa more
   resistant to acidity promoted by sulphur inoculated with Thiobacillus.

Abstract = {Seed produced on a single clone of a self-incompatible Leucaena species
   interplanted with cross compatible pollen donors of another species
   should theoretically be interspecific hybrid seed. This paper reports on
   the parentage of seed produced on two clones (K804, K953) of L. pallida
   produced in two interspecific seed orchards during the first year of
   growth. Grafting was used to propagate the two L. pallida clones and the
   interplanted pollen donors including L. leucocephala (K420, K481, K636)
   and the Fl hybrid KX3 (L. diversifolia K156 x L. leucocephala K636).
   Seed was produced on L. pallida K804 in one orchard, and on L. pallida
   K953 in the other orchard. Seeding leaf morphological characteristics
   including pinnule pairs per pinna, pinnule width and general appearance
   were used to determine parentage of seed produced on the L. pallida
   clones in each orchard. L. pallida K804 produced 81\% interspecific
   hybrid seed while L. pallida K953 only produced 27\% hybrid seed. These
   results suggest a breakdown of the gametophytic self-incompatibility
   mechanism in L. pallida, particularly in the K953 clone. The feasibility
   and possible improvement to this seed production system are discussed.},

Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Oxidative stress and inflammatory
   conditions are among the pathological features associated with the
   central nervous system in Alzheimer's disease. Traditionally, medicinal
   plants have been used to alleviate inflammation, pains and also other
   symptoms possibly associated with Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the
   present study was designed to determine the in vitro anti-inflammatory,
   antioxidant and anticholinesterase activity of twelve South African
   medicinal plants traditionally used to alleviate pain and inflammation.
   Materials and Methods: Nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-activated RAW
   264.7 macrophages and 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory assay were used
   to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity. Acetylcholinesterase
   inhibition was assessed by using a modification of the Ellman's method.
   Antioxidant activity, total phenolic and total flavonoids contents were
   determined using standard in vitro methods.
   Results: The extract of Burkea africana had the highest
   anti-15-lipoxygenase activity with 85.92\% inhibition at 100 mu g/mL All
   the extracts tested inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production in a dose
   dependant manner in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. However,
   extracts from Leucaena leucocephala, Lippia javanica inhibited the
   production of NO by 97\% at a concentration of 25 mu g/mL In addition,
   both Leucaena leucocephala and Englerophytum magaliesmontanum had strong
   activity against acetylcholinesterase with IC50 values of 118 mu g/mL
   and 160 mu g/mL respectively. Hight levels of phenolics and flavonoids
   were found in Leucaena leucocephala, Lippia javanica and Burkea
   africana. The correlation with antioxidant activities was not strong
   indicating that other metabolites may also be involved in antioxidant
   activity.
   Conclusions: The results obtained in this study validate the use of leaf
   extracts of these plants in South African traditional medicine against
   inflammation. Extracts of these plants species might be of value in the
   management of various diseases emerging from oxidative stress and
   related degenerative disorders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

   factorial scheme (two varieties of cactus and two of hay). Goats fed
   with NC had higher (P < 0.05) intakes of dry matter, crude protein,
   neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and non-fibrous carbohydrates. There was
   no influence (P > 0.05) on milk production, but goats fed with OS
   produced milk with higher (P < 0.05) fat content and presented higher (P
   < 0.05) feed efficiency. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of the hay type
   on the nutrient intake and milk production and composition of goats, but
   the animals fed with MY had higher (P < 0.05) serum cholesterol levels
   and greater efficiency of NDF rumination. Goats fed with OS showed
   greater feeding and rumination efficiency. Our results indicated that
   both cactus species could be successfully included in the diet of low
   yielding dairy goats fed 18.4\% concentrate.},

   Index showed that root length was most strongly affected by the oil, and
   the Impact Index on Nitrogen Fixer Microorganisms indicated that,
   despite damage to the root system, L leucocephala rhizosphere bacteria
   doubled at 10,000 mg kg(-1) TPH after of 240 days of exposure. Finally,

Abstract = {Bagasse from early species of Saccharum officinerum-Co 89003 has 71.36\%
   useful, long, and thick-walled fibers with good slenderness ratio, but
   the rigidity coefficient is less than that of Eucalyptus tereticornis
   and Leucaena leucocephala. The kink index and kink per mm length are
   lower in bagasse fiber than E. terticornis, which gives rise to fewer
   weak points in the fiber. Low alcohol-benzene soluble substances in
   bagasse induce less pitch problems and favor more homogeneity in the
   paper. Lignin content in bagasse is comparable to Eucalyptus globulus
   and Leucaena leucocephala, but alpha-cellulose, and pentosans are
   slightly lower. A higher proportion of carbon content compared to
   hydrogen and oxygen increases the energy value of bagasse. It produces
   42.2\% pulp yield of kappa number 28.2 at optimum cooking conditions,
   such as active alkali 12\% ( as Na2O), temperature 150 degrees C, and
   time ( at temperature) 60 min. An addition of 0.1\% anthraquinone at the

Abstract = {Prosopis juliflora is an invasive plant species rapidly expanding in the

   Ramsar Wetland (BRW) in Sri Lanka has created several biodiversity
   conservation issues. This study was conducted to assess the possibility
   of utilizing invasive P. juliflora as an alternative energy source. P.
   juliflora performed better than L. leucocephala for most evaluated
   fuelwood properties. Ash content was comparatively higher in P.
   juliflora than L. leucocephala. However, biomass to ash ratio of P.
   juliflora was significantly lower (<0.05) and the Fuel Value Index (FVI)
   of P. juliflora (3,276) was slightly lower than that of L. leucocephala
   (3,336), a non-significant difference. P. juliflora and L. leucocephala
   reached Fiber Saturation Point within 24 and 27 days of drying,
   respectively. Results show that 1 kg of P. juliflora would produce an
   estimated energy equivalent to 0.5 L of diesel and furnace oil and 5 kWh

Abstract = {Among tropical legumes, the tree species, Leucaena leucocephala, has
   demonstrated a high potential for increasing liveweight gain. Expansion
   of its use is limited by damage from the psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana)
   and the slow rate of establishment of leucaena seedlings in some
   environments. These problems with L. leucocephala have given impetus to
   the search for alternative varieties and species of tree legumes with
   similar features. These features include longevity and versatility of
   management once established, high animal production potential, tolerance
   of a wide range of climatic and edaphic environments, and potential for
   use in a range of agroforestry applications because of their deep rooted
   habit. The shading effect of tree canopies can have a positive effect on
   understorey grass yield and quality due to improved nutrient cycling.
   There is potential for selection of higher yield, improved psyllid and
   cool temperature tolerance within the Leucaena genus. Other promising
   genera of tree legumes include Calliandra, Gliricidia, Albizia and
   Sesbania. However, there are problems of lower nutritive value and
   acceptance in some of these genera and further evaluation is required.
   Also it is not known how well these other tree legumes can tolerate
   direct grazing.
   The future acceptance of tree legumes by graziers will depend on the
   improved availability of suitable germplasm, a practical knowledge of
   their establishment and management requirements, and a clear
   demonstration of their potential economic benefits.},

   the index of biological diversity of Shannon, as the system developed.
   An increase in the abundance of bioregulator insects was observed, and
   for the birds, the sampling time showed no interaction with the

Abstract = {This study evaluates the effects of the inclusion of two different
   Leucaena species as a source of condensed tannins based on in vitro
   fermentation, methane production and post-ruminal protein supply in a
   diet based on Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman CIAT BR02/1752 grass. Under in
   vitro conditions, Leucaena leucocephala CIAT 17263 and Leucaena
   diversifolia ILRI 15551 were incubated in two proportions (25\% and 50\%
   w/w) with Cayman grass and with/without polyethylene glycol as a
   tannin-binder. The results show that substrates with Leucaena
   diversifolia produced less gas and methane than those with Leucaena
   leucocephala with and without polyethylene glycol. The mass in
   undegraded feed + solid associated microbes fraction decreased linearly
   with increasing level of inclusion of both species of Leucaena, while
   increasing its nitrogen content. It is concluded that the condensed
   tannins of Leucaena diversifolia possess the superior activity and that
   the tannin content of both evaluated Leucaenas did not affect the diet
   degradation, and reductions in post-ruminal protein did not occur in the
   present study. Further studies are needed to differentiate the tannins
   present in different Leucaena species and their dietary effects.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the intake of
   leucaena, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, fruits and a mixture of both feeds
   on in vitro gas production and in vivo sheep productive performance. The
   experiment was conducted at the University of Yucatan, Mexico.
   Twenty-four Pelibuey sheep, 20.28 +/- 2.99 kg average liveweight (LW),
   were used. Animals were randomly assigned to the following experimental
   treatments: T1: 100\% Pennisetum purpureum, T2: 30\% Leucaena
   leucocephala foliage + 70\% P. purpureum, T3: 30\% E. cyclocarpum fruits
   + 70\% P. purpureum, T4: 30\% L. leucocephala foliage + 30\% E.
   cyclocarpum fruits + 40\% P. purpureum. Voluntary intake was higher in
   T4 (grass + leucaena + E. cyclocarpum) (P = 0.0001). Higher LW gain was
   observed in animals fed with T4 (P = 0.0001) and the lowest LW gains
   were recorded with grass (T1) and grass + leucaena (T2) (78.9 and 99.2
   g/day, respectively). Similarly, the feed conversion efficiency was
   improved with treatment T4 (P = 0.0030). The in vitro gas production (48
   h) was lower by 30 mL/0.5 g fermented DM in T4 compared with the other
   treatments (P = 0.0001). Apparent DM digestibility was higher in T3 and
   T4 (P = 0.0005). The protozoa counts were lower in T2, T3 and T4 (P =
   0.0001). Higher intake, digestibility and sheep performance with diets
   containing grass + leucaena + E. cyclocarpum mixture arise from an
   improved nutritional diet as these sources have higher protein, lower
   cell walls and higher DM digestibility.},

Abstract = {Cost reduction and an increased efficiency in the utilization of
   nutrients are essential for establishing agricultural systems in the
   tropics. The combined effects of calcined Al phosphate (ALP) and
   leucaena prunings (L) on the agronomic efficiency and on the efficiency
   of physiological use of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in maize were
   assessed. The treatments consisted of 160kgha(1) of P2O5 from ALP and
   100kgha(1) of N from urea (ALP+U); 160kgha(1) of P2O5 from ALP and
   6Mgha(1) of L (ALP+L); 160kgha(1) of P2O5 from single superphosphate
   (SSP) and 100kgha(1) of N from U (SSP+U); 160kgha(1) of P2O5 from SSP
   and 6Mgha(1)of L (SSP+L); and a control without fertilization. The
   decreasing order of effectiveness among treatments was
   SSP+L>ALP+L>SSP+U>ALP+U>control. Both leucaenaphosphate combinations had
   beneficial effects on the growth of the maize, the N and P recovery, and
   the agronomic efficiencies. Both ear weight and grain weight were higher
   under the SSP+L treatment than under the SSP+U treatment and higher
   under the ALP+L treatment than under the ALP+U treatment. The low N and
   P agronomic efficiency in maize grown under the ALP+U treatment made the
   combined use of these fertilizers undesirable. The satisfactory
   efficiency of grain production shown by the maize grown under ALP+L
   indicated that this treatment could replace processed fertilizers for
   use in agrosystems management in the tropics.},

Abstract = {The use of pioneer plants, mainly nitrogen-fixing leguminous trees,
   associated to the secondary and climax species, has been making possible
   good results in the land reclamation. However, it is important to
   establish the appropriate spacing among the form species obtaining a
   fast covering and protection of the soil, without there is strong
   competition of the plants for light, water and nutrients. So, the
   objective of this work was to evaluate the growth of the Hymenaea
   courbaril and leguminous trees at, in system quincux, in different
   spacings. The treatments, in factorial scheme 3 x 3 with three
   replicates, corresponded to three species of pioneer leguminous trees
   (Acacia mangium, Senna multijuga and Leucaena leucocephala combined with
   Hymenaea courbaril) and three spacings among pioneer plants (4 x 2; 4 x
   3 and 4 x 4 m). After one and two years of planting determined the
   height, stem diameter at ground level and crown diameter of pioneer
   plants and Hymenaea courbaril. Acacia mangium showed growth
   characteristics superior to those of Senna multijuga and Leucaena
   leucocephala, however, no influence of spacing between species in
   relation to these characteristics. The growth characteristics of the
   Hymenaea courbaril were not influenced by pioneer species associated,
   however, the denser spacing between the pioneer species favored the
   greatest increase.},

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted to assess the N availability of roots of
   woody species and maize. The trial was conducted using a split-plot
   design with four replications. Four incubation periods (0, 2, 4 and 6
   months) made up the main plots. There were six subplots, consisting of
   addition of fine roots (< 2 mm diameter) of four woody species
   (Dactyladenia barteri, Senna siamea, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena
   leucocephala) and maize (Zea mays), and a control with no roots added.
   Roots from four-month-old plants were used in this study. Maize as test
   plant was grown in pots containing sandy loam soil (Psammentic
   ustorthent). Incubation period of roots before planting maize increased
   maize dry matter yield and N uptake. Addition of Gliricidia and Leucaena
   roots which have high N content and low C/N ratio (13.1 and 14.0
   respectively) improved maize dry matter yield and N uptake following 2
   months incubation. Application of maize roots which have low N content
   and high C/N ratio (40.3) reduced maize dry matter yield and N uptake.
   Application of Dacryladenia and Senna roots had an intermediate effect
   on maize dry matter yield and N uptake. Maize dry matter yield and N
   uptake were significantly and inversely correlated with the C/N ratio of
   the added roots with 0, 2, and 6 months incubation. No relationships
   were observed between the other root chemical characteristics and maize
   dry matter yield, and N uptake.},

   analysis. Multiple linear equations between in vitro and in situ
   digestibility, as dependent variables, and the age of regrowth, NDF,
   ADF, lignin, Ca, Si, NDF/N, ADF/N, tannins, condensed tannins and
   saponins, as explanatory variables, were established. An increase in
   cell wall content and its components with age of regrowth, and a
   variable response in mineral concentrations were observed. The linear
   equations relating digestibility with the age of regrowth, NDF, ADF and
   Si (R-2 > 0.78) or with the secondary metabolites tannins, condensed
   tannins and saponins (R-2 > 0.79) were statistically significant (p <
   0.05) explaining a high proportion of variance. The regrowth age, cell
   wall components, polyphenol compounds, saponins contents determined the
   forage digestibility and these aspects must be taken into consideration
   to estimate the nutritional value ofLeucaenaroughage to be used as
   feedstuff for animals.},

Abstract = {Some problems in producing good quality clove seeds were the seed's slow
   growth and the absence of technology to accelerate its growth.
   Therefore, we performed the research to get one natural Plant Growth
   Regulator and its concentration potential to enhance clove seed growth.
   The study was arranged in a completely randomized design, with two
   factors and four replications. The first factor was five kinds of
   natural plant growth regulators (PGRs): (1) Leucaena leucocephala leaf
   extract (auxin source) + coconut water (Cytokinin), (2) Leucaena
   leucocephala seedling extract (auxin source) + coconut water, (3)
   gliricidia shoot extract + coconut water and (4) sprouted onion bulb
   extract (Eleutherine bulbosa) + coconut water. The second factor was the
   concentration of PGRs: (1) control (no PGRs), (2) 2.5 ml l-1, (3) 5.0 ml
   l-1, (4) 10 ml l-1, and (5) 20 ml l-1. Parameters observed were plant
   growth (plant height, leaf number, leaf length, leaf width, and stem
   diameter), the chlorophyll content of leaves, and the auxin and
   cytokinin content of each extract. Clove seedlings' growth was observed
   until four months old. PGRs from the extract of sprouted onion
   (Eleutherine bulbosa) and Gliricidia shoots could be developed due to
   their high auxin content, which can boost clove seed growth at the
   concentration of 10 ml l-1.},

Abstract = {The intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance and energetic balance were

   ages of regrowth (28 and 42 days) and hay from leucaena at 40 days of
   regrowth, in the proportions of 20 and 40\%. Twenty Santa Ines sheep,
   kept in metabolic cages, were used in a randomised block design
   according to body weight. The hay from the Tifton 85 grass, processed at
   28 days of regrowth, resulted in a higher CP intake than when processed
   at 42 days of regrowth. There was higher protein intake for the 40\%
   proportion of leucaena hay in relation to that of 20\%, regardless of
   the regrowth age of the grass. Diets containing Tifton 85 grass
   processed at 28 days resulted in greater values for both DE and ME.
   There was greater intake, absorption and urinary excretion of N, and a
   lower N-faecal to N-urinary ratio, with diets containing Tifton 85 grass
   processed at 28 days, as well as with those diets containing 40\%
   leucaena hay. When formulating sheep diets containing hay from Tifton 85
   grass processed at 28 days of regrowth and combined with 20\% hay from
   leucaena, the grass, despite showing good energetic value, is not enough
   to provide full use of the nitrogen available to the ruminant, making it
   necessary need to find combinations with concentrated food sources which
   are able to optimise the use of nitrogen, reduce environmental impact
   and maximise sheep production.},

Abstract = {We evaluated the influence of herbaceous vegetation on the colonization
   of an invasive and two native tree species in a degraded area located at
   the Caatinga semiarid forest in Northeastern Brazil. Seedlings of the
   native trees Anadenanthera colubrina and Astronium urundeuva were
   planted in nine paired blocks with intact and removed herbaceous
   vegetation. In addition, seeds of the invasive tree species Leucaena
   leucocephala were sown in the same paired plots. Growth, germination,
   establishment, and survival of the tree species were monitored for 8
   months. The results showed that herbaceous vegetation hampered native
   seedling growth in respect to leaf number, leaf size, height, and stem
   diameter. Conversely, herbaceous vegetation had a neutral effect on the
   germination, establishment, and growth of the invasive species L.
   leucocephala. Dominant ruderal herbaceous species strongly prevent the
   natural succession of native trees in this semiarid forest, while not
   affecting the establishment of an invasive tree. Management of
   herbaceous vegetation cover in degraded areas might be a key step for
   successful restoration in this dryland.},

Abstract = {This paper studied effects of vetiver hedgerow and leucaena leucocephala
   hedgerow on fractal characteristics and erodibility of the purple soil.
   It took fractal dimension of PSD (particle-size distribution) to
   describe soil fractal characteristics, and EPIC (erosion-productivity
   impact calculator) to calculate values of soil erodibility factor K.
   Results showed that:(1) hedgerows affected spatial distributions of soil
   particles as small ones reduced in CK (check) plots, but increased in
   hedgerow plots.(2) Variations of PSD fractal dimension had negative
   linear correlation with variations of sand content with correlation
   coefficient of -0.828, but had positive linear correlations with
   variations of silt content and clay content with correlation
   coefficients of 0.638, 0.898.(3) Values of K decreased in 10 plots with
   hedgerows, especially with vetiver hedgerows.(4) Variations of K had
   significant positive correlations with variations of sand content and
   dispersion coefficient of micro-aggregate (particle size < 0.002mm), and
   their correlation coefficients were 0.980 and 0.836. Variations of K had
   negative correlation with variations of silt content, clay content,
   organic carbon content and aggregation rate, and their correlation
   coefficients were -0.925, -0.833, -0.787 and -0.716. (5) Vetiver is more
   suitable than Leucaena leucocephala for popularization and application
   on control of the purple soil erosion.},

   (CP) were calculated. In vitro digestibility of residual protein after
   24 h and 48 h incubation was also determined. Sesbania sesban had lowest
   cell wall contents and gave highest ruminal degradability for OM, NDF
   and CP. Leucaena leucocephala was degraded to a lesser extent, but its
   undegraded protein had a somewhat higher in vitro digestibility. In
   contrast, protein of Calliandra callothyrsus was poorly degraded and
   digested. The proportion and composition of cell wall could not explain
   these differences in digestion characteristics and other measurements,
   such as tannins, were incriminated. Increased ruminal incubation time

Abstract = {Nodulation, nitrogen fixation and growth in seedlings of a Senegalese
   provenance of Acacia nilotica subsp. tomentosa, inoculated with eight
   different Rhizobium strains isolated from various African Acacia
   species, were measured. The Rhizobium strains were markedly different in
   their ability to induce functional nodules suggesting, in view of
   previous reports of cross-inoculation studies; that strain specificity
   at subspecies and/or provenance level may occur in A. nilotica. Three
   strains isolated from Acacia species other than A. nilotica were
   non-invasive. Of two strains isolated from A. nilotica subsp.
   kraussiana, one strain induced formation of ineffective nodules, while
   the other induced formation of effective nodules displaying a mean
   acetylene reduction rate, on nodules from 10-week-old seedlings, of 57.7
   mu mol g(-1) h(-1). This is more than ten times higher than previously
   reported for an unspecified subspecies of A. nilotica in a field trial
   in India and compares favourably with results reported from other
   nitrogen-fixing tree species widely promoted for use in agroforestry
   such as Leucaena leucocephala. Three re-inoculated strains induced the
   formation of partially effective nodules. Seedlings with effective
   nodules had 50\% larger dry mass and more than double the total nitrogen
   content of non-nitrogen fixing seedlings. Variability in total dry
   weight, nodule dry weight and total nitrogen content of effectively
   nodulated seedlings were high and strongly positively correlated (r =
   0.88 to 0.99) indicating considerable potential to improve initial
   growth rates and nitrogen fixation in A. nilotica through selection. (C)

   partitions, hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and hydroethanolic
   from the three forage species were assessed in an inhibition of egg
   hatching (IEH) assay. The extract partitions with the highest
   anthelmintic activity (AA) were subjected to analysis, from which the
   tentative identification of the compounds was established. The extract
   partitions, including dichloromethane from Gliricidia sepium, ethyl

Abstract = {The in vitro fermentation kinetics and digestibility of six tropical
   grasses and five multipurpose tree species (MPTs) found in the Caribbean
   were determined by the current study. The in vitro gas production was
   measured and fitted to a dual and single pool model to determine the
   fermentation kinetics of these forages. The average rate of the fast
   pool (C-1) for grasses was over 20\% higher than that of the MPTs. The
   volume of the fast pool by the dual pool model (V-1) for grasses was
   40\% lower and the slow pool (V-2) 30\% greater than that of the MPTs.
   There was a strong negative relationship between the fast pool of the
   dual pool model (V-1) and the neutral detergent fibre (NDF) (r = -0.781)
   and acid detergent fibre (ADF) (r = -0.655) fractions and a positive
   relationship between the V-1 and the digestible organic matter in dry
   matter (DOMD) (r = 0.537). Moringa oleifera was at the higher end of the
   range for the total gas production by the dual pool model (Vt(scho))
   (132.1 ml/g DM) and single pool model (Vt(orsk)) (131.5 ml/g DM) at 48
   hours which was followed by that of Gliricidia sepium (116.1 and 113.5
   ml/g/DM respectively) and Morus alba (116.9 and 113.7 g/kg DM
   respectively). At 48 hours, the Vt(scho) and Vt(orsk) for Trichanthera

   for the forages (Trichanthera gigantea: 70.8 and 65.7 ml/g DM and
   Leucaena leucocephala: 89.1 and 86.2 ml/g DM for the dual and single
   pool models respectively). Moringa oleifera was at the higher end of the
   range for the total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production whereas
   Trichanthera gigantea was at the lower end of the range. All MPTs except
   Trichanthera gigantea and Leucaena leucocephala, were more fermentable
   than the grasses and based on chemical composition, in vitro
   digestibility, fermentation parameters and end products, Moringa
   oleifera and Morus alba demonstrated overall high performance whereas
   Trichanthera gigantea performed poorly.},

Abstract = {The main of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementation of
   tropical tree foliage in ruminant diets on the in vitro fermentation,
   bacterial population, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and enteric CH4
   production. Seven experimental diets were evaluated: a control treatment
   of Pennisetum purpureum (T7) and six treatments of P. purpureum
   supplemented (30\%) with the foliage of Neomillspaughia emargiata (T1),
   Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia (T2), Caesalpinia gaumeri (T3), Piscidia
   piscipula (T4), Leucaena leucocephala (T5), and Havardia albicans (T6).
   The T2, T7, and T5 treatments had the highest (p < 0.05) digestibility
   of dry matter. Overall, supplementation increased (p < 0.05) the
   concentrations of propionic and butyric acid and decreased acetic acid.
   Methanogenic bacteria decreased (p < 0.05) in T1, T2, T5, and T6.
   Ruminococcus albus decreased in T1, T2, T3, and T5 and Selenomonas
   ruminiantum increased in T3. Fibrobacter succinogenes increased, except
   in T5. Methane production decreased (p < 0.05) in T1, T4, T5, and T6.
   The supplementation with Leucaena leucocephala, Tabernaemontana
   amygdalifolia, Neomillspaughia emargiata, Piscidia piscipula, Havardia
   albicans, and Caesalpinia gaumeri is a potential alternative nutritional
   strategy for ruminants that results in positive changes in VFAs profile,
   a decrease on CH4 production and methanogenic bacteria, and changes on
   fibrolytic and non-fibrolytic bacteria composition.},

Abstract = {Using foliage of woody species as soil cover (SC) in agroforestry
   systems is an agroecological technique which may help to confront great
   challenges to food production, including conservation of soil moisture,
   provision of nutrients to the soil, and weed control. This study
   evaluated the effect of adding foliage of Leucaena leucocephala and
   Guazuma ulmifolia as SC on diversity, abundance, biomass, and potential
   for suppression of weeds. Eight treatments were established based on
   addition or not of foliage of woody species as SC to maize crop between
   alleys of the woody species. Richness, density, diversity, and
   production of weed biomass at 35, 65, and 95 days after germination of
   maize were recorded, and the potential for weed suppression was
   calculated. The study identified 47 weed species belonging to 18
   families; no significant effect of addition of foliage on diversity and
   density of weeds was found. Production of biomass was significantly
   greater in the control treatment without woody species or SC than in the
   other treatments, while the greatest potential for suppression (40\%)
   was found for the treatment with SC of foliage of both woody species. It
   was concluded that addition of foliage of L. leucocephala and G.
   ulmifolia as SC reduces weed biomass, increasing potential for weed

Abstract = {A greenhouse experiment was undertaken to evaluate the influence of
   prestorage drying treatments and duration of storage on the
   effectiveness of root inoculum of Glomus aggregatum. Conditions under
   which roots were dried prior to storage had little or no effect on the
   level of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) effectiveness measured in terms of
   pinnule phosphorus (P) content of Leucaena leucocephala leaves after the
   first 14 days of storage. As duration of storage was further prolonged
   the time required by root inocula for initiating AM effectiveness and
   attaining peak levels of effectiveness was progressively prolonged
   relative to that required by the crude inoculum. However, the two
   sources of inoculum had similar peak AM effectiveness in many instances.
   Roots dried in the greenhouse or in the oven at 40 degrees C were
   significantly inferior to that dried at 60 degrees C. Root inocula
   stimulated growth of the indicator plant to the same extent as the crude
   inoculum after 14 days of storage. However, the effectiveness of root
   inocula in stimulating growth declined with further increase in duration
   of storage. Among root inocula tested, that dried at 60 degrees C prior
   to storage was relatively more effective than that dried in the
   greenhouse or in the oven at 40 degrees C. The overall inferiority of
   root inocula to that of the crude inoculum appears to be related to loss
   of viability of root inocula with increase in duration of storage.},

Abstract = {A simple and sensitive indirect spectrophotometric method is described
   for the determination of mimosine based on its reaction with diazotized
   sulfanilamide (DZSAM). DZSAM couples with N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine
   (NEDA) forming a pink colored azodye, absorbing maximally at 540 nm
   (epsilon(max) = 27 mM(-1) cm(-1)). In the present method, mimosine was
   first reacted with known excess of DZSAM and the unreacted DZSAM was
   determined by coupling with NEDA. The reaction of mimosine with DZSAM
   proceeded optimally at neutral pH. The decrease in absorbance of the
   DZSAM-NEDA-coupled product obeyed Beer's law in the concentration range
   of 0.005-0.15 mug ml(-1) of mimosine. The present method was applied to
   estimate mimosine in plant extracts containing lesser than 0.05 mug
   ml(-1) with recovery at 99 +/- 0.41\%. The method described is superior
   to other reported methods in terms of ease of adaptability and

Abstract = {In sheep silvopastoral systems, forage legumes are promising
   alternatives to commercial feed since they can lower costs. An
   evaluation was done comparing productive and ingestive behavior
   parameters in hair sheep in silvopastoral and stabled systems for four
   months. Nine variables were evaluated: dry matter intake (DMI); organic
   matter intake (OMI); crude protein intake (CPI); neutral detergent fiber
   intake (NDFI); daily weight gain (DWG); feeding time (FT); rumination
   (RT); walking (WT); and other activities time (OAT). Experimental
   animals were eighteen sheep (initial weight= 16.83 x 2.57 kg)
   distributed in a completely random design, with three treatments: a
   silvopastoral system (SPS) including the legume Leucaena leucocephala
   and the grass Cynodon plectostachyus (L+E); another SPS including L.
   leucocephala and the grass Panicum maximum (L+M); and a stabled
   weight-gain system (SWS). Orthogonal contrasts were applied to compare
   the SWS vs SPSs and the two SPSs. Compared to the two SPSs, all intakes
   (DMI= 1246.2 g; OMI= 1073.0 g; CPI= 157.1 g; and NDFI= 364.0 g animal
   d(-1)) and DWG (195 g animal d(-1)) were higher (P<0.001) in the SWS.
   Daily weight gain did not differ between the SPSs (102 and 114 g animal
   d-1), but all intakes were higher (P<0.001) in L+M (DMI= 772.2 g; OMI=
   662.7 g; CPI= 124.0 g; and NDFI= 334.2 g animal d-1) than in L+E (DMI=
   548.9 g; OMI= 86.20 g; CPI= 483.0 g; NDFI= 252.3 g animal d(-1)).
   Feeding time (FT) was shortest (P<0.001) in the SWS (148.33 min).
   Between the SPSs, FT was shortest (P<0.05) in the L+E (318.3 min) than
   in the L+M (344.6 min). Time dedicated to other activities was longer
   (P<0.001) in the SWS (247.9 min) than in the SPSs. Silvopastoral systems
   combining legumes and grasses provided sufficient growth in hair sheep
   although the stabled weight gain system produced faster growth in the
   studied time period.},

   CO(2)fluxes were 17.6\%-34.8\% higher in the morning compared with
   afternoon measurements. Soil moisture and temperature were higher in L +
   C, but the ambient temperature and relative humidity showed no
   statistical differences between systems. In both systems, soil
   temperature was greater in the afternoon, while the soil moisture and
   relative humidity were greater in the morning. The diurnal variation of
   soil CO(2)fluxes in silvopastoral systems correlated positively with
   soil temperature and ambient temperature, but negatively with relative
   humidity. We concluded that soil CO(2)fluxes did not vary between
   silvopastoral systems but respond differently to the seasons. The
   results have important implications on the establishment and management
   ofLeucaena-based silvopastoral systems for the mitigation of soil
   CO(2)fluxes from extensive livestock production lands.},

Abstract = {Natural abundance of N-15 (delta N-15) of leaves harvested from tropical
   plants in Brazil and Thailand was analyzed. The delta N-15 values of
   non-N 2-fixing trees in Brazil were +4.5 +/- 1.9 parts per thousand,
   which is lower than those of soil nitrogen (+8.0 +/- 2.2 parts per
   thousand). In contrast, mimosa and kudzu had very low delta N-15 values
   (-1.4 approximately +0.5 parts per thousand). The delta N-15 values of
   Panicum maximum and leguminous trees, except Leucaena leucocephala, were
   similar to those of non-N2 -fixing trees, suggesting that, the
   contribution of fixed N in these plants is negligible. The delta N-15
   values of non-N2-fixing trees in Thailand were +4.9 +/- 2.0 parts per
   thousand. Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania grandiflora, Casuarina spp.
   and Cycas spp. had low delta N-15 values, close to the value of
   atmospheric N2 (0 parts per thousand), pointing to a major contribution
   of N2 fixation in these plants. Cassia spp. and Tamarindus indica had
   high delta N-15 values, which confirms that these species are
   non-nodulating legumes. The delta N-15 values of Acacia spp. and
   Gliricidia sepium and other potentially nodulating tree legumes were, on
   average, slightly lower than those of non-N2-fixing trees, indicating a
   small contribution of N2 fixation in these legumes.},

Abstract = {Increasing concern regarding mining area environmental contamination
   with heavy metals has resulted in an emphasis of current research on
   phytoremediation. The aim of the present study was to assess the
   efficiency of symbiotic Cupriavidus necator strains on different
   leguminous plants in soil contaminated with heavy metals following the
   application of inorganic materials. The application of limestone and
   calcium silicate induced a significant increase in soil pH, with
   reductions in zinc and cadmium availability of 99 and 94 \%,
   respectively. In addition, improved nodulation of Mimosa
   caesalpiniaefolia, Leucaena leucocephala and Mimosa pudica in soil with
   different levels of contamination was observed. Significant increases in
   the nitrogen content of the aerial parts of the plant were observed upon
   nodulation of the root system of Leucaena leucocephala and Mimosa pudica
   by strain UFLA01-659 (36 and 40 g kg(-1)) and by strain UFLA02-71 in
   Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia (39 g kg(-1)). The alleviating effect of
   calcium silicate resulted in higher production of dry matter from the
   aerial part of the plant, an increase in nodule number and an increase
   in the nitrogen fixation rate. The results of the present study
   demonstrate that the combination of rhizobia, leguminous plants and
   calcium silicate may represent a key factor in the remediation of areas
   contaminated by heavy metals.},

Abstract = {Fodder shrubs are important dry season feed sources for livestock in
   semi-arid environments. It has been proposed that a mixture of
   leguminous with non-leguminous shrubs may increase rates of N cycling
   and improve biomass and fodder quality. The objective of the present
   study was to assess the biomass productivity and fodder quality of
   leguminous shrubs growing a mixture with non-leguminous shrubs. Three
   shrub species-the legume Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) and the
   non-legumes Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) and Moringa oleifera (Lam.)-were
   grown as legume/non-legume mixtures and as monocultures. Total fodder
   production and quality were estimated over five harvests at three-month
   intervals. The Leucaena-Guazuma mixture had the largest fodder
   production (9045 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), followed by the Leucaena monocrop
   (7750 kg ha(-1) year(-1)). Total nitrogen accumulation in the foliage
   was also high in the Leucaena-Guazuma mixture, reaching 282 kg ha(-1)
   year(-1); the Leucaena monocrop accumulated 244 kg N, while the Moringa
   monocrop took up only 46 kg N ha(-1). The concentration of polyphenols
   was high in Leucaena and Guazuma, while Moringa had the lowest value.
   The high survival and excellent growth rates, as well as the high
   foliage production observed in Leucaena and Guazuma, suggest that they
   have the potential to provide high-quality fodder for livestock.},

Abstract = {According to the categorization of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF,
   for its acronym in English), xeromorphic scrublands are terrestrial
   ecoregions of importance for conservation. In order to characterize the
   floristic composition and structure of a coastal and subcoastal

   Rosal{''} site located in the semi-arid zone of the Guantanamo province.
   Twenty sampling plots with an area of 20 x 25 m were established; the
   diameter (1.30) and height of all individuals e{''} 5 cm were recorded,
   the sampling was validated with the area-species curve. With the values
   obtained, the Shannon, equity and Simpson diversity indices and beta
   diversity were calculated through an analysis of hierarchical clusters,
   by means of the Sorensen distance measure, the horizontal structure and
   the vertical structure through the description of the strata. of the
   vegetation. A total of 15 species belonging to 10 genera and 11 families
   were recorded, where the species of greatest ecological importance were
   Guaiacum officinale L. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. In the
   cluster analysis, three clusters were distinguished with 63 \%
   similarity. Low floristic diversity was demonstrated and the vegetation
   reached up to 5 m in dominant height and the species with the highest
   sociological position were Guaiacum officinale, Leucaena leucocephala
   and Azadirachta indica.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {117},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The intake of temperate forages by herbivores can be determined using
   the C33 alkane naturally present in the forage and dosed C32 alkane.  To
   determine whether the technique can be used with tropical forages, the
   concentrations of C33 alkane were determined in seven species.
   The leaves of Brachiaria decumbens, Digitaria decumbens, Pennisetum
   glaucum and Stylosanthes scabra contained sufficient C33 alkane (> 50
   mg/kg DM) for the estimation of dry matter intake.  Low concentrations
   of C33 alkane were found in the leaves of Setaria sphacelata, Sorghum
   sp. and Leucaena leucocephala.  Setaria sphacelata was found to contain
   high concentrations of C27 alkane and therefore intake could be
   estimated by using C28 as the dosed alkane although the intake would
   possibly then be underestimated by c. 8\%.  Leaves of Sorghum sp.
   contained > 50 mg C31 alkane/kg DM and, with C32 as the dosed alkane,
   intake would possibly be underestimated by c. 5\%.  Leucaena
   leucocephala contained insufficient alkanes to estimate forage intake. 
   The concentration of n-alkanes in Pennisetum glaucum and Sorghum sp.
   leaves decreased with age.
   It was concluded that some tropical forages contain insufficient C33
   alkane for the measurement of intake by the double alkane technique.  In
   these species, a shorter chain length alkane can sometimes be used, but
   only with a reduction in accuracy in estimating intake.},

Abstract = {Background: Supplementation of grazing cattle with native and
   naturalized forages using silvopastoral systems has been suggested as an
   affordable strategy to reduce methane production and improve nutrition,
   diminishing the environmental impact of cattle production. Objective: To
   evaluate the effect of three tropical forage species in a silvopastoral
   arrangement on methane production and fermentation parameters using an
   in vitro ruminal simulation system (RUSITEC). Methods: Four diets were
   evaluated. The control treatment was a basal diet of colosuana grass
   (COL; Bothriochloa pertusa), while the other diets consisted of 70\% COL
   complemented with 30\% shrub forage from either Leucaena leucocephala
   (CL), Guazuma ulmifolia (CG), or Crescentia cujete (CT). A randomized
   complete block design with repeated measurements over time was used.
   Results: The inclusion of shrub forage did not affect pH, organic matter
   degradation (OMD) or volatile fatty acids (VFA). The inclusion of shrub
   forage affected the degradation of structural components. The
   concentration of N-NH3 increased in the CL diet compared to COL
   (p<0.05). In general, methane production in terms of mL/day, mL/g DMi,
   mL/g DMd, and mL/gOMd was reduced for CL compared to COL (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: Based on these results, inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala,
   Guazuma ulmifolia or Crescentia cujete on B. pertusa-based diets
   improves ruminal fermentation parameters and reduces in vitro methane
   production.},

Abstract = {In this study, seed predation rates imposed by bruchines and the
   composition of bruchine species and their host plants were assessed in a
   heterogeneous landscape in southeastern Brazil. Fruits were collected
   from 49 plants from 16 species belonging to four families, primarily
   Fabaceae. The five bruchine species collected emerged from four plant
   species as follows: Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) from
   Leucaena leucocephala (Lamarck) de Wit, Acanthoscelides sp. from Senna
   hirsuta (L.) Irwin and Barneby, Ctenocolum podagricus (F.) from
   Lonchocarpus muehlbergianus Hassler, and Gibbobruchus polycoccus
   (Fahraeus) and Gibbobruchus speculifer (Gyllenhal) from Bauhinia
   forficata Link. Bauhinia forficata is here recorded for the first time
   as a host for G. polycoccus. Only 1/4 of the local flora that was
   surveyed hosted bruchines. Bruchine and plant species composition varied
   among habitats, with most beetles found in plants located in the most
   disturbed habitat. Because of the economic importance of L. leucocephala
   in the tropics, we compared germination percentages between attacked and
   unattacked seeds of this species. The unattacked seeds had an average
   germination rate of 59\%, and none of the attacked seeds germinated,
   showing that the germination of L. leucocephala seeds was drastically
   affected by predation.},

   (treeless plots) was established. In each plot, spore extraction and AMF
   identification were carried out. Tree root samples from each treatment
   were collected and assessed for mycorrhizal infection and root water
   content. The results indicated that the trees under study associated
   with five genera of AMF. These were Acaulaspora, Glomus, Gigaspora,
   Scuttelospora and Entrophospora, of which the latter two were not
   numerous. When compared to other tree species and with treeless plots,
   plots with Melia volkensii had a significantly higher number of AMF

   Roots were exposed at the time of planting, 6 months, 16 months, and 28
   months after planting. Total root weight and root volume were highest in
   Eucalyptus tereticornis and lowest in Bauhinia purpurea. Major part of
   the root system confined within 90-120 cm soil depth in case of Bauhinia
   purpurea, Grewia optiva and Leucaena leucocephala but Eucalyptus
   tereticornis and Ougeinia oojeinensis strike their roots to deeper
   depths. Bauhinia purpurea had its roots evenly distributed down to 120
   cm. In general, the vertical distribution of fine roots (< 2 mm in
   diameter) of the five species indicate that more the depth, fewer the
   number of roots. The observations on soil binding capacity, indicated
   that Ougeinia oojeinensis had the maximum and Eucalyptus tereticornis
   had the minimum binding value. Due to leaf shading and other litter fall
   significant increase of nutrient components in soils under the tree
   canopies has been observed. The study indicates that bulk of the roots
   of the five tree species are found near the surface, but observation on
   soil moisture and nutrient content does not indicate variation under the
   tree canopies and in open, hence there may not be root competition  in
   initial years of plantation.},

Abstract = {There are great concerns about degradation of agricultural soils. It has
   been suggested that cultivating different plant species intercropped
   with coffee plants can increase microbial diversity and enhance soil
   sustainability. The objective of this study was to evaluate enzyme
   activity (urease, arylsulfatase and phosphatase) and alterations in C
   and N mineralization rates as related to different legume cover crops
   planted between rows of coffee plants. Soil samples were collected in a
   field experiment conducted for 10 years in a sandy soil in the North of
   Parana State, Brazil. Samples were collected from the 0-10 cm layer,
   both from under the tree canopy and in-between rows in the following
   treatments: control, Leucaena leucocephala, Crotalaria spectabilis,
   Crotalaria breviflora, Mucuna pruriens, Mucuna deeringiana, Arachis
   hypogaea and Vigna unguiculata. The soil was sampled in four stages of
   legume cover crops: pre-planting (September), after planting (November),
   flowering stage (February) and after plant residue incorporation
   (April), from 1997 to 1999. The green manure species influenced soil
   enzyme activity (urease, arylsulfatase and phosphatase) and C and N
   mineralization rates, both under the tree canopy and in-between rows.
   Cultivation of Leucaena leucocephala increased acid phosphatase and
   arilsulfatase activity and C and N mineralization both under the tree
   canopy and in-between rows. Intercropped L. leucocephala increased
   urease activity under the tree canopy while C. breviflora increased
   urease activity in-between rows.},

Abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the fermentative profile, fermentative
   losses, microbial populations, aerobic stability, chemical composition,
   and in situ degradability of total mixed ration silages based on forage
   cactus associated with xerophytic legumes. The treatments consisted of
   four total mixed ration silages based on forage cactus and concentrate
   (TMRC), associated with legumes such as Gliricidia sepium (TMRG),
   Leucaena (TMRL), and Senna obtusifolia (TMRS). There was a significant
   difference (p < 0.05) among the evaluated treatments for the pH and
   NH3-N (\% of total N) variables. The pH values remained within the ideal
   range, from 4.2 to 4.4, and the NH3-N content ranged from 2.21 to
   0.85\%. The dry matter recovery for the evaluated treatments averaged
   89\%. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts ranged from 5.0 to 6.3 log
   CFU/g among the evaluated silages, with TMRC presenting the lowest count
   at 5 log CFU/g in comparison with the total mixed ration silages
   associated with legume plants. All of the total mixed ration silages
   associated with legumes presented an average mold count of 3.3 log
   CFU/g. Yeast populations were observed only for TMRG at 5 log CFU/g. A
   higher aerobic stability was observed for TMRC, followed by TMRG and
   then TMRS. In conclusion, the total mixed ration silages associated with
   G. sepium and S. obtusifolia can be recommended based on their
   fermentation and nutritional value.},

Abstract = {Our observations on the growth stimulatory nature of mimosine,
   (beta-(3-hydroxy-4-pyridon-1-yl)-L-alanine), the toxic non-protein plant
   amino acid, in some model experimental systems, warranted sensitive and
   selective routine estimations. For the determination of both mimosine
   and DHP, an indirect spectrophotometric method was developed based on
   their individual reaction with known excess of DZSAM and by estimating
   the remaining DZSAM with N-(1-naphthyl)ethylene-diamine (NEDA). The
   resultant decrease in the secondary coupled product was measured at 540
   nm. On equimolar basis, DHP had 40\% of the reactivity of mimosine while
   interference from other relevant compounds was 15-35\%. The
   determination of mimosine and DHP in tissue samples under different
   physiological conditions was effected after paper chromatographic
   separation of mimosine and DHP with distinctly differing R-f, from other
   compounds. The indirect method is superior in terms of absolute
   selectivity, sensitivity and ease of applicability with linear decreases
   in absorbance, proportional to increasing concentrations of mimosine
   from 0.1 to 0.75 mu M or DHP from 0.2 to 1.5 mu M and with recoveries of

   Total tocochromanol content ranged 41.7-326.0 mg 100 g(-1) oil.
   Tocopherols (Ts), especially alpha-T (23.0-197.8 mg 100 g(-1) oil) and
   gamma-T (7.3-264.0 mg 100 g(-1) oil), dominated, and the seeds either
   did not contain tocotrienols or the content was negligible. Total
   carotenoid content ranged 2.1-11.8 mg 100 g(-1) oil. Only C. pulcherrima

   mg 100 g(-1) oil, and the seeds contained mostly beta-sitosterol, Delta
   5-stigmasterol, campesterol and cycloartenol. Although the oil yield is

Abstract = {There are rumen bacteria capable of degrading toxic dihydroxypyridine
   compounds derived from mimosine, a non-protein amino acid found in the
   toxic legume Leucaena leucocephala. Activity of degradation of the
   metabolite 2,3-dihydroxypyridine (2,3-DHP) can be temporarily or
   permanently lost. In this study we have determined the extension of
   bacterial growth and degradation of 2,3-DHP under different conditions.
   Degradation of 2,3-DHP started once cultures reached late exponential
   phase, and complete degradation was achieved in 3 days. If additional
   2,3-DHP was added to the cultures, complete degradation occurred within
   the following 12 h. Degradation of the 2,3-DHP occurred in medium
   (saline) containing either pyruvate, rumen fluid or arginine but not in
   saline supplemented with volatile fatty acids or vitamins. Strict
   anaerobic conditions allowed optimal culture growth and degradation of
   2,3-DHP. Maintenance of cultures in medium lacking 2,3-DHP for 2 months
   caused loss of ability to degrade the compound. When cultured again in
   medium containing 2,3-DHP, cultures grew normally but only regained
   activity after a time lag of 4 weeks. Plasmids that could carry
   fundamental activities in the degradation process were not detected. The
   results of this work are relevant to the conditions of in vitro
   screening for 2,3-DHP degradation activity in rumen contents and
   manipulation of 2,3-DHP degrading cultures in the laboratory.},

Abstract = {The potential values and application of soil bioengineering techniques
   are crucial for the slope protection and ecological restoration.
   Knowledge related to the biological and engineering properties of plants
   is essential for the implementation of soil bioengineering techniques.
   Thus, four tropical species namely Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia
   mangium, Dillenia suffruticosa and Melastoma malabathricum were
   evaluated in terms of root profiles and root engineering properties.
   Leucaena leucocephala showed the highest root tensile strength followed
   by A. mangium, D. suffruticosa and M. malabathricum. Pull-out resistance
   was mostly affected by the root than the shoot profiles. Leaf area index
   (LAI) and root biomass were strongly correlated (R2 = 0.79), implying
   that the root biomass would be higher if the plant canopy was higher.
   Tree species, L. leucocephala and A. mangium, had deep rooting system
   and recommended for slope protection. Shrub species, M. malabathricum
   and D. suffruticosa had shallow root system and suggested for
   controlling soil erosion. Based on the overall engineering properties,
   L. leucocephala showed excellent performance through its root profiles
   and can be a potential plant for soil reinforcement. In conclusion,
   plant pull-out resistance, root tensile strength and type of roots can
   be used as important tools to identify plant performance for soil
   reinforcement. The results can be an aid to select potential slope
   plants for implementing soil bioengineering and slope protection
   techniques successfully.},

Abstract = {Sixteen West African Dwarf Goats (WADG) were used to study the feeding
   behaviour and diet selection. The animals were offered freshly cut stems
   with leaves and fruiting bodies of Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena
   leucocephala and Panicum maximum. The feeding behaviour of the goats was
   observed and recorded whilst the preference of the animals for each diet
   was also monitored. Data were collected on feed intake, number of bites
   per minutes, and preference for each of the forages. The data on feed
   intake were subjected to one-way analysis of variance. Within 30 minutes
   into the feeding period, it was observed that the goats concentrated on
   Leucaena leucocephala which they struggled over for favoured positions
   leading to horn locking. The animals first smelt the different plants
   took a bite before concentrating on a particular forage. The animals
   usually consumed fruiting bodies and leaves of leucaena before eating
   the other two forages. The mean number of bites per goat per minute was
   10, 8 and 6 for gliricidia, leucaena and panicum respectively. The
   animals exhibited bi-pedal stance during feeding.
   Analysis of variance showed forage intake to be significantly different
   (P< 0.05) among the forages. Proximate analysis of the three forages
   indicated that leucaena had a higher quantity of dry matter (DM), crude
   protein (CP) and ether extract. (EE) compared to the other two forages,
   while panicum had higher CF, lower CP, ash and EE content compared to
   gliricidia and leucaena.},

Abstract = {Condensed tannins (CTs) are plant anti-herbivore compounds with
   antimicrobial activity that can be used in ruminant diets as ruminal
   microbiome manipulators. However, not all CTs from fodder legumes are
   bioactive due to their wide structural diversity. The aim of our study
   was to investigate the effect of 10 CT-containing plants(Flemingia
   macrophylla,Leucaena leucocephala,Stylosanthes guianensis,Gliricidia
   sepium,Cratylia argentea,Cajanus cajan,Desmodium ovalifolium,Macrotiloma
   axilare, D. paniculatum, andLespedeza procumbens) on in vitro
   fermentation kinetics of Nelore beef cattle. Polyethylene glycol (PEG),
   a specific CT-binding agent, was added to neutralize condensed tannin.
   Tifton and alfalfa hay were used as controls lacking CT. The
   experimental layout included a randomized complete block with factorial
   design and four blocks. The data were subjected to analysis of variance
   followed by Duncan's test to determine differences (p < 0.05) among
   treatment means. The addition of PEG in browse incubations resulted in
   increased gas production, fermentation rate, short-chain fatty acid
   (SCFA) and N-NH(3)release. Within our study,Lespedeza
   procumbens,Desmodium paniculatum,Leucaena leucocephala,Desmodium
   ovalifolium, andFlemingia macrophyllashowed superior bioactivity
   compared to other species evaluated, suggesting a natural alternative
   for replacing ionophores to modify ruminal fermentation. Condensed
   tannins fromL. pocumbens,D. paniculatum,L. leucocephala,D. ovalifolium,

Abstract = {In order to determine how dependent a woody legume can be upon potential
   N sources, the time course of N-2 fixation and N absorption was studied
   on Gliricidia sepium cv. ILG50, Leucaena leucocephala cv. K28, and
   Albizia lebbeck in a screenhouse for 16 months using Senna siamea as a
   reference tree. Dry matter and N yield in all four species increased
   steadily with time. The numbers and dry weight of nodules also increased
   with tree age. N-difference and N-15 dilution methods correlated well (r
   = 0.87-0.93) in defining an increasing pattern of N-2 fixation with time
   in ail species, with the highest increment rate between sowing and 8
   months. The percent N-2 fixed ranged from 17.9 to 74\%, 27.7 to 71.9\%
   and 43.6 to 83.6\%, equivalent to 191 to 3385 mg, 321 to 2863 mg and 533
   to 6419 mg N in Leucaena, Gliricidia and Albizia, respectively, for the
   period between 4 and 16 months. In contrast to others, G. sepium had its
   peak of amount of N-2 fixed at 12 months after planting. In both the
   proportion and amount of N-2 fixed over time, A. lebbeck was superior to
   L. leucocephala and G. sepium which were similar. The proportion of
   plant N derived from absorption (soil+fertilizer) over time decreased
   inversely to the increase in symbiotic N-2 fixation, with soil being the
   predominant source. This study evidenced the benefit of relying on
   N-2-fixing woody legumes as sustainable N-supplying sources to soil-crop
   systems.},

   symbiosis with legumes so that legumes crop yields increase. The
   research begins with sampling of soil and root nodule of forage legumes
   along the Northern Coast of Central Java including Tegal, Pekalongan,
   Semarang, Demak, Pati. Soil samples were analysed for salinity, Total
   Dissolved Solids, and pH. Rhizobium bacteria were isolated from the
   acquired root nodule, then identified by biochemical test to ensure that
   the isolates obtained were Rhizobium bacteria. The results showed that
   the five districts/municipal sites sampled by the soil have very low
   salinity to very high levels. The highest level of soil salinity was
   found in Demak (Sayung) which has an electrical conductivity value (EC)
   of 17.77 mmhos/cm. The EC values of legumes overgrown soils showed a low
   salinity level while bare soils have high salinity levels. Feed crops
   legumes that could be found in the northern coast of Central Java were
   Centrosema pubescens, Calopogonium mucunoides, Leucaena leucocephala,

Title = {Erosion Potential Estimation by Network Measurement of Soil Properties

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2015},
Abstract = {Invasive white leadtrees (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) are
   contributing to the destruction of coastal ecosystems and biodiversity
   in humid subtropical and tropical regions. Sudden clearcutting of
   invasive tress can lead to substantial soil loss, which subsequently
   reduces the efficiency when indigenous vegetation is restored. Soil
   samples (n = 142) were collected using the grid method to measure soil
   properties and to spatially analyze the soil erosion potential in the
   studied area after clearcutting of the invasive trees. Results indicated
   that the soil erosion rates ranged from 21 to 249 tons ha(-1) yr(-1),
   and the eroded soil depths ranged from 0.30 to 3.40 cm yr(-1) after
   clearcutting. The network measurements for determining the mortality
   ratio of the restored indigenous vegetation demonstrated that Ficus
   benjamina L., Macaranga tanarius, and Scaevola taccada (Gaertner) Roxb
   were likely to be susceptible to damage from the substantial amount of
   soil loss and low SOC content. During the period between clearcutting
   and establishing the next stand of plants for reforestation, the network
   measurements for determining the soil properties and estimating the
   spatial heterogeneity of soil erosion potential are regarded as a major
   issue of concern regarding the efficiency of subsequent restoration
   efforts.},

Abstract = {The Leucaena genus is made up of 24 different species (19 diploid and 5
   tetraploid species). However, early use of the Leucaena genus in
   agricultural systems was based entirely upon a very narrow germplasm
   base. A single genotype of Leucaena leucocephala ssp. leucocephala
   ('common' leucaena) was spread pantropically from its center of origin
   in Mexico over 400 years ago. Genetic improvement of Leucaena
   leucocephala began in the 1950s, when vigorous `giant' leucaena (L.
   leucocephala ssp. glabrata) was identified in Australia and Hawaii.
   Cultivars such as Hawaiian Giant K8, Peru and El Salvador were selected
   and promoted for grazing in Australia and multipurpose agroforestry uses
   throughout the tropics. Plant breeding for improved forage production
   resulted in the release of cv. Cunningham in 1976 in Australia. These
   cultivars of `giant' Leucaena leucocephala displayed broad environmental
   adaptability, with the exception of poor tolerance of cold temperatures
   (and frost) and acid soils. The outbreak of the psyllid insect pest
   (Heteropsylla cubana) from Cuba during the 1980s devastated both
   `common' and `giant' leucaena all around the world. This challenge
   resulted in renewed interest in lesser-known Leucaena spp. that
   exhibited tolerance to the pest and in interspecific hybridization as a
   means of developing new cultivars. Some `giant' leucaena lines exhibited
   excellent agronomic traits and a degree of tolerance to the psyllid pest
   and this resulted in the release of new cultivars in Australia (cvv.
   Tarramba and Wondergraze) and Hawaii (cv. LxL). Since the 1990s, plant
   breeding programs have sought to develop cultivars with greater psyllid
   tolerance using interspecific hybridization. This has resulted in the
   release of cv. `KX2-Hawaii' for timber and forage production, and a
   backcrossed forage cultivar cv. Redlands (Australia). Both cultivars are
   based upon interspecific hybridization between L. pallida and L.
   leucocephala ssp. glabrata. Cold-temperature and acid-soil tolerance
   have been pursued in South American breeding programs based upon L.
   diversifolia, without commercial success. The development of sterile
   Leucaena spp. cultivars is currently underway to nullify the
   environmental weed potential of all current commercial cultivars.
   Tolerance to cold temperatures (L. diversifolia, L. pallida, L.
   pulverulenta and L. trichandra), frost (L. greggii and L. retusa) and
   psyllids (L. collinsii) exists within the Leucaena genus and may be
   exploited in future hybridization programs. New genetic analyses and
   molecular plant breeding techniques have the potential to facilitate
   further gene transfer between Leucaena spp. for the development of the
   next generation of multipurpose cultivars.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Invasive species are among the major threats to global biodiversity.
   Plant invasions are often driven by great propagule pressure that
   overcomes barriers to early colonisation and establishment, such as the
   biotic resistance from pathogens and seed predators. However, the way in
   which biotic resistance interacts with propagule pressure and affects
   seed survival remains poorly understood. Here, we experimentally
   assessed the effect of seed abundance on seed removal in the Brazilian
   Cerrado (savanna). We tested whether the invasiveLeucaena
   leucocephalaand the nativeAnadenanthera macrocarpa(both Fabaceae) differ
   in post-dispersal seed removal - an indicator of granivore pressure - by
   different guilds of seed predators, varying seed abundance (2, 5 or 10
   seeds of each species per treatment) and distance from a disturbance (5,
   20 and 50 m from a firebreak) in two fragments of Cerrado. Treatment
   encounter, that is the chance of at least one seed being removed,
   increased 72\% from 2 to 10 seeds per treatment, but seed removal
   increased only by 32\%, suggesting a threshold in granivore response to
   seed availability. Native seeds suffered higher removal than exotic
   seeds, but removal rates did not vary with distance to disturbance or
   interact with vertebrate and invertebrate exclusions. Our results
   suggest a patchy pattern of seed predation influenced by resource
   abundance and emphasise the efficiency of high propagule pressure in
   overcoming the density-dependent biotic resistance during early stages
   of exotic plant invasions in Cerrado. Seeds of fast-germinating species,
   such asL. leucocephala, that reach appropriate spots for regeneration
   may still overcome the biotic resistance due to the patchy nature of
   seed predation. in Portuguese is available with online material.},

Abstract = {From 1986-92 alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and

   fertilisation with 90, 39 and 75 kg ha(-1) N, P and K vs. no
   fertilisation were studied in maize and cassava grown intercropped or in
   rotation. Light transmission measurements and row position effects on
   food crop yield did not indicate any decisive shading effect in
   tree-crop competition when trees were pruned 2-3 times a year. In the
   last three years, with NPK in solecropping the crop growth rates (CGR)
   of maize reached a peak of 100 g m(-2) wk(-1) around 70 days after
   planting (DAP). CGR in unfertilised Cajanus alleys was as high as in
   corresponding fertilised treatments but delayed by one month. For
   cassava, the highest growth rates of 60-130 g m(-2) wk(-1) lasted from
   60 to 190 DAP with NPK in solecropping. The harvest index (HI) of
   cassava reached 40-55\% in all intercropping and unfertilised
   solecropping treatments. The HI in solecropping was reduced by
   fertilisation to 30-40\% due to excessive leaf growth at 60-190 DAP. The
   increase in number of thickened roots starting at 30 DAP in solecropping
   was delayed by one month in intercropping. The reason for significantly
   higher cassava root yields in Cajanus alleys as compared to no trees in
   the fertilised solecrop was attributed to the enhanced root formation at
   85 DAP due to a slower release of nutrients subject to leaching such as
   N and K from tree prunings than from mineral fertiliser.},

   (POST) the femoral vein infusion of mimosine (12.5 mg kg(-1) BW-0.75

   circulating mimosine (4.88 mu m l(-1) during POST) directly, via
   chelation or competition for absorption, or, indirectly, by
   gastrointestinal lesions resulting from circulating mimosine. Pivotal to

Abstract = {The in situ effective rumen degradability of dry matter (DM) and total
   nitrogen (Nt) of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), gliricidia
   (Gliricidia sepium) and star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) was determined
   in three cows fitted with cannula in rumen. They were subject to a
   grazing system of grasses (Cynodon nlemfuensis) and legumes in the form
   of protein banks (Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium), in a
   ratio 50:50. The values of effective rumen degradability varied between
   41.53-51.70\%, 37.92-47.66\% and 36.97-47.41\%, in each of the feeds,
   respectively, using different constants of rumen turnover. However,
   values of effective rumen degradability of Nt up to 60.56\% were found
   in gliricidia, followed by leucaena (49.60) and star grass (46.91), with
   levels of degradable nitrogen that decreased with the constant increase
   of rumen turnover. It was found that the legumes studied had higher DM
   and Nt degradability than star grass and a high nutritional potential.
   The high protein concentration and its dynamics of degradation in rumen
   suggest that the inclusion in low-quality diets may improve the
   efficiency of utilization and keep adequate production levels. The
   evaluation of the use of these legume species should be continued for
   ruminant supplementation, combined with tropical grasses. Thus, the
   potential of the legumes may be used to provide peptides and amino acids
   to the rumen microorganisms and bypassing nutrients. Besides, an optimum
   use of the lignocellulosic compound may be made as energy source for the

Abstract = {Street trees are always considered a vital part of urban green
   infrastructure in urbanized areas through mitigating the negative
   effects caused by urbanization taking part in human well-being. However,
   little is still known about their diversity, structure and protection,
   mostly in Lubumbashi city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR
   Congo), where the pace of urbanization is not only rapid but also
   unplanned. In this study, using an inventory, we have characterized the
   diversity, structure and protection measures of street trees along a
   land-use planning gradient in Lubumbashi for both planned and unplanned
   neighborhoods. From the results, a total of 1596 trees were encountered,
   comprising 40 species, 33 genera and 17 families, mostly dominated by
   exotic species (65\%). In addition, most of the studied trees (63\%)
   belonged to four species only (Jacaranda mimosifolia, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Mangifera indica, and Acacia auriculiformis) with Leucaena
   leucocephala and Jacaranda mimosifolia being highly represented in
   unplanned and planned neighborhoods, respectively. The most abundant
   diameter classes in the planned neighborhoods were those with at most 10
   cm against the classes larger than 50 cm in the planned neighborhoods.
   In both neighborhoods, trees with protection equipment represent less
   than 35\%. Furthermore, in planned neighborhoods notably, nearly half of
   the observed equipment is in a good condition. Despite the benefits
   associated with street trees, there is a need to reduce the proportion
   of exotic tree species by planting native utilitarian tree species.},

Abstract = {Around 76\% of the 10,452 villages of Cambodia will still be without
   electricity in the year 2010. We examined the potential of biomass
   gasification fuelled by alternative resources of agricultural residues
   and woody biomass to increase rural power supply, using geographic and
   social economic databases provided by the Royal Government of Cambodia.
   About 77\% of villages currently without electricity have sufficient
   land available for tree planting for electricity generation based on a
   requirement of 0.02 ha per household. Among 8008 villages with
   sufficient land, we assumed that those villages that had greater than
   10\% of households owning a television (powered by a battery or a
   generator) would have both a high electricity demand and a capacity to
   pay for electricity generation. Those 6418 villages were considered
   appropriate candidates for mini-grid installation by biomass
   gasification. This study demonstrated that while agricultural residues
   such as rice husks or cashew nut shells may have high energy potential,
   only tree farming or plantations would provide sufficient sustainable
   resources to supply a biomass gasification system. Cost per unit
   electricity generation by biomass gasification is less than diesel
   generation when the plant capacity factor exceeds 13\%. In order to
   ensure long-term ecological sustainability as well as appropriate
   tree-farming technology for farmers, there is an urgent need for studies
   aimed at quantifying biomass production across multiple rotations and
   with different species across Cambodia. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

   seed were selected. Characterizations such as thermogravimetric
   analysis, proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, calorific value, bulk
   density, and functional groups via Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopic analysis were performed. The proximate analysis confirmed
   the minimum level of moisture content (4.98 to 6.75\%) and significant
   volatile matter content (53.75 to 72.48\%) in these feedstocks.
   Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the maximum devolatilization takes
   place in the temperature range of 200 to 500 \& DEG;C. The maximum value
   of solid residue was found in Leucaena leucocephala (31.76 wt \%) and
   the minimum was found in Senna auriculata seeds (8.83 wt \%). The
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the
   highest peaks were in the range of 3200 to 3323 cm(-1), as related to
   the existence of O-H stretching of carboxylic acid, alcohol, and amine
   groups. The calorific value of these non-edible biomass materials was in
   the range of 17.19 to 23.28 MJ/kg. The physio-chemical analysis results
   confirmed that these feedstocks are more suitable for the thermochemical
   conversion processes. Also, the processing of this non-edible biomass is
   more appropriate for future energy development and improves employment
   opportunities in rural and forest areas.},

Title = {Update on the Desecheo Island Flora},
Journal = {CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {295-304},
Abstract = {The introduction of non-native organisms has caused changes in island
   ecosystems world-wide. Two of the main drivers of island extinctions and
   ecosystem changes are goats and black rats. These organisms alter
   considerably the flora of island ecosystems by limiting propagule
   production and dispersal as well as constant herbivory. Even so, island
   floras can still be diverse if human contact is limited and removal of
   non-native organisms is carried out. This can start regeneration of the
   damaged ecosystem and begin the process of ecosystem restoration. The
   goal of our research was to update the flora of the island from the last
   16 or more years. Plants were opportunistically observed, and some
   collected along trails, ridges, coastal areas, and in the most
   accessible valleys where other restoration efforts were taking place.
   Each collected plant was identified in the field, photographed,
   described, and its GPS coordinates were recorded. A total of 69 species
   were observed in the field, 17 of which were collected and vouchered in
   the UPR-Mayaguez Herbarium. Populations of some native plants, such as
   Harrisia portoricensis Britton (Cactaceae) seemed to be abundant while
   others, such as the Mammillaria nivosa Link. (Cactaceae) were found in
   marginal areas with a highly-restricted population. New populations of
   previously unknown non-natives Spathodea campanulata P. Beauv.
   (Bignoniaceae), Cenchrus ciliaris L. (Poaceae), and Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) in Desecheo are of conservation
   concern. Control or quick removal of these invasive species would help
   the restoration process of the island.},

Abstract = {Pods and leaves of legumes trees are used as feed supplements, these are
   used to diminish the deficiency of nitrogen present in pastures in the

   and the in vitro degradations of pods of Leucaena leucocephala,
   Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Samanea saman, Acacia cochliacantha, Guazuma
   ulmifolia and leaves of L. leucocephala and G. ulmifolia. Dry matter,

   (ADF), dry matter degradation (DMDEG), neutral detergent fiber
   degradation (NDFDEG), volatile fatty acids, ashes and total
   concentration of bacteria, were determined. The experimental design was
   completely randomized. The pod of E. cyclocarpum (19.50 \%), the pods
   (19.83 \%) and leaves (21.57 \%) of L. Leucocephala had the highest
   content of CP. The E. cyclocarpum pod presented 28.38 \% of NDF. The
   leaf of L. leucocephala (24.22 \%) and the pods of S. saman (25.06 \%)
   and E. cyclocarpum (20.40 \%) had the lowest contents of ADF (P<0.05).
   E. cyclocarpum (73.06 and 38.68 \%) and S. saman (66.01 and 35.86 \%)
   pods quantified the highest DMDEG and NDFDEG (P<0.05). Therefore, the
   pods of E. cyclocarpum and S. saman are a viable alternative for feeding
   ruminants in the dry tropic given their chemical and fermentative

Abstract = {A study was conducted in three different soils (Toje, Hatso and Alajo)
   to evaluate the effectiveness of the indigenous rhizobia that nodulate
   five indigenous /or introduced tree legumes (Albizia lebbeck, Acacia
   mangium, Acacia auriculiformis, Mellitia thonningii and Leucaena
   leucocephala,) as well as their ability to nodulate other legumes
   (Cajanus cajan, Crotalaria ochroleuca and Vigna unguiculata) other than
   their host legumes. The results indicate that, indigenous rhizobia
   capable of nodulating each of the five tree legumes were present in all
   the three soils used for the study with the native rhizobia population
   ranging from 22 cells /g soil in Alajo soil to 5200 cells /g soil in
   either Hatso or Toje series. Rhizobia isolates from Mellitia thonningii
   were specific as they nodulated only their host legumes whilst that from
   Leucaena leucocephala, Crotalaria ochroleuca and Cajanus cajan were
   moderately promiscuous, with NGR 234 being highly promiscuous. Over 63\%
   of the 200 rhizobia isolates were found to be ineffective on the five
   legume trees tested, whilst almost 18\% were either found to be
   moderately effective or effective. The majority of the isolates from the
   five tree legumes were found to be ineffective on their respective host
   plant with ineffectiveness ranging from almost 43\% in the case of
   Acacia auriculiformis to 88\% in the case of Acacia mangium isolates.
   The high proportion of ineffective isolates (63\%) and relatively low
   proportion of effective (18\%) or moderately effective (18\%) isolates
   call for the need for inoculation of the tree legumes in this study with
   an effective and competitive strains for maximum nodulation and nitrogen
   fixation.},

Abstract = {Collagenase (100 mu g) induced a large plasma extravasation, during the
   first 15 min after its injection in rat paw, associated with the rapid
   development of oedema which subsided after 6 h. The extent of the oedema
   was similar in normal and kininogen-deficient rats. The swelling induced
   in normal rats was reduced by HOE 140
   (D-Arg{[}Hyp(3),Thi(5),D-Tic(7),Oic(8)]bradykinin), a bradykinin B-2
   receptor antagonist, and by three serine protease inhibitors, soybean
   trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), Leucaena leucocephala trypsin inhibitor 1
   (LLTI-1) and Leucaena leucocephala trypsin inhibitor 2 (LLTI-2). These
   agents had no effect on the oedema induced in kininogen-deficient rats.
   The swelling was also reduced by methysergide, indomethacin, ketoprofen
   and methylprednisolone. It was increased by heparin, but it was not
   modified by mepyramine, WEB 2086 (3-{[}4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9
   methyl-6H-thieno{[}3,2-f]{[}1,2,4]-triazolo-{[}4,3-a]{[}1,4]-diazepine-2
   -yl]-1-(4-morpholinyl)-1-propanone) and N-G-nitro-L-arginine. In vitro,
   collagenase did not release kinins from rat plasma or from purified
   T-kininogen. LLTI-1 and LLTI-2 did not inhibit collagenase activity for
   one of its specific substrates. Kinins are thus involved in the
   development of collagenase oedema in normal rats. Their generation would
   be indirect following changes in matrix proteins in extravascular
   spaces. Nevertheless, kinins are not the decisive mediators of the
   swelling. Serotonin, possibly released from platelets, and prostanoids
   participate in the inflammatory process.},

Abstract = {For three consecutive years, the performance of soil macrofauna was
   studied in two types of grasslands with fattening cattle: a) native
   grassland, b) native grassland with Leucaena leucocephala in 100 \% of
   the area. The individuals number and biomass of the soil macrofauna were
   determined, as well as its temperature and humidity percentage. A linear
   model of fixed effects that controlled the type of grassland, the year
   and the grassland x year interaction was used. The results showed a
   higher biomass value (53.66 versus 31.36 g/m(2)) in the leucaena system,
   compared to the native grassland. There was a significant increase of
   the soil humidity percentage in the b) system. Soil temperature and the
   number of macrofauna individuals showed interaction (P < 0.01) between
   the grassland types and the studied years. Three phyla (Arthropods,
   Annelida and Mollusca), five classes and seven orders were identified in
   the diversity of the groups. The presence of three genera of the phylum
   Annelida (Polypheretima, Onychochaeta and Diplotrema) was found. It is
   concluded that the high biomass values of the edaphic fauna found in the
   system with Leucaena leucocephala is due, among other factors, to the
   presence of a greater plant diversity, a larger amount of better quality
   leaf litter and a more favorable microenvironment for macrofauna
   activity due to a higher soil humidity. The introduction of leucaena in
   livestock production systems is recommended since it supplies shade and
   feed to the animals and stimulates and diversifies the soil biological
   activity.},

   plot. The Jaccard similarity coefficient was used for the low stratum
   (herbaceous plants). In the high stratum, 16 families belonging to 25
   genera and 28 species were recorded. The species with the highest number
   of individuals were Salix nigra, Leucaena leucocephala, Ricinus communis

Abstract = {Coagulation is a water and wastewater treatment technology that has been
   widely used due to its high efficiency and effectiveness. Various
   inorganic salts are commonly used as coagulant; however, there are some
   negative impacts of utilization of these chemical coagulants, such as
   high costs, large sludge volume, and also potential negative impact to
   human health. To overcome these problems, natural-based coagulants have
   been explored to reduce and substitute chemical coagulants. In this
   study we investigated utilization ofLeucaena leucocephalaseed protein,
   extracted using 0.5 M MgCl(2)solution as natural coagulant to treat
   synthetic Congo red wastewater. From the protein solubility profile at
   various pH, it could be observed that leucaena protein's isoelectric
   point was around pH 4. The optimization of coagulation condition was
   done by using Response Surface Method (RSM)-Central Composite Design
   (CCD) with variations of pH (2.93-4.12), coagulant dose (183.52-496.58
   mg eq BSA/L), and dye concentration (44.1-56 mg/L). This experimental
   design was used to obtain the optimum condition that gave maximum dye
   removal percentage and minimum sludge volume. It was found that pH,
   coagulant dose, and dye concentration were significant for dye removal
   and sludge volume. Furthermore, it became evident that charge
   neutralization was the coagulation mechanism in this study. Based on the
   obtained model, 88.61\% dye removal with 16.93 mL/L sludge volume was
   obtained at the optimum condition. The predicted optimum condition was
   in a good agreement with experimental data with relatively low error
   value. The obtained result implies good potency of leucaena as natural
   coagulant.},

Abstract = {Intensive silvopastoral system (ISS) is a successful sustainable grazing
   system for dual-purpose cattle with growing adoption in the tropics;
   however, there is a concern on the quality of dairy products from this
   system. The aim of this study was to compare the ISS with the
   traditional monoculture system (MS) in terms of milk composition, soft
   cheese composition and yield, and the sensory acceptability of cheese
   during two seasons of a tropical area in Mexico. Twenty-four cows at the
   first 3 months postpartum were allocated evenly to two groups. The cows
   in ISS grazed in paddocks of Leucaena leucocephala associated with
   Cynodon nlemfuensis whereas the cows in MS grazed in C. nlemfuensis.
   Milk samples were collected weekly during the rainy and dry seasons for
   chemical analysis and fresh soft cheese making. The cheese was analyzed
   chemically, and cheese acceptability was evaluated for the sensory
   attributes of appearance, texture, flavor, color, and overall
   acceptability. Milk percentages of fat, protein, SNF, and lactose did
   not differ significantly between systems being, 3.5, 3.0, 8.1, and 4.4
   in ISS and 3.6, 2.9, 8.0, and 4.4 in MS, respectively. Similar results
   were obtained for cheese content of fat/DM and protein/DM. In the rainy
   season, adjusted cheese yield from ISS (24.2\%) was higher compared with
   MS (20.8\%). Cheese texture in the dry season showed more acceptability
   for ISS. This study provide absence of adverse effect of ISS on milk and
   cheese composition; moreover, ISS improve the yield and acceptability of
   soft cheese.},

Abstract = {The objective of the present study was to investigate chemical
   composition and methane emission of some tropical forage legumes from
   Indonesia, namely Acacia mangium, Acacia villosa, Calliandra
   calothyrsus, Albizzia falcataria, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena
   diversifolia, and Sesbania grandiflora. These leaves were oven dried at
   60 degrees C, ground by a hammer mill (1 mm screen size), and subjected
   to chemical composition analyzes and in vitro incubation. Determination
   of chemical composition included crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE),
   neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), lignin, and
   tannin. Samples (200 mg DM) were incubated in vitro with 10 ml of
   ruminal fluid and 20 ml of buffer solution at 39 degrees C for 24 h in
   four replicates. Parameters measured were total gas production, methane
   emission, volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiles, ammonia concentration,
   microbial population (total bacteria and total protozoa), and in vitro
   organic matter digestibility (IVOMD). Data were subjected to analysis of
   variance and Tukey's test. Results showed that a number of forages
   contained CP of more than 30\% DM, i.e. Acacia villosa, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Leucaena diversifolia, and Sesbania grandiflora.
   Exceptionally high tannin content was found in Acacia villosa in which
   the value was above 20\% DM. The lowest total gas production was
   observed in the in vitro incubation of Acacia villosa, whereas the
   highest gas production was observed in that of Sesbania grandiflora.
   This pattern was also observed for the IVOMD parameter. The lowest and
   the highest methane emissions were observed in the incubation of Acacia
   villosa and Sesbania grandiflora, respectively.},

Abstract = {Gramineae do not meet the needs of ruminants in the tropics, and their
   marked seasonal production causes disadvantages in animal production; in
   addition, high fiber levels and low protein content result in a higher
   production of greenhouse gases (GHG). For this reason, this study
   intended to supplement the diet by adding different foliage levels of
   tropical trees with the objective of evaluating the effect of
   incorporating 15, 30, and 45\% of Moringa oleifera, Leucaena
   leucocephala or Guazuma ulmifolia on a diet based on Cynodon nlemfuensis
   grass during ruminal fermentation in vitro. The methodology consisted of
   ten treatments with different inclusion percentages of three different
   trees; the chemical composition, in vitro ruminal fermentation, dry
   matter degradation (IVDMD), pH, volatile fatty acid concentration
   (VFAs), biogas production and emission of methane (CH4) and carbon
   dioxide (CO2) were determined. Data were analyzed through a completely
   randomized design. The chemical composition of the diets showed
   differences (P < 0.05) when tree foliage was added gradually to the
   diet; the IVDMD was different (P < 0.05); pH of the treatments showed no
   differences (P > 0.05); VFA concentration was different (P < 0.05), the
   diet with 45\% of Moringa oleifera had the best VFA concentration;
   however, the total biogas production and CH4 and CO2 concentrations were
   lower (P < 0.05) in the diet with 45\% Leucaena leucocephala. In
   conclusion, the addition of 45\% of Leucaena leucochephala to the diet
   improved chemical composition without affecting the VFA concentration
   and producing less CH4 and CO2 (18 and 24\%, respectively).},

Abstract = {Mimosine is a toxin present in the tree-legume leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala), including its root nodules and the root exudates. The
   leucaena-nodulating Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 degrades mimosine
   (Mid(+)) and utilizes it as a source of carbon and nitrogen. Twelve
   TAL1145 mutants defective in mimosine degradation (Mid(-)) were made
   through Tn3Hogus, TnphoA or kanamycin-resistance-cassette insertions. A
   5(.)0 kb Pstl fragment of TAL1145, subcloned from a cosmid clone
   containing mid genes for mimosine degradation, complemented most of the
   Mid- mutants. Sequencing this fragment and the adjacent 0(.)9 kb Pstl
   fragment identified five genes, midA, midB, midC, midD and midR, of
   which the first three genes encode ABC transporter proteins involved in
   mimosine uptake, while midD encodes an aminotransferase required for
   degrading mimosine into 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone, and midR is a regulatory
   gene encoding a LysR-type transcriptional activator. The location of
   MidA in the periplasm was shown by making two midA::phoA fusions, which
   made active alkaline phosphatase in the periplasm. The various mid::gus
   and midA::phoA fusions were inducible by mimosine, and a midD::gus
   fusion mutant showed beta-glucuronidase activity in the leucaena
   nodules, indicating that midD is expressed in the nodules. Similarly, a
   midA::phoA fusion expressed alkaline phosphatase activity in the
   leucaena nodules, indicating that mimosine induces midA transcription in
   the bacteroids. mid genes are specific for the Mid(+) strains of
   leucaena Rhizobium and are absent in strains of other Rhizobium,
   Sinorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium spp.},

Abstract = {Potential vegetation in a small island ecologically plays an important
   role towards life sustainability of wild animals in the island. To find
   out the compositions, structures, and benefits of vegetation in forest
   ecosystem of small islands, a vegetation analysis was needed The result
   of analysis was beneficial, helping to find out the condition of forest
   community balance, as well as to explain the interactions inside and
   between species. Vegetation observation was needed in Utilization and
   Protection block in Ontoloe Island, from littoral to terrestrial until
   the center of the island A combination of Judgemental and Systematic
   Random Sampling was applied to determine the research sites in 2 blocks.
   In the Utilization block 3 sites were identified, while in the
   Protection block, other 4 sites were determined The distance of each
   site was 100 meters. In every site, there were 3 replicas at a distance
   of 50 meters. The vegetation data obtained was analyzed the Importance

   levels, Imperata cylindrica dominated in seddling level, whereas
   Rhizphora mucronata dominated the littoral area. The domination of
   invasive species of Leucaena leucocephala and Imperata cylindrica has
   threatened and reduced the vegetation diversity in Ontoloe Island.
   Biological controlling both 2 species could be used by introducing
   ruminant animals such as timor deer (Cervus timorensis), which in turn
   would conserve the ancient Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis Ouwens,
   1912) in Ontoloe Island, by providing enough feeds of Timor deer for

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala growing in the tropics and subtropics serves as
   potential forage for livestock because its foliage is rich in protein,
   fiber, and minerals. However, its use for livestock feed has been
   hindered by toxic nonprotein amino acid mimosine. Therefore, it is
   necessary to develop a method to reduce or eliminate mimosine from
   foliage. A previous study found that the fermentation of L. leucocephala
   foliage reduced the mimosine content and prompted the authors to isolate
   potent mimosine degrading microorganisms and characterize the mimosinase
   for the complete elimination of mimosine in the L. leucocephala foliage.
   The soil screening of the L. leucocephala tree surroundings led to the
   isolation of Arthrobacter sp. Ryudai-S1, which can degrade and
   assimilate mimosine as a nitrogen and carbon source. Mimosinase in this
   strain was found to be thermostable and showed strong activity. Docking
   model's inspection and the interaction energy calculation between
   mimosine-pyridoxal-5 `-phosphate (PLP) complex and the active site of
   this enzyme identified 11 important amino acid residues that stabilized
   the binding. Of these amino acid residues, mutation experiment suggested
   that Tyr-263 ` and Phe-34 stabilizes the substrate binding and play a
   critical role in guiding the substrate to proper positions to accomplish
   high catalytic efficacy and selectivity. These observations suggest that
   Arthrobacter sp. Ryudai-S1 could be potentially useful for the
   development of L. leucocephala feed with reduced mimosine content.},

Abstract = {Samford Research Station in coastal south-east Queensland was operated
   by CSIRO from the late 1950s-2002. Many experiments on tropical legumes
   and grasses were carried out on the station and many farm pastures were
   sown. Furthermore, once most experiments had ended, they were grazed as
   farm pastures. Hence, considerable experience was gained about how
   different species did or did not persist under farm,:,razing. This paper
   outlines these experiences with individual species of legumes and
   grasses and discusses how they relate to experimental results. In
   general, performance of species in farm pastures was similar to the
   results from experiments, provided the experiments were run for long
   enough and with appropriate grazing pressures. The main reason for the
   failure of short-term experiments to predict long-term results was that
   they did not allow sufficient time to establish whether recruitment
   could compensate for death of the original plants.
   The most persistent legumes were perennial peanut (Arachis glabrata),
   Pinto peanut (Arachis pinto) cv. Amarillo and leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala), followed by siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum) cv.
   Siratro, white clover (Trifolium repens) and Shaw creeping vigna (Vigna
   parkeri), all of which persisted in some situations. The most persistent
   and aggressive grass was Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum), with reasonable
   persistence from Queensland blue couch (Digitaria didactyla) and setaria
   (Setaria sphacelata).},

Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {237-261},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Browse and grain legumes offer considerable potential for enhancing
   animal productivity in the tropics. However, a major factor limiting the
   wider use of these plants is the ubiquitous distribution of a diverse
   array of natural compounds which are capable of precipitating adverse
   effects in animals. Manifestations of toxicity range from a marked
   reduction in animal performance and nutrient utilisation to profound
   neurological effects and increased mortality. This review identifies the
   primary anti-nutritional factors in tropical legumes and evaluates the
   prospects for their detoxification.
   Although protease inhibitors are widely distributed in legume forage and
   grains, their role appears to be secondary to that of other toxic
   compounds. Recent studies highlight the dominant impact of lectins in
   determining the nutritional value of seeds of Psophocarpus
   tetragonolobus (winged bean) and Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean).
   The presence of condensed tannins is a characteristic feature of many
   browse legumes, including Gliricidia sepium, Acacia species, Leucaena
   leucocephala and Albiziafalcataria. These polyphenolic compounds are
   sometimes accorded with beneficial attributes in ruminant nutrition by
   vir-tue of their capacity to suppress bloat and to prevent excessive
   degradation of high-quality leaf protein in the rumen. However, with
   respect to the condensed tannins of tropical forage legumes, there is
   increasing evidence of toxicity in all classes of livestock, including
   ruminants.
   The occurrence of toxic non-protein amino acids is a distinguishing
   feature of many forage and grain legumes. These amino acids contribute
   significantly to the toxicity of Leucaena leucocephala, Canavalia
   ensiformis and Lathyrus species.
   The distribution of several anti-nutritional factors in a single legume
   species causes difficulties with detoxification, particularly if the
   deleterious compounds are heat stable. Significant experimental
   procedures have recently been described for the detoxification of the
   winged bean and the jack bean, and these methods now await economic
   appraisal. The treatment of harvested leaves or the spraying of
   leguminous shrubs with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to alleviate the
   deleterious effects of condensed tannins is a comparatively recent
   innovation worthy of further investigation, particularly in view of
   striking improvements in the performance of sheep fed Acacia aneura. The
   most notable advance in detoxification relates to biotechnological
   manipulation of rumen function, enabling cattle grazing Leucaena forage
   to degrade the deleterious amino acid, mimosine, to innocuous residues.
   The prospects for exploiting this technique in the detoxification of
   other tropical legumes and forage plants should now be considered.
   However, the scope for any significant role of leguminous leaf meals in
   the nutrition of non-ruminant animals now appears to be limited, despite
   recent advances in detoxification. In the case of these feeding stuffs,
   the major constraints are the intrinsic low digestibility of the protein
   fraction and the inferior metabolisable energy content relative to that
   of the legume grains.},

Abstract = {Taro (Colocasia esculenta L. cv. Latiraj) is a vegetable for many people
   in tropical and sub-tropical countries in the world. Because of large
   quantities of vitamins and minerals, it has considerable value in the
   food market. As the Taro has raised market demand, it needs to increase
   production as much as possible. Agroforestry would be a possible
   production approach for Taro as it can be practised in a partially
   shaded conditions. The research aimed to evaluate the performance of
   Taro under woody perennials of Melia azedarach, Leucaena leucocephala,
   Albizia lebbeck and sole crop cultivation to get potential production
   and high financial return. This experiment was followed a single factor
   Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. The
   treatments were (1) sole cropping of Latiraj, (2) Latiraj-Melia
   azedarach, (3) Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck and (4) Latiraj-Leucaena
   leucocephala. The results showed the maximum number of stolon per plant
   (29.50) found in LatirajAlbizia lebbeck and noted the minimum number of
   stolon (19.17) was in LatirajLeucaena leucocephala. Also, the highest
   stolon length (60.85 cm) and girth (3.33 cm) were observed in
   Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck and Latiraj-Melia azedarach, respectively.
   Moreover, the highest stolon yield (10.08 ton/ha) was obtained from
   Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck compared to (9.85 ton/ha) Latiraj sole cropping.
   The maximum benefit-cost ratio (4.78) was recorded in the
   Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck, 24\% higher than (3.62) Latiraj sole cropping
   for economic performance. Finally, it was found that the Taro cv.
   Latiraj cultivation under Albizia lebbeck as an agroforestry practice
   would be a sustainable strategy to maximize the production, touching
   financial benefit and ensuring the proper utilization of vacant woodlots

Abstract = {Five species each of tree leaves, shrubs and grasses were nutritionally
   evaluated for their chemical constituents, carbohydrates, proteins and
   nitrogen fractions, following the Cornell net carbohydrate and protein
   system (CNCP). A summative approach was also used to derive the TDN
   (total digestible nutrient, (\%DM) at 1X maintenance) values of these
   feeds so that more realistic values can be obtained to decide their
   appropriate level of incorporation in total mixed ration of the
   ruminants. The CP varied from 12.27 to 21.79, 11.27 to 17.49 and 3.49 to
   4.27\% in tree leaves, shrubs and Grasses, respectively. Among the tree
   leaves, CP was hi-hest in Leucaena leucocephala (21.79\%) followed by
   Albizia lebbek (20.85\%) and lowest in Anogeissus pendula (17.49\%). In
   shrubs, the CP was maximum in Dichrostachys cinerea. Grasses were the
   richest in total carbohydrates compared to shrubs and tree leaves.
   Non-structural carbohydrate content varied greatly among the tree
   leaves, shrubs and grasses. Significantly lesser quantity of fraction C
   was present in Grewia optiva, Securengia virosa and Heteropogan
   contortus in tree leaves, shrubs and grasses respectively. The instantly
   degradable fraction A of nitrogen was higher in tree leaves followed by
   grasses and shrubs, whereas rapidly degradable fraction B I was higher
   in grasses followed by shrubs and tree leaves. Among the tree leaves and
   shrubs, Grewia optiva, Leucaena leucocephala, Securengia virosa and
   Zizyphus xylophyrus can be used as good sources of quality protein
   whereas, among the grasses, Heteropogan contortus and Dichanthium
   annulatum are better energy sources to the ruminants. The TDN estimates
   (at 1{*}X level of maintenance) showed a significant (P < 0.01) positive
   correlation with in vitro DM (r(2)=0.42) and CP (r(2)=0.59)
   digestibility, thus indicated the trustworthiness of the mathematical

Abstract = {Rhizospheric microbial communities improve the effectiveness of
   hyperaccumulators in the phytoremediation of heavy metals. However,
   limited access to tailing dams and inadequate assessment of plants'
   phytoremediation potential limit the characterization of native
   accumulators, hindering the effectiveness of local remediation efforts.
   This study evaluates the heavy metal sequestration potentials of
   Pennisetum purpureum, Leucaena leucocephala, and Pteris vittata and
   their associated rhizospheric microbial communities at the Marlu and
   Pompora tailing dams in Ghana. The results indicate shoot
   hyperaccumulation of Cd (334.5 +/- 6.3 mg/kg) and Fe (10,647.0 +/- 12.6
   mg/kg) in P. purpureum and L. leucocephala, respectively. Analysis of
   rhizospheric bacterial communities revealed the impact of heavy metal
   contamination on bacterial community composition, associating Fe and Cd
   hyperaccumulation with Bacillus, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas species.
   This study reports the hyperaccumulation potentials of L. leucocephala
   and P. purpureum enhanced by associated rhizosphere bacterial
   communities, suggesting their potential application as an
   environmentally friendly remediation process of heavy metals
   contaminated lands.
   The novelty of this study is the report of the heavy metal accumulation
   potentials of the fast-growing herbaceous plants Leucaena leucocephala
   and Pennisetum purpureum at abandoned gold mine tailing dams in Ghana.
   Substantial amounts of Cd (334.5 mg/kg) and Fe (10,647.0 mg/kg) were
   accumulated in P. purpureum and L. leucocephala shoots, indicating their
   hyperaccumulation potentials. The concentration of heavy metal levels in
   the rhizosphere influenced the bacterial community structure, with the
   abundance of Bacillus, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas linked to
   hyperaccumulation. The outcome of this study supports the utilization of
   L. leucocephala and P. purpureum in the phytoremediation of lands

Title = {Nitrogen use efficiency and N-competition between Leucaena hedgerows and

Abstract = {A two-year field experiment was undertaken on an Alfisol in the
   forest-savanna transition zone of southwestern Nigeria, to study the
   effect of alley cropping, root barrier, application of N fertilizer and
   Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. prunings, on N utilization by maize
   and Leucaena hedgerows. The trial was conducted using a split-plot
   design with three replications. Mainplot treatments were alley cropping
   with Leucaena leucocephala planted at 4m interhedgerow spacing and
   control (no hedgerows). Four subplot treatments were with and without
   addition of hedgerow prunings, and with and without presence of root
   barriers. There were no significant effects of presence of Leucaena
   hedgerows and root barriers on maize grain yield. Leucaena hedgerows
   recovered about 7\% of the 30 kgN/ha applied as ((NH4)-N-15)(2)SO4 to
   maize during one year. Application of hedgerow prunings increased maize
   yield by 82\% and N-uptake in the grain by 50\% over the treatment
   without prunings. Recoveries of N-15-labelled prunings and fertilizer N
   by maize plants were about 10 and 16\% respectively. Prunings addition
   increased N-15-fertilizer recovery in main season maize and the residual
   value during the minor season by about 36\% over the treatment without
   prunings. Pruning N-use efficiency was higher for plants grown adjacent
   to the hedgerows than in the middle of alleys during main season and the
   reverse was observed during the minor season. Absence of a root barrier
   increased N-use from prunings. Large amounts of applied N in the system
   were unaccounted for. Results of the trial showed, that without root
   barrier there was no measurable below-ground N competition between
   Leucaena hedgerows and maize.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the biomass production of
   elephant grass and leucaena in Parana state, Brazil, for the generation
   of renewable energy. Two field studies were conducted in the
   municipality of Ibipora (23 degrees S, 51 degrees 01'W). In the first
   study, the dry matter accumulation curves were calculated, with sampling
   at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 days after cultivation. The second study was
   conducted in a randomized complete block design with split plots. The
   total aboveground biomass production of elephant grass and leucaena was
   estimated in the main plot. Cutting times of 60 and 120 days after
   cultivation were evaluated in the subplots. The productivity of dry
   matter (kg.ha(-1)) was estimated using the biomass data. In addition,
   the potential production of energy from the burning of elephant grass
   biomass, and the potential production of total aboveground biomass and
   energy of elephant grass (in Parana) was estimated using an
   agrometeorological model. Elephant grass can be potentially used as an
   alternative energy source. Leucaena has slow initial growth, and it must
   therefore be evaluated over a longer period in order to determine its
   potential. Simulation analyses of the capability of power generation,
   conducted based on the annual dry matter production, revealed that
   elephant grass could be an important source of renewable energy in the
   state of Parana.},

Abstract = {The amendment effect of Leucaena biochar was investigated in incubation
   study in acidic soil (pH (water (H2O)) = 4.5) of northwest India. The
   biochar (BC) was mixed at 2\%, 4\%, and 6\% with soil and change in soil

   (NO3--N), exchangeable bases (calcium + magnesium, potassium, sodium)
   (Ca + Mg, K, Na), aluminum (Al), and Bray's phosphorus (P) were measured
   periodically. The mean increase in soil pH was 0.65, 1.35, and 2.0 unit
   at 2\%, 4\%, and 6\% (w/w) of biochar incorporation, respectively.
   Application of biochar significantly (P < 0.01) reduced ammonium
   (NH4+-N) content of soil, whereas NO3-N concentration increased by
   threefold and fivefold by application of 2\% and 4\% (w/w) of biochar,
   respectively. Exchangeable soil potassium (K) and Ca + Mg concentrations
   increased with the application of biochar. Application of biochar above
   2\% (w/w) reduced exchangeable Al concentration to nondetectable limit.
   The study suggests Leucaena biochar may serve as an amendment for N
   transformation in highly acidic soil.},

Abstract = {Effects of intercropping Leucaena on early teak growth and soil

   teak in the 33\% teak-67\% Leucaena mixture were 45\% taller and 71\%
   larger in diameter at breast height than those in pure stands. Implicit
   in this growth stimulation of teak by intercropped Leucaena is its
   nitrogen fixing ability and potential as a soil improver. Soil analysis
   of the experimental plots provided corroborative evidence in this
   respect. Total nitrogen increased with increasing relative proportion of

Abstract = {This study was conducted to evaluate nutritive value of forages commonly
   used as ruminant feeds in North Sumatra, Indonesia. Seven species of
   grasses and five species of legumes were collected during the rainy
   season. The results showed that chemical composition, in vitro
   digestibility of dry matter (DMD), organic matter (OMD) and crude
   protein (CPD), in vitro gas production and metabolizable energy (ME)
   content greatly varied among the species of grass and legume forages.
   The CP content ranged from 6.6 to 16.2\% in grass and from 17.5 to
   29.1\% in legumes; while NDF content of grass and legume ranged from
   57.2 to 66.2\% and from 24.4 to 55.6\%, respectively. The DMD, OMD and
   CPD of grass ranged from 49.1 to 62.2\%, 51.9 to 64.4\% and 50.5 to
   60.3\%; while in legumes the values ranged from 59.1 to 71.8\%, 65.2 to
   72.0\% and 68.2 to 71.6\%, respectively. The ME content of grass varied
   from 6.4 to 9.3 MJ/kg and from 6.5 to 8.3 MJ/kg for legumes. In general,
   within species of grass Cynodon plectostachyus contained higher CP but
   was lower in NDF that resulted in much higher digestibility; a similar
   result was also found in Leucaena leucocephala for the legumes. The two
   forages also contained much higher ME than the others. In conclusion,
   the nutritive value of forages in North Sumatra, Indonesia during the
   rainy season was relatively high as ruminant feed, with the best quality
   noted for Cynodon plectostachyus and Leucaena leucocephala.},

Abstract = {Pollen and spores have been identified as major airborne bio-particles
   inducing respiratory disorders including allergic rhinitis and atopic
   dermatitis among hypersensitive individuals. The present study was
   conducted with a view to inves-tigating monthly depositional rate of
   atmospheric palynomorphs to determine the influence of the immediate
   vegeta-tion on airborne pollen distribution; allergenic activities of
   dominant atmospheric pollen types at selected study locations in Taraba
   and Bauchi States, Northeastern Nigeria. Bioaerosols were collected
   using Tauber-like pollen traps and subjected to standard palynological
   treatment procedures, microscopy and photomicrography. Plant
   enu-meration within the surrounding vegetation revealed that some
   airborne pollen types were produced by local plants at the study
   locations. Spores of Nephrolepis sp., Pteris sp. and a trilete fern, as
   well as diatoms were also recovered. Crude protein contents of some
   dominant pollen types; Borreria verticillata (L.) G.F.W. Meyer and
   Panicum maximum Jacq. for Taraba State; Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit. and Terminalia catappa L. for Bauchi State, were quantified and
   extracted to sensitize Mus musculus mice for serology (ELISA) and
   haematology (differential and total white blood cell counts).
   Statistical significance was tested and recorded in the correlation
   between levels of serological and haematological parameters elicited by
   each test group; differences between levels of these parameters elicited
   by each test group and those of the control, as well as at varying
   sensitization periods. In the Leucaena leucocephala test group, swollen
   body and histopathological morbid features showing more extensive areas
   of inflammatory cells and alveoli filled with fluid in the lungs, were
   recorded in two dead M. musculus, respectively. The study revealed that
   all the tested pollen types are possible allergens at the study
   locations, establishing a complexity of interaction among allergy
   mediators at varied periods of mice sensitization and forming a paradigm
   of human immune response to the different pollen allergens.},

   and as a feed source for dairy goats. MBRLC has also developed sloping
   agricultural land technologies for corn production using hedgerows of
   nitrogen-fixing trees and shrubs for soil erosion control and soil
   amelioration. Whereas L. leucocephala was used exclusively for these
   hedgerows, its popularity has declined due to the psyllid, and it is now
   being replaced by L. diversifolia, Desmodium rensonii and Flemingia

Abstract = {L-mimosine is a compound found in Leucaena leucocephala, that is used as
   animal feed due to its high protein content, but it can also cause
   intoxication. Due to its low solubility in organic and aqueous solvents,
   its administration in laboratory animals is difficult, especially in
   delicate periods such as pregnancy. Thus, to circumvent such problems,
   this study proposes a stress-free form of oral administration with
   gelatin tablets with flavoring (meat broth) for 14 consecutive days of
   the gestational period (GD06 to GD20). For that, 17 pregnant Wistar rats
   divided into 3 groups were used: control (CO; n = 5) not treated;
   gelatin (GEL; n = 6), which received a gelatin tablet with flavoring;
   and gelatin with flavoring added 140 mg/kg of L-mimosine (GM; n = 6).
   All animals received feed and water ad libitum. The parameters analyzed
   were body weight gain, water and feed consumption, serum biochemistry,
   blood count and reproductive indices. Among these, only the real and
   total weight gains of dams showed statistically significant differences,
   with a decrease in the group GM. Thus, we could observe that flavored
   gelatin was an efficient and effective administration method to
   insoluble compounds and long-term administration to pregnant rats, with
   quick adaptation and without refusal by the animals. In addition, we
   could observe a direct effect of L-mimosine on the animals' weight gain;
   however, the dose administered was not sufficient to confer maternal and
   fetal toxicity.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is a worldwide plant used as forage; however, its
   use in animal production has been limited because of the presence of a
   toxic nonprotein amino acid, L-mimosine. L-mimosine exhibits negative
   effects not only in ruminants but also in monogastric animals; however,
   there is little information available on the effect of this amino acid
   in monogastric species. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the general
   toxicity of L-mimosine in rats, as well as its effects on the endocrine
   and reproductive systems. L-mimosine was extracted from seeds of L.
   leucocephala that were administered orally by gavage to adult Wistar
   rats at different doses of 25, 40 and 60 mg/kg body weight/day for 28
   days. The following parameters were evaluated: weight gain, feed intake,
   serum enzymes, histopathology (liver, kidney, thyroid, thymus, and
   spleen), serum hormones (testosterone, corticosterone, T3 and T4) and
   sexual behavior. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed in animals,
   but histopathology revealed consistent lesions in the thyroids.
   Additionally, rats exposed to L-mimosine presented low serum levels of
   testosterone, decreased mount numbers and increased mount intervals.
   Therefore, our study reinforces the assumption that L-mimosine has
   goitrogenic potential and causes impairment in male reproductive
   performance.},

Abstract = {Forty-six Mesorhizobium strains associated with the leguminous plants
   Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania herbacea in an uncultivated Mexican

   identified as Mesorhizobium plurifarium based upon the close
   relationships with the reference strains for this species in PCR-based
   restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses, sequencing of 16S
   rRNA genes, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, and DNA-DNA
   hybridization. Although the strains isolated from both plants formed the
   same group in multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and cross-nodulations
   were observed in the laboratory, different electrophoretic types were
   obtained from the two plants grown in natural soils, indicating the
   existence of a preferable association between the plants and the
   rhizobia. The M. plurifarium strains from Mexico and the reference
   strains from Africa and Brazil formed different phenotypic clusters in a
   numerical taxonomy. The Mexican strains did not grow at 37 degreesC and
   were sensitive to salty-alkaline conditions, while the reference strains
   from Africa and Brazil grew at 42 degreesC and were more resistant to
   salty-alkaline conditions. These results demonstrate that both the
   plants and environmental factors affected the evolution of rhizobia and
   that the Mexican strains had adapted to the neutral soils and the cool
   climate where they were isolated.},

Abstract = {Ruminal, intestinal and total tract digestibility of dry matter (DM) and

   (Pithecellobium dulce) and moringa (Moringa oleifera) fodders were
   measured in this study, using nylon bag and mobile bag techniques. Three
   cattle were fitted with permanent rumen and duodenal cannulae.
   Intestinal digestibility was measured using the mobile nylon bag (MNB)
   technique with or without incubation in a pepsin-HCl solution, and a
   three-step in vitro technique. The rate of ruminal disappearances of DM
   and CP, and the potential degradation of CP from nylon bags of both
   Madras thorn and moringa fodders were significantly higher than that for
   leucaena fodder. Potential degradation (A+B) values of CP were 45.6\%,
   54.2\% and 52.8\% for leucaena, Madras thorn and moringa fodders,
   respectively. Average DM and CP digestibility in the intestine and total
   tract for both Madras thorn and moringa fodders were significantly
   higher than for leucaena fodder. Average digestibility of DM and CP in
   the intestine and total tract measured using MNB without pepsin-HCl
   solution was significantly lower than with pepsin-HCl and with the

Title = {Prenatal toxicity of L-mimosine in Wistar rats},
Journal = {TOXICON},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {254},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {L-Mimosine is the main active component of the plant Leucaena
   leucocephala. Due to its metal-chelating mechanism, it interacts with
   various metabolic pathways in living organisms, making it a potential
   pharmacological target, although it also leads to toxicity. The present
   study aimed to investigate the transplacental passage of L-mimosine and
   its effects on embryofetal development. Pregnant Wistar rats were
   divided into control groups (CO2; n = 8 or CO3; n = 6, according to
   experimental design 2 or 3) that received only the vehicle, and groups
   that received doses of 60 (n = 9), 100 (n = 8), 140 (n = 9), and 240 (n
   = 7) mg/kg of L-mimosine from gestational day (GD) 6-19. For the
   transplacental analysis, five rats were used: two as controls and three
   treated with a dose of 140 mg/kg L-mimosine from GD12 to 14. All the
   animals received food and water ad libitum. The parameters analyzed were
   body weight gain; water and food consumption; serum biochemistry; blood
   cell counts; reproductive indices; and histopathological, visceral and
   skeletal analyses of the fetuses. In the groups that received doses of
   60, 100, and 140 mg/kg, alterations (P < 0.05) in the skeletal
   development of the fetuses were observed. In the 240 mg/kg group, a
   decrease (P < 0.05) in total food consumption; a decrease (P < 0.05) in
   absolute leukocyte and neutrophil counts; alterations (P < 0.05) in the
   levels of ALT, GGT, and creatinine enzymes; a decrease (P < 0.05) in the
   relative weight of the thymus along with a loss of the corticomedullary
   distinction; coalescence of lymphoid follicles in the spleen; and
   skeletal and visceral alterations and alopecia were observed. L-Mimosine
   was detected in the amniotic fluid of the rats. These results
   demonstrate the complex action of L-mimosine, leading to toxic effects
   on both dams and fetuses, highlighting the risk of exposure to this
   substance during the perinatal period, which negatively impacts
   embryo/fetal and neonatal growth and development.},

Abstract = {Ruminal fermentation and methane production in a sheep silvopastoral
   system were quantified with the in vitro gas production technique.
   Evaluations were done of local energy sources (molasses, Zea mays L. and
   Musa paradisiaca L.), of the base forage (Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania),
   of forage tree foliage (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) and Leucaena
   leucocephala cv. Cunningham), and diets combining these elements.
   Ruminal fluid was collected from five sheep (Pelibuey x Katandin; 40 +/-
   3 kg). Five treatments (diets) containing different mixtures of forage
   tree foliage, energy sources and the base forage were analyzed in a
   completely random experimental design. Maximum gas volume production (V)
   was observed in M. paradisiaca (544 ml/g(-1) DM) and Z. mays (467
   ml/g(-1) DM) (P <= 0.05). The lowest V values were for the foliage of G.
   sepium (253 ml/g(-1) DM) and L. leucocephala (180 ml/g(-1) DM) (P <=
   0.05). Of the diets, D4GMP (48\% P. maximum, 30\% G. sepium, 7\% Z.
   mays, 15\% M. paradisiaca) had the highest V value. Methane production
   ranged from 6.31 to 9.60 L/Kg digested DM, and did not differ between
   treatments (P>0.05). Data were used to generate a potential fermentable
   gases emission index, which suggested that the diets containing slow
   fermenting carbohydrates resulted in higher gas emission rates.
   Inclusion of forage trees and local energy sources in sheep
   silvopastoral management systems can improve diet quality and contribute
   to reducing CH4 emissions.},

Abstract = {Condensed tannin (CT) of varying molecular weights (MWs) may affect

   fractions of different MWs (F1?>?F2?>?F3?>?F4?>?F5) from Leucaena
   leucocephala hybrid-Rendang (LLR) on the fungal mass and composition of
   fungal community were determined using molecular approaches. The results
   showed that the total fungi biomass decreased (p?<?.05) with the
   addition of higher-MWs CT fractions F1, F2 and F3 with values 35.3
   ?g/mL, 34.6 ?g/mL and 39.3?g/mL, respectively, when compared to that of
   the control sample (without CTs) at 52.1 ?g/mL. Sequencing of the
   polymorphic internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) by high-throughput
   sequencer, recovered mean of 109,190 sequences per-sample which
   comprised of a number of operation taxonomy units (OTUs) ranging from 22
   to 38 and were classified into 7 genera. Piromyces 4 was the dominant
   genus in the control representing ?70\% of the sequences. Relative
   abundance of the Piromyces 4 increased significantly (p?<?.05) with
   increasing MWs of the CT fractions, however the second dominant
   Neocallimastigaceae was significantly (p?<?.05) reduced. This study
   demonstrated that CT fractions of different MWs could decrease the

   and diversity, and the effect was more pronounced for higher-MWs CTs.
   Hence, the shift in fungal diversity, accompanied by changes in
   population mass would influence fibre digestibility in the rumen in the
   presence of high MW CTs.},

Abstract = {The nutritional evaluation of tropical forages in the Caribbean is
   limited. Therefore, this study was done to provide information on the
   nutritive value of 12 forages used in regional small ruminant production
   systems in the Caribbean region, utilising three different methods of
   forage evaluation. Samples of seven grasses Brachiaria arrecta,
   Brachiaria ruziziensis, Cynodon dactylon, Cynodon nlemfuensis, Digitaria
   eriantha, Megathyrsus maximus and Pennisetum purpureum; two leguminous
   multipurpose tree species (LMPTs) Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena
   leucocephala and three non-leguminous multipurpose tree species (NLMPTs)
   Moringa oleifera, Morus alba and Trichanthera gigantea were collected
   from one of two sites located in Trinidad and Jamaica. Analysis of
   nutritive value was done using proximate analysis, in vitro assays and
   near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Cynodon nlemfuensis had the highest
   crude protein (CP, 191.2 g/kg DM) of the grasses and Leucaena
   leucocephala and Moringa oleifera the highest CP (263.6 and 232.5 g/kg
   DM respectively) of the LMPTs and NLMPTs. The NLMPTs, Moringa oleifera
   and Morus alba had the highest starch, highest in vitro digestible
   organic matter in dry matter (IVDOMD, 651 and 655 g/kg DM respectively)
   and metabolisable energy (ME, 10.62 and 10.68 MJ/kg DM respectively) and
   the lowest neutral detergent fibre (NDF) of the MPTs. There was a strong
   positive relationship between the IVDOMD and both the CP and starch
   fractions and a strong negative relationship between the IVDOMD and both
   the NDF and acid detergent fibre (ADF) fractions. The NIRS predicted
   values had a strong relationship with the gross chemical CP, NDF, IVDOMD
   and ME) values of tropical forage species (R-2 = 0.91, 0.86, 0.70 and
   0.80 respectively). Overall, the forage species were above the minimum
   CP, IVDOMD and ME required to be classified as intermediate to good
   quality forages.},

Title = {Effects of selected Palestinian plants on the in vitro exsheathment of
   the third stage larvae of gastrointestinal nematodes},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Background: Gastrointestinal parasites are one of the main restrictions
   to small ruminant production. Their pathological importance is primarily
   related to the major production losses, in quantity or quality, induced
   by the direct action of worms. Control of these parasites is based
   exclusively on the frequent use of anthelmintic drugs. However, the
   resistance to anthelmintics in worm populations after commercialisation
   of chemical drugs is now widespread. Therefore, there is a need to find
   new natural resources to ensure sustainable and effective treatment and
   control of these parasites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   anthelmintic activity, as minimum inhibitory concentration (IC50 mg/mL),
   of different plant extracts using larval exsheathment inhibition assay
   using a two- species but steady population of parasitic nematodes (ca.
   20\% Teladorsagia circumcinta and 80\% Trichostrongylus colubriformis).
   Results: The study showed that the ethanolic extracts of 22 out of the
   48 plant extracts, obtained from 46 plant species, have an inhibitory
   effect > 50\% ( at concentrations of 100 mg/mL) on the third stage
   larvae (L3) of the nematodes exhibited the strongest inhibition activity
   (94\%) with IC50 of 0.02 mg/ mL, where other members of the Rhamnaceae
   family have shown to possess strong anthelmintic activity (70-89\%).
   Conclusions: Plant extracts are potential rich resources of
   anthelmintics to combat helminthic diseases. Our results suggest that
   extracts from Rhamnus elaternus, Epilobium hirsutum, Leucaena
   leucocephala and Rhamnus palaestinus have promising anthelmintic
   activity, with potential applications in animal therapeutics and feed.},

Abstract = {The effect of the inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala on the nutritional
   level and on the bioproductive perfon-nance of Siboney dairy cows was
   assessed. Three agroecosystems with trees of Leucaena leucocephala were
   used: (I) Cynodon nlemfuensis, planted on middle fertility soil, (II)
   natural pastures on poor fertility soils and (III) C nlemfuensis +
   Sporobolus indicus on middle fertility soils, as well as (IV), a control
   agroecosystem, based on the monoculture Panicum maximum on good
   fertility soil. All the herds consumed forage of king grass and
   sugarcane, according to the needs of feed balance, and different
   supplementation levels were used with molasses and concentrate. In all
   the agroecosystems with trees (I, II and III), the energy contribution
   of the ration was the main limiting factor to obtain superior milk
   yields, while in the monoculture agroecosystem (IV), it was the protein
   supply. In the dry season, the availability of nutrients from the
   endogenous feed sources of the agroecosystems I, II and III could
   guarantee between 3 and 5 kg of milk/cow/d, in total absence of external
   balanced feeds, while the IV showed higher dependence of the exogenous
   feed sources. In the agroecosystems I and III, more than 50 \% of the
   cows kept an ideal body condition throughout the lactation and more than
   65 \% arrived at calving with such condition, while in the II and IV,
   these values did not surpass 42 and 54 \%, respectively. It is concluded
   that in the agroecosystems in which leucaena was included in the
   grasslands, there are higher probabilities to attain a better nutrient
   balance in the ration of the animals. However, this depends on the
   requirements and nutritive quality of the basal pasture and the rest of
   the feeds in the diet.},

Abstract = {Alley cropping systems can change the weed community composition and
   reduce common weed species. However, it is unclear how different woody
   species intercalated with corn can affect weed abundance and community
   structure and corn yield in the tropics. The present study examined weed
   species diversity and community composition in alley cropping systems
   with three woody species associated with corn: Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) de Wit, Guazuma ulmifolia Lam., and Moringa oleifera Lam.
   independently, and corn mono-culture, as a control. The tree most
   dominant weed species were Ruellia nudiflora (Engelm. \& A. Gray) Urb.,
   Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., and Portulaca pilosa L. Our results showed
   that the alley cropping system compared with corn monoculture reduced
   the densities of common abundant weed species, changed weed community
   composition, maintained or increased plant diversity, but did not affect
   grain yield (t/h). Based on the sample completeness profile we found
   that Leucaena associated with corn had a higher weed diversity of order
   q =1 and 2 (Shannon and Simpson index) and showed higher evenness
   compared with corn monoculture, which showed the lowest evenness of all
   treatments. We found nine weed species that only grow in alley cropping
   systems and Waltheria americana L., Momordica charantia L. and
   Porophyllum punctatum (Mill) S.F. Blake. with higher den-sities. Our
   findings support the hypothesis that alley cropping systems not only
   changes weed community composition, but also favours biodiversity
   conservation without reducing corn yield.},

Abstract = {The factors that limit maize production in Yucatan, Mexico are
   decreasing yields and a constant increase of weedy species. A strategy
   to deal with these problems is to develop diversified productive
   schemes, such as agroforestry systems (SAF). This study determined the
   cover dynamics and biomass of weeds in an SAF composed of forage trees
   and maize during two cropping cycles (CC). Leucaena leucocephala,
   Guazuma ulmifolia, and Moringa oleifera, associated with maize, and a
   plot of maize monocrop were evaluated with a complete random block
   design with three replications. Weed cover, biomass, diversity and
   density were measured at the beginning, middle and end of the two CC.
   The weeds were collected in squares delimited by 50 x 50 cm frames
   distributed randomly in each experimental unit, separated by species and
   dried. With this data, an ANOVA was performed, and when significance was
   detected, the Tukey test (p <= 0.05) was used. At the beginning of the
   first CC, the SAF Guazuma + maize had lower weed cover (41 \%), while
   Moringa + maize was higher at the middle and end (71 and 49 \%). At the
   beginning of the second CC, the Guazuma + maize SAF had less weed cover,

   maize. At the end of both CC, the Guazuma + maize system had less weed
   diversity than the maize monocrop. At the beginning and end of the two

Abstract = {Cyclic-beta-glucans (C beta G) consist of cyclic homo-polymers of
   glucose that are present in the periplasmic space of many Gram-negative
   bacteria. A number of studies have demonstrated their importance for
   bacterial infection of plant and animal cells. In this study, a mutant
   of Rhizobium ( Sinorhizobium) sp. strain NGR234 (NGR234) was generated
   in the cyclic glucan synthase ( ndvB )-encoding gene. The great majority
   of C beta G produced by wild-type NGR234 are negatively charged and
   substituted. The ndvB mutation abolished C beta G biosynthesis. We found
   that, in NGR234, a functional ndvB gene is essential for hypo-osmotic
   adaptation and swimming, attachment to the roots, and efficient
   infection of Vigna unguiculata and Leucaena leucocephala.},

Abstract = {Our hypothesis is that the total replacement of ground corn grain (GCG)
   by cactus pear (CP) in association with 70\% of leucaena hay (LH)
   increases dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility and nitrogen
   metabolism and maintains the feeding behavior of cattle. The objective
   was to evaluate the effects of inclusion of these feeds on the
   nutritional parameters and nitrogen metabolism of cattle. Eight steers,
   average age of 12 months, weight of 267.5 +/- 15 kg, were distributed
   into two simultaneous 4 x 4 Latin squares according to a 2 x 2 factorial
   scheme, in which the first factor evaluated was different proportions of
   inclusion of LH (50 or 70\% DM basis), and the second factor was the
   total replacement of GCG with CP. There was lower DM intake in animals
   fed with 70\% LH. There was an interaction between the factors for DM
   digestibility, in which the animals fed CP did not differ regardless of
   the inclusion of LH, but for animals without CP, the greater inclusion
   of LH decreases DM digestibility. The inclusion of CP decreased free
   water intake. There was an interaction for total water intake (WI), in
   which the animals fed without CP presented similarity for this, while in
   the inclusion of CP, the animals fed 70\% of LH presented higher WI.
   Also, lower values of chewing were observed for animals fed with CP. The
   replacement of GCG with CP improves the efficiency of nitrogen
   utilization in the rumen. The inclusion of 70\% LH depresses intake.},

Abstract = {Following (iso)flavonoid induction, nodulation genes of the symbiotic
   nitrogen-fixing bacterium Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 elaborate a large
   family of lipooligosaccharidic Nod factors (NodNGR factors). When
   secreted into the rhizosphere of compatible legumes, these signal
   molecules initiate root hair deformation and nodule development. The
   nonreducing glucosamine residue of NodNGR factors are N acylated, N
   methylated, and mono- or biscarbamoylated, while position C-6 of the
   reducing extremity is fucosylated. This fucose residue is normally 2-O
   methylated and either sulfated or acetylated, Here we present an
   analysis of all acetylated NodNGR factors, which clearly shows that the
   acetate group may occupy position C-3 or C-4 of the fucose moiety.
   Disruption of the flavonoid-inducible nolL gene, which is preceded by a
   nod box, results in the synthesis of NodNGR factors that lack the 3-O-
   or 4-O-acetate groups. Interestingly, the nodulation capacity of the
   mutant NGR Omega nolL is not impaired, whereas introduction of the nod
   box::nolL construct into the related strain Rhizobium fredii USDA257
   extends the host range of this bacterium to Calopogonium caeruleum,
   Leucaena leucocephala, and Lotus halophilus. Nod factors produced by a
   USDA257(pnolL) transconjugant were also acetylated. The nod box::nolL
   construct was also introduced into ANU265 (NGR234 cured of its symbiotic
   plasmid), along with extra copies of the nodD1 gene. When permeabilized,
   these cells possessed acetyltransferase activity, although crude
   extracts did not.},

Abstract = {The natural abundance of N-15 and C-13, conventional soil analyses, and
   biomass production by maize were used to study the influence of five
   tropical tree species on soils and their fertility. The experiment was
   conducted in Morogoro, Tanzania, to compare Cassia (Senna) siamea,
   Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. tereticornis (all non-N-2-fixing), Leucaena
   leucocephala, Prosopis chilensis (both N-2-fixing), and a grass fallow.
   Maize biomass production, which was correlated with N uptake (P=0.001),
   was higher on soils from plots with 5-year-old Leucaena and Prosopis
   spp. compared to the grass fallow, while other tree species had less
   favourable effects on maize growth. The per cent N was higher in soil
   and delta(15)N of soil total N was lower under Prosopis sp. compared to
   soil under other tree species, which suggests an input from N-2 fixation
   by Prosopis sp. A transfer of fixed N to maize or to understorey grass
   species was, however, not indicated by the N-15 natural abundance.
   Prosopis sp. contributed more C to the soil than the other four tree
   species; the difference in delta(13)C between soils from Prosopis sp.
   plots and from grass fallow plots showed that the tree contributed 11\%
   to the total C of the soil over a period of 8 years. The leaves of the
   N-2-fixing species had a low ratio of lignin+phenols to N, and maize
   growth was negatively correlated with this parameter. The Eucalyptus
   spp. had leaves with a high lignin+phenols to N ratio, contributed very
   little C to the soil, and lowered the soil pH.},

   in Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil: Inga vera, Senna multijuga and Leucaena
   leucocephala.A total of 5353 individual insects, representing 77
   different species, were identified via morphology and DNA barcoding. The
   non-native L. leucocephala had the least diverse natural enemy community
   (N = 17 species), while two native species, I. vera and S. multijuga,
   were more diverse (N = 40 and N = 24 species, respectively).Individuals
   from the insect order Hymenoptera, a group dominated by parasitoid
   wasps, were the most diverse recovered from our samples in all hosts.
   Additionally, individual herbivore and parasitoid species were more
   likely to be found on a single host, with only four out of the 77
   species found in more than one plant species.This includes the
   generalist agricultural pest herbivore, Lasioderma serricorne, found in
   two species, and three parasitoids connecting native S. multijuga and
   non-native L. leucocephala communities, hinting at recent host
   shifts.Furthermore, different host plant traits had complex effects on
   the herbivore and parasitoid communities, where seed number per fruit
   promoted a propagating effect on the abundance and richness at both
   higher trophic levels, whereas seed and fruit weight did not.We
   highlight the importance of including parasitoids in insect community
   studies because they are highly diverse and provide important ecosystem
   services. Additional study of the biology, behaviour and distributions
   of parasitoids would be advantageous to inform conservation and

   weight, and total N content increased significantly in sorghum grown
   intercropped with nodulated Leucaena over the control, sole sorghum.
   Evidence is presented to indicate that in mixed culture, sorghum gains
   an average of 0.03 mg N day-1 plant-1 relative to sole-cropped sorghum
   in N-limiting sand culture. The gain in N content of intercropped
   sorghum, however, represented less than 1\% of the N budget of N-fixing
   Leucaena and was inadequate to sustain normal physiological development
   of sorghum.},

Title = {The mineral content of some tropical forages commonly used in small
   ruminant production systems in the Caribbean - Part 2},
Journal = {TROPICAL AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {97},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-56},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Understanding the differences in the mineral concentrations of forages
   is critical as it informs on which and how species can be used to
   improve the mineral content of diets. Also, with the constantly changing
   nutritive value of forages, regulating the mineral composition through
   on-going forage evaluation is important as deficient minerals can be
   identified and supplemented. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
   provide information on the mineral profiles for 12 forage species used
   in small ruminant production systems in the Caribbean. The forage
   species included seven grasses (Brachiaria arrecta, Brachiaria
   ruziziensis x), Cynodon dactylon, Cynodon, nlemfuensis, Digitaria
   eriantha, Megathyrsus maximus and Pennisetum purpureum); two leguminous
   multipurpose tree species (LMPTs) (Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena
   leucocephala) and three non-leguminous multipurpose tree species
   (NLMPTs) (Moringa oleifera, Morus alba and Trichanthera gigantea).
   Overall, the calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, cobalt, manganese, and zinc
   were within the range required for small ruminants. Brachiaria arrecta
   and Digitaria eriantha were the only two species with Na concentrations
   that were within the range required for small ruminants (0.9626 and
   4.4281 g/kg DM respectively). Brachiaria arrecta, Cynodon dactylon,
   Cynodon nlemfuensis, Leucaena leucocephala and Trichanthera gigantea
   were the only species with copper concentrations that were within the
   range required for small ruminants (11.50, 20.24, 11.95, 8.16 and 16.60
   mg/kg DM). The concentration of potassium in Pennisetum purpureum (39.1
   g/kg DM), Brachiaria arrecta (32.6 g/kg DM), and Cynodon nlemfuensis
   (34.0 g/kg DM), the concentration of iron in Cynodon dactylon (3340 g/kg
   DM) and molybdenum in both Cynodon dactylon (8.615 mg/kg DM) and Cynodon
   nlemfuensis (7.722 mg/kg DM) were above the maximum tolerable levels for
   small ruminants. The results of the study suggest that forages varied in
   mineral concentrations and the toxic and marginal concentrations of
   specific minerals in various forage species elicit the careful
   management of inclusion in diets, to ensure that the mineral
   concentrations are within the range required for small ruminants.},

Abstract = {A cosmid from the Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 symbiotic plasmid,

   confers ability to heterologous Rhizobium spp, to nodulate R. tropici
   hosts (Phaseolus vulgaris, Macroptilium atropurpureum, and Leucaena
   leucocephala). The observed phenotype is due to constitutive expression
   of the nodABCSUIJ operon, which has lost its regulatory region and is
   expressed from a promoter present in the cloning vector. Thin-layer
   chromatography (TLC) analysis of the Nod factors produced by this
   construction shows that it is still capable of synthesizing sulfated
   compounds, suggesting that the nodHPQ genes are organized as an operon
   that is transcribed in a nodD-independent manner and is not regulated by

   m spacing in two parallel lines with miniature trenches (0.3 m width and

   runoff by 23.3-32.5 \%, soil loss by 49.5-52.7 \%, loss of soil organic
   carbon (SOC), N, P, and K by 44.1-47.6, 61.5-62.2, 54.8-58.1, and

   including 10 of Desmodium spp., were susceptible. Accessions of D.
   distortum, D. heterophyllum, Leucaena leucocephala, Pueraria
   phaseoloides, Stylosanthes spp. including 6 Australian commercial
   cultivars, and Zornia latifolia were resistant. Although M. javanica has
   a narrow pasture legume host range and a very limited distribution
   throughout pasture evaluation sites, its pathogenicity to promising
   Desmodium spp. merits future surveys to determine its occurrence in the
   major pasture regions of tropical South America.},

Abstract = {The experiment was conducted to determine the effect of dried Leucaena
   leaf supplementation on rumen ecology, nutrient digestibility and
   urinary excretion of 2,3-dihydroxy pyridone (2,3-DHP) and 3,4-dihydroxy
   pyridone (3,4-DHP) in swamp buffaloes. Four rumen fistulated swamp
   buffaloes were assigned according to a cross-over design to receive 3.0
   kg/hd/d dried Leucaena leaf supplementation. Swamp buffaloes were fed
   with rice straw ad libitum and dried Leucaena leaf was supplemented at
   3.0 kg/hd/d. Apparent digestibility of CP were increased (P<0.05) in
   buffaloes supplemented with Leucaena leaf. The average values of BUN
   were 1.26, 13.08 mg/dl and NH3 were 8.9, 16.1 mg/dl in control and in
   the supplemented group, respectively. Moreover, there were differences
   in total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) in Leucaena leaf supplemented than
   in the control group. The efficiency of microbial protein synthesis
   (EMPS) were increased by Leucaena leaf supplemented group. Population
   sizes of the target total bacteria, predominant cellulolytic bacteria in
   the rumen were influenced by dietary treatments (P<0.05), as enumerated
   by real-time PCR assays. The strain of Synnergistes jonesii was pesented
   in swamp buffaloes fed supplemented with Leucaena leaf. Moreover, total
   DHP concentration was related to Leucaena and mimosine intake. Based on
   this study, it could be concluded that supplementation of dried Leucaena
   leaf at 3 kg/hd/d could be a good protein source for swamp buffaloes to
   improve nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation and microbial protein
   synthesis.},

Abstract = {Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus is a seed predator that has become widely
   distributed along with its native host, Leucaena leucocephala
   (Mimosoideae), which is a neotropical leguminous tree and one of the
   most invasive plants worldwide. Previous studies revealed that A.
   macrophthalmus is able to host-shift to several mimosoid species. Here,
   we aim to test the host-shift potential to other mimosoid and
   non-mimosoid plants and possible roles of interspecific competition,
   genetic background, and plant chemistry in host-shift. First, we found
   that A. macrophthalmus predator completed development on two new hosts:
   pigeon pea Cajanus cajan and Cajanus scarabaeoides (Faboideae), by
   rearing from seeds collected in South/Southeast Asia and Hawaii. In
   contrast, in most regions, both Cajanus species were infested only by
   other beetle species. Second, we performed no-choice tests using 11
   leguminous plants, covering all three subfamilies as potential hosts,
   including the two new hosts. A Taiwanese A. macrophthalmus population
   reared in the laboratory on Leucaena did not deposit eggs on any of the
   seeds of each tested species. To compare host-shift responses between
   populations, we also used a Hawaiian A. macrophthalmus population that
   had completed its development on freshly collected Leucaena seeds from
   the field. This population deposited eggs onto and hatching larvae
   burrowed into C. cajan seeds, although none developed beyond the larval
   stage. Third, the surface chemical composition of seed-pods of L.
   leucocephala and the two Cajanus species was dissimilar, although that
   of seeds was highly similar. Finally, all of the host-shifting A.
   macrophthalmus populations shared the same haplotypic group.},

Abstract = {Phosphate rock (PR) has been identified as a cheap supplementary source
   of phosphate for low pH soils. Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) improve plant
   uptake of P and other nutrients in acidic, low-P soils. Using two acid
   soils, Acrisols and Andosols, two experiments were carried out to
   evaluate the effect of Minjingu PR on the growth of four agroforestry
   multipurpose trees, Leucaena leucocephala, Cenna siamea, Grevillea
   robusta, and Eucalyptus grandis. Results of the first two experiments
   are reported. In the first experiment, 1-month-old seedlings received
   Minjingu PR at rates of 0 (PRO), 52 (PR1) and 77 (PR2) kg P/ha in lots
   of 2 kg soil. In the second experiment, the Minjingu PR rates of the
   first experiment were maintained and G. robusta and L. leucocephala were
   grown. In this experiment only an Acrisol was used.
   There was a slower response to Minjingu PR fertilizer application in
   Andosols compared with Acrisols. At 19 weeks after transplanting, PR2
   had caused a significant (p < 0.05) height increase over PRO in L.
   leucocephala, and both the height and the root collar diameter increased
   in the case of G. robusta grown on Acrisols. Addition of PR2 had a
   negative effect on height of C. siamea, whereas E. grandis did not
   respond to PR additions. In the second study, there were significant
   increases of up to 121\% in height (p < 0.001) and root collar diameter
   (p < 0.05) and 4.5 times biomass over the controls where L. leucocephala
   seedlings received PR only and PR + mycorrhizae at 12 months after
   planting (months after transplanting). Nodulation of L. leucocephala was
   significantly affected by P application and/or AM inoculation but was
   variable within treatments except for controls. Species x treatments
   interactions were significant at p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 for shoot and
   root dry weight, respectively. Phosphate rock and mycorrhizae
   inoculation have the potential, to improve legume performance in these
   acidic soils.},

Title = {Biomass allocation in five semi-arid afforestation species is driven
   mainly by ontogeny rather than resource availability},
Journal = {ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {74},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {Key message The changes in the relative biomass allocation to roots in
   juvenile stands of fast-growing (Leucaena leucocephala Lam., Moringa
   oleifera Lam., and Jatropha curcas L.) and slow-growing (Anacardium
   occidentale L. and Parkia biglobosa Jacq.) afforestation species are
   driven mainly by ontogeny rather than resource availability. However,
   silvicultural management aiming at increasing availability of water and
   particularly nutrients enhances biomass production in all species.
   Context Understanding the patterns of biomass allocation among tree
   species in response to ontogeny and to variation in resource
   availability is key to the successful restoration of degraded land using
   forest plantations.
   Aims This study assessed the effects of resource availability and
   ontogeny on biomass accumulation and partitioning in five semi-arid
   afforestation species.
   Methods The aboveground and belowground biomass production of
   fast-growing Leucaena leucocephala Lam., Moringa oleifera Lam., and
   Jatropha curcas L. and slow-growing Anacardium occidentale L. and Parkia
   biglobosa Jacq. was monitored following the application of manure (1 kg
   plant(-1)) and/or supplemental irrigation (0.5 L per sapling daily)
   during the first two rainy seasons and the intervening dry season on
   degraded cropland in Northern Benin.
   Results Biomass accumulation in the fast-growing species was positively
   impacted by fertilization and irrigation during both rainy seasons. The
   slow-growing species responded positively to the silvicultural
   treatments during the dry and second rainy season. The application of
   fertilizer alone increased the biomass of P. biglobosa by up to 335\%
   during the dry season. Fifteen months after planting, manure-treated L.
   leucocephala accumulated the most biomass (2.9 kg tree(-1)). The root
   fraction decreased with increasing tree size in all species. The
   comparison of root versus shoot allocation in trees of equal size
   indicated that the treatment-induced shifts in biomass partitioning were
   controlled by ontogeny, which explained 86-95\% of the variation in
   root-shoot biomass relationships.
   Conclusion While ontogeny was the main driver of biomass partitioning,
   increased resource availability induced a larger production of biomass,
   overall leading to greater aboveground production in all species.},

Abstract = {Mimosine is a toxic compound presents in the tropical legume Leucaena
   leucocephala which restrict the nutritional use of this plant in
   domestic animals. Both monogastrics and ruminants could undergo toxicity
   consuming this plant. Some ruminants can tolerate it because they have
   rumen microorganisms able to degrade mimosine and its pyridinediols
   derivatives: 3,4- y 2,3-Dihidroxypyridine (3,4- and 2,3-DHP), In the
   present study the existence of 2,3-DHP degrading-activity in mixed rumen
   bacterial cultures from cattle consuming L. leucocephala in Venezuela
   was determined, and the degradation of toxic pyridinediols by the rumen
   bacterium Synergistes jonesii was characterized. In vitro experiments
   using pure culture of S. jonesii indicated that the 2,3-DHP degradation
   was carried out at the end of the log-phase of bacterial growth and also
   the system showed substrate inhibition at high concentration of
   pyridinediols suggesting that a threshold of enzymes that allows
   2,3-DHP-degradation from the medium is needed. S. jonesii is unable to
   degrade mimosine but it showed degrading activity against the mimosine
   derivatives 3,4-DHP and its isomer 2,3-DHP. 3,4-DHP induces an isomerase
   activity, which is lacking when the culture grows in 2,3-DHP. This
   latest activity is the responsible of the transformation of 3,4-DHP into
   2,3-DHP. It was also showed that the degradation is a substrate-induced
   enzymatic system. However, the lack of substrate might cause the
   irreversible lost of 2,3-DHP degrading-activity, 2,3-DHP was found as
   intermediary substrate and also induced the expression of degrading
   enzymes in S. jonesii.},

   potential biocontrol agent for the notoriously invasive plant Leucaena
   leucocephala. The scanning electron micrographs of the head capsule,
   antenna, clypeolabrum, maxilla, labium, leg, spiracle, and anus of the
   larval stage of A. macrophthalmus also are provided for the first time
   for this species, with most of the traits reflecting the taxonomic
   placement of A. macrophthalmus in the genus Acanthoscelides. Successive
   instars are determined accurately by using a model of the distribution
   of the width of the larval head capsule. Therefore, the data generated
   from this study represent baseline information for further biological

Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Poisonous plants comprise the third
   largest category of poisons known around the world. Other than affecting
   the humans directly, they are the major cause of economic losses in the
   livestock industry since the advent of civilisation. Aim of the present
   study was to collect and systematically document the traditional
   knowledge of poisonous plants of Udhampur District for the benefit of
   humanity before it is entombed forever.
   Material and methods: Direct interviews of the informants were conducted
   and the plants identified as poisonous by them were collected,
   identified and herbarium sheets were prepared. The data collected
   through interviews was analysed with two quantitative tools viz, the
   factor informant consensus and fidelity level.
   Results: A total of 90 toxic plants were listed from the study site.
   Most dominant toxic families were Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Solanaceae,
   Apocynaceae and Euphorbiaceae. Most of the poisonous plants were herbs
   (57.1\%) and the whole plant toxicity was reported to be the highest
   (32.4\%) followed by leaves (23.1\%). According to the factor informant
   consensus, gastrointestinal category had the greatest agreement closely
   followed by the death category. The most important species on the basis
   of fidelity level for gastrointestinal category were Cannabis sativa,
   Cassia occidentalis, Cuscuta reflexa, Euphorbia helioscopia and
   Euphorbia hirta, for death category were Anagalis arvensis, Embelia
   robusta and Prunus persica, for dermatological category Euphorbia
   royleana, Leucaena leucocephala, Parthenium hysterophorus and Urtica
   dioica, and for sexual illness category were Calotropis procera and
   Carica papaya.
   Conclusion: Further phytochemical and pharmacological studies are
   required to ascertain the toxic components of the poisonous plants, so
   that they may be utilised for the betterment of future generations. (C)

Volume = {6},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Explaining large-scale patterns of variation in body size has been
   considered a central question in ecology and evolutionary biology
   because several life-history traits are directly linked to body size.
   For ectothermic organisms, little is known about what processes
   influence geographic variation in body size. Changes in body size and
   sexual size dimorphism (SSD) have been associated with environmental
   variables, particularly for Bruchinae insects, which feed exclusively on
   seeds during the larval stage. However, the effect of important seed
   traits on body size variation has rarely been investigated, and whether
   SSD varies substantially among populations within bruchine species is
   poorly known. Using the seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides
   macrophthalmus infesting its host plant Leucaena leucocephala, we
   investigated whether specific seed traits (hardness, size, water
   content, carbon/nitrogen ratio, and phenolic content) were determinant
   in generating geographic variation in body size and SSD of A.
   macrophthalmus. We also examined the relationships between body size and
   SSD with latitude and altitude. The body size of both sexes combined was
   not related to latitude, altitude, and any of the physical and chemical
   seed traits. However, the female body size tended to vary more in size
   than the males, generating significant variation in SSD in relation to
   latitude and altitude. The females were the larger sex at higher
   latitudes and at lower altitudes, precisely where seed water content was
   greater. Therefore, our results suggest that water content was the most
   important seed trait, most severely affecting the females, promoting
   geographic variation in SSD of A. macrophthalmus.},

   niches},
Journal = {ANIMAL},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {2},
Number = {5},
Pages = {661-668},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Analysis of 16S fibosomal RNA (rRNA)-encoding gene sequences from gut
   microbial ecosystems reveals bewildering genetic diversity. Some
   metabolic functions, such as glucose utilisation, are fairly widespread
   throughout the genetic spectrum. Others, however, are not. Despite so
   many phylotypes being present, single species or perhaps only two or
   three species often carry out key functions. Among ruminal bacteria,
   only three species can break down highly structured cellulose, despite
   the prevalence and importance of cellulose in ruminant diets, and one of
   those species, Fibrobacter succinogenes, is distantly related to the
   most abundant ruminal species. Fatty acid biohydrogenation in the rumen,
   particularly the final step of biohydrogenation of C18 fatty acids,
   stearate formation, is achieved only by a small sub-group of bacteria
   related to Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. Individuals who lack Oxalobacter
   formigenes fail to metabolise oxalate and suffer kidney stones composed
   of calcium oxalate. Perhaps the most celebrated example of the
   difference a single species can make is the `mimosine story' in
   ruminants. Mimosine is a toxic amino acid found in the leguminous plant,
   Leucaena leucocephala. Mimosine can cause thyroid problems by being
   converted to the goitrogen, 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone, in the rumen.
   Observations that mimosine-containing plants were toxic to ruminants in
   some countries but not others led to the discovery of Synergistes
   jonesii, which metabolises 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone and protects animals
   from toxicity Thus, despite the complexities indicated by molecular
   microbial ecology and genomics, it should never be forgotten that gut
   communities contain important metabolic niches inhabited by species with
   highly specific metabolic capability.},

Abstract = {A screening study was conducted to investigate the nutrient composition,
   anti-nutritional factors, in vitro gas (GP) and methane (CH4) production
   of leaves and whole pods in tropical multipurpose trees (MPTs). The
   results indicated that the highest CP (296g/kg DM) was found in Moringa
   stenopetala leaves followed by Acacia abysinica (277g/kg DM), Millettia
   ferruginea (264g/kg DM), Prosopis juliflora (261g/kg DM) and Moringa
   oleifera (256g/kg DM). In whole pods, the CP ranged from 172 in M.
   ferruginea to 191g/kg DM in M. stenopetala. The starch in M.
   stenopetala, P. juliflora and Chamaecytisus palmensis leaves was 44.2,
   28.8 and 24.4g/kg DM, respectively. Leaves of Cajanus cajan had the
   highest concentrations of valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine,
   lysine and threonine. The highest concentration of total and tannin
   phenols were observed in leaves of A. nilotica while P. juliflora leaves
   had the lowest. Leaves of M. oleifera had higher total phenols and
   soluble condensed tannins than those of M. stenopetala. The in vitro GP
   were (P<0.05) higher in leaves of Moringa species, Sesbania sesban, C.
   palmensis and Leucaena leucocephala than other MPTs. The CH4 production
   in A. nilotica, P. juliflora and C. cajan leaves was 1.05, -1.16 and
   1.79ml/200mg DM, respectively and were lower (P<0.05) than other MPTs.
   The lowest CH4 was observed in M. ferruginea pods (2.64ml/200mg DM)
   being (P<0.05) different from other species. In conclusion, leaves of A.
   nilotica, P. juliflora, C. cajan and pods of M. ferruginea were
   identified as potential candidates in mitigating CH4 production and

Abstract = {1. Studies have shown that fruits of plants from the Fabaceae family
   harbour a diverse community of herbivorous insects and their natural
   enemies. Despite this observation, we still lack information on the
   specific interactions within these multi-trophic communities. Herein, we
   describe the food web of insects associated with fruits and seeds of
   Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae), an invasive plant in Brazil, and their
   relationship with plant traits including seed biomass.2. We found 17
   species of insects distributed across three trophic levels. The main
   herbivore species sampled was Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus
   (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae), which was responsible for most
   of the seed predation and associated with the highest parasitoid
   biodiversity (N = 10 species). Four other herbivorous species were lower
   in abundance, including a previously unreported Lepidopteran species
   with two parasitoids and one hyperparasitoid associated with it.3. Seeds
   with more mass promoted an increase in insect abundance, insect species
   richness, and the number of links and connectivity. We observed two
   native parasitoid species, Paracrias pluteus and Stenocorse
   suldamericanos, shift from herbivores on native plants to herbivores on
   the invasive L. leucocephala, consistent with a potential host shift.
   However, more investigation is required to ascertain the effects of
   recent shifts of native insect communities (on native plants) to
   non-native ones and their consequences on plant fitness. Our study
   contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of communities and food
   webs in unknown systems, specifically in fruits of an invasive plant,
   and provides information about the influence of different plant traits
   on these communities.},

Abstract = {Three terrestrial leaf meals, Carica papaya, Leucaena leucocephala,
   Moringa oliefera and a freshwater aquatic fern, Azolla pinnata were
   evaluated as potential ingredients for farmed abalone diet. All diets
   were formulated to contain 27\% crude protein, 13\% of which was
   contributed by the various leaf meals. Fresh seaweed Gracilariopsis
   bailinae served as the control feed. juvenile Haliotis asinina (mean
   body weight = 13.4 +/- 1.6 g, mean shell length = 38.8 +/- 1.4 mm) were
   fed the diets at 2-39\% of the body weight day(-1). Seaweed was given at
   30\% of body weight day(-1). After 120 days of feeding, abalone fed M.
   oliefera, A. pinnata-based diets, and fresh G. bailinae had
   significantly higher (P < 0.01) specific growth rates (SGR\%) than
   abalone fed the L. leucocephala-based diet. Abalone fed the M.
   oliefera-based diet had a better growth rate in terms of shell length (P
   < 0.05) compared with those fed the L. leucocephala-based diet but not
   with those in other treatments. Furthermore. protein productive value
   (PPV) of H. asinina was significantly higher when fed the M.
   oliefera-based diet compared with all other treatments (P < 0.002).
   Survival was generally high (80-100\%) with no significant differences
   among treatments. Abalone fed the M. oliefera-based diet showed
   significantly higher carcass protein (70\% dry weight) and lipid (5\%)
   than the other treatments. Moringa oliefera leaf meal and freshwater
   aquatic fern (A. pinnata) are promising alternative feed ingredients for
   practical diet for farmed abalone as these are locally available
   year-round in the Philippines.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Two experiments, namely the situ nylon bag technique and the in vitro
   gas production technique, were carried out to determine the correlations
   between the in situ ruminal degradability and the in vitro gas
   production of different forages, and to predict the ruminal
   degradability of the forages using the gas production parameters. Forage
   samples from Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), Guinea grass (Panicum
   maximum), Para grass (Brachiaria mutica), Leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala), Rain tree (Samanea saman), and Gliricidia (Gliricidia
   sepium) were incubated in the rumen of three rumen-cannulated buffaloes
   using the in situ nylon bag technique for 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h.
   The six forage samples were also subjected to the in vitro gas
   production analysis following the modified methods developed by Menke \&
   Steingass (1988), along with 30 other commonly used forages in the
   Philippines. Both experiments followed a randomized complete block
   design. Their dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), neutral detergent
   fiber (NDF), and crude protein (CP) degradation kinetics and effective
   degradability (ED) as well as the gas production parameters were then
   estimated. Results revealed that the ED of each nutrient was found to be
   moderately to strongly correlated with some of the gas production times
   and estimated gas parameters. The predictor models generated using the
   gas production parameters for the ED of DM, OM, and NDF were
   sufficiently strong (R-2 = 0.740, p value= 0.0002; R-2 = 0.659, p value=
   0.0009; and R-2 = 0.813, p value < 0.0001, respectively) while that of
   CP was only moderate (R-2 = 0.500, p value= 0.0055). It was concluded
   that the relationship between the two techniques is sufficiently strong
   and therefore the gas production parameters can be used to predict the
   in situ ruminal nutrient degradability of forages.},

Abstract = {As for some temperate forage, some tropical tanniniferous plants (TTP)
   from browsing might represent an alternative to chemical anthelmintic.
   The anthelmintic effect of four TTP (Acacia pennatula, Lysiloma
   latisiliquum, Piscidia piscipula, Leucaena leucocephala) on Haemonchus
   contortus was measured using two in vitro assays. First, the effects of
   increasing concentrations of lyophilized extracts (150, 300, 600, 1200
   mu g/ml PBS) were tested on H. contortus larvae (L-3) using the larval
   migration inhibition (LMI) test. An inhibitor of tannin, polyvinyl
   polypyrrolidone (PVPP), was used to verify whether tannins were
   responsible for the AH effect. Secondly, the effects of extracts on
   larval exsheathment were examined. Larvae (L-3) were in contact with
   extracts (1200 mu g/ml) for 3 h, and then were exposed to an artificial
   exsheathment procedure with observations of the process at 10 min
   intervals. A general lineal model (GLM) test was used to determine the
   dose effect in the LMI test and the difference of the percentage of
   exsheathed larvae between the control and the treatment groups. A
   Kruskal Wallis test was used to determine the effect of PVPP on LMI
   results. The LMI test showed a dose-dependent anthelmintic effect for A.
   pennatula, L. latisiliquum and L. leucocephala (P < 0.01), which
   disappeared after PVPP addition, confirming the role of tannins. No
   effect was found for P. piscipula on H. contortus in the LMI test.
   However, all four plant extracts interfered with the process of L-3
   exsheathment which might be involved as a mechanism of action of tannins
   on H. contortus larvae. A. pennatula, L. latisiliquum and L.
   leucocephala could be used as an anthelmintic for the control of H.
   contortus after confirmation based on in vivo studies. (c) 2008 Elsevier

Title = {Evaluation of a silvopastoral system in a bovine pre-fattening unit},
Journal = {AGRISOST},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP-DEC},
Abstract = {Context: The productivity of bovine production systems has tended to
   decrease, as a consequence of climate change, forecasts indicate that
   rainfall should be reduced by 60\%, so the use of leguminous trees is a
   way to improve supply and quality of food.
   Objective: To evaluate the behavior of a silvo-pastoral system in
   rotational grazing of association of grasses plus legumes (L.
   leucocephala) and forages (Pennisetum purpureun cv. CT 169 and Sacharum
   Oficinarum) in a bovine pre-fattening unit.
   Methods: It was carried out in a Credit and Services Cooperative
   supported on a grayish-brown soil, a random block design was applied,
   with an average weight of 232 kg for treatment A (25 animals) and 236 kg
   for treatment B (25 animals), the breed used was a mixed Holstein-Zebu,
   the animals were weighed at 90 days and at 212 days, the evaluations
   were made during the dry season, the statistical package SSPS version
   15.1 was used. An economic valuation was carried out at the end of the
   experiment with the following evaluation criteria: Animal purchase
   expense, Salary expense, Sale price, Production value, Profit,
   Profitability.
   Results: Acceptable conversions and good live weight gains were
   obtained, especially in treatment B, which was 516 g / day on average
   throughout the experiment. The productive economic results in the
   silvo-pastoral system were higher than those obtained in the traditional
   system, with a profitability of 23.32\% higher than that obtained in the
   traditional system.
   Conclusions: Silvopastoral systems are an alternative for pre-fattening,
   with low inputs, which allows obtaining gains of more than 500g / d when
   compared with the traditional system.},

Abstract = {Iron mining is an important activity for the world's economy; however,
   it raises environmental concerns associated with difficulties in
   revegetating mine tailings. The addition of amendments and the right
   choice of plant species have been assumed to be important steps in
   promoting plant growth in degraded lands. This study was carried out to
   evaluate the potential of organic waste from shrimp farms to amend mine
   tailings and thereby improve both plant growth and nutrient
   accumulation. An experiment was set up in randomised blocks with a 5 x 3
   factorial scheme and four replicates. The treatments featured five
   different quantities of organic waste (0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 Mg ha(-1)) and
   three plant species (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth, Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and Mimosa hostilis Benth). Seedlings were
   grown for 90 days in pots filled with mine tailings mixed with organic
   waste. Above- and belowground dry matter and macro- and micronutrient
   accumulation were evaluated. Low levels of aboveground dry matter and
   higher root/ shoot ratios were observed in L. leucocephala, which also
   presented low above ground Na accumulation. An increase in plant dry
   matter was observed with the addition of 12 Mg ha(-1) of organic waste,
   whereas an increase in N accumulation was observed with the addition of
   8 Mg ha(-1) of organic waste. The relative magnitudes of aboveground
   macro- and micronutrient accumulations were N > Ca > K > Mg > P and Fe >
   Mn > Zn > Cu, respectively. The relative magnitudes of belowground
   macroand micronutrient accumulations were N > K > Ca > Mg > P and Mn >
   Fe > Zn > Cu, respectively. The species with the best potential to
   stimulate nutrient cycling and salt extraction were M. caesalpiniaefolia
   and M. hostilis, whereas L. leucocephala presented the best adaptation
   to drought conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

   supplementation.
   Supplementation progressively increased rumen ammonia-nitrogen
   concentrations in steers and the rate of rumen degradation of napier
   grass increased when leucaena (diets LL and LH) teas offered. The
   results suggest that supplementation of napier grass with leucaena
   increased DM intake owing to increased ammonia concentrations and rates
   of napier degradation in the rumen. Supplementation of the forage diet
   with I kg DM maize bl an did not significantly reduce the rumen
   degradation of napier grass and increased the molar proportions of
   propionate which may have increased the efficiency of utilization of

Abstract = {A lack of feed resources has been identified as the major constraint in
   ruminant livestock production in the tropics. Although forages, such as
   grasses, legumes and tree forages and the agro-industrial by-products,
   such as palm kernel cake, are available in abundance, their utilisation
   as animal feeds are limited due to the presence of dietary factors which
   may affect the voluntary intake and the entero-hepatic function of the
   animals. These dietary factors include saponins and copper in the palm
   kernel cake, mimosine and tannin in the tree legume (Leucaena
   leucocephala), sapogenins (epi-sarsasapogenin and epi-smilagenin) in the
   Signal grass (Brachiaria decumbens) and indospicine in the creeping
   indigo (Indigofera spicata). Great economic losses through general
   unthriftiness, poor weight gain, inefficient production and death have
   been attributed to these dietary factors. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {Fifteen multipurpose tree species native and introduced to the matorral

   microtheca, Leucaena leucocephala (exotic species) and Parkinsonia
   aculeata (native species) performed best while Prosopis glandulosa,
   Helietta parvifolia and Acacia rigidula (native species) did not
   establish well due to biotic problems which arose under plantation
   conditions. Acacia farnesiana, A. wrightii and two Pithecellobium spp.
   (native species) showed high yields which is of great interest since
   their multipurpose potential is the best of all fifteen species. These
   species could be of great importance in rehabilitating badly degraded
   parts of the matorral before such areas deteriorate to an irreversible
   desertified condition.},

   (p<0.0001) followed by L. leucocephala, G.ulmifolia and B. simaruba
   which were eaten in similar amounts. Digestibility was 60 and 61\% for
   G. ulmifolia and B. alicastrum and 80 and 81\% for B. simaruba and L.
   leucocephala. Short term preference of tree fodders was associated with
   their lignin content (p<0.05). It was concluded that white tailed deer
   tree fodder preference seems to be associated to fibrous material
   content and not with tannins. Brosimun alicastrum had the highest intake

Journal = {FERTILIZER RESEARCH},

Volume = {42},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {215-230},
Abstract = {The N-2-fixing potential (NFP) (i.e. the amount of fixed N-2 in a
   constraint-free environment) of N-2-fixing trees (NFTs) varies with the
   genotype. The NFP can be higher than 30-50 g N-2 fixed tree(-1) year(-1)
   in the most active species, be they leguminous trees such as Albizia
   lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala, or actinorhizal
   trees such as Casuarina equisetifolia. The actual amount of nitrogen
   fixed (ANF) (i.e. the amount of N-2 fixed in the field) is lower than
   the NFP or even nil because of various constraints, especially drought,
   nutrient deficiencies, excess of available N and pathogenic nematodes.
   As tree litters are mineralized, the amount of available N in the soil
   increases with time, this process leading to the cessation of N-2
   fixation in aging plantations. When the mineralization rate is slowed
   down or inhibited, N-2 fixation can continue. NFTs improve the N status
   of soils, but the transfer of fixed N to associated plants is not always
   ensured. Three main approaches are appropriate to increase N-2 fixation:
   clonal selection of trees combined with vegetative propagation,
   inoculation with effective rhizobium or Frankia strains, and proper
   fertilization (especially P). In the absence of major environmental
   constraints, a positive response to inoculation is expected only when
   specific (non-promiscuous) NFTs are grown in sites where the density of
   compatible rhizobia is low or nil. The potentialities of NFTs are far
   from being fully exploited. Further investigations are proposed and the
   economics of NET management is briefly discussed.},

Abstract = {The study examined the effect of protein-energy synchronization (PES)
   index-based rations on the rumen fermentation profile. The material used
   was the Jawa Randu goat's rumen fluid, collected soon after the goat was
   slaughtered. The treatment ration consisted of elephant grass, lamtoro (
   Leucaena leucocephala), coconut meal, tofu waste, bran, cassava waste,
   and mineral mix arranged based on the PES index of each feed ingredient.
   The research was conducted in vitro using a completely randomized design
   (CRD). The treatment consisted of 4 PES indexes, namely 0.55 (R1); 0.6
   (R2); 0.65 (R3); 0.7 (R4), and each had 5 replications. Data were
   analyzed by ANOVA and orthogonal polynomials (OP). The results of the
   ANOVA showed that the PES index did not affect the production of acetate
   (C2) and butyrate (C4) but had a highly significant effect on dry matter
   digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), pH, a total of
   volatile fatty acids (VFA), propionate (C3), C2:C3 ratio, methane (CH4),
   ammonia (NH3), and microbial protein synthesis (MPS). The analysis of OP
   showed a quadratic effect on all variables with the equation Y= -

   dan Y= -1012X(2)+1260X-311.64 (MPS). Protein-energy synchronization
   (PES) index of 0.6 achieved the best rumen fermentability. The
   formulation of the PES index-based ration of 0.6 had the most effective
   compared to other indexes based on the high of propionate, the lowest
   methane, the lowest NH3, and the best microbial protein synthesis. The
   ration with an index of 0.6 is composed of 30\% elephant grass, 30\%
   Leucaena leucocephala, 10\% coconut meal, 10\% tofu waste, 10\% rice
   brand, 9\% cassava waste, and 1\% mineral mix.},

Abstract = {We have explored a method to collect xylem sap using a Scholander
   pressure chamber for potted plants. Intact root system in pots which
   fitted the pressure chamber was pressurised at a pneumatic pressure
   numerically equal to the absolute value of shoot water potential. The
   rate of xylem flow obtained from the stem stump under such pressure was
   found similar to the rate of transpiration before detopping. The rate of
   pressurised flow from detopped roots was linearly related to the
   pressure applied in both well-watered and soil-dried plants. The osmotic
   concentration of the xylem sap was negatively related to the rate of
   volume flow, suggesting the necessity to collect xylem sap at in vivo
   flow rate if original solute concentration is to be evaluated. The
   concentration of ABA in the xylem sap, however, did not show such a
   relationship with water flux. Both well-watered and soil-dried plants
   showed the concentration of ABA in xylem sap largely stable with a range
   of volume how rate, indicating a linear relationship between the rate of
   ABA delivery through xylem and that of volume flow. We also compared the
   concentrations of ABA in xylem sap sequentially collected from
   pressurised roots with that from detached shoots of the same plants. The
   concentration of ABA in the initial saps from shoots showed to be
   similar to that from roots. However, a decrease in the concentration of
   ABA in the xylem sap collected from detached leaf or twig was observed
   when more volume of sap was collected, which might also be dependent on
   the plant species and the volume of xylem vessels concerned.},

   type recombinant cinnamoyl CoA reductase (Ll-CCRH1), a multitryptophan
   protein from Leucaena leucocephala and 10 different active site mutants

   showed highest affinity for feruloyl CoA (K (a) = 3.72 x 10(5) M-1) over
   other CoA esters and cinnamaldehydes, as determined by fluorescence
   spectroscopy. Quenching of the fluorescence by acrylamide for wild type
   and active site mutants was collisional with almost 100 \% of the
   tryptophan fluorescence accessible under native condition and remained
   same after denaturation of protein with 6 M GdnHCl. In wild type
   Ll-CCRH1, the extent of quenching achieved with iodide (f (a) = 1.0) was
   significantly higher than cesium ions (f (a) = 0.33) suggesting more
   density of positive charge around surface of trp conformers under native
   conditions. Denaturation of wild type protein with 6 M GdnHCl led to
   significant increase in the quenching with cesium (f (a) = 0.54),
   whereas quenching with iodide ion was decreased (f (a) = 0.78),
   indicating reorientation of charge density around trp from positive to
   negative and heterogeneity in trp environment. The Stern-Volmer plots
   for wild type and mutants Ll-CCRH1 under native and denatured
   conditions, with cesium ion yielded biphasic quenching profiles. The
   extent of quenching for cesium and iodide ions under native and
   denatured conditions observed in active site mutants was significantly
   different from wild type Ll-CCRH1 under the same conditions. Thus,
   single substitution type mutations of active site residues showed

Abstract = {I studied the foraging ecology and social behavior of the Bridled
   White-eye (Zosterops conspicillatus) on Saipan and Tinian, Mariana
   Islands. On Saipan, birds foraged in flocks of 10-40, and dominance
   relationships existed within flocks. The white-eye appeared socially
   subordinate to the other insectivorous passerines. Bridled White-eyes
   foraged principally on the outer crown of trees and shrubs, where they
   perched on relatively slender branches to glean invertebrates from leaf
   surfaces. They  foraged similarly in two habitats, but they used a wider
   range of perch sizes in limestone forest than in tangantangan (Leucaena
   leucocephala) thickets. Hence, absolute vegetation height was of little
   importance to this species. Bridled White-eyes were versatile in their
   foraging, which included every microenvironment from the ground to
   treetops. They used gleaning, probing, hovering, and sallying to feed on
   invertebrates, nectar, fruits, and seeds.},

Abstract = {Samples of foliage from multipurpose leguminous trees (MPT) which had
   been selected as potential feed supplements for ruminants were examined
   for their chemical composition and in situ degradation characteristics,
   and were compared with alfalfa (Medicago saliva) hay and teff
   (Eragrostis abyssinica) straw. Organic matter (OM), acid detergent fibre
   (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), nitrogen, neutral detergent
   nitrogen, acid detergent lignin (ADL), soluble phenolics, NDF-bound
   proanthocyanidins and in vitro digestibility were determined in Acacia
   angustissima, Chamaecytisus palmensis (Tagasaste), Leucaena
   leucocephala, two cultivars of Sesbania sesban and Vernonia amygdalina
   (bitter leaf). The MPT all had a nutrient content, particularly in terms
   of N (up to 39.5 g available N per kg dry matter (DM)) similar to
   alfalfa hay, which would be suitable for supplementing teff straw, which
   had a high fibre, but low N (4.0 g available N per kg DM) content. In
   situ nylon bag digestion and in vitro gas production analyses were
   carried out to assess microbial degradation characteristics. The MPT
   were highly degradable in situ, however gas production in vitro
   decreased as the MPT:teff straw ratio increased in A. angustissima,
   indicating that antimicrobial components were present in this species.
   None of the chemical estimations were correlated with antimicrobial
   properties. It is concluded that some of the MPT tested may prove to be
   useful dietary supplements for ruminants receiving poor quality forages
   like teff straw, as has been found in other studies. However, chemical
   analysis alone will be of limited value in predicting the nutritive
   value of a new MPT which contains antimicrobial components or material
   toxic to the animal itself. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Biological invasions are complex scale-dependent processes.
   Metacommunity ecology provides the means to understand the effects of
   invasive species (IS) because it explicitly considers how local and
   regional processes interact to drive the three main components of
   biodiversity: alpha, beta, and gamma. White-popinac (Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) is a widely distributed IS in regenerating
   forests in the Atlantic Forest (Brazil). White-popinac establishment
   results in a particular spatial occupancy as the species forms dense and
   homogeneous patches, instead of spreading individuals throughout invaded
   areas. Here we took advantage of this unique spatial configuration
   formed by fragments of native forest and their respective regenerating
   areas, partially occupied by patches of white-popinac, to investigate
   how local and regional dynamics of plant metacommunities and communities
   under natural regeneration are affected by white-popinac. We conducted
   replicated multi-strata surveys in 131 communities distributed among 29
   metacommunities of regenerating forests that had different ages of
   white-popinac invasion. We found (i) Mirrored responses among local and
   regional scales: at both scales, native species richness decreased with
   the increase of invasion age, whereas IS richness increased; and (ii)
   beta-diversity of native species decreased with the increase of invasion
   age, showing that time-advance of invasion led to a homogenizing effect.
   We also found evidence that the advance of white-popinac patches towards
   regenerating forests increases with time and proximity to the forest
   fragment, which likely had indirect effects on regenerating communities
   by reducing the size of the regenerating area. Our results indicate that
   the effects of white-popinac invasions on regenerating forests can be so
   vigorous that they propagate from the local to the regional scale, via a
   decrease in beta-diversity. We reinforce the importance of considering
   multiscale approaches on assessing effects of white-popinac invasions.},

Title = {Carbon Sequestration Potential of Commercial Agroforestry Systems in

   Systems},

Abstract = {Climate change, land degradation, and desertification lead to the loss
   of carbon present in the soil and plants. The carbon dioxide (CO2)
   concentration in the atmosphere has reached 412 ppm. This is a rise of
   47\% since the start of the industrial period, when the concentration
   was close to 280 ppm. Therefore, the sequestration of carbon from the
   atmosphere to earth is the need of the hour. Many scientists have
   suggested agroforestry as a potent instrument for climate change
   mitigation as well as to fetch lucrative benefits. The Indian government
   is also promulgating tree-based systems for increasing tree cover up to
   33\% of the total geographical area to mitigate climate change.
   Therefore, the expansion of the commercial agroforestry system of
   fast-growing tree species producing higher biomass could be a
   sustainable and ecologically benign technique to sequester carbon,
   increase green cover, and improve the financial status of farmers. This
   review highlights the commercial agroforestry systems, biomass and
   carbon sequestration potential, and case studies of poplar and
   eucalyptus. The species such as poplar (Populus deltoides), nilgiri
   (Eucalyptus spp.), subabul (Leucaena leucocephala), tree of heaven
   (Ailanthus excelsa), willow (Salix spp.), malabar neem (Melia dubia),
   cadamba (Neolamarckia cadamba), and white teak (Gmelina arborea) are the
   suitable tree species for carbon sequestration under agroforestry. Among
   these species, poplar and eucalyptus are major agroforestry tree species
   that have been adopted by millions of farmers in India since the 1990s.
   Indo-Gangetic plains are considered the birthplace of commercial or
   industrial agroforestry, as poplar and eucalyptus are widely planted.
   This review reports that poplar and eucalyptus have the potential to
   sequester carbon stock of 212.7 Mg C ha(-1) and 237.2 Mg C ha(-1),
   respectively. Further, the net carbon sequestration rate in poplar and
   eucalyptus was 10.3 and 12.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. In
   conclusion, the commercial agroforestry system was very successful in
   the Indo-Gangetic regions of the country but needs further expansion
   with suitable compatible crops in different parts of the country.},

Abstract = {The mining industry in the copper belt region of Africa was initiated in
   the early 1900s, with copper being the main ore extracted to date. The
   main objectives of the present study are (1) to characterize the
   microbial structure, abundance, and diversity in different ecological
   conditions in the cupriferous city of Lubumbashi and (2) to assess the
   metal phytoextraction potential of Leucaena leucocephala, a main plant
   species used in tailing. Four ecologically different sites were
   selected. They include a residential area (site 1), an agricultural dry
   field (site 2), and an agricultural wetland (site 3), all located within
   the vicinity of a copper/cobalt mining plant. A remediated tailing was
   also added as a highly stressed area (site 4). As expected, the highest
   levels of copper and cobalt among the sites studied were found at the
   remediated tailing, with 9447 mg/kg and 2228 mg/kg for copper and
   cobalt, respectively. The levels of these metals at the other sites were
   low, varying from 41 mg/kg to 579 mg/kg for copper and from 4 mg/kg to
   110 mg/kg for cobalt. Interestingly, this study revealed that the
   Leucaena leucocephala grown on the remediated sites is a copper/cobalt
   excluder species as it accumulates soil bioavailable metals from the
   rhizosphere in its roots. Amplicon sequence analysis showed significant
   differences among the sites in bacterial and fungal composition and
   abundance. Site-specific genera were identified. Acidibacter was the
   most abundant bacterial genus in the residential and remediated tailing
   sites, with 11.1\% and 4.4\%, respectively. Bacillus was predominant in
   both dry (19.3\%) and wet agricultural lands (4.8\%). For fungi,
   Fusarium exhibited the highest proportion of the fungal genera at all
   the sites, with a relative abundance ranging from 15.6\% to 20.3\%.
   Shannon diversity entropy indices were high and similar, ranging from
   8.3 to 9 for bacteria and 7.0 and 7.4 for fungi. Beta diversity analysis
   confirmed the closeness of the four sites regardless of the
   environmental conditions. This lack of differences in the microbial
   community diversity and structures among the sites suggests microbial
   resilience and physiological adaptations.},

   the cropped treatment. The addition of an intercrop of peanut further
   reduced both runoff and sediment concentration in the runoff, thus
   leading to a substantial reduction in soil loss. The erodibility of a
   nearby different soil at low slope (10\%) was found to be high, but its
   erodibility appeared to be increased following cultivation.},

Abstract = {Mulching with vegetative materials is a highly beneficial and
   widely-investigated agro-technique in rainfed areas but the adoption of
   this practice has been constrained due to non-availability of mulch
   biomass locally. Live mulching with fast-growing annual green manure
   legumes like sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea) or prunings of Leucaena
   leucocephala grown as hedge rows can be done for moisture conservation
   as well as nutrient cycling in the maize-wheat cropping system, which is
   predominantly followed in the high rainfall sub-mountainous region of
   north-western India. A field experiment was conducted at Selakui,
   Dehradun during 2000-2004 to study the effect of legume mulching, viz.
   in situ grown sunnhemp and Leucaena prunings, along with varying N
   levels, viz. 0, 30, 60 and 90 kg N ha(-1) (to maize), and 0, 40 and 80
   kg N ha(-1) (to wheat) on productivity, soil moisture conservation and
   soil physico-chemical properties. Intercropped sunnhemp added 0.75-1.45
   t dry matter and 21.6-41.3 kg N ha(-1) at 30-35 days, while Leucaena
   twigs added 1.89-4.15 t dry matter and 75.2-161.3 kg N ha(-1) at 60-65
   days of maize growth. Live mulching with sunnhemp or Leucaena biomass
   improved soil moisture content at maize harvest (+1.15-1.57\%) and crop
   productivity by 6.8-8.8\% over no mulching. Combined use of both the
   mulching materials was more effective in improving the soil moisture
   content (+2.08-2.29\%) and grain yield (15.1\%) over their single
   application. Response of maize to N fertilizer application was
   significant up to 90 kg N ha(-1), and it was relatively more pronounced
   under the mulching treatments. Residual effect of mulching on wheat
   showed an increase in yield of 10.2\% with sunnhemp or Leucaena, and
   27.9\% with sunnhemp + Leucaena. There was an improvement in organic C
   and total N status of soil, and a decrease in bulk density associated
   with an increase in infiltration rate due to mulching at the end of 4
   cropping cycles. It was concluded that legume mulching is a highly
   beneficial practice for enhanced moisture and nutrient conservation,
   leading to increased productivity and soil health of maize-wheat
   cropping system under Doon valley conditions of north-western India.},

Abstract = {Alley cropping systems have been developed primarily as an alternative
   to traditional slash and burn/bush fallow farming systems in the
   tropics. The goal is to improve long-term soil fertility and
   productivity, thereby sustaining crop production levels. While these
   systems have benefited most agronomic crops, their application to high
   value horticultural crops such as vegetables, herbs and fruits has not
   been studied extensively. As a technology, alley cropping has both
   negative and positive effects depending on crop and tree species,
   cropping pattern, soil type, climate and other ecological factors.
   Studies in the humid tropics of West Africa indicated that with
   fertilizer application, yield of vegetables such as pai-tsai (Brassica
   chinensis), amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus), celosia (Celosia argentia),
   okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) grown
   in alley cropping systems with nitrogen fixing leguminous tree (Leucaena
   leucocephala Lam de Wit) were similar to yield in control plots (without
   alley cropping). With no fertilizer applied, yield of alley-cropped
   vegetables was higher than the control. Yield of vegetable crops
   responded more to fertilizer in control plots than in alley-crop plots
   indicating that alley cropping can reduce fertilizer requirement for
   vegetable production. In the semi-arid tropics of eastern Caribbean,
   alley cropping vegetable crops such as bell pepper (Capsicum annuum),
   eggplant (Solanum melongena) and sweet corn (Zea mays) with pigeonpea
   (Cajanus cajan), Moringa (Moringa oleifera), Gliricida (Gliricidia
   sepium) and Leucaena indicated both negative and positive effects. The
   presence of hedgerows in alley cropping resulted in reduced
   evapotranspiration, lower wind turbulence, slightly higher soil
   moisture, and lower surface soil temperature. In spite of supplemental
   drip irrigation, yields of vegetable crops were reduced in alley
   cropping systems. Alley cropping with pigeonpea reduced bell pepper
   yield by 50 to 60 percent, mainly the result of partial shading and
   reduced pepper growth due to inhibitory effect of pigeonpea residues.
   Alley cropping had no significant and beneficial effect on sweet corn
   yield during the establishment period. Marketable yield decreased 40 to
   60 percent and Moringa hedgerows significantly reduced yield by 55 to 60
   percent. Leucaena and pigeonpea had lower (17 to 20 percent) yield
   reducing effect on eggplant. For both crops (sweet corn and eggplant),
   plant height, yield and dry matter decreased as distance of rows to
   hedgerows decreased. Alley cropping with Leucaena maintained relatively
   higher soil moisture than with other species. Among the hedgerow
   species, Moringa and Gliricidia were more competitive than Leucaena and
   pigeonpea in terms of their effects on plant height, yield, and dry
   matter. Leucaena and Moringa exhibited the fastest regrowth after
   pruning and produced the highest total biomass. In terms of total
   nutrient contribution, Leucaena and Gliricidia produced the highest NPK
   yield. Growth and yield of medicinal plants and culinary herbs varied
   according to species in both hedgerow and no hedgerow treatments.
   Lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) and blue verbena (Stachytarpheta
   jamaicensis) were the most productive traditional species in both
   treatments while culinary herbs basil, and sweet marjoram were more
   productive than other species. In general, yield of medicinal plants and
   herbs was reduced under hedgerow intercropping although competition for
   light and soil moisture was minimal.},

   and 24 h postfeeding on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 42. LLM was incubated
   for 24 h with SRL in vitro on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 41 to study
   mimosine and dihydroxypyridone (DHP) biodegradation. On day 43, 1-1.5 l
   of rumen liquor was transferred to another set of three unadapted calves
   which were fed 50\% LLM after transfer of inoculum. DM intake was
   1.78\%, 2.13\%, 2.27\%, 1.66\%, 1.54\% and 1.35\% of live weight during
   the Ist through 5th week, respectively. Both in vitro and in vivo
   studies showed extensive degradation of mimosine to 3,4 DHP and 2,3 DHP
   from first day of LLM feeding. The overall in vitro DHP degradation was
   nil, 28.6\%, 43.3\% and 40.1\% on day upto 15, 21, 28 and 42 of LLM
   feeding. No mimosine was found in serum on any day of sampling. The 3,4
   DHP detected (56.94+/-31.65 mu g ml(-1) serum) one hour post feeding on
   day 1 exhibited a decline from day 22 onwards. The serum also contained
   2,3 DHP on days 8, 15, 22, 42. The faecal and urinary excretion of 3,4
   DHP and 2,3 DHP as percent of mimosine intake declined from first week
   (76.3+/-2.8) to 4th week (42.1+/-4.1). The feeding of LLM resulted in
   reduced level of T-3 and T-4 within a week of LLM feeding. The level of
   T-3 improved to normal by 6th week while that of T-4 remained low. The
   SGOT and SGPT activities were within normal range. The gradual
   adaptation to LLM feeding caused Karan Fries calves to acquire DHP
   degrading ability to nontoxic compounds and this ability was transferred
   through transfer of rumen liquor from such calves to other unadapted
   calves at as early as 9th day of LLM feeding. The results revealed the
   possibility of two types of microbes degrading mimosine and 3,4 DHP to
   2,3 DHP. One type of 2,3 DHP degrading microbes may be inhibited in the
   presence of 3,4 DHP whereas the other type may be active. (C) 1998

Abstract = {A trial was conduced in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia,
   to examine the effect of various herbicide treatments on the
   establishment of Leucaena leucocephala var. Cunningham under irrigated
   conditions. The site was on Cununurra clay, pH 8 and was irrigated every
   2 weeks. The herbicide treatments which included pre-emergent
   applications of Treflan together with post-emergent applications of
   Basagran and Selectone were compared with hand weeding. While Treflan
   controlled grasses, this had no effect on leucaena survival. Basagran
   applied 32 days after sowing resulted in an increase in yield of
   leucaena at 50 days post sowing. However by 225 days post sowing no
   treatment had a significant effect on leucaena survival or yield. These
   results suggest that the presence of weeds and grasses does not affect
   the establishment of leucaena where moisture is not limiting.},

   activity, M. calabura and F. auriculata exhibited strong activity with
   no significant difference. The Pearson correlation indicated that the
   activities of M. caesia and F. auriculata contributed by phenolic
   compounds. A total of 65 metabolites were tentatively identified by
   using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass

   variation in nitrogenase activity was observed with a maximum in
   July-August while peak N-accretion was in September-October. N input
   through foliage litter accounted for 85-95\% of total litter N, of which
   90\% was released through decomposition in one year, whereas in Alnus
   only 60\% of the litter N was annually released. The contribution of
   biological N2 fixation to total N uptake was maximum in Casuarina (37\%)

Abstract = {This study examined the comparative nutrient utilization of indigenous

   supplemented with a concentrate based on either soybean meal (SBM) or
   Leucaena leucocephala-Morus alba-Azadirachta indica (2:1:1) leaf meal
   mixture (LMAM) prior to conception (pre-gestation), and during gestation
   (n = 8) in a completely randomized design. Concentrate represented 42\%
   and 72\% of DM in diet before and during pregnancy, respectively.
   Therefore, the plane of nutrition and nutrient density in terms of
   digestible CP and TDN of composite diets offered to does during late
   gestation were significantly higher relative to non-pregnant does.
   Intake of DM was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in does during late
   gestation as compared to their intake during pre-gestation. The
   digestibility of nutrients and N balance data were comparable (P > 0.05)
   among goats irrespective of dietary supplements. However, does in late
   gestation had higher (P < 0.001) nutrient digestibility of DM, OM, and
   CP and lower digestibility of NDF, ADF, and cellulose as compared to
   non-pregnant does due to higher dietary ratio of concentrate. Similarly,
   pregnant does had significantly higher (P < 0.001) intake, excretion and
   retention of N during late gestation irrespective of diets. The
   nutritive value of composite diets and plane of nutrition of does were
   similar (P > 0.05) irrespective of dietary treatments. Apparently, the
   supplementation of wheat straw either with LMAM or commercial type
   concentrate containing soybean meal resulted in similar performance of
   does; the leaf meal mixture could contribute up to 36\% of the total DMI
   in gravid does without any adverse effect on their general health and
   reproductive performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The concentration and molecular weights (MW) of condensed tannins (CT)
   of three locally available tropical plant species leaves which have
   potential to be used as ruminant feed, and their effects on in vitro
   gas, including methane, production were investigated. Leaves of three
   plant species, namely, leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), cassava
   (Manihot esculenta, Cranzt), and Siamese neem (Azadirachta indica
   A.Juss. var. Siamensis Valeton) were used in the present study. CT
   contents ranged from 1.2\% in the leucaena to 5.0\% in Siamese neem. The
   weight-average molecular weights (M-w) of the purified CTs, determined
   using gel-permeation chromatography, were 3222, 3409 and 3612 Da for
   leucaena, cassava and Siamese neem respectively. The above values were
   within the range reported for CTs of various tropical plant species. We
   know of no published data on MW of CTs from leaves of cassava and
   Siamese neem and, thus, this research, for the first time, reported the
   MWs of the above two plant materials. Subsequently, two CT extracts with
   differing MWs, such as CTs extracted from leaves of Siamese neem and
   leaves of leucaena, were selected as the representative of high and low
   MWs of CT respectively, and used for investigation of the effect of the
   MW of CT on in vitro gas production and fermentation parameters.
   Supplementation of CTs of a higher MW extracted from leaves of Siamese
   neem (at 2-6 mg/100 mg DM) significantly inhibited in vitro total gas
   and methane production, while supplementation of CTs with a lower MW
   extracted from leaves of leucaena had no effect, except for total gas
   production at the highest level (6 mg/100 mg DM) of supplementation.
   Similarly, CT from Siamese neem leaves had a stronger inhibitory effect
   (P < 0.001) on in vitro volatile fatty acid, acetic acid and butyric
   acid production. The above results indicated that concentrations and the
   MW of CT varied among the plant species; in addition, the efficacy of
   CTs to inhibit ruminal CH4 emission are influenced by their MW.},

Abstract = {Three tropical legumes, namely Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania sesban
   and Cajanus cajan, were subjected to chemical analysis plus in vitro, in
   situ and in vivo evaluations. Three different assays were used to
   determine total tannins: adsorption to polyvinyl pyrrolidine
   (PVPP-tannins), radial diffusion (RD-tannins) and protein precipitation
   capacity (BSA-tannins). Total phenols, total tannins and condensed
   tannins were highest for Sesbania. RD-tannins were correlated with total
   phenols (r(2) = 0.93), PVPP-tannins (r(2) = 0.92) and condensed tannins
   (r(2) = 0.99). The protein precipitation capacity of Sesbania, Leucaena
   and Cajanus were 25.9, 6.13 and 4.05 mu g BSA/g DM, respectively.
   Gas production at 24h was negatively correlated with total phenols (r(2)
   = 0.99), PVPP-tannins (r(2) = 0.99) and condensed tannins (r(2) = 0.91).
   The RD-, PVPP-tannins and the response to polyethylene glycol (PEG) in
   the gas production assay appeared to be useful as a first screen for
   tannins.
   In situ degradability did not reflect any adverse effects of tannins.
   However, in vivo experiments showed that the apparent DM digestibility
   of Sesbania and Leucaena was lower than the basal diet. The apparent
   protein digestibility was lower for all legumes compared to the basal
   diet. Most treatments caused a negative nitrogen balance. The problems
   associated with browse feeding were not only related to tannin contents,
   other factors such as inherently poor digestibility and low energy
   intake may also have lead to the poor animal performance on these diets.
   We propose, given the limitations of current tannin assays, that it is
   not possible to predict beneficial or harmful nutritional effects from
   total tannin concentrations per se. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The present trial aimed at comparing the sensitivity of two in vitro
   methods, i.e. the larval migration inhibition assay (LMIA) and the
   larval exsheathment inhibition assay (LEIA), to evaluate the
   anthelmintic (AH) properties of tannin-rich plant extracts against
   Haemonchus contortus infective larvae. The two assays were applied on
   the same batch of H. contortus infective larvae exposed to
   water/acetonic extracts obtained from four tropical plants with
   different tannin contents: Acacia gaumeri, Brosimum alicastrum, Havardia
   albicans and Leucaena leucocephala. Increasing concentrations (0, 75,
   150, 300, 600, 1200 mu g/ml PBS) of lyophilized extracts were used in
   both in vitro assays. A general lineal model test was used to determine
   the dose-effect in the LMIA or the difference in the percentage of
   exsheathed larvae between the respective control and treated groups. The
   LMIA showed a dose-dependent AH effect for H. albicans (P < 0.001) and
   A. gaumeri (P < 0.05), but not for L. leucocephala and B. alicastrum. In
   contrast, the exsheathment process was significantly affected by all
   doses of H. albicans and A. gaumeri extracts and a significant
   dose-dependent effect was found for B. alicastrum and L. leucocephala.
   Calculation of lethal dose (LD) was possible with LEIA using B.
   alicastrum and L leucocephala but not with H. albicans and A. gaumeri as
   the lowest tested concentration was achieving more than 50\% inhibition.
   Calculation of LD with the LMIA results was not feasible. These results
   suggest that tannin-rich plant extracts are more potent inhibitors of
   the exsheathment of H. contortus L-3 larvae than their motility. This
   information underlines the difference of sensitivity between
   methodological procedures to evaluate the AH properties of plant
   extracts on the same nematode stage. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {The potential influence of plant-based feed supplements on sperm

Journal = {ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {132},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The reproductive performance of male livestock is of economic
   importance, and improving semen quantity and quality, especially for
   artificial insemination, additionally helps to avoid the loss of
   valuable genotypes. The review focuses on the impact of oxidative stress
   on sperm production and quality in livestock, and the potential role of
   plant based anti-oxidants to control this impact. From scientific
   reports dealing with livestock, the paper compiles evidence on effective
   dietary measures affecting sperm production and quality. Where little or
   no data are available on livestock, it refers to sources regarding other
   mammals, including man. The review concentrates on the use of distinct
   plants as feed supplements rather than on ways to treat deficiencies and
   imbalances in energy or macro- and micronutrients. Feeding of maca
   (Lepidium meyenii) and khat (Catha edulis) has been shown to positively
   affect sperm production and quality in animals. Some evidence points to
   favourable effects of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena
   pallida), sesbania (Sesbania sesban), pomegranate (Punica granatum),
   tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus)
   as well, but studies are either superficial or results are partially
   contradictory. Finally, the review considers the potential usefulness of
   medicinal herbs. The list of such plants includes Chinese herbs such as
   Lycium barbarum, Astralagus membranaceus, Acanthopanacis senticosi,
   Magnolia officinalis, Corn us officinalis and Psoralea corylifolia and
   the Indonesian plant Eurycoma longifolia. European candidate plants are
   Tribulus terrestris and Pendulum murex. Future research should include
   the screening of other plants, concentrating on the large number of
   plants rich in metabolites because of their presumed effectiveness. The
   modes of action often require clarification for the plants with
   demonstrated effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   diversifolia K156, a L. diversifolia x L, leucocephala hybrid, a L.
   pallida x L. leucocephala hybrid, and a L. pallida mixture. The three L.
   leucocephala accessions had the highest dry matter production, and also
   the highest crude protein content and rumen digestibility of dry matter
   and protein. They also suffered more psyllid damage than the other
   entries. L. diversifolia K156 and the L. pallida mixture had the least
   psyllid damage. It is concluded that, although the L. leucocephala

   VAM activity. Individual subleaflets (pinnules) are regularly removed
   from the plant, dried and their P contents determined colorimetrically.
   P contents monitored by this technique were linearly related to shoot P
   contents (r = 0.97). The technique was useful for evaluating the
   influence of propagule density on VAM activity, for separating soils
   into categories of VAM effectiveness and for assessing the effects of
   soil biotic factors on VAM activity. The technique is a simple but

Abstract = {The biophysical performance of hedgerow intercropping for soil fertility
   improvement was assessed in a farmer-participatory trial in western
   Kenya over three years. Farmers successfully established dense hedgerows
   (median 6680 trees ha(-1) on plots of 790 m2, but annual yields of
   hedgerow prunings of Leucaena leucocephala and Calliandra calothyrsus
   (1-4 t ha(-1)), were low compared to potentials in the region (4-8 t
   ha(-1)). The hedgerows reduced slopes from 7.2 to 4.5\% within alleys (p
   < 0.01) but had no effect on grain yield over five seasons. Little of
   the variation in grain yield between hedgerow plots and control plots
   without hedgerows (adjusted r(2) = 11\%) and among control plots
   (adjusted r(2) = 29\%) could be accounted for by linear regression with
   measured agronomic and socio-economic variables. Fully
   researcher-managed trials are recommended for agronomic evaluation of
   complex agroforestry technologies.},

   compared to those of two introduced shrubs, Leucaena leucocephala and
   Gliricidia sepium. Gliricidia sepium achieved the greatest height and
   produced the highest herbage dry matter (2 t/ha) compared to average
   production of 0.15 t/ha by the three other species. Gliricidia sepium
   herbage also had high contents of crude protein, calcium and ash. In
   regrowth herbage production at cutting intervals of 6 and 12 weeks,
   Gliricidia sepium again outperformed the three other species, however,
   there was little difference in herbage yield among the three other

Abstract = {In this study, the in vitro apparent rumen degradability of organic
   matter (ARDOM) and plant secondary metabolites (ARDPSM) of three
   tropical legumes (Mucuna pruriens, Canavalia ensiformis, and Leucaena
   leucocephala) were assessed. For this, 3 experiments were set up, i.e.,
   single end-point incubations (24 h) with ruminal inoculum from either
   Belgian or Cuban sheep, as well as kinetic assessments (0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6
   h, 8 h, 10 h, 12 h, and 24 h) inoculum from Belgian sheep. L-mimosine,
   L-canavanine, Concanavalin A (Con A), and trypsin inhibitor (TI) were
   the plant secondary metabolites (PSM) targeted in this study. In all
   three experiments, both beans, as well as forage/bean meals of M.
   pruriens and C. ensiformis and their PSM, were extensively degraded
   during 24 h incubation, irrespective of the inoculum source (0.44 to
   0.70 and 0.43 to 0.78 g/g of organic matter (OM) for ARDOM,
   respectively, and > 0.80 g/g for L-canavanine, > 0.76 TIU/TIU for TI,
   and > 0.95 g/g for Con A, for both legumes). Forage meal of L.
   leucocephala was considerably less degraded, with apparent ruminal
   degradabilities of 0.20 g/g OM and 0.35 g/g OM after 24 h incubation
   with Belgian or Cuban sheep inoculum, respectively. This could - at
   least partially - be related to L-mimosine, present in L. leucocephala,
   which was hardly degraded in the Belgian incubation, while a more
   extensive ruminal breakdown was observed under the Cuban conditions
   (0.05 g/g PSM vs. 0.78 g/g PSM, respectively). The negative effect of
   L-mimosine on OM degradability was supported in an additional in vitro
   experiment with straw and inoculum from Belgian sheep, as ruminal
   degradation of straw was 31\% lower when pure L-mimosine was
   supplemented.},

Abstract = {The threat of fire is always a consideration when establishing a forest

   established dry forest restoration project in Puerto Rico. The original
   goal of the project was to determine differential growth responses of
   native trees under the nurse tree Leucaena leucocephala versus in open
   sites. Tree species growth, mortality and response to the fires were
   evaluated according to their leaf habit, successional status, and
   prefire tolerance to environmental conditions. Results showed that
   regardless of a species' leaf habit and successional status, trees
   attained greater height and lower mortality under nurse trees. In open
   sites, sprouting was the most common fire response and mature-forest and
   evergreen species had greater postfire survival than pioneers and
   deciduous species. Although nurse trees are typically used to help
   manage nutrient or light environments in reforestation projects, these
   trees also appear to provide a secondary benefit of limiting fire damage

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala, a tropical leguminous shrub, contains a toxic

   forage depends on colonization of the rumen by bacteria that degrade
   dihydroxypyridines (DHP), which are toxic intermediates in the
   metabolism of mimosine. Populations in the rumina of animals in some
   parts of the world, however, do not include bacteria that are able to
   carry out this degradation. We thus describe tests for the presence of
   DHP degraders in ruminal populations that are based on degradation
   (loss) of DHP compounds from culture media. Results obtained with the
   tests indicate that DHP degraders were not part of microbial populations
   in the rumina of cattle, sheep, and goats in Iowa (USA), while most
   rumen samples examined from animals from the Virgin Islands and Haiti
   contained DHP degraders. These results confirm and extend the findings
   of others about geographic limits to the distribution of these important

   interdependence was found between faecal fresh material output and WHC
   (p<0.001, R-2 = 0.896). It could be suggested that a moderate increase

Abstract = {Recent results in both plant biochemistry and animal metabolism
   emphasize that, in any research on the nutritional applications of

   mimosine analysis can only be performed by the traditional colorimetric
   method, it should be combined with paper chromatography to estimate
   ratios of mimosine and 3,4-DHP. However high performance liquid
   chromatography provides vastly improved methods for simultaneously and
   precisely analysing both compounds. Published methods are reviewed and a
   new ion exchange method is described which has been used for the rapid
   routine analysis of a large number of samples. The chromatographic

Abstract = {Overabundant ungulate populations can alter forests. Concurrently,
   global declines of seed dispersers may threaten native forest structure
   and function. On an island largely devoid of native vertebrate seed
   dispersers, we monitored forest succession for 7 years following
   ungulate exclusion from a 5-ha area and adjacent plots with ungulates
   still present. We observed succession from open scrub to forest and
   understory cover by non-native plants declined. Two trees, native
   Hibiscus tiliaceus and non-native Leucaena leucocephala, accounted for
   most forest regeneration, with the latter dominant. Neither species is
   dependent on animal dispersers nor was there strong evidence that plants
   dependent on dispersers migrated into the 5-ha study area. Passive
   restoration following ungulate removal may facilitate restoration, but
   did not show promise for fully restoring native forest on Guam.
   Restoration of native forest plants in bird depopulated areas will
   likely require active outplanting of native seedlings, control of
   factors resulting in bird loss, and reintroduction of seed dispersers.},

Abstract = {The high cost of conventional fossil fuels has resulted in a rise in the
   demand for charcoal in developing countries. There has been a problem of
   wood scarcity and indigenous tree species are being replaced with the
   fast-growing, short-rotation species. Three short-rotation tree species:
   Gliricidia sepium, Leucaenea leucocephala and Gmelina arborea were
   converted to charcoal by a pyrolytic process. The effects of final
   carbonisation temperature on the yield, heating value and proximate
   analysis of charcoal from the tree species were determined. Gliricidia
   sepium gave the highest charcoal yield of 51.6\% with a gross heating
   value of 31.45 MJ/kg at 300 degrees C final carbonisation temperature.
   There was no significant difference in the charcoal yield of Gmelina
   arborea and Leucaena leucocephala at 5\% level of testing. The charcoal
   yield decreased with an increase in carbonisation temperature. The
   percentage volatiles in charcoal decreased with an increase in
   temperature, while there was an increase in the percentage fixed carbon.

Title = {Alley cropping in the moist savanna of West-Africa - III. Soil organic
   matter fractionation and soil productivity},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {245-264},
Abstract = {In cropping systems with limited amounts of external inputs, the soil
   organic matter pool (SOM) may contribute significantly to plant
   nutrition. The impact of organic inputs on total SOM and particulate
   organic matter (POM) N contents as affected by soil type and the
   relationships between sources of N and maize N uptake were assessed for
   a set of alley cropping trials in the West-African moist savanna. The
   trials were established in Niaouli (Benin Republic), in Glidji,
   Amoutchou, and Sarakawa (Togo), and in Bouake and Ferkessedougou (Cote
   d' Ivoire). The total soil N content, averaged over all treatments and
   years, varied between 324 and 1140 mg N kg(-1) soil. The POM-N content
   varied between 50 and 160 mg N kg(-1) soil. The average proportion of
   soil N belonging to the POM pool ranged between 9\% and 29\%. This was
   significantly related to the annual N inputs from maize stover and
   prunings, when averaged over the different alley cropping treatments.
   The trial `age' also appeared to be related to the impact of the
   different treatments on the POM-N content. The Ferkessedougou soil
   contained a relatively higher proportion of total soil N in the POM pool
   because of its relatively high silt and clay content, compared to the
   other sites. The relative change in POM-N content between 1996 and the
   initial sampling was about twice the relative change in total soil N
   content. This suggests that N incorporated in the POM is relatively
   labile, compared to N incorporated in the other SOM fractions. Maize N
   uptake was related to the amount of add pruning-N (partial r(2) of
   27\%), the rainfall during the growing season (partial r(2) of 17\%),
   the POM-N content (partial r(2) of 14\%), and to a lesser degree to the
   POM N concentration (partial r(2) of 5\%), the fertilizer N addition
   rate (partial r(2) of 3\%), and the silt and clay content of the soil
   (partial r(2) of 3\%). The POM-N content was shown to be influenced by
   organic matter additions and soil characteristics and to contribute
   significantly to maize N supply. This pool may be an important indicator
   for the soil fertility status of savanna soils.},

Title = {Fractal dimensions of trapped sediment particle size distribution can
   reveal sediment retention ability of common plants in a dry-hot valley},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {180},

Abstract = {Aboveground plant parts can trap moving sediment on slopes during
   concentrated water runoff, resulting in the formation of sediment mounds
   around plants. Plant morphological and functional traits may influence
   these sediment trapping patterns. Characterizing the sediment trapping
   abilities of common plants is of great interest when selecting
   appropriate plant species for erosion control. Predicting plant sediment
   trapping abilities using fractal dimensions of sediment particle size
   distribution could enhance the management and restoration of degraded
   lands with declining vegetation coverage in dry-hot valleys. Using flume
   experiments, we studied sediment retention abilities in six common plant
   species: the tree species Leucaena leucocephala and Melia azedarach; the
   shrub species Dodonaea viscose and Coriaria sinica; and the graminoids
   Heteropogon contortus and Eulaliopsis binate. Sediment trapping mass was
   measured at two ages (three-month-old and one-year-old seedlings). The
   particle size distribution of trapped sediment was determined using a
   laser particle size analyzer. The fractal characterizations (singular-
   and multi-fractal dimensions) of sediment particle size distribution
   were calculated using the fractal scale theory. Statistical analyses
   were performed to compare sediment trapping mass and the fractal
   characterizations in the six species at the two ages. C. sinica had the
   highest relative trapped sediment at both ages. Trapped sediment mass of
   one-year-old seedlings were significantly related to the singular
   fractal dimension (D), capacity dimension (D-0), entropy dimension
   (D-1), and correlation dimension (D-2) of trapped sediment particle size
   distribution. However, trapped sediment mass of three-month-old
   seedlings was only related to D, while that combining the data in both
   ages had significant correlations with D and D-0. Our results suggest
   that fractal dimension of sediment particle size distribution can
   predict sediment mass trapped by plants. Such knowledge may help
   maximize sediment trapping through appropriate species selection and
   provide useful information for slope erosion control.},

   investigated in a five-year study on an agri-silvi-horticultural system
   established in 1988; Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) was introduced in
   between the fruit trees the following year. It was repeatedly coppiced
   for fodder and fuel-wood. Average forage production of leucaena during
   1990-94 was highest in the system with Punica granatum followed by that
   of citrus and Psidium guajava; the lowest was in Zizyphus mauritiana.
   When agricultural crops were also included in the interspaces, forage
   production of leucaena was reduced. Leucaena forage yield increased with
   increasing plant density. In addition to the forage yield, leucaena has
   other beneficial effects such as providing shade for fruit trees and

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala seeds were found to be rich in proteins, but they
   contained a toxic amino acid, mimosine. Protein-isolation processes
   rendered the seed proteins relatively free of anti-nutritional factors.
   Proteins of L. leucocephala (K8) seed kernels were separated into
   different fractions on the basis of their solubility, by extracting
   successively and directly. with various solvents, i.e. water, sodium
   chloride (5\%), and sodium hydroxide (0.05 M). Globulins were found to
   be the major proteins, followed by albumins, glutelins, and prolamins.
   The proteins in these fractions were further precipitated, after
   determining their isoelectric points (pH 2-2.5). The protein and
   mimosine contents of the soluble extracts (before protein precipitation)
   and their isoelectric protein precipitates, supernatants, and insoluble
   residues, were determined. Sodium chloride (5\%) was found to be the

   Furthermore, most of the extracted mimosine was left in the supernatant
   after the protein had been precipitated out.},

Abstract = {The present research investigated the phenotypic plasticity of pasture
   legumes subjected to salinity stress in a semi-controlled environment.
   Two salinity levels were tested (0.02 dS m-1 and 10 dS m-1) to assess
   their impact on aerial and root biomass accumulation, as well as
   histological characteristics and nitrogen, sodium, and potassium
   accumulation. Findings indicated a detrimental salinity effect on all

   rostrata, Leucaena leucocephala, Clitoria ternatea, Centrosema
   pubescens, and Canavalia ensiformis notably exhibited significant
   phenotypic adaptability to salt stress across the parameters evaluated.
   Aerial and root dry matter, along with nitrogen accumulation,
   demonstrated the highest phenotypic plasticity indices in response to
   salinity. Additionally, the consistent sodium accumulation observed
   suggests that these species may employ sodium exclusion as a mechanism
   to cope with salt stress. Future research is warranted to explore
   photosynthesis and other growth stages, which would enhance
   understanding the phenotypic plasticity of these legumes under saline

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to study nutritional strategies for
   decreasing methane production by ruminants fed tropical diets, combining
   in vitro and in vivo methods. The in vitro approach was used to evaluate
   the dose effect of condensed tannins (CT) contained in leaves of
   Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Manihot esculenta (39, 75,
   and 92 g CT/kg DM, respectively) on methane production and ruminal
   fermentation characteristics. Tannin-rich plants (TRP) were incubated
   for 24 h alone or mixed with a natural grassland hay based on
   Dichanthium spp. (control plant), so that proportions of TRP were 0,
   0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0. Methane production, VFA concentration, and
   fermented OM decreased with increased proportions of TRP. Numerical
   differences on methane production and VFA concentration among TRP
   sources may be due to differences in their CT content, with greater
   effects for L. leucocephala and M. esculenta than for G. sepium.
   Independently of TRP, the response to increasing doses of CT was linear
   for methane production but quadratic for VFA concentration. As a result,
   at moderate tannin dose, methane decreased more than VFA. The in vivo
   trial was conducted to investigate the effect of TRP on different
   ruminal microbial populations. To this end, 8 rumen-cannulated sheep
   from 2 breeds (Texel and Blackbelly) were used in two 4 x 4 Latin square
   designs. Diets were fed ad libitum and were composed of the same feeds
   used for the in vitro trial: control plant alone or combined with
   pellets made from TRP leaves at 44\% of the diet DM. Compared to TRP,
   concentration of Ruminococcus flavefaciens was greater for the control
   diet and concentration of Ruminococcus albus was least for the control
   diet. The methanogen population was greater for Texel than for
   Blackbelly. By contrast, TRP-containing diets did not affect protozoa or
   Fibrobacter succinogenes numbers. Hence, TRP showed potential for
   mitigating methane production by ruminants. These findings suggest that
   TRP fed as pellets could be used to decrease methane production.},

   weight for its use in the aerial massive sowings. Was worked with seeds
   of Casuarina equisetifolia, Colubrina arborescens, Guazuma tomentosa,
   Hibiscus elatus, Albizia lebbeck, Leucaena leucocephala, Tectona
   grandis, Calophyllum antillanum, Swietenia mahogany. In order to form
   the capsules red ground and dark ground single or combined with zeolite
   and Stockosorb were used. The germination was evaluated in stonecutters.
   Both used types of ground showed good results combined with zeolite. In
   black ground in carob tree and theca the germination by effect of the
   capsule was favoured, with statistical differences in the second case.
   Whereas in colubrina and guasuma was affected slightly, without
   statistical differences, although yes in the case of the leucaena. In
   the red ground the theca and Hibiscus significantly improved their
   germination by the encapsulation, whereas it was reduced in guasuma,
   calophyllum, colubrina and the mahogany tree of significant form.},

Abstract = {A study was conducted during 1994-96 at Bijapur on the effect of in-situ
   moisture conservation practices and integrated use of organic and
   inorganic sources of nutrients on crop yield and soil properties.
   Compartmental bunding and ridges and furrows increased the grain yield
   by 22.8 and 25.6 \% respectively, mainly owing to reduction in runoff,
   soil loss and increased availability of moisture and nutrients, viz N, P
   and K. Higher availability of nutrients in the top soil (0-15 cm depth)
   compared to sub soil (15-30 cm depth) was due to application of
   nutrients and higher rate of mineralisation. Among different sources of
   organics, application of white popinac (Leucaena leucocephala Lam.)
   proved superior over farmyard manure and vermicompost due to higher
   moisture conservation and faster rate of mineralisation and higher
   nutrient availability. Increase in N dose up to 50 kg/ha increased the
   availability of nutrients and their uptake resulted in improved crop
   growth and grain yield over 25 kg/ha and control.},

   etli strains that originated from bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) in
   the size and replicator region of the symbiotic plasmid and in
   symbiotic-plasmid-borne traits such as nifH gene sequence and
   organization, melanin production and host specificity. A new biovar. by.
   mimosae, is proposed within R. etli to encompass Rhizobium isolates
   obtained from M. affinis. The strains from common bean plants have been
   designated previously as R. etli by. phaseoli. Strains of both R. etli

Abstract = {Several species of Leucaena have been used traditionally by indigenous
   people of Mexico and Central America as part of their subsistence use of
   plant resources available in the natural environment. However, this does
   not imply an intensive use of Leucaena in their farming systems.
   Leucaena leucocephala is the most widely-used species, but it has
   limitations such as slow growth during establishment, low drought and
   cold tolerance, poor growth on acid soils and susceptibility to
   defoliating psyllid insects. These inherent problems of L. leucocephala
   added to deficient technology transfer programs, poor diffusion of
   technical information and farmers' tradition, are responsible for its
   limited adoption in farming systems of the American tropics. With the
   present technology available for L. leucocephala, productivity of large
   areas of the region can be improved either by incorporating leucaena in
   grazing systems or into crop lands. However, to realise this potential,
   technical and technology transfer problems must be solved.},

Abstract = {The impact of grazing on plant composition and dominance of natural
   grassland, as well as plant population of established silvipasture, were
   studied at Jhansi from October 1991 to June 1994. There was no harmful
   effect an the plant composition and dominance of the perennial grasses
   in natural grassland due to round the pear grazing. Similarly, plant
   population of Chrysopogon fulvous was also not affected due to round the
   year grazing by sheep and goats under silvipastoral system. However,
   legume components drastically decreased under natural grassland, as well
   as in silvipastoral system. Out of three tree species, Leucaena
   leucocephala survived minimum (11.5\%), followed by Dichrostachys
   cinerea (64.0\%) under grazing conditions. Thus, it carl be concluded
   that the legume components are affected severely by grazing in both the
   types of pasture even with optimum stocking rate of animals. In tree
   species, L. leucocephala was also affected adversely, while perennial
   grasses did not show any harmful effect of grazing.},

   ethene, propene, alpha-pinene and beta- pinene. Among the plant species,
   Tectona grandis, Bambusa vulgaris and Psidium guajava showed high
   fractions of isoprene emission, Saraca asoca showed moderate emission,
   and Manilkara zapota and Leucaena leucocephala showed the lowest
   emission. However, M. zapota and L. leucocephala showed higher emission
   of both ethene and propene compared to isoprene. This study emphasizes
   the importance of emission flux mea-surements of major plant species in

Abstract = {Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala ssp. glabrata) is a highly palatable and
   productive forage used mainly by beef producers on extensive properties
   in northern Australia. When sown into native or sown grass pastures,
   leucaena provides significant production, economic, environmental and
   social benefits. Adoption of leucaena was slow initially due to a range
   of technical, agronomic and landscape factors. These have now been
   largely overcome through extensive research, development, producer
   experience and other advances, resulting in around 130,000 ha of
   cultivated leucaena being utilized across northern Australia.
   A range of aspects will need to be addressed if the adoption of leucaena
   is to be accelerated into the future. These include environmental
   concerns, especially potential weediness, and a range of technological
   needs, including soil nutritional requirements, grazing and toxicity
   management, opportunities for companion fodder systems and conservation
   options. Advances in technology and the ongoing need for a high-quality,

   alternatives to improve the quality and amount of the ration in the calf
   and heifer stages. Forty crossbred calves (Holstein upgraded) with 145
   kg of liveweight and eight months of age were used to assess their
   performance and development in a feeding system based on star grass
   (Cynodon nlemfuensis), associated with a mixture of legumes of kudzu
   (Pueraria phaseoloide), Clitoria (Clitoria ternatea), terannus (Terannus
   labialis), stylo (Stylosanthes guianensis), centro (Centrocema
   pubescens), glycine (Neonotonia wightii) and leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala) as natural tutor. In the calf stage, they were fed 1
   kg/animal/d of a concentrate containing 86\% dry matter (DM), 11.84\%
   crude protein (CP) and 10.8 MJ of metabolizable energy/kg of dry matter,
   provided only in the dry season. After this stage, 20 yearling heifers
   of 208 kg of liveweight and 12.5 months of age were allocated in a
   pastures of Pennisetum (Cuba CT-115) associated with a mixture of
   legumes composed by glycine (Neonotonia wightii) and leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala). Also, they were supplemented with multi-nutritional
   blocks. In both stages, the animals rotated in six paddocks, with a
   stocking rate of 1.5 LAU/ha. The occupation time in the paddock was of 5
   and 7 d during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. The pasture was
   not irrigated or fertilized. The calves and yearling heifers were
   weighed every 15 d and body measures were undertaken (cross height,
   thoracic perimeter and body length). The availability and quality of the
   pasture were determined monthly. The forage balance was positive in both
   stages and the edible dry matter was higher than 5 kg/100 kg of
   liveweight. The daily increase of liveweight (452, 521 and 501
   g/animal/d) for calves, yearling heifers, as well as that of the total
   period, showed respectively a good performance. In calves, the thoracic
   perimeter was increased 15.7 cm, which reflected the feeding potential
   of the system under study. Puberty in the yearling heifers was attained
   at 15.6 months and the incorporation to artificial insemination was at
   20 months. The results indicate a good potential of the system to fulfil
   the requirements of dry matter in both seasons and attain a good level
   of liveweight, as well as adequate reproductive performance.},

Abstract = {A greenhouse experiment experiment was conducted to determine the
   effectiveness of three vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) species in
   an Oxisol subjected to simulated erosion using Leucaena leucocephala as
   an indicator host. The extent of colonization of leucaena roots
   increased significantly due to VAM inoculation of the eroded and
   uneroded soils. The highest level of VAM colonization was observed when
   leucaena was grown in association with Glomus aggregatum, followed by G.
   mosseae  and G. etunicatum. Increased infection associated with
   inoculation of the eroded soil did not result in enhanced mycorrhizal
   effectiveness. Inoculation of the uneroded soil, however, led to
   significant improvement in root colonization as well as in symbiotic
   effectiveness. Suppression in expression of mycorrhizal effectiveness in
   the eroded soil appears to be a result of nutrient deficiency. The
   results suggest the importance of restoring lost nutrients before
   differences in VAM species could  be effectively exploited for a
   successful establishment of a mycorrhizal plants in eroded soils.},

   sheep to improve productivity in small-scale holdings in Benin. Dry
   matter intake per kg metabolic body weight (DM g/kg W-0.75) varied
   between the different browse feeds and between the different trials and
   ranged from zero (Leucaena leucocephala) up to 26.7 DM g/kg W-0.75

   between 58.9 \% (L. leucocephala) and 68.2 \% (Mallotus oppositifolius).
   Agelaea obliqua showed the highest levels of total phenols (10.2 \%),
   tannin phenols (8.8 \%) and extractable condensed tannins (8.0 \%).
   Leaves from various browse feeds are a good and protein-rich

Abstract = {Uricase II is a purine metabolic enzyme highly induced in root nodules
   during the symbiosis established between legumes and bacteria of the
   genera Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium. Here we describe the
   characterization of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) nodule uricase II cDNA and
   show that uricase II is encoded by a single gene in the bean genome.
   This gene is also expressed in cotyledons, roots, and hypocotyls during
   bean seedling establishment, and an anti-uricase antibody recognizes the
   protein in different seedling organs. Uricase II has also been found in
   Leucaena leucocephala seedlings, suggesting that it participates during
   seedling establishment in legumes that do not transport ureides. A 50-kD
   polypeptide that is detected by the anti-uricase antibody is found in
   cotyledons during seedling development. This higher-molecular-mass form
   is also detected in developing roots and hypocotyls but not in nodules.
   In situ hybridization experiments in root seedlings showed uricase II
   transcripts in the metaxylem parenchyma cells and phloem fibers of the

Abstract = {Biomass is nowadays a very important alternative to energy consumption,
   since it provides less environmental harms. Briquettes come as an option
   since they include logistical and efficiency advantages. This study
   aimed to characterize Leucaena leucocephala (leucena) and Gonoacantha
   piptadenia (pau-jacare) biomass, to define their energy potential and
   verify the briquettes' moisture content and the mechanical resistance.
   Six treatments were provided: 2 species and three different moisture
   contents (10\%, 12\% and 15\%). Fifteen briquettes were produced for
   each treatment. The results showed that moisture content changes the
   stability of the briquettes. The pau-jacare showed a better performance,
   in every aspect analyzed, superior chemical characteristics (ash content
   of 1.83\%), higher heating value (18,956 kJ kg(-1)) and better
   mechanical resistance (0.5255 MPa). However, both species provided fine
   results toward this proposal. Therefore, they can be used in every
   moisture content tested here, offering satisfactory results for

Abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most commonly adopted
   feature reduction techniques in remote sensing image analysis. However,

   different wavelength regions. The developed algorithm can not only
   reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery but also extracts
   helpful information for differentiating more effectively the target

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {In recent years, livestock producers have widely sown tropical perennial
   grasses, such as digit grass (Digitaria eriantha), in the frost-prone
   summer dominant rainfall zone of eastern Australia. Tropical grasses
   require substantial nitrogen inputs to maintain water productivity and
   forage quality. Perennial legumes offer a potential nitrogen source for
   these perennial grasses when sown in a mixed sward. Lucerne (Medicago
   sativa) is the perennial legume most widely sown in grazing systems in
   south-eastern Australia. In this study, conducted over the period
   2014-2018, we compared the soil water dynamics and rainwater
   productivity of pure stands of digit grass (fertilized with applied
   nitrogen), lucerne, desmanthus (Desmanthus virgatus) and leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala) and binary mixtures of digit grass (not
   fertilized with applied nitrogen) with each legume. We found that often
   growing season actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was similar among the
   treatments (P > 0.05), but rainwater productivity (kg DM/ha.mm ) and
   proportion (\%) of legume herbage mass were not (P < 0.05). Our results
   showed that the lucerne-digit grass mix was equally productive and
   efficient as fertilized digit grass (P > 0.05), particularly in the
   latter three seasons. However, lucerne dominated the herbage mass (c. >
   67\% legume). Leucaena production was delayed by frost and severely
   impacted by competition with digit grass, and generally underperformed
   both lucerne and desmanthus. This observation did always not hold when
   alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) impacted desmanthus in specific seasons. Our
   experiment has shown that a mixed sward of lucerne-digit grass is highly
   productive and offered high rainwater productivity. Both desmanthus and
   leucaena, in mixes with digit grass, provided useful contributions of
   legume herbage mass, in specific seasons and under specific conditions,
   but both underperformed overall compared with lucerne.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen is an essential macro-nutrient for plant growth and is
   indispensable for high agricultural food productivity and quality.
   Shortage of good quality forage under the dry winter season and low soil
   fertility conditions are the major constraints in rural farming systems
   in the Moist Tall Grassveld of the Upper Thukela, South Africa. The
   effect of legumes on inorganic soil nitrogen was assessed in an
   agroforestry trial (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit, Acacia karroo
   Hayne, Dactylis glomerata L., Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), by soil
   sampling method. In the agroforestry trial, total inorganic soil
   nitrogen accumulation was significantly greater under intercropping than
   under sole crop treatments and, irrespective of the treatments,
   significantly more nitrate than ammonium nitrogen was measured. The
   study demonstrated that intercropping grasses with tree legumes could
   provide important ecosystem services of nitrogen supply in the soil. The
   results suggested that introducing legume intercrops might constitute a
   relevant cropping strategy to improve the soil fertility status with
   regard to nitrogen while at the same time providing forage in
   smallholder farming systems in South Africa's Moist Tall Grassveld
   regions.},

Abstract = {Objective: to evaluate voluntary intake of four forage species by

   two phases. The first consisted of an adaptation period of 4 days during
   which they were offered 1 kg of each forage in different feeders for 4
   hours, then removing and weighing the remaining forage to determine
   consumption. The voluntary intake test was assessed in the second phase
   using a Latin square design (4x4). Forage intake was analyzed using the
   Statgraphics 5.1 software. Results: highly significant differences
   (p<0.01) between consumption of each forage were observed, being G.
   ulmifolia the most consumed (170.18 g dry matter), followed by L.

   respectively). The least consumed was P. purpureum (21.65 g dry matter).
   Conclusions: considering its high consumption and moisture content, G.
   ulmifolia could be successfully used as cut fodder for peccaries under

Abstract = {This work was developed on an Eutrophic Cambisol, in Poco Verde, SE,
   Brazil, from 1984 to 1987. It aimed to make compatible the exploitation
   of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam. de Wit) intercropped with maize,
   bean and cotton, without causing, however, significative changes in the
   production systems being used by small holders. Seedlings were planted
   with a spacing of 2,5 m between rows and 1,0 m between plants, both in
   the sole crop and intercrop. In the intercropping systems crops were
   planted between the rows of leucaena. Plants were pruned (leaves +
   branches with a diameter lesser than 0,5 m) as they came to flowering
   and every year, at the beginning of rainy season, leucaena plants were
   cut 0,20 m above soil and the crops were planted. In the second year,
   there was no difference in the behavior of leucaena in sole crop and
   intercrop. Leucaena yielded about 9,000 kg of dry matter/ba/year,
   corresponding to about 2,500 kg of crude protein. Bean and maize yields
   were expressive. Nevertheless, the use of cotton revealed to be
   inadvisable.},

Abstract = {Rainfed areas are the home of millions of resource poor farmers whose
   livelihood is under continuous threat due to frequent droughts. Assuring
   double cropping and imparting livelihood resilience to rainfed
   smallholders is a challenge. A study was planned in this direction
   during 2013-2021 for livelihood resilience and sustainable
   intensification of rainfed smallholder farming systems through rain
   water harvesting and agroforestry based interventions. The one hectare
   rainfed farming system model comprising of rain water harvesting farm
   pond (25 m x 20 m x 2.5 m), less water requiring food crops
   (groundnut-barley and sorghum-chickpea), agrihorticulture {[}Ziziphus
   mauritiana + (Sesamum indicum-Cicer arietinum)], silvipasture (Leucaena
   leucocephala + Tri-species hybrid grass + Stylosanthes hamata) and
   boundary plantation (Leucaena leucocephala and Opuntia ficus-indica) was
   evaluated at on-station as well as promoted on-farm. The goat rearing
   potential of the above model was also estimated under intensive and
   semi-intensive systems. The on-station rainfed farming system module
   produced 4979 kg ha(-1) barley equivalent yield consisting of multiple
   products like barley, chickpea, groundnut, Indian jujube fruits, sesame,
   fodder (sorghum, TSH, Stylosanthes, Leucaena dried leaf meal and
   spine-less fodder cactus cladodes) and Grewia fruits and resulted in 655
   US\$ year(-1) net returns with a benefit cost ratio of 2.1. The carrying
   capacity of the above model was found to be 9 and 35 goat year(-1) under
   intensive and semi-intensive rearing systems, respectively. The net
   returns increased by 36 and 226\% with the inclusion of goat under
   intensive (US\$ 892) and semi-intensive rearing system (US\$ 2136),
   respectively in the rainfed farming system model. It was evident from
   the study that inclusion of goat, agroforestry and farm pond for rain
   water harvesting in the rainfed farming have resulted in higher
   profitability and resilience to less rainfall and its aberrations.
   Contrarily, the on-farm observations revealed that farmers could not
   take winter season crops without rain water harvesting. The rain water
   harvesting proved to be the key for reducing chances of crop failures
   due to droughts, ensuring double cropping (cropping intensity up to
   200\%) and sustainable intensification in rainfed areas. It can be
   concluded from the present study that intervention of water harvesting,
   agroforestry and goat in rainfed farming systems could enhance the farm
   productivity and profitability and impart resilience to the livelihood
   of rainfed farmers in semi-arid tropics.},

Title = {Effect of solar radiation intensity of the grazing system on Pelibuey
   sheep behavior in rainy season},
Journal = {BIOTECNIA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The objective was to determine the effect of solar radiation intensity
   of the grazing system sheep behavior. Treatment 1 consisted of:
   monoculture of natural grasses (47 +/- 5 lux); treatment 2: natural
   grasses with Leucaena leucocephala trees (34 +/- 3 lux); and treatment
   3: natural grasses with Manguifera indica trees (16 +/- 3 lux). The
   total time of each activity per session of the day was determined. A
   completely randomized design was used with a 3x2 factorial arrangement
   (three intensities of solar radiation for sessions per day). Grazing
   behavior was affected by the interaction between factors. The
   grazing-walking activity was higher in the pastures with lower levels of
   solar radiation (Leucaena y Manguifera), with 217.50 y 216.38 min,
   respectively, in the morning session, while all times were lower in the
   afternoon session, with the lowest result in grazing in the sun (108.05
   minutes). The reduction of solar radiation under the treetops favored
   the behavior of the sheep, this allowed the animals to perform resting
   and ruminating activities under the shade of the trees, more preferably
   in the afternoon session.},

Abstract = {Torrefaction, also known as mild pyrolysis, is proven to convert raw
   biomass into a value-added energy commodity particularly for application
   in combustion and co-firing systems with improved storage and handling
   properties. This paper aims to compare the characteristics of Malaysian
   bituminous coal i.e. Silantek coal with raw and torrefied biomass pellet
   originated from oil palm frond and fast growing tree species, Leucaena
   Leucocephala. Biomass samples were initially torrefied at 300 degrees C
   for 60 minutes. Resulting torrefied biomass pellets were analysed using
   a number of standard fuel characterisation analyses i.e. elemental
   analysis, proximate analysis and calorific content (high heating values)
   experiments. Investigations on combustion characteristics via dynamic
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), grindability and moisture uptake tests
   were also performed on the torrefied biomass pellets. Better quality
   bio-chars were produced as compared to its raw forms and with optimal
   process conditions, torrefaction may potentially produces a solid fuel
   with combustion reactivity and porosity equivalent to raw biomass while
   having compatible energy density and grindability to coal.},

   field under humid tropical circumstances. Addition of earthworms
   significantly increased the breakdown of maize stover. Addition of
   millipedes significantly increased the breakdown of maize stover and
   rice straw. Combined addition of earthworms and millipedes generally
   resulted in greater plant residue breakdown, compared to that of a
   single group of fauna. During 10 weeks of exposure, earthworms and
   millipedes, on average, accounted for the breakdown of all plant
   residues by 10.4 and 28.4\%, respectively. Millipedes and earthworms
   contributed more to the breakdown of plant residues with low quality
   (high C-to-N ratio, lignin and polyphenol contents) than to the
   degradation of those with high quality. It is concluded that

Abstract = {The effect of maize, sunflower and soybean intercropping at leucaena
   sowing on the establishment of this species, the recovery of star grass
   and grain yield of the intercropped seasonal cultures was studied. A
   random block design with 4 replications was used. Treatments were:
   leucaena sown alone or intercropped with 1 or 3 furrows between a double
   row with maize, sunflower or soybean after a conventional soil
   preparation; At 35 days of sowing the number of plants/m(2) of leucaena
   was similar in all treatments (5-6 plants/m(2)). In the cultures, this
   measurement varied according to the species, being greater(P < 0.001) in
   soybean when 3 furrows between double rows of leucaena were sown. Yield
   (t/ha DM), height, leaves and stems/leucaena plants were not affected by
   the intercropped species 120 days after sowing. The best grain yield was
   obtained when 3 furrows of soybean between double rows of leucaena (0.72
   t/ha) were intercropped. Sunflower contributed 1.95 t/ha of DM of
   harvest residues which differed (P < 0.05) from the remaining
   treatments. At the end of the experiment, 11 months after sowing,
   leucaena yield (1.95 t/ha DM) was higher(P < 0.05) when one furrow of
   sunflower was intercropped and lower (0.64 t/ha) when 3 furrows of
   sunflower were sown. The highest yield (P < 0.05) of star grass (2.6
   t/ha DM) was attained when 1 or 3 furrows of soybean were intercropped
   and the lowest was when 3 furrows of sunflower were intercropped between
   double rows of leucaena (1.4 t/ha DM). It was concluded that the
   contribution to grain production when 3 furrows of maize or soybean are
   intercropped is an option to decrease the establishment costs of
   leucaena and star grass. Soybean had a higher contribution to grain
   production and it favoured or did not affect biomass production of
   leucaena and star grass. A single row of sunflower also improved
   leucaena yield.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a review of relevant literature and research on the
   potential of silvopastoral systems for milk and meat production in Cuba.
   This work emphasizes the contribution of trees in pasture systems, which
   are known to improve the plant community as well as increase the
   productive efficiency of steers, reproductive females and dairy cattle.
   Results from this research suggest that, due to the association effect,
   both the availability of dry matter and the total protein content of
   gramineous plants is increased in pastoral systems that incorporate
   trees while also maintaining pasture. In systems of gramineous plants
   that have been mixed with Leucaena leucocephala and that support cows of
   average potential, it is possible to obtain milk production of 10
   kg/cow/day in addition to live-weight gains of 0.500-0.600 kg/animal
   day(-1) in Cebu cattle. This work concludes that the use of
   silvopastoral systems is a viable option for the production of milk and
   meat under low-input conditions, such as those in Cuba.},

   climates and soil types. The impact of the biophysical environment on
   hedgerow N uptake, wood production and maize grain yield was assessed
   for three years in three alley cropping trials with a selected number of
   hedgerow species in Glidji (Southern Togo), Amoutchou (Central Togo),
   and Sarakawa (Northern Togo), Senna siamea hedgerows accumulated
   significantly more N in the first pruning in Glidji (129-138 kg N
   ha(-1)) and Sarakawa (102-185 kg N ha(-1)) than in Amoutchou (17-26 kg N
   ha(-1)). This difference in N uptake was attributed to the infertile
   subsoil in Amoutchou, which was sandy up to 1 m and had a shallow
   groundwater-table. The amount of N accumulated in the Gliricidia sepium
   biomass varied between 38 kg N ha(-1) in Glidji and 142 kg N ha(-1) in
   Amoutchou. Averaged over all species and sites, 9 to 29\% and 9 to 39\%
   of the annual N accumulation in the hedgerow biomass is incorporated in
   the second, respectively third pruning. The Gliricidia trees produced
   between 12 and 26 ton fresh matter ha(-1) of wood and the Senna trees
   between 4 and 38 ton fresh matter ha(-1). Maize grain yield in Glidji
   was not affected by treatments (3196 kg ha(-1), on average). In
   Amoutchou, the highest grain production was observed in the Gliricidia
   treatment (2774 kg ha(-1) vs 1007 kg ha(-1) in the control), while in
   Sarakawa, the Gliricidia (3786 kg ha(-1)) and Senna (3842 kg ha(-1))
   plots produced a greater grain yield than the control plots (2123 kg
   ha(-1)). Maize yield increase in the alley cropping systems relative to
   the control plots was related to the soil total N content. Top and
   sub-soil characteristics were shown to be an important modifier of the
   functioning of alley cropping systems and should be taken into account
   when deciding on whether to use alley cropping and when selecting the
   hedgerow species.},

Abstract = {Rapidly growing vegetables could be an abundant and cheap sources of
   lignocellulose biomass for lignocellulose nanofibre (LCNF) production.
   The aim of this work is to study the feasibility of using Chamaecytisus
   proliferus and Leucaena leucocephala for LCNF isolation by mechanical,
   enzymatic and TEMPO-mediated oxidation pre- treatments. Characterisation
   of the nanofibres shows that there are significant differences in the
   production of LCNF depending on the raw material and pre- treatment
   used. XRD and FTIR analysis show that homogenisation has a strong
   negative effect on the crystallinity index; however, the higher lignin
   content of tagasaste (10\%) protects the fibre, causing a smaller
   decrease in crystallinity. The thermal stability of LCNF is also
   affected by the high lignin content in the case of tagasaste, which
   exhibited maximum degradation temperatures of 340-315 degrees C, that
   were higher than those for leucaena (330-310 degrees C). A strong shear
   thinning behaviour was observed in most of the LCNF, which revealed a
   great degree of interconnectivity in the gel like- network. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Nitrogen fixing trees (NFTs) have the potential to grow on degraded
   lands in submontaneous areas and produce green fodder, especially during
   the period from December to June. The most important NFTs for the
   submontaneous zone are Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena), Albizia
   lebbeck, Acacia nilotica, and Dalbergia sissoo. Leucaena has the highest
   potential for yield and quality. Farmers do not plant NFTs on
   agricultural fields because grain production is their first priority.
   Ora-farm applied research was initiated in 1991-92 in five watersheds
   under the Integrated Watershed Development Project with a view to
   include NFTs in existing farming systems. The experience of more than
   three years showed that farmers accept NFTs, especially leucaena, on
   farm boundaries as live fencing or/and live fence poles and as
   vegetative barriers to control soil erosion on graded bunds. Survival
   and growth of seedlings were higher in V-ditches than in pits. In areas
   where damage by stray cattle is not a problem, canopy can be managed by
   coppicing and pollarding; the lopping method is more suitable if damage
   by cattle is a serious problem.},

Abstract = {Alley cropping has been promoted as a sustainable agroforestry practice
   for upland tropical agriculture since the late 1970s. Early trials and
   demonstrations in humid locations on more fertile soils have indicated a
   number of positive benefits on crop performance. However, when the
   technology was used in less favourable sites, negative impacts,
   particularly due to competition between hedgerow and crop, became
   apparent. The root distribution of hedgerow species is one of the main
   factors influencing competition but research on this topic to date has
   been minimal. Leucaena leucocephala has been the most widely used
   hedgerow species in alley cropping but its competitiveness makes it less
   suitable in harsher environments. A number of species from other genera
   as well as lines from within Leucaena such as the new KX2 hybrid may be
   suitable alternatives for these sites. Adoption of the alley cropping
   technology by the farming community has been less than satisfactory in
   most areas. Some of the reasons for the poor adoption and how this may
   be improved are discussed.},

   concentrations found in leaves of deficient trees which are supposed to
   be below the critical level for adequate nutrient supply. Leucaena

   dried mixture of urea and not-germinated barley. Mixtures of urea with
   Leucaena leucocephala or Azadirachta indica (Neem cake) showed
   degradabilities of about 80 and 93\%, respectively, when dried at

   degradabilities of proteins of ground nut, guar, sunflower, mustard,

   significantly higher on the expense of urinary N-excretion, compared
   with groups fed isonitrogenous rations containing soya bean meal with or

   dolomite rate, and these contents were usually not affected by placement
   method. Yield of leaf, grazeable stem (<8 mm) and seed were affected
   linearly (P<0.01) by dolomite rate, but increases always depended on
   placement, with higher yield coming from 3-m strip. Root activity, as
   determined by Sr uptake, was largely confined to dolomite-treated areas
   because of high (16 mg kg-1) exchangeable Al content in untreated soil.
   Leucaena can be grown on a dolomite-strip treated area, but a 3-m wide
   strip is recommended with rates of 8 Mg ha-1 of dolomite.},

   nitrate reductase (NR) enzyme activity for Gleditsia triacanthos,
   Leucaena leucocephala, and Robinia pseudoacacia plant species. The

   proline, total carotenoids, and total carbohydrate content of leaves of
   the three species with increasing the concentration of Ni and Pb except
   for the total carbohydrate, which increased only for L. leucocephala
   species. Each NR enzyme activity and ascorbic acid content are increased
   significantly with increasing the concentration of Ni and Pb for G.
   triacanthos, L. leucocephala, and on the contrary, they decreased
   significantly for R. pseudoacacia species. From the result, we can
   conclude a general increase or decrease in leaves content of some
   antioxidants content for all the species, whereas there is some
   peculiarity according to the plant species regarding other contents,
   which in turn reflects different mechanisms of these species to tolerant

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala subsp. leucocephala was introduced to Hawaii after
   European settlement and spread widely for cattle fodder and fuelwood. As
   in many other tropical locations where it has been introduced, it has
   naturalized and spread in disturbed and drier habitats. While it is
   common in disturbed areas, it is much less common in intact native dry
   forests. It is resilient to wildfire and mammalian grazing, which
   conversely threaten the integrity of remnant native dryland forest. The
   successional trajectory of areas dominated by leucaena has not been well
   studied in Hawaii, but it is probable that other non-native rather than
   native species will replace it. As a result of its widespread
   distribution, especially on steep slopes, priority for its eradication
   or control is low. Current biocontrol options are limited in
   effectiveness. Control of leucaena can and should be given greater
   priority to protect native dryland forests and inhibit spread of seeds.
   Restoration of dryland habitats requires intensive, sustained efforts,
   usually involving volunteers. Combining cultural and/or use values in
   restoration projects holds promise for stimulating and sustaining
   community involvement.},

   Galactomannan (GA) isolated from the mature seed of a local plant, petai
   belalang known scientifically as Leucaena leucocephala were modified to
   acrylated galactomannan (AcGA) which acted as a precursor molecule for
   the preparation of crosslinked galactomannan nanoparticles (CL-GA). AcGA
   was synthesized using acryloyl chloride (AC) as a chemical modifier
   through esterification process. Trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA)
   was used as the crosslinker for the preparation of CL-GA. Successful
   conjugation of GA with acrylates was verified by H-1 NMR and FTIR
   spectroscopies. Thermal properties of pure galactomannan, AcGA and CL-GA
   were measured using DSC to complement spectroscopic results. TEM images
   revealed the particle size of AcGA to be in the range of 30-100 nm; and
   increased to 200-850 nm range after the crosslinking process. Efficiency
   of CL-GA to trap crystal violet dye as a model drug was followed by UV
   Vis Spectroscopy. Results showed that CL-GA is capable of trapping
   crystal violet dye and has the potential to be used as a drug carrier.},

Abstract = {In biomass gasification facilities different biomasses are used, with
   different proportions of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. Several
   pretreatments are performed in these installations in an effort to
   change physical characteristics of the feedstock such as drying, size
   reduction, size fractionation, and leaching with water. Taking into
   account that lignin gasification produces more hydrogen than other
   components of the biomass, it could be of interest as a pretreatment
   that improves lignin content, Composting is a biological process that
   modifies biomass composition, increasing lignin content. Without going
   into any economic details, the present work studies the effect of
   biomass composting (biological pretreatment) on hydrogen production in
   air gasification. This laboratory-scale experience was completed,
   studying the effect of the heating rate on the gasification process. In
   this study, two different biomasses were used: Leucaena (Leucaena
   Leucocephala) and Tagasaste (Chamaecytisus palmensis). The experimental
   results show that combining slow heating rate and biomass composting,
   hydrogen production increases 20\% (into studied range). This result can
   be related with feedstock composition (inorganic matter and lignin
   contents) and char properties.},

Title = {Browse from Three Tree Legumes Increases Forage Production for Cattle in
   a Silvopastoral System in the Southwest Amazon},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Unsustainable cattle ranching in the Amazon leads to land
   degradation and incentivizes deforestation. Planting trees in pastures
   ('silvopasture' or `silvopastoral systems') is a novel approach that has
   the potential to increase the sustainability of cattle production in the
   Amazon. Trees provide additional feed whilst also enhancing
   biodiversity, capturing carbon and improving soil quality. We measured
   the potential contribution of tree forage to pasture-fed cattle at a
   trial farm in Peru. Three leguminous tree species (Erythrina berteroana,
   Inga edulis and Leucaena leucocephala) were planted with grass, and
   their productivity was compared to plots containing only grass. We
   compared destructive and non-destructive methodologies that estimated
   intake of tree forage by browsing cattle. We found that fresh tree
   foliage of the three tree species was palatable to cattle and could be
   directly browsed. Cattle mostly foraged below 1.6 m and consumed 99\% of
   available foliage from E. berteroana, 75\% of available forage from I.
   edulis and 80\% of available forage from L. leucocephala. Plots
   containing trees and grass produced more forage biomass (mean > 2.2 Mg
   ha(-1)) than grass only plots (mean = 1.5 Mg ha(-1)). This research
   highlights the potential for sustainable intensification of livestock
   production in the Amazon. Assessing the palatability of forage from
   locally adapted trees could improve the sustainability of livestock
   production systems. However, grasses continue to dominate livestock feed
   across the Amazon. We established a silvopastoral cattle farming system
   in Peru, comparing three different forage tree species with grass
   monocultures using a randomised block design. Trees were arranged in
   alleys of 0.5 x 7.5 m, planted alongside grass, and were directly
   browsed by cattle. Browse removal was estimated by three methods:
   destructive sampling, canopy measurements and leaf counts. We found that
   all three tree species were palatable to cattle. Plots containing trees
   and grass produced more available forage (mean > 2.2 Mg ha(-1)) for
   cattle than the grass monocultures (mean = 1.5 Mg ha(-1)). Destructive
   sampling below 1.6 m demonstrated that cattle consumed 99\% of the
   available Erythrina berteroana forage, 75\% of the available Inga edulis
   forage and 80\% of the available Leucaena leucocephala forage in 8 days.
   This research demonstrates methodologies to estimate the intake of
   locally adapted browse species by cattle and highlights the potential
   benefits of silvopastoral systems in the Amazon. Planting trees could
   also benefit animal health and provide ecosystem services such as soil
   regeneration, enhanced nutrient cycling and carbon capture.},

   Meloidogyne exigua Goeldi, a nematode widely disseminated through
   Brazilian coffee fields. Thus, aqueous extracts of such plants,
   collected in a different season from that of the previous work, as well
   as crude metabolites produced in liquid medium by Fusarium moniliforme
   Shelden and Cylindrocarpon magnusianum (Sacc.) Woll., were submitted to
   in vitro assays with M. exigua second-stage juveniles (J2). All plants
   and fungi produced active substances against J2. Therefore, their
   metabolites were applied to six-month-old coffee plants inoculated with
   M. exigua. After 90 days in a greenhouse, those samples obtained from A.
   cepa, L. leucocephala, R. graveolens and F. moniliforme inhibited the
   production of galls and eggs by M. exigua, demonstrating potential to
   control such parasite.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of
   including non conventional forages and food in the diet of developing
   guinea pigs on their productive behaviour, carcass yield, and meat
   quality. Within this context, four concentrated food mixtures were
   designed based on the requirements of the species. 64 guinea pigs of 21
   days of age were used. A random block design was used, with four blocks
   and 8 repetitions per diet, each experimental unit included two animals.
   The analyzed variables were weight gain, food and dry material
   consumption, mortality index, and carcass yield percentage. The
   statistical analysis of the variables did not show significant
   differences, except for meat protein percentage when Leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala) was used in the diet. The analyses revealed that the
   weight gain, food and dry material consumption, and carcass yield, as
   well as the nutritional composition of the meat were adequate.
   Altogether, these results demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating
   white mulberry (Morus alba), glicinia (Glycine white), leucaena, hen
   manure, citrus fruits flour, and honey in the concentrated diet of
   developing guinea pigs.},

Abstract = {The anthelmintic (AH) effect of Acacia pennatula, Leucaena leucocephala,
   Lisyloma latisiliquum and Piscidia piscipula was evaluated in the
   infective larvae (L-3) of Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Different
   concentrations of lyophilized extracts were tested using the larval
   migration inhibition (LMI) test. An inhibitor of tannins (the polyvinyl
   polypyrrolidone {[}PVPP]) was used to verify whether these compounds
   were responsible for the AH effects. Then, the effect of extracts on
   larval exsheathment was examined by observing the exsheathment process
   at 10-min intervals for 70 min. The LMI test showed a dose-dependant AH
   effect for A. pennatula, L leucocephala and L. latisiliquum (P < 0.01),
   but not for P. piscipula. The restoration of L3 migration to values
   similar to those of controls after the addition of PVPP, indicates that
   tannins are involved in AH effects. Trichostrongylus colubriformis
   exsheathment was partially or totally blocked by the four plants
   extracts. Tropical tanniniferous plants evaluated in the current study
   may have potential as AH for the control of T colubriformis if in vivo
   investigations indicate useful effects. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Increasing population pressures combined with government policies exert
   considerable pressure on traditional slash-and-burn farmers in northern

   better plant densities than June or September sowings. However, early
   sowing of Stylosanthes species reduced rice yield by 20-30\% in 1993.
   Dibbling rice mixed (same hill) with leucaena resulted in good

Title = {Microbial colonisation of tannin-rich tropical plants: Interplay between
   degradability, methane production and tannin disappearance in the rumen},
Journal = {ANIMAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Condensed tannins in plants are found free and attached to protein and
   fibre but it is not known whether these fractions influence rumen
   degradation and microbial colonisation. This study explored the rumen
   degradation of tropical tannin-rich plants and the relationship between
   the disappearance of free and bound condensed tannin fractions and
   microbial communities colonising plant particles using in situ and in
   vitro experiments. Leaves from Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia
   sepium, and Leucaena leucocephala, pods from Acacia nilotica and the
   leaves of two agricultural by-products: Manihot esculenta and Musa spp.
   were incubated in situ in the rumen of three dairy cows to determine
   their degradability for up to 96 h. Tannin disappearance was determined
   at 24 h of incubation, and adherent microbial communities were examined
   at 3 and 12 h of incubation using a metataxonomic approach. An in vitro
   approach was also used to assess the effects of these plants on rumen
   fermentation parameters. All plants contained more than 100 g/kg of
   condensed tannins with a large proportion (32-61\%) bound to proteins.
   Calliandra calothyrsus had the highest concentration of condensed
   tannins at 361 g/kg, whereas Acacia nilotica was particularly rich in
   hydrolysable tannins (350 g/kg). Free condensed tannins from all plants
   completely disappeared after 24-h incubation in the rumen. Disappearance
   of protein-bound condensed tannins was variable with values ranging from
   93\% for Gliricidia sepium to 21\% for Acacia nilotica. In contrast,
   fibre-bound condensed tannin disappearance averaged similar to 82\% and
   did not vary between plants. Disappearance of bound fractions of
   condensed tannins was not associated with the degradability of plant
   fractions. The presence of tannins interfered with the microbial
   colonisation of plants. Each plant had distinct bacterial and archaeal
   communities after 3 and 12 h of incubation in the rumen and distinct
   protozoal communities at 3 h. Adherent communities in tannin-rich plants
   had a lower relative abundance of fibrolytic microbes, notably
   Fibrobacter spp. whereas, archaea diversity was reduced in
   high-tannin-containing Calliandra calothyrsus and Acacia nilotica at 12
   h of incubation. Concurrently, in vitro methane production was lower for
   Calliandra calothyrsus, Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala
   although for the latter total volatile fatty acids production was not
   affected and was similar to control. Here, we show that the total amount
   of hydrolysable and condensed tannins contained in a plant govern the
   interaction with rumen microbes affecting degradability and
   fermentation. The effect of protein- and fibre-bound condensed tannins
   on degradability is less important. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {While Leucaena leucocephala grows wild in Thailand, some Leucaena spp.

   species or cultivar. Environmental conditions, plant spacing, age of
   plant and cutting height significantly affected growth and performance.
   Edible forage yield was in the range of 5-6 t DM/ha/yr. Most species and
   cultivars contain high protein concentrations and are suitable for use
   as feed supplements as well as total ration for livestock. The effects
   of leucaena feeding on livestock are shown in lower mortality and
   increased productivity. While the leaf meal processing of leucaena for
   livestock feeding is increasingly recognized and practiced, cultivation
   of this crop is still minimal and insignificant. The role and importance
   of leucaena for livestock production, as well as its nutritional quality
   and factors which limit its use, are reviewed. The need for increased
   cultivation and integration of leucaena into local farming systems is
   emphasized. There is an urgent need to increase research support for the
   efficient cultivation of leucaena and an education campaign to dispel
   concerns about toxicity aspects.},

Abstract = {The objectives of the study were to investigate (1) whether
   decomposition rates of foliage differs among the multipurpose trees
   (MPTs) Leucaena leucocephala (LEL), Flemingia congesta (FLC), Pericopsis
   angolensis (PEA), Cassia siamea (CAS), Sesbania sesban (SES) and
   Gliricidia sepium (GLS), and (2) whether nitrogen (N) concentrations and
   mineralization in the foliage differ among these MPTs.
   Litter bags containing foliage from each species were arranged in a
   randomized block design with three replicates and sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8
   and 12 weeks in a repeated measures manner, after placement to determine
   decomposition and N release.
   Estimates were made of N mineralization and equations were developed for
   predicting rate of decomposition, N concentration, and N content for
   each species. Significant differences existed in decomposition rates
   (GLS > LEL = SES > CAS > PEA = FLC) and N contents (GLS = LEL > SES >
   PEA = FLC = CAS). No significant differences existed in N concentration
   between the species. Based on these results, GLS and LEL showed the
   greatest potential for use as green manures. Further studies are
   required to determine time, amounts and method of green manure
   application.},

Abstract = {One of the many control mechanisms of serine proteinases is their
   specific inhibition by protein proteinase inhibitors. An extract of
   Acacia schweinfurthii was screened for potential serine proteinase
   inhibition. It was successfully purified to homogeneity by precipitating
   with 80\% (v/v) acetone and sequential chromatographic steps, including
   ion-exchange, affinity purification and reversed-phase high performance
   liquid chromatography. Reducing sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide
   gel electrophoresis conditions revealed an inhibitor (ASTI) consisting
   of two polypeptide chains A and B of approximate molecular weights of 16
   and 10 kDa, respectively, and under non-reducing conditions, 26 kDa was
   observed. The inhibitor was shown to inhibit bovine trypsin (K-i of 3.45
   nM) at an approximate molar ratio of inhibitor: trypsin (1:1). The A-
   and B-chains revealed complete sequences of 140 and 40 amino acid
   residues, respectively. Sequence similarity (70\%) was reported between
   ASTI A-chain and ACTI A-chain (Acacia confusa) using ClustalW. The
   B-chain produced a 76\% sequence similarity between ASTI and Leucaena
   leucocephala trypsin inhibitor.},

Abstract = {Plant hydrocolloids dominate the food industry as thickeners, gelling
   agents and viscosity modifiers. These hydrocolloids are mostly sourced
   from tropic plants. Nigeria, by virtue of its location in the tropics,
   is a harbinger of these plants which are distributed across its six
   ecological zones, from the mangrove rain forest to the arid zone. These
   hydrocolloid-rich plants are under-utilized having only served as
   thickeners in local cuisines. Lack of information on the properties of
   the hydrocolloids from these plants has made them to remain largely
   commercially unexplored.
   Among the plants studied are Brachystigia eurycoma, Prosopis africana,
   Afzelia africana, Mucuna flagellipes, Detarium microcarpum, Adansonia
   digitata, Irvingia gabonensis, Gliricidia sepium, Peltrophorum
   pterocarpum, Bauhinia monandra, Cola milleni, Caesalpinea pulcherrima,
   Delonix regia and Leucaena leucocephala.
   This study evaluates the potential of these plants as sources of
   industrial hydrocolloids. We have examined the endosperm-seed ratio,
   yield, rheological and molecular properties of the hydrocolloids. Our
   results show that some of these hydrocolloids possess novel properties
   which can be exploited in the food industry.},

Abstract = {To identify non-wood fast-growing species utilizable for pulp and paper

   properties of the pulp produced from these varieties were also evaluated
   as functions of the following parameters: NaOH solubles, alcohol-benzene

   holocellulose.
   The study confirms the feasibility of the MD-organocell pulping process
   for Leucaena varieties. MD-organocell pulping provides an efficient
   delignification. In this process, the operation temperature, among

Abstract = {The response of corn (Zea mays) to incorporated leaf and twig mulches of

   Grevillea robusta as a non-legume comparison was investigated in a
   10-week pot trial and a concurrent soil incubation study to evaluate the
   suitability of various agroforestry trees as mulch sources. Leucaena
   contributed to the highest N uptake and biomass production of these com
   plants, reflecting the benefits of organic mulching. Cassia-treated
   plants also performed better than the unmulched controls, but Grevillea
   incorporation suppressed corn growth probably because of the relatively
   high Mn status of this mulch. Manganese toxicity was confirmed by
   comparative vector diagnosis of plant nutrient status. Cliricidia
   mulching resulted in seedling mortality after germination possibly from
   high soil pH and ammonium toxicity. Mineral N production in mulched
   soils during the laboratory incubation was well correlated with N uptake
   in corn shoots. The results suggest that the nutritional effects of
   agroforestry tree mulches on growth of companion crops may be
   effectively screened by a combined soil test, pot trial, and plant

Abstract = {Twelve taxa under exploration as bioenergy crops in Florida and the U.S.

   Arundo donax, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus grandis, Jatropha

   communis were found to have a high probability of becoming invasive,

   probability of becoming invasive. Eucalyptus amplifolia requires further
   evaluation before a prediction is possible. These results are consistent
   with reports on other tests of these taxa. Given the economic and
   ecological impacts of invasive species, including the carbon expended

Abstract = {A range of nitrogen fixing trees (NFTs) from the genera Acacia, Albizia,
   Calliandra, Gliricidia, Leucaena, and Sesbania have shown considerable
   potential as fodder species in livestock production systems throughout
   the world. In Asia and Africa, these species are often used by
   smallholders largely under cut-and-carry management to provide
   high-quality feed to supplement other poorer quality fodders. In
   Australia and parts of South America, species such as Leucaena
   leucocephala have been planted in extensive systems in combination with
   pasture grasses to increase the carrying capacity and productivity of
   grazing cattle. Research and development efforts have concentrated on
   broadening the resource base by evaluating a greater range of germplasm,
   defining their environmental and edaphic limitations, and developing
   optimum management strategies and production systems that capitalize on
   the advantages and unique characteristics of these species. This paper
   examines the role and potential of NFTs in livestock production systems,
   outlines the areas of current research focus, and highlights some of the

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is a nutritionally rich forage tree legume that
   contains a toxic non-protein amino acid, mimosine, from which other
   toxic compounds 3,4-dihydroxypyridone (3,4-DHP) and 2,3-DHP are formed
   in the rumen. The rumen bacterium Synergistes jonesii is able to degrade
   these DHP isomers into non-toxic end products. In this study we
   developed new PCR-based assays to improve the specificity and
   sensitivity of detection of S. jonesii in the rumen. Using these new
   assays in a survey of ruminants from different countries, S. jonesii
   appeared to be ubiquitous rather than isolated geographically. The
   bacterium was present as a minor population (<10(6) cells/mL) in the
   rumen and was usually comprised of several genetic variants of the
   species. Although the indigenous nature of S. jonesii could imply
   animals are protected from toxicity, the relative abundance of the
   bacterium, potential variation in DHP-degrading ability of genetic
   variants, and amount of leucaena in the diet may determine the ability
   of the resident population in the rumen to protect the animal from
   toxicity.},

Abstract = {To evaluate the in vitro digestibility of forage legume from semi-arid
   northeast region using caecal inoculum liquor of ostriches with Reverse
   Tilley and Terry technique, the alfalfa hay (Medicago sativa) was used
   as reference food for comparison between hays of canephori (Senna
   multijuga), clitoria (Clitoria ternatea), leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala), kills pasture (Senna obtusifolia) and thrush (Mimosa
   caesalpiniifolia). There was, by Duncan test (P<0.05), significant
   difference to in vitro digestibility of the nutritional fractions among
   the legume hays resulting in general mean value of 49.62\% for dry
   matter (DIVMS), of 23.38\% for crude protein (DIVPB), of 17.88\% for
   insoluble protein in neutral detergent fiber (DIVPIDN), of 34.52\% for
   neutral detergent fiber (DIVFDN) and of 42.07\% for neutral detergent
   fiber corrected for ash and protein (DIVFDNcp). The nutritional
   composition of feedstuffs influenced the fermentative activity of
   microorganisms from cecum-colon of ostriches in these in vitro
   incubations, and the better digestibility values were observed for
   alfalfa hay, followed by kills pasture and leucaena hays, wich were
   higher than other legumes from semi-arid.},

Abstract = {The effect of three frequencies of defoliation (8, 12, and 16 weeks) on
   the yield and quality of Gliricidia sepium, Erythrina indica, and
   Leucaena leucocephala were investigated. Total dry matter (DM) yields of
   G. sepium, L, leucocephala, and E, indica increased significantly with
   longer intervals of defoliation. In spite of declining edible portion as
   a percentage of fresh yield with increasing maturity, the edible DM
   yields (EDMY) also increased, especially in G. sepium and L.
   leucocephala due to greater increase in total DM yields, When the EDMY
   were considered, G, sepium performed equally as well as L. leucocephala.
   Edible crude protein and digestible DM yields were positively related to
   EDMY and G. sepium performed best among the three species. Considering
   the most important yield and quality criteria, the best species was G.
   sepium when defoliated at 16 weeks. In order to reduce the wastage of
   forages and to obtain maximum yield and nutritive value of these three
   legumes, the species characteristics have to be considered together with
   the frequency of defoliations.},

Abstract = {Attributes of the shrub and tree species components of the tropical

   Within the quadrant, the species of all individuals of the tree and
   shrub species greater than 150 cm were identified, not taking into
   account the Cactaceae and Succulents. Measurements were made of the
   trees: basal diameter, diameter at breast height, total tree height,
   canopy height and diameter; carbon capture by species was estimated
   taking into account the climatic site variables, where they grow.
   Twenty-two species of shrubs and trees were observed, with Acacia
   schaffneri, Bursera fagaroides, Forestiera phillyreoides, Karwinskia
   humboldtiana, Dodonaea viscosa and Ipomea murucoides being the most
   abundant, while the ones with the highest carbon content are species
   such as: Prosopis laevigata and Leucaena leucocephala and the less
   abundant were Randia thurberi and Erytrina coralloides. These results
   are indispensable for developing and designing proposals for
   reforestation and conservation of the tropical deciduous forest.},

Abstract = {During recent decades, a considerable number of alien species have been
   brought into Taiwan and have caused significant impacts to local
   ecosystems and biodiversity. High resolution satellite imagery can
   provide detailed spatial characteristics over a large area and has a
   great potential for accurate vegetation mapping. However, most
   traditional multispectral image classification techniques focus on
   spectral discrimination of ground objects and may overlook useful
   spatial information provided by hi-h resolution images. To achieve the
   best result, analysis of high resolution imagery should also incorporate
   spatial variations of the data. Therefore, this paper has looked into
   using a texture augmented procedure to analyze a high resolution
   satellite (QuickBird) image in order to detect an invasive plant species
   (Leucaena leucocephala) in southern Taiwan. Samples of primary
   vegetation covers were selected from the image to determine suitable
   texture analysis parameters for extracting texture features helpful for
   classification. Validation with ground truth data showed that the
   analysis produced high accuracies in detecting the target plant species
   and overall classification for primary vegetation types within the study
   site.},

Abstract = {Since the last 30 years lignin has been subjected to an intensive
   investigation due to its unique structure that makes it useful for many
   applications, including polymer synthesis, obtaining of value added
   chemicals or as an additive with interesting properties. In this work a
   series of 4 black liquors from different origin, including kraft liquor
   from pine (pinus radiata), soda liquors from flax (linum usitatissimum),
   this one using anthraquinone as catalyst, and grapevine (Vitis vinifera)
   vineshoot, and another one from wild tamarind (leucaena leucocephala)
   extracted by the organosolv Alcell method, have been subjected to
   chemical treatments in order to isolate different types of lignin.
   Subsequently, these lignins have been characterized using Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FT IR) and H-1-NMR to analyse the
   chemical structure, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) for determining
   molecular weight (MW) and molecular weight distribution (MWD) and
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to analyse the thermal degradation.
   Results show that kraft pine lignin has higher molecular weight and
   hydroxyl groups' content than the other samples, what seems to be
   related to its higher content in guaiacyl-type units.},

Abstract = {Seedlings is the initial part of seed plant's growth and development
   including areca nut palm which germination is an essential part of it.
   Organic mulching is one of the utmost sustainable practices, therefore,
   it has been employed to enhance areca nut seedlings growth. The study
   aims to evaluate the effect of several types of organic mulch on areca
   nut seedlings shoot-root growth. The 3-month long experiment was
   conducted according to completely randomized design, with four
   treatments, namely no mulching (control) (M0), gliricidia ( Gliricidia
   sepium) ) mulching (M1), imperata ( Imperata cylindrica) ) mulching (M2)
   and lamtoro ( Leucaena leucocephala) ) mulching (M3). The treatments
   were repeated 5 times with 20 experimental units. The findings revealed
   that no significant differences (p < 0.05) were found on the application
   of different organic mulching among all of the parameters. The treatment
   covered by imperata mulch tended to score the highest compared to other
   mulches on germination time, seedling height and shoot fresh weight
   while the minimum yield was recorded in M1 where gliricidia mulch was
   used. Application of organic mulch displayed better results for most of
   the parameters than that of the control resulting from an optimal
   growing environment for areca nut seedlings growth.},

Abstract = {Twenty-one plantings of 24 accessions of 18 promising forage species

   potential under regular cutting and grazing. Observational methods were
   used to obtain data. At the seven upper Belize River Valley sites,
   Leucaena leucocephala and Codariocalyx gyroides had the best
   performance, followed by Calopogonium caeruleum, Centrosema plumieri and
   C. pubescens. At the four Low Pine Ridge sites the plants most
   consistently successful across the sites and fertilizer levels were the
   S. guianensis accessions and C. gyroides. However, C. caeruleum, C.
   pubescens and D. intortum, under the high fertilizer rate generally
   persisted and performed very well. On the Mountain Pine Ridge soils,
   performance at the three sites was poor without the application of marl.
   The most productive legumes were C. gyroides, D. intortum, P.
   phaseoloides and S. guianensis cv. Endeavour. The other S. guianensis
   lines also performed well at most sites and fertilizer levels, as did C.
   pubescens. M. atropurpureum performed best under the higher fertilizer

Abstract = {Nutrients released from tree prunings sustain alley cropping. Potassium
   (K) uptake and utilization efficiency were monitored over 16 months in
   Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Albizia lebbeck. Tree
   interspecific variation arose in biomass yields and K nutrition. Tissue
   potassium concentration narrowed within 0.68-1.15\% and varied little
   among tree parts and species over time. Potassium accumulation increased
   steadily with tree age and significant differences among trees occurred
   at all ages. Gliricidia sepium had a higher yield than the others over
   the first 8 months, after which the uptake pattern declined drastically
   to become the lowest at harvest. Differential K partitioning within
   trees occurred as K in leaves, stems, and roots amounted to 18, 35, and
   47\% in Albizia; 28, 25, and 47\% in Gliricidia; and 27, 42, and 31\% in
   Leucaena, respectively. Higher K allocation into Leucaena stems and its
   low partitioning into Albizia leaves were drawbacks for alley cropping.
   Potassium utilization efficiency decreased inversely to biomass yield
   and K uptake over time. It differed significantly among trees with
   Albizia being the most efficient. Low K returns from tree prunings in
   alley cropping could be due to its uptake potential and partitioning
   impairment in each species.},

   either acid or alkaline reactions, an effect that is dependent only on
   the N-source (NH4+ or NO3-). Uptake preferences of the fast-growing
   Leucaena isolate (UMKL 19) resembled those of the slow-growing rhizobia,
   further strengthenig the argument that this organism (and others like

Abstract = {The N, P and K balance was studied in a 52.4 ha dairy farm on a brown

   nlemfuensis (60\%), P. purpureum CT-115 clone (40\%)., L. leucocephala
   and C. cajans were intercropped in 28\% of the grass area. The herd had
   114 cows, 35 heifers and 24 calves, with a total yearly milk production
   of 100 000 litres. In general, the system showed a negative balance in
   the three elements (-28, -11 and -39 kg/ha/year of N, P and K,
   respectively), since 40\% of excretions were left in the shade pens and
   milking parlour and were not recycled in the grassland. On the other
   hand, there was also a negative balance of these nutrients in the soil
   component with values of -103, -22 and -76, kg/ha of N, P and K,
   respectively, mainly due to high extraction of these elements by the
   pasture. Values found in the different recycling rates are discussed.
   These are: litter, pasture remobilization, excretion, volatization and
   others. The return of all the excretion to the grassland ecosystem is
   recommended as well as increasing the area with legumes to attain a
   satisfactory balance in these nutrients. Further studies must consider
   maintenance fertilization, nutrient losses due to leaching and
   denitrification, as well as the variation of the stable OM in the soil

   from parent material are compared with data from putative hybrids and
   shown to be similar. The origin of these hybrids is discussed and shown
   to be the result of artificial sympatry resulting from indigenous, and
   recent exotic, domestication of the parent species. The hybrid is

Abstract = {Background: Vernonia amygdalina (leaf), Garcinia kola (seed), and
   Leucaena leucocephala (seed) are three well-known tropical plants used
   in African ethnomedicine to reduce parasitic worm burdens and are
   potential sources of alternative solution for controlling parasitic
   helminths infection in grazing livestock. This study investigated
   extracts from these plants for anthelmintic activity against adult
   Haemonchus placei, an haematophagous nematode from cattle abomasa.
   Powdered plant materials were macerated in acetone and the crude acetone
   extracts evaluated for anthelmintic activity using H. placei adult worm
   motility assay. Afterwards, fresh sample of V. amygdalina was macerated
   successively in chloroform and acetone and the extracts evaluated for
   anthelmintic activity. The chloroform extract was subjected to
   phytochemical and FT-IR analyses and fractionated by vacuum liquid
   chromatography. Anthelmintic data were fitted to a nonlinear regression
   equation (Log {[}extract or fraction] vs. lethality; variable slope) to
   produce best-fit sigmoidal curves and LC50 values computed with
   associated uncertainty.
   Results: Of the three tropical plants, only V. amygdalina was active
   against adult H. placei with best-fit LC50 of 6.51 mg/mL (95\% CI:
   5.32-7.75). Evaluation of the two extracts obtained by successive
   maceration showed that chloroform extract (LC50, 2.46 mg/mL, 95\% CI:
   1.87-3.28) was 11 times as potent as acetone extract (LC50, 27.01 mg/
   mL, 95\% CI: 21.32-48.57) (a <0.0001). Chromatographic fractionation of
   the chloroform extract yielded four fractions (FA-FD) with FB (LC50,
   2.38 mg/mL, 95\% CI: 1.76-3.28) 2.19 times as potent as FC (LC50, 5.21
   mg/mL, 95\% CI: 4.40-5.79) against H. placei, while FA and FD were
   inactive. Phytochemical evaluation of the chloroform extract revealed
   the presence of saponins, steroids, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, and
   the absence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and anthraquinones. FT-IR
   structural analysis of chloroform extract indicated the presence of key
   functional groups which are chemical fragments/ structural motifs known
   to be present in the two major classes of bioactive compounds
   (sesquiterpene lactones and steroid glucosides) reportedly to be found
   in V . amygdalina.
   Conclusions: The findings showed that chloroform extract of V.
   amygdalina leaf possessed relatively good anthelmintic activity against
   adult H. placei. This could be indicative of its potential usefulness as
   an anthelmintic phytomedicine to control gastrointestinal nematodes
   infection in cattle.},

Abstract = {Large areas of the Chhattisgarh region of Madhya Pradesh in India ape
   barren and remain unutilized. The dominant soil of this area is an
   entisol (red laterite). Due to the low water-holding capacity and
   nutrient. status of this soil, its productivity is extremely low. The
   region experiences fodder scarcity throughout the year; this is most
   severe during the summer months. Planting of multipurpose tree species
   on these lands can increase its productivity and help to overcome fodder
   scarcity. This was examined in a study involving Albizia lebbeck,
   Albizia procera, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia sissoo, Dendrocalamus
   strictus, Hard wickia binata, Leucaena leucocephala, and Zizyphus
   mauritiana. The species were established either as a block plantation or
   as an energy plantation. The survival and growth performance after 2-4
   years showed that many of these species could be grown successfully on
   the entisol of the Chhattisgarh region. Among them, H. binata and L.
   leucocephala performed better than others in the block plantation. The
   results comparing the potential of nitrogen fixing trees (NFTs) with
   other tree species are discussed in this paper.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the soil pollution level and evaluated the
   phytoremediation potential of 25 native plant species on a former gold
   mine-tailing site in Ghana. Plant shoots and associated soil samples
   were collected from a tailing deposition site and analyzed for total
   element concentration of As, Hg, Pb, and Cu. Soil metal(loid) content,
   bioaccumulation factor (BAF(shoots)), and hyperaccumulator thresholds
   were also determined to assess the current soil pollution level and
   phytoextraction potential. The concentration of As and Hg in the soil
   was above international risk thresholds, while that of Pb and Cu were
   below those thresholds. None of the investigated plant species reached
   absolute hyperaccumulator standard concentrations. Bioavailability of
   sampled metal(loid)s in the soil was generally low due to high pH,
   organic matter, and clay content. However, for Cu, relatively high
   bioaccumulation values (BAF(shoots) > 1) were found for 12 plant
   species, indicating the potential for selective heavy-metal extraction
   via phytoremediation by those plants. The high levels of As at the study
   site constitute an environmental and health risk but there is the
   potential for phytoextraction of Cu (e.g., Aspilia africana) and
   reclamation by afforestation using Leucaena leucocephala and Senna
   siamea.},

Abstract = {Since its introduction to India in 1976 Leucaena leucocephala ssp.
   glabrata has spread rapidly, especially in the last couple of decades,
   mainly due to its use as either firewood or pulpwood. Use of its foliage
   for feeding livestock has been mainly a by-product of this activity. The
   foliage is highly nutritious because it has high protein concentration
   and good palatability, and the tree can withstand repeated defoliation.
   Research carried out by Indian scientists on leucaena has focused on
   mainly agronomic management, agroforestry studies of mixed cropping
   systems, mimosine toxicity, germplasm testing and economic evaluation.
   Feeding leucaena has had a positive impact on the dairy industry in
   particular. It is rarely purchased for fodder and is usually poached by
   smallholders from existing plantations, most of which are established by
   animal rearers for their own purposes. More widespread use of leucaena
   for fodder could be achieved in India by introducing varieties with
   either reduced seed production or sterile ones, which can be easily
   propagated vegetatively. In addition, psyllid resistance, suitable
   mechanized harvesting methods and training livestock owners in proper
   management of leucaena trees should help in making this high quality
   fodder more popular in India.},

Abstract = {Below ground biomass is a major determinant of soil carbon (C) storage
   in semi-arid ecosystem. An extended laboratory incubation study for a
   period of 323 days was carried out to ascertain the decomposition
   kinetics of fine roots of major trees (Jatropha curcas, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica and Prosopis
   juliflora) and a grass species (Cenchrus ciliaris) in the semi-arid
   region of India with the hypothesis that species with a slower
   decomposition rate will increase stability of soil organic carbon and
   will have higher potential to rehabilitate degraded sites in terms of
   soil quality. The results were confirmed by analyzing biochemically
   stabilized carbon pool of soils under different species. Decay constant
   (k) for fine roots carbon ranged from 0.14 to 0.21 year(-1) under
   different tree species and followed the order; Acacia > Jatropha >
   Grass- C. ciliaris > Leucaena > Azadirachta > Prosopis. Acid
   non-hydrolysable C (biochemically stabilized C pool) of soil was maximum
   in P. juliflora (1.84 g kg(-1)) followed by Azadirachta (1.79 g kg(-1)).
   Results emanating from the present investigation suggest that fine roots
   of A. indica have greater carbon stabilization potential than other
   species of the region.},

   liquid chromatography with refractive index detection (HPLC-RI). The
   proximate analysis showed a high content of protein, especially in
   Lupinus species. The total a-galactoside content ranged from 18.6 mg
   g(-1) (A. pennatula) to 88.1 mg g(-1) (P. dulce). With the exception of
   E. cyclocarpum, in which raffinose content (49.0 mg g(-1)) was the
   highest stachyose and verbascose were the dominant oligosaccharides

Abstract = {The present study was carried out to determine the effect of Acacia
   nilotica, a tropical plant rich in hydrolyzable tannins (HT), on rumen
   fermentation and methane (CH4) production in vitro. We used leaves and
   pods from A. nilotica alone and combined. The combination of HT from A.
   nilotica leaves and pods and condensed tannins (CT) from Calliandra
   calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala were also evaluated to assess
   potential differences in biological activity between HT and CT. Four
   series of 24-h incubations were performed using rumen contents of 4
   sheep fed a tropical grass (natural grassland based on Dichanthium
   spp.). A first experiment tested different levels of replacement of this
   tropical forage (control {[}CTL] without tannins) by A. nilotica leaves
   or pods: 0:100, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25 and 100:0. A second experiment
   tested the mixture of A. nilotica leaves and pods in different
   proportions: 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100. A third experiment
   tested the 50:50 combination of A. nilotica leaves or pods with C.
   calothyrsus and L. leucocephala. Acacia nilotica pods and leaves had a
   high content of HT (350 and 178 g/kg DM, respectively), whereas C.
   calothyrsus and L. leucocephala had a high content of CT (361 and 180 g/
   kg DM, respectively). The inclusion of HT from A. nilotica leaves and
   pods decreased CH4 production dose-dependently (P < 0.01). Total
   replacement of the CTL by A. nilotica decreased CH4 production by 64 and
   55\% with leaves and pods, respectively. Pods were richer in HT than
   leaves, but their antimethanogenic effect did not differ (P > 0.05).
   Although A. nilotica leaves and pods inhibited fermentation, as
   indicated by the lower gas production and VFA production (P < 0.01),
   this effect was less pronounced than for CH4. Volatile fatty acid
   production decreased by 12\% in leaves and by 30\% in pods when compared
   with the CTL alone. Positive associative effect was reported for VFA,
   when HT-rich sources and CT-rich sources were mixed. Combining the 2
   sources of HT did not show associative effects on fermentation or CH4
   production (P > 0.05). Hydrolyzable tannin-rich sources were more
   effective in suppressing methanogenesis than CT-rich sources. Our
   results show that HT-rich A. nilotica leaves and pods have the potential
   to reduce ruminal CH4 production.},

   net returns of Rs. 17066 against Rs. 7852 ha.-1 yr.-1 from double
   cropped agricultural system. The intercropping of cluster beans with
   leucaena gave the highest net returns of Rs. 3540 ha.-1 yr.-1 in the
   agri-silvicultural system adopted on class II land. Eucalyptus
   tereticornis (Smith) in top and Bhabbar grass (Eulaliopsis binata Retz)
   in the understorey on a sandy loam class III land gave four years
   (1985-1988) mean air dry grass yield of 4.2 (used for paper pulp) from

   returns from grass alone were Rs. 4672 against Rs. 1679 ha.-1 yr.-1 from
   rainfed field crops raised on an adjoining plot. The returns from trees
   would be additional. Bhabbar grass raised under Acacia species on a 25

   an herbaceous legume; Brachiaria brizantha, a perennial grass; Leucaena
   leucocephala, a legume shrub; Solanum rugosum, a non-legume shrub) were
   used in a field experiment and communities of all combinations of one,

   significantly affected density and diversity of soil macrofauna nor
   total plant biomass, however, the biomass of specific plants was
   negatively affected by plant diversity. Earthworm and ant densities were
   significantly higher in the presence of A. pintoi although this plant
   influenced neither the density of the other group nor fauna diversity.
   Earthworm and diplopod densities increased significantly with shoot
   biomass of A. pintoi. Fauna diversity increased significantly with shoot
   biomass (specific and total). Root biomass did not affect fauna density
   and diversity. Our results suggest that fauna density is affected by
   titter quality and that it is more affected by resource quantity than
   quality. Our results also confirm the importance of nitrogen fixers to

Abstract = {Nitrogen, Ca and Mg release from leaves of ten selected plant residues
   with varying chemical compositions was studied under laboratory
   conditions. Three patterns of N-release were observed over a seven week

   pruriens and Centrosema pubescens leaves showed rapid N release, (b)
   Acioa barteri and Dialium guineense leaves immobilized N, and (c)
   Alchornea cordifolia, Anthonata macrophylla, Cassia siamea and
   Pterocarpus santalinoides leaves initially showed N immobilization which
   gradually changes to net mineralization after about four weeks of
   incubation. Nitrogen mineralization rate constant (k) ranged from
   -0.0018 (A. barteri) to 0.0064 day-1 (G. sepium). Statistical analysis
   of data showed that N mineralization rate constants are significantly
   correlated with initial N, polyphenol and lignin contents of leaves.
   Nitrogen release increased with increasing N content and decreased with
   increasing contents of polyphenols and lignin.
   Addition of leaves from all species significantly increased soil
   exchangeable Ca and Mg levels. L. leucocephala, G. sepium, C. pubescens
   and M. pruriens showed relatively high Ca and Mg release rates. Calcium
   release rate was related to N release rate rather than to initial Ca

Abstract = {This research aimed to test particleboard with leucena (Leucaena

   The response variables are: modulus of rupture (MOR), internal adhesion

   experiments were developed based on the methodological procedures of the
   ABNT NBR 14810: 2002 standard. The particleboards were manufactured by
   hot-pressing at 4MPa and 90 degrees C, using timber particles with 5\%
   of moisture content and 10\% of monocomponent and bicomponent
   polyurethane resin. The higher moisture content was achieved when the
   monocomponent polyurethane resin was used. The bicomponent polyurethane
   resin provided a percent increase of 43.7\% and 22.7\% on the modulus of
   rupture and apparent density, respectively, when compared to the
   standard limit. The internal adhesion of the panels manufactured with
   monocomponent resin was 2.45 times higher than the standard limit. The
   confidence interval between means revealed that the internal adhesion
   and apparent density exhibited statistical equivalence. A good
   correlation between the internal adhesion and apparent density was
   found, for this reason it was possible to estimate the internal adhesion
   of the panels based on the apparent density data.},

Abstract = {This part introduces quantitative studies on the impacts of invasive
   alien animals and plants on native ecosystems on the Bonin Islands.
   Predation by alien predatory flatworms such as Platydemus manokwari has
   caused the rapid decline or extinction of many endemic land snails. In
   addition, predation by black rats can cause micro-evolutionary changes
   in shell morphology and habitat use of endemic land snails. Feral cats
   prey upon land birds as well as seabirds characteristic to the Bonin
   Islands. An introduced lizard, the green anole (Anolis carolinensis),
   has caused serious damage to many insect populations, resulting in
   changes in the pollination systems of many native plants. Grazing and
   trampling by feral goats has caused destruction of vegetation, leading
   to accelerated soil erosion on some islands. An alien tree, Bischofia
   javanica, has replaced native trees due to its greater survival and
   seedling growth than those of native tree species. Invasion and
   dominance of an exotic shrub, Leucaena leucocephala, have prevented the
   establishment of some native woody species. Scientific understanding of
   the impacts of invasive species and their interactions with native
   species is essential for conservation and restoration of the native
   Bonin Island ecosystems.},

   Green manuring with Sesbania gave the highest rice yield, whereas lowest
   yields were recorded with wheat straw incorporation. The organic manures
   had significant residual effect on succeeding wheat and the highest
   yields were recorded with FYM. The percent increase over no organic

Abstract = {To test flying fox adaptations to a habitat mosaic with extreme
   deforestation, the abundance, habitat choice and feeding behavior of the
   Pacific flying fox, Pteropus tonganus, were investigated across 16
   islands of the Yasawa archipelago, Fiji. The habitat mosaic is formed by
   4.3 percent tropical dry forest and 3.3 percent farmland, leaving exotic
   grasslands and stands of Leucaena leucocephala to overrun the vast
   majority of land. Pteropus tonganus abundance was high (5757 bats)
   despite deforestation and hunting. Roosting sites were restricted to
   native forest fragments. Grasslands and stands of L. leucocephala were
   completely void of bats at all times. The mean foraging density in
   farmland was four times higher than in forests and foraging competition
   was routinely observed in farmland but was extremely rare in forests.
   The author suggests that during the study, extensive foraging in
   farmland was supporting the high P. tonganus population. Additionally,
   the preferential foraging in farmland was responsible for the low
   foraging densities within forests and dramatically less intraspecies
   competition for forest resources. Further research is needed on seed
   dispersal within forests and to test for seasonal variations in bat
   abundance and feeding.},

   codes, respectively. The acceptability of the MPN data obtained for a
   host species was related to rooting habit and time to nodulation.
   Comparison of data for each soil indicated that, despite large
   differences in characteristics, the soil was not a major source of
   variability in the MPN counts. There was no significant interaction of

Abstract = {The development of dependable, environmentally benign methods for the
   synthesis of nanoscale material is an important concern of
   nanotechnology. In this work, it explores and finds the synthesis of
   highly dispersed silver nanoparticles (Ag-NP's) with the help of
   Leucaena Leucocephala leaf extract (LLLE) as reducing agent. The
   synthesized Ag-NP's was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV-vis Spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) studies, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).
   Moreover, the synthesized Ag-NP's show the circular shape with average
   particle size of 40 nm. Also the synthesized Ag-NP's show better
   activity towards degradation of aqueous hexavalent chromium solution
   under visible light irradiation. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (B.E.T) surface
   area analysis was done to explain the photodegtadation of chromium in
   aqueous solution. The short term invitro cytotoxicity of the
   biosynthesized Ag-NP's was tested against DLA cell lines using trypan
   blue dye exclusion technique and thus the synthesized Ag-NP's show 100\%
   inhibition with concentration of 100 mu g/ml. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The interaction of Heteropsylla cubana with Chilocorus cacti and

   the prey when reaching one of the balance points. The points obtained
   when calculating the isoclines were: (0, 0, 0) the absence of

   and Entada abyssinica proved to be good pruning sources in the pot
   trial. G. robusta, A. polyacantha, A. nilotica and E. abyssinica had
   adverse effects on wheat seedlings with increased pruning loads probably
   due to immobilization processes or allelopathic effects. N and lignin
   content, C/N ratio, lignin/N ratio, phenolics/N ratio and (phenolics +
   lignin)/N ratio of the pruning material were all significantly
   correlated with shoot dry matter production of the wheat seedlings. With
   the exception of Entada abyssinica, which performed well under field
   conditions, a similar ranking as in the pot trial was established in the

Abstract = {It is well documented that a bioengineering approach has recently
   regained a global recognition in preventing and controlling surface
   run-off, erosion and landslides. However, there is a lack of
   documentation on the root mechanical properties available especially in
   Malaysia. In this study, both pull-out and tensile strength of some
   tropical plants namely Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia mangium and
   Melastoma malabathricum is investigated on different stem sizes. Plots
   of pull-out capacity against displacement in L. leucocephala exhibit the
   presence of two peak values. Closer examination concludes that the first
   peak indicates the failure of the lateral roots and the second peaks is
   achieved when the tap roots failed. As for the tensile strength tests,
   results showed that the tensile strength decreases with increasing root
   diameter. The results also indicate that there is no correlation
   observed between the tensile strength, root length and root moisture
   content. Amongst the species, the highest root tensile strength was
   observed in L. leucocephala, followed by A. mangium and M.
   malabathricum. Thus, the study suggests that L. leucocephala is the best
   choice for slope stabilization work as it exhibits outstanding root
   mechanical properties.},

Abstract = {The role of microarthropods in leaf decomposition and N release was

   Pueraria phaseoloides relay cropping, Leucaena leucocephala alley
   cropping, and cropping without cover crop or tree hedgerows (control
   treatment), using litterbags with mesh-size of 0.5 mm and 0.08 mm for 98
   days. Litterbags with 0.5 mm mesh-size allowed access by
   microarthropods, whereas those with 0.08 mm mesh-size excluded
   microarthropods. Microarthropod-mediated leaf decomposition and N
   release varied with the land-use practices, particularly the last named.
   Inclusion of microarthropods in most cases increased leaf decomposition
   and N release rates, with the highest value 38 \% for decomposition in
   control treatment and 29 \% for N release in relay cropping. A decrease
   in leaf decomposition rate (10 \%) and N release (32 \%) was observed in
   the secondary forest. Microarthropod-mediated leaf decomposition and N
   release, which mainly occurred in later stages of decomposition,
   increased as microbial decomposition decreased. The results suggest that
   microarthropods have a ``buffering effect{''} in regulating leaf
   decomposition and N release, which is mediated by land-use history.},

   intensities of solar radiation for two sessions of the day). Grazing
   behavior was affected by the interaction between the factors. The
   grazing-walking activity was greater in the grazing areas with the
   lowest level of solar radiation ( Leucaena and Manguifera ) with 217.50

   were lower in the afternoon session, with the lowest result in grazing
   in the sun (108.05 minutes). The reduction of solar radiation under the
   tree canopy favored the behavioral behavior of the sheep, this allowed
   the animals to carry out rest and rumination activities under the shade
   of the trees, with more preference in the afternoon session.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this work was to study the genetic diversity of the
   nodule-forming bacteria associated with native populations of Vachellia
   gummifera growing wild in Morocco. The nearly complete 16S rRNA gene
   sequences from three selected strains, following ARDRA and REP-PCR
   results, revealed they were members of the genus Ensifer and the
   sequencing of the housekeeping genes recA, gyrB, dnaK and rpoB, and
   their concatenated phylogenetic analysis, showed that the 3 strains
   belong to the species E. fredii. Based on the nodC and nodA phylogenies,
   the 3 strains clearly diverged from the type and other reference strains
   of E. fredii and formed a clearly separated cluster. The strains AGA1,
   AGA2 and AGB23 did not form nodules on Glycine max, Phaseolus vulgaris
   and Medicago truncatula, and effectively nodulated V. gummifera, Acacia
   cyanophylla, Prosopis chilensis and Leucaena leucocephala. Based on
   similarities of the nodC and nodA symbiotic genes and differences in the
   host range, the strains isolated from Moroccan endemic V. gummifera may
   form a different symbiovar within Ensifer species, for which the name

Abstract = {A novel Mesorhizobium group associated with Albizia kalkora {[}Wang et
   aL (2006), Syst Appl Microbiol 29, 502-517] was further characterized.
   The seven strains in this group showed similar protein patterns and were
   different from defined Mesorhizobium species in SDS-PAGE of whole-cell
   proteins. The representative strain CCBAU 61158(T) formed a novel
   Mesorhizobium lineage in phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA, atpD, g1n11
   and nifH genes. However, its nodC gene sequence was more similar to that
   of Rhizobium gallicum R602sp(T) than to those of Mesorhizobium species.
   DNA-DNA relatedness between CCBAU 61158(T) and reference strains of
   defined Mesorhizobium species was lower than 34.1 \%. These results
   indicated that this Mesorhizobium group was a unique genomic species.
   The subtropical distribution, host origin, PCR-RFLP patterns of 16S rRNA
   genes, fatty acid profile and a series of phenotypic characteristics
   could be used as distinctive features of this group, This group is
   therefore proposed as a novel species, Mesorhizobium albiziae sp. nov.,
   with CCBAU 61158(T) (= LMG 23507(T) =USDA 4964(T)) as the type strain.
   Strain CCBAU 61158(T) could form effective nodules on Albizia
   julibrissin, Glycine max, Leucaena leucocephala and Phaseolus vulgaris.},

Year = {1991},
Volume = {173},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 produces large amounts of acidic
   exopolysaccharide.  Mutants that fail to synthesize this
   exopolysaccharide are also unable to nodulate the host plant Leucaena
   leucocephala.  A hybrid strain of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 containing
   exo genes from Rhizobium meliloti was constructed.  The background
   genetics and nod genes of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 are retained, but
   the cluster of genes involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis was
   deleted.  These exo genes were replaced with genes required for the
   synthesis of succinoglycan exopolysaccharide from R. meliloti.  As a
   result of the genetic manipulation, the ability of these hybrids to
   synthesize exopolysaccharide was restored, but the structure was that of
   succinoglycan and not that of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234.  The
   replacement genes were contained on a cosmid which encoded the entire
   known R. meliloti exo gene cluster, with the exception of exoB.  Cosmids
   containing smaller portions of this exo gene cluster did not restore
   exopolysaccharide production.  The presence of succinoglycan was
   indicated by staining with the fluorescent dye Calcofluor, proton
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and monosaccharide analysis. 
   Although an NGR234 exoY mutant containing the R. meliloti exo genes
   produced multitimers of the succinoglycan repeat unit, as does the
   wild-type R. meliloti, the deletion mutant of Rhizobium sp. strain
   NGR234 containing the R. meliloti exo genes produced only the monomer. 
   The deletion mutant therefore appeared to lack a function that affects
   the multiplicity of succinoglycan produced in the Rhizobium sp. strain
   NGR234 background.  Although these hybrid strains produced
   succinoglycan, they were still able to induce the development of an
   organized nodule structure on L. leucocephala.  The resulting nodules
   did not fix nitrogen, but they did contain infection threads and
   bacteroids within plant cells.  This clearly demonstrated that a
   heterologous acidic exopolysaccharide structure was sufficient to enable
   nodule development to proceed beyond the developmental barrier imposed
   on mutants of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 that are unable to synthesize
   any acidic exopolysaccharide.},

Abstract = {Background: Dry Forest can be recovered with restoration plantings.
   Selection of tree species for restoration plantings depends on its
   successful performance under the adverse conditions of degraded areas.
   Hypotheses: Early-successional legume species have higher survival in
   degraded areas.
   Studied species: Twelve native tree species from the dry forest.
   Study site and dates: Pastures excluded from cattle ranching activities
   in Quilamula, Tlaquiltenango, Morelos, Mexico for 28 months, from July
   2017 to October 2019.
   Methods: Experimental plantings of 12 tree species (N= 1,080 juveniles).
   Survival was registered in October 2017, June and October 2018, and in
   October 2019.
   Results: Early-successional tree species showed higher survival (27 \%)
   than late- successional species (20 \%). Legumes showed higher survival
   (25 \%) than non-legumes (22 \%). Early non-legume species and
   late-successional legumes had similar and higher survival (> 30 \%) than
   early-successional legume species (< 18 \%).
   Conclusions: To ensure the success of restoration plantings and
   accelerate the recovery of the forest, it is suggested to plant a mix of
   early-successional species (i.e., Dodonaea viscosa Jacq. and Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit) and as many late-successional legumes and
   non-legumes species as possible.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether the inoculation of plant
   growth-promoting bacteria to plants, vegetated in soil irrigated with
   textile effluent, influences plant biomass production, and soil
   remediation. Three different plant species (Acacia ampliceps, Eucalyptus

   inoculation were grown in soil irrigated with secondary treated textile
   wastewater for one year. An endophytic bacterium, Burkholderia sp.
   strain PsJN, possessing plant growth-promoting
   1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity was inoculated to
   plants. There was more plant biomass production (up to 12\%) and
   contaminants removal (up to 29\%) from soil with bacterial inoculation
   as compared to soil having non-inoculated plants. Enhanced plant growth
   and soil remediation activity are associated with the survival and
   colonization of the inoculated bacterium in the rhizosphere and
   endosphere of plants. The highest plant biomass production and
   contaminants removal from soil were observed in the treatment, in which
   A. ampliceps was inoculated with Burkholderia sp. strain PsJN. These
   results suggest that plant-bacteria partnerships can be applied to
   improve plant growth and soil remediation during the application of
   industrial effluent for plant biomass production in the arid regions.},

   appear to be strong determinants of their performance similarity.
   Clustering analysis of species performance compared reliably well with
   the simple ranking in the Alfisol than it did in the Ultisol. In both
   soils, however, clustering analysis overcame the rigidity of the simple

   litters have the highest nutrients, while L. leucocephala and A.
   leiocarpus are the lowest. Soils under G. arborea, T. africana, and A.
   leiocarpus are more acidic due to lower calcium and magnesium contents
   but have higher manganese and sulphur levels. Tree litters improved soil
   nitrogen, phosphorous, and micro-nutrients but depleted potassium.
   Litter lignin and carbon appeared to hinder the release of some
   nutrients. Nitrogen, potassium and copper are concentrated in the
   topsoil while others nutrients are not differentiated with soil depth.
   There is a positive correlation between litter chemistry and soil
   chemical properties. It was concluded that tree litter chemistry differs
   according to species but determines soil reaction and nutrient content.
   The magnitude of the effect on soil properties is related to the quality

   BR816, isolated from Leucaena leucocephala, contains four nodD genes
   which differ in their interaction with flavonoids. Two of the four NodD
   proteins, namely, NodD1 and NodD2, obey the LysR rule regarding the need
   of a coinducer. NodD3 shows hardly any inducing activity, and NodD4
   contains a high basal activity and no response to any of the flavonoids
   tested. Complementation experiments with the NGR234 nodD mutant by the
   different nodD genes of BR816, as well as the analysis of the nodulation
   phenotype of different nodD mutants of BR816, revealed that all the nodD
   genes of BR816 are functional, but differences can be noticed when
   different host plants are tested. Whereas the nodD2 and nodD4 genes of
   BR816 have a great impact on the nodulation oft. leucocephala, nodD3 and
   nodD4 appear to be important for the nodulation of Phaseolus vulgaris.
   It appears that NodD1 of BR816 can function as a transcriptional
   activator in bean nodulation but not in nodulation of L. leacocephala.},

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted at ICRISAT Center, Patancheru, India from

   productivity of annual crop systems can be improved by adding perennial
   species such as Leucaena leucocephala managed as hedgerows. Except in
   the first year, crop yields were suppressed by Leucaena due to
   competition for moisture. The severity of competition was high in years
   of low rainfall and on long-duration crops such as castor and pigeonpea.
   Based on total biomass, sole Leucaena was most productive; even on the
   basis of land productivity requiring both Leucaena fodder and annual
   crops, alley cropping had little or no advantage over block planting of
   both components. Application of hedge prunings as green manure or mulch
   on top of 60 kg N and 30 kg P2O5ha-1 to annual crops did not show any
   benefit during the experimental period, characterized by below average
   rainfall. Indications are that (i) alley cropping was beneficial in
   terms of soil and water conservation with less runoff and soil loss with
   3 m alleys than with 5.4 m alleys, and (ii) root pruning or deep
   ploughing might be effective in reducing moisture competition.},

   Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the hydrological and

   leucocephala, Adenanthera pavonina and Peltophorum pterocarpum.
   Regarding hydrological aspect, the study results indicated that soil on
   which the L. leucocephala was grown had the highest transpiration rate,
   water absorption rate (WAR) and soil matric suction (SMS). In terms of
   mechanical characteristics, L. leucocephala exhibited the highest root
   tensile strength and cellulosic components in the root. Interestingly,
   L. leucocephala also showed a higher root biomass, root length and fine
   roots than A. pavonina and P. pterocarpum. The leaf area index (LAI)
   strongly correlated with SMS (R-2 = 0.74), indicating that high LAI
   improved SMS. The high root tensile strength and fine roots of L.
   leucocephala make this species special for growing as a soil reinforcing
   plant. Overall results suggested that L. leucocephala exhibited
   outstanding hydrological and mechanical properties and can be a
   potential plant for the soil reinforcement program.},

   (14\% CP; 70\% TDN) at 1 kg per 3 kg of milk per day. Cows receiving
   leucaena or lablab in combination with grass produced higher daily milk
   yields (13.6 and 14.4 kg/cow, respectively) and fat percentage (4.2 and

   However, when all cows received concentrate at 4 kg/cow in the 1996
   trial, pasture production systems had no effect on milk production. Milk
   composition (fat, solids-not-fat, total solids, protein and lactose) was
   unaffected by pasture system in 1996. Growing tree legumes with grass or

   support satisfactory milk yields in dairy cattle in Thailand. The

Abstract = {A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate ``liming{''} potential
   of different green manures. Ground leafy materials of cowpea (Vigna
   unguiculata), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and guinea grass (Panicum
   maximum) were added at 0, 5, 10 and 20 g/kg to an Ultisol having a
   soil-water pH 4.0, KCl-extractable Al = 7.6 cmolc/kg, Al saturation =
   50\% and soil-solution Al = 2.2 mM. Treatments with Ca(OH)2 were
   established for comparison. Sesbania cochinchinensis, an Al-sensitive
   tree legume, was grown for 4 weeks as a test crop. Biomass production
   and chemical composition of the soil indicated that (i) cowpea and
   leucaena were more effective than guinea grass in detoxifying Al; for
   example, the additions of 10 g manure per kg soil were equivalent to 1.8
   cmol(OH)/kg for guinea grass, 3.4 for cowpea and 4.2 for leucaena (at
   least on a short-term basis), (ii) reduction of soluble Al at increased
   pH as a result of manure additions was the major mechanism for Al
   detoxification, and (iii) complexation of soluble Al by organic
   molecules also contributed to the detoxification.},

Abstract = {Samples and extracts of foliage from African multipurpose trees were
   screened for their effects on rumen protozoa and bacteria with a view to
   predicting their safety as feed supplements and for identifying species
   with potential antiprotozoal activity. The species tested were Acacia
   aneura, Chamaecytisus palmensis, Brachychiton populneum, Flindersia
   maculosa, Sesbania sesban, Leucaena leucocephala and Vernonia
   amyedalina. Antimicrobial effects were mild except for S. sesban, which
   was highly toxic to rumen protozoa in vitro, and A. aneura, which was
   toxic to rumen bacteria. The antiprotozoal factor in S. sesban was
   apparently associated with the fraction of the plant containing
   saponins. When S. sesban was fed to sheep, protozoal numbers fell by 60
   \% after 4 d, but the population recovered after a further 10 d, in
   vitro experiments demonstrated that washed protozoa from later times
   were no more resistant to S. sesban than on initial exposure, suggesting
   that other micro-organisms, probably the bacteria, adapted to detoxify
   the antiprotozoal agent. Thus S. sesban may be useful in suppressing
   protozoa and thereby improving protein how from the rumen, but only if
   the bacterial metabolism of the antiprotozoal factor can be avoided.},

Abstract = {Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase is a broad substrate specificity enzyme
   catalyzing the final step in monolignol biosynthesis, leading to lignin
   formation in plants. Here, we report characterization of a recombinant
   CAD homologue (LICAD2) isolated from Leucaena leucocephala. LICAD2 is 80
   kDa homodimer associated with non-covalent interactions, having
   substrate preference toward sinapaldehyde with K-cat/K-m of 11.6 x 10(6)
   (M-1 s(-1)), and a possible involvement of histidine at the active site.
   The enzyme remains stable up to 40 C, with the deactivation rate
   constant (K-d{*}) and half-life (t(1/2)) of 0.002 and 5 h, respectively.
   LICAD2 showed optimal activity at pH 6.5 and 9 for reduction and

Abstract = {The design of sustainable agroecosystems requires knowledge of plant
   species impacts on soil functioning. To address this need, we
   manipulated plant species diversity in pastures of eastern Amazonia.
   Four plant species (Arachis pintoi, Brachiaria brizantha, Leucaena
   leucocephala and Solanum rugosum) were grown alone and in every possible
   combination on experimental plots within three replicate farms. After 28
   months, soils were sampled to determine impacts on 5 categories of
   variables: soil macrofauna, aggregate morphology, chemical fertility,
   water storage and compaction. No clear effects of plant species richness
   were observed on any of the soil properties measured. However,
   individual plant species had significant impacts on variables in all 5
   categories. Most notably, the herbaceous legume, A. pintoi, promoted
   both earthworm and ant densities and a corresponding 87\% increase in
   biogenic aggregates in plots with vs. without A. pintoi. Meanwhile, B.
   brizantha increased the proportion of root-derived aggregates, while
   negatively impacting ant densities. Significant covariation was observed
   among many of the 5 data sets (categories), namely soil aggregate
   morphology and soil macrofauna, as well as aggregate morphology and soil
   compaction. This research demonstrates that plant species composition
   can impact soil properties through faunal-mediated effects, and stresses
   the necessity of considering soil macrofauna in agroecosystem
   management. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Three multipurpose tree species (MPTS)-leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala),
   sesbania (Sesbania sesban var. nubica) and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan)
   were pruned at a height of 60 cm above the ground every two months, and
   resulting plant biomass was incorporated into the soil as green manure.
   For comparison, maize (Zea mays) stover was also incorporated into some
   plots, while some other plots were left fallow. Varying quantities of
   plant biomass which were incorporated into the soil over a  period of 12
   months caused large changes in major soil plant nutrients, and it
   substantially improved soil fertility. To test for improved soil
   fertility, test crops of maize and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were grown
   on the test plots after six biomass incorporations of 4806, 13603, 16659
   and 7793 kg. ha-1 yr-1 for pigeonpea, sesbania, leucaena and maize,

   leucaena green manures improved maize stover, cobs and grain yields; and
   bean haulms and grain yields by 77.6\% when compared to fallow plots.
   Residual effects of green manures still resulted in significant (P <

   Economic significance of green manures in increasing food crop yields to

Abstract = {Vegetation is an essential tool to reinforce soil and improve slope
   stability. Two legume species, lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala) and
   copperpod (Peltophorum pterocarpum), were tested in terms of their
   capacity for soil reinforcement using a modified laboratory shear box.
   In addition, morphological parameters of the plant and root tensile
   strength were measured, while root composition also was analysed. Root
   system significantly contributed to increase the shear strength and
   residual strength of soil. The soil-root matrix of both species
   significantly affected the cohesion but not the angle of friction.
   Overall effects varied with soil depth and plant species. Lead tree
   showed higher soil shear strength and residual strength compared to
   copperpod. It also exhibited higher root biomass, root length, fine
   roots, root tensile strength and concentration of cellulosic components
   in root than copperpod, indicating a higher contribution to soil-root
   matrix, soil shear strength and soil reinforcement. A positive
   correlation (r = 0.99) was observed between root biomass and soil shear
   strength of the species studied. Likewise, root cellulosic components
   and soil shear strength were positively correlated. Overall, lead tree
   exhibited exceptional root profiles and mechanical properties and can be
   the best suited plant for soil reinforcement.},

   Phenotypic and genotypic methods applied for this study were SOS-PAGE of
   whole-cell proteins, and 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequencing. To confirm
   the ability to nodulate and fix N-2, the presence of the nodC and nifH
   genes was also determined, and an experiment was carried out with two
   representative isolates in order to authenticate them as legume nodule
   symbionts. All 35 isolates belonged to the betaproteobacterium
   Cupriavidus necator, they possessed the nodC and nifH genes, and two
   representative isolates were able to nodulate five different promiscuous
   legume species: Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia, L leucocephala, Macroptilium

   juliflora (Sw.) DC, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Mimosaceae),
   Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (Meliaceae), and others. In this paper, we
   mainly assess the impacts of invasive Prosopis species in Africa,
   particularly in Kenya and South Africa. Introduced Prosopis species have
   invaded over 4 million hectares in Africa, threatening crop and pasture
   production, reducing underground water reserves, and displacing native
   plant and animal species. This has major implications for millions of
   people who depend on natural resources for their survival. It is
   therefore suggested that known invasive or potentially invasive plant
   species not be introduced to countries or regions for biofuel
   production. If (after a stringent cost-benefit analysis) the
   introduction of a potentially invasive species is deemed critical for
   economic development and the benefits clearly outweigh the potential
   costs, countries should endeavour to abide by the Principles and
   Criteria for Sustainable Biofuel Production developed by the Roundtable
   on Sustainable Biofuels.},

Abstract = {The guaB mutant strain Rhizobium tropici CIAT8999-10T is defective in
   symbiosis with common bean, forming nodules that lack rhizobial content.
   In order to investigate the timing of the guaB requirement during the
   nodule formation on the host common bean by the strain CIAT899-10.T, we
   constructed gene fusions in which the guaB gene is expressed under the
   control of the symbiotic promoters nodA, bacA, and nifH. Our data
   indicated that the guaB is required from the early stages of nodulation
   because full recovery of the wild-type phenotype was accomplished by the
   nodA-guaB fusion. In addition, we have constructed a guaB mutant derived
   from Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021, and shown that, unlike R. tropici, the
   guaB S. meliloti mutant is auxotrophic for guanine and induces wild-type
   nodules on alfalfa and Medicago truncatula. The guaB R. tropici mutant
   also is defective in its symbiosis with Macrop-tilium atropurpureum and
   Vigna unguiculata but normal with Leucaena leucocephala. These results
   show that the requirement of the rhizobial guaB for symbiosis is found
   to be associated with host plants that form determinate type of nodules.},

   workers for agroforestry in the mid-altitude (600-1600 m)
   agro-ecological zone of North-West Cameroon because its seeds are common

   accept leucaena for agroforestry because its early growth is poor on
   acid infertile soils prevalent in the area. Leucaena was planted using
   four-month-old potted plants and, from four months after planting, the
   shrub was cut five times in 20 months at 120 day intervals. Manuring
   improved leucaena's growth and biomass at sites with acid and non-acid
   soil alike. Total biomass responded linearly (R-2 = 0.97) to manure
   rates at the acid and infertile site and curvilinearly (R-2 = 0.95) at
   the non-acid site. Total leafy biomass from the first cut and subsequent
   prunings was highest at 12 months after planting. Manuring increased
   rooting depth and this contributed to the plant's observed ability to
   cope with moisture stress during the dry season. The economics of manure
   use for tree establishment on acid infertile soils for agroforestry
   systems needs further study.},

Abstract = {In Taiwan, farmers often apply excessive compost to ensure adequate crop
   yield in frequent tillage, highly weathered, and lower fertility soils.
   The potential of biochar (BC) to decrease soil C mineralization and
   improve soil nutrient availability in excessive compost application soil
   is promising, but under-examined. To test this, a 434-day incubation
   experiment of in vitro C mineralization kinetics was conducted. We added
   0\%, 0.5\%, 1.0\%, and 2.0\% (w/w) woody BC composed of lead tree
   (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de. Wit) to one Oxisol and two Inceptisols
   in Taiwan. In each treatment, 5\% swine manure compost was added to
   serve as excessive application. The results indicated that soil type
   strongly influences the impact of BC addition on soil carbon
   mineralization potential. Respiration per unit of total organic carbon
   (total mineralization coefficient) of the three studied soils
   significantly decreased with increase in BC addition. Principal
   component analysis suggested that to retain more plant nutrients in
   addition to the effects of carbon sequestration, farmers could use
   locally produced biochars and composts in highly weathered and highly
   frequent tillage soil. Adding 0.5\% woody BC to Taiwan rural soils
   should be reasonable and appropriate.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to construct a pydA-pydB hybrid gene
   that encodes a functional dioxygenase-hydrolase (PydA-PydB) fusion
   protein for degradation of 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (HP). HP is an
   intermediate in both synthesis and degradation of mimosine, a toxic
   amino acid produced by the tree legume Leucaena leucocephala.
   Computer-generated models of the fusion proteins suggested that joining
   of PydA and PydB with 0, 3, or 7 glycine residues as a linker should
   produce a functional PydA-PydB fusion protein. Accordingly, three hybrid
   genes, G0, G3, and G7, were constructed in which pydA and pj;dB were
   connected with 0, 9, and 21 nucleotides, respectively, encoding the
   glycine residues of the linker region. When these hybrid genes were
   expressed in Rhizobium and Escherichia coli, only one of them, G3,
   produced a functional PydA-PydB fusion protein, having both the
   dioxygenase and hydrolase activities. The G3 hybrid gene could
   complement both pydA and pydB mutants of Rhizobium, and E coli lysate
   containing the overexpressed G3 protein was able to degrade HP. This
   hybrid gene may be useful for developing mimosine-free L. leucocephala
   plants in the future.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala became naturalized in Paraguay long ago. However,
   due to cases of toxicity in horses and cattle, now identified as
   mimosine toxicity, leucaena was considered a weed until the beginning of
   this millennium. At this time the mimosine toxicity problem was overcome
   by the introduction of ruminal fluid from Australia containing the
   mimosine-degrading and -detoxifying bacterium Synergistes jonesii. As
   long as an internationally funded technical assistance project was
   operating (offering technical advice, provision of seed, seed
   scarification service and transmission of ruminal fluid containing
   Synergistes), the area sown to leucaena (either in twin rows into grass
   pastures or as fodder banks) increased rapidly in Paraguay, particularly
   in the Chaco area. However, the powdery fluvisols of the drier parts of
   the Chaco were not well suited to growth of leucaena, as persistence was
   restricted due to the impact of rodents, termites and also leaf-cutting
   ants, which prosper particularly well in this part of the Chaco. In more
   humid areas with usually heavier soils, currently leucaena represents an
   integral part of the feeding systems in hundreds of Paraguayan farms
   (large-scale as well as smallholders), mainly for steer fattening and
   dairy cow supplementation. After taking into account the above-mentioned
   setbacks, the total area of leucaena is currently estimated at about
   10,000 ha.},

Abstract = {A comprehensive review, based on about 170 references, synthesizing
   research and development about Cratylia argentea , is presented to
   expand interest in its dissemination and use in animal production
   systems. The species has been widely evaluated, mainly in tropical
   America, with the objective to develop it as a shrub legume and an
   alternative to the fertility-demanding species, Leucaena leucocephala
   and Gliricidia sepium . The review on cratylia is presented in 2
   separate parts covering biology and agronomy and quality and
   utilization. This paper focuses on the (1) description of the species,
   (2) biogeography and information on germplasm collections and genetic
   diversity, synthesis, (3) discussion of results from agronomic research,
   reproductive biology, seed production and (4) multipurpose uses of
   cratylia. Some strengths of the species as a forage shrub are adaptation
   to the acid, infertile soils that prevail in the tropics and drought
   tolerance in subhumid climates with a pronounced dry season. Major
   shortcomings are slow establishment and rapidly declining seed quality.
   Research resulted in the release of a blend of 2 germplasm accessions
   (CIAT 18516 and CIAT 18668) as a commercial forage legume cultivar in
   Costa Rica and Colombia. Finally, recommendations for future research
   are proposed.},

Abstract = {Land use influences physico-chemical and water transmission properties
   of soil, which ultimately determine the suitability of land for
   different purposes. In present study, impact of different land use
   (forest and agriculture) on selected physicochemical and hydrological
   properties of soil was evaluated and compared with a reference site
   (uncultivated ravinous wasteland). Land use influenced infiltration
   rate, bulk density, mean weight diameter of aggregates and plant
   available water of soils. After 25 years of plantation of forest
   species, soil organic carbon content increased by more than twofold and
   mean weight diameter of aggregates by 2- to 6-fold in comparison to
   reference site. Significant reduction in soil bulk density (4-18\%) and
   increase in steady state infiltration rate (1.5-2 times) was observed
   under the forest land use system. Conversion of ravine to forest system
   resulted in significant improvement in moisture retention capacity of
   soil. Conversion of ravine landform to agriculture adversely affected
   the soil bulk density and infiltration rate. The study provided
   practical information regarding rehabilitation potential of different
   tree species (Prosopis juliflora, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia nilotica
   and Azadirachta indica) that could be used for restoration of
   ustifluvent soil susceptible to gully erosion in the semi-arid region.},

Abstract = {A descriptive study was conducted in order to determine the tannin
   profiles of tropical fodder crops. The following types of condensed
   tannins (CT) were determined (expressed as g kg(-1) of dry matter): free
   (FCT), bound to protein (CTP), bound to fibre (CTF) and total (TCT).
   High FCT levels were found in Desmodium ovalifolium (228.4), Flemigia
   macrophylla (181.9), Guazuma ulmyfolia (129.7) and Leucaena leucocephala
   (129.5). The highest concentrations of CTP were detected in Gliricidia
   sepium (61.0), F macrophylla (23.3), and G ulmyfolia (21.1). CTF levels
   were the highest in G ulmyfolia (55.1), F macrophylla (46.7) and G
   sepium (41.5). Analyzed samples cultivated in vertisol and fluvisol
   soils showed different contents of tannins. It has been reported that
   plants with more than 60 g kg(-1) FCT are less palatable and digestible
   than forages with lower concentrations of this chemical class, although
   there is more protein to bypass the rumen and higher nitrogen retention.
   Graminaceous plants showed higher concentrations of FCT and TCT
   concentrations were generally lower than legumes and other forage crops.

Abstract = {Recent work to establish and produce multipurpose trees is reviewed in
   terms of their production and role in animal feeding systems. A great
   deal of variability was found in fodder production, with Acacia
   angustissima, Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham, Gliricidia sepium
   and to some extent Cajanus cajan producing the highest fodder yields at
   both Domboshawa and Makoholi sites. However, with C. cajan the yields at
   Makoholi were much lower than at Domboshawa. Among the alternative
   species to the psyllid-prone L. leucocephala, A. angustissima has shown
   superior fodder productivity. Within the Leucaena genus L. esculenta
   subsp. paniculata (OFI 52/87), L. diversifolia subsp. stenocarpa (OFI
   53/88), L. pallida (G2137) and to some extent L. pulverulenta (OFI
   84/87) have shown the greatest potential at both Domboshawa and
   Makoholi. Due to differences in chemical composition, the different
   fodder trees were variable in the extent to which they can be relied
   upon as feed resources in Zimbabwe. Notable differences were found in
   fibre content, in vitro dry matter digestibility, acceptability and
   intake by livestock and therefore, their potential in affecting animal
   productivity. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {This article presents an energy-efficient biochar kiln that produces
   biochar from agricultural crop residues. The kiln is designed to be easy
   to operate and has minimal requirements for special operations. It works
   by heating biomass in a combustion chamber using recirculated pyrogas.
   The study optimized the process parameters and economics of producing
   biochar from wheat straw using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based
   on Central Composite Design (CCD). The sustainable pyrolyzer had a
   thermal efficiency of 43.69\%, with steady-state operation at 517.68 +/-
   98.18 degrees C. It produced an average of 54.57 +/- 1.86 kg of biochar
   per batch, using 36.96 +/- 3.66 kg of subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) as
   fuel and 179.61 +/- 2.87 kg of wheat straw as feedstock. Subabul is
   chosen as a fuel due to its rapid growth, high calorific value, low
   moisture content, efficient combustion, and minimal smoke emission. The
   thermogravimetric index (TGI) and calorific value of WSB were 7.14 and
   25.91 +/- 0.74 MJ/kg, respectively. The benefit-cost ratio and payback
   period were 2.27 +/- 0.16 and 4.92 +/- 0.44 months, respectively.},

Abstract = {Torrefaction, also known as mild pyrolysis, is often carried out between
   temperature ranges of 200 and 300(o)C in anoxic conditions. It is a type
   of thermo-chemical pre-treatment process applicable to biomass in order
   to convert it into compatible energy fuels. Torrefaction has favorable
   effects on biomass, which includes increasing its energy density and
   eliminating problems commonly associated with raw biomass such as high
   moisture content, hygroscopic behavior and low calorific value. In this
   study, torrefaction of agricultural residue, oil palm frond (non-woody
   biomass) and short rotation energy crop, Leucaena Leucocephala (woody
   biomass) were conducted in a horizontal tube furnace at five
   temperatures and holding time of 60 min. High heating values, elemental
   and proximate analyses results, thermal degradation profiles of
   torrefied fibrous products were compared to its raw forms. It was
   concluded that as torrefaction conditions became more severe, this led
   to a more qualified and energy-dense solid fuel with higher fixed carbon
   content, increased calorific values and reduced hydrogen and oxygen
   contents. The results gained from this study may provide basic
   information for torrefied products application in combustor and/ or
   gasifier design. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   Air-dried leucaena leaves were applied as a surface mulch, at the rate

   timings of soil incorporation namely: immediately, 15, 30 and 45 days
   after harvest of maize crop as subplot treatments. Each treatment was
   replicated four times in a strip-plot design. The results revealed that
   more moisture was available in mulched surface soil (0-15 cm) at the
   time of wheat sowing. Application of mulch increased moisture
   extraction, water use efficiency (WUE), grain and straw yield of wheat
   crop. Incorporation of leaf mulch at 30 days after harvesting of maize
   crop conserved more moisture for wheat sowing. This study indicated that
   optimal mulch application rate was 2 t ha(-1) and time of incorporation

Abstract = {The leucaena psyllid, Heteropsylla cubana Crawford, can devastate
   plantings of Leucaena leucocephala (Leguminosae), an economically
   important tree species in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia,
   Australia, India, Africa, and elsewhere. The predatory beetle, Curinus
   coeruleus Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), has been introduced into
   many of these areas from Hawaii for biological control of the psyllid.
   In this study, collections of C. coeruleus were made from II populations
   on four islands in the Hawaiian archipelago to determine population
   structure and estimate levels of gene flow. Over all populations, a
   measure of population subdivision, theta, was 0.095, and the estimate of
   N(e)m, the average migration rate, was 2.4 theta values for the
   individual islands were 0.02, 0.12, 0.24 and 0.05 for Kauai, Hawaii,
   Maul, and Oahu, respectively. Estimated levels of gene flow between
   populations were not correlated with geographic distance, therefore
   isolation by distance does not appear to be an important process
   structuring C. coeruleus populations. Gene flow estimates can be used to
   characterize dispersal capabilities in insects or other organisms
   released for biological control. In this case, the inferior dispersal
   ability of C. coeruleus likely limits its rapid widespread establishment
   during release programmes.},

Abstract = {Two hundred and eighty seven isolates of Rhizobium nodulating Phaseolus

   and by plasmid profiles. A representative sample was further
   characterized: a) by the ability of each isolate to nodulate a potential
   alternative host Leucaena leucocephala and to grow on specific media,
   and b) by RFLP analysis of PCR amplified 16S rRNA genes, On the basis of
   their phenotypic and genetic characteristics the isolates could be
   assigned either to Rhizobium leguminosarum bv phaseoli, or to R.
   tropici. The two species co-occurred at three sites. R. leguminosarum bv
   phaseoli represented 2\%, 4\%, 72\% and 100\% of the population at the
   four different sites. Eighteen and 22 different plasmid profiles were
   identified within R. tropici and R. leguminosarum bv phaseoli,
   respectively. Some of them were conserved between distant geographical
   regions. The fact that R. tropici was found in France shows that this

   respective tree legume treatment.
   Less than 50\% of Sesbania grandiflora trees survived the regular
   cutting in this experiment while almost all trees of the other species
   survived. Tree leaf yields of the three surviving species were
   positively related to tree density in the wet season but less so in the
   dry season. The longer cutting interval produced a higher leaf yield in
   the first wet season harvest but not in later harvests when rainfall was
   lower.
   In the wet season, the shorter cutting interval tended to produce higher
   grass yields in the higher densities while no differences between
   cutting intervals occurred in the lower tree densities. On the contrary,
   in the dry season grass yields were higher overall in the longer cutting
