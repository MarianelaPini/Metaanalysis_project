AB  - Two experiments with 12 and 18 lactating Jersey cows respectively were carried out in the coastal semi-humid zone of Kenya to assess the performance arising from the feeding of chopped Napier fodder (Pennisetum purpureum) given ad libitum with and without one of three sources of protein; fishmeal, copra cake and freshly cut Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). Each source supplied approximately 300 g crude protein daily. Dry matter intakes of Napier fodder fed alone averaged 7·1 and 5·5 kg in Experiments 1 and 2 respectively. Additional protein did not affect Napier fodder intake, but total intakes of dry matter were higher for the cows receiving the protein supplements, differences which were significant (P<0·05) in Experiment 2. Average daily milk production from cows fed Napier fodder alone was 6·4 and 4·2 kg in Experiments 1 and 2 respectively. The additional 300 g crude protein increased milk production by 1·0 to 1·6 kg/day, increases which, except that for fishmeal, were significant (P<0·05). Weight losses of the cows were either reduced or changed to weight gains by the provision of protein. The results are assessed in relation to the energy and protein requirements for milk production. © 1993 Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine, University of Edinburgh.

TI  - Effects of sample preparation on nitrogen degradability of pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens) and tropical tree legumes
PY  - 1994

AB  - The effects of particle size on the nitrogen degradability of four tropical forages were studied in 1991 in Guadeloupe. Samples of pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens) 22 and 47 days old, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala were prepared as follows: grasses were (1) freshly cut with scissors to 0.5-1.0 cm in length and frozen at — 18 °C; or for later study were dried at 80 °C and ground to pass a (2) 0.5 mm, (3) 10 mm or (4) 2.0 mm screen. Nitrogen degradability (ND) was determined by placing samples in nylon bags with two different pore sizes (25 and 46 pm) which were then put into the rumen of cows for 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 h. The kinetics of nitrogen degradation were examined using 0rskov’s model. Particle losses through the nylon bags, dry matter (DM) and nitrogen solubility of the samples were also measured in vitro. The sample preparation and the type of forage were the main sources of variation in the rapidly degradable nitrogen fraction, the slowly degradable nitrogen fraction, the degradation rate, the potentially degradable nitrogen fraction and ND. Nitrogen degradability was 55.8,46.7, 64.0 and 46.5 % for pangola grass (at 22 and 47 days regrowth), Gliricidia and Leucaena samples, respectively. Mean ND was 47.9, 59.4, 56.1 and 49.6% for freshly cut and 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mm dried ground samples, respectively. Sample preparation had little effect on nitrogen solubility. For samples dried and ground at 0–5 and 1.0 mm, particle losses were 18.8 and 15.0% of DM, respectively. The insoluble but degradable fraction was 60.8, 51.9, 42.5 and 42.7% for freshly cut and 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mm dried ground samples, respectively. The freshly cut material appeared to be suitable for the estimation of ND in tropical forages. © 1994, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The in vitro digestibility of Leucaena seed kernel meal was appreciably improved from 25.3% to 89.2% on autoclaving. There was an increase in digestibility of Leucaena protein isolate (LPI) as compared to the unautoclaved (raw) seed kernels, which could be attributed to the removal of a number of antinutritional factors, particularly mimosine, in the non-precipitable supernatant (whey) fraction. Autoclaving of the raw Leucaena seed meal, as well as converting it into protein isolate, was found to improve its in vitro digestibility appreciably. © 1992.

AB  - The objectives of the study were to investigate (1) whether decomposition rates of foliage differs among the multipurpose trees (MPTs) Leucaena leucocephala (LEL), Flemingia congesta (FLC), Pericopsis angolensis (PEA), Cassia siamea (CAS), Sesbania sesban (SES) and Gliricidia sepium (GLS), and (2) whether nitrogen (N) concentrations and mineralization in the foliage differ among these MPTs. Litter bags containing foliage from each species were arranged in a randomized block design with three replicates and sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks in a repeated measures manner, after placement to determine decomposition and N release. Estimates were made of N mineralization and equations were developed for predicting rate of decomposition, N concentration, and N content for each species. Significant differences existed in decomposition rates (GLS > LEL = SES > CAS > PEA = FLC) and N contents (GLS = LEL > SES > PEA = FLC = CAS). No significant differences existed in N concentration between the species. Based on these results, GLS and LEL showed the greatest potential for use as green manures. Further studies are required to determine time, amounts and methods of green manure application. © 1994.

AB  - The cafeteria technique using three-year-old West African Dwarf sheep was used to determine relative palatability differences within 28 provenances of Gliricidia sepium collected from West Africa and Central America. Leucaena leucocephala and Guazuma ulmifolia were included as controls. Significant differences (P<0.05) in relative palatability index (RPI) were detected among G. sepium provenances. Mexican ecotypes appeared to be of low relative palatability compared to those from Costa Rica. Based on their RPI, provenances were grouped into high (RPI>90%), medium (RPI 60-90%) and low (RPI<60%) preference rankings. The importance of the differences in relative palatability is discussed in relation to Gliricidia-based alley farming in the humid West African region. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A greenhouse investigation was undertaken to determine the influence of fresh organic matter on the formation and functioning of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in Leucaena leucocephala grown in an acid aluminum-rich ultisol. In soil not amended with fresh organic matter or lime, plants failed to grow. Mycorrhizal infection level, mycorrhizal effectiveness measured in terms of pinnule P content of L. leucocephala leaves and dry matter yield of the legume increased with increase in fresh organic matter. Although VAM colonization level and dry matter yield of L. leucocephala were significantly higher if the test soil was limed (7.2 cmole OH-) than if amended with fresh organic matter, the latter was as effective as lime in off-setting the detrimental effect of aluminum on mycorrhizal effectiveness. The lower mycorrhizal colonization level and the lower dry matter yield noted in the soil treated with fresh organic matter appears to be related to the inadequacy of Ca in the soil amended with fresh organic matter. These observations are supported by the low calcium status of soil and plant tissues in the absence of lime. It is concluded that while fresh organic matter, in appropriate amounts, could protect sensitive plants and VAM symbiosis against Al toxicity in acid soils, maximum mycorrhizal inoculation effects are not likely to be attained unless the soils are also amended with Ca. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - High α -cellulose pulps obtained from fast growing plant species Leucaena leucocephala and Hibiscus cannabinus were esterified with trimellitic anhydride (TMA), phthalic anhydride (PTA) and trimethyl acetic anhydride (TMAA), following a homogeneous reaction procedure. The degree of substitution achieved was found to vary, up to 2.56, depending on the reaction conditions. Thermal decomposition was studied by a differential thermogravimetry at three heating rates 5, 10 and 20°C min-1 in static air. The kinetic parameters were evaluated using the generalized equation of Coats and Redfern. The thermal stabilities of the esters were found to vary in the order TMA > PTA > TMAA. The decomposition process was found to conform to first order weight loss kinetics, and the activation energies of the respective esters at 5°Cmin-1 heating rate were 308.11, 194.98 and 213.00 kJ mol-1 respectively. © 1993.

AB  - The residual effect of the fungicide chlorothalonil on the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) symbiosis was evaluated in a greenhouse experiment. The soil used was an oxisol (Tropeptic Eutrustox) treated with P to obtain target levels near-optimal for VAM activity or sufficient for nonmycorrhizal host growth. In the uninoculated soil treated with the former P level, the fungicide reduced VAM colonization of roots and completely suppressed symbiotic effectiveness measured in terms of pinnule P content. When this soil was inoculated with Glomus aggregatum, symbiotic effectiveness was significantly reduced but not eliminated by 50 mg of the fungicide kg-1. At higher chlorothalonil levels, VAM effectiveness but not VAM colonization was completely suppressed in the inoculated soil. The pattern with which chlorothalonil influenced tissue P content and dry matter yield at the time of harvest closely paralleled its effect on VAM effectiveness. In the soil treated with P level sufficient for nonmycorrhizal host growth, the adverse effect of the fungicide on the above variables was appreciably milder than when the host relied on VAM fungi for its P supply. The toxic effect of the fungicide, therefore, was partly offset by P fertilization, suggesting that VAM fungi were more sensitive to chlorothalonil than the host. Our results demonstrate that although the toxic effect of chlorothalonil declined as a function of time, a significant level of toxicity persisted 12.5 weeks after the chemical was applied to soil. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Microsites with maximum available soil moisture and water holding capacity with low availability of light radiation had higher plant density and basal cover. The higher availability of solar radiation produced high dominance and plant biomass, thus within a period of 120 days the area produced 2.3 Mg ha-1 biomass. -from Authors

AB  - A total of 75 trees were sampled for leaf nutrient content in January 1990, 15 each from Leucaena leucocephala var. cunningham and Sesbania sesban, and 45 from three age classes of Brachystegia spiciformis. For every three trees sampled per species or age class, the samples were thoroughly mixed and a composite sample was drawn which was oven-dried, ground and analysed for dry matter digestibility, acid detergent fibre, lignin, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium content. The highest leaf quality was recorded in S. sesban, this having significantly higher levels than L. leucocephala of phosphorus, calcium and in vitro dry matter digestibility, and a lower value for fibre. L. leucocephala was better than S. sesban only for nitrogen content of leaves. The lowest quality litter was recorded in B. spiciformis with generally lower levels of all nutrients, crude protein, in vitro dry matter digestibility, and highest levels of fibre and lignin. There were no consistent differences among the different age classes of B. spiciformis, with only a slight tendency for higher nitrogen and crude protein levels in coppice growth. To improve soil fertility on already cleared land, one option is to introduce S. sesban and L. leucocephala litter. © 1994.

AB  - An international collaborative trial is described, which was initiated in 1984 to test 27 non-industrial species from the dry zone of Central America on a wide range of sites throughout the semiarid and subhumid tropics. Species performance was evaluated in terms of wood biomass production, using a standardized assessment methodology which was developed using data from biomass studies at 13 sites. The highest wood biomass producers across all sites were, in order, Leucaena leucocephala, L. collinsii subsp. zacapana, Acacia pennatula, Gliricidia sepium, Senna atomaria and Albizia guachapele. Leucaena leucocephala was also found to be the most responsive of all the species to improvement in site quality. There was, however, strong species × site interaction, with the Leucaenas generally only performing best on the more productive sites. © 1994.

AB  - Geographical variation in dieback of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit was studied at 40 sites in 1986 and 1991 in southeastern Oahu, Hawaii. Canopy vigour, tree height, altitude, exposure to prevailing trade winds (aspect) and slope were measured at each leucaena stand. Precipitation was also determined. In 1986, four groups of sites were determined based on vigour data using cluster analysis. Exposure, precipitation and average tree height significantly varied among groups. The dieback was a location-specific phenomenon and the timing of its occurrence varied from place to place. The amount of dieback increased between 1986 and 1991. Two dieback hypotheses were considered: (1) psyllid damage and (2) death of even-aged population (cohort senescence). It is most likely that psyllid damage triggered the dieback of old leucaena stands. © 1993 A B Academic Publisher.

AB  - The early steps of symbiotic nodule formation by Rhizobium spp. on plants require coordinate expression of several nod gene operons, which is accomplished by the activating protein NodD. Rhizobium sp. strain BR816, isolated from Leucaena leucocephala, contains four nodD genes which differ in their interaction with flavonoids. Two of the four NodD proteins, namely, NodD1 and NodD2, obey the LysR rule regarding the need of a coinducer. NodD3 shows hardly any inducing activity, and NodD4 contains a high basal activity and no response to any of the flavonoids tested. Complementation experiments with the NGR234 nodD mutant by the different nodD genes of BR816, as well as the analysis of the nodulation phenotype of different nodD mutants of BR816, revealed that all the nodD genes of BR816 are functional, but differences can be noticed when different host plants are tested. Whereas the nodD2 and nodD4 genes of BR816 have a great impact on the nodulation of L. leucocephala, nodD3 and nodD4 appear to be important for the nodulation of Phaseolus vulgaris. It appears that NodD1 of BR816 can function as a transcriptional activator in bean nodulation but not in nodulation of L. leucocephala.

Total DM production was higher (P<0.05) for Alchornea cordifolia than for the other browse species. Glyphaea brevis and L. leucocephala were the most preferred species, while A. cordifolia, G. sepium and R. vomitoria were the least. Mean crude protein content of browse species in this study was higher, while P and neutral detergent fibre were lower than reported for other browse species in Nigeria. It is argued that the ultimate goal of a crop-livestock agroforestry system such as alley farming, could be better achieved through the complementary use of browse species. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 nodulates Leucaena leucocephala and Phaseolus vulgaris, in addition to a wide range of tropical tree legumes. Six overlapping clones that complemented nodulation defects in leucaena and bean rhizobia were isolated and a 40-kb map of the symbiosis region was constructed. The common nod and nifA genes were situated approximately 17 kb apart, with the nodIJ genes in between. These clones enabled a derivative of TAL1145 carrying a partially deleted pSym to form ineffective nodules on both leucaena and bean, and a similar derivative of Rhizobium etli TAL182 to form ineffective nodules on bean. When two representative clones, pUHR9 and pUHR114, were each transferred to wild-type rhizobial strains, they allowed ineffective nodulation by Rhizobium meliloti on both leucaena and bean and by Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae on bean. Transconjugants of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii formed effective nodules on leucaena and ineffective nodules on bean. Tn5 mutagenesis of the symbiosis region resulted in a variety of nodulation and fixation phenotypes on leucaena and bean. On the basis of 16S rRNA sequences, TAL1145 was found to be distinct from both R. tropici and NGR234, the two groups of leucaena symbionts that were previously described.

AB  - In the current experiment we compared the effect of several green manure legumes incorporated into soil on the production of cabbage. The green manure legumes used were Cassia mimosoides, Cassia occidentalis, Cassia tora, Crotalaria juncea, Flemingia congesta, Glycine max, Leucaena leucocephala, and Sesbania cannabina. Biomass production of green manure legumes was higher in the following order: C. tora > Crotalaria > G. max > S. cannabina > C. occidentalis > F. congesta > C. mimosoides > L. leucocephala. Mineral uptake also varied among the plant species. Incorporation of the green manure legumes increased the production of cabbage grown in the bed as succeeding crop, and the highest production was obtained by the incorporation of C. occidentalis. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium concentrations in cabbage decreased by the incorporation of green manure while the calcium concentration increased. There was no clear correlation between the amount of N taken up by the green manure legumes and the production of cabbage crop. This phenomenon suggests that some factors other than nitrogen accumulation may affect the production of the succeeding crop. On the other hand, a significant positive correlation was observed between the potassium uptake by the green manure crops and the increase of cabbage production. Incorporation of green manure legumes also played an important role in the maintenance of soil minerals. Cabbage production showed a significant negative correlation with EC and a positive correlation with the potassium content in soil after harvest. This experiment indicated that the incorporation of green manure legumes was not only effective for the production of the succeeding crop but also for the maintenance of some plant nutrients like inorganic nitrogen and available phosphorus. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Here the idea is examined that leucaena prunings (residues) can supply enough N to maize plants to significantly reduce the degree of N deficiency. Two experiments on decomposition of leucaena leaf, stem, and petiole and mineralization of N from leucaena residues were conducted in field microplots which received application of either15N-labelled leucaena materials or ammonium sulphate fertilizer. The microplots were installed in alleys formed by leucaena hedgerows spaced 4.5 metres apart and cropped with maize. The decomposition of leucaena leaves, stems and petioles was estimated by several methods. The decomposition ranged from 50-58% with leaves, 25-67% with stems and 38-51% with petioles 20 days after addition. More than 55% of the N was released in 52 days during decomposition of leucaena residues. By 20 days after application of15N-labelled leucaena 3.3-9.4% of the added15N was found in the maize plants, 32.7-49.0% was in the leucaena residues, 36.0-48.0% in the soil and 0.3-21.9% lost (deficit). By 52 days 4.8% of the15N applied in leucaena prunings was taken up by maize, 45.1% was detected in the residues, 24.9% in the soil and 25.2% lost. However, when N fertilizer was applied, 50.2% of the fertilizer N was recovered by maize, 35.5% was retained in the soil and 14.3% apparently lost. There was a marked increase in maize plant dry matter and N uptake in the microplots with addition of leucaena prunings compared with those in the microplots without leucaena added. Most of the15N remaining in the soil profile, derived from leucaena residues, was detected in the top 25 cm soil with less than 2% found below 25 cm. ei]H Lambers © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Root systems of unpruned Cassia siamea and Leucaena leucocephala trees and regularly pruned hedges of C. siamea, L. leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium were examined in a semi-arid area in Kenya. Trenches were dug across rows of trees or hedges, soil profiles washed, and different sized roots counted in small 5 × 5 cm grids fully covering both faces of the trench. The roots were displayed using two computer software programmes written for this purpose: a spline technique that displays smoothed root densities in different shades; and a random dot method which displays roots as dots, using any specified scale. The fine roots of four-and-a-half-year-old C. siamea penetrated the soil to meet with rocks at depths between 0.60 and 2.0 m, and spread laterally to 9 m, traversing adjacent crop plots. Roots of eight-year-old L. leucocephala covered an extensive soil volume and included a greater density of fine roots than C. siamea at comparable distances. Above-ground pruning restricted the roots of hedges to a depth of 1.5 m, although roots of different hedges spaced 5 m apart intermingled freely in the alley space. L. leucocephala roots filled the alley very densely while those of G. sepium were sparse, particularly in the middle of the alley. Rooting density of C. siamea was intermediate. The dot method is more precise when rooting densities are low but when densities are high the splining method appears to be more visually helpful. These graphical methods greatly facilitate overall comparisons of sections of tree root systems, but quantification of root densities at different distances away from trees is still needed to understand more precisely the competitive effects of trees and associated crops.

AB  - Effects of application of five types of plant residues [Acioa barteri, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala prunings, maize (Zea mays) stover and rice (Oryza sativa) straw] as mulch on soil fauna were examined under field conditions in the humid tropics in 1990 and 1991. Earthworm mean population over 2 years was higher under any type of plant residues by 41% compared to control. Leucaena prunings supported the highest earthworm population. Mulched plots also showed 177% higher mean termite population over 2 years than control. Highest termite population was observed in plots mulched with Acioa prunings followed by maize stover > rice straw > Leucaena prunings > Gliricidia prunings. The mean ant populations were 36% higher with Leucaena and Gliricidia prunings, and were not affected by Acioa prunings, maize stover and rice straw as compared to control. Millipede populations were not significantly affected by mulching. Earthworm populations were negatively correlated with the ratio of lignin : N of plant residues. Ant populations were significantly related to the N content of plant residues (R2 = 0.87 and 0.84 for 1990 and 1991 respectively). The results imply that chemical plant composition, particularly N and lignin contents, play a critical role in faunal abundance in the soil through their effect on palatability and decomposibility. Indirect microclimatic and mulching effects may also be important. © 1993.

AB  - Effects of application of prunings of three woody species (Acioa barteri, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala), maize (Zea mays L.) stover and rice (Oryza sativa L.) straw as mulch on maize were studied on an Alfisol in southern Nigeria in 1990 and 1991. Maize dry matter and grain yield were higher with applications of plant residues and N fertilizer in both years. Addition of Leucaena prunings gave the highest maize grain yield in both years. Compared to the 1990 results, Acioa showed the least grain yield decline among the mulch treatments in 1991. Nutrient uptake was enhanced by applications of plant residues. Leucaena prunings had the highest effect in both years and increased the mean N, P, and Mg uptake by 96%, 84%, and 50%, respectively, over the control. Addition of Acioa prunings increased K and Ca uptake by 59% and 92%, respectively, over the control. 'High quality' (low C/N ratio and lignin level) plant residues enhance crop performance through direct nutritional contributions, whereas 'low quality' (high C/N ratio and lignin level) plant residues do so through mulching effects on the microclimate. 'Intermediate quality' plant residues have no clear effects on crop performance. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The testa structure and histochemistry of Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (De Wit) seed were investigated by bright-field and fluorescence light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The testa consisted of several separate layers. Externally there was a non-cellular layer made up of two parts differing in histochemical characteristics: an “outer strip” rich in hydrophilic substances, and a “thicker part” showing the occurrence of phenolics, involved in water impermeability control. A second underlying thin layer was formed by the palisade cell caps, joined one to another. This layer, which we called the “cap film”, became metachromatic reddish-blue with Toluidine O pH 4-4 and reacted positively with Alcian blue pH 2-5, revealing the presence of polysaccharide hydrophilic material. The palisade cells consisted of two parts, having different structures and histochemical features. The furrowed upper part revealed the simultaneous presence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances in the furrows and in the ribs respectively. The corresponding periclinal section showed a central daisy-like pattern (made up of hydrophilic material) with a small chain of tiny spots (made up of hydrophobic material) all around it. The inner part of the palisade cells was also furrowed, but showed only hydrophobic substances of lipidlc nature, detected by Auramine O and Phosphine 3R. The light line was found to be rich in callose as shown by the strong fluorescence induced by Aniline Blue. These findings add supporting evidence of the complex structure and composition of the Leucaena leucocephala testa. © 1994 Annals of Botany Company.

AB  - Soil moisture changes and maize yield were studied in 2-year-old alleys of Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia macrophylla at Chalimbana, Zambia. Field tensiometers were installed at 15, 30 and 45 cm depth, in fertilizer and unfertilized alleys within the double hedgerows, and the first, second and third rows of maize, and were monitored throughout one maize growing season in 1989/1990. In general, maize growth (indicated by height and dry matter measured at roughly fortnightly interval) was higher (P <0.01) in fertilized alleys than in unfertilized alleys, and there were no differences between Leucaena and Flemingia alleys. In both fertilized and unfertilized alleys, the maize plants were 20% shorter (P <0.01) in the first row (nearer the hedgerows) than in the second and third maize rows. Maize dry matter yield was 30% more (P<0.01) in unfertilized Flemingia alleys than in corresponding Leucaena alleys. The grain yield was similar in the fertilized alleys of Leucaena and Flemingia. However, in unfertilized alleys, the grain yield in Flemingia alloys was 50% more than that of the corresponding Leucaena alleys. The fertilized alleys produced twice as much grain as unfertilized alleys when hedgerow prunings were added to the plots. The prunings as a source of nutrient did not appear to have any noticeable effect on crop productivity. The soil moisture content under both Leucaena and Flemingia hedgerow was higher than under the maize rows in the alleys throughout the growing season. The study shows that, under conditions of low fertility and no addition of fertilizers, Leucaena is twice as competitive, as Flemingia for soil resources, and reduces yield of alley-cropped maize from 2.2 t ha-1 to 0.7 t ha-1. If, however, fertilizer is added, there are no short-term differences between the two hedgerow species. © 1994.

AB  - Natural abundance of 15N (δ 15N) of leaves harvested from tropical plants in Brazil and Thailand was analyzed. The δ 15N values of non-N2-fixing trees in Brazil were +4.5±1.9‰, which is lower than those of soil nitrogen (+8.0±2.2‰). In contrast, mimosa and kudzu had very low δ 15N values (-1.4≈+0.5‰). The δ 15N values of Panicum maximum and leguminous trees, except Leucaena leucocephala, were similar to those of non-N2-fixing trees, suggesting that the contribution of fixed N in these plants is negligible. The δ 15N values of non-N2-fixing trees in Thailand were +4.9±2.0‰. Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania grandiflora, Casuarina spp. and Cycas spp. had low δ 15N values, close to the value of atmospheric N2 (0‰), pointing to a major contribution of N2 fixation in these plants. Cassia spp. and Tamarindus indica had high δ 15N values, which confirms that these species are non-nodulating legumes. The δ 15N values of Acacia spp. and Gliricidia sepium and other potentially nodulating tree legumes were, on average, slightly lower than those of non-N2-fixing trees, indicating a small contribution of N2 fixation in these legumes. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Thirty-two multipurpose tree species were screened for their potential for planting under irrigated conditions on reclaimed land in the Nile Valley. The 11 most promising specics, in terms of survival and early growth, were evaluated in terms of wood biomass production 42 months after planting. In addition, the fodder quality of six of the species was assessed in terms of nutritive value. The highest wood biomass producers were, in decreasing order, Leucaena leucocephala, Casuarina cummingkamiana and Acacia saligna. Leucaena collinsii ssp. zacapana had the most nutritious leaves, with high crude protein combined with low fibre content. © 1993 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - A field screening trial of ten exotic multipurpose trees and shrubs was initiated in August 1987 in Yaounde, Cameroon. The objective of the study was to identify adaptable species with desirable traits that could be used for agroforestry systems recommended for the humid lowlands of Cameroon. The species included were Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia mangium, Calliandra calothyrus, Cassia javanica, Cassiaa siamea, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Paraserianthes falcataria, Sesbania grandiflora and Sesbania sesban. Results suggested that the two Sesbania species were poorly adapted to the region (based on survival rate). P. falcataria and Calliandra calothyrsus were among the fastest growing species and their foliage had high nutrient values, making them promising candidates for agroforestry technologies aimed at improving soil fertility. However, the coppicing ability of P. falcataria was below average. Primary growth of the Acacia species was relatively high, but they were poor coppicers. They could be useful as shade trees on cocoa or coffee farms, but are not suitable for hedgerow intercropping. © 1994.

AB  - Silages were prepared from the tropical grasses, pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens) and setaria (Setaria sphacelata), with the addition of molasses (4% w/w) and/or leaves (33%) from the leguminous trees leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium). All forages were grown at the University of Queensland farm in south eastern Queensland during 1985. These silages, together with hays made from these grasses and sorghum silage (13 diets) were fed to sheep to assess their nutritive value. All silages were well preserved, as indicated by low pH (3.5-4.4) low ammonia N (26–57 g/kg total N) and high lactic acid (73–95 % total acids) contents. The addition of legumes increased both the dry matter (DM) and total N (TN) contents of silages to the same extent as the addition of both legumes and molasses at ensiling. Sheep given silages prepared from pangola grass and legumes (molasses) consumed similar DM intakes (22.9-25.4 g/kg0.75per day) as sheep given pangola grass hay (23.9 g/kg0.75per day). Silage made from pangola grass + molasses was of low palatability (161 g/kg0.75per day). The digestibilities of silage DM (DMD) and its fibrous components were significantly (P < 0.05) lower (DMD 53.3-60.6%) than that of pangola hay (DMD 64.7%). Silages and hay made from setaria, and sorghum silage, were of lower nutritive value than those from pangola grass. The addition of leucaena and molasses increased silage DM intakes (21–1 g/kg0.75per day) above those for setaria hay and setaria + molasses silage (16.7 and 19.0 g/kg0.75per day respectively). The intakes of silages made from gliricidia (171 g/kg0.75per day) were significantly (P < 0.05) improved when molasses was included at ensiling (21–8 g/kg0.75per day). The digestibilities of silage DM were significantly (P <0.05) higher (DMD 53.6-60.4 than that of setaria hay (DMD 40.6). Liveweight change in sheep was significantly (P < 0–05) correlated with intakes of digestible DM (r2 = 0–74) and with N intake (r2= 0.82). The inclusion of legumes in the silages increased N retention and, for setaria silages, also increased rumen ammonia concentration. It was concluded that tropical grasses can be effectively ensiled by the addition of legumes alone and, with the exception of setaria/gliricidia silages, the resultant silages were of sufficiently high quality to merit their use in tropical animal production systems. © 1993, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - There are few commercial legumes available for sowing on the cracking clay soils of northeastern Queensland, where legumes are needed to improve quality of perennial native grass pastures and to arrest nitrogen decline in cropping land. To evaluate introduced legumes from heavy-textured soils, a replicated row experiment was established in 3 environments to assess the adaptation of 56 accessions from 37 species (22 genera). The sites were on 3 dark cracking clay soils supporting the following grasslands: Dichanthium -Bothriochloa- Astrebla; Dichanthium aristatum; and Cenchrus ciliaris on cleared Acacia harpophylla (brigalow) country.The main selection criteria during the 4-year evaluation were persistence, regeneration, production, and spread, with green leaf retention, nutrient concentrations, and pest susceptibility also being considered. The perennial legumes Clitoria ternatea (CPI 47 187 and CPI 49963), Desmanthus virgatus (CPI 78373), Leucaena leucocephala (CPI 61227 and cv. Cunningham), Stylosanthes scabra (CPI 55868), and Indigofera schimperi (CPI 69495), and annuals Centrosema pascuorum (CPI 55697), Desmodium dichotomum (CPI 47 186), and Vigna trilobata (CPI 47510), showed promise as pasture or short-term ley species for these clay soils (Vertisols) in subcoastal, north-eastern Queensland. Other species were identified that require evaluation of a wider range of genetic material. The role of perennial and annual sown legumes in pasture and cropping systems on these cracking clay soils is discussed. © 1994 CSIRO.

The combustion-related properties, moisture content, specific gravity and percentage element composition of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and ash in wood and charcoal from the two species were determined. The gross heat of combustion of wood and charcoal was also determined. There were significant differences in the moisture content, specific gravity and percentage element composition between wood and charcoal from the two species. The carbon and ash content of charcoal were higher than those of wood. The average heat of combustion of charcoal 25.25 MJKg-1 was higher than that of wood 13.75 MJKg-1. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Samples from 10 years old Leucaena leucocephala grown in plantation in Morogoro (Tanzania) were studied to determine suitable Kraft pupling conditions and pulp properties for paper production. For comparison, Eucalyptus wood already being used by Southern Paper mills in Tanzania was also analysed. Analysis followed ISO and Scandinavian standards. The results showed that L. leucocephala had an average basic density of 540 kg/m3 and an average fibre length of 1.125 mm with low decigrex number. Compared to Eucalyptus, L. leucocephala needed tougher cooking conditions. Kraft pulping of L. leucocephala with 20% effective alkali content and 2000 H-factor afforded a yield of 49.5% at a kappa number of 28. L. leucocephala wood like Eucalyptus needed low refining energy to improve some of its properties. Papersheets made from L. leucocephala pulp had low tearing strength, average tensile strength, high opacity and TEA-strength with good formation. Incorporating L. leucocephala pulp with other pulp types in paper making is recommended. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In an arid region of India, 4 year old high density ('energy') exotic plantations of Eucalyptus tereticornis Smith and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de wit (Hawaiin Giant K8), produced 7.2 t ha-1 year-1 and 7.5 t ha-1 year-1 of litter, respectively. It was nearly twice that produced from Acacia nilotica (L.) Willd ex Del, an indigenous species. Annual litter production in 8 year old plantations reached 11.9 t ha-1 in L. leucocephala, 9.1 t ha-1 in E. tereticornis and 5.4 t ha-1 in A. nilotica. Accumulation of litter was greatest in E. tereticornis, two- to four-fold higher than the other two species. After 1 year, the concentration of nitrogen in decomposing litter of L. leucocephala and A. nilotica decreased as a result of mineralization; in E. tereticornis, it increased as a result of immobilization. Immobilization of phosphorus was much higher than that of nitrogen, and it was more pronounced in branch than in leaf litter. As a result of immobilization and a slow rate of litter decomposition, E. tereticornis accumulated the greatest amount of nutrients in the standing litter. The implications of the results in the context of maintaining soil fertility are discussed. © 1993.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.) were grown together in an alley cropping system in a semi-arid area of India. The five treatments included sole millet (SM), sole leucaena (SL) planted in double rows to form hedges with an alley width of 2.8 m, and alley cropping treatments LM5, LM6, and LM6P with alley widths of 2.8, 3.3 and 3.3 m and five, six and six rows of millet, respectively. LM6P differed from LM6 in that a vertical polythene barrier separated the root systems of leucaena and millet to a depth of 50 cm. Dry matter production and light interception data for millet and leucaena are presented to allow comparison of light capture and utilisation efficiency by the two species under contrasting hedge management in the rainy seasons of 1986 and 1987. Dry matter yields of leucaena did not differ significantly between treatments in either rainy season, but were much higher in 1987 than in 1986 because of the less severe lopping regime. The higher yields in 1987 resulted from a greater mean fractional light interception by leucaena, which increased shading of alley cropped millet when compared with 1986. The dry matter yields of millet in treatments LM5 and LM6 were reduced relative to the sole crop in both years. In 1986, this reduction appeared to result primarily from shading, while in 1987 the mean fractional light interception and the pre-anthesis conversion coefficient were both lower in LM5 than in SM. Above- and below-ground competition interacted in 1986, so that when root competition was reduced (LM6P) the millet was able to grow taller, eventually matching the leucaena in height and partially escaping the shading and yield reduction experienced in LM5 and LM6. In 1987, the hedges were always more than 1 m taller than the millet and the root barrier failed to remove the detrimental competition between leucaena and millet. © 1992.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, Clitoria ternatea, Macroptilium atropurpureum cv. Siratro, Cassia rotundifolia cv. Wynn, Macrotyloma axillare cv. Archer, Stylosanthes guianensis var. guianensis cv. Graham, S. guianensis var. intermedia cv. Oxley, S. hamata cv. Verano and 5. scabra cv. Fitzroy and cv. Seca were screened for their ability to establish at five coastal sites of Maputo province, Mozambique. Three grazing treatments were imposed in strips: continuous access, dry-season-only access and an ungrazed control. Grazing pressure was dependent on the movement of communal cattle and goat herds. Mean seedling emergence ranged from a low of 28% for Graham to a high of 78% for Siratro. First season mean seedling vigour (1-10) differed (P=0.01) among entries and ranged from 4.0 for Graham to 8.0 for Seca. First-year dry season individual plant vigour showed an interaction (P=0.1) between grazing treatment and entry with Siratro and Seca plots averaging 3.0 or better. Dry season plot cover likewise showed an interaction (P=0.002) between treatment and entry with Siratro and Seca averaging over 20%. Second rainy season vigour showed differences (P=0.03) among species only, with Siratro and Seca having values over 7.0. Plot cover was likewise differentiated only among species (P=0.0006) with Siratro and Seca both covering 59% of their plots, superior to C. ternatea (19%), L. leucocephala (9%), Archer (7%), Verano (16%), Fitzroy (28%), Graham (29%), and Wynn (4%). Oxley (36%) was undifferentiated from either group. Overall, Siratro and Seca had the best establishment whilst Oxley showed promise. Deferred grazing generally appeared to have little effect on establishment. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The effect of perennial mulches on moisture status, soil characteristics and on crop yields (maize-wheat rotation) was evaluated from 1986 through 1989 in a silty loam acidic soil (pH 5.6, PWP 11.4 & FC 25.6%) at the Research Farm of the Central Soil & Water Conservation Research & Training Institute, Dahra Dun. Mulch materials, comprised of leaves of Leucaena leucocephala, Eucalyptus hybrid, Shorea robusta, Broussonatia paprifera or Puerarua hirsuta (chopped) @ 4 t/ha were applied just after sowing of wheat and the residual effect of applied mulch was seen in kharif maize each year. The distribution of profile moisture revealed that at the time of sowing of wheat the soil water content did not differ with depth (0-90 cm). With the advancement of time, the magnitude of moisture distribution changed. At various crop growth stages the highest amount of water was found in the plots mulched with S. robusta followed by E. hybrid. All the mulch materials, except B. paprifera, lowered the soil pH, the maximum effect was noted with E. hybrid (pH reduced from 5.6 to 5.0). After three years, N and K content of soil were found to be greatest with the application of L. leucocephala whereas the highest P content was observed in B. paprifera mulched plots. The highest wheat grain yield (2.46 t/ha) was recorded with L. leucocephala and minimum under control (2.11 t/ha) which represents a gain of 11.7 per cent. Maximum maize grain yield (0.73 t/ha) was found in S. robusta mulched plots followed by L. leucocephala (0.63 t/ha) and the minimum in the control (0.51 t/ha). © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The ruminal bacterium Synergistes jonesii strain 78-1, which is able to degrade the pyridinediol toxin in the plant Leucaena leucephala, was studied for its ability to utilise amino acids. The organism used arginine, histidine and glycine from a complex mixture of amino acids, and both arginine and histidine supported growth in a semi-defined medium. The products of (U-14C)-arginine metabolism were CO2 acetate, butyrate, citrulline and ornithine. The labelling pattern of end products from (U-14C)-histidine metabolism differed in that carbon also flowed into formate and propionate. Arginine was catabolised by the arginine deiminase pathway which was characterised by the presence of arginine deiminase, ornithine transcarbamylase and carbamate kinase. This is the first report of a rumen bacterium that uses arginine and histidine as major energy yielding substrates. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Rhizobium tropici strains are able to nodulate a wide range of host plants: Phaseolus vulgaris, Leucaena spp., and Macroptilium atropurpureum. We studied the nodD regulatory gene for nodulation of two R. tropici strains: CIAT899, the reference R. tropici type IIb strain, and BR816, a heat-tolerant strain isolated from Leucaena leucocephala. A survey revealed several nodD- hybridizing DNA regions in both strains: five distinct regions in CIAT899 and four distinct regions in BR816. Induction experiments of a nodABC-uidA fusion in combination with different nodD-hybridizing fragments in the presence of root exudates of the different hosts indicate that one particular nodD copy contributes to nodulation gene induction far more than any other nodD copy present. The nucleotide sequences of both nodD genes are reported here and show significant homology to those of the nodD genes of other rhizobia and a Bradyrhizobium strain. A dendrogram based on the protein sequences of 15 different NodD proteins shows that the R. tropici NodD proteins are linked most closely to each other and then to the NodD of Rhizobium phaseoli 8002.

AB  - Leaucaena leucocephala and Prosopis juliflora seedlings were grown in a sandy loam and loamy clay soil amended with three concentrations of NaCl with and without the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus fasciculatum and a Rhizobium isolate. After 16 weeks in glasshouse culture L. leucocephala and P. juliflora plants inoculated with G. fasciculatum and Rhizobium developed abundant vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhi-zae (VAM) and root nodules in the sandy loam soil without NaCl amendments. In contrast, root system colonization by both rhizosphere symbionts was reduced in the loamy clay soil. In the absence of NaCl, plants inoculated with combinations of VAM and rhizobia had significantly greater total dry weight, tissue phosphorus concentration, and leaf area compared to seedlings colonized with individual symbionts in both soils. Although NaCl amendments greater than 40 and 80 mM decreased mycorrhizal colonization, number of chlamydospores, and root system nodulation by rhizobia, dry weight and tissue P concentration of plants colonized with VAM fungi and rhizobia were generally larger than those of seedlings colonized with only rhizobia. These data suggest that dual inoculation with VAM fungi and rhizobia isolates may help Leucaena and Prosopis species mitigate the adverse effects of NaCl on juvenile growth and development. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 1993 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - The effects of adding two legumes, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala, cv. Cunningham, and molasses on the fermentation characteristics of silages made from two tropical grasses (Pangola grass, Digitaria decumbens, and Setaria sphacelata cv. Kazungula) were investigated. Pangola grass silages contained significantly higher contents of water-soluble carbohydrates and lactic acid than did setaria silages after 100 days fermentation, but there were no significant differences between the two silages in populations of lactic acid bacteria and contents of total N and NH3-N. Addition of either species of legume had no significant effect on fermentation acids and NH3-N contents, and numbers of lactic acid bacteria. Addition of both legumes reduced NH3-N production in the silages by 59% after 5 days' fermentation. Numbers of lactic acid bacteria were not significantly affected by the different treatments. Enterococcus faecalis represented 60% of the lactic acid bacteria isolated from the treated herbages prior to ensiling. By 100 days of fermentation, only lactobacilli were isolated: 82% homo-fermenters and 18% hetero-fermenters. Lactobacillus mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum was found only in the silage supplemented with 33% (w/w) legume. It was concluded that the low quality of tropical grasses used as feeds for ruminants may be significantly improved by ensiling these grasses with small amounts of molasses and with high-protein tree leaves. © 1994 Rapid Science Publishers.

AB  - Effects of tannery effluent (25, 50, 75 and 100%) have been studied on seed germination of Oryza sativa, Acacia holosericea and Leucaena leucocephala. Germination was inhibited by 25% and 50% and prevented by 75% and 100% of the tannery effluent. Leaf area, biomass and chlorophyll content of Gossypium hirsutum, Vigna mungo, Vigna uniquiclata and Lycopersicon esculentum of the control and the tannery effluent treated plants were examined. Leaf area (cm2) and biomass (g dry wt plant-1 of the tannery effluent-treated plants (25%) showed an increase over the control. Total protein and chlorophyll content (mg g-1 fresh wt) seemed to increase at 25% treatment. Compared to the control, the soil treated with tannery effluent was rich in Mg, Mn, Fe, Na and K ions. The effluent concentration at 75% and 100% (vol. by vol. in water) killed the plants and only 25% was found to be suitable for fertiliser use. © 1994.

Yields increased as the proportion of mulch applied increased but the extra increases obtained when more than half the foliage was applied as mulch were relatively small, suggesting that half the foliage may be removed as feed without detrimental effect. Soil organic carbon, nitrogen and available phosphorus tended to increase with increasing proportion of prunings applied as mulch. © 1993, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala seeds were found to be rich in proteins, but they contained a toxic amino acid, mimosine. Protein-isolation processes rendered the seed proteins relatively free of anti-nutritional factors. Proteins of L. leucocephala (K8) seed kernels were separated into different fractions on the basis of their solubility, by extracting successively and directly, with various solvents, i.e. water, sodium chloride (5%), and sodium hydroxide (0·05 m). Globulins were found to be the major proteins, followed by albumins, glutelins, and prolamins. The proteins in these fractions were further precipitated, after determining their isoelectric points (pH 2-2·5). The protein and mimosine contents of the soluble extracts (before protein precipitation) and their isoelectric protein precipitates, supernatants, and insoluble residues, were determined. Sodium chloride (5%) was found to be the solvent of choice, since it resulted in maximum protein yield. Furthermore, most of the extracted mimosine was left in the supernatant after the protein had been precipitated out. © 1993.

AB  - Levels of DNA relatedness between strains isolated from root nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris and reference strains of different Rhizobium species were determined by performing DNA-DNA hybridization experiments (S1 nuclease method). The nine strains examined were members of three genomic groups previously delineated by a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis among strains isolated from P. vulgaris at different sites in France. In agreement with the results of the restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, three genomic species were found. We confirmed that one of these species corresponded to Rhizobium leguminosarum since the strain examined was 100% related to the type strain of this species. The other two species were new genomic species which were less than 21% related to reference strains belonging to other Rhizobium species, including Rhizobium etli and Rhizobium tropici, and were 18% related to each other. As determined by an analysis of partial 16S ribosomal DNA sequences, each of the genomic species was found to belong to a lineage independent from the lineages of previously described Rhizobium species. Nevertheless, they were included in the group formed by the fast-growing Rhizobium species. Both genomic species 1 and genomic species 2 contained a majority of strains which were capable of nodulating both P. vulgaris and Leucaena leucocephala, like R. tropici. However, they also contained strains with a nodulation phenotype restricted to P. vulgaris, like R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli and R. etli bv. phaseoli. Our data are the first evidence that in Europe species other than R. leguminosarum nodulate P. vulgaris.

AB  - Sixteen multipurpose tree and shrub species (MPTs) for agroforestry were planted in a screening trial at Chalimbana near Lusaka, Zambia in December 1987. The trial was at 1280 m altitude on a sandy loam belonging to the luvisol-pharzem soil group, under unimodal rainfall (mean 880 mm). One year after planting all the 16 species except Sesbania grandiflora showed excellent survival. Sesbania sesban, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus grandis, Leucaena leucocephala, Cassia siamea, Flemingia congesta and Acacia polyacantha var. compylacantha grew fast with high volume and biomass production. An assessment made 28 months after planting showed these species to be 3.5-6.8 m in height, 8.0-14.3 cm basal diameter, 10-57 m3 ha-1 standing volume and 19.0-57.7 tons ha-1 above ground biomass (dry weight basis). Sesbania species had short life-spans (1 year for Sesbania macrantha and 2.5 years for Sesbania sesban) but had outstanding growth and biomass production. This makes them ideal candidate MPTs for improved fallows, enrichment of fodder banks and green manure production. L. leucocephala, Cassia siamea and F. congesta have potential for testing in alley cropping, rotational fallows and other technologies while Acacia polyacantha can be tested in mixed intercropping. Acacia albida, Acacia ataxacantha, Afzelia quanzensis, Sterculia africanum, Albizia adianthifolia, Casuarina cunninghamiana and Ventilago viminalis showed slow growth. © 1994.

AB  - Highest Leucaena leucocephala biomass yield (13.4 t ha-1y-1) was obtained in the Dry Zone on Entisols with a pH of 6.0 indicating its adaptability to non-acid soils in dry area. In another trial, application and incorporation of 30 kg palm-1 fresh loppings of Leucaena as a green manure around the palm showed that nutrients released from its decomposition could provide the entire nitrogen and about 20% of phosphorus and potassium requirements of an adult palm. The beneficial effects of Leucaena on soil physico-chemical properties were demonstrated by a substantial iprovement on Ultisols in terms of incresed organic carbon content (45%) and water holding capacity (82%) and reduced bulk density (3%) over the control. The enhanced earthworm activity in Leucaena plots further indicated its significant role in soil improvement. -from Authors

AB  - Land degradation by soil erosion in the biomass-starved foot-hill ecosystem of the sub-tropical northern India promted us to study the production and conservation potential of two agroforestry systems (AFS) namely (i) Leucaena leucocephala (K-8) for fuelwood at 2 m × 2 m spacing in upper and Leucaena (El Salvador) at 0.5 m × 0.5 m spacing for fodder in lower canopy (LL), (ii) Leucaena as above in upper and napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) for fodder in lower canopy (LN). These were compared with (iii) the traditional rainfed crop sequence of sesame followed by rapeseed (SR) and (iv) an absolute control of cultivated fallow (CF) on 20 m × 8 m uniform runoff plots having a 2% slope and a typical light-textured eroded gravelly soil (Udic Ustocrepts). The 3 years (1986-1988) mean monsoon season runoff with 816 mm rainfall was 4.4, 11.2, 20.5 and 23.0%, soil erosion loss 0.28, 1.03, 2.69 and 5.63 tonnes, N loss 6.6, 19.5, 42.5 and 51.3 kg and K loss 1.2, 1.8, 3.0 and 5.0 kg·ha-1·yr-1, from LN, LL, SR and CF, respectively. The soil profile of SR indicated a net deficit of 15, 2 and 14 kg but that of LN and LL a gain of 38, 10 and 20 kg and 66, 26 and 57 kg·ha-1 of available N, P and K in 4 years. The AFS were more conservation effective than traditional crops on eroded marginal soil and hence suggested for inclusion in the basket of conservation technologies. © 1994.

AB  - Casuarina equisetifolia plantation forests of five yr and eight yr age in dry tropics of Shaktinagar, Sonebhadra in Vindhyan plateau were studied for N cycling through vegetation, litter and soil pool and compared with similar work on subtropical actinorhizal Alnus nepalensis and tropical rhizobial Leucaena leucocephala. Interannual variation in nitrogenase activity was observed with a maximum in July-August while peak N-accretion was in September-October. N input through foliage litter accounted for 85-95% of total litter N, of which 90% was released through decomposition in one year, whereas in Alnus only 60% of the litter N was annually released. The contribution of biological N2 fixation to total N uptake was maximum in Casuarina (37%) followed by Alnus (33%) and Leucaena (16%). Casuarina successfully covers the thin soil profile of freshly degraded Vindhyan hills and restores the soil N fertility. -Authors

AB  - Some conservation based agroforestry systems (AFS) were developed for possible adoption in place of high risk rainfed farming on land capability classes Ito IV of a typical topo-sequence of foothill north India. The agri-silvi-horticulture system integrating leucaena, lemon, papaya and turmeric on class I irrigated land provided sustainable mean net returns of Rs. 17066 against Rs. 7852 ha.-1 yr.-1 from double cropped agricultural system. The intercropping of cluster beans with leucaena gave the highest net returns of Rs. 3540 ha.-1 yr.-1 in the agri-silvicultural system adopted on class II land. Eucalyptus terettcornis (Smith) in top and Bhabbar grass (Eulaliopsis binata Retz) in the understorey on a sandy loam class III land gave four years (1985-1988) mean air dry grass yield of 4.2 (used for paper pulp) from October and 1.19 t. ha-1 yr.-1 (used for fodder) from June cut. The net returns from grass alone were Rs. 4672 against Rs. 1679 ha.-1 yr.-1 from rainfed field crops raised on an adjoining plot. The returns from trees would be additional. Bhabbar grass raised under Acacia species on a 25 to 30% sloping gravelly class IV land provided yield varying from 2.18 to 4.31 from October cut and 0.50 to 1.1 t. ha.-1 yr.-1 from June cut with 6 years mean of 3.9 t. ha.-1 yr.-1 which at 1988 prices provided net returns of Rs. 2402 ha-1. These AFS proved superior to traditional farming on each land capability class. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Four silage diets were prepared from tropical grass and legume mixtures and fed to intestinally fistulated sheep to determine the sites and extent of digestion of the different silage components in the digestive tract. Pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens) was ensiled either alone or with the addition, 33% (w/w), of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham), gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) or cowpea (Vigna unguiculata cv. Caloona). All forages were grown at the University of Queensland farm in 1985. All silages were well preserved as indicated by low pH (< 4.1), ammonia N (< 9% total N), acetic acid (< 13 g/kg dry matter (DM)) and ethanol (< 19 g/kg DM) contents, and high DM (> 290 g/kg) and lactic acid (> 41 g/kg DM) contents. The inclusion of leucaena and gliricidia significantly increased the total N content of the silages. The addition of legumes at ensiling significantly increased rumen ammonia N (pangola 59 mg N/l, legume diets 110–115 mg N/l) and the proportion of propionic acid in rumen fluid. Sheep given pangola + leucaena silages had significantly higher DM intakes (66.3 g/kg W0.75per day) than sheep given pangola and pangola + cowpea silages (52.4 and 53.2 g/kg W0.75per day respectively). The inclusion of gliricidia significantly depressed silage intake (43T g/kg W0.75per day). There were no significant effects of diet on DM (551–609 g/kg) and organic matter (550–612 g/kg) digestibility. Sheep given pangola + leucaena silages had higher N intakes, N balances, rates and efficiencies of microbial N synthesis and total non-ammonia N (NAN) flows to the small intestine than did sheep given the other silages. Apparent degradabilities of silage N in the rumen were similar for all diets (0.491–0.559 g N/kg N intake), but sheep given pangola + leucaena silages had lower true (corrected for endogenous N) N degradabilities (0.648 g N/kg N intake) than those given the other diets (0.751–0.775 g N/kg N intake). The values obtained in this experiment were compared with those reported for temperate grass silages, and it was concluded that whilst the digestibility of tropical grass/legume silages was low, intakes and rumen fermentation characteristics were similar to those found for temperate grass silages. © 1993, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Field experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of alley cropping vegetable crops with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit for two seasons on a sandy loam Oxic paleustalf in southwestern Nigeria. Four vegetable crops (Amaranthus cruentus L.; Celosia argentea L.; Okra, Hibiscus esculentus L.; and tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) were grown in control plots and in 4-m wide alleys between established Leucaena hedgerows without and with fertilizer (30 N-13 P-24 K kg ha-1). Leucaena prunings yielded large dry biomass and nutrients during both seasons. Yield of four vegetable crops responded more to fertilizer in control than in alley cropped treatments. Better yield of vegetables in alley cropped plots was in part due to following effect of the Leucaena hedgerows. Fertilizer application increased mean yields of Amaranthus, Celosia, okra and tomato by 325, 164, 47 and 94% in control plots and by 36, 26, 4 and 20% in alley cropped plots, respectively. For both seasons, yields were not significantly different between alley cropped with and without fertilizer and the control with fertilizer treatments. Yield was least in control without fertilizer. Alley cropping with Leucaena can reduce fertilizer requirement for vegetable production. Cost and return analysis using 1988 prices indicated that alley cropping with vegetable crops can be profitable. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The effect of feeding maize (Zea mays L.) husk and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) as a mixture or separately on the voluntary intake of maize husk was studied over a 40-day period. Ten male goats with an average weight of 15 kg were used. The maize husk intake and total dry matter intake for the two feeding methods was about the same. Thus, total dry matter intake was not affected (P<0.05) by the feeding method. There was also no significant difference (P<0.05) between the two feeding methods in the digestibility values. The data were considered to indicate that there were no significant differences in the intake of maize husk when fed in a mixture with leucaena or when offered separately but at the same time. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The effects of green manuring with Sesbania aculeata, or with Leucaena leucocephala leaves and of weed incorporation on the physical properties of a clay loam soil under a rice-wheat rotation were compared at New Delhi, India, in 1986–87. Under puddled conditions, the volumetric moisture content of the saturated topsoils varied from 0.400 cm3/cm3 in the Sesbania-treated plots to 0.425 cm3/cm3 in plots receiving no green manure, but in the unsaturated soils at rice harvest the corresponding values were 0.317 and 0.271 cm3/cm3. The effects of the green manures on the water content of the soils were still evident after a subsequent wheat crop. Other soil physical properties affected by the treatments were the following (data refer to topsoils measured after the rice harvest): settling index (cm/cm), an estimate of structural instability, which ranged from 25.5% (Sesbania-treated plots), to 28.6 % (weed incorporation), 29.7% (Leucaena-treated plots) and to 33.5% (NPK-fertilizer only). Soil dispersion increased from 6.0 to 10.0 g/100 g through the same treatment sequence. Hydraulic conductivity in the NPK-fertilizer only plots was 3.1 cm/day, but increased to 4.8 cm/day in the Sesbania-treated plots. Sesbania was superior to the other green manures for improving soil physical properties after its incorporation. © 1994, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, an approach involving a double isotope (15N and 34S) labelling technique was used to examine which of five reference crops (Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Cassia siamea, Cassia spectabilis, Lolium perenne and Eucalyptus grandis) would be suitable for measuring N fixed by Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala. The rationale is that the ratio of fertilizer-derived S to soil-derived S in a suitable reference crop is similar to that measured in the nitrogen fixing tree (NFT) since the N ratios in the two crop types cannot be measured directly. E. camaldulensis and E. grandis were found to be suitable reference crops because they absorbed fertilizer and soil S in the same ratio as G. sepium and L. leucocephala. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The natural 15N abundance method was used to trace the sources of N in a stand of Leucaena leucocephala and its understorey species. Changes in the δ15 N of various above-ground parts of the L. leucocephala trees and understorey vegetation were monitored for 6 yr. The resulting data provide the first direct evidence of internal N cycling between a N2-fixing tree and non-N2-fixing understorey species within an agro-ecosystem. The δ15N of all tree parts and understorey vegetation decreased with time. One year after the plantation was established, the non-N2-fixing understorey species exhibited a significant enrichment in 15N relative to the L. leucocephala. At 4 and 6 yr after planting, however, the δ15N value of the understorey vegetation had decreased significantly and was nearly identical to that of the L. leucocephala. The decline in δ15N values of the understorey species was attributed to net N-mineralization of plant parts shed by L. leucocephala, and to root exudation and decay. That is, a portion of the N2 fixed during the early stages of tree growth was made available to the understorey species through the decomposition and subsequent incorporation into the available soil-N pool of the abscissed L. leucocephala parts. This indicates that there was a tight coupling between N2 fixation and the availability of net mineralized N. The natural 15N abundance method appears to provide a suitable means by which the fate of fixed-N in a forest ecosystem can be monitored, provided the difference between the initial (δ15N value of the N2-fixing and non-N2-fixing (reference) species is of sufficient magnitude. The rate of change in the δ15N value of the understorey species can provide valuable insights into the intensity of net N-mineralization and N-cycling. © 1994.

AB  - Five tropical soils were either not inoculated or inoculated with the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungus Glomus aggregatum. The degree to which VAM effectiveness was expressed in the soils was evaluated prior and after solution P status was adjusted for optimal VAM activity. VAM effectiveness determined by monitoring P concentrations of pinnules of Leucaena leucocephala leaves as a function of time and as dry matter yield determined at the time of harvest, indicated that in three of the soils VAM effectiveness was either very restricted or altogether unexpressed irrespective of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (VAMF) inoculation if soil solution P was not optimized for VAM effectiveness. After P optimization, effectiveness was significantly increased by VAMF inoculation although in four of the soils, densities of indigenous VAMF propagules greatly exceeded that attained by the inoculum after it was mixed with soil. Mycorrhizal fungal inoculation effects varied from soil to soil, depending on the extent to which the effectiveness of indigenous and introduced endophytes was enhanced by P optimization and the similarity of inherent soil solution P concentrations to the range known to be optimum for VAM effectiveness. Of the indicator variables monitored, VAMF colonization was least sensitive to treatment effects followed by shoot P concentration measured at the time of harvest. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Experience with browse plants in Australia is briefly reviewed in terms of their forage value to animals, their economic value to the landholder and their ecological contribution to landscape stability. Of the cultivated species only two have achieved any degree of commercial acceptance (Leucaena leucocephala and Chamaecytisus palmensis). Both of these are of sufficiently high forage value to be used as the sole source of feed during seasonal periods of nutritional shortage. Both are also leguminous shrubs that establish readily from seed. It is suggested that a limitation in their present use is the reliance on stands of single species which leaves these grazing systems vulnerable to disease and insects. Grazing systems so far developed for high production and persistence of cultivated species involve short periods of intense grazing followed by long periods of recovery. Similar management may be necessary in the arid and semi-arid rangelands where palatable browse species are in decline. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Studies on two varieties of Leucaena leucocephala, K8 and K28, whole seeds and seed fractions (kernel and hull), revealed that it is primarily the seed kernel portion of the seed that is a potential source of protein. Trypsin inhibitors, amylase inhibitors and cyanogenetic glycosides were found to be absent, while urease activity, amylase activity, saponins and haemagglutinins were present in the seeds. Reduction in urease activity on heating L. leucocephala seeds could be taken as an index of the reduction in mimosine content, particularly when the seeds were given high temperature treatments (e.g. autoclaving). © 1994 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - A detailed study of the soil chemical and physical properties in seven-year-old alley cropping trial containing Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia congesta in Northern Zambia is described. There was a strong correlation between the maize yield and the total amount of nitrogen applied, both from prunings and fertiliser, suggesting that a major reason for the observed benefit from alley cropping, particularly with Leucaena, was due to an improvement in nitrogen supply. Leucaena produced significantly more biomass, and its leaves had higher concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium and lower C/N and C/P ratios than did those of Flemingia. There was also evidence that the trees had a beneficial effect on other soil chemical properties; under the hedgerows, particularly those of Leucaena, there were higher levels of organic carbon, Mg, K and ECEC, and pH values were also highest. It is suggested that higher levels of organic carbon in the alley crop treatments were responsible for the improvements observed in soil physical properties. Lower bulk density, lower penetration resistance, and a higher infiltration rate and pore volume fraction were measured in the alley crops, although there was no significant change in the soil water release parameters. A deteriorating effect of constant applications of nitrogen fertiliser on soil fertility was observed; as the level of urea application increased, there were significant decreases in Mg, K and pH, increases in Al and soil acidity, and higher penetrometer resistance. These results highlight the urgent need for further research on biological methods of maintaining soil fertility. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Earthworm surface casting activity was monitored in Leucaena leucoccephala alley cropping and a no-tree control system. Under L. leucocephala hedgerows, five times more casts (116.8 Mg ha-1 year-1) were deposited than in the inter-row space (24.3 Mg ha-1 year-1) and the no-tree control plots (27.8 Mg ha-1 year-1). Hyperiodrilus africanus and Eudrilus eugeniae were the dominant species in alley and no-tree control plots, respectively. Amounts of nutrients returned to the soil surface by casting were lowest in the no-tree control due to low nutrient concentration in casts of Eudrilus sp. In alley cropping (weighted average of amounts under hedgerow and inter-row space), three times more N, K, Ca, and Mg were recycled to the surface than in the no-tree control plots. The relative contribution of casts to nutrient cycling in alley cropping (nutrients in L. leucocephala prunings plus casts = 100%) was 33% N, 16% P, 6% K, 16% Ca, and 34% Mg. Permanent shading of the vicinity of hedgerows was identified as the most important factor enhancing casting activity. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Insertion sequence (IS) element ISRLdTAL1145-1 from Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena diversifolia) strain TAL 1145 was entrapped in the sacB gene of the positive selection vector pUCD800 by insertional inactivation. A hybridization probe prepared from the whole 2.5-kb element was used to determine the distribution of homologous sequences in a diverse collection of 135 Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium strains. The IS probe hybridized strongly to Southern blots of genomic DNAs from 10 rhizobial strains that nodulate both Phaseolus vulgaris (beans) and Leucaena leucocephala (leguminous trees), 1 Rhizobium sp. that nodulates Leucaena spp., 9 R. meliloti (alfalfa) strains, 4 Rhizobium spp. that nodulate Sophora chrysophylla (leguminous trees), and 1 nonnodulating bacterium associated with the nodules of Pithecellobium dulce from the Leucaena cross-inoculation group, producing distinguishing IS patterns for each strain. Hybridization analysis revealed that ISRLdTAL1145- 1 was strongly homologous with and closely related to a previously isolated element, ISRm USDA1024-1 from R. meliloti, while restriction enzyme analysis found structural similarities and differences between the two IS homologs. Two internal segments of these IS elements were used to construct hybridization probes of 1.2 kb and 380 bp that delineate a structural similarity and a difference, respectively, of the two IS homologs. The internal segment probes were used to analyze the structures of homologous IS elements in other strains. Five types of structural variation in homolog IS elements were found. The predominate IS structural type naturally occurring in a strain can reasonably identify the strain's cross-inoculation group relationships. Three IS structural types were found in Rhizobium species that nodulate beans and Leucaena species, one of which included the designated type IIB strain of R. tropici (CIAT 899). Weak homology to the whole IS probe, but not with the internal segments, was found with two Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains. The taxonomic and ecological implications of the distribution of ISRLdTAL1145-1 are discussed.

AB  - The results of a field trial conducted at the Livestock Research Station, Thiruvazhamkunnu, Kerala to study the compatibility of different components in a silvo-pastoral system revealed that growth and yield of fodder species were significantly influenced by the tree components only after tree canopy formation. The fodder species such as Pennisetum purpureum Schum., Panicum maximum Jacq., Brachiaria ruziziensis Griseb. and Euchlaena mexicana Schrad. grown in association with Casuarina equisetifolia J. R. & G. Forst. and Ailanthus malabarica DC recorded comparatively higher forage yield even after canopy formation. However, forage crops grown in combination with Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. registered relatively lower values for growth and yield. Increased light infiltration into the understorey due to the cladophyllous canopy can be attributed as reason for the higher fodder productivity under Casuarina. Due to the combination of crown size and shape, tree height and spacing the amount of light intercepted by Ailanthus also was very low. Among the four multi-purpose trees used, Acacia recorded the maximum growth rate followed by Casuarina, Ailanthus and Leucaena. Forage productivity of the four species was in the order: Pennisetum purpureum > Panicum maximum > Brachiaria ruziziensis > Euchlaena mexicana. Casuarina with Pennisetum/ Panicm were found to be optimal tree - forage combinations for silvo-pastoral systems. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Three methods were used to study N2 fixation and effects of water deficit on N2 fixation: C2H2 reduction assay (ARA), 15N dilution technique and accumulated N content. In addition, 15N dilution was calculated both in a traditional way and in a modified way, which takes into consideration N and 15N content for the plants before the experiment started. The three methods were applied on the following Rhizobium-symbioses: Acacia albida Del (Faidherbia albida (Del) A. Chev.) and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit., and the Frankia-symbiosis Casuarina equisetifolia L. The plants wereabout 4-months-old when they were harvested.Nitrogen derived from N2 fixation in control plants of Acacia albida was 54·2 mg as measured with ARA, while it was 28·5 mg as measured with the 15N dilution technique, compared to 30·7 mg calculated as accumulated N. In comparison, L. leucocephala fixed 41·6 mg N (ARA), 53·5 mg N(15N dilution technique) and 56·3 mg N (accumulated N). The Frankia-symbiosis had fixed 27·4 mg N as measured by ARA, 8·1 mg N as measured by 15N dilution technique and 12·3 mg N as accumulated N. There were no differences between the estimates based ontraditional and modified ways of calculating 15N dilution.The immediate effect of water deficit treatment on N2 fixation was continuously measured inall species with ARA, which started to decrease approximately 10 d after the initiation of the treatment, and declined to less than 5% of the initial level after 21-28 d.The decrease in the amount of N derived from N2 fixation was studied in L. leucocephala during the period of treatment. There was a 26% decrease in amount of N derived from N2 fixation as result of water deficit (as measured with ARA), while the decrease was 23% when measured withboth the 15N dilution method and as accumulated N.The three different methods for measuring N2 fixation and effects of water deficit on N2 fixation are discussed. © 1993 Oxford University Press.

AB  - The nutritional effects of pollen from cassava, oil palm, castor bean, Leucaena leucocephala and a phloem exudate from cassava were tested in the laboratory for their effect on survivorship and oviposition of Amblyseius idaeus (Denmark & Muma). Survival and longevity of even-aged females were enhanced on the aforementioned non-prey diets when compared with the control of no food. Castor bean pollen provided sufficient nutrition to induce an irregular and low ovipositional rate of A. idaeus over a five week interval. Oviposition ceased after 48 h in the presence of the other non-prey foods or free-water only. These studies suggest that A. idaeus is capable of switching or supplementing its diet with non-prey foods during periods when spider mite populations are low. © 1993 Science and Technology Letters.

AB  - Trees in the field in Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines, were treated with fenvalerate to remove all insects. Four days later, numbers of psyllid adults per shoot and the percentage of trees recolonized were 76-84 amd 65% lower, respectively, for L. collinsii compared with the susceptible control L. leucocephala. Numbers of eggs oviposited on L. collinsii were 46 and 63% lower than on L. leucocephala in field and laboratory, respectively. There was also well over 90% reduction in adult eclosion, a small adult size and 67% reduction in nymphal survival on L. collinsii than on L. leucocephala. Premature leaflet senescence and abscission as well as intraspecific competition for feeding sites on L. collinsii may have a severe effect on nymphal survival. -from Authors

AB  - Phenotypic and genetic characterization indicated that Hup+ bean rhizobial strains are type IIA and type IIB Rhizobium tropici. The Hup+ strain USDA 2840, which did not cluster with either of the two types of R. tropici in a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, had electrophoretic patterns of PCR products generated with primers for repetitive extragenic palindromic and enterobacterial repetitive intergeneric consensus sequences similar to those of three reference strains of R. tropici type IIA. The Hup+ strain USDA 2738, which clustered with the reference strain of R. tropici IIB in a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, had electrophoretic patterns of PCR products generated with primers for repetitive extragenic palindromic and enterobacterial repetitive intergeneric consensus sequences more closely resembling those of the reference strains of R. tropici type IIA than those of type IIB. DNA amplification with the Y1 and Y2 primers to generate a portion of the 16S rDNA operon was useful to distinguish R. tropici type IIA strains from other bean rhizobial strains. The phylogenetic position of the type IIA strain of R. tropici USDA 2840, determined from the partial 16S rDNA sequence, indicated a more distant relationship with the type IIB strain of R. tropici CIAT899 than with the as yet unnamed rhizobial species of Leucaena leucocephala, TAL 1145. Therefore, we suggest that it may be appropriate either to separate R. tropici types IIA and IIB into two different species or to identify TAL 1145 to the species level as a third type of R. tropici.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.) were grown together in an alley cropping system in a semi-arid area of India. The five treatments included sole millet (SM), sole leucaena (SL) planted in double rows to form hedges with an alley width of 2.8 m, and alley cropping treatments LM5, LM6 and LM6P with alley widths of 2.8, 3.3 and 3.3 m, respectively. Millet rows within the alleys were spaced at 47 cm, giving five rows in LM5 and six rows in both LM6 and LM6P. LM6P differed from LM6 in that a vertical polythene barrier separated the root systems of leucaena and millet to a depth of 50cm. Light interception, wind speed, saturation deficit and air, soil and leaf temperatures were monitored during the 1986 and 1987 rainy seasons in treatments SM, SL and LM5. This paper describes the experimental design and instrumentation and presents representative diurnal time courses illustrating the nature of the microclimatic changes associated with alley cropping. These indicate that alley cropping altered the microclimate experienced by millet to an extent which depended on its proximity to the hedge, hedge shape and the relative size of the two components. The larger leucaena canopy in 1987 than in 1986 resulted in more substantial reductions in wind speed and incident light in the alleys of LM5 as compared with SM. Leaf and soil temperatures within the alleys tended to be warmer during the night and cooler during the day than in SM and temperature differences between rows within LM5 were related to the degree of shading by leucaena. Analysis of integrated data predicted little effect of the observed changes in saturation deficit on the productivity of millet, while thermal time analysis for 1987 suggested a 2-3 day delay in flowering for millet adjacent to the hedge as compared with sole millet. © 1992.

AB  - Fifteen multipurpose tree species native and introduced to the matorral (low dry shrubland and forest) of the Gulf Coastal Plain in north-eastern Mexico were planted in monoculture in four randomized blocks. Measurements of various growth parameters and volume of trees over the first five years were evaluated. Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. microtheca, Leucaena leucocephala (exotic species) and Parkinsonia aculeata (native species) performed best while Prosopis glandulosa, Helietta parvifolia and Acacia rigidula (native species) did not establish well due to biotic problems which arose under plantation conditions. Acacia farnesiana, A. wrightii and two Pithecellobium spp. (native species) showed high yields which is of great interest since their multipurpose potential is the best of all fifteen species. These species could be of great importance in rehabilitating badly degraded parts of the matorral before such areas deteriorate to an irreversible desertified condition. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Farmer participation in experimenting with technologies in Mono province (Benin) increased when attention was focused on their major problems. One such problem is soil degradation caused by over-exploitation of land. Four different low external input technologies, all with leguminous components and half of them based on agroforestry, have been tested since 1990 by sub-groups of farmers, who all belong to a discussion group focussing on this problem. The technologies are: (i) a short season fallow of Mucuna pruriens var. utilis; (ii) an improved perennial tree fallow of Acacia auriculiformis; (iii) a short season fallow of pigeonpea; and (iv) an alley-cropping system on the basis of alternating hedgerows of Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala. The first two technologies were aimed at the regeneration of very degraded plots, while the latter two technologies concentrate on stabilising still moderately fertile land. Some impressions and results are discussed. © 1993.

AB  - In an in vitro study an attempt was made to examine the effect of iron as ferric chloride at the 0, 4 and 8 g kg-1 level and copper as cupric sulphate at 0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mg kg-1 of dry matter (DM) on ruminal mimosine degradation and fermentation of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal during 24 h incubation. Further, short-term (10 days) in vivo studies were conducted on feeding of copper sulphate treated (Cu 10 mg kg-1 DM) leucaena to cross-bred calves. Iron at the 8 g kg-1 level and copper at the 10 mg kg-1 level and onwards decreased ammonia nitrogen in the rumen liquor in vitro. However total nitrogen, microbial protein synthesis, total volatile fatty acids and their individual proportions remained unaffected due to these trace minerals. In vitro mimosine degradation was reduced (P < 0.05) from 87.41 to 82.62 at an iron level of 4 g kg-1 or above. A copper level of 10 mg kg-1 and above significantly (P < 0.05) decreased mimosine degradation (from 85.75 to 78.80). Apparently DM intake, DM digestibility, organic matter digestibility increased by 0.68 % units per 100 kg live weight, 3.12 % units and 2.46 % units, respectively, in calves fed copper treated leucaena. Mimosine intake was higher in the copper treated group (0.512 g as compared with 0.319 g per kg live weight) but the 3,4-DHP excretion mimosine ingestion ratio was 0.345 as compared with 0.412 in the untreated group. Hence, in vitro and in vivo studies revealed reduced mimosine degradation due to copper supplementation of the leucaena diet. © 1994.

AB  - Browse and grain legumes offer considerable potential for enhancing animal productivity in the tropics. However, a major factor limiting the wider use of these plants is the ubiquitous distribution of a diverse array of natural compounds which are capable of precipitating adverse effects in animals. Manifestations of toxicity range from a marked reduction in animal performance and nutrient utilisation to profound neurological effects and increased mortality. This review identifies the primary anti-nutritional factors in tropical legumes and evaluates the prospects for their detoxification. Although protease inhibitors are widely distributed in legume forage and grains, their role appears to be secondary to that of other toxic compounds. Recent studies highlight the dominant impact of lectins in determining the nutritional value of seeds of Psophocarpus tetragonolobus (winged bean) and Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean). The presence of condensed tannins is a characteristic feature of many browse legumes, including Gliricidia sepium, Acacia species, Leucaena leucocephala and Albizia falcataria. These polyphenolic compounds are sometimes accorded with beneficial attributes in ruminant nutrition by virtue of their capacity to suppress bloat and to prevent excessive degradation of high-quality leaf protein in the rumen. However, with respect to the condensed tannins of tropical forage legumes, there is increasing evidence of toxicity in all classes of livestock, including ruminants. The occurrence of toxic non-protein amino acids is a distinguishing feature of many forage and grain legumes. These amino acids contribute significantly to the toxicity of Leucaena leucocephala, Canavalia ensiformis and Lathyrus species. The distribution of several anti-nutritional factors in a single legume species causes difficulties with detoxification, particularly if the deleterious compounds are heat stable. Significant experimental procedures have recently been described for the detoxification of the winged bean and the jack bean, and these methods now await economic appraisal. The treatment of harvested leaves or the spraying of leguminous shrubs with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to alleviate the deleterious effects of condensed tannins is a comparatively recent innovation worthy of further investigation, particularly in view of striking improvements in the performance of sheep fed Acacia aneura. The most no'able advance in detoxification relates to biotechnological manipulation of rumen function, enabling cattle grazing Leucaena forage to degrade the deleterious amino acid, mimosine, to innocuous residues. The prospects for exploiting this technique in the detoxification of other tropical legumes and forage plants hould now be considered. However, the scope for any significant role of leguminous leaf meals in the utrition of non-ruminant animals now appears to be limited, despite recent advances in detoxificaion. In the case of these feedingstuffs, the major constraints are the intrinsic low digestibility of the protein fraction and the inferior metabolisable energy content relative to that of the legume grains. © 1992.

AB  - Scarce and poor-quality food resources limit smallholder dairy production in the tropics. Food resources for zerograzing may be improved by intercropping Pennisetum purpureum (napier grass) with Leucaena leucocephala leguminous hedgerows. To evaluate dairy cow performance from this alley cropping system, 36 Ayrshire/Brown Swiss × Sahiwal cows in a 2×3 factorial design were individually fed from the 3rd week of lactation for 14 weeks on diets of napier fodder harvested at 1·0 m or 1·5 m and offered ad libitum, supplemented with 0, 4 or 8 kg fresh weight leucaena fodder. Average daily milk yield during the 2nd week of lactation was a covariate in the analyses of milk yield, and post-partum live weight a covariate in the analyses of dry matter (DM) intake and live-weight change. Napier harvesting height and leucaena level had independent effects on performance. Napier height (1·0 m or 1·5 m) significantly (P < 0·01) affected daily napier DM intake (9·3 and 6·8 kg), total daily DM intake (10·5 and 7·9 kg), daily live-weight losses (165 and 490 g) and daily milk yield (8·6 and 6·9 kg respectively). Leucaena supplementation (0, 4 or 8 kg) significantly (P<0·01) increased total daily DM intake (7·8, 9·3 and 10·4 kg), reduced daily live-weight loss (560,235 and 175 g), and increased daily milk yield (7·3, 7·7 and 8·3 kg respectively). The results show that reasonable dairy performance can be achieved in the tropics by supplementing a napier fodder basal diet with leucaena forage, and highlight the importance of the stage of harvesting of the napier fodder. The results are discussed in relation to the nutrient requirements for milk production given by the Agricultural Research Council (1980 and 1984). © 1992, British Society of Animal Science.

AB  - Soil erosion, a serious problem in Submontane Punjab, India, has been intensively studied by a number of investigators. Various soil management practices, such as the use of diverse crops, strip cropping, increasing crop cover, multiple cropping, agroforestry, mulching, conservation tillage, ridging, and furrowing have decreased erosion. Maize at a spacing of 60 cm x 22.5 cm showed minimum soil loss by runoff. Crops with erect growth and limited tilling allowed for high runoff and soil loss. The intercropping of groundnut with maize gave the highest net return with the least amount of soil loss by erosion; maize with urd fVigna mungo L.) gave the second highest net return with the least amount of soil loss by erosion. Maize and guar fCyamopsis tetragonoloba L.) in alternating strips of9-m width showed minimal runoff (9%) and soil loss (3.3 Mg ha-1). The agroforestry practice of growing Leucaena leucocephala Lam. intercropped with maize, guar, or urd also was effective in reducing runoff and soil loss; the yield was reduced for maize by 34%, urd by 27%, and guar by 21% as compared to pure crop but compensated by a relatively higher yield of fodder and fuel from L. leucocephala. The application of 4 Mg ha-1 of mulch decreased runoff by 57.6%, soil loss by 71.7%, and nutrient loss by 60% and increased the yield of maize. Deep tillage increased infiltration and decreased run-off and soil loss. A combination of mulch and tillage further reduced soil losses. Contour cultivation reduced soil loss from 6.3 Mg ha1 to 2.9 Mg ha-1 as compared to slope cultivation. Ridging and furrowing at sowing was most effective in controlling soil loss (0.3 Mg ha-1); ridging and furrowing 30 days after sowing was the second most effective way to control soil loss (1.6 Mg soil loss ha-1). On sloping lands contour bunding (embankments) decreased soil loss from 2.56 Mg ha-1 to 0.59 Mg ha-1 and increased wheat yields above 20%. Bench terracing proved to be more suitable for land with slopes between 6-33%. Structures such as waterways, drop structures, and control dams reduced sheet, rill, and gully erosion from 80%, 11%, and 3.6% to 15%, 2%, and nil, respectively. The goal of control practices has been to mitigate erosive capacity of rainfall by integrated management of crop, soil, and runoff and thus to decrease the soil and nutrient loss from arable soils to tolerable limits. © 1993 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Laboratory measurements of the functional response of adult Curinus coeruleus (Mulsant) to nymphs of Heteropsylla cubana Crawford on filter paper and on leaves of different host plants showed a significant effect of these different substrates on nymph consumption at several different densities. Moreover, this effect may be explained by the influence of the substrate on the search rate of the predator. Host plants tested included Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Witt, L. diversifolia (Schlecht.) Benth. and L. pallida Britton and Rose. Results obtained may be relevant to plant-protection research programs involving the integration of biological control with host-plant resistance. © 1992 Lavoisier Abonnements.

AB  - A study was carried out to identify Leucaena accessions best adapted to a semi-humid lowland tropical environment of East Africa. Six Leucaena leucocephala accessions and five Leucaena species were evaluated for growth and biomass production in comparison with L. leucocephala K28, a cultivar widely distributed locally. None of the accessions performed significantly better than cultivar K28 for growth and biomass production and, therefore, it remains currently the recommended cultivar. Of the five Leucaena species, L. leucocephala had the best performance followed by L. diversifolia. -from Authors

AB  - By coupling a short-rotation, intensive-culture (SRIC) biomass production model with a geographical information system and database, potential biomass supply (dry Mg) and delivered cost ($(dry Mg)-1) of three promising tropical hardwoods, Eucalyptus grandis, E. saligna, and Leucaena leucocephala, were estimated at all locations identified as potentially available for tree plantations on the island of Maui. Analyses were performed at two scales-island-wide (105 ha order of magnitude) for general land-use planning, and specific-site (102 ha order of magnitude) for field-level recommendations. The results are presented as yield and delivered cost maps and biomass supply curves for the entire island, and as management strategies depicted graphically as functions of growing space and rotation age that provide least-cost biomass feedstocks delivered from two specific field sites to a designated bioconversion facility on Maui. The methodology is a cost- and time-efficient means to provide useful information to land owners and other decision makers contemplating SRIC forestry as an alternative land use. © 1994.

AB  - Theee trials to evaluat the potential of alley cropping in maize production on the low fertility, acidic soils in Northern Zambia are described. Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Sesbania sesban, Albizia falcataria, Fleminga congesta, and Cassia spectabilis, were grown in alley crops with hybrid maize and soybean. All trials received recommended rates of P and K fertiliser; N fertiliser was applied at three rates as a subplot treatment. One trial received lime before establishment. Only in the limed trial was there a significant improvement in maize yields through alley cropping; when no N fertiliser was applied, incorporation of Leucaena leucocephala prunings resulted in an increase of up to 95% in yields, with a smaller improvement being produced by Flemingia congesta. There was a significant correlation between the quantity of prunings biomass applied and the proportional increase in maize yields over the control treatment. It is suggested that the lack of effect of most of the tree species on crop yields was due to low biomass production. An economic analysis showed that alley cropping with limed Leucaena was only profitable when fertiliser costs were high in relation to maize prices. However, lime is both expensive and difficult to obtain and transport for most small scale farmers in the region, and is therefore not a practical recommendation. It is suggested that future alley cropping research should focus on screening a wider range of tree species, including other species of Leucaena, for acid tolerance and higher biomass production. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - In order to obtain data which will facilitate the scientific development of multiple intercropping of trees in agroforestry systems, the effects of Faidherbia albida Del. or Ziziphus spina-christi L. Desf. on soil quality and on yield of interplanted Leucaena leucocephala L. were investigated. The distance to which both Faidherbia albida and Ziziphus spinachristi trees improved soil quality as well as Leucaena leucocephala and Sorghum vulgare L. production around them was about two times the radius of the tree crown. Higher yields of plants under Ziziphus spina-christi than Faidherbia albida were explained by similarly higher concentrations of available phosphorus (P). Other soil parameters, including total nitrogen (N), were similar under both species; being higher under the tree canopies than away from them. The study identified optimum tree spacing for agroforestry to be twice the tree crown radius. It also demonstrated the advantages of multiple tree mixtures over pure stands in improving soil quality and productivity. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Laboratory, digestion and lactation trials investigated the replacement value of the tree legumes Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala for a concentrate supplement in kinggrass (Pennisetum purpureum) based diets. In the lactation trial, 15 does in mid-lactation were allocated to three dietary treatments in a 3 × 3 Latin square design with five square replications. In the digestion trial, six intact yearling male goats were assigned to the same treatments in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. Diets were based on kinggrass and supplemented with either a commercial concentrate feed, gliricidia or leucaena. In the control diet, 60% of the total dietary N was supplied by the concentrate. In the legume-supplemented diets, gliricidia or leucaena replaced approximately 50% of the N supplied by the concentrate. Dried banana fruit (Musa×paradisiaca) was used in the legume-supplemented diets to equal the energy content of the control diet. Diets contained approximately 2.2% N and 73% total digestible nutrients. Legumes were greater in total N concentration than kinggrass, with leucaena containing more N than gliricidia (P<0.05). Size and degradation rate of the potentially ruminally degradable N fraction were greatest for gliricidia and least for kinggrass, with values for leucaena being intermediate (P<0.05). In vitro organic matter (OM) digestion was greater (P<0.05) for the legumes than for kinggrass, but the extent of in vitro cell wall digestion was greater (P<0.05) for kinggrass than for the legumes. In vitro OM and cell wall digestion was greatest (P<0.05) for banana. In the digestion trial, apparent dietary OM and cell wall digestibilities were similar (P>0.10) across treatments. Fecal N production was greater (P<0.05) for legume-supplemented diets than the control, leading to lower (P<0.05) N digestibility for legume-supplemented diets. In the lactation trial, OM intake was greatest (P<0.01) for the control diet and least (P<0.01) for the gliricidia-supplemented diet, but milk production characteristics were similar (P>0.10) for all treatments. For iso-energetic diets, up to 50% of the concentrate N may be replaced by the tropical tree legumes gliricidia and leucaena without a reduction in milk production. © 1994.

AB  - The phosphorus (P) uptake and use efficiency in relation to N2 fixation and growth of three provenances of gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) two cultivars of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and one of L. diversifolia, all inoculated with Rhizobium, were determined at five levels of P application. Increasing the P application rate resulted in a 33% increase in dry matter and total N of L. diversifolia and an 18% dry matter increase of gliricidia provenance 13/84 over the control without P. Leucaena K8, which did not respond to P application, yielded as well with low P as L. diversifolia at the high P indicating the lower P requirement of cultivar K8. Leucaena cultivar Singapore did not yield well at either low or high P. Correlation analyses showed that differences between species and cultivars/provenances for P uptake per plant were largely related to differences in shoot growth rate and the distribution of P between roots and tops. P use efficiency was not related to dry-matter production. Genetic control of P and dry matter distribution of is probably more important than P availability in the growth media for gliricidia and leucaena provenances or cultivars. Increasing the P application rate significantly increased the number and mass of nodules in leucaena cultivars and gliricidia provenances. Significant increases in the proportion of N derived from atmospheric N2 (% Ndfa) due to low P application (20 mg P kg-1 soil) were observed within leucaena but not for gliricidia provenances. No significant increases in % Ndfa occurred with higher P application rates suggesting that symbiotic N2 fixation per se is stimulated only with low rates of P. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A sensitive and selective spectrophotometric method for the estimation of the toxic factors mimosine and 3-hydroxy-4-(1H)-pyridone (DHP) has been developed based on the intense yellow-colored azodye formed with p-nitroaniline which showed a sharp absorption maximum at 400 nm. The method was optimized based on relative sensitivity of the reaction with various aromatic primary amino compounds and under different conditions of pH. Interference from a variety of structurally related compounds and phenols was tested and found insensitive to this method. The molar extinction coefficient at 400 nm for the azodye formed with mimosine was 5.31 × 104 M-1 cm-1 and that for DHP was 1.699 × 104 M-1 cm-1. The applicability of the method was tested using different plant extracts and recovery was found to be at 100 ± 0.3%. The method is suitable for accurate estimation of both mimosine and DHP after paper chromatographic separation of extracts of different biological samples. © 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effect of supplementation of leaves from fodder trees such as Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania grandiflora and Gliricidia maculata on dry matter (DM) intake and nutrient digestibility of hybrid napier grass (1.14% nitrogen) based rations was evaluated in two experiments with native Nellore Brown sheep. In Experiment 1, sheep received four dietary treatments, hybrid napier grass (NB-21) ad libitum (control) or grass plus 600 g day-1 of one of the three fodder tree leaves to have a grass:tree leaf ratio of 60:40 on DM basis. Supplementation with leucaena, sesbania and gliricidia decreased the total DM intake (g DM day-1) of the ration from 414 (control) to 392, 351 and 387, respectively. However, the effect of supplementation on DM intake was not significant (P > 0.05). Crude protein digestibility was significantly (P < 0.05) improved in all supplementation treatments. Sheep in all the four treatments were in positive N, Ca and P balance. Rumen degradability of fodder tree leaves was studied using the nylon bag technique in association with the fermentation characteristics of sheep fed rations containing different tree leaves in Experiment 2. Sesbania leaf was highly degradable in the rumen with 73% of the DM disappearing after 24 h incubation. In contrast, leucaena and gliricidia leaves exhibited a low degradability of 64.5% and 72.7%, respectively, after 48 h in the rumen. Effective degradation of DM was highest with sesbania (64.2%), intermediate with gliricidia (55.9%) and least with leucaena (41.6%). The relative ability of the fodder tree leaves to improve the total tract digestion of NB-21 grass is discussed, particularly in relation to rumen degradability of DM. © 1993.

AB  - The effect of the non-systemic fungicide thiram on the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) symbiosis and on Leucaena leucocephala was evaluated in a greenhouse experiment. In the uninoculated soil treated with P at a level optimal for mycorrhizal activity, mycorrhizal colonization of roots was low, and did not change as the concentration of thiram in the soil increased with the from 0 to 1000 mg/kg. When this soil was inoculated VAM fungus Glomus aggregatum, with VAM colonization was enhanced significantly, but decreased increase in thiram concentration until it coincided with the level observed in the uninoculated soil. Similarly, symbiotic effectiveness was reduced, its expression delayed or completely eliminated with increase in the concentration of thiram. Amending soil to a P level sufficient for non-mycorrhizal host growth fully compensated for thiram-induced loss of VAM activity if the thiram levels did not exceed 125 mg/kg. In soil treated with 50 mg thiram/kg, the toxicity of the fungicide dissipated within 66 days of application. At higher concentrations, the toxicity of the chemical on the mycorrhizal symbiosis appeared to be enhanced. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, a tree used for social forestry, has been intensively cultivated in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and India. Several years ago psyllid Heteropsylla cubana infestations began (Anonymous, 1989). This has led to serious searching for alternative major tree(s) in social forestry programmes. It would be more practical and economical to control H. cubana if possible. Since conventional synthetic insecticides are unsuitable in this case (due to cost as well as factors such as use of tree products such as leaves as fodder by local communities) we report management alternatives for H. cubana on L. leucocephala. © 1992, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

AB  - In an alley cropping system, prunings from the hedgerow legume are expected to supply nitrogen (N) to the associated cereal. However, this may not be sufficient to achieve maximum crop yield. Three field experiments with alley-cropped maize were conducted in a semi-arid environment in northern Australia to determine: (1) the effect of N fertilizer on maize growth in the presence of fresh leucaena prunings; (2) the effect of incorporation of leucaena and maize residues on maize yield and the fate of plant residue15N in the alley cropping system; and (3) the15N recovery by maize from15N-labelled leucaena, maize residues and ammonium sulphate fertilizer. Leucaena residues increased maize crop yield and N uptake although they did not entirely satisfy the N requirement of the alley crop. Additional N fertilizer further increased the maize yield and N uptake in the presence of leucaena residues. Placement of leucaena residues had little effect on the availability of N to maize plants over a 2 month period. The incorporation of leucaena residues in the soil did not increase the recovery of leucaena15N by maize compared with placement of the residues on the soil surface. After 2 months, similar proportions of the residue15N were recovered by maize from mulched leucaena (6.3%), incorporated leucaena (6.1%) and incorporated maize (7.6%). By the end of one cropping season (3 months after application) about 9% of the added15N was taken up by maize from either15N-labelled leucaena as mulch or15N-labelled maize residues applied together with unlabelled fresh leucaena prunings as mulch. The recovery of the added15N was much higher (42.7%) from the15N-labelled ammonium sulphate fertilizer at 40 kg N ha-1 in the presence of unlabelled leucaena prunings. Most of the added15N recovered in the 200 cm soil profile was distributed in the top 25 cm soil with little leached below that. About 27-41% of the leucaena15N was apparently lost, largely through denitrification from the soil and plant system, in one cropping season. This compared with 35% of the fertilizer15N lost when the N fertilizer was applied in the presence of prunings. ei]H Lambers © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Field microplot experiments were conducted in the semi-arid tropics of northern Australia to evaluate the response of maize (Zea mays L.) growth to addition of N fertilizer and plant residues and to examine the fate of fertilizer15N in a leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) alley cropping system, in which supplemental irrigation was used. Leucaena prunings, maize residues and N fertilizer were applied to alley-cropped maize grown in microplots which were installed in the alleys formed by leucaena hedgerows spaced 4.5 metres apart. The15N-labelled fertilizer was used to examine the fate of fertilizer N applied in the presence of mulched leucaena prunings and maize residues. Application of leucaena prunings increased maize yield while addition of N fertilizer in the presence of the prunings produced a further increase in maize production. There was a significant positive interaction between N fertilizer and leucaena prunings in increasing maize production. The addition of maize residues in the presence of N fertilizer and leucaena prunings decreased maize yield and N uptake and increased fertilizer15N loss from 38% to 47%. Maize recovered 24-79% of fertilizer15N in one cropping season, depending on application rate of N fertilizer and field management of plant residues. About 20-34% of fertilizer15N remained in the soil. More than 37% of fertilizer15N was apparently lost from the soil and plant system largely through denitrification when N fertilizer was applied at 40 kg N ha-1 or more in the presence or absence of plant residues. Application of N fertilizer improved maize yield and increased the contribution of mulched leucaena prunings to crop production in the alley cropping system. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The evolution of mineral and hydrosoluble organic N released from two soils differing in pH and treated with leaves of Leucaena leucocephala (0, 8.3, 16.7, and 33. g kg-1 soil), Dactyladenia barteri (syn. Acioa barteri; 0 and 16.7 g), and their mixtures was studied in the laboratory using the aerobic incubation-leaching method. N mineralization in untreated soils and in soils supplemented with 8.3 g leucaena leaves was 41-53% higher in the soil from Onne (pH 4.7) than in the soil from Ibadan (pH 6.2), but the organic N content was similar with these treatments in the leachates of the soils from both locations. The application of 16.7 or 33.3 g of either or both type of leaves reduced the rate of mineral N production during the first 4 weeks, particularly in soils treated with dactyladenia leaves (C:N=36). After this lag period, N mineralization proceeded at a faster rate in the soil from Ibadan treated with 16.7 or 33.3 g of leucaena leaves (C:N=12), even in the presence of dactyladenia leaves. In Ibadan soil, after 12 weeks, mineral N apprently derived from leaves of both dactyladenia and leucaena averaged 6.3% of the N applied, and organic N from leaves averaged 9.5%. The addition of dactyladenia and leucaena leaves did not increases the mineral N content in the acid soil from Onne but leaching of soluble organic N with addition of 16.7 or 33.3 g of leaves contributed an N-mineralizable pool of 5.9% of the N applied. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In a 3-year field study, the effects of substitution of nitrogen requirement of maize through Leucaena leaves were studied on runoff, soil loss, maize and wheat yield and economic returns. The treatments were (1) 80 kg N ha-;1 all through Leucaena leaves (80 L), (2) 40 kg N through Leucaena leaves + 40 kg N ha-;1 through fertilizer (40 L + 40 F), (3) 20 kg N through Leucaena leaves + 60 kg N ha-;1 through fertilizer (20 L + 60 F), (4) 80 kg N ha-;1 all through fertilizer (80 F), and (5) control (No fertilizer). Green Leucaena leaf biomass (containing 3.3% N on dry basis) was incorporated every year in 15 cm top soil two weeks before sowing of summer maize. Other treatments being almost equal, runoff was reduced marginally in treatment 20 L + 60 F which was attributed to better crop growth in this treatment. Mean minimum soil loss (6.202 t ha-;1) also occurred in treatment 20 L + 60 F. Soil loss in 80 L was 13% less than in 80 F. Maize yield was at par in 80 L and 80 F. However, mean maximum yield of maize was obtained with 20 L + 60 F. Residual effect of incorporation of Leucaena leaves to maize crop was observed on wheat yield. The mean yield differences were statistically at par in all the treatments except control. The total mean net returns were statistically at par in 80 L and 80 F. However, significantly higher mean net returns (Rs 6811 ha-;1; one US$ = Rs30) were obtained with 20 L + 60 F. Substitution of N through Leucaena leaves even in small quantity may be helpful to small holders, particularly where chemical fertilizers are in short supply or too expensive. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The growth of the tree legumes Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Sesbania sesban, Sesbania grandifiora, Albizia falcataria and Calliandra calothyrsus was evaluated at four sites in Indonesia between 1984 and 1986. Tree seedlings were planted at 10000 trees/ha and, after an establishment period of 9–12 months, harvested every 3 months for a 2-year period. At Bambu Apus, West Java (2040 mm annual rainfall, 1 month dry period, lowland, latosol with pH 5.6 decreasing with depth), G. sepium and C. calothyrsus produced 13 and 10 t/ha per year of leaf dry matter, respectively. Other species did not grow well at this site and fewer than 60% of the trees of these species survived until the end of the experimental period. At Sei Putih, North Sumatra (1550 mm annual rainfall, 3 months dry period, lowland, podzolic with pH 5.5 increasing with depth), no species produced 6 t/ha per year of leaf dry matter. The highest yielding species were L. leucocephala and A. falcataria. At Cisarua, West Java (3340 mm annual rainfall, no dry periods, 925 m altitude, latosol with pH 5.6 increasing with depth) only C. calothyrsus grew well and produced 9 t/ha per year of leaf dry matter. At Grati, East Java (1500 mm annual rainfall, 6 months dry period, lowland, alluvial with pH 6.6 increasing with depth) L. leucocephala produced 8 t/ha per year of leaf dry matter, while none of the C. calothyrsus and A. falcataria trees survived the first dry season. Although L. leucocephala has been the most widely grown tree legume species in the tropics, C. calothyrsus and G. sepium performed better at the wetter sites and at high altitude. © 1993, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - A crop/hedgerow interface design was used to test three leguminous species, Inga edulis, Leucaena leucocephala and Erythrina sp., for their potential use for alley cropping on alluvial soils in the upper Amazon Basin. Prunings were applied as mulch at three rates 0, 3.3 and 6.7 Mg dry matter/ha/crop. Competition, crop yields, nutrient budgets, and weed control were monitored for three consecutive crops of upland rice. Crop yield reductions were evident up to 1.5 m from each of the hedgerow species, but were more pronounced with Leucaena hedgerows. Additional mulch was able to compensate for these reduced yields close to the hedges in Leucaena leucocephala and Erythrina but not in Inga edulis systems. In general rice yields were higher with Leucaena leucocephala and Erythrina mulch as compared to Inga mulch, perhaps because of higher levels of available N provided by the rapidly decomposing leaves of Leucaena leucocephala and Erythrina sp. as compared to Inga. Weed control was greater, however, with the slowly decomposing Inga mulch. For all three hedgerow/crop systems there was a net export of P from the system which was exhibited by declining soil P levels and decreasing crop yields. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Fast growing, multi-purpose exotic trees are being introduced at a very rapid pace to meet an ever increasing demand for fuelwood and fodder. The possible interaction between the exotic species and the already existing naturalised species or natives needs to be quantified before the establishment of massive plantations takes place. This set of mixture trials involved evaluation of intra- and interspecific competition between and within fast growing Leucaena leucocephala (exotic) with the relatively slow growing Acacia nilotica (indigenous). An even aged mixed plantation in a hexagonal arrangement with varying proportions of the two species around an indicator or test tree was raised. Periodical observations revealed the quantitative changes in tree growth brought about by the serial manipulation of the neighbours of the indicator tree. In all the combinations, Leucaena exhibited profuse height growth, steady diameter increase, dense canopy and a high wood volume. Acacia, with a slow height growth, lesser diameter increase and bushy habit, exhibited suppressed growth, this effect increasing in combinations with an increased number of Leucaena. Such an intensively competitive combination of a fast growing exotic with a slow growing native would enhance the biomass production potential of the area but may eventually result in the elimination of the native trees. This warrants immediate attention, thoughtful selection and careful planning of exotics for large-scale introduction in afforestation programmes. © 1993.

AB  - Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 induced chlorosis in the leaves of its symbiotic hosts, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum Urb.), and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Chlorosis induction by strains CIAT899 and CT9005, an exopolysaccharide-deficient mutant of CIAT899, required carbon substrate. When the bacteria were added at planting in a solution of mannitol (50 g/liter), as few as 103 cells of CIAT899 were sufficient to induce chlorosis in bean plants. All carbon sources tested, including organic acids and mono- and disaccharides, supported chlorosis induction. The addition of a carbon source did not affect the growth rate or the population density of CT9005 in the bean plant rhizosphere. Cell-free filtrates of cultures of CT9005 did not induce detectable chlorosis. All type B strains of R. tropici tested also induced chlorosis in common bean. Type A strains of R. tropici and all other species of bacteria tested did not induce chlorosis. Several lines of evidence indicated that nodulation was not required for chlorosis induction. Strain RSP900, a pSym-cured derivative of CIAT899, induced chlorosis in wild-type P. vulgaris. In addition, NOD125, a nodulation-defective line of common bean, developed chlorosis when inoculated with CIAT899, but did not develop nodules. CIAT899 consistently induced severe chlorosis in the leaves of the nonhost legumes alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and Berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), and induced chlorosis in 29 to 58% of the plants tested of sunflower, cucumber, and tomato seedlings, but it did not induce chlorosis in the leaves of corn or wheat. Chlorosis induction in nonhost plants also required carbon substrate. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that R. tropici type B strains produce a chlorosis-inducing factor that affects a wide range of plant species.

AB  - By Tn5 mutagenesis of Rhizobium loti PN184 (NZP2037 str-1) and selection for nonfluorescence of colonies on Calcofluor agar, eight independently generated exopolysaccharide (EPS) mutants (three smooth and five rough) were isolated. The parent strain, PN184, was found to produce an acidic EPS. This EPS was produced, with reduced O acetylation, by the smooth EPS mutants but not by the rough EPS mutants. Lipopolysaccharide was isolated from all mutants and was identical to that of PN184 as defined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All mutants were resistant to lysis by B. loti bacteriophage Φ2037/1. Cosmids that complemented the mutations in the rough EPS mutants were isolated from a pLAFR1 gene library of NZP2037 by complementation of the nonfluorescent phenotype. The genes identified were shown to be unlinked and located on the chromosome. All mutants were fully effective when inoculated onto Lotus pedunculatus, a determinate nodulating host, but were ineffective, inducing the formation of very small nodules or tumorlike growths, when inoculated onto Leucaena leucocephala, an indeterminate nodulating host. These results, obtained in an isogenic Rhizobium background, support suggestions that acidic EPS is required for effective nodulation of indeterminate nodulating legumes but is not required for effective nodulation of determinate nodulating legumes.

Phosphorus uptake was evaluated by determining the amount of phosphorus in plant tissue. Results indicated that Prosopis juliflora had a greater uptake than Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala under these conditions. Intercropping the tree species with millet had no significant effect on phosphorus uptake by millet compared with a millet monoculture. © 1991 A B Academic Publisher.

AB  - This study examines the effects of traditional sedentary grazing on soils in the southern guinea savanna ecosystem in Nigeria. The characteristics of soil in grazed plots are compared with those of similar soil in ungrazed plots in a savanna 'forest' reserve in a nearby locality, in order to infer the effects of grazing. In the 0-10 cm layer of the soil, organic carbon, total nitrogen, exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, cation exchange capacity and available phosphorus levels are significantly lower in the grazed plots. Decline in the organic carbon and nutrient levels of the grazed plots is mainly due to soil exposure resulting from grazing and savanna burning and the attendant processes of accelerated organic matter decomposition and nutrient loss through leaching and erosion. Low soil nutrient levels in the grazed plots will reduce primary production and hence the rate of herbage production for livestock. It could also lead to some adverse ecological changes in the ecosystem with the disappearance of certain plant species. The ecosystem consequently becomes less diverse and resilient as soil nutrient status becomes increasingly impoverished. It is suggested that herdsmen should practise rotational grazing and that livestock should be fed with a supplementary fodder of legumes, such as Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala planted in natural grazing areas, in order to minimise the problems of overgrazing which are frequently experienced during the dry season. © 1991 Science and Technology Letters.

AB  - Eight crossbred goat bucklings with a mean birth weight of 3.5 kg were used in Kenya to ascertain potential toxicity of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). Four bucklings were randomly allocated to each of two feeding treatments: fresh leucaena only, and pasture (control). This trial was based on the hypothesis that goats exposed to no other forage than leucaena from birth will develop mimosineor DHP (3-hydroxy-4-1 (H)-pyridone)-degrading microbes. However, the hypothesis was not proven because goats on leucaena, unlike the controls, exhibited leucaena toxicity signs and their urine was positive for the mimosine metabolite. © 1990.

AB  - The leaf mulch of the tree legumes Acacia cunninghamii, A. fimbriata, Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania sesban was evaluated as a source of nitrogen for maize growth in glasshouse pot experiments. The mulch of Sesbania sesban resulted in the largest yields of maize stover but yields were less than those that resulted from application of equivalent rates of fertilizer nitrogen. The mulches of Gliricidia and Leucaena also produced a yield response in maize but those of Calliandra and the two Acacia species were ineffective as sources of nitrogen in the short term. Sesbania mulch at the equivalent of 5 t dry matter ha-1 produced a maize yield similar to that obtained with 75 kg N ha-1. The poor response to Calliandra and Acacia mulch may be associated with the high polyphenol and/or lignin content of the leaf of these species. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Potential productivity and financial returns from selected agroforestry systems and traditional monocrops located in the Phu Wiang watershed were estimated from limited trials of cropping alternatives using cost-benefit analysis. The agroforestry systems studied consisted of combinations of Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), or Acacia (Acacia auriculiformis) inter-cropped with cassava (Manihot esculenta) or mungbean (Vigna radiata). Evidence from trials at short, 3-year rotations, demonstrate that early supplementary and complementary relationships between some system components can imply synergistic financial gains. Although these biological interactions turn competitive over time, in this case, the gains should be sufficient to make early adopters consider the agroforestry systems financially preferable to traditional monocrops. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A study was conducted at the National Agricultural Research Center (NARC) of Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) by planting trees of four different species: Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Albizia procera, Morus alba and Leucaena leucocephala along the boundary of wheat fields in a randomized complete block design. Data on crop yield for each tree species and control (no trees) at different distances viz 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 meter (m) from the tree bases and control were collected and analyzed. The statistical analysis did not show any significant difference in the wheat yield among different tree species. However, the wheat yield was numerically lowest at 2 m distance in case of all the four tree species and control. In case of mulberry, it was lowest statistically also from other distances. Numerically higher wheat yield values were noted at later distances (8, 10 and 12 m) in case of all tree species including control except for siris where numerically highest value was found at 6 m distance. Therefore, it can be generalized that tree's impact on wheat yield can be experienced up to 2 m distance, there is little, if any, impact up to 6 m distance and almost no impact at 8, 10 and 12 m distances. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - We studied the effect of three successive cuttings on N uptake and fixation and N distribution in Leucaena leucocephala. Two isolines, uninoculated or inoculated with three different Rhizobium strains, were grown for 36 weeks and cut every 12 weeks. The soil was labelled with 50 ppm KNO3 enriched with 10 atom % 15N excess soon after the first cutting. Except for the atom % 15N excess in branches of K28 at the second cutting, both the L. leucocephala isolines showed similar patterns of total N, fixed N2, and N from fertilizer distribution in different parts of the plant at each cutting. The Rhizobium strain did not influence the partitioning of 15N among the different plant parts. Significant differences in 15N enrichment occurred in different parts. Live nodules of both isolines showed the lowest atom % 15N excess values (0.087), followed by leaves (0.492), branches (0.552), stems (0.591), and roots (0.857). The roots contained about 60% of the total plant N and about 70% of the total N derived from fertilizer over the successive cuttings. The total N2 fixed in the roots was about 60% of that fixed in the whole plant, while the shoots contained only 20% of the fixed N2. We conclude that N reserves in roots and nodules constitute another N source that must be taken into account when estimating fixed N2 or the N balance after pruning or cutting plants. 15N enrichment declined up to about fivefold in the reference and the N2-fixing plants over 24 weeks following the 15N application. The proportion and the amounts of N derived from fertilizer decreased, while the amount derived from N2 fixation increased with time although its proportion remained constant. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Leaves of Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania sesban and Calliandra callothyrsus were harvested in Rwanda from young shoots at 8 weeks after the first cutting. They were dried, ground and incubated at the same time in polyester bags in three non-lactating Holstein-Friesian cows each fitted with a ruminal cannula. The bags were removed at 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 144 h after the start of incubations. The different parameters characterizing extent and rate of ruminal degradation of organic matter (OM), neutral-detergent fibre (NDF), and crude protein (CP) were calculated. In vitro digestibility of residual protein after 24 h and 48 h incubation was also determined. Sesbania sesban had lowest cell wall contents and gave highest ruminal degradability for OM, NDF and CP. Leucaena leucocephala was degraded to a lesser extent, but its undegraded protein had a somewhat higher in vitro digestibility. In contrast, protein of Calliandra callothyrsus was poorly degraded and digested. The proportion and composition of cell wall could not explain these differences in digestion characteristics and other measurements, such as tannins, were incriminated. Increased ruminal incubation time augmented the extent of ruminal degradation and reduced in vitro digestibility of undegraded protein but did not affect the undigestible protein fraction. © 1992, British Society of Animal Science.

AB  - Rhizobium species strain NGR234 nodulates at least 35 diverse genera of legumes as well as the nonlegume Parasponia andersonii. Most nodulation genes are located on the 500-kilobase pair symbiotic plasmid, pNGR234a. Previously, three plasmid-borne host range determinants (Hsnl, HsnII, and HsnIII) were identified by their ability to extend the nodulation capacity of heterologous rhizobia to include Vigna unguiculata. In this study, we show that HsnII contains two new nod-box linked hsn genes, nodS and nodU. nodS controls nodulation of the tropical tree Leucaena leucocephala, while the nodSU genes regulate nodulation of the pasture legume Desmodium intortum and the grain legume V. unguiculata. Regulation of the nod-box upstream of nodSU by the flavonoid naringenin was shown using a fusion with a pro-moterless lacZ gene. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the nodS gene did not reveal homology with any gene in the EMBL library, although Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110 contains both nodS and nodU (M. Gottfert, S. Hitz, and H. Hennecke, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions 3:308-316, 1990). We suggest that broad host range in NGR234 is controlled in part by a nodD gene which interacts with a wide range of flavonoids, and in part by host-specific nod genes such as nodS. © 1990 The American Phytopathological Society.

AB  - Analytical data, including 13 C-NMR spectra, are presented for the gums from five Central American Leucaena species. In addition, for comparative purposes, 13C-NMR spectra are given for two gum samples for which some analytical data were reported previously, viz. an Indian sample from Leucaena leucocephala and a Hawaiian sample from L. esculenta x leucocephala. The new analytical data confirm that Leucaena gums have negative specific rotations and compositions that are remarkably similar to that of gum arabic (Acacia Senegal), but the NMR spectroscopic evidence now available reveals that the Leucaena gums differ to a considerable extent structurally from gum arabic. The Leucaena gums can nevertheless be expected to have technological applications particularly in those countries with extensive Leucaena afforestations, but they are not permitted for foodstuff use by any of the international regulatory authorities. In this connection, it is of interest that even the recently revised, more detailed, international specification for gum arabic remains inadequate to differentiate between it and the gum from Leucaena leucocephala. © 1992 A B Academic Publisher.

AB  - The effect of various shade treatments on growth and tuber yield of potato was evaluated at the Agricultural Research Station, Kalpitiya (8°N, 0-5 m a.s.l.) during five Maha (October-March) seasons. Shading experiments consisted of: (a) use of live perennial shade of Ipil Ipil (Leucaena leucocephala); (b) relay cropping with maize and soybeans; and (c) use of artificial and live shade at different growth stages of potato. Ipil Ipil, planted in avenues of 1-m and 2-m width, increased the tuber yield per plant in the first two seasons by 20%, when fully shading the potato crop for one month after planting and two weeks before harvest. In the two successive seasons, yield per plant was reduced in shaded treatments compared to the yield of unshaded controls, although the number of tubers per plant remained the same. This suggests that, as Ipil Ipil matures, competition with potato increases in successive seasons, especially at closer avenue spacings. Avenues 3 m wide, introduced in the last season, improved tuber yield per plant compared to 1-m and 2-m avenues of the same age. In relay-cropping combinations using maize or beans (soybean or polebean) as companion crops, shading during the first four weeks improved tuber yield by 20% whereas shading for up to 6 or 8 weeks after planting the potato reduced the potato yields by 25 and 35%, respectively. Artificial shade (suspended coconut leaves intercepting 50% of the incoming irradiance) during the first four weeks after planting potato, improved total tuber yield by 15% and 20% respectively over live shade (Ipil Ipil or Crotalaria sp.) or unshaded potato yields. However, shading throughout the potato crop, either with live or artificial shade, reduced tuber yield significantly compared to sole potato yields. The benefits of late-season shading were variable, and apparently dependent upon the degree of shading experienced by the potato plants. © 1990.

AB  - The potential of hedgerow intecrropping with Leucaena leucocephala was explored on vertic Inceptisols over 4 years at ICRISAT Center, Patancheru, India. The study was conducted using a systematic layout involving different alley widths ranging from 1.35 to 4.95 m and with varying distances between hedge and crops. The alleys were cropped with alternate rows of sorghum and pigeonpea. Hedges composed double Leucaena hedgerows 60 cm apart were periodically harvested for fodder. Sole crops of all components and a sorghum/pigeonpea intercrop were included in all four replications of the study. Starting in the second year, Leucaena was progressively more competitive to annual crops, causing substantial yield reduction. Competition (primarily for moisture) was most severe in narrow alleys and was greatest on pigeonpea. The growth of Leucaena was not sufficient to compensate for reduced crop yields. Land equivalent ratios (LERs) calculated on the basis of grain yield of crops and Leucaena fodder yields showed that hedgerow intercropping (HI) was advantageous over sole crops only during the first two years using wide alleys, but disadvantegeous in the last two years. LERs calculated on the basis of total dry matter indicated only a small advantage for HI (13-17 percent) over sole crops in wider (>4 m) alleys. Average returns per year from HI exceeded those of the most productive annual crop system (sorghum/pigeonpea intercropping) by 8 percent in 4.05 m alleys, and by 16 percent in 4.95 m alleys. Fodder production during the dry season was 40 percent of the annual total in these alley widths. Thus hedgerow intercropping at 4-5 m alley width is not very attractive for farmers in semi-arid India, which has 600-700 mm of annual rainfall. There is a need to examine the potential of HI in wider alleys. The merits and limitations of the systematic design are discussed. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The effect of alley cropping with seven combinations of Acioa and Leucaena hedgerows and a control (no hedgerow) treatment on sequentially cropped maize and cowpea was studied in 1985 and 1986. The trial was carried out on an Alfisol in the humid zone of southwestern Nigeria. Hedgerows were established in 1983, using 4 m inter-hedgerow spacing and pruned to 25 cm height during cropping. Highest dry matter, wood, and nutrient yields of prunings of Acioa and Leucaena hedgerows were obtained with sole cropping. Growing Leucaena and Acioa in the same hedgerow suppressed dry matter production and nutrient yield of Acioa more than of Leucaena owing to the latter's faster growth. Total pruning dry matter yield was reduced as the proportion of Acioa increased in the combination. Leucaena prunings had higher nutrient yield than Acioa. Under 22-month old uncut hedgerows, weed biomass declined in the presence of Leucaena, either alone or in combination with Acioa. Weed weight under sole Leucaena hedgerows was about a third of that in the control plot. There was no significant effect of alley cropping on weed biomass, although alley cropping with Acioa and Leucaena hedgerows resulted in the dominance of broadleaf weeds while the control had a mixture of broadleaves and grasses. Alley cropping with various combinations of Acioa and Leucaena hedgerows increased maize and cowpea yields compared to control. Nitrogen application in both years increased maize grain yield. Mean yield increase due to N application in both years was highest in the control (47.2%) followed by the sole Acioa hedgerow (25.2%) and less in hedgerows with Leucaena. The results of observations over two years do not show any advantage for the tested Leucaena and Acioa combinations on maize and cowpea crops as compared to the sole hedgerows. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The interaction of the components of an agroforestry system with elements of microclimate is presented in terms of the interception by foliage of radiant energy and of rainfall; and of the temperature, humidity and windspeed of air surrounding the foliage. Most of the measurements reported are from a trial in which pearl millet was grown at ICRISAT, Hyderabad, between hedges of Leucaena leucocephala Lam. In terms of microclimate, the main advantage of the alley system was to intercept more light throughout the year and therefore to produce more biomass. Temperatureand humidity within the alleys differed little from values in the open but windspeed was substantially less. The main disadvantage of the system in terms of pearl millet production was therefore competition below ground rather than above. © 1991.

AB  - Four yearling male red deer (Cervus elaphus) and four yearling male sheep were fed tropical grass (Digitaria decumbens) hay supplemented with or without 30% dried leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) leaves. Voluntary feed intake (VFI), digestibility of dietary components, haematological parameters and serum thyroxine concentrations were determined. Leucaena supplementation reduced VFI of pangola grass by 8% but increased total DMI of both species by 30%. Digestibility of DM, OM and N was higher for both species when leucaena was fed but sheep digested these dietary components more efficiently than deer. Leucaena supplementation did not influence blood cell numbers or haemoglobin and thyroxine concentrations in either species. Deer had higher concentrations of red blood cells and lower concentrations of white blood cells than sheep. It was concluded that leucaena at 30% could be a suitable supplement for deer and sheep consuming sub-tropical pastures. © 1991.

The experimental design was a 2·2·2 factorial: ± mycorrhizal inoculation, ± application of phosphorus fertilizer and ± repeated drought treatment. The growth promoting effect of VAM fungi equalled the effect of phosphorus fertilization after 12 weeks. The drought treatment reduced seedling biomass and nodulation. Differences between the plant species were found with respect to growth improvements due to VAM inoculation and/or phosphorus fertilization under drought stress conditions.

AB  - Nitrogen, Ca and Mg release from leaves of ten selected plant residues with varying chemical compositions was studied under laboratory conditions. Three patterns of N-release were observed over a seven week incubation period: (a)Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Mucuna pruriens and Centrosema pubescens leaves showed rapid N release, (b)Acioa barteri and Dialium guineense leaves immobilized N, and (c)Alchornea cordifolia, Anthonata macrophylla, Cassia siamea and Pterocarpus santalinoides leaves initially showed N immobilization which gradually changes to net mineralization after about four weeks of incubation. Nitrogen mineralization rate constant (k) ranged from -0.0018 (A. barteri) to 0.0064 day-1 (G. sepium). Statistical analysis of data showed that N mineralization rate constants are significantly correlated with initial N, polyphenol and lignin contents of leaves. Nitrogen release increased with increasing N content and decreased with increasing contents of polyphenols and lignin. Addition of leaves from all species significantly increased soil exchangeable Ca and Mg levels. L. leucocephala, G. sepium, C. pubescens and M. pruriens showed relatively high Ca and Mg release rates. Calcium release rate was related to N release rate rather than to initial Ca content. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A long-term trial with Leucaena leucocephala was initiated in 1982 to test the sustainability of Leucaena-based alley farming compared to a conventional cropping system without trees and with continuous cultivation of maize. It assessed the integration of short grazed fallows in rotation within Leucaena alleys and their effect on soil fertility and crop yields. The various treatments had no effect on soil pH during the four-year period of the trial. The organic carbon and total nitrogen contents of the soils under conventional cropping were lower by the end of the fourth year than those under alley cropping and alley grazing treatments, whereas soil phosphorus levels were lower in the alley cropping and grazing plots. Foliage dry matter production of Leucaena under alley cropping management ranged from 6.0 to 6.7 t ha−1 a−1 under continuous cropping and reached 8 t ha−1 when alley cropping was preceded by a grazed fallow. Crop yields were consistently higher with alley cropping than with conventional cropping. Alley cropping plots in rotation with two year grazed fallows gave significantly higher crop yields during cropping years than those under continuous cultivation. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

Four cutting heights, (25, 50, 75 and 100 cm), and two cutting intervals (one and three months), were adopted. Dry matter yields were highest at the 75 and 100 cm cutting heights, especially at the longer, three-monthly, cutting interval. They were significantly reduced by more frequent cutting, probably due to the increased number of recovery phases. Leaf nitrogen yields per tree for trees cut at three-monthly intervals were over twice as high as the total yields obtained from monthly cutting over the same period. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Feeding of the shrimp, Penaeus monodon, with diets containing leaf meal of the leguminous shrub, Leucaena leucocephala, resulted in complete chromatin decondensation of hepatopancreas cells. The fibrillar component of the nucleolus was decondensed in parallel, whereas the granular component remained intact. This unique combination of nuclear signs was accompanied by only moderate alterations of other cell organelles. Our findings therefore demonstrate an encouraging possibility to manipulate the chromatin organization in living cells. Furthermore, ultrastructural features obtained thus far only in isolated and chromatin-depleted nuclei could be verified. These are, for instance, filament bundles which attach the nucleolus to the nuclear periphery, or a filamentous skeleton of the nuclear pores. In addition, the attachment of chromatin to the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope was observed. Decondensation was probably caused by the major Leucaena ingredient mimosine and is obviously related to its copper chelating properties. © 1991.

AB  - Chemical fertilizers are used only in a limited way under dry farming conditions in India because of their high cost and the risk of crop failures due to drought Several alternative strategies are being evaluated to reduce the cost of supplying N to castor bean without adversely affecting yield. We report the results of a two-year study on the possible replacement of fertilizer nitrogen by green leaves from Leucaena leucocephala for production of castor beans on a low fertility Alfisol Bean yield and dry matter production were significantly higher when 50 kg N/ha was applied as green leaves compared with 50 kg N/ha as urea. Among substitution levels, 37.5 kg N/ha as green leaves at planting followed by 12.5 kg N/ha as urea at 45 days after planting was found to be the most effective combination. Across all the substitution levels, addition of nitrogen as green leaves at planting was found to be better than application at 45 days after planting. Nutrient and water use efficiencies were higher when the N was applied as green leaves compared to urea. Nitrogen use efficiency was higher for green leaves than for urea under limited rainfall conditions. The overall data indicated that 75 percent of the fertilizer N requirement of castor bean can be supplied by leaves of Leucaena leucocephala when applied at planting. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Decomposition and nutrient release patterns of prunings of three woody agroforestry plant species (Acioa barteri, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala), maize (Zea mays) stover and rice (Oryza sativa) straw, were investigated under field conditions in the humid tropics, using litterbags of three mesh sizes (0.5, 2 and 7 mm) which allowed differential access of soil fauna. The decomposition rate constants ranged from 0.01 to 0.26 week-1, decreasing in the following order; Gliricidia prunings > Leucaena prunings > rice straw > maize stover > Acioa prunings. Negative correlations were observed between decomposition rate constants and C:N ratio (P < 0.004), percent lignin (P < 0.014) and polyphenol content (P < 0.053) of plant residues. A positive correlation was observed between decomposition rate constant and mesh-size of litterbag (P < 0.057). These results indicate that both the chemical composition of plant residues and nature of the decomposer played an important role in plant residue decomposition. Nutrient release differed with quality of plant residues and litterbag mesh-size. Total N, P, Ca and Mg contents of plant residues decreased with time for Gliricidia and Leucaena prunings, maize stover, and rice straw, and increased with time for Acioa prunings. There was some indication of N immobilization in maize stover and rice straw; P immobilization in Leucaena prunings and rice straw; and Ca immobilization in maize stover, rice straw and Gliricidia and Leucaena prunings. Acioa prunings immobilized N, P, Ca and Mg. All plant residues released K rapidly. Nutrient release increased with increasing mesh-size of litterbags, suggesting that soil faunal activities enhanced nutrient mobilization. © 1992.

TI  - Changes in nodule and root biomass of Sesbania sesban and Leucaena leucocephala following coppicing

AB  - A pot study was conducted to measure the extent of and determine the factors controlling fine root and nodule shedding following coppicing of Sesbania sesban and Leucaena leucocephala. Fine (<2 mm) root biomass decreased below pre-cutting values, but the decreases were not statistically significant in either species. Living (white) nodule biomass decreased and dead (brown) nodule biomass increased significantly two weeks after cutting in both species. These changes were relatively greater in Sesbania than in Leucaena. In the uncut treatments of both species, fine root and nodule biomass were correlated with leaf biomass, and in the cut treatments, root and nodule biomass returned to near this apparent equilibrium by two weeks after cutting. Stem growth rate per unit leaf area was not different between cut and uncut treatments, nor was it correlated with root:leaf ratios in either species. Leucaena allocated a greater fraction of its total biomass below-ground, and a greater fraction of its below-ground biomass to coarse (>2 mm) roots than Sesbania. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that relatively lower allocation to below-ground storage tissue is the cause for Sesbania's relatively greater sensitivity to cutting. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Observations on the growth performance, rooting behaviour and distribution of fine roots of five tree species viz., Bauhinia purpurea, Grewia optiva, Eucalyptus tereticornis, Leucaena leucocephala and Ougeinia oojeinensis (Family: Papilionaceae) are being presented here. Roots were exposed at the time of planting, 6 months, 16 months, and 28 months after planting. Total root weight and root volume were highest in Eucalyptus tereticornis and lowest in Bauhinia purpurea. Major part of the root system confined within 90-120 cm soil depth in case of Bauhinia purpurea, Grewia optiva and Leucaena leucocephala but Eucalyptus tereticornis and Ougeinia oojeinensis strike their roots to deeper depths. Bauhinia purpurea had its roots evenly distributed down to 120 cm. In general, the vertical distribution of fine roots (< 2 mm in diameter) of the five species indicate that more the depth, fewer the number of roots. The observations on soil binding capacity, indicated that Ougeinia oojeinensis had the maximum and Eucalyptus tereticornis had the minimum binding value. Due to leaf shading and other litter fall significant increase of nutrient components in soils under the tree canopies has been observed. The study indicates that bulk of the roots of the five tree species are found near the surface, but observation on soil moisture and nutrient content does not indicate variation under the tree canopies and in open, hence there may not be root competition in initial years of plantation. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Five associations and two communities were classified. These vegetation units were contained in two alliances. The Clerodendro- Derriion trifoliateae is a tropical mantle community, and it occurs in the coastal areas of most of the Nansei Islands, especially in mangrove forest regions. The Clerodendro-Derriion trifoliate includes two associations dominated by evergreen erect-type shrubs. Aristolochio-Clematidion ryukyuensis is an endemic mantle community, and it occurs around many types of forest vegetation, eg natural Castanopsis cuspidata var. seiboldii forest and Leucaena leucocephala forest, in lowlands and mountain areas. The Aristolochio-Clematidion ryukyuensis includes five vegetation units, one association dominated by Rubus-type shrubs and two associations and two communities dominated by vines. -from English summary

AB  - Understanding the impact of environmental variables on interstrain competition is important to ensure the successful use of rhizobial inoculant. In eight inoculation trials conducted at five diverse sites on Maui, Hawaii, equal numbers of three serologically distinct strains of effective, homologous rhizobia in a peat-based inoculant were applied to seeds of soybean, bush bean, cowpea, lima bean, peanut, leucaena, clover, and tinga pea. We studied the influence of environmental variables on interstrain competition between applied and indigenous rhizobia and among the three strains comprising the inoculum. Although temperature and soil fertility were correlated with nodule occupancy by inoculant strains in a few cases, the most significant environmental variable controlling their competitive success was the size of the indigenous rhizobial population. Nodule occupancy was best described (r2 = 0.51, p < 0.001) by the equation y = 97.88 - 15.03(log10(x + 1)), where y is percent nodule occupancy by inoculant rhizobia and x is the most probable number of indigenous rhizobia per gram soil. For each legume, one of the three inoculant strains was a poor competitor across sites. Competition between the other two strains varied between sites, but was infrequently related to environmental variables. Results indicated that competitive strains could be selected that perform well across a range of environments.

AB  - The so-called common nodulation (nod) gene cluster of Bradyrhizobium japonicum is characterized by a unique composition of genes that are arranged in the following order: nodY, nodA, nodB, nodC, nodS, nodU, nodI, nodJ. As reported here, the identification of the two new genes nodS and nodU resulted from the DNA sequencing of a 4.5-kilobase nodC-downstream region covering nodS, nodU, nodI, and nodJ. The predicted NodS, NodU, NodI, and NodJ proteins had the following respective amino acid (aa) lengths and molecular weights (M r): 209 aa, Mx 23,405; 569 aa, Mr 62,068; 306 aa, Mr 34,127; and 262 aa, Mr 28,194. The 3′ end of nodC overlapped the 5′ end of nodS by 71 nucleotides. Using translational fusions of lacZ to nodC, nodS, and nodU, the expression of these genes was shown to be inducible by the isoflavone daidzein and depended on transcription from a DNA region farther upstream. These data and the adjacent location of all genes suggested the existence of a nodYABCSUIJ operon. The nodI and nodJ gene products shared about 70% sequence similarity with the corresponding Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae proteins; NodI belongs to the family of ATP-binding proteins that are constituents of bacterial binding protein-dependent transport systems. By interspecies hybridization, DNA regions homologous to nodSU were detected in other strains of Bradyrhizobium. Likewise, nodS- and nodU-like genes were identified in Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 (A. Lewin, E. Cervantes, W. Chee-Hoong, and W. J. Broughton, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions 3:317-326, 1990) in which nodS confers host specificity for Leucaena leucocephala. We constructed B. japonicum nodS and nodU mutants that, however, had no altered nodulation behavior on soybean, cowpea, mung bean, and Siratro. © 1990 The American Phytopathological Society.

AB  - Measurements of incident solar radiation were made in sequentially cropped maize (Zea mays L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) planted between hedgerows of shrubs in an alley cropping pattern. The incident solar-radiation profile was examined and its effect on crop yield determined. The study involved four different species of shrubs (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit, Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp, Alchornea cordifolia, and Acioa barterii), planted at two row spacings (2 and 4 m) and two fertilizer rates (F1=45-20-20 and F2=90-40-40 kg of N-P-K ha-1) applied to the maize crop only. The hedgerows were periodically pruned, and the prunings added as mulch to the respective plots. The control plots were cropped without hedgerows. There was partial shading of the crops by the hedgerows despite periodic pruning of the shrubs. Incident radiation measured at the height of the leaves subtending the ear in maize, and just above the canopy in cowpea, decreased exponentially as a function of an index defined by the ratio of the relative height of the shrubs above the respective height of measurement in the crops (Hs-Hc) to the distance (D) between the hedgerow and the adjacent crop row. A higher degree of shading associated with the faster growing species (Leucaena, Gliricidia) and/or closer inter-hedgerow spacing resulted in corresponding decreases in crop yield. Larger amounts of hedgerow biomass production (> 5 t ha-1 dry weight) were found to be associated with significant decreases in crop yields owing to increased hedgerow shading particularly with Leucaena. Hedgerows and the organic residue mulch from the prunings contributed to an overall improvement in soil moisture retention. © 1990.

AB  - An experiment was conducted at ICRISAT Center, Patancheru, India from June 1984 to April 1988 on a shallow Alfisol to determine whether the productivity of annual crop systems can be improved by adding perennial species such as Leucaena leucocephala managed as hedgerows. Except in the first year, crop yields were suppressed by Leucaena due to competition for moisture. The severity of competition was high in years of low rainfall and on long-duration crops such as castor and pigeonpea. Based on total biomass, sole Leucaena was most productive; even on the basis of land productivity requiring both Leucaena fodder and annual crops, alley cropping had little or no advantage over block planting of both components. Application of hedge prunings as green manure or mulch on top of 60 kg N and 30 kg P2O5ha-1 to annual crops did not show any benefit during the experimental period, characterized by below average rainfall. Indications are that (i) alley cropping was beneficial in terms of soil and water conservation with less runoff and soil loss with 3 m alleys than with 5.4 m alleys, and (ii) root pruning or deep ploughing might be effective in reducing moisture competition. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A beef cattle system to produce animals at 2.5 years of age, suitable for slaughter or finishing elsewhere on a high energy ration, was designed. The system used native pasture supplemented with an area of Leucaena leucocephala. The usual situation of liveweight losses during the cool, dry, winter months was reversed. This reversal was caused by the greater nutrient concentrations in the leucaena than in the native pasture. The potential to modify the system to produce cattle suitable for other beef markets is discussed. © 1991.

AB  - Transfer of a cosmid containing nodSU from Rhizobium sp. NGR234 to Rhizobium fredii USDA257 expands the host range for nodulation to include the perennial tropical legumes, Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena diversifolia. Complementation experiments with a series of subclones established that nodS and its associated nod‐box promoter from NGR234 are sufficient to confer this extended host‐range phenotype to L. leucocephala. Strain USDA257 contains its own copy of nodSU, including upstream nod‐box sequences. Although both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the reading frames are homologous between the two strains, there are gaps within the promoter region and the 5′‐end of nodS of USDA257. Consequently, the deduced NodS protein of USDA2S7 is shorter than its counterpart from NGR234, and the distance between the nod‐box and the initiation codon is greater. A 36 bp deletion encompasses the extreme right border of the USDA257 nod‐box and extends into the upstream leader sequence. Transcriptional fusions with both nod‐boxes confirmed that the promoter from NGR234 is flavonoid‐inducible, and that the nod‐box from USDA257 is not. These observations were corroborated by Northern analysis with a nodS‐containing Xhol fragment as hybridization probe. Flavonoid‐induced cells of NGR234 gave an intense signal, but those of USDA257 yielded only a weak trace of hybridization. EcoRl fragments with homology to nodSU of USDA257 are present in 17 of 35 tested strains, including several representatives ofBradyrhizobium japonicum, Rhizobium sp., R. loti, and R. fredii. Two wild‐type, leucaena‐nodulating strains of Rhizobium sp. lack this homology. We conclude that a genetic defect in expression of nodS accounts for the inability of USDA257 to nodulate leucaena and that diverse rhizobia may have evolved alternative mechanisms to nodulate this legume species.

AB  - The psyllid Heteropsylla cubana Crawford, a pest on Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Leguminosae), invaded New Caledonia in October 1985. The lady-bird Olla v-nigrum (Mulsant) was introduced from Tahiti in early 1987 to control the pest, and its biology was studied in control conditions. At 25,7°C (24,6/26,8) the median for the duration of the development from egg to adult is 16,5 days. At 25,8°C (25/26,6), using the hatching rate observed on wild female egg batches, the net reproductive rate R0=201,4, the innate capacity for increase rm=0,165, the mean length of a generation T=32,2 days. The observed rate of egg hatching decreased during the life of females in the cohort, resulting in lower values: R0=153,9, rm=0,160, T=31,4 days. When compared to other preys, these values indicate that H. cubana is highly suitable as a prey for O. v-nigrum, though it is toxic for most polyphagous predators. By July 1989, O. v-nigrum was present in most parts of New Caledonia. © 1991 Lavoisier Abonnements.

AB  - In 1977 a fallow improvement program was initiated in Occidental Mindoro, Philippines using Leucaena leucocephala to shorten the fallow period in local shifting cultivation practices. Evaluation of the programme in 1989 suggests that the practice of planting leucaena as a fallow improvement crop has been adapted and widely adopted by farmers. Farmers using leucaena have successfully shortened fallow periods from over 6-8 years to 2-4 years with no reported reduction in crop yields. The leucaena psyllid has had little or no effect on farmer acceptance and use of the system. Soil properties under burned and unburned leucaena and natural bush fallows were analyzed. Exchangeable calcium was significantly lower at 50 cm soil depth under the natural bush fallow. Soil pH in the 0-10 cm horizon was significantly higher under the bush fallow, suggesting that Ca extraction and deposition at the soil surface was greater under the natural bush fallow. No significant difference between natural and leucaena fallows were found for other soil properties. Surface soils of burned leucaena fallows were significantly lower in organic mattern and Mg than unburned fallows. © 1991.

AB  - Early growth of leucaena (Leucaena leucoceohala (Lam) de Wit) is often slow, especially on soils low in organic matter and total N. This study was conducted to determine whether small quantity of N fertilizer in combination with P will enhance early growth. Nitrogen as urea was applied at 0, 25, and 100 mg/kg soil with 50 mg P/kg soil as monocalcium phosphate or without P to leucaena seedlings in pots. All plants were inoculated with leucaena Rhizobium (LX 382). Growth rates declined from 0.3 cm/day at 14 to 0.22 cm/day at 42 days after planting (DAP) in no-P plants. Fertilizer N and P application increased growth rates sharply thus hastening shoot and root dry matter accumulation. P uptake was enhanced with 25 mg N/kg soil at 42 and 84 DAP, but not at 126 DAP. It appears small amount of N applied with adequate P enhanced P uptake and hence early growth of leucaena. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rhizobial specificity, defined in terms of nodulation and nitrogen-fixing effectiveness characteristics of a group of rhizobia on a host legume, serves as a basis for predicting the need to inoculate, selecting species for most probable number plant-infection assays, and preparing rhizobial inoculants suitable for a range of legume species. A series of inoculation experiments were performed under growth room and greenhouse conditions to delineate rhizobial specificity of a variety of tree legumes. Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra calothyrsus, and Leucaena leucocephala nodulated effectively with rhizobia isolated from each of the three genera. With a few exceptions, Sesbania grandiflora and Robinia pseudoacacia nodulated effectively only with rhizobial strains isolated from each genus respectively. A range of specificity was found among species that nodulate with Bradyrhizobium. Whereas Acacia mearnsii nodulated with most strains but fixed N2 effectively with relatively few, Acacia mangium and Lysiloma latisiliqua were specific for both nodulation and effectiveness.

AB  - Species of plants distinctly differing in their dependence on vesicular-ar- buscular mycorrhizal (VAM) symbiosis were grown in potted soil at soil solution P levels ranging from 0.003 to 0.6 mg L-1. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization levels generally decreased with increase in soil solution P concentrations, the degree of decrease being more pronounced with decrease in VAM dependency of host species. Mycorrhizal inoculation effect (MIE) disappeared at a much lower soil solution P concentration in the marginally to moderately VAM dependent Sesbania species compared to MIE noted in Leucaena leucocephala, a very highly VAM-dependent species. Under nonmycorrhizal condition, the former species exhibited lower external and higher internal P requirement for dry matter production compared to the latter species. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A 12-week greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the effect of the polyphenol, lignin and N contents of six legumes on their N mineralization rate in soil and to compare estimates of legume-N release by the difference and 15N-recovery methods. Mature tops of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), round leaf cassia (Cassia rotundifolia Pers., var. Wynn), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam., deWit), Fitzroy stylo (Stylosanthes scabra Vog., var Fitzroy), snail medic (Medicago scutellata L.), and vigna (Vigna trilobata L., var verde) were incorporated in soil at the rate of 100 mg legume N kg-1 soil. The medic and vigna were labeled with 15N. Sorghum-sudan hybrid (Sorghum bicolor, L. Moench) was used as the test crop. A non-amended treatment was used as a control. Net N mineralization after 12 weeks ranged from 11% of added N with cassia to 47% of added N for alfalfa. With the two legumes that contained less than 20 g kg-1 of N, stylo and cassia, there was net N immobilization for the first 6 weeks of the experiment. The legume (lignin + polyphenol):N ratio was significantly correlated with N mineralization at all sampling dates at the 0.05 level and at the 0.01 level at 6 weeks (r2=0.866). Legume N, lignin, or polyphenol concentrations or the lignin:N ratio were not significantly correlated with N mineralization at any time. The polyphenol:N ratio was only significantly correlated with N mineralization after 9 weeks (r2=0.692). The (lignin + polyphenol):N ratio appears to be a good predictor of N mineralization rates of incorporated legumes, but the method for analyzing plant polyphenol needs to be standardized. Estimates of legume-N mineralization by the difference and 15N recovery methods were significantly different at all sampling dates for both 15N-labeled legumes. After 12 weeks, estimates of legume-N mineralization averaged 20% more with the difference method than with the 15N recovery method. This finding suggests that estimates of legume N available to subsequent crops should not be based solely on results from 15N recovery experiments. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - This paper reports on the feasibliity of intercropping leguminous fodder trees in an agropastoral community in southern Somalia. The Homboy Agroforestry Project is small-scale and was designed to use informal on-farm trials backed by extension work. The primary objective was to provide high-protein cattle fodder during the dry-season by intercropping leguminous trees, such as Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium. -from Author

AB  - The intake of temperate forages by herbivores can be determined using the C33 alkane naturally present in the forage and dosed C32alkane. To determine whether the technique can be used with tropical forages, the concentrations of C33 alkane were determined in seven species. The leaves of Brachiaria decumbens, Digitaria decumbens, Pennisetum glaucum and Stylosanthes scabra contained sufficient C33 alkane (> 50 mg/kg DM) for the estimation of dry matter intake. Low concentrations of C33 alkane were found in the leaves of Setaria sphacelata, Sorghum sp. and Leucaena leucocephala. Setaria sphacelata was found to contain high concentrations of C27alkane and therefore intake could be estimated by using C28as the dosed alkane although the intake would possibly then be underestimated by c. 8 Leaves of Sorghum sp. contained > 50 mg C31alkane/kg DM and, with C32as the dosed alkane, intake would possibly be underestimated by c. 5 Leucaena leucocephala contained insufficient alkanes to estimate forage intake. The concentration of n-alkanes in Pennisetum glaucum and Sorghum sp. leaves decreased with age. It was concluded that some tropical forages contain insufficient C33 alkane for the measurement of intake by the double alkane technique. In these species, a shorter chain length alkane can sometimes be used, but only with a reduction in accuracy in estimating intake. © 1991, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indigenous rhizobia in soil present a competition barrier to the establishment of inoculant strains, possibly leading to inoculation failure. In this study, we used the natural diversity of rhizobial species and numbers in our fields to define, in quantitative terms, the relationship between indigenous rhizobial populations and inoculation response. Eight standardized inoculation trials were conducted at five well-characterized field sites on the island of Maui, Hawaii. Soil rhizobial populations ranged from 0 to over 3.5 x 104 g of soil-1 for the different legumes used. At each site, no less than four but as many as seven legume species were planted from among the following: soybean (Glycine max), lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), peanut (Arachis hypogaea), Leucaena leucocephala, tinga pea (Lathyrus tingeatus), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and clover (Trifolium repens). Each legume was (i) inoculated with an equal mixture of three effective strains of homologous rhizobia, (ii) fertilized at high rates with urea, or (iii) left uninoculated. For soybeans, a nonnodulating isoline was used in all trials as the rhizobia-negative control. Inoculation increased economic yield for 22 of the 29 (76%) legume species-site combinations. While the yield increase was greater than 100 kg ha-1 in all cases, in only 11 (38%) of the species-site combinations was the increase statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05). On average, inoculation increased yield by 62%. Soybean (G. max) responded to inoculation most frequently, while cowpea (V. unguiculata) failed to respond in all trials. Inoculation responses in the other legumes were site dependent. The response to inoculation and the competitive success of inoculant rhizobia were inversely related to numbers of indigenous rhizobia. As few as 50 rhizobia g of soil-1 eliminated inoculation response. When fewer than 10 indigenous rhizobia g of soil-1 were present, economic yield was significantly increased 85% of the time. Yield was significantly increased in only 6% of the observations when numbers of indigenous rhizobia were greater than 10 cells g of soil-1. A significant response to N application, significant increases in nodule parameters, and greater than 50% nodule occupancy by inoculant rhizobia did not necessarily coincide with significant inoculation responses. No less than a doubling of nodule mass and 66% nodule occupancy by inoculant rhizobia were required to significantly increase the yield of inoculated crops over that of uninoculated crops. However, lack of an inoculation response was common even when inoculum strains occupied the majority of nodules. in these trials, the symbiotic yield of crops was, on average, only 88% of the maximum yield potential, as defined by the fertilizer N treatment. The difference between the yield of N-fertilized crops and the N2-fixing crops indicates a potential for improving inoculation technology, the N2 fixation capacity of rhizobial strains, and the efficiency of symbiosis. In this study, we show that the probability of enhancing yield with existing inoculation technology decreases dramatically with increasing numbers of indigenous rhizobia.

AB  - The effect of the fungicide, chlorothalonil, on vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) symbiosis was studied in a greenhouse using Leucaena leucocephala as test plant. Chlorothalonil was applied to soil at 0, 50, 100 and 200 μg g-1. The initial soil solution P levels were 0.003 μg mL-1 (sub-optimal) and 0.026 μg mL-1 (optimal). After 4 weeks, the sub-optimal P level was raised to 0.6 μg mL-1 (high). The soil was either uninoculated or inoculated with the VAM fungus, Glomus aggregatum. The fungicide reduced mycorrhizal colonization of roots, development of mycorrhizal effectiveness, shoot P concentration and uptake and dry matter yields at all concentrations tested, although the highest inhibitory effect was noted as the concentration of the fungicide was increased from 50 to 100 μg g-1. Phosphorus applied after four weeks tended to partially offset the deleterious effects of chlorothalonil in plants grown in the inoculated and uninoculated soil which suggests that the fungicide was interfering with plant P uptake. The results suggest that the use of chlorothalonil should be restricted to levels below 50 μg g-1 if the benefits of mycorrhizal symbiosis are to be expected. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Casuarina equisetifolia, Albizia procera, Eucalyptus robusta and two varieties of Leucaena leucocephala (K8 and P.R.) were grown for 5.5 years in an experimental plantation in the Lajas Valley of Puerto Rico (18°N, 67°W). Rates of biomass accumulation were high, resulting in correspondingly high rates of nutrient accumulation in harvestable biomass. A comparison among species and among tissue types within species indicated that nutrient-use efficiency for N, P, K, Ca and Mg varied widely among species (ranging up to 10-fold differences) and tissues (up to 15-fold). With the highest growth rate, Casuarina was most efficient in using nutrients (N, P, K and Mg) to build biomass. With a quarter of Casuarina's growth rate, Leucaena K8 was the least efficient (N, K, Ca and Mg). For most of the studied nutrients, stem wood and large branches were the most nutrient-efficient tissue, followed by small branches, bark and then leaves. Nutrients stored in the litter layer below these species varied up to three-fold among species. Using a variety of species and biomass harvest scenarios, this study demonstrated the potential for significant alterations in the high rates of nutrient removal associated with short-rotation, intensively managed plantations. © 1991.

AB  - The effects of lime and P on the chemical composition of the tropical legume Leucaena leucocephala were studied in a controlled climate laboratory experiment using 4 (Koronivia, Nadroloulou, Batiri, and Seqaqa) highly-weathered, acid soils from Fiji. For all soils, changes in the concentration of P in the Leucaena tops followed trends similar to the yield response curve, i.e., the concentration of P was highest at the soil pH at which maximum growth occurred. The concentration of Al in plant tops increased on either side of the pH of maximum growth, but Al uptake by the whole plant (tops plus roots) declined steadily with increasing pH. Although complete major (except P) and minor nutrients were added regularly, there was variation in the uptake of nutrients with pH. Poor growth at low pH values was attributed to an Al-induced P deficiency within the plant and at high pH to a soil P deficiency and, to a smaller extent, to the increased concentration of Al in the plant tops. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

TI  - Heterologous exopolysaccharide production in Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 and consequences for nodule development
PY  - 1991

AB  - Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 produces large amounts of acidic exopolysaccharide. Mutants that fail to synthesize this exopolysaccharide are also unable to nodulate the host plant Leucaena leucocephala. A hybrid strain of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 containing exo genes from Rhizobium meliloti was constructed. The background genetics and nod genes of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 are retained, but the cluster of genes involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis was deleted. These exo genes were replaced with genes required for the synthesis of succinoglycan exopolysaccharide from R. meliloti. As a result of the genetic manipulation, the ability of these hybrids to synthesize exopolysaccharide was restored, but the structure was that of succinoglycan and not that of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234. The replacement genes were contained on a cosmid which encoded the entire known R. meliloti exo gene cluster, with the exception of exoB. Cosmids containing smaller portions of this exo gene cluster did not restore exopolysaccharide production. The presence of succinoglycan was indicated by staining with the fluorescent dye Calcofluor, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and monosaccharide analysis. Although an NGR234 exoY mutant containing the R. meliloti exo genes produced multimers of the succinoglycan repeat unit, as does the wild-type R. meliloti, the deletion mutant of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 containing the R. meliloti exo genes produced only the monomer. The deletion mutant therefore appeared to lack a function that affects the multiplicity of succinoglycan produced in the Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 background. Although these hybrid strains produced succinoglycan, they were still able to induce the development of an organized nodule structure on L. leucocephala. The resulting nodules did not fix nitrogen, but they did contain infection threads and bacteroids within plant cells. This clearly demonstrated that a heterologous acidic exopolysaccharide structure was sufficient to enable nodule development to proceed beyond the developmental barrier imposed on mutants of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 that are unable to synthesize any acidic exopolysaccharide.

AB  - Perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp.) was grown as a multipurpose tree species in strips or blocks with annual crops (sorghum, sunflower and chickpea) on a shallow Vertisol from 1987 to 1989. The interaction between the perennial pigeonpea and annual crops was measured at the tree-crop interface (TCI) by comparing the plants at the interface (I) and in the middle of the block planting (N). Perennial pigeonpea I plants had significantly more branches and bigger stems than N plants at the onset of the following rainy season. The greater number of flowers and grains of the I pigeonpea plants was partly due to a better lateral light level and partly due to a better access to water. On the other hand the negative effect on annual crops at the TCI extended to 1.5 m during the rainy season and to 2.5 m during the post-rainy season. Significant reduction in the growth of annual crops occurred at 30-40 days after sowing and was associated with the shading by the taller pigeonpea. Measurements of root profile of pigeonpea at the interface indicated that competition for moisture was the major cause for yield reduction of chickpea during the post-rainy season but an allelopathetic effect may also be involved. The results are compared with other TCI studies especially with Leucaena leucocephala in the semi-arid crops and the possible mechanisms for moisture interaction at the TCI are discussed. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Steud) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) hedgerow species reduced density of speargrass (Imperata cylindrica (L.) Raeuschel) by 67% and 51%, respectively. Shoot biomass of speargrass decreased by 81% and 78% in gliricidia and leucaena hedgerows, respectively. Reduction in speargrass rhizome biomass in gliricidia plots was 96% while rhizome reduction in the leucaena plots was nearly 90%. Rhizome mortality was significantly higher in gliricidia plots than in leucaena and control plots. The bulk of rhizomes was found between 10 cm and 20 cm of soil depth but rhizome did not penetrate further than 30 cm depth in the Alfisol in which this study was carried out. Gliricidia was better than leucaena hedgerow species in suppressing speargrass. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A major problem for small farmers in the semi-arid tropics is the chronic shortage of fodder for draft animals. Leucaena leucocephala has improved productivity in many places in India and in various cropping systems, usually as either a pure crop or in a hedgerow alley-cropping configuration. Mixed cropping with arboreal forms is seldom seen. For off-season fodder production, hedgerows have the disadvantage of being open to unmanaged browsing when unfenced (as is usual). Arboreal forms are generally far less vulnerable. In this paper, the components of production of sorghum and arboreal Leucaena are measured under different intensities of canopy lopping. The most productive management system of those examined was pollarding of the Leucaena at the time of under-sowing with sorghum. In a year with less than 50% of average seasonal rainfall, this system gave a yield of 4.6 tonnes/ha/yr fresh wt fodder and 3.8 tonnes/ha/yr dry wt. of fuel harvests, while increasing the standing crop of wood by 1.8 t/ha/yr and retaining a yield of sorghum grain equivalent to 46% of pure sorghum cropping; the LER of this system was 1.35. Cash values of the alternative management systems were estimated, including the discounted Net Present Value of the standing crop of timber. Maximum value was attained with unlopped pure crop Leucaena followed by pollarded Leucaena with sorghum; pure crop sorghum achieved a lower value. These results demonstrate both the high productivity of Leucaena/sorghum based systems, and the stability of production even in poor rainfall conditions. Pollarding transferred the high future value of Leucaena timber to the present value of sorghum grain and fuelwood. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - This study was conducted to identify and characterize rumen bacteria that are able to degrade the toxic compound, 3-hydroxy-4(lH)-pyridone (3,4 DHP), that is produced in the rumen from mimosine. Mimosine is a non-protein amino acid that is found in leaves and seeds of Leucaena leucocephala, a leguminous tree used as a forage crop for ruminants in the tropics, and degradation of 3,4 DHP by ruminal microbes is critical for protection of animals from leucaena toxicity. Microbes with this capacity are, however, not ubiquitous and microbial populations in the rumens of animals in some parts of the world are unable to metabolize 3,4 DHP. Four strains of obligately anaerobic, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that degrade 3,4 DHP were isolated from rumen contents from a goat in Hawaii. The isolates do not ferment carbohydrates, but are able to use both 3,4 DHP and its isomer, 3-hydroxy-2(lH)-pyridone (2,3 DHP), as well as arginine and histidine as substrates for growth. Comparisons of the 16S rRNA sequence from one of these isolates with sequences from a widely diverse group of bacteria agree with other information indicating that these isolates do not fit into any existing taxon. Thus, we are hereby proposing a new genus and species designation, Synergistes jonesii, for these organisms. © 1992, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart · New York. All rights reserved.

Evidence is presented to indicate that in mixed culture, sorghum gains an average of 0.03 mg N day-1 plant-1 relative to sole-cropped sorghum in N-limiting sand culture. The gain in N content of intercropped sorghum, however, represented less than 1% of the N budget of N-fixing Leucaena and was inadequate to sustain normal physiological development of sorghum. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Fuelwood production from a high density leucaena-based fodder production experiment at Mtwapa, Coast Province, Kenya is reported. Leucaena with and without other fodder crops namely, Cassava, Bana and Napier grass, formed the main-plot treatments while leucaena densities ranging from 6,250 to 100,000 ha-1 planted in single- or double-line planting arrangements formed the sub-plot treatments of the split-plot design used. Each treatment was replicated four times. The experiment was established and maintained without the use of fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation. Hand weeding was done only during the first year. After 2.7 years growth, height and diameter measurements were taken before cutting back the leucaena stems to 0.5 m above ground. Utilizable fuelwood (twigs greater than 0.5 mm diameter) was then sun-dried for 3 months and dry weights taken. Fuelwood yields were significantly reduced by the fodder intercrops. Yield from leucaena intercropped with fodder crops were, on average, 30% lower than yield from sole stands of leucaena. Mean yields of the single-line plantings ranged from 13.7 to 21.2 tons ha-1. Yield from the double-line plantings were lower (on average 10%) than that of single-line plantings and were as well highly variable. Unlike tree heights, diameters in the single-line planting arrangement were not affected significantly by the fodder intercrops. In the single line plantings, yield of fuelwood from sole stand of leucaena was higher at all in-row spacings than the yield from intercropped leucaena. Increase in in-row spacing of leucaena generally led to reduced yield of fuelwood. Fodder yields of intercropped Cassava, Bana and Napier grasses were near normal in the first year but zero or negligible in the remaining 1.7 years. Implications of the prolonged tree establishment period on fodder yields after opening of the canopy are discussed. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, a possible virus and nematodes have been recorded on Leucaena leucocephala and at least seven other Leucaena species throughout the tropics. Most diseases are caused by fungi and include leaf spots, gummosis, pod rots, root and collar rots, stem cankers, anthracnoses, damping-off, rusts and shoot and twig blights. The most important diseases are considered to be Camptomeris leaf spot (CLS) (Camptomeris leucaenae) gummosis and various root and pod rots. Although not a lethal disease, CLS can cause serious forage dry matter and quality losses. Gummosis is regarded as the most important disease of L. leucocephala in India and Sri Lanka, but further work is urgently required on its pathology and economic importance. Root rots caused by Ganoderma species, Fusarium species, Pseudolagar-obasidium leguminicola and Pirex subvinosum kill L. leucocephala trees throughout Asia and Australia. Pod rots caused by Fusarium species are of major concern not only because of their direct effects in reducing seed production but also due to their seed-borne nature. Control strategies based on resistance and cultural management through cutting and grazing are considered the most practical and economic methods. Treatments to control seed-borne pathogens are essential to reduce establishment problems and for low-risk germplasm movement. This review is intended to be of use for pasture and forestry researchers as well as quarantine officers in developing countries. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - The effect of lime-containing sugarcane millmud, lime, and phosphorus (P), added separately and/or in combination, on soil chemical properties and the growth of the tropical legume Leucaena leucocephala was investigated in an oxisol from Fij, Millmud was added so that the pH of the soil was increased from 5·0 to 6·0. The millmud contained high concentrations of several essential major and minor nutrients. Olsen- and water-extractable P in the soil increased with lime and/or millmud addition, whereas M KCl-extractable Al decreased to undetectable levels. The solution composition of soils treated with millmud showed a pronounced increase in all of the major and minor nutrients investigated, whereas lime addition only caused an increase in Ca. Plant growth was very low in the unamended soil, even in the presence of added P. However, addition of millmud caused a marked increase in yield which was 3-4 times higher than with the soils treated with lime only. Because many of the soils in Fiji are strongly weathered, acidic and have a low nutrient status, the result obtained suggests that an appropriate use of millmud would prove beneficial to formers. © 1992.

AB  - Nitrogen fixed in 13 provenances of Acacia albida and 11 isolines of Leucaena leucocephala inoculated with effective Rhizobium strains was measured by 15N techniques and the total N difference method. In the test soil, on the average, L. leucocephala derived about 65% of its total N from atmospheric N2 fixation compared to about 20% by A. albida. Significant differences in the percentage of N derived from atmospheric N2 (% Ndfa) occurred, between provenances or isolines within species. The % Ndfa ranged from 37 to 74% within L. leucocephala and from 6 to 37 within A. albida; (equivalent to 20-50 mg N plant-1 and 4-37 mg N plant-1 for the two species over three months, respectively) and was correlated with the nodule mass (r=0.91). The time course of N2 fixation of three selected provenances (low, intermediate and good fixers) was followed at 12 weekly intervals over a 36 week period. The % Ndfa of all provenances and isolines increased with time; and except for one of the L. leucocephala provenances, % Ndfa was similar within species at the 36 weeks harvest. There was a significant correlation between % Ndfa and the amount of N2 fixed (r=0.96). Significant interactions occurred between provenances and N treatments and often growth of uninoculated but N fertilized plants was less variable than for inoculated unfertilized plants. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Ecological interactions between trees and crops are examined in terms of above and below ground utilizations of physical resources. Above ground interactions such as changes in light, temperature, and humidity are analyzed in terms of possible effects on understory crops. Our analysis shows that atmospheric interactions in alley cropping in the semi-arid tropics are positive but of minor importance compared with below ground interactions. Separation of below ground interactions by a shallow polythene barrier (0.5 m) indicated that competition for soil moisture is responsible for the negative interactions reported in the semi-arid tropics (SAT). Measurements of root distribution showed that roots of Leucaena leucocephala Lam. trees are abundant in the top 30 cm of the soil and the presence of a root barrier was effective in restricting lateral movement of the roots. This evidence is contrary to the assumption that trees have deep rooting systems which do not compete with crops. A secondary aim is to illustrate the contrasting problems encountered in intercropping and agroforestry systems. The importance or root studies are highlighted and the ways in which positive interactions could be achieved are investigated. © 1991.

AB  - In West Java, Indonesia, Leucaena leucocephala (plant density 1 × 0.5 m), cut at either 30 cm or 100 cm, was interplanted with either a short grass (Setaria sphacelata var. splendida) or a tall grass (Pennisetum purpureum). Highest leaf production was in the setaria monoculture (20.8 t ha-1 yr-1) and the low-cut leucaena/setaria mixture (18.5 t ha-1 yr-1), with the grass dominating production (>88%) in the latter because of the ability of setaria to gain preferential access to light penetrating between the rows of leucaena early in each growth period. Leucaena shoot production in the low-cut leucaena treatments was reduced from a mean of 8.8 t ha-1 yr-1 in monocultures to 1.5 t ha-1 yr-1 in mixtures. For high-cut leucaena treatments, grass leaf yields were lower from the mixtures than from the monocultures but leucaena shoot yields were only reduced from monoculture yields in the mixture with pennisetum. The mixture of setaria and high-cut leucaena produced a considerable yield of setaria leaf (6.2 t ha-1 yr-1) with no reduction in leucaena leaf yields and intercepted a significantly greater percentage of total incident light (64%) than the other three mixtures (42-52%). -from Authors

AB  - Nonheme-iron absorption from a typical Southeast Asian meal was studied to examine the effect of a common vegetable, Yod Kratin, which contains a considerable amount of iron-binding phenolic groups. Yod Kratin (leaves of the lead tree) is a very popular vegetable in Thailand. It is consumed at least once a week year round, sometimes every day, together with the main meal. With a common portion size of the vegetable (20 g), iron absorption was reduced by almost 90%. As little as 5 g inhibited iron absorption by 75%. Addition of ascorbic acid partly counteracted inhibition. Adding 100 mg ascorbic acid reduced inhibition of iron absorption from 5 g Yod Kratin by half and the inhibition from 10 g Yod Kratin by a quarter. The study illustrates the marked effect of iron-binding phenolic compounds on iron nutrition and, thus, the importance of acquiring knowledge of the content of such compounds in different foods.

AB  - A field trial on four varieties of Leucaena leucocephala and two species of Sesbania on marginal lands for biomass production carried out at the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute, Jhansi, showed that thinning at the half rotation age gave interim income and advantage for higher biomass yield. Sesbania species could not be compared with Leucaena due to their poor coppicing after harvest and smaller life span. Out of the four varieties compared, Silvi-4 gave peak annual preduction of 49.77 t per ha closely followed by K-8 (48.31 t) and the lowest in case of K-500 (21.03 t). -Authors

AB  - We have cloned and sequenced the pckA gene of Rhizobium sp. NGR234, a broad host-range strain. The gene encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis. The locus was isolated and subcloned from a genomic library of NGR234 employing hybridization with an R. meliloti pck gene probe and complementation of a Tn5 mutant in this species. The DNA sequence of pckA (NGR234) was determined and encoded a PEPCK protein of 535 amino acids with a molecular weight of 58.4 kDa. The deduced polypeptide sequence was compared to those of three known ATP-dependent PEPCKs. Slightly higher homology was observed with yeast and trypanosome polypeptides than with that of Escherichia coli. We have identified several regions that are conserved in all four PEPCK proteins. A mutant constructed in the pck gene by site-directed mutagenesis with interposon Ω failed to grow on succinate, malate and arabinose but grew on glucose and glycerol as sole carbon sources. These data show that NGR234 requires PEPCK-driven gluconeogenesis to grow on TCA cycle intermediates. A host-dependent effect of the pckA mutation was observed on nodule development and nitrogen fixation. Nodules formed by the site-directed mutant on Leucaena leucocephala and Macroptilium atropurpureum were FixRed, but on Vigna unguiculata were Fix-. The expression of the gene was positively regulated in free-living cells of NGR234 by either succinate or host-plant exudates, and was subject to catabolite repression by glucose. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The effects of lime and P addition on the amounts of soil extractable P and Al, and on the growth of the tropical legume Leucaena leucocephala were investigated in a factorial experiment under controlled climate conditions using 4 (Koronivia, Nadroloulou, Batiri, and Seqaqa) highly-weathered, acid (pH initially 3.9 to 4.9) soils from Fiji. Resin-extractable P increased with lime addition and then decreased above pH 5.5, whereas M KCl-extractable Al decreased to undetectable levels at or above pH 5.2. Plant growth was usually adversely affected at low and high pH, even in the presence of added P. The pH (in M KCl) at which maximum growth occurred in the 4 soils varied from approximately 4.4 to 5.2; values somewhat lower than those reported in the literature. Changes in dry matter yield with increasing soil pH were strongly influenced by P status and a positive lime × P interaction was obtained with 3 of the 4 soils. Above pH 5.2, liming decreased the yield of both tops and roots, for reasons which are discussed in part II. The data obtained for extractable soil P and plant P concentrations indicate that P deficiency is a major problem on these soils. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The productivity of Leucaena leucocephala and a superior L. pulverulenta family were examined over a 3-year period at spacings (1.5 m×1.5 m and 1.5×3.0 m) chosen to compare two mechanical weeding operations. Leucaena pulverulenta was examined since faster-growing families of this cold-hardy, low-mimosine leucaena species were recently identified. There was no significant difference in yields between the species (P = 0.9060) but there was a significant difference between spacings (P = 0.0491). There was no significant spacing×species, species×year or spacing×year interaction. The annual growth rates for the first, second, and third seasons' growth for L. leucocephala were 3.73, 10.11 and 6.00 t ha-1 at the close spacing and 3.03, 7.14 and 5.04 for the wider spacing. The annual growth-rates for the first, second and third seasons' growth for L. pulverulenta were 2.03, 8.35 and 8.31 t ha-1 at the close spacing and 1.25, 9.38 and 5.29 at the wider spacing. Despite the fact that L. leucocephala froze to the ground in the first and second winter when L. pulverulenta was nearly undamaged, the L. leucocephala coppice resprout was greater than the second year's growth for L. pulverulenta. © 1991.

AB  - Three multipurpose tree species (MPTS)-leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), sesbania (Sesbania sesban var. nubica) and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) were pruned at a height of 60 cm above the ground every two months, and resulting plant biomass was incorporated into the soil as green manure. For comparison, maize (Zea mays) stover was also incorporated into some plots, while some other plots were left fallow. Varying quantities of plant biomass which were incorporated into the soil over a period of 12 months caused large changes in major soil plant nutrients, and it substantially improved soil fertility. To test for improved soil fertility, test crops of maize and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were grown on the plots after six biomass incorporations of 4806, 13603, 16659 and 7793 kg. ha-1yr-1 for pigeonpea, sesbania leucaena and maize, respectively. Responses of the test crops indicated that sesbania and leucaena green manures improved maize stover, cobs and grain yields; and bean haulms and grain yields by 77.6% when compared to fallow plots. Residual effects of green manures still resulted in significant (P < 0.05) yield differences in the test cropin the third testing season. Economic significance of green manures in increasing food crop yields to small scale farmers is discussed. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

The experiment was laid out in a completely randomised design with four replicates of each treatment. The treatments and controls were: (i) pure crops of maize, cowpea, sweet potato, Leucaena clean weeded and unweeded and (ii) intercrops of Leucaena with the food crops, both (iii) with and without applied fertilizers after the first year. The growth of Leucaena was slow but nevertheless tended to reduce grain yields of maize, and tuber and vine yields of sweet potato in the rows in the immediate vicinity of the trees, especially in the nitrogen-treated plots. The maize, in particular, caused an improvement in the early height growth of the trees. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Four swamp buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) and four crossbred Bos indicus x B. taurus cattle, fistulated at the rumen and abomasum or duodenum, were offered rice straw with mineral supplements in two experiments. In Expt 1, the straw was supplemented with 5 % of leaf of Leucaena leucocephala, and in Expt 2 with either urea or urea with sunflower meal and rice grain. Intake of supplements of urea or urea/sunflower/rice respectively was 935 and 681 g/kg offered in buffaloes and 566 and 789 in cattle. Buffaloes ruminated longer than cattle (Expt 1, 635 v. 452 min/day; Expt 2, 626 v. 466 min/day, P 0.01). In Expt 1, voluntary intake and frequency of ‘A’ sequence forestomach contractions of both species was not affected by species, but buffaloes had a greater (P 0 05) contraction force in the rumen and omasum, lower rate of ‘B’ sequence rumen contractions, and faster (P 0 001) rate of gastrointestinal passage than cattle. In Expt 2, voluntary intake of both species was similar, and addition of concentrates did not affect voluntary roughage consumption, nor in situ rate of digestion of rice straw. Rate and predicted extent of digestion of dietary materials did not differ between species in Expt 1, despite lower concentrations of ammonia in rumen fluid in cattle than buffaloes; however in Expt 2, the rate of digestion of rice straw was higher (P 0.05) and predicted extent of digestion was 14-20% (P 0.05) lower in buffaloes. Digestibility of cell wall constituents was lower (P 0.05) in buffaloes than in cattle in both experiments, but in Expt 2, provision of concentrates reduced (P 0 01) the proportion of digestible cell wall constituents digested in the forestomach of buffaloes, but not of cattle. Plasma urea concentrations were higher (P 0.05) and transfer of urea to the rumen tended to be higher (7.4 v. 3.7 gN/day; P 0.10) in buffaloes. Faster fractional outflow rates of microbes and of small digesta particles from the rumen were observed in buffaloes in Expt 1. In Expt 1, more microbial N left the abomasum (35 v. 30 g per kg organic matter apparently digested in the forestomach; P 0.05) of buffaloes than cattle, and in Expt 2 more non-ammonia N (43 v. 31 g per kg organic matter apparently digested in the forestomach) flowed into the intestines of buffaloes. In Expt 1 microbial retention time was shorter (26 v. 47 h; P 0.01) in the rumen of buffaloes. Patterns of appearance of plastic particles with time after dosing indicated faster escape from the rumen of buffaloes of non-chewed particles, and a greater proportion of particles subjected to ruminative chewing, than in cattle. Ruminative chewing of plastic particles in buffaloes was progressively more efficient than in cattle with increasing particle length and decreasing specific gravity. Analysis of faecal particle distribution indicated buffaloes tended to excrete smaller particles than cattle. The adaptive significance of faster digesta passage in the buffaloes appeared to derive from a more balanced supply of absorbed protein relative to digestible energy. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - The paper describes a tree/crop interface (TCI) experiment designed to investigate the effects of row orientation using Leucaena leucocephala Lam. Each TCI plot consisted of a regularly pruned Leucaena hedge in the middle and 12 crop rows on either side. Eight such plots were arranged at 45° around a sole Leucaena plot with rows oriented in four compass directions viz., North-South, East-West, Northeast-Southwest and Northwest-Southeast. Results of four years from 1984 to 1987 did not show any effect of row orientation, and similarly, no effect was seen on crop rows due to their location on the windward or leeward side of the hedge. The TCI effect was positive on the first crop row in the first year because Leucaena grew slowly, but depressed the yield of the first 4 to 6 crop rows(1.8 to 2.7 m from hedge) in subsequent years. The negative effect of Leucaena was noted more on sunflower in a relatively dry year than on sorghum in other years. Results from the TCI plots were used to estimate the yield of five hedgerow intercropping (HI) systems with varying alley widths (2.7 to 9.9 m). Comparison with sole stands of Leucaena and crops indicated that HI was more productive particularly at close alley widths. For example, hedges spaced at 2.7 m and 3.6 m averaged 37% and 25% higher productivity than the respective sole stands; but this advantage may be an overestimation of the real potential. The relevance of TCI experiments for studying agroforestry systems, their merits and limitations, especially of the design employed in this study are discussed. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Pot experiments were conducted in the greenhouse to determine the combined effects of lime, nitrogen and phosphorus and the relative importance of each of these nutrients in establishing nodulated and mycorrhizal Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit Var. K8 in an oxisol subjected to simulated erosion. Leucaena was grown in the soil inoculated or not with the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus aggregatum Schenck and Smith emend Koske, with or without a basal nutrient (basal) consisting of K, Mg, S, Zn, Cu, and B plus lime, N, and P (complete) or one of the latter three supplements. The extent of mycorrhizal colonization of roots as well as mycorrhizal effectiveness, as measured by pinnule P content increased when the eroded soil was amended with combinations of all the nutrients and inoculated with G. aggregatum. Similar trends were observed when symbiotic effectiveness was measured in terms of shoot P, Cu, and Zn status and dry matter yield. Nodule dry matter was also responsive to amendment of the soil with the complete nutrients and to vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation. Phosphorus was found to be the most important nutrient limiting mycorrhizal effectiveness in the eroded soil, followed by N and lime. It is concluded that lost nutrients, particularly P, need to be replaced before legumes can be established successfully on highly weathered eroded soils inoculated with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. © 1991 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

AB  - Based on four years of plot measurements in Butare (Rwanda), the potential of agroforestry practices for soil conservation was analysed. The agroforestry system investigated is based on Grevillea robusta planted at a density of 200 trees per hectare. Supplementary erosion control measures consisted of hedgerows planted on microterraces (two species of leguminous shrubs: Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala as well as the fodder grass Setaria splendida). On the agroforestry plots, crop management was in accordance with the principles of appropriate ("ecologic") agriculture, including practices such as mixed cropping, the use of green manure, composting, and integration of livestock. Comparative measurements were carried out on bare fallow and on "traditional farming" plots with monocropped cassava. With a mean annual precipitation of 1279 mm, a rainfall erosivity factor of R = 385, and a slope of 28 percent, high annual soil losses were recorded on the bare fallow plot (557 tons per hectare per year) as well as on the cassava plot (303 t·ha-1 · y-1). The high soil losses recorded on the Grevillea plot (111 t · ha-1 · y-1) demonstrate that the problem of accelerated erosion on steep slopes cannot be solved by simply planting trees and by introducing management practices that provide a a better ground cover for only part of the year. In contrast, on agroforestry plots with supplementary erosion control hedges, erosion rates lower than 12,5 t · ha-1 · y-1 were measured. Agroforestry systems that include the integration of leguminous perennials as contour hedges offer a promising method for soil conservation even on slopes threatened by severe erosion. © 1992.

AB  - The influence of simulated erosion on the abundance and activity of indigenous rhizobia was evaluated in an oxisol. Surface soil losses in excess of 15 cm were generally associated with significant decrease in the numbers of rhizobia nodulating Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania grandiflora, and Vigna unguiculata. Simulated erosion hampered nodulation, nitrogenase activity (but not specific nitrogenase activity), and dry matter accumulation even at imposed erosion levels that were not detrimental to rhizobial populations. The adverse effect of simulated erosion on the rhizobium-legume symbiosis, therefore, was not completely explainable in terms of loss of rhizobia. Total nutrient uptake values declined with increase in simulated erosion levels, and these values were better indicators of the impacts of simulated erosion on legume performance than tissue nutrient concentration values. We conclude that establishment of effective rhizobium-legume symbiosis on highly weathered eroded soils would require not only re-infestation of the soils with appropriate rhizobia, but also replenishing them with lost nutrients that are critical for the formation and function of effective symbiosis. © 1991 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The phytotoxicity of Leucaena leucocephala leaf leachate was evaluated using rice and a few tree species associated with agroforestry systems as test crops. The phytotoxicity of Leucaena leaf leachate differed according to the amount of mimosine present in it. The Leucaena leaf exposed to sunlight lost over 33-42% of total mimosine content. Among the three successive leaf extracts tested, the first extract showed an inhibitory effect, while the third extract exhibited a stimulatory effect on rice radicle growth. The effect of a second successive extract was inconsistent. The germination, radicle and root growth of Casuarina equisetifolia was severely inhibited by the 1% aqueous leaf extract from the Leucaena cultivar 'K 8'. However, the germination and radicle growth of different cultivars of Leucaena were least affected, and the allelopathic inhibition of Pongamia pinnata was of the second order. Among the tree species studied, Acacia nilotica was most tolerant to the phytotoxic effect of Leucaena leaf leachate. © 1992.

AB  - The increasing population in many parts of Uganda has led to increased tree cutting in order to open more land for agricultural production, but the planting of new trees by farmers is limited. In order for farmers to adopt land-use technologies based on tree planting, the basic needs of the farmers must be addressed. Land-use systems which combine agricultural crops with trees and shrubs and livestock may be a solution to this (ibid.), because trees can provide multiple uses to the farmers. The use of browse shrubs and fodder trees is now seen as a key way of supplementing animal feed. The objective of this paper is to give an overview of the nutritional value of a fodder tree, Leucaena leucocephala, and the ways in which it could be used on farmland and managed to provide forage and other outputs to farmers. -Author

AB  - The commonly practiced ground-level planting was compared with a moisture-conserving open-pit sunken planting technique in an attempt to test the success of modified planting techniques that enhance tree survival and early growth in arid environments. An indigenous species, Acacia mellifera (Vahl.) Benth., which is well adapted to the environmental conditions of the trial site, was used for the comparative study. Trial results showed that, after 21 months, height growth of seedlings planted in open pits was almost three times faster than that of seedlings planted at ground level. Total biomass production of open pit planted seedlings exceeded that of those planted at ground level by 78%. Shoot ÷ root ratios of biomass produced were 1 ÷ 1.07 in sunken plantings and 1 ÷ 1.43 in level planting, suggesting that roots of sunken planted seedlings support a higher above-ground biomass production. No mortalities occured in either of the two treatments because of the natural drought tolerance of A. mellifera. The highly significant differences in height growth performance suggested that this planting technique should be tested on other tree species on a larger scale. Accordingly, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit was used for a second, larger experiment. The results of this trial largely confirmed those of the preceding one. After 31 months, the increase in shoot length of seedlings planted in open pits was 50% higher than that of seedlings planted at ground level. However, total biomass production was only 13% higher for seedlings planted in open pits and no significant differences between the two treatments could be established. Nevertheless, there was a significant difference between the species' shoot-to-root ratios. This ratio was 1 ÷ 1.04, for the sunken planting treatment, compared to 1 ÷ 1.60 for level planting. Mortality among seedlings in the open pits was half that of the seedlings planted at ground level. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The chemical composition (nitrogen fractions, fibre components, phenolic compounds, neutral sugars and uronic acids) and rumen degradability of the dry matter (DMD) and neutral detergent fibre (NDFD) of six crop by-products (raw palm oil mill effluent (POME), dried POME, palm kernel cake, palm press fibre, cocoa pods and rice straw) and the leaves of two legumes (Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium) were measured. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to compare and classify the feeds according to chemical composition and degradability. Lignin poorly differentiated between feeds and was poorly related to 48 h DMD; the major anomalies were with rice straw and Gliricidia (low lignin, low DMD) and cocoa pods (high lignin, high DMD). The xylose: arabinose ratio, an indicator of hemicellulose digestion, was higher in the legumes than in the by-products. The ratio of rapidly degradable (arabinose + glucose) to slowly degradable (xylose + uronic acids) sugars was not a good indicator of cell wall digestion; the correlation with 48 h NDF degradability (NDFD) was only 0.69. Cluster analysis showed that conventional classification of the feeds into by-products and legumes did not reflect their compositional or degradability attributes. These attributes were also poorly related to each other. Two unusual feeds were identified, cocoa pods and palm kernel cake. © 1992.

AB  - The performance of growing beef steers grazing foggaged dryland Pennisetum clandestinum (kikuyu) pastures and given limited access (3 h d-1) to Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham (leucaena) was compared to that of steers grazing only kikuyu foggage during autumn and early winter. For three seasons (1988-1990) animals grazing leucaena performed better (P≤0.01) and gained 24.8 ± 3.01 kg per animal more, over 90 days, than those on kikuyu alone. Animal performance ranged from 0.62 to 0.09 kg d-1 on leucaena and from 0.26 to -0.21 kg d-1 on kikuyu. There were differences between seasons, but no Treatment by Season interaction (P>0.05), and these were attributed to the quantity of autumn rainfall because of its effect on the proportion of green leaf in the foggage. It is proposed that leucaena receive more detailed attention under grazing in southern Africa as a supplement to poor quality forage. The danger of leucaena becoming an invasive alien in the humid coastal regions must not be ignored. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - High α-cellulose pulp has been extracted from a fast growing plant material, namely Leucaena leucocephala. Acetylated products from this α-cellulose and from commercially available α-cellulose were prepared by a homogeneous acetylation procedure. The acetylated products were characterized using IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR techniques, and their molecular weights were determined. The thermal decomposition of the α-celluloses and their acetylated products were studied using thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis techniques in the range of room temperature to 600°C. Two major decomposition steps were identified, and the relative thermal stabilities of the α-celluloses and the acetylated products were assessed. The kinetic parameters for both the decomposition steps identified were estimated by four well known methods. IR spectra of the decomposed residue obtained after heating the cellulose at 200 and 450°C were also examined, to obtain an understanding of the decomposition pathway. © 1990.

AB  - Shoot material of Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena), Calliandra calothyrsus and Calliandra surinamensis was incubated for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h in nylon bags suspended in the rumen of a steer and losses of various components of the feed measured. Leucaena had much faster rates of loss of dry matter (DM), N, P and Ca. Leucaena had also a faster S loss than Calliandra calothyrsus, whereas C. surinamensis showed very high levels of soluble S. Loss of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) after 48 h was also far greater with leucaena than C. surinamensis (46.4% vs. 10.3%), whereas with C. calothyrsus there appeared to be an increase in NDF and ADF. For all species, acid detergent lignin (ADL) appeared to be higher than initial plant values throughout the period of incubation; markedly so for C. calothyrsus. The Calliandra spp. had high levels of silica and Al in their DM. Our findings and other published results, indicate that the Calliandra spp. investigated may not be a suitable alternative to leucaena as a ruminant feed. © 1992.

AB  - Seedlings of Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex. Benth., Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth., Gliricidia sepium (Jac.) Walp and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. were inoculated with an ectomycorrhizal (Boletus suillus (l. ex. Fr.) or indigenous vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi in a low P soil. The plants were subjected to unstressed (well-watered) and drought-stressed (water-stressed) conditions. In Gliricidia and Leucaena, both mycorrhizal inoculations stimulated greater plant growth, P and N uptake compared to their non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants under both watering regimes. However, in Acacia and Albizia, these parameters were only stimulated by either ectomycorrhiza (Acacia) or VA mycorrhiza (Albizia). Growth reduction occurred as a result of inoculation with the other type of mycorrhiza. This was attributed to competition for carbon between Acacia and VA mycorrhizas and parasitic association between Albizia and ectomycorrhiza. Drought-stressed mycorrhizal and NM Leucaena, and drought-stressed mycorrhizal Acacia tolerated lower xylem pressure potentials and larger water losses than the drought-stressed mycorrhizal and NM Albizia and Gliricidia. These latter plants avoided drought by maintaining higher xylem pressure potentials and leaf relative water content (RWC). All the four leguminous plants were mycorrhizal dependent. The higher the mycorrhizal dependency (MD), the lower the drought tolerance expressed in terms of drought response index (DRI). The DRI may be a useful determinant of MD, as they are inversely related. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - 1. The effect of including Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf meal (LLM) in broiler diets was investigated employing LLM at 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 g/kg diet. Experiments were also conducted to investigate whether reduced food intake of diets containing LLM is responsible for the growth depression.2. LLM appears to be a good source of protein and calcium.3. Food intake was not significantly affected (P>0⋅05) with dietary LLM inclusion up to 200 g/kg. 4. Inclusion of LLM up to 150 g/kg diet did not influence significantly (P>0⋅05) the performance of broilers in terms of body weight gain and food efficiency. However, inclusion of LLM at 200 g/kg diet had an adverse effect on weight gain and food efficiency, when compared to other dietary treatments. The profitability over food costs was low with the 200 g LLM/kg diet compared to those of other diets.5. It may be inferred from these experiments that LLM can safely be included in broiler diets up to 150 g/kg.6. Studies using force-feeding and restricted feeding techniques indicated that reduced food intake was not responsible for the growth depression in diets containing higher amounts of LLM. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Twenty-three provenances of Gliricidia sepium and eleven isolines of Leucaena leucocephala were examined at a low and at high phosphate levels (20 and 80 mg P kg-1 soil) for growth, phosphate (P) uptake and use efficiency. Large differences in growth at the low P level, and in growth response to the higher P rate occurred among L. leucocephala isolines and G. sepium provenances. Shoot dry weight at low P varied from 1.30 to 3.01 g plant-1 for L. leucocephala and from 1.44 to 3.07 g plant-1 for G. sepium. Leucaena isolines had only half the root weight of G. sepium provenances yet produced approximately 90% of the shoot weight of the corresponding G. sepium treatments, i.e. more than a 2-fold difference in root/shoot ratios. Total P in shoots of G. sepium was some 85% greater than of the respective L. leucocephala isolines in corresponding treatments. Physiological phosphate use efficiency (g shoot/mg P in shoots) (PPUE) was not a simple reciprocal relation, being markedly lower at higher shoot % P and content. However, for the same shoot P both species produced the same shoot weight. Nevertheless, there were apparent genotypic differences within species in the root development, shoot P and PPUE. In another study, the numbers of rhizobia in the rhizosphere of L. leucocephala, nodulation, N2 fixation at five different levels of P were determined. The numbers of rhizobia in the rhizosphere of inoculated L. leucocephala during the first two weeks were lower when P was added but later became similar to those without added P. Nodules formed earlier than inoculated plants fertilized with P and in greater numbers (4- to 5-fold) and dry weights than in those without P. However, the percentage of N2 derived from fixation did not change with increasing levels of P application. These results suggest that the observed P effect did not operate via stimulated growth of rhizobia in the rhizosphere, nor through increased N2 fixation rate. The major effect appeared to be due to effects via plant growth. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted at Gowa, S. Sulawesi, Indonesia, to assess the productivity of 4 tree legumes. The experiment consisted of an establishment phase of 6 months, a tree only phase of 8 months, followed by a tree/grass phase of 14 months. After the initial cutting to 1 m, trees were lopped to 1 m when they reached heights of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 m above the soil surface. Leaf production was unaffected by cutting at the various attainment heights. Over the 14 month establishment and tree phase, yields totalled 2 1.8 t DM ha-1 in leucaena, 19.2 t DM ha-1 in gliricidia, 18.2 t ha-1 in calliandra and 6.7 t ha-1 in sesbania, which did not survive cutting. Stem production increased as attainment height increased. Yield of the understorey grass (Panicum maximum cv. Riversdale) in the 14 month tree/grass phase was unaffected by tree attainment height and was highest in the grass monoculture plots (12.0 tha-1), and lowest under leucaena and gliricidia. Nitrogen yields totalled 103 kg ha-1 in the grass monoculture and 901 kg ha-l in the tree monoculture and tree/grass mixtures. There was little N transfer from the tree legume to the grass. © 1990 CSIRO. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - We examined the suitability of four reference crops, i.e., two non-fixing trees, Cassia siamea and Eucalyptus grandis, and two uninoculated fixing trees, Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia albida, for measuring fixed N2 fixed in inoculated L. leucocephala and A. albida grown for 36 weeks in pots. The15N isotope-dilution (involving the addition of equal amounts of labelled N fertilizer to the non-fixing and the fixing plants) and the A-value (with different amounts of labelled N fertilizer added to the fixing and the non-fixing crops) methods were used. The isotope dilution approach gave several large negative estimates of fixed N2 in A. albida. Positive and similar values of fixed N2 were measured in all four reference crops using the A-value approach. For L. leucocephala the isotope-dilution approach gave different estimates of fixed N2, with the different reference crops; the uninoculated N2-fixing crops indicated significantly less fixed N2 than the non-fixing reference crops. Similar values for N2 fixed in L. leucocephala were obtained using the two non-fixing trees, either by the isotope-dilution or the A-value method. On average, A. albida derived about twice as much N from fertilizer as L. leucocephala. In both species, the atom %15N excess declined by about 50% in successive harvests. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

An initial cellulolytic phase of 4 d was followed by an early and active methanogenic phases (5-21 d) and a terminal phase of low-rate methanogenesis. Hydrolysis of cellulose was concentration-dependent and resulted in increased volatile acid levels. The trend of changes showed some variations at different input volatile solids. The changes in the levels of volatile acids followed an oscillatory pattern. The controlled rate of cellulose hydrolysis, levels of volatile acids, and steady-state levels of soluble carbohydrates and reducing sugars observed during active methanogenesis are indicative of interactive metabolic regulations. © 1990 Humana Press Inc.

AB  - The effects of respective concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), methylmethacrylate (MMA) and Leucaena glauca seed gum (LGG) on the graft copolymerization of LGG-MMA have been studied by evaluating the rates of total polymerization (ktp), homopolymerization (kh) and graft copolymerization (kg) at different reaction times. The study shows that the grafting depends greatly upon the rate influencing factors. The grafted products have been characterized by infra-red sepctroscopy and thermogravimetry along with the usual methods based on grafting parameters. The optimum grafting conditions derived from the investigation at 85°C are: H2O2 concentration 10 mM litre-1, a backbone to monomer concentration ratio of 0·20 for 120 min, which yielded nearly 48% of grafting. © 1991.

AB  - In the coastal zone of Benin K and P deficiencies are a common phenomena in reforestated Eucalyptus camaldulensis as well as in young stands of Casuarina equisetifolia (filao) even with initial fertilization during planting. Mineral disorders (N/K-ratios of about 10) were also described for Leucaena leucocephala used in alley cropping trials. Special attention was focused on the development of deficiency symptoms of young filao, on which red leaves are an advanced stage of leaf yellowing. This phenomenon is induced by N-, P- and K-deficiency. Due to the small CEC of the sandy soils fertilization with (NP)K may quickly enhance Mg-deficiency, as shown for coconut with foliar levels of only 0.03-0.05% Mg. To get a better understanding of these relationships fertilization trials were started. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Pot and field experiments were conducted in the greenhouse and at three field sites (Marondera, Domboshawa and Makoholi) in Zimbabwe to examine the effects of soils and fertilizers on nutrient uptake and growth of 6 exotic tree species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. grandis, E. tereticornis, Leucaena leucocephala, Casuarina cunninghamiana, and Acacia holosericea). Plant growth, N and P contents of all species were increased by the application of N, P, K and micronutrient fertilizers. The effect of individual nutrients (N, P, K and micronutrients) and their combination on Eucalyptus species was further investigated in a pot experiment using soil from Domboshawa. Eucalyptus species responded only to N application and no significant interactions were found between N and the other elements. Nutrient uptake results showed that E. camaldulensis and E. tereticornis removed more cations than the N-fixing trees but only in the fertilized treatments. L. leucocephala and C. cunninghamiana were higher in P, but no clear trends were observed for N. Plant growth and nutrient uptake by E. camaldulensis. C. cunninghamiana and A. holosericea were assessed in the field at the three sites. Plant species grown in the Marondera site had greater height and diameter at breast height (DBH) than those in the two other sites. These results followed trends in soil nutrient contents. The analysis of foliage revealed differences in the nutrient concentration of leaves from different trees, but no effect of site was found. The interrelationships between plant characteristics, soil and foliage nutrients were examined. In a pot experiment, mineral N was the only variable correlated with growth response and nutrient uptake, while in the field the only significant correlation was obtained with soil pH. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Confined West African Dwarf sheep and goats were offered chopped fresh Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham (leucaena) leaves at levels of 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80% in a diet with chopped fresh Panicum maximum (guinea grass) over a period of 16 weeks to measure intake, apparent digestibility and growth. Leucaena forage depressed intake of feed by both species, and goats consumed less than sheep. Dry matter intake was 39.6, 35.1, 33.9, 33.7 and 27.0 g/kg0.75 for goats on 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80% leucaena diets, respectively. The corresponding values for sheep up to the 60% diet were 69.3, 67.3, 64.8 and 58.4 g/kg0.75. At six weeks, the health of sheep on the 80% leucaena diet deteriorated seriously and they were removed from the treatment. The overall growth rate improved by up to 40% for sheep (59.3 g/day) on addition of leucaena to the diet and 60% for goats (33.1 g/day). Sheep grew faster than goats (53.4 vs. 28.4 g/day). Dry matter (DM) digestibility of the diet rose with increasing level of leucaena and goats digested DM more extensively than sheep (61.8 vs. 56.1%). Digestibility of other feed components followed the same pattern as that of DM. It is suggested that to promote growth without adverse effects, leucaena should not comprise more than 40% and 60% of the diets of West African Dwarf sheep and goats, respectively, or less than 1.0 g mimosine/kg0.75. © 1991.

The treatments were 0, 4, 8, and 12t Leucaena ha-1 with 0,44, and 88 kg N ha-1 as urea in a factorial combination. N uptake was evaluated at maximum tillering, panicle initiation, and harvest. The incorporation of Leucaena increased N uptake throughout the vegetative period in both seasons, irrespective of the mineral-N level. At all levels of N, the grain yield increased significantly following the incorporation of Leucaena, and in both seasons the Leucaena treatment of 8 t ha-1 was almost as effective as the highest mineral-N application. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The level of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) infection in the roots of Leucaena grown in a sand-soil mixture in the greenhouse increased rapidly with time and reached a peak value of 84% at 30 days from planting. The pattern of immobile nutrient uptake and accumulation closely paralleled that of the development of infection, particularly during the first 10-30 days after planting. Significant changes in dry matter yield were also observed only after a significant portion of the root length was colonized by Glomus aggregatum. The development of VAM infection was not accompanied by growth depression at any of the sampling periods. However, VAM roots had very high levels of Cu which was not translocated to shoots. It is hypothesized that such a diversion of Cu by the endophyte from the host could cause growth depression under conditions where the soil volume is supplied with sub-optimal levels of Cu. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A series of nutrient rate experiments was conducted in pots at the University of Queensland, St. Lucia, to determine the critical concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, and S for deficiency, and of Mn for toxicity, in youngest fully expanded leaves of Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunnningham. The P, Ca and Mn experiments were conducted using both NH4NO3 and Rhizobium inoculation as the source of nitrogen, while the K experiment was studied with both NaH2PO4 and Ca(H2PO4)2 as the source of basal P. Least squares derived response functions were fitted to data from each experiment to link growth and nodulation with the critical concentrations in youngest fully expanded leaves and with the rate of nutrient application required to produce 90% of maximum yield. These were: N, 4.1% and 645 kg ha-1; P, 0.25% and 225 kg ha-1 for inoculated plants, 0.2 1% and 250 kg ha-1 for N-supplied plants; K, 2.0±/0 and 35 kg ha-1 for Ca(H2PO4)2-supplied plants, 2.0% and 180 kg ha-1 for NaH2PO4-supplied plants; Ca, 0.49% and 225 kg ha-1 for inoculated plants, 0.38% and 160 kg ha-1 for N-supplied plants; S, 0.24% and 40 kg ha-1; Mn, 325 mg kg-1 and 35 kg ha-1 for inoculated plants, 325 mg kg-1 and 55 kg ha-1 for N-supplied plants. © 1989 CSIRO.

AB  - Young leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit) and gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq) Steud) alley-cropped with food crops on farmers' fields in southwestern Nigeria showed marked variability in growth and foliage coloration. A field study was undertaken to determine whether variability in soil fertility was responsible for the differential growth of the two tree species. Plant height of leucaena and gliricidia at 6 and 9 months after planting (MAP) were significantly correlated with soil organic C and total N. Dry matter yield at 12 MAP was also significantly correlated with plant height, soil organic C and total N for leucaena but not for gliricidia.

AB  - A field study was conducted for six years (1981-1986) on sandy loam soil on intercropping hedgerows of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit. with three field crops viz. maize (Zea mays L), black gram (Vigna mungo L) and cluster bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba L Taub.). In treatments 1 and 2 Leucaena hedges were planted as pure crops at close (25 cm × 75 cm) and wide (25 cm × 375 cm) spacings. In treatments 3, 4 and 5 the three field crops were intercropped between the hedgerows of Leucaena at the wide spacing, and in treatments 6, 7 and 8 the field crops were raised as pure crops. Leucaena was topped to 75 cm each time it attained a height of 175 cm. The pure crop of Leucaena at close spacing produced an average, over the six years, of 34 t ha-1a-1 of green fodder and 9.4 t ha-1a-1 of air dry fuelwood. The Leucaena at wide spacing produced 18.9 t ha-1a-1 of green fodder and 6.3 t ha-1a-1 of fuelwood. Intercropping with field crops decreased the yield of green fodder and fuelwood. The yield of all the field crops was less when raised as intercrops than as pure crops. Mean maximum net returns were obtained from intercrops of Leucaena and cluster bean (Rs 3540 ha-1a-1) which were significantly higher than the returns from pure crop of Leucaena at wide spacing but similar to the returns from pure crops of cluster bean. Leucaena with maize (Rs 3273 ha-1a-1) and black gram (Rs 3125 ha-1a-1) gave significantly higher net returns over pure crops of Leucaena at wide spacing, maize and black gram.

AB  - Phosphate mining in Florida yields waste products of phosphatic clay and quartz sand tailings, each making up about one-third of the original matrix (PO4 ore, sand, and clay). Phosphatic clay ponds typically occupy about 50% of the mined sites and normally require 10 to 15 yr before 40 to 50% solids are obtained. These clays contain no phytotoxic materials and are high in most plant nutrients. When surface water has disappeared, these clays are classified as clayey Haplaquents. A split-plot field experiment was conducted to study biomass yield, quality, plant nutrient concentrations, changes in soil nutrients, and 226Ra. Seven biomass crops-(i) elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum L, 'PI 300086'), (ii) leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wet], (iii) alemangrass [Echinochloa polystachya (H.B.K.) Hitche], (iv) erianthus [Erianthus arundinaceum (Retz) Jesw 'IK 76-63'], (v) desmodium (Desmodium cinerascens A. Gray), (vi) sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench 'USDA M 81E'], and (vii) forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench 'Pioneer 931'] - were grown on the phosphatic clay with and without a 5-cm surface layer of quartz sand tailings. Nitrogen was the only fertilizer element applied for grass species and no fertilizer was applied for legumes during the 4-yr period. Dry biomass yield averaged over 4 yr for erianthus, leucaena, and elephantgrass averaged 139.6, 58.5, and 56.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Crude protein and digestibility were low in mature, whole-plant samples except for leucaena (122.0 g kg-1). Generally, all whole plants contained adequate concentrations of nutrients averaging (g kg-1) P, 2.05; K, 11.5; Ca, 4.3; Mg, 2.77 and (mg kg-1) Cu, 4.0; Zn, 26; Fe, 68; and Mn, 35. Mehlich-I-extractable soil nutrient concentrations changes little over the 4-yr period. Radium-226 concentration in plant tissue (0.23 pCi g-1) was nearly six times higher than the concentration measured in plants from an unmined surface Spodosol (0.04 pCi g-1). Data indicate that these present-day waste lands can be a valuable resource for biomass production.; A split-plot field experiment was conducted to study biomass yield, quality, plant nutrient concentrations, changes in soil nutrients, and 226Ra. Seven biomass crops were grown on the phosphatic clay with and without a 5-cm surface layer of quartz sand tailings.

AB  - A phosphorus sorption curve was developed to evaluate the influence of established levels of soil solution P on the development of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) activity in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit grown on soilr: sand mixture. The P sorption curve developed after nutrient amendment and wetting and drying treatments in the greenhouse predicted levels of P established in the soil solution more accurately than P sorption isotherm developed in the laboratory. VAM activity measured in terms of P content of pinnules of Leucaena was significantly higher at lower soil solution P levels (0.01 and 0.02 mg/L) than at higher levels. In general, VAM activity declined after reaching a peak value at 30 days after planting (DAP). Soil solution P levels monitored during the course of the experiment indicated that low initial P levels (0.01 and 0.02 mg/L) were readily maintained than higher ones. The proposed approach is thus appropriate for establishing soil solution P levels that permit optimal VAM activity. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mutant strain ANU2861, a transposon Tn5 mutant of the fast-growing, broad-host-range Rhizobium strain ANU280 (NGR234 Smr Rfr) overproduces polysaccharide, is an ade auxotroph, and induces poorly developed nodules on Leucaena leucocephala and Lablab purpureus (H.C. Chen, M. Batley, J.W. Redmond, and B.G. Rolfe, J. Plant Physiol. 120:331-349, 1985). Strain ANU2861 cannot form nodules on Macroptilium atropurpureum Urb. (siratro) or on Desmodium intortum and D. uncinatum and the nonlegume Parasponia. The parent strain, ANU280, effectively nodulates all these legume species except Parasponia, on which it forms ineffective nodules. Ultrastructural examination of infection sites on the legume siratro showed that mutant strain ANU2861 caused root hair curling (Hac+ phenotype), some cortical cell division (Noi+), but no infection threads (Inf-). Localized cellular responses, known to occur in phytopathological interactions, were observed in electron micrographs of the epidermal tissue at or near the infection zone after inoculation with strain ANU2861 but not the wild-type parental strain. These include (i) the rapid (within 20 h) accumulation of osmiophilic droplets attached to membranes at potential sites of strain ANU2861 penetration and (after 48 h) in the epidermal cells in the immediate region of the curled root hairs, and (ii) localized cell death of the epidermal cells. In addition, strain ANU2861 can initiate a systemic response in split-root siratro plants which prevents the successful nodulation of strain ANU280. A 6.3-kilobase fragment of wild-type genomic DNA, which includes the site of Tn5 insertion in strain ANU2861, was cloned and introduced to strain ANU2861. All the phenotypic defects of the mutant strain were corrected by the introduction of this DNA fragment. This indicates that the original Tn5 insertion is responsible for the phenotype.

AB  - Goats of 18 months of age and 22 kg live weight (LW) were fed ad libitum Leucaena leucocephala of 2, 6 and 10 weeks regrowth supplemented with 0.0 (control) or 20.0 g kg-1 LW day-1 of dehydrated palm oil mill effluent (POME) for 8 weeks. On control diets, Leucaena intake was 25.8, 22.8 and 23.8 g dry matter (DM) kg-1 LW day-1; DM digestibility (DMD) was 65.1, 57.0 and 53.1%, and neutral detergent fibre digestibility (FD) was 59.6, 53.5 and 52.7%, respectively for 2, 6 and 10 weeks regrowth. Supplementary POME depressed Leucaena intake but significantly increased total intake for all regrowths. Replacement rates were 0.54, 0.36 and 0.31, respectively, for the 2, 6 and 10 weeks regrowth. Supplementary POME increased DMD and FD; the increases were higher for the mature regrowths of lower DMD. The coefficients of intake and digestibility were significantly correlated and multivariate statistical procedures were also used in the analysis of the data. Differences between regrowths were not significant (P > 0.05) when both coefficients of intake and digestibility were included in the analysis. Significance (P < 0.05) was achieved with digestibility coefficients, DMD contributing more to the observed differences than FD. Supplementation with POME had a significant effect (P < 0.001) on both sets of coefficients measured. Intake contributed most to the difference between control and supplemented diets.

AB  - Soil infiltrability was evaluated once a year for five consecutive years in a longterm agroforestry experiment established on an Alfisol in western Nigeria. There were 6 treatments involving plow-till, no-till, contour hedges of Leucaena Leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium established every 4- and 2-m intervals. Continuous cultivation based on 2 crops per year caused drastic reductions in infiltrability in all treatments. The rate of decline was, however, the most severe in no-till treatment. Following 5 years of continuous cultivation, the equilibrium infiltration rate was 8, 19, 21 and 24 cm/h for no-till, Gliricidia-based, plow-till and Leucaena-based treatments, respectively. The cumulative infiltration at 2 h was 24, 59, 70 and 76 cm for no-till, Gliricidia-based, Leucaena-based and plow-till treatments. There were also significant differences among treatments in relation to soil water sorptivity (S). The infiltration data were expressed in terms of Philip's and Kostiakov's infiltration models. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The symbiotic effectiveness of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi present in widely differring tropical soils was evaluated in a greenhouse experiment. Small volumes of field soil, a standard inoculum (Glomus aggregatum) or both were introduced into a fumigated sand-soil medium amended with nutrients for optimum VAM activity. Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit var. K8 was grown in the medium as an indicator plant. VAM effectiveness was monitored as a function of time by determining the P status of pinnules. The soils differed from each other with respect to the time their endophytes required for the expression of initial and maximum effectiveness and in the level of maximum effectiveness they exhibited. The effect of mycorrhizal inoculation, calculated as the ratio of the areas enclosed by the effectiveness curve of G. aggregatum to that enclosed by the effectiveness curves of test soils, was found to be a good indicator of the response of L. leucocephala to inoculation of soils with G. aggregatum © 1989 Springer-Verlag.

Conversion factors have been calculated from the amino acid data to facilitate the conversion of Kjeldahl nitrogen values to protein contents; the factors are considerably higher than that assumed in an earlier study of Leucaena gum. The data confirm and extend the previous indication that Leucaena gum has a strongly negative specific rotation, with sugar and amino acid compositions that are similar to those of commercial gum arabic [Acacia Senegal (L.)

Exotic species such as Grevillea robusta, Sesbania grandiflora, Leucaena leucocephala, Cassia siamea and Sesbania sesban, some of which were outside their traditional climatic zones, had higher diameters, heights and bole volumes/tree (upto 130% more in certain cases) than of the indigenous species. However, poor performance of several species (both exotic and indigenous) would limit their agroforestry potentials at the evaluation site or other similar areas. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Worm casts and the corresponding surface soils were collected in an Ultisol at Onne (south-eastern Nigeria) under a cover of Pueraria phaseoloides and on Alfisols at Ibadan (south-western Nigeria) under Leucaena leucocephala, under Treculia africana and in a secondary forest. The biological and physico-chemical properties of these samples were assessed. Worm casts composed of finer soil particles had higher pH values, higher mineral element concentrations and more water-stable aggregates than the corresponding soils. Their higher humic acid (HA) fulvic acid (FA) contents, and HA: FA ratio, suggested that worm casting activity accelerates the humification process. Numbers of denitrifying microorganisms or cowpea rhizobia were the same in both casts and soils from each site, but worm casts contained more nitrifiers, had a larger biomass-C content and a higher percent of stress-labile N than the corresponding soils. Enzyme activities were also higher in casts than they were in the corresponding topsoils. Granular casts had similar properties as turret-shaped casts collected at the same site. In general, no microbiological and enzymatic differences were found among samples of casts or soils from different sites, but soil and the corresponding casts collected under T. africana were relatively low in organic-C, total N, mineral N, fulvic and humic acids, biomass-C content, nitrifiers and acid phosphatase activity. © 1989.

AB  - A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate “liming” potential of different green manures. Ground leafy materials of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), leucaena (Leucaena 7eucocephala) and guinea grass (Panicum maximum) were added at 0, 5, 10 and 20 g/kg to an Ultisol having a soil-water pH 4.0, KC1-extractable A1 = 7.6 cmo1c/kg, Al saturation = 50% and soil-solution Al = 2.2 mM. Treatments with Ca(OH)2were established for comparison. Sesbania cochinchinensis, an A1-sensitive tree legume, was grown for 4 weeks as a test crop. Biomass production and chemical composition of the soil indicated that (i) cowpea and leucaena were more effective than guinea grass in detoxifying Al; for example, the additions of 10 g manure per kg soil were equivalent to 1.8 cmol(OH)/kg for guinea grass, 3.4 for cowpea and 4.2 for leucaena (at least on a short-term basis), (ii) reduction of soluble Al at increased pH as a result of manure additions was the major mechanism for Al detoxification, and (iii) complexation of soluble Al by organic molecules also contributed to the detoxification.

AB  - Seventeen provenances of 14 predominantly leguminous tree and shrub species were evaluated for forage and fuelwood production over a thirty month period at Khon Kaen, Northeast Thailand. When cut at a 1 m height five times during the experimental period, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Cassia siamea, Gmelina arborea and Leucaena leucocephala gave the highest yields of edible material with accumulated dry matter production of over 2 kg per tree. These same species also gave high yields of woody stem, which has value as firewood in the region. Mortality of the more productive species was low but others, such as Sesbartia sesban, S. grandiflora and S. formosa, suffered almost 100%mortality in this monsoonal environment under these management conditions. The leaf of Sesbartia sesban was the most digestible of all species with an in vitro dry matter digestibility of 79%. The leaves of all other species except Calliandra calothyrsus had digestibilities greater than 50%with most in the range 60-65%. The crude protein content of the leaf material of the species tested ranged from 13%to 28%. The other species tested were Adenanthera pavonia, Albizia chinensis, A. falcataria, A. lebbek, Pithocello- bium dulce, and Samanea saman. © 1989 A B Academic Publishers-Printed in Great Britain.

AB  - Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus) was intercropped for 3 seasons between hedgerows of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) spaced 3 or 5 m apart on an infertile soil at Mt Cotton, south-eastern Queensland. The leucaena was cut at a height of25 or 50 cm, 2 or 4 times per season and the fresh material spread as a mulch between the rows of kenaf. The yield of kenaf from mulched plots was compared with that from plots fertilised with nitrogen as urea at 0, 50 or 100 kg N/ha.year. In the third season, kenaf yield from the mulched plots was maintained at about 4.7 t DM/ha, whereas that from the control and urea fertilised plots declined by about 30%. However, phosphorus deficiency in the unmulched plots was suspected and this may have contributed to the lower yield. Leucaena row spacing had no significant effect on kenaf yield. Leucaena yield ranged from 2 to 4 t DM/ha per season. Cutting height had no significant effect on leucaena yield, but less frequent pruning gave a higher yield in the second and third seasons. The results confirm the potential of alley cropping to sustain arable crop yield at a moderate level without high inputs of inorganic fertilisers. © 1988 CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - The amount of nitrogen fixed by Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit was assessed on an Alfisol at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture located in southwestern Nigeria. Estimated by the difference method, nitrogen fixation of leucaena inoculated with Rhizobium strain IRc 1045 was 133 kg ha-1 in six months. Inoculation with Rhizobium strain IRc 1050 gave a lower nitrogen fixation of 76 kg ha-1. Fertilization with 40 and 80 kg N ha-1 inhibited nitrogen fixation by 43-76% and 49-71%, respectively. Estimates with the15N dilution method gave nitrogen fixation of 134 kg ha-1 in six months when leucaena was inoculated with Rhizobium strain IRc 1045 and 98 kg ha-1 for leucaena inoculated with Rhizobium strain IRc 1050. This nitrogen fixation represented 34-39% of the plant nitrogen. Inoculated leucaena derived 5-6% of its nitrogen from applied fertilizer and 56-54% from soil. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Experiments were made on a 2-yr old Leucaena leucocephala stand to measure the litterfall and decomposition rates. Annual litterfall was 10 t ha-1 and was maximal in the dry summer months (≈50% of total litterfall). The seasonal peaks were in June and December (15 and 11% of total litterfall, respectively). Leaves comprised 88% of the total litterfall. Litter decomposition in the field was examined using leaf, twig and fruit fractions of above-ground litter. Roots were also studied for loss of mass and N release below-ground. Loss of mass was in the order fruit > root > twig > leaf. The inital mass loss was high and there was rapid loss in the rainy season (July-September). Annual above-ground litter N content was high (256 kg ha-1) with an annual release of 208 kg ha-1 i.e. 81% of the total litterfall. N release from litter per unit area was leaves (13.2gm-2), fruits (10.5 gm-2), twigs (4.4g m-2) and roots (3.4g m-2). Litter decomposition and N release from the decomposing litter was dependent on the C-N ratio and environmental factors. N turnover time was < 1 yr for all litter fractions. © 1990.

AB  - This paper reports on the use of three leguminous perennials (Leucaena leucocephala, Flemingia macrophylla and Gliricidia sepium) as live support systems in yam cultivation. In a planting arrangement in which yam rows alternated with rows of the woody species the tuber yields per ha were 3.4 (leucaena), 5.3 (flemingia) and 10.1 (gliricidia) ton fresh weight. TUKEY's L.S.D. value equalled 2.9 ton. Leucaena leucocephala is unsuitable as live support since the species shows a strong competitive power expressed in terms of leaf productivity and relative density of the root mass in the upper soil stratum, the zone explored by the yam crop. Flemingia macrophylla is unsuitable as support species mainly because of its structural weakness: Its branches do not sufficiently lignify to carry the yam leaf mass. The significantly higher tuber yield of the yam crop grown with Gliricidia sepium is a function of specific properties of the tree species: Low leaf productivity, a relatively weakly developed root system and an open architecture, which leaves sufficient space for a yam crop grown in association. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Wood properties of Eucalyptus urophylla and two varieties of Leucaena leucocephala (vars. K8 and K72), were analyzed at the wood laboratory of the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce forest reserve of Linhares in Espirito Santo, Brazil. The material was collected from a species mixture experiment which was clear felled at age 7 years. As the two major end uses for wood in the region are pulp and charcoal, the wood properties were analyzed in two groups: (a) physical and chemical properties of the wood; (b) conversion yields and properties of charcoal. There were no significant differences in wood properties between trees of a given species or variety grown in pure stands and mixtures. The only significant differences observed were between eucalypt and leucaena wood. Eucalypt wood had a lower basic density and higher moisture content than that of leucaena. Eucalypt wood had less ash and extractives but a higher lignin content and there were no significant differences in holocellulose content. The percentage conversion to charcoal was higher in eucalypt wood and the analysis of dry charcoal revealed no significant differences in the content of volatiles or fixed carbon but eucalypt charcoal had one third of the ash content of leucaena charcoal. © 1989 A B Academic Publishers-Printed in Great Britain.

AB  - Field runoff plots, 70 x 10 m each, were established on a tropical Alifisol in southwestern Nigeria to monitor water runoff, soil erosion and nutrient loss in water runoff. The non-agroforestry control treatment (A) was established at two levels: plow-till and no-till systems of seedbed preparation. There were two agroforestry systems based on contour hedgerows of (B) Leucaena leucocephala and (C) Gliricidia sepium established at 4-m and 2-m spacings. Field plots were established in 1982 and hydrological measurements were made for uniform maize-cowpea rotation for 12 consecutive growing seasons from 1982 through 1987. Once established hedgerows of Leucaena at 2-m spacing were extremely effective in reducing water runoff and controlling erosion. Runoff, erosion and nutrient losses were generally more from maize grown in the first season than from cowpea grown in the second. Mean seasonal erosion from maize was 4.3, 0.10, 0.57, 0.10, 0.64 and 0.60 t/ha for plow-till, no-till, Leucaena-4m, Leucaena-2m, Gliricidia-2m treatments, respectively. Mean runoff in the first season from treatments listed in the order above was 17.0, 1.3, 4.9, 3.3, 4.3, and 2.4 percent of the rainfall received. There were high losses of Ca and K in water runoff from the plow-till treatment. In contrast to runoff and erosion, losses of bases in water runoff from agroforestry treatments were relatively high, high concentration of bases in runoff was probably due to nutrient recycling by the deep-rooted perennials. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Allelopathic compounds, including fatty acids, phenolics, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids, have been found in various plants and soils of different habitats in Taiwan since 1972. For example, in a monoculture of rice plants, phytotoxins were produced during the decomposition of rice residues in soil, suppressed the growth of rice seedlings, and reduced the numbers of tillers and panicles, leading to yield reduction. The allelopathic metabolites are also affected by environmental factors, such as oxygen, temperature, soil moisture, microbial activity, and levels of fertilizers in soil, and allelopathy was pronounced in areas where environmental stresses were severe. Substantial amounts of phytotoxic mimosine and phenolics were released into soil by plant parts of Leucaena leucocephala, and these suppressed the growth of many understory species except that of L. leucocephala itself. A unique pattern of absence of understory plants was ubiquitous beneath Phyllostachys edulis, due primarily to an allelopathic effect. In a forest pasture intercropping, an aggressive kikuyu grass was planted in a deforested land where Chinese fir grew previously, to help in understanding the mechanism of biological interactions between plants. Aqueous soil leachate and extracts of the grass significantly, retarded the growth of local weeds but not that of the Chinese fir. Allelopathy thus plays an appreciable role in natural vegetation and plantations in Taiwan. © 1989 Academia.

AB  - Soil physical properties were measured on field runoff plots established on a tropical Alfisol in Western Nigeria. Evolution of soil physical properties was assessed over a period of 6 years beginning in 1982 (when soil was cleared off its secondary regrowth) till 1987. Changes in soil physical properties were measured for six systems including plow-till, no-till, contour hedgerows of Leucaena leucocephala established 2- and 4-m apart, and contour hedgerows of Gliricidia sepium established 2- and 4-m apart. Soil physical properties were measured once every year during the dry season following the harvest of second season crops. Over the 6-year period, there were no significant differences in relative contents of textural separates of sand, silt and clay for the surface 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers. The gravel concentration of the surface 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers, however, increased significantly due to plowing and mixing of the surface and subsoil layers. Soil bulk density of 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers, respectively, increased in all treatments from initial values of 1.02 and 1.16 g cm-3 in 1982 to 1.43 and 1.65 g cm-3 at the end of cropping cycle in 1986. The maximum increase in soil bulk density was observed for the no-till treatment. Accordingly, there was an increase in penetration resistance of the surface 0-5 cm layer from an average value of 25.3 kPa in 1982 to 210.7 kPa in 1986. The highest penetration resistance (353 kPa) of 5-10 cm layer was recorded for the no-till treatment. In accord with total porosity, the gravimetric soil moisture retention at zero suction was the lowest for the no-till and the highest for a Gliricidia-based system. There were significant improvements in available water capacity (AWC) of the soil by both Leucaena and Gliricidia-based systems. In comparison with the no-till system, increase in AWC by Leucaena- and Gliricidia-based systems, respectively, was 42 and 56 percent by weight for 0-5 cm depth and 12 and 58 percent by weight for 5-10 cm depth. Alterations in pF curves by agroforestry-based systems were attributed to improvements in soil structure and structural porosity. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Four treatments were hay only (H), hay and 100 g leucaena (HL1), hay and 200 g leucaena (HL2) and hay plus leucaena ad libitum (HL3) in the growth study; and hay only (H), hay and 100 g leucaena (HL1), hay and 200 g leucaena (HL2) and leucaena only (L) in the digestibility study. Supplemented goats had higher growth rates (P<0.001). Daily gains were 20, 23, 29 and 30 g for animals on treatments H, HL1, HL2 and HL3, respectively. Leucaena leucocephala supplementation increased total dry matter intake from 42.3 g/kg W0.75 in the control group (H) to 77.9 g/kg W0.75 in HL3 (P<0.001). Crude protein digestibility increased with higher levels of leucaena in the diet (P<0.001). Apparent digestibility of crude fibre was depressed with increased leucaena supplementation. Digestibility coefficients for treatments H, HL1, HL2 and L were 23.1, 55.2, 55.1 and 62.3 in trial 1 and 35.2, 49.3, 58.9 and 62.0 in trial 2 for crude protein; and 61.4, 60.9, 55.9 and 54.7 in trial 1 and 69.5, 59.1, 62.9 and 40.3 in trial 2 for crude fibre, respectively. Water intake and daily nitrogen retention increased with leucaena levels. Supplemented goats in HL1, HL2 and L retained 1.8, 3.5 and 9.6 g/day nitrogen compared to goats in H which were in negative nitrogen balance. © 1990.

AB  - Rhizobium strains isolated from Leucaena leucocephala. Sesbania rostrata, S. grandiflora, S. punctata, Tephrosia vogelii. Acacia albida and Vigna unguiculata growing in Nigerian soils were characterized and tested for their ability to nodulate and fix atmospheric nitrogen with L. leucocephala. Isolates from L. leucocephala, S. rostrata. S. grandiflora and S. punctata were fast-growing and acid producers whereas those from A. albida, T. vogelii and V. unguiculata were slow-growing and alkali producers. Some of these isolates grew in the presence of 500 μg streptomycin ml-1. The effectivity of the rhizobia isolates on L. leucocephala was tested in Leonard jars. Isolates from all plant species except those from S. grandiflora and V. unguiculata nodulated L. leucocephala but a wide range of effectiveness was observed. Based on this experiment the ten most promising rhizobia were screened for effectiveness in potted soils collected at IITA, Ibadan (transition forest savanna), and at Fashola (savanna, 70 km north of IITA). Establishment of L. leucocephala was poor in soils without previous history of L. leucocephala cultivation due to the presence of only few native leucaena rhizobia (< 1000 g-1 soil). Rhizobium isolates IRc 1045 and IRc 1050 obtained from L. leucocephala grown at Fashola and IITA were found to be the most effective rhizobia on this host. In addition to their effectiveness and competitiveness they survived well in the field 1 year after their establishment. © 1989.

AB  - In order to assess the possibility of root competition in agroforestry, the vertical distribution of fine roots (< 2 mm in diameter) of five tree species in pure two-year-old stands was compared to that of mature maize. Cassia siamea, Eucalyptus tereticornis, Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis chilensis had a rooting pattern similar to that of maize, i.e. a slow decline in fine root mass from 0-100 cm soil depth. Eucalyptus camaldulensis had its roots evenly distributed down to 100 cm. On an average, the fine root biomass of the tree species was roughly twice as that of the maize. We conclude that the studied tree species are likely to compete with maize and other crops with a similar rooting pattern for nutrients and water. © 1988 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.

AB  - Thirty-three isolates of indigenous Rhizobium meliloti, either possessing cryptic plasmids that hybridize to probes for symbiotic genes or lacking a 1500-kb megaplasmid band in Eckhardt gels, were tested for infectivity on 10 legume species grown under axenic conditions. A previous study had shown that all but two isolates were symbiotically effective with Medicago sativa. All indigenous isolates and two reference strains of R. meliloti induced nodules which were symbiotically ineffective on Trigonella foenum-graecum (100% plants nodulated) and Phaseolus vulgaris (40 to 100% plants nodulated). Eighteen indigenous isolates of R. meliloti elicited ineffective nodules on Macroptilium atropurpureum (2 to 25% plants nodulated) and Leucaena leucocephala (11 to 75% plants nodulated). The identity of single colony nodule isolates from each R. meliloti inoculant and host combination was verified by phage typing and analysis of plasmid profiles; tests with subsamples of these isolates showed that all were capable of nodulating M. sativa. There was no apparent relationship between the host range of indigenous R. meliloti and either the presence of cryptic plasmids that hybridize to probes for symbiotic genes or the absence of a megaplasmid band in Eckhardt gels. The data suggest that nodulation promiscuity may be a relatively common characteristic of R. meliloti.

AB  - Trees of Casuarina equisetifolia, Albizia procera, Eucalyptus robusta, and two varieties of Leucaena leucocephala (an exotic and a native) were grown for maximum biomass production under the same climatic (1102 mm mean annual rainfall and 25°C mean annual air temperature) and edaphic conditions in the Lajas Valley of Puerto Rico (lat. 18°N., long. 67°W.). Management was intensive during early growth and establishment phases. Rates of large-branch/stem production (diameter ≥ 2.5 cm) at age 5.5 years were 27.8, 20.4, 10.1, 7.7, and 5.5 t ha-1 year-1 for Casuarina, Albizia, Eucalyptus, exotic Leucaena, and native Leucaena, respectively. Stemwood biomass production of 40 tropical tree plantations established elsewhere for biomass production averaged 7.9 t ha-1 year-1. Species ranking in terms of total above-ground biomass and litter accumulation followed the same order. At age 5.5 years, the litter accumulation in plantations was (in the sale order): 16.2, 10.2, 11.8, 7.0, and 6.5 t ha-1. Thirty-five natural tropical forest stands averaged 6 t ha-1. Intensive management of fertile soils increases biomass yield of energy plantations, but not all species respond equally well to such treatments. © 1990.

AB  - The influence of simulated erosion on the abundance and activity of indigenous vesiculararbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) populations was evaluated in an Oxisol. Surface-soil losses in excess of 7.5 cm were generally associated with significant decreases in the numbers of total and active VAM propagules and in the symbiotic effectiveness of the active propagules. Surface-soil removal not exceeding 7.5 cm was associated with decreased propagule abundance without adverse effects on VAM colonization of roots and symbiotic effectiveness of the fungi. The extent of VAM colonization of roots and the degree of symbiotic effectiveness observed at this level of simulated erosion were significantly higher than those observed in the soil not subjected to simulated erosion. This stimulation is attributed to the removal of antagonistic biotic factors as the top 7.5 cm of soil was removed. It is concluded that propagules lost during erosional soil losses must be replaced before legumes grown on relatively highly weathered and severely eroded tropical soils could appreciably benefit from the VAM symbiosis. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - An investigation was made into the fodder qualities of some multi-purpose trees used commonly in Sudan as dry season browse. The standard nutritional characteristics were measured for parts of Albizia lebbek, Azadirachta indica, Leucaena leucocephala, Parkinsonia aculeata, Prosopis chilensis and also ‘Pioneer’ hybrid sorghum. These characteristics, together with previously reported comparable data for Acacia tortilis, Balanites aegyptiaca and local sorghum, showed that nutritive levels for browse trees were higher than for sorghum, the main dry season fodder source. Tree browse is an important source of fodder, particularly towards the end of the dry season, but overgrazing and fuelwood cutting have depleted woodlands and there is an urgent need to plant such multi-purpose trees in order to increase the availability of browse. © 1988 A B Academic Publishers.

AB  - The floristic composition and biomass of the understorey was assessed in three 4-year old multi-purpose tree species. Compared to 29 species in the open, Leucaena leucocephala harboured only 5, Eucalyptus tereticornis 12, and Casuarina equisetifolia 18. The dry weight of the ground cover was also considerably restrained under the trees and the proportional reduction was comparatively less in C. equisetifolia. Suppression of ground vegetation is ascribed to allelopathic affects rather than to physical competition for light, water and nutrients. Of the three tree species, C. equisetifolia proved less injurious to the undergrowth. In contrast to the other trees the dominant species under L. leucocephala was L. leucocephala itself, indicating its lack of autotoxicity. © 1988 A B Academic Publishers-Printed in Great Britain.

AB  - The effects of dietary leucaena leaf meal on reproductive performance and growth of Nile tilapia were determined. In the preliminary trial, sexually mature Nile tilapia were fed with a control diet or a test diet which had leucaena leaf meal as the only protein source for 24 weeks. Fish fed with the leucaena diet lost some weight and had significantly low (P<0.05) gonadosomatic index and fry production compared to those fed with the control diet. Subsequently, four isonitrogenous diets (20% crude protein) containing varying amounts of leucaena leaf meal (0, 20, 40 and 80%) were fed to Nile tilapia broodstock. Mean weight gain of the female fish decreased as the level of leucaena leaf meal in the diets increased. Females fed with the 80% leucaena diet invariably lost weight. Mean weight gain of males fed with the control diet and the 20 and 40% leucaena diets did not differ significantly (P>0.05). However, growth of males fed with the 80% leucaena diet was remarkably low. Fry production was highest for those fed with the control diet and the 20% leucaena diet. Fry production decreased slightly in fish fed with the 40% leucaena diet and was significantly low (P<0.05) for those fed with the 80% leucaena diet. The low fry production was preceded by a decrease in body weight of the female fish. However, the gonadosomatic indices of the females and the males were not markedly affected by the diets. On the basis of both fry production and growth, leucaena leaf meal should not exceed 40% of the diet of Nile tilapia broodstock. © 1988.

AB  - Leaf dry matter productivity has been measured at the end of regrowth cycles of 3 months for stands of leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Flemingia macrophylla, all three species belonging to the Leguminosae. The effective period of observation was minimally 24 months, or 8 regrowth cycles, after a period of establishment of slightly more than a year. Using systematic trial designs, originally developed by NELDER, yield figures have been acquired for a broad range of plant densities. At a plant density of 10,000 trees per hectare the average yearly leaf DM productivity amounted to 15.4 ton for Leucaena leucocephala, 12.4 ton for Flemingia macrophylla and 10.5 ton for Gliricidia sepium.

AB  - The salt tolerance of Prosopis from highly saline environments of West Africa, Chile, Argentina, and the United States was compared to high-biomass-producing Prosopis identified in earlier field trials and to a Leucaena leucocephala cultivar. One hundred seedlings of each of ten accessions were grown in a hydroponic sand-culture system in the greenhouse in which the NaCl concentration of the nutrient solution was increased from 0.0%, 1.2%, 1.8%, 2.4%, 3.0%, to 3.3% (seawater). Prosopis tamarugo died early in the experiment due to fungal diseases. Leucaena leucocephala K67 and P. pubescens died at the 1.2% NaCl concentration. A Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa 1115 accession from Texas grew in the 1.2% NaCl but died in 3.0% NaCl. Prosopis alba 0166, P. alba/nigra 1117, P. articulata 0016, P. chilensis 0009, and P. juliflora 0044 all had seedlings which grew in the 3.3% NaCl treatment. Eighty of the seedlings which grew in the 3.3% NaCl have been repotted and propagated by rooting of cuttings. Each of the species which grew in 3.3% NaCl have been previously shown to fix nitrogen so these clones have potential for use as N-fixing halophytes. No other legume genus has been demonstrated to have such high salt tolerance, and Casuarina is the only other terrestrial N-fixing genus with equivalent salt tolerance. © 1988.

AB  - The addition of Leucaena leucocephala herbage did not diet of sheep in Venezuela did not affect the concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA) in the rumen, the degradation of rice straw incubated in sacco, or the numbers of rumen fungi or bacteria. However, feeding Leucaena increased the concentration of ammonia in the rumen. In addition, two products of the degradation of the toxic amino acid mimosine were detected in the rumen when Leucaena was fed. One of these products, 2,3-dihydroxy pyridine (2,3-DHP), was detected at concentrations of up to 1.1 μmol/ml. The other, 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone (3,4-DHP) was found at concentrations of up to 0.96 μmol/ml. The examination of bacterial cultures isolated from the rumen of the sheep under investigation showed that feeding Leucaena increased the relative proportions of short Gram-negative rods and decreased the proportion of long roads and coccobacilli present. Although the animals fed Leucaena showed a small loss in weight during the feeding trial, no evidence of Leucaena toxicity was seen. A total of 18 cultures capable of degrading 2,3-DHP or 3,4-DHP were isolated from the rumen of the sheep before Leucaena was fed. These included both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and a Gram-positive sporeformer. It seems that 2,3-DHP and 3,4-DHP may be degraded by a much wider range of bacteria than has been recognised previously. The detection of these bacteria before Leucaena was fed suggests that they were indigenous members of the rumen microflora of sheep in Venezuela. © 1990.

AB  - The allelopathic influence of Parthenium hysterphorus, a gregarious and ubiquitous weed, on four multi-purpose tree species - Acacia leucophloea, Casuarina equisetifolia, Eucalyptus tereticornis and Leucaena leucocephala - and three agricultural crops - cowpea, sorghum and sunflower - were tested by germinating seeds of these species in composite leachate obtained from the leaves, stem and flowers of the weed species. Germination of seeds of all test species, arboreal and arable, was severely inhibited by the leachate. In the tree crops, the magnitude of injury was the same under extracts prepared from 2 or 4 ml of distilled water per g of plant tissue. Among the arable crops, sunflower was affected to a greater extent. While radicle and plumule elongation were unaffected in the tree crops and in sunflower, plumule was curbed to a greater extent than radicle in cowpea. In sorghum, only radicle growth was impaired. The inhibition of germination and seedling growth is attributed to parthenin, an unsaturated lactone found in the plant parts of the weed species. © 1990 A B Academic Publishers-Printed in Great Britain.

At both locations, most of the trees established successfully under farmer management. However, the quality of establishment was uneven, and the rate of utilization generally poor, especially at one site. The limited success of the trials is traced to a number of related sociological, institutional and edaphic factors. These include poor soil fertility; the incompatibility of established cropping patterns and rotation practices with the planting of trees on farms; the division of labour and organization of decision-making within the household; and land and tree tenure rules. It is argued that farmer-managed trials are necessary to reveal the importance of sociological and institutional factors in farmers' decision making, and that such trials require a high level of farmer autonomy in their management. © 1989, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Productivity of the multipurpose, leguminous trees Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena diversifolia, Acacia auriculiformis, Calliandra calothyrsus and Sesbania grandiflora was examined under close spacing and intensive management. These trees are important components of tropical farming systems and are capable of supporting nirogen-fixing root nodules by Rhizobium. Experiments to compare the growth rates of the five species were conducted at five sites in Hawaii and the Philippines. Height, diameter and wood volume increments up to two years of age are reported. Wood volume equations are also presented for small diameter stems for each species. Leucaena leucocephala and L. diversifolia consistently produced the largest wood yields, as much as 97m3/ha/y on agricultural soils. Significant location x species inter-actions were found which reflect different site requirements for each species. -Authors

AB  - The N uptake of maize was assessed on an Alfisol in a sole crop and in an alley cropping system in southwestern Nigeria. Although the application of prunings increased the maize N content in both sole and alley-cropped maize, the N contributed to the maize by the prunings was low, ranging between 4.4 and 23.8 kg ha-1. This was equivalent to 3.2% and 9.407% of the N released during decomposition of the prunings. Application of the prunings increased the grain yields of the sole maize by 38% and the maize yield in the alley-cropped plots by 104%, compared with yields in the corresponding plots where prunings were not applied. The results indicate that part of the N from the prunings was retained in the soil organic-N pool. Maize N, dry weights and grain yields were lowest in the alley-cropped plots where prunings were removed, probably because of competition between the maize and the hedgerow trees. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Concentrations of phenamiphos ranging from 0 to 40 μrg/g soil were established in a typical Oxisol (Tropeptic Eutrustox), inoculated or uninoculated with Glomus aggregatum. The effect of the nematicide on the development of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) symbiosis was evaluated in the greenhouse using Leucaena leucocephala as an indicator host plant. Treatment of soil with phenamiphos did not have a significant influence on the development of mycorrhizal activity measured in terms of subleaflet phosphorus concentrations. Similarly, the nematicide did not have an adverse effect on the level of mycorrhizal colonization or on the P content of shoots, as determined at the time of harvest. However, shoot dry weight was adversely influenced by phenamiphos when the chemical was applied to the uninoculated soil at 20 μg/g soil or higher, and when it was applied to the inoculated soil at 40 μg/g soil. It is concluded that phenamiphos is not likely to influence the growth of Leucaena or its symbiotic association with VAM fungi if the concentrations applied do not exceed levels known to suppress nematodes. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - A geographical information system known locally as the 'Hawaii Natural Resources Information System' (HNRIS), was utilized to identify potential biomass plantation sites by matching biomass species (e.g. Eucalyptus grandis and Leucaena leucocephala) requirements with appropriate environmental conditions. The HNRIS database contains the essential information, such as soil type, elevation, temperature, solar radiation, rainfall, land zoning, ownership, and present use for the six major islands of the State of Hawaii, and facilitates a biomass energy resource assessment efficiently and economically, in contrast to conducting expensive and time-consuming large field trials at many independent locations.

AB  - Mycorrhizal infection in the roots of 10 sweet potato cultivars was assessed 7 weeks after planting in three soils collected from Ibadan, Fashola and Onne in southern Nigeria, three soils which contained 21.0, 7.8 and 54.8 mg P kg-1, respectively. Mycorrhizal infection averaged 17% in the soil from Ibadan, 24% in the soil from Fashola and 7% in the acid soil from Onne. The plants grown in the Fashola soil contained the same percentage of P as plants grown in the Onne soil. Although the percentage of P in sweet potato was lowest in the Ibadan soil, shoot dry weights were 35% higher in this soil than in the other two soils. There was no correlation between the level of mycorrhizal infection and plant dry weight in the partially sterilized soil from Ibadan. Sweet potato inoculated in this soil with infected roots of Leucaena leucocephala showed a higher level of mycorrhizal infection than uninoculated plants. Dry-matter production was, however, the same for all treatments. The sweet potato cultivars differed in their level of mycorrhizal infection and in their response to applied P. Cultivars TIS 2498 and TIS 70357 consistently showed the lowest percentage of infection; and TIb 4, TIS 8441 and TIS 8524 showed infection levels above 20% in the Fashola and Ibadan soils. When the low-yielding cultivar, TIb 4, and an improved clone, TIS 9265, were grown in the presence of 50 and 100 mg single superphosphate per kg soil, TIb 4 produced more dry matter in the presence of P fertilizer than it did without the fertilizer. Growth and mycorrhizal infection of TIS 9265 were not affected by the fertilizer. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various tropical silages made from either forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor cv. Sugardrip): three tropical grasses: hamil grass (Panicum maximum cv. Hamil), pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens) and setaria (Setaria anceps cv. Kazungula) either with or without addition of molasses and from mixtures of pangola or setaria grasses with leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) or gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium). The 311 wild strains isolated and 13 reference strains were examined by 80 biochemical, physiological and morphological tests. A computer‐assisted complete linkage analysis produced 16 clusters and five unclustered strains at 82% S. The largest cluster included 134 wild strains and the reference strain Lactobacillus plantarum. The results showed that Lactobacillus plantarum was the predominant lactic acid bacterium in all of the tropical silages. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The nitrogen contribution from the shoot and root system of symbiotically grown leucaena was evaluated in a field experiment on an Alfisol at IITA in Southern Nigeria. Maize in plots that received prunings from inoculated leucaena contained more N and grain yield was increased by 1.9 t.ha.-1. Large quantities of nitrogen were harvested with leucaena prunings (300 kg N ha-1 in six months) but the efficiency of utilization of this nitrogen by maize was low compared to inorganic N fertilizer (ammonium sulphate) at 80 kg N ha-1. Maize yield data indicated that nitrogen in leucaena prunigs was 34 and 45% as efficient as 80 kg N ha-1 of (NH4)2SO4 for uninoculated and inoculated plants with Rhizobium IRc 1045, respectively. In plots where the prunings were removed, the leaf litter and decaying roots and nodules contributed N equivalent of 32 kg ha-1. Twenty-five kg ha-1 was the inorganic N equivalent from nitrogen fixed symbiotically by leucaena when inoculated with Rhizobium strain IRc 1045. Application of prunings from inoculated leucaena resulted in higher soil ogranic C, total N, pH and available NO3. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Purification of cysteine synthase from the seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala revealed the presence of two forms of this enzyme, separated by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-50. Both isoenzymes have the same Mr of 64 000 consisting of two identical subunits, each containing one molecule of pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP). The Km values of isoenzymes A and B were 16.7 and 6.7 mM for O-acetyl-l-serine (OAS), respectively. Data on the substrate specificity show that both isoenzymes catalyse the formation of some heterocyclic β-substituted alanines such as β-(pyrazol-1-yl)-l-alanine from OAS as an additional catalytic activity, but only isoenzyme B catalyses the formation of l-mimosine. Several properties of the purified cysteine synthase isoenzymes are described. © 1990.

AB  - The influence of inorganic N on the development of mycorrhizal symbiosis in Leucaena leucocephala (lam.) de Wit was studied in an Oxisol subjected to simulated erosion. The plants were grown in pots containing soil samples inoculated with the VAM fungus Glomus aggregatum and amended with 0, 25, 50 or 100 ppm N. The extent of VAM colonization of roots increased with increasing levels of N in both eroded and uneroded soils. However, the level of infection was significantly higher in the eroded soil than in the uneroded one. Mycorrhizal activity monitored in terms of P content of leucaena subleaflets increased significantly in the eroded soil when it was amended with 25 ppm N and became similar to that observed in the uneroded soil. Nodule dry matter production and shoot N concentration increased significantly with N application upto 50 ppm. Above this level of N, nodule dry weight declined while N concentration did not change. Application of 25 ppm N to the eroded soil also significantly increased shoot and root dry weights while no change was observed in the uneroded soil. A further increase in N level did not improve yield. The results illustraste the potential benefits of starter N in the establishment of mycorrhizal and nodulated Leucaena leucocephala in eroded soils. Copyright © 1989 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

AB  - Operational experience with a topless hybrid wood gasifier powering a 3·75 kW diesel engine pumpset is detailed. The gasifier-engine pumpset has logged 250 h of operation. The fuel was Leucaena leucocephala wood from trees 1-2 years old. Average diesel substitution varied between 50-78% depending on load. With increased load the diesel substitution decreases. On average the gasifier consumes 1·33 kg of wood and 125 ml of diesel to produce 1 kWh of mechanical energy for water pumping. Economic analysis reveals that at 60% diesel substitution and wood cost of Rs 0·5/kg (1 US$ = Rs 13·0), the gasifier system is economically comparable to stand alone diesel water pumping systems. Reasons for slow propagation of this technology in rural areas are outlined. © 1989.

AB  - A few species of fuelwood trees were established on highly alkaline wasteland at Aligarh (27°5′ N., 78°4′ E.) in a tropical environment. Of these Prosopis juliflora produced maximum biomass (12.05 t ha−1) and had an energy content of 242.11 GJ ha−1 after 3.5 years growth period. The survival percentage of Terminalia arjuna was highest of those the species tried, but their growth and biomass production were inferior to that of Prosopis juliflora and Acacia nilotica. Some of the fuelwood tree plantations were raised without adding any soil amendment but suffered heavy mortality and could not produce any significant quantity of biomass. In another experiment Leucaena leucocephala was identified as a most promising species for afforestation on substandard soils; also it was found that a relatively high population density (of about 7,500 plants per hectare) is required to rehabilitate such land. Of the soil amendments tried, gypsum with farmyard manure and sand in equal proportion gave the better response (gypsum alone was also tried). Two species of shrubs: Sesbania sesban and Tamarix dioca have shown good adaptability in difficult habitats. After five years of afforestation the soil properties of the sites improved significantly, showing marked reduction in pH, EC and ESP values and an increase in organic carbon content.

AB  - Pot and field experiments carried out at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and at Fashola, Southwestern Nigeria, examined the effect of inoculation and N, P and micronutrients on nodulation and growth of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. In pot studies all parameters measured, except the percentage of nitrogen in shoots, were improved by inoculation, nitrogen and phosphorus. Micronutrients increased only nitrogen and allantoin contents. Interactions between inoculation and P, N and micronutrients on nodulation and growth of leucaena were observed. The effect of inoculation and fertilization with phosphorus or micronutrients was further investigated in field experiments. Establishment of uninoculated and unfertilized leucaena was poor at both locations due to low soil fertility and the presence of only a few native leucaena rhizobia. At one site, only inoculated plants were nodulated, while at the other, all plants produced nodules. Shoot dry weight, total nitrogen and phosphorus of inoculated plants were statistically equal to nitrogen-fertilized plants. Uninoculated plants were stunted. Generally, micronutrients did not influence nodulation, total nitrogen or growth of leucaena. They had only a positive effect on nitrogenase activity. Phosphorus increased total nitrogen and phosphorus uptake and plant growth. A 75% increase in shoot dry weight was obtained when 80 kg P ha-1 was applied to inoculated leucaena with Rhizobium strain IRc 1045. Inoculated plants contained more allantoins than uninoculated ones but no significant correlation was found between these compounds and other parameters of N fixation. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of prolonged ingestion of Leucaena leucocephala, a leguminous shrub with a potential as a source of animal feed in Southern Taiwan, by heifers on serum thyroid hormone levels. Ten crossbred beef heifers were divided into treated (grazing Hawaiian wildtype leucaena) and control (grazing Pangola grass only) groups of 5 animals each. The heifers grazing leucaena exhibited significantly (P less than 0.001) lower serum total triiodothyronine levels and also showed a tendency (P less than 0.10) for a lower thyroxine level. Growth rates to 90 days were 0.26 +/- 0.02 and 0.17 +/- 0.02 kg/day for heifers on Pangola grass and leucaena pastures, respectively. The difference was significant (P less than 0.05). Three of five heifers grazing leucaena showed severe hair loss from the tail and other parts of the body. Our results suggest that leucaena toxicity to animals may be present in Southern Taiwan.

AB  - Ten lines of Leucaena leucocephala, 1 of L. diversifoliamd 3 L. leucocephala × L. pulverulenta F1 hybrids were grown at 5 contrasting sites in Queensland. Harvests were taken over 3 growing seasons, and dry matter yields estimated. The Fi hybrids were outstanding in most environments, outyielding cv. Cunningham by an average of 45%; the L. leucocephala lines CPI 58396 and 61227 and cv. K8 consistently out-yielded cv. Cunningham by an average of 24%. When 2 contrasting cutting intervals were compared at Lansdown, there was no effect on dry matter yields, although the longer cutting interval produced more wood. The range of mimosine concentrations in the L. leucocephala lines was 4·1–5·6%. CPI 61227 had significantly lower mimosine content than cv. Cunningham. The genotypexsite interaction for total yield was significant (P<0·01). However, ranking of lines of L. leucocephala was fairly consistent across environments. © 1988 CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - The mean internal rate of return (IRR) on Leucaena leucocephala plantations in Taiwan at the end of the first 5-year rotation was determined by Hertz’s method, a computer-based capital investment risk analysis procedure, to be 7.4% with standard deviation of 16.9%. This IRR is higher than can be obtained for other tree species in Taiwan. The cumulative probability of obtaining an IRR greater than 9% (the secured loan rate) is 38%. Thus there is some potential for making a profit from planting L. leucocephala in Taiwan but proper site selection is essential. © 1988 A B Academic Publishers-Printed in Great Britain.

AB  - Effects and interactions of varying CaSO4 and NaCl levels on growth and nitrogen fixation of Leucaena leucocephala K8 were examined. Leucaena was grown in nutrient solution at four levels of CaSO4 (0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 m M) and NaCl (1, 25, 50 and 100 m M) in randomized blocks with five replications. While NaCl significantly reduced plant growth, additions of CaSO4 increased plant height, leaf number, and biomass of salt treated plants. For the nonsaline treatments, high CaSO4 levels slightly depressed growth, which contradicts suggestions that Leucaena has a high calcium requirement. A significant calcium/sodium interaction was not seen for nodule number or weight. Nodule number was significantly depressed by 100 m M NaCl and nodule weight of the salt stressed plants significantly increased as CaSO4 concentration increased from 0.5 to 2.5 m M. Effects of NaCl and CaSO4 on nitrogen content of plant parts were inconclusive. The promotion of Leucaena salinity tolerance by addition of CaSO4 may be attributed to the effect of calcium in maintaing the selective permeability of membranes. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - On Alfisols of pH 5.5 or higher in the forest and forest-savanna transitional zones, systems including food crop-cover crop rotation, minimum tillage and and judicial use of fertilizer can sustain yields on small farms for ≥10 yr without reverting land to bush fallow. Interplanting leguminous trees such as Leucaena leucocephala with annual food crops improves food crop yields. The leguminous trees fix atmospheric N, recycle mineral nutrients from the subsoil, and prevent soil erosion and run-off water on sloping land. On strongly leached acid soils (Ultisols, Oxisols) in high-rainfall regions, nutrient cycling and green manuring are less effective because of subsoil infertility. Intensive food crop production on such soils requires costly inputs of fertilizer and lime, but periodic application of small dosages of lime can sustain a moderate crop yield. Gradual saturation of subsoil horizons with Ca is a prerequisite for effective recycling of nutrients in agricultural systems in the high-rainfall region. -from Authors

AB  - The decomposition of the leaf mulches of Leucaena leecocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Flemingia macrophylla has been studied under field conditions. Mulch samples were analysed over a period of 70 days on carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus,potassium, calcium and magnesium left. Loss rates for the elements show similar patterns for the three mulches. Losses of mulch material are caused by decomposition as well as removal by soil-dwelling fauna (insects, arthropods, etc.) feeding on the mulch. Based on the data decomposition-and nutrient release functions are developed for the three mulches. These functions are useful in alley-cropping system analysis and models.MulchtypeHalf-life value of the mulchPersistence relative to Leucaena mulchin vitro digestivility relative to LeucaenaLeucaena leucocephala31 days1.01.0 Gliricidia sepium220.71.0 Flemingia macrophylla531.70.5 © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - We measured the effect of increased supply of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru) on the growth of steers grazing native pasture in South East Queensland. Steers grazed paddocks of black speargrass (Heteropogon contortus) pasture in which either 0, 25 or 100% of the area was sown to 3 m-wide rows of leucaena. In the 25% leucaena treatment, the leucaena portion was ungrazed in summer. Mimosine toxicity was avoided by dosing cattle with mimosine-detoxifying rumen bacteria. The growth rate of steers increased with the proportion of the paddock covered by leucaena. Steers grazing paddocks with 0, 25, and 100% of the paddock covered by leucaena rows gained 90, 127 and 205 kg/steer.year, respectively. The amount of leucaena foliage on offer appeared to be the major factor increasing steer growth. © 1990 CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - Napier grass and Leucaena leucocephala, supplemented with dried palm oil mill effluent (POME) were fed to Katjang and Katjang × German Fawn crossbred goats in three experiments. Goats were offered Napier grass or leucaena ad libitum supplemented with POME at 0, 5 or 10 g/kg live weight (LW) (Experiment 1). Leucaena was fed ad libitum and POME at 10, 20 or 30 g/kg LW in Experiment 2. Napier grass was provided ad libitum, leucaena at 1 kg/animal, and untreated or 4% NaOH-treated POME at 20 g/kg LW in Experiment 3. There were no statistical differences in feed intake between Katjang and crossbred goats in the three experiments (P > 0.05), but crossbreds gained more than Katjang in Experiment 1 (P < 0.001) and Experiment 3 (P < 0.05). Intake was higher for leucaena than Napier grass (P < 0.05). Supplementary POME at all levels did not depress forage intake significantly (P > 0.05), but increased total intake (P < 0.01). Alkali treatment of POME in Experiment 3 significantly reduced forage and total intake (P < 0.01). LW gain was similar between treated and untreated diets. Mixed grass-leucaena forage rations in Experiment 3 were superior to all-grass or all-leucaena rations in Experiments 1 and 2. Average forage intake, total intake and LW gain in Experiment 3 were 27.0 and 44.1 g dry matter/kg LW and 54.8 g, respectively. © 1988.

AB  - A sequential ntial harve experiment was conducted in the greenhouse to determine relative growth rate (RGR), specific absorption rate (SAR) of P, P utilization rate (PUR) and P utilization efficiency (PUE) of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) and nonmycorrhizal Leucaena leucocephala. Total P content, root length and total dry-matter yield of mycorrhizal plants were significantly higher than those of nonnlycorrhizal plants beginning on 15, 25 and 25 days after planting, respectively. The length of root colonized by Glomus aggregatum increased exponentially with time and leveled off 30 days after planting. In mycorrhizal plants. RGR of roots (based on total root length) was lower than those of RGR of infected roots till 30 days after planting, after which time the trend was reversed. Although, RGR based on dry-matter yield was higher in mycorrhizal plants than in nonmycorrhizal plants, the differences observed were not statistically significant. SAR of P was higher in mycorrhizal plants than in nonmycorrhizal ones till 30 days after planting. Even though, total P contents and concentrations in mycorrhizal plants were higher than nonmycorrhizal plants, PUR and PUE were higher in nonmycorrhizal plants. These results indicate that, although VAM plants were very efficient in P absorption and accumulation, they were not superior to non-VAM plants in Putilization. However, plant species forming effective symbiosis with VAM fungi are likely to be successful competitors in nutrient-poor environments than plants not infected with the fungi. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The role of tree legume leaf as a green manure in increasing the N status of soils has been widely recognized. An alternative to the direct application of leaf is the feeding of the leaf to animals and using the dung and urine as the N source. This experiment was undertaken to measure the release of N from dried leaf of Leucaena leucocophala cv. Cunningham and Gliricidia sepium and from the dung and urine from goats fed the same leaf. The residue materials were labelled with 15N and either incorporated into the soil or applied onto the surface. ISN released from the residues was measured over a 10-week period by extraction using a grass crop of Panicum maximum cv. Riversdale and measurement of mineral N in the soil. Highest recovery was 89.6% in the leucaena-derived urine incorporated treatment and lowest (< 10%) in the surface-applied faeces treatment of both species. 15N recovery in the grass indicated that leucaena leaf is more resistant to breakdown than gliricidia leaf. These data suggest that careful consideration should be given to the use of leaf litter as an N source. In situations where volatilization of N from excreta can be minimized, such as in cut-and-carry systems, the N economy of the system could be enhanced by including the animal in the N cycle. © 1990 CSIRO.

AB  - The nutritional attributes of Leucaena leucocephala and the factors limiting its use in poultry diets have been the subject of considerable research over the past 10 years. Recent data confirm the previous findings concerning the favourable proximate composition of Leucaena leaf meal (LLM), although the carotenoid content of this legume is now emerging as its major asset for the pigmentation of egg yolks and broiler carcasses. Toxicological evaluation continues to be a major feature of research on Leucaena. Following recent innovative developments in analytical chemistry, there is now more reliable information pertaining to the concentration of mimosine in LLM and seeds and to the degradation of this amino acid to 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone. Data on the concentrations of tannins, trypsin inhibitors, galactomannan gums, saponins and flavonols are also reviewed in this paper. Detoxification of Leucaena for poultry remains an outstanding problem, since there are limitations to conventional approaches such as plant breeding and the use of heat treatments. Considerable amelioration of the adverse effects of LLM may be obtained by the use of dietary additives such as ferric sulphate and polyethylene glycol. However, these improvements rely upon appropriate adjustments for the low apparent metabolisable energy (AME) value of LLM. Thus despite recent advances, the low AME of LLM remains a challenging issue for the future. © 1989.

AB  - The effects of varying CaSO4 and NaCl levels on the nutrient content of Leucaena leucocephala were established by examining the concentrations of Na, Ca, Cl, K and Mg in leucaena roots, stems and leaves. Leucaena was grown in nutrient solution at four levels of CaSO4 (0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 m M) and NaCl (1, 25, 50 and 100 m M), in randomized blocks with five replications. Leucaena excluded sodium from stems and leaves when NaCl concentration was 50 m M or less. Sodium uptake decreased as CaSO4 concentration increased. Calcium uptake was affected by NaCl concentration when substrate CaSO4 concentration was 0.5 m M. At this level, 100 m M NaCl caused a marked decrease in leaf calcium and a marked increase in leaf Cl. In all other treatments, Cl uptake was not affected by CaSO4 concentration. Potassium uptake was strongly depressed as NaCl concentration increased at low Ca concentration, but this effect was offset at high Ca. Magnesium uptake decreased as CaSO4 levels increased. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Diurnal variations in acetylene reduction and net hydrogen evolution were shown in five tropical and subtropical nitrogen-fixing tree symbioses. The symbioses studied in a growth chamber were: Acacia albida × TAL 1457, Leucaena leucocephala × TAL 1145, Prosopis chilensis × TAL 600, Casuarina glauca × HFP Cc13 and C. obesa × HFP Cc13.Acetylene reduction was highest at the end of the light period in all symbioses studied. In the A. albida × TAL 1457 symbiosis, the diurnal variations in acetylene reduction and net hydrogen evolution showed a minor synchrony, while in the other symbioses the diurnal pattern of acetylene reduction and net hydrogen evolution clearly differed. Also, a diurnal variation in relative efficiency of nitrogenase was shown in the A. albida × TAL 1457 symbiosis.A hydrogen uptake enzyme was detected at a low substrate concentration (24.5 mmol m-3 H2) for L. leucocephala × TAL 1145, C. obesa × HFP Cc13 and has earlier been found for C. glauca × HFP CcI3. A hydrogen uptake system was also found for P. chilensis × TAL 600 and A. albida × TAL 1457 at a 17-fold higher substrate concentration.The results show that a diurnal variation in C2H2 reduction and H2 evolution occurs, and that diurnal variation in the conversion factor between C2H2 reduction and N2 fixation could occur. This fact raises criticisms regarding the use of a point estimate of this factor. © 1989 Oxford University Press.

AB  - Field experiments were conducted on a tropical Alfisol at Ibadan, Nigeria, to evaluate the effects on soil moisture and crop yields of three agroforestry systems. Effects of agroforestry treatments involving two perennial shrubs (Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium), each at 2-m and 4-m row spacings, were compared with no-till and plow-till systems of seedbed preparation. Measurements were made for soil properties, runoff and erosion, nutrient losses in runoff, and crop growth and yield for a uniform maize (Zea mays) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) rotation. All of the six plots, each measuring 70 × 10m, were established on a natural slope of about 7%. Alterations in soil properties and effects on crop growth were evaluated for six consecutive years from 1982 through 1987. Seed germination and seedling establishment of Leucaena hedgerows were satisfactory while establishment of Gliricidia from stem cuttings was unsatisfactory. Maize germination and crop stand were normal while that of cowpea were suppressed by both Leucaena and Gliricidia. Maize growth and yield were suppressed only in the vicinity of hedgerows. Maize grain yield in agroforestry systems averaged about 10 percent lower than that of the control. In contrast with maize, agroforestry systems drastically suppressed cowpea grain yield. The average cowpea yield in agroforestry systems was 30 to 50% of the control. Regardless of the mangement system, grain yields declined over time at the rate of 340 and 96 kg ha-1yr-1 for maize and cowpea, respectively. Hedgerows of Leucaena and Gliricidia acted as windbreaks. Consequently, soil moisture content in the top 0-5 cm layer in agroforestry systems was generally higher than that in the control during both wet and dry seasons. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The growth and survival of Prosopis alba 0166 and Leucaena leucocephala K8 were compared under non-irrigated conditions in semi-arid south Texas using contrasting seedling container types. One was a large dibble-tube (Ray Leach Supercell) that was removed prior to transplant. The other container was a cardboard plant-band and was not removed prior to transplant. A poorly prepared seed bed was used to enhance stressful water conditions. In 1983, no rain occurred within 6 weeks of planting and 387 mm occurred in the first 9 months after planting. In 1984, the first significant rain occurred 21 days after planting and 587 mm of rain occurred within the first 9 months after planting. In the driest year (1983), Prosopis had about 25% greater survival than Leucaena and the plant-bands had 25% greater survival than the dibble-tubes for both Prosopis and Leucaena. In the wetter year, there were no significant differences in survival among the container types or between the species. © 1988.

AB  - Effects of hedgerow species on surface soil physical properties were studied in an on-going trial established since 1981 on an Oxic Paleustalf in southwestern Nigeria. The experimental treatments were Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium Alchornea cordifolia and Acioa barterii hedgerows planted at 4 m interhedgerow spacings and a control (no hedgerows). Plots were sequentially cropped with maize (Zea mays) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Soil physical properties, i.e. particle size distribution, bulk density, apparent pore size distribution and water infiltration, were monitored during the dry season in January and the main growing season in June 1989. Soil temperature was monitored at approximately monthly intervals from February to June 1989. Soil properties of alley-cropped plots were superior to those of the control. Soil compaction was highest in the control and lowest with L. leucocephala. Between the hedgerow species, within-season increases in soil compaction were largest with A. cordifolia. Lowest soil temperatures were observed with L. leucocephala and A. barterii. Frequency, quantity and quality of prunings produced by the hedgerow species appeared to have a major beneficial effect on soil physical properties. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala generally produces pods with more than 7-9 seeds. This is regulated by the stigmatic inhibition of pollen grain germination when the pollen grains are less than a critical number in the stigma. This number-dependent inhibition of pollen grain germination is effected by a pH-dependent proteinaceous inhibitor active at the stigmatic pH. Only when the pollen grains in the stigma exceed the critical number, they inactivate the inhibitor by collectively raising the stigmatic pH and thus overcoming the inhibition. The adaptive significance of such pre-fertilization mechanism for the female in inciting mate competition among the pollen grains is discussed. The evolution of en masse pollen grain dispersal units is explained as a sexual selection strategy by males in response to such stigmatic inhibition by females. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In experiments conducted over a four-year period the effect of pasture type (Setaria sphacelata and a Brachiaria decumbens/Leucaena leucocephala mixture), management system (rotational grazing and cut and carry) and level of concentrate supplement (0, 4 and 6 kg fresh weight/cow per day) on milk production in smallholder dairy units was examined. All units were 1 ha in size and stocked with five Sahiwal × Friesian cows. Milk yields/ha were higher from rotational grazing and the brachiaria/leucaena pasture when compared with the cut and carry system and the setaria pasture respectively. In subsequent experiments smallholder units were based on brachiaria/leucaena and rotational grazing. A supplement of 4 kg fresh weight of concentrate (11 MJ/kg DM and 150 g/kg DM CP) increased milk yield/ha from 7,760 to 13,045 kg while in a third trial milk yield/ha was further increased from 14,148 to 16,760 kg when concentrate level was raised from 4 to 6 kg fresh weight/day. The results indicate that smallholder dairy units in Malaysia could be economically viable and competitive with other agricultural enterprises such as rubber and oil palm. © 1989 Longman Group Limited.

AB  - The growth and yield of Eucalyptus urophylla and two varieties of Leucaena leucocephala (vars. K8 and K72) in pure stand and two-species mixtures were assessed over a seven year rotation. The experiment was established on moderately fertile soil in the humid/subhumid tropical climate of coastal Espirito Santo, Brazil in a randomized complete block design. Complete site preparation, fertilizer application and weed control further improved the site conditions for both species. At age 7 years, the eucalypts were all single-stemmed with an average height of about 20 m and dbh of 19 cm while the leucaena were multi-stemmed with an average height of 13 m and dbh of 9 cm per stem. Leucaena survival ranged from 95 to 100%while eucalypt survival was 75%when grown pure and only 50 to 65%when grown in mixture with leucaena. Yields varied between 31 and 46 m3/ha/yr, with maximum yield in the pure eucalypt treatment, intermediate yields in the two species mixtures and lowest yields in the pure leucaena treatments. Tables are presented of stacked and solid volume yields, dry matter biomass and charcoal production. It is suggested that on soils of good fertility and under fertilized conditions there is no advantage in terms of yield in growing leucaena and eucalyptus in mixture. © 1989 A B Academic Publishers-Printed in Great Britain.

AB  - Pot experiments were conducted to assess the lime and phosphorus requirements of Leucaena leucocephala (LAM.) De Wit grown on three acid soils (Ultisols) from southeastern Nigeria. Liming and phosphorus application significantly enhanced growth of L. leucocephala. Ammakama soil showed best effect to phosphorus application, while acidity problems were more pronounced on Onne and Isienu soils. High lime rate (2000 ppm) reduced plant growth in Isienu soil probably due to nutrient imbalance. Potassium, manganese and zinc levels in the plants were reduced with increasing lime rates. On Onne and Isienu soils plant tops correlated better with total acidity and extractable Al+3 level than with soil pH-H2O. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - VAM propagule densities of clay soils from bushland in various stages of degradation and from cultivated areas were determined using the most probable number method. The use of Cucumis sativus, Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala as host plants in the assays was compared, proving C. sativus to give the highest propagule counts. Associations of vegetation with a high degree of cover showed higher propagule densities than degraded bushland and cultivated areas. The subsoils showed very low VAM propagule counts in all samples. © 1990.

AB  - Leonard jar, pot and field experiments examined the effects of inoculation and the influence of nitrogen fertilizer on nodulation, nitrogen fixation and growth of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit at IITA, Ibadan, Nigeria. Leucaena responded to both inoculation and/or nitrogen application. Shoot growth and total N and P of inoculated plants were comparable to those of the highest N treatment, and the values were about 55% greater than those of uninoculated ones. Field data indicated that toal N yields of inoculated leucaena were increased by 50% with 40 or 80 kg ha-1 of N fertilizer. However, N fertilizer depressed N fixation by 56% as was expected from nodule mass data. N-fixation was delayed for about 8 weeks in the plots without N. Application of small amounts of N starter (20 ppm) proved to be beneficial to satisfy the plant need during the early stage of leucaena growth. The rhizobial strains IRc 1045 and IRc 1050 were effective, competitive and survived well in the field one year after their establishment. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of three vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) species in an Oxisol subjected to simulated erosion using Leucaena leucocephala as an indicator host. The extent of colonization of leucaena roots increased significantly due to VAM inoculation of the eroded and uneroded soils. The highest level of VAM colonization was observed when leucaena was grown in association with Glomus aggregatum. followed by G. mosseae and G. etunicatum. Increased infection associated with inoculation of the eroded soil did not result in enhanced mycorrhizal effectiveness. Inoculation of the uneroded soil, however, led to significant improvement in root colonization as well as in symbiotic effectiveness. Suppression in expression of mycorrhizal effectiveness in the eroded soil appears to be a result qf nutrient deficiency. The results suggest the importance of restoring lost nutrients before differences in VAM species could be effectively exploited for a successful establishment of a mycorrhizal plants in eroded soils. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Leucaena was grown for eleven weeks in a pH and calcium amended oxisol and ultisol to determine whether poor growth in acid soils is related to calcium deficiency or low pH induced effects, such as aluminium toxicity. Soil pH was ameliorated by the addition of either CaCO3, or SrCO3, while CaCO3 or Ca(NO3)2 were used to modify calcium supply. In both soils, CaCO3, and SrCO3 application resulted in an increase in pH and a reduction in exchangeable aluminium although the response of leucaena to the applied amendment varied between the two soils. In the oxisol there was little effect of increased pH on growth, but a marked response to Ca application. In the ultisol, growth was improved by increasing pH but there was no response to increased calcium. The effects of liming on these soils are discussed in relation to alternative strategies available for utilising leucaena and other tree legumes. © 1987 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted for five years at Kota (Rajasthan) to study the compatibility of field crops (sorghum, pigeonpea, blackgram, greengram, and castor during the Kharif season and taramira and safflower during rabi) with Leucaena leucocephala under a rainfed agroforestry system. The result indicates that leucaena did not have any adverse effect on the yield of kharif crops during the initial two years. On average, the reduction in grain yield up to 10m distance was 25, 29, 31, 37 and 38% in sorghum, castor, sorghum+pigeonpea, greengram and blackgram respectively. The reduction in grain yield of field crops could be compensated by obtaining additional fuel wood, green fodder, seed and organic matter (9-10 t/ha) from Leucaena planted on field bunds. -from Authors

AB  - Performance of a downdraft, biomass gasifier-engine system is reported. Two types of diesel (direct injected and indirect injected) engines used in agricultural applications have been operated with the same gasifier system in the producer gas-cum-diesel, dual-fuel mode. The biomass used in these investigations is Subabool (Leucaena leucocephala). The systems have been evaluated with reference to their thermal, power and emission performance levels. Percentage diesel replacement at different loads has been evaluated as a parameter of interest. It was observed that the various performance facets of dual-fuel operation are considerably influenced by the engine design and operating parameters such as the design of the cooling-cleaning system, especially its volume, which is an important parameter determining the level of diesel replacement as well as the power capacity under dual-fuel mode. The low speed engine was found to be more sensitive to the volume of cooling-cleaning system. It was possible to improve diesel replacement from 68 to 80% at 80% of rated load and maximum power capacity from 3·7 kW to 4·5 kW by changing the volume of the gas cooling-cleaning system. Results of these investigations clearly suggest need for application-specific tuning of the gasifier and the engine units by optimisation of the design of gas processing sub-system for achieving best system performance. It has been established that dual-fuel operation results in substantial increase in engine exhaust CO content, more so at part loads. Reduction in smoke levels under dual-fuel operation is an important advantage irrespective of the engine design and operating particulars. © 1989.

AB  - Transfer of the strain NGR234nodD 1 gene into the narrow host range R. trifolii strain ANU843 on either a 6.7-kb HindIII or 17-kb XhoI fragment broadens the host range of this bacterium to include the tropical legumes Vigna unguiculata, Glycine ussuriensis, Leucaena leucocephala, and siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum). Contrary to previous data (Bassam et al. 1986), mutagenesis of the 17-kb XhoI fragment with a mini-Mu lac transposon (Mu dII1734) showed that a functional nodD 1 gene was essential for extended host range. Gene expression studies using both Mu dII1734 fusions and a promoter-cloning vector indicated that several loci, including the nodD 1 gene, are constitutively expressed. No evidence was found for regulation of the strain NGR234 nodD 1 gene by its product. Another locus nod-81, was induced only in the presence of exudates from various plant species, including soybean (Glycine max). Whereas the expression of nod-81 was dependent on the presence of a functional nodD 1 gene product, a regulatory nod-box DNA sequence was not detected 5' to this gene by using available oligonucleotide hybridization probes. The nod-81 locus was induced by genistein, daidzein, naringenin, and coumestrol from both cotyledon and root tissue of freshly germinated soybean seedlings. A broad spectrum of commercially available phenolic compounds stimulated induction of the nod-81 locus, including some that antagonize nod gene induction in other Rhizobium species. The nodD 1 gene product from strain NGR234 was shown to determine the spectrum of compounds that induce nod-81 expression.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru) was sown at 5 plant densities with 2 spatial arrangements at Brian Pastures Pasture Research Station, Gayndah, to determine the effects of these factors on leucaena and inter-row grass dry matter yield. During the 2 year establishment phase, yields of edible leucaena (leaves, pods, flowers and stems to a diameter of 5 mm) averaged 4400 and 2440 kg/ha respectively. Yields in subsequent years stabilised to an overall mean of 1360 kg/ha, with the amount of edible leucaena increasing with increasing leucaena plant density from 640 to 2260 kg/ha at 6000 and 62 500 leucaena plants/ha respectively. Edible leucaena yield for the mean of the 5 plant densities was increased by 38% when row spacing was doubled. Yields of both total and senesced leucaena were directly related to the annual rainfall. At the end of each growing season in May, edible leucaena yield remained stable between rainfall extremes of 492 and 878 mm while the amount of senesced leucaena litter increased. Edible leucaena yield was directly related to leucaena plant density (R2= 0.86). Annual total leucaena yield (edible leucaena yield plus leucaena litter) was best related to the plant parameters leucaena plant volume (R2 = 0.92), leucaena stem numbers (R2 = 0.90) and leucaena stem diameter (R2 = 0.90). Number of green panic (Panicum maximum var, trichoglume) shoots showed a marked increase at the 3 higher leucaena densities (mean of 28 shoots/m2) compared with the 2 lower leucaena densities (mean of 7 shoots/m2). Total soil nitrogen also increased at the 3 higher leucaena densities (mean of 0.186%) relative to the 2 lower leucaena densities (mean of 0.170%). Inter-row grass and grass litter yields both declined from 4640 and 4010 kg/ha to 31 10 and 2420 kg/ha respectively with increasing leucaena density. Maximum yields of edible leucaena were obtained when leucaena was grown at a density of 62 500 plants per ha in rows 0.8 m apart. © 1988 CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - During October 1986, excessive sap uptake by jumping plant lice (Heteropsylla cubana) caused severe damage to the canopy foliage of the Leucaena leucocephala scrub at a site in C Okinawa. By December 1986, 2 types of herbaceous undergrowth, zebra grass Miscanthus sinensis and the climber Ipomoea acuminata, had begun to grow. About 4000 seeds/m2 were buried in the topsoil, 35% of which were lost during half of the 1987 growing season. Seedling number gradually decreased due to both coverage by the herbaceous species and to the repeated attacks by jumping plant lice. The seedlings of broad-leaved tree species were suppressed by zebra grass, and gradually decreased in number, whereas in stands of the climbing plant they were able to maintain their numbers. -from English summary

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, a tropical leguminous shrub, contains a toxic amino acid, mimosine. Successful utilization of leucaena as a ruminant forage depends on colonization of the rumen by bacteria that degrade dihydroxypyridines (DHP), which are toxic intermediates in the metabolism of mimosine. Populations in the rumina of animals in some parts of the world, however, do not include bacteria that are able to carry out this degradation. We thus describe tests for the presence of DHP degraders in ruminal populations that are based on degradation (loss) of DHP compounds from culture media. Results obtained with the tests indicate that DHP degraders were not part of microbial populations in the rumina of cattle, sheep, and goats in Iowa, while most rumen samples examined from animals from the Virgin Islands and Haiti contained DHP degraders. These results confirm and extend the findings of others about geographic limits to the distribution of these important ruminal bacteria.

AB  - Pot experiments were carried out to determine the effects of single and mixed inoculations with phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi on the growth of Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia confusa, Acacia mangium, and Liquidamber formosana in three subtropical-tropical soils. The growth responses of leucaena to the inoculation with P-solubilizing bacteria alone increased in five out of six treatments with and without sterilized soils, with an average of 33.2%. Leucaena growth significantly increased by 22–99% in VAM fungal inoculation in the three soils. A synergistic effect of mixed inoculation with P-solubilizing bacteria and VAM fungi on the growth of leucaena occurred in unsterilized Wufun soil. Inoculation with these mixed inoculants also promoted the growth of Acacia confusa (14 to 63%), A. mangium (7 to 88%), and Liquidamber formosana (24 to 280%) in these three soils. The results show that soil property is a significant factor in the modification of the response of these three tree species to the P-solubilizing bacteria and VAM fungi inoculations. The beneficial effect of P-solubilizing bacteria can be demonstrated in soils with a high content of available P (95 μ g/g soil). © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The mulches were applied at a standard quantity of 5,000 kg ha-1 DM. In order to characterise a mulch material two parameters are distinguished; the initial impact (Ii) and the effective lifetime (Te) of a mulch material. I is expressed in terms of percentage surplus moisture or degrees Celsius average temperature reduction. T quantifies the duration of the effect. Of the three mulch materials that of Flemingia macrophylla performs best in terms of moisture retention and lowering soil temperatures as well as in terms of longevity of the effect.

AB  - Response of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit to rock phosphate application and inoculation with the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungus Glomus aggregatum (Schenck and Smith emend Koske) was evaluated in a pot experiment. VAM colonization increased as rock phosphate application increased. Using phosphorus concentration in pinnules as an indicator of VAM activity, significant VAM activity occurred at 25 days after planting at the lower levels of rock phosphate application (0, 0.34 and 0.68 g P kg-1). The time required for significant VAM activity was shortened by 5 days at the higher P levels (1.36, 2.72 and 5.44 g P kg-1). The highest VAM activity was associated with the highest rate of rock phosphate application. Inoculation with G. aggregatum significantly increased the uptake of Cu, P and Zn and dry-matter yield at all levels of rock phosphate applied. Copper concentrations in roots of mycorrhizal Leucaena were significantly higher than that of shoots. The results indicated that Leucaena in symbiotic association with VAM fungi effectively utilized P from rock phosphate. However, high rates of rock phosphate are required to attain growth comparable to that obtained with the application of water-soluble phosphate. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

TI  - A comparison of cold tolerance and biomass production in Leucaena leucocephala L. pulverulenta and L. retusa
PY  - 1987

AB  - Expansion of leucaena into temperate regions of the world will require additional tolerance to freezing stress. Leucaena leucocephala may be the most widely tested woody legume in the last 15 years. Leucaena pulverulenta and Leucaena retusa are two species with more cold tolerance than L. leucocephala. A screening trial with 38 accessions of L. pulverulenta, 26 of L. leucocephala, and 1 of L. retusa was begun in 1983 at Kingsville, Texas where freezing temperatures may occur every year. A biomass production trial using L. leucocephala (K-8) was planted in 1982 to evaluate the biomass production of this widely used strain under semi-arid conditions with minimum fertilizer inputs and no irrigation. Biomass estimations were made with regression equations that predicted weight from log10 basal stem diameter measurements. The trees in both trials were harvested after a - 12°C freeze in December 1983 killed all trees except L. retusa to ground level. Less severe freezes in 1984-1985 of - 7°C and - 9°C killed all L. leucocephala to ground level whereas less than 2% of the L. pulverulenta were killed to ground level, thus demonstrating the difference in cold tolerance between these two species. Dry wood production in the screening trial of the L. leucocephala after 10 months' coppice growth ranged from 654 to 3602 g dry biomass per tree and that of the L. pulverulenta during the same period ranged from 437 to 2505 g dry biomass per tree. Dry wood productivity of L. leucocephala (K-8) 1-year coppice growth ranged from 1.4 t ha-1 on a poorly drained soil to 10 t ha-1 on a moderately drained soil. © 1987.

AB  - In actively growing stems of Leucaena leucocephala, new leaves were tagged weekly. All leaves were harvested after 10 weeks and analysed for mimosine, tannin, flavonol glycosides, protein and neutral detergent fibre. Mimosine was highest in the young leaf at 45 g/kg dry weight and declined to 2 g/kg in 10-week-old leaf. Protein also decreased from about 31 to 14 g/100 g during development but there were no substantial changes in fibre, tannin or phenolic concentrations. © 1986, CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - A protocol for hardening of microprogated plants of Leucaena leucocephala in vitro is described which ensures up to 85% survival of plants following their transfer to pots or garden beds. Morpho-physiological studies confirm the earlier reports that cultured plants have poor control of water loss. Their leaves had very little epicuticular wax and lacked starch grains in their cells. Interestingly, the leaf cells at the shoot multiplication stage appeared normal. Reduction in their size and abnormality of shape appeared first during the rooting stage in vitro. During hardening the appearance of starch grains preceded the normalization of mesophyll cells. © 1987.

AB  - Cattle and goats in Australia lack the ability to totally degrade 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone, also known as 3,4-dihydroxy pyridine (3,4 DHP), the ruminal metabolite of mimosine, a toxic aminoacid present in the leguminous shrub Leucaena leucocephala. Ruminants in Hawaii have this capacity due to the presence of micro-organisms able to rapidly degrade the DHP. A mixed bacterial population capable of rapidly degrading DHP in vitro was isolated from a goat on the island of Maui. Cultures were grown anaerobically, without added sugars, in Medium 98-5 containing DHP. Cultures at a dilution of 10(-12) from the original rumen fluid were introduced into Townsville and further sub-cultured and multiplied in vitro in strict isolation at the Oonoonba Veterinary Laboratory, Townsville. Infusion of the culture into a goat and a steer fed a 100% leucaena diet resulted in cessation of DHP excretion in the urine. After 60 days the serum thyroxine levels and thyroid size were normal and there were no clinical signs of disease. The ability of the rumen fluid to degrade DHP in vitro showed that the bacteria had become established in the rumen. In the absence of any disease in the animals, clearance has been given for the wider use of these cultures in areas where leucaena is grown. The limited evidence suggests that the leucaena toxicity problem can be solved by the use of these introduced bacteria.

AB  - Plant growth characteristics, nutrient absorption and water relations were compared for plants of Leucaena leucocephala (Larn.) de Wir that were non‐mycorthizal and those that were infected with the vesicular‐arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungus Glomus fasciculatum (Thaxter sensu Gerd.) Gerd. and Trappe. Mycorrhizal plants had substantially greater shoot and root dry weight, leaf area and root length than non‐mycorrhizal plants, and alsos greater P, K, and Ca uptake. Leaf area was over five times greater and leaf conductance to water vapour diffusion was nearly twice as great for mycorrhizal plants, yet the difference between xylem pressure potential and soil water potential were considerably less in mycorrhizal plants than in non‐mycorhizal plants. Stomatal responses to the humidity deficits of the air during the day were nearly twice as great in mycorrhizal plants. Leaflet folding and orientation responses to avoide direct sunlight during the day were also much greater in non‐mycorrhizal plants. Lower leaf conductances and increased leaf folding leading to less absorption of sunlight may contribute significantly to the reduction in growth rate observed in non‐mycorrhizal plants.

AB  - Field trials were carried out on an Oxic Paleustalf in the humid zone of southwestern Nigeria with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Steud. and Sesbania grandiflora (L.) Pers. alley cropped with maize and cowpea. The three leguminous woody species were grown in hedgerows spaced at 2 m. Trials were carried out one year after establishment of the hedgerows using a split-plot design with four replications. The Leucaena trial had twenty pruning combinations consisting of five pruning heights (25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 cm) and four pruning frequencies (monthly, bi-, tri- and six-monthly). The Gliricidia and Sesbania hedgerows were subjected to nine pruning intensities consisting of three pruning heights (25, 50 and 100 cm) and three pruning intensities (monthly, tri- and six-monthly). For the three woody species, biomass, dry wood and nitrogen yield from the hedgerow prunings increased with decreasing pruning frequency and increasing pruning height. Biomass, dry wood and nitrogen yields were in the following order Leucaena >Gliricidia >Sesbania. The various pruning intensities had no effect on survival of Leucaena plants. Pruning frequency had a larger effect than pruning height on survival of Gliricidia and Sesbania plants. With monthly pruning, about 25 percent of the Gliricidia and all of the Sesbania plants died within six months of repeated pruning. Even with lower pruning frequency Sesbania plants showed lower survival rates than Gliricidia or Leucaena. The various pruning intensities of all the hedgerow species had more pronounced effects on the grain yield of the alley cropped cowpea than on maize grain yield. Higher maize and cowpea yields were obtained with increasing pruning frequency and decreasing pruning height. © 1988 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.

AB  - The potential of alley cropping maize and cowpea with the giant Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit) cultivar K-28 was studied on an Entisol (Psammentic Ustorthent) in Southern Nigeria. In this trial the crops were grown in 4 m wide alleys formed by periodically pruned leucaena hedgerows. The effect of application of leucaena prunings, nitrogen fertilizer and tillage was studied. Despite the very intensive pruning regime (five prunings/year) for a six-year period, the leucaena hedgerows continue to produce substantial amounts of prunings, nitrogen yield and stakes. Application of nitrogen to the maize crop increased dry matter and nitrogen yield from the leucaena prunings. Although high nitrogen yield was obtained from the prunings, the application of low nitrogen rates was still needed for obtaining a high maize yield. Maize grain yield can be sustained at about 2.0 t/ha with continuous application of leucacna prunings only. Without application of leucaena prunings and nitrogen maize yield continued to decline with subsequent croppings. Cowpea grain yield was not affected either by leucaena prunings or by residual nitrogen. Tillage (rototilling) resulted in either higher or the same maize and cowpea yields as compared with no-tillage. Application of leucaena prunings resulted in higher soil moisture retention, organic matter, exchangeable K, Ca, Mg, and also nitrate levels in the soil solution. Leucaena and maize appear to extract soil moisture from different zones in the soil. Timely pruning of hedgerows is necessary to minimize shading. © 1985 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W. Junk Publishers.

AB  - Animal and pasture production were measured from 1975 to 1980 on pastures based on Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham or cv. Peru, with Setaria sphacelata, at Samford, south-eastern Queensland. Pastures were rotationally grazed with stocking rates ranging throughout the year from 1.3 beasts/ha (winter) to 4.0 beasts/ha (summer). The cv. Cunningham pastures produced 427 kg liveweight gain/ha.year, and the cv. Peru pastures 358 kg/ha. year. The productivity of leucaena and its percentage in the diet of animals was consistently higher with cv. Cunningham than with cv. Peru. The average thyroid size of animals grazing year long was 50 and 147 g for cv. Peru and cv. Cunningham pastures (normal weights being µ 25 g) although thyroxine levels measured in early autumn were never suggestive of serious thyroxine deficiency. Thus the higher productivity and consumption of leucaena on cv. Cunningham pastures, due to a higher density of plants and greater productivity per plant, resulted in better animal production than was obtained from cv. Peru pastures, despite the thyroid enlargement of animals grazing cv. Cunningham. It is concluded that there is potential for commercial use of leucaena-based pastures in subtropical eastern Australia. © 1984 ASEG.

AB  - A tissue culture method is described for clonal multiplication of Leucaena leucocephala K67 using single lateral bud explants from 2-3 m tall greenhouse grown trees. N-6 benzyladenine (BA: 3.0 mg.1-1) and napthaleneacetic acid (NAA: 0.05 mg.1-1) in Murashige & Skoog's (MS) medium were found to be best suited for multiple shoot differentiation in 4-5 week old cultures. Analysis of variance of the main treatment effects of BA and NAA on shoot parameters showed that BA significantly (P=0.001) affected shoot development while NAA did not. A shoot multiplication rate of 22±3.63 shoots per bud explant was obtained in 150 days on 1/2 strength MS medium with 3.0 mg.1-1 BA and 0.05 mg.1-1 NAA.

AB  - Enzymes present in Leucaena leucocephala can rapidly degrade mimosine to 3‐hydroxy‐4‐1(H)pyridone (DHP). At 45°C, half of the mimosine in macerated leaves is degraded in 4 min. This activity is confined to leaflets and lamina of the young pod, although mimosine also occurs in other tissues. Simple processing can give a leaf meal largely free from minosine, or can break down most of the mimosine in pods used as human food; the problem then becomes that of the toxicity of DHP. Leaf autolysis can be utilised to prepare DHP. Copyright © 1983 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - From 1980 to 1983, a study was carried out to determine the effect of intercropped Leucaena leucocephala (at various spacings) with maize and beans on fodder and wood production and on crop yields. Fodder production initially was assessed at 14 months by pruning the lower halves of trees. The trees were clipped 1 m above the ground at 23 months of age and subsequently at 3-monthly intervals. Crop yields were assessed for four cropping seasons. Mean per-tree wood volumes at 23 months were 23 dm3 (clean-weeded), 18 dm3 (intercropped with beans) and 15 dm3 intercropped with maize. In relation to espacements, mean per-tree wood volumes ranged from 15 dm3 (1 × 3 m) to 30 dm3 (1 × 6 m), representing an overall per-ha wood volume of 42.9 m3 ha-1. While management regimes did not have significant effects, the per-tree fodder yields increased with hedgerow spacing. On an area basis, yield was consistent at 3 t ha-1 year-1 (dry weight) representing a per-ha nutrient drain estimated at 87 kg nitrogen, 42 kg potassium, 20 kg calcium, 8 kg magnesium and 5 kg phosphorus. Shading effects from trees depressed yields of food crops in the second season, but once 3-monthly hedgerow pruning began this problem was overcome and normal food yields resumed. The implication of these results for meeting fodder and wood needs and for long-term production schedules are discussed. © 1987.

Prolonged soaking of leaves was most effective, and virtually all the mimosine was degraded after 48 hours' submergence in water at 30°C. Copyright © 1987 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Seed number per pod is negatively skewed in Leucaena leucocephala. Post-fertilisation abortion of pods does not completely explain the skewed distribution. It is shown that a pre-fertilisation regulation effectively restricts the formation of pods with less than a certain number of seeds. The regulation is rendered through the inhibition of pollen grain germination by the stigmatic fluid when the pollen grain is less than a certain critical load in the stigma. Such a control is shown to have implications in the evolution of pollen package units, generation of male gametophytic competition and the economy of packing seeds in pods. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Strain NGR234 is a broad host range Rhizobium which can effectively nodulate a broad spectrum of legumes. Ninety mutants with altered exopolysaccharide production were isolated after strain NGR234 was subjected to transposon Tn5 mutagenesis. These mutants were classified on the basis of their physiological properties into 9 groups. Their symbiotic porperties were tested on four legumes which form spherical (determinate) nodules (Macroptilium atropurpureum, Desmodium intortum, Desmodium uncinatum and Lablab purpureus) and on the legume Leucaena leucocephala which forms cylindrical (indeterminate) nodules. On these plants strain NGR234 forms nitrogen-fixing nodules (Nod+Fix+). The results from the testing of the various mucoid-defective mutants on these plants show that it is possible to alter the synthesis of the surface polysaccharides of strain NGR234 and produce a narrow host range Nod+Fix+Rhizobium. © 1985, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

AB  - The growth of two lines of Leucaena leucocephala, four lines of L. pulverulenta, and 19 hybrids between the two species was studied in the glasshouse and in the field. Although the hybrids initially grew more slowly than the control L. leucocephala lines, most outgrew them in the field, yielding up to 50% more edible material (with about 80% of the mimosine level), and up to 100% more non-edible material. It is concluded that these hybrids have considerable potential, especially as dual purpose (forage/fuel) plants. A strategy for producing hybrid seed under field conditions is proposed. © 1984 ASEG.

AB  - Daily injections of thyroxine were ineffective in overcoming the toxic effects of feeding Leucaena to goats. The treated goats did not differ from the controls in liveweight change or body condition over the 15 weeks of feeding Leucaena and both groups of animals developed oesophageal lesions. Treated animals maintained normal serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels and did not exhibit the thyroid hyperplasia of the controls. An increase in the serum T4 and T3 levels of three of the control animals after 5 weeks of feeding was associated with declining mimosine concentration in the feed and the ability of the hyperplastic thyroids to produce sufficient T4. Serum analyses suggested zinc deficiency in the control animals, associated with their low thyroid status. It was concluded that the goitrogenicity of 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone (DHP) is only partly responsible for the toxicity of Leucaena to ruminants, and that the low feed intakes and low liveweight gains are related to other effects of DHP. The evidence for extra-ruminal metabolism of DHP is discussed. © 1983, CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - Weed control strategies were evaluated for Prosopis alba and Leucaena leucocephala in south Texas for site preparation prior to transplanting, during initial establishment of transplanted seedlings, and for mature plantings. In site preparation, glyphosate has been used prior to deep tillage to eliminate perennial grasses such as Cynodon dactylon, Sorghum halepense, and Cenchrus ciliaris. Moderately expensive, preemergence row crop herbicides that have short residuals (45-90 days) but low toxicity to seedlings have been examined for use at transplant. These herbicides included oryzalin, oxyfluorfen, napropamide, atrazine, linuron, metolachlor, and alachlor. The most effective herbicide was oryzalin at 2.8 kg ha-1, which gave a 30% increase in survival and a 300-400% increase in biomass for Prosopis alba and Leucaena leucocephala over non-cultivated, non-herbicide treated control plots. Tree growth following preemergence/transplant herbicide treatment was compared to mechanical weed control using a single row sweep cultivator. In 1983 and 1984 cultivation alone doubled the biomass productivity of Prosopis and Leucaena, while use of herbicides increased productivity only 30% over the cultivation-alone treatment. Long residual (180 day), inexpensive herbicides that are not particularly safe for use at transplant were examined at two rates on 2.5 y old Prosopis alba trees. These herbicides included DCPA, diuron, norflurazon, simazine, bromacil and bromacil/diuron combinations. Bromacil was phytotoxic at the lowest rate (0.25 kg ha-1), and simazine was phytotoxic at 4.5 kg ha-1. Diuron provided the most cost effective weed control where perennial grasses were not present. The more costly norflurazon controlled problem perennial grasses Cynodon dactylon and Sorghum halepense. © 1986.

AB  - Field and pot trials were conducted to determine optimum management practices for using Leucaena leucocephala (Lam. de Wit) leaves as a N source for crop production. Field trials with maize showed no benefit from split application of leucaena leaves or from application of fresh as opposed to dried material. Field trials also failed to show any difference between incorporation as opposed to surface application of leucaena leaves. This may be attributed to the low nitrogen response observed. Pot trials however, showed that soil incorporation of leucaena leaves was more effective than surface application in increasing plant dry weight. Leucaena leaves were not as effective as inorganic N in increasing maize grain yield (field trials) or dry matter production (pot trial). Unlike inorganic N, leucaena leaves had a significant residual effect on the succeeding maize crop. In decomposition studies, buried leucaena leaves decomposed more quickly than surface-applied leaves, and fresh leaves decomposed more rapidly than dried leaves. © 1985 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

AB  - The present study examined the wood and fodder productivity of Leucaena leucocephala (LAM) de Wit, Prosopis juliflora (SW) DC, Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh, Eucalyptus crebra Muell., and Anadenanthera macrocarpa (Benth) Brenan, planted in Petrolina, Pernambuco State, as a semiarid zone in northeastern Brazil. The seedlings were planted in a plowed and harrowed field at a spacing of 3×2 m. Average height and survival rates were measured 1, 3, and 5 y after planting. A wood volume estimate was made 5 y after planting. The wood productivity of Prosopis, 15 m3 ha-1, was superior to Leucaena (11 m3 ha-1). Both species had lower productivity than E. crebra000 (24 m3 ha-1), but greater than E. camaldulensis (10 m3 ha-1) and A. macrocarpa (3 m3 ha-1). These productivity values are low compared to those of humid region species, but moderate for the semiarid zone, in relation to the wood productivity of 'caatinga' vegetation. The fodder productivity of Leucaena was 7.5 metric t of dry matter per ha per year. The pod productivity of Prosopis was estimated to be 6 t per ha per year. © 1986.

AB  - The pods of Acacia koa, Canavalia cathartica, Leucaena leucocephala, Samanea saman and six other leguminous species lose as much as 75-85 % of their tissue water during maturation, but show no loss in tissue mercury content. Unlike fruit, seeds not only lose most of their water content, but also at least 75 % of their mercury during the maturation process. It is suggested that selective elimination is more likely to take place by bio-volatilization rather than by translocation, and that the phenomenon allows for detoxification of a cytogenetically hazardous chemical substance. © 1985.

TI  - Leucaena leucocephala leaves in formulated feed for Penaeus monodon: a concrete example of the application of histology in nutrition research
PY  - 1986

AB  - Penaeus monodon postlarvae were fed with formulated diets containing either soaked or unsoaked Leucaena leaves. A similarly prepared feed with soybean in place of Leucaena was used for comparison. Results were analysed by statistical and histological methods. Results of the 4-week feeding experiment showed that mean weight gains and percentage survival of the prawns fed with the two Leucaena-containing diets were higher, but not significantly different from soybean-containing diet. The content of the poisonous amino acid mimosine in the Leucaena leaves could be reduced about 70% by soaking the leaves in freshwater for 24 h. Highest weight gain was obtained with the feed containing these soaked leaves. In addition to growth and survival, the R-cells of the midgut glands of the postlarvae were investigated by light and electron microscopy. Although the statistical growth values and the proximate analyses of the test diets were similar, a food-specific ultrastructure was established after only 4 days of feeding. All diets resulted in subcellular characteristics typical for well fed prawns and, at that time, the Leucaena diets were already slightly superior to the soybean control. This indicates that different sources of macronutrients lead to different ultrastructures even if the proximate analyses of protein, carbohydrate and lipid are similar. Only slight changes in the R-cells were observed after 11, 20 and 28 days in the prawns fed with the soybean diet compared to 4 days of feeding. In the diet containing unsoaked Leucaena leaves, however, many R-cells became heavily damaged after 20 and 28 days, whereas the prawns fed with the diet containing soaked leaves exhibited less pronounced distortion. Statistical analyses of growth and survival rate did not show these adverse effects at that time. Although it is highly probable that the mimosine is responsible for those pathological symptoms, complementary experiments could not clearly prove that. The effects of feed components are visible on the cellular or organ level after only a few days, whereas the individuals (organism level) reflect them about 10 days later. Another 10 days later the changes are manifested in the population. Therefore it is suggested to use histology in nutrition studies as a supplementary source of information to statistical and biochemical parameters. The midgut glands can further be used to monitor the nutritional condition of prawns in aquaculture, sea ranching, and in ecological investigations. The study confirms that Leucaena leaves are a promising protein source for prawn diets if mimosine could be reduced to a very low level. A mimosine level of 0.25% in the feed is still too high, if the diet is used uninterruptedly for several weeks. © 1986.

AB  - In the low rainfall tract of Western Maharashtra, the degraded area that can be called a desert in the making is 2.28 million ha out of a total of 5.7 million ha or 40% of the area. The main causes of this desertification are overcultivation coupled with deforestation and overgrazing. The problem is made more acute by the increasing human and animal population, and the fact that rainfall is undependable and of high intensity. The trend of desertification can be reversed by (a) closing the area to grazing and uncontrolled wood cutting, (b) implementation of time-tested soil and water conservation measures and (c) large scale planting of suitable forage grasses and legumes as well as arid zone species of trees. The main research thrust of the trials with promising species of trees was to determine their suitability to wastelands and to investigate methods of establishing them rapidly and economically. Thus the effect of fertilization and spacing was examined for the following eight tree species: Acacia albida, A. nilotica var. cupressiformis, A. nilotica var. indica, Albizia lebbek, Cassia siamea, Dalbergia sissoo, Leucaena leucocephala, Melia azedarach and Prosopis juliflora. The two spacings used were 5 × 0.6 m and 3 × 1 m and the three fertilizer doses were 0:0:0, 50:50:50 and 100:100:100 kg N:P2O5:K2O per ha. A factorial design with nine plant selections, three fertilizer treatments, two spacings and three replicates was used. A total of seven irrigations were applied from October 1983 to February 1984. At 15 months of age the average basal stem diameters of L. leucocephala and M. azedarach were significantly superior to all the other species. The average plant height of L. leucocephala, at 2.38 m, was superior to all other species. The use of fertilizer led to significant improvements in performance; however, there was little difference between using a dose of 50 kg ha-1 or 100 kg ha-1. An interaction was found to exist between the species and spacings. L. leucocephala and M. azedarach showed better performance at the spacing of 5 × 0.6 m and D. sissoo and P. juliflora performed better at 3 × 1 m. C. siamea at 62% had the lowest survival rate. © 1986.

AB  - Growth performance and mimosine output in excreta have been measured in young chicks fed on diets containing three forms of Leucaena leaf meal (LLM) imported from Malawi. In one of the experiments, the effects of supplementation of LLM with selected metal ions and enzymes were also measured. Growth and efficiency of food utilisation were similar in groups fed on a control soya bean meal diet or a basal diet containing 150 g kg-1 of the whole leaf (WL) form of LLM. Supplementation of this basal LLM diet with FeSO4 or Al2(SO4)3 had little effect on growth or efficiency of food utilisation, but the ratio of mimosine output to mimosine ingested (MO/MI) increased from 0.781 to 0.881 and 1.003 on addition of FeSO4 and Al2(SO4)3, respectively. Growth performance was unaffected by the addition of an enzyme mixture (containing cellulase, acid and neutral proteases and alpha amylase) to the basal LLM diet. In the second experiment, two other forms of LLM were also tested: a ground leaf (GL) form, and a powder produced by grinding pellets of Leucaena leaf (GP). The WL and GP forms were each added at 50 and 100 g kg-1 diet, and the GL form at 100 g kg-1 diet. These diets permitted daily intakes of mimosine ranging from 80 to 350 mg per replicate of 4 chicks. In comparison with control groups, growth performance was not impaired significantly in any of the LLM-fed groups. Mimosine excretion was high in all LLM-fed groups, the GP form inducing a maximum MO/MI ratio of 0.924. © 1982.

AB  - The chemical composition of the green, fully ripened pods and seeds of Leucaena leucocephala shows some variation in their nutrient contents in different genotypes. Green pods are a rich source of protein and well comparable with the protein content of leguminous seeds. The structural carbohydrate varies significantly. Green pods are of dual importance to supply fibre and nutrients. The empty fully ripened pods are fibrous. The seeds, besides having rich protein content, have 20 – 25% galactomannan gum which has the potential to be used as a laxative and in vegetable soups. Mimosine content is higher in the green pods, but it is thermolabile. Copyright © 1985 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Field and glasshouse experiments were conducted on an acidic red-yellow podzolic soil of low nitrogen status from south-eastern Queensland to examine the use of nitrogen and lime in promoting leucaena growth. In the field, application of 25 kg nitrogen ha-l at planting increased shoot dry weight by 77, 88, 52 and 51% at weeks 5, 15, 32 and 52 respectively. Equivalent responses to lime (2.5 t ha-1) were 8, 3 1, 64 and 74% respectively. In the glasshouse, shoot, root and nodule dry weights were increased by nitrogen application rates of 50, 100 and 200 kg ha-1. Number, size and dry weight of nodules were suppressed at the highest rate (400 kg ha-1). Nitrogen concentration in youngest fully expanded leaves was increased to over 5% by nitrogen, and a critical nitrogen content of 4.5% (90% of maximum growth) is suggested. Inexplicably, lime application reduced shoot, root and nodule weights at high nitrogen applications. The apparent partial effectiveness of commercial leucaena Rhizobium and the implications of starter nitrogen and lime for leucaena establishment are discussed. © 1986, CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - DNA homologies at 65°C in 0.14 phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, were determined between 24 strains of Rhizobium capable of nodulating Leucaena leucocephala and four Rhizobium reference strains. Twenty-one strains (88%) were placed in one of four DNA homology groups. The mean relative homology within a group was 65%, while the mean relative homology between groups was 20%. Thermal melting points for reassociated DNA (ΔTm(e) values) were also measured. The lack of DNA homology between groups indicates that several very different populations of bacteria are capable of nodulating and fixing nitrogen with leucaena. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to determine the suitability of treated Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal as an ingredient for Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus Linn., feed. Nine experimental diets were formulated to contain 25%, 50% and 100% of the total dietary protein as plant protein using soaked (soaked in water at 30°C for 48 h), sundried (sundried for 2 days) and commercial Leucaena leaf meal, balanced by protein from fish meal. A control diet with fish meal as the only protein source was included. All diets were isonitrogenous (30% protein) except for diets containing 100% plant protein (21% protein). The 70-day feeding trial was conducted with duplicated treatments in 2-m3 circular concrete tanks with recirculating water. There was a trend of reduced growth performance and feed utilization efficiency with increase in Leucaena leaf meal incorporation for all treatments. Generally, soaked leaf meal gave a significantly better growth response than sundried or commercial leaf meal. Mimosine present in the latter two treatments may have contributed to the poorer growth. © 1987.

AB  - Daily supplements of dried Leucaena leaf meal (500 g/head) were offered for 3 weeks to steers in metabolism cages. The steers had previously been fed diets of oaten chaff (5 kg/head /day) ormclasses and urea (4–5 kg/head/day) with restricted forage (2 kg/head/ day). Excretion rates of the primary degradation product of mimosine, 3-hydroxy-4(lH) pyridone (DHP) by steers fed the two diets were compared. These compounds appeared in urine on the 1st day after Leucaena feeding had commenced and output remained fairly constant after 4 days. Mean weekly urinary outputs (g) of DHP from steers fed the oaten chaff or molasses + urea diet were 13.45 and 7.50 respectively. These levels corresponded to 0.23 and 0.13 of the amounts ingested. When steers were fed the molasses + urea diet, DHP continued to appear in urine up to 5 days after Leucaena had been withdrawn from the diet. On the oaten chaff diet no DHP was detected after 3 days following withdrawal of Leucaena. The effects of casein or formaldehyde treated casein supplements on the output of urinary DHP by steers fed oaten chaff plus Leucaena was evaluated in a second experiment which ran concurrently. The animals were fed the test diets for 3 weeks before collections were made. Mean DHP outputs (g/day) from animals fed the control diet, control diet plus casein or control diet plus formaldehyde treated casein were 1.89, 2.21 and 2.44 respectively. These results confirm substantial degradation of DHP and that the extent of degradation can be affected by the dietary regime in which Leucaena is fed. © 1984, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - A study was made of the rate of degradation of mimosine to 3‐hydroxy‐4(1H)‐pyridone in harvested leucaena leaf under various conditions. Optimum rates of degradation of an aqueous leucaena slurry were at pH 8.0 and 45°C with virtual total loss of mimosine in 10 min. Heating the intact leaf also reduced the mimosine content with the maximum rate of degradation at 70°C. The results have implications for reducing the toxicity of leucaena used for stock feed.

The 15N concentrations of non-nodular tissues of nodulated plants were close to the value of atmospheric N2. The nodules of soybean, mung bean, cowpea, kidney bean, adzuki bean, sword bean, white clover, Leucaena leucocephala, and horsegram showed highly elevated 15N concentrations, and those of pea had a slightly enriched 15N concentration compared to other tissue, while the nodules of peanut and lucerne had 15N values similar to those of their shoot tissues. The bacteroid fractions from horsegram, sword bean and peanut had higher 15N concentrations than the cytosol fractions. © 1984 The Japanese Society of Plant Physiologists.

AB  - Utilisation of domestic sewage, treated in a stabilization pond, for growing orange (Citrus reticulata var - Nagpur Orange), forest and verge plants was initiated at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur in 1978. The irrigation quality of the stabilization pond effluent (SPE) was compared with that of well waters of NEERI and at the orange farms of Katol and Warud (35 to 55 km north of Nagpur). The SPE was found to be comparable with these well waters. Soils on NEERI fields were also found comparable with those of some of the orange farms at Warud and Katol. Irrigation scheduling was formulated for oranges at NEERI. To study effects of SPE irrigation, some of the orange plants were irrigated with well water and others with the SPE. Fruiting on most of the plants was not regulated; effluent irrigated plant leaves exhibited similar osmotic concentration but higher succulence than well water irrigated plant leaves; there was an increase in potassium, decrease in sodium and no effect in calcium content in the water extracts of SPE irrigated leaves. Amongst the forest and verge plants, Cassia siamia, Peltophorum inerme, Enterolobium saman, Casuarina equisetifolia, Eucalyptus citrodora, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Terminalia catappa and Leucaena glauca responded well to SPE irrigation, though the response varied with the soil conditions. A garden developed around pilot sewage treatment plants clearly demonstrates scientific reuse of treated sewage for creating an appealing landscape and beautification of otherwise discarded areas.

AB  - Mimosine was qualitatively and quantitatively estimated from the different parts of Leucaena leucocephala strains K-8 and K-67. The amount of mimosine as percentage of dry weight in the two strains were, respectively, as follows: seeds, 6.82, 9.98; old leaves, 1.5, 1.33; young leaves, 2.85, 3.33; main root, 1.13, 1.02; lateral roots, 1.46, 1.17; stems, 0.73, 0.33. Rhizobium isolates from L. leucocephala (UAS-Ll-8, UAS-Ll-67), Mimosa pudica (UAS-Mp) and Prosopis juliflora (UAS-Pj) formed an effective (nod+ fix+) association with Leucaena, while an isolate from Crotalaria sp. (UAS-Cr) proved to be ineffective (nod+ fix-). All isolates performed better than reference strain TAL-82. Strain UAS-Pj gave optimum nodulation and plant growth characteristics. The effect of mimosine on the vegetative Rhizobium cultures was studied by the lawn method of growing rhizobia, using 2.5 to 15 mg·ml-1 mimosine. All the effective strains were stimulated by mimosine up to 7.5 mg·ml-1strains. UAS-Ll-8 and UAS-Ll-67 were stimulated up to 15 mg·ml-1 of mimosine. The ineffective strain UAS-Cr was inhibited at all the concentrations of mimosine tried. © 1985, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart. All rights reserved.

AB  - To examine the apparent absence of toxicity in ruminants fed on Leucaena leucocephala in Hawaii, U.S.A., goats were offered comparable diets of Leucaena and lucerne chaff (control) in both Australia and Hawaii over a 7-week period. Intake of mimosine, excretion of the ruminal metabolite 3-hydroxy- 4(1H)-pyridone (DHP), and serum concentrations of thyroxine (T4) were measured in both studies. Mean mimosine intakes on the highest Leucaena diets in Australia and Hawaii were similar at about 20 g day-1. In Australia, goats on the all-Leucaena diets became hypothyroid after only 3 weeks of feeding, thyroid glands were enlarged and erosion of the oesophageal mucosa and reticulo-rumen occurred. Excretion of DHP in the urine was related to the daily mirnosine intakes, with recoveries of about 86%. In marked contrast, goats fed on Leucaena in Hawaii exhibited no clinical signs of toxicity and excreted less than 1% of the mirnosine intake as DHP in the urine. No degradation of DHP occurred in vitro with rumen fluid from Australian goats, whereas 71% of the added DHP was degraded after 5 h with rumen fluid from goats in Hawaii. The results support the hypothesis that the differences observed are attributable to a different microbial metabolism of mimosine and DHP in ruminants in Hawaii. © 1983, CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala plantations in Kaoshu, southern Taiwan, exhibit, after several years of growth, a unique pattern of weed exclusion beneath Leucaena canopy. The pattern has been observed in many Leucaena plantations in Taiwan and is particularly pronounced in the area where a substantial amount of Leucaena litter has accumulated on the ground. Field data showed that the phenomenon was primarily not due to physical competition involving light, soil moisture, pH, and nutrients. Instead, aqueous extracts of Leucaena fresh leaves, litter, soil, and seed exudate showed significantly phytotoxic effects on many test species, including rice, lettuce, Acacia confusa, Alnus formosana, Casuarina glauca, Liquidambar formosana, and Mimosa pudica. However, the extracts were not toxic to the growth of Leucaena seedlings. The decomposing leaves of Leucaena also suppressed the growth of the aforementioned plants grown in pots but did not inhibit that of Leucaena plants. By means of paper and thin-layer chromatography, UV-visible spectrophotometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography, 10 phytotoxins were identified. They included mimosine, quercetin, and gallic, protocatechuic, p-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxyphenylacetic, vanillic, ferulic, caffeic, and p-coumaric acids. The mature leaves of Leucaena possess about 5% dry weight of mimosine, the amount varying with varieties. The seed germination and radicle growth of lettuce, rice, and rye grass were significantly inhibited by aqueous mimosine solution at a concentration of 20 ppm, while that of the forest species mentioned was suppressed by the mimosine solution at 50 ppm or above. However, the growth of Miscanthus floridulus and Pinus taiwanensis was not suppressed by the mimosine solution at 200 ppm. The seedlings of Ageratum conzoides died in mimosine solution at 50 ppm within seven days and wilted at 300 ppm within three days. It was concluded that the exclusion of understory plants was evidently due to the allelopathic effect of compounds produced by Leucaena. The allelopathic pattern was clearly shown in the area with a heavy accumulation of Leucaena leaf litter, which was a result of drought and heavy wind influence. © 1986 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - The true digestibility of casein, gelatin, fish meal, defatted soybean meal and Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal was measured in 60- and 175-g milkfish (Chanos chanos Forsskal) in fresh- and seawater. The diets contained 45% of these feedstuffs and 1.3% of the indicator substance, chromic oxide. The intestinal dissection method was used to collect fecal material. Results showed that the length of time between initial feeding and fish sacrifice did not significantly affect digestibility. Gelatin was the most digestible (90-98%) protein, regardless of size. Casein, defatted soybean meal and fish meal were moderately digestible (50-90%) and digestibility coefficients tended to increase as a function of fish size. L. leucocephala was the least digestible (-10-40%). The digestibility of most of these feedstuffs was less in the anterior than in the posterior intestine, and tended to be lower in seawater than in freshwater. Rate of food movement was similar in both size groups, but was significantly faster when milkfish were in seawater rather than in freshwater. The effect of salinity on digestibility may in part be due to food motility changes necessitated by alterations in osmoregulatory processes when fish are in seawater. © 1986.

AB  - The field study of berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) in association with trees indicated that forage production was highest under Hardwickia binata allowing 80 per cent PAR of open as compared to Acacia tortilis and Leucaena leucocephala with 65 and 48 per cent PAR respectively. The forage yields of berseem were 78, 57 and 36 per cent under Hardwicka, Acacia and Leucaena respectively to that under non‐tree association (open canopy). The tree associations helped in improving soil productivity. Organic carbon, available nitrogen and phosphorus, field capacity and soil porosity increased, whereas EC and bulk density decreased under plots with tree associations in the order of Leucaena followed by Acacia and Hardwickia. The phosphate application improved the forage yield and P uptake and utilization. It has also helped in higher organic carbon and available N and P content of soil and also improved the water retention properties of soil by increasing field capacity and pore space and lowering the bulk density, P application to crops at increased rates also reduced the ill effects of radiation curtailment under tree canopy to some degree. The forage yields of berseem were greatly influenced by P application under both the canopy systems (tree and non‐tree). Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Seasonal changes in litter components were measured in a closed Leucaena leucocephala forest stand in Chichijima, Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, situated in a wet subtropical climate. The phytomass of the stand was estimated as 5.62, 1.47 and 0.448 kg d.w. m-2 for stems, branches and leaves, respectively. Litter from the canopy was collected semimonthly by ten 0.5 m2 traps. Leaf-litter production rate was low in spring, medium in summer and autumn, and peaked in mid-winter. Annual production of leaf-litter was 498 g d.w. m-2. Annual turnover rate of canopy leaves was 1.1. Flower-litter showed biannual production with peaks in spring and autumn, and the former peak largely exceeded the latter one in quantity. Seed maturation needed about 3 months. Annual production of reproductive organs was 89.2, 89.4, 19.1 and 99.4 g d.w. m-2 for flowers, mature seeds, immature ones and pods, respectively. Number, of mature seeds disseminated exceeded 2,500 m-2. Annual production of branch- and bark-litter was 345 g d.w.m-2. Annual amount of plant litter from the canopy was as large as 1,150 g d.w. m-2, showing higher productivity and higher rate of matter turnover in this forest than in temperate forests. © 1984 The Botanical Society of Japan.

AB  - The incorporation of molasses (22.5 and 45.0 kg t−1, fresh wt basis) with chopped whole‐plant leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) at the time of ensiling, increased the rate of fermentation as compared to the control (no molasses). The silage (leucaenalage) prepared with molasses had a lower pH, higher residual water‐soluble carbohydrates, greater quantities of acetic and lactic acid and lower levels of volatile nitrogen, non‐protein nitrogen and free amino acids than did the leucaenalage containing no molasses. The extent of these changes increased as the level of the molasses was increased. Copyright © 1984 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The infection of the tropical legume Leucaena leucocephala by the broad-host-range, fast-growing Rhizobium strain NGR234 was studied using both light and electron microscopy. Rhizobium infection of Leucaena was shown to be via infection threads formed in root hairs. Electron microscopic studies revealed both inter- and intra-cellular infection threads in nitrogen-fixing nodules. Root hair deformation and infection was mostly on lateral roots but occasionally found on the taproot. The lateral roots appeared on plants 3 days after two and half day-old seedlings were transferred to the growth medium in the assay vessel. Root hair curling or branching was first observed 5 days after Rhizobium inoculation. Infection threads were seen on each plant between 10-18 days after inoculation. Nodules were visible on plants 12 days after inoculation and most of them were located on lateral roots. © 1988, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart. All rights reserved.

AB  - Four Indonesian goats fed Leucaena leucocephala with a calcium to phosphorus ratio in excess of 6:1 for 472 days developed mandibular osteodystrophy fibrosa to varying degrees ranging from severe to slight. The animals appeared to grow normally but the animal with the most severe clinical symptoms lost weight for 35 days prior to the termination of the experiment. The other three animals either maintained or gained weight during this period. A balance study performed part way through the experiment revealed that the animal which subsequently lost weight was probably not storing calcium or phosphorus whereas the other animals had a positive calcium balance and were probably storing small amounts of phosphorus. Histological examination of tissues taken after a post-mortem revealed that the kidney, parathyroid and thyroid glands and long bones were normal. © 1987 Longman Group Limited.

AB  - Codariocalyx was initially much more productive than leucaena but persistence was much poorer, especially on the dry site where all Codariocalyx plants died within 4 yr. The poor persistence of Codariocalyx is partly attributed to damage from nematodes and wood moth larvae. All leucaena plants survived and their productivity, although poorer on the wet site, continued to improve with time. Lime (10 t ha-1) improved the yield of leucaena by 50% on the dry site and 300% on the wet site. Codariocalyx set very little seed so is unlikely to persist through seedling regeneration. -from Author

AB  - Strain NGR234 produces highly mucoid (Muc+) colonies on laboratory media and induces nitrogen-fixing nodules on Leucaena plants. However, many transposon Tn5-induced exopolysaccharide mutants which were nonmucoid (Muc−) do not produce normal nodules on Leucaena plants. Instead, these Muc− (unconditional rough) mutants caused root hair curling and formed callus-like structures. When strain ANU265 (a Muc+ Sym plasmid-cured derivative of strain NGR234) was coinoculated with some Muc− callus-forming strains, normal nitrogen-fixing nodules (Nod+ Fix+) were formed. Both Muc− and Muc+ strains were present in the nitrogen-fixing nodules and no genetic exchange was detected between the strains. However, some Muc− strains, when coinoculated with ANU265, produced normal-sized nodules (instead of callus-like structures) that were unable to fix nitrogen. Examination by light microscopy of the callus-like structures produced by the Muc− (callus-forming) mutants on Leucaena plants suggested that they are deformed nodules resulting from early inhibition of the normal infection process. Experiments with a specifically constructed transconjugant strain which produces varying amounts of exopolysaccharide (EPS) supports the conclusion that EPS is essential for correction of the nodulation behaviour of Muc− mutants. © 1987, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala leaves were subjected to several drying treatments followed by pelleting and/or inclusion of ethoxyquin as antioxidant and analysed monthly to determine rates of loss of carotenes and xanthophylls. Rapid sun drying yielded leucaena leaf meal with carotene and xanthophyll concentrations of 446 and 865 mg/kg, respectively, but considerable losses occurred during drying at 60 and 145°C, and as a result of blanching in hot water or ferrous sulphate solution. Loss rates of carotenes during storage were in the range 19-40 mg/kg per month, and of xanthophylls, 29-53 mg/kg per month. Carotenoids in sun-dried leaf meal were most stable during storage. Pelleting or inclusion of ethoxyquin did not reduce carotenoid loss rates below those of unpelleted leaf meal. The mimosine content of untreated sun-dried leucaena leaf meal was 3.2%, but the concentration decreased to 2.5 and 1.8% on drying at 60 and 145°C, respectively. The concentrations of mimosine in sun-dried leafmeals of water-blanched and ferrous sulphate-blanched leucaena were 2.0 and 2.1%, respectively. Treatments causing maximum losses of mimosine were those which brought about maximum losses of carotenoids. © 1983.

AB  - Flavonol glycosides found in the leaves of Leucaena leucocephala comprised the 3‐arabinosides, 3‐rhamnosides and 3‐glucuronides of quercetin and myricetin, and quercetin‐3‐rhamnosylglucoside, at a total concentration of 3–4%. In cultivars of high productivity (Peru, El Salvador (K28) and Cunningham) all seven compounds occurred with a largely constant pattern of relative concentrations. However in the cosmopolitan form naturalised throughout the tropics the 3‐arabinosides were invariably absent. The same feature which was conspicuous on the high performance liquid chromatography trace, occurred with a low frequency (ca 10%) in Peru and Cunningham. The pattern provides a quick method for identifying the provenance of commercial leucaena leaf meal, and also for detecting blending or adulteration with other leaf meals. The flavonol glycoside distribution of those species associated with ‘leucaena’ leaf meal (Acacia villosa, Calliandra calothyrsus, Manihot utilissima and Sesbania grandiflora) is very different, and all have fewer compounds. All compounds occur in the apical tissue of young leucaena seedlings, enabling identification of cultivar from seed in 10 days. Comparison of leaf flavonol patterns for L. leucocephala, L. pulverulenta their known F1 hybrid, and an entity known locally in Java as ‘L. glabrata’ strongly suggest a hybrid origin for the latter.

AB  - The woody legume Leucaena leucocephala (K-8) is useful for fuel and forage production in the sub-tropics and tropics. When planted on favorable sites L. leucocephala (K-8) has produced 22 Mg dry biomass ha-1. However, many investigators have observed that leucaena productivity is site-specific, growing best on well-drained and fertile soils. L. leucocephala (K-8) was planted on calcareous soils in 1982 at a site in Kingsville, TX. Biomass productivity ranged from 1.4 to 10 Mg ha-1 which was attributed to soil variability. Foliar macro- and micronutrient analyses were conducted for ten elements and soil phosphorus and pH were measured. Leaf P was found to be positively correlated with biomass production (r = 0.71, p = 0.002) as was leaf Mg (r = 0.57, p = 0.022). Leaf Ca (r = 0.55, p = 0.028) and Fe (r = 0.56, p = 0.024) were negatively correlated with biomass. The soil pH at 15-30 cm (r = 0.60, p = 0.013) and 30-60 cm (r = 0.88, p = 0.0001) depths was negatively correlated with biomass. Sodium bicarbonate-extractable P was not correlated with the leaf P or any other variables while 1:10 water-extractable P was positively correlated with Fe and soil pH at 30-60 cm. We postulate that the lack of correlation between sodium bicarbonate-extractable P and leaf P may be due to iron-calcium co-precipitation of soil P. © 1987.

AB  - The effects of salt (NaCl) and additional calcium (as CaCl2) on growth and solute composition were examined in two tropical legumes, Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania bispinosa. In both species calcium made a substantial contribution to the solute potential in the leaves, where less sodium accumulated than in the stems. The calcium and potassium concentrations were lower in the stems than in the leaves. Additional calcium greatly ameliorated the effects of salt (NaCl) on growth and sodium concentrations in the shoots. In S. bispinosa pinitol increased with salt stress, particularly in the apices, and may act as a compatible solute, but it does not accumulate in L. leucocephala in response to salt stress. © 1988, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

AB  - The performance of the leaf mulches of Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Flemingia macrophylla in weed control has been tested in two trials. The length of the period during which a mulch layer yields significantly less weedbiomass compared to the control plots is called the 'effective life-span' of the mulch. Of the three mulch materials only that of F. macrophylla shows promise in retarding weed development. In the second trial F. macrophylla leaf mulch was applied at rates of 3, 6 and 9 tons dry matter per ha. The effective lifespan of a mulch layer of 3 tons is between 12 and 13 weeks. The treatments 6 and 9 tons have effective life-spans of over 14 weeks. For moderate quantities (up to 5 tons of dry leaf mulch per ha) the effective life-span is estimated at about a 100 days. The value of mulching in weed control is limited to the control of weed species that multiply by seed. Regrowth originating from roots or stumps from former vegetation is unlikely to be checked by a mulch layer. © 1988 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.

AB  - Biomethanation of organic matter is now recognized as a viable alternative for production of energy. Among various biomass sources screened, Leucaena leucocephala, having a high biomethanation rate, has been identified as a potential substrate for large-scale methane generation. During semi-continuous fermentations at 30 °C with volatile solids (VS) ranging from 1.0-2.5 g l-1 at hydraulic retention time (HRT) ranging from 10-18 days, the yield of product gas per gram of volatile solids input was about 0.45-0.601 in the case of L leucocephala and 0.15-0.201 from cow-manure. Mass spectrometric analysis of the product gas from L leucocephala indicated a methane content of 78-80%. Batch fermentation for 80 days with input volatile solids of 40-44 g in a 21 digester resulted in a gas yield of 0.87 l g-1 volatile solids input for L leucocephala and 0.33 l g for cow-manure. The complex degradation of solid organic matter involves multiphase interactions between microbes and their environment; optimisation and separation of predominantly acidogenic and methanogenic species was achieved in a multi-stage digester with separate compartments. This design was used for degradation studies of L. leucocephala, which, from the results presented, appears to be a good candidate for an 'energy-farm' for large-scale biomethanation. © 1986.

AB  - Lines of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit were grown in greenhouse pots of an acid, Al-toxic Tatum subsoil (clayey, mixed, thermic typic Hapludult) treated with 0 or 3000 ppm CaCO3 to give final soil pH values of 4.1 and 5.3, respectively. Lines of L. leucocephala, plus those of other Leucaena species, were also tested on an acid, Monmouth soil (clayey, mixed, mesic, typic Hapludult) treated with 0 or 1500 ppm CaCO3 to give final soil pH values of 4.8 and 6.6, respectively. The major index of acid soil tolerance used was relative root yield (unlimed/limed %). Relative root yields of 117 L. leucocephala lines on Tatum soil ranged from 34 to 246%. Hence, liming the soil from pH 4.1 to 5.3 was highly beneficial to some lines and highly detrimental to others. Because Tatum subsoil is 89% Al saturated at pH 4.1, line tolerance to unlimed soil indicates tolerance to Al. Causes of yield depression at pH 5.3 were not determined. © 1984, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent results in both plant biochemistry and animal metabolism emphasise that, in any research on the nutritional applications of Leucaena leucocephala, measurement of mimosine should be accompanied by measurement of the degradation product 3‐hydroxy‐4(1H)‐pyridone. This may reveal wide differences in the toxic load coming from the feed and in the animal metabolic response to it. The authors suggest that where mimosine analysis can only be performed by the traditional colorimetric method, it should be combined with paper chromatography to estimate ratios of mimosine and 3,4‐DHP. However high performance liquid chromatography provides vastly improved methods for simultaneously and precisely analysing both compounds. Published methods are reviewed and a new ion exchange method is described which has been used for the rapid routine analysis of a large number of samples. The chromatographic properties and separation of 2,3‐dihydroxypyridine, a recently discovered metabolite, and of 3‐glucuronyl‐4(1H)pyridone from the above compounds are also reported.

AB  - Eight cultivars of Leucaena were evaluated to identify the most suitable cultivar for forage yield coupled with quality. The plants were grown in three replications at a distance of 2 × 2 m in 80 m2 plots. The plants were harvested at about 75-day intervals and cut 75 cm above the ground. Four cuttings were taken in a year and analysed for portein content, in vitro dry matter digestibility, mimosine and structural carbohydrates on a dry weight basis. Data on dry fodder yield were also recorded. Cultivars differed significantly for green and dry forage yields and digestible dry matter in all the four cuts. Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru gave maximum yield followed by cv. Hawaiian common. The mean protein content of different cultivars varied from 25.70 to 31.92%, while in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) varied from 47.30 to 59.50%. The cultivar Cunningham had the highest IVDMD percentage of 59.50% due to less lignification than other cultivars. The mimosine, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) contents varied from 0.70 to 1.41%, 26.35 to 36.58% and 20.26 to 22.39%, respectively. It is possible to breed a cultivar for desirable IVDMD with minimum content of mimosine and lignin. Under Hisar conditions L. leucocephala cv. peru was the best for forage yield, less lignification and better in in vitro dry matter digestibility. Results obtained during experimentation on other aspects of Leucaena are also summarised. Future lines of research are suggested. © 1986.

AB  - The failure of Australian goats fed Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) to degrade 3-hydroxy-4(1H) pyridone (DHP), the goitrogenic metabolite of mimosine, was overcome when they were infused with rumen fluid from an Indonesían goat. The leucaena toxicity problem in Australia may well be solved by transfer of specific bacteria capable of degrading DHP anaerobically. © 1984 Birkhäuser Verlag.

AB  - A system of shifting cultivation was used for the growing of tobacco by European companies in the Deli district of Sumatra, Indonesia from the end of the 19th century until about 1940. Following the clearance of forest, tobacco was cultivated and after it had been harvested local people had the right to grow one crop of upland rice or maize. The plots were then left fallow for at least seven years. This paper briefly describes the system of cultivation employed, including the use of planted tree fallows using the species Albizia falcataria, Cassia siamea, Leucaena leucocephala, Samanea saman and Tectona grandis. Also described are experimental studies to investigate the floristic composition of the natural forest fallow and the effects of natural and planted fallows on tobacco diseases and quality. The susceptibility of tobacco plants to slime disease was of much importance. It varied with the tree species used for the fallow, but Mimosa invisa was found to decrease the incidence of the disease, as also did Imperata cylindrica in natural fallows. © 1983 A B Academic Publishers.

AB  - The nitrogen fixation rate in a 4-year-old stand of the woody legume Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. was estimated in the field at a rather dry site in Tanzania by use of an acetylene reduction technique. The diurnal mean value during April-May was 35 nmol C2H4 mg-1 (dry weight) nodules h-1, with a variation between 22±8 and 48±12 nmol C2H4 mg-1 (dry weight) nodules h-1 in early morning and at midday, respectively. The nodule biomass was determined by auger sampling to be 51±16 kg (dry weight) ha-1. Most of the nodules were found at the 10-30 cm soil depth level. A rough calculation of the amount of nitrogen fixed annually arrived at 110±30 kg ha-1. The results give strong support for the use of L. leucocephala for soil enrichment in less humid areas of tropical Africa. © 1982 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W. Junk Publishers.

AB  - Steers were fed in pens on diets containing 0, 10, 20, 40, 67 and 100% Leucaena for 112 days. The remainder of the diet was a good quality sorghum hay. Liveweight change, feed intake, mimosine intake, urinary output of 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone (DHP), serum thyroxine (T4), serum triiodothyronine (T3) and effective thyroxine ratio (ETR) were measured. Steers on the 67 and 100% Leucaena diets had low feed intakes (40-50 g (kg LW)-0. 75), lost weight and were severely hypothyroid. Steers on the 0, 10 and 20% Leucaena had intakes of 80-90 g (kg LW)-0. 75, gained liveweight at 0.3-0.5 kg day-1 and showed normal thyroid function. Steers on the 40% Leucaena diet had high feed intakes and grew well initially, but subsequently their feed intakes and rates of liveweighr gain declined. Reduced feed intake was associated with serum T3 levels below 1.0 nmol l-1. DHP excretion in the urine was linearly related to Leucaena and mimosine intake (P < 0.01). Recoveries of mimosine eaten, as DHP in the urine, varied from 33% with the 10% Leucaena diet to 55% with full Leucaena feeding. Feed intake declined as the proportion of Leucaena in the diet increased, but recovery of appetite was rapid when steers were transferred to an all sorghum hay ration. It is concluded that diets containing less than 1% mimosine on a DM basis have little adverse effect on thyroid function or feed intake, whereas above this level hypothyroidism and low feed intakes may occur. Under Australian conditions Leucaena can only safely be used as a supplement (<30%) to roughage diets, rather than as a major dietary component, until some solution to the toxicity problem is found. © 1984, CSIRO.

AB  - Field studies were carried out to study the influence of seasonal variations in salinity and soil moisture profiles due to fluctuating water table on the performance of 16 tree species. Over a yearly cycle water table having an EC of 2-46 mmhos/cm fluctuated between 10-140 cm from the surface. Seasonal variation in salinity profiles indicated that subsurface planting (30 cm below surface) provides less hostile saline environment to the roots. Due to genetic differences, species of trees differed in their ability to withstand salinity and aeration stresses individually and simultaneously. In areas where salinity is not associated with high water table conditions, tree species like Acacia auriculiformis, Terminalia arjuna and Leucaena leucocephala can be grown. Tree species like Casuarina equisetifolia Tamarix articulata and Prosopis juliflora can be planted where high salinity or high water table conditions exist separately or simultaneously. If planting occurs on ridges, Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia nilotica and Terminalia arjuna can also be grown in these conditions. © 1985 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.

Attempts are being made to promote land use which rehabilitates damaged lands and which reduces further degeneration; amongst the means being used are: earthen dams to store rainwater for irrigation, soil conservation measures, and the planting of the tree Leucaena leucocephala to reduce the collection of cow dung for fuel. Cost benefit studies of the various measures being tried are presented. Stresses that unless villages get benefits within one or two years of initiating improvement measures, they will not control grazing, wood collecting, etc.-C.J.Barrow(CDS)

AB  - An enzyme which catalyses the degradation of mimosine to 3‐hydroxy‐4(1H)‐pyridone(DHP) has been isolated from Leucaena leucocephala leaf by extraction with ammonium sulphate, purification on Sephadex G‐25 and fractionation on Sepharose 6B and gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was found to have a molecular weight of 140000, a Km value of 1.64 mM ml−1 and maximum reaction velocity of 0.3 mmol DHP produced ml−1 min−1. Tyrosine was a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme but DHP did not act as a feedback inhibitor. The enzyme has been termed ‘mimosinase'’. Copyright © 1986 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Three experiments were conducted to determine the value of foliage from three tropical legume trees as low level protein supplements to napier grass diets for growing ‘ Kacang ’ goats. The average crude protein concentration in the napier grass was 12%. Napier grass and foliage of the legume trees Gliricidia maculata, Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania grandifiora were subjected to in situ microbial fermentation and subsequent treatment with acid-pepsin solution. The levels of N solubilized after 2 h incubation were 46 and 43 % for napier grass and sesbania respectively, which were higher (P < 0.05) than those for gliricidia and leucaena (27%). Rates of protein disappearance between 2 and 24 h incubation in the rumen averaged 2.6 %/h for the legumes and 1.0 %/h for napier grass. The proportion of water-insoluble, rumen-degradable protein from the legumes was larger (P < 0.05) than that from napier grass. Napier grass intake by goats supplemented with gliricidia or leucaena at 15% of the dry-matter intake from napier grass was lower (P < 0.05) than that of controls receiving no legume supplement. Napier grass intake did not differ between controls and sesbania-supplemented goats. There was no difference among diets in total dry-matter intake, intake of cell wall constituents or digestibility. Average daily gain for control goats was — 1 g/day as compared with 21 g/day for supplemented goats. The feeding of formaldehyde-treated soyabean meal (F-SBM) as a supplement to either napier grass or napier grass-legume diets increased (P < 0.05) intake of dry matter and weight gain of goats. Napier grass intake of animals supplemented with only F-SBM was higher (P < 0–05) than that of control animals. The efficiency of N utilization from F-SBM was higher than that in the legumes, but replacement of legumes by F-SBM above 4 % F-SBM feeding had no effect on weight gain or efficiency of utilization. It was concluded that napier grass of 6–8 weeks' regrowth with 12% crude protein did not provide sufficient protein for growing goats owing to inefficient protein utilization. The increase in efficiency of protein utilization on supplemented diets is mainly associated with the larger proportion of water insoluble, rumen degradable protein and possibly acid-pepsin soluble protein in tropical tree legumes. © 1986, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala performed best, while 2 Prosopis spp and Helietta parvifolia, the only non-legume, did not establish well due to biotic problems which arose under plantation conditions. Three Acacia spp and 2 Pithecellobium spp (ebano and tenaza) showed high yields, of great interest since their multipurpose potential is the best of all 10 species.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala was evaluated to determine the agronomic and management requirements of this legume in Natal. The objectives were to test the effect of maintaining hedge-rows at different heights, and to investigate the effect of different densities, harvest intervals and fertilization on edible dry matter (EDM) production of L. leucocephala plants grown in the pure stand situation. Cutting plants in hedge-rows at 0,3, 0,6, 0,9, 1,2 and 1,5m respectively resulted in significant increases in yield of EDM with increases in height which ranged from 2,3 to 3,1 t/ha. By increasing the density of plants from 12 346 to 444 444 plants/ha, a significantly greater production of EDM was obtained. A harvest interval of six weeks was significantly better than four and eight week intervals. Fertilization increased production to a greater extent with a shorter cutting interval. Yields ranged from 1,6 to 5,7 t/ha for the pure stand situation. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Populations of two Rhizobium strains (NGR8 and CB81) in the rhizosphere of Leucaena leucocephala were estimated in field experiments with varying levels of antibiotically marked strains as seed inoculation treatments. The population level varied with soil type and strain of Rhizobium. Multiplication in the rhizosphere was very slow in a prairie soil but was more rapid in a sandy podzolic soil and nodulation was three weeks earlier in the sandy soil than in the prairie soil. Survival of these two strains in soil stored in the laboratory also suggested that they (especially NGR8) were not well suited to the prairie soil. Nodule representation of strain CB81 on the prairie soil decreased from 100% three months after sowing to between 12% and 16% two years after sowing. The results suggest that on this soil indigenous rhizobia form effective nitrogen fixing associations with Leucaena leucocephala and that any improvement in nitrogen fixation will require strains of Rhizobium that are more effective than the indigenous strains and better competitors for nodule formation. © 1982 CSIRO.

AB  - Morphological and physiological measurements on individual leaves of Leucaena leucocephala seedlings were used to study acclimation to neutral shading. The light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Pn max) ranged from 19.6 to 6.5 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1 as photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) during growth decreased from 27 to 1.6 mol m-2 s-1. Stomatal density varied from 144 mm-2 in plants grown in high PPFD to 84 mm-2 in plants grown in low PPFD. Average maximal stomatal conductance for H2O was 1.1 in plants grown in high PPFD and 0.3 for plants grown in low PPFD. Plants grown in low PPFD had a greater total chlorophyll content than plants grown in high PPFD (7.2 vs 2.9 mg g-1 on a unit fresh weight basis, and 4.3 vs 3.7 mg dm-2 on a unit leaf area basis). Leaf area was largest when plants were grown under the intermediate PPFDs. Leaf density thickness was largest when plants were grown under the largest PPFDs. It is concluded that L. leucocephala shows extensive ability to acclimate to neutral shade, and could be considered a facultative shade plant. © 1986 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W. Junk Publishers.

AB  - Over 4600 species of plants have been introduced into the Hawaiian Islands over the last 200 yr. Only 86 have become serious pests of native ecosystems; the most significant are Andropogon virginicus, Clidemia hirta, Lantana camara, Leucaena leucocephala, Melinis minutiflora, Myrica fava, Passiflora mollissima, Pennisetum clandestinum, P. setaceum, Psidium cattleianum, Rubus argutus and Schinus terebinthifolius. All 86 species are discussed with regard to their impact on the ecosystem, dispersal mechanism, fire tolerance, potential for biological control, and their distribution and principal infestation sites. Twenty-eight (32%) are invasive weeds; the remainder generally require some form of disturbance in order to become established. Lowland ecosystems have suffered the most disruption from alien species because of agriculture, fire and urbanization, but all vegetation types have been affected to some degree. A number of strategies are discussed which may help to ameliorate weed problems.-from Author

AB  - The study was conducted to evaluate the suitability of Leucaena leucocephala for fuelwood and pole production using agroforestry in a semiarid environment. The trial site, planted in February 1980 at Mafiga, Morogoro, was a split plot design with four main plots: (1) Leucaena intercropped with maize; (2) Leucaena intercropped with beans; (3) Leucaena monoculture and clean weeded; and (4) Leucaena monoculture and spot weeded. Each main plot included three tree-spacing subplots, 3 × 3 m, 4 × 4 m and 5 × 5 m, and replicated four times. Each of the subplots comprised at least 25 trees. Twenty-four trees representing all the diameter classes in the trial were harvested in March 1984 and used to determine mean plot height, volume and biomass by regression analysis. Nutrient content was determined using routine laboratory methods. Mean subplot height varied from 7.0 to 7.8 m, whereas diameter at the stem base varied from 10.2 to 14.9 cm. The volume varied from 10.3 to 32.8 m3 ha-1 and total biomass values from 13.5 to 31.1 metric t ha-1. Trees under spot weeding showed the poorest growth, whereas those under clean weeding showed the best. Spacing influenced both diameter and height growth, with the widest spacing producing the largest trees. Because of a higher tree population, however, the lowest spacing showed the highest volume and biomass production. Intercropping with maize and beans showed significantly higher volume and biomass production as compared to spot weeding. However, there was no significant difference between trees under clean weeded treatments and those unde intercropping. Nutrient concentrations were high and comparable to other pasture legumes. The total nutrient accumulation in the aerial biomass in kg ha-1 was 201, 25.1, 267, 106, 34 and 18 for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium, respectively. © 1986.

AB  - Survivorship of the spherical mealybug, Nipaecoccus vastator (Maskell), was significantly higher on branches of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit. (Leguminosae) tended by the ant, Technomyrmex albipes F. Smith, than on branches from which ants were excluded. The presence of ants decreased the percentage of mealybugs parasitized by the encyrtid, Anagyrus indicus Shafee, Alam, and Agarwal (Hymenoptera), and the mortality attributable to host killing by A. indicus and predation by other arthropods. Because ant interference occurs at only a few isolated localities in Guam, our experiments support the hypothesis that natural enemies play an important role in maintaining mealybug populations at low levels. © 1985 Entomological Society of America.

AB  - The rapidly growing, woody perennial legume, Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit), is adaptable to a wide range of neotropical soil conditions. Effective Rhizobium inoculation and endophyte mycorrhizal colonization are essential for high levels of production and symbiotic N2 fixation. The objective of this study was to determine growth, nodulation, nitrogenase activity and nodule composition of inoculated Leucaena as affected by mycorrhizal colonization and factorial soil fertility treatments of a Typic Eutrustox. Highly significant increases in top growth, nodule fresh wt, and nitrogenase activity resulted with Glomus fasciculatum colonization, soil K and linear increases with low-soluble P fertilization to 300 mg P kg−1soil. Highly significant interactions for increased nodulation and nitrogenase activity resulted with K x mycorrhiza. Interactions of all three factors P, K and mycorrhiza were highly significant for nodule fresh wt. However, responses comparing inoculation with G. fasciculatum and with combined G. fasciculatum, G. microcarpusand G. clavium were not significant. Highly significant increases with applied K levels to 300 mg K kg−1soil resulted with top and root growth, nodulation and nitrogenase when applied with soluble P at 100 mg kg−1soil and 500 mg Ca kg−1soil. Significant and highly significant interactions of P, Ca and K level resulted for all parameters. Plant nutrient element composition of nodules increased with the fertilization treatments for P, Ca and increased K levels. A highly significant inverse relation was apparent with decreased Na resulting with increased K levels. Half or more of total nodule K, P and Mg but less than 20% of Ca and Na were within the nodule cytosol. Sodium, Mg, P, and Ca decreased in the cytosol fraction with increased K content. © 1986, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes the salient aspects and analyses the potential of the 'Paraiso Woodlot' System, which is becoming popular as an agroforestry alternative to land use in the degraded acid sandy soils of the humid sub-tropical Guayaybi area of Paraguay. The system consists of a combination of paraiso (Melia azedarach var 'gigante') with other trees, especially Leucaena leucocephala, and annual crops. The fast growth habit, deep root system, addition of large quantities of organic matter through leaf and litter fall, compatibility with agricultural crops, high value of the sawlogs and production of substantial quantities of poles and firewood make paraiso an excellent species for agroforestry combination. Preliminary results of the trials indicate that the 'woodlots' are successful and with increasing efforts of the extension agencies, they are being accepted as a viable alternative to traditional agricultural systems. Besides discussing the potential of these 'woodlots' based on initial results, the paper identifies the constraints of the system and highlights the priority research areas. © 1984 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W.

AB  - Combined gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring (GC-SIM) analysis of a purified extract from seeds of Leucaena leucocephala showed the presence of GA1, GA8, GA17, GA19, GA20, GA23, GA29 and GA53. GA1, GA8 and GA29 were also found both as glucosyl ester-like and glucosyl ether-like conjugates, and GA20 as a glucosyl ester-like conjugate; these conjugates were analyzed as free GAs after enzyme hydrolysis. GA23 was shown to be the main free gibberellin in immature seeds (268 ng/seed), though its level drastically decreased during their maturation. GA1 was the main free C19-gibbercllin and GA1 glucosyl ester-like and glucosyl ether-like conjugates were found at the highest levels in the seeds prior to maturation. Fluctuation of endogenous levels of gibberellins is discussed in terms of seed development. © 1984 The Japanese Society of Plant Physiologists.

AB  - A comparison was made between three goat genotypes (100%, 75% and 50% Katjang), 4% NaOH treated and untreated rice straws fed ad libitum, and 4% NaOH treated and untreated dehydrated palm oil sludge (POS) fed at 20 g per kilogram liveweight (LW) per animal per day. A 1 kg supplement of Leucaena leucocephala was fed daily to each animal. Average total dry matter (DM) intake and LW gain (LWG) was 48·1 g per kilogram liveweight per day and 33·4 g per day, respectively. Alkali treatment increased intake of straw (P< 0·001) and LWG (P < 0·05). Mean DM intake of straw was low, 3·8 g per kilogram liveweight per day. Treated-POS promoted lower gains (P < 0·05) than untreated-POS diets. Mean apparent digestibility of DM, crude protein, crude fat and neutral detergent fibre was 61·8%, 64·4%, 82·2% and 61·2%, respectively. For most constituents, there were no significant differences in digestibility between alkali treated and untreated diets. The 100% Katjang gave lower gains (P < 0·01) than crossbred genotypes. There were no signs of mimosine toxicity; mimosine in the Leucaena was 2·96% of DM. © 1986.

AB  - Many leguminous trees are tripartite symbioses composed of the plant, Rhizobium bacteria, and vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungi. However, few field studies have examined the efficacy of inoculating tree legumes with microsymbionts. A Rhizobium inoculation trial was run with Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia pennatula at two sites in Mexico. Results showed that inoculated plants of both species exhibited greater growth than uninoculated controls in Xalapa, a site with acid soils, but not in LaBalsa which has alkaline soils. Furthermore, the best inoculant strain on A. pennatula in Xalapa was isolated from the very field where the inoculation trial was run. The data suggest that while the inoculation response of leguminous trees may vary with site or species, the benefits possible from the establishment of a highly effective tripartite symbiosis warrant including Rhizobium and VA mycorrhizae inoculation trials in all tree legume programs. © 1986.

AB  - Brahman crossbred steers grazed Leucaena leucocephala (cv Peru) for 0, 1/2, 1 1/2, 2 1/2, 3 1/2, 4 1/2, 5 1/2 or 6 1/2 days per week grazing Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) for the 1 1/2, remainder, for at least 50 weeks. Animals grazing Buffel grass only or Leucaena for 1/2 day only grew faster than all other groups in the wet season (0.75 kg/day) but not in the dry season (0.44 kg/day) and had normal thyroxine concentrations in blood. All other groups grew more slowly, had reduced blood thyroxine, fatter carcasses and in some cases showed alopecia, excessive salivation and goitre; 1 steer died. Poorest growth rates in the wet season (0.44 kg/day) were achieved with 2 1/2, 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 days of grazing Leucaena although the greatest incidence of toxic signs occurred with 4 1/2, 5 1/2 or 6 1/2 days of Leucaena. The frequent observation of toxicity of Leucaena when grazed by cattle under irrigated or wet tropical conditions suggests that its use as a browse legume under these conditions needs further examination. © 1981 Longman Group Limited.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. failed to nodulate with 94 of the 99 strains of Rhizobium tested, representing the seven recognized cross-inoculation groups of nodule bacteria. A group of legumes including L. leucocephala, Mimosa invisa Mart., M. pudica L., Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd. and Sesbania spp. showed the properties of a cross-inoculation group of plants. Rhizobia isolated from these legumes were all fast-growers and nodulate L. leucocephala, often effectively, and also many other tropical legumes, including Vigna sinensis (L.) Savi ex Hassk., which are usually nodulated effectively with slow-growing root-nodule bacteria. The taxonomic significance of the results is discussed. © 1968, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - We compared the uptake of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus (as well as 14C-labelled mannitol, 3H-labelled glutamate, and 32P-labelled phosphate) in three fast- and three slow-growing rhizobia. The fast-growing strains used were Rhizobium meliloti (isolated from Medicago sativa), R. trifolii (from Trifolium subterraneum), and Rhizobium spp from Leucaena leucocephala, while the slow-growing strains were R. japonicum (Glycine max), and two Rhizobium spp (from Centrosema pubescens and Crotolaria anagyroides). Slow-growing organisms preferentially utilized glutamate in the medium. Both fast- and slow-growing strains took up more NH+4-N than NO-3-N on a per cell basis. In the presence of mannitol, fast-growing strains can cause either acid or alkaline reactions, an effect that is dependent only on the N-source (NH+4 or NO-3). Uptake preferences of the fast-growing Leucaena isolate (UMKL 19) resembled those of the slow-growing rhizobia, further strengthening the argument that this organism (and others like it) may be intermediate between the normal fast- and slow-growing groups. Generally, the efficiency of uptake of N (either as NH+4 or NO-3), P, and therefore K, was greater in the fast-growing organisms. © 1982.

AB  - Confirmation of the antithyroid properties of the recently identified goitrogen 3-hydroxy-4(lH)-pyridone (DHP) was obtained by studying its effects on thyroid hormone levels in mice fed a restricted iodine diet containing 1% (wt/wt) DHP. Besides producing hyperplastic goiters, the compound depressed serum T4concentration, caused a marked elevation in serum T3uptake and TSH, and caused a slight increase in T3concentration relative to controls. The effects of DHP on thyroid function were consistent with the histological changes and similar to those reported with other active antithyroid compounds. However, DHP is chemically distinct from any hitherto recognized goitrogen. Its mode of action was further investigated by testing for antiperoxidase activity, because many known goitrogens are general peroxidase inhibitors. A pig thyroid peroxidase preparation and a commercial lactoperoxidase were used. Like the known antithyroid agents resorcinol and 6-methyl-2-thiouracil, DHP was a potent inhibitor of four thyroid peroxidase- and lactoperoxidase-catalyzed reactions, namely 1) oxidation of iodide to iodine, 2) iodination of thyroglobulin, 3) iodination of bovine serum albumin, and 4) oxidation of guaiacol. Based on the concentrations necessary for 50% inhibition, the activity of DHP was less than that of resorcinol and about the same as that of 6-methyl-2-thiouracil. The two major conjugated forms found in mammals, DHP-3-O-glucuronide and DHP-3-O-sulphate, were only weak peroxidase inhibitors. The relevance of these findings to the occurrence of goiter in ruminants grazing on the tropical legume Leucaena leucocephala is discussed, and it is concluded that DHP is the proximate goitrogen, formed by ruminal metabolism of the nonprotein plant amino acid mimosine. © 1979 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Twenty.four lactating Jersey cows, grazing a 3.week regrowth of nitrogen.fertilized Chloris gayana cv. Pioneer pastures selected a diet containing 18 crude protein and were given 0, 2 or 4 kg/day of fresh Leucaena leucocephala or 250 g/day of formal.casein. The effect of the treatments on milk production was measured in a 4 x 4 latin.square design experiment with experimental periods of 14 days.Mean milk yield of unsupplemented cows was 9.6 kg/day, 10.1 kg/day when cows were supplemented with formal.casein and 10.3 kg/day when fed 2 or 4 kg Leucaena/ day. Yields of solids.not.fat, protein, casein, butterfat and short and medium.chain (C4.Cle) fatty acids in milk fat were higher when cows were fed supplements (P<0.01). Intake of digestible organic matter was lowest on the unsupplemented diets although feed in excess of 40 kg D.M./cow/day was offered and cows had little difficulty harvesting feed with a mean bite size of 350 mg organic matter/bite and mean grazing time of 507 min/24 h.It was concluded that a tropical grass diet containing 18 crude protein was deficient in protein for lactating cows and that small quantities of the legume Leucaena can alleviate such a deficiency. © 1979, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Eight tropical legumes and four temperate legumes were grown in water culture and their response to excess manganese was determined by comparing relative dry matter production (tops and roots), manganese, calcium, and nitrogen percentages in the dry matter. The tropical legumes as a group were as much affected by excess manganese as the temperate legumes. There were varying degrees of tolerance within each group. The growth of the different species varied over a wide range but this had nothing to do with sensitivity to manganese. The concentrations of manganese in the roots of two species representing the most tolerant and the least tolerant species were examined. They suggested that the relative tolerance of species depends in part on retention of manganese within the root system. Manganese treatments had little effect on the calcium and nitrogen concentrations in the dry matter (tops) of the majority of species examined. The diagnosis of manganese toxicity may be made by comparing manganese concentrations in the tops with toxicity threshold values obtained by the authors and other workers, and used in conjunction with the visual symptoms of manganese toxicity which have been observed for the various species. Toxicity threshold manganese values in the dry matter of the tops obtained in this investigation were: Centrosemapubescens 1600, Stylosanthes humilis 1140, Lotononis bainesii 1320, Phaseolus lathyroides 840, Leucaena leucocephala 550, Desmodium uncinatum 1160, Glycine javanica 560, Phaseolus atropurpureus 810, Trifolium repens 650, Medicago sativa 380, Trifolium fragiferum 510, and Medicago truncatula 560 p. p. m. © 1969 CSIRO.

AB  - Gliricidia maculata (syn G. sepium) is a fast growing, leguminous, medium sized, thornless tree which can substitute for Leucaena leucocephala as a source of fodder, fuelwood and green manure, in hedges and living fences, and as a shade tree in tea, coffee, and cocoa plantations. It grows in lowland areas of the tropics having mean annual temperatures of 22-30°C. and rainfall of 800-1700mm, and is much easier to establish than leucaena. The foliage has a crude protein content of 20-30 per cent, and recent research reviewed in this paper confirms the value of gliricidia as a feed supplement for sheep and cattle. Feeding gliricidia to ewes in Sri Lanka as 25 per cent of total feed led to increased voluntary feed intake, weight changes before lambing, percentage lambing, and survival of ewes and lambs, compared with a diet consisting only of grass. Lamb growth rates were almost doubled. No further benefits were obtained by increasing gliricidia to more than 25 per cent of total feed. No detrimental side effects were observed in these long term studies, even at gliricidia levels of 80 per cent of total feed received over up to 2 breeding cycles. The milk production of cattle fed on gliricidia was not significantly affected, although milk was tainted at gliricidia levels above 50 per cent total feed. Trials in Thailand have shown that gliricidia can substitute for leucaena as a feed supplement with no significant differences in feed intake, and digestible dry matter, protein and fibre. Digestible energy is significantly lower, but the overall difference in feed value is small. Gliricidia maculata has considerable potential as a multi-purpose tree for agroforestry systems in the tropics. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Toxicity of nimosine and extracts of Leucaena leucocephala leaves were measured by injection into 14 day chicken embryos and observation of mortality by day 17. Injections into albumen showed high sensitivity to solution salinity, but air space injections did not. Observed LD50 for L mimosine by air space injection was 3.5±0.2 μmoles/embryo. Water, acid and base extracts were significantly more toxic than equivalent amounts of L mimosine. Ferrous sulfate, equimolar to mimosine, significantly detoxifies mimosine, water and acid extracts of L. leucocephala, but not base extract. L. leucocephala contains one or more toxic substances, in addition to mimosine, which account for a significant portion of its total toxicity to chicken embryos.

AB  - SUMMARY Steers fed a sole diet of Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru (leucaena), rapidly developed a hypothyroid condition. Total serum thyroxine (T4) levels declined from c 120 n mol litre‐1 to 13 n mol litre‐1 within six weeks of full leucaena feeding. Associated with the hypothyroidism was a decline in feed intake, poor weight gain, hair loss, excessive salivation and the development of lesions on the oesophagus of some animals. Light steers (119 kg) were more severely affected than heavy steers (220 kg) and two light steers died. During the eight week period of full leucaena feeding animals gained only 0.18 kg head‐1 day‐1 compared with 0.73 kg head‐1day‐1 for steers fed cowpea Vigna sinensis hay. Supplementation with minerals (Fe, Cu, Zn) significantly increased mean daily intake (85.4 v 68.9 g/kg0.75), daily liveweight gain, (334 v 14 g), and serum T3 resin uptake (42.5 v 39.6%); decreased hair loss and skin lesions but did not alleviate the low serum T4 levels. lodine supplementation did not affect intake, bodyweight gain, serum T4 levels, serum T3 uptake or toxicity scores compared with unsupplemented leucaena fed steers. When the leucaena fed animals were subsequently fed cowpea hay, appetite improved and the serum T4 levels returned to normal within two weeks. For the heavy steers over this period, weight gain was similar to the controls; however, the light steers continued to gain poorly. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - An extract of Leucaena seedlings has been shown to catalyse an enzymic synthesis of mimosine from 3,4-dihydroxypyridine and O-acetylserine. Neither serine nor α,β-diaminopropionic acid served as direct substrates in the enzymic reaction. A similar enzymic synthesis of β-pyrazol-1-ylalanine in watermelon seedling extracts was shown to be dependent upon pyrazole and O-acetylserine, and not serine. Some properties of the enzymes are described. © 1971.

AB  - Inhibitory activity against bovine trypsin and α-chymotrypsin was found to exist in the Leucaena leucocephala seed. Characterization of the crude inhibitors by disk gel electrophoresis followed by activity staining revealed that 11 trypsin inhibitors were present, four of which also had inhibitory activity against α-chymotrypsin. Purification of the crude inhibitors was accomplished first by adsorption on DEAE-cellulose and elution from it, and then DEAE-cellulose and DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography. This partially purified protein showed four bands which closely moved having anti-trypsin and anti-a-chymotrypsin activity in disk gel electrophoresis. © 1980, Japan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry.

AB  - A diallel series of intervarietal crosses in Leucaena leucocephala was used to estimate general and specific combining ability for length of main stem and stem number in four varieties of contrasting growth habits. Reciprocals were not included. Significant differences were found between varieties for variation due to general combining ability, for both characters, and for variation due to specific combining ability for length of main stem, but not for stem number. Peru and Guatemala were superior to Hawaii and El Salvador in general combining ability for length of main stem. Peru and Hawaii were superior to El Salvador and Guatemala in general combining ability for stem number. Peru and El Salvador had much higher specific combining ability variances for length of main stem than Guatemala and Hawaii. An evaluation of parents and crosses based on Fi performance and the estimates of combining ability has been made, and compared with the subsequent performance of the crosses in later generations. © 1967 CSIRO.

AB  - Parasponia andersonii was nodulated by thirty four of thirty nine slow‐growing rhizobia isolated from tropical legumes and by R. japonicum and JR. lupini. The nitrogenase activity of nodulated plants within a rhizobial treatment varied widely. Effective associations were obtained with some but not all isolates from Cajanus cajan, Centrosema pubescens, Crotalaria anagyroides, Flemingia congesta, Inocarpus fragiferum, Macroptilium lathyroides, Phaseolus calcaratus, Stizolobium deeringianum and Stylosanthes gracilis. Little or no nitrogen was fixed with rhizobia from Albizia stipulata, Cassia mimosoides, Desmodium microphyllum, Pterocarpus indicus, Uraria lagopoides, and the wide‐host range cowpea Rhizobium strain CB 756. Fast‐growing rhizobia from Leucaena leucocephala, Mimosa invisa, M. pudica, Sesbania grandiflora and Lablab pur‐pur eus nodulated Parasponia with a low level of nitrogen fixation. Isolates from Parasponia failed to nodulate most of the legumes usually nodulated by slow‐growing rhizobia and when tropical legumes were nodulated, the association was either partially effective or ineffective; only isolate CP 283 was highly effective and promiscuous. Hosts normally nodulated with fast‐growing rhizobia, including Leucaena and Mimosa were not nodulated with isolates from Parasponia. It was concluded that the Parasponia‐Rhizobium symbiosis is best located in the ‘cowpea miscellany’. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The effectiveness of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, prunings as N source for maize (Zea mays L.) was evaluated in field and pot trials at Ibadan, southern Nigeria. An N deficient, sandy Apomu soil (Psammentic Usthorthent) was used. The prunings significantly increased N uptake of seedlings and N percentage in ear leaves of maize. High maize gain yield was obtained with application of 10 tons fresh prunings or a combination of 5 tons fresh prunings and N at 50 kg ha-1. The prunings as N source, appeared to be more effective when incorporated in the soil than when applied as mulch. In the pot trial, prunings applied two weeks before planting was more effective than when applied at time of planting maize. Under screen house conditions, the apparent N recovery from prunings with early incorporation about equals that of fertilizer N. © 1981 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W. Junk Publishers.

AB  - Mimosine was administered orally to Merino sheep once daily for periods of 1-3 days, either as the isolated compound or in the foliage of Leucaena leucocephala. A single daily dose of mimosine of 450 or 600 mg/kg body weight was effective for defleecing sheep. A daily dose rate of 300 mg/kgwas effective for defleecing sheep if given on two sucessivedays. The effectiveness of a treatment for defleecing sheep was related to the concentration of mimosine in plasma following dosing; defleecing ensued when the concentration of mimosine in plasma was maintained above 0 1 mmol/l for at least30 h. The main products excreted in urine were mimosine and 3, 4-dihydroxypyridine (DHP); small amounts of mimosinamine were also excreted. During the first day following dosing, themajor excretory product was mimosine; DHP was an important component during the second and third days. In the three daysfollowing the start of dosing, between 32 and 53 % of the mimosine given was accounted for as mimosine in the urine. Following an intravenous infusion of mimosine, no DHP was detected in urine; most of the mimosine was excreted intact but a small amount (c. 9%) was excreted as mimosinamine. © 1975 ASEG.

AB  - Mice fed a diet containing 1 % (w/w) 3-hydroxy-4(IH)-pyridone (DHP) developed goitre even with a diet high in iodine whereas mimosine (0.5% w/w) did not produce goitre even with a low-iodine diet. Thyroid enlargement was apparent (measured morphometrically) by the 7th week and was advanced by the 11 th week. Histologically the goitre was hyperplastic in type. No marked histological changes were found in other organs of mice fed DHP or any organs of mice fed mimosine, except for soine atrophy of hair follicles. A single intragastric dose of DHP inhibited the uptake of 125I by the thyroid in the rat but an equivalent dose of mimosine did not. Evidence is presented that the inhibition occurs at the iodine binding step, as with methyl thiouracil, rather than at the iodide trapping step, as with thiocyanate. Chronic treatment of mice with DHP, as with 6-methyl thiouracil, increased the avidity of the thyroid in taking up 125I. The major conjugated form of DHP in mammals, DHP-3-0-glucuronide, was almost as effective a goitrogen as the unconjugated compound when given by mouth but considerably less active than the free form in the blood stream. It was concluded that DHP is a potent antithyroid compound of the thiouracil type with low general toxicity, since mammals can tolerate a level of intake sufficient to produce goitre in spite of iodine supplementation. © 1979 ASEG.

AB  - β-Mannanase activities in the commercial enzyme preparations Driselase and Cellulase, in culture solutions of Bacillus subtilis (TX1), in commercial snail gut (Helix pomatia) preparations and in germinated seeds of lucerne, Leucaena leucocephala and honey locust, have been purified by substrate affinity chromatography on glucomannan-AH-Sepharose. On isoelectric focusing, multiple protein bands were found, all of which had β-mannanase activity. Each preparation appeared as a single major band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzymes varied in their final specific activities, Km values, optimal pH, isoelectric points and pH and temperature stabilities but had similar MWs. The enzymes have different abilities to hydrolyse galactomannans which are highly substituted with galactose. The preparations Driselase and Cellulase contain β-mannanases which can attack highly substituted galactomannans at points of single unsubstituted d-mannosyl residues if the d-galactose residues in the vicinity of the bond to be hydrolysed are all on only one side of the main chain. © 1979.

AB  - A maize-leucaena alley cropping system was studied on a N-deficient sandy Apomu soil series (Psammentic Usthorthent) at Ibadan in the forest zone of southern Nigeria from 1976 to 1980. In this system maize was grown in 4 m width alleys between Leucaena hedge rows. Five to six annual prunings of the leucaena hedge rows yielded between 5 to 8 tons of dry tops/ha/year with N-yield of between 180 to 250 kg N/ha/year. Though efficiency of N utilization from leucaena prunings was low, the maize-leucaena alley cropping system can be utilized as a low N-input system. Addition of leucaena prunings from the full grown hedge rows, was able to sustain maize grain yield at about 3.8 tons/ha/year for two consecutive years with no N addition, while with no addition of prunings, yield declined. Higher maize grain yields were obtained with supplementation with low N rates of 20 to 80 kg N/ha depending on variety and season. The maize-leucaena alley cropping system also has the potential for being developed as a stable alternative for the traditional bush fallow system. Leucaena plants which have unique properties suitable for growing in alley cropping, still retain important functions of a traditional bush fallow: for nutrient recycling, source of green manure, firewood, and staking material. Addition of leucaena prunings increased total soil N and organic C level. © 1981 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W. Junk Publishers.

AB  - Colony characteristics, growth in litmus milk, precipitation in calcium glycerophosphate medium and utilization of carbon sources of the root‐nodule bacteria isolated from the tropical legumes Leucaena, Mimosa, Acacia, Sesbania and Lablab were similar to fast‐growing rhizobia of temperate legumes, particularly Rhizobium meliloti. In agglutination tests, isolates from each host shared antigens with one or more of five Rhizobium strains from Leucaena. Infective characteristics of the fast‐growing rhizobia were studied in modified Leonard jars and in agar culture. Cross‐infections by rhizobia between these plants were common and the association often effective. Lablab was effectively nodulated by its own fast‐growing isolate but only formed root swellings, possibly ineffective pseudonodules, with the other isolates. Slow‐growing rhizobia which were able to nodulate Macroptilium atropurpureus were unable to form nodules on these legumes except Lablab which was considered more akin to the cowpea group. All fast‐growing isolates nodulated, often effectively, Vigna unguiculata and V. unguiculata ssp. sesquipedalis. The isolate from Lablab also effectively nodulated a number of other tropical legumes which have previously only been reported to nodulate with slow‐growing nodule bacteria and it also produced ineffective nodulation on Medicago sativa. This is the first record of an effective fast‐growing isolate from Lablab. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Metabolism of mimosine and other FeCl3 positive compounds was studied in chickens altered surgically for collection of urine separate from feces. Urine from Leucaena leucocephala (LL) fed, intravenously mimosine injected, and corresponding control chickens was compared to standard L mimosine and 3,4 dihydroxypyridine (DHP) by two dimensional thin layer chromatography followed by a FeCl3 spray. Acid extract of LL leaves contained three compounds which are FeCl3 positive: mimosine, DHP, and an unidentified substance, compound A. Urine from LL fed and mimosine injected chickens contained DHP, indicating that DHP is not metabolically destroyed by the chicken, and that the chicken partially metabolizes mimosine to DHP. Mimosine not metabolized is excreted in the urine. Compound A, from LL extract, is not found in any urine, indicating that its FeCl3 reactivity is metabolized by the chicken. A fourth FeCl3 positive substance, compound B, is only found in trace quantaties in urine of LL fed chickens. Compound B may be a metabolic product of compound A, but not of mimosine or DHP, because compound B is not found in the urine of mimosine injected chickens. No FeCl3 positive compounds occurred in detectable concentrations in any plasmas at the time samples were taken. Compounds A and B are possibly structurally related to mimosine and DHP.

AB  - The comparative effects of CaCO3 on growth, nodulation and chemical composition were determined in four Leucaena leucocephala lines (three bred), Macroptilium lathyroides and Lotononis bainesii grown in pots of an acid soil. Calcium carbonate treatments were equivalent to nil, 250, 750, 1250 and 2500 kg ha-1 (Ca0 to Ca4). L. leucocephala is a tree, well adapted to calcareous soils. M. lathyroides and L. bainesii are herbaceous species tolerant of acid soil conditions. Total dry matter production (tops+roots) of the four Leucaena lines exceeded that of M. lathyroides and L. bainesii. However, the top DM yield of the latter two species exceeded that of Leucaena due to a low top/root weight ratio in Leucaena. The Leucaena lines gave successive total DM increases up to the Ca3 treatment, the overall increase being relatively large, especially in line 3;at Ca4 mean DM yieldswere below those at Ca,. Both M. lathyroides and L. bainesii had significant responses particularly at the Ca1 treatment, but at the Ca4 treatment their total DM yields were reduced below those obtained with no CaCO3 addition. In all Leucaena lines there was a significant increase in nodule DM pot-1 between the Ca0 and Ca4 treatments. However, there was a decrease in nodule DM of lines 5 and 27A from the Ca3 to Ca4 treatment. Nodule DM of M. lathyroides and L. bainesii was only affected to a limited extent over the range of treatments Ca0 to Ca3, but at Ca4 a significant reduction occurred in both species. In all species CaCO3 additions progressively increased the concentration of Ca in the plant tops. The positive DM responses were considered to be primarily due to Ca, although Al may have had a confounding effect, especially in L. leucocephala. Line 3 of L. leucocephala had the highest Ca concentration as well as the greatest reduction in Al concentration. © 1978 ASEG.

AB  - Early growth or nodulation of certain species was depressed when a Hawaiian Oxisol was limed at rates above 6 tons/ha (pH 6). In 8 legumes, the depression later gave way to positive response. This was evident in plant weights of Desmodium intortum and Glycine wightii var. Cooper, and in pod weights of Phaseolus vulgaris. A transient depression was observed visually in Desmodium canum, Dolichos axillaris, Glycine wightii var. Tinaroo, and Trifolium subterraneum. In Stylosanthes guyanensis and S. fruticosa, the depression persisted throughout the experiment (6 months). Growth was not depressed in Arachis hypogea, Coronilla varia, Glycine max, Leucaena leucocephala, Medicago sativa, Trifolium repens, or Vigna sinensis. © 1976 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.

AB  - Three fast-growing rhizobia (Rhizobium meliloti isolated from Medicago saliva, R. trifolii from Trifolium subterraneum, and Rhizohium sp. from Leucaena leucocephala) and three slow-growing rhizobia R. japonicum from Glycine max, Rhizobium spp from Centrosema pubescens and Crotolaria anagyroides) were grown in defined media. The mean generation times of the fast-growing and slowgrowing strains were 3.8 h and 8.6 h respectively. Slow-growing organisms raised the initial pH of the defined medium while the fast-growing organisms lowered it. Rates of oxygen consumption tended to be higher in the slow-growing organisms. UMKL 19 (isolated from L. leucocephala) possessed all the normal reactions of fast-growing rhizobia but had a single sub-polar flagellum, similar to the three slow-growing strains studied. Certain combinations of amino acids and sugars (e.g. glutamine and galactose) induced an acidic reaction in the fast-growing organisms while the slow-growing ones changed the media to alkaline. Fast-growing organisms utilized more galactose for growth compared to slow-growing ones. Both types of organisms synthesized and released a wide range of amino acids into the medium. We suggest that pH changes produced by rhizobia growing on yeast-extract mannitol media are caused by the preferential utilization of sugars by fast-growing organisms and nitrogenous compounds by slow-growing ones. © 1981.

AB  - In separate experiments, mature rats were either given a ration containing L. leucocephala leaf meal at 15% or 7.5% level, or dosed orally each day with water extract of the leaf meal before and during the breeding period. At the 15% level, the food intake of the rats was greatly reduced, and they showed general symptoms of inanition. All the females were infertile and the males showed reduced libido and fertility. In the other experiments the majority of the females conceived, but on autopsy it was observed that they had a significantly larger proportion of foetuses dead and undergoing resorption as compared with those of the control group. The results suggested that the toxic material in L. leucocephala, probably mimosine, produced infertility in the rat by reducing the food intake; when food consumption was adequate for reproductive function, the toxic material caused a high incidence of foetal death and resorption. © 1968 CSIRO.

AB  - Extracts of Brassica species and Leucaena leucocephala seedlings contain an enzyme which degrades O-acetyl-l-serine. The enzyme has been partially purified from broccoli buds and cleaves O-acetyl-l-serine via β-elimination to pyruvic acid, ammonia and acetate. Added pyridoxal phosphate has little effect but the addition of 0·1 mM hydroxylamine and 1 mM NaCN inhibit very strongly. The enzyme appears specific for the l-isomer. l-Serine is not a substrate. O-Phospho-dl-serine and O-methyl-dl-serine also are not utilized by the enzyme. © 1972.

AB  - The growth of seedlings of the forage shrub legume Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham was studied at three levels of shading (100, 57 and 35 per cent relative photosynthetic quantum flux) in a glasshouse. An additional treatment investigated the response of unshaded plants to nitrogen fertilizer applied twice weekly. Shading reduced total plant weight (3.83, 3.20, 2.46g), increased the shoot/root ratio, increased internode length and plant height. However, with increasing shade there was a linear increase in leaf area, and relative growth rate (RGR) of shoots was affected little. RGR of the roots declined sharply from 0.62 to 0.51g g -1 week-1 with shading. Only at the lowest luminance was the dry matter per cent of shoots decreased (32 per cent to 28 per cent). Leaves were larger and thinner in the shaded treatments but rate of leaf appearance was unaffected. Added nitrogen (= 225 kg N ha-1) increased uptake of nitrogen (by 68 per cent), nitrogen concentration (59 per cent) and leaf weight (24 per cent) but had no significant effect on plant height, number of leaves, RGR, or dry matter per cent of shoots. The poor seedling performance of leucaena in competition with other species does not appear to be due to a failure to tolerate shade. In this respect it appears to be better than some other tropical pasture legumes. © 1977 CSIRO.

AB  - Wood derived from forest trees can serve as a major alternative source of energy and fuel because of the current energy shortage and increase in price of oil and natural gas. Normally, trees take several years to grow and produce seeds. But, in recent years, 'test tube trees' have been produced in large numbers (as many as 3000 plants per year) from one seedling using tissue culture by treating a few cells of a tree with specific chemical substances. Tissue culture is a promising technique for mass production of large numbers of superior trees, derived through genetic improvement, and may prove widely applicable to trees which show promise as energy sources. Three selected tree genera, viz. Sapium sebiferum (Chinese Tallow), Leucaena leucocephala (giant ipil-ipil, a tropical legume) and Copaifera multijuga (Copaiba tree from Brazil) have been studied because of their potential usefulness for biomass production. Regeneration of vegetatively produced plantlets has been achieved from embryos and callus cells grown in specific culture medium for two of the above genera. High yields of protoplasts have been obtained isolated from cells of different plant parts and grown as calli. Conditions which will enable callus derived from protoplasts to undergo in vitro regeneration, plantlet formation and eventually growth into plants are being investigated. © 1982.

AB  - An intervarietal cross in Leucaena leucocephala between the contrasting varieties Bald Hills and Guatemala was studied in an experiment incorporating* the two parental varieties, an F2 population, and 37 F3 families. Characters examined were length of main stem and stem number. Phenotypic variances for the F2 population were low in relation to the estimated non-genetic variance. In length of main stem 3 months after planting, genetic variance accounted for 21-9% of the total variance, and partition of variation showed the presence of strong non-genetic and additive genetic components, and absence of any non-additive genetic component. In length of main stem at the end of the season and in stem number, no genetic variance could be demonstrated. Polysomic inheritance is suggested as an explanation of this restricted segregation. Differences between F3 family means were highly significant in each of the characters measured. Length of main stem and stem number were highly correlated (r = 0.5 and 0.7), which suggests that these characters are not inherited independently but are both related to plant vigour. Applications to plant breeding are discussed. © 1967 CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - Six lines of Leucaena leucocephala including the three Australian cultivars Peru, Cunningham and El Salvador were compared at 42 days of age in two controlled environments. Although differences existed between lines for all characters measured, the only reliable means of distinguishing between the cultivars was the mean number of the first bipinnate leaf to have more than one pair of pinnae. This number tends to be lower in more vigorous, non-branched types than in the bushy Hawaiian strain. It is suggested that cv. El Salvador is not typical of the newer “Giant Hawaiian” El Salvador types. © 1980 CSIRO.

AB  - Atomic absorption spectrophotometric determination of the lead concentration in spruce Picea needles and twig axes showed that the lead contents of sites located in the area around Innsbruck varied significantly. Sites within the town area showed the highest lead concentration. With increasing altitude the lead accumulation decreased, both at sites on the northwest slope of the Patscherkofel and at those on the southeast slope of the Nordkette mountain. However, the samples taken from the highest site on the Nordkette mountains at an altitude of 1700 m above sea level showed a slightly higher lead content than those taken from the reference site, Samertal, which is separated from the Inn valley by a mountain chain. Comparison of different samples revealed that two- and three-year old twig axes are best suited for illustrating slight differences in lead concentration. In the case of a higher lead concentration, the lead contents of the younger twig axes, as well as those of the needles, differ significantly. The possible causes of the increased lead content of the needles and twig axes are considered. © 1980, All rights reserved.

AB  - The fine structure of d-galacto-d-mannans was analyzed with purified α-d-galactosidases from germinated lucerne seed and from green coffee beans and with a commercial β-d-mannanase (Driselase). Each of the α-d-galactosidase enzymes removed d-galactosyl residues from the d-mannan backbone in a random fashion; α-d-galactosidase A from lucerne removed more than 90% of the d-galactosyl groups from each of the ten native d-galacto-d-mannans studied. Mixtures of purified α-d-galactosidase C and β-d-mannanase B from lucerne hydrolyzed each of the ten d-galacto-d-mannans to d-galactose, β-d-mannobiose, and β-d-mannotriose, with trace amounts of d-mannose. The degrees of hydrolysis by β-d-mannanase of native d-galacto-d-mannans, and of lucerne d-galacto-d-mannan pre-hydrolyzed by α-d-galactosidase, are dependent on the galactose contents. The amounts of oligosaccharides produced from native d-galacto-d-mannans by Driselase β-d-mannanase parallel those obtained from lucerne d-galacto-d-mannan that had been pre-hydrolyzed to similar galactose levels with α-d-galactosidase, except for the d-galacto-d-mannans of Leucaena leucocephala and soybean, which are hydrolyzed with β-d-mannanase to a higher degree. A direct correlation between the extent of hydrolysis of d-galacto-d-mannans by β-d-mannanase and the degree of gelling interaction with xanthan gum was observed, suggesting that interaction of d-galacto-d-mannans with xanthan does not absolutely require long sections of contiguous unsubstituted d-mannose residues but rather sections where all the galactosyl residues are located on one side of the main chain and may also serve as "junction zones". © 1979.

Forty-six fast-growing rhizobia (including two from Lotus and 4 from Leucaena leucocephala) were clearly distinguished from the slow-growing strains in tests with the same antisera. They were wholly negative (9) or gave a much weaker non-identical line with one antiserum (24 strains), two antisera (8) or three antisera (5).

AB  - Malawi is a tropical country with a strongly seasonal rainfall distribution pattern. The major live stock nutrition problem is the dry season (May to November) protein deficit which results in liveweight losses of up to 40 kg per beast. An attempt is being made to improve the protein nutrition using tropical pastures legumes. The national pasture research programme is based on a policy of finding productive pasture legumes to fit into the present edaphic and managerial environments with a minimum amount of modification to either. A range of proven pasture legumes has been introduced and screened over a range of climatic and edaphic environments. The following legumes exhibit high biological potential for well drained soils: Stylosanthes guyanensis cv. Schofield, S. humilis cv. Queensland Grown, S. humilis cv. Coastal Early, S. humilis (BPI 404), Glycine wightii, Phaseolus atropurpureus cv. Siratro, Desmodium uncinatum and Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru.

Coastal Early, S. humilis (BPI 404) and Lotononis bainesii cv. Miles. Eleven principles of legume introduction into grazing systems are discussed. © 1972 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Five varieties of Leucaena leucocephala covering the range of variation in growth habit in this species were crossed in all combinations. Measurements were made on leaf size, stem length, and flowering date on Fi populations of seven crosses raised in a spaced-plant trial. Genotypic effects were significant for each character. Most of the Fi means approximated to those of the higher parent. The asymmetrical distribution of the Fi means about the mid-parent point indicated that there was some heterosis, in addition to additive effects. Segregation ratios in F2 and Fs populations indicate that branching habit is controlled by two pairs of disomically inherited genes. One of these controls erect growth with lax branching v. bushy growth with denser branching. The other controls absence v. presence of strong basal branching. Measurements of stem length and stem number were made on F2 populations of several crosses. These characters appeared to be controlled by multiple genes affecting vegetative vigour. These genes are transmitted independently of the genes controlling branching habit. © 1967 CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes the effect of phosphorus on nitrogen concentration and onthe total and individual concentrations of the cations calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium in the plant tops of 10 tropical legumes and one temperate legume whengrown on two soils of different type, a light-textured solodic soil and a gley soil. Species used were Phaseolus lathyroides, P. atvopuvpureus, Stylosanthes humilis, Centvosemapubescens, Glycine javanica, Lotononis bainesii, Medicago sativa, Desmodiumuncinatum, D. intortum, Vigna luteola, and Leucaena leucocephala. The nitrogen concentrations in the plant tops were increased by phosphorussupply, and good correlations were established between the nitrogen and phosphorusconcentrations in the plant tops. When sodium dihydrogen phosphate was used as the source of phosphate, thesodium concentration in V. luteola, M. sativa, and L. bainesii was increased. Otherspecies were not affected. Increasing phosphate supply as monocalcium phosphatehad little effect on plant calcium concentration, but brought about an increase ofmagnesium in P. lathyvoides and P. atropurpureus. In the solodic soil particularly, increases in phosphate supply in most species caused reductions in the potassiumconcentration, partly compensated by increases in the magnesium and calcium concentrations. Concentrations of the cations in the plants reflected the soil exchangeablecation composition. Plant species differed in their cation status. P, atropurpureus andP. lathyvoides were relatively high in magnesium, L. bainesii and D. intovtum in potassium, V. luteola, L. bainesii, M. sativa, and P, lathyroides in sodium, and C. pubescens and S. humilis in calcium. © 1969 CSIRO.

AB  - In a field trial using a continuous function design, calcium carbonate was applied to a nitrogen deficient Hawaiian Oxisol at rates which increased along the plant row from 0 to 22 tons/ha, producing a gradient in soil pH from 4.7 to 7.1. Inoculated legumes representing 18 species were grown. Lime response curves showed no distinct general difference between tropical and temperate legumes. Within each group, individual species varied. Responsiveness rankings of species varied depending on criterion of response. The species ranked as follows according to the amount of lime needed for 90% of the maximum attained yield: Coronilla varia (16 tons/ha) > Leucaena leucocephala (11) > Phaseolus vulgaris, Medicago sativa (9-10) > Glycine max var. Kanrich (7) > Glycine wightii var. Cooper, Lotus corniculatus (6) > Glycine wightii var. Tinaroo, Trifolium repens, Trifolium subterraneum (5) > Desmodium canum, Dolichos axillaris, Glycine max var. Kahala (4) > Arachis hypogea, Desmodium intortum, Vigna sinensis (1-2) > Stylosanthes fruticosa, Stylosanthes guyanensis (0.1). The species ranked as follows according to the magnitude of yield increase due to lime: C. varia (20-fold increase) > T. repens (9-fold) > L. leucocephala, D. axillaris, M. sativa (6-fold) > G. wightii var. Tinaroo (5-fold) > P. vulgaris (4-fold) > G. wightii var.

Improved calcium availability could account for plant responses to lime rates over 3 to 4 tons/ha. Only 4 tons CaCO3 sufficed to raise soil pH to 6 and depress solution aluminum and manganese to low concentrations, but 6 tons were needed to raise soluble calcium to 1 meq/l and 20 tons to raise it to 3 meq/l. © 1977 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.

AB  - In a field experiment at Samford, Queensland, on a loam of pH 5.0 (water), nodulation of Leucaena leucocephala was compared after inoculation with two contrasting types of Rhizobium. Peat culture of each was appliedto the seed in three ways: using 2 per cent and 4 per cent methyl cellulose (m.c.) sticker and 4 per cent m.c, with a lime coating. Inoculated seed was sown after storage for one and 28 days. After one day storage the acid-producing strain NGR8 formed nodules only when the seed was pelleted with lime, but the alkali-producing strain CB81 nodulated equally well by all three inoculation procedures. After 28 day storage strain CB81 did not surviveon the seed when applied simply with sticker, but survived as well as strain NGR8 when lime-pelleted.It is suggested that where leucaena is to be established on acid soils, CB81 or a rhizobial strain of similar type be used and that the seed be always lime-pelleted. © 1973 CSIRO.

AB  - SUMMARY Gross and histopathological changes and serum thyroxine levels were determined in 10 heifers fed an exclusive diet of Leucaena leucocephala from 10 months of age until slaughter, 23 months later. Normal ovarian activity and mating were observed during a 7‐month mating period. Cataracts, goitre, lingual epithelial ulceration and gingival atrophy were present at slaughter. Only one of the heifers was pregnant. Histologically, severe vacuolation and disruption of lens fibres and focal hyperplasia of lens epithelium were present. Both follicular hyperplasia and colloid accumulation were found to varying degrees in the thyroid glands and serum thyroxine levels were higher than in a comparable group of animals not fed L. leucocephala. Morphologically normal trophoblast was present in the uteri of 6 animals even though no embryo or foetus was present. Embryonic death and resorption may have been due to the anti‐mitotic effect of mimosine or the goitrogenic effect of DHP. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Analysis of Leucaena leucocephala from various localities in Western Nigeria shows that young leaves, pods and seeds contain more crude protein but lower crude fibre and ether extract than mature ones. The crude fat component was higher in the seeds (4.6% and 5.5% for green and ripe seeds, respectively) than in any other edible part of the plant, while the green and brown seed coats contain the least amount of ether extract and total ash. The mineral composition of the dry matter of mature leaves is 2.8% calcium, 0.26% phosphorus, 0.37% magnesium, 1.78% potassium, 0.21% sodium and 0.12% iron. © 1979.

TI  - The utilization by beef cattle of sugarcane supplemented with animal protein, plant protein or non-protein nitrogen and sulphur
PY  - 1976
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84970567621&doi=10.1071%2fEA9760789&partnerID=40&md5=219342907186d3ac453848c2ee2f1381
AB  - When sugarcane was chopped, supplemented with meat meal or the tropical legume Leucaena leucocephala and fed to Droughtmaster steers, they gained liveweight at the rate of 0.61 kg day-1. When non-protein nitrogen and sulphur were used as the supplement, animals lost liveweight initially but later gained liveweight at 0.52 kg day-1. The improvement was brought about by evenly distributing the supplement in the ration and by ensiling the treated feed for at least 24 hours. Cattle consumed approximately 71 g OM/kg LW0.75/day and digested 57.9 per cent of the diet when the protein source was L. leucocephala, 64.4 per cent when it was meat meal and 66.2 per cent when it was urea and sodium sulphate. The differences in digestibility were associated with differences in retention time of the diets in the rumen. © 1976 ASEG.

AB  - The structure of trichomes and stomata on leaflets of 21 species of the Mimosaceae are described. Non-glandular trichomes in Mimosa pudica are of three types: unicellular, with a rounded thick-walled base and a terminal unicellular body, and multicellular. Capitate, clavate, or cylindric, 3-6-celled glandular hairs are observed on leaflets of Mimosa pudica only. Leaflets are amphistomatic in all species except Adenanthera pavonina, Calliandra sp., Parkia biglandulosa, Pithecellobium dulce, and Samanea saman in which they are hypostomatic. Only paracytic stomata are found in Leucaena leucocephala and Mimosa pudica. In the rest stomata are of more than one type. In spite of the diversity, the most frequent type in these species is paracytic. Anisocytic stomata, in all cases, are secondarily derived from paracytic ones by transverse or oblique wall formation in a subsidiary cell. Similarly some stomata with one subsidiary cell are also secondary derivatives of the paracytic ones because of one of the subsidiary cells assuming the form of an epidermal cell. The development has been traced in 14 species and that of paracytic stomata may be mesogenous or mesoperigenous, that of stomata with one subsidiary cell mesogenous but anomocytic stomata are ontogenetically perigenous. Occasionally a meristernoid is cut off from one of the subsidiary cells of a paracytic stoma. The organization of a stoma from such a meristemoid has been traced. © 1972 OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS.
