AB  - A study was conducted during fall in Central Mexico to determine the chemical composition, the in situ disappearance and rate of in situ fermentation of ten common woody species used by goats in a semi- humid landscape. Leaves of Parkinsonia aculeata, Pithecellobium dulce, Ceratonia siliqua, Leucaena glauca, Crataegus pubescens, Calliandra eriophylla, Dalea bicolor, Eysenhardtia texana, Atriplex canescens and Amelanchier denticulata were analyzed. Dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and ash content of fodder tree leaves ranged between 29.3 and 63.9, 8.5 and 28.2 and 3 and 18.9, respectively. Both acid detergent fiber (21-47%) and neutral detergent fiber (56.4-81.2%) contents were high. DM disappearance of shrubs and trees was in the range 48-85%, with the highest (P<0.05) disappearance rate at all incubation time for Atriplex canescens, Pithecellobium dulce and Leucaena glauca. These data reaffirm the considerable potential of Atriplex canescens, Leucaena glauca and Pithecellobium dulce as high quality forages for ruminants. © GSP, India.

AB  - An experiment was carried out in order to evaluate, using the main components (ACP) and automatic classification analysis (ACA), the chemical composition and nutritional value variations of nineteen accessions of Leucaena leucocephala Lam. de Wit foliage in Matanzas, Cuba. Bromatological composition, secondary metabolites level and in situ ruminal degradabilidad (DM, CP and NDF) were determined. A discreet variability for the first three components (48,87 %) were detected. The DM, CP, TP, NDF, ADF, CF, ADL, cellulose, Ca, ashes and condensed tannins (CT) levels and DM ruminal degradability explained the variability among the evaluate accessions. However, under experimental conditions the P, K, total polyphenols, precipitant tannins, phytates and mimosine Using the ACA in dependence of the nutritional profile five groups with distinctive characteristic to each other were identified. The studied accessions differ fundamentally for their proximal composition and the CIAT-9438, CIAT-8069, CIAT-7985, CIAT-9119, CIAT-9993, CIAT-7929 y CIAT-937 accessions showed the best results. Only the CT constitutes the group of secondary metabolites with comparative importance.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (L. leucocephala) was invasive plant that has occupied large area in the Kenting National Park (KNP) of Taiwan. The purpose of this paper was conducted to evaluate the potential of multispectral reflectance and 5 vegetation indices in the visible to near infrared spectral range, for discriminating L. leucocephala and other dominant vegetation types, including Vitex negundo (V. negundo), Acacia confusa (A. confusa) and Pandanus odoratissimus (P. odoratissimus) at the different seasons. This was a preliminary step for mapping the distribution of L. leucocephala using remote sensing technique for management decisions in the KNP. The ground spectral reflectance data was collected during the dry and rainy seasons (from November 2006 to May 2007) using a handheld field spectroradiometer. Statistically significant differences in the vegetation indices analysis showed that L. leucocephala was possible to distinguish with A. confusa and P. odoratissimus at dry seasons (February, March and April). However, not any vegetation index showed statistical significant differences between L. leucocephala and V. negundo at all seasons. Our results suggest that it is reachable mapping the distribution of L. leucocephala using multi-temporal satellite imagery data of dry season in the KNP. Moreover, L. leucocephala and V. negundo should be combined if vegetation mapping base on multispectral and vegetation indices analysis.

AB  - We characterized vine shoots, cotton stalks, Leucaena leucocephala and Chamaecytisus proliferus as pulping raw materials and found C. proliferus and cotton stalks to be the best for the intended purpose on the grounds of their increased contents in holocellulose (79.73% and 72.86%) and α-cellulose (45.37% and 58.48%), and their decreased contents in ethanol-benzene extractables (2.64% and 1.42%), hot water solubles (2.79% and 3.33%) and 1% soda solubles (16.67% and 20.34%). These properties resulted in increased pulp yields and hence in efficient use of these two types of raw material. The previous raw materials were pulped by using an ethyleneglycol concentration of 65% at 180 °C for 75 min, followed by beating at 1500 revolutions in a PFI refiner. The paper sheets obtained were characterized and those from C. proliferus found to be the best overall as they exhibited an increased breaking length (4644 m), stretch (2.87%), burst index (2.46 kN/g) tear index (0.33 m Nm2/g) and brightness (49.92% ISO); in addition C. proliferus pulp was obtained with a high-yield (62.88%). On the other hand, vine shoots provided the poorest results among the studied raw materials. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Antiproliferative and cancer-chemopreventive properties of sulfated glycosylated extract derived from Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2007

AB  - This work aimed to prove that simple chemical modification could provide new cancer chemopreventive and/or anticancer properties to the inactive extracted polysaccharide derived from Leucaena leucocephala. Polysaccharides were extracted from Leucaena leucocephala seeds and its 2,4-pentanedione-treated derivative (glycosylated form) was prepared, which is further sulphated to give sulphated glycosylated form. Estimation of their anti-initiation activity, modulation of carcinogen metabolism, was indicated by the inhibition cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and the induction of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). Anti-proliferation activity was investigated by MTT assay against human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2), breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and lymphoblastic leukemia (1301). Apoptosis/necrosis and cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results revealed that glycosylated form inhibited both CYP1A and GSTs, while sulphated glycosylated form not only inhibited CYP1A, but also induced the GSTs. Unlike GE, sulphated glycosylated form possessed a significant anti-proliferative activity against different cell lines. Analysis of HepG2 cell cycle phases demonstrated that glycosylated form led to a delay of G2/M-phase, while sulphated glycosylated form led to a concomitant arrest in S- and G2/M-phases. Investigation of apoptosis/necrosis ratio demonstrated that both of glycosylated form and sulphated glycosylated form induced HepG2 cell death by necrosis, but not apoptosis. Unmodified crude extract was neither active as cancer chemopreventive nor as anti-proliferative. In conclusion, chemical modification of Leucaena gum induced its cancer chemopreventive and anti-proliferative activities.

PY  - 2007
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34547643730&doi=10.1017%2fS0021859607007113&partnerID=40&md5=cdc4358cf61be6326b8fa020902a4c21
AB  - Four Karan/Friesian crossbred (Holstein x Tharparkar) dairy cows in late lactation (>200 days) were fed a basic diet of green maize and concentrates with an increasing proportion of Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) leaf meal (LLM). The proportion was gradually increased from 0.25 of the dry matter intake (DMI) in the first week to 0.50 in the second, 0.75 in the third and ad libitum in the fourth week. Mimosine, 3,4-dihydroxy pyridine (3,4-DHP) and 2,3-dihydroxy pyridone (2,3-DHP) levels were determined in milk, serum, urine and faecal samples. On average DMI of leucaena was 0.023-0.025, 0.025-0.027, 0.027-0.028 and 0.022-0.025 of live weight (LW) during the first, second, third and fourth week, respectively. Mimosine, 3,4-DHP and 2,3-DHP appeared in the blood serum during leucaena feeding and continued appearing up to sixth week of experimental feeding even after the withdrawal of leucaena from the 34th day onwards. Similarly, excretion of mimosine, 3,4-DHP and 2,3-DHP were observed even after withdrawal of leucaena from the diet. The feeding of LLM resulted in a reduced level of T3 (Triiodothyronine) and T4 (Thyroxine) within a week of LLM feeding. The level of T3 and T 4 improved to normal after withdrawal of LLM from the diet. The serum aspartate transferase (AST) and serum alanine transferase (ALT) activities were within the normal range. Leucaena feeding improved milk yield and composition only up to 3 weeks of feeding. The concentration of mimosine, 3,4-DHP and 2,3-DHP in milk was 0.33, 0.05 and 0.02 that of blood, respectively. The secretion of mimosine, 3,4-DHP and 2,3-DHP in the milk might be a concern for health of the offspring of leucaena-fed animals as well as human beings consuming such milk. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - The response of Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru to inoculation with native isolates of Rhizobium and commercial Rhizobium strains was studied under salt stress. The study was carried out under semi controlled conditions in greenhouse as well as under field conditions. The effect of three Rhizobium strains (JD 15, JD 16 and 4033) were compared to a control (without inoculation and without fertilization) and a mineral N fertilization treatment. Under semi controlled conditions, the best results for yields and nitrogen fixation parameters were found for the native strain of Rhizobium (JD15). In this treatment - together with the N fertilizer treatment - the highest root and shoot weights and N uptakes were found. Furthermore, the JD 15 treatment showed the highest K:Na ratio, the highest ureide contents, highest values of chlorophyll a and b in the shoot, and the best index of inoculation effectiveness. In the field experiment the development of Leucaena was poor. Nevertheless, the JD 15 treatment had positive effects fielding comparison to other treatment groups. It is suggested to study the effect of inoculations with other types of Leucaena adapted to salt stress under field conditions.

AB  - In Okinawa, leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala de Wit) has great potential as animal feed for its high protein content, but its use has been limited owing to the presence of mimosine (β-[N-(3-hydroxy-4-pyridone)]-α- aminopropionic acid) which, when ingested, causes diseases in animals. A detoxifying enzyme, mimosinase, was purified from leucaena leaves and cDNA was cloned based on the amino acid sequence. During essential oil production and fiber isolation from alpinia (Alpinia zerumbet), large volumes of solid and squeezed wastes are produced and subsequently discarded. An extraction protocol to obtain essential oils, dihydro-5,6-dehydrokawain (DDK) and enriched antioxidant phenolic extracts from fresh leaves or rhizomes of alpinia and its waste was developed. © Pesticide Science Society of Japan.

AB  - The threat of fire is always a consideration when establishing a forest restoration program. Two wildfires occurred in 2006 and 2007 in an established dry forest restoration project in Puerto Rico. The original goal of the project was to determine differential growth responses of native trees under the nurse tree Leucaena leucocephala versus in open sites. Tree species growth, mortality and response to the fires were evaluated according to their leaf habit, successional status, and prefire tolerance to environmental conditions. Results snowed that regardless of a species' leaf habit and successional status, trees attained greater height and lower mortality under nurse trees. In open sites, sprouting was the most common fire response and mature-forest and evergreen species had greater postfire survival than pioneers and deciduous species. Although nurse trees are typically used to help manage nutrient or light environments in reforestation projects, these trees also appear to provide a secondary benefit of limiting fire damage by reducing fuel load. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2008.

AB  - Computer simulations of organosolv pulping processes (ethanol - water and ethylene glycol - water mixtures) using commercial simulation software (ASPEN PLUS) have been developed in order to design the process and to establish its key points (product and byproduct mass flow balances, energy analysis, and solvent recovery degree) as well as to analyze operation conditions. Laboratory experiments, in which a deciduous wood called leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) was used as raw material, were carried out to obtain input data for the simulation. The proposed process flow sheets allow the recovery and recycling of a high percentage of used solvents (97 wt % ethanol and 88 wt % ethylene glycol), which represent a reduction of 66 and 59 wt % of fresh solvent input for ethanol and ethylene glycol, respectively. ©2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The potential of Leucaena leucocephala as an erosion control plant was investigated in terms of its capacity of root reinforcement, root profile and root shear strength. The species studied exhibited extensive, dense rooting and depth of penetration. These aspects, to some extent, could provide surficial as well as deep-seated erosion control. A high water absorption capacity would increase suction, thus potentially extracting water at the greater depth. The soil-root matrix significantly affects cohesion factor but not the angle of friction. The effect varies with increasing depth and age of plant depending on the root length density. After 6 months of growth, the cohesion factor had tremendously increased by two- to fivefold (0.1-0.5 m soil depth). This range almost reached the values of those in the 12-month treatment, indicating a high contribution of the root system to soil-root reinforcement. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main goal of this work was to set and compare site index curves for leucena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] variety Hawaii (cv K8) in Agreste of Pernambuco. The data set came from Empresa Pernambucana de Pesquisa Agropecuária (IPA), Experimental Station of Caruaru, in which 544 trees cultivated with and without organic compound were measured 19 times during the period of 1990 - 2003. The models of Schumacher, Chapman-Richards, Silva-Bailey, Mitscherlich, Weibull and Clutter-Jones were tested and compared. To select the best equations, the Index of Fit (IF), standard error of estimate (S yx %), identity model test and the graphic of residuals distribution were used and results show that the model of Clutter-Jones provided a better IF for both treatments. The graphic of residual distribution did not show tendency among the models. The model identity test showed no differences among the models tested. As Schumacher's model has been used frequently in forestry and presented the smallest number of parameters, it deserves special focus in studies of site index.

AB  - A novel Mesorhizobium group associated with Albizia kalkora [Wang et al. (2006), Syst Appl Microbiol 29, 502-517] was further characterized. The seven strains in this group showed similar protein patterns and were different from defined Mesorhizobium species in SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins. The representative strain CCBAU 61158T formed a novel Mesorhizobium lineage in phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA, atpD, glnll and nifH genes. However, its nodC gene sequence was more similar to that of Rhizobium gallicum R602spT than to those of Mesorhizobium species. DNA-DNA relatedness between CCBAU 61158T and reference strains of defined Mesorhizobium species was lower than 34.1%. These results indicated that this Mesorhizobium group was a unique genomic species. The subtropical distribution, host origin, PCR-RFLP patterns of 16S rRNA genes, fatty acid profile and a series of phenotypic characteristics could be used as distinctive features of this group. This group is therefore proposed as a novel species, Mesorhizobium albiziae sp. nov., with CCBAU 61158T (=LMG 23507T =USDA 4964T) as the type strain. Strain CCBAU 61158T could form effective nodules on Albizia julibrissin, Glycine max, Leucaena leucocephala and Phaseolus vulgaris. © 2007 IUMS.

AB  - Raising tropical livestock is an important activity in southern Mexico. Leucaena leucocephala is a plant with great potential for utilization in these areas. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are renowned for their ability to improve the nutrition of plants. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the growth response of Leucaena leucocephala to the inoculation with arbuscular endomycorrhizae and different doses of organic manure. The study was done under greenhouse conditions, in order to evaluate the effect of Arbuscular endomycorrihza and different quantities of cow manure on the development of growth and Leucaena leucocephala. The treatments had a completely randomized block design with factorial (7x2) arrangement with four replications. The application treatments resulted from the interaction of the following factors: fine pulverized cow manure (CM) in doses of 0, 0.5 ,1.0, 1.5,3.0,6.0, 12 t ha1 with and without Glomus intraradices(GI).The inoculation and application of CM was during the transplant, mixed with 10 g of sand with alfalfa roots colonized with (GI) and/or with the different doses of CM, in the six centimeters of topsoil. The variables were plant height (PH), stem diameter, (SD), number of leaves (NL), number of leaflets (N.L), root volume (RV), root dry weight (RDW), dry weight of biomass (DWB) and total percentage of endomycorrhiza colonization (PEC). The experiment lasted 180 days from planting until harvesting. The results show highly significant effects with Glomus intraradices for all variables. Cow manure was highly significant for all variables, except, stem diameter. The best response was obtained with 12 ton ha cow manure.

AB  - The objective was to look for the promising tree leaves, for feeding to livestock. The preliminary screening of tree leaves (nine species) by in vitro gas production technique revealed that leaves of Azadirachta indica, Melia azedarach, Morus alba and Leucaena leucocephala could serve as promising, alternate feed resource for ruminants. Therefore, in vivo evaluation of these tree leaves (except A. indica) along with that of Toona ciliate was assessed. Each species of the fresh tree leaves, supplemented with mineral mixture and common salt, was offered ad lib as complete feed to three bucks (Beetle × Anglo Nubian × French Alpine; 6 years old of 56.7 ± 1.12 kg BW). The data were analyzed by using completely randomized design. Bucks relished all the tree leaves (except T. ciliate) as indicated by higher (P < 0.05) voluntary DM intake and digestibility of nutrients. All the animals were in positive N-balance except those fed Toona ciliate. The N-retention was maximum in animals fed M. alba followed by that in L. leucocephala and M. azedarach. However, the DCP content of M. alba, M. azedarach and L. leucocephala was statistically comparable, while ME availability was higher (P < 0.05) from leaves of M. azedarach followed by that of M. alba, clearly indicated that leaves of M. azedarach, M. alba or L. leucocephala, supplemented with mineral mixture and common salt, could serve as an excellent complete feed for small ruminants. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study assessed the effect of phytase on the digestibility of alternative plant feed ingredients Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf meal fed to tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and on fish growth. Five treatments were used: UPI denoted the negative control diet with unfermented plant ingredients; UPIP was positive control diet with unfermented plant ingredient supplemented with 3 g/kg phosphorus (NaH2PO4); FPI indicated diet with fermented plant ingredients; FPIPTl denoted diet with fermented plant ingredients supplemented with phytase 4000 U/kg; and FPIPT2 was diet with plant ingredients fermented together with phytase 4000 U/kg. Chromic oxide was added to the diets as inert marker for digestibility study. The diets were fed to juveniles of tambaqui (70.0±6.3 g) to satiation twice daily in recirculation systems for 56 days. Results indicated high and better digestibility of protein and lipid by fish fed diet with phytase, which resulted in a corresponding better fish growth. Growth rate of the fish was high and increased from initial weight of 70 g to 132 g almost doubling the initial weight. No significant differences were found in weight gain, specific growth rate, and feed conversion ration, but performance was better in fish fed diets with phytase. The fish grew well in low dissolved oxygen levels of 4.23-4.34 mg/1, pH of 5.80-5.91 and high ammonia concentration of 1.76-2.17 mg/1 without compromising growth and physiological functions.

TI  - The nature of wetting on urban soil samples: Wetting kinetics and evaporation assessed from sessile drop shape
PY  - 2007

AB  - The understanding of soil water repellency in its complexity requires knowledge of the mechanisms leading to changes in surface characteristics. Wetting kinetics may serve as means to investigate the origin of soil water repellency, but have been scarcely investigated yet. We observe the wetting kinetics of soil samples from two locations via the time-dependent shape of sessile drop (TISED) at three temperatures. We show that drop penetration may be exceeded by evaporation for high water drop penetration time (WDPT). The time-dependent change of drop shape and apparent contact angle is explained by surface hydrophilisation including the change from Cassie-Baxter into Wenzel's state. We identify principal differences in the nature of water repellency between the two investigated locations: Only the samples from the former sewage field, Buch, lose most initial differences in wettability upon air drying and storage. Wetting of these samples requires an activation energy of 65-94 kJ mol-1, indicating chemical reactions as rate-limiting step. In contrast, wetting of the samples from the inner city park, Tiergarten, requires an activation energy of 42 kJ mol-1 for the repellent and 8-20 kJ mol-1 for the wettable samples, which suggests physico-chemical and physical processes as rate-limiting steps. Our study shows for the first time that the process of soil wetting can be monitored by TISED assessment, and that assessment of the temperature dependence of the wetting kinetics allows distinguishing between different natures of wetting and soil water repellency. It therefore represents a novel approach to investigate wetting processes. Combination of such approaches with spectroscopic investigations will help to deepen our understanding on possible causes of water repellency. They further help to understand the great variety of suggested causes of repellency and indicate locational material-specific effects rather than one general cause for water repellency.

TI  - Preliminary study on Tephrosia candida as forage alternative to Leucaena leucocephala for ruminant nutrition in Southwest Nigeria
PY  - 2007
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34548683718&partnerID=40&md5=843a62be13d47ec1e6290f9ea49e5b5d
AB  - Forage potential of Tephrosia candida as comparison with Leucaena leucocephala was investigated. Germination ability of the two forage plants was evaluated using a completely randomized design. Field trial was carried out to determine the herbage heights at 7 and 14 months post - planting (MPP), as well as the forage yield every 7 months. Tephrosia candida seeds recorded 41.25% germination, which was higher (P < 0.05) than the value of 27.00% obtained for Leucaena leucocephala seeds. At 7 MPP, the herbage height of 252 .0 cm recorded for Tephrosia candida was higher (P < 0.05) than 62.0 cm obtained from Leucaena leucocephala. At 14 MPP, the same trend was observed as the height of Tephrosia candida had reached 363.0 cm while that of Leucaena leucocephala was at 138.0 cm. A forage yield of 10.82 t/ha DM was recorded for Tephrosia candida at the first 7 - month harvest while Leucaena leucocephala had not reached the height of 100 cm marked for cut - back level. At the second 7 - month harvest, the forage yield of 9.11 t/ha DM obtained for Tephrosia candida was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the yield of 7.75 t/ha DM recorded for Leucaena leucocephala. The chemical composition of the two legumes compared well with each other in their fibre contents, ranging from 39.80 to 41.00 g/100 g DM Neutral detergent fibre, 34.30 to 36.80 g/100 g DM Acid detergent fibre, 4.20 to 4.70 g/100 g DM lignin and 30.10 to 32.10 g/100 g DM cellulose in Leucaena leucocephala and Tephrosia candida respectively. The crude protein content ranged from 21.41 g/100 g DM in Leucaena leucocephala to 17.19 g/100 g DM in Tephrosia candida, while ether extract and ash contents ranged from 9.50 to 9.00 g/100 g DM and 6.50 to 8.50 g/100 g DM respectively. Results indicate that Tephrosia candida seed is high in germination percentage and dry matter yield. Crude protein and fibre fractions are also comparable to the traditional Leucaena leucocephala as forage for ruminants.

AB  - We studied the patterns of litterfall and nutrient return to the soil under seven-year-old plantations ot Casuarina equisetifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Eucalyptus hybrid and Dalbergia sissoo established on sodic wastelands in northern India and compared them among themselves and with other plantations raised on normal soil. In the present plantations, the leaf litter ranged from 64 (D. sissoo) to 91% (C. equisetifolia) of the total aboveground tree litter production. Winter season reflected maximum leaf and total aboveground litterfall. The annual return of major nutrients (NPK) through litterfall amounted to 1.86-4.82 g m-2year-1 N (D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia respectively), 0.39-0.97 g m-2 year-1 P (D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia respectively), and 1.48-1.80 g m-2 year1 K (Eucalyptus hybrid and D. sissoo respectively). Foliage accounted for most of the nutrients (67-92%) returned through litterfall. All the plantations studied were generally more efficient in N and K nutrient use than certain other plantations.

TI  - Effects of three conventional cooking methods on vitamin C, tannin, myo-inositol phosphates contents in selected Thai vegetables
PY  - 2008

AB  - Vegetables commonly consumed in Thailand were analyzed for their vitamin C, tannin and total phytate (inositol penta- (IP5) and hexasphosphate (IP6)) contents. Three conventional household cooking methods, namely blanching, boiling and stir-frying, were used to evaluate the effects of cooking. IP5 and IP6 content were determined using ion-pair reverse-phase chromatography. Vitamin C and tannin content were analyzed spectrophotometrically. Vitamin C content for raw and cooked vegetables ranged from 0.5-83.6 to 0.2-70.8 mg/100 g, respectively. Stir-fried pagwanpa (Melientha suavis Pierre.), pagwanban (Sauropus andogynus (L) Merr.) and cowslip creeper flower (Telosma minor Craib) were excellent sources of vitamin C (64.4-70.8 mg/100 g). High tannin content was found in lead tree ("Yod-kratin", Acacia farnesiana Willd.; 1353 and 679 mg/100 g tannic acid equivalent for raw and blanched sample, respectively), while neem tree (Azdirachta indica A. Juss) contained high phytate (52 and 38 mg/100 g for raw and blanched sample, respectively). Blanching, stir-frying and boiling caused a decrease in the total vitamin C, with losses from 14% to 95%, the greatest loss being found in boiled bitter cucumber (Monordica charantia Linn.) (95%), whereas retention of total phytate and tannin was around 58-79% for phytate and 44-93% for tannin. Although conventional boiling method was an effective method to reduce tannin and phytate content in vegetables, it also reduced the content of vitamin C. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research aimed at evaluating the natural resistance of seven woods to xylophogous fungi and subterranean termites under laboratory assay. The studied woods were Leucaena leucocephala, Cordia trichotoma, Mimosa tenuiflora, Crotón sonderianus, Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, Azadirachta indica and Tectona grandis. Test samples measuring 2.54 × 2.00 × 1.00 cm (fungi) and 2.54 × 2.00 × 0.64 cm (termites), with larger dimensions in fiber direction were obtained in four positions in pith-to-bark direction. The samples were submitted by 98 days to action of Postia placenta and Polyporus fumosus fungi or 28 days to the termite Nasutitermes corniger action. To fungi, the Mimosa tenuiflora and Mimosa caesalpiniifolia woods were the more resistant and those of Azadirachta indica and Croton sonderianus the. less resistant. The fungus Postia placenta attacked more severely the tested woods. To termites, the Mimosa tenuiflora, Cordia trichotoma, and Mimosa caesalpiniifolia were the most resistant and the Leucaena leucocephala the less resistant. The coming wood, of external section of log were the more attacked. To fungi, there was an inverse relationship between the density and the loss of mass. Already for the termites, there was not relationship between the resistance, and the density of the wood.

AB  - We isolated four new ammonia-oxidizing bacterial strains from leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) grown in fields of an acid sulfate soil (ASS) in Thailand; 17SS from the surface soil and 17RS from the rhizoplane of a non-limed plot; 9SS from the surface soil and 9RS from the rhizoplane in a limed plot. The cells of all strains had the typical lobate shape of the genus Nitrosospira ("Nitrosolobus"). The percentage similarity of the 16S rRNA genes of these strains to that of Nitrosospira ("Nitrosolobus") multiformis ATCC25196T (ATCC25196T) was 99.52% (strains 17SS, 17RS and 9SS) and 99.66% (strain 9RS). These newly isolated bacteria were all identified as Nitrosospira sp. Each strain, especially 17SS isolated from ASS, had higher urease activity than that of ATCC25196T. The o-acetylserine(thiol) lyase activity of 17SS was the highest of all the isolates. At pH 6.0, every isolate and ATCC25196T were able to utilize urea as the sole nitrogen source, in particular, strain 17SS grew best. The isolates from ASS showed higher urea utility than the isolates from the rhizoplane. Strain 17SS tolerated copper at levels up to 6.3 mmol L-1, but ATCC25196T was inhibited at that concentration. © 2007 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.

AB  - The effects of soils collected from Khan Towel, Tanveer Garment, One Tech Rubber and One Tech Ply Board factories in the vicinity of Korangi and Landhi industrial areas were studied on the growth of Leucaena leucocephala under natural environmental conditions in a greenhouse. Plants of L. leucocephala which were grown in soils of Tanveer Garment factory showed reductions in many of the growth variables like root length, shoot length, seedling length, plant cover, number of leaflets, leaf area and dry weights of root, shoot and leaf and total plant dry weight (which included root, shoot and leaf dry weights) as compared to plants grown in soil of a control area (Karachi University Campus soil). Khan Towel and One Tech Rubber factory soils caused decrease in the growth parameters such as number of leaflets and dry weights of root, shoot and leaf and total plant dry weight of L. leucocephala as compared to plants in control area soil whereas root/shoot ratio was reduced in plants which were grown in One Tech Ply Board factory soil over the control soil. Growth of L. leucocephala was mostly increased in soil of a control area when compared to soil of Tanveer Garment factory. The amount of total soluble salts and available sulfate in all of the industrial areas soils were higher relative to a control area soil of Karachi University Campus. Total soluble salts and copper were found in highest extent in the soil of Khan Towel factory as compared to a control area soil. Tanveer Garment factory soil had lowest organic matter and highest amount of zinc than control soil. In the case of One Tech Rubber factory, the amount of coarse sand and concentration of Calcium carbonate was mostly increased over the control soil whereas level of chromium was higher in One Tech Rubber factory soil than a control soil. Soil of One Tech Ply Board factory had highest magnitude of available sulfate relative to the control soil. The research demonstrated that the growth of L. leucocephala was greatly reduced in plants which were grown in soil of Tanveer Garment factory than a control area soil of Karachi University Campus. Khan Towel and One Tech Rubber factory soils showed reductions in various growth variables of L leucocephala. This showed that the soil of industrial areas of Korangi and Landhi, particularly of Tanveer Garment factory followed by Khan Towel factory and One Tech Rubber factory is contaminated by the existing pollution in the area.

AB  - Poisoning of a goat by Leucaena leucocephala (Leg. Mimosoideae) in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is described. Fresh leaves of the plant were ingested as the animal's main meal for at least 4 months before it developed total alopecia. At necropsy the thyroid was moderately enlarged. Histological examination revealed a decrease in the number of hair follicles (empty or in telogenic phase), vacuolation of keratinocytes of the epidermis and hair follicles, and superficial and follicular hyperkeratosis. Myxedema was found between skeletal and cardiac muscles fibers, in the kidneys, and in the submucosa/muscular layer of the digestive tract. The thyroid follicles were enlarged and filled with copious amounts of colloid (colloidal goiter). Although L. leucocephala is common in several tropical regions, natural poisoning by this plant in goats seems to be rare. It is the first report about spontaneous poisoning in goats by L. leucocephala in Brazil.

AB  - Effects of aqueous leaf, bark and seed extracts of two tree species viz. [subabul (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) and teak (Tectona grandis L.)] were tested in bioassay and pot culture on germination, radicle length, growth and yield of maize (Zea mays L.). The leaf extract were more toxic than bark and seed and Leucaena was more inhibitory to germination (P<0.05) than Tectona. On the contrary, the Tectona growth media was more harmful to growth and yield of maize than Leucaena. The toxic effects of Leucaena followed the order: crushed seeds >leaf litter > soil root zone, while Tectona followed the order : leaf litter > crushed seeds > soil root zone. Thus Leucaena was less harmful tree than Tectona for maize intercropping in agroforestry systems of Mizoram. © International Allelopathy Foundation 2007.

AB  - Twenty dietary combination of Cenchrus ciliaris-CC grass with shrubs (Dichrostachys cineria-DC Securengia virosa-SV, Zizyphus xylophyrus-ZX, Helictris isora-HI and Acacia catechu-AC) and tree leaves (Hardwickia binata-HB, Albizia lebbek-AL, Grewia optiva-GO, Anogessus pendulla-AP and Leucaena leucocephala-LL) in 50:50 and 75:25 ratios were evaluated for in vitro gas production, nutrients degradation and metabolites production in sheep and goat inoculums. The results showed that dietary combinations of CC with SV, HI, LL and GO at both ratios had higher gas production, more nutrients degradability and higher metabolites production. Sheep and goat had more nutrients degradability and higher metabolites production at 75:25 and 50:50 ratios of CC with shrubs/tree leaves, respectively. Thus for development of silvipasture system for sheep and goat its biomass should constitute grass and shrubs/tree leaves in 75:25 and 50:50 ratios respectively.

AB  - Purple Sandpipers (Calidris maritima) are sexually dimorphic, with females larger than males. We tested the reliability of using bill length to sex individuals and estimate the sex ratio at a stopover site in Iceland in May 2003 and 2005. Feather samples from 65 of 324 captured birds were used for molecular sexing, and generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to discriminate the sexes from body measurements of the molecularly sexed birds. About 3% of the 324 individuals were misclassified by the Harding-Cassie method, and the proportion of males was 0.657 compared to 0.656 according to the best GLM. Our results showed that the reliability of determining the sex and sex ratio of Purple Sandpipers using a Harding-Cassie plot of bill length measurements was high, but that reliability was improved by including other variables in a GLM. The estimate of an uneven sex ratio in the population we studied was not due to a systematic error, and supports the conclusion of earlier studies that Purple Sandpipers exhibit an uneven sex ratio in favor of males. © 2008 Association of Field Ornithologists.

AB  - Total weight gained by small ruminants in the rainy season is lost in the dry season due to feed scarcity. Feed supplementation with dry season browse trees, legumes and grasses for ruminants is prudent. Proximate composition, acceptability using twenty four West African dwarf (WAD) goats and in vitro gas production of dry season forages were determined. Crude protein content ranged from 7.9% in Panicum maximum to 25.7% in Leucaena leucocephala. Crude fibre composition was generally high (range 56.8 - 74.1%) among the forages. Pa. maximum, Gliricidia sepium, L. leucocephala and Terminalia catappa were acceptable as coefficient of preference was above unity. Net gas production (NGP) and potential gas (PG) ranged from 41 - 59.7 ml/24 h and 98.5 - 4,545 ml, respectively. Highest (P < 0.05) and lowest (P > 0.05) gas (production were obtained in Gliricidia and Leucaena, respectively. The value for the metabolizable energy (ME) (MJ/kg DM), organic matter digestibility (OMD) (%) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) (μ ml) ranged from 8.31 - 1.88, 57.68 - 81.09 and 0.90 - 1.35, respectively. The ME, OMD and SCFA were highest (P < 0.05) in G. sepium. Methane (ml/200 mg DM) production ranged from 18 - 24, the highest being from G. sepium and the least from Pennisetum purpureum. © 2007 Academic Journals.

AB  - Rumen degradability, in vivo digestibility and intake studies were undertaken to evaluate the potential of Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia lebbeck, Moringa oleifera and Gliricidia sepium leaf meals compared with cotton seed cake as protein sources for goats. In a rumen dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) degradability study, hominy meal (HM), maize stover (MS), and isonitrogenous concentrates (220g CP/kg DM) based on Leucaena (LBC), Albizia (ABC), Moringa (MBC), Gliricidia (GBC) or cotton seed cake (CSC) were used in nylon bags, were inserted into the rumens of 4 fistulated heifers and removed after 2 to 96 hours. In an in vivo digestibility study, 20 goats were fed ad libitum maize stover, supplemented with either of the LBC, ABC, MBC, GBC or CSC concentrates. There were differences (P<0.05) in DM and CP degradability constants, both between energy feedstuffs (MS and HM) and between protein feedstuffs (leaf meals and CSC). The digestibility study showed differences in DM, organic matter (OM), CP, acid detergent fibre (ADF) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) intake between treatments (P<0.05), but the corresponding in vivo digestibility coefficients were similar across treatments (P>0.05), except for CP. Total intake varied from 302 ± 4.5 in ABC to 316 ± 0.7 g per day in CSC. Average growth rate for the goats across treatments was 26.5 ± 2.9 g/d and did not differ among treatments (P>0.05). These weights were rather lower than expected for crossbred dairy goats. This could be attributed to the short period involved in trial, that is not being long enough to allow for tangible growth rate but also due to the maize stover used as basal diet being of too low quality. However, the study suggests that the browses used could replace cotton seed cake as supplement for protein.

TI  - Potential for rural electrification based on biomass gasification in Cambodia

AB  - Around 76% of the 10,452 villages of Cambodia will still be without electricity in the year 2010. We examined the potential of biomass gasification fuelled by alternative resources of agricultural residues and woody biomass to increase rural power supply, using geographic and social economic databases provided by the Royal Government of Cambodia. About 77% of villages currently without electricity have sufficient land available for tree planting for electricity generation based on a requirement of 0.02 ha per household. Among 8008 villages with sufficient land, we assumed that those villages that had greater than 10% of households owning a television (powered by a battery or a generator) would have both a high electricity demand and a capacity to pay for electricity generation. Those 6418 villages were considered appropriate candidates for mini-grid installation by biomass gasification. This study demonstrated that while agricultural residues such as rice husks or cashew nut shells may have high energy potential, only tree farming or plantations would provide sufficient sustainable resources to supply a biomass gasification system. Cost per unit electricity generation by biomass gasification is less than diesel generation when the plant capacity factor exceeds 13%. In order to ensure long-term ecological sustainability as well as appropriate tree-farming technology for farmers, there is an urgent need for studies aimed at quantifying biomass production across multiple rotations and with different species across Cambodia. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To identify non-wood fast-growing species utilizable for pulp and paper production six Leucaena varieties were tested. Concurrently, these species were also tested for suitability as pulp materials on a laboratory scale. Biomass productivity of three Leucaena varieties (Leucaena diversifolia, Leucaena collinsii and Leucaena leucocephala) studied ranges from 67.14 to 9.44 t ha-1 (o.d.b.) under Mediterranean conditions for the year first sprouts. The main physico-chemical properties of the pulp produced from these varieties were also evaluated as functions of the following parameters: NaOH solubles, alcohol-benzene extractives, hot water extractives, lignin, α-cellulose and holocellulose. The study confirms the feasibility of the MD-organocell pulping process for Leucaena varieties. MD-organocell pulping provides an efficient delignification. In this process, the operation temperature, among studied, has a positive effect pulp measured properties. Large amounts of lignin from 83.24 to 95.05% of the initial content are removed during the pulping process, depending on the Leucaena variety. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The chemical composition and ruminal degradability of ten cultivars of Leucaena leucocephala Lam de Wit were examined using principal components analysis (PCA). Materials and methods: Chemical composition, secondary metabolite level and ruminal degradability in sheep were evaluated over three years. Using SPSS statistical software, groups of accession of the nutritive characteristics were obtained with a three-dimensional diagram. Results: A high variability for the first three components was detected (85.83%). Protein, fiber fraction, minerals and phenols, phytates and ruminal degradability showed the biggest fluctuations. Six groups with distinctive characteristics were identified, including G1: high protein quantity, low fiber proportion and secondary metabolites and high degradation -cv. CNIA-250 and cv. K-28-; G-2: High dry matter, proteins and phenols content, low fiber proportion and tannins and low ruminal degradability -cv. Ipil-Ipil-; G-3: standard chemical composition -cv. México-; G-4: low dry matter, phenols and mimosine content and high ruminal degradability -cv. Cunningham, cv. 7 and cv. América-; G-5: high contento f dry matter, phenols and medium nutritive value -cv. K-8 y cv. K-67-; G-6: high dry matter and tannin percentage, and low nutritive value (cv. Perú). Conclusions: The edible biomass of L. leucocephala cultivars Cunningham, América, 7, México, CNIA-250 and K-28 constitutes the best options for animal feeding. © 2009 Universidad de Córdoba, Montería, Colombia.

AB  - Multilocus house-keeping gene sequence analysis is a hotspot of taxonomy and phylogeny of prokaryotes. In this research, we used atpD and gln II gene sequences to analyze the phylogeny of nine rhizobia strains of Albizia spp., Acacia spp. and Leucaena leucocephala and compared the results to that of 16S rDNA. The phylogenetic relationships based on the sequence analysis of these three genes were congruent at the genera level. CCBAU43060 and CCBAU 61139 were located in the branch of Rhizobium-Agrobacterium. CCBAU51471, CCBAU35220, CCBAU51276 and CCBAU61158 belonged to the genera of Mesorhizobium. CCBAU35234, CCBAU61178 and CCBAU35085 were assigned to Bradyrhizobium. Differences were found for some strains, for example CCBAU 61158, CCBAU43060, CCBAU61178, at the species level. Insertion fragment and mosaic gene were also found in some isolates. These results indicated that there was recombination between species in the same genera. It is reliable to determine the taxonomy status at genera levels based on the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA. If the relationships between strains belonging to the same genera were studied using the phylogeny methods, researches should be carried out with more than one house-keeping genes.

AB  - The core objective of this study was to assess the effects of different dietary Leucaena leucocephala seed on the performance and some blood parameters in broiler, chick. Seeds were included at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12% in the diet of one hundred twenty one-day-old unsexed broiler chicks. The results showed that, feed intake, body weight gain and PER were significantly (p≤0.01) depressed with the inclusion of 6, 9 and 12% leucaena seeds in the diet. Feed intake, body weight gain and PER were negatively correlated (p≤0.05) with levels of inclusion of leucaena seeds. However, overall FCR, haematological parameters, plasma albumin, glucose and mortality rate were not influenced (p≤0.05) by dietary treatments. Inclusion of dietary leucaena significantly decreased plasma Ca, Na, total protein and cholesterol. While plasma Glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase GOT, alkaline phosphatase ALP and uric acid were increased with the increase in levels of leucaena in the broiler diets. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2008.

AB  - An experiment was carried out in "Rafael Rangel" Agricultural Production and Experimental Station, Trujillo state, Venezuela, in order to evaluate the germination, height, steam diameter, number, longitude and diameter of branch, quantity of leaves/branch, rate of growth; survival percentage, and plagues and diseases incidence of Moringa oleifera and Leucaena leucocephala. A totally randomized design with 20 replications/species was used. During the experimental period germination and survival of 100% in M. oleifera were showed; while inferior percentages (95 and 95%, respectively) in L. leucocephala were observed. At the end of evaluation, statistical differences were observed for M. oleifera in the stem and branch diameter, longitude of branch and quantity of leaves/branch. Nevertheless, the height, the quantity of branches, and the growth rate did not show substantial differences. M. oleifera was immune to plagues and diseases attack, and L. leucocephala was considered resistant. In general, M. oleifera exhibited better behavior than L. leucocephala in most of the measured indicators, and both species showed a satisfactory growth in the nursery phase. M. oleifera and L. leucocephala could be transplanted from the seventh and tenth week, respectively. © 2007 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - Subabul (Leucaena Leucocephala) leaves although highly palatable and rich in protein has a limitation as a fodder due to the toxic mimosine content, which generally causes hypothyroidism and alopecia in animals. Studies on the reproductive performance of female goats were carried out by feeding green subabul leaves as a sole feed or at 50% level of roughage or 100% crude protein requirements over a period of 4 weeks to 14 months. The studies showed that out of 35.5% of pregnant goats, 44.5% aborted at different stages of gestation. Feeding of 50% subabul roughage for 3 to 8 months showed that 3 out of 5 (60%) animals had conceived and 1 animal aborted, while at 100% crude protein levels, the conception rate was 80% and no abortions took place indicating that the reproductive failures and abortions were proportional to the daily ingestion of subabul leaves and mimosine. Thyroid glands of all the experimental groups were enlarged weighing 1.78 to 5.75g and exhibited colloidal and hyperplastic goitrogenic changes. Thyroid glands of the aborted fetus and the kids born to the subabul fed animals were also enlarged weighing 0.526 to 3.5g; showed parenchymatous and colloidal goiter indicating that subabul feeding not only caused hypothyroidism and reproductive failures in the female goats but also caused congenital goiter in the progeny. These finding suggested that subabul feeding would adversely affect the reproductive performance of the female animals and is hazardous.

AB  - The objective of this research was to construct a pydA-pydB hybrid gene that encodes a functional dioxygenase-hydrolase (PydA-PydB) fusion protein for degradation of 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (HP). HP is an intermediate in both synthesis and degradation of mimosine, a toxic amino acid produced by the tree legume Leucaena leucocephala. Computer-generated models of the fusion proteins suggested that joining of PydA and PydB with 0, 3, or 7 glycine residues as a linker should produce a functional PydA-PydB fusion protein. Accordingly, three hybrid genes, G0, G3, and G7, were constructed in which pydA and pydB were connected with 0, 9, and 21 nucleotides, respectively, encoding the glycine residues of the linker region. When these hybrid genes were expressed in Rhizobium and Escherichia coli, only one of them, G3, produced a functional PydA-PydB fusion protein, having both the dioxygenase and hydrolase activities. The G3 hybrid gene could complement both pydA and pydB mutants of Rhizobium, and E. coli lysate containing the overexpressed G3 protein was able to degrade HP. This hybrid gene may be useful for developing mimosine-free L. leucocephala plants in the future. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - 13C isotopic discrimination: A starting point for new insights in competition for nitrogen and water under contour hedgerow systems in tropical mountainous regions
PY  - 2007
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34548607482&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-007-9353-y&partnerID=40&md5=0689b9302e7e7a019e8e224471424e05
AB  - Competition for nutrients and water between crops and associated hedgerows reduces overall performance of contour hedgerow systems and hampers its acceptance by rural communities in tropical mountainous regions. Therefore, it is imperative to better understand competition leading to a decline in crop response close to hedges. In the highlands of North East Thailand spatial variability in grain yield of maize (Zea mays L., cv. Suwan 1) was assessed for two contour hedgerow systems based on Brachiaria ruziziensis Germain et Evrard (Ruzi grass) barriers or Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit hedges without or with fertilizer (60 kg N ha-1 and 14 kg P ha-1). Available NO3- - N was analyzed across the slope. In addition, shoot N concentration and δ13C values in leaves were measured for maize plants in the center of the alley and in the row next to and at the upper side of barriers or hedges. Despite variable field conditions, δ13C values were significantly (p < 0.05) less depleted close to the barriers or hedges, except for 2 out of 16 plots, suggesting that water deficiency was not the main driver for spatial variability along the alleys. The negative correlation between 13C isotopic discrimination and available NO3- - N in the soil, with R 2 ranging from 0.5 (p < 0.10) to 0.9 (p < 0.01), assigned a major role to N availability in the reduced crop response towards the barriers. The proposed framework of 13C isotopic discrimination, together with plant and soil N data, is a new approach and was shown to be suitable to determine N and water competition between hedgerows and crops grown in alleys under field conditions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The performance of numerous soil and pasture indicators was determined during three consecutive years in two types of silvopastoral grasslands based on Leucaena leucocephala-Panicum maximum to select those showing higher variability, detect the most useful ones, and know the degree of stability of the soil-pasture system for monitoring the management effect. The grasslands were: a) silvopastoral system on hydrated red ferrallitic soil with six years of exploitation, and b) silvopastoral system on lixiviated red ferrallitic soil with five years of exploitation. Three groups of indicators (vegetation, soil physicochemical and biological) were obtained through the analysis of principal components. Those with preponderance value higher than ± 0.78 and accounting for, at least, 65% of the accumulated variance were chosen. In the vegetation, up to 50 indicators were studied, selecting 7 and 9 out of them (for six and five years of exploitation, respectively). The plant cover, the bare soil, the density of the basic pasture, and the presence of native pastures coincided in them. Out of the 76 soil indicators, 15 and 19 were selected (for six and five years of exploitation, respectively). In them, the distribution of aggregates in humid and dry conditions, the structural stability, the value of n, the underground phytomass, the macrofauna, and the mesofauna were repeated to account for their variability. Both silvopastoral systems progressed in time by increasing the basic pasture population and its productive stability, as well as by improving their edaphic characteristics. The performance of the indicators permitted characterizing the status of the soil-plant system in each grassland, and showed that the management to which both grasslands were subject affected their ecological and productive improvement. Tables with ranges of confidence values were presented for the indicators, which could serve as useful, confident, and sensitive tools to discern the shifts occurring in each type of grassland, and that could be used in research, teaching, and production.

AB  - The leaves of 12 species (Acacia auriculiformis, Albizzia procera, Dalbergia sissoo, Gliricidia maculata, Leucaena leucocephala, Samanea saman, Azadirachta indica, Eucalyptus hybrida, Gmelina arborea, Michelia champaca, Morus alba, and Tectona grandis) of Multipurpose trees and shrubs (MPTs) grown in the agroforestry arboretum were evaluated for their nutritional characteristics in terms of proximate composition, cell wall constituents, total tannins, major (Ca and P) and trace minerals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn and Co), in vitro dry matter and organic matter digestibility (IVDMD and IVOMD) and metabolisable energy (ME) values. There were significant (P<0.01) variations among MPTs for all parameters studied. The average values of (92.02±0.30)%, (16.00±0.74)%, (3.05±0.13)%, (18.97±1.07)%, (54.00±1.12)% and (7.98 ± 0.30)% (DM basis) were observed for OM (organic matter), CP (crude protein), EE (ether extract), CF (crude fibre), NFE (nitrogen-free extract) and total ash, respectively. Leguminous trees had high CP compared to non-leguminous ones (18.30% vs 13.70%). The mean values for cell wall constituents viz., NDF (neutral detergent fibre), ADF (acid detergent fibre), hemi cellulose, cellulose and ADL (acid detergent lignin) were found to be (52.48±1.05)%, (31.72±0.97)%, (20.76±0.88)%, (16.97±0.70)% and (9.57±0.62)%, respectively. The total tannin contents averaged (4.22±0.32)%. The ratio of Ca to P was quite wider. The levels of Fe and Mn were adequate to rich in all the MPTs while many of the tree species possessed P, Cu, Zn and Co level below the critical limits for the animals. The average IVDMD and IVOMD values were found to be (48.96±1.30)% and (50.69±1.36)%, respectively. The ME value averaged (6.95±0.11) MJ·kg-1 DM. The CP content had significant positive correlation with IVDMD, IVOMD and ME values while NDF, ADF, ADL and total tannins showed negative correlations with these three parameters. Based on the results, Leucaena Leucocephala could be considered as good quality fodder as it had the highest level of IVDMD/IVOMD (65.20%/67.66%) and ME (7.95 MJ·kg-1 DM) while G. maculata, M. alba, A. indica, D. sissoo and S. saman were of medium type and rest of poor quality. © 2008 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

AB  - Vegetation can significantly contribute to stabilise sloping terrain by reinforcing the soil: this reinforcement depends on the morphological characteristics of the root systems and the tensile strength of single roots. This paper describes an investigation on the reinforcing effect of soil-root matrix in the laboratory using a modified large shear box apparatus (300 mm x 300 mm). Four different species of plant namely Vertiveria zizanoides, Leucaena leucocephala, Bixa orel-lana and Bauhiniapurpurea were planted in special boxes containing residual soil compacted to a known density. The results show that roots significantly contribute to the increase in soil shear strength. The presence of the roots only affects the apparent cohesion of the soil and no significant change in angle of friction is observed. L. leucocephala shows the outstanding increase in its root strength in which the strength varies with depth and time e.g., under soil suction-free condition (matric suction = 0), the roots have increased the cohesion by 116.6% (0.1 m), 225.0% (0.3 m) and 413.4% (0.5 m) after six months of growth. In twelve months, it is observed that the increase in cohesion is more than three-fold of the six months growth period at 0.1 m depth. The results also indicate that shear strength is influenced by root profile and to some extent, the physiological parameters of the plants. Copyright © 2005-2009 National Institute of Informatics.

AB  - The roots and rhizomes of the vegetation interact with the soil to produce a composite material in which the, roots are fibres of relatively high tensile strength and adhesion embedded in a matrix of lower tensile strength. The shear strength of the soil may therefore be enhanced by the root matrix.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) seed gum (LSG) was evaluated for disintegrant action in lactose (soluble) based tablets containing ibuprofen, a relatively insoluble drug. The properties of tablets evaluated include weight uniformity, hardness, friability, disintegration time and in vitro dissolution (k, T50, A30). LSG, at low concentration level (2% w/w), can be used as a disintegrant in tablet dosage form containing water-insoluble drug. In contrast to maize starch, LSG swells rapidly when brought in the contact with water, while preventing the liquid uptake in cylindrical column of powder. This presumably suggests that initial swelling of LSG particles generates enough pressure to elicit disintegration action in the tablet before further liquid uptake results in formation of mucilaginous, gel like coherent mass, which hinders further movement of water into the tablet matrix.

TI  - Effect of the composition of a grassland of lecucaena leucocephala with grasses on the microbial rumen population of bulls
PY  - 2007

AB  - A complete random design was used to assess the effect of the composition of the grassland of Lecucaena leucocephala in association with grasses (mixture of natural pastures) in the whole area on the microbial rumen population, specifically on mimosine and 3 hydrohy-4 (1H) pyridone degrading bacteria. Therefore, twenty-seven bulls of 147 kg of average LW were randomly selected. The treatments were: (A) grasses, (B) grasses + 30 % of the area of L. leucocephala, and (C) L. leucocephala associated at 100 % with grasses. All the animals were fed also sugarcane and mineral salts ad libitum. The population of cellulolytic bacteria was of2.93, 3.67, and 6.83 x 10 6 cfu/mL for A, B, and C, respectively. The inclusion of grazing in L. leucocephala did not modify the population of total viable bacteria, but the protozoa were reduced in 3.20 and 2.74 times when including 30 and 100 % of L. leucocephala, respectively. The mimosine and 3,4-DHP degrading bacteria were counted on the order of 10 6 cfu/mL, without differences between treatments. It is concluded that grazing leucaena associated with grasses in 100 % of the area did not vary the population of bacteria degrading mimosine and 3-4 DHP and, at the same time, increased the cellulolytic microorganisms and reduced the effect on the protozoa population, which improved the microbial rumen composition. It is recommended its use in cattle areas with these purposes in view.

PY  - 2007

AB  - The Mesorhizobium loti R7A symbiosis island contains genes encoding a VirB/D4 type IV secretion system (T4SS) similar to that of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This system has host-dependent effects on symbiosis that probably are due to translocation of two effector proteins, Msi059 and Msi061, into host cells. Here we report that, as in A. tumefaciens, the M. loti vir genes are transcriptionally regulated by a VirA/VirG two-component regulatory system. A virGN54D mutant gene of M. loti caused constitutive expression of lacZ reporter gene fusions to virB1, virD4, msi059, and msi061. Expression of these gene fusions also was activated by a NodD gene product from Rhizobium leguminosarum in the presence of the inducer naringenin, as was a virA::lacZ fusion. This activation was dependent on a nod box present 851 bp upstream of virA, and a mutant with the nod box deleted formed effective nodules on Leucaena leucocephala, the same symbiotic phenotype as other M. loti vir mutants. In contrast, the wild-type strain formed small, empty nodules whereas a nodD1 mutant was completely Nod-. These results indicate that the M. loti vir genes are induced in a symbiosis-specific manner that involves a two-tiered regulatory cascade, and that the vir effectors act after Nod factor during infection thread formation. © 2007 The American Phytopathological Society.

AB  - Lignin is a phenolic heteropolymer that constitutes the second most abundant organic constituent on earth, after cellulose. On one hand, lignin is important for plants conferring rigidity, mechanical strength, water impermeability and resistance to pathogen invasion, but on the other hand, it limits the agricultural and industrial applications of plants for mankind consequently leading to environmental and economical losses. The present article provides a highlight of various biotechnological approaches used to alter lignin content and composition of plants. The studies, including ours, that target a major lignin biosynthetic pathway enzyme, O-methyltransferase, are emphasized. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Optimal utilisation of tannin-rich browse tree fodders including Acacia spp. foliages as crude protein (CP) supplements to ruminants in the tropics is limited by less available information on their feed nutritive potential. Two studies were conducted to: (1) determine rate and extent of ruminal dry matter (DM) degradability (DMD) and (2) investigate effect of sun-dried Acacia nilotica (NLM), A. polyacantha (PLM) and Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM) supplementation on growth performance of 20 growing (7-9 months old) Small East African male goats (14.6 ± 0.68 kg) fed on native pasture hay (NPH) basal diet for 84 days in a completely randomised design experiment in north-western Tanzania. The goats were randomised into four treatment groups consisting of five animals each. Three supplement diets: 115.3 g NLM (T2), 125.9 g PLM (T3) and 124.1 g LLM (T4), which was used as a positive control, were supplemented at 20% of the expected DM intake (DMI; i.e., 3% body weight) to the three animal groups fed on NPH (basal diet) compared to the animals in a control group that were fed on NPH without browse supplementation (T1). NPH had significantly the lowest (P < 0.05) CP of 45.5 g kg-1 DM compared to NLM, PLM and LLM (159, 195 and 187 g kg-1 DM, respectively). NPH had higher (P < 0.05) fibre fractions; lower ruminal DM degradability characteristics and ME than NLM, PLM and LLM. Supplementation of the animals with browse resulted to (P < 0.05) higher average daily weight gains (ADG) of 157.1 g day-1 in T4 than the animals fed on T2 (114.3 g day-1) and T3 (42.9 g day-1), and even to those fed on T1 (control), which lost weight (-71.4 g day-1). Improved weight gains were mainly due to corrected feed nitrogen (N) or CP due to supplementation of the animals with browse fodder. Too low CP of the NPH would not meet the normal requirements of CP (80 g CP kg-1 DM) for optimal rumen microbial function in ruminants. Higher ADG due to LLM (T4) and NLM (T2) supplementation suggest optimised weight gains due to browse supplementation (20% of expected DMI); while lower weight gains from supplementation with PLM (T3) indicate the possible utilisation of A. polyacantha leaves to overcome weight losses especially during dry seasons. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of Sokoto phosphate rock (PR) and plant residues on soil phosphorus (P) fractions and crop performance was studied in the field on an alfisol in the derived savanna of southwestern Nigeria. The plant residues studied were leaves of Dactyladenia barteri, Flemingia macrophylla, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, maize (Zea mays) stover and rice (Oryza sativa) straw. They were applied alone or in combination with phosphate rock. The PR was applied at a rate of 60 kg P ha-1 and the plant residues at 5 ton dry matter ha-1 during the onset of the major rainy season. Plots without PR and plant residues application were included as control. After four weeks incubation period of PR and plant residues, Crotalaria ochroleuca (shrub legume) was planted in 1999 and maize (Zea mays) was planted in 2001 as test crops. When PR was not combined with plant residues, incubation of Dactyladenia residues increased resin P from 0.13 to 0.79 mg P kg-1 at 4 weeks after incubation (WAI). Other plant residues did not cause appreciable changes in resin P. Application of Leucaena residues increased NaOH-extractable inorganic P (Pi) from 14.36 to 20.47 mg P kg-1 at 4 WAI. Total extractable P increased under all the plant residues at 4 WAI but decreased at 8 WAI. When PR was combined with plant residues, there were increases in almost all the P fractions under the plant residues at 4 WAI followed by decreases at 8 WAI. Averaged across P levels, addition of Leucaena residues resulted in higher resin P, NaOH-Pi, residual P and total extractable P compared with the other plant residue treatments. Averaged across residue treatments, resin P increased from 0.12 mg P kg-1 to 0.75 mg P kg-1 at 4 WAI and decreased to 0.08 mg P kg-1 at 8 WAI. All other P pools showed similar trends but with less pronounced decreases at 8 WAI. When PR was not applied with plant residues, Crotalaria dry matter correlate positively with NaHCO3-Pi (R2 = 0.59), NaOH-Pi (R2 = 0.53) and total extractable P (R2 = 0.50), while Crotalaria P uptake correlate positively with NaHCO3-Pi (R2 = 0.50) at 4 WAI. Maize grain yield and P uptake did not correlate with any of the P fractions. However, when PR was applied with plant residues, maize P uptake was positively correlated with resin P (R2 = 0.53) while Crotalaria dry matter (R2 = 0.60) and P uptake (R2 = 0.49) correlate positively with NaOH-Po at 4 WAI. Application of PR alone did not affect yields and P uptakes of Crotalaria and maize crops. Compared with the control without residues, Crotalaria dry matter production and P uptake increased significantly when residues were applied. Interaction effects between PR and Leucaena and rice straw residues on Crotalaria dry matter production and P uptake was significant. Interaction effects between PR and plant residues on maize yield and P uptake were not significant. Our results suggest that combined application of PR with selected plant residues may enhance P dissolution from PR and improve crop performance in some cases. © 2007 Academic Journals.

AB  - An experiment was conducted in a semi-arid region of the Zulia State, Venezuela (10°32'N, 71°42'W), with a 600mm average annual rainfall, where the soil is a sandy-loam Aridisol, pH 5.5 and average Ca, Mg, Na, K and P content of 0.6, 0.3, 0.1, and 0.17mg/100g soil and 6 ppm, respectively. The purpose was to evaluate in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), crude protein (CP) and macroelement concentration of a buffel (Cenchrus Ciliaris) - leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) association as affected by deferment at four utilization ages (42, 84, 126, and 168 days). A randomized block experimental design with three replicates was used. Samples consisting of leaf and stems of buffel grass and fine fraction (pinnae, petioles and stems <5mm in diameter) of leucaena were analyzed for CP, IVOMD, Ca, P, Mg, and Na content. In buffel, CP (8,66%) and K (3,65%) contents were considered adequate for grazing ruminants, while Ca, P, Mg, and Na were deficient. In leucaena CP, Ca, Mg, and K were adequate, while P and Na were below the critical deficiency level. Only Na concentration increased (P<0,05) with increasing maturity.

AB  - The effects of soil extracts from Khan Towel, Tanveer Garment, One Tech Rubber, and One Tech Ply Board factories in the vicinity of Korangi and Landhi industrial areas on seed germination and growth of cultivated plants like Albizia lebbeck, Leucaena leucocephala, Thespesia populnea, and Peltophorum pterocarpum and naturally growing plants such as Prosopis juliflora (Karachi University and Korangi and Landhi industrial areas) were studied under laboratory conditions. Soil extract of Khan Towel factory soil caused percentage reductions in seedling dry weight (66.7%) of L. leucocephala and seed germination (5.3%) of P. pterocarpum relative to the control soil extract (Karachi University soil). Soil extract from Tanveer Garment factory soil induced percentage reductions in many growth variables like seed germination (60.9%), root (84.2%), shoot (54.1%) and seedling length (which include shoot length also) (72.2%) of L. leucocephala over the control. Percentage was also reduced in seed germination (50%), root (27.9%), and seedling length (6.6%) of T. populnea from Tanveer Garment factory soil as compared with the control. Soil extract of One Tech Rubber factory caused percent reductions in root (58.5%), shoot (46.9%), and seedling length (48.6%) of A. lebbeck relative to the control. Soil extract of One Tech Ply Board factory soil induced percentage reductions in root (11.3%), shoot (8.1%), and seedling length (9.8%) of Prosopis juliflora (seeds were collected from Karachi University) over the control. Highest amount of total soluble salts (137.3%) was found in the soil of Khan Towel factory as compared with the control. Tanveer Garment factory had lower amount of organic matter (55%) in soil and higher amount of zinc (733.3%) in soil extract relative to the control. In the case of One Tech Rubber factory the concentrations of calcium carbonate (105.1%) in soil and ferric (9.3%) in soil extract were higher over the control. Soil of One Tech Ply Board factory had higher amount of organic matter (65%) and available sulfate (7500%) and reduced concentration of calcium carbonate (1.7%) over the control. The amount of ferric (28.5%) was high in soil extract from One Tech Ply Board factory relative to the control. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fifteen indigenous nondescript kids (8.2 kg; 8 months initial age), randomly allotted into three equal groups, were used to study the effects of supplementation of extra iodine on their performance when fed a leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf meal containing diet. Group I (CON) was fed a control concentrate supplement consisting of a conventional protein source whereas the other two groups (LL and LLI) were fed a concentrate containing leucaena leaf meal so as to supply 0.5 of the net crude protein (CP) requirements. Additionally, animals in group LLI were given supplemental iodine (as potassium iodide solution) at 0.25 mg/head/day. Wheat straw was provided ad libitum as the sole source of roughage during the 120 days of the experimental period. A metabolism trial, conducted at the end of the feeding trial, revealed no variation in the dry matter intake (DMI) among the groups. A significant (P<0.01) decline was evident in digestibility of CP in both the leucaena-fed groups (0.463 and 0.482 versus 0.586) whilst that of the other organic components remained unaffected. Animals on the LL diet exhibited lower (P<0.01) nitrogen retention and average daily gain (ADG) in live weight (LW). Blood collected periodically was analysed for the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) as well as other biochemical parameters. At the end of the experimental feeding, the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response of the goats was assessed by intra-dermal inoculation of phytohaemagglutinin-P and measuring the change in skin thickness at various post-inoculation hours. The results revealed that the serum concentration of glucose was significantly (P<0.05) higher in the LLI group of animals fed leucaena with iodine. The concentration of cholesterol in serum of LL animals increased significantly (P<0.05) compared to the CON and LLI groups. No variation due to dietary interventions was evident in other indices of metabolic profile. While the concentration of circulating T3 remained unaffected due to dietary intervention, that of T4 reduced significantly (P<0.05) in the LL group. Moreover, the T4 concentration in the LLI group remained similar to that of control indicative of positive impact of iodine supplementation. The immune response revealed that the skin thickness of animals in the LL group was lower (P<0.05) as compared to the control, indicating a compromise of CMI response due to feeding of leucaena leaf meal. Supplementation of iodine appeared to be partially effective in potentiating the response. In conclusion, iodine supplementation could be adopted as a strategic management strategy to ameliorate the negative impacts of feeding leucaena leaf meal in growing kids. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the associated zoological diversity of a silvopastural system leucaena-guinea grass, by characterizing the composition and structures of the birds, insects and the macrofauna of the soil, in four establishment times of the silvopastural systems (3, 4, 5 and 6 years of exploitation). For the species recorded in each zoological group, the following ecological indices were determined: number of individuals, richness, diversity and abundance of species, in each establishment times of the system. A significant increase, in all the zoological groups, was observed for the richness of species and for the index of biological diversity of Shannon, as the system developed. An increase in the abundance of bioregulator insects was observed, and for the birds, the sampling time showed no interaction with the different sowing years. The macrofauna of the soil increased during the management of the system, and a dominance of annelids (Polyferetrina elongata and Oligochaeta elegans) was noted during the 6th and 7th year of exploitation. The silvopastural system leucaenaguinea grass increases the biomass production and other biological components, and contributes to create a sustainable system which is compatible with the environment.

AB  - We measured the values for biomass and mean annual biomass increment (MAI) of planted forests in two parts of the Tropical Dry climatic zone (mean annual precipitation [MAP] < 1,000 mm) and in one site adjacent to one of the two parts and outside the Tropical Dry climatic zone to provide a comparison value for wet forests in the same region. MAI values of four planted forests averaged 2.60 (± 1.61 SD) Mg ha-1 y-1 at a MAP of 637 mm in the central dry zone of Myanmar. The MAI of exotic fast-growing tree species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn.) did not differ significantly from those of three native non-fast-growing tree species in the central dry zone of Myanmar. MAI values appeared to be lower on land with a high gravel content in the soil or with a higher degree of erosion. In the eastern part of Sumba Island in Indonesia, MAI of planted Tectona grandis L. forest equaled 3.76 Mg ha -1 y-1 at a MAP of 500 mm and 4.49 Mg ha-1 y-1 at a MAP of 1,500 mm. A Leucaena leucocephala de Wit stand produced a higher MAI (9.62 Mg ha-1 y-1) at a MAP of 500 mm. The MAI values for fast-growing tree species that we measured or collected in the Tropical Dry climatic zone were less than 20% of those recorded in the Tropical Moist and Tropical Wet climatic zones and about one-third the value for forests of non-fast-growing tree species. Accordingly, fast-growing tree species may not be capable of achieving their fast growth rates under the Tropical Dry climate. This information will be useful in developing land-use programs based on plantation forestry in dry forest areas.

AB  - As part of an island-wide project to identify and eradicate potentially invasive plant species before they become established, a program of inventories is being carried out in the urban and agricultural zones of the four inhabited islands in Galapagos. This study reports the results of the inventory from Puerto Villamil, a coastal village representing the urban zone of Isabela Island. We visited all 1193 village properties to record the presence of the introduced plants. in addition, information was collected from half of the properties to determine evidence for potential invasiveness of the plant species. We recorded 261 vascular taxa, 13 of which were new records for Galapagos. Most of the species were intentionally grown (cultivated) (73.3%) and used principally as ornamentals. The most frequent taxa we encountered were Cocos nucifera (coconut tree) (22.1%) as a cultivated plant and Paspalum vaginatum (salt water couch) (13.2%) as a non cultivated plant. In addition 39 taxa were naturalized. On the basis of the invasiveness study, we recommend five species for eradication (Albutdon dianthum, Datura inoxia, Datura metel,.Senna alata and Solanum capsicoides), one species for hybridization studies (Opuntia ficus-indica) and three species for control (Furcraea hexapetala, Leucaena leucocephala and Paspalum vaginatum). © 2007 Guézou et al.

AB  - Soil nutrient depletion as a result of continuous cultivation of soils without adequate addition of external inputs is a major challenge in the highlands of Kenya. An experiment was set up in Meru South District, Kenya in 2000 to investigate the effects of different soil-incorporated organic (manure, Tithonia diversifolia, Calliandra calothyrsus, Leucaena leucocephala) and mineral fertilizer inputs on maize yield, and soil chemical properties over seven seasons. On average, tithonia treatments (with or without half recommended rate of mineral fertilizer) gave the highest grain yield (5.5 and 5.4 Mg ha-1 respectively) while the control treatment gave the lowest yield (1.5 Mg ha-1). After 2 years of trial implementation, total soil carbon and nitrogen contents were improved with the application of organic residues, and manure in particular improved soil calcium content. Results of the economic analysis indicated that on average across the seven seasons, tithonia with half recommended rate of mineral fertilizer treatment recorded the highest net benefit (USD 787 ha-1) while the control recorded the lowest (USD 272 ha-1). However, returns to labor or benefit-cost ratios were in most cases not significantly improved when organic materials were used. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - The main objective of the present work was to evaluate the use of the leucena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) of Wit] as direct pasture in the field. A multivariate silvopastoral experiment with repeated measures, carried out in the experimental station of Pernambucana Company of Agricultural Research (IPA) in Caruaru, Agreste of Pernambuco, was used for this purpose. The plant spacing of 0.5m x 1.0m, 1.0m x 1.0m and 1.5m x 1.0m with the heights of cut of 20cm, 40cm and 60cm, was tested. The measurements have been carried through at same month of the year (August) along five years. The presented result shows that the measures along the time are correlated and there were significant differences among the plant spacing during the period of the experiment. No significant differences among the heights of cut and its interactions with the plant spacing occurred. Because of a larger number of plants per unit area, yielding greater productivity of biomass per hectare, the plant spacing of 0.5m x 1.0m is recommended for silvopastoral systems in the Agreste of Pernambuco.

AB  - The dearth of cellulosic fibers has compelled the paper technocrats to search for high yielding and fast growing trees. Leucaena leucocephala has solved the manifold purposes of both farmers as well as paper manufacturers. However, paper manufacturers face the serious problem of fluff in the drying section of paper machine with this furnish. L. leucocephala of the same species was cut after 2, 3 and 4 years and was analyzed for, morphological, chemical and pulp evaluation characteristics. The fibers of 2 and 3 years old of L. leucocephala are immature and consist of more non-fibrous elements i.e. vessels and parenchymatous cells. When such type of fibers are subjected to mechanical attrition for removal of primary wall, cause more fiber cuttings instead of fibrillation. The primary wall is permeable to water but does not participate in bond formation. These non-fibrous elements have larger surface area than fibers and their presence affects fiber bonding adversely. The loosely bonded fibers from the paper sheet adhere on press rolls or dryers during sheet making and contribute to fluff problem. L. leucocephala cut after 4 years of cultivation does not show fluff problem because of complete cellulose formation of fibers.

AB  - Allelopathic effects of different doses of Eucalyptus camaldulensis leaf litters were investigated through an experiment in the green house of Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences, Chittagong, Bangladesh. Three popular agricultural crops: Falen (Vigna unguiculata), Chickpea (Cicer arietinum), Arhor (Cajanus cajan) and two widely used plantation trees: Sada koroi (Albizia procera) and Ipil ipil (Leucaena leucocephala) were selected as bioassay species. Experiment was set on tray at room temperature 27°C. The effects of different doses of leaf litter extracts were compared to the control. Results suggest that leaf litters of E. camaldulesis induced inhibitory effects. It was also found that the effect depend on concentration of extract and litterfall, type of receiver species. Higher concentration of the materials had the higher effect and vice versa. Though all the bioassay species were suppressed some of them showed better performance. Vigna unguiculata, Cicer arietinum are recommended in agroforestry based on this present Experiment output. In mixed plantation, Leucaena leucochephala is a better choice while compared to Albizia procera. © 2008 Northeast Forestry University.

TI  - Optimizing fly-ash dose for better tree growth and nutrient supply in an agroforestry system in semi-arid tropical India
PY  - 2007

AB  - Research on fly-ash utilization in dryland Alfisols in semi-arid tropical India may help successful establishment of agroforestry systems. A field study was conducted during 2001-2004 with the objective of evaluating fly-ash using different levels (0, 17, 33, and 66% v/v) in tree microsites along with compost and tank silt mixtures. Specifically, the focus was to find the optimum dose of fly-ash mixtures for tree growth and nutrient release with time of both essential and heavy elements in fly-ash and soil: phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), aluminium (Al), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd) and their effect on plant tissues with respect to copper (Cu), Zn, Cd, nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb). The changes in plant-available or extractable status of elements and the growth of two major tree species [viz., teak (Tectona grandis) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala)] were monitored at 6-month intervals during 2002-2004 in an agrisilvicultural system. Pit mixtures with 66% fly-ash by volume of pit significantly increased the tree growth of teak throughout the study period. For leucaena, it positively influenced the growth at initial stages. The dose increased the status of available P, K, Ca, and Na during the study period. The exchangeable Al and available Zn content of microsites corresponding to the dose significantly increased during 2001-2003 but the levels were less than the toxic limits. The available Cd content showed an increase only during the initial stage of the study period. The variation in heavy-metal content (Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in plant tissues among the different treatments was found to be nonsignificant. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Twenty three (36 mo of age) Criollo Limonero (CL) steers were subjected to supplementation treatments during 158 d of fattening on pasture as follows: T1= a non-suplemented control group, grazing Echinochloa polystachia grass; T2=grazing plus 1 Kg/d/head of a concentrate to 11 % CP, and T3=grazing plus 1 h/d of pruning an arboreal legume (Leucaena leucocephala). Animals were slaughtered, and 48 h postmortem, longissimus muscle samples were removed from their carcasses to evaluate cooking traits (CT), Wamer-Bratzler shear force (WBS) and palatability attributes by consumer panelists, at four ageing periods (2, 7, 14 and 21 d). Analysis of variance-covariance was conducted by the least squares method. WBS values and CT were not influenced by feed supplementation (P>0.05). Consumers only detected significant differences on flavor intensity (P=0.04) favoring Leucaena supplementation, but in general, the CL steaks had a good consumer acceptability (>57%), even though the steaks from supplemented animal (concentrate or Leucaena) were categorized mostly as tender meat (>82%). Ageing periods longer than 14 d., guaranteed a higher proportion of tender beef, but their acceptability were affected negatively (<52%). In conclusion, even though differences among treatments were not detected, meats from the supplemented animals with Leucaena had a good acceptability by consumers (58%) and showed a high proportion (84%) of tender meats (WBS<3.88kg). Regardless of feed supplementation, steaks derived from CL steers were categorized mostly (76.55%) as "tender meat".

AB  - The beneficial effects of planting mixtures comprising of fly ash at the rate of 66%, 33% and 17% by soil volume were assessed for the early growth of two economic tree species, teak (Tectona grandis) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) in rainfed Semi-Arid Tropical (SAT) Alfisols in India. Measurements of tree growth were made at six monthly intervals over a 3-year period. Fly ash at 66% by soil volume of the planting pit significantly increased the diameter of teak at breast height (dbh). In leucaena, application of fly ash at 17% by soil volume was found to be effective in increasing dbh during most of the study period. Changes in soil physicochemical properties (bulk density, water retention at 0.033 and 1.5 MPa, profile moisture content, pH, soluble salt content and organic carbon) were simultaneously studied. Among these soil properties, plant available water (PAW) and organic carbon (OC) contents explained variations in diameter at breast height (dbh) in teak during most of the sampling period, while none of the soil properties significantly explained dbh in leucaena. The highest dose of fly ash applied (66% by volume) decreased bulk density (BD) and increased PAW in teak and to an extent in leucaena during the first 2 years of tree growth. Higher profile moisture content was noted in pits treated with 66% fly ash during the dry period of November (after the end of seasonal rainfall which occurred from June to October) during the first and second year after application. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Protein source is a limiting factor in poultry feed production in the tropics. Therefore, the suitability of leaves of Leucaena leucocephala - a protein rich multi-purpose leguminous plant as feed supplement in laying hens was evaluated at 50, 100 and 200 g/kg (5, 10 and 20%) supplementation levels. Leucaena supplementation significantly decreased weekly average daily egg lay (P < 0.01) and progressively reduced cumulative weekly average daily egg lay to 88.2, 68.7 and 53.4% for 5, 10 and 20% supplementation levels, respectively. There was an inverse relationship between level of L. leucocephala supplementation and weekly average daily egg lay (r = - 0.99) which highly correlated with the crude fiber content of the diets (r = 0.94). Size and specific gravity of eggs were not significantly affected (P >0.05) by the different levels of leucaena supplementation. These results suggest that L. leucocephala leaves may only be useful as feed supplement in egg laying hens at low levels of supplementation. © 2008 Academic Journals.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala leaves (LL) were ensiled by mixing with 20% rice bran and 20% water (fresh LL basis). The material was kept for 21, 51, 81 and 111 days in vacuumed double layer plastic bags, each containing 26 kg. Five bags were randomly taken at each interval for quality evaluation by organoleptic test as well as by organic acid and chemical analysis. It was found that the ensiling period did not have much influence on most of the chemical compositions. All samples of leucaena leaf silage (LLS) had pH of 4.4-4.5 and 35.22-35.65% DM (dry matter). The compositions on DM basis were 21.49-22.29% CP (crude protein), 7.76-8.22% EE (ether extract), 31.18-33.68% NDF (neutral detergent fiber), 2.0-2.9% acetate and 6.9-9.7% lactate (DM basis). DM loss was 10.35-12.32% which was in the normal range for good quality silage. The most interesting points were the increment of β-carotene after ensiling from 88.50 to 99.92-120.25 mg/kg DM while mimosine content decreased over 90% (from 1.79 to 0.12-0.16% of DM) which were superior to a drying method. It indicated that LLS is a good alternative for preserving LL and for reduction of mimosine.

AB  - The phytotoxic mechanism of mimosine and its effects on phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5) and peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7) activities as well as lignin content in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) roots were investigated. Seedlings (3-d-old) were cultivated in half-strength Hoagland nutrient solution (pH 6.0) with or without 0.05 to 1.0 mM mimosine in a growth chamber (25°C, 12/12 h light/dark photoperiod, irradiance of 280 μmol m-2 s-1) for 24 h. In general, length and fresh and dry weights of roots decreased in response to mimosine. Root growth inhibition has been associated with reduction in PAL and POD activities and lignin content. These findings suggest that PAL and POD enzymes are responsible for the mimosine allelochemical action. © International Allelopathy Foundation 2008.

AB  - Plant maturity effects on the contents of crude protein (CP), neutral (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVDOM) were evaluated in the species Leucaena leucocephala and L. trichodes at 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 days of sprout age. Plants were arranged randomly in a 2x5 experimental design, with three repetitions of eight plants each. The area is located in a tropical dry forest region, with an average yearly rainfall of 800 mm, and a loamy texture soil with a pH of 5.8. Samples analyzed included leaves and shafts lower than 6 mm of diameter. The statistical analysis included as variation sources specie and cutting age (fixed factors), and its interactions. Estimates of CP, NDF and ADF were higher in the specie L. trichodes (P<0.001) with values of 25.7 vs. 24.3, 33.8 vs. 30.5, and 24.3 vs. 22.1%. Maturity had limited effects on most variables: CP decreased whereas the remainder variables increased. These variations were always smallest in L. trichodes. The IVDOM estimate was higher in L. leucocephala (P<0.001) with mean values of 80.7 vs. 77.7%. The nutrient content and OM digestibility recorded for these species showed its high potential as forage source for ruminant nutrition in tropical areas. © 2007 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to assess the effect of leaf litter of Leucaena leucocephala on two forest crops Sada koroi (Albizia procera), Ipil ipil (L. leucocephala) and three agricultural crops Falen (Vigna unguiculata), Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and Arhor (Cajanus cajan) in the nursery of the Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences, Chittagong University, Bangladesh, in a Randomized Block Design. Results suggested that leaf litters of L. leucocephala induced inhibitory effects on germination and growth of bioassay. It was also found that the effect depended on concentration of extract and litterfall, type of receptor species. Higher concentration of the materials had the higher effect and vice versa. Growth response of receptor crops varied with the variation of leaf litter application. The study revealed that application of low-dose leaf litter specially litter of 10 g•m-2 had stimulating effect on shoot growth of C. arietinum, V. unguiculata and A. procera. While in all other cases significant inhibitory effect was observed and it was significantly increased with the increase of leaf litter application. However, the trend of inhibition was uneven with treatments. Root growth was found to be more affected than shoot growth. © 2008 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

AB  - A bacterial isolate STM 905, having high mimosine degradation ability, was isolated from the rhizosphere of Leucaena leucocephala. The cells of this strain were rod shaped, Gram negative, motile, could grow in pH range of 5.0-11.0 and temperature range 15-42 °C. On 16S rDNA sequence analysis based identification the strain STM 905 was found to be closest to Pseudomonas putida strain BH. Growth of this bacterium in the presence of mimosine, as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, was correlated with the induction of an enzyme capable of mimosine degradation. This enzyme catalyses the degradation of mimosine to their corresponding 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone (DHP), pyruvic acid and ammonia. The maximum induction of mimosine degradation enzyme activity has been observed at 15-h growth of culture. The presence of glucose in the culture medium inhibited the mimosine degradation enzyme induction by mimosine, while the presence of NH4Cl in the growth medium had no significant effect of inhibition on mimosine degradation enzyme induction. The mimosine degradation enzyme was purified with 47% recovery in three steps, ammonium sulphate fractionation, ion exchange and size exclusion-chromatography, with overall 34.59-fold purification. The purified native form had an estimated molecular mass of 280 kDa and was found to composed of four subunits each of molecular mass ∼70 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. Km for mimosine was found to be 1.3 mM. The purified enzyme showed sharp pH optima at 7.2. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thirty each of growing male kids and ram lambs were stall fed ad libitum on fresh, hand chopped Napier Bajra-21 (NB-21) and supplemented with either concentrates (Maize grain (MG) + deoiled groundnut cake (GNC) alone (T-1) or along with groundnut haulms (T-2), dried leaf meal of Leucaena leucocephala (T-3), Sesbania grandiflora (T-4), Gliricidia maculata (T-5) or Ficus bengalensis (T-6) to meet 30 % of DM requirements. The effect of supplementation on rumen fermentation pattern, digestibility of nutrients and growth performance was studied in two parallel growth trials (180 days). The concentration of rumen metabolites except total N was higher (P<0.01) in rams than in bucks across treatments and among the treatments, T-1 or T-4 sustained higher (P<0.01) concentration of rumen metabolites. Nutrient digestibility except CP was higher (P<0.01) in kids than in lambs while among treatments, the digestibility of OM, CF, ADF and cellulose was comparable.The digestibility of CP and NDF was lower (P<0.05) in T-6 than in other treatments. The nitrogen retention (g/d) and % of intake or absorbed in lambs was higher (P<0.05) in kids than in lambs and among treatments, higher (P<0.01) nitrogen retention was observed in T-3 or T-4 fed animals. The ADG was less (P<0.01) and the EFU was inferior (P<0.01) in kids than in lambs due to lower (P<0.01) DMI from NB21, and roughage supplements. Among treatments, the ADG was comparable while the EFU was superior (P<0.01) in animals fed T-3, T-4 or T-5 than in T-2 or T-6. Supplementation with legume tree leaves (T-3 to T-5) was beneficial for economic and sustainable production of ram lambs whereas, intensive system of management was not successful with kids due to low DMI from basal roughage and roughage supplements.

TI  - Legume effect for enhancing productivity and nutrient use-efficiency in major cropping systems - An Indian perspective: A review
PY  - 2007

AB  - Inclusion of legumes in the cropping system has been known since times immemorial. Legume is a natural mini-nitrogen manufacturing factory in the field and the farmers by growing these crops can play a vital role in increasing indigenous nitrogen production. Legume help in solubilizing insoluble P in soil, improving the soil physical environment, increasing soil microbial activity, and restoring organic matter, and also has smothering effect on weed. The carryover of N derived from legume grown, either in crop sequence or in intercropping system for succeeding crops, is also important. In a country like India, where the average consumption of plant nutrients from chemical fertilizers on national basis is very low, the scope for exploiting direct and residual fertility due to legumes has obviously a great potential. This article deals with the beneficial effect of important legumes on increasing productivity and nutrient use-efficiency in various systems. Sorghum, pearl millet, maize, and castor are mainstay in dry lands and marginal and sub-marginal lands. Sorghum yield increased when sown after cowpea, green gram, and groundnut. Grain legumes like groundnut or cowpea provide an equivalent to 60 kg N ha on the subsequent crop of pearl millet. Various studies have shown that among legume/cereal intercropping system, the combination of maize/pigeon pea is considered to be highly suitable with a minimum competition for nutrients, while legume/legume intercropping system, pigeon pea/groundnut system is the most efficient one in terms of resource use-efficiency. In alley cropping system, Leucaena leucocephala (Subabul) prunings provide N to the extent of 75 kg, which benefits the intercrop castor and sorghum. Nitrogen economy through intercropped legume is still a researchable issue because the key point for leguminous crop grown in intercropping system is the problem of nodulation. Incorporation of whole plant of summer green gram/black gram into soil (after picking pods) before transplanting rice resulted in the economizing (40-60 kg N ha-1, 30 kg P2O5, and 15 kg K2O per ha) of rice in rice-wheat system. Similarly, 6-8 weeks old green manure crop of sunhemp or dhaincha accumulates about 3-4 t ha-1 dry matter and 100-120 kg N ha-1 which, when incorporated in situ, supplements up to 50% of the total N requirement of rice. Legumes with indeterminate growth are more efficient in N2 fixation than determinate types. Fodder legumes in general are more potent in increasing the productivity of succeeding cereals. The carryover of N for succeeding crops may be 60-120 kg in berseem, 75 kg in Indian clover, 75 kg in cluster bean, 35-60 kg in fodder cowpea, 68 kg in chickpea, 55 kg in black gram, 54-58 kg in groundnut, 50-51 kg in soybean, 50 kg in Lathyrus, and 36-42 kg per ha in pigeon pea. Direct and residual effect of partially acidulated material and mixture of rock phosphate + single superphosphate were observed to be better when these were applied to green gram in winter season than to rice in rainy season simply because of legume effect. © 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB  - In this study, a chemical modification of the polysaccharides extract (E) derived from Leucaena leucocephala seeds was performed to prepare C-glycosidic 2-propanol derivative (PE), and its sulphated derivative (SPE). This study aimed to characterize immunomodulatory activities of the original extract and its derivatives by exploring their effects on Raw macrophage 264.7 functions and their antioxidant activity. Our results indicated that PE was an effective radical scavenger to hydroxyl, peroxyl, and superoxide anion radicals, and SPE was a peroxyl radical scavenger. PE and SPE were found to influence the macrophage functions. Both of PE and SPE enhanced the macrophage proliferation and phagocytosis of FITC-zymosan; PE inhibited nitric oxide (NO) generation and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Raw macrophage 264.7. In contrast, SPE over-induced NO generation and TNF-α secretion. Moreover, PE strongly inhibited the binding affinity of FITC-LPS to Raw 264.7, as indicated by flow cytometry analysis. These findings revealed that PE may act as a potent anti-inflammatory agent; however SPE may act as an inducer of macrophage functions against pathogens. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seven bean rhizobial strains EBRI 2, 3, 21, 24, 26, 27 and 29 identified as Rhizobium etli, and EBRI 32 identified as Rhizobium gallicum, isolated from Egyptian soils and which nodulated Phaseolus vulgaris efficiently, were subjected to hybridization with a nifH probe in order to estimate the copy number of this gene. Seven strains (EBRI 2, 3, 21, 24, 26, 27 and 29) which were only able to nodulate Phaseolus vulgaris, contained three copies of the nifH gene, consistent with their identification as Rhizobium etli bv. phaseoli. Only one strain (EBRI 32) which nodulated both Phaseolus vulgaris and Leucaena leucocephala, had one copy of nifH gene. This confirmed the classification of this strain as Rhizobium gallicum bv. gallicum. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Microfungi were collected in southern Mexico in the vicinity of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca in 2007. In 2006, samples were gathered from Acacia myrmecophytes [(Remarkable microfungi from Oaxaca of Acacia species) Part I]. In the present investigation [Part II], we collected microfungi from different parts of a variety of wild and cultivated higher plants belonging to the families Anacardiaceae, Caricaceae, Fabaceae, Moraceae, and Nyctaginacae. The microfungi found here live as parasites or saprophytes. Interestingly, the species Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (Sacc. and Magn.) Briosi and Cavara has repeatedly been used to cause fungal infections of Phaseolus lunatus leaves in laboratory experiments. We could now find the same fungus as parasite on the same host plants under field conditions showing that results obtained in the laboratory are also relevant in nature. Most of the fungal species collected belong to the classes Ascomycotina, Basidiomycotina and Deuteromycotina. Until now, some of the microfungi identified in this study have been rarely observed before or have been reported for the first time in Mexico, for example: Pestalotia acaciae Thüm. on Acacia collinsii Safford; Corynespora cassiicola (Berk. and M.A. Curtis) C.T. Wei on Carica papaya L.; Botryosphaeria ribis Grossenb. and Duggar and Cercosporella leucaenae (Raghu Ram and Mallaiah) U. Braun (new for Mexico) and Camptomeris leucaenae (F.

AB  - This experiment was set up to compare the effect of Tephrosia candida and Leucaena leucocephala on the forage improvement of Panicum maximum and Andropogon gayanus. Both the browse trees and the grasses were purposely interplanted to assess the effects of the former on the latter. Harvesting of the grasses was carried out every six weeks to determine the annual yield. Harvested grasses were analyzed for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and ether extract (EE). The effects of browse trees were positive on the yield of grasses, as the grass plots without the trees were lowest in dry matter yield. Leucaena leucocephala permitted a relatively higher biomass of Panicum maximum than those planted with Tephrosia candida. Andropogon gayanus behaved differently as Tephrosia candida favoured its forage yield than as observed for Leucaena leucocephala. Effects of browse trees on nutrient composition of the two grasses were not obvious. Crude protein (9.4%) content of Panicum maximum was higher than that recorded (6.7%) for Andropogon gayanus. Neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and lignin were moderate for the two grasses. The study indicated that Tephrosia candida and Leucaena leucocephala improved the yield of Panicum maximum and Andropogon gayanus when compared to the grasses without tree interplanting. Both the trees and grasses can be used strategically for the managements and production of ruminants.

PY  - 2008

AB  - One of the major obstacles for livestock productivity in the tropics is the low protein diets that animals consume. Leucaena leucocephala and cassava peels are respective cheap sources of protein and energy for West African dwarf goats (WAD), where conventional feed ingredients are scarce. The study examined the utilisation of a stepwise replacement of cassava peels (CSP) with Leucaena leucocephala (LL) as diets A ( 100% CSP), B (85% CSP + 15% LL), C (70% CSP + 30% LL) and D (55% CSP + 45% LL), to monitor feed intake, digestibility and weight gain of WAD goats. Results showed that there were significant differences (p<0.05) in feed DM intake (range 137.89-235.14 g/day), crude protein (CP) intake (range 2.58-6.19 g/d/kg W0.75), weight gain (range -3.78-43.0 g/d), apparent digestibility of CP (range 65.80-86.51%), dry matter digestibility (range 71.75-77.39%), nitrogen balance (range 0.9-4.38 g/d) and nitrogen retention (range 0.82-4.09 g/d). Goats fed with 55% CSP + 45% LL had highest feed intake and the least for those on sole CSP. Weight gain (43.0 g/d) of goats fed 45% LL increased significantly while those fed on sole CSP lost weight. Apparent dry matter digestibility was highest (p<0.05) in goats for 45% LL but lowest for that in 0% LL. Dry matter digestibility of goats on 30% LL was significantly higher than those for 0, 15 and 45% LL. Nitrogen balance was apparently highest in goats consuming 45% LL and the least for 0% LL. The N retention of the goats on 45% diet was significantly higher (p<0.05) than that for 0% diet. It can be concluded that given sole cassava diets to goats seemed to be detrimental but when substituted with browse plants, a protein source such as Leucaena leucocephala up to 45% may be beneficial.

AB  - Alley cropping has been recommended as alternative land use to slash-and-burn agriculture in humid tropics. However, interespecific competition between cash crop and hedgerow can reduce this potential. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of maize crop in a leguminous tree alley cropping. A random block experimental design was adopted, with four replicates and five treatments: alleys of "sombreiro" (Clitoria fairchildiana), inga (Inga edulis), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and a control treatment without alley. C and N partitioning, grain yield, 1000 grain mass and interspecifics competition between maize varieties and legume hedgerows were evaluated. Grain yield was higher for C. fairchildiana and L. leucocephala treatments. The grain yield of hibrid maize was higher than that of maize variety at all treatments. The grain yield and 1000 grain mass maize was not affected by distance of legume hedgerows. This study concluded that the alley cropping with leguminous tree is an important alternative to the sustainable management of agroecosystems in humid tropics. Furthermore, in this region, the productivity of maize grain is favored in alley cropping with leguminous trees, like sombreiro, inga and leucena by genotypes efficient in the use of nitrogen, whose timing between its release and absorption when applied by means of pulses, must be enhanced.

AB  - We studied the influence of the operational variables (viz. ethylene-glycol concentrations of 50-70%, temperatures of 155-185 °C, times of 30-90 min and numbers of PFI beating revolutions of 500-1500) on pulp yield and various paper properties (breaking length, stretch, burst index, tear index and brightness) obtained in the ethylene-glycol pulping of vine shoots, cotton stalks, leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and tagasaste (Chamaecytisus proliferus). The fuzzy neural network models used reproduced the experimental results with errors less than 15% and smaller than those provided by second-order polynomial models in all cases. An ethylene-glycol concentration of 65% at 180 °C for 75 min and 1500 PFI beating revolutions were found to provide substantial savings in energy, chemicals and facility investments as a result of operating under milder conditions than the strongest ones studied in this work. Tagasaste was found to be the most suitable raw material among those tested as it provided the paper sheets with the highest breaking length (4644 m), stretch (2.87%), burst index (2.46 kN/g), tear index (0.33 m Nm2/g) and brightness (40.92%); its pulp yield was also high (62.88%), which reflects efficient use of this raw material. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cross-inoculation experiments were conducted in the greenhouse to test the rhizobia isolated from nodules of seven tree legumes for their effectiveness in Vigna mungo plants. The tree legumes included Albizia lebbeck, Dalbergia sissoo, Leucaena leucocephala, Pithecellobium dulce, Prosopis cineraria, Prosopis glandulosa and Prosopis juliflora, all growing under arid environment. Rhizobia from these legumes formed nodules on the roots of Vigna mungo except isolates from Albizia lebbeck. Dry weight and nitrogen contents of Vigna mungo plants increased significantly (P<0.05) in response to cross inoculation as compared to uninoculated control. Rhizobia from Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis glandulosa showed significant increase in dry weight (P<0.05) and nitrogen contents (P<0.05) than other inoculated treatments. The natural rhizobia of wild tree legumes growing under arid environment show higher tolerance to prevailing adverse conditions like salt stress, elevated temperatures and drought. These rhizobia may be used to inoculate wild as well as crop legumes cultivated in reclaimed desert lands. These rhizobia may have specific traits that can be transferred to other rhizobia through genetic engineering tools. The cross infection of agriculturally important legumes with isolates from wild legumes may prove a useful means of increasing nitrogen contents within these plants. © IRSEN, CEERS, IAU.

TI  - Production, economic and environmental benefits of leucaena pastures
PY  - 2007
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-36649004303&partnerID=40&md5=d87d7ebcb76af6e5b46607757afe025f
AB  - The rate of adoption of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala)-grass pastures is rising rapidly in northern Australia as graziers realise the extent of the triple-bottom-line benefits. Leucaena pastures are suited to >13 M ha of Queensland, with a current estimated 150 000 ha producing 37 500 kg of liveweight gain valued at >$69 M each year. Despite high costs of establishment, this area is expected to expand to 300 000-500 000 ha by 2017. The main factor driving high levels of adoption is the ability of leucaena pastures to meet graziers' needs for a highly productive and profitable system that meets market requirements for grass-fed beef of superior quality. Production benefits include: increased animal production/ha (up to 4-fold) resulting from a combination of greater animal liveweight gains and increased carrying capacity; longevity (30-40 yr); and potential to intensify production within the constraints of recent changes to the Queensland Vegetation Management Act and escalating land prices. Other benefits are: increased marketing flexibility; superior capital appreciation of leucaena pastures; and positive animal welfare outcomes. Social factors are also important, with many farmers converting marginal dryland cropping cultivation to leucaena pasture owing to concerns about the impact of drought, global warming, and decreased profitability and sustainability of dryland farming. Importantly, technical information regarding the establishment and management of leucaena pastures is now available to graziers, giving them the confidence to adopt the technology. Environmental benefits include: dryland salinity mitigation; soil erosion control and improved water quality; improved soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation; and greenhouse gas mitigation. Given an average season, existing leucaena pastures fix approximately 7500 t N and reduce cattle methane emissions by approximately 91 000 t carbon dioxide equivalent carbon (CO 2-e) annually. These pastures also have the potential to sequester >4 M t of CO2-e. However, leucaena is an environmental weed in northern Australia, largely as a result of its historical introduction and use as an ornamental and for slope stabilisation. While most current weed infestations are not due to grazier plantings, a voluntary Code of Practice, where graziers take responsibility for any spread from their properties, has been developed to limit seed production and dispersal. Soil acidification will not be a problem on the alkaline clay soils (high pH buffering capacity) in Queensland where most leucaena pastures are planted. There is need for greater factual appreciation of the environmental aspects of large-scale leucaena plantings, and for a thorough cost:benefit analysis to be conducted.

AB  - Various combinations of a low-tannin herbaceous legume (Vigna unguiculata) and foliage of tanniniferous shrub legumes (Calliandra calothyrsus, Flemingia macrophylla and Leucaena leucocephala) or a low-tannin shrub legume (Cratylia argentea), all mixed together with a low-quality tropical grass (Brachiaria humidicola), were tested in vitro for differences in the effects on ruminal fermentation. Two experiments with the gas transducer technique were carried out, where each forage mixture was tested either with or without polyethylene glycol in order to be able to identify tannin-related effects (n = 3). In Experiment 1, a stepwise replacement of V. unguiculata by C. calothyrsus (5:0, 4:1, 3:2, 2:3, 1:4, 0:5) at a legume proportion of 1/3 or 2/3 in the mixture was evaluated. Together with two grass-alone and four pure legume treatments this added up to 30 treatments. In Experiment 2, V. unguiculata was gradually replaced by each of the four shrub legumes (3:0, 2:1, 1:2, 0:3) in grass-legume ratios of 2:1, adding up, together with two grass-alone treatments, to 28 treatments. When added alone, V. unguiculata resulted in high fermentative activity as measured by gas production and kinetics as well as low proportion of undegraded crude protein. When V. unguiculata was replaced by the low-tannin C. argentea in Experiment 2, there was no noticeable difference (P>0.05) in fermentative activity. In both experiments, the effect of the substitution of V. unguiculata by tanniniferous shrub legumes resulted in a declining gas production and an increasing proportion of undegraded crude protein (P<0.001). However, the extent of these changes depended on the level of replacement and the shrub legume species (P<0.001). The results of Experiment 2 illustrate that this was the consequence not only of different tannin contents (less adverse effects with L. leucocephala than with C. calothyrsus) but also differences in the chemical properties of the tannins present in these shrub legume species (much less adverse effects with L. leucocephala than with F. macrophylla despite similar tannin contents). Furthermore these results indicate that, once the extent of the effects of a tanniniferous legume is known, one may calculate the maximal level of replacement of a low-tannin legume in a grass diet possible without negative effects on ruminal fermentation. This allows to improve dry season grass-based diets with as few as possible of the expensive and less well growing low-tannin legume. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Superhydrophobic surfaces have considerable technological potential for various applications due to their extreme water repellent properties. The superhydrophobic surfaces may be generated by the use of hydrophobic coating, roughness and air pockets between solid and liquid. The geometric effects and dynamic effects, such as surface waves, can destroy the composite solid-air-liquid interface. The relationship between the water droplet size and geometric parameters governs the creation of composite interface and affects transition from solid-liquid interface to composite interface. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of droplets of various sizes. We have studied the effect of droplet size on contact angle by evaporation using droplets with radii ranging from about 300 to 700 μm. Experimental and theoretical studies of the wetting properties of silicon surfaces patterned with pillars of two different diameters and heights with varying pitch values are presented. We propose a criterion where the transition from Cassie and Baxter regime to Wenzel regime occurs when the droop of the droplet sinking between two asperities is larger than the depth of the cavity. The trends are explained based on the experimental data and the proposed transition criteria. An environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) is used to form smaller droplets of about 20 μm radius and measure the contact angle on the patterned surfaces. The investigation has shown that ESEM provides a new approach to wetting studies on the microscale. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Measuring plant height (y) and canopy diameter (x) in trees may not be an easy task, but stem, diameter (z) can be more easily evaluated. This work's objective was two-fold: evaluate the growth of species adapted to the Brazilian Semi-Arid Region in the first two years of age, and obtain linear equations to estimate y and x from, z, in those species. A random, block design with four replications was employed. The values for x, z, and y were measured biannually from October/2003 to March/2005. Prosopis juliflora and Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia showed the highest stem diameter and plant height values, respectively, and both showed the highest canopy diameter. In the equations to estimate plant height from the stem diameter the value of the coefficient of determination.

In the equations that allowed to estimate the crown diameter from, the stem diameter the R2 value ranged from 0.70 (Leucaena leucocephala) to 0.92 (Azadirachta indica).

AB  - Green manure plants were evaluated to determine their suitability as rotation crops with common bean to suppress root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.) nematodes. They were also evaluated as soil amendments in nematode control. The plants were Calliandra calothyrsus, Canavalia ensiformis, Chenopodium quinoa, Crotalaria juncea, Desmodium uncinatum, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Mucuna pruriens, Tephrosia purpurea, Tithonia diversifolia, Vicia villosa, Sesbania sesban and Tagetes minuta. In the glasshouse, pots were filled with steam-sterilized soil and sown with green manure plants. The rotation experiment entailed growing green manure plants for three months before uprooting them and planting beans in the same pots. The potting medium was infested with 6000 eggs/juveniles of Meloidogyne javanica. The field experiments were carried out in microplots infested with a mixture of M. javanica and M. incognita. Damage to bean roots due to root-knot nematodes was based on galling indices while nematode reproductive potential was based on egg mass index. Tithonia diversifolia, D. uncinatum, T. minuta, L. leucocephala and C. juncea were among the most effective in root-knot nematode suppression when used in rotation with beans. Their galling indices ranged between 1.0 and 1.5 under field conditions and were thus considered resistant. Vicia vilosa, T. purpurea and S. sesban were susceptible with galling indices ranging between 6.2 and 7.7. The resistant plants reduced the reproductive potential of Meloidogyne spp. by up to 80% while the susceptible plants caused an increase of up to 600%. Therefore, T. diversfolia, D. uncinartum, T. minuta, L. leucocephala and C. juncea can be recommended for use in fields infested with root-knot nematodes. © 2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - Morphological characters of adults and immature stages of Pyloetis mimosae (Stainton 1859) are redescribed mainly on the basis of material collected from seed pods of Leucaena leucocephala (Lem.) in the Ryukyus, Japan. Although the systematic position of this species in the family Tineidae has been problematic, we conclude that it should be placed in the subfamily Erechthiinae based on morphological characters. Pyloetis mimosae is newly recorded from Japan. © 2007 The Entomological Society of Japan.

AB  - Seeds of Adansonia digitata, Voandzeia subterranean (L.) Thouars, Bilighia sapida, Entada africana, Leucana leucocephala and Mucuna preta were evaluated for their nutritional quality and possible inclusion in ruminant diet. The seeds were analysed for their proximate composition, fibre fractions, mineral composition, energy value and the anti-nutritional factors. The results revealed that the seeds contained between 10.5 and 41.4% crude protein, 7.5 and 22.5% ether extract, 15.5 and 19.5% crude fibre, 17.0 and 39.0% acid detergent fibre, 41.0 and 84.0% neutral detergent fibre and 4.38 and 5.46 kcal/100 g ME. It was also observed that the sodium content was between 0.10 and 0.30 mg/100 g, 1.9 and 15.5 mg/100 g calcium, 8.95 and 46.10 mg/100 g magnesium while the potassium was between 8.95 and 45.15 mg/100 g and the iron content falls between 0.17 and 0.95 mg/100 g. Some anti-nutritional factors (tannin and saponin) were detected and quantified. In conclusion, all the seed samples are potential good sources of dietary energy, protein and mineral content in livestock diet. © 2008 Academic Journals Inc.

AB  - At "La Esperanza" farm of the University of Zulia, located in Zulia state, Venezuela, 24 non-pregnant predominantly Holstein crossbred cows in the first 45 to 60 days of their third or fourth lactation were used to evaluate the effect of substituting 50 to 75% of concentrate feed (C) with 17% crude protein by grazing of a leucaena bank during 2 h/day (LB) on milk production and properties and liveweight (LW) gain. There were used 12 cows in the dry (DS) and wet (WS) season, respectively. The treatments during DS were: T1: 1 kg of C/cow/day + LB; T2: 2 kg of C/cow/day + LB, and T 3: 4 kg of C/cow/day. An additional treatment T4, 2 kg of C/cow/day + LB during 2 h on alternate days, was evaluated during WS. A switch-back design was used in both seasons, with four (DS) and three (WS) cows per treatment and three 4-week periods. Basal diets were Brachiaria humidicola hay (DS) and grazing on Panicum maximum (WS) plus water and minerals ad libitum. Milk productions (kg/cow/d) for T2 (10.5 and 10.8) and T3 (10.8 and 11.1) were higher (P≤0.05) than those for T1 (9.9 and 9.7) in DS and WS, respectively. During WS, T4 (10.2 kg/cow/d) was higher than T1, but similar to T2 and T3. Treatments were similar (P>0.05) for LW gain (360 and 423 g/cow/d), milk fat (3.5 and 3.6%), and protein content (3.3 and 3.4%), acidity (16.5 and 16.6 mL NaOH 0.1N/100 mL) nor density (1.030 and 1.029 g/mL) during DS and WS, respectively.

AB  - Nutrients released from tree prunings sustain alley cropping. Potassium (K) uptake and utilization efficiency were monitored over 16 months in Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Albizia lebbeck. Tree interspecific variation arose in biomass yields and K nutrition. Tissue potassium concentration narrowed within 0.68-1.15% and varied little among tree parts and species over time. Potassium accumulation increased steadily with tree age and significant differences among trees occurred at all ages. Gliricidia sepium had a higher yield than the others over the first 8 months, after which the uptake pattern declined drastically to become the lowest at harvest. Differential K partitioning within trees occurred as K in leaves, stems, and roots amounted to 18, 35, and 47% in Albizia; 28, 25, and 47% in Gliricidia; and 27, 42, and 31% in Leucaena, respectively. Higher K allocation into Leucaena stems and its low partitioning into Albizia leaves were drawbacks for alley cropping. Potassium utilization efficiency decreased inversely to biomass yield and K uptake over time. It differed significantly among trees with Albizia being the most efficient. Low K returns from tree prunings in alley cropping could be due to its uptake potential and partitioning impairment in each species. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We examined the effect of plant diversity on plant production and soil macrofauna density and diversity. Four plants species (Arachis pintoi, an herbaceous legume; Brachiaria brizantha, a perennial grass; Leucaena leucocephala, a legume shrub; Solanum rugosum, a non-legume shrub) were used in a field experiment and communities of all combinations of one, two, three or four species were established. Plant diversity neither significantly affected density and diversity of soil macrofauna nor total plant biomass, however, the biomass of specific plants was negatively affected by plant diversity. Earthworm and ant densities were significantly higher in the presence of A. pintoi although this plant influenced neither the density of the other group nor fauna diversity. Earthworm and diplopod densities increased significantly with shoot biomass of A. pintoi. Fauna diversity increased significantly with shoot biomass (specific and total). Root biomass did not affect fauna density and diversity. Our results suggest that fauna density is affected by litter quality and that it is more affected by resource quantity than quality. Our results also confirm the importance of nitrogen fixers to ecosystem function. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Variation in the nutritive value of three common pasture grasses: Brachiaria ruziziensis, Pennisetum purpureum, Trypsacum laxum and leaves of two leguminous trees: Leucaena leucocephala and Calliandra calothyrsus, were determined throughout a calendar year. Sampling at each foliage was completed monthly between November 2001 and October 2002 followed by analysis for their chemical components. The crude protein (CP) level in the tree leaves was higher than that in the grasses throughout the year while the reverse was true for NDFom and ADFom. There was an increase in the CP level during the rainy season for all forages, and this increase was higher (P<0.01) in B. ruziziensis, P. purpureum, L. leucocephala and C. calothyrsus (P<0.05), respectively, relative to the dry season samples. Lipid levels were higher (P<0.05) in B. ruziziensis and C. calothyrsus during the rainy season. Sulfuric acid lignin (sa) was higher (P<0.01) in B. ruziziensis and L. leucocephala during the dry season. Brachiaria had the highest level of P irrespective of season. Seasonal variations in the levels of the nutrients in these foliages suggest that, throughout the year, different amounts of leguminous tree leaves would be needed to supplement diets of ruminants whose main feed comes from grazing natural pastures, as is the case in the Central African region. This will help to ameliorate the overall productive and reproductive performance of ruminants in the region. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial ecology of sloths was studied in an agricultural landscape in Limón Province, Costa Rica. Two sloth species, the three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) and the two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni), actively used and traveled through a cacao agroforest and its contiguous living fence rows and riparian forests. This agroecosystem was embedded in an agricultural landscape dominated by banana and pineapple plantations and pastures with dispersed trees. The two-toed sloth (C. hoffmanni) was found in 101 tree species and used 34 for food; the three-toed sloth (B. variegatus) was found in 71 tree species and used 15 for food. Choice of preferred species differed between the two sloth species. Trees commonly used by sloths for food and/or refuge in the cacao agroforest included Erythrina poeppigiana, Cecropia obtusifolia, Leucaena leucocephala; in the living fence rows, Cordia alliodora, Erythrina poeppigiana, Ocotea sinuata and Trophis racemosa; in the riparian forests, Coussapoa villosa, Cecropia obtusifolia, Hura crepitans, Pterocarpus officinalis and Spondias mombin; and in the pastures with dispersed trees, Cordia alliodora, Coussapoa villosa, Erythrina poeppigiana, Ocotea sinuata and Hura crepitans. This study demonstrates the importance of the cacao agroforest as well as arboreal elements in other land uses in providing resources for sloth conservation in a larger agricultural landscape. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The interaction of Heteropsylla cubana with Chilocorus cacti and Chrysoperla sp was modeled in a silvopastoral system of Leucaena leucocephala. The system of differential equations obtained was a modification of the classical model of Lotka-Volterra, which represents the interaction of one prey with two predators. The numerical solution was obtained through the method of Rungge-Kutta of order four, programmed in MathCad. It describes the decline in the density levels of the prey when reaching one of the balance points. The points obtained when calculating the isoclines were: (0, 0, 0) the absence of populations, (2.6, 0, 0) the logistic growth of the prey in absence of predators, (0.025, 0, 79.24) the need for increasing the Chrysoperla sp. when Ch. cacti is not present, (0.003, 7.26, 0) the slight rise in the density of Ch. cacti diminishing the population of H. cubana, even in absence of Chrysoperla sp., and the local stable extinction of the prey if the predators Ch. cacti and Chrysoperla sp. are kept in the ecosystem (0.002, 6.48, 8.62), with average densities of 6.48 and 8.62, respectively.

AB  - Trees and shrubs have been recognized as a strategic resource to improve cattle systems. The objective of the present study was to identify woody species with fodder potential for the cattle systems in the northern mountains region of Chiapas, Mexico, incor-porating the farmers' perceptions, chemical-nutritional analysis, and in vitro and in situ digestibility assays of the foliage. Through participatory workshops, the farmers recognized 60 useful woody species within the grazing areas. Of these, 18 are consumed by the cattle and they have multiple uses. Based on the perception and qualification of the farmers, the most promising fodder trees with the potential to be incorporated in a silvopastoral system were identified: Pithecellobium dulce, Guazuma ulmifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena esculenta, Gliricidia sepium, Saurauia scabrida, Chromolaena sp, Erythrina chiapasana, Acacia pennatula, Acacia angustissima, Eysenhardtia adenostylis, Calliandra houstoniana and Mimosa albida. Samples of tree foliage from two sea-sons of the year and from different grazing areas were collected, chemical composition and in vitro digestibility parameters of the foliage of these trees differed significantly between the wet and dry season. By means of a digestibility in situ assay with bovines, foliage of: Acacia angusstisima, Acacia pennatula, Eysenhardtia adenostylis, Chromolaena sp, and Saurauia scabrida was evaluated and it was shown that among them there is a high variation in the potential of degradation, rate of degradation and effective degradability of the dry matter. Four species are promising for the tropical part of the region (Pithecellobium dulce, Guazuma ulmifolia, Leucaena leucocephala and L. esculenta), two for the temperate zone (Saurauia scabrida and Chromolaena sp) and three that can be used in a large altitudinal range (Erythrina chiapasana, Acacia angustissima and Eysenhardtia adenostylis).

AB  - Twenty-nine species (24 genera, 6 families) of butterflies typical and common in northeast China were selected to make qualitative and quantitative studies on the pattern, hydrophobicity and hydrophobicity mechanism by means of scanning electron microscopy and contact angle measuring system. The scale surface is composed of submicro-class vertical gibbosities and horizontal links. The distance of scale is 48-91 μm, length 65-150 μm, and width 35-70 μm. The distance of submicro-class vertical gibbosities on scale is 1.06-2.74 μm, height 200-900 nm, and width 200-840 nm. The better hydrophobicity on the surface of butterfly wing (static contact angle 136.3°-156.6°) is contributed to the co-effects of micro-class scale and submicro-class vertical gibbosities on the wing surface. The Cassie equation was revised, and new mathematical models and equations were established. © 2007 Science in China Press.

AB  - Multipurpose tree species (MPTs) were studied in an agroforestry arboretum under subtropical humid climate in Northeast India. Out of 12 MPTs planted under agroforestry systems, Acacia auriculiformis in spacing of 2 m × 2 m (2500 stems•hm-2) could have the potentiality to meet the timber/fuelwood requirement due to its high wood production of 635 m 3•hm-2 with mean annual increment (MAI) of 2.54×10-2•m3•tree1•a -1 in a short rotation period of 10 years. Thus, A. auriculiformis is a short rotation forest tree species suitable to grow in subtropical humid climate. On the other hand, at 16 years of age, Eucalyptus hybrid and Michelia champaca in spacing of 3 m × 3 m (1111 stems•hm-2) produced appreciably high timber volume of 315 m3•hm -2 and 165 m3•hm-2 with MAI of 1.77×10-2 m3•tree-1•a -1 and 0.92×10-2 m3•tree -1•a-1, respectively. At 16 years of age, Gmelina arborea produced a timber volume of 147 m3•hm-2 with MAI of 1.47×10-2 m3•tree -1•a-1 followed by Samania saman (140 m 3•hm-2), Albizzia procera (113 m3• hm-2) and Tectona grandis (79 m3•hm-2) with MAI of 1.40, 1.13 and 0.78 × 10-2 m3• tree-1•a-1, respectively in 4 m × 4 m spacing (625 stems•hm-2). Gliricidia maculata and Leucaena leucocephala could be used as live fences around the farm boundary to supply their N-rich leaves for mulch as well as manure to crops. In agroforestry arboretum, direct seeded upland rice (Oryza sativa-variety, AR-11), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea-variety, JL-24) and sesamum (Sesamum indicum-variety, B-67) were grown during the initial period upto 8 years of tree establishment. Under other MPTs, there was a reduction in crop productivity as compared to open space. After 8 years of tree establishment, horti-silvi and silvi-pastoral systems were developed and pineapple (Ananas comosus-variety Queen), turmeric (Curcuma longa-variety RCT-1) and cowpea (Vigna sinensis-variety Pusa Barsati) as forage crop were raised. The productivity of pineapple, turmeric and cowpea was comparatively high under Azadirachta indica. The productivity of horticultural and forage crops in association with trees such as G. arborea, A. procera, S. saman, T. grandis and M. champaca of high timber value could be harnessed as viable agroforestry systems. Changes in soil properties were also monitored. Amelioration of soil acidity, increase in soil organic carbon, and enhanced humification of soil humus, high nutrient availability, low soil erodibility and high surface soil (0-15 cm) moisture availability were noted in soils under MPTs. © 2007 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The study of the effect of Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala supplementary feeding multipurpose leguminous tree (MPLT) on goat production in Cameroon was conducted at Dschang University research farm on 24 West African dwarf goats of 2-3 years of age, each in the dry season (November 2001 to April 2002) and rainy season (March to September 2003). At the beginning, two bucks were introduced to the herd for 2 months and breeding allowed. The males were removed thereafter and the herd divided in two groups. One group was subjected to supplementary feeding with C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala leaves harvested in the morning, mixed in equal quantities by weight and distributed at the rate of 800 g per goat and per day. The other group not supplemented, thus served as control. Animals were weighed at the beginning of the supplementation, before kidding, after kidding and every 2 weeks until weaning. Supplementation reduced the incidence of abortion and increased the overall yield of kid per animal. During the 3 months postpartum period, the body weight decreased as compared to that recorded at parturition but the supplemented goats continued to have 11-15% more body weight than their respective control during the dry season whereas during the rainy season the difference between supplemented and non-supplemented goats were not so elaborated. This indicates the effect of the scope and importance of the supplementation for those animals particularly during the dry season. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition to grazing on natural pasture, the group receiving feed supplement was given a mixture comprising the leaves of Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala. Results indicate that during the dry and rainy seasons, the leaves had a higher content of protein compared to the grasses while the grasses were richer in cellulose. As a result of supplementary feeding, there was a marked reduction in abortion incidences. The average birth weight of the kids in the supplemented group (1.35 ± 0.08 kg) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in the control group (1.12 ± 0.10 kg) during the dry season whereas the difference was not significant during the rainy season. At weaning age, the average kid weight in the supplemented group was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that in the control group during both the dry (5.95 ± 0.45 kg versus 3.56 ± 0.45 kg) and rainy (6.22 ± 0.33 kg versus 4.64 ± 0.19 kg) seasons. Kids from the goats receiving supplements gained 67.1% more weight during the dry season whereas only 34.1% more weight was gained during the rainy season in comparison to the control group. Average weekly milk production in the goats receiving supplements was almost double that produced by the control group in dry season (361 ± 11 g versus 183 ± 43 g) and about 32% more milk was produced during the rainy season. There was a positive correlation between weight gain and milk production which was highest in the group receiving supplements during the dry season (r2 = 0.96). This study has revealed that the reproductive performance, milk production and kid growth will be greatly improved in the WADG when the feed from natural pasture is supplemented with the leaves of C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Two experiments were conducted to assess effects of condensed tannins (CT) from tropical forage crops on Haemonchus contortus burdens, feed intakes and body weights of experimentally infected Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) and Pelibuey lambs. Forty weaned gerbils were assigned to 10 treatments with four replicates. Gerbils of treatments 2-10 were orally fed 1000 exsheathed larvae and two levels (7.5 and 15 mg/kg body weight, BW) of purified CT from Arachis pintoi, Leucaena leucocephala, Manihot esculenta or Albendazol. Nine days after oral infection, gerbils were killed and the number of larvae in the stomach was determined. There were effects on stomach larvae counts (P<0.05) with the highest average count (135 larvae) occurring in the untreated control (P<0.05) and the L4 larvae (i.e., developing in intestinal submucosa phase) was lowest (18, 17 and 16 larvae) for gerbils receiving extracts from L. leucocephala, A. pintoi and M. esculenta, respectively. The uninfected control, and the Albendazol-treated groups, had practically no larvae. In the second experiment, fifty-two 45-day old Pelibuey lambs were randomly assigned to nine treatments: an uninfected control, or fed either Medicago sativa and/or three tannin containing forages (i.e., A. pintoi, Gliricidia sepium, M. esculenta), and an Albendazol-treated group. Treatments 2-9 were artificially infected with 5000 exsheathed L3 larvae (i.e., infective phase). Lambs were killed 36 days after infection and the number of parasites in the abomasum was quantified. In lambs on the test diets, the number of larvae were decreased (P<0.05) by up to 70% compared to the untreated control (3801 larvae). Lambs consumed from 0.5 to 4.9 g/kg BW/day of CT. In neither of the experiment was feed intake or BW adversely affected by administration of CT. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Field studies were conducted at Ile-Ife between 2000 and 2002 to compare the nodulation, chlorophyll content and nitrogen accumulation of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit cv. 28 and Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp cv. ILG50 at the early stages of growth (2-16 Months after Planting) (MAP) to evaluate the two species under no external input system routinely practiced by farmers. A Randomized Complete Block Design in three replications with species as the single factor was used. The number of nodules produced by G. sepium (96.0/plant) was higher than in L. leucocephala (44.0/plant). At 12 and 16 MAP, leaf total chlorophyll content of G. sepium was 6.12 μM g-1 and significantly (p<0.05) higher than 4.12 μM g-1 produced by L. leucocephala. However, chlorophyll stability index of L. leucocephala was greater significantly (p<0.05) than that of G. sepium (94.5 vs 69.7%). At final sampling (16 MAP), G. sepium partitioned 48.3 and 51.7% of its total nitrogen content to below ground and above ground parts, respectively. In contrast, L. leucocephala partitioned 35.3 and 64.7% of its total nitrogen content into below ground and above ground parts respectively. Significantly (p<0.05) higher nitrogen accumulation occurred in G. sepium (54.20 kg/plant) than in L. leucocephala (42.80 kg/plant) at 16 MAP. It is concluded from the study that productivity of G. sepium as hedge species is higher than L. leucocephala in terms of nodulation, chlorophyll content and nitrogen yield under no-external input field conditions. © 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - Though improved fallows have been widely promoted as low-input technologies suitable for soil fertility replenishment in smallholder agriculture in southern Africa, their interaction with soil invertebrates has not been studied. In the present study we compared the population of soil macrofauna in maize grown in gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), Leucaena diversifolia, sesbania (Sesbania sesban) and acacia (Acacia anguistissima) and continuously cropped monoculture maize. The objectives of the study were to determine (1) the effect of the type and length of fallows on soil macrofauna communities and functional groups, and (2) the long-term effect of legume fallows on maize yield. The number of invertebrate orders per sampling unit was significantly influenced by the type of fallow but not by the length of fallow period. Maize grown in legume fallows had more numbers of invertebrate orders than monoculture maize. Among the soil invertebrate macrofauna, centipede and millipede populations were significantly influenced by fallow type. The density of earthworms varied with both the type and length of fallow practice. Earthworm populations under maize grown in gliricidia fallows were significantly higher than those under fully fertilized monoculture maize. The population densities of other invertebrate orders and functional groups did not significantly differ between maize grown continuously in monoculture and in legume fallows. The highest maize grain yield (3.0-6.0 t ha-1) was recorded in fully fertilized monoculture. Maize grown in gliricidia and leucaena fallows consistently gave 2.0-4.0 t ha-1 throughout the study period, while maize grown without fertilizer yielded less than 2 t ha-1. These legumes produced 0.4-2.9 t ha-1 of re-sprout biomass annually, which released nutrients contributing to higher maize yields over a long period of time. It is concluded that these legume fallows can improve maize yields in addition to their positive impact on the diversity and functions of soil invertebrates. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bioadhesion and surface wettability are influenced by microscale topography. In the present study, engineered pillars, ridges and biomimetic topography inspired by the skin of fast moving sharks (Sharklet AF™) were replicated in polydimethylsiloxane elastomer. Sessile drop contact angle changes on the surfaces correlated well (R2 = 0.89) with Wenzel and Cassie and Baxter's relationships for wettability. Two separate biological responses, i.e. settlement of Ulva linza zoospores and alignment of porcine cardiovascular endothelial cells, were inversely proportional to the width (between 5 and 20 μm) of the engineered channels. Zoospore settlement was reduced by ∼85% on the finer (ca 2 μm) and more complex Sharklet AF™ topographies. The response of both cell types suggests their responses are governed by the same underlying thermodynamic principles as wettability. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In situ DM and CP degradabilities of leaflets of three tropical legumes: leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.), and glycine (Neonotonia wightii) and of leaves of two other tropical forages: ramie (Boehmeria nivea (L.) Gaudich) and cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) were determined in this trial. Three grams of pigeon pea, glycine, and ramie and 5 g of leucaena and cassava were incubated in the rumen of four steers for 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 hours. Effective degradabilities of DM and CP assuming a passage rate of 5%/hour were greater than 60%. Degradation rates, except for pigeon pea, were also high in this study. Forages had high total digestibility of protein (greater than 88%), except for pigeon pea leaflets that was 69%. Pigeon pea was the forage with the lowest potential for ruminal protein degradation. © 2006 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia.

AB  - Industrial baker's yeast effluent (BYE) was experimented on as a culture medium for growth and biomass production of six fast-growing rhizobia strains. Diluting the effluent with distilled water was necessary to maximize bacterial biomass production. The addition of phosphate buffer, ammonium chloride or trace-elements did not improve the final biomass yield of tested micro-organisms. Rhizobial growth and biomass on the effluent were comparable to traditional yeast extract mannitol medium (YEM). The Rhizobium spp. biomass, produced using either YEM or BYE, was evaluated as inoculum for Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in a pot experiment. No significant differences were reported in respect of legume nodule and growth parameters. Simultaneous inoculation with rhizobia and a group of associative diazotrophs supported better nodulation and nitrogenase activity. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A study was conducted to assess the effect of condensed tannins on the activity of fibrolytic enzymes from the anaerobic rumen fungus, Neocallimastix hurleyensis and a recombinant ferulic acid esterase (FAE) from the aerobic fungus Aspergillus niger. Condensed tannins were extracted from the tropical legumes Desmodium ovalifolium, Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena pallida, Calliandra calothyrsus and Clitoria fairchildiana and incubated in fungal enzyme mixtures or with the recombinant FAE. In most cases, the greatest reductions in enzyme activities were observed with tannins purified from D. ovalifolium and F. macrophylla and the least with tannins from L. leucocephala. Thus, whereas 40 μg ml-1 of condensed tannins from C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala were needed to halve the activity of N. hurleyensis carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase), just 5.5 μg ml-1 of the same tannins were required to inhibit 50% of xylanase activity. The β-d-glucosidase and β-d-xylosidase enzymes were less sensitive to tannin inhibition and concentrations greater than 100 μg ml-1 were required to reduce their activity by 50%. In other assays, the inhibitory effect of condensed tannins when added to incubation mixtures containing particulate substrates (the primary cell walls of F. arundinacea) or when bound to these substrate was compared. Substrate-associated tannins were more effective in preventing fibrolytic activities than tannins added directly to incubations solutions. It was concluded that condensed tannins from tropical legumes can inhibit fibrolytic enzyme activities, although the extent of the effect was dependent on the tannin, the nature of its association with the substrate and the enzyme involved. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To evaluate the effects of Leucaena supplementation on in situ ruminal dry matter (DM) degradability of Aleman-grass (AG), DM potential degradability (a+b), soluble fraction (a), maximum degradability (DM), degradation rate (c), ruminal pH and ammonia nitrogen, three ruminal cannulated Criollo Limonero steers were fed at 14-day adaptation period (F 1) and samples were taken during the following 4-day period (F2). Diets were: T1, Aleman-grass (AG) + concentrate (CO); T2, PA + 2 kg Leucaena once a day and T3, PA + 2 kg Leucaena twice a day. During F2 nylon bags were sequentially incubated on 0; 6; 12; 24; 48; 72 and 96 h, and rumen contents pH were measured on 0; 3; 6; 9; 12 y 24 h post feeding. A Latin Square design with three replications was used and ruminal degradability data was analyzed by nonlinear regression model. No differences between treatments were found for a, b and c. a+b was higher (P < 0.05) on T3 (62.91%) than T1 (58.31%) or T2 (59.17%). Ruminal pH was higher (P < 0.05) in T3 (6.74) than T1 (6.66) and T2 (6.65). Ammonia nitrogen values were 405.00; 486.14 and 508.25 mg L-1 for T1, T2 y T3, respectively. It was conclude that L. leucocephala fed twice a day increases DM degradability of Aleman-grass.

AB  - The present research was carried out in Recife-PE, aimed at to evaluating insecticide, insectistatic and repellant effects of aqueous extracts of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit. and Sterculia foetida L. on eggs, nymphs and adults of Bemisia tabaci biotype B (Genn., 1889) on Brassica oleracea var. acephala L. culture. Seeds and leaves of L. leucocephala and S. foetida were collected, dried and ground. Solutions from the aqueous extracts were prepared with 5g of dried vegetable and 50ml of pure water. Leaves of B. oleracea var. acephala were sunk in the solutions for 30 seconds before confining insects on them. Extracts of L. leucocephala seeds and S. foetida leaves caused mortality of 60% and 41%, respectively, on eggs of B. tabaci. Leaves of S. foetida caused the highest effects on nymphal instars, with mortality of 74.6%. None of the tested extract showed suppression on insect oviposition. The treatments of L. leucocephala showed a shorter longevity and higher oviposition than the treatments of S. foetida and the control. The aqueous extracts from L. leucocephala seeds and S. foetida leaves can be a good alternative to the control of B. tabaci.

AB  - Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most commonly adopted feature reduction techniques in remote sensing image analysis. However, it may overlook subtle but useful information if applied directly to the analysis of hyperspectral data, especially for discriminating between different vegetation types. In order to accurately map an invasive plant species (horse tamarind, Leucaena leucocephala) in southern Taiwan using Hyperion hyperspectral imagery, this study developed a spectrally segmented PCA based on the spectral characteristics of vegetation over different wavelength regions. The developed algorithm can not only reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery but also extracts helpful information for differentiating more effectively the target plant species from other vegetation types. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrated that the developed algorithm performs better than correlation-based segmented principal component transformation (SPCT) and conventional PCA (overall accuracy: 86%, 76%, 66%; kappa value: 0.81, 0.69, 0.57) in detecting the target plant species, as well as mapping other vegetation covers.

AB  - Patterning silicon surfaces by well-ordered nanoperforated TiO2 layers is achieved through a simple block copolymer-assisted liquid deposition technique followed by direct thermal treatment. The crater diameters are tuned between 10 and 50 nm, depending on the molecular weight of the surfactant patterning agent. The formation mechanism of such systems is discussed. The present nanopatterned heterogeneous surfaces (nanoho/ex with SiO2 bottom surfaces and TiO2walls) are selectively functionalized with two different perfluorinated organic groups. The accessibility to the substrate surface through such nanoholes and the selective distribution of both functions on the surface is evidenced by water-contact-angle measurements, which satisfactorily verify the Cassie relationship. Such systems have wide application prospects in varied fields such as nanotechnology and engineering. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA,.

AB  - The objective of this work was to assess the insecticidal potential of aqueous extracts of four arboreous species: mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), "aroeira" (Myracrodruon urundeuva), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and "sabiá" (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia), under four concentrations, 3, 5, 7 and 10%. Three parameters were evaluated in Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius 1889) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae): the presence of secondary compounds, mortality of eggs and nymphs, and alterations in insect's fertility. The presence of tannin was determined in all species, while alkaloids were observed only in P. juliflora and M. urundeuva; saponins were not detected in any species. Only the exctracts of P. juliflora and L. leucocephala caused significant mortality in eggs and nymphs, reaching, in some treatments, 75% mortality. These extracts and the one from M. caesalpiniifolia altered insect's fertility, reducing the reproduction rate, the mean generation time and the intrinsic growth rate for three generations of A tabaci. The observed effects varied according to the concentration of the extracts tested.

AB  - With recent advances in rhizobial phylogeny, questions are being asked as to how an ecological framework can be developed so that rhizobial classification and diversity could have greater practical applications in enhancing agricultural productivity in tropical ecosystems. Using the results of studies on tropical rhizobia which nodulate agroforestry tree legumes, three ecological aspects of rhizobial biodiversity were used to illustrate how its potential can be exploited. The results showed that legumes nodulate with diverse rhizobial types, thus contributing to the success of legumes in colonising a wide range of environments. There was an apparent shift in the relative dominance of rhizobia populations by different rhizobial types as soil pH changed. The Rhizobium tropici-type rhizobia were predominant under acidic conditions, Mesorhizobium spp. at intermediate pH and Sinorhizobium spp. under alkaline conditions. The R. tropici-type rhizobia were the most effective symbiotic group on all the host legumes. However, strains of Sinorhizobium spp. were as effective as the R. tropici types in N2-fixation on Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala; while Mesorhizobium strains were equally as effective as the R. tropici types on Sesbania sesban. Classification of rhizobia based on phenotypic properties showed a broad correlation with groupings based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis, although a few variant strains nested with the dominant groups in most of the clusters. Some of the phenotypic characters that differentiated different rhizobial groups are highlighted and a case is made for the need to standardise this method. © 2006 Springer.

AB  - An investigation on the effect of pruning height on shoot biomass yield of Leucaena leucocephala was carried out at the Agroforestry Farm, Bangladesh Agricultural University, during February to May 2005. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications. Treatments included four pruning heights; 3-5 (basal cut), 50, 100 and 150 cm above the collar zone. Yield of shoot biomass increased greatly with the increase in pruning heights. Higher pruning heights had a significantly higher number of branches, length of branches and leaves per plant than those of the lower heights. The 150 cm pruning height was found to yield the highest biomass followed by the 100 cm height. The 50 cm and the basal cut were statistically similar with regard to leaf biomass. Therefore, it was concluded that a higher pruning height should be practiced in Leucaena for higher shoot biomass yield. © 2006 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - The main objective of this work was to develop new growth models for forest resources, applied to (leucena) [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) of Wit], based on the biological hypotheses proposed by Chapman-Richards and Silva-Bailey. The experiment of the leucena was carried out in the Experimental Station of the Agricultural and Liverstock Research Company of Pernambuco - IPA, in the municipal district of Caruaru - PE. Five hundred and forty four trees of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) of Wit were used, with 20 measures along the time. It was compared new growth models resulting from the combination and variation of the Chapman-Richards and Silva-Bailey models, as well other models used in forest resources. For the selection of the final equations, the fit of index, standard error of estimate and the graphic distribution of the residues were used. Results show that new models were as good as Chapman-Richards and Silva-Bailey and other tested. Therefore, any one of them can be applied to estimate the growth of leucena.

AB  - A feeding system for heifers with creeping and tree legumes, grasses, king grass (Cuba CT-115) and multi-nutritional blocks was studied as alternatives to improve the quality and amount of the ration in the calf and heifer stages. Forty crossbred calves (Holstein upgraded) with 145 kg of liveweight and eight months of age were used to assess their performance and development in a feeding system based on star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis), associated with a mixture of legumes of kudzu (Pueraria phaseoloide), clitoria (Clitoria ternatea), terannus (Terannus labialis), stylo (Stylosanthes guianensis), centro (Centrocema pubescens), glycine (Neonotonia wightii) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) as natural tutor. In the calf stage, they were fed 1 kg/animal/d of a concentrate containing 86 % dry matter (DM), 11.84 % crude protein (CP) and 10.8 MJ of metabolizable energy/kg of dry matter, provided only in the dry season. After this stage, 20 yearling heifers of 208 kg of liveweight and 12.5 months of age were allocated in a pastures of Pennisetum (Cuba CT-115) associated with a mixture of legumes composed by glycine (Neonotonia wightii) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephald). Also, they were supplemented with multi-nutritional blocks. In both stages, the animals rotated in six paddocks, with a stocking rate of 1.5 LAU/ha. The occupation time in the paddock was of 5 and 7 d during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. The pasture was not irrigated or fertilized. The calves and yearling heifers were weighed every 15 d and body measures were undertaken (cross height, thoracic perimeter and body length). The availability and quality of the pasture were determined monthly. The forage balance was positive in both stages and the edible dry matter was higher than 5 kg/100 kg of liveweight. The daily increase of liveweight (452, 521 and 501 g/animal/d) for calves, yearling heifers, as well as that of the total period, showed respectively a good performance. In calves, the thoracic perimeter was increased 15.7 cm, which reflected the feeding potential of the system under study. Puberty in the yearling heifers was attained at 15.6 months and the incorporation to artificial insemination was at 20 months. The results indicate a good potential of the system to fulfil the requirements of dry matter in both seasons and attain a good level of liveweight, as well as adequate reproductive performance.

AB  - In northwest of Venezuela, in a tropical dry forest, a trial was conducted in order to evaluate the effect of supplementation with commercial concentrate on fat (F), total solids (TS), not fat solids (SNF), crude protein (CP), casein (C) and lactose (L) contents in milk of dual purpose cows grazing P. maximum and L. leucocephala. The treatments evaluated were grazing in P. maximum + 1 h/d in leucaena (T1 ), T1 + 1 kg concentrate/cow (T2) and T1 + 2 kg concentrate/cow (T3). The statistical design was a completely randomized with eight replications. The obtained results showed a significant effect (P<0.05) of supplementation on TS, CP and C contents, while, there was not effect (P>0.05) on SNF, F and L. The highest contents of TS (12.42%), CP (2.98%) and C (2.33%) were obtained when the cows fed on 1 kg of concentrate. The mean values of F, SNF and L were 4.12, 8.16 and 4.65%, respectively. It was concluded from this study trat the use of commercial concentrate increased chemistry components of milk in dual-purpose systems.

AB  - Seed storage behaviour of 51 native and 9 introduced tree species in Vietnam was investigated using a brief protocol developed to aid biodiversity conservation in circumstances where little is known about the seeds. Of the 60 species, 34 appeared to show orthodox (Acacia auriculaeformis, Adenanthera pavonina, Afzelia xylocarpa, Bauhinia purpurea, Callistenton lanceolatus, Cananga odorata, Canarium nigrum, Cassia fistula.

AB  - The species Phaseolus vulgaris is a promiscuous legume nodulated by several species of the family Rhizobiaceae. During a study of rhizobia nodulating this legume in Portugal, we isolated several strains that nodulate P. vulgaris effectively and also Macroptilium atropurpureum and Leucaena leucocephala, but they form ineffective nodules in Medicago sativa. According to phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, the strains from this study belong to the genus Rhizobium, with Rhizobium rhizogenes and Rhizobium tropici as the closest related species, with 99.9 and 99.2% similarity, respectively, between the type strains of these species and strain P1-7T. The nodD and nifH genes carried by strain P1-7T are phylogenetically related to those of other species nodulating Phaseolus. This strain does not carry virulence genes present in the type strain of R. rhizogenes, ATCC 11325T. Analysis of the recA and atpD genes confirms this phylogenetic arrangement, showing low similarity with respect to those of R. rhizogenes ATCC 11325T (91.9 and 94.1 % similarity, respectively) and R. tropici IIB CIAT 899T (90.6% and 91.8% similarity, respectively). The intergenic spacer (ITS) of the strains from this study is phylogenetically divergent from those of R. rhizogenes ATCC 11235T and R. tropici CIAT 899T, with 85.9 and 82.8 % similarity, respectively, with respect to strain P1-7T. The tRNA profile and two-primer random amplified polymorphic DNA pattern of strain P1-7T are also different from those of R. rhizogenes ATCC 11235T and R. tropici CIAT 899T. The strains isolated in this study can be also differentiated from R. rhizogenes and R. tropici by several phenotypic characteristics. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization showed means of 28 and 25% similarity between strain P1-7T and R. rhizogenes ATCC 11235T and R. tropici CIAT 899T, respectively. All these data showed that the strains isolated in this study belong to a novel species of the genus Rhizobium, for which we propose the name Rhizobium lusitanum sp. nov.; the type strain is P1-7T (=LMG 22705T = CECT 7016T). © 2006 IUMS.

AB  - Germination, emergence and seedling vigour of Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham were investigated under acid stress conditions following the exposure of seeds to pregerminative hydration-dehydration and acid shock treatments (seed hardening). A combination of partial hydration in distilled water with an acid shock treatment (immersion in acidified water at pH 5.0) for 1 h increased germination from 12% to 42% in acid conditions. In an acid soil, partial hydration in distilled water in combination with either or without an acid shock were the best procedures for increasing seedling emergence (from 20% to 52%) and aboveground and underground biomass. Seed hardening treatments promoted germination but also appear to have improved resistance to acid stress.

AB  - By the method of sweep netting, an investigation was made on the beetle (Insecta: Coleoptera) diversity in Pinus yunnanensis, Eucalyptus, Leucaena leucocephala, Eucalyptus + L. leucocephala, Azadirachta indica, and multiple tree species mixed plantations in Yuanmou dry-hot valley. A total of 925 beetles were captured, belonging to 71 species and 18 families. Chrysomelidae had most species, while Curculionidae had most individuals. The species richness of the beetle communities was 7-23, and the Shannon-Wiener index was 1.249-2.562, suggesting a lower insect diversity as a whole. Among the test plantations, P. yunnanensis plantation had the highest diversity of beetle communities, followed by the mixed plantation, A. indica, plantation, and Eucalyptus, L. leucocephala, and Eucalyptus + L. leucocephala plantations. The restoration of multiple tree species mixed plantation was of significance in enhancing insect diversity.

AB  - Evaluations of pasture and forage species available in potential areas for ruminant production were conducted in eastern zone of Tanzania from year 2000 to 2004. Observational visits were conducted in different agroecological zones that have potential for livestock production. Herbaceous legumes were not commonly found in grazing areas in most of the agro-ecological zones visited. This observation implies the need for protein supplementation strategies to improve ruminant production in different locations. Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala had high coppicing ability among the multipurpose trees evaluated. Stylosanthes guianensis and Calopogonia muconoides had the higher perpetuation ability among herbaceous legumes evaluated. This observation suggests that smallholder farmers could establish these legumes without practicing yearly reseeding. Compatibility study between Pennisetum purpureum (Napier grass) and herbaceous legumes indicated that highest dry matter yield could be obtained by intercropping Clitoria ternatea with Pennisetum purpureum. However stable dry matter production in different weather conditions encountered among different years could be attained through intercropping of Macroptilium atropurpureum (Siratro) with Napier grass. It was concluded that protein availability in basal diets of most ruminants kept in eastern zone of Tanzania is limited. Endeavours to supplement basal diets with protein sources to improve ruminant production are a prerequisite.

AB  - The effects of inter-row spacing of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in an alley cropping system on the incidence and severity of rust (Uromyces appendiculatus (Pers.) Unger) on intercropped beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and their yield were examined over 2 years (1993 and 1994) at Chepkoilel Campus in Kenya. Each experiment consisted of three randomized blocks with treatments of three alley widths (2 m, 4 m and 8 m) and a treeless control with two intra-row spacings of Leucaena (0.5 m and 1.0 m). Hedgerows were coppiced at 1.0 m height and pruned subsequently at 2-3 months intervals. No fertilizer was applied but Leucaena loppings were incorporated as green leaf manure. Rust on beans was assessed at three growth stages in each season, using the Centro International de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) scales. Microclimate was monitored in treatments, in 1994. Bean growth and yield were also measured. Rust increased with increasing alley width and was less severe in bean rows adjacent to hedgerows. Bean yield was highest in the treeless control plots and declined with decreasing alley width. Beans in 2 m alleys had significantly lower (p < 0.05) yields than 8 m alleys and treeless control plots. Bean growth was greatly modified in 2 m alleys and close to hedgerows. Light availability and diurnal temperature increased with alley width but relative humidity and leaf wetness duration decreased. Proximity to hedgerows also had marked effect on microclimate. The changes in yield, rust incidence and severity were examined in relation to microclimate, inoculum survival and dispersal. © Springer 2006.

AB  - Our observations on the growth stimulatory nature of mimosine, (β-(3-hydroxy-4-pyridon-1-yl)-L-alanine), the toxic non-protein plant amino acid, in some model experimental systems, warranted sensitive and selective routine estimations. For the determination of both mimosine and DHP, an indirect spectrophotometric method was developed based on their individual reaction with known excess of DZSAM and by estimating the remaining DZSAM with N-(1-naphthyl)ethylene-diamine (NEDA). The resultant decrease in the secondary coupled product was measured at 540 nm. On equimolar basis, DHP had 40% of the reactivity of mimosine while interference from other relevant compounds was 15-35%. The determination of mimosine and DHP in tissue samples under different physiological conditions was effected after paper chromatographic separation of mimosine and DHP with distinctly differing Rf, from other compounds. The indirect method is superior in terms of absolute selectivity, sensitivity and ease of applicability with linear decreases in absorbance, proportional to increasing concentrations of mimosine from 0.1 to 0.75 μM or DHP from 0.2 to 1.5 μM and with recoveries of 99.2 to 100.5%. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The objective of this trial was to evaluate the morphophysiological traits and nutritive value of Brachiaria decumbens, during 2003 and 2004 rainy seasons, in a silvopastoral system, with grass alone (30 m width), alternated with grass plus trees (Acacia mangium, A. angustissima, Mimosa arthemisiana, Leucaena leucocephala x L. diversifolia, Eucalyptus grandis) strips (10 m width). The experimental design was a randomized block arranged in a split plot design (morphophysiological traits) or split-split plot (nutritive value traits), and replicated four times. The level of shading was 65% of incident radiation out of the wood in 2003, and 35% in 2004 after harvesting of some Eucalyptus trees. Under shade, tiller population leaf area and forage mass index were higher in the second year than in the first. Forage neutral detergent fiber value was higher at full sunlight than in the shade, while the crude protein content and in vitro dry matter digestibility were higher under the trees. Moderate shading increases crude protein and reduces neutral detergent fiber, therefore improving forage digestibility of grasses growing under trees.

AB  - A study was carried out to determine the influence of different types of sludges (municipal, industrial and residential) on field germination, growth and nodulation of L. leucocephala seedlings in the nursery. Before sowing of seeds, different combinations of sludges were incorporated with the nutrient deficient natural forest soils. Field germination, nodulation status and physical growth parameters of seedlings (shoot and root length, vigor index, collar diameter, leaf number, fresh and dry weight of shoot and root and total dry biomass increment) were recorded after three and six months of seed sowing. Field germination, nodulation status and growth parameters were varied significantly in the soil amended with sludges in comparison to control. The highest number of nodule was recorded from soil amended with residential sludge (1:1) and highest fresh and dry nodule weight was also found from the same combination in both three and six month old seedlings. In case of growth parameters, the highest growth was recorded from soil and residential sludge (1:1) combination compared to control. From the study, it can be recommended that soil amended with residential sludge (1:1) provide better field germination, growth and nodule formation of L. leucocephala in degraded soil. © 2007 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In order to determine the status of an invasive plant species (Leucaena leucocephala) in southern Taiwan, a high resolution remote sensing image analysis system was developed based on the texture analysis. The developed system uses gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to extract spatial features from images to help distinguish target species from other vegetation types in the study site. Texture features are collected using three statistical measures from GLCM matrices and then used to fortify a supervised classification for mapping the target and other vegetation types. Test results demonstrated here indicate that the developed texture supplemented analysis can produce accurate mapping result of the target invasive plant species in the study site. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - In order to know the performance of pasture and soil stability indicators, a study was developed between 2002 and 2003 in a system with dairy heifers on hydrated red ferralitic soil, based on Cynodon nlemfuensis as basic pasture and a tree mixture (Lysiloma bahamensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia falcatoria, Gmelina arborea, Terminalia sp, Azadirachta indica (Neem) and Eritrina mysorensis). The following indicators were measured: botanical composition, density and frequency of appearance of species, macrofauna, biological diversity of the edaphic fauna, biomass availability and aggregate distribution in humid and dry conditions. The analysis of principal components permitted determining the indicators that explained the best the variability in the system. Between the plant variables, those explaining the best the variability were the percentage of star grass, legumes and weeds, as well as the biomass availability. The highest aggregates on soil were of 3 mm and from 0.5 to 0.2 mm of diameter in the sieving in humid conditions, whereas in the sieving in dry conditions, from 1 to 0.5 mm, from 2 to 1 mm and higher than 10 mm. In the dry season, the percentage of star grass and legumes was increased in the sampling years whereas the weeds disappeared. In the rainy season, there was decrease of Cynodon nlemfuensis and legumes, as well as an increment from 21.6% to 35.1% of weeds. However, in both seasons, Cynodon nlemfuensis was kept as predominant species with more than 55%. The system availability had significant difference between seasons. The aggregates higher than 3 mm were increased between the years for the depth from 0 to 15 mm whereas for more than 30 cm, they decreased between 0.5 and 0.2 mm. This improves the soil structure. Besides, the resistance to penetration had adequate values and was kept stable, while the biological diversity of the edaphic fauna increased in the second year. It is concluded that the biomass availability tended to be stable in the system, the biological diversity was increased and the physical conditions of the soil were improved. Despite the fluctuations in the botanical composition, Cynodon nlemfuensis was preserved as predominant species. It is recommended to continue the systematic control of the indicators selected to know the effects of the management and validate their effectiveness to monitor the plant and edaphic performance.

AB  - Soil water and nutrients play an important role in increasing sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) yields in the Vertisols of semi-arid tropics during post-rainy season. The effects of tillage practices, organic materials and nitrogen fertilizer on soil properties, water conservation and yield of sorghum were evaluated during winter seasons of 1994-1995 and 1995-1996 on deep Vertisols at Bijapur in the semi-arid tropics of Karnataka State (Zone 3) of south India. Conservation and availability of water and nutrients during different stages of crop growth were increased by deeper tillage resulting in increased grain yield of winter sorghum. Medium and deep tillage increased the grain yield by 23% (1509 kg ha-1) and 57% (1919 kg ha-1) during 1994-1995 and 14% (1562 kg ha-1) and 34% (1835 kg ha-1) during 1995-1996, respectively, over shallow tillage. Water use efficiency increased from shallow (4.90 kg ha-1 mm-1) to deep tillage (7.30 kg ha-1 mm-1). Greater water use efficiency during 1994-1995 as compared to 1995-1996 was attributed to lower consumptive use of water during 1994-1995. Among organic materials, application of Leucaena loppings conserved larger amounts of water and increased winter sorghum yield and water use efficiency. Application of Leucaena loppings increased the winter sorghum grain yield by 9% (mean of 1994-1995 and 1995-1996) as compared to vermicompost. Significantly (P < 0.05) higher water use efficiency of 6.32 kg ha-1 mm-1 was observed in Leucaena loppings incorporated plots compared to 5.72 kg ha-1 mm-1 from vermicompost. Grain yield increased by 245 kg ha-1 with application of 25 kg N ha-1 in 1994-1995, and a further increase in N application to 50 kg ha-1 increased the grain yield by about 349 kg ha-1 in 1995-1996. Deep tillage with application of 25 kg N ha-1 resulted in significantly higher sorghum yield (2047 kg ha-1) than control during 1994-1995. Deep tillage with integrated nutrient management (organic and inorganic N sources) conserved higher amount of soil water and resulted in increased sorghum yields especially during drought years. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study of diet and physiological peculiarities of the digestive system of neotropical deer is not well known and the literature shows inconsistencies. To better understand the digestive system of these mammals the difference in the gastro-intestinal transit time of four species of neotropical deer (Mazama americana, Mazama gouazoubira, Mazama nana, Blastocerus dichotomus), kept in captivity, was evaluated. Four plants (Neonotonia wightii, Morus albans, Medicago sativa, Leucaena leucocephala) were utilized and two variables were measured, mean time of the beginning of the elimination (BE) and mean time of permanence (TP). The results obtained for BE indicated similarity among the deer species, with significant differences between M. gouazoubira (mean = 13.62 hr) and M. Americana (mean = 19.25 hr). For the plants, the BE was faster with N. wightii and L. leucocephala, and slower for M. sativa. The TP results for B. dichotomus showed longer time when compared to the other species, whereas M. gouazoubira had a lower permanence. Overall, N. wightii had the highest retention time in the digestive tract of all the deer species studied. Associated with this observation, N. wightii had the highest quantity of plant fiber of the plants tested. In a similar fashion M. sativa showed the lowest TP in the digestive tract of the deer and had the lowest quantity of acid detergent fiber. The data from this study showed that, within species, the shape of the excretion curve of the plants was similar when the animals consumed TV. wightii or M. sativa. Blastocerus dichotomus and M. gouazoubira had the highest and the lowest gastro-intestinal transit time, respectively. This suggests that these species characterize different abilities to digest high fiber food, and consequently, represent the two extremities in the morphophysiological adaptation within the deer species evaluated. This information is vital because it is important to know the digestive physiology to define the diet of captive animals, particularly regarding the quantity and quality of fiber. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) resistance in some leguminous plants is achieved by enhanced citrate release from roots. Enhancement requires several hours for complete activation and is postulated to involve Al-responsive genes or components. We examined the mechanism of Al-induced citrate release by studying the relationship between citrate release and expression of the mitochondrial citrate synthase (mCS) gene in three leguminous trees. Root elongation in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit was arrested within 24 h by 30 μM Al, whereas root elongation in Paraserianthes falcataria (L.) Neilson and Acacia mangium Willd. was inhibited < 50% by a 48-h treatment with 100 μM Al in calcium chloride solution. Roots of P. falcataria and A. mangium maintained enhanced release and accumulation of citrate for at least 28 days in response to Al treatment. Aluminum increased the accumulation of mCS transcripts in P. falcataria roots, but not in L. leucocephala roots, and thus up-regulation decreased following removal of Al. Lanthanum did not alter the expression level of mCS. Aluminum increased mCS activity concomitantly with enhanced mCS gene expression in P. falcataria, whereas it did not affect mCS activity in L. leucocephala. Aluminum content in root apices of P. falcataria was increased by cycloheximide, supporting the idea that de novo synthesis of proteins is a prerequisite for Al resistance. Our findings suggest that Al-inducible expression of mCS coupled with enhanced citrate release mediates Al resistance in P. falcataria. © 2006 Heron Publishing.

AB  - Field experiments for 3 years were carried out to assess the efficacy of organic manures (Sesbania aculeata, Leucaena leucocephala), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and mungbean (Vigna radiata) green manures, wheat straw and FYM (Farm Yard Manure) in enhancing the productivity of rice-wheat cropping system and for their capacity to supply Zn and Cu. Green manuring with Sesbania gave the highest rice yield, whereas lowest yields were recorded with wheat straw incorporation. The organic manures had significant residual effect on succeeding wheat and the highest yields were recorded with FYM. The percent increase over no organic manure (control) in total rice-wheat productivity was the highest with Sesbania green manuring (19.5%) and lowest with wheat straw (4%). The concentration and uptake of Zn and Cu by individual crops and system was significantly greater with organic manures. The micronutrient status of soil after 3 cycles of ricewheat cropping system declined over initial values but the decline was the least with FYM followed by green manures. Application of organic manures is desirable for sustained supply of Zn and Cu to rice-wheat cropping system soils. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was carried out during one year on three genotypes under silvopastoral conditions constituted by Holstein Friesian (Herd 1), Holstein crossbreeds, with presence of crossings F1 H-C, 3/4 H - 1/4 C and 1/4 H - 3/4 C (Herd 2) and Siboney of Cuba (Herd 3), respectively. The data were processed by the system SAS (1998), through a GML of fixed effects. The studied genotypes showed certain decrease of milk production during the dry season with significant differences between this and the rainy season, obtaining values of 11.2 vs. 15.1; 7.6 vs. 9.8 and 8.9 vs.11.3 kg/day for the genotypes Holstein Friesian, Holstein crossbreed and Siboney of Cuba respectively. Similar responses were noted in milk composition with values of solids non fat of 8.31 vs. 8.50; 8.58 vs. 8.76 and 8.50 vs. 8.70 % in dry and rainy seasons for genotypes Holstein Friesian, Holstein crossbreed and Siboney of Cuba respectively. It is concluded that season has a direct effect on milk production and composition from the studied genotypes under silvopastoral conditions with certain decrease of these parameters during the dry season.

AB  - A comparison of yield and quality of napier Taiwan A25 (Pennisetum purpureum) intercropped with four different legume species (Cajanus cajan, Crotalaria juncea, Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania luteola) was carried out at the National Corn and Sorghum Reseaech Center, Pakchong district, Nakornratchasima, Thailand, over a 12-month period. The objective was to determine the optimal combination of legume species and the proportion of grass/legume in napier fodder banks in Thailand. The design of the experiment was a split plot with legume species as the main plot and the ratio between rows of grass and legume (1:1, 1:2 and 1:4) as sub-plot. The results showed that crotalaria produced the highest total dry matter yield followed by leucaena, pigeon pea and sesbania. Grass yield was highest in the crotalaria plots and lowest in the leucaena plots. Thus, the total dry matter yield (grass + legume) was highest in the crotalaria plots and lowest in the leucaena plots. However, sesbania and crotalaria produced substantial yields only during the first two cuts with yields declining dramatically. Increasing the ratio between grass and legume resulted in a greater legume yield. The recommendation for the ratio between grass and legume was 1:2 (1 row grass:2 rows legume).

AB  - Forest tree leaves (12 different species) of semi hilly arid region of Punjab State were collected at 30-day interval throughout the year to assess the seasonal variations in tannin profile. Tannins were extracted and fractionated from fat free samples and data were analyzed statistically by 12x12 factorial design. The leaves of Anogeissus latifolia had the highest (p<0.05) concentration of total phenols (17.4%), net (15.9%) and hydrolysable (16.9%) tannins, followed by leaves of Acacia nilotica. Majority of the tree leaves selected had moderate levels (2-5%) of net tannins. Leaves of Carrisa had the highest (p<0.05) concentration of condensed tannins (CT), whereas the leaves of Anogeissus had the lowest (p<0.05) concentration of condensed tannins. The protein precipitable phenols (PPP) corresponded well with the net tannin content present in different tree leaves. Seasonal variation data revealed that in summer, net tannins and PPP decline in leaves of Bauhinia and Zizyphus whereas the net tannin content of Anogeissus and that of Carrisa increased during summer. The CT and PPP content in the leaves of Pheonix, Leucaena, Zizyphus and Ougenia increased in winter till spring season. Tree leaves generally had higher concentration of HT during summer months. It was concluded that leaves of leaves of A. nilotica, A. latifolia and L. leucocephala could serve as an excellent alternate feed stuffs for ruminants. However, leaves of Phoenix, Carrisa, Bauhinia and Dodonea should be avoided.

AB  - In this paper, an investigation was made on the Leucaena leucocephala plantations in Yuanmou dry-hot valley in June and October 2005. Under the plantations, there were a great many of seedlings, and all of them were generated from seeds, suggesting that L. leucocephala could naturally regenerate from seed. The seed quantity per tree was from 602 to 1 513, and high trees had more seeds. The seedlings were growing well, with a minimum renewal density of 960 plants per square meter and a maximum renewal density of 960 plants per square meter. The longest dispersal distance of the seedlings was 58.3 m from the edge of L. leucocephala stand, and the dispersal range was mostly in an area 10 m from the stand. The seeds could be dispersed to a far distance along the valley by wind and running water.

AB  - Optimal utilization of local feed resources for improved livestock productivity in many production systems in the tropics is limited by scanty information on nutritive potential of forages including minerals. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of season on concentration of macro and micro minerals of nine forage species: three grasses (Cynodon plectostychus, Panicum maximum and Pennisetum purpureum); three creeping legumes (CL) (Calopogonia muconoides, Macroptilium atropurpureum and Neonotonia wightii) and three multipurpose tree species (MPTs) (Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Morus alba) commonly used by smallholder dairy farmers in Lowlands of Turiani, Mvomero district, Tanzania. The comparative seasonal concentration of Ca, P, Mg, S, Cu, Fe, Zn, Mn and Se were evaluated. Results indicated that in all forages and in all seasons, Ca, Mg, S and Fe were in substantial amount to meet dairy cattle requirements. Multipurpose trees had low to marginal levels of P, Cu and Mn to meet dairy cattle requirements. In all seasons, all forages had lower concentrations of Zn and Se to meet dairy cattle requirements. Therefore, potential intakes of Zn and Se in all seasons by dairy cow, weighing 450 kg BW on average, producing 10 kg milk per day and consuming 12.15 kg DM, was low. These findings indicate that creeping legumes be considered prominent components in diets of dairy cattle because of their high concentrations of minerals. Ration formulation for dairy cattle in these Lowlands of Turiani, Mvomero district, Tanzania, should include P, Cu, Mn, Zn and Se throughout the year.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate ruminal degradability of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and crude protein of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), black oat (Avena strigosa), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan). Samples of 3 g of forages were incubated in the rumen of three steers for 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours periods. The dry matter effective degradabilities of alfalfa and oat, for a passage rate of 5%/hour, were high (over 60%). However, leucaena and pigeon pea showed lower values, 50.9 and 56.0%, respectively. From 24-hour incubation period on, the oat presented the highest neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber disappearance and showed the greatest effective degradation rates of these fractions. The oat was the forage with the highest dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and crude protein ruminal degradability. Pigeon pea, however, was the forage that showed the worst degradation rates.

AB  - Aims: Pathogenicity of Exobasidium vexans, causal agent of blister blight of tea, was studied in 30 commercially cultivated tea varieties by analysing the antigenic patterns of host and pathogen using immunological techniques. Methods and Results: Whole plant inoculation of tea varieties with E. vexans showed that T-78 and T-17/1/54 were most susceptible and most resistant respectively. Antigen preparations from tea varieties, pathogen, nonpathogen (Fusarium oxysporum) and of nonhosts (Glycine max, Leucaena leucocephala and Oryza sativa) were compared by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and dot-immunobinding assay using polyclonal antibodies raised against the pathogen, nonpathogen, susceptible and resistant tea varieties. Cross-reactive antigens (CRA) were found among susceptible varieties and E. vexans isolates but not in resistant varieties, nonhosts or nonpathogen. Indirect staining of antibodies using fluorescein isothiocyanate indicated CRA were concentrated mainly around epidermal and mesophyll cells in compatible host (T-78). This was substantiated by ultrastructural studies using gold-labelled antibodies through transmission electron microscopy which showed specific localization in the chloroplasts and host cytoplasm. Conclusion: Pathogenicity of E. vexans to different tea varieties is therefore related to the level of antigenic similarity between host and pathogen. Significance and Impact of the Study: Immunological methods proved to be valuable in screening commercially cultivated tea varieties against E. vexans. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the development and natural nodulation of Leucaena leucocephala, Clitoria fairchildiana and Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, in soils with different type of land use, in Zona da Mata of Pernambuco, Brazil. Soils of four forest areas, six agriculture areas and two degraded areas were used. Soils were classified, analyzed chemically and distributed in pots 3 kg soil per pot, two plants per pot. Plant evaluations were carried out at 76, 70 and 62 days, for L. leucocephala, C. fairchildiana and M. caesalpiniifolia, respectively. The experimental design was completely randomized, with 12 treatments and 3 repetitions. Low frequencies of native populations of rhizobia were verified for L. leucocephala, with 22% of plants nodulated, compared to C. fairchildiana and M. caesalpiniifolia, with 100% and 86%, respectively. M. caesalpiniifolia presented abundant natural nodulation and efficiency in the fixation of N2, demonstrating compatibility with native populations of rhizobia. Growth, development, nodulation as well as accumulation of nitrogen of the three species, were favored with soil under agricultural areas with covering of Calopogonium mucunoides. C. fairchildiana presented greater potential for fixation of N2 and efficiency of the nodulation with native populations of rhizobia followed by M. caesalpiniifolia and L. leucocephala.

AB  - Various raw materials used as alternatives to those conventionally employed for manufacturing pulp and paper were studied. The new materials included agricultural residues such as vine shoots and cotton stalks, and bushy plants such as Leucaena leucocephala and tagasaste (Chamaecytisus proliferus). Based on the results, the best choices were tagasaste and cotton stalks, with increased contents in holocellulose (79.73% and 72.86%, respectively) and α-cellulose (45.37% and 58.48%), and decreased contents in ethanol-benzene (2.64% and 1.42%), hot water (2.79% and 3.33%) and 1% soda extractives (16.67% and 20.34%). These properties should result in increased yields and efficient use of these two raw materials. The previous materials were pulped with 65% ethyleneglycol at 180 EC for 75 min, followed by beating at 1500 revolutions in a PFI refiner. Based on the results obtained in the characterization of the pulp and paper sheets thus obtained, tagasaste was the best choice as it provided the paper sheets with the highest breaking length (4644 m), stretch (2.87%), burst index (2.46 kN/g), tear index (0.33 mNm2/g) and brightness values (40.92%), in addition to a high pulp yield (86.88%) and efficient use of the material substrate. By contrast, vine shoots proved the worst raw material among those studied.

AB  - Signal grass pastures were oversown with four Leucaena spp. planted in hedgerows and evaluated for their agronomic productivity and ability to support steer liveweight gains. Each Leucaena sp. (L. leucocephala, L. pallida, L. collinsii, L. trichandra) was planted as seedlings into two 1 ha paddocks in rows 5 m apart, with 1 m spacing between trees. Cattle were rotationally grazed on the 2 replicates of each species, as well as on two 1 ha paddocks of a signal grass only (Brachiaria decumbens) control, over a 243-day period at a stocking rate of 3 steers/ha. Mean presentation yield and herbage allowance of the Leucaena accessions over the grazing period were highest for L. pallida (1100 kg/ha and 0.8 kg DM/kg LW, respectively), followed by L. leucocephala (700 kg/ha and 0.5 kg DM/kg LW), L. collinsii (700 kg/ha and 0.4 kg DM/kg LW) and L. trichandra (300 kg/ha and 0.2 kg DM/kg LW). Despite only moderate presentation yields and herbage allowances, steers grazing L. leucocephala and L. collinsii accessions produced the highest mean liveweight gains (LWG) of 0.65 and 0.56 kg/hd/d, respectively. While L. pallida produced the highest DM yields, it supported the lowest LWG of 0.36 kg/hd/d. The mean LWGs of steers grazing L. trichandra and the control (grass only) treatments were similar at 0.48 kg/ hd/d. The possible reasons for the differences in steer performance on the different Leucaena accessions are discussed.

AB  - Growth performance and psyllid resistance was studied among nineteen lesser-known Leucaena species/provenances at Gairo inland plateau, Morogoro, Tanzania. Assessment was done at irregular intervals for survival, root collar diameter and diameter at 30 cm above the ground, height, diameter at breast height, multiple stems production, biomass and psyllid resistance. Final assessment of these tree attributes was done at 37 months after planting, while psyllid resistance was assessed at 9 and 37 months after planting. During the final assessment occasion, height ranged from 2.69 m for L. collinsii Ex. Chiapas to 4.87 m for L. diversifolia Ex. Veracruz. Diameter at breast height (Dbh) ranged from 2.26 cm for L. shannonnii Ex. Chiapas to 4.93 cm for L. diversifolia Ex. Veracruz, while multiple stems production ranged from 2709 stems ha−1 for L. pulverulenta Ex. Tamaulipas to 7135 stems ha−1 for L. leucocephala Ex. Morogoro and untransformed survival ranged from 43.75% for L. pulverulenta Ex. Tamaulipas to 100% for L. diversifolia Ex. Veracruz. Total wood biomass production ranged from 3.74 t/ha for L. shannonnii Ex. Chiapas to 15.61 t/ha for L. diversifolia Ex. Veracruz. The study has shown that species/provenances differ significantly in survival, diameter, height growth, psyllid resistance, multiple stem production and biomass production. Based on these findings, provenances L. diversifolia Batch (15551), L. diversifolia Ex. Mexico, L. diversifolia Ex. Veracruz and L. pallida Ex. Oaxaca are recommended for Gairo and similar sites. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vegetation response to grazing and planting of Leucaena leucocephala in a Urochloa maximum-dominated grassland in Puerto Rico
PY  - 2006
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745494651&partnerID=40&md5=d856f063bea0043b601a2961da876103
AB  - A considerable portion of the former dry and dry-transition-to-moist forests of Puerto Rico dominated by Bucida buceras L. was transformed by land clearing and periodic fires to tall grasslands dominated by Urochloa maximum Jacq. and savannas with scattered small trees and shrubs. These communities, maintained by fires, are relatively stable and difficult to reforest. A study was carried out to test whether natural recolonization of forest species might be accelerated by excluding grazing livestock or by planting trees to facilitate natural succession. Experimental treatments included grazing exclusion and planting of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (giant variety) at 2 × 2 m and 4 × 4 m, as well as an unprotected control. Tree growth, herbaceous aboveground biomass, and floristic diversity were monitored in experimental plots for 6 years. Floristic diversity (principally weedy species) increased during the first 3 years in grazed plots but decreased thereafter; biodiversity in grazing-protected plots decreased steadily over time. Herbaceous biomass remained fairly constant in grazed plots, increased gradually in protected plots, and decreased precipitously in planted plots after tree basal area surpassed 8 m2/ha. The results of this study suggest that while the suppression of dominant grasses, either by controlled grazing or shading by planted trees can facilitate regeneration of native dry forest plant species, this process is both slow and uncertain on highly degraded sites, and likely to require decades before natural succession processes result in vegetation structure and species composition resembling that of native dry forest stands.

AB  - This study examined the comparative nutrient utilization of indigenous non-descript goats (n = 12) maintained on a basal diet of wheat straw supplemented with a concentrate based on either soybean meal (SBM) or Leucaena leucocephala-Morus alba-Azadirachta indica (2:1:1) leaf meal mixture (LMAM) prior to conception (pre-gestation), and during gestation (n = 8) in a completely randomized design. Concentrate represented 42% and 72% of DM in diet before and during pregnancy, respectively. Therefore, the plane of nutrition and nutrient density in terms of digestible CP and TDN of composite diets offered to does during late gestation were significantly higher relative to non-pregnant does. Intake of DM was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in does during late gestation as compared to their intake during pre-gestation. The digestibility of nutrients and N balance data were comparable (P > 0.05) among goats irrespective of dietary supplements. However, does in late gestation had higher (P < 0.001) nutrient digestibility of DM, OM, and CP and lower digestibility of NDF, ADF, and cellulose as compared to non-pregnant does due to higher dietary ratio of concentrate. Similarly, pregnant does had significantly higher (P < 0.001) intake, excretion and retention of N during late gestation irrespective of diets. The nutritive value of composite diets and plane of nutrition of does were similar (P > 0.05) irrespective of dietary treatments. Apparently, the supplementation of wheat straw either with LMAM or commercial type concentrate containing soybean meal resulted in similar performance of does; the leaf meal mixture could contribute up to 36% of the total DMI in gravid does without any adverse effect on their general health and reproductive performance. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - I observed the use of exotic plant species by native birds and bats in 8 km2 of urban Hong Kong. Twenty-nine plant taxa were used repeatedly. Five species accounted for most interactions with birds: Cinnamomum camphora (10 bird species), Ficus religiosa (6), Livistona chinensis (7) and Pyracantha crenulata (6) provided fruits, while Bombax ceiba (6) supplied nectar. Panicum maximum (2) and C. camphora (1) provided seeds for granivorous birds and Leucaena leucocephala is host to a psyllid consumed by small insectivores in winter. Most trophic interactions between exotics and fruit bats involved the fruits or flowers of Syzygium jambos, while Livistona chinensis provided roosting sites for Cynopterus sphinx. The fruiting phenologies of the exotic species differed from the local flora, with fruit of some species available for the majority of the year. Fruit characteristics for the most commonly eaten species are within the range for native fruit species, although most are larger and have a lower seed load than the medians for native species. Seed dispersal by birds and/or fruit bats is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the naturalization of fleshy-fruited plants in Hong Kong, but S. jambos is the only naturalizing exotic species that needs vertebrates for pollination. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

AB  - The voluntary intake and in vivo digestibility of forage from Indigofera species, Medicago sativa (lucerne) and Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) were determined using South African Mutton Merino sheep with the aim to assess the potential nutritive value of Indigofera compared to the other two species. Both lucerne and Leucaena had higher crude protein (CP) and lower neutral detergent fibre (NDF) concentrations than Indigofera. However, the apparent dry matter digestibility (DMD%) coefficients for Leucaena were lower than either Indigofera or lucerne. The forage species also differed in terms of NDF digestibility, dry matter intake (DMI) and CP intake (g/head/d), but not in terms of neutral detergent fibre intake (NDFI). The difference between Indigofera species and Leucaena forage in terms of DM intake per unit of metabolic body weight (g/W0.75/day) and digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) was not significant, but forage DMI per unit metabolic body weight (g/W0.75/day) of both Indigofera species and Leucaena was significantly lower than DMI of lucerne. In this specific study, lack of differences between Indigofera species and Leucaena in terms of DOMI and digestible NDFI indicates that Indigofera forage would likely support similar weight gains in ruminants as those of Leucaena, but lower than those of lucerne forage. © South African Society for Animal Science.

TI  - Exo-oligosaccharides of Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 are required for symbiosis with various legumes
PY  - 2006
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33749018234&doi=10.1128%2fJB.00365-06&partnerID=40&md5=03b0072fc471a243efdddd796de9f6c7
AB  - Rhizobia are nitrogen-fixing bacteria that establish endosymbiotic associations with legumes. Nodule formation depends on various bacterial carbohydrates, including lipopolysaccharides, K-antigens, and exopolysaccharides (EPS). An acidic EPS from Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 consists of glucosyl (Glc), galactosyl (Gal), glucuronosyl (GlcA), and 4,6-pyruvylated galactosyl (PvGal) residues with β-1,3, β-1,4, β-1,6, α-1,3, and α-1,4 glycoside linkages. Here we examined the role of NGR234 genes in the synthesis of EPS. Deletions within the exoF, exoL, exoP, exoQ, and exoY genes suppressed accumulation of EPS in bacterial supernatants, a finding that was confirmed by chemical analyses. The data suggest that the repeating subunits of EPS are assembled by an ExoQ/ExoP/ExoF-dependent mechanism, which is related to the Wzy polymerization system of group 1 capsular polysaccharides in Escherichia coli. Mutation of exoK (NGRΩexoK), which encodes a putative glycanase, resulted in the absence of low-molecular-weight forms of EPS. Analysis of the extracellular carbohydrates revealed that NGRΩexoK is unable to accumulate exo-oligosaccharides (EOSs), which are O-acetylated nonasaccharide subunits of EPS having the formula Gal(Glc)5(GlcA)2PvGal. When used as inoculants, both the exo-deficient mutants and NGRΩexoK were unable to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on some hosts (e.g., Albizia lebbeck and Leucaena leucocephala), but they were able to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on other hosts (e.g., Vigna unguiculata). EOSs of the parent strain were biologically active at very low levels (yield in culture supernatants, ∼50 μg per liter). Thus, NGR234 produces symbiotically active EOSs by enzymatic degradation of EPS, using the extracellular endo-β-1,4-glycanase encoded by exoK (glycoside hydrolase family 16). We propose that the derived EOSs (and not EPS) are bacterial components that play a crucial role in nodule formation in various legumes. Copyright © 2006, American Society for Microbiology.

PY  - 2006
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745728851&doi=10.1017%2fS0022112006000231&partnerID=40&md5=0606d21f832afded0c4496c6b3163679
AB  - An experimental study is presented on contact angle dynamics during spreading/recoiling of mm-sized water droplets impacting orthogonally on various surfaces with We = O(0.1) - O(10), Ca = O(0.001) - O(0.01), Re = O(100) - O(1000), Oh = O(0.001) and Bo = O (0.1). In this impact regime, inertial, viscous and capillary phenomena act in unison to influence contact angle dynamics. The wetting properties of the target surfaces range from wettable to non-wettable. The experiments feature accelerating and decelerating wetting lines, capillary surface waves in the early impact stages, contact angle hysteresis, and droplet rebound under non-wetting conditions. The objective of the work is to provide insight into the dynamic behaviour of the apparent (macroscopic) contact angle θ and its dependence on contact line velocity VCL at various degrees of surface wetting. By correlating the temporal behaviours of θ and VCL, the angle vs. speed relationship is established for each case examined. The results reveal that surface wettability has a critical influence on dynamic contact angle behaviour. The hydrodynamic wetting theory of Cox (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 357, 1998, p. 249) and the molecular-kinetic theory of wetting by Blake & Haynes (J. Colloid Interface Sci.) vol. 30, 1969, p. 421) are implemented to extract values of the corresponding microscopic wetting parameters required to match the experimentally observed θ data. Application of hydrodynamic theory indicates that in the slow stage of forced spreading the slip length and the microscopic contact angle should be contact line velocity dependent. The hydrodynamic theory performs well during kinematic (fast) spreading, in which solid/liquid interactions are weak. Application of the molecular kinetic theory yields physically reasonable molecular wetting parameters, which, however, vary with impact conditions. The results indicate that even for a single liquid there is no universal expression to relate contact angle with contact line speed. Finally, analysis of the spreading dynamics on the non-wettable surfaces shows that it conforms to the Cassie-Baxter regime (only partial liquid/solid contact is maintained). The present results offer guidance for numerical or analytical studies, which require careful attention to the implementation of boundary conditions at the moving contact line, including the need to specify the dependence of contact angle on contact line speed. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Leaf pruning from several legume species: Gliricidia sepium, Cajanus cajan, Albizia zygia, Albizia ferruginea, Leucaena leucocephala, Dalbergia latifolia, Acacia auriculiformis were analysed for some critical litter quality indices such as total carbon, nitrogen, lignin and polyphenols. Total C was estimated as 50% of its ash free dry weight and total N was determined by Kjeldahl method while lignin content was determined from the acid detergent fibre. The polyphenol content was extracted in 70% aqueous acetone after initial depigmentation with diethyl ether containing 1% acetic acid and determined as tannic acid equivalent using Folin Ciocalteu reagent. Total C ranged from 42.8% in Albizia zygia to 49.6% in Acacia auriculiformis while N ranged from 3.9% in Acacia and Albizia ferruginea to 4.8% in Gliricidia sepium. Gliricidia had the lowest polyphenol content (2.3%) while Acacia contained the highest value (7.7%). The lignin content varied from 23.9% in Gliricidia to 49.7% in A. auriculiformis. Based on the leaf chemical constituents, Gliricidia sepium was rated as high quality litter while Acacia auriculiformis was rated as low quality litter. © 2006 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - This is the first systematic study of rhizobia associated with Albizia trees. The analyses of PCR-RFLP and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins and clustering of phenotypic characters grouped the 31 rhizobial strains isolated from Albizia into eight putative species within the genera Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium. Among these eight rhizobial species, five were unique to Albizia and the remaining three were shared with Acacia and Leucaena, two legume trees coexisting with Albizia in China. These results indicated that Albizia species nodulate with a wide range of rhizobial species and had preference of microsymbionts different from Acacia and Leucaena. The definition of four novel groups, Mesorhizobium sp., Rhizobium sp. I, Rhizobium sp. II and "R. giardinii", indicates that further studies with enlarged rhizobial population are necessary to better understand the diversity and to clarify the taxonomic relationships of Albizia-associated rhizobia. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - A 56-day feeding trial was conducted to evaluate forage legumes (Medicago sativa, Dolichos lablab, Leucaena leucocephala and Desmanthus bicornutus) as protein supplements to a sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor) diet based on growth and feed performance of growing goats. Twenty-four castrated kids were used in the experiment with an average initial age of 135 days and body weight of 18.7 kg. Kids were Boer × Spanish crossbreds. Four dietary treatments were composed of sudangrass (60% of diet offered) supplemented with one of four forage legumes (40% of diet offered) and corn (0.2 kg/day). A split-plot design was employed with diet as the main plot, pens as experimental units (consisting of three pens per diet as replicates) and goats as samples (two goats per pen). Fixed effects of breed type, litter size born, parity of dam and initial age of kid as a linear covariate were added to the model for growth traits. All forage legumes had over 20% crude protein (CP). Final body weight was not affected by diet (P > 0.05). Average daily gain (ADG) tended (P < 0.10) to be more rapid for goats fed leucaena compared to desmanthus (least squares means of 93.9 and 60.9 g/day, respectively). Voluntary daily feed intakes of sudangrass and alfalfa were higher by 22 and 33 g (P < 0.01 and <0.001) per goat for pens receiving alfalfa with sudangrass compared to combined mean intakes of pens fed experimental forage legumes. Intake of leucaena compared to desmanthus forage was higher by 97 g/day (P < 0.001), demonstrating relatively poorer acceptability of desmanthus. Also, goats fed leucaena had better (P < 0.05) gain efficiency (ADG/total feed intake) compared to goats fed desmanthus. Experimental results suggest that L. leucocephala had more potential for feeding growing goats in tropical regions compared to the other forage legumes evaluated. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to extensive land clearing in northeastern Mexico, there is an increasing need for restoration for which knowledge on plant establishment biology becomes a priority, for restoration practices. In here we tested the influence of current environmental variation on the establishment biology of common woody species from Tamaulipan thornscrub. Seedling establishment was monitored; four native species (Acacia berlandieri Benth., Ebenopsis ebano (Benth.) Coult, Havardia pallens (Benth.) Brintton and Rose, Prosopis laevigata (Humb & Bonpl. ex. Wild.) M.C. Johston), and one exotic species (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit). Seedling emergence, seedling survivorship, length of stems and number of leaves were evaluated over 1 year in environments with different light regimes: (i) dense thornscrub; (ii) thornscrub edge; (iii) cleared thornscrub (direct sunlight). Ten plots of 4 m2 (2 m x 2 m) were sampled in each environment. Seedling emergence occurred on spring and late summer and was greater on dense thornscrub for all species. Native species had higher survivorship and growth and had more leaves in dense thornscrub than in other environments. Exotic L. leucocephala had similar survivorship, shoot length and number of leaves across environments. All seedlings from all species died by late spring, possibly due to environmental stress. Seedling survival was longer for all native plants, as there were surviving seedlings in early spring for all species but not of exotic L. leucocephala. Perhaps mainly as a result of high temperature and low humidity. Additional watering, shading and moisture retaining gels should thus be considered when rehabilitation programs are made with seeds and seedlings in the region. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An experiment was performed to evaluate the toxicity of Leucaena leucocephala for sheep. Two ewes and six lambs were divided into seven treatments and fed the plant. The adult ewes did not show clinical signs of poisoning. The 4 to 5-month-old lambs presented partial wool loss 6 days after beginning of the administration of the plant and total wool loss after 12 or 20 days. The age of the sheep in this experiment suggests resistance of adult ewes and susceptibility of young lambs to L. leucocaephala poisoning.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the neutralising effect of Browse Plus™ on condensed tannins in a sole diet of Leucaena forage and how that affected feed intake, rumen environment and passage of nutrients. Partial digestion methods were used. Results showed that the use of Browse Plus™ had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on some parameters. It increased the daily feed intake by 32%, and it raised the production of rumen ammonia and volatile fatty acids by 65.6% and 19.4%, respectively. However, Browse Plus™ did not affect the rumen environment and the proportions of volatile fatty acids significantly (P < 0.05). We concluded that Browse Plus™ had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on rumen protein degradation, while the combined effect of Browse Plus™ and Synergistes jonesii bacteria prevented both mimosine and condensed tannin toxicity, which resulted in more efficient rumen fermentation and absorption of nutrients in the small intestines.

AB  - The objective of this research was to determine the alternative uses of forage trees of the Region de Tierra Caliente, Michoacan, Mexico. Fifteen surveys were made in the 6 counties of the Region, to groups of cattle raisers; information about the traditional uses of the forage trees was obtained. In the District of Rural Development 093, the cattle raisers identified the existence of 80 trees with forage and alternative uses for the producers. The county of Carácuaro showed the greater diversity with 73 species; and the one with the lower diversity was San Lucas with 17 species. The uses were: for fuelwood (28.3 %), posts for fences (25.2 %), medicine for humans (15.2 %), manufacture of tools (14.6 %), human consumption (13.5 %) and medicine for animals (3.3 %). The trees with the highest variety of uses are: Cordia elaeagnoides with 64.3 %, followed by Crescentia alata 54.4 %, Haematoxylon brasiletto 52.8 %, Ziziphus amole 46.1 %, Pithecellobium acatlense 45.6 %, Guazuma ulmifolia 45.2 %, Pithecellobium dulce 42 %, Caesalpinia coriaria 40.6 %, Acacia macilenta 38.5 %, Leucaena leucocephala 36.95 %, Mastichodendron capiri 33.7 % and Lysiloma divaricata 33.5 %. The traditional uses of these trees are diverse and represent a potential in their exploitation, provided the usage is not taken to excess.

AB  - During recent decades, a considerable number of alien species have been brought into Taiwan and have caused significant impacts to local ecosystems and biodiversity. High resolution satellite imagery can provide detailed spatial characteristics over a large area and has a great potential for accurate vegetation mapping. However, most traditional multispectral image classification techniques focus on spectral discrimination of ground objects and may overlook useful spatial information provided by high resolution images. To achieve the best result, analysis of high resolution imagery should also incorporate spatial variations of the data. Therefore, this paper has looked into using a texture augmented procedure to analyze a high resolution satellite (QuickBird) image in order to detect an invasive plant species (Leucaena leucocephala) in southern Taiwan. Samples of primary vegetation covers were selected from the image to determine suitable texture analysis parameters for extracting texture features helpful for classification. Validation with ground truth data showed that the analysis produced high accuracies in detecting the target plant species and overall classification for primary vegetation types within the study site. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate nutrient content, in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and distribution of macro mineral in neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF). Three species of grass (Axonopus compressus, Panicum maximum and Pennisetum purpuphoides) and four species of legumes (Leucaena leucocephala, Centrocema pubescens, Calopogonium mucunoides and Acacia mangium) were collected at native pasture in South Sumatra, Indonesia, during rainy and dry seasons. The results showed that crude protein (CP) content was significantly (P<0.05) different between forage species in both rainy and dry seasons except for C. mucunoides and A. mangium. The CP content of grass in rainy season ranged from 81 (A. compressus) to 130 g kg -1 DM (P. purpuphoides) while in dry season from 79 (A. compressus) to 152 g kg-1 DM (P. maximum). The CP content of legume was significantly higher (P<0.05) compared to grass; ranged from 177 (C. pubescens) to 252 g kg-1 DM (L. leucocephala) in rainy season and from 146 (C. pubescens) to 223 g kg-1 DM (A. mangium) in dry season. In general, NDF, ADF and acid detergent lignin (ADL) contents were lower in rainy season compared to dry season. Concentration of Ca, P, Mg and S either in intact forages or in NDF and ADF were significantly (P<0.01) different between species and seasons. In general, P. purpuphoides and L. leucocephala had better nutritive value in rainy and dry seasons and distribution of macro mineral concentration could be due to most of elements were found in the cell content than in cell wall and should be more available to ruminants.

AB  - An experiment was undertaken to study the time of intercropping corn (Zea mays) after the sowing of a silvopastoral system leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru)-guinea grass (Panicum maximum cv Likoni). A random block design was used with 5 replicates. The treatments consisted of leucaena-guinea grass intercropped with com at 15 and 40 d after the emergence of leucaena-guinea grass and leucaena-guinea without intercropping. The work was developed on a red ferralic soil. The sowing of leucaena and guinea grass was performed in the rainy season. The first was carried out in doble furrows 0.7 m apart and at a distance of 3 m and at 0.5 m between plants. The grass was spread on the plot with a seed dosage of 0.5 kg/ha of PGS. Throughout the experiment, the weed development was controlled. The measurements were: population, plant height, yield of the species, and weed presence. The leucaena population was lower (P < 0.05) when intercropped with corn at 15 d after the germination of leucaena-guinea grass. The same situation occurred for the plant height. The population of guinea grass was lower (P < 0.01) with the intercropping at 40 d, whereas the plant height was better with no intercropping. The leucaena yield was lower (P < 0.01) for the intercropping at 15 d, while in guinea grass, this happened (P < 0.01) in the treatment with com intercropping at 40 d. The joint analysis for the yield of leucaena-guinea grass-weed indicated a better result (P < 0.05) by not intercropping. The best grain production of grains and forages of the system was attained by intercropping corn at 15 d of germination of both components. It is recommended to encourage the silvopastoral systems using corn intercropping at 15 d after the germination of leucaena-guinea grass at the beginning of the rainy season.

AB  - Field experiments were carried out on an alley-cropping farm in Ajibode village, near Ibadan where cassava alley-cropped with three hedgerow trees (Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Senna (Syn Cassia) siamea), and sole planted cassava (all in three replicates) were arranged with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation (with Glomus deserticolum) in a completely randomized block design. Each plot was split after the first year into two and hedgerows within subjected to 2 and 3-month pruning regimes. Wet and dry season mulch contribution by pruning to alley-cropped cassava, as well as cassava yield characteristics in both alley-cropped and sole plots as affected by AMF inoculation and pruning regimes were monitored over two consecutive planting periods. During the first pruning year, AMF inoculation promoted dry season pruning production which was masked in Leucaena at 3 months by biomass diversion into flowering and in Gliricidia with both flowering and mite infestation. No definite patterns were observed in the second pruning year due to development of indigenous AMF symbiosis in all plots. Total yield of cassava increased with inoculation in all plots but dry season leaf area values and tuber yield indices were relatively higher in cassava alley-cropped with Senna and sole cassava than in others. The low total yield of sole cassava makes cassava alley cropped with Senna (inoculated or uninoculated) the best option for maintaining steady tuber yield with time in a continuing alley-cropping system. © 2006 Academic Journals.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the shoot phytomass and shrub legumes N, P and K accumulation in agroforestry system (alley cropping system) and study the effect of P fertilization. Two field experiments were carried out - without and with P application - for two years: 2004 and 2005, using shrub legumes in Campos dos Goytacazes - RJ - Brazil. The treatments consisted of alley cropping system with the species: Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth., Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Taub., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) R. de Wit., Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp., Sesbania virgata (Cav.) Pers., Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth.e Gliricidia sepium (Jacq) Pers.. Eight months after the plantation, the legumes were pruned at 1.5-m height, and the shoot phytomass was weighed. Stems with diameter higher than 1.5 cm were not considered in the weighed phytomass. The dry matter obtained in the pruning was expressed as kg ha-1 year -1. Samples from the pruning were used to determine the dry phytomass and N, P and K contents. New pruning was carried out eighty days after the first cut. In the first crop year, Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. produced the highest dry phytomass and accumulated the highest amounts of N, P and K; while in the second year, in the experiment with P fertilization, Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp., Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Stend. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. produced the highest dry phytomass, and Leucaena accumulated the highest amount of K in shoot phytomass. Phytomass productivity was higher when some legumes received phosphorus application.

AB  - The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can promote plant tolerance to heavy metals and have been indicated for use in revegetation processes. The effect of native and introduced AMF on the growth of seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala on soils of caatinga biome impacted by copper mining (Mineração Caraíba, Jaguarari Municipality, Bahia State) was evaluated. The experiment was set up in a complete randomized design, in a 3 x 4 factorial arrangement, considering soil from preserved caatinga and substrates of a site from which the topsoil was removed and a site which received copper waste; and four inoculation treatments (uninoculated control, inoculated with Glomus etunicatum, Acaulospora longula, and a mixture of the two fungi), with five replicates. Independently of the inoculation treatment, the area where the topsoil was removed was more indicated for preparing the seedlings of leucaena, while the soil from the waste site was not suitable for growth of this plant and the establishment of mycorrhizal association. Although infective, G. etunicatum was not efficient in promoting growth of leucaena in the impacted areas, while the native AMF, A. longula and the mixture of fungi contributed to the development of the seedlings.

AB  - Leaf meals (LMs) from freshly harvested leaves of butterfly pea (Centrosema pubescens), devil bean (Mucuna pruriens), flamboyant flower (Delonix regia), Bauhinia tomentosa, coast wattle (Acacia auriculiformis), quick stick (Glyricidia sepium) and ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala) were analysed for their nutrient and anti-nutritional content. Then, leaf protein concentrates (LPCs) were produced from the leaves by fractionation and characterised along with the fibrous residues. On average, the LM contained 181 g kg-1 dry matter (DM) CP (range: 100-280 g kg-1 DM), 139 g kg-1 DM crude fibre (range: 77-230 g kg-1 DM) and 133 g kg-1 DM ether extract (range: 86-165 g kg-1 DM) while the gross energy averaged 17.0 MJ kg-1. On average, leaf protein fractionation enhanced the CP, ether extract and the gross energy in the LPC by 39.5%, 33.5% and 22.0%, respectively, while the crude fibre of the LMs was reduced by 41%, on average, in the LPCs. Fractionation reduced the mineral content of the leaves generally. The mean phytin content varied from 0.36 g kg-1 in LPCs to 0.86 g kg-1 in leaf meal, while the mean phytin-P content varied from 0.10 g kg-1 in LPCs to 0.24 g kg-1 in leaf meal. The total phenol levels in the LMs were reduced by 33.7% in the LPCs, on average. These results suggest that, while the LPCs from these plants could be used as protein supplements in non-ruminant feeds in regions where there is an acute shortage of plant protein, the LMs or LPC fibrous residues could be fed to ruminant animals. © 2006 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The occurrence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in plantations of Leucaena leucocephala L. (leucaena) and Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth (sabia) in the State of Pernambuco was investigated. Soil samples were collected in five research centers of the Agricultural Research Institute of Pernambuco (IPA), in the cities of Arcoverde - plantation of leucaena (AL) and sabiá (AS); Caruaru (CL) - leucaena plantation; Itambé (IS), São Bento do Una (SBS) and Serra Talhada (STS) - plantation of sabiá. Mycorrhizal spores were extracted from soil, with the highest number (437/50g of soil) being found in the CL region and the lowest (69/50g of soil) in the STS region. The mycorrhizal colonization ranged from 11% (CL) to 64% (IS). The colonization was inferior to 15% in areas of leucaena plantation, however, in areas of sabiá, it ranged from 36% to 64%. Twenty-four AMF species were identified in the genus: Acaulospora (6), Archaeospora (1), Entrophospora (1), Gigaspora (3), Glomus (6), Paraglomus (1) and Scutellospora (6). The highest species number was recorded in the CL and STS regions (14). Acaulospora scrobiculata, Archaeospora leptoticha and Glomus etunicatum were found in all regions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of varying levels of Leucaena supplement on the intake, flow and digestibility of nutrients of two low-quality forages. Partial digestion methods were used. The overall results showed that the supplementation of veld grass with Leucaena hay improved the performance of veld grass more significantly (P < 0.05) than the supplementation of Eragrostis grass with Leucaena hay. The crude protein of Diets 2-4, which contained veld grass, increased by 67.1%, 95.3% and 130.6%, compared with the control diet, while the in vitro organic matter digestibility increased by 15.5%, 25.7% and 15.24%, respectively. Similarly, neutral detergent fibre content decreased by 6.5%, 14.7% and 23.3%, respectively. Feed intake increased by 22.7%, 14.9% and 11.3%, and crude protein intake increased by 2.13, 2.25 and 2.57 times, respectively. The production of ammonia nitrogen increased by 17%, 38.4% and 44.3%, and volatile fatty acids increased by 31.3%, 28% and 26%, respectively. The flow of non-ammonia nitrogen through the abomasum increased by 3.28, 3.9 and 4.76 times, respectively. The disappearance of organic matter from the rumen increased by 29.3%, 36.2% and 24.7% and in the small intestine increased by 1.8, 2.3 and 2.2 times, respectively. The overall digestibility of organic matter in the whole digestive tract was increased by 9.9%, 16.3% and 9.7%, respectively. In comparison, the crude protein of Diets 6-8, which contained Eragrostis grass, increased by 37.5%, 80% and 103.3%, compared with the control, while the neutral detergent fibre content decreased by 4.8%, 14.8% and 21.6%, respectively. Feed intake increased by 41.3%, 36% and 28.4%, and crude protein intake by 1.93, 2.43 and 2.52 times, respectively. The production of ammonia nitrogen increased by 13.8%, 25% and 21.7%, and volatile fatty acids increased by 18.8%, 17.4% and 14.7%, respectively. The flow of non-ammonia nitrogen through the abomasum increased by 1.27, 166 and 1.50 times, respectively. However, there was no significant effect on the flow of the other nutrients. However, the overall digestibility of organic matter was not significantly different from that of the control diet. The conclusion was that the supplementation of the poorer forage with Leucaena was more beneficial and more cost-effective than the supplementation of the better-quality forage with Leucaena.

AB  - The nutritive value and in vitro digestibility of maize stover associated with tropical legume tree's leaves (Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena trichandra and Leucaena diversifolia) was evaluated in the laboratory of the Faculty of Agronomy and Agricultural Sciences of the University of Dschang. Maize stover and legumes were mixed (350 mg of maize stover and 150 mg of legumes) analysed and incubated during 24 hours. The results of this study revealed that the crude protein of maize stover was 4.63% and varied from 10.3 to 13.7% in association with legumes. The maize stover produced 43.5% ml/200mg DM of gas and in association with legumes its varied between 42.88 and 47.1 ml/200mg DM. We also noticed a highest and variable shot chain fatty acid (SCFA) production (0.96 - 1.06 mmol/40ml) when maize stover were associated with legumes. Metabolisable energy of maize stover associated with Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala was significantly (p<0.05) higher than that of maize stover incubated alone and that of other associations. The organic matter digestibility (OMD) of maize stover was statistically (p<0.05) lower than maize stover associated with legumes. The microbial mass produced from degradation of maize stover was significantly (p<0.05) lower than those produced from the association with Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala, and there were no significant (p>0.05) difference compared to those produced from other combinaisons. In general, legumes improved the production of gas, of SCFA, of ME and OMD of maize stover. However, the association of maize stover with Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala seems to be the better combinaison.

AB  - Forty growing goats (20 males and 20 females) were used in a 90-day growth and intake study to evaluate the potential of Albizia lebbeck (ABC) based concentrate as compared with Gliricidia sepium (GBC), Leucaena leucocephala (LBC), and Moringa oleifera (MBC) based concentrates with cotton seed cake (CSC) as a control. The animals were fed a basal diet of maize stover and supplemented daily with 30 g/kg W0.75 of ABC, GBC, LBC, MBC, and CSC. They were compounded so as to formulate iso-protein diets. Treatment effects were significant (p<0.05) for growth rates in that with the exception of GBC, goats on CSC exhibited significantly higher gains compared to counterparts in other treatments. The total DM intake was between 50.6 and 52.6 g/kg W 0.75/day and there were no significant (p>0.05) differences among treatments. There were significant differences (p<0.05) among treatments for maize stover intake. CSC based treatment showed the highest intake with insignificant (p>0.05) differences amongst the leaf meal based concentrates. It can be concluded that Albizia lebbeck had similar potential to the other leaf meal based supplements studied but had lower potential compared to a cotton seed cake based supplement, as protein sources for growing goats fed a poor quality basal diet. © Springer 2006.

AB  - A survey was conducted to determine the level of adoption of forage and browse legumes and to identify the major constraints limiting their adoption in the smallholder dairy sector of Zimbabwe. Sixty households were selected using stratified random sampling from a sampling frame of 174 registered farmers in Nharira-Lancashire Dairy Scheme in Chikomba District of Zimbabwe. The majority of households were aware (94.7 %) and 87.9 % adopted forage/browse legume technologies. Results showed that most of the farmers were full-adopters based on the type of species used (66.7 %) and area under forage (47.8 %) criteria. The most commonly adopted species were Mucuna pruriens (60.6 %) and Leucaena leucocephala (53.5 %). The size of household, land size and number of dairy cattle significantly affected adoption of forage/browse legume technologies. Lack of inputs, low yields and lack of persistence of legumes and lack of fencing material were identified as core factors limiting adoption of forage/browse legume technologies. Stakeholders' support in smallholder dairying should continue to be extended to resource-poor farmers as well as to the more receptive targets with access to resources for investment. This should be executed through participatory approaches to achieve widespread and long-term benefits of adopting forage/browse legume technologies for sustainable smallholder dairy production in Zimbabwe.

AB  - Five species each of tree leaves, shrubs and grasses were nutritionally evaluated for their chemical constituents, carbohydrates, proteins and nitrogen fractions, following the Cornell net carbohydrate and protein system (CNCP). A summative approach was also used to derive the TDN (total digestible nutrient, (%DM) at 1X maintenance) values of these feeds so that more realistic values can be obtained to decide their appropriate level of incorporation in total mixed ration of the ruminants. The CP varied from 12.27 to 21.79, 11.27 to 17.49 and 3.49 to 4.27% in tree leaves, shrubs and grasses, respectively. Among the tree leaves, CP was highest in Leucaena leucocephala (21.79%) followed by Albizia lebbek (20.85%) and lowest in Anogeissus pendula (17.49%). In shrubs, the CP was maximum in Dichrostachys cinerea. Grasses were the richest in total carbohydrates compared to shrubs and tree leaves. Non-structural carbohydrate content varied greatly among the tree leaves, shrubs and grasses. Significantly lesser quantity of fraction C was present in Grewia optiva, Securengia virosa and Heteropogan contertus in tree leaves, shrubs and grasses respectively. The instantly degradable fraction A of nitrogen was higher in tree leaves followed by grasses and shrubs, whereas rapidly degradable fraction B1 was higher in grasses followed by shrubs and tree leaves. Among the tree leaves and shrubs, Grewia optiva, Leucaena leucocephala, Securengia virosa and Zizyphus xylophyrus can be used as good sources of quality protein whereas, among the grasses, Heteropogan contortus and Dichanthium annulatum are better energy sources to the ruminants. The TDN estimates (at 1*X level of maintenance) showed a significant (P<0.01) positive correlation with in vitro DM (r 2=0.42) and CP (r2=0.59) digestibility, thus indicated the trustworthiness of the mathematical model used to derive these TDN estimates.

AB  - Effect of neighbouring species on growth and foliar nutrient status of companion species was studied in mixed plantation raised on coal mine spoil. The three combinations used were legume:legume,legume:non-legume and non-legume:non-legume. The neighbouring species had influenced the growth and foliar N and P status of companion species in mixed plantations. Acacia catechu had shown greater growth and foliar N and P status when grown with neighbouring legume Pongamia pinnata than when grown with another neighbouring legume Albizia lebbeck. The growth and foliar N and P status of non-legumes Gmelina arborea and Terminalia bellerica were greater when these species were grown with the legume Pongamia pinnata than when grown with non-legume. The legume Pongamia pinnata had exhibited better growth and increased N and P concentration when grown with non-legumes Gmelina arborea and Terminalia bellerica than when grown with legume Acacia catechu. Tectona grandis, on other hand side, had shown reduced growth and foliar N and P concentration, when grown with neighbouring legumes Dalbergia sissoo and Leucaena leucocephala than when grown with neighbouring non-legume Dendrocalamus strictus. The growth rates (height, diameter and volume increments) were positively related to foliar N and P concentration. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.

AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing images provide more complete and detailed spectral information about ground coverage and have a great potential to identify specific plant species in vegetation covered areas. The high data dimensionality of hyperspectral data can cause substantial impact to its applications. Principal component analysis is a common technique used for feature reduction in remote sensing image analysis. However, it may also overlook subtle but useful information. This research developed a segmented principal component analysis scheme that can be used to reduce the dimensionality of a hyperspectral image but also retain critical spectral features helpful in discriminating different vegetation types. The developed methodology was applied to the analysis of a Hyperion hyperspectal image to determine the status of an invasive plant species (Leucaena leucocephala) in southern Taiwan. © 2005 IEEE.

TI  - Rumen degradability of dry matter and total nitrogen in cows, in a grazing system of grasses and legumes
PY  - 2006

AB  - The in situ effective rumen degradability of dry matter (DM) and total nitrogen (Nt) of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) was determined in three cows fitted with cannula in rumen. They were subject to a grazing system of grasses (Cynodon nlemfuensis) and legumes in the form of protein banks (Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium), in a ratio 50:50. The values of effective rumen degradability varied between 41.53-51.70%, 37.92-47.66% and 36.97-47.41%, in each of the feeds, respectively, using different constants of rumen turnover. However, values of effective rumen degradability of Nt up to 60.56% were found in gliricidia, followed by leucaena (49.60) and star grass (46.91), with levels of degradable nitrogen that decreased with the constant increase of rumen turnover. It was found that the legumes studied had higher DM and Nt degradability than star grass and a high nutritional potential. The high protein concentration and its dynamics of degradation in rumen suggest that the inclusion in low-quality diets may improve the efficiency of utilization and keep adequate production levels. The evaluation of the use of these legume species should be continued for ruminant supplementation, combined with tropical grasses. Thus, the potential of the legumes may be used to provide peptides and amino acids to the rumen microorganisms and bypassing nutrients. Besides, an optimum use of the lignocellulosic compound may be made as energy source for the animal through rumen fermentation.

AB  - The influence of reforestation was evaluated during two season periods (February and October) in sites planted with Corymbia citriodora and Leucaena leucocephala through microorganism counts (bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, and nitrite oxidizers) and microbial activity (respiratory and urease activities). An Atlantic forest and a bare soil site were used as controls. The general trends of the variables in the different soils were: Atlantic forest or L. leucocephala > C. citriodora > bare soil. The microbial populations in L. leucocephala and C. citriodora soils were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that found in the bare soil. Similar results were obtained for respiratory and urease activities. The microbiological variables of the soil under L. leucocephala were comparable or even superior to that found under Atlantic forest. An improvement in the microbiological soil variables was observed in the soil under C. citriodora when compared to the soil without vegetation. These results can be attributed to an increasing amount of total organic C of the soils under L. leucocephala and C. citriodora in relation to the soil without vegetation. Although most results obtained in February presented higher values than in October, the sampling period did not have a consistent controlling influence on these variables.

PY  - 2006
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33847661959&doi=10.1300%2fJ064v29n01_10&partnerID=40&md5=fba058c532cef138aab9db9d1ddf24d2
AB  - Sustainable increase in agricultural production was achieved in the past through the use of bush-fallow farming system. Extensive land use due to urbanization, increase in population and high farming population has led to reduction in fallow period. As a consequence, rapid deterioration of soil structure and declining productivity constitute major problems of agricultural productivity. Amid the efforts for increase in agricultural productivity, many developing countries are concerned about the environmental effects of agricultural technologies. The focus is on sustainable agricultural technologies that can increase yield as well as regenerate soil fertility without fallow. This was achieved through alley farming developed by researchers in the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, Nigeria. This paper examines the impact of alley farming on crops and livestock production. Surveys indicate that farmers are adopting the technology and that the initial adopters continue to use alley farming. Crops yield increased with alley farming and hedgerows reduced erosion and runoff. When prunings from Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium planted in alley farms were fed to cattle and ruminant animals, there was increased survival and body weight. Moreover, dairy cow milk production increased significantly. Constraints to alley farming adoption include lack of knowledge about its benefits and lack of money. The paper concludes with suggestions for effective extension of alley farming to enhance adoption. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the diet of 2 island-dwelling phyllostomids, the brown flower bat (Erophylla sezekorni) and the Greater Antillean long-tongued bat (Monophyllus redmani), by analyzing fecal contents and pollen swabs from >100 individuals of each species. Although both bats are putative nectar-feeders, their feeding niches were differentiated. A greater proportion of M. redmani (91%) consumed nectar compared with E. sezekorni (50%), but the reverse was true for fruits (22% versus 85%, respectively); about 75% of both species included insects in their diets. However, insect consumption in E. sezekorni was dominated by coleopterans, whereas in M. redmani, diet was more diverse and included soft-bodied prey, such as lepidopterans and dipterans. Both species consumed fruits of Panama berry (Mutingia calabura) and elder (Piper aduncum), but E. sezekorni also included turkey berry (Solanum torvum). When consuming nectar, E. sezekorni often fed at flowers of guava (Psidium guajava), whereas M. redmani visited flowers of guava, woman's tongue (Albizia lebbek), myrtle (Eugenia), and wild tamarind (Leucaena leucocephala). Interspecific differences in diet are consistent with published differences in craniodental and wing (flight) characteristics. The more diverse diet of M. redmani and its lesser reliance on fruit may allow it to survive stochastic events, such as hurricanes, and recover more quickly than populations of E. sezekorni. © 2006 American Society of Mammalogists.

AB  - Due to the low infectivity potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in a mining area located at the State of Bahia, Northeastern Brazil, the effect of mycorrhization on the seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala was investigated, in order to use this species for revegetation of the area. Caatinga soils from both, natural (control) and mining impacted areas, were used to maintain seedlings inoculated with Glomus etunicatum. The soil from the impacted area was diluted 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% with soil from the control area. In general, the increase in the proportion of contaminated soil had a negative effect on plant growth. Inoculated plants presented greater height, leaf number and dry matter of roots and shoots than the non-inoculated plants, when cultivated in soil with up to 50% of contaminated soil. Higher spore number was produced in substrate with 25% soil contamination. Mycorrhizal colonization was higher than 40% in those treated with <50% disturbed soil. Proportions of copper contaminated soil higher than 50%, inhibited plant growth, development of the AMF in the roots and consequently, the benefit of mycorrhization. The pattern of Cu and P absorption in Leucaena, associated or not with G. etunicatum, is maintained when the soil is up to 50% contaminated. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Planting trees to stabilize metalliferous mine tailings is a widely used form of land reclamation although substantial soil amendment is invariably required, both to improve the physico-chemical status of the tailings and to ameliorate toxicity prior to planting. Here, we report a glasshouse study of the combined effects of burrowing earthworms (Pheretima guillelmi) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomus spp., AMF) on establishment of a naturally invasive, woody, nitrogen-fixing legume, Leucaena leucocephala, on topsoil-amended Pb/Zn mine tailings. AMF provided the most effective preliminary inoculant, improving N, P and K uptake, but earthworms had more influence improving N nutrition. In most cases, the combined effects of AMF and earthworms were additive and proved to be beneficial to plant growth, plant nutrition and for protection against uptake of toxic metals. AMF influenced metal uptake more than earthworms, but together they reduced mobility of Pb and Zn in soil by as much as 25%. Some minor but significant negative interactions were also evident; for example, earthworms enhanced soil microbial activity but inhibited the beneficial effects of AMF on N2-fixation. We argue that increased attention to ecological interactions in soil could reduce costs and improve the efficacy of restoring a vegetation cover to land impacted by contaminated spoils. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To investigate the effect of applied phosphate, sulphate along with organic manures on available phosphorus, sulphur and per cent phosphorus and sulphur derived from fertilizer (%pdff and %sdff) in soil with mustard crop, were studied at Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi in 2000-2001 with three levels of phosphorus (0, 40 and 80 kg P2O5 ha -1), two levels of sulphur (0 and 40 kg S ha-1) and three levels of organic manures (no organic manure, FYM @ 10 t ha-1 and green leaf manure (Leucaena leucocephala) @ 5 t ha-1). Both the organic manures were applied before sowing of mustard. Soil samples at 7, 15, 30 days and at flowering stage of mustard were analyzed for available phosphorus and sulphur. The soil was sandy loam in texture, alkaline in reaction, low in organic carbon and mineralizable nitrogen, medium in available phosphorus and potassium. The results showed steady increase in the pool of available phosphate and sulphate with their application at initial stage of crop growth (7 DAS). The level gradually, but marginally, declined for available phosphorus and increased for available sulphur with crop growth. Both the sources of organic manure either maintained or improved the available pool of phosphorus and sulphur and the effect due to green leaf manure was evidently higher. However, combined application of phosphate and sulphate enhanced the P availability. The radio assay of the samples revealed that the contribution of applied phosphate in the available pool decreased gradually with time, whereas, it continued to increase up to flowering stage with sulphate during growth period of mustard.

AB  - Many interspecific hybrids have been produced among Leucaena species, some with great potential for high-value wood and forage production. Superior hybrids are often highly sterile, and vegetative propagation would be essential for their exploitation. Four experiments were conducted to investigate factors affecting the rooting of cuttings of Leucaena hybrids. Nine hybrids were studied that represented different ploidy levels (2x, 3x, and 4x), different levels of seedlessness, different ages (5-16 years) and varying leaflet sizes. Rooting ability basically depended on genotype, with only a few hybrids failing to root. Cuttings required leaflets to root, and half or more of a leaf led to higher frequencies of better roots. One-node cuttings had the same rooting ability as two-node cuttings. Rooting ability decreased dramatically in the cooler, low-light winter seasons of lowland Hawaii. Etiolation treatments increased rooting ability significantly for two difficult-to-root hybrids. © Springer 2006.

AB  - Mimosine [α-amino-β-(3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridin-1-yl)- propanoic acid] is a major constituent of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala de Wit) and responsible for the strong allelopathic potential of the legume tree. Mimosine showed strong herbicidal activities on six plants in a bioassay. All plant parts of Leucaena contain mimosine. The quantity of mimosine in the young leaves and mature seeds was the greatest, 2.66 and 2.38% of dry weight, respectively, while the quantity in the root xylems and xylems was the lowest: 0.18 and 0.11% of dry weight, respectively. Younger plant parts of Leucaena contained greater amounts of mimosine than the mature parts. Mimosine released from young parts and the seeds of Leucaena was proportional to the quantity of soaking water. Compared with the mature seeds, other mature parts of the plant did not give any mimosine through exuding. In soil to which mimosine was added, about 60% of the mimosine was adsorbed in 1-5 days, and only a minor volume of mimosine was decomposed: 5.30 and 0.16% after 1 and 5 days, respectively. Using a mixture of FeCl3 and mimosine in a 4:6 ratio may be the most effective and economical method of lowering the toxicity of mimosine in Leucaena leaves, giving a safer cattle feed and decreasing the soil toxicity caused by mimosine in areas where Leucaena is grown. On the other hand, the incorporation of mimosine leaves into cultivated soils may be helpful for the biological control of weeds. The findings of this research reveal that mimosine may be useful for the development of bio-herbicides. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2006.

AB  - Feed value is the potential of the feed to supply the nutrients required by an animal both quantitatively and qualitatively in order to support a desired type of production. Where chemical composition and digestibility of a given feed is known it is possible to calculate its energy content by using appropriate regression equations. Eleven tropical grass species and mixed grass hay, seven legumes and browse trees, and six concentrates were evaluated in terms of chemical composition (CP, EE, OM, CHO and NDF), digestibility (in vitro organic matter digestibility -IVOMD and enzyme solubility of organic matter- EZOM) and calculated energy values. The grass species were: Andropogon timorensis (Kunth), Rev. Gram., Brachiaria brizantha, (A.Rich) Stapf, Bothriochloa radicans (Lehm) A. camus, Chloris guyana Kunth, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers, Hyparrhenia rufa (Nees) Stapf, Panicum maximum (Jacq.), Pannisetum purpureum (Schumacher), Setaria sphacelata Stapf & C. E. Hubb, and Tripsacum fasciculatum Trin. ex Aschers. Most of the grasses were cut at an advanced stage of growth. The legumes and browses included Acacia catechu (L. f.) Willd., Gliricidia septum (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Lannea grandis Lannea grandis Engl., Macroptilium atropurpureum (DC.) Urban, Sesbania grandiflora (L.) Poir and Zyziphus Mauritania (Lam.). The concentrates were: cotton seed cake, fishmeal, maize bran, soybean meal and sunflower cake. Mean CP and EE content (g/kg DM) were highest with the concentrates (310 and 97, respectively), followed by the legumes and browse trees (183 and 33, respectively) and lowest in the grasses (65 and 15, respectively). The OM and the CHO content varied least between the feed types. Mean NDF content (g/kg DM) was lower in the legumes/browse trees (378) and concentrates (314) compared to the grasses (698). The metabolic energy (ME) content (MJ/kg DM) in the feeds was highest with concentrate (11.9) and nearly of the same order in the grasses and legumes/browse trees (7.0). The organic matter digestibility using the conventional Tilley and Terry method and the enzymatic methods varied greatly among the feeds. The enzymatic method showed overall higher OM solubility values with some feeds compared to the in vitro organic matter digestibility method (overall mean of 63.4 Vs 53.2%). However, there was good agreement between the two methods with grasses (r2 = 0.80) compared to legumes/browse trees (r2 = 0.34) and concentrates (r2 = 0.22). It is concluded that with increasing modernisation of ruminant livestock production in the tropics, there is a need to evaluate locally available feed resources and place the data in feedstuff tables in order that producers can select the feeds for optimal productivity.

AB  - Chromium (Cr) is a heavy metal with risk to human health, and a contaminant found in agricultural soil and industrial sites. Phytoremediation, which relies on phytoextraction of Cr by biological organisms, is an important alternative to costly physical and chemical methods of treating contaminated sites. The ability of microorganisms like Rhizobium and arbuscular endomycorrhizal fungi (Glomus spp.) to enhance Cr uptake and plant tolerance was tested with the leguminous plant, Leucaena leucocephala, from southern Mexico and Guatemala, that grows in a wide diversity of soils. It is capable of surviving frosts. This study showed that the initial amount of Cr added to the soil in a pot decreased gradually. This tendency was similar at both concentrations evaluated (20 and 200 mg kg ?1). The pots were watered with a slight excess, thus creating the possibility of a lixiviation of the metal. However, this was rather small, so the decrease of the metals in the soil could be attributed mainly to the plant uptake. In this case the mycorrhizal fungi Glomus sp. Zac-19, and Glomus intraradices, as well as Rhizobium strains, helped to partially alleviate Cr toxicity as indicated by greater plant growth. A considerable Cr accumulation was shown in non-colonized plants with 200 mg·kg -1, total mycorrhizal colonization as well as its componentes, arbuscular, and vesicles were affected more than by 20 mg·kg -1 or 0 mg·kg -1 of Cr. In addition, the magnitude was reduced for N,P,K content, plant height, number of branches, stem diameter, number of leaves, number of leaflets, length of leaves, width of leaves, length of root, root volume, dry weight of roots, leaf area, dry weight of leaves, dry weight of stem, number of nodules, dry weight of nodules, total percentage of colonization (TC), and Cu and Cr contents in the leaf and stem. The results will help to design strategies for using Leucaena leucocephala associated with arbuscular endomycorrhiza and Rhizobium in bioremediation of Cr accumulation.

AB  - A study was undertaken to explore the phytotoxicity of volatile essential oil from Eucalyptus citriodora Hook. against some weeds viz. Bidens pilosa, Amaranthus viridis, Rumex nepalensis, and Leucaena leucocephala in order to assess its herbicidal activity. Dose-response studies conducted under laboratory conditions revealed that eucalypt oils (in concentration ranging from 0.0012 to 0.06 %) greatly suppress the germination and seedling height of test weeds. At 0.06 % eucalypt oil concentration, none of the seed of test weeds germinated. Among the weed species tested, A. viridis was found to be the most sensitive and its germination was completed inhibited even at 0.03%. Not only the germination and seedling growth, even the chlorophyll content and respiratory activity in leaves of emerged seedlings were severely affected. In A. viridis chlorophyll content and respiratory activity were reduced by over 51% and 71%, respectively, even at a very low concentration of 0.06%. These results indicated an adverse effect of eucalypt oils on the photosynthetic and energy metabolism of the test weeds. A strong negative correlation was observed between the observed effect and the concentration of eucalypt oil. Based on the study, it can be concluded that oil from E. citriodora possess strong inhibitory potential against weeds that could be exploited for weed management.

TI  - Effect of supplementation on performance of calves on smallholder dairy farms in Bahati division of Nakuru district, Kenya
PY  - 2006
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33746131235&doi=10.3923%2fpjn.2006.141.146&partnerID=40&md5=65263088c339286f4eeb19c8b3ac7bd0
AB  - Inadequate feeding and high disease prevalence are considered as the major setback to dairy production on smallholder farms in Kenya. Under such circumstances, heavy losses of young calves occur. This is the situation presently on these farms. The current study was conducted in Bahati division of Nakuru district over a period of 3 years. Out of 120 smallholder farmers randomly visited and interviewed, 60 of them were selected to participate in the trial, based on whether they have dairy cattle and willing to collaborate. The selected farmers were trained on data recording and provided with a heart-girth measuring tape, a spring balance (25 kg), a 10-litre plastic bucket (for feed weighing), a 1-litre graduated jug (for measuring milk) and a record book. They were then divided into two groups (Control and test) of 30 each. Control group was asked to continue with their ordinary calf management, where supplementation was not offered. Test farmers were asked to strictly follow the research calf-feeding schedule where Napier grass cv Bana was fed as a basal diet and supplemented with protein rich forages (Lucernne; Sweet potato vines cv Munsinya; Desmodium cv Green leaf and fodder shrubs (Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania sesban). Parameters of study were growth rate, mortality, morbidity and dynamics. The collected data was stored in MS-excel and later subjected to appropriate statistical models (SAS) to established the calf performance difference between the 2 farm groups and livestock production systems. The results showed that calves in test farms performed better (370 g/d) compared to those in control farms (307 g/d)(P<0.01). The study further revealed that calves supplemented with an assortment of protein rich forages showed a rapid body weight gain (375 and 417 g/d) compared to those offered SPV as a sole protein supplement (345 g/d) (P<0.05). It was further observed that the overall female calf mortality in zero grazing test farms was low (6%) compared to semi-zero and free grazing test farms (15 and 20%, respectively)(P<0.05). In the same farms mortality of male and female calves was different (P<0.05). Mortality for male calves was observed to be higher (Test-zero: Male - 13%; Female - 6%; Control-zero: Male - 11 % and Female 9%). The same trend was observed across the test and control farms in semi-zero and free grazing systems. On calf dynamics, off-take for male (33-78%) calves was observed to be much higher that for female calves (6-33%)(P<0.001). It was therefore concluded that protein supplementation, using farm grown forages improves performance of dairy calves on smallholder farms. The authors recommend that resource-poor farmers emphasize on cultivation of forage legumes so as to have sufficient protein rich diets for young dairy calves. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2006.

AB  - The valleys in Southwest China are hot and dry because of rain shadow effect. On their slopes, the main vegetation is savanna. Due to heavy human disturbance, the vegetation has been devastated or severely degraded, resulting in severe water and soil erosion. Some tree species such as Eucalypt, Acacia, and Leucaena have been introduced for revegetation and shown good growth during the past ten years, but little is known whether the insect community diversity is recovered along with the revegetation. This study investigated the species diversity of insect community collected from six different vegetation formations in Yuanmou dry and hot valley, including two natural (twitch-grass and aalii brushwood) and four artificial vegetations (pure Eucalyptus, Eucalyptus camaldulensis + Leucaena leuacocephala mixed forest, Acacia auriculaeformis + Leucaena leucocephala mixed forest, and Eucalyptus camaldalensis + Acacia auriculaeformis mixed forest). The results showed that vegetation component was the key factor affecting the species diversity of insect community. Mixed forestation was an effective forestation technology, which promoted insect community diversity and helped local insect settle down in degenerated place. By using principal component analysis, the six vegetation formations were divided into tow groups. The first group was eucalyptus pure plantation, with its environment unitary and wilder, and the second group was made up by the other five vegetation formations, with richer species diversity and higher moisture. The characteristics and quantities of the dominant and peculiar insects in different vegetation formations showed that among three mixed forests, Acacia auriculaeformis + Leucaena leucocephala mixed forest was the best afforestation model which could improve environment and increase insect species diversity, although some factors such as human activity slowed down the recovery of insect community diversity.

AB  - An experiment was undertaken to determine the effect of intercropping com (Zea mays) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) at the sowing time on the establishment of a silvopastoral system leucaena-guinea grass. A random block design was used with 5 replicates. The treatments were: A) leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru) and guinea grass (Panicum maximum cv Likoni) intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata cv Cubanita 666), B) leucaena and guinea grass intercopped with cultivated corn (Zea mays), C) leucaena and guinea grass intercropped with non-cultivated corn, two weeks after the sowing, and D) non-intercropped leucaena and guinea grass. The work was developed on a red ferralic soil. The sowing of leucaena and guinea grass was conducted in the rainy season. The former was sown in doble furrows 0.7 m apart and at 3 m of distance between them and at 0.50 m between plants. The grass was spread on the plot at a dosage of 0.5 kg/ha of PGS. The measurements were: population, plant height, yield of leucaena, guinea grass and the crops, as well as the presence of weeds. The leucaena population was affected when intercropped with the seasonal legume (P < 0.01). The leucaena yield was higher (P < 0.01) when intercropped with corn and there was cultivation. The poorest performance corresponded to the cowpea intercropping. The guinea grass yield was higher (P < 0.001) when intercropped with corn. The weeds prevailed when there was no intercropping. It is recommended to increase the silvopastoral systems leucaena-guinea grass using the intercropping with com. Besides, it is necessary to deepen into the research on the cowpea variety Cubanita 666 and further study other seasonal crops to diversify the use of this technique.

AB  - Opencast mining severely disturbs land in and around mining areas. The share of opencast mining is progressively increasing in India's coal production. The coal production from opencast mining progressively increased from 14Mt (20% of the total) at the time of coal mine nationalization in 1971-72 to 250Mt (70% of total) by 2000 A.D. All surface mining methods produce dramatic changes in the landscape due to large-scale excavation. It results in the formation of large overburden dumps and huge voids in the mining sites. The country has today thousand hectares of such barren land. Estimation revealed that a total of 1100 hectares of land is being covered by coal overburden dump and by 2000 A.D, 500Mm3 of overburden had been handled from coal mines only. The overburden dumps contains overlying soil and rock debris. Further in our country keeping soil layer separately is not in practice. OB Dumps are devoid of required essential plant nutrients, soil micro-flora and fauna. They are prone to leaching of heavy metals and silt erosion during runoff in rainy season. Tree plantation is being practiced and only tool for overburden bio-restoration as they have the ability to restore fertility, accelerates microclimatic conditions and with an economical benefits. During one bio-reclamation experimentation it has been noticed that the tree planted on overburden dump has more foliage content over soil and found 575%, 206.25%, 266.67% and 210% increase in Dalbergia sissoo, Acacia nilotica, Leucaena leucocephala and Azadirachta indica respectively. This implies that plant growth pattern has been changed due to the deviation of physico-chemical and biological characteristics of overburden dump material from normal soil. The increase in the foliage content of planted tree species on overburden dump over soil after two years indicates an alarming situation for timber species planted on overburden dump as the less height, more number of branching will reduce the economic value. In this paper the factor affecting the change in foliage content of planted species were briefly discussed. The remedial actions were being suggested through experience. Copyright © Enviromedia.

AB  - The objective of this research was to study toxic effects of alternative feeds for honeybees Apis mellifera. The average mortality time and the mortality index of cagged honeybees were assessed to evaluate any possible toxic effect of: (a) cassava hay (Manihot esculenta); (b) leucaena hay (Leucaena leococephala); (c) mesquite pod meal (Prosopis juliflora); (d) "bordão-de-velho" pod meal (Pithecellobium cf. saman); (e) babassu bran (Orbygnia martiana) and (f) succedaneous for calfskin from Purina® . The mortality time average varied from 4.46 to 11.74 and the mortality index varied between 4.58 and 12.80. It was obseved that honeybees fed with "bordão-de-velho" pod meal got involved by stichy layer of food and died asphyxiated. Results showed that the flour of Pithecellobium cf. saman should not be used for feeding honeybees, considering the early mortality of workers fed with this meal. The other food studied did not show any toxic effect.

AB  - We studied the ecological characteristics of 45-50-yr-old subtropical dry forest stands in Puerto Rico that were growing on sites that had been deforested and used intensively for up to 128 yr. The study took place in the Guánica Commonwealth Forest. Our objective was to assess the long-term effects of previous land use on this forest - i.e., its species composition, structure, and functioning. Previous land-use types included houses, farmlands, and charcoal pits. Stands with these land uses were compared with a nearby mature forest stand. The speed and path of forest recovery after deforestation and land-use abandonment depended on the conditions of the land. Study areas where land uses had removed the forest canopy and altered soil conditions (houses and farmlands) required a longer time to recover and had a different species composition than study areas where land uses retained a forest canopy (charcoal pits). Different forest attributes recovered at different rates. Crown area index, stem density, and litterfall rate recovered faster than stemwood and root, biomass, tree height, and basal area. Where previous land uses removed the canopy, Leucaena leucocephala, a naturalized alien pioneer species, dominated the regrowth. Native species dominated abandoned charcoal pits and mature forest. The change in species composition, including the invasion of alien species, appears to be the most significant long-term effect of human use and modification of the landscape. © 2006 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

AB  - In the present study, a 0.47 kb OMT gene construct from aspen, encoding for an enzyme O-methyltransferase (OMT, EC 2.1.1.6), in antisense orientation was used to down-regulate lignin biosynthesis in Leucaena leucocephala. The plants were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain harboring the antisense gene, and the transformation was confirmed by PCR amplification of the npt II gene. The integration of a heterologous antisense OMT gene construct in transformed plants led to a maximum of 60% reduction in OMT activity relative to control. The evaluation of total lignin content by the Klason method revealed a maximum of 28% reduction. Histochemical analyses of stem sections depicted a reduction in lignin content and normal xylem development. The results also suggested a probable increase in aldehyde levels and a decrease in syringyl units. Lignin down-regulation was accompanied by an increase in methanol soluble phenolics to an extent that had no impact on wood discoloration, and the plants displayed a normal phenotype. Concomitantly, an increase of up to 9% in cellulose content was also observed. Upon alkali extraction, modified lignin was more extractable as evident from reduced Klason lignin in saponified residue and increased alkali soluble phenolics. The results together suggested that the extent of down-regulation of OMT activity achieved may lead to quality amelioration of Leucaena with respect to its applicability in pulp and paper manufacture as well as nutritive and easily digestible forage production. © 2006 American Chemical Society and American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The economical possibility of using legumes in pastures for cattle fattening was assessed in the Institute of Animal Science (ICA) in the grazing of a) natural pasture with Leucaena leucocephala in 30 and 100% of the area and ground sugarcane-urea at 1% (three treatments), and b) star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) with leucaena in 100% of the area and the inclusion or not of rumen activator supplement (two treatments). The cost components were determined for each system considering the fixed and variable costs involved in the fattening and the economic indicators (cost/kg of liveweight, cost/$ invested, and the ratio benefit/cost) were calculated evaluating them statistically through simple classification models. The percent distribution of the direct expenses was analyzed, compared to the total expenses. The financial analysis included the calculation of the gross margin/ha and the economic profitability. The American dollar (USD) was used as monetary pattern. The beneficial effect of the use of leucaena on the feeding costs was proved by not surpassing 16% of the variables expenses in any of the systems and by the favorable performance of the economic indicators (P < 0.01), although lower for the system supplemented with rumen activator. The study of the financial indicators corroborated the economic possibilities of this legume, mainly in 100% of the area, with economic profitability higher than 50%, and disputed the viability of the use of the activator supplement in these conditions. The results indicate the economic feasibility of the use of Leucaena leucocephala in 100% of the grazing area in traditional growing-fattening systems with natural grasses or sugarcane-urea for the obtainment of liveweight gains between 600 and 800 g/d.

AB  - Dry season feeding has always posed a problem for ruminant nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. The availability of browse plants or multi-purpose trees during this period has led to their incorporation in the farming systems. The need therefore to investigate the feeding value and fermentation profiles of WAD sheep fed grass hay with supplemental Leucaena leucocephala formed the objective of this study. Eight 18-24 months old West African Dwarf (WAD) sheep (28.8 ± 4.2 kg body weight) were used in the study. Four of the sheep were fistulated ruminally and rumen pH, ammonia and volatile fatty acid were measured. Dried leaves of L. leucocephala were offered at two levels (25 and 50% of DMI, diets D25% and D50%, respectively) as supplement to a basal hay diet. The basal hay diet without supplement was the control diet. Diet D25% had a higher (p < 0.05) ruminal ammonia concentration than the control, while diet D50% had a higher (p < 0.05) total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration compared to both the control and D25% diets, respectively. Diet D25% had a marginal increase of 6.7% N- retention over the control diet. Organic matter digestibility (OMD) decreased (p < 0.05) with level of supplementation. Animals on D50%, D25% and the control diets lost 14, 7.3 and 5%, respectively, of retained energy leading to a negative energy balance. Overall results suggest that a 25% level of supplementation with leucaena gave the best outcome even though a range of 25-50% could be fed during periods of basal diet scarcity. © Springer 2006.

AB  - The objectives of this investigation were to isolate the rpoH2 gene encoding an alternative sigma factor from Sinorhizobium sp. BL3 and to determine its role in exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis, salt tolerance and symbiosis with Phaseolus lathyroides. The rpoH2 gene of Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 is known to be required for EPS synthesis and effective nodulation of Leucaena leucocephala. Three overlapping cosmid clones containing the rpoH2 gene of BL3 were isolated by complementing an rpoH2 mutant of TAL1145 for EPS production. From one of these cosmids, rpoH2 of BL3 was identified within a 3.0-kb fragment by subcloning and sequencing. The cloned rpoH2 gene of BL3 restored both EPS production and nodulation defects of the TAL1145 rpoH2 mutants. Three rpoH2 mutants of BL3 were constructed by transposon-insertion mutagenesis. These mutants of BL3 grew normally in complete or minimal medium and were not defective in EPS synthesis, nodulation and nitrogen fixation, but they failed to grow in salt stress conditions. The mutants complemented with cloned rpoH2 from either BL3 or TAL1145 showed higher levels of salt tolerance than BL3. The expression of rpoH2 in BL3 started increasing during the exponential phase and reached the highest level in the mid-stationary phase. These results indicate that RpoH2 is required for salt tolerance in Sinorhizobium sp. BL3, and it may have additional roles during the stationary phase. © 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of two types of on-pasture supplementation on slaughter characteristics, carcass traits and cut yield of pure-bred steers of the native Criollo Limonero dairy breed were studied. Thirty-six months old animals were randomly alloted to the following treatments during a 158-d fattening trial: T1 = a non-suplemented control group grazing Echinochloa polystachia grass; T2 = grazing plus 1 Kg/d/head of a concentrate to 11% CP, and T3 = grazing plus 1h/d of pruning an arboreal legume (Leucaena leucocephala). Analysis of variance-covariance by the least squares method indicated that none of the supplementation treatments (T2, T3) affected (P > 0.05) dressing percentage, carcass traits and cut yield. The only significant effect observed was the lesser proportion of white viscera (rumen and annexes) yielded in animals supplemented with Leucaena as compared to the control (7.98% vs. 7.07%). Other management and/or feeding strategies with high-energy diets need to be assessed to improve the carcass quality and cut yield performance of this tropically-adapted Bos taurus breed.

AB  - An experiment was carried out at El Guayabo-INIA Experimental Station, in Catatumbo municipality, Zulia state, in the western region of Venezuela, in a tropical humid forest; in order to evaluate in situ dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) degradability of Leucaena leucocephala and guinea grass (Panicum maximum). Incubation times were 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours, in a completely randomized design with a 2 x 6 factorial arrangement and three replications. The obtained results showed significative effects (P<0.05) of species on in situ degradability kinetics of DM. A greater initial (20.83%) and effective (49.53%) degradability was observed in leucaena, while, guinea grass showed the highest maximum degradability (58.68%). The lower degradation rate of DM (0.0389 h -1) was observed in guinea grass and potential degradability was not different between species. The highest CP percentage of initial (6.12%) and potential (52.10%) degradability was obtained in guinea grass, while, the degradation rate was lower (0.013 h-1) in leucaena. The maximum degradability of CP was the same for both species.

TI  - Subsoil nitrogen dynamics as affected by planted coppicing tree legume fallows in eastern Zambia
PY  - 2004
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3242659253&doi=10.1017%2fS0014479704001826&partnerID=40&md5=c05afb74e543fffbfdd7d627c24783bf
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is a major nutrient that limits crop production in southern Africa. We hypothesized that coppicing tree legumes, which are integrated in cropping systems, would intercept leaching nutrients and could also increase topsoil N in nutrient-depleted soils. This hypothesis was verified in three ongoing experiments at Msekera (experiments 1 and 2) and Kagoro (experiment 3) in Zambia. Planted tree fallows of Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia angustisma, and Sesbania sesban were compared with natural fallows and with continuous maize cropping with or without fertilizer (no-tree) controls. Top and subsoil samples were taken in the tree treatments and in the no-tree controls to establish short and long-term tree effects on soil N dynamics. 15N was introduced at various soil depths down to 2 m to determine the vertical root-reach of coppicing trees. Samples taken on two different dates showed that planted trees are capable of capturing subsoil N. The amounts retrieved by trees in experiment 2 did not vary with depth or dates except for A. angustisma which retrieved more N from the top 0.20 m than from the subsoil. L. leucocephala and G. sepium had similar characteristics in terms of coppice biomass production and N content, and both species rooted to at least 2 m. G. sepium in a mixture with S. sesban, retrieved more applied N than when planted alone, implying that mixed fallows may be effective in resource capture. There was more inorganic-N in the topsoil of coppiced fallows than in unfertilized maize plots. Subsoil N accumulation was evident under fertilized maize plots. There was less subsoil nitrate-N beneath planted trees than beneath mono-cropped maize plots indicating that trees probably retrieved subsoil N. Maize yields subsequent to coppicing tree fallows were at least 170 % higher than unfertilized controls indicating improved soil fertility status in the tree systems.

TI  - Senna siamea trees recycle Ca from a Ca-rich subsoil and increase the topsoil pH in agroforestry systems in the West African derived savanna zone
PY  - 2005
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21144435574&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-004-0599-3&partnerID=40&md5=c368e0629db99a3494812b4fd072fa2a
AB  - The functioning of trees as a safety-net for capturing nutrients leached beyond the reach of crop roots was evaluated by investigating changes in exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, and K) and pH in a wide range of medium to long term alley cropping trials in the derived savanna of West Africa, compared to no-tree control plots. Topsoil Ca content, effective cation exchange capacity, and pH were substantially higher under Senna siamea than under Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, or the no-tree control plots in sites with a Bt horizon rich in exchangeable Ca. This was shown to be largely related to the recovery of Ca from the subsoil under Senna trees. The increase of the Ca content of the topsoil under Senna relative to the no-tree control treatment was related to the total amount of dry matter applied since trial establishment. The lack of increase in Ca accumulation under the other species was related to potential recovery of Ca from the topsoil itself and/or substantial Ca leaching. The accumulation of Ca in the topsoil under Senna had a marked effect on the topsoil pH, the latter increasing significantly compared with the Leucaena, Gliridia, and no-tree control treatments. In conclusion, the current work shows that the functioning of the often hypothesized 'safety-net' of trees in a cropping system depends on (i) the tree species and on (ii) the presence of a subsoil of suitable quality, i.e., clay enriched and with high Ca saturation. © Springer 2005.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to study the mineral status of goats in relation to common tree leaves fed in Akola district, situated in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra state. Results indicated that the average serum mineral content in goats were calcium 9.64±0.24 mg/dl, phosphorus 4.34±0.21 mg/dl, sodium 143.27±1.43 mEq/litre, potassium 11.78±0.35 mEq/ litre, iron 117.06±4.30 μg/100 ml, copper 124.91±6.67μg/ 100ml, zinc 23.04±1.38μg/100 ml and manganese 84.29±2.95 μg/100 ml. The range of micro-and macro-elements in various tree leaves were for calcium 1.45±0.09 to 2.58±0.30%, phosphorus 0.12±0.01 to 0.21±0.03%, Sodium 0.12±0.003 to 0.23±0.03%, potassium 0.34±0.08 to 1.01±0.11%, iron 127.14±18.17 to 292.00±43.63 ppm, copper 106.25±15.85 to 220.00±21.79 ppm, zinc 15.00±2.89 to 55.71±13.25 ppm, and manganese 264.00±5.11 to 415.00±24.29 ppm. The total mineral contents in the soil were calcium 3.76±0.24, phosphorus 0.34±0.02, sodium 0.19±0.01, potassium 0.21±0.02% and iron 758.57±16.60, copper 282.14±17.66, zinc 89.28±10.78 and managanese 1298.21±37.44 ppm. It was concluded that the goats of Akola district were deficient in zinc and iron, suggesting the supplementation of mineral mixture and also to include the leaves of Acacia catechue, Tamarindus indica, and Leucaena leucocephala in goat feeding.

AB  - The area of forest plantations in the tropics worldwide is increasing as a response to the expansion of degraded lands. Rural farmers of many regions of the dry and humid areas are responding to government and other incentives, dedicating portions of their land to native and exotic tree plantations with varied uses and objectives. We evaluated the success of reforestation efforts in a dry region of Nicaragua and in a humid region of Costa Rica where reforestation has been promoted by the governments with local assistance of technical personnel and non-governmental organizations. In all farms, the survival, diameter at breast height (dbh), height, form, and health of the tree plantations were evaluated. In addition, information regarding the farmer's preferences and characteristics of the farms and the farmers was gathered through a survey including socioeconomic and silvicultural aspects. In both countries farmers used more native than exotic species for reforestation. Farmers are willing to continue reforesting as long as they continue to receive government incentives. In Costa Rica the plantations had better silvicultural management than in Nicaragua. In Nicaragua the species preferred by farmers for their growth were Azadirachta indica, Caesalpinia eriostachys, Eucalyptus spp., Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Tectona grandis. In Costa Rica the preferred species for their growth were Cordia alliodora, Gmelina arborea. Tenninalia amazonia, Tectona grandis, Vochysia guatemalensis, and Virola koschnyi. The implementation of incentive programs for reforestation was a key factor in encouraging the participation of small and medium farmers. © 2004 by The Haworth Press. Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A note on dehorning of river buffaloes as an alternative for decreasing the deterioration of live fences and trees
PY  - 2004

AB  - Twenty-nine female buffaloes with horns and 25 dehorned were used at seven days of age. Both groups were allocated in different grasslands with perimetral live fences and access to lead trees (Leucaena leucocephala) for comparing the effect of dehorning on the decrease of plant deterioration. A total of 208 plants was evaluated, out of which 131 were used as live fences in both grasslands (65 in the grassland with females buffaloes with horns and the rest in that of dehorned). At the beginning, the number of live fences and trees, the diameter of the stems at their base (at 15 cm of height, approximately) and the number of plants per species were measured. A year later, the effect of dehorning was assessed in these categories. Partial damages were those produced in any part of the stem that caused damages to the bark and not the death of the plant. Total damages were those that caused the death of the plants. An analysis of proportions of the damages caused to live fences and trees was made to compare the effects produced. A reduction (P < 0.001) of the level of both damages to live fences and the partial damages to the trees was observed, while the level of total damages to the trees was lower (P < 0.05) in the group of dehorned animals. In the group of animals with horns, 98.5 and 100 % of the live fences and trees were damaged, while, in that of dehorned animals, the damages were reduced to 4.1 and 1.9 %, respectively, and all were partial. Out of the lesions caused to live fences by the animals with horns, the highest proportion (57.3 %) provoked the death of the plants, but in the trees, most of damages (91 %) were partial. They were higher in 8.3 and 9.2 % in the live fences of Nicaraguan cocoashade (Gliricidia sepium), compared to West Indian birch (Bursera simaruba) and pito (Erythrina berteroana), respectively; while the total damages were higher in 4.2 and 8.3 percental units in West Indian birch and pito, compared to Nicaraguan cocoashade. The greatest damage provoked by the horns was observed in the plants with diameter lower than 7 cm. This caused the death of the plant in 100 % of the live fences and trees. Also, 16.7 % of the total damages in live fences were found with diameter in the stem from 7 to 10 cm. The rest of the partial damages occurred in the stems of greater diameter. It is concluded that the horns of the buffaloes seem to produce great deterioration in live fences and trees, mainly in those with stems of lower diameter. For reducing such damages, dehorning is suggested, as well as the use of these plants of diameter higher than 7 cm.

TI  - Biophysical potential for soil carbon sequestration in agricultural systems of the Old Peanut Basin of Senegal
PY  - 2004

AB  - Carbon sequestration in soil organic matter is increasingly advocated as a possible win-win strategy in the rehabilitation of degrading dryland agro-ecosystems because it simultaneously contributes to the reduction of global atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations while enhancing local land productivity. A study was conducted in Senegal's Old Peanut Basin to assess current carbon stocks and to examine management options for their increase. Average soil and woody biomass carbon contents were 11.3 and 6.3t carbon (C)ha-1, respectively. CENTURY, a biogeochemical model, was used to simulate soil and biomass carbon over a period of 25 and 50 years under a series of land use and management options. These simulated practices resulted in C dynamics ranging from -0.13t Cha-1yr-1 from a worst-case millet-sorghum rotation to +0.43tCha-1yr-1 on intensively managed agricultural fields. Agroforestry simulations involving Faidherbia albida (Del.) Chev. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) deWit. also resulted in promising carbon gain (+0.22 and +0.12tCha-1yr-1, respectively), suggesting that improving agricultural practices is key to enhancing food production and mitigating climate change. Results from a sensitivity analysis suggest that woody biomass carbon is more sensitive to long-term changes in precipitation and temperature than soil carbon. Other management strategies likely to result in lower rates of soil carbon sequestration, including short-term improved fallows, should also be considered viable opportunities because promoting too narrow a set of 'best management practices' risks weakening local adaptability and opportunistic management regimes, both of which are crucial elements in small-scale farming systems in drylands. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To examine the effect of biological invasion by early-successional exotic plant species on the secondary succession of native plant species, we compared secondary forests with and without koa haole invasion, which became established in fields that were abandoned for 55 yr on Chichijima and Haha-jima in the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, in the northwestern Pacific. A comparison of the forest structure and the composition of secondary forest showed that the species richness of native plant species was significantly lower, and the basal area of late-successional alien plants (bischofia and Korean mulberry) was significantly larger in secondary forests with koa haole invasion than in those without koa haole invasion. The secondary forests in areas that had been invaded by koa haole had a significantly smaller basal area of native plant species and a greater area of latesuccessional alien plants in the understory than those in areas that had not been invaded by koa haole. These results suggest that in the Ogasawara Islands, the native species are incapable of replacing dense koa haole thickets directly and that invasion by koa haole promotes invasion and establishment of more aggressive alien plant species. Consequently, the invasion and expansion of koa haole has had a severe effect on the native plant community in the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands and may alter the secondary succession.

TI  - Symbiotic phenotypes and translocated effector proteins of the Mesorhizobium loti strain R7A VirB/D4 type IV secretion system
PY  - 2004
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-6344241828&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2958.2004.04292.x&partnerID=40&md5=e4a8271988fcd0100564dae76069ecb3
AB  - The symbiosis island of Mesorhizobium loti strain R7A contains genes with strong similarity to the structural vir genes (virB1-11; virD4) of Agrobacterium tumefaciens that encode the type IV secretion system (T4SS) required for T-DNA transfer to plants. In contrast, M. loti strain MAFF303099 lacks these genes but contains genes not present in strain R7A that encode a type III secretion system (T3SS). Here we show by hybridization analysis that most M. loti strains contain the VirB/D4 T4SS and not the T3SS. Strikingly, strain R7A vir gene mutants formed large nodules containing bacteroids on Leucaena leucocephala in contrast to the wild-type strain that formed only uninfected tumour-like structures. A rhcJ T3SS mutant of strain MAFF303099 also nodulated L leucocephala, unlike the wild type. On Lotus corniculatus, the vir mutants were delayed in nodulation and were less competitive compared with the wild type. Two strain R7A genes, msi059 and msi061, were identified through their mutant phenotypes as possibly encoding translocated effector proteins. Both Msi059 and Msi061 were translocated through the A. tumefaciens VirB/D4 system into Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana, as shown using the Cre recombinase Reporter Assay for Translocation (CRAfT). Taken together, these results suggest that the VirB/D4 T4SS of M. loti R7A plays an analogous symbiotic role to that of T3SS found in other rhizobia. The heterologous translocation of rhizobial proteins by the Agrobacterium VirB/D4 T4SS is the first demonstration that rhizobial effector proteins are translocated into plant cells and confirms functional conservation between the M. loti and A. tumefaciens T4SS.

AB  - Growth rates and survival of a range of 77 accessions of 21 species plus 2 hybrids from the Oxford Forestry Institute Leucaena germplasm collection were examined in Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Treatments were established in October 1996. Growth rate was determined in 2 experimental periods, before and after the 1997 winter. Observations on survival were performed in 2001, 5 years after field establishment of the collection. Mean growth rates of all accessions were 2.65 cm/week in the first and 5.53 cm/week in the second experimental period. From the original 77 accessions established, 56 survived, the percentage of surviving plants per accession ranging from 6-100%. Accessions with the best growth rate over the 2 periods were: L. hybrid 52/87, L. trichandra 4/91, 140/92, 3/91, 138/92, 128/92, 35/88, L. pallida 79/92, L. diversifolia 83/92, 126/92, 45/87, 104/94, 105/94, 46/87, 1/90, L. pulverulenta 22/86 and L. leucocephala ssp. leucocephala 133/92. All accessions were small leaflet types and, with few exceptions, had high survival rates. These accessions warrant further evaluation in southern Brazil for other attributes such as forage yield and nutritive value, before being extensively used for animal feeding.

AB  - The guaB mutant strain Rhizobium tropici CIAT8999-10T is defective in symbiosis with common bean, forming nodules that lack rhizobial content. In order to investigate the timing of the guaB requirement during the nodule formation on the host common bean by the strain CIAT899-10.T, we constructed gene fusions in which the guaB gene is expressed under the control of the symbiotic promoters nodA, bacA, and nifH. Our data indicated that the guaB is required from the early stages of nodulation because full recovery of the wild-type phenotype was accomplished by the nodA-guaB fusion. In addition, we have constructed a guaB mutant derived from Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021, and shown that, unlike R. tropici, the guaB S. meliloti mutant is auxotrophic for guanine and induces wild-type nodules on alfalfa and Medicago truncatula. The guaB R. tropici mutant also is defective in its symbiosis with Macroptilium atropurpureum and Vigna unguiculata but normal with Leucaena leucocephala. These results show that the requirement of the rhizobial guaB for symbiosis is found to be associated with host plants that form determinate type of nodules. © 2005 The American Phytopathological Society.

AB  - An experiment was conducted in areas of the Institute of Animal Science located in San José municipality, Havana province to evaluate the effect of some agrophysical, biological and productive indicators in two systems based on Guinea likoni. Both systems are located in red ferralitic soils and had the same exploitation time with the difference that the one with leucaena allowed the rehabilitation of guinea. Two representative paddocks, in which a trial pit was opened, were chosen in each one of them. Two samples were taken in the trial pit at depths from 0 to 15 cm, from 16 to 30 cm and more than 30 cm, in which the macrostructure and the soil texture were determined. Also, the botanical composition, the availability of biomass, the density and the frequency of appearance of the species were determined, as well as the macrofauna and the biological diversity of the soil fauna. The analysis of the data of the agrophysical indicators of the soil was performed according to random block design. For the soil mesofauna and the biomass availability, a completely randomized design with two replications was used. The results showed that in both systems the frequency of appearance of guinea grass is of 100 %, the density was higher in the system with leucaena (86 %) compared to that with only guinea grass (56 %). The botanical composition showed that the area with leucaena has greater presence of guinea likoni (95.5 %). The guinea grass rangeland has a higher diversity of plant species due to the presence of weeds. The system with leucaena had higher biomass production (2.24 t/ha).The soil macrostructure did not show significant differences between the systems and the particles with more than 5 mm of diameter predominated. The sampling depths evidenced significant differences in the size of the aggregates, which decreased according to the depth. The soil texture did not show differences between the systems and all the soils were classified as clayish. The soil fauna diversity was higher in the area with leucaena. It is concluded that the use of L. leucocephala seems to favour the biomass production, the development of the guinea likoni as basic pasture, besides regulating apparently the presence of weeds in the rangeland. It does not seem to affect the performance of the soil macrostructure and texture. The system with leucaena had an increase of the soil fauna diversity and the total of individuals per surface unit. Further studies in time are recommended to monitor the performance of these systems.

AB  - Nine isonitrogenous (35% crude protein approximately) and isocaloric (18. 37 kj g-1) experimental diets (RLL20-BCFL40) were formulated with either raw or treated (inoculated with fish intestinal bacteria) Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal at 20%, 30% and 40% levels replacing other ingredients partially from a fish meal based reference diet (RD). Two specific strains of fish intestinal bacteria, Bacillus subtilis (isolated from Cyprinus carpio) and B. circulans (isolated from Oreochromis mossambicus) having extracellular cellulolytic and amylolytic activities, were used to inoculate Leucaena leaf meal for 15 days at 37°C. The crude fibre, cellulose and hemicellulose contents and the antinutritional factors, tannin, phytic acid and mimosine in the leaf meal decreased due to inoculation. However, free amino acids and fatty acids increased in the treated leaf meal. The response of rohu, Labeo rohita, fingerlings fed the experimental diets for 80 days was compared with fish fed a RD. Both the inclusion level and type of Leucaena leaf meal in diets significantly affected the growth performance of rohu. Fish fed diets containing inoculated Leucaena leaf meal performed better in comparison with those with the RD. On the basis of growth response, feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio and apparent net protein utilization, diet formulated with 30% Leucaena leaf meal inoculated with B. circulans resulted in the best performance of rohu fingerlings followed by diet with 40% B. subtilis inoculated Leucaena leaf meal. The apparent protein digestibility (APD) was better in fish fed diets containing B. circulans inoculated leaf meal. An increasing level of raw Leucaena leaf meal was associated with a decrease in the carcass protein content of rohu fingerlings. The activity of α-amylase increased with the increasing level of treated leaf meal in diets. Cellulase activity increased with increasing level of inclusion of raw leaf meal, and was comparatively lower in fish fed diets with treated leaf meal. Activities of protease and lipase were higher in fish fed the RD. The results showed that it is possible to incorporate Leucaena leaf meal inoculated with enzyme-producing fish intestinal bacteria in carp diets up to 40% level of inclusion.

AB  - The pollination syndrome and breeding system of four reforestation tree species in Mt. Makiling, Laguna Province in Southern Luzon, Philippines, namely; Acacia auriculiformis Cunn. ex Benth. (auri), Vitex parviflora Juss. (molave), Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wlt (ipil-ipil, El Salvador Strain) and Pterocarpus indicus Willd.1 (narra) were investigated. Floral buds were enclosed with pollination bags and nets to exclude insect visitors/ pollinators of each species, with a corresponding number of buds tagged and left open to serve as control. The inflorescence of L. leucocephala was enclosed with paper packets to exclude floral visitors and wind-borne pollen grains. Results of the pollination bag experiments suggested that A. auriculiformis, V. parviflora and P. indicus were out crossing and entomophilous. Important pollinators of the species were medium- to large-sized bees. Floral morphology exhibited the bee floral syndrome. leucaena leucocephala is self-compatible and shows floral characteristics for anemophily. The rest of the species studied is self-incompatible and dichogamous.

AB  - The urea ammoniation (5.0% dry matter) effects in Brachiaria brizantu hay baled with two moisture contents (15 or 30% moisture), and three urease source (Brachiaria decumbent hay, elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum), leucena (Leucaena leucocephala)) was evaluated. The crude protein (CP), soluble nitrogen fraction (A), borate phosphate true protein fractions (B1 and B2), potentially degradable protein fraction (B3), acid detergent insoluble protein (C) were analyzed. The NDF, ADF, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) were analyzed. The experiment was conducted according to a completely randomized block design with 10 treatments (two control, 15 and 30% moisture, without urea and urease; two controls, 15 and 30% moisture, with urea and urease; six combinations of urease source and moisture levels), with three replicates. Ammoniation increased CP, and A fractions of the hays baled with different moisture contents associated to urease source; however urea application did not affect the B1, and B2 values. The B3 and C values decreased due to the urea application. The ammoniation of the high moisture hay (30%), associated or not to urease source reduced NDF. External urease source did not affect the cell wall contents of the brachiaria hay, compared to the urea treatment without external urease. Ammoniation with urea had a unconsistent effect on the ADF, and cellulose contents of the hay. The treatment did not affect the lignin content of the hay. The urea application with 15 or 30% moisture increased soluble nitrogen of Brachiaria brizantha hay and decreased the unavailable nitrogen to the ruminant.

AB  - Few P and K fertility studies have been conducted on Haitian soils. Alley cropping is promoted in Haiti but has not been studied in relation to P and K fertility. The effects of P and K fertilizer and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) De Witt) pruning mulch applications on corn (Zea mays L.) were assessed in field experiments on Rhodudalfs over limestone at Salagnac, Lithic Hapludolls over limestone at Bergeau and Typic Hapludalfs over basalt at St. Georges, Haiti. Complete block designs arranged in incomplete factorials of P and K rates were carried out during three seasons. Additional treatments consisted of 30 Mg ha-1 of leucaena prunings applied with and without 60 kg P and 40 kg K ha-1. Grain yield and net income were analyzed and a surface response curve was fitted on treatments without pruning applications. The soils differed markedly in response to P and K with significant PXK interactions. Without leucaena prunings, response surface analysis predicted maximum yields with applications of 95-117 kg P ha-1 and 51-72 kg K ha-1 and maximum net returns with applications of 0.22-89 kg P ha-1 and 43-79 kg K ha-1. Leucaena pruning applications increased yield at all sites. Highest net income was obtained at Salagnac and St. Georges with leucaena prunings applied with P and K, at Bergeau with prunings applied without P and K, suggesting that alley cropping with judicial fertilizer use is a good economic alternative for low resource farmers. Soil parent material and mineralogy should be considered in making fertilizer recommendations. © Springer 2005.

AB  - Seed germination, root, shoot, seedling length and seedling dry weights of Leucaena leucocephala were reduced in most of the treatments of lead and cadmium individually and in combination. The intensity of effects of lead and cadmium on the growth of Leucaena leucocephala was different at different levels and combination of treatment. In root length, the highest reduction was found at 300 ppm of lead, while in shoot and seedling length, the highest reduction was recorded at 300 ppm Pb + 300 ppm. Cd 100 ppm of lead treatment also showed reduction in seedling dry weight more than any of the other treatments. The investigation showed that 300 ppm Cd in combination with 300 ppm Pb showed comparatively adverse effects on seedling growth of Leucaena leucocephala. At the same combination of lead and cadmium, the lowest tolerance was observed in Leucaena leucocephala.

AB  - Information is lacking on the potential of leguminous fodder trees such as Leucaena leucocephala as a feed resource to supplement the native forages in traditional grazing management systems in the tropics. Two studies were conducted (1) to assess traditional fodder banks' forage nutritive potential on animal production, and (2) to investigate the effect of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM) supplementation on growth of steers grazing standing hay basal forages in the dry season. The traditional forages had low nutritive values indicated by low mean crude protein (CP) of 23 g kg-1 dry matter (DM), and high fibre contents of 717, 546 and 153 g kg-1 DM for neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL), respectively. The forages were poorly degraded in sacco and had low metabolisable energy (ME) (4.2-4.6 MJ kg-1 DM). Mean washing losses A, slowly degradable DM fraction, B, potential degradability, (A+B) and mean 48 h DM degradability (DMD) of grazing land forages were 70, 471, 541 and 326 g kg-1 DM, respectively. In the supplementation study, 16 growing steers (160.8±0.24 kg) were randomly allocated into four groups, in a completely randomized design. Four LLM treatment diets (T1, T2, T3 and T4), with four levels: 0, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 kg DM for control, low, medium and high LLM levels, respectively, were randomly allocated to the animals in the four groups for 70 days (d). LLM supplementation (p<0.05) improved mean weight gain from -0.30 to 0.26 kg steer-1 d-1, for T1 and T4, respectively. Steers on T4 gained (p<0.05) more weight compared to the animals in T1 and T2, though there was no (p>0.05) difference in weight gains between animals on T3 and T4 (0.14 vs. 0.26 kg steer-1 d-1, respectively). Standing hay basal forages alone could not sustain animal productivity during dry seasons unless corrected for protein. Higher levels of LLM supplementation prevented weight losses and improved the performance of grazing steers, a management practice thought appropriate to low income pastoralists in semiarid western Tanzania. © Springer 2005.

AB  - The annual production of leaf litter and its contribution of N, P and K were determined in two grasslands of 50 ha. The grasslands were divided in 24 paddocks each and they were different in species composition. In both, dairy cows grazed with a stocking rate of 2.0 LAU/ha. The first grassland was composed of 30 % Cynodon nlemfuensis cv Jamaicano, 30 % Pennisetum purpureum clone CT-115, 15 % Panicum maximum cv Likoni, 10 % Paspalum notatum, 5 % Dichantium annulatum, 5 % Cynodon Sp. and 5 % Neonotonia wightii. The composition in the second grassland was 55 % Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru/Panicum maximum cv Likoni, 10 % Albizia lebbeck/Cynodon nlemfuensis, 10 % Cajanus cajan/Cynodon nlemfuensis, 15 % Panicum maximum cv Likoni and 10 % Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru/Cynodon nlemfuensis. The total leaf litter production was higher in the second grassland (216.2 vs 124.4 t of DM). The areas with Leucaena leucocephala/Panicum maximum, Cajanus cajanlCynodon nlemfuensis and Leucaena leucocephala/ Cynodon nlemfuensis were outstanding and they contributed with 63, 14 and 12 % of the total leaf litter, respectively. Likewise, the leaf litter in the second grassland provided more N (41.9 vs 27.6 kg/ha), P (11.0 vs 4.5 kg/ha) and K (26.0 vs 9.7 kg/ha) than that of the first grassland that had no trees. The results corroborated that it is convenient to introduce shrub and tree species in grasslands composed, mainly, of grasses for increasing leaf litter production and make more efficient the biogeochemical cycle of nutrients.

AB  - The leguminous tropical multipurpose tree Acacia angustissima is a potential source of protein for ruminants fed roughage diets. Proximate analysis and in vitro techniques were used to evaluate the nutritive value of 15 accessions of A. angustissima in comparison with the tanniniferous legumes (Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala) and lucerne (Medicago sativa). Freeze- and oven-dried (50°C) leaf samples were used and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was added to some in vitro fermentations (5 mg PEG/50 mg plant substrate) to assess the effects of tannins on digestion of dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N). The acacia accessions were also screened for secondary compounds that could effect the nutritive value of the plant. Average NDF and ADF content did not differ markedly between A. angustissima accessions (417 and 189 g/kg), L. leucocephala (447 and 178 g/kg), C. calothyrsus (416 and 205 g/kg) and lucerne (399 and 168 g/kg). Average N content of A. angustissima (38 g/kg) and C. calothyrsus (36 g/kg) were similar but tended to be lower than L. leucocephala (43 g/kg) and lucerne (50 g/kg). Oven drying at 50°C compared with freeze drying did not significantly effect fermentation characteristics of NH3, branched chain (BCVFA) and short chain volatile fatty acid (SCVFA) production in the plants. There was a two-fold difference in SCVFA production amongst acacia accessions without PEG while variation in NH 3 and BCVFA production was small due to negligible production or a net consumption of these metabolites during fermentation. Inclusion of PEG in fermentations of A. angustissima resulted in a marked and significant increase in DM digestibility and production of SCVFA (2-4.4-fold increase), NH 3 (>4-fold increase) and BCVFA (>10-fold increase). All acacia accessions had a high free condensed tannin content which ranged from 98 to 180 g/kg and only minor amounts of tannin were in a bound form (<2 g/kg). Dimethyltryptamine and N-methyltyramine alkaloids were present in the acacia accessions in very small quantities (1.1-10.2 ppm). Several non-protein amino acids were detected in all accessions of A. angustissima in the following order of concentration: γ-acetyldiaminobutyric acid > oxalylalbizziin > α-acetyldiaminobutyric acid > albizziin > oxalyldiaminobutyric acid and oxalyldiaminopropionic acid. The main non-protein amino acid was γ-acetyldiaminobutyric acid which ranged in concentration from 181 to 293 g/kg DM. In conclusion, in vitro digestibility was low for all acacia accession due to the presence of tannins. These accessions all contained significant amounts of non-protein amino acids that need to be evaluated further for potential toxicity. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An alley cropping plot was established in 1990 on a degraded alfisol on sloping land at Ajibode village near the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. The influence of Glomus deserticolum on biomass production of three hedgerow trees i.e., Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Senna siamea, and their nutrient contribution to cassava Manihol esculenta in four consecutive cropping seasons were investigated. Inoculation only promoted hedgerow leaf-biomass and nutrient (N, P, and K). contribution to cassava and consequently cassava tuber yield in the second year but did not affect them afterwards despite increased AM infection. Tuber yield declined with succeeding cropping seasons in all plots except uninoculated plots with Senna where it showed 142% and 11.5% increases respectively at 2 and 3-months pruning regime when compared with the first year's yield. Biomass production increased marginally with age in all hedgerows with concomitant increase in leaf production depending on partitioning of assimilates between leaf and stem. Generally, hedgerow biomass diversion to leaf was higher at 2 than at 3-month pruning regime and was in the order Senna Gliricidia Leucaena. Hence, while Senna provides sustained adequate leaf mulch to cassava, pruning at quarterly interval during the first pruning year and at bimonthly intervals in subsequent years is also recommended. © Springer 2005.

AB  - We initiated a study of the effects of mycorrhizal fungal community composition on the restoration of tropical dry seasonal forest trees. Tree seedlings were planted in a severely burned experimental site (1995 fire) during the growing season of 1998 at the El Edén Ecological Reserve, in north Quintana Roo, Mexico. Seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala, Guazuma ulmifolia, Caesalpinia violacea, Piscidia piscipula, Gliricidia sepium, and Cochlospermum vitifolium were germinated in steam-sterilized soil and either remained uninoculated (nonmycorrhizal at transplanting) or were inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi in soils from early-seral (recently burned) or late-seral (mature forest) inoculum. Inoculum from the early-seral soil was largely Glomus spp., whereas a diverse community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were reintroduced from the mature forest including species of Scutellospora, Gigaspora, Glomus, Sclerocystis, and Acaulospora. Plants grew better when associated with the mature forest inoculum, unlike a previous experiment in which plants grew taller with the early-seral inoculum. Reasons for the different responses include a less-intense burn resulting in more residual organic matter. In addition to mycorrhizal responses, plants were severely affected by deer browsing. One tree species, C. vitifolium found in the region but not in the reserve, was eliminated by a resident fungal facultative pathogen. Several practical conclusions for restoration can be made. The common nursery practice of soil sterilization may be detrimental because it eliminates beneficial mycorrhizal fungi; species not native to the site may not survive because they may not be adapted to the local pathogens; and herbivory can be severe depending on the landscape context of the restoration. © 2005 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - Water repellency of volcanic ash soils from the Ecuadorian páramo was studied by a combination of extraction and analysis of water-repellent products, Molarity Ethanol Droplet values, water contact-angle measurements by capillary rise, and N2 adsorption isotherms. The undried samples studied are hydrophilic, but exhibit water repellency after moderate drying (48 hours at 30°C). The advancing water contact-angle measured by capillary rise varies from 78° to 89°. These water contact-angles decrease strongly after extraction of organic materials by an isopropanol-water mixture. Elemental analysis, infrared spectra and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were used to characterize the extracts. The results show that long-chain fatty acids and more complex non-polar alkyl components (waxes) are the main water-repellent materials. The deposition of such extracted materials onto hydrophilic sand leads to the rapid increase of water contact-angle until values close to those measured on the soil samples are achieved. Assuming a coating of the mineral surface by organic hydrophobic products and using Cassie's law, the water contact-angle of extracted materials was computed. The values ranged from 100° to 157°. Nitrogen specific surface areas of the soils studied were very small, indicating a low adsorbent-adsorbate interaction on hydrophobic surfaces. These results partially validate the hypothesis of water-repellent materials that occur as coatings at least after a drying process.

AB  - Knowledge of magnitude and timing of weed seedling flushes is crucial in managing weeds adequately. Such knowledge is especially important for small-scale farmers in West Africa who spend a greater percentage of family labour in controlling weeds. This study assessed the composition, pattern and magnitude of seedling emergence of weed communities of a maize/cassava association in three types of fallow and four landuse intensities (continuous cropping or zero-fallow, 1 year of cropping followed by 1, 2, and 3 years fallow) over a 6-year period in Ibadan, Nigeria, West Africa. The study was carried out on a sandy loam (oxic paleustaff and psammentic ustorthent), <2% organic matter, and pH 6.2. Rainfall pattern at the study site is bimodal with average annual precipitation of 1250 mm. Weed seedling composition in the bush fallow treatment differed with year (e.g. seedling composition increased from 30 species in 1990 to 41 species in 1995) and was different from Leucaena leucocephala and Pueraria phaseoloides fallow treatments where volunteer seedlings of the respective fallow types were also present. At the initiation of the study, 1990, the seedling community was dominated by perennial weeds (60%). After 6 years, 84% of the weed seedlings were broadleaf (53% annuals and 31% perennials). Weed seedling emergence differed with type of fallow, landuse intensity and year (P<0.01). Weed seedlings emerged throughout the sampling period of 3-15 weeks after planting (WAP) crops. The highest number of weed seedlings emerged early in the season (3-5 WAP) followed by a second but smaller peak flush at 8-9 WAP and a decline over the rest of the sampling period in all types of fallow, landuse intensity, and years except in 1994. Natural bush and L. leucocephala fallow had more weed seedlings than P. phaseoloides fallow in all years except 1993 and 1995. Continuously cropped plots and plots cropped every other year had more emerged weed seedlings than plots that were cropped once followed by 2-3 years of uncropped fallow. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The value of the tropical browse legumes Acacia cornigera (ACA), Albizia lebbekoides (ALB), Enterolobium cyclocarpum (ENT) and Leucaena leucocephala (LEU) as ruminal N sources was examined. The N content (g/kg dry matter) was 38.0, 28.6, 35.1 and 46.7, and acid detergent insoluble N (ADIN; g/kg dry matter) was 9.0, 10.7, 18.7 and 19.8 for ACA, ALB, ENT and LEU, respectively. In vitro gas production at 24 h ranked ACA > ENT > LEU > ALB (P < 0.001), except that there were no differences between ENT and LEU after 12 h of incubation. The N degradability was estimated by the in vitro relationship between gas production and ammonia N concentration (NDg), N disappearance from incubation residue (NDd), and incubation with Streptomyces griseus enzymes (NDe). To determine NDg, legume samples (601 ± 0.54 mg) were incubated with 0 mg (n = 3), 150 mg (n = 2) or 300 mg (n = 2) starch for 24 h in two experiments. Regression of ammonia (y, mg) on gas produced (x, ml) for each browse in each experiment (n = 7) yielded r2 coefficients between 0.974 and 0.997. Average estimated NDg were 0.32, 0.22, 0.63 and 0.22 for ACA, ALB, ENT and LEU, whereas NDd had N digestion coefficients of 0.40, 0.17, 0.70 and 0.36, and NDe 0.41, 0.24, 0.44 and 0.36, respectively. NDg was lower than NDd and NDe for LEU, but higher than NDe for ENT (P < 0.05). However, methods correlation ranged from 0.73 to 0.92. In vitro estimated N digestion suggested that 0.52, 0.17, 0.30 and 0.41 of undegraded N from ACA, ALB, ENT and LEU was intestinally digestible. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Goats require protein supplementation while grazing bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) during summer in Florida. We measured weight gains of Boer x Spanish goats (6-7 mo old) in July-November, 2003 (140 d) while grazing leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] with bahiagrass (LEUC), compared with grazing bahiagrass alone (CON), or bahiagrass with soybean (Glycine max L.) meal fed at 50% of dairy protein requirement (SBM). All goats received one-third of their daily energy requirement. Goats were continuously stocked on SBM and CON at 22 goats ha-1, Goats on LEUC were inoculated with mimosine-detoxifying microbes (Synergistes jonesii), were stocked at 11 goats ha-1, and were rotated every 28 d between two paddocks. Average daily gains were positive on LEUC in each of the five, 28-d weigh periods, but nil or negative in SBM and CON on two occasions in October and November. Over 140 d of grazing, goats on LEUC grew faster (P = 0.0016) at 59 g d-1 and gained 8.3 kg head-1 than those on SBM and CON with 31 and 23 g d-1, and 4.3 and 3.3 kg head-1, respectively. Total liveweight gains per unit of land were similar (P = 0.2532) among the treatments, and averaged 94, 97, and 74 kg ha-1 for LEUC, SBM, and CON, respectively. Leucaena results in greater individual weight gains for meat goats grazing bahiagrass in the summer than feeding a supplement that provides 50% of daily protein requirement.

TI  - Do all tannins have similar nutritional effects? A comparison of three Brazilian fodder legumes
PY  - 2004

AB  - Three tropical legumes, namely Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania sesban and Cajanus cajan, were subjected to chemical analysis plus in vitro, in situ and in vivo evaluations. Three different assays were used to determine total tannins: adsorption to polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVPP-tannins), radial diffusion (RD-tannins) and protein precipitation capacity (BSA-tannins). Total phenols, total tannins and condensed tannins were highest for Sesbania. RD-tannins were correlated with total phenols (r 2 = 0.93), PVPP-tannins (r 2 = 0.92) and condensed tannins (r 2 = 0.99). The protein precipitation capacity of Sesbania, Leucaena and Cajanus were 25.9, 6.13 and 4.05 μg BSA/g DM, respectively.Gas production at 24 h was negatively correlated with total phenols (r 2 = 0.99), PVPP-tannins (r 2 = 0.99) and condensed tannins (r 2 = 0.91). The RD-, PVPP-tannins and the response to polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the gas production assay appeared to be useful as a first screen for tannins.In situ degradability did not reflect any adverse effects of tannins. However, in vivo experiments showed that the apparent DM digestibility of Sesbania and Leucaena was lower than the basal diet. The apparent protein digestibility was lower for all legumes compared to the basal diet. Most treatments caused a negative nitrogen balance. The problems associated with browse feeding were not only related to tannin contents, other factors such as inherently poor digestibility and low energy intake may also have lead to the poor animal performance on these diets. We propose, given the limitations of current tannin assays, that it is not possible to predict beneficial or harmful nutritional effects from total tannin concentrations per se. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Eco-restoration of degreded lands through watershed development
PY  - 2004
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-60049100779&partnerID=40&md5=ed2cca7bfcad639ed734f950dc4011da
AB  - This paper describes the development and eco-restoration efforts in 72 ha of Rammadhi watershed, at IGFRI, Jhansi, (Uttar Pradesh), as an example of productive utilization of non-arable degraded lands. The non-arable land of the watershed was highly degraded and unproductive. The problems of the site related to overall bio-hydro-geomorphological deterioration for many decades, besides the need for forage, fuel and food production. The basic soil and water conservation techniques were adopted to prevent the run-off and soil loss to assist proper utilization of rainwater in the watershed. A corrective plan based on a combination of engineering and vegetative measures was implemented. Earthen bunds were laid out (8 km) at different slope gradients and were seeded with guinea grass (Panicum maximum) on the outer side and stylo (Sylosanthes hamata) on the inner side. Contour trenches were dug out and planted with stylo. The other measures included construction of a check dam and two water ponds followed by planting on mounds with Brachiaria and tree species. Five vegetation interventions (T1-Silvipasture; T2-Legume introduction; T3-lmproved pasture; T4-Cultivated pasture; T5-Control) were imposed. The response of the watershed to restoration techniques was monitored. A total of 81 constituent species were recorded at Rammadhi watershed. These included 22 grasses, 14 legumes and 16-forbs. In control (T5) Heteropogon-Dichanthium community was predominant with Heteropogon contortus as dominant (IVI-76. 1) and Dichanthium annulatum as co-dominant species (IVI-61.8). Among five woody species viz., Hardwickia binata, Acacia nilotica, Ficus glomerata, Grewia optiva and Leucaena leucocephala planted, Acacia nilotica performed better (74.5% with average height 94.5 ± 23.8 cm and average diameter 0.58±0.16 cm). The regeneration prospects of the introduced components (cultivated forage crops, improved grasses, legumes and trees) were quite encouraging. The quantification of biomass in different treatments indicated significant improvement in introduced pasture treatments as compared to control (T5). Yield increase of 36-70% was obtained due to the introduction of different components in natural degraded pastures right in the first year itself. The potential of watershed-based rehabilitation technologies for restoration of such degraded systems is discussed. © International Scientific Publications, New Delhi.

AB  - The elemental composition of residues of maize (Zea mays), sorghum (S. bicolor), groundnuts (Arachis hypogea), soya beans (Glycine max), leucaena (L. leucocephala), gliricidia (G. sepium), and sesbania (S. sesban) was determined as a basis for examining their alkalinity when incorporated into an acidic Zambian Ferralsol. Potential (ash) alkalinity, available alkalinity by titration to pH 4 and soluble alkalinity (16 h water extract titrated to pH 4) were measured. Potential alkalinity ranged from 373 (maize) to 1336 (groundnuts) mmol kg-1 and was equivalent to the excess of their cation charge over inorganic anion charge. Available alkalinity was about half the potential alkalinity. Cations associated with organic anions are the source of alkalinity. About two thirds of the available alkalinity is soluble. Residue buffer curves were determined by titration with H2SO4 to pH 4. Soil buffer capacity measured by addition of NaOH was 12.9 mmol kg-1 pH-1. Soil and residue (10 g:0.25 g) were shaken in solution for 24 h and suspension pH values measured. Soil pH increased from 4.3 to between 4.6 (maize) and 5.2 (soyabean) and the amounts of acidity neutralized (calculated from the rise in pH and the soil buffer capacity) were between 3.9 and 11.5 mmol kg-1, respectively. The apparent base contributions by the residues (calculated from the buffer curves and the fall in pH) ranged between 105 and 350 mmol kg-1 of residue, equivalent to 2.6 and 8.8 mmol kg -1 of soil, respectively. Therefore, in contact with soil acidity, more alkalinity becomes available than when in contact with H2SO 4 solution. Available alkalinity (to pH 4) would be more than adequate to supply that which reacts with soil but soluble alkalinity would not. It was concluded that soil Al is able to displace cations associated with organic anions in the residues which are not displaced by H+, or that residue decomposition may have begun in the soil suspension releasing some of the non-available alkalinity. Soil and four of the residues were incubated for 100 days and changes in pH, NH4+ and NO3 - concentrations measured. An acidity budget equated neutralized soil acidity with residue alkalinity and base or acid produced by N transformations. Most of the potential alkalinity of soyabean and leucaena had reacted after 14 days, but this only occurred after 100 days for gliricidia, and for maize only the available alkalinity reacted. For gliricidia and leucaena, residue alkalinity was primarily used to react with acidity produced by nitrification. Thus, the ability of residues to ameliorate acidity depends not only on their available and potential alkalinity but also on their potential to release mineral N. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Resistance of island rainforest to invasion by alien plants: Influence of microhabitat and herbivory on seedling performance
PY  - 2004
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0842287443&doi=10.1023%2fB%3aBINV.0000010144.12808.cb&partnerID=40&md5=57adcd3306154f4a9825dba28f528b7d
AB  - Experiments have promise in determining mechanisms by which communities resist invasion. Growth and survivorship of transplanted seedlings of introduced tree species (Leucaena leucocephala, Muntingia calabura, Adenanthera pavonia, and Clausena excavata) were used to assess abiotic (light regime) and biotic resistance (herbivory) to invasion of rainforest on Christmas Island (Indian Ocean). At four sites, seedlings were transplanted into the forest edge along roadside verges and into adjacent intact forest; half were caged to prevent access by the dominant seedling consumer, the red land crab (Gecarcoidea natalis). Red crab densities did not differ between roadside and forest plots. Red crabs initially reduced survivorship of Leucaena in both edge and interior plots but virtually all seedlings in the forest interior were dead after 41 weeks. Survivorship of Muntingia was also initially reduced by crabs in the forest edge, but again, all but one seedling died by the end of the experiment. Seedlings of Adenanthera and Clausena fared much better overall, surviving well in both locations. Red crabs had no overall effect on Adenanthera survival but significantly reduced survival of Clausena in forest plots. For both species, seedling performance was greater in the forest edge than in the forest interior. Red crabs had no effect on height increment for either species; however, for Clausena, red crabs reduced seedling mass in the forest interior. Both Adenanthera and Clausena were able to persist in the intact forest. Clausena is now actively invading intact rainforest, but Adenanthera appears dispersal-limited. Resistance factors in intact forest appear hierarchical: biotic resistance afforded by land crabs can impede establishment of some plant invaders but seedling responses to abiotic factors (e.g., the light regime) largely overwhelm its effect. Together, these two community attributes are likely to restrict the range of plant invaders to a small suite of species that can successfully establish in intact rainforest on the island. However, increased propagule pressure from a variety of shade-tolerant species and further declines in the abundance of the dominant seedling consumer may lead to increasing invasion success in this island rainforest.

AB  - Feeding characteristics of diets containing leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) or arachis (Arachis pintoi) leaf meal were determined with 32 California x New Zealand rabbits. Four diets were formulated to contain 30 and 40% of either leucaena or arachis foliage meal and were offered ad libitum during eleven days to growing rabbits weighing on average 0.98 kg according to a randomized block design. The pattern of feed intake, as determined during the first hour after offering the meal in the morning, showed that rabbits spent more time eating the diet containing leucaena than arachis. Daily feed consumption was higher on the leucaena diet (73.6 g DM/day) as compared to arachis (60.7 g/day). Daily feed consumption was directly related (R2 = 0.87) to the number of times the rabbits were observed to be eating during the first hour in the mornning after receiving fresh feed.

AB  - As a result of trees afforestation experimentation in upside of hot and arid valley of Jinsha River, Broussonetia papyrifera, Cajanus cajan, Dodonaea viscose, Phyllanthus enblica, Melia toosendan were suitabe trees to plant in an area under a elevation of 1 600 m; Albiza kalkora, Acacia mearnsii, Cupressus lusitanica, Cupressus duclouxiana were suitabe trees at elevation between 1 400 m and 1 700 m, Tamarindus indica, Tephrosia candida, Acacia glauca, Leucaena Leucocephala cv. Salvador, Schleichera oleosa, Caesalpinia spinosa were suitable trees under 1 400 m. Direct sowing were adopted to plant C. cajan, D. viscose, T. candida. For A. kalkora, A. mearnsii, M. toosendan, A. glauca, L. leucocephala cv. Salvador, S. oleosa, and C. spinosa, 100-days-old containerized seedlings were used for afforestation, for T. indica, C. lusitanica, C. duclouxiana, and C. spinosa, 1-year-old containerized seedlings had better effect in afforestation. The silvicultural technique included site preparation in blocks (40 m × 40 m × 40 cm) , application of organic manure with N and P fertilizer as basal fertilizer, and planting the trees at the beginning of rainy season. Strong, big and well lignified seedlings should be used in afforestation. It was important to remove weeds during afforestation and rainy season.

AB  - The effect of transinoculation of goat rumen liquor into sheep rumen on mimosine toxicity was studied. One adult Kutchi male goat having higher mimosine degradation capacity than sheep was gradually adapted to Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) leaves by feeding increasing level of eucaena leaves supplementation for 1 month. Six Bharat Merino rams (12-18 months of age) were divided into two equal groups with (group I) or without (group II) infusion of 200 ml of goat rumen liquor per animal. The mimosine degradation in groups I and II were 3.04 and 2.31; 3.90 and 3.73 mg per day per 10 ml rumen liquor respectively after 1 and 2 weeks of leucaena feeding leaves. Total rumen bacterial population in RGCA medium and in a selective medium containing iron showed an increasing trend in both groups, while the bacterial population growing in the presence of cellulose showed a decreasing trend. Animal performance data did not show any adverse effect. Results revealed that transinoculation of rumen liquor from leucaena leaves adapted goat to sheep rumen did not help to improve mimosine degradation in the sheep. The sheep transinoculated with goat rumen liquor displayed no in vivo improvements in nutrient utilization vis-à-vis mimosine metabolism.

AB  - An experiment was undertaken for determining the noxiousness coefficient of the psyllid Heteropsylla cubana in Leucaena leucocephala. In the experiment, two insectariums of 12 m3 were used and six plants of leucaena were transplanted in both. In the first, an apparently healthy population of 50 psyllids of Heteropsylla cubana/m2. collected in the field, was released. The second, without insects, was the control. In the first month, weekly observations were made and, starting from the second, they were monthly, to determine the visible lesions in the plants. For this reason, the proportions corresponding to the quantification of the population and its damages were used. The demographic variables of the population and the noxiousness coefficient were determined. The plants were pruned at one meter of height and the leaf yield was calculated in fresh basis at 28, 66 and 122 d. The observations in the insectariums proved that the population released attained to survive and multiply itself under the conditions of the study. At three months, a generalized defoliation was produced in all the plants compared to the control, in which there were no damages. It was evidenced that H. cubana multiplied its initial population in 87 times. The values of the net reproduction rate (Ro), finite increase rate (λ) and the intrinsic increase rate (rd) varied in the different stages, r d ranged from 0.008 to 0.037. The leaf yield in fresh basis decreased up to seven times when compared to the control and the growth of the plants affected. This leads to a noxiousness coefficient of 85.7 %. It is concluded that Heteropsylla cubana, when having no natural enemies, is able to provoke the total defoliation of Leucaena leucocephala and, consequently, affects the yield of the plant, delays its growth and decreases the capacity of regrowth. The result of the noxiousness coefficient is recommended to be used as previous basis for the calculation of the damages threshold in Cuban conditions.

AB  - Plant-based foods may serve as alternative resources in meeting the nutritional requirements of predatory mites, when the preferred prey species is scarce. In laboratory studies, we evaluated the effect of various plant-based food resources associated with cassava on development and reproduction of Neoseiulus (=Amblyseius) idaeus Denmark and Muma, Typhlodromalus manihoti Moraes, and Typhlodromalus aripo DeLeon, three predatory mites that have been used in classical biological control of the herbivorous mite Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar) in Africa. The tests included five treatments (diets): pollen of three plant species-Zea mays L. (maize), of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit, and of Ricinus communis L.-cassava foliar exudate, and cassava leaf tissue (as the control). Neoseiulus idaeus did not complete development (hence no reproduction occurred) on any of the offered foods. Both T. aripo and T. manihoti successfully completed immature development-albeit in small proportions-on pollen of maize and L. leucocephala and on cassava foliar exudate. Only T. aripo completed immature development on pollen of R. communis and cassava leaf tissue; on the latter two foods, however, only males reached the adult stage. Moreover, of the five diets, none except pollen of maize was suitable for reproduction, and only for T. aripo, as T. manihoti did not reproduce on any of these diets. The duration of immature development of T. aripo was shorter on pollen of maize (6.9 days) than on cassava foliar exudate (11.1 days), while an intermediate value was recorded on pollen of L. leucocephala (8.6 days). Typhlodromalus manihoti developed faster on pollen of maize and cassava foliar exudate (6.8 days) than on pollen of L. leucocephala (9.8 days). Typhodromalus aripo lived much longer on pollen of maize and cassava foliar exudate compared with T. manihoti, whereas the two predator species had nearly similar female longevity on pollen of L. leucocephala. These results suggest that consumption of pollen of maize, pollen of L. leucocephala, or cassava foliar exudate can enhance development of T. aripo and T. manihoti in the absence of M. tanajoa, their preferred prey. Pollen of maize was suitable for T. aripo in completing oögenesis and hence allowing the predator to increase in abundance during shortages of M. tanajoa. The implications of our findings for the persistence of the acarine predator-prey system on cassava, and for the success of biological control of M. tanajoa in Africa are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The effects of Leucaena leucocephala leaf (LL) supplementation on selenium (Se) status of growing Philippine goats were determined in the present study. A total of 12 3-4 month old male goats with mean bodyweight of 8.8 kg was used. All animals received a basal diet comprised of different forages. Six of the animals were supplemented with LL (22.9% CP) while the remaining six animals were not supplemented (control). The rate of LL to the total forage diet offered to the LL-supplemented animals was 25%. Bodyweight measurement, blood and forage sampling were carried out every 2 weeks during the 4 months of experiment. Selenium, sulfur, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, copper and zinc concentrations were analyzed after wet digestion. Leucaena leaf seemed to have higher Se and calcium, but lower copper and zinc concentrations than was observed in grasses fed to the animals. Bodyweight of growing goats in LL-supplemented group tended to be higher than that of control animals. Supplementation of LL resulted in high whole blood Se concentration of growing goats. In the last month of this experiment, whole blood in all supplemented animals contained higher Se concentration than the deficient level of 20 ng/mL, while Se concentration in the control group was slightly above the deficient level.

AB  - In this study, activated carbon has been prepared from the fruit of Leucaena Glauca Benth and its ability in removing nickel (II) from industrial wastewater and lead (II) from synthetic lead solution has been analyzed through batch adsorption experiments to explore the feasibility of using this carbon. The effect of solution pH, on nickel and lead adsorption behaviour was examined. The dosage (weight/litre) of carbon required and the contact time required to arrive at the equilibrium were analysed. The effect of initial metal concentrations of the solutions on the removal efficiency was examined. At pH = 4.2, the nickel removal efficiency was 97.62% at equilibrium condition. The optimum dose of this carbon to remove nickel from 63 ppm concentration wastewater was 2 gm/100 mL and the optimum contact time was 10 min. The maximum efficiency 95.8% was achieved at pH = 4.0 for lead removal at equilibrium conditions. The optimum dose of the carbon to remove lead from 50 ppm concentration synthetic solution was 1 gm/100 mL and the optimum contact time was 15 min. The isotherms are in conformity with the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. © 2005 - Kalpana Corporation.

AB  - Three tropical legumes, namely Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania sesban and Cajanus cajan, were subjected to chemical analysis plus in vitro, in situ and in vivo evaluations. Three different assays were used to determine total tannins: adsorption to polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVPP-tannins), radial diffusion (RD-tannins) and protein precipitation capacity (BSA-tannins). Total phenols, total tannins and condensed tannins were highest for Sesbania. RD-tannins were correlated with total phenols (r2 = 0.93), PVPP-tannins (r 2 = 0.92) and condensed tannins (r2 = 0.99). The protein precipitation capacity of Sesbania, Leucaena and Cajanus were 25.9, 6.13 and 4.05 μg BSA/g DM, respectively. Gas production at 24 h was negatively correlated with total phenols (r2 = 0.99), PVPP-tannins (r 2 = 0.99) and condensed tannins (r2 = 0.91). The RD-, PVPP-tannins and the response to polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the gas production assay appeared to be useful as a first screen for tannins. In situ degradability did not reflect any adverse effects of tannins. However, in vivo experiments showed that the apparent DM digestibility of Sesbania and Leucaena was lower than the basal diet. The apparent protein digestibility was lower for all legumes compared to the basal diet. Most treatments caused a negative nitrogen balance. The problems associated with browse feeding were not only related to tannin contents, other factors such as inherently poor digestibility and low energy intake may also have lead to the poor animal performance on these diets. We propose, given the limitations of current tannin assays, that it is not possible to predict beneficial or harmful nutritional effects from total tannin concentrations per se. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Condensed tannins in tropical fodder crops and their in vitro biological activity: Part 2
PY  - 2004
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1442264826&doi=10.1002%2fjsfa.1653&partnerID=40&md5=15228a937154fdd2c49da09731870bf0
AB  - With the aim to evaluate the biological activity of purified condensed tannins of tropical forages we conducted two in vitro experiments. In the first, using a radial diffusion technique, the protein precipitation of free condensed tannins (FCT) from Manihot esculenta, leucaena leucocephala, Arachis pintoi, Guazuma ulmyfolia, Gliricidia sepium and of tannic acid on bovine serum albumin (ASB), papain, pepsin and trypsin at pH 5.0 and 6.8 was evaluated with a three-way analysis of variance. Significant effects (P ≤ 0.05) for the tannin type, protein source, pH and their interactions were observed. Pepsin showed the highest protein precipitation (PP) at a pH of 5.0 (82.9 μg) with FCT of G ulmyfolia and the lowest (0 and 0.2 μg) of BSA with G sepium and A pintoi at pH 6.8. Experiments were then conducted using completely randomized designs in order to observe the effect of adding 0, 1.25 or 2.50 mg of FCT from M esculenta and L leucocephala to the rumen fluid-buffer in an in vitro dry matter digestibility test (IVDMD) of Medicago sativa and Brachiaria decumbens, The IVDMD value of M sativa (757 g kg-1) decreased with L leucocephala tannins, although with those of M esculenta it was increased (824 g kg-1 and 871 g kg-1, respectively) for 1.25 and 2.5 mg of FCT. The IVDMD value of B decumbens (774 g kg-1 without tannins) diminished with any tannin and any dose (P < 0.05). We conclude that there are differences in the FCT contents of fodder crops and in their biological activity measured as the capacity to precipitate proteins, which is modified by the type of tannin, the protein and the pH. The result of an IVDMD is regulated by the type of tannin and its dose. © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Alley cropping of subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) for sustaining higher crop productivity and soil fertility of rice (Oryza sativa)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) system in semi-arid conditions
PY  - 2004
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21044434249&partnerID=40&md5=07ea16d75c89bac19357d26fe33f0d07
AB  - A field experiment was conducted during 1992-93 to 1998-99 on sandy-loam soil (Typic Ustochrept) in semi-arid conditions, to evaluate the production potential of rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) system in sole and alley cropping with subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) under integrated nitrogen supply system. In alley cropped rice-wheat system, loppings of L. leucocephala incorporated @ 6 tonnes/ ha/year in the soil as green manure before rice and wheat planting added approximately 80 kg organic nitrogen/ ha/year to system which replaced 25% mineral fertilizer N. Increasing levels of nitrogen enhanced grain yield of rice and wheat significantly up to 90 kg N/ha, beyond which increase was marginal and non-significant. Further, association of L. leucocephala reduced grain yield of rice and wheat by 9.9 and 5.5% compared to sole cropping of rice and wheat respectively. In addition to this, L. leucocephala also provided 6-7 tonnes/ha/year green fodder and 5-6 tonnes/ha/year fuel wood and resulted in net saving of Rs 6,539/ha/year at 90 kg N/ha. Green manuring of L. leucocephala decreased the pH of soil from 8.74 to 8.43 and bulk density from 1.70 to 1.50 g/cc and soil organic carbon by 39.10, nitrogen content by 24.10, available P2O5 by 13.40, available K2O by 18.40 and infiltration rate by 38.20% under alley cropping, but a slight change in these soil characteristics was also observed under sole cropping of rice-wheat system.

TI  - Intensity of pre-dispersal seed predation in the invasive legume Leucaena leucocephala is limited by the duration of pod retention
PY  - 2005
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-20444364881&doi=10.1111%2fj.1442-9993.2005.01475.x&partnerID=40&md5=35b186b74c488af2bc9ec2caecd0119d
AB  - The intensity of seed predation the invasive tropical legume Leucaena leucocephala by the bruchid Acanthoscelides macropthalmus was investigated in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. The number of seeds damaged by A. macropthalmus as a proportion of total seeds available was found to increase the longer the pods remained on the tree. Seed predation ranged from a mean of 10.75% of seeds on pods that remained on the plant for 1 month and increased to 53.54% for pods that remained of the plant for 4 months. The low bruchid populations at high pod densities results in 'predator satiation'. However, pods dehisce over time and the proportion of pods available over time to the bruchid correspondingly declines. By the time bruchid densities build up, most pods have dehisced and the seeds consequently escape predation. As a result the number of seeds lost to bruchid damage increases only marginally over time. Despite the levels of seed predation observed over the course of the study, the number of seeds in the soil seedbank almost doubled over time increasing from 8.5 seeds m-3 to 15.5 seeds m-3 over a 4-month period. Levels of seed predation and addition of seeds to the soil seedbank were not correlated. The taxonomic (subspecies) status and apparency of host plants as measured by plant and patch traits (average plant height, density of podding plants and patch size) did not influence levels of seed predation. Pre-dispersal seed predation studies need to take into account the pod/seed retention behaviour of the plant. The ability of the bruchid to regulate the invasiveness of Leucaena through influencing its demography is likely to be diminished if the insect populations cannot increase rapidly enough to use the seeds before pod dehiscence.

TI  - Assessment of tree fodder preference by cattle using chemical composition, in vitro gas production and in situ degradability
PY  - 2005

AB  - Short term preference for five tree fodders by cattle was assessed by their chemical composition, as well as in situ and in vitro gas production, in two studies. In study 1, five heifers (341 ± 36 kg liveweight) were offered Brosimun alicastrun (BA), Piscidia piscipula (PP), Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Lysiloma latisiliquum (TL) and Guazuma ulmifolia (GU) in a 6 h 'cafeteria' study over 5 consecutive days. In study 2, the same 5 heifers and tree fodders were used, but each heifer was offered a single tree fodder and fresh Taiwan grass (Pennisetum purpureum) ad libitum for 6 h. After 6 h, refusals were weighed and, for the rest of the day, only Taiwan grass was offered ad libitum. Forages offered in both studies were analyzed for dry matter (DM), crude protein, ash, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, lignin, total polyphenols and condensed tannins, as well as for in situ DM degradation (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h) and in vitro gas production (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96 and 120 h). In situ degradability was fitted to the equation p = a + b(1-e-ct), while the equation gas = GV(1 + (B/t)C-1) was used for in vitro gas production. Residues from in vitro gas production were used to estimate in vitro DM and organic matter digestibility. Relationship between tree fodder intake, chemical composition, and in situ and in vitro digestibility was assessed using Pearson correlation analysis. In study 1, tree fodder intake (g DM/kg LW0.75) was: PP 5.41, TL 5.62, LL 15.62, GU 17.31 and BA 55.36 (S.E.D. 1.63). Intake was correlated with lignin (Pearson coefficient, -0.898, P=0.039), IVDMD (r = 0.916, P=0.029) IVOMD (r = 0.902, P=0.036), parameter 'b' and 'c' from in situ degradability (r = 0.926, P=0.034 and r = 0.926, P=0.024, respectively) and with the 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h measurements, as well as parameter GV from in vitro gas production (r = 0.873, P=0.053) and 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36 and 48 h cumulative gas readings. In study 2, tree fodder intake (g DM/kg LW0.75) was: PP 17.74, TL4.08, LL 22.18, GU 13.47 and BA 38.56 (S.E.D. 0.52). Grass intake (g DM/kg LW 0.75) during the same time was: 79.41, 89.64, 87.69, 86.30 and 77.43 (S.E.D. 0.83) when PP, TL, LL, GU and BA, respectively, was offered. Total DM intake (in 6 h) increased (P<0.05) when LL and BA were offered. Tree fodder intake was related to IVDMD (r = 0.950, P=0.013), IVOMD (r = 0.942, P=0.017), parameter 'c' from in situ degradability (r = 0.908, P=0.033) and 12 and 24 h measurements, as well as parameter GV from in vitro gas production (r = 0.910, P=0.032) and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 h cumulative gas readings. As feed preference is a short term response, lignin might be an indicator of intake preference. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leaves and leaf protein concentrates (LPCs) from leaves of Glyricidia septum and Leucaena leucocephala were analysed for chemical constituents. The protein quality of the LPC, with or without DL-methionine supplementation, was estimated by using sixty weanling albino rats. Glyricidia leaves contained higher crude protein and lower crude fibre than L. leucocephala leaves, while the ash values were identical. In the LPCs, crude protein showed a good balance of amino acids and nutritionally important minerals. The gross energy (GE) was only enhanced in the LPC of Glyricidia and, although tannin content was reduced in the LPCs, the phytate concentration increased. The rat bioassay did not suggest that, even when supplemented with DL-methionine, Glyricidia or Leucaena LPC would support rat growth when used as the sole sources of dietary protein. Based on the analytical and bioassay data, the nutritional potentials and limitations of these under-utilized protein resources are discussed.

TI  - Termite damage to maize grown in agroforestry systems, traditional fallows and monoculture on nitrogen-limited soils in eastern Zambia

AB  - 1 Termites cause significant damage to maize and other crops in southern Africa. Several studies were conducted with the objective of determining the difference in termite damage to maize in various land use systems between monoculture maize, maize grown using traditional fallows and improved fallows. 2 In an experiment conducted at four sites on noncoppicing fallows, maize planted after Tephrosia Candida 02971 fallows had lower termite damage compared with fully fertilized monoculture maize. However, the termite suppression was not low enough to warrant rotation of noncoppicing fallows for termite management. 3 In four experiments comparing termite damage to maize grown in monoculture and in coppicing fallows, fully fertilized monoculture maize had a higher percentage of lodged plants compared with maize grown in pure Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Acacia anguistissima fallows or in a mixture of A. anguistissima + Sesbania sesban or Tephrosia vogelii + S. sesban. 4 More than 50-75% of the variance in maize yield was explained by preseason inorganic nitrogen and termite damage. However, termite damage to maize was not influenced by inorganic nitrogen, which represents nitrogen readily available to maize. The decomposition rate of biomass (related to lignin + polyphenol to nitrogen ratio) and water retention under fallows also appeared to influence termite damage. 5 It is concluded that maize grown in L. leucocephala, G. sepium. A. anguistissima and S. sesban fallows suffers less termite damage and produces maize yields comparable with conventionally tilled and fully fertilized monoculture maize.

AB  - Exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 has been shown to be essential for effective nodulation on Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena). This paper reports the isolation and characterization of an alternative sigma factor gene, rpoH2, involved in the regulation of EPS synthesis in TAL1145. Disruption of this gene in TAL1145 resulted in a Calcofluor-dim mutant RUH102 that produced approximately 18% of the amount of EPS made by TAL1145. This mutation did not affect the normal growth of RUH102 in free-living state. RUH102 induced few nitrogen-fixing nodules, resulting in a significant reduction in total nitrogen content in leucaena. It was complemented for EPS production and nodulation by a 2.0 kb HindIII fragment of TAL1145. Sequence analysis of this fragment revealed the rpoH2 ORF of 870 bp that encoded a protein of 32 kDa. Expression of the rpoH2 ORF in Escherichia coli also revealed a 32 kDa protein. A PCR-constructed clone of 1263 bp, containing the rpoH2 ORF and its upstream putative regulatory region, complemented RUM102 for EPS defects. Comparison of the RpoH2 sequence to proteins in the databases showed significant similarity to RpoH-like sigma factors of other Gram-negative bacteria. By constructing several exo:: Tn3Hogus fusions and transferring them to the backgrounds of TAL1145 and RUH102, it was demonstrated that RpoH2 positively regulates the transcription of some exo genes. © 2004 SGM.

AB  - Symbiotic properties of rhizobia are important characteristics both to describe new genera and species of these bacteria and to select inoculant strains. To verify the specificity of Azorhizobium johannae strains and Sesbania virgata, with currently known rhizobia species and their original hosts, three greenhouse experiments were carried out in Leonard jars. In the first experiment, seven A. johannae strains (BR 5401, UFLA 01-602, UFLA 01-54B, BR 5414, BR 5416, BR 5420, BR 5426) were tested separately, with ten legume species. These strains nodulated efficiently only Sesbania virgata. Although nodulation did occur with Sesbania rostrata, Phaseolus vulgaris and Macroptilium atropurpureum, it was inefficient. Nodulation was not observed with Acacia mangium, Glycine max, Leucaena leucocephala, Lupinus sp., Medicago sativa or Vigna unguiculata. In the second experiment, eight type or reference strains of known rhizobia species (ORS 571T, USDA 205T, NZP 5549T, CIAT 899T, UFLA 04-74B, NZP 2213T, CFN 42T and BR 2001) were tested with S. virgata. Only the strains ORS 571T (Azorhizobium caulinodans) and BR 5401 (A. johannae) were able to nodulate S. virgata. In the last experiment seven strains of A. johannae (UFLA 01-54B, UFLA 01-602, BR 5401, BR 5414, BR 5416, BR 5420, BR 5426) were tested for ability to nodulate stems of S. rostrata. Only strain ORS 571T, originally isolated from S. rostrata, was able to nodulate this species. The specificity of A. johannae and S. virgata symbiosis supports the proposition that S. virgata isolates as a new species of Azorhizobium.

AB  - Researchers of the Central Luzon State University in Muñoz, Nueva Ecija, Philippines have been conducting vermicomposting experiments since the late 1970s. The earthworm species first used was the Indian blue native to the country. In 1982, the African nightcrawler replaced the Indian blue because of its more efficient characteristics and lesser tendency to migrate compared to the latter. This species was eventually widely accepted because its vermicompost was confirmed to increase yields among field crops such as corn and sugarcane.

AB  - Experiments were conducted to study: (i) the growth and biomass production of Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) planted at different spaces (40*20; 40*30; 40*20 cm); and (ii) using Moringa as sole feed for goats compared with Leucaena leucocephala. The different spacings did not affect plant height and the biomass yield of Moringa. The estimated biomass yield of was 8.6, 11.1 and 7.6 tonnes/ha (first cutting); 7.6, 7.9 and 6.3 tonnes/ha (second cutting) and 6.3, 6.3 and 4.9 (third cutting) for spacings of 40*20; 40*30; 40*40, respectively. Four local male goats with a average live weight of 14 kg were used in a 4*4 Latin Square arrangement to study the effect of feeding method (hanging or putting in the trough) on eating, ruminating rate and digestibility of Moringa compared with Leucaena as sole feeds. Time for eating and ruminating, and the apparent digestibility of dry matter, protein, NDF, ADF and nitrogen retention in goats fed Moringa were not different from those fed Leucaena. The results suggest that Moringa can develop on the sulfate acid soil but the young plant did not adapt well to water logging condition, in contrast to the mature plants. It is suggested that the plants could be harvested 7 times/ year, when the annual fresh biomass yield would be from 43 to 52 tonnes/ha. Moringa can be used as a sole feed for goats.

AB  - The objective of this research was to assess the influence of the animal donor during the implementation of the in vitro gas production technique with the use of voided bovine faeces. The ruminal fluid was substituted by faeces obtained within less than 3 hours of being voided by milking cows. The samples, together with the inoculants, and the buffered mineral media, were incubated in 100 ml syringes at 39°C. The volume of gas produced was measured at different times. The data were adjusted to the equation V = a+b*(1-EXP(- c*t)). Samples of foliage of Leucaena leucocephala were evaluated. The reproducibility of the gas production when the faeces came from only one animal to that coming from different cows was compared. The results demonstrated that the values of a, b and c of the best adjustment to the model have an acceptable level of reproducibility when the inoculum comes from the same animal but they depend upon the donor. The preparation of a reference sample is suggested to overcome the problems of the dependence on the source of the inoculum.

AB  - Superhydrophobicity is referred to the wettability of a solid surface which has a water apparent contact angle greater than 150°. It has attracted great interest in both fundamental researches and practical applications. This paper discusses two models: Wenzel model and Cassie model, to describe the superhydrophobic states of surface. The effects of surface morphology and microstructure on superhydrophobicity are discussed, and the internal relationship between Wenzel and Cassie states is presented. These two superhydrophobic states can coexist and they present different properties on contact angle hysteresis. It is reported that the irreversible transition can be realized from Cassie state to Wenzel state under some certain conditions. This paper also gives a review of recent progresses in the strategies of fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces by designing microstructured or microtextured surfaces. Finally, the fundamental research and applications of superhydrophobic surfaces are prospected.

AB  - Using a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with three replicates under greenhouse conditions, we evaluated the growth of Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala in sterile top and sub-soil in combination with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) and rhizobia inoculations under two watering regimes. The factors were: AMF (Glomus deserticola) inoculation (inoculated and non-inoculated), watering regimes (adequate watering and water stressed) and two soils (topsoil and subsoil, with the latter representing a simulated degraded soil). The AMF colonization ranged from 27.3-47.3% and was significantly reduced by water stress in both hedgerow species under the two watering regimes. The growth, biomass yield, nutrient uptakes and physiological responses of Leucaena benefited from AMF inoculation in the two soils under the two watering regimes while Gliricidia responded to AMF inoculation when conditions were more stressful. Nodule dry weight of G. sepium was significantly improved (from 300-2500%) in the subsoil under both watering regimes. AMF inoculation compensated for the negative effect of subsoil when compared to the non-inoculated topsoil. Responses observed in the present investigation due to AMF inoculation, particularly in the subsoil, points to the potential of this technology in the reclamation of degraded tropical soils. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

Merr. as sole crop, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit as sole crop, berseem-sorghum with Sesbania and berseem-sorghum with Leucaena hedgerows] were assessed under 3 moisture regimes (irrigation at 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 irrigation water (60 mm depth)/cumulative pan evaporation ratio). The green biomass (187 tonnes/ha), dry matter (32 tonnes/ha) and crude protein (4.75 tonnes/ha) yields were significantly higher in a berseem-sorghum alley crop sequence with Leucaena hedgerows followed by the same alley crop sequence with Sesbania hedgerows. The berseem-sorghum alley sequence with Leucaena hedgerows provided green fodder for a longer duration including lean periods. The Sesbania species was found more sensitive to pruning and higher mortality was recorded in Sesbania. Irrigation at 0.5 to 0.75 irrigation water (60 mm depth)/cumulative pan evaporation ratio significantly increased the green biomass, dry matter and crude protein yields. Further increases did not increase the yields significantly. The water use efficiency decreased with increasing soil moisture. Green biomass yield during third growing season was higher (230 tonnes/ha) in the berseem-sorghum crop sequence alley with Leucaena hedgerows irrigated at 1.0 IW/CPE ratio. The annual soil moisture depletion was higher (172.1 cm) in this cropping system.

AB  - Scanty information on long-term soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics hampers validation of SOC models in the tropics. We observed SOC content changes in a 16-year continuously cropped agroforestry experiment in Ibadan, south-western Nigeria. SOC levels declined in all treatments. The decline was most pronounced in the no-tree control treatments with continuous maize and cowpea cropping, where SOC levels dropped from the initial 15.4 to 7.3-8.0MgCha-1 in the 0-12 cm topsoil in 16 years. In the two continuously cropped alley cropping (AC) systems, one with Leucaena leucocephala and one with Senna siamea trees, SOC levels dropped to 10.7-13.2MgCha-1. Compared to the no-tree control treatments, an annual application of an additional 8.5Mgha-1 (dry matter) of plant residues, mainly tree prunings, led to an extra 3.5MgCha-1 (∼0.2% C) in the 0-12 cm top soil after 11 years, and 4.1MgCha-1 after 16 years. The addition of NPK fertilizer had little effect on the quantities of above-ground plant residues returned to the soil, and there was no evidence that the fertilizer affected the rate of SOC decomposition. The fact that both C3 and C4 plants returned organic matter to the soil in all cropping systems, but in contrasting proportions, led to clear contrasts in the 13C abundance in the SOC. This 13C information, together with the measured SOC contents, was used to test the ROTHC model. Decomposition was very fast, illustrated by the fact that we had to double all decomposition rate constants in the model in order to simulate the measured contrasts in SOC contents and δ13C between the AC treatments and the no-tree controls. We hypothesized (1) that the pruning materials from the legume trees and/or the extra rhizodeposition from the tree roots in the AC treatments accelerated the decomposition of the SOC present at the start of the experiment (true C-priming), and/or (2) that the physical protection of microbial biomass and metabolites by the clay fraction on this site, having a sandy top soil in which clay minerals are mainly of the 1:1 type, is lower than assumed by the model. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An experiment was carried out on a commercial farm in Zulia State, Venezuela, in a tropical dry forest region with the objective of studying the milk production (MP), body condition (BC) and calving interval-first service (ICFS) in 24 dual purpose cows supplemented with concentrate Panicum maximum and Leucaena leucocephala. The grazing treatments grazing evaluated were Panicum + 1 h/d leucaena (T1), Panicum + 1 h/d leucaena + 1 kg concentrate (T2) y Panicum + 1 h/d leucaena + 2 kg concentrate (T3). The statistical design used was completely randomized with 8 replications. The results obtained showed significative effects (P<0.05) of supplementation on MP and BC, while, ICFS was not affected. The highest MP values were obtained with T2 and T3 (9.18 and 9.47 kg/cow/d, respectively) in relation to T1 (7.22 kg/cow/d); while, the best BC was observed with T1 (3.01). ICFS showed no differences between treatments, with mean of 126.2 days.

AB  - A simple and sensitive indirect spectrophotometric method is described for the determination of mimosine based on its reaction with diazotized sulfanilamide (DZSAM). DZSAM couples with N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (NEDA) forming a pink colored azodye, absorbing maximally at 540 nm (εmax=27 mM-1 cm-1). In the present method, mimosine was first reacted with known excess of DZSAM and the unreacted DZSAM was determined by coupling with NEDA. The reaction of mimosine with DZSAM proceeded optimally at neutral pH. The decrease in absorbance of the DZSAM-NEDA-coupled product obeyed Beer's law in the concentration range of 0.005-0.15 μg ml-1 of mimosine. The present method was applied to estimate mimosine in plant extracts containing lesser than 0.05 μg ml -1 with recovery at 99±0.41%. The method described is superior to other reported methods in terms of ease of adaptability and sensitivity. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The defaunating effect of multipurpose fodder trees, and the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on this capacity, were evaluated with Acacia angustissima, A. gaumeri, A. farnesiana, Bursera simaruba, Calliandra calothyrsus, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Erythrina indica, E. standleyana, Gliricidia maculata, G. sepium, Guazuma ulmifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Piscidia piscipula and Vitex gaumeri. The crude protein (CP) content ranged from 112, in V. gaumeri, to 266 g/kg dry matter (DM) in L. leucocephala. The fodder trees with highest CP content were L. leucocephala (266 g/kg DM), E. indica (213), G. maculata (216) and G. sepium (208). The neutral detergent fibre content ranged from 283 to 515 g/kg DM and ADF from 166 to 402 g/kg DM. In E. cyclocarpum and A. angustissima polyphenol, condensed tannins (CT) and saponins were detected. In vitro gas production and protozoa numbers were negatively correlated with CT content in the absence of PEG and, in both the presence (P = 0.057) and absence (P = 0.001) of PEG, with saponins. Saponins had a strong correlation with gas production with (P = 0.074) and without (P = 0.089) PEG. L. latisiliquum, B. simaruba, A. angustissima, C. calothyrsus and A. farnesiana had CT contents higher than 100 g/kg DM. Addition of PEG increased gas production in A. angustissima, A. farnesiana, C. calothysus and L. latysiliquum, but had an effect on IVDMD and IVOMD in only A. angustissima and A. farnesiana. Protozoa counts decreased to zero by 24 h in A. farnesiana, C. calothyrsus, L. latisiliquum and E. cyclocarpum, and by 48 h in A. angustissima. Addition of PEG maintained protozoa populations up to the 72 h in A. farnesiana, C. calothyrsus and L. latisiliquum, but not in E. cyclocarpum and A. angustissima, indicating an effect of saponins in these plants. PEG can be used to differentiate defaunating effects of CT from other secondary plant compounds, such as saponins. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) for dry matter (ADC dm) and crude protein (ADCcp) of selected feed ingredients were determined in vivo for grouper using passive faeces collection (Guelph System). A reference diet (RF) and test diets (consisted of 70% RF and 30% test ingredient) with 1% Cr2O3 as an inert indicator were used. An RF contained 45% protein. 10% fat and 15.7 kJ g-1 metabolizable energy. Three isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets, each contained a test ingredient (white fish meal, white cowpea meal and ipil-ipil leaf meal), were used in a growth study based on ADCcp of feed ingredients. An RF without Cr2O3 was a control. The ADC values of experimental diets were also determined. In grouper, the ADCdm of white cowpea meal, defatted soybean meal, wheat flour and shrimp meal (74-76%) were significantly lower than that of squid meal (99%), but comparable with those of the fish meals (84-89%). No significant difference was observed between the ADCdm of ipil-ipil leaf meal, rice bran and wheat flour (56-73%). The ADCcp of white cowpea meal and defatted soybean meal were similar to those of the fish meals, squid meal and shrimp meal (94-99%). The ADCcp of wheat flour was comparable with that of ipil-ipil leaf meal (79-83%). Rice bran had the lowest ADCcp value of 43%. Based on specific growth rate (SGR), the growth of fish fed white cowpea meal-based diets was similar to that of the control fish (3.2-3.3% day-1). Also, no significant difference was observed between the ADCdm (68-72%) and ADCcp (88-91%) of white cowpea meal-based diet and the control diet. The results suggest that ADC values can be used as indicators to determine the nutritional value of feed ingredients. White cowpea meal can be incorporated as a protein source in practical diet for grouper at 20.5% of the diet with no adverse effect on growth.

AB  - The annual litter fall production and the concentrations of macronutrients of four leguminous tree species were evaluated. The experiment was installed in a distrophic red yellow latosol (Oxisol), derivative of the Bauru sandstone group. The studied species were: Leucaena leucocephala. Acacia melanoxylon, L. diversifolia and Mimosa scabrella. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with four treatments (species) and four replications. The litter fall was collected in boxes measuring 50×50×10 cm, two boxes by treatment in each block. The material was collected monthly and dried, weighed and chemically analyzed. The litter fall deposition occurred in the following order: M. scabrella (7,051 kg ha-1 ano-1), A. melanoxylon (2,789 kg ha-1 ano-1), L. diversifolia (1,576 kg ha-1 ano-1) and L. leucocephala (1,389 kg ha-1 ano -1). The content of nutrients obeyed the following order: N>Ca>K>Mg>P>S, with the exception of L. leucocephala that presented a bigger content of S in relation to the P.

TI  - Space and time dynamics of Heteropsylla cubana in sowings of Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2005
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-29844438668&partnerID=40&md5=155e441d232e92b3c905d76e7eeaa11a
AB  - The experiment was conducted for five years in sowings of Leucaena leucocephala to define the space and time distribution of Heteropsylla cubana and its optimum number of samples in this legume under Cuban conditions. Random samplings were performed every 15 d. For the study of the seasonal dynamics, the samplings consisted of collecting randomly four sprouts in one of the five blocks, one per every cardinal point. For the time dynamics, a sample of 60 net sweeps/block was collected with a sweepnet. With the values obtained in each sampling, a matrix of data was created using them to make the multiple comparison analysis of the proportions according to the state of development/cardinal point and the total population/cardinal point. The indices of dispersion, size of the sample and trend of the population in time were calculated. The results showed significant differences between the populations of H. cubana in the different cardinal points. From September to January, the population kept similar populational peaks in the four cardinal points, with slight predominance in the west, where the highest densities were recorded and equivalent to 130 insects/sprout. The space distribution indicated that H. cubana tends to aggregation and the distribution in time. It had similar performance according to the development state, with increase in the first years in the amount of eggs/m 2, which surpassed 80 individuals. This evidenced a populational peak from October to December, with indices/m 2 of nymphs and adults of 55 and 33, respectively. These populations descended in the forthcoming years to values lower than 27 individuals in all the development states. It is concluded that Heteropsylla cubana does not have marked preference to be located in certain cardinal point. Its space disposition is of the aggregate type. The populational fluctuations of the insect under Cuban conditions encompass as favorable period the ends of the rainy season and the beginnings of the dry season, with a populational peak from October to November. The optimum number of samples in one hectare of 20 samples of sprouts and 25 samples of 60 net sweeps each, equally distributed in five blocks. It is recommended to further study the monitoring of H. cubana and its bioregulators in sowings of L. leucocephala with a monthly frequency from September to March. A stratified sampling was used following the sampling methodology proposed to keep the updating of the performance of its populational density in Cuban conditions.

AB  - Samples of eight tropical legume seeds (Macroptilium lathyroides (Phasey bean), Centrosema pubescens (centro), Pueraria phaseoloides (Puero), Calopogonium mucunoides (Calopo), Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena), Stylosanthes guanensis (Stylo), Macroptillium atropurpureum (siratro) and Clitoria ternatea (Blue pea) from Tanzania were evaluated using percent nitrogen (protein) content, in vitro gas production, dry matter (DM) degradability and defaunating ability. Clitoria ternatea seeds had the highest %N (7.07) while Centrosema pubescens had the lowest (3.52). The ranking of the seeds in terms of percent protein content was as follows: Clitoria ternatea>Pueraria phaseoloides> Calopogonium mucunoides>Stylosanthes guianensis> Macroptillium atropurpureum>Leucaena leucocephala> Macroptilium lathyroides> Centrosema pubescens. Species and PEG had significant effect on in vitro gas production. Centrosema pubescens produced significantly highest volume of gas (55ml) while .Stylosanthes guianensis produced the lowest volume of gas. (29ml). The ranking of the seeds in terms of gas production was: Centrosema pubescens >Macroptillium atropurpureum> Macroptilium lathyroides > Leucaena leucocephala >Pueraria phaseoloides > Calopogonium mucunoides > Clitoria ternatea > Stylosanthes guianensis.. There was increase in gas production on addition of PEG only in Stylosanthes guianensis (P<0.05). The seeds had high degradability. Leucaena leucocephala and Stylosanthes guanensis seeds were the least degraded while Centrosema pubescens was the most degraded. The ranking of the seeds based on nylon bag degradability was: Centrosema pubescens> Pueraria phaseoloides > Clitoria ternatea > Macroptilium lathyroides > Macroptillium atropurpureum> Calopogonium mucunoides > Leucaena leucocephala> Stylosanthes guianensis. There was a high positive correlation between in vitro gas production and nylon bag degradation (r=0.87). Only seeds of Calopogonium mucunoides and Clitoria ternatea.had defaunating activities. It is concluded that the seeds of tropical legumes have potential as feed supplements for ruminants as they have high digestibility and are rich in nitrogen. Clitoria ternatea and Calopogonium mucunoides appear to have potential as defaunating agents.

AB  - The taxonomical study of the external genitalia of the Heteropsylla cubana Crawford was conducted through periodical random samplings in sowings of L. leucocephala, located in different regions of the country and with different phenological statuses. Samples of infested growing shoots were taken and the winged animals were collected using a sweepnet. Five samples were collected with 20 net sweeps each. In each sampling area, five specimens per sex were clarified and the genitalia of the females and the males were removed from the rest of the abdomen. The biological cycle was performed in laboratory conditions. Thirty Petri dishes were used as rearing units, with five repetitions in time. A recently emerged couple was introduced in each experimental unit and the morphological and behavioral changes in the different stages of the H. cubana were observed daily through the stereoscopic microscope. The position and dispersion statistics were determined for each indicator. The results demonstrated that all the psyllids collected in the adult stage in sowings of L. leucocephala in different regions of the country correspond to H. cubana. The polymorphism in the nymph and the adult populations of H. cubana was evident. The dimensions of the insect vary in each stage. In the egg stage, they measured approximately 0.6 mm of length and 0.3 mm of width. The nymph stage starts with similar dimensions to those of the eggs, up to 1.4 mm of length and 0.7 mm of width, approximately. In the adults, the dimensions range from 1.5 to 2 mm of length, with average duration of 17 d for the adult-egg cycle. The values in the periods of pre-oviposition, oviposition and post-oviposition were in the interval from two to three days. The influence of the temperature on the length of the biological cycle of the insect was demonstrated. It is concluded that Heteropsylla cubana Crawford was the species found in the areas of L. leucocephala in the different regions sampled in Cuba. Its life cycle is composed of five nymph stages, with average egg-adult duration of 17 d. The periods of pre-oviposition, oviposition and post-oviposition were between two and three days, favourable range for the adequate reproduction of the insect. Further taxonomical and biological studies are recommended as basis for the diagnosis of the species, as well as the perfection of the sampling methodology. Besides, the proliferation of adults should be considered. All these aspects are indispensable tools for establishing alternatives to standardize the insect management.

AB  - The effect of the supplementation with bentonite on the in vitro ruminal protein protection was studied using four nitrogenous feeds: meal of soybean, Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and urea, in a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement 3 x 4 (treatment vs time). The feeds alone (T1), as well as those supplemented with natural bentonite (T 2) and treated with water and heat (T3) were incubated for 8 h in studies of dynamics with three replications per treatment. The production of NH3 was the main indicator of the ruminai proteolysis. For soybean, concentrations of NH3 of 17, 11 and 6 meq/L were found at the maximum time of release for the treatments T1, T2 and T3, respectively; while, for leucaena, these values were 11, 7 and 10. Gliricidia and urea showed values of maximum release at 12 and 24 h, respectively, with concentrations of NH3 of 19 and 8 meq/L and of 41, 31 and 36 in this same order. The production of ammonia nitrogen, estimated as percentage of total initial nitrogen, showed high levels of degradability of the untreated feeds, with average values of 36, 45, 70 and 100% for soybean, leucaena, gliricidia and urea, respectively. The results denote the potentiality of the sodic bentonite as protector of the rumen protein. Thus, further studies are recommended in live animals to establish the optimum levels of bentonite inclusion, according to the type of diet and the final fermentation products.

AB  - The influences of additive concentration and wood species on dimensional stability of cement-bonded flakeboards were investigated. Laboratory scale flakeboards 6mm thick was made from Gmelina arborea (G), Leucaena leucocephala (L) and the mixture of the two in equal proportions. Boards were manufactured at the three levels of the raw materials and additive concentration at levels of 1.5% and 3.5% of the cement weight board. The average values obtained for Thickness Swelling (TS) following 24-hour immersion in cold water ranged from 0.90% to 2.75% for Gmelina arborea; 0.12% to 2.24% for Leucaena leucocephala; 0.39% to 1.68% for mixed materials of the wood species. For 48 hours soak, the values obtained ranged from 1.13% to 3.70%, 1.58% to 3.74% and 0.82% to 2.40% respectively. The values for Water Absorption (WA) after 24-hour water immersion ranged from 15.02% to 17.70% for Gmelina arborea; 15.71% to 19.08% for Leucaena leucocephala; 15.36% to 18.65% for mixed materials. The WA values obtained after 48 hours water immersion ranged from 17.82% to 20.01% for G; 18.77% to 20.93% for L; 18.27% to 20.36% for G + L. The dimensional stability of boards was affected by the wood species, wood density and additive concentration. Boards from Gmelina arborea, were more stable dimensionally than that made from Leucaena leucocephala, whereas the boards produced from the mixture performed better than that of Leucaena leucocephala. The TS and WA of boards decreased with increase the additive concentration. The most dimensionally stable boards were produced at the highest level of additive concentration of 3.5%, both at 24 hours and 48 hours water immersion. TS and WA were not significantly affected by species and species/additive concentration interaction, but the effect of additive concentration was significant.

AB  - 1. The herbivorous bug Heteropsylla cubana Crawford (Homoptera: Psyllidae) is a pest of the cattle fodder crop Leucaena (Leguminosae: Mimosoideae). The interaction between the psyllid and three varieties of its Leucaena host plant was investigated in relation to the apparent resistance of some Leucaena varieties (Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena pallida and their hybrids) to attack. 2. Field trials demonstrated that adult psyllids distinguished among the different varieties of Leucaena over a distance, and were attracted to L. leucocephala in significantly higher numbers than to L. pallida or to the hybrid. Pesticide treatment increased the attractiveness of Leucaena plants, even of those deemed to be psyllid resistant. Numbers of psyllid eggs and nymphs, sampled in the field, reflect the arrival rates of adults at the three plant varieties. 3. Wavelength reflectance data of the three Leucaena varieties were not significantly different from one another, suggesting that psyllids cannot discriminate among the three plants using brightness or wavelength cues. There was a differential release of caryophyllene among the three varieties. Release of caryophyllene in L. leucocephala and the hybrid appeared to be influenced by environmental conditions. 4. Experiments demonstrated that caryophyllene (at least on its own) did not influence the behaviour of leucaena psyllids in relation to leucaena plants. 5. The results suggest that host plant volatiles cannot be dismissed as significant in the interaction between the leucaena psyllid and its Leucaena host plants. Further avenues for investigation are recommended and these are related to novel ways of understanding resistance in insect plant inter-relationships. © 2005 The Royal Entomological Society.

TI  - Can Moringa oleifera be used as a protein supplement for ruminants?
PY  - 2005
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-13244278444&doi=10.5713%2fajas.2005.42&partnerID=40&md5=b51208f2d661e18903551e29700b3f28
AB  - The possibility of using Moringa oleifera as a ruminant protein supplement was investigated by comparison between nutritive and anti-nutritive value of its different morphological parts with that of conventionally used Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LL). Parameters determined were chemical composition, rumen degradable protein (RDP), acid detergent insoluble protein (ADIP), pepsin soluble protein (PESP), non-protein nitrogen (NPN) total soluble protein (TSP) and protein potentially digested in the intestine (PDI). Total phenols (TP) and total extractable tannins (TET) were also evaluated as anti-nutritive factors. In vitro gas production characteristics were measured and organic matter digestibility (OMD) was estimated basing on 24 h-gas production. Crude protein content ranged from 265-308 g/kg DM in M. oleifera leaves (MOL) and seed cake (MOC) respectively. Leucaena leucocephala and Moringa oleifera soft twigs and leaves (MOLSTL) had CP content of 236 and 195 g/kg DM while Moringa oleifera soft twigs alone (MOST) and Moringa oleifera bucks (MOB) had 160, 114 and 69.3 g/kg DM respectively. RDP was highest in (MOC) (181 g/kg DM) followed by (MOL) (177 g/kg DM) and was lowest in MOB (40 g/kg DM). The proportion of the protein that was not available to the animal (ADIP) was (p<0.05) higher in MOL and MOC (72 and 73 g/kg DM) respectively and lowest in LL (29 g/kg DM). The PDI was high in LL (74 g/kg DM) followed by MOC (55 g/kg DM) then MOL (16 g/kg DM). PESP was highest (p<0.05) in MOC followed by MOL then LL (273, 200 and 163 g/kg DM respectively). MOC exhibited highest NPN content (116 g/kg DM) and was lowest in MOB (18 g/kg DM) (p<0.05). Highly (p<0.05) TSP was observed in MOC and MOL (308 and 265 g/kg DM respectively) followed by LL (236 g/kg DM). MOL had negligible TET (20 g/kg DM) when compared with about 70 g/kg DM in LL. Highly (p<0.05) b and a+b values were observed for MOLSTL (602 and 691 g/kg DM respectively) followed by MOL (490 and 538 g/kg DM). Highest c value was observed in MOSTL followed by MOC and MOL (0.064, 0.056 and 0.053 rate/hour) respectively. OMD was highest (p<0.05) for MOSTL followed by MOC and then MOL (579, 579 and 562 g/kg DM respectively). LL exhibited lower (p<0.05) OMD (467 g/kg DM). It was concluded from this study that the high crude protein content in MOL and MOLST could be well utilized by ruminant animals and increase animal performance however, high proportion of unavailable protein to the lower gut of animals and high rumen degradable protein due to negligible tannin content render it a relatively poor protein supplement for ruminants. MOC can be a best alternative protein supplement to leaves and leaves and soft twigs for ruminants.

AB  - A study was conducted at Mtwapa in the northern coastal area of Kenya during the long and short rainy seasons of 1999 and 2000 to assess the benefits of agroecosystem diversification-through agroforestry and intercropping-on the activity of natural enemies of maize stemborers. Treatments consisted of maize and cowpea intercrops or maize monocrops planted within hedgerows of Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium. The plots were mulched or unmulched and insecticide-treated or not. The maize stemborers encountered, in order of abundance, were Chilo partellus, Chilo orichalcociliellus and Sesamia calamistis. The egg parasitoids Trichogramma spp. and Telenomus spp. were recovered from stemborer eggs. Ants, ladybird beetles, earwigs and crab spiders were found predating on the eggs. The larval parasitoids recovered included Cotesia sesamiae, Cotesia flavipes and Goniozus indicus, and the pupal parasitoid was Pediobius furvus. Mean rates of stemborer egg parasitism were generally high (>70%) while larval and pupal parasitism rates were low (<10%) for all the treatments. The observed rates of parasitism did not support the natural enemies hypothesis, which predicts that natural enemy activity increases with increasing agroecosystem diversity. Predation, larval and pupal mortality rates were generally low in all the treatments (<10%), with no significant differences between treatments. © ICIPE 2004.

AB  - Light availability to understorey ground vegetation in three silvipastoral systems viz. Acacia tortilis - Cenchrus ciliaris, Leucaena leucocephala - Panicum maximum and Hardwickia binata - Sehima nervosum have been estimated. Canopy shade has been estimated by slightly deviating from the Beer Lambert Law. A model I=mIo eKFS (where m=constant, F= density coefficient, K=extinction coefficient, S=Length of light ray traveled through the tree canopy and Io= average PAR in open on the day) has been evolved for estimation of PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) availability to thé understorey vegetation at 08:00hr to 18:00hr in the three systems. The shading patterns of the canopy have been estimated with respect to elevation of sun angle according to date, time, longitude and latitude of the experimental field by the relationship, Shadow area= πb2 √{1+ a2/tan2β} (a= vertical semi-axis and b=horizontal semi-axis, β, an elevation). The ratio of transmitted radiation through the tree-canopy to the open radiation has been taken as density coefficient. The value of density coefficient was observed more in Hardwickia binata > Acacia tortilis > Leucaena leucocephala. The estimated PAR under the canopies of these trees during 08:00hr to 18:00hr was more in Hardwickia binata > Acacia tortilis> Leucaena leucocephala. This shows that the findings derived out of the assumed relationship for the trees is well in agreement with the actual situation of shading pattern and availability of radiation to ground vegetation during the studied sunshine hours. © INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS,.

AB  - The nine tree forages Carissa spinarum, Ficus roxburghii, Hippophae rhamnoides, Leucaena leucocephala, Melia azedarach, Quercus incana, Robinia pseudoacacia, Zizyphus jujuba, Zizyphus nummularia, and the three conventional forages paddy straw, wheat straw and mixed grass hay were analysed for chemical composition, phenolics, protein precipitation capacity (PPC), polyethylene glycol binding capacity (PEGBC) and rumen fermentation characteristics. The rumen degradability characteristics with and without polyethylene glycol (PEG) were studied in vitro by gas production. The crude protein content was more than 200 g/kg dry matter (DM) in H. rhamnoides, L. leucocephala, M. azedarach, R. pseudoacacia and Z. jujuba. The ash content (g/kg DM) was high in F. roxburghii (217) and paddy straw (178) while R. pseudoacacia and C. spinarum contained higher neutral detergent insoluble N and non-structural carbohydrates, respectively. Total phenolics (g/kg DM) ranged from six in paddy straw to 122 in H. rhamnoides, concurrent with the highest total tannin phenols (103) and hydrolysable tannins (89). The condensed tannins ranged from 0.2 in wheat straw to 56 in C. spinarum and H. rhamnoides, and C. spinarum had the highest PPC (0.593) and PEGBC (42.3%). In vitro gas production (ml/g) to 24 h ranged from 48.5 in Q. incana to 218.3 in M. azedarach. Addition of PEG increased gas volume and in vitro disappearing N, and decreased the partitioning factor in C. spinarum, H. rhamnoides, Q. incana, Z. jujuba and Z. nummularia. The in vitro true degradability of DM ranged from 0.337 in local grass hay to 0.820 in M. azedarach, which increased upon addition of PEG, except for M. azedarach and the conventional forages. Degradability values were negatively correlated with neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and lignin. Among the tree forages, the nutritional value of M. azedarach, L. leucocephala and Z. jujuba were ranked as very good on the basis of these parameters. Values of the in vitro gas production parameters determined in the presence or absence of PEG indicate the relative effects of tannins in these forages on substrate degradability and nutrient partitioning. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effect of the inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala on the nutritional level and on the bioproductive performance of Siboney dairy cows was assessed. Three agroecosystems with trees of Leucaena leucocephala were used: (I) Cynodon nlemfuensis, planted on middle fertility soil, (II) natural pastures on poor fertility soils and (III) C. nlemfuensis + Sporobolus indicus on middle fertility soils, as well as (IV), a control agroecosystem, based on the monoculture Panicum maximum on good fertility soil. All the herds consumed forage of king grass and sugarcane, according to the needs of feed balance, and different supplementation levels were used with molasses and concentrate. In all the agroecosystems with trees (I, II and III), the energy contribution of the ration was the main limiting factor to obtain superior milk yields, while in the monoculture agroecosystem (IV), it was the protein supply. In the dry season, the availability of nutrients from the endogenous feed sources of the agroecosystems I, II and III could guarantee between 3 and 5 kg of milk/cow/d, in total absence of external balanced feeds, while the IV showed higher dependence of the exogenous feed sources. In the agroecosystems I and III, more than 50 % of the cows kept an ideal body condition throughout the lactation and more than 65 % arrived at calving with such condition, while in the II and IV, these values did not surpass 42 and 54 %, respectively. It is concluded that in the agroecosystems in which leucaena was included in the grasslands, there are higher probabilities to attain a better nutrient balance in the ration of the animals. However, this depends on the requirements and nutritive quality of the basal pasture and the rest of the feeds in the diet.

AB  - Single-layered cement-bonded flakeboards were manufactured in the laboratory using two exotic tropical hardwood species, Gmelina arborea (G) and Leucaena leucocephala (L) and a combination of the two species at equal percentage (G + L). Boards were made to three densities of 1000, 1100 and 1200 kg m-3 and with homogenous particle size of 50 × 2.5 mm in length and thickness respectively. The effects of board density on modulus of rupture (MOR) and internal bond (IB) of each species were investigated. MOR ranged from 7.7 to 9.8 N mm-2 and 5.0 to 6.4 N mm-2 for boards made from G. arborea and L. leucocephala respectively. MOR for boards composed of equal quantities of both species (G + L) ranged from 5.5 to 8.9 N mm-2. The IB values for G, L and G + L ranged from 0.11 to 0.16,0.06 to 0.08 and 0.08 to 0.12 N mm-2 respectively. MOR was positively correlated with board density, unlike IB. Hence, boards from G. arborea, the lower density species, were stronger than those made from L. leucocephala or a combination of the two species. MOR of boards at different densities and species were significantly different, whereas there was no significant difference in the IB of boards at different densities.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) has potential in Florida as a pasture legume, but soils are often imperfectly drained making establishment difficult. We conducted 2 glasshouse studies to determine responses of 8 leucaena and 1 Calliandra calothyrsus selection to different soil moisture conditions. In the first, freely drained and waterlogged soils were compared. In freely drained soil, seedling emergence was greater for leucaena (78-93%) than for calliandra (53%), but in waterlogged soil emergence of all entries was depressed (3-20%). In the second, 4 water regimens were compared: maintaining water level at 3 cm above the soil surface; at the soil surface; and 15 cm below the soil surface; and as freely draining soil. Water level at 15 cm below the soil surface gave best seedling growth. Water at or above the surface induced aerenchyma on stem bases, which enabled persistence under waterlogging. A field study examined the effects of bedding (raised and flat), propagule (seed and seedlings) and time of planting [July (during) and October (after rainy season)] on seedling survival of 5 leucaena selections. Leucaena K636 and K340, with >80% survival, established well in July or October with seed or seedlings, but K749, K784 and LxL, with 63-70% survival, established best in October with seedlings. Results demonstrate that bedding may not improve survival of leucaena seedlings during high rainfall periods, with propagule, selection and time of planting being more important.

AB  - In the development of short fallow systems as alternatives to shifting cultivation in West Africa, a long-term trial was established at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) on an Alfisol in the forest-savanna transitional zone of southwestern Nigeria, comparing three fallow systems; natural regrowth fallow, cover crop fallow and alley cropping on soil productivity and crop yield sustainability. The natural fallow system consisted of natural regrowth of mainly Chromolaena odorata shrub as fallow vegetation. The cover crop fallow system consisted of Pueraria phaseoloides, a herbaceous legume as fallow vegetation. The alley cropping system consisted of woody hedgerows of Leucaena leucocephala as fallow vegetation. The fallow lengths were 0 (continuous cropping), 1, 2 and 3 years after 1 year of maize/cassava intercropping. Biomass produced from natural fallow and cover crop fallow was burnt during the land preparation. Fertilizer was not applied throughout the study. Without fertilizer application, maize yield declined from above 3.0 t ha-1 to below 0.5 t ha-1 during 12 years of cultivation (1989-2000) on a land cleared from a 23-year old secondary forest. Temporal change in cassava tuber yield was erratic. Mean maize grain yields from 1993-2000 except for 1999 were higher in cover crop fallow system (1.89 t ha-1) than in natural fallow system (1.73 t ha-1), while natural fallow system outperformed alley cropping system (1.46 t ha -1). During the above 7 years, mean cassava tuber yield in cover crop system (7.7 t ha-1) did not differ from natural fallow system (8.2 t ha-1), and both systems showed higher cassava tuber than the alley cropping system (5.7 t ha-1). The positive effect of fallowing on crop yields was observed for both crops in the three systems, however, insignificant effects were seen when fallow length exceeded 1 year for cover crop and alley cropping, and 2 years for natural fallow. Soil pH, organic carbon, available P and exchangeable Ca, Mg and K decreased considerably after 12 years of cultivation, even in a 3-year fallow subplot. After 12 years, soil organic carbon (SOC) within 0-5 cm depth in alley cropping (13.9 g kg -1) and natural fallow (13.7 g kg-1) was higher than in cover crop fallow (11.6 g kg-1). Whereas significant increase in SOC with either natural fallow or alley cropping was observed only after 2 or 3 years of fallow, the SOC in the 1-year fallow alley cropping subplot was higher than that in continuous cropping natural fallow subplot. It can be concluded from our study that in transforming shifting cultivation to a permanent cropping, fallow with natural vegetation (natural fallow), herbaceous legumes (cover crop fallow) and woody legumes (alley cropping) can contribute to the maintenance of crop production and soil fertility, however, length of fallow period does not need to exceed 2 years. When the fallow length is reduced to 1 year, a better alternative to natural regrowth fallow would be the cover crop for higher maize yield and alley cropping for higher soil organic matter. For fallow length of 2 years, West African farmers would be better off with the natural fallow system. © Springer 2005.

AB  - The study evaluates the cause of the high pre-weaning kid mortality rate in South African Nguni goat (SANG) kids maintained on Leucaena leucocephala-grass pasture (LGP) as feed sources during gestation via reproductive performance, colostrum and milk constituents of mimosine-adapted South African Nguni dams. Does grazing LGP plots gained 2.9 (P<0.05) and 5.2kg (P<0.01) more in body weight between gestation and kidding and were 4.7 (P<0.05) and 5.2kg (P<0.01) heavier than does on natural pasture (NP) plots during the first and second trials, respectively. Conception rate in the LGP treatment group during Year 1 trial was significantly (P<0.05) higher than in the NP treatment. The proportion of multiple births (≥2 kids) on NP treatment was 56.2% (100% versus 43.8%; P<0.05) higher than that of the LGP treatment in Year 1. In Year 2, the proportion of multiple births on LGP treatment was 36.5% (76.5% versus 40%; P<0.05) more than the NP treatment. Kidding rates and prolificacy on the LGP treatment were better than on the NP treatment for both trials. Pre-weaning kid mortalities for the NP treatment group was 30.6% higher (55.6% versus 25.0%) than kid mortality recorded in the LGP treatment group in Year 1 trial. The differences between colostrum constituents of does in both treatments were not significant. However, the milk total solids (TS) (P<0.05), solids-not-fat (SNF) (P<0.01) and lactose (P<0.05) contents in the normal milk, and return to oestrus (P<0.01) were significantly influenced by the pastures. Pre-weaning kid survival improved markedly in Year 2 when lactating does were offered additional nutrients during lactation and kids assisted to nurse colostrum - an indication that adequate nutrition and management practices are vital to pre-weaning kid survival. The higher productivity and reproductive performance of SANG on LGP relative to those on NP were indications that Leucaena was not detrimental to goats that are mimosine-adapted via the transfer of the bacteria Synergistes jonesii. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A system of management and feeding of female cattle between the 12 months of age and their incorporation to reproduction (heifer stage) was studied to know their performance and development when grazing in an assosiation of grasses with a mixture of legumes. Thirty crossbred (Holstein x Zebu) heifers of 170 kg of liveweight and approximately 12 months of age were selected according to completely randomized design. They were distributed in two treatments: A) Grazing of Pennisetum (Cuba CT-115) associated with a mixture of legumes including glycine (Neonotonia wightii) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and B) Grazing of star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis). Both groups rotated in six paddocks with a stocking rate of 1.5 LAU/ha remaining in the paddock for five and seven days in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. The sward was neither irrigated nor fertilized. The animals in group B were given, in both seasons, 1 kg/animal/d of a supplement with 86 % dry matter (DM), 11.84 % crude protein (CP) and 10.8 MJ of metabolizable energy (ME) per kilogram of dry matter. The group A only received 0.5 kg of this supplement in the dry season. The heifers were weighed every 15 d. The availability of pasture and DM, CP, Ca and P were determined monthly. The forage balance manifested that in the group that grazed the multiassociation the DM supply was higher than 5 kg/100 kg of liveweight in both seasons. This did not occurred in the system with only the grass. The daily liveweight increase differed (P < 0.001) and was higher in the heifers that grazed in the associated system. The thoraxic perimeter was increased in the asssociated group (P < 0.001), being superior in 3.5 cm (15.7 cm vs 12.1 cm). This group manifested also its superiority in feeding. The results indicated that CT-115, associated with legumes and rotational management, balanced the DM supply in both seasons and showed a good potential for liveweight gain. This surpassed 500 g/d, corresponding to a good growth and development for this stage in female cattle.

AB  - An evaluation of the chemical composition and the effect of supplementation with the fresh leaves of Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala on the milk production and growth of kids from birth until weaning was conducted from September 2001 to April 2002 in Dschang University Experimental Farm in West Cameroon. 24 West African Dwarf goats weighing io average 16.7 ± 3.4 kg and aged about 2 years were used. These goats was divided in 2 groups of 12 animals each and the first group (supplemented group) received 400 g/animal/day of fresh leaves of Leucaena leucocephala and 400 g/animal/day of fresh leaves of Calliandra calothyrsus whereas the control group was not receiving any supplement. The samples of the main forages consumed by goats were analysed every month to monitor their nutritive value. An estimation of the milk production were carried out every week from kidding as well as the growth of goats and kids. From the results of this study, it appears that the nutritive value of the forage decreased from the rainy to the dry season. The leaves of Brachiaria ruziziensis were rich in hemicellulose (363 ± 67.0 g/kg DM) during the rainy season. Those of Trypsacum laxum were rich in cellulose during both dry and rainy seasons. The protein content of the leaves of Leucaena leucocephala (249 ± 12.7 g/kg DM and 265 ± 26.7 g/kg DM during dry and rainy season respectively) was higher than that of the leaves of Calliandra calothyrsus (200 ± 25.7 g/kg DM and 211 ± 37.4 g/kg DM during dry and rainy season, respectively). The milk production of the supplemented group was significantly higher than that of the control group (361 ± 93.0 g/d and 185 ± 48.3, respectively). The growth of the kids of the supplemented group was significantly higher than that of the control group. The mean daily weight gain was respectively 54.7 ± 31.3 g and 29.0 ± 14.8 g. It appears that the fresh leaves of Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala can double the milk production and also improve the growth of West African dwarf kids.

AB  - In tropical ecosystems trees have the potential to supply nutrients essential to crops. Leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) De Wit] leaf decomposition experiments were established at three sites in Haiti representing diverse soil types to assess the potential of leucaena leaves to supply P and K to crops and to determine their pattern of release. Mesh bags containing 17.4 g of air-dried leucaena leaves were placed in plots receiving 100 kg ha -1 of N as ammonium sulfate and leucaena prunings as mulch with and without 60 kg ha-1 of P and 40 kg ha-1 of K fertilizers for each crop. One bag from each plot was retrieved periodically over a period of 32 weeks for ash free dry matter, P and K determination. In the three locations applications of P-K inorganic fertilizer had no significant effects on leucaena leaf ash free dry matter remaining, P and K concentration nor content of leaves. Cumulative leucaena leaf P content release after 32 weeks of decay for the three sites averaged 4.9 kg ha-1. Cumulative leucaena leaf K content release for the three sites was about 35.4 kg ha-1. The rate of K release was higher in very humid climate than in semi-humid climate. The pattern of leucaena leaf ash free dry matter remaining, residual P and K content followed a double exponential model of decomposition for the three locations. Leucaena leaves applied at the three sites showed potential to supply P and K to crops. Plant material quality, time of decomposition and tree age should be investigated in future studies. © Springer 2005.

AB  - Castanopsis eyrei is one of the main dominant species of subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests in China. This study was carried out in Gutian Mountain, a National Natural Reserve in Zhejiang, Eastern China, to describe the structure and dynamics of the population. The method of tally with contiguous grid quadrates in 20 X 20m2 plots was used to analyze the field data. Through substituting spatial data for temporal data and the distribution along vertical transects, the 25 plots were divided into two categories, the forests at different successional stages and the forests in different habitats. The forests at different successional stages included warm coniferous forests dominated by Pinus massoniana, warm coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests dominated by P. massoniana and evergreen broad-leaved trees, secondary evergreen broad-leaved forests and mature evergreen broad-leaved forests at hillside; and there were two types in different habitats, they are mature evergreen broad-leaved forests which distributed in humid valley and hillside, temperate coniferous forests dominated by Pinus taiwanensis, temperate coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests dominated by P. taiwanensis and evergreen broad-leaved trees. As the C. eyrei populations are old in Gutian Mountain, the size structure was divided into 9 size classes. The size structure, spatial pattern and population dynamics were described for C. eyrei populations. The C. eyrei individuals were rarely found in warm coniferous forests. In the warm coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests, there were many seedlings and saplings; the size structure of the populations showed a growing trend. In the secondary and mature evergreen broad-leaved forests, the size structure of C. eyrei showed a reverse J-shaped distribution, the population tended to be stable besides some sizes absent. C. eyrei was a species adapting the mild moisture habitat. There were few C. eyrei individuals in the evergreen broad-leaved forest in the valley, because it was too humid to subsist. The C. eyrei population size structure in the mature evergreen broad-leaved forest at hillside was described above. The size structure of the C. eyrei populations seemed to be a pyramid type in temperate coniferous and temperate coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests, but they could not take the place of P. taiwanensis in these relatively steady forests except for some disasters. Some often used methods for quantifying the spatial pattern in population ecology, the T-test, the indices of clumping, negative binomial parameter, Cassie. R. Mi, and the mean crowing were employed to detect the spatial pattern of C. eyrei populations in 20 plots. The populations were significantly clumped in all the plots except that there are two showed Possion, this may be explained by its seed dispersal characteristics. In order to determine the spatial pattern dynamics of the whole lifespan, the population was divided into 6 size classes in several mature evergreen broad-leaved forests. The patterns of seedlings and saplings were clumped, which was relevant to their seed dispersal and shade tolerance properties. However they were the Possion distribution on the stages of middle, large and old trees. With the strengthening intraspecific and interspecific competitions while saplings grown up, the self-thinning began, and the seedling mortality increased over time, which made the spatial pattern to be Possion. Generally, C. eyrei was proved to be a steady dominant population in mature evergreen broad-leaved forests at the low altitude of this region with its strong regeneration ability.

AB  - Soil moisture depletion during dry seasons by planted hedgerows to lower levels than under natural fallow, would reduce drainage and nutrient losses in the following rainy season when food crops are grown. The volumetric water content of the 0-150 cm soil profile was measured under planted hedgerows (alternating Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium) and natural fallow, both either annually cropped to sole maize or in a two-year crop/two-year fallow rotation, in the humid forest zone (annual rainfall 1700 mm) of southern Cameroon during the 1995-1996 and 1996-1997 dry seasons. Hedgerows were cut to 0.05 m height, largely eliminating trees' water consumption during cropping phases. Differences in total soil water content at 0-150 cm depth, between systems, occurred only in the early phases of the 1996-1997 dry season. In both dry seasons, differences between systems in water content were found in some soil layers, all within 0-60 cm depth, yet, without consistent advantage of any system in exploiting the topsoil water resources. Soil water content was lower under L. leucocephala than G. sepium at 20-40 cm depth only. Below 60 cm depth, no differences in water regimes between systems were found. Under southern Cameroonian conditions it is unlikely that any of the systems has an advantage in accessing or recovering water and thus, if available, nutrients from the sub-soil. None of the systems examined was capable of delaying drainage and thus it appears unlikely that downward displacement of nutrients is delayed after the start of the rains. © Springer 2005.

AB  - Phosphate rock (PR) is being considered as an important source for phosphorus (P) replenishment in sub-Saharan Africa soils. Field trials were conducted with two-season crops to compare the utilization of PR combined with or without plant residues by test crops. The plant residues studied include leaves of Dactyladenia barteri, Flemingia macrophylla, Gliricidia sepium, and Leucaena leucocephala, maize (Zea mays) stover, and rice (Oryza sativa) straw. The test plants were Crotalaria ochroleuca (legume cover crop) and maize (Zea mays) in sequential cropping systems. Where no plant residues were applied, apparent utilization efficiency (AUE) of PR was 1.0% in 1999 and 2.7% in 2001. The AUE of PR was improved in many cases with the addition of plant residues. The AUE of PR in all treatments with plant residues was on average 3.4% in 1999 and 6.2% in 2001 with a pronounced effect from Flemingia and Gliricidia. Negative values of AUE were observed in treatments with Leucaena and maize stover in 1999, and Dactyladenia in 2001. These results suggest that the choice of plant residues is an important step for using plant residues as PR amendment on the near-neutral and neutral soils of West Africa.

AB  - Prolific differentiation of shoot buds of Leucaena leucocephala was induced from the different plant parts viz. cotyledon, hypocotyl and leaf. Adventitious shoot bud formation was recorded with prudent application of N6-2- (isopentenyl) adenosine and 15 % (v/v) coconut water. Coconut water alone was unable to produce any beneficial effect with regard to the shoot bud proliferation but the response was augmented with the increase in concentration of N6-2-(isopentenyl) adenosine. However supra-optimal level of N6-2-(isopentenyl) adenosine was inhibitory. Best response was recorded from the cotyledon explant at 2 mgmiddot;dm-3 N 6-2-(isopentenyl) adenosine compared to the other two explants. Comparative assessment was undertaken following the same experimental protocol in liquid shake culture. The regenerated shoot buds were subcultured in plant growth regulator-free medium where leafy shoot emergence was recorded. Optimum regeneration of roots was observed in these shoots in presence of 1 mg·dm-3 α-naphthalene acetic acid. Plantlets were finally hardened following standard procedures before transplantation to the field. In another experimental set up, the de-embryonated cotyledons regenerated shoot buds via callus formation. The regenerated shoots and plantlets obtained through callus mediated organogenesis could be used for rapid multiplication and also for the genetic improvement of individual clones of Leucaena leucocephala.

PY  - 2005
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-19744368020&doi=10.1016%2fj.anifeedsci.2005.02.013&partnerID=40&md5=06c61611ddab818efb260dc551e883da
AB  - Many different commercial products are available to remove internal parasites from small ruminants in which the drugs are available and produced in several different physical forms, and sold under various brand names. It is increasingly evident that gastrointestinal parasite (GIP) control programs based on dewormers are failing because of increased dewormer resistance; thus, alternative GIP control strategies are necessary. Leaves from multipurpose trees are often rich in N and minerals, and especially important for animal production during critical periods of the year when both the quantity and quality of pasture is limited. However, leaves or foliage of multipurpose tree species often contain high amounts of secondary compounds, especially tannins, which may have a limited impact on increasing the productivity of the animals. Tannins play a significant role in the nutrition of animals, causing either adverse or beneficial effects on nutrient utilization, health and production. The ideal concentration of CT in forage legumes generally ranges from 20-40 g/kg DM, at which level they may bind with the dietary proteins during mastication and protect the protein from microbial attack in the rumen. CT have biological effects on the control of GIP; possible direct effects could be mediated through CT-nematode interactions, which reduce nematode viability. Recent studies in Vietnam have reported that anti-parasitic agents extracted from plant materials for the control of parasites in goats were successful and have been introduced in practice as Citrullus vulgaris for tapeworms, Gliricida sepium and Artocarpus heterophilus for common intestinal worms, and Areca catechu for liver fluke. Alternative forages of Mimosa, Papaya, Leucaena leucocephala, Goava leave Mimisa spp. and Flemingia macrophylla have effects on larvae of Haemonchus in vitro. Research on the effects of Cassava, Jackfruit and Leucaena leaves, Guinea grass and Ruzi grass or cutting height of guinea grass in diets on infection rates of intestinal nematodes and live weight gain of goats has been undetaken. The strongyle egg counts and coccidial oocyt counts were much lower with goats fed foliage of Leucaena, Jackfruit and Cassava in comparison with goats fed Guinea grass and Ruzi grass. This indicates a reduced need for anthelmintic drugs to control GIP in grazing goats fed CT-containing foliage. The results showed that differences in parasite infection between forages were probably due to differences in their CT concentration, although further research into the effect of feeding forage legumes containing CT on parasite infections is required. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Crop response, tree biomass production and changes in soil fertility characteristics were monitored in a long-term (1986-2002) alley-cropping trial in Ibadan, Nigeria. The systems included two alley cropping systems with Leucaena leucocephala and Senna siamea on the one hand and a control (no-trees) system on the other hand, all cropped annually with a maize-cowpea rotation. All systems had a plus and minus fertilizer treatment. Over the years, the annual biomass return through tree prunings declined steadily, but more drastically for Leucaena than for Senna. In 2002, the nitrogen contribution from Leucaena residues stabilized at about 200 kg N/ha/year, while the corresponding value for Senna was about 160 kg N/ha/year. On average, the four Leucaena prunings were more equal in biomass as well as in amounts of N, P and cations, while the first Sennapruning was always contributing up to 60% of the annual biomass or nutrient return. Maize crop yields declined steadily in all treatments, but the least so in the Senna + fertilizer treatment where in 2002 still 2.2 tonnes/ha of maize were obtained. Nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency was usually higher in the Senna treatment compared to the control or the Leucaena treatment. Added benefits due to the combined use of fertilizer N and organic matter additions were observed only for the Sennatreatment and only in the last 6 years. At all other times, they remained absent or were even negative in the Leucaenatreatments for the first 3 years. Most chemical soil fertility parameters decreased in all the treatments, but less so in the alley cropping systems. The presence of trees had a positive effect on remaining carbon stocks, while they were reduced compared to the 1986 data. Trees had a positive effect on the maintenance of exchangeable cations in the top soil. Exchangeable Ca, Mg and K - and hence ECEC - were only slightly reduced after 16 years of cropping in the tree-based systems, and even increased in the Senna treatments. In the control treatments, values for all these parameters reduced to 50% or less of the original values after 16 years. All the above points to the Senna-based alley system with fertilizers as the more resilient one. This is reflected in all soil fertility parameters, in added benefits due to the combined use of fertilizer nitrogen and organic residue application and in a more stable maize yield over the years, averaging 2.8 tonnes/ha with maximal deviations from the average not exceeding 21%. © Springer 2005.

AB  - Twenty four dual-purpose cows grazing Panicum maximum and Leucaena leucocephala in a commercial farm located in the northwest of Venezuela, were supplemented with concentrate to evaluate its effect on urea, phosphorus, insulin and glucose contents. The treatments evaluated were: grazing in P. maximum + 1 h/d of Leucaena (T1), grazing in P. maximum + 1 h/d of Leucaena + 1 kg concentrate/cow/d (T2) and grazing in P. maximum + 1 h/d of Leucaena + 2 kg concentrate/cow/d (T3). The study was realized in a completely randomized design with eight replications. The results showed significative effects (P<0.05) of supplementation on urea and phosphorus contents, but there were not effect on insulin and glucose. The highest contents of phosphorus was observed in T2 and T3 (4.23 and 4.29 mg/dL, respectively), while, the lowest value of urea was observed in T3 (14.83 mg/dL).

Lowest reduction in different parameters of Albizia lebbeck and Leucaena leucocephala were found at 500 ppm of Cd as compared to other treatments applied in this investigation. Percentage of tolerance was lowest at 700 ppm of lead than other treatments. L. leucocephala was comparatively more tolerant to Pb and Cd than A. lebbeck.

AB  - A cross-linked leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) seed gum (CLLSG) matrix was prepared for the isolation of galactose-specific lectins by affinity chromatography. The matrix was evaluated for affinity with a known galactose-specific lectin from the seeds of snake gourd (Trichosanthes anguina). The matrix preparation was simple and inexpensive when compared to commercial galactose-specific matrices (i.e. about 1.5 US$/100 ml of matrix). The current method is also useful for the demonstration of the affinity chromatography technique in laboratories. Since leucaena seeds are abundant and inexpensive, and the matrix preparation is easy, CLLSG appears to be a promising tool for the separation of galactose-specific lectins.

AB  - Soil degradation under cultivation results mainly from the inadequate management and it reflects in low crop yields. With the purpose of evaluating the effect of legumes on physical attributes and organic carbon content of an Alfisol, an experiment was conducted in the Alagoinha County-PB, Brazil, between 1997 and 1999, with the following species: Crotalaria juncea L, Cajanus cajan L, Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp, Calopogonium mucunoides L, Canavalia ensiforme L, Dolichos lab lab L, Pueraria phaseoloides L, Macroptilium atropurpureum L, Leucaena leucocephala L, Clitoria ternatea L, Styzolobium aterrimum L, Styzolobium cinercum Piper and Tracy, besides a plot with spontaneous vegetation as control treatment. A randomized split plot design was used with thirteen treatments in the main plot (12 legumes + 1 control treatment) and three split-plot treatments were represented by the three soil sampling depths 0.00-0.10; 0.10-0.20; and 0.20-0.30 m, with three replications. Under the experimental climate and soil conditions during the three years of study, it was observed that the cultivation of legumes in the plots did not affect the organic carbon content, density, total porosity, water-dispersible clay, and aggregate stability of the soil in comparison to the control treatment.

AB  - Biserrula pelecinus is a pasture legume species new to Australian agriculture. The potential N benefit from B. pelecinus pastures in agricultural systems may not be realised if its symbiotic interactions with Mesorhizobium spp. are not well understood. This study evaluated the symbiotic interactions of four strains of Biserrula root-nodule bacteria (WSM1271, WSM1283, WSM1284, WSM1497) with four genotypes of B. pelecinus (cv. Casbah, 93GRC4, 93ITA33, IFBI1) and with a range of related legumes, including species known to be nodulated by strains of Mesorhizobium loti and other Mesorhizobium spp. Structures of root nodules were studied using light and electron microscopy enabling the ultrastructure of effective and ineffective nodules to be compared. B. pelecinus always formed typical indeterminate, finger-like nodules. The number of bacteroids inside symbiosomes varied between host×strain combinations, however, nodules formed by ineffective associations had well developed peribacteroid membranes and abundant bacteroids. Considerable variation was found in N2-fixing effectiveness of strains isolated from B. pelecinus on the four B. pelecinus genotypes. Strains WSM1271, WSM1284 and WSM1497 nodulated Astragalus membranaceus, only strains WSM1284 and WSM1497 nodulated Astragalus adsurgens. Strain WSM1284 also nodulated Dorycnium rectum, Dorycnium hirsutum, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus edulis, Lotus glaber, Lotus maroccanus, Lotus ornithopodioides, Lotus pedunculatus, Lotus peregrinus, Lotus subbiflorus and Ornithopus sativus. The four strains from B. pelecinus did not nodulate Amorpha fruticosa, Astragalus sinicus, Cicer arietinum, Hedysarum spinosissimum, Lotus parviflorus, Macroptilium atropurpureum or Trifolium lupinaster. M. loti strain SU343 nodulated all four genotypes of B. pelecinus. However, M. loti strain CC829 only nodulated B. pelecinus genotypes 93ITA33 and IFBI1 and the nodules were ineffective. The root nodule isolates from H. spinosissimum (E13 and H4) nodulated B. pelecinus cv. Casbah whereas the commercial inoculant strain for Cicer (CC1192) could not nodulate any genotype of B. pelecinus. These results indicate that strains WSM1271, WSM1283 and WSM1497 isolated originally from B. pelecinus have a specific host range while strain WSM1284 is promiscuous in its capacity to nodulate with a broad range of related species. As B. pelecinus can be nodulated by Mesorhizobium spp. from other agricultural legumes, particularly Lotus, there is an opportunity to utilise this trait in cultivar development. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation affects the biodiversity and function of aboveground organisms in natural ecosystems but has not been studied for effects on belowground species. In this paper, we consider the diversity of the rhizobia associated with the indigenous legume Dalea purpurea in 3 residual prairie areas in Minnesota and Iowa. Using Dalea purpurea as a trap host, 218 rhizobia were recovered from these soils then characterized using BOXA1R PCR. Three major and 13 minor groups were distinguished based on a similarity of greater than 75% in fingerprint patterns. Each major group consisted almost exclusively of rhizobia from a single prairie, with the diversity of Dalea rhizobia recovered from the Hayden Prairie less than that obtained with rhizobia from the other prairies. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, isolates from the Hayden, Ordway, and Kellogg-Weaver Dunes prairies were most similar to Rhizobium etli and Rhizobium leguminosarum, Rhizobium gallicum, and Mesorhizobium amorphae and Mesorhizobium huakuii, respectively. This variation in the dominant microsymbiont species across the 3 prairies studied was unexpected but could have been influenced by the limited number of samples that we were allowed to take, by unanticipated cross-nodulation between native legumes, and by variation in the range of legume species present in each residual prairie area. While some of the rhizobia from Dalea nodulated Phaseolus vulgaris, Macroptilium atropurpureum, Leucaena leucocephala, and Onobrychis viciifolia in addition to the Dalea species tested, others nodulated Astragalus canadensis or Amorpha canescens. © 2005 NRC Canada.

TI  - Short term effects of Leucaena leucocephala feeding on growth, reproductive characteristics and blood mineral profile of South Africa Merino rams
PY  - 2005

AB  - The influence of Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) on fertility was investigated in South African Merino rams fed on a basal diet of chopped Eragrostis hay for 60 days. Merino rams were blocked by weight and scrotal circumference into 5 of 3 animals. Within each group, animals were randomly assigned to 3 dietary treatments. Eragrostis hay was fed ad lib. and supplemented with 340 g of either leucaena (L. leucocephala) or lucerne (Medicago sativa). The control diet, which was also given ad lib. was composed of lucerne and Eragrostis hay in the ratio 23:77. Dietary treatment had no effect on feed intake, testicular and semen characteristics, live weight gain or scrotal growth. Rams offered the lucerne diet had higher serum levels of Ca, Mg, Se and packed cell volume (PCV) than those on the other two diets. Rams on control diet had higher serum phosphorus level compared to those on lucerne and leucaena diets. There was no significant treatment effect on the serum levels of Zn, Cu and Fe. With the exception of Se, all serum mineral concentrations were lower than optimum which may be attributed to a dietary deficiency of these minerals. It was concluded that short term supplementation of Eragrostis hay with modest amounts of leucaena has no deleterious effects on ram fertility. While this report is being prepared for publication, further studies are envisaged using incremental levels of leucaena.

TI  - Fodder yield and nutritive value of browse species in west African humid tropics: Response to age of coppice regrowth
PY  - 2005

AB  - Several indigenous and exotic browse species with potential for development of agroforestry technologies in the humid tropics of west Africa have been identified, but information on their fodder yield and quality, and how this is influenced by age of coppice regrowth is scanty and limited to a few species. The effect of age of coppice of regrowth (8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks) on fodder yield, and concentrations of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), acid detergent lignin (lignin), and acid detergent ash (ADF-Ash) in the fodder of 27 browse species was studied in the humid forest zone of southeastern Nigeria. The fodder yield, and concentrations of NDF, ADF and lignin increased (p<0.05), while CP declined (p<0.05) with increasing age of coppice regrowth for all the browse species. The ADF-Ash concentrations of eight browse species increased linearly (p<0.05), while that of 19 species followed a quadratic (p<0.05) trend in response to increasing age of coppice regrowth. Bauhinia monandra, Calliandra calothyrsus, Dalbergia sissoo, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Grewia pubescens, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Senna spectabilis, and Terminalia superba were identified to have high potential for the development of integrated crop-livestock agroforestry technologies in the west African humid tropics based on fodder yield, concentrations of CP, NDF, ADF and lignin. Coppice regrowth of the promising species could be harvested between 16 and 20 weeks to maximize yield and quality of the fodder. The results showed that fodder yield and chemical composition could be used to identify browse species for the development of agroforestry technologies for smallholder crop-livestock farming systems. © Springer 2005.

AB  - The anthelmintic effect of chromatographic fractions of leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de wit seed extract was investigated to determine the relative efficacy of the seed components as anthelmintic against gastrointestinal sheep nematodes. The fractions were obtained by thinlayer chromatographic (TLC) fingerprinting of eluates from gradient vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) of the seed ethanol extract. These were evaluated for nematocidal activity by a larval development viability assay (LDVA) in vitro. The effect of the test extracts on the transformation of L1 to L 3 and the survival rate of infective larvae (L3), of strongyles of sheep, predominantly Haemonchus contortus (Rudolphi), was used to determine relative bioactivity. Best-fit LC50 values were computed using global model of nonlinear regression curve-fitting. The composition of the fractions was identified by phytochemical screening. The extracts killed infective larvae of H. contortus of sheep in a concentration-dependent manner. Best-fit LC50 values are 77.66, 65.56, 56.72, and 40.80 μg/ml for fractions A, B, C, and D, respectively (95% CI). The fractions are composed of alkaloids (A), alkaloids and tannins (B and C), and flavonoids and tannins (D). Fraction D was significantly more active than all the other fractions (p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA, Tukey's multiple comparison test). The most active fraction (D) contains polar polyphenols, thus providing a scientific justification for the use of aqueous extract in traditional practice. The polyphenol fraction of L. leucocephala seed could find application in anthelmintic therapy in veterinary practice. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - The production of energy from non-conventional sources is gaining greater attention these days in view of its tremendous potential as well as eco friendliness. Thus, an attempt is made in the present study to utilize the droppings of pigeon (Columba livia) for biogas production. Feed additives like cow dung, subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) and waste paper are mixed in five different proportions and the bottle experiments are conducted for a period of thirty days. The relevant physiochemical parameters of all these proportions are analysed. It is found that the maximum biogas yields are obtained in the decreasing order of cow dung, subabul waste paper and pigeon droppings while no feed additives are mixed. It is also found that the maximum biogas production is obtained in 25:75, 75:25 and 25:75 ratio of the combinations of the pigeon droppings with the subabul waste.- paper and cow dung respectively. It can be concluded that the droppings of pigeon can also be utilised for biogas production efficiently along with the organic residues that are currently used. Copyright © Enviromedia.

AB  - Root nodule bacteria were recovered from the leguminous tree, Dalbergia sissoo growing in the states of Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, eastern Uttar Pradesh and Tarai belt of Uttaranchal (26.45°N to 34.25°N Lat. and 74.57°E to 82.10°E long). Greenhouse trials were carried out on Dalbergia sissoo clones PSC-2, PS-31 and D for two consecutive years to screen the bacterial strains (35) for nodulation specificity and improvement of plant growth potential. Considerable strain variation in host genotype specificity with respect to nodulation and nitrogen fixation was observed. During the first year trial involving 35 strains, 19 nodulated D. sissoo clone PSC-2. In all the treatments that were positive for nodulation, nitrogen percent per g shoot dry wt. ranged from 0.4-1.8, DSNP2d was an exception where N level was 0.1%. Eighteen bacterial strains which were positive for nodulation in the first year trial were further tested on clone PS-31 and D. Nodulation and effectiveness of nodulation was plant host-genotype dependent. All eighteen strains formed nodules on clone PS-31 whereas only eight nodulated clone D. Bacterial strains DSNPNA13 and DSNJKS7 effectively nodulated clone PS-31 as confirmed by nitrogenase activity (280.6 and 399.5 μmole of ethylene / g nodule fresh wt. / min); they were however ineffective against clone D. The nodule number did not show any correlation with the level of ethylene formed or the plant shoot dry weight. The number of nodules per plant in DSNPNJ8 treated clone D and clone PS-31 was 39.4 and 76.6 whereas shoot dry wt. in the corresponding treatments was 3.9 and 2.2 g, respectively. The amount of ethylene formed was 96.4 and 2050.0 μmole, respectively. Considerable variability amongst the strains has been observed at the genetic level based on whole cell protein profiles. This could partly explain variations in nodulation and nitrogenase activity of strains vis-à-vis host genotype. Among D. sissoo bacterial strains, 20 nodulated Sesbania aculeata, whereas three each nodulated Leucaena leucocephala and Vigna mungo.

AB  - A descriptive study was conducted in order to determine the tannin profiles of tropical fodder crops. The following types of condensed tannins (CT) were determined (expressed as g kg-1 of dry matter): free (FCT), bound to protein (CTP), bound to fibre (CTF) and total (TCT). High FCT levels were found in Desmodium ovalifolium (228.4), Flemigia macrophylla (181.9), Guazuma ulmyfolia (129.7) and Leucaena leucocephala (129.5). The highest concentrations of CTP were detected in Gliricidia sepium (61.0), F macrophylla (23.3), and G ulmyfolia (21.1). CTF levels were the highest in G ulmyfolia (55.1), F macrophylla (46.7) and G sepium (41.5). Analyzed samples cultivated in vertisol and fluvisol soils showed different contents of tannins. It has been reported that plants with more than 60 g kg-1 FCT are less palatable and digestible than forages with lower concentrations of this chemical class, although there is more protein to bypass the rumen and higher nitrogen retention. Graminaceous plants showed higher concentrations of FCT and TCT concentrations were generally lower than legumes and other forage crops. © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Mimosine, the allelochemical from the leguminous tree Leucaena leucocephala, is toxic to most terrestrial animals and plants. We report here that while mimosine inhibits major phytoplankton groups, it enhances cell proliferation in dinoflagellates. On addition to coastal seawater samples, mimosine is able to confer a growth advantage to dinoflagellates. The use of mimosine will promote the isolation and culture of this group of phytoplankton.

AB  - A vegetation survey using 109 circular plots (3.4% sample) of the recently acquired 110-ha La Tinaja tract in the Cartagena Lagoon Wildlife Refuge disclosed 103 dicotyledonous tree species. Another 58 tree species were tallied within the tract but outside of the plots. The cactus, Pilosocereus royenii (L.) Byles & Rowley, occurring on 44% of the plots, had the greatest number of stems. Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) DeWit had the greatest number of individual trees. The 10 most common tree species accounted for nearly 60% of the stems, and the 43 least common species, each with ≤5 individuals, for only 2.2% of the stems. Five species accounted for 58.5% of the total basal area, and 19 species were represented by a single plant. Seven endemic, 20 exotic, and three endangered species were tallied. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA version 4, using a direct gradient analysis of species densities by plot) showed that land use history was the most important factor in explaining species' distribution. Slope and distance to drainages also added significantly to the explained variability. Aerial photos from 1998 show that the current ground cover is about 50% shrubs, 43% open canopy forest, and 7% grass cover.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted in the dryland farming area of northwest Venezuela in order to evaluate three diets in grazing goats (grazing pasture only (buffel grass); grazing pasture + 0.3 kg of commercial concentrate/animal/ d; grazing pasture + restricted browsing for two hours daily in Leucaena leucocephala) on milk production, milk composition and growth rate. The data showed significant difference (P<0.05) between treatments. Daily milk yield increased in 35 and 52.7% when goats had access to commercial concentrate or browsing leucaena as well as grass pasture compared with the control treatment. Daily milk yield in goats with access to ieucaena was insignificantly different than goats on concentrate. Treatments did not affect milk composition. The daily growth rate of goats was significantly higher in concentrate (50.5 g) or leucaena (48.4 g) compared to grazing pasture (35.8 g). The results suggest that Leucaena leucocephala can supply an adequate amount of nutrients with similar value to commercial concentrate for growth and milk production without adverse effects on tropical grazing goats.

AB  - Macaranga tanarius is widely distributed in the abandoned low-lands of Taiwan where substantial amounts of leaves accumulate on the ground. A unique pattern of weed exclusion underneath trees is often found and thought to result from allelopathic interactions. Density-dependent phytotoxicity analysis of Lactuca sativa L. (lettuce) growing in soil mixed with the powder of M. tanarius leaves showed a significant deviation from the expected yield-density relationship. Lettuce growth was most suppressed in the low seed density experiment suggesting that the phytotoxins produced during leaf decomposition inhibit the growth of lettuce seedlings. Bidens pilosa and Leucaena leucocephala, growing in soil mixed with the leaf powder of M. tanarius were also suppressed. Aqueous leaf extracts were bioassayed against lettuce and B. pilosa, and exhibited a significant suppression in radicle growth. Compounds identified from leaves included nymphaeol-A (1), nymphaeol-B (2), nymphaeol-C (3), quercetin (4), abscisic acid (ABA) (5), blumenol A (6), blumenol B (7), roseoside II (8), tanariflavanone A (9), and tanariflavanone B (10). ABA was the major growth inhibitor. At concentrations of 20 ppm, ABA suppressed lettuce germination, while at 120 ppm it inhibited the growth of Miscanthus floridulus, Chloris barbata, and Bidens pilosa. At 600 ppm, quercetin, blumenol A and blumenol B, caused 20-25% inhibition of radicle and shoot growth of M. floridulus. The amount of ABA in M. tanarius leaves was approximately 3-5 μg g-1 dry weight, significantly higher than previously reported. We conclude that the pattern of weed exclusion underneath stands of M. tanarius and its invasion into its adjacent grassland vegetation results from allelopathic interactions.

AB  - Hedgerow management is crucial to successful alley cropping. Leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] hedgerow management practices were assessed over four seasons for effect on maize (Zea mays L.) yield and N recovery in alley cropping. Maize was planted between leucaena hedgerows spaced 4 m apart on a Lithic Eutropepts. Pruning application and regime factors were arranged in 3 x 3 factorial augmented with a control (stone walls) in randomized complete block design with three replicates. Hedgerows were pruned at 0.50 m height at (a) maize planting and at 30 d after planting (DAP), (b) planting and 40 DAP, or (c) planting, 30 and 60 DAP. Prunings were (a) removed from plots, (b) applied as mulch or (c) incorporated into the soil at planting. A hedgerow + fertilizer treatment in an adjacent trial was included for comparison. Soil application of leucaena prunings increased average maize yield and grain N uptake by 157 and 163%, respectively, compared to when prunings were removed. Addition of inorganic fertilizer further increased maize yield and N recovery. Pruning three times per season gave higher maize yield, N uptake and N recovery than pruning twice, but reduced leucaena biomass and N yield. Pruning twice per season, with the second pruning at 40 rather than at 30 DAP, increased biomass N yield but reduced N recovery over the seasons. Alley cropping with soil application of three prunings per season averaged 31% higher maize yield and 48% higher N uptake than control. N recovery was enhanced by soil application of three prunings per crop and by fertilization.

The molar proportions of propionic acid in the supplemented animals were higher in August in the Ano and Seca treatment, and in the others periods animals in the treatment Ano had greater proportions. Similarly, the acetate:propianate ratio was lower in the supplemented treatments in all periods. The values of N-NH3 showed an interaction between period and treatment, with the animals receiving proteic supplement showing higher values in August (Ano and Seca), February and May (Ano. Urea nitrogen showed an interaction between period and treatment, with supplemented animals showing higher values in August (Ano and Seca), February and May (Ano) than the other treatments, and in November the Ano treatment was higher than Teste only.

AB  - One hundred and sixteen accessions of Leucaena were assessed for resistance to the leucaena psyllid that has devastated stands of L. leucocephala pan-tropically since the mid-1980s. Damage to young leaf was assessed using a ratings scale, developed at the University of Hawaii, in replicated field trials at Brisbane, Australia and Los Baños, Philippines. The study identified a continuum of resistance among the accessions, from highly resistant to highly susceptible. Resistance levels were consistent between the two sites with few exceptions. L. collinsii subsp. collinsii, L. confertiflora, L. esculenta, L. pueblana, L. retusa, L. greggii and L. matudae were highly resistant at both sites, while L. leucocephala, L. lempirana, L. involucrata and L. multicapitula were highly susceptible at both sites. Other species were intermediate and were allocated to either resistant or susceptible categories. There was considerable variation in psyllid resistance within some species especially, L. trichandra, L. diversifolia and L. collinsii. Regression analysis was used to determine the influence of environmental variables on psyllid populations. Psyllid population outbreaks were restricted to a temperature range of 10°C minimum temperature and 33°C maximum temperature, but additional, unidentified factors influenced populations within this range. Leaf chemical characteristics were examined for their potential to confer psyllid resistance, but none were strongly correlated with accession damage ratings.

AB  - Tree plantations are increasingly common in tropical landscapes due to their multiple uses. Plantations vary in structure and composition, and these variations may alter soil fauna communities. Recent studies have demonstrated the important role of soil fauna in the regulation of plant litter decomposition in the tropics. However, little is known about how plantation species affect soil fauna populations, which may in turn affect the biogeochemistry of the plantation system. We measured soil macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass in 9-year-old N2-fixing Leucaena leucocephala, Casuarina equisetifolia, and non-N2-fixing Eucalyptus robusta plantations on a degraded site in Puerto Rico. Nutrient concentrations and standing stocks of forest floor litter were also determined to examine the relationship between litter chemistry and soil macroinvertebrates. Leucaena plantations had significantly higher abundances and biomass of millipede species than Casuarina and Eucalyptus. Earthworm biomass did not differ among plantation treatments. Nitrogen, P, and K concentrations were generally higher in Leucaena litter, which resulted in higher standing stocks of these nutrients in fragmented, moderately decomposed litter (Oe horizon). Millipede biomass was highly correlated to N concentration and C/N ratio in the Oi litter horizon. These results suggest that plantation species differ in their influence on soil fauna, and the biomass and abundance of soil fauna can be regulated through careful selection of plantation species in degraded tropical lands. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens - Mediated transformation of Leucaena leucocephala - A multipurpose tree legume
PY  - 2003

AB  - An Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation protocol for Leucaena leucocephala, a multipurpose tropical tree legume was developed. A binary vector, p35SGUSINT, harboring a kanamycin resistance gene encoding neomycin phosphotransferase (npt II), as selection marker and the β-glucuronidase (gus/uidA) reporter gene interrupted with an intron, was introduced into A. tumefaciens strain for plant transformation. Shoot regeneration was achieved on full strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6-benzyl aminopurine (20.9 μM; 5 mg l-1) and naphthalene acetic acid (5.37 μM; 1 mg l-1), while rooting was induced in a half strength MS medium containing indole 3-butyric acid (14.76 μM; 3 mg l-1) and kinetin (0.232 μM; 0.05 mg l-1). Putative transformants were selected on basal shoot regeneration medium containing 25-50 mg l-1 kanamycin depending on the cultivar. The evidence for expression of the npt II and uidA genes was established by their continued growth in the presence of otherwise lethal dose of kanamycin and by histochemical and fluorogenic gus positive assays of leaf and stem sections of these transformants, respectively. The analysis of transformants by Southern hybridization confirmed the integration of uidA gene into plant genome. These transformed plants of L. leucocephala, transferred to soil and grown in the green house, were phenotypically normal bearing normal flowers and fruits, though some exhibited precocious flowering and fruiting.

TI  - Effect of Supplementation of a Basal Diet of Maize Stover with Erythrina variegata, Gliricidia sepium or Leucaena leucocephala on Feed Intake and Digestibility by Goats
PY  - 2004
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0442329796&doi=10.1023%2fB%3aTROP.0000012103.80575.82&partnerID=40&md5=cea7160d89ab7a6f98143328992cae42
AB  - Two 4 x 4 Latin square design experiments were carried out. In experiment 1, four mature Anglo-Nubian x Fiji local goats, pre-experimental body weight 25.0 ± 0.6 kg, 22-24 months old, were used to study the effect of supplementation of a basal diet of maize stover with Erythrina variegata (EV), Gliricidia sepium (GS) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL) on dry matter intake (DMI) and nutrient digestibility. Maize stover treated with urea was used as a control diet. E. variegata was higher in crude protein content than LL or GS. The DMI of the urea treated stover diet was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that of the diets of untreated stover supplemented with forage legumes. The DMI was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the GS diet than in the EV or LL diets. Significant (p < 0.05) differences existed between the urea-treated stover and the diets of stover supplemented with forage legumes in the digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), organic matter (OM) and energy. In experiment 2, four mature goats, pre-experimental body weight 27.0 ± 0.3 kg, 24-28 months old, were used to measure their response when the urea-treated maize stover and the maize stover and forage legume diets were sprayed with molasses. The intake of the urea-treated stover diet sprayed with molasses was significantly lower (p < 0.05) that that of the maize stover/forage legume diets sprayed with molasses. The DMI of the diets improved with the addition of molasses. The DMI among the goats offered the maize stover/forage legume diets + molasses did not differ significantly. (p > 0.05). Statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences were obtained in this second study between the urea-treated stover and the stover supplemented with forage legumes in the digestibility of DM, CP, NDF, OM and energy. The stover supplemented with forage legumes had a higher (p < 0.05) nutrient digestibility. The present studies demonstrated that the use of forage legumes as protein supplements improved the feed quality of maize stover in the diets of mature goats. It is suggested that molasses should be sprayed on fresh leaves of Gliricicia sepium and other forage legumes that are initially rejected, in order to improve acceptance and DMI when fed to ruminant animals in confinement or in a cut-and-carry system of production.

TI  - Response of goats to partial replacement of dietary protein by a leaf meal mixture containing Leucaena leucocephala, Morus alba and Tectona grandis
PY  - 2004
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0347062505&doi=10.1016%2fS0921-4488%2803%2900203-7&partnerID=40&md5=60da6e758e9e53037e611ebab2ea8c00
AB  - This study investigated the effects of Leucaena leucocephala-Morus alba-Tectona grandis (2:1:1) based leaf meal mixture as a protein supplement to partially (50%) replace conventional supplements on the performance of female goats. Local female goats (12) were divided into three groups in a completely randomized design to receive either a leaf meal mixture (LMTM) based supplement, or groundnut cake (GNC) or soybean meal (SBM) incorporated concentrate, and wheat straw as basal diet for a period of about 4 months. Blood enzymes and immunological profile were monitored in all goats at 0, 30, 60 and 90 days of feeding. While dry matter intake (DMI) (g kg-0.75 BW) of goats given LMTM was higher (P < 0.05) than SBM, it was comparable to their counterparts fed GNC. Digestibility of nutrients, except for depressed crude protein digestibility (P < 0.05) in SBM group, was comparable among dietary treatments. Nitrogen intake and fecal excretions were similar irrespective of supplements, the urinary excretion of N in goats given GNC was significantly higher than comparable excretion in goats on LMTM and SBM. Balance of N (g per day) remained positive in all goats, however it was significantly higher in animals on LMTM as compared to GNC. The DCP, TDN and ME values of the composite diets were comparable among dietary treatments. Intake of DCP, TDN and ME was close to stipulated NRC requirements. Blood enzymes (alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) and serum protein electrophoresis pattern (albumin, α-globulin, β-globulin and γ-globulin) did not differ significantly due to the replacement of 50% dietary protein by LMTM throughout the experiment. It may be concluded that leaf meal mixture could be used inexpensively as a vegetable protein supplement to wheat straw based diets for goats without any adverse effect on voluntary intake, nutrient utilization, serum enzymes and immune status. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Two 4 x 4 Latin square design experiments were completed. In experiment 1, four mature Anglo-Nubian x Fiji goats were used to study effects of supplementation of a basal diet of maize stover with Erythrina variegata (E) Gliricidia sepium (G) and Leucaena leucocephala (L). Parameters measured were dry matter intake (DMI) and nutrient digestibility. Maize stover (MS) was treated with urea, used as a control diet, and had a crude protein (CP) content of 9.3%. Erythrina variegata was higher in CP than L and G. DMI of the urea-treated stover diet was lower (P < 0.05) than the untreated MS supplemented with E, G or L. Among the legume supplements, DMI (g/kg W 0.75 per day) was lower (P < 0.05) in the MS/G diet compared to MS/E or MS/L diets. There were differences (P < 0.05) between the urea-treated maize stover (UTMS) and MS with either E, G or L on the digestibility of dry matter (DM), CP, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), OM and energy (P < 0.05), but no differences (P > 0.05) among MS/L, MS/E and MS/G. In experiment 2, four mature goats were used to measure the response of goats when the UTMS; MS/legume diets were sprayed with molasses. The DMI (g/kg W0.75 per day) of the urea-treated MS sprayed with molasses was lower (P < 0.05) than the MS/legume, but DMI among the MS/legume diets did not differ. The digestibility of DM, CP, NDF, OM and energy of urea-treated MS were lower (P < 0.05) than values found for MS/legume diets. It is suggested that either E, G or L could be used as protein supplements to improve the nutritional quality of MS fed to mature goats. Addition of molasses to diets further improved DMI and apparent nutrient digestibility by the goats. This study shows the substantial effect of legume supplements on MS intake and digestibility by goats. Molasses, when available, should be sprayed on fresh leaves of Gliricidia sepium and other forage legumes, that are initially rejected, in order to improve their acceptance and DMI when fed in confinement or in cut-and-carry production systems. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impacts of early- and late-seral mycorrhizae during restoration in seasonal tropical forest, Mexico
PY  - 2003
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1642330068&doi=10.1890%2f02-5309&partnerID=40&md5=734d29fcce36ade826bf1246d860dcdd
AB  - Disturbance of vegetation and soil may change the species composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which may in turn affect plant species responses to AMF. Seasonal tropical forest in Mexico is undergoing rapid conversion to early-successional forest because of increased wildfire and may require restoration. The responses of six early- and late-successional tree species were tested using early- and late-successional AMF inoculum. The plants were germinated in the shadehouse and received three inoculum treatments: (1) soil from a two-year-old burned site, (2) soil from a mature forest site, or (3) uninoculated controls. They were transplanted as seedlings to a site prepared by burning, and their growth was measured from September 1997 to November 2000. All six species had the greatest growth response to early-seral inoculum, but the response to late-seral inoculum varied. Two tree species, Ceiba pentandra and Guazuma ulmifolia, were smallest with late-seral inoculum, even smaller than the uninoculated plants, and the other species, Brosimum alicastrum, Havardia albicans, Acacia pennatula, and Leucaena leucocephala, had intermediate growth with late-seral inoculum. Of these, Brosimum, Havardia, and Ceiba occur in late-successional forest, and the others are early seral. Of the several growth measurements (height, cover, biomass, stem diameter), stem-diameter responses to inoculum were still significantly different into the third year for four of the species. The uninoculated plants became infected by residual inoculum in the burned experimental site within three months of transplanting, yet mycorrhizal responses persisted. The treatment size differences may be due to different species composition of the inocula. The early-seral inoculum was dominated by small-spored Glomus spp., while the late-seral inoculum had a higher density of large-spored Gigasporaceae. The latter are known from greenhouse experiments to promote a smaller plant-growth response than Glomus, Mature forest trees may withstand the carbon drain from Gigasporaceae better than establishing seedlings, so the growth patterns we observed with inoculum source are consistent with a rapidly growing successional forest, followed by slower-growing mature forest. The results suggest that early-seral AMF should be used when seedlings are inoculated for restoration, even for late-seral tree species.

AB  - The nutritive value of the leaves of three leguminous browse species (Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Cajanus cajan) harvested from Nigeria was determined. In vitro gas production from incubation with rumen fluid, including the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on gas production was used. Species had a significant effect on in vitro gas production with G. sepium producing the highest volume of gas. The addition of PEG caused a significant increase in the volume of gas produced by all three browse species (P<0.01), indicating that they all contain phenolic compounds which could have anti-nutritive properties. Measurements of in sacco DM degradability showed that 24 h rumen DM degradability for G. sepium, L. leucocephala and C. cajan is 62.86, 55.25 and 55.63%, respectively. G. sepium had statistically higher DM degradability (P<0.01). The results suggest that, among the compared species, G. sepium has the highest nutritive value and that L. leucocephala and C. cajan are of similar value.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is the most productive and versatile multi-purpose legume tree in tropical agriculture and has several uses, thus called 'miracle tree'. It is a popular choice for intercropping with annuals in hedgerow or alley cropping systems. Its allelopathic effects on cereals, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, fodder crops, weeds, trees etc. have been reviewed in this paper. The foliage and pods of Leucaena contain the toxic amino acid mimosine [β-N-(3-hydroxy-4-pyridone)-α-aminopropionic acid] and many other phytotoxic compounds. The toxic effects of mimosine on plants and physiology of its action have been discussed. The future areas identified for research in Leucaena are: (a) studies on its allelopathic compatibility with different crops to identify sustainable agroforestry systems (b) investigations to overcome its adverse allelopathic effects and mimosine toxicity and (c) possibility of using the allelopathic compounds in Leucaena as natural herbicides.

AB  - The performance and development potential of seven trees, two grasses and five turf legumes were evaluated in three highly eroded landscapes of Puerto Rico. Species development during the first year of establishment was adequate at the Corozal site, intermediate in Vega Baja and poor at the Orocovis location. Tree species Albicia procera and Leucaena leucocephala K 636 grew particularly well at Corozal and Vega Baja. At the Corozal site, grasses and turf legumes were significantly better for reducing soil erosion than trees and bare ground. Brachiaria decumbens did not allow sediment losses during a highly rainy period at this locale; it was significantly (P < 0.01) superior to all tree species, one cover legume and bare ground. Soil dissolved organic carbon (SDOC) estimates were significantly (P < 0.01) higher for ground cover species than for tree species and bare ground. Soil chemical composition of all eroded soil sites under consideration did not explain the changes in performance and development of the evaluated germplasm.

AB  - The population of insects in a leucaena plantation with two years of establishment and different tree combinations was studied under grazing conditions for two years. The treatments were: neem + leucaena, terminalia + leucaena and gmelina + neem + leucaena. Two visual samplings of 20 plants/ treatment were performed monthly and others were carried out with a sweepnet, making randomly 20 sweeps/treatment. Contingency tables with Chi2 were used for data analysis. The analysis of variance was conducted through a general linear model with treatment and season factors. Regressions were determined to calculate agglomeration and spatial disposition indices for the highest number of insects and the coefficient of determination was also calculated. Heteropsylla cubana was the main phytophagous insect with populations from 60 to 120 insects in the dry season and populations of less than 20 insects in the rainy season, according to an integral sampling of 60 sweeps. There were no differences among the treatments in Heteropsylla and Empoasca populations and only the season was of interest (P < 0.01) in Heteropsylla cubana, with a higher population in the dry season. However, there were no phytosanitary damages in leucaena or in the different tree combinations, which evidenced the presence of various insect bioregulators. Agroecosystem diversification is a successful practice for keeping biological equilibrium between plant and animal species, which benefits grazing conditions.

AB  - Leucaena gum derived from seeds of Leucaena leucocephala was evaluated as an emulsifying agent. Liquid paraffin emulsions (o/w) containing 30 per cent liquid paraffin in water were formulated using leucaena seed gum between concentration range of 1 to 4 per cent w/v. Emulsion containing equivalent concentration of acacia were also prepared for comparison. All the emulsions prepared were stored at room temperature and studied for stability at various time intervals for 8 weeks. In assessing the emulsifying properties of leucaena seed gum the creaming rate, globule size analysis, and rate of coalescence were evaluated. The effects of centrifugation, pH, temperature changes, and electrolytes on the stability of emulsion were investigated. The result of these investigations show that leucaena seed gum possesses better emulsifying properties as compared to gum acacia and could be used to formulate pharmaceutical preparation requiring this property.

AB  - This study examined the nutritional and reproductive performance of female goats (12) maintained on a basal diet of wheat straw supplemented either with a concentrate based on soybean meal (SBM) or Leucaena leucocephala-Morus alba-Azadirachta indica (2:1:1) leaf meal mixture (LMAM) prior to conception, and during gestation (8) in a completely randomized design. The LMAM and SBM supplements were nutritionally similar in terms of dry matter intake (DMI) (66.55 vs. 63.60 g/kg W0.75), digestibility of major nutrients and pattern of nitrogen retention. The nutritive value of composite diets and plane of nutrition of gravid does were similar irrespective of dietary treatments to maintain desired net body weight gain and foetal growth rate. Similarly, average daily gain of gravid does (43.47 vs. 45.87 g), foetal growth rate (32. 13 vs. 29.96 g per day) and birth weight of kids (1.92 vs. 2.03 kg) were comparable between the SBM and LMAM treatments. The concentration of blood constituents (haemoglobin, packed cell volume, glucose, serum urea), major fractions of serum protein (total protein, albumin and globulin ratio, A:G ratio) and activity of various serum enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) were within the normal range in does irrespective of dietary treatment or stage of pregnancy. Apparently, the supplementation of wheat straw either with LMAM or commercial type concentrate containing SBM resulted in similar performance of does; and that the LMAM could contribute up to 0.36 of the total DMI in gravid does without any adverse effect on their general health and reproductive performance. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Leaf quality (nutrient concentration) and herbivory were studied in a set of dominant tree species in regenerating, secondary tropical dry forests growing on limestone in the Yucatán Peninsula. The study's objective was to assess how variation in nutrient availability affects leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and herbivory. Our study included an area of young forest (10 y old), with phosphorus-poor soils, and an area of old forest (∼60 y old), in which soil P was comparatively less limiting. The foliage of representative species of each site was studied, including Acacia gaumeri, Leucaena leucocephala and Lysiloma latisiliquum at the young forest site, and A. gaumeri, Bursera simaruba and Pithecellobium dulce at the old forest. Four independent plots (12 x 12 m) at each forest were either left intact (controls) or fertilized with N, with P, or with N plus P for three consecutive years. Relaxation of nutrient limitations at the young forest resulted in an increase in leaf phosphorus and herbivory in all species. In contrast, N and P fertilization at the old forest site did not consistently affect leaf nutrient concentration and leaf damage. In this site the main response to fertilization was an increase in leaf nitrogen only in B. simaruba and an increase in herbivory in A. gaumeri; leaf phosphorus was unaffected by soil fertilization. Overall, we observed that, subsequent to nutrient addition, leaf phosphorus concentration and herbivory in the leguminous species increased at the young site; leaf nitrogen concentration in the non-leguminous species increased at the old site while herbivory only increased in A. gaumeri, following a pattern similar to that observed in the young site. We conclude that the regulatory mechanisms of leaf quality and damage by herbivores will vary, depending on the details of the site's nutrient limitations and the identity of species.

AB  - The study was carried out to evaluate leucaena seeds as a protein replacement of mustard seed cake (MSC) in the concentrate mixture of growing lambs. Fifteen growing male lambs (Local×Corridale) with an average body weight of 16.3 kg were allocated into three dietary treatments (T1, T2, and T3) with five animals in each group. Animals were offered dry mixed grass, berseem hay and concentrate mixture to meet their nutrient requirements. In concentrate mixture of T1, (Control) MSC was used as protein source, while in T2 and T3 groups, 25 and 50% of MSC was replaced by leucaena leucocephala seeds. On completion of three months (90 days) of feeding, a digestion cum-metabolism trial was conducted to determine DMI, nutrient utilization, and nitrogen balance. Changes in body weight were recorded at 15 day internals and eating patterns were recorded for 3 consecutive days at the end of the feeding trial. MSC had higher CP contents than leucaena seeds (27.0%). Mimosine contents in leucaena seeds were 1.1 compared to 0.2 and 0.4% in concentrate mixture of T2 and T3 group, respectively. Dry matter intake varied non-significantly (79.3±1.2 to 83.4±1.3 g/kg w0.75) across the dietary treatments. Digestibility of DM and cell wall polysaccharides (NDF, ADF. Cellulose and hemicellulose) were comparable, however CP digestibility was relatively lower in leucaena luecocephala seeds based groups (T2 45.5±1.7 and T3 46.7±3.5) compared to MSC supplemented group (T1 47.7±0.9%). The growth rate of lambs was non-significantly higher in T1 (79.2±5.4) compared to T2 (73.8±8.8) and T3 (73.9±7.0), respectively. The animals were in positive nitrogen balance and N-balance varied from 1.8 to 2.9 g/d across treatment groups. The eating rate (% of total offered) of concentrate up-to 15 min was relatively higher in T1 (82.4) than T2 (74.2) and T3 (77.8%). However no effect of leucaena seeds was recorded on total DMI of animals. The results of the study revealed that the inclusion of up to 50% leucaena seeds, as protein source in concentrate mixture of lambs had no adverse effect on DMI, nutrient utilization, eating patterns, nitrogen balance and growth performance of lambs.

AB  - An experiment with a random block design was performed to study the possible differences in the chemical indicators: dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ash, organic matter (OM), organic matter digestibility (OMD), acid detergent fiber (ADF), lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose and secondary metabolites (tannins, mimosine and DHP) of different Leucaena leucocephala ecotypes (CIAT-932, 7872, 7930, 7988, 7929, 9379, 9101 and Peru) in both seasons. Differences (P < 0.01) and (P < 0.001) between both ecotypes were found in CP in both seasons, while DM, ash, OM and OMD had variations. The indicators related to the lignocellulosic compound showed a different performance (P < 0.001) between the ecotypes in each season. However, there were no differences in the secondary metabolites with values lower than 2.5, 4. 5 and 1.5% for tannins, mimosine and DHP, respectively. The results demonstrate that the ecotypes studied have high quality in the seasons studied. However, from the chemical composition standpoint, the ecotypes differed statistically in some indicators. These differences in the chemical constituents may not have biological relevance in ruminant animals. For clarifying possible biological differences in the contribution of some of these ecotypes to ruminants, further studies on nutrient degradation in the rumen and its contribution to the animal are suggested.

TI  - Hedgerow species and environmental conditions effects on soil total C and N and C and N mineralization patterns of soils amended with their prunings
PY  - 2003
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037265823&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1021837216311&partnerID=40&md5=b413f14adae79e5a2c11950bed50324d
AB  - An important criterium in selecting species for alley cropping is the mineralization pattern of their prunings. This study determined effects of 5 years of hedgerow pruning applications on soil organic C and total N at three locations in Haiti and mineralization patterns from soil amended with the prunings during an incubation using micro-lysimeters. Soils (0-5 cm) under 5 hedgerows were collected at each site and analyzed for organic C and total N. In the laboratory, ground leaves and stems (< 1 cm diameter) of the hedgerow species were mixed with soil at rates of 3 and 1.5 Mg ha-1, respectively, and aerobically incubated in the dark at 25°C. A non-amended soil was used as control. Soils were leached to determine mineral N at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 84 and 120 days of incubation. Evolved CO2 was measured following each leaching procedure. At the calcareous site, application of prunings from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit and Delonix regia (Boj. ex Hook. Raf.) resulted in 23 and 13% higher soil N than the control, respectively, after 5 years. There were no differences in total N at the other sites but soil N was highest under Leucaena hybrid and Acacia angustissima (Mill.) Kuntze, respectively at the basaltic and high elevation sites. Soils under D. regia (calcareous) and A. angustissima and Leucaena hybrid (high elevation) had higher organic C than the respective controls. Carbon and N mineralization and C turnover were highest when soils were amended with leaves of Leucaena diversifolia (Schlecht.) Benth (calcareous and basaltic soils) and A. angustissima (high elevation) and lowest in non-amended control soils. Stem-amended soils showed differences in C mineralization for calcareous and high elevation soils whereas N mineralization was similar among treatments within sites. Carbon and N mineralization (high elevation soil) correlated positively with N concentrations of leaf prunings. Amendments with leaf prunings increased soil C and N mineralization and turnover rates, suggesting greater nutrient availability for the crop during a short period than in non-amended control soils.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) has an important effect on the physicochemical status of highly weathered soils in the tropics. This work was conducted to determine the contribution of different SOM fractions to the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of a tropical soil and to study the effect of organic matter inputs of different biochemical composition on the CEC of SOM. Soil samples were collected from a 20-year-old arboretum established on a Ferric Lixisol, under seven multipurpose tree species: Afzelia africana, Dactyladenia barteri, Gliricidia sepium, Gmelina arborea, Leucaena leucocephala, Pterocarpus santalinoides, and Treculia africana. Fractions were obtained by wet sieving and sedimentation after ultrasonic dispersion. Relationships between CEC and pH were determined using the silver thiourea-method and were described by linear regression. The CEC of the fractions smaller than 0.053 mm was inversely related to their particle size: clay (<0.002 mm) > fine silt (0.002-0.02 mm) > coarse silt (0.02-0.053 mm), except for the soils under T. africana, D. barteri, and L. leucocephala, where the CEC of the fine silt fraction was highest or comparable to the CEC of the clay fraction. The clay and fine silt fractions were responsible for 76-90% of the soil CEC at pH 5.8. The contribution of the fine silt fraction to the CEC at pH 5.8 ranged from 35 to 50%, which stressed the importance of the fine silt fraction for the physicochemical properties of the soil. Differences in CEC between treatments for the whole soil and the fractions could be explained by the differences in carbon content. Except for the intercept for the clay fraction, SOM had a significant (P < 0.001) contribution to both the intercepts (=estimated CEC at pH 0) and slopes (=pH-dependent charge) of the CEC-pH relationships for the whole soil and the fractions. The CEC of SOM at pH 5.8 varied between 283 cmolc kg-1 C for particulate organic matter, and 563 cmolc kg-1 C for the fine silt fraction. The biochemical composition of the organic inputs did not have an important effect on the CEC of SOM. In total, SOM was responsible for 75-85% of the CEC of these soils. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Intake and digestibility of Acacia glomerosa (A) and Leucaena leucocephala (L), mixed with ammoniated rice straw (ARS) and maize by-product flour (CB) was evaluated for growing goats. Eight goats were used (21 kg average liveweight). A factorial arrangement 2x2, in Latin square design was conducted. The factors were 2 vegetal species and 2 inclusion levels. The study was conducted in 56 days. The cell wall intake (NDF) was superior for A vs L (652.13 vs 535.3 g/goat/day). Digestibility of organic matter (OM) was superior for A vs L (79.83 vs 71.37%). The same occurred with: NDF (83.19 vs 76.85%) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) (81.82 vs 67.39%). Higher intake of dry matter (DM) occurred at the smallest inclusion level (18.75%). Further, the low inclusion level showed higher digestibility of DM, OM, NDF and ADF than the high inclusion level.

AB  - The widespread planting of Sesbania sesban fallows for replenishing soil fertility in eastern Zambia has the potential of causing pest outbreaks in the future. The pure S. sesban fallows may not produce enough biomass needed for replenishing soil fertility in degraded soils. Therefore, an experiment was conducted at Kagoro in Katete district in the Eastern Province of Zambia from 1997 to 2002 to test whether multi-species fallows, combining non-coppicing with coppicing tree species, are better than mono-species fallows of either species for soil improvement and increasing subsequent maize yields. Mono-species fallows of S. sesban (non-coppicing), Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia angustissima (all three coppicing), and mixed fallows of G. sepium + S. sesban, L. leucocephala + S. sesban. A. angustissima + S. sesban and natural fallow were compared over a three-year period. Two maize (Zea mays) crops were grown subsequent to the fallows. The results established that S. sesban is poorly adapted and G. sepium is superior to other species for degraded soils. At the end of three years, sole G. sepium fallow produced the greatest total biomass of 22.1 Mg ha-1 and added 27 kg ha -1 more N to soil than G. sepium + S. sesban mixture. During the first post-fallow year, the mixed fallow at 3.8 Mg ha-1 produced 77% more coppice biomass than sole G. sepium, whereas in the second year both sole G. sepium and the mixture produced similar amounts of biomass (1.6 to 1.8 Mg ha-1). The G. sepium + S. sesban mixture increased water infiltration rate more than sole G. sepium, but both these systems had similar effects in reducing soil resistance to penetration compared with continuous maize without fertilizer. Although sole G. sepium produced high biomass, it was G. sepium + S. sesban mixed fallow which resulted in 33% greater maize yield in the first post-fallow maize. However, both these G. sepium-based fallows had similar effects on the second post-fallow maize. Thus the results are not conclusive on the beneficial effects of G. sepium + S. sesban mixture over sole G. sepium.

AB  - Growing of trees as woodlots on farms for five to seven years in rotation with crops was considered as a potential technology to overcome the shortage of wood, which is a common problem to many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The paper summarizes the results of trials conducted at Tabora and Shinyanga in northwestern Tanzania on rotational woodlots, to evaluate tree species for wood production and yields of maize grown in association with and after harvest of trees. On acid sandy soils at Tabora, Acacia crassicarpa A. Cunn. ex Benth. grew fast and produced 24 to 77 Mg ha-1 of wood in four to five years. On alkaline Vertisols at Shinyanga, seven years old woodlots of Acacia polyacantha Willd. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit. produced 71 and 89 Mg ha-1 of wood, respectively. Intercropping of maize between trees was possible for two years without sacrificing its yield. The first maize crop following A. crassicarpa woodlots gave 29 to 113% greater yield than the crop after natural fallow. Acacia polyacantha and L. leucocephala woodlots also increased the subsequent maize yields over a three-year period. The increase in crop yields after woodlots was attributed partly to accumulation of greater amounts of inorganic N in the topsoil compared to the traditional fallow, and partly to other effects. Thus medium-term rotational woodlots are likely to contribute to meet the wood requirements of rural people and thereby help protect the natural woodlands in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Leucine gum was isolated from seeds of Leucaena leucocephala and oxidised using sodium chlorite varying the concentration of the oxidising agent and the pH of the oxidising medium. The products were analysed to determine their acidogenic and reducing properties. The rheological properties of the oxidised products were studied as was their use as thickening agents in printing polyester fabrics with disperse dyes. It was shown that the acidogenic and reducing properties increase with an increase in the concentration of sodium chlorite. Pastes with the oxidised gum are characterised by non-Newtonian plastic behaviour and their viscosity depends on the concentration of the oxidising agent. It was concluded that the oxidised gum can be used successfully in printing polyester with disperse dyes.

AB  - Two experiments were designed to investigate the effect of legume tree-pods and ensiling on the intake and relative palatability of six feeds by goats and sheep. In the first experiment, the feeds offered were pasture hay (Themeda triandra), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), pods of Acacia sieberiana, Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala. In the second, silage from the pods of A. sieberiana was included as the sixth feed in order to examine the effect of ensiling on intake and palatability since this process was devised as a means of detoxifying cyanogenic glocosides known to be present in the leaves and pods of this species. Intake (Ti) and relative palatability (Pi) were determined using 3 goats and 3 sheep in each experiment. Since the feeds had different dry matter contents, intake was expressed as a ratio of the quantity offered (Ti/Ai). Using the hay offered (A1) and intake (T1), as standard, relative palatability indices were calculated as Pi = (Ti/Ai)/(T1/A1) where i represented the other feeds. In experiment 1, goats consumed more hay than alfalfa or pods. Sheep consumed more leucaena than all the other feeds. In experiment 2, the intake of all feeds except nilotica increased over time. Hay and leucaena had the highest Pi for goats and sheep, respectively, in experiment 1. In experiment 2, silage from pods of A. sieberiana had the highest Pi while the ranking for goats remained unchanged. The nilotica meal had the lowest Pi in both experiments. Pi was affected (p < 0.0001) only by feed type in experiment 1 but in experiment 2, feed type, animal species and weight significantly (p < 0.01) affected Pi. The results show that the pods of L. leucocephala and A. nilotica were the most and least preferred by goats and sheep, respectively, and that ensiling significantly improved the intake and palatability of the pods of A. sieberiana. However, some feeds that are least preferred in times of abundance and variety could be relished during periods of scarcity and severe feed shortages, based on animal survival instinct.

AB  - A study was undertaken to determine the effect of different benzylaminopurine (BAP) concentrations on the in vitro micropropagation of Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru. The Murashige and Skoog culture medium with vitamins B5 was used. The influence often BAP concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 mg/L) and a control treatment without hormones on the average height of the plantlets, the percentage of plantlets and the number of plantlets/explant was determined by a completely randomized design with three repetitions. All the concentrations (0-10 mg/L of BAP) showed the same responses in the percentage of plantlets with values between 30 and 70%. The highest average height of the plantlets was obtained with 0, 2, 3,4 and 9 mg/L of BAP with values between 2.13 and 2.40 cm (P < 0.001), compared to 6 mg/L, without differences with the rest of the treatments. The number of plantlets/explant (2-3) did not vary with the different concentrations, except the control with the smallest (P < 0.001) number. It is concluded that, from an economic point of view, a concentration of 1 mg/L should be used for the micropropagation of this species.

AB  - Charcoals were prepared under various conditions of carbonization from three kinds of plants: balsa (Ochroma lagopus Sw), giant ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) and mousou chiku (Phyllostachys pubescens). The pore structure of the various charcoals was observed on fractured cross-sections under SEM and was evaluated utilizing mercury porosimetry. The sorption capacity of the charcoals for A-grade heavy oil was determined by direct soaking in oil. It was found that the pore structure of the charcoals depended strongly on, not only, the precursor plants but also carbonization conditions, particularly heating rate. Balsa charcoals prepared with a heating rate of 50°C/min. under vacuum gave a relatively high sorption capacity for A-grade oil, approximately 30 g/g of charcoal. The other two charcoals, derived from giant ipil-ipil and Mousou chiku, had a considerably lower capacity, approximately 1.5g/g-carbon. The dependence of pore occupancy, the ratio of volume of oil sorbed to total pore volume, on the average pore radius indicated that pores with a diameter above 1μm were largely responsible for heavy oil sorption.

AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta, Crantz), an annual tropical tuber crop, was nutritionally evaluated as a foliage forruminants, especially dairy cattle. Cultivation of cassava biomass to produce hay is based on a first harvest of the foliage at three monthsafter planting, followed every two months thereafter until one year. Inter-cropping of leguminous fodder as food-feed between rows of cassava, such as Leucaena leucocephala or cowpea (Vigna unculata), enriches soil fertility and provides additional fodder. Cassava haycontained 20 to 25% crude protein in the dry matter with good profile of amino acids. Feeding trials with cattle revealed high levels of DM intake (3.2% of BW) and high DM digestibility (71%). The hay contains tannin-protein complexes which could act as rumen by - pass protein for digestion in the small intestine. As cassava hay contains condensed tannins, it could have subsequent impact onchanging rumen ecology particularly changing rumen microbes population. Therefore, supplementation with cassava hay at 1-2 kg/hd/dto dairy cattle could markedly reduce concentrate requirements, and increase milk yield and composition. Moreover, cassava hay supplementation in dairy cattle could increase milk thiocyanate which could possibly enhance milk quality and milk storage, especially in small holder-dairy farming. Condensed tannins contained in cassava hay have also been shown to potentially reduce gastrointestinal nematodes in ruminants and therefore could act as an anthelmintic agent. Cassava hay is therefore an excellent multi-nutrient source for animals, especially for dairy cattle during the long dry season, and has the potential to increase the productivity and profitability of sustainable livestock production systems in the tropics.

AB  - Ten core soil samples were collected from experimental plots at IITA, SW Nigeria that were previously inoculated with Rhizobium strains (IRC 1045 and IRC 1050) specific for Leucaena leucocephala at two depths; 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm. The control soil samples were collected at similar depths from an adjacent field with no previous history of legume cultivation. Six weeks after planting of L. leucocephala in the soil samples in the greenhouse shoots, roots and nodules were harvested aseptically. Typing of the nodules as well as the identification of the persisting population of the introduced strains were based on the intrinsic resistance of IRC 1045 and IRC 1050 to streptomycin at 500 μg/ml and nodules were found to be made up of 100% of previously introduced strains. The potency and competitive ability of the recovered IRC 1045 and IRC 1050 were thus confirmed via the pot experiment and plant reinfection experiment in the greenhouse. At 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depths 8.0 × 104 and 9.0 × 104 rhizobia/g of soil were recovered respectively in spite of the 10-year fallow period. Biomass production with the three woody legumes revealed Root and Shoot dry weights of the following order of magnitude Senna siamea 〉 L. leucocephala 〉 Senna spectabilis. This report showed the great potential of application of Rhizobium technology in low input sustainable agricultural practice and environmental pollution abatement for non-use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers.

AB  - The effect of different levels of polyethyleneglycol (PEG-3500) (0.90 and 180 g of PEG/kg of DM) on the in situ ruminal effective degradability (ED) of nutrients (DM, CP, NDF and ADF) and on the content of condensed tannins bound to the protein (CT-P) and to the fiber (CT-F) in Leucaena leucocephala cv CIAT-7929 was studied. A random block design was used with three replications per treatment. Bags were incubated in the rumen during 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. The effet of the PEG level on the in vitro intestinal digestibility of nitrogen was determined. There were differences (P < 0.01) in the CT-F content, according to the PEG level, while the CT-P did not respond to the treatment with polyethyleneglycol. There were differences (P < 0.05) between the control and the treatment with 90 g in crude protein degradability (CPD). The degradability of DM, NDF and ADF varied more (P < 0.01) per treatment, independently of the constants of ruminal re-change (k). The dynamics of ruminal degradation had a significant increase, in regards to the incubation time established. This provoked the formation of asymptotes between the curves of each indicator in the last hours. There were significant differences between the control and the PEG concentrations in the in vitro intestinal digestibility of the nitrogen, although there were no differences between both treatments. Coefficients of determination R2 > 0.64 were obtained in the linear regression equations for the ED of the NDF, ADF and TC-F, according to the level of PEG. These results are useful for further studies, in which marker techniques may be used to determine the role of the microbial and diet nitrogen of this legume.

AB  - Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 can catabolize mimosine, a toxic amino acid produced by the tree-legume leucaena. The mid and pyd genes involved in mimosine degradation in TAL1145 are located in two clusters within a 25-kb region in the chromosome, which was cloned in plasmid pUHR263. A 5.5-kb EcoRI fragment, located between the mid and pyd genes in pUHR263, was characterized by sequencing and transposon-insertion mutagenesis and six open reading frames (ORF) were identified. Based on high homologies with other known proteins and conserved signature domains, ORF1 and ORF2 were identified as fba and fbp genes, encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) and fructose-1,6- bisphosphatase (FBP), respectively. The fba mutant showed a slightly reduced growth rate compared to TAL1145 while the fbp mutant did not show any growth defects. Both mutants could catabolize mimosine and formed normal nitrogen-fixing nodules on leucaena, suggesting that these genes are not involved in mimosine degradation and symbiosis.

TI  - Pruning management effects on soil carbon and nitrogen in contour-hedgerow cropping with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit on sloping land in Haiti
PY  - 2003

AB  - Application of hedgerow prunings to the soil in alley cropping is practiced to sustain crop yield but information is lacking on effects of hedgerow management on soil C and N dynamics under continuous cropping. Cumulative effects of 3.5 years of leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit] hedgerow management on soil organic C and N and potential C and N mineralization were determined in an alley cropping experiment in Haiti. Treatments were combinations of pruning uses and pruning regimes in a 3 × 3 factorial with a no-tree control (rock walls) in a randomized complete block design with 3 replicates. A hedgerow + fertilizer treatment in an adjacent trial was included for comparison. Soil samples collected at 0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm depths were sealed in mason jars and incubated at 25°C for 30 days. Organic C and N and inorganic N were measured before the incubation. Inorganic N and respired CO2-C were measured after the incubation. After 3.5 years, surface soil samples with prunings applied as mulch or incorporated at planting had, respectively, 20 and 16% higher organic C, 34 and 18% higher organic N concentrations, higher potential C and N mineralization and higher relative N mineralization than with prunings removed. Soil C and N dynamics were similar between pruning application methods. The two-cut regime with a longer regrowth period after cutting (0-40 DAP) had highest organic C in the 0-20 cm soil layer whereas two-cut with a shorter regrowth period (0-30 DAP) had highest C turnover. Within soil layers, pruning application had higher organic C and N and potential C and N mineralization than the no-tree control and alley plots with prunings removed in the 0-5 cm layer whereas the latter treatments had similar C and N dynamics at all depths. Addition of N-P-K fertilizer in presence of fresh prunings did not increase soil organic C and N but enhanced N dynamics in the surface soil.

AB  - The use of biopolymers in many industrial processes is on the increase. The different interactions of biopolymers and electrolytes either in aqueous solutions or in solid state provide different physico-chemical properties and a simple correlation cannot be established. In this study, in order to determine the properties of the complexes of galactomannan of Leucaena leucocephala (gal) with the metal ions Al3+ and Pb2+, toxic elements and Cu2+, essential, the logs of the binding constants of the complexes formed in the aqueous solutions were calculated. Their rheological properties, their thermal behavior, the infrared characteristics and shape and form of the films formed by those complexes in solid state were also determined. The aqueous solutions properties have shown a better complexation between gal and Al3+. The species distribution diagrams have shown an existence of complex species going from acidic to basic pH values. Infrared spectra have proved the complexations as well as the viscosity studies. Thermal stabilities in general were smaller in the complexed species than in the native biopolymers and the films obtained from aqueous solutions showed for Cu2+ the most different morphology compared to the biopolymer itself. A use can be suggested of this biopolymer in environmental remediations besides its already stablished industrial uses. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and water retention in roots of four different agroforestry trees intercropped with maize in a semiarid area at Machacos, Kenya, were studied. A randomized block design with four replicates and five treatments consisting of Melia volkensii, Senna spectabilis, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and control (treeless plots) was established. In each plot, spore extraction and AMF identification were carried out. Tree root samples from each treatment were collected and assessed for mycorrhizal infection and root water content. The results indicated that the trees under study associated with five genera of AMF. These were Acaulaspora, Glomus, Gigaspora, Scuttelospora and Entrophospora, of which the latter two were not numerous. When compared to other tree species and with treeless plots, plots with Melia volkensii had a significantly higher number of AMF spores (P<0.05) in each genus. Root infection percentages were also significantly higher (P<0.05) in Melia volkensii as compared to Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, and Senna spectabilis. Correlation existed between AMF root infection % and AMF spore number in the soil (P = 0.7, P<0.05). Root water content was significantly higher (P<0.05) in Melia volkensii as compared to the other trees, and a significant correlation (P = 0.9, P<0.05) between AMF root infection % and water retention in the roots was also found.

AB  - A legume introduced into a new area will only form nodules and fix nitrogen if compatible rhizobia are present in the soil. Using 25 (60 in the case of Sesbania sesban) soils sampled from tropical areas of Africa, Asia and Latin America, we examined the nodulation of four agroforestry tree species (Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and S. sesban), their symbiotic interactions with the native rhizobial populations, and some of the ecological indicators of rhizobial population dynamics. Rhizobial population sizes estimated by the legume species ranged from undetectable numbers to 3.16 × 104 cells per g of soil depending on the trap host species. Although C. calothyrsus had the highest nodulation rate in the soils used, inoculation tests showed L. leucocephala to be the most promiscuous species while G. sepium had the most effective symbiosis. S. sesban was the most specific for both nodulation and symbiotic effectiveness. Symbiotic effectiveness did not bear any close relationship with specific soil parameters, but rhizobial numbers were highly correlated with soil acidity, particle size and exchangeable bases. Soil acidity was also the main factor that was highly correlated with genetic diversity among the rhizobial populations. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A mixture simplex design (special cubic version of Scheffé's canonical polynomial) was used to investigate associative effects of feed mixtures incubated using an in vitro gas production technique. The model included the principal effects (single feeds), double and multiple interaction (mixtures of two and three feeds). Two forage trees (Leucaena leucocephala and Lysiloma latisiliquum) were evaluated in two separate incubation batches. Commercial concentrate feed, grass hay and a fodder tree were used to prepare the mixtures in all possible combinations resulting from 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 of grass, concentrate and one forage tree per batch. Pressure and gas volumes were monitored up to 168 h. After incubation the residues were used to measure DM and OM digestibility (in vitro dry matter (IVDMD) and in vitro organic matter (IVOMD)). Cumulative gas production (CGP (ml)) profiles were fitted to the equation CGP = a + b(1 - e-kt). A significant associative response in total gas production (P < 0.01) was found when the forage trees were mixed with the concentrate but not with the grass. Grass and concentrate mixtures increased gas production but the interaction was significant only in the L. latisiliquum batch (P < 0.05). IVDMD and IVOMD were reduced by the inclusion of leucaena in the mixture (P < 0.01). Rate of gas production, k (% h-1) was significantly depressed when L. latisiliquum was a component of the mixture (P < 0.01) but not in all remaining mixtures, including those that contained leucaena. It was concluded that mixture simplex designs are useful tools to identify and study in vitro associative effects of feed mixtures. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was carried out on three nitrogen (N2)-fixing tree legumes, i.e., Gliricidia sepium cv. ILG50, Leucaena leucocephala cv. K28, and Albizia lebbeck to assess their differential phosphorus (P) nutrition capability over time. Dry-matter (DM) yields, P concentration, P uptake and partitioning in plants, and P use efficiency were estimated at 4, 8, 12, and 16 months after planting (MAP). The trees showed a large interspecific variation both in DM yields and P uptake. Concentration of P ranged from 0.042 to 0.275% and varied both among parts in each tree and among tree species over time. Leaves P concentrations showed a greater reduction with tree age than either stems or roots. Phosphorus uptake correlated significantly with plant DM (r = 0.893-0.946) across tree species, and had a steady increasing pattern up to at least 12 MAP. Over ages, Gliricidia out-performed the other species in P uptake. However, Leucaena was the most efficient user of P followed by Albizia and Gliricidia, in that order. Further, Leucaena revealed an attractive feature for alley cropping in that it stored up to 37% of the P accumulated in its leaves in contrast to only 24.1% for Gliricidia and 19.2% for Albizia. Therefore, the low P supply by trees into alley cropping is in part due to its unbalanced partitioning into stems to the expenses of leaves. The study shows also that P concentration in perennials is lower than it is reported in annual crops.

AB  - Leaf samples of mine browse species, viz., breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), calliandra (Calliandra callothyrus), dadap (Erythrina spp), gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), fleminga (Fleminga macrophylla), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), sesbania (Sesbania drandiflora), mullberry (Morus alba), and vi (Spondias mombin) were collected in the dry and the rainy season from five countries in the South Pacific Region) (Cook Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu). The samples were evaluated for comparative seasonal concentration of P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn for grazing beef cattle, dairy cattle (dry and lactating), heifers, and goats. Macro- and micro-mineral concentrations in the browse species were affected by seasonal climatic conditions. Some of the browse species had higher concentrations of macro- and micro-minerals in either the dry or rainy seasons above the requirements of specific ruminant animals. The Fe concentration in most of the browse species was higher (P < 0.05) in the dry season compared to the rainy season. The Zn concentration was extremely low in the browse species. Some browse species met the macro- and micro-mineral requirements of grazing beef cattle, dairy cattle (dry and lactating), heifers, and goats, while others could not satisfy all the mineral requirements of specific ruminant animals. The seasonal variations in the concentration of the macro- and micro-minerals suggest that, in formulating and (or) supplementing rations for ruminants, both the amount of minerals in legumes and biological availability of these minerals need to be considered in the South Pacific Region. © 2003 Trop.

AB  - A study was designed to examine the relationships between protein, condensed tannin and cell wall carbohydrate content and composition and the nutritional quality of seven tropical legumes (Desmodium ovalifolium, Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala, L palllda, L macrophylla, Calliandra calothyrsus and Clitoria fairchildiana). Among the legume species studied, D ovalifolium showed the lowest concentration of nitrogen, while L leucocephala showed the highest. Fibre (NDF) content was lowest in C calothyrsus, L Leucocephala and L pallida and highest in L macrophylla, which had no measurable condensed tannins. The highest tannin concentration was found in C calothyrsus. Total non-structural polysaccharides (NSP) varied among legumes species (lowest in C calothyrsus and highest in D ovalifolium), and glucose and uronic acids were the most abundant carbohydrate constituents in all legumes. Total NSP losses were lowest in F macrophylla and highest in L leucocephala and L pallida. Gas accumulation and acetate and propionate levels were 50% less with F macrophylla and D ovalifolium as compared with L leucocephala. The highest levels of branched-chain fatty acids were observed with non-tanniniferous legumes, and negative concentrations were observed with some of the legumes with high tannin content (D ovalifolium and F macrophylla). Linear regression analysis showed that the presence of condensed tannins was more related to a reduction of the initial rate of gas production (0-48 h) than to the final amount of gas produced or the extent (144h) of dry matter degradation, which could be due to differences in tannin chemistry. Consequently, more attention should be given in the future to elucidating the impact of tannin structure on the nutritional quality of tropical forage legumes. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The study was carried out to evaluate the soil water content under four species of nitrogen fixing trees (NFTs) interplanted with coconuts (Cocos nucifera L.) in gravelly soils in Sri Lanka. The NFTs (viz., Calliandra calothyrsus, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia auriculiformis and Gliricidia sepium) were planted when the coconut palms were 38 years old. Seven years after planting NFTs, the soil water content was monitored weekly during the dry period extending from the base of the coconut palm towards the NFT species, using a neutron moisture meter. Results showed that NFT-interplanted plots had higher water content than the sole stand of coconuts, with the gliricidia- and acacia plots having higher water content than leucaena- and calliandra plots. Water loss from the topsoil (0 to 20 cm depth) in the NFT-interplanted plots was significantly lower than from the bare soil. The NFT species extracted soil water mainly from the 20 to 100 cm layer. Calliandra extracted a significantly higher amount of water from the top soil, leucaena extracted more water from beyond 100-cm depth. Among the NFT-interplanted plots, the acacia and gliricidia plots conserved more water in the soil.

AB  - The economic feasibility of increasing biomass production in dairy units was evaluated from the introduction of Leucaena leucocephala in 100% of the grazing area of guinea likoni (Panicum maximum cv Likoni) intercropping also seasonal crops (cowpea, mucuna, desmodium and corn) in some areas to guarantee the supply of feeds at the beginning of the system exploitation, not affecting the productive processes. The study was developed in an experimental unit at the Institute of Animal Science for five years. Expenses were recorded for each of the crops and the expenses in milk production costs were assessed. The indicators value of production, economic gain, unitary cost and benefit/cost ratio were evaluated. The relationship (%) among the fixed and the variable expenses, other cost elements and total expenses and those of the variables was estimated. From the flows of the cash register, the internal return rate was studied. Feeding expenses were lower than those reported for this activity (30%) and the relationship between variable expenses/ value of the production showed the possibility of covering the expenses with a lower influence on the level of incomes. The investment process and the prices of the main inputs affected negatively the economic indicators in the first three years. They were positive after the fourth year of work. The internal return rate (RR) was favorable according to orientations for this branch (41%). The associated areas (guinea grass-legume) increased annually their contribution and provide 71% of the forages in the dry season. For the farmer, the use of similar silvopastoral systems can be a feasible alternative from the economic standpoint in the current conditions of Cuban cattle raising.

AB  - Serine proteinase inhibitors are widely distributed in nature and inhibit the activity of enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin. These proteins interfere with the physiological processes such as germination, maturation and form the first line of defense against the attack of seed predator. The most thoroughly examined plant serine proteinase inhibitors are found in the species of the families Leguminosae, Graminae, and Solanaceae. Leucaena leucocephala belongs to the family Leguminosae. It is widely used both as an ornamental tree as well as cattle food. We have constructed a three-dimensional model of a serine proteinase inhibitor from L. leucocephala seeds (LTI) complexed with trypsin. The model was built based on its comparative homology with soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) using the program, MODELLER6. The quality of the model was assessed stereochemically by PROCHECK. LTI shows structural features characteristic of the Kunitz type trypsin inhibitor and shows 39% residue identity with STI. LTI consists of 172 amino acid residues and is characterized by two disulfide bridges. The protein is a dimer with the two chains being linked by a disulfide bridge. Despite the high similarity in the overall tertiary structure, significant differences exist at the active site between STI and LTI. The present study aims at analyzing these interactions based on the available amino acid sequences and structural data. We have also studied some functional sites such as phosphorylation, myristoylation, which can influence the inhibitory activity or complexation with other molecules. Some of the differences observed at the active site and functional sites can explain the unique features of LTI. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forty male pigs (43.4 ± 6.2 kg of liveweight) housed in metabolism crates were used to evaluate the effect of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM) treated with acetic acid (AA) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in pig diets, on coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and nitrogen balance (NB). The experimental diets included 200 g LLM kg-1 which had been treated with four levels (0, 30, 60 and 90 g kg-1 DM) of AA or NaOH, respectively as chemical treatments. The experiment was conducted in two periods: 7 days for adaptation, and 7 days for total urine and faeces collection. There were no differences (P > 0.05) between treatments (AA and NaOH) on CTTAD of DM, OM and CP. However, CTTAD of NDF was higher (P < 0.05) in pigs fed diets with LLM treated with AA (0.49) than in pigs fed diets with LLM treated with NaOH (0.44). There were no differences (P > 0.05) on apparent digestibility between levels of treatments (0, 30, 60 and 90 g kg-1). Nitrogen retained was higher (P < 0.05) in pigs fed diets that included LLM treated with level 30 g kg-1 of AA or NaOH (11.2 g per day) in comparison to pigs fed diets with LLM treated with 0, 60 and 90 g kg-1 (4.6, 7.3 and 6.7 g per day, respectively) as seen from the quadratic response. The results obtained in the current work suggest that treating LLM with 30 g kg-1 of AA or NaOH increased nitrogen retention in growing pigs. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The natural rhizobial populations of Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania sesban were assessed in soils from nine sites across tropical areas of three continents. The rhizobial population size varied from undetectable numbers to 1.8 × 104 cells/g of soil depending on the trap host and the soil. Calliandra calothyrsus was the most promiscuous legume, nodulating in eight soils, while S. sesban nodulated in only one of the soils. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and the internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes were used to assess the diversity and relative abundance of rhizobia trapped from seven of the soils by C. calothyrsus, G. sepium and L. leucocephala. Representatives of the 16S rRNA RFLP groups were also subjected to sequence analysis of the first 950 base pairs of the 16S rRNA gene. Eighty ITS groups were obtained, with none of the ITS types being sampled in more than one soil. RFLP analysis of the 16S rRNA yielded 23 'species' groups distributed among the Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium and Agrobacterium branches of the rhizobial phylogenetic tree. The phylogeny of the isolates was independent of the site or host of isolation, with different rhizobial groups associated with each host across the soils from widely separated geographical regions. Although rhizobial populations in soils sampled from the centre of diversity of the host legumes were the most genetically diverse, soil acidity was highly correlated with the diversity of ITS types. Our results support the hypothesis that the success of these tree legumes in soils throughout the tropics is the result of their relative promiscuity (permissiveness) allowing nodulation with diverse indigenous rhizobial types.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala var. K-8 is a fast-growing, tropical leguminous tree that has multiple economic uses. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect(s) of varying NaCl concentrations on growth, N2 fixation, and percentage of total tissue nitrogen in different organs in L. leucocephala. Seeds were germinated and grown for 10 wk with a nitrogen-free fertilizer applied every 2 wk. At 10 wk, plants were treated for either 0, 7, 14, 21, or 28 wk with either deionized water (control), 0.00625 mol/L, 0.0125 mol/L, 0.025 mol/L, 0.05 mol/L, or 0.1 mol/L NaCl in addition to the fertilizer every 2 wk. Growth was measured as plant height, nodule number and mass, and dry tissue mass. N2 fixation was measured by the acetylene reduction assay. Percentage of tissue nitrogen was determined using Kjeldahl analysis. In younger plants (7-wk treatment), major fluctuations in NaCl tolerance were observed in the different plant organs. As plants matured (14- and 21-wk treatment) NaCl concentrations of 0.025 mol/L and higher caused the greatest reduction in growth and tissue nitrogen. We conclude that NaCl concentrations of 0.025 mol/L and greater caused a major decrease in growth, N2 fixation, and percentage of tissue nitrogen in L. leucocephala plants that were less than 1 yr old.

AB  - The objective of this work was to establish the influence of breeding ram and feeding on performance of lambs in confinement. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a 2x4 factorial arrangement. The treatments were two genetic groups (Santa Inês x not defined breed (NDB) and Somalis x NDB) and concentrate (corn, soybean meal plus mineral salt) at 15%, 30%, 45% and 60%. Thirty two animals were confined in individual stalls and each was one repetition. The diets were composed by concentrate and roughage, leucaena hay (Leucaena leucocephala), as a complete ration. The slaughter weight increased and the feed efficiency improved (P<0.05) as concentrate in diet was increased. A quadratic effect on dry matter intake and organic matter intake with maximum values of 35.29% and 35.36%, respectively, was observed. All estimated gross margin were positive. There was no difference (P>0.05) among concentrates; however, the genetic group Somalis x NDB was superior (P<0.05) to Santa Inês x NDB.

AB  - A research was conducted, for two years, to evaluate the production of seeds in 90 accessions of Leucaena leucocephala from the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) in Colombia. The multivariate analysis was used. The method of principal components showed that more than 90% of the variability, accumulated in three factors, was from the morphological indicators of yield, length and number of seeds/pods, weight of 1000 seeds and total weight of seed production/plant, in the analysis of the first and second year and in both. The method of conglomerates (clusters) made possible the obtainment of groups that were reordered according to their biological performance and, at the same time, the accessions were grouped according to their similarities. There were groups of good performance in which the total yield of seed per plant was up to 300 g, while, in other groups, it was never superior to 20 g. The number of seeds/pods was up to 24. The weight of 1000 seeds was, sometimes, 50.5 g, while the length of the pod varied from 10 to 22.8 cm. The cultivar Peru, widely used in Cuba, was among the best groups of accessions. The results showed that more than 70% of the accessions had good conditions to produce seeds in the western part of the country. The best accessions and the necessity of their proper management are discussed. It is concluded that the multivariate analysis, strategically used, is an effective method to evaluate the production of seeds in large groups of accessions or plant species phylogenetically related, combining the mathematical results with the biological performance.

TI  - Experiences with farm pastures at the former CSIRO Samford Research Station, south-east Queensland, and how these relate to results from 40 years of research
PY  - 2003
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0242338779&partnerID=40&md5=0b0ab44d62b9e932a5a117976ce3ae1d
AB  - Samford Research Station in coastal south-east Queensland was operated by CSIRO from the late 1950s-2002. Many experiments on tropical legumes and grasses were carried out on the station and many farm pastures were sown. Furthermore, once most experiments had ended, they were grazed as farm pastures. Hence, considerable experience was gained about how different species did or did not persist under farm grazing. This paper outlines these experiences with individual species of legumes and grasses and discusses how they relate to experimental results. In general, performance of species in farm pastures was similar to the results from experiments, provided the experiments were run for long enough and with appropriate grazing pressures. The main reason for the failure of short-term experiments to predict long-term results was that they did not allow sufficient time to establish whether recruitment could compensate for death of the original plants. The most persistent legumes were perennial peanut (Arachis glabrata), Pinto peanut (Arachis pinto) cv. Amarillo and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), followed by siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum) cv. Siratro, white clover (Trifolium repens) and Shaw creeping vigna (Vigna parkeri), all of which persisted in some situations. The most persistent and aggressive grass was Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum), with reasonable persistence from Queensland blue couch (Digitaria didactyla) and setaria (Setaria sphacelata).

AB  - A grazing trial was conducted to quantify N cycling in degraded Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena)-Brachiaria decumbens (signal grass) pastures grown on an acid, infertile, podzolic soil in south-east Queensland. Nitrogen accumulation and cycling in leucaena-signal grass pastures were evaluated for 9 weeks until all of the leucaena on offer (mean 600 kg edible dry matter (EDM)/ha, 28% of total pasture EDM) was consumed. Nitrogen pools in the grass, leucaena, soil, cattle liveweight, faeces and urine were estimated. The podzolic soil (pH 4.8-5.9) was found to be deficient in P, Ca and K. Leucaena leaf tissues contained deficient levels of N, P and Ca. Grass tissues were deficient in N and P. Grazing was found to cycle 65% of N on offer in pasture herbage. However, due to the effect of the plant nutrient imbalances described above, biological N fixation by leucaena contributed only 15 kg/ha N to the pasture system over the 9-month regrowth period, of which 13 kg/ha N was cycled. Cattle retained 1.8 kg/ha N (8% of total N consumed) in body tissue and the remainder was excreted in dung and urine in approximately equal proportions. Mineral soil N concentrations did not change significantly (-3.5 kg/ha N) over the trial period. The ramifications of grazing and fertiliser management strategies, and implications for pasture rundown and sustainability are discussed.

AB  - Two plant regeneration methods applicable to Leucaena leucocephala were developed. In the first method, involving organogenesis via callus formation, cotyledon, hypocotyl and root segments were initiated on MS medium containing different concentrations of N6-benzyladenine (BA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Both compact (type I) and friable (type II) calli were obtained from the cotyledon and hypocotyl explants treated with different concentrations of the growth regulators. Shoots were generated only from the friable calli formed from the cotyledon explants. The calli formed from the hypocotyl explants did not generate shoots and the root explants died without forming callus. Cotyledon explants from 3-4 day old seedlings showed maximum callus induction compared to those from older seedlings. In a second method involving direct organogenesis, excised cotyledons were cultured on 1/2 MS medium containing 1.0-35 mg 1-1 N6-benzyladenine (BA) for 7-14 days. Transfer of the cotyledons to regeneration medium containing low BA resulted in callus formation and subsequent shoot regeneration from the base of the excised cotyledon explants, with up to 100% frequency. Regenerated shoots rooted best on a basal medium containing no growth regulators.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of the foliage of Brosimum allicastrum and Leucaena leucocephala on the microbial population and the activity of the ruminal enzymes protease and cellulase. A completely randomized design with 3 x 7 factorial arrangement (three treatments and seven sampling hours) was used in in vitro conditions. The treatments were: A) star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis), B) star grass + Brosimum allicastrum and C) star grass + Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru. The technique of culture with mechanical agitation at 39°C was applied. The samplings were carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after fermentation. The pH of the ruminal liquid was 7.02, 7.00 and 6.94 for A, B and C, respectively. There was no effect on the concentration of short-chain, total and individual fatty acids, except butyric acid that was lower (P < 0.05) in the supplementation with B. allicastrum. The population of viable bacteria differed (P < 0.01) between treatments and decreased with the foliage of the two trees evaluated. Both B. allicastrum and L. leucocephala reduced the population of proteolytic bacteria (P < 0.01). The cellulolytic bacteria showed values of 2.69, 2.13 and 2.98 × 106 cfu x mL for the control, B. allicastrum and L. leucocephala, respectively. No effects were found in the activity of the ruminal microbial enzymes proteases and cellulases. The concentration of protein in the ruminal liquid was higher in the treatments including the foliage of these trees. The protozoa population was of 6.92, 7.94 and 9.55 cell/mL for the treatments A, B and C, respectively. It is concluded that the inclusion of B. allicastrum or A. leucocephala reduces the population of proteolytic and total viable microorganisms. This suggests that there are factors in these plant species that act negatively on this ruminal microbial groups. Further studies are recommended to confirm these results.

AB  - Three bulls (Holstem x Zebu), cannulated in the rumen, with 415 ± 22 kg of liveweight (LW) were selected to study the in situ ruminal degradability of dry matter (DM), total nitrogen (Nt), nitrogen bound to neutral detergent fiber (N-NDF), nitrogen bound to acid detergent fiber (N-ADF) and the enzymatic digestibility of the nitrogen non-degraded in the rumen in Leucaena leucocephala cv CIAT-7929. Bags were introduced in the rumen for 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. The degradability was analyzed by non-lineal regression, with the use of the model P = a + b*(1-e-c*(t-to)). The values of degradability of the insoluble, but degradable, fraction were 470.3, 417.5, 543.5, 602.1 and 24.6 g/kg of DM, when time was not a limitation. The Lag time of the different fractions was approximately 0.40, 5.6, 15.2, 1.0, 9.3 and 18.5 h for DM, NDF, ADF, Nt, N-NDF and N-ADF, respectively. The effective degradability (ED) of Nt, N-NDF and N-ADF ranged between 579-514, 265-172 and 0.8-0.4 g/kg of DM, respectively, with different constants of ruminal re-change. For all the indicators, the dynamics of in situ ruminal degradability showed increase (P < 0.01) of the exponential type in time, except for N-ADF, where degradation was almost insignificant. In vitro digestibility of nitrogen non-degraded in the rumen reached values of 480 g of digestible nitrogen/kg of non-degraded nitrogen, with 24 h of permanence of the samples in the rumen. The increase of the ruminal incubation time up to 48 h, increased the digestibility of the nitrogen of the diet. Aspects on the use of the different components of the liber fractions of this legume in ruminants are discussed. The results demonstrated a high contribution of nitrogen from leucaena in the rumen. Also, a characterization of the nitrogen bound to the different fractions and of its degradation in bulls rumen was obtained.

AB  - Root development, water use and water-use efficiency of 3 sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] varieties, viz. 'CSV 13', 'CSV 15' and 'Varsha', raised in alleys formed by different vegetative barriers, viz. Sesbania sesban, Leucaena leucocephala, Cajanus cajan, Vetiveria zizanoides and Cenchrus ciliaris, and unbarriered (control) were studied during the rainy seasons of 1995 and 1996 at Kanpur on light-textured alluvial soil. Best root development of sorghum was observed when raised in alleys of Sesbania, followed by Leucaena, while the poorest root development in alleys of Cenchrus ciliaris. Among the sorghum varieties 'Varsha' resulted in better root development in terms of depth, breadth, number and weight than 'CSV 13' and 'CSV 15'. Better root development of sorghum 'Varsha' raised in alleys of Sesbania resulted in higher water use and water-use efficiency and yield attributes like 1,000-grain weight, grains/panicle, grain and fodder yields where 'Varsha' excelled 'CSV 13' and 'CSV 15'. Total water use of sorghum under Sesbania was 388.5 mm which was 9.5 mm higher than the control (unbarriered) crop. The water-use efficiency of sorghum in association with Sesbania was 5.3 kg/ha-mm as compared with 4.1 kg/ha-mm unbarriered (control).

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate nutritive value of forages commonly used as ruminant feeds in North Sumatra, Indonesia. Seven species of grasses and five species of legumes were collected during the rainy season. The results showed that chemical composition, in vitro digestibility of dry matter (DMD), organic matter (OMD) and crude protein (CPD), in vitro gas production and metabolizable energy (ME) content greatly varied among the species of grass and legume forages. The CP content ranged from 6.6 to 16.2% in grass and from 17.5 to 29.1% in legumes; while NDF content of grass and legume ranged from 57.2 to 66.2% and from 24.4 to 55.6%, respectively. The DMD, OMD and CPD of grass ranged from 49.1 to 62.2%, 51.9 to 64.4% and 50.5 to 60.3%; while in legumes the values ranged from 59.1 to 71.8%, 65.2 to 72.0% and 68.2 to 71.6%, respectively. The ME content of grass varied from 6.4 to 9.3 MJ/kg and from 6.5 to 8.3 MJ/kg for legumes. In general, within species of grass Cynodon plectostachyus contained higher CP but was lower in NDF that resulted in much higher digestibility; a similar result was also found in Leucaena leucocephala for the legumes. The two forages also contained much higher ME than the others. In conclusion, the nutritive value of forages in North Sumatra, Indonesia during the rainy season was relatively high as ruminant feed, with the best quality noted for Cynodon plectostachyus and Leucaena leucocephala.

AB  - Energy storage in different plant parts over a three year growth of coppiced 5-year old plantations was investigated in five varieties of Leucaena. The aboveground parts stored more energy. Energy storage in selections S24 and S10 was more than in K8. Initially energy allocation was more in leaves than in branches. Ecological efficiency was maximum in the second year of coppice growth. Low efficiency in the third year is ascribed to low stand density and dry habitat. Compared with other ecosystems, coppiced plantations had higher capacity for energy storage. © International Scientific Publications, New Delhi.

AB  - Seeds of four tropical multipurpose trees (Albizia saman, Albizia lebbeck, Albizia rhizonse, Leucaena leucocephala), two shrubs (Tephrosia candida, Tephrosia bracteolata) and two pulse legume (Lablab purpureus, Canavalia ensiformis) were chemically analysed for dry matter (DM), ash, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and ether extract (EE). Qualitative evaluation of secondary metabolites (saponins, phenols, steroids, and alkaloids) was elucidated. The DM, ash, CP, NDF and EE ranged between 88.9-93.6 %, 3.0-5.4 %, 24.8-38.2 %, 22.1-46.9 % and 2.0-17.0 % respectively. All seed species contained at least one group of secondary plant metabolites and steroids were common to all except C. ensiformis that was not implicated for any. A. lebbeck and A. rhizonse showed low saponin content. Indications for water soluble tannins were reported for L. leucocephala while the two species of Tephrosia contained flavonoids or condensed tannins. The study suggested the potentials of the legumes seed species as a feed source for ruminants.

AB  - The pollen spectra of natural populations of the honey bee (Apis cerana Fabricius) were determined. Forty-one families of flowering plants were identified and pollen pellets from 101 colonies of A. cerana were collected from various areas of the Philippines. The major pollen types were Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Mimosa diplotricha Mart. ex Sauvallo, Mimosa pudica L., Callistemon citrinus (Curt.) Stapf, Zea mays L., Cocos nucifera L., Pterocarpus indicus Wild., Muntingia calabura L. and unidentified species of the family Ulmaceae. The pollen spectra of honey bees were generally homogeneous. Only the samples from Baguio and Benguet (Luzon highland) were distinct, characterized by the presence of species that grow well in colder areas. Diversity of the pollen spectra had no relation with geographical origin.

AB  - The variations in in situ ruminai dry matter (DM) and total nitrogen (TN) degradability were studied in six ecotypes of Leucaena leucocephala (CIAT-7929, 9379, 9101, 7872, 7988 and Peru), which are promising for ruminant feeding. High coefficients of variations (CV) were found in the parameters of DM degradability, with higher values in the degradable fraction (37.04%) and potentially degradable fraction (38.36%). For protein, the highest CV was obtained in the rate of degradation (40%). The potential nitrogen degradability (a + b) was between 69.23 and 89.36%, with an average value of 79.2%. This indicates that the capacity of this species for providing degradable protein to the rumen is high, with great variations. Further studies on the protein contribution of leucaena to the rumen and on other factors that can limit or benefit its nutritive value are necessary.

The silvopastoral system had the following characteristics: trees planted in 10 m wide strips, with four rows, across the slope and separated by 30 m wide strips without trees. The herbaceous forages were: Brachiaria decumbens and Stylosanthes guianensis var. vulgaris cv. Mineirão. Treatments were: Method 1) Simultaneous planting of trees and herbaceous forages; tree strip protection with wire fences, and grazing after the herbaceous forages establishment; Method 2) Planting of tree seedlings and of pigeon peas (Cajanus cajan) in the first rainy season; sowing of the herbaceous forages plus maize in the second rainy season; grazing after maize harvest and pasture establishment. In addition, tree species were planted in two different combinations: Combination A) Eucalyptus grandis and Acacia mangium; Combination B) Eucalyptus grandis, Acacia mangium, Mimosa artemisiana, Acacia angustissima and a hybrid Leucaena leucocephala x Leucaena diversifolia. Tree growth was not affected by the methods of establishment, however, it differed significantly between the two combinations of species, the average tree height of Combination A being higher than that of Combination B. The silvopastoral system was established in 16 and 22 months for Methods 1 and 2, respectively, and the total budget necessary for the establishment was lower for Method 2. However, the final budget (discounting incomes with live weight gains and maize yield, for Methods 1 and 2 respectively) differed little between methods of establishment.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization on the survival and recruitment of seedlings of dominant tree species in two abandoned tropical dry forests in Yucatán, Mexico
PY  - 2003
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0043265646&doi=10.1016%2fS0378-1127%2803%2900085-9&partnerID=40&md5=c0f9ea9297478e25e30171290bb6555f
AB  - Seedling dynamics were studied in a set of dominant tree species in regenerating secondary tropical dry forests (TDF) growing on limestone in the Yucatán Peninsula. The objective of the study was to assess how variation in nutrient availability affects the recruitment and survival of individual species considering natural variations in light and bulk density in the topsoil. Our study included an area of young forest (10 years old), with phosphorus-poor soils, and an area of old forest (≅60 years old). We used 16 plots (12 m x 12 m) per forest, in which we fertilized four plot replicates per treatment with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and nitrogen plus phosphorus (NP). Another four replicates were kept as control. In four 1 m x 1 m sub-plots set of each experimental plot, tree seedling dynamics were studied over 2 years. The species with the highest recruitment were Acacia gaumeri and Leucaena leucocephala in the young forest, and Bursera simaruba and Phyllostyllon brasiliense in the old forest. Recruitment of A. gaumeri was affected more by light availability than fertilization, but its survival increased with N or with NP additions. Leucaena leucocephala benefited by fertilization (N, P, or NP) and the species regenerated on sites with lower light availability, but required high light conditions and N addition to increase its survival. The recruitment and survival of B. simaruba required low light availability, and the fertilization with P or with NP increased its regeneration. Phyllostyllon brasiliense was recruited only in the old forest. The addition of P resulted in the highest recruitment and the lowest survival among fertilization treatments, leading to a negative final seedling density. Canonical analysis revealed that in the young forest, the most important variables that influenced species recruitment were bulk density in the topsoil, fertilization with P, fertilization with N, and light availability. In the old forest, the P and N fertilizations and bulk density in the topsoil appeared to be the most important variables; only light was not significant. Light requirement differences between forests suggest that a large number of opportunistic species in the young forest could exist there. Overall, our results suggest that the dynamic of understory vegetation in Yucatán Peninsula is strongly influenced by nutrient availability, especially P. The responses of seedling dominant species to nutrient addition will vary, depending on the details of the site's light availability and soil bulk density, and the identity of species. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Our work concerned the optimization of inoculation of two agroforestry species of woody leguminous plants: Leucaena leucocephata and Acacia mangium with various strains of rhizobium. First, we showed that the physiological stage of the bacterial culture had no effect on nodulation and growth of the seedlings of Acacia mangium inoculated and cultivated in vitro for four months. For Leucaena leucocephala, the number of nodules was significantly higher when the seedlings were inoculated with a bacterial culture in stationary phase. On the other hand, whatever the species, no significant difference was noted with regards to the dry weight of the shoots. The effect of the size of inoculum on the nodulation and growth of the seedlings was studied in L. leucocephala after five months in a greenhouse. Our result show that an inoculation with bacterial cultures containing 109 to 1010 bacteria per milliliter are the optimal conditions to have a maximum nodulation and growth of the seedlings. The two legume plant species showed significant differences with regard to the effect of the method of inoculation on nodulation and growth of the seedlings. For Acacia mangium, inoculation with a liquid culture one week after sowing was more favourable for the growth of the seedlings. On the other hand, for Leucaena leucocephala, this method of inoculation and the coating of seeds with a bacterial culture mixed with arabic gum improved significantly the growth of the seedlings. Results obtained in our study can be useful for the partners from developing countries involved in the large scale production of tree seedlings.

AB  - The effects of various fallow management systems and cropping intensities on water infiltration were measured on an Alfisol at Ibadan in southwestern Nigeria. The objective was to determine the influence of the land use systems (a combination of crop-fallow sequences and intercropping types) on soil hydraulic properties obtained by disc permeameter and double-ring infiltration measurements. The experiment was established in 1989 as a split-plot design with four replications. The main plots were natural fallow, planted Pueraria phaseoloides and planted Leucaena leucocephala. The subplots were 1 year of maize/ cassava intercrop followed by 3-year fallow (25% cropping intensity), or 2-year fallow (33% cropping intensity), or 1-year fallow (50% cropping intensity), or no fallow period (100% cropping intensity). Water infiltration rates and sorptivities were measured under saturated and unsaturated flow. Irrespective of land use, infiltration rates at the soil surface (121-324 cm h-1) were greater than those measured at 30cm depth (55-144 cm h -1). This indicated that fewer large pores were present below 30cm depth compared with 0-30 cm depth. Despite some temporal variation, sorptivities with the highest mean value of 93.5 cm h-1/2 increased as the cropping intensity decreased, suggesting a more continuous macropore system under less intensive land use systems. This was most likely due to continuous biopores created by perennial vegetation under long fallow systems. Intercropped maize and cassava yields also increased as cropping intensity decreased. The weak relationship between crop yields and hydraulic conductivity/infiltration rates suggests that the rates were not limiting.

AB  - A multi-environment trial was conducted to evaluate the performance of high yielding accessions from most taxa of Leucaena, for broad and specific adaptation to growth-limiting environments, and to develop an understanding of environmental parameters limiting growth of this important multipurpose tropical tree-legume genus. Eighteen sites were selected to include environments known to constrain the growth of L. leucocephala. Accessions were planted in replicated line plots, with 10 trees/plot, spaced 50 cm apart, and with rows spaced 3 m apart. Environmental parameters measured were maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall and psyllid pressure. Soil fertility and acidity indices were derived from soil analyses. A KX2 F1 hybrid accession proved broadly adapted with high yield rankings in all environments, and with yield advantage greatest at low temperature and high psyllid pressure sites. Specific adaptation to low temperature environments was identified in L. trichandra OFI53/88, and to a lesser extent in L. pallida CQ3439. No accessions were specifically adapted to acid-infertile soils. Highest dry matter production was achieved in fertile, hot, humid, low psyllid environments. Very low growth rates were achieved in acid-infertile and low temperature environments. Yield was strongly reduced by mean monthly minimum temperatures of <22°C, mean monthly maximum temperatures of <29°C, psyllid pressure of >2.5 (1-9 scale of increasing pressure based on damage to young leaves), acidity index of <6 (1-7 scale of decreasing acidity based on soil pH and Al saturation) and fertility index of <9 (1-12 scale of increasing fertility based on critical soil nutrient levels).

AB  - Scarcity of cellulosic fibrous raw materials in India has compelled to search for fast growing and high pulp yielding trees, which can be grown in all types of soils like semi and arid regions. Anatomical, morphological, and chemical studies of L. leucocephala show that it can sustain an adequate supply of raw materials for the pulp and paper industry. With some drawbacks, like the presence of Ca or Mg oxalates L. leucocephala has porous wood structures, longer fibre than that of other hard woods, high holocellulose and α-cellulose and low lignin content with xylan type hemicellulose. Anatomy, morphology, and proximate chemical analysis of L. leucocephala are directly reflected to good quality and quantity of pulp, shorter cooking cycle and chemical dosing.

TI  - Effect of feeding legume pods or alfalfa in combination with poor quality grass straw on microbial enzyme activity and production of VFA in the rumen of South African Merino sheep
PY  - 2003
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037404735&doi=10.1016%2fS0921-4488%2803%2900009-9&partnerID=40&md5=78874a417a8e4f10c0d5d8d8fa46385a
AB  - In the first of a two-phased study, changes in rumen pH and concentrations of VFA were evaluated on diets based on pasture straw (negative control) or straw supplemented with alfalfa (Alfalfa diet), pods of Acacia sieberiana (Sieberiana diet), Acacia nilotica (Nilotica diet) or Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena diet) for South African Merino rams. In the second phase, the effects of the same diets on the degradation of extracted straw in nylon bags and activities of microbial enzymes were investigated. The pH and total concentration of VFAs in rumen fluid ranged from 6.2 to 6.5 and 30-53 mmol l-1, while degradation of DM and NDF varied from 126 to 269 g kg-1 DM and 233-309 g kg-1 NDF, respectively, among diets. Variations in pH were not significant (P > 0.05), but diet influenced (P < 0.01) the concentration of VFAs, degradation of DM and cell wall constituents as well as enzyme activities of proteolytic and fibrolytic microorganisms. The results showed that the differences between the alfalfa and pod diets might have been due mainly to the presence of tannins in the pods. These compounds limit the growth and/or activity of ruminal microorganisms. However, a limitation in the supply of energy imposed by the pod diets may have reduced the efficiency of N capture by microorganisms leading to a depression in microbial activity. The tested legume pods could be used in limited quantities to supplement low-quality forage. The pods may need to be detoxified prior to inclusion at much higher levels in the diet. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was conducted in long-term alley cropping plots established in 1989 at International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria to determine the seasonal and yearly dynamics of dry matter and nutrient concentrations of hedgerow pruning under continuous cropping and response to fallow of 1-3 years. At one year after Leucaena leucocephala transplanting, pruning was started at the 75 cm height. The pruning frequency increased from one to five times per year as trees grew. In continuous alley cropping without fertilizer application, pruning dry matter decreased gradually from a peak of 5 t ha-1 at 3 years after Leucaena transplanting to about 2.5 t ha-1 at 11 years after transplanting, while the ratio of dry season to wet season biomass increased. Within 5 years after establishment, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in pruning decreased and Mg increased with the continuous cropping. Fallow clearly increased pruning biomass and nutrient concentrations. At the completion of the first cycle (1993), the pruning N yield was 170 kg ha-1 for the continuous cropping plot, and 269 for plots with 1 yr fallow, 344 for plots with 2 yr fallow and 241 kg ha-1 for plots with 3 yr fallow. In 1993 pruning P yield increased from 6.5 to 10.9 in the continuous alley cropping and in 1995, it increased from 4.5 to 7.0 kg ha-1 in one-year fallow plots. Fallow effect on potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) yield in pruning was also evident. These results suggest alley cropping with one-year fallow could be an effective rotation system for nutrient cycling in Alfisols of West Africa.

AB  - Two galactomannans, one extracted from seeds of Mimosa scabrella, having a mannose to galactose ratio of 1.1, and another with a 1.4 ratio from seeds of Leucaena leucocephala, were sulfated. The products from M. scabrella (BRS) and L. leucocephala (LLS) had a degree of sulfation of 0.62 and 0.50, and an average molecular weight of 620×103 and 574×10 3gmol-1, respectively. Their activities against yellow fever virus (YFV; BeH111 strain) and dengue 1 virus (DEN-1; Hawaii strain) were evaluated. This was carried out in young mice following intraperitoneal infection with YFV. At a dose of 49mgkg-1, BRS and LLS gave protection against death in 87.7 and 96.5% of the mice, respectively. When challenged with 37.5 LD50 of YFV, mice previously inoculated with BRS+virus or LLS+virus, showed 93.3 and 100% resistance, respectively, with neutralization titers similar to mice injected with 25 LD50 of formaldehyde-inactivated YFV. In vitro experiments with YFV and DEN-1 in C6/36 cell culture assays in 24-well microplates showed that concentrations that produced a 100-fold decrease in virus titer of YFV were 586 and 385mgl-1 for BRS and LLS, respectively. For DEN-1 they were 347 and 37mgl-1, respectively. Sulfated galactomannans, thus demonstrate in vitro and in vivo activity against flaviviruses. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A feeding and management system of female calves was used to study their performance and development in an association of grasses with a mixture of legumes. Forty crossbred (Holstein x Zebu) female calves with 145 kg live weight and eight months of age were selected, according to a completely randomized design. They were distributed in two treatments: A) star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis), associated with a legumes mixture of kudzu (Pueraria phaseoloides), butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea), teramnus (Teramnus labialis), stylo (Stylosanthes guianensis, centro (Centrosema pubescens), glycine (Neonotonia wightii) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), as natural stake and B) star grass. Both groups rotated in six paddocks with a stocking rate of 1.5 LAU/ha. The occupation time on each paddock was five and seven days in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. The pasture was neither irrigated nor fertilized. The animals from group B were given, in both seasons, 1 kg/animal/d of a supplement with 86% dry matter (DM), 11.84% crude protein (CP) and 10.8 MJ/kg of DM of metabolizable energy (ME), whereas group A received this supplement only in the dry season. The animals were weighed every 15 d and cross height, thorax perimeter and body length were measured. Pasture availability and DM, CP, Ca and P content were determined monthly. Duncan's test was used when necessary. The forage balance was positive for the group that grazed the multi-association. The eatable DM supply for this group surpassed 5 kg/100 kg of live weight. The increase in daily live weight (452 vs 336 g/animal/d) showed differences (P < 0.001) and favored the female calves in the associated system. The thorax perimeter of the animals increased differently (P < 0.001) between the groups studied and it was higher (15.7 vs 12.1 cm) in the multi-association treatment, which evidenced its superiority in feeding. The results showed an adequate potential for live weight gain, specifically in the dry season (452 g). This was in correspondence with the high growth and development of the female cattle in the calf stage.

AB  - Farmers grow vegetables widely during the dry season in wetlands known locally as dambos in southern Africa. Declining soil fertility is one of the major factors limiting smallholder vegetable production in the dambos of eastern Zambia. An experiment was initiated with 43 farmers with the objective of assessing the agronomic and economic feasibility of foliar biomass of gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) for production of cabbage, onion and a subsequent maize crop during the dry season. The treatments were, on a dry-matter basis, 8 and 12 t ha-1 gliricidia, 12 t ha-1 leucaena and 10 t ha-1 manure + half the recommended fertilizer rate, inorganic fertilizer at recommended rate, and a control without any inputs. Direct field measurements and informal enquiries were used for evaluating the effects of different treatments. The highest cabbage and onion yields were obtained from manure + half-rate fertilizer application. The gliricidia biomass transfer technology produced cabbage, onion and maize yields comparable with the full fertilizer application. In both cabbage and onion, manure + fertilizer gave generally higher net incomes. Biomass transfer also recorded higher net incomes than the control, and required lower cash inputs than the fully fertilized crop. Net incomes of the biomass treatments were substantially reduced by the labour costs for pruning and incorporation of the biomass. The results indicate that the gliricidia biomass transfer technology could be used as an alternative to inorganic fertilizers for vegetable production in dambos.

AB  - Two experiments were carried out to study effects of tree foliages versus grasses on intestinal nematode infestation and growth of confined goats. In experiment 1, 20 males and 10 females of Bachthao and cross-bred (Bachthao x Barbari) goats (initial live-weight from 9 to 14 kg) were allocated to 5 sources of forage which were offered as supplements to rice bran (RB) and a Molasses Urea Block (MUB). The forages were: fresh foliage of cassava (Manihot esculenta), Jack Fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) and Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and fresh grasses of Guinea (Panicum liconi) and Ruzi (Brachiaria ruziensi). The goats were confined in pairs in wooden pens of 1.2 x 1.4m area on a raised slatted floor. They were fed the experimental diets for 10 days and de-wormed before starting the experiment. The feed offered was adjusted at 14 day intervals according to live weights. The experiment began on 11 December 2001 and continued until 11 April, 2002.The forages were harvested daily from the fields in the Goat and Rabbit Research Center (GRRC). The foliage from cassava (C) and Leucaena (L) were harvested after approximately 2 months re-growth by cutting at 30 cm (C) and 70 cm (L) above soil level. The foliage from Jack fruit (trees were older than 5 years) was harvested after 3 months re-growth by cutting at 150 cm and higher above soil level. The Guinea and Ruzi grasses were harvested after 4 weeks and 7 weeks re-growth by cutting at 3 to 5 cm above soil level. All the foliages were fed at ad libitum. Rice bran was given at 10 g/kg live weight and a molasses-urea-block at 5 g/kg live weight. In experiment 2, 24 male goats recently weaned, with initial live-weight from 9 to 12 kg, were allocated to 4 treatments in a 2*2 factorial arrangement: Guinea versus Ruzi grass and two cutting heights of each grass (3 to 5 cm and 10 to 12 cm above soil level). The Guinea and Ruzi grasses were cut after 4 weeks and 7 weeks re-growth at between 9 am and 5 pm. The grasses were fed ad libitum. Rice bran was given at 15 g (DM)/kg live weight. In both experiments, records were kept of feed intake (daily) and live weight (15 day intervals). Faeces samples were taken at the beginning and monthly to determine eggs of Strongyle and coccidian oocyts. The goats grew faster and had lower levels of infestation with nematode parasites when fed: tree foliages rather than grasses (Experiment 1); or grass cut at 10 to 12cm rather than 3 to 5cm, above soil level (Experiment 2). It is concluded that there are two mechanisms which favour the use of tree and shrub foliages in diets for goats: the presence of condensed tannins in the leaves and the physical attributes of such plant species which do not facilitate the migratory habits of infective nematode larvae.

AB  - Three terrestrial leaf meals, Carica papaya, Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa oliefera and a freshwater aquatic fern, Azolla pinnata were evaluated as potential ingredients for farmed abalone diet. All diets were formulated to contain 27% crude protein, 13% of which was contributed by the various leaf meals. Fresh seaweed Gracilariopsis bailinae served as the control feed. Juvenile Haliotis asinina (mean body weight = 13.4±1.6 g, mean shell length = 38.8±1.4 mm) were fed the diets at 2-3% of the body weight day-1. Seaweed was given at 30% of body weight day-1. After 120 days of feeding, abalone fed M. oliefera, A. pinnata-based diets, and fresh G. bailinae had significantly higher (P < 0.01) specific growth rates (SGR%) than abalone fed the L. leucocephala-based diet. Abalone fed the M. oliefera-based diet had a better growth rate in terms of shell length (P < 0.05) compared with those fed the L. leucocephala-based diet but not with those in other treatments. Furthermore, protein productive value (PPV) of H. asinina was significantly higher when fed the M. oliefera-based diet compared with all other treatments (P < 0.002). Survival was generally high (80-100%) with no significant differences among treatments. Abalone fed the M. oliefera-based diet showed significantly higher carcass protein (70% dry weight) and lipid (5%) than the other treatments. Moringa oliefera leaf meal and freshwater aquatic fern (A. pinnata) are promising alternative feed ingredients for practical diet for farmed abalone as these are locally available year-round in the Philippines.

AB  - The use of trees and herbaceous cover crops for weed management in smallholder farms is a promising alternative to the unsustainable traditional shifting cultivation system. The reported experiment was conducted from 1993 to 1996 in fallow plots established in 1989 to rehabilitate a degraded Alfisol after 10 years of continuous cultivation of maize/cassava. Treatments consisted of four plots each of woody legume species (Acacia auriculiformis, A. leptocarpa, Leucaena leucocephala, and Senna siamea), and a herbaceous legume cover crop (Pueraria phaseoloides). Two controls (natural bush fallow and continuous maize/cassava) were included. Each treatment was cleared and cultivated in 1993 and 1995 (after 4 and 6 year fallow). Cultivation was repeated in 1994 for plots cleared in 1993 and in 1996 for subplots cleared in 1995. In all the years, weed density and dry weight was lower in planted fallows than in the controls. Per capita weed population growth rate decreased in all the fallow treatments most notably in A. auriculiformis and S. siamea fallow. All fallow species except A. auriculiformis would require more than 6 years of fallow to prevent growth of the weed population over the long term. The weed seed bank was 75% lower in A. auriculiformis and P. phaseoloides fallow than the control plots. Canonical correspondence and redundancy analysis indicated differences in species composition between treatments in the aboveground weed flora and in the weed seed bank. Cynodon dactylon and Digitaria horizontalis dominated continuously cultivated maize/cassava plots. Chromolaena odorata occurred more in natural bush fallow. In contrast, annual broadleaf weeds dominated the planted fallow treatments.

AB  - Seeds of four tropical multipurpose trees (Albizia saman, Albizia lebbeck, Albizia rhizonse, Leucaena leucocephala), two shrubs (Tephrosia candida, Tephrosia bracteolata) and two pulse legumes (Lablab purpureus, Canavalia ensiformis) were supplemented (125 mg) to straw (375 mg) in batch in vitro incubations using rumen content as inoculum. All seeds have been suggested to be useful protein supplements. Moreover, Albizia lebbeck and Albizia rhizonse, containing saponins, showed the ability to reduce rumen methane production, probably due to reduced protozoal numbers as suggested by lower butyrate productions. There was a suggestion of reduced protein degradability in the shrub seeds, containing condensed tannins.

AB  - Field trials to study the growth and biomass production of Leucaena leucocephala and Vitex negundo in relation to their age and season of harvesting were conducted on alkaline soils of North Indian plains under irrigated conditions. Both shrubs showed excellent regeneration and survival (>90%) of coppiced stumps. Increasing the harvest age from 10 months (in February) to 18 months (in October) did not result in statistically significant increase in biomass production of Leucaena. The yield on per plant and unit area basis was higher in coppiced stands than original stands of Leucaena and Vitex. The highest increase in biomass production of Leucaena was recorded between 18 and 20 months harvesting age. Harvesting in December was found the best for Leucaena. Vitex registered rapid growth during the period from summer untill the rainy season. The post-harvest conditions for coppice development, the period of rapid growth and the physiological stage at harvesting interacted significantly with the growth and biomass production of these shrubs. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Effect of fertilizer substitution through white leadtree (Leucaena leucocephala) green biomass on growth, yield and economics of wheat (Triticum aestivum) crop in degraded lands
PY  - 2003
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0347301588&partnerID=40&md5=6aac432e71c89b29618f2a45ca2b147b
AB  - A field study was conducted for 4 years (1994-95 to 1997-98) to find out the effect of substitution of fertilizer nitrogen in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.emend. Fiori & Paol.) through white leadtree orsubabul [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.] leaf biomass on growth, yield of wheat and residual effect on yield of subsequent crop of pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. emend. Stuntz], residual soil fertility and economic returns. Five treatments comprising 100 kg N/ha either applied all through urea fertilizer or Leucaena green biomass or combination of urea fertilizer and green biomass in ratio of 75:25 and 50:50 and the control, were tried. Green Leucaena leaves containing 3% N on dry weight basis, were incorporated into the soil 15 days before sowing of wheat crop. Wheat yield was at par in 100 kg N applied through urea fertilizer without Leucaena hedge rows (3 137 kg/ha) and 100 kg N through urea fertilizer with Leucaena hedge rows (3 047 kg/ha) indicating that well managed, pruned at the height of 75 cm above the ground, Leucaena trees in alley cropping did not show any suppressing effect on growth, grain and straw yields of wheat and pearl millet. Among substitution of fertilizer nitrogen treatments, 25% substitution of N resulted in significantly higher grain yield (3 418 kg/ ha) than 50% (2 937 kg/ha) and 100% (2 529 kg/ha) substitution. The plant height and yield-contributory characters were also higher in 25% substitution treatment compared to 50 and 100% substitution. Residual effect of incorporation of Leucaena biomass to wheat crop was observed on pearl millet yield. Substitution of 100% N through Leucaena leaves resulted in higher grain yield (2 055 kg/ha) than 25% substitution (1 987 kg/ha). Organic carbon (0.29%), available N (164.6), P (23.4), K (17.2) kg/ha were increased with the application of 100% substitution of fertilizer N through Leucaena biomass after 4 years. The highest net returns (Rs 16 172/ ha) and benefit:cost ratio (1.98) were obtained with 25% substitution of fertilizer nitrogen.

TI  - Biomass and diversity of the soil macrofauna in different grasslands
PY  - 2002
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0344549705&partnerID=40&md5=7825224e8e66000e3cf584aebea4e35f
AB  - The biomass and the diversity of the soil macrofauna was studied during three years in ten grasslands. The data were processed using a general linear model. The types of grassland varied from natural grasslands with or without leucaena on humic calcimorphic soil in a system for fattening cattle to grasslands of improved grasses with or without trees on a red ferralic soil in a system for dairy cattle. The number of individuals of the macrofauna was very variable in each system and between years and also showed interaction. In the grasslands 1, 2 and 3 that were established on humic soil in beef production systems, the highest number of individuals (between 6 and 14 individuals/m 2) was found and showed the most stable performance during the three years. The grasslands 4 and 5, established in dairy systems on a brown soil, had, in general, a performance poorer than the rest, except the grassland 9 (star grass without shade on a red ferralic soil). This grassland had a lower number of individuals (3.57 and 3.70 individuals/m2 in the first and third years, respectively). The grasslands 6, 7, 8 and 10, on a red ferralic soil, showed a similar performance (with values between 4 and 8 individuals/m2) and the latter was the most stable during the last three years. The biomass was superior in those established on humic calcimorphic and brown calcic soil (1, 2, 3,4 and 5) with values higher than 30 g/m2. The lowest biomass was found in the grasslands on red ferralic soil (6, 7, 8, 9 and 10). The macrofauna in all the grasslands was very similar and was composed of three phyla, five classes and seven orders. The classification of worms indicated the presence of two genera in all the grasslands. In the third system, the genus Diplotrema was also found. It is concluded that the macrofauna performance varied between the systems studied and biomass was superior in those developed on humic calciporphic and brown calcic soil. The third grassland had the best performance, with higher diversity of worms. The systems with trees maintained more stability in the performance of the macrofauna during the experiment.

AB  - The NTPC (National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd) is one of the largest power companies with a total generating capacity of 20 249 MW through its coal- and gas-based power stations. NTPC has been operating the NCPS (National Capital Power Station), located 10 km off Dadri Grand Trunk Road and about 60 km from Delhi. This project is unique in the country since it houses both coal (840 MW) and gas (817 MW) power stations. Around 80%-85% of the project area is alkaline with a pH range between 8.5 and 10.3. The water table is high and most of the area is low lying. The climate is typical, with the summer temperature reaching about 46 °C. The wet ash disposal system is conventionally adopted at the coal-based power stations in the country. However, dry ash disposal system has been in operation, for the first time in the country, at the coal-based power station of NCPS. The dry ash disposal system results in an ash mound, which is estimated to reach a height of about 55 metres ultimately. The ash mound construction activity, confined to an area of about 480 acres, is a continuous process spread over 25 to 30 years. Although experimental trials and commercial reclamation activities over the abandoned ash pond areas have been successfully completed in a few projects at NTPC, the reclamation of ash mound is a challenging task unlike that of ash ponds, under the prevailing climatic conditions, mentioned above. An attempt however, has been made to reclaim the completed portions of the ash mound initially, with grass species. In addition, a few tree species like, Eucalyptus globulus, Pongamia glabra, Leucaena leucocephala, Cassia siamea, Parkinsonia aculeata, Prosopis juliflora, and Callistemon lanceolatus, have been successfully cultivated. The paper deals with reclamation activities of the ash mound and future plans.

AB  - A random block design was used to study the concentrations of the chemical indicators: dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), true protein (TP), ash and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and the anti-nutritional factors: mimosine and DHP in six cultivars of Leucaena leucocephala (Venezuela, Perú, CIAT-17218, CIAT-17222, CIAT-9904, CIAT-17489) in the dry and rainy seasons. In both seasons, there were no differences among the cultivars, according to DM, CP, TP, ashes and NDF, with averages of 24, 29.4, 22.59, 7.92 and 46.50% for the rainy season and 25.74, 25.39, 22.74, 8.53 and 43.42% for the dry season, respectively. The content of mimosine in the dry season and the content of DHP in the rainy season showed differences (P < 0.05) among ecotypes, with values that ranged from 3.36 to 4.74% for mimosine in the dry season and from 0.88 to 1.75% for DHP in the rainy period. It is concluded that the main differences among ecotypes are related to anti-nutritional factors. Physiological studies on animals are recommended to determine possible differences among ecotypes, since they were not found in the chemical composition.

AB  - The research was done to define the effect of tempe yeast concentration on inositol and tannin contents of fermented lamtoro gung seeds (Leucaena leucocephala). This is a research with completely randomized design using four doses of tempe yeast, i.e. 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 15 %. Each treatment was replicated 4 times. The resulted data were analyzed by analysis of variance and the significant differences were tested by least significantly difference test. Tannin was analyzed by Lowenthal-Procter method. The result of the research showed that the treatment had significant effects (P<0.05) on the parameter measured. The highest inositol with lowest tannin contents were found by using 15 % tempe yeast and duration of fermentation 96 hours, that is 0.2631 %. © 2003, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted from 1988-89 to 1994-95 to evaluate different organic supplements, viz., cowpea (green manure), subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) as biomulch, and farmyard manure (FYM) in different combinations, to substitute fertilizer N and improve the productivity of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown on marginal soils under rainfed conditions. Within four years, cotton yields equivalent to that using 30 kg N ha-1 could be obtained with continuous incorporation of cowpea (in situ green manure) followed by a biomulch with subabul at 10 t ha-1 or with cowpea along with subabul at 5 t ha-1 and FYM at 5 t ha-1 or FYM alone at 10 t ha-1, thus providing alternative farming practices to reduce fertilizer N. Organic supplements improved soil organic C, resulting in an improved hydrophysical environment resulting in a 2-2.5% high available soil moisture and 10-27% higher mineralizable N during the critical boll development period of rainfed cotton. © 2003 Trop.

AB  - Forty-six Mesorhizobium strains associated with the leguminous plants Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania herbacea in an uncultivated Mexican field were characterized using a polyphasic approach. The strains were identified as Mesorhizobium plurifarium based upon the close relationships with the reference strains for this species in PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses, sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, and DNA-DNA hybridization. Although the strains isolated from both plants formed the same group in multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and cross-nodulations were observed in the laboratory, different electrophoretic types were obtained from the two plants grown in natural soils, indicating the existence of a preferable association between the plants and the rhizobia. The M. plurifarium strains from Mexico and the reference strains from Africa and Brazil formed different phenotypic clusters in a numerical taxonomy. The Mexican strains did not grow at 37°C and were sensitive to salty-alkaline conditions, while the reference strains from Africa and Brazil grew at 42°C and were more resistant to salty-alkaline conditions. These results demonstrate that both the plants and environmental factors affected the evolution of rhizobia and that the Mexican strains had adapted to the neutral soils and the cool climate where they were isolated.

AB  - In this paper we report meiotic behaviour in 28 accessions of the tetraploid (2n = 4x = 104 or 112) Leucaena confertiflora, L. diversifolia, L. involucrata, L. leucocephala, L. x spontanea and the diploid (2n = 2x = 52 or 56) L. shannonii and L. macrophylla. We compare and discuss our data with that on literature about polyploidy in the genus. Despite the general predominance of bivalent formation, quadrivalents and other associations were found in all the taxa analysed. In the diploid species, multiple associations were found in up to 62 % of the cells in L. shannonii and 97.6 % in L. macrophylla. In the tetraploid taxa irregularities such as univalents, trivalents and other multivalents were observed in varying proportions, up to 55 % in L. involucrata. Mean meiotic indexes per accession in the diploids and tetraploids were over or near 90 %, but pollen fertility varied from 54.2 % to 87.3 %. The rather frequent presence of quadrivalents in the diploid species supports a paleopolyploid origin. For the tetraploid taxa, the presence of quadrivalents reflect chromosomal homology due to polyploid origin. Even if an autotetraploid origin cannot be ruled out by cytological data alone, considering other existing evidence, it is probable that L. confertiflora, L. pallida, L. leucocephala and L. involucrata are segmental allopolyploids. However, an autopolyploid origin for L. diversifolia cannot be ruled out nor cytologically nor by other existing data.

AB  - The effects of fallow management systems on soil physical properties and intercropped maize (Zea mays L.) grain were studied in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria between 1994 and 1995. The A-horizon of the Alfisol at the site had a coarse texture which was rapidly degraded by continuous cropping. A split-plot experiment with 4 replications, which was established in 1989, was used for the study. The fallow systems comprising natural fallow, Pueraria phaseoloides and Leucaena leucocephala were mainplots whereas 25, 33, 50 and 100% cropping intensities were subplots. During the continuous cropping or 1-year cropping after 1-year to 3-year fallow periods, intercrops of maize (cv. DMR-SR-W TZ8843) and cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz, cv. TMS 30572) were cultivated. Surface (0-15 cm depth) soil bulk density, soil strength, aggregate stability, and water retention were measured. Also, intercropped maize root density, and grain yields were evaluated. Surface soil bulk density ranged from 1.18 g cm-3 (25% cropping intensity) to 1.31 g cm-3 (100% cropping intensity), with significant differences between the 100% and 25% and between the 100% and 33% cropping intensities. Soil aggregate stability and soil strength followed a similar trend of low to high rating as cropping intensities increased. Although soil water retention was generally similar, the fractal dimensions of soil pore, D, between 2.92 and 2.93 indicated high irregularities of the pores. This irregularity was attributed to low stability of soil of the aggregates of the coarse-textured soil. The effects of fallow were obscured by the coarse-textured surface soil, and might not be noticed at all if the topmost layer (0-5 cm) of soil was not sampled. Intercropped maize grain yields ranging from 2.6 to 3.8 t ha-1 with 25% cropping intensity, between 1.7 and 2.0 t ha-1 with 33% cropping intensity and from 0.6 to 1.3 t ha-1 with continuous cropping were observed. Crop growth and yield were enhanced by low cropping intensities (25 and 33%) of any of the fallow management systems.

AB  - A preliminary survey on allelopathic plants found in Southeast Asia including Vietnam was carried out during 2000-2002. Nineteen species consisting of weeds, shrubs and trees were selected for their effects on bioassays. Some of these plants have been traditionally used by Vietnamese farmers as field manures and mulches. The allelopathic potential of these plants was elucidated by evaluating the inhibitory exhibition from their leaves, stem and root on germination and growth of radish. The three species showing the greatest allelopathic potential were Galactia pendula, Leucaena glauca and Melia azedarach. Four other species including Desmodium rezoni, Euphobia hirta, Manihot esculenta and Morus alba were assessed to be the second most suppressive to radish germination and growth. Findings also indicated inhibitory exhibition of allelopathic plants were species dependent. Moreover, inhibitory effects varied among plant parts such as the leaves, stem and root. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although only Leucaena leucocephala is widely used, most members of the Leucaena genus have potential as multipurpose species for tropical agroforestry systems. To investigate the wood and biomass production potential of the Leucaena genus, 116 accessions covering the 22 species were evaluated over a two-year period at Brisbane, southeast Queensland, Australia. Trees were planted into replicated line plots 5 m long, with rows spaced 3 m apart. Trees were initially planted at 0.5 m spacings within the plots, but were thinned to 1 m spacings prior to the evaluation period. The hybrid accessions, KX2 (L. pallida × L. leucocephala) and KX3 (L. diversifolia × L. leucocephala), were the most productive, yielding over 50 kg dry matter (DM)/tree. L. trichandra OFI53/88 and L. diversifolia CPI33820 were the most productive non-hybrid accessions producing total yields of 41 and 37 kg DM/tree, respectively. Cultivar Tarramba (26 kg DM/tree) was the most productive of the 26 L. leucocephala accessions assessed in the trial but all these accessions suffered from psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana) attack at this site. A series of non-destructive growth measurements was recorded every three months over the two-year evaluation period. Root collar diameter (RCD), stem number and plant height were found to be the most useful of the measurements for non-destructive assessment of accession agronomic characteristics. A relationship between yield and a growth index (calculated as RCD2× Height/1000), was derived from data from all accessions and could be used as a reliable predictor of yield (r2 = 0.94). The widespread use of the F1 hybrid leucaenas is currently limited by a lack of seed. Technologies to economically produce F1 hybrid seed on a commercial scale are required before the potential of these accessions in agroforestry systems can be fully realized.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is an important agroforestry species pan-tropically, but relatively little is known of the forage production potential of other species in the genus. The agronomic potential of 116 accessions, representing the 28 species and subspecies of the Leucaena genus and several artificial hybrid accessions, was evaluated at Los Baños, Philippines and Brisbane, Australia over a 2.5-year period. Accessions were planted into replicated line plots, with 10 trees/plot spaced 50 cm apart, and with rows spaced 3 m apart. The L. pallidaxL. leucocephala KX2 F1 hybrid accessions were highest yielding at both sites, producing dry matter (DM) yields of over 900 g/m row/month at Los Baños and approximately 320 g/m row/month at Brisbane. In the near-optimal growth conditions at Los Baños, L. leucocephala accessions were highly productive, with the best accessions producing total yields of over 500 g/m row/month. The superiority of KX2 hybrids was most pronounced at Brisbane, where high psyllid pressure during summer, and low temperatures during winter severely constrained growth of L. leucocephala accessions. In the Brisbane environment, psyllid resistant accessions of L. pallida, L. trichandra and L. diversifolia were more productive than L. leucocephala accessions. Leucaena greggii, L. retusa, L. cuspidata, L. confertiflora, L. pulverulenta, L. pueblana and L. involucrata were of inherently low productivity in both the Brisbane and Los Baños environments. Mortality over the experimental period was very low for most species, particularly for L. leucocephala and KX2 accessions. The KX2 F1 hybrid accessions have considerable agronomic potential as alternatives to L. leucocephala for use in tropical agroforestry.

AB  - This paper reports research that attempts to rehabilitate toxic Pb/Zn mine tailings, in Guangdong, China, to achieve a healthy functional soil that supports sustainable vegetation. We studied the effects of the earthworm Pheretima guillelmi on the growth of a woody legume Leucaena leucocephala on Pb/Zn mine tailings diluted with varying amounts of mineral soil in pot experiments. L. leucocephala grew successfully on tailings with a 25% (w/w) soil amendment, but P. guillelmi only survived and actively burrowed with a 50% soil amendment. The presence of earthworms improved the yield of plants by 10-30%. Whilst earthworms marginally increased available N and P in soil, they increased uptake of phosphorus (by about 10%) to above-ground plant tissues. Six-month-old plants were more sensitive than 10-month plants to metal stress. P. guillelmi increased bioavailable metal concentrations in the amended spoils, accompanied by a direct increase of metal uptake by the plants. Increased metal uptake by plants was largely due to the higher dry matter production stimulated by earthworm activity, but this increased the rate of metal uptake into plants from spoil by at least 16% and as much as 53%. These results demonstrate that we should broaden the ecological context of phytoremediation by considering the plant-soil-animal interactions that influence metal mobility. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effects of drying temperature on chemical composition and nutritive value of leaves of the shrub legumes Acacia angustissima (Miller) Kuntze, Calliandra calothyrsus Meissn and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit were determined in two studies in Zimbabwe. In the first study, the effects of shade-, sun- and oven-drying leaves on chemical composition and protein precipitation capacity of tannin extracts were studied. Drying method affected (P < 0.01) chemical composition, with cell wall polysaccharides increasing from shade drying to oven drying. Calliandra calothyrsus leaves had the highest total phenolics, tannin phenolics and the lowest N content. About 40% of phenolics in L. leucocephala were non-tannin compared to less than 15% in A. angustissima and C. calothyrsus. Extractable proanthocyanidins and their capacity to precipitate protein were affected (P < 0.01) by drying method; extracts from shade-dried leaves were 10% and 20% more reactive than extracts from sun-and oven-dried leaves, respectively. The relative degree of polymerisation of the proanthocyanidins was higher (P < 0.01) for oven-dried (1.44) leaves compared to shade-dried (1.01) and sun-dried (1.00) leaves. Drying temperature influences the nutrient-polyphenolic interactions in A. angustissima, C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala leaves and these interactions have important implications for feed evaluation protocols and for use of these leaves in ruminant feeding systems. The second study considered the effects of feeding sun-dried or fresh leaves of the three shrub legumes as supplements to native pasture hay on nutrient intake and digestion by goats. Feeding the fresh or dry leaves made no difference in terms of dry matter intake and digestion, and N digestion. This offers farmers flexibility in terms of feeding strategies, as they can feed the browse in any form that suits their farm situation. Increasing the level of C. calothyrsus in the diet increased faecal N. Nitrogen retention was lower for animals fed with C. calothyrsus compared to those fed with the other browses.

AB  - The rapid spread of nonnative plant species have caused considerable negative impact to the biodiversity and ecosystems in Taiwan. To better under stand the status and to support researcher s and decision makers to develop strategies and remedies for this problem, it is necessary to obtain accurate spatial information and the progression about the invasions of foreign species into native ecocommunity. The availability of hyper spectral and high resolution satellite data provides researcher s an opportunity to pursue more complex analysis and have a great potential to achieve better performance and results in an invasive plants investigation. High resolution images provide detail spatial information about the target areas but are often limited to single or few spectral bands. On the other hand, hyperspectral data consist of tens to hundreds of contiguous bands but lack of spatial details. Therefore, a combination of both types of data is likely to be an optimal approach to the mapping of alien plants. However, with the large data volume and high data dimensionality, the major challenge of using hyperspectral and high resolution data together is to extract useful information effectively and efficiently. This paper present s a work in progress of developing a systematic method to use hyperspectral and high resolution satellite images to identify an invasive plant (horse tamarind, Leucaena Leucocephala ) that is spreading in an alarming rate in southern Taiwan. The developed method first locates "areas of interest" where target species is likely to populate most densely. Then a two-level analysis procedure is implemented using hyperspectral and high resolution satellite images to identify and map the distribution of target species. The first phase of the procedure is to analyze hyper spectral images with selected (helpful) features to obtain a preliminary result. The second phase is to isolate the areas where discrimination of target plant species is not satisfactory and to improve the accuracy of discrimination with the analysis of canopy structure s in high resolution satellite images. Verification with ground truth samples indicates that the developed method of combining high resolution and hyperspectral images analysis is an effective and efficient approach to detect invasive plant s in a large area.

AB  - A cladistic analysis using rbcL sequence data of 23 species from 16 genera of Mimoseae with two species of Acacieae, four species of Ingeae, one species of Parkieae, 11 species of Caesalpinioideae and five species of Papilionoideae as the study group, and two species of Polygalaceae as the outgroup taxa, was conducted. The result although very preliminary provides very informative findings which confirm the paraphyly of the tribe Mimoseae and support the monophyly of the genera Mimosa, Entada and Neptunia; and the Adenanthera group. The results also support the monophyly of the subfamily Mimosoideae and the subfamily Papilionoideae and confirms the paraphyly of the Caesalpinioideae. Kanaloa kahoolawensis (a species from Hawaii which is still uncertain for the placement) is found to be closely related to Leucaena leucocephala in Leucaena group.

AB  - We compared ant diversity and richness in two silvopastoral systems (Cynodon plectostachyus associated with Algarrobo trees (Prosopis juliflora) and Estrella (Cynodon plectostachyus) associated Leucaena shrubs (Leucaena leucocephala) and a fragment of tropical dry forest, located in the Natural Reserve El Hatico, El Cerrito municipality, Valle del Cauca, Colombia. Two 100 m lineal transects were placed in each system, within the transects we located sampling stations at 10 m intervals in order to collect ground foraging ants. One pitfall trap and one tuna baits were placed in each station. Additionally we measured the vegetation vertical structure and the canopy cover at each site. We registered 62 ant species distributed in 26 genera and 6 subfamilies of which Myrmicinae was the most representative. In order to know our survey efficiency, we calculated the richness by mean ACE, Jacknife 1 and Michaelis Menten Mean estimators, which indicated that the surveyed ants were between 62 and 88% of the total number of species in both agroecosystems. Richness, diversity and exclusive ant species were 38, 1.33 and 23 for the forest fragment, 35, 1.08 and 10 for the Prosopis silvopastoral system and 21, 0.92 and 7 for the Leucaena silvopastoral system. With a Hutchenson "t" test we found differences in ant diversity values between all ecosystems (p< 0.05). Pitfall traps were the most effective survey method since they allowed to capture more species. There were no correlation between vegetation volume, vegetation layer and canopy cover with ant richness and diversity. The transformation of forest to pasture lands threatens the species survival, however, the impact on ant biodiversity could be reduced if we implement the silvopastoral systems on productive areas.

AB  - In 1989, 15 fallow species were planted on a degraded Alfisol in southwestern Nigeria, but only Pueraria phaseoloides, Senna siamea, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia leptocarpa and Acacia auriculiformis survived beyond 1993. After clearing different subplots of the fallowed plots in 1993 and 1995, intercropping of cassava + maize was practiced with level (minimum) and mound tillage. Nitrogen fertilizer, between 0 and 60 kg ha-1, was also applied to subplots of natural regrowth where planted fallows did not survive. Although a maize grain yield of 2.3 t ha-1 and a cassava root yield of 18.3 t ha-1 were obtained with level tillage in 1995, grain yield was increased to 2.6 t ha-1 and cassava yields to about 22 t ha-1 by mounding and 60 kg N ha-1 application. Effects of mounding and N application were pronounced in the second and third consecutive years of cropping. Planted tree fallows like S. siamea, A. leptocarpa and L. leucocephala were highly suitable for soil rehabilitation. For sustainable crop production in the second consecutive year of cropping after a 6-year fallow period, mound tillage was recommended while in the third year, mound tillage with 60 kg N ha-1 was recommended.

AB  - Chitinase cDNAs from Leucaena leucocephala seedlings were cloned by PCR amplification with degenerate primers based on conserved class I chitinase sequences and cDNA library screening. Two closely related chitinase cDNAs were sequenced and inferred to encode precursor proteins of 323 (KB1) and 326 (KB2) amino acids. Expression of the KB2 chitinase from a pET32a plasmid in Origami (DE3) Escherichia coli produced high chitinase activity in the cell lysate. The recombinant thioredoxin fusion protein was purified and cleaved to yield a 32-kDa chitinase. The recombinant chitinase hydrolyzed colloidal chitin with endochitinase-type activity. It also inhibited growth of 13 of the 14 fungal strains tested. © 2003 by Japan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Agrochemistry.

AB  - Mimosine is a toxin present in the tree-legume leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), including its root nodules and the root exudates. The leucaena-nodulating Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 degrades mimosine (Mid+) and utilizes it as a source of carbon and nitrogen. Twelve TAL1145 mutants defective in mimosine degradation (Mid-) were made through Tn3Hogus, TnphoA or kanamycin-resistance-cassette insertions. A 5.0 kb Pstl fragment of TAL1145, subcloned from a cosmid clone containing mid genes for mimosine degradation, complemented most of the Mid- mutants. Sequencing this fragment and the adjacent 0.9 kb Pstl fragment identified five genes, midA, midB, midC, midD and midR, of which the first three genes encode ABC transporter proteins involved in mimosine uptake, while midD encodes an aminotransferase required for degrading mimosine into 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone, and midR is a regulatory gene encoding a LysR-type transcriptional activator. The location of MidA in the periplasm was shown by making two midA::phoA fusions, which made active alkaline phosphatase in the periplasm. The various mid::gus and midA::phoA fusions were inducible by mimosine, and a midD::gus fusion mutant showed β-glucuronidase activity in the leucaena nodules, indicating that midD is expressed in the nodules. Similarly, a midA::phoA fusion expressed alkaline phosphatase activity in the leucaena nodules, indicating that mimosine induces midA transcription in the bacteroids. mid genes are specific for the Mid+ strains of leucaena Rhizobium and are absent in strains of other Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium spp.

AB  - The goal of the present study was to assess a soil seed bank as an input seed source for revegetating lead/ zinc (Pb/Zn) mine tailings. The seed bank source was abandoned farmland, whose top 10-cm layer of top-soil contained 6,850 ± 377 seeds/m2 from 41 species. The seeds in the soil were principally distributed in the upper 0-2 cm, which held 75.8% of total seeds and 92.7% of species composition. The top 2-cm layer of topsoil may be sufficient to serve the purpose of providing a seed source for revegetation on derelict lands, including mined lands. Four different thicknesses of topsoil (1,2,4 and 8 cm, redistributed from the total 0-10-cm layer from the farmland) were field-tested on the Pb/Zn mine tailings. There was no significant difference in seedling density among the 4 thickness treatments. Many seeds in the treatments with more than 1-cm of topsoil were unable to emerge from the deeper layer. Seedlings in plots with topsoil of 1-, 2- and 4-cm failed to establish within 1 year due to the extremely high acidity (pH 2.39 to 2.76). A shallow layer of topsoil cannot neutralize the sulfuric acid generated from oxidation of pyrites in the tailings. For establishment of seedlings on metalliferous lands, an insulating layer such as subsoil, building rubble, or domestic refuse is necessary before covering with valuable topsoil. The woody legume Leucaena leucocephala grown on the tailings with a topsoil cover of 8-cm was the most dominant species. Lead was accumulated in root, branch, stem bark, and xylem, which accounted for more than 80% of the total metal concentration in the plant. This portion of Pb will reside in the plant for a long period, while the smaller portion of Pb in the leaf (about 15%) could be returned to the environment as litter during growth. Woody plants may have an advantage in metalphyto-remediation over herbaceous plants.

AB  - Relative influence of above- and below-ground competition on the growth and productivity of Linum usitatissimum (L.) was studied in a Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) De Wit based alley cropping system at a sub-humid site in central India. To examine the relative impact of above- and below-ground competition three competition situations were created: Crop + Leucaena shrub neighbour, Crop + L. hedge neighbour and sole crop in 4 m and 8 m alley-sizes. Sunlight at ground, soil organic C and total N in soil were measured in all the competition treatments at different distances from shrub and hedge neighbours. Sunlight did not differ in crop + hedge treatment compared to that in sole crop plot, whereas, it was reduced by 36 to 82%, across the alley sizes, in crop + shrub treatment compared to that in sole crop plot. Moreover, reduction in sunlight was greater in 4 m alley. Soil organic C was high but total N was low in crop + hedge neighbour and crop + shrub neighbour treatments compared to that in sole crop plot. Growth rate in Leucaena shrub, across the alley - sizes, ranged from 5.6 to 11.8 g m-2 day. Above-ground biomass and grain yield of the crop were reduced by 9 to 37% and 17 to 26%, respectively in crop + hedge treatment and 64 to 98% and 89 to 96%, respectively in crop + shrub treatment compared to that of sole crop. Comparing the two competition treatments (crop + hedge and crop + shrub neighbour) it was observed that above-ground biomass was reduced to the maximum by 55-60%, growth rate by 42-55% and crop yield by 71-72% due to above-ground competition. Below-ground competition was 3.6 times greater in 4m compared to that in 8 m alley. Intensity of competition ranged, across the alley - sizes, from 0.10 to 0.37 in crop + hedge and from 0.64 to 0.77 in crop + shrub neighbour competition treatment. Intensity of competition was greater in 4 m alley.

AB  - The effects of different fallow management systems on aggregate stability were studied on an Ultisol and an Alfisol in southern Nigeria. Aggregate stability was measured in natural regrowth, and planted fallows of Pueraria phaseoloides Benth. and Leucaena leucocephala Lam de Wit in a trial established in 1989 on an Alfisol at Ibadan (7°30′N, 3°54′E), southwestern Nigeria. Soil samples (0-30 cm depth at this instance) were wetted by immersion for 2 and 10 minutes before wet-sieving at 30 rpm for 5 to 35 minutes at 5 minute increments. Mean-weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD) and proportions of water-stable aggregates (WSA) were calculated. GMD and WSA were not affected by the length of pre-wetting or by the length of the wet-sieving period. Thus, wet-sieving for more than 5 minutes at 30 rpm was not necessary for these sandy soils. The trends observed for soil aggregate stability differed between the Alfisol and Ultisol, and for the Alfisol, it differed between a degraded and a managed fallow site. Thus, soil aggregate stability was influenced by soil type and soil management. The GMDs for the natural regrowth at 0-10 cm soil depth (0-15 cm soil depth sampling at 5 cm increment in this case) were between 1.12 and 1.42 mm, 1.14 and 1.46 mm for the Pueraria system, and 1.12 and 1.33 mm for the Leucaena system. An adjacent forest soil (0-10 cm) had GMDs between 1.24 and 1.54 mm. On a continuously cropped Alfisol, aggregate stability was significantly higher in the Pueraria live mulch system than in Leucaena alley cropping and natural regrowth. Fallowing for 2 or 3 years after 1 year cropping was essential under any of the systems to keep aggregate stability within the range of the forest soil. The fallow management practices enhanced surface soil aggregate stability .

AB  - The proanthocyanidin (PA) status of 116 accessions from the Leucaena genus representing 21 species, 6 subspecies, 3 varieties and 4 interspecific hybrids was evaluated under uniform environmental and experimental conditions at Redland Bay, Queensland, Australia in October 1997. The PA content of lyophilized youngest fully expanded leaves was measured spectrophotometrically by the butanol/HCl assay referenced to L. leucocephala ssp. glabrata standard PA and expressed as L. leucocephala ssp. glabrata PA equivalents (LLPAE). Considerable interspecific variation in PA concentration existed within the genus, ranging from 0-339 g LLPAE/kg dry matter (DM). Taxa including L. confertiflora, L. cuspidata, L. esculenta and L. greggii contained very high (> 180 g LLPAE/kg DM) PA concentrations. Similarly, many agronomically superior accessions from L. diversifolia, L. pallida and L. trichandra contained extremely high (up to 250 g LLPAE/kg DM) PA concentrations, although these taxa exhibited wide intraspecific variation in PA content offering the potential to select accessions with lower (120-160 g LLPAE/kg DM) PA content. Commercial cultivars of L. leucocephala ssp. glabrata, known to produce forage of superior quality, contained low amounts of PA (33-39 g LLPAE/kg DM). Artificial interspecific hybrids had PA contents intermediate to those of both parents. Lesser-known taxa, including L. collinsii, L. lanceolata, L. lempirana, L. macrophylla, L. magnifica, L. multicapitula, L. salvadorensis and L. trichodes, contained undetectable to low (0-36 g LLPAE/kg DM) quantities of PA and have potential as parents to breed interspecific hybrids of low PA status and superior forage quality. Extractable PA was the dominant PA component, accounting for 91 % of total PA within the genus. Regression analysis of accession ranks from different experiments compared to these results indicated that genetic regulation of Leucaena spp. PA content was consistent (P < 0.01) under different edapho-climatic environments. The distribution of PA within the Leucaena genus did not concur with the predictions of various evolutionary and phylogenetic plant defence theories. © 2002 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - The leguminous shrub Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is widely used as a forage species for cattle in tropical agriculture. However, leucaena contains the toxic amino acid mimosine. Both mimosine and its primary ruminal degradation product 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone (DHP) are toxic and their accumulation in the animal's system results in hair loss, reduced liveweight gain, and goitre. The ruminal bacterium Synergistes jonesii is known to degrade these compounds and inoculation of the bacterium into the rumen protects cattle against mimosine and DHP toxicity. We report on the development, production, and storage of an in vitro, fermentor-based, mixed bacterial inoculum, which includes S. j.onesii, for administration to cattle. This technique may be applicable to the production and delivery of other live, anaerobic, bacterial inocula for use in animal agriculture.

AB  - A combination of human, climatic, geomorphological and pedological factors has led to extensive degradation of the soils of the Cabo Verde Islands. To survive in fragile conditions, the stabilisation of the farming systems and the maintenance of high and sustainable yields have become absolute priorities for farmers. The project described here is part of a programme of water resource optimisation on the island of Santiago in a semi-add mountainous area near Godim. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of two conservation techniques (light mulching with maize (Zea mays L.) haulms and hedging with bushes and grass) on runoff, erosion and phytomass production under natural rainfall. The main data were collected on five runoff plots of 100 m2 and 10 pairs of 4 m2 plots scattered over the hillslope. Although, rainfall erosivity was higher than in Sahelian areas, runoff occurred only for rainfall higher than 40 mm and intensities over 40 mm/h. Soil losses reached 12 mm/year on bare plots, 48 mm with traditional crops, 3.1 mm with hedges and less than 0.03 mm under mulching on 50% slopes. This study confirmed that mulching alone, or associated with the plantation of hedges, reduces runoff and erosion on the steep slopes of the Cabo Verde mountains. However, the ability to improve the use of the water resources by grain-producing crops in semi-arid regions was questionable. Plant material for mulching was only available and efficient during the wet years. The efficiency was therefore irregular and depended on the abundance of rainfall, weed production and the degree of satisfaction of plant water and nutrient requirements at the critical moment when the crops are in flower. Hedges of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit or Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth (Congo pea), without ditches or banks, planted on the flat and mulched could contribute to the supply of fodder in the dry season as well as blocking rivulet runoff and erosion in the Sahelian area. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Chemical constituents as well as different fractions of protein and carbohydrate of mature leaves and twigs from 9 browse trees and 12 shrubs were estimated. Soluble protein as% of CP among different tree and shrubs species varied from 57.46 to 86.27% and 61.97 to 90.30% respectively. Lowest NPN% of soluble protein was observed in Ziziphus xylopyrus (12.14%) and the highest value was (78.00%) in Acacia leucophloea. Both NDIP and ADIP content were comparable in tree leaves and shrubs. The lower value of protein fraction A, C and higher value of B1, B2 and B3 was observed in Ficus religiosa, Leucaena leucocephala and Holoptelia integrifolia, which are the indication of their superior protein sources. The shrubs like Acacia catechu, Securinega virosa, Dichrostachys cinerea provide higher quantity of superior quality B protein fractions. The less quantity of unavailable cell wall i.e. carbohydrate fraction C present in tree species like Hardwickia binata (12.39%), Dalbergia sissoo (25.91%) and Holoptelia integrifolia (27.50%) and shrubs. Securinega virosa (13.46%) showed their superior quality as carbohydrate sources.

AB  - In order to evaluate growth characteristics, adaptability, biomass production, nutrient recycling, nutrient distribution and the ability to regenerate degraded land, a trial using four multipurpose tree species (Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena diversifolia, Acacia melanoxylon and Mimosa scabrella) was undertaken over two years in a distrophic red yellow latosol (oxisol) following a randomized block experimental design with four replications. At the age of two years, A. melanoxylon and L. diversifolia were the tallest species (5.25 and 4.97 m, respectively) and A. melanoxylon and M. scabrella had the largest diameters at 20 cm from tree base. Mimosa scabrella and A. melanoxylon had the highest dry matter production and quantity of nutrients in the above ground biomass. In all species, the highest nutrient contents were found in the leaves, followed by branches and stems. From all species, the highest Nutrient Utilization Efficiency Indexes were obtained for sulphur, phosphorous, and magnesium; L. diversifolia was the most efficient for nitrogen, potassium, calcium, sulphur, and manganese, while A. melanoxylon was the most efficient for phosphorus, magnesium, boron, iron, and zinc. Litter production levels over a three month period were as follows: M. scabrella > A. melanoxylon > L. diversifolia > L. leucocephala. Litter nutrient content was higher in M. scabrella than in the other species. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous analyses of species relationships and polyploid origins in the mimosoid legume genus Leucaena have used chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) restriction site data and morphology. Here we present an analysis of a new DNA sequence data set for the nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) 5.8S subunit and flanking ITS 1 and ITS 2 spacers, a simultaneous analysis of the morphology, ITS and cpDNA data sets for the diploid species, and a detailed comparison of the cpDNA and ITS gene trees, which include multiple accessions of all five tetraploid species. Significant new insights into species relationships and polyploid origins, including that of the economically important tropical forage tree L. leucocephala, are discussed. Heterogeneous ITS copy types, including 26 putative pseudogene sequences, were found within individuals of four of the five tetraploid and one diploid species. Potential pseudogenes were identified using two pairwise comparison approaches as well as a tree-based method that compares observed and expected proportions of total ITS variation contributed by the 5.8S subunit optimized onto branches of one of the ITS gene trees. Inclusion of putative pseudogene sequences in the analysis provided evidence that some pseudogenes in allopolyploid L. leucocephala are not the result of post-allopolyploidization gene silencing, but were inherited from its putative diploid maternal progenitor L. pulverulenta.

AB  - Management of stocking rate and supplementation with local resources are viable alternatives for the intensification of livestock production systems in the tropics. However, most studies have been directed to evaluate both aspects separately. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of the stocking rate and supplementation with Leucaena leucocephala, on the productivity of grazing Bos taurus x Bos indicus cows. Twenty cows in their first and second lactation were used in a completely random design with a factorial arrangement 2x2. The treatments were: LSNL: 2 AU/ha without Leucaena; LSWL: 2 AU/ha with Leucaena; HSNL: 3.5 AU/ha without Leucaena; HSWL: 3.5 AU/ha with Leucaena. The Leucaena was used by cutting and carrying, the intakes being 1.82 and 1.75 kg DM cow / d/, for LSWL and HSWL, respectively. There were no significant differences in milk production among the low stocking treatments (LSNL, LSWL) nor between these and the high stocking treatment with Leucaena (HSWL). However, the saleable milk production and total milk production were lower in HSNL. The saleable milk production and total milk production were 54 and 35% higher, respectively, in HSWL than in HSNL. No significant differences were found for stocking rate and supplementation effects separately, but the interaction was significant. No significant differences were found in milk fat nor in body weight changes, however, supplemented cows tended to lose less body weight at both stocking rates. Supplementation with Leucaena improved the productivity of cows grazing at high stocking rates but this was not true for the lowest stocking rate. Leucaena leucocephala is a resource that could help to intensify milk production systems in the tropics.

AB  - The nutritive value of four tropical forage legumes grown during the dry season was assessed by gas production, microbial adhesion and in vitro N degradation and intestinal digestion. Species tested were: Leucaena leucocephala (Ll), Cajanus cajan (Cc), Neonotonia wightii (Nw) and Stylosanthes macrocephala (Sm). Chemical analysis showed higher lignification of Sm (187 g acid detergent lignin, ADL/kg dry matter, DM) compared with Nw (92 g ADL/kg DM), and a higher concentration of extractable and fibre-bound condensed tannins (CT) in browse (Ll and Cc) than in herbaceous (Nw and Sm) legumes (82, 110, 6 and 6 g total CT/kg DM, respectively). A higher total gas volume occurred for Nw (188, 163, 146 and 130 ml gas/g DM for Nw, Ll, Cc and Sm, respectively; P < 0.001). Rates of fermentation at 24 h were 0.069, 0.027, 0.046 and 0.051 h-1 for Nw, Ll, Cc and Sm (P < 0.001). The DM degradation of the legume species ranked them similar to gas production. There were no differences among legumes in microbial adhesion patterns, nor major differences in enzymatic activity against structural polysaccharides until 32 h, but then Nw showed higher total cellulase (P < 0.001), xylanase (P < 0.001), β-glucosidase (P < 0.01) and β-xylosidase (P < 0.05) activities than Ll and Cc. In vitro nitrogen disappearance after 32 h incubation was higher for Nw, intermediate for Sm and lowest for Ll and Cc (P < 0.001), probably because of the high CT concentration in the latter. Intestinal digestion of Ll and Cc was also low, suggesting that CT may still be impeding digestion to a certain extent at this site. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Allelopathy is the direct or indirect effect of one plant on another through substances liberated into the environment, and occurs widely in natural plant communities. The secondary metabolites or natural products involved in allelopathy are called allelochemicals and can be produced in different parts of the plants. The purpose of this study was to determine the allelopathic potential of the aerial part of Leucaena leucocephala on the weeds Desmodium purpureum, Bidens pilosa and Amaranthus hybridus. Bioassays were carried out in laboratory and in greenhouse with aqueous extracts of the aerial part of leucaena in concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5 % (v v-1). The aqueous extract showed major effect over the weeds when applied to filter paper. The allelopathic potential of leucaena varied with weed species, but B. pilosa and A. hybridus were the most sensible species to the extract in both bioassays. Mimosine was quantified by HPLC in concentrations directly correlated to extract concentrations, indicating this allelochemical as the possible substance involved in effects on weed germination and development. © 2001, Scientia Agricola.

AB  - Prunings in hedgerow intercropping systems are a potential source of organic matter and their quality is an important characteristic driving decomposition and nutrient release. To determine the potential range of residue characteristics and the impact of canopy age on those, selected characteristics of Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, and Senna siamea hedgerow leaf residues were determined for 'young' (5-10 weeks) and 'old' (39-47 weeks) hedgerow canopies in six sites, representative in terms of soil for the derived savanna zone of West-Africa. The N content of the Leucaena and Senna residues decreased with age (from 4.8 to 3.9% and from 4.1 to 3.0%, respectively, while the N content of the Gliricidia residues remained constant (3.9%). The P content of all species decreased with age (from 0.30 to 0.20%, on average). The lignin content of the Leucaena residues increased, and their polyphenol content decreased with age, while for the Senna residues only an increase in polyphenol content with canopy age was evident. Neither the lignin nor the polyphenol content of the Gliricidia leaf residues was markedly affected by canopy age. For all species, the P and ADF content were positively correlated with the ash and lignin content, respectively. The N content of the Leucaena and Senna residues was positively correlated with their P content while the lignin content of the same species was negatively correlated with the polyphenol content. Because of the low variation in certain residue characteristics between sites, the presented data and equations could potentially be used to reasonably estimate those characteristics if no other information is available. For other characteristics, such as polyphenol contents, measurements are preferable in view of the relatively high variation encountered.

AB  - Tarramba leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Tarramba) foliage had per kilogram dry matter, 169 g protein and 29.8 g condensed tannins. Its value as a supplement, given either with or without urea, to sheep given a low-quality Callide Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Callide) hay was studied. Six rumen fistulated sheep (mean ± s.d. liveweight, 34 ± 1.4 kg) were used to compare 6 dietary treatments in an incomplete latin square design. Rhodes grass hay was given ad libitum either alone, or with urea 7 g/day (U), or with leucaena 150 g/day (L150), or leucaena with urea (L150U), or leucaena 300 g/day (L300), or leucaena with urea (L300U). Digestible organic matter intake was increased significantly by leucaena supplementation although digestibility of the whole diet did not alter. Rumen fluid ammonia-N was not altered by leucaena supplementation, but was increased by urea. This suggests that Tarramba foliage protein has some resistance to ruminal degradation. Liquid and solids passage rates were not affected by the treatments. Microbial nitrogen supply to the intestine (g/day), and the efficiency of microbial nitrogen synthesis (g/kg organic matter apparently digested in the rumen), were increased by leucaena supplementation (P<0.01). Microbial protein synthesis was the only response in which 300 g/day air-dry Tarramba foliage gave improved results over 150 g/day.

AB  - An investigation was carried out to assess the role that P solubilizing microorganisms play in the P nutrition of mycorrhizal and mycorrhiza-free Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.). Soil microorganisms able to solubilize rock phosphate were isolated from the rhizosphere of L. leucocephala naturally growing on three different soils of Hawaii. The isolates were screened for their ability to solubilize rock phosphate in culture medium. The highest activity was observed with one of the fungal isolates, which was identified as Mortierella sp. It was multiplied and further evaluated with or without the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus aggregatum in a highly weathered soil for its effectiveness to enhance P uptake and growth of L. leucocephala. Phosphorus status of L. leucocephala pinnules monitored as a function of time revealed that plants colonized by both microorganisms had the highest P content followed by plants inoculated with the mycorrhizal fungus alone. Inoculation of soil with Mortierella sp. alone did not influence P content of plants measured at the time of harvest. However. Mortierella sp. increased the P content of mycorrhizal plants by 13% in the unfertilized soil and by 73% in the soil fertilized with rock phosphate. Shoot dry weight measurements showed that Mortierella sp. stimulated growth of nonmycorrhizal by 22%, while it stimulated the growth of myocorrhizal plants by 29%, regardless of P fertilization. The results suggest the existence of synergistic interaction between P solubilizing microorganisms and mycorrhizal fungi, although the degree of synergism was more pronounced in terms of P uptake than in terms of growth.

AB  - Bangladesh is an agricultural country. About 80% of the total population live in rural areas. The contribution of agriculture to the gross domestic product is 30%. Rice is the major food crop while jute, sugarcane and tea are the main cash crops. Other important crops are wheat, tobacco, pulses, vegetables and fruits. Overall productivity in Bangladesh is stagnating or declining. The implication of yield stagnation or declining productivity is severe, since these trends have occurred despite rapid growth in the use of chemical fertilisers. Depletion of soil organic matter is the main cause of low productivity, which is considered one of the most serious threats to the sustainability of agriculture in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, most soils have less than 17 g/kg and some soils have less than 10 g/kg organic matter. Farmers realise that there is a problem with soil fertility related to organic matter depletion. Farmers say that organic matter increases yield, reduces the production cost, improves crop growth and the economy, increases water-holding capacity and improves the soil structure. They recognise soil with higher organic matter content by darker brownish to black in colour. Some farmers are using fast-growing trees such as Flemingia macrophyla, Ipilipil (Leucaen leucophala), Glyricidia sepium, Boga Medula (Tephrosia candida), Dhol Kolmi (Ipomoea fistulosa), etc., as living fences, which can be used as fuel, fertiliser and fodder. To increase the soil organic matter, farmers use green manure crops, compost, quick compost, cow dung, azolla, etc. However, fuel for cooking purposes is limited and cow dung and crop residues are largely used as fuel. Crop residues are also used as fodder for livestock. Farmers expressed the wish to learn more about organic fertilizer management. However, sufficient food should be produced to keep pace with population growth. To alleviate the hunger and poverty is to increase the intensity of agricultural production and maintain favorable ecological conditions. Therefore, more organic matter should be used in the farmers' fields to sustain the soil fertility in an intensive farming system.

AB  - Thirty per cent replacement of concentrate mixture (or 9.80% in total diet consumed) with Leucaena leaves in pellet has given comparable DM, TDN and DCP intake with that of mash fed control. Values of ruminal pH, total VFA, total-N, ammonia-N and protozoa counts were also similar with that of control. Hence, pelleted feed with 30% Leucaena leaf can be fed easily to adult Marwari goats for their maintenance. Addtion of Leucaena leaves in the mash reduced the cost of pellet by 21.43%.

AB  - • The host range and specificity is reported of a genetically diverse group of rhizobia isolated from nodules of Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania sesban. • Nodule number and nitrogen content was measured in seedlings of herbaceous and woody legume species after inoculation with rhizobial strains isolated from tropical soils, to establish symbiotic effectiveness groups for rhizobial strains and their hosts. • Specificity for nodulation and N2 fixation varied greatly among the legumes. Symbionts of all four legumes exhibited a wide range of promiscuity and symbiotic effectiveness with isolates of S. sesban having the narrowest host range. N2 fixation varied greatly; although some strains fixed large amounts of N2 with more than one host, none was effective with all hosts. Rhizobial isolates of C. calothyrsus, G. sepium and L. leucocephala were able to effectively cross-nodulate each others' hosts as well as a number of other species. • The complex nature of cross-nodulation relationships between diverse rhizobial strains and legume hosts is highlighted. Host plants inoculated with effective rhizobial strains showed better nitrogen use efficiency than plants supplied solely with mineral nitrogen.

AB  - Species composition in successional dry forests in the tropics varies widely, but the effect of this variation on biogeochemical processes is not well known. We examined fluxes of N oxides (nitrous and nitric oxide), soil N cycling, and litter chemistry (C/N ratio) in four successional dry forests on similar soils in western Puerto Rico with differing species compositions and land-use histories. Forests patch-cut for charcoal 60 years ago had few legumes, high litter C/N ratios, low soil nitrate and low N oxide fluxes. In contrast, successional forests from pastures abandoned several decades ago had high legume densities, low litter C/N ratios, high mean soil nitrate concentrations and high N oxide fluxes. These post-pasture forests were dominated by the naturalized legume Leuceana leucocephala, which was likely responsible for the rapid N cycling in those forests. We conclude that agriculturally induced successional pathways leading to dominance by a legume serve as a mechanism for increasing N oxide emissions from tropical regions. As expected for dry regions, nitric oxide dominated total N oxide emissions. Nitric oxide emissions increased with increasing soil moisture up to about 30% water-filled pore space then stabilized, while nitrous oxide emissions, albeit low, continued to increase with increasing soil wetness. Inorganic N pools and net N mineralization were greatest during peak rainfalls and at the post-agricultural site with the highest fluxes. Soil nitrate and the nitrate/ammonium ratio correlated positively with average N oxide fluxes. N oxide fluxes were negatively and exponentially related to litter C/N ratio for these dry forests and the relationship was upheld with the addition of data from seven wet forests in northeastern Puerto Rico. This finding suggests that species determination of litter C/N ratio may partly determine N oxide fluxes across widely differing tropical environments.

AB  - The effect of three exploitation intensities: A (high), B (medium) and C (low) on the botanical composition of selected pastures was studied in a silvopastoral system of a multi-associated legume and grass plot. Treatments were distributed according to a randomized block design with three replications and cows, with medium to low milk yields, were used in a balanced and replicated Latin square design. The multi-association consisted of the following species: Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham, Neonatonia wightii cv. Tinaroo, Teramnus labialis cv., Centrocema pubescens cv. SIH-129, Stylosanthes guianenis cv. CIAT-184 and Panicum maximum (a mixture of Likoni and SIH-127 cultivars) and others already existing in the grassland. Samples of faeces were taken in the rainy season of 1995 and in the dry season of 1996. They were analyzed using the micro-histological technique. The botanical composition of the pasture showed high shrub legume values in both seasons (55.4 % in A, 51.0 % in B and 47.7 % in C during the rainy season and 54.7 % in A, 51.7 % in B and 48.2 % in C during the dry season). Likewise, legumes were predominant in the pastures selected and no significant differences were found between treatments with an average of 59.3 % in the rainy season and 58.7 % in the dry season and high diversity indicators (an average of 0.72 for both seasons). Legumes were also preferred to grasses. These differences were higher in the dry season. Results suggest that a silvopastoral system with species diversity and availability may favor the animal's ability to select increasing the consumption of nutritive pastures.

TI  - Assessment of nodulation of Mucuna pruriens by promiscuous indigenous rhizobia in the moist savanna zone of Nigeria
PY  - 2001
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034898544&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1016769412363&partnerID=40&md5=49f8612a17d30161b456843f8da4229f
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala failed to nodulate effectively with promiscuous indigenous rhizobia with which Mucuna pruriens nodulated effectively. Mucuna pruriens was adequately established and well nodulated due to the presence of favourable climatic and edaphic factors which enhanced its establishment in the humid/moist savanna zone of Nigeria. The microsymbiont for M. pruriens seems to thrive more in an alkaline rhizosphere. Introduction of M. pruriens into the farming system in Nigeria may serve as a low input agricultural system, which is not only sustainable but also economically viable.

TI  - The effect of cutting interval on the growth of Leucaena leucocephala and three associated grasses in Thailand
PY  - 2002

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) was grown with 3 grasses: ruzi (Brachiaria ruziziensis), and dwarf napier and Taiwan A25 (both Pennisetum purpureum) under rainfed conditions in Thailand. The pastures were cut at 20, 30 and 40-day intervals for 840 days. Dwarf napier produced more total and leaf dry matter than Taiwan A25 and ruzi (P < 0.05). Yield of all grass species increased with increasing cutting intervals. Leucaena yield was generally unaffected by cutting interval. However, at 40-day cutting intervals, leucaena dry matter yield was lower in the dwarf napier plots than in the ruzi and Taiwan A25 plots, which produced similar legume yields (P > 0.05). Growing leucaena with dwarf napier gave the lowest total legume dry matter yield (P > 0.05). Less frequent cutting increased total dry matter yields in all combinations through increases in grass yield. Maximum dry matter yield (41.5 t/ha) was produced by leucaena-dwarf napier. Dwarf napier produced herbage of higher quality than the other grass species in terms of crude protein concentration in both stems and leaves and had a higher leaf: stem ratio. Leucaena produced higher crude protein levels than grasses. The crude protein concentration in stems and leaves of all species decreased with increasing cutting intervals. Phosphorus concentrations in leucaena and associate grasses were similar and declined little with age. Leucaena was lower in potassium but higher in calcium concentration than the associated grasses. The results of this study are discussed in relation to the management of leucaena in mixed pastures for dairy production in Thailand.

TI  - Performance of soil macrofauna in pure natural grasslands or intercropped with leucaena for bull fattening
PY  - 2002

AB  - For three consecutive years, the performance of soil macrofauna was studied in two types of grasslands with fattening cattle: a) native grassland, b) native grassland with Leucaena leucocephala in 100% of the area. The individuals number and biomass of the soil macrofauna were determined, as well as its temperature and humidity percentage. A linear model of fixed effects that controlled the type of grassland, the year and the grassland x year interaction was used. The results showed a higher biomass value (53.66 versus 31.36 g/m2) in the leucaena system, compared to the native grassland. There was a significant increase of the soil humidity percentage in the b) system. Soil temperature and the number of macrofauna individuals showed interaction (P < 0.01) between the grassland types and the studied years. Three phyla (Arthropoda, Annelida and Mollusca), five classes and seven orders were identified in the diversity of the groups. The presence of three genera of the phylum Annelida (Polypheretima, Onychochaeta and Diplotrema) was found. It is concluded that the high biomass values of the edaphic fauna found in the system with Leucaena leucocephala is due, among other factors, to the presence of a greater plant diversity, a larger amount of better quality leaf litter and a more favorable microenvironment for macrofauna activity due to a higher soil humidity. The introduction of leucaena in livestock production systems is recommended since it supplies shade and feed to the animals and stimulates and diversifies the soil biological activity.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit is a legume used as forage of high nutritive value and acceptability. Those characteristics make it an alternative for animal feeding and production. It is well known that Heteropsylla cubana Crawfort (Hompotera:Psylidae) is the most significant pest affecting this legume. This study was aimed at increasing the knowledge on the behavior and distribution of this psyllid in leucaena crops. Thus, samplings were carried out for two years in a leucaena grassland. Data were collected to calculate the spatial localization in each month. Ninety-one percent of the months were classified as contagion and the rest as regular. The annual temporal localization was also determined and classified as contagion with an agglomeration of isolated psyllids and a binomial negative probability distribution of data. Finally, the optimum sample size (1433 trappings/year) was calculated under similar conditions.

AB  - A greenhouse experiment was carried out with the objective of evaluating the effects of the elementary sulphur inoculated with Thiobacillus, compared with gypsum, in the amendment of a alluvial sodic saline soil from the Brazilian semiarid region, irrigated with saline water and grown with the tropical legumes leucena and mimosa. The treatments consisted of levels of sulphur (0; 300 and 600 kg/ha) and gypsum (1200 and 2400 kg/ha), irrigation using different waters containing the salts NaHCO3, MgCl2, CaCl2, NaCl and KCl, with different electrical conductivities (ECs: 0.2, 6.1 and 8.2 dS/m at 25°C). Based on the results it appears that saline water increased exchangeable Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and soil pH. Sulphur inoculated with Thiobacillus was more efficient than gypsum in the reduction of the exchangeable sodium of the soil and promoting leaching of salts, especially sodium. Sulphur inoculated with Thiobacillus reduced the EC of the soil saturation extract to levels below that adopted in soil classification of sodic or saline sodic. Leucena was more tolerant to salinity and mimosa more resistant to acidity promoted by sulphur inoculated with Thiobacillus. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An investigation was carried out to assess the role that P solubilizing microorganisms play in the P nutrition of mycorrhizal and mycorrhiza-free Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.). Soil microorganisms able to solubilize rock phosphate were isolated from the rhizosphere of L. leucocephala naturally growing on three different soils of Hawaii. The isolates were screened for their ability to solubilize rock phosphate in culture medium. The highest activity was observed with one o.f the fungal isolates, which was identified as Mortierella sp. It was multiplied and further evaluated with or without the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus aggregatum in a highly weathered soil for its effectiveness to enhance P uptake and growth of L. leucocephala. Phosphorus status of L. leucocephala pinnules monitored as a function of time revealed that plants colonized by both microorganisms had the highest P content followed by plants inoculated with the mycorrhizal fungus alone. Inoculation of soil with Mortierella sp. alone did not influence P content of plants measured at the time of harvest. However, Mortierella sp. increased the P content of mycorrhizal plants by 13% in the unfertilized soil and by 73% in the soil fertilized with rock phosphate. Shoot dry weight measurements showed that Mortierella sp. stimulated growth of nonmycorrhizal by 22%, while it stimulated the growth of myocorrhizal plants by 29%, regardless of P fertilization. The results suggest the existence of synergistic interaction between P solubilizing microorganisms and mycorrhizal fungi, although the degree of synergism was more pronounced in terms of P uptake than in terms of growth.

AB  - Ensifer adhaerens is a soil bacterium that attaches to other bacteria and may cause lysis of these other bacteria. Based on the sequence of its small-subunit rRNA gene, E. adhaerens is related to Sinorhizobium spp. E. adhaerens ATCC 33499 did not nodulate Phaseolus vulgaris (bean) or Leucaena leucocephala, but with symbiotic plasmids from Rhizobium tropici CFN299 it formed nitrogen-fixing nodules on both hosts. The nodule isolates were identified as E. adhaerens isolates by growth on selective media.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the shoot biomass of gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) in an alley cropping system and the addition effect of this biomass on the chemical and physical properties of a Yellow Latosol of a coastal tableland area, at Sergipe State, Brazil. The yield of cassava cultivated in the alleys of these legumes was also evaluated. Gliricidia was planted by cuttings in 1994, and leucaena was planted by seedlings in 1995, in rows of 3 m apart. At periods of three to five months, cuts were carried on and the shoot biomass was incorporated to the soil. Stems with diameter higher than 1 cm were not considered in the biomass weight. The dry matter obtained in these cuts was expressed in ton ha-1 year-1. In 1998, soil samples were taken to quantify some soil chemical and physical properties. Soil samples from a neighbor area were used as control. Leucaena and gliricidia yield were, respectively, 4.87 and 5.80 ton ha-1 year-1 of shoot dry matter. Gliricidia showed a lesser competition to cassava in the interrows. The incorporation of shoot biomass of both legumes to the soil caused an increment in the values of pH and Ca+Mg, but has not affected organic matter content and CEC. Decreases of the soil density and increases of the porosity were also observed in response to legume incorporation. These effects were most noticeable in the superficial layers.

AB  - A litterbag experiment of 12 weeks was conducted to study nitrogen mineralization process of prunings of six nitrogen-fixing hedgerow species in a dry valley of the Jinsha River. Prunings were incorporated into soil or used as mulch. The results indicated that pruning N of the six hedgerow species was mineralized fast in the first week and then decreased slowly in the rest of the study period. When prunings were incorporated into soil, the amount of nitrogen mineralized by the end of the first week accounted for 69.9%, 58.2%, 54.5%, 43.0%, 29.6% and 20.6% of the total N in prunings of Desmodium rensonii, Tephrosia Candida, Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia yunnanensis, Acacia dealbata, and Acacia mearnsii, respectively. When prunings of L. leucocephala were used as mulch materials, the amount of nitrogen mineralized in the first week was 16.2% less than that of prunings incorporated into soil. The mineralization pattern of pruning N could be simulated by an exponent model Nt% = N 01% (1 - exp(-k1t))+ N02% (1 - exp(-k 2t)) where Nt% is cumulative mineralized N in time t, N01 % and N02 % are readily and less readily mineralizable N in prunings, respectively, and k1 and k2 are rate constants. A half-life period of pruning nitrogen mineralization could also be determined by this model. The nitrogen content in the pruning residues decreased quickly in the first week but fluctuated thereafter. The initial C/N ratio was negatively related to the mineralization rate of prunings. © 2002 Science Press.

AB  - The in situ ruminal degradation of the dry matter (DM) and fiber fraction (NDF) of four tropical forage trees was analyzed. The leaves and petioles of the trees were harvested. The chemical composition of the forages was studied. The in situ nylon bag incubation technique was used to study the degradation of feedstuffs in two Holstein bulls with rumen cannula fed star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis). The DM and NDF were determined on the digestion residues, and the indicators characterizing the magnitude and extent of degradation were estimated. Gliricidia showed the highest nutrient values and was less degraded in the rumen, followed by leucaena: 63.37% and sapindus: 56.48%, while the Enterlobium cyclocarpum was poorly degraded: 33.48%. Fiber degradation was similar to that of the DM (77.43, 58.81, 43.49 and 31.04%, respectively). The DM degradation rate was higher in gliricidia (0.070/hr) and no differences were found between the other plants (0.030, 0.026 and 0.03/hr). The results showed the high levels of protein and low fiber levels of these forage trees compared to grasses, allowing their use as a supplement to balance low quality pasture and forage diets.

AB  - The effect of the number of furrows and the optimum time of vigna and maize intercropping on the establishment of an agricultural ecosystem of Leucaena-guinea grass cv likoni were studied using a typical red ferrallitic soil with a random block design and four replications. Treatments consisted of A) Leucaena intercropped with 3 vigna and 3 guinea grass furrows sown after the vigna harvest. B) Leucaena intercropped with 2 maize and 1 guinea grass furrows. C) Leucaena intercropped with 2 vigna and 1 guinea grass furrows, D) Leucaena intercropped with 1 guinea grass furrow (control). The highest production (P < 0.05) of vigna grains (0.75 t/ha) was obtained when furrows were sown within a double row of leucaena in May and the 3 furrows of guinea grass were sown later in July. This treatment showed the highest yield of crop residues (4.4 t/ha DM), differing (P < 0.001) from that of vigna (2.25 t/ha). Maize yield was affected by rodent attacks. The number of plants/m2 (4.0-5.3), height (99-127 cm), stems/plant (9.6-10.1) and yield (0.14-0.19 t/ha DM) of Ieucaena was similar in all treatments. The smallest plants (58 cm) and highest CP content (12.21 %) of guinea grass cv likoni was obtained when planting in July, after the vigna harvest. Three vigna furrows sown in May and 3 guinea grass furrows in July was the treatment that contributed with more biomass to the system (7.69 t/ha DM) and 0.79 t/ha of CP. Furthermore, this treatment offered good net returns (2750.55 Cuban pesos). It is concluded that intercropping these crops did not affect the establishment of Ieucaena and guinea grass cv likoni, and that the best economic, production and total biomass quality alternative was treatment A: Leucaena intercropped with 3 vigna furrows in May and 3 guinea grass furrows sown after the vigna harvest in July.

AB  - Four surveys which gathered information from rural communities on useful tree species in Vanuatu have been reviewed and summarized. The surveys were undertaken from 1990 to 1993 and concentrated on species used for fuelwood and local construction. One survey also reported tree species useful for other purposes, such as fruit and nuts, edible foliage and customary uses. There were regional differences in species choices that could be related to the Northern, Central and Southern regions of the country. Popular fuelwood species included Macaranga spp., Hibiscus tiliaceus, Kleinhovia hospita, Dysoxylon spp. and the introduced Leucaena leucocephala. In general, people did not perceive any shortage of fuelwood. There were differences in preferences for fuelwood, depending on whether wood was required for open-fire pot cooking, open-fire roasting, or laplap (a kind of earth oven). Popular species for ground poles included Hibiscus tiliaceus, Flueggia flexuosa, Macaranga spp., Pterocarpus indicus, Bischofia javanica and Intsia bijuga, with some variations in preference between regions. Preferred species for aerial timbers for house construction included Macaranga spp., Flueggia flexuosa, Ficus spp., Kleinhovia hospita and Alphitonia zizyphoides. Species providing commercial timbers, such as Endospermum medullosum, Santalum austro-caledonicum and Intsia bijuga, are valued and are being planted, or wildlings cared for, on-farm. Important fruit and nut trees included Barringtonia edulis, Canarium spp., Syzygium malaccense, Pometia pinnata, Inocarpus fagifer, Burckella obovata and Dracontomelon vitiense. Tree species having multiple importance in customary use, such as Hibiscus tiliaceus, Macaranga spp., Intsia bijuga, Casuarina equisetifolia, Flueggia flexuosa, Kleinhovia hospita, Leucaena leucocephala, Barringtonia edulis and Acacia spp., are ranked highly.

Compound 1 showed strong leaf-closing activity toward L. leucocephala and was not effective against other nyctinastic plants. The potassium ion was indispensable for the bioactivity of 1. Compound 1 gradually lost its bioactivity because of the exchange of the counter cation during isolation.

AB  - Leaves and twigs from shrub species consumed by range goats: Acacia berlandieri, Acacia farnesiana, Acacia greggii, Acacia rigidula, Celtis pallida, Cercidium macrum, Condalia obovata, Cordia boissieri, Desmanthus virgathus, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucophyllum texanum, Opuntia lindehimieri, Porlieria angustifolia, Prosopis glandulosa, and Ziziphus obtusifolia were evaluated for comparative seasonal contents of Ca, P, Mg K, Zn, Mn, Cu and Fe. Plants were collected in summer (September 12, 1992), fall (November 20, 1992), winter (February 20, 1993) and spring (May 22, 1993) in Marín, County, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. During spring and summer mineral concentrations were higher in general. Only Ca, Mg, K, and Fe were in substantial amounts in all seasons to meet adult goat requirements. With the exception of spring, shrubs had extremely low P concentrations. Manganese, Cu and Zn in most plants had low marginal levels to meet adult goat requirements. Moreover, potential intake of P, Mn, Cu and Zn in shrub species by goats weighing 50 kg BW consuming 2.0 kg per day DM was low. However, plants such as D. virgathus, L. texanum, P. glandulosa, L. leucocephala and C. macrum can be considered prominent components in diets of range goats because of their high mineral concentrations. It appears that ration formulations for range goats in northeastern Mexico should include P, Mn, Cu and Zn in all seasons of the year. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Gum was isolated from Leucæna leucocephala seeds and was subjected to preformulation studies including toxicity studies, for its suitability as a pharmaceutical adjuvant. Leucaena gum has been further evaluated as a suspending agent. Zinc oxide suspensions were prepared with different concentrations of Leucæna gum and tragacanth, and compared. The outcome of these investigations shows that Leucæna seed gum did not possess acute toxicity since its LD50, when determined on either sex of mice, was found to be very high (1850.23 mg/kg). Studies indicate that this gum may be used as a pharmaceutical adjuvant and as a suspending agent depending on its suspending ability and suspension stability.

AB  - This study was conducted to examine the effect of Leucaena leucocephala-Morus alba-Azadirachta indica (2:1:1) based leaf meal mixture as nitrogen source to partially replace (50%) soybean meal in conventional supplements on the performance of goats. Twelve non-descript female goats were divided into two equal groups in a completely randomized design to receive either the leaf meal mixture based supplement (LMAM) or soybean meal incorporated concentrate (SBM) and wheat straw for ad libitum intake for a two month period. The goats given LMAM and SBM concentrate had similar dry matter intake (50.2±1.67 g/kg W0.75) and nutrient digestibility. Nitrogen intake and its faecal and urinary excretion were similar irrespective of diets. The balance of nitrogen was positive and comparable (1.63±0.08 g/d) in both dietary treatments. The plane of nutrition on both diets was comparable and the digestible crude protein and total digestible nutrients values of the composite diets offered did not differ significantly between the dietary supplements. The serum concentration of enzymes alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were statistically similar in both the groups, while haemoglobin and serum urea levels were significantly (p<0.05) higher in LMAM and SBM treatments, respectively. It was concluded that the leaf meal mixture of Leucaena leucocephala-Morus alba-Azadirachta indica could be used as a vegetable protein supplement to wheat straw based diet of goats.

AB  - This work aimed to estimate the variability of some morphological characteristics in hybrids of Leucaena. Twenty genotypes, with 30 individuals each, of hybrids between L. leucocephala and L. diversifolia were established in a randomized blocks design with six repetitions. Leaf length, number of pinnae and leaflet pairs, number of extrafloral nectaries, legume length and width and number of seeds per legume were analyzed. Leaf length average values ranged from 8.6 cm to 30.6 cm. Number of leaflets per pinna ranged from 10.7 to 53.4 and the number of pinnae per leaf ranged from 5.6 to 20.3. Most of the individuals presented an average of 1.0 extrafloral nectary per leaf. The highest average value of number of seeds per legume was 24.1 and the lowest 5.0. Five genotypes were the most uniform considering the characteristics analyzed.

AB  - Performance of three exotic species of Leucaena (L. diversifolia, L. shannonii and L. leucocephala) and one local selection of L. leucocephala was evaluated on sodic soil sites (pH 8.6-10.5) in order to select promising species for biomass production and reclamation of these soils. There were significant differences among three species with respect to their field survival (47.7-95.5 per cent), growth in terms of stem volume (40.8-118.6 m3 ha-1) and biomass production (24-70 Mg ha-1) after eight years of growth. L. leucocephala was rated as the most promising species irrespective of seed source, followed by L. shannonii. L. diversifolia could not perform well on these hostile soils. A definite improvement in physicochemical properties of soil particularly in surface layers (0-5 cm) was observed after eight years of plantations as compared to the same at uncultivated site. The soil pH and sodium content decreased followed by an increase in organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content. However, efficiency of different species varied greatly to ameliorate these soils depending on quantity and quality of organic matter lying on the floor. L. leucocephala, irrespective of seed origin, showed greater promise for afforestation of sodic soils because of its potential to produce higher biomass per unit area and greater efficiency to ameliorate fertility status of these soils. The study revealed that matching of species to soil conditions is very important for a successful plantation programme and sustainable development of degraded soil sites. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - It is important to know the seasonal cycles of reserve carbohydrates in agroforestry trees because their ability to sprout after cutting may depend on reserve carbohydrate levels. Such information is lacking for tropical agroforestry trees. Reserve carbohydrate trends were examined in uncut, 12-year-old multipurpose trees in the seasonally dry climate of Ibadan, Nigeria. Species included Dactyladenia barteri, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Pterocarpus soyauxii, and Senna siamea. Definite seasonal trends were observed. Concentrations of sugar and total reserve carbohydrates (sugar+starch) were highest during the dry season. Starch had two maxima, one early in the dry season, and one early in the wet season. Conversion of starch to sugar seemed to occur as trees developed drought tolerance. All carbohydrate values decreased as active growth resumed during the wet season. In general, all carbohydrate values were relatively low as active growth continued; they increased only when dry weather slowed growth. In several species, carbohydrate concentrations in the lower boles decreased during reproductive growth, especially during the last phase of fruit maturation. Significant linear correlations were found between concentrations of sugar and total reserve carbohydrates and a number of weather variables - rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation. Correlations with starch were much lower than for sugar, although several were significant, suggesting that seasonal trends in starch are too complex to be described adequately by linear correlations. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This study determined the effects of forest topsoil + leaf-litter mixture of four common plantation tree species (Acacia auriculiformis, Artocarpus chaplasha, Dipterocarpus turbinatus and Eucalyptus camaldulensis) on the germination and initial seedling growth of Leucaena leucocephala. The topsoil of adjacent bushy scrub forest area served as control. Highest germination occurred in the topsoil + leaf-litter mixture (90:10) of Dipterocarpus turbinatus, whereas, the topsoil + leaf-litter mixture of Acacia auriculiformis caused maximum stimulation in the seedling growth and biomass production in L. leucocephala. Mixtures of topsoil + leaf-litter mixture (50:50) of Eucalyptus camaldulensis caused greatest inhibition in germination and seedling growth of L. leucocephala. These results demonstrated the allelopathic effects of E. camaldulensis leaf-litter on L. leucocephala. © International Allelopathy Foundation 2002.

AB  - Galactomannans extracted from Cassia fastuosa (CF) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL) seeds were purified and oxidized with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) to form the uronic acid-containing polysaccharides CFOX with a degree of oxidation (DO) of 0.22 and LLOX with DO of 0.66, respectively. The adsorption behavior of CFOX and LLOX onto amino-terminated surfaces was studied by means of ellipsometric measurements. The influence of pH and ionic strength on the adsorption was investigated. A strong dependence of pH on the adsorbed amount of CFOX and LLOX was observed. At pH 4, there was a maximum in the adsorbed amount caused by strong electrostatic attraction between the substrate and the oxidized galactomannans. On the other hand, no ionic strength effect on the adsorption of CFOX and LLOX was observed. The immobilization of bovine serum albumin onto LLOX and CFOX was studied as a function of pH. LLOX proved to be a more attractive substrate for BSA than CFOX, indicating that the favorable interactions between the carboxylate groups and the BSA segments have driven the adsorption process. At the isoelectric point of BSA a maximum in the adsorbed amount was found for both surfaces. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An investigation was undertaken to test the hypothesis that amending peat to increase its P buffer capacity and optimizing the P concentration of the amended medium for mycorrhizal activity will enhance its usefulness for raising mycorrhizal seedlings of tree species. The approaches entailed mixing a small quantity of soil of high P adsorbing capacity with peat and constructing a P sorption isotherm for the medium in order to establish solution P concentration near-optimal to optimal for mycorrhization of seedlings. A P sorption isotherm based on incubating the medium with graded amounts of P at 50% of available water-holding capacity was developed. Target solution P concentrations established using the approach enabled us to identify the optimal solution P concentration for mycorrhizal development on roots of our indicator plant Leucaena leucocephala grown in the medium. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization, host growth, and P status of L. leucocephala pinnules measured at target solution P concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 1.0 mg L-1 revealed that AM fungal activity and symbiotic effectiveness was maximum at solution P concentration of 0.2 mg P L-1. Medium solution P concentrations in excess of 0.2 mg L-1 tended to depress AM fungal colonization, but colonization level did not decline below 43%. Copyright © 2001 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The disappearance of dry matter (DM), nitrogen and cell wall constituents of the pods of Leucaena leucocephaia and some Acacia species incubated in the rumen of Jersey cattle was studied. The chemical compositions of the pods (seeds+husks), seeds and husks were examined separately. Amino acid and lipid analyses were limited to the pods and seeds, while mineral and tannin analyses were done on the pods alone. The seeds had higher crude protein (CP) contents than the pods, with values ranging from 200 to 300 g CPkg-1 DM. The Leucaena pods and seeds had higher (p>0.001) CP contents than the Acacia pods and seeds. The neutral detergent fibre concentrations in the husks were higher than in the pods and seeds with the pods of A erioloba having the highest and those of A nilotica the lowest values. These values were highly influenced by the seed/husk ratio. A sieberiana and Leucaena had the highest and lowest concentrations of condensed tannins respectively. The pods of A tortilis and A karoo were particularly rich in macro- and micro-minerals, while the others contained sufficient quantities that could contribute substantially to the dietary requirements of small ruminants. The amino acid concentrations differed significantly (p<0.001) among the pods, with the Leucaena pods having the highest concentrations. The Leucaena pods and seeds also had higher (p<0.001) lipid contents than the Acacia pods and seeds. Dry matter and nitrogen degradabilities were higher (p<0.001) for the pods of A nilotica and A sieberiana, while A karoo had the lowest values. The cell wall constituents of the pods of A tortilis and A erioloba were the most and the least susceptible to microbial degradation respectively. The rates of degradation of the fibre fractions as well as the lag times were similar (p>0.05) among the pods. The results show that these pods can serve as a valuable source of nitrogen and minerals for ruminants fed roughage-based diets. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Twelve adult male goats, comprising of six castrated and six intacts, (2.5-3 years; 24.4±0,62 kg) were randomly but evenly divided into two groups (I0 and I100) and fed conventional concentrate mixture along with Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (100 g/head approx.), the latter to supply 50 per cent of the crude protein (CP) requirements. The I100 group was provided with supplemental iodine as potassium iodide solution at 0.1 mg/day/animal. Wheat straw was provided ad libitum as sole source of roughage during the experimental period of 105 d. Blood samples were collected at the begining (0 d) and thereafter at 30, 60 and 90 d of experimental feeding. The study revealed that the serum glucose level was significantly higher (p<0.01) in I100 group as compared to I0. Haemoglobin, packed cell volume and serum concentrations of total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, inorganic phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase did not show significant differences as a result of iodine supplementation. Though the serum levels of triiodothyronine (T3) were comparable between the two groups, that of thyroxine (T4) increased significantly (p<0.001) in the I100 group. The T3:T4 ratio was also similar between both the groups. The study indicated that the adverse effect of Leucaena feeding on thyroid gland could possibly be alleviated by provision of extra iodine. However, this needs further confirmation using long duration studies.

AB  - Three groups of dairy cattle were compared under different pasture production systems viz, strip-grazed on pure ruzi grass (Brachiaria ruziziensis), strip-grazed on a ruzi-leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) pasture or strip-grazed on lablab (Lablab purpureus) in the morning and on pure ruzi in the afternoon. In 1995, all cows received concentrate (14% CP; 70% TDN) at 1 kg per 3 kg of milk per day. Cows receiving leucaena or lablab in combination with grass produced higher daily milk yields (13.6 and 14.4 kg/cow, respectively) and fat percentage (4.2 and 4.5%) than those on pure grass alone (11.9 kg/cow at 4.0% fat). However, when all cows received concentrate at 4 kg/cow in the 1996 trial, pasture production systems had no effect on milk production. Milk composition (fat, solids-not-fat, total solids, protein and lactose) was unaffected by pasture system in 1996. Growing tree legumes with grass or sowing of pure herbaceous legume swards adjacent to grass swards will support satisfactory milk yields in dairy cattle in Thailand. The economics of the various systems are discussed.

AB  - The hypothesis that South African game animals that use browse containing condensed tannins (CT) could have rumen microbial populations better able to ferment tanniniferous forages was explored. Rumen fluid (RF) from a range of browsing ruminants was used to ferment tanniniferous forages in vitro and the results were compared with the values obtained with rumen fluid from sheep. Leaves of the shrub legumes Leucaena leucocephala, L. pallida, L. trichandra, Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium, and Acacia boliviana were used as substrates. In vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD) and nitrogen (IVND) was measured in the presence or absence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 to assess the adverse effects of the CT in the feeds. Rumen fluid from giraffe, greater kudu, eland, duiker, impala, nyala, goat, and gnu was compared with that from sheep. Ability to metabolise or block the adverse effects of CT was expected to result in only a small or no response to PEG in terms of IVDMD and IVND with rumen fluid from browsers, and therefore to result in a significant animal × feed and animal × PEG interaction. There were no significant (P > 0.05) animal × feed interactions. For every animal species there was a response to PEG in terms of IVND, and this response was linearly related to the CT in the feed as measured by PEG binding using 14C-labelled PEG. Rumen fluid from browsers had a lower pH (5.78 ± 0.060 v. 6.68 ± 0.052) and a higher dry matter content (1473 ± 102 mg v. 415 ± 4.3 mg/100 mL RF) than that of grazers (sheep and gnu). However, when measured at 2 pH levels (6.7 and 5.8), IVDMD and IVND of the feeds were not improved at the lower pH with rumen fluid from the browsers. Rather, digestibility was depressed at the lower pH with rumen fluid from all animal species. We conclude from these in vitro studies that rumen microbial populations from browsers are not able to ferment tanniniferous forages better than rumen microbial populations from grazers. It seems likely that these browsers do not have rumen bacteria capable of degrading the CT in these shrub legumes. Production on such tanniniferous feeds may well depend on tannin binding with proline-rich saliva rather than on metabolism of or tolerance to CT by rumen bacteria.

AB  - Biometric data (wing, third primary, tail and tarsus length) were collected from 3, 034 Skylarks Alauda arvensis on autumn migration in 1998 and 1999 at Ischitella (Caserta), along the southern Tyrrhenian coastline. There was a clear bimodality in wing, third primary and tail lengths due to sexual size dimorphism. The distributions of biometrics were used with Harding-Cassie plots to separate males from females. On this basis, over the two-year study, between 47.7% (1999) and 56.3% (1998) of birds caught at Ischitella were females and between 31.8% (1998) and 40.7% (1999) were males. The remaining 11.6 to 11.9% had intermediate values of wing, tail and primary length and were not sexed. These sex ratios were very different from those estimated for north European populations, where males predominated in catches. © 2001 British Trust for Ornithology.

AB  - A greenhouse investigation was conducted to determine the effect of arbuscular mycorrhiza and drought on the growth of two tropical hedgerow legume trees (Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala) under simulated eroded soil conditions. It was a factorial design with two levels of watering regime (adequate watering and drought), inoculation with Glomus deserticola (with and without), and two soil types (0-30 cm topsoil and 30-60 cm subsoil). Each treatment was replicated 3 times. After ten drought cycles, the growth of Gliricidia sepium in the subsoil was enhanced by mycorrhizal inoculation under both watering regimes whereas there was no significant contribution of mycorrhizal inoculation to the growth of L. leucocephala in both soil types under the two watering regimes. Drought stress significantly reduced most growth parameters for the two tree species in both soils with or without fungal inoculation. The N-fixing activity of Gliricidia sepium benefited from Glomus deserticola inoculation while that of L. leucocephala was not significantly affected in the top-soil. Mycorrhizal colonization was reduced for both tree species in the subsoil compared to the topsoil while it was significantly increased for both species in the subsoil when compared to the uninoculated subsoil counterpart. In the subsoil, inoculation of Gliricidia sepium with the mycorrhizal fungus increased root colonization by 89% and 73% under adequate watering and drought, respectively, whereas L. leucocephala had only a 38% and 42% increase in root colonization under comparative conditions in the subsoil. Thus Glomus deserticola inoculation may be beneficial to the growth of Gliricidia sepium in a badly eroded site where topsoil is missing.

AB  - The expediency of replacing cost prohibitive and often inaccessible traditional protein supplements prompted the current investigation of blood biochemical profile and rumen fermentation pattern in local female goats (12) and rumen fistulated bucks (3), respectively fed supplements containing either a leaf meal mixture (LMTM) of Leucaena leucocephala-Morus alba-Tectona grandis (2:1:1) or traditional protein supplements groundnut cake (GNC) or soybean meal (SBM) and wheat straw as basal diet. The periodic monitoring of hematological parameters was carried out in female goats at 0, 30, 60 and 90 days post feeding. Rumen environment was studied in bucks in a 3×3 switch over design. Rumen liquor was collected at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post feeding after 4 weeks of feeding. The goats fed on LMTM or GNC had similar dry matter intake (g/kg W0.75), which was significantly (p<0.05) higher than SBM. Except for packed cell volume (PCV), none of the blood biochemical constituents (Hemoglobin, serum glucose, total protein, serum albumin (A) and globulin(G), A:G ratio, alkaline phosphatase, transaminases) varied significantly due to replacement of 50% dietary protein by LMTM throughout the experiment. GNC group had significantly higher level of PCV than other treatments. However, the level of serum total protein (p<0.01) tended to increase from 60th day onwards irrespective of dietary treatments. The average rumen pH was significantly higher (p<0.001) on SBM followed by LMTM and GNC, respectively. Total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) production was comparable in goats given LMTM or GNC supplements, the corresponding values were significantly different (p<0.001) when compared with SBM. The ammonical-N, total-N and TCA-precipitable-N (mg/100 ml SRL) did not differ significantly among dietary treatments. It may be concluded that supplementing wheat straw with LMTM based concentrate had no adverse effect on voluntary intake, blood biochemical profile and rumen fermentation pattern of the goats.

AB  - Cocoa nib dust, groundnut testa and dry leaves of Leuceana leucocephala significantly increased the yield of the mushroom. The best supplement was groundnut testa, which increased the yield by 57%. Yields were however reduced by the inorganic supplements used: Epsom salt, urea and NPK fertilizer (23:15:5). Epsom salt increased the pileus diameter and weight at 0.2% but the other supplements did not affect the morphology.

AB  - Seasonal variation in forage quality and mimosine contents of two varieties (cultivars Cunningham and Spectra) of Leucaena leucocepha/a were evaluated. Cultivar (cv.) Cunningham was available throughout summer, autumn, winter and spring seasons while cv. Spectra was available during summer, winter and spring seasons. Differences in crude protein (CP) and mimosine contents of young Cunningham and Spectra leaves were not significant. Also, difference in mimosine contents of mature leaves of both cultivars were not significantly different. But mean CP content of mature Spectra leaves was significantly higher (24.9 vs 18.7%, p = 0.023) than that of leaves of mature Cunningham. Mean P content of young Spectra leaves was significantly higher (1.6 vs 2.10gkg−1, p = 0.046) than that of young Cunningham leaves but mean Cu content of young Cunningham leaves was higher (10.5 vs 9.0mgkg−1, p = 0.06) than that of young Spectra leaves. Mature leaves of cv. Spectra also had higher P content (2.3 vs 1.6gkg−1, p = 0.06), but lower Ca (20.8 vs 30.5gkg−1, p = 0.06) and Mg (5.6 vs 7.6gkg−1, p = 0.06) contents than those of mature Cunningham leaves, Apart from CP, fat and mimosine, other analysed constituents increased with plant maturity. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Acacia auriculiformis is a fast growing species planted on vertisols in Benin. An inventory of 11 mixed stands of Acacia, which are 7 to 9 years old, has been realized to estimate growth parameters of the stands. The present study shows that, for the dendrometrical parameters, there is no difference between species associations at a 0.05 significance level. Nevertheless, the largest values of quadratic mean diameter of the stems foot are observed in the species associations including Leucaena leucocephala. Moreover, the branch volume decreases with the increasing of the number of stems per tree. The most appropriate volume function for Acacia auriculiformis is the one that takes into account the diameter of the stems foot and the total height. Otherwise, the species associations do not influence the profile of Acacia trees, which is constant within the associations. The predicted conversion and cutting coefficients show that the stacked wood volume represents about 144 % of the real stand volume. © 2002 FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX.

AB  - An experiment was conducted at Suwanvajokkasikit Research Station, Pakchong, Nakornratchasima, Thailand, to determine the yield and quality of three different grass cultivars intercropped with leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). The treatments consisted of three grass cultivars (ruzi, dwarf napier and Taiwan A25) as the main plots, planted between leucaena at three row spacings (1, 2 and 4 m width) as the sub plots and leucaena cutting height (10 and 25 cm above ground levels) as sub-sub-plots. Dwarf napier consistently produced more dry matter than Taiwan A25 or ruzi and Taiwan A25 outyielded ruzi. Leucaena yield was highest in the ruzi plot and lowest in the dwarf napier plot. However, yields of grass plus leucaena were highest in the dwarf napier plot and were lowest in the ruzi plots. The difference was due mainly to the grass components. Increasing the spacing between rows of leucaena resulted in a lower leucaena yield but the reverse was true for the grasses. Cutting of leucaena at 10 cm above ground levels depressed yields of leucaena but did not affect the associated grasses. In terms of herbage quality, it was found that the crude protein of leaves and stems of the dwarf napier and Taiwan A25 were higher than that of the ruzi grass. Leucaena gave higher levels of crude protein than all grasses. The phosphorus and potassium levels of all grasses were higher than leucaena. ADF levels were higher in the grasses than in the legumes. Nutrient contents in the leaves and stems of grasses and leucaena were not affected by leucaena spacing and cutting height.

AB  - We describe the first verified nests, eggs, and nestlings of the Nightingale Reed-Warbler (Acrocephalus luscinia), an endangered species endemic to the Mariana Islands, Micronesia. Nest composition, nest dimensions, and eggs were studied on the island of Saipan. Nests were located within three habitat types: upland introduced tangantangan (Leucaena leucocephala) forest, a native mangrove (Bruguiera gymnorrhiza) wetland, and a native reed (Phragmites karka) wetland. Nesting substrates included five native and two introduced tree species and one native reed species. Nests were composed primarily of dry vine stems, needle-like branchlets of ironwood (Casuarina equisetifolia), and tangantangan petioles. Nests were compact to bulky in construction and were secured to a forked arrangement of branches or stems. The background color of eggs ranged from white to cream to ivory-buff. Eggs were spotted, speckled, and blotched with gray, brown, black, and rust colored markings. Clutch size was 2-4, with a mode of two. Hatchlings were altricial with closed eyelids and devoid of natal down with dark gray to black skin. Nestlings examined prior to fledging resembled the adult plumage, except for the lack of the yellow supercilium found in adults. The nests and eggs have some characteristics similar to those of other Acrocephaline warblers found throughout Micronesia and Polynesia.

TI  - From alley cropping to rotational fallow: Farmers' involvement in the development of fallow management techniques in the humid forest zone of Cameroon
PY  - 2002

AB  - Alley cropping was introduced in the humid forest zone of Cameroon to increase soil fertility in 1987, but until 1992 the adoption rate had remained low. To better understand the reasons behind this, three types of on farm trials were established from fully researcher controlled to fully farmer controlled. During the evaluation of the technology with farmers a number of modifications were registered (1) Pruning height and frequency: Because of the difficulties to consistently cut back at 30 cm, farmers decided to slash at ground level as they normally do while slashing the natural fallow vegetation. This equally allowed for more flexibility in time of pruning. (2) Cropping intensity and pattern: Initially, alleys were cropped each year. This however had several shortcomings. Having observed the positive impact of incidental fallow period in a farmer's field, it was decided to introduce a fallow phase of at least one year. During the fallow period the plot can be used for fodder production, bee farming and production of stakes. (3) Residue management: Fire went incidentally in a farmer's tree plot after slashing, and the trees were not affected. This gave farmers an alternative way to manage the residue, by controlling the fire, before bringing in other crops such as groundnut and cassava. (4) Agroforestry species: Because Leucaena leucocephala, in spite of it soil fertility restoration potential, rapidly became a noxious weed, farmers have asked for a less invasive species. Calliandra calothyrsus was introduced for this purpose and became a good bee forage. With these modifications, the original alley cropping system has evolved into a rotational tree fallow with higher adoption potential. From about 15 farmers who were testing the technology in 1992, the number increased to 52 in 1996, 120 in 1997 and 236 in 1998.

AB  - To rehabilitate a degraded Alfisol at Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria, Senna siamea (non-N2-fixing legume tree), Leucaena leucocephala, and Acacia leptocarpa (N2-fixing legume trees) were planted in 1989, and Acacia auriculiformis (N2-fixing legume tree) in 1990. Pueraria phaseoloides (a cover crop) and natural fallow were included as treatments. Litterfall and climatic variables were measured in 1992/1993 and 1996/1997 while biomass production and nutrient concentrations were measured in 1993 and 1995. Total litter production from the natural and planted fallows was similar, with means ranging from 10.0 (L. leucocephala) to 13.6 t ha-1 y-1 (natural fallow) during the 1996/1997 collection. Leaves constituted 73% (L. leucocephala) to 96% (A. auriculiformis) of total litterfall. Acacia auriculiformis grew most quickly but S. siamea produced the highest aboveground biomass which was 127 t ha-1 accumulated over four years, and 156 t ha-1 accumulated over six years of establishment. The aboveground biomass of P. phaseoloides and natural fallow was only 6 to 9 t ha-1 at six years after planting. Nitrogen concentration in the leaves/twigs of was 2.5% for L. leucocephala, and 2% for other planted species and natural fallow. Pueraria phaseoloides had concentrations of P, K, Ca and Mg comparable to levels in the leaves/twigs of the tree species. Through PATH analysis, it was found that maximum temperature and minimum relative humidity had pronounced direct and indirect effects on litterfall. The effects of these climatic variables in triggering litterfall were enhanced by other variables, such as evaporation, wind, radiation, and minimum temperature. Improvement in chemical properties by fallows was observed in the degraded soil.

AB  - The coast of the Gulf of Mexico is characterized by dry regions with high variation in climatic conditions. This area is rich in drought-tolerant or subhumid species. The species that are potentially useful for reforestation, regreening, agroforestry activities and the production of timber, fodder, fuelwood and human food have been overexploited, resulting in the gradual decrease and degradation of their populations. This study was undertaken in order to suggest ways of improving the regeneration of these species. Fifteen native and exotic multipurpose tree species of low dry shrubland planted in monoculture in four randomized blocks. Measurements of various growth parameters, volume of trees, fodder potential and agroforestry uses over 15 years were evaluated. Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh., E. microtheca F. Muell., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. (exotic species), Acacia farnesiana (L.) Wild and Parkinsonia aculeata L. (native species) tend to have better characteristics in terms of growing annual rate, economic value and management schemes, while Prosopis glandulosa Torr. and Helietta parvifolia (Gray) Benth. (native species) did not establish well due to biotics problems which arose under plantation conditions. Acacia rigidula Benth., A. wrightii Benth. and two Pithecellobium spp. (native species) had intermediate yields of great interest since their multipurpose potential is the best of all 15 species. The forage potential of the exotic species (483-1684 kg DM/ha/year) were notably superior to native species (76-721 kg DM/ha/year). The firewood production volume varied between averages of 0.3-1.2 (native species) and 0.4-2.5 m3/ha/year (exotic species).

AB  - A random block design with six replications was used to study different methods for stimulating the asexual reproduction of Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru. The experiment lasted five months. The first treatment consisted of mixing 200 mg indoloacetic acid and 300 mg naphthalenacetic acid with 1 kg of zeolite powder (F-ICA-1). In the second experiment, 200 mg inadoloacetic acid and 1000 mg naphthalenacetic acid were mixed with zeolite (F-ICA-2). There was a control treatment with zeolite only. At the end of the experiment, the aerial parts of the plant showed an inverse performance to that of the roots in stimulant concentrations. The length of regrowths was 28.8 cm and DM yield was 32.81 g with F-ICA-2. No root development was observed. The values with F-ICA1 formula were 3.09 cm and 14.8 g DM, respectively. Five roots and 20 small roots 20 cm in length and a DM yield of 8.4 g were formed. The treatment with no auxins showed the poorest performance in all the indicators studied. It is concluded that a lower concentration of F-ICA-1 produced a more integral biological result. However, a longer duration experiment under field conditions, including a control with botanical seeds, is necessary.

AB  - Twenty-four multiparous female South African indigenous goats were used. Once a week during the 2nd (weeks 8, 11 and 14) and 3rd (weeks 18, 19 and 20) trimesters, between 08.00 and 15.00 h, four females per treatment were randomly selected and observed every 1 min for time spent grazing, browsing, ruminating and idling. Blood samples were taken once a week during the 2nd (weeks 8, 11 and 14) and 3rd (weeks 18, 19, 20 and 21) trimesters for measurements of some mineral elements and protein metabolites. Goats on natural pasture (NP) grazed 54-8 min (P < 0.001) more and browsed 53 min (P < 0.001) less than goats on Leucaena leucocephala-grass pasture (LGP) during the 2nd trimester. During the 3rd trimester, goats on NP treatments grazed and idled more (24.7 min, P = 0.004; 15.8 min, P = 0.044, respectively) but ruminated less (-24.1 min, P < 0.001) than LGP goats. Time allotted to each field activity by the goats on both treatments within trimester seemed to be dependent on forage species composition while activity between trimesters was possibly influenced by seasons, plant type, herbage quantity, environment and quality, and changes in stage of gestation of the goats. Blood Mg level on NP was higher (P = 0.051) than on LGP during the 2nd trimester while blood Cu and albumin contents on LGP were significantly higher (P = 0.029 and 0.022, respectively) than on NP during the 3rd trimester. Furthermore, blood concentrations of the haematological parameters (except serum protein) on both treatments were within the normal range for goats in the tropics and subtropics and perhaps explain the absence of mineral and nutrient deficiency symptoms. The absence of visible symptoms of mineral deficiency and mimosine toxicity in LGP goats can be attributed to the transfer of DHP-degrading rumen bacteria. The bacteria effectively detoxified mimosine and its metabolites, thereby overcoming chelating tendency of mimosine and its metabolites. Mimosine-susceptible pregnant SAIG can be safely grazed on LGP once their rumen is completely colonized by the DHP-degrading rumen bacteria (Synergistes jonesii).

PY  - 2002
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036383342&doi=10.1017%2fS0014479702000157&partnerID=40&md5=1cc52c2f51dc1c2b20b97b740e59cea8
AB  - Population pressure has diminished the role of the traditional bush fallow system in restoring the fertility of depleted soils following several years of cultivation in the derived savanna of southwest Nigeria. The search for alternative fallow systems led to the development of alley cropping using Leucaena leucocephala and cover cropping using Pueraria phaseoloides. These soil-conserving systems also embody the principles of sustainability by ensuring stable crop yields in spite of an increase in land-use intensity. Simulating smallholder farm conditions and based on a split-plot experiment with the three fallow systems as the main plots and four different land-use intensities (LUI) as the subplots, simple direct observation and record keeping were used to collect data on labour use in all farm operations including fuelwood cutting and stacking in alley cropping systems with fallow phases. Data collection covered a period of four years (1993-96), corresponding to one out of the three phases (or complete cycles) of the trial. Partial budget analysis was used to estimate profitability of cassava (Manihot utilissima)-maize (Zea mays) under each LUI. Results based on crop production indicate that each of the cassava-maize enterprises was profitable but the level of profit varied from 10 819 to 50 289 Naira ha-1. Production under cover cropping has a net benefit advantage of 4-25% (over that under bush fallow) and 25-60% (over alley cropping). Profitability increased as the LUI decreased, depicting the overall importance of fallow periods on soil fertility restoration. Results based on crop production plus fuelwood operations indicate that production with cover cropping has a net benefit advantage over that of both bush fallow and alley cropping under both zero-fallow and one-year fallow LUIs. However, results from two- and three-year fallows indicate that fuelwood yield generated sufficient revenue to put alley cropping at a net benefit advantage of 29-42% over bush fallow and 26-37% over cover cropping. From these results, cover cropping is recommended, especially to farmers in areas where, although land shortage is a problem, fuelwood and the other sources of domestic energy are still cheap and easily accessible. However, in areas with abundant land and where farmers can still wait for fallow periods of at least two years, alley cropping is recommended since, in addition to soil fertility improvement, substantial revenue is obtained. However, considerations of yield variability, labour scarcity, as well as risk-aversion behaviour among farmers may alter their technology choice.

AB  - The capacity of vegetation fallow to replenish carbon and nutrients in degraded soil is related largely to the nature of the fallow vegetation, particularly the chemical composition. Therefore, a study was conducted at Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria (humid tropics), to look into these relationships using fallow species with varying chemical compositions. The treatments include three woody species, Senna siamea, Acacia leptocarpa and Leucaena leucocephala, planted in 1989, and the natural shrub Chromolaena odorata. A continuous cropping of maize/cassava was maintained as a control (no fallow). Composite surface soil (0-15 cm) at three distances from a tree hedgerow (0.5, 2.0, and 3.5 m) was sampled in 1996 for the determination of soil C and nutrient stocks. Maize and cassava were planted as a test crop of soil productivity after fallowing. Litterbags were placed to determine the N immobilization during the decomposition of fallow leaves. Soil organic C (SOC) within 0-15 cm ranged from 19,100 (continuous cropping) to 26,400 kg ha-1 (Leucaena fallow), whereas total N ranged from 1820 (continuous cropping) to 3110 kg ha-1 (Leucaena fallow). High polyphenols in fallow leaves favored SOC and N accumulation. The amount of potentially mineralizable N was increased from 41 kg ha-1 in continuous cropping to 159 under Leucaena fallow and 176 under Acacia fallow. The percentage increase in mineralizable N stock under fallow was, on average, 5.5 times greater than that in total N, implying that fallow causes change in soil organic matter quality. The available P (Olsen) was 8.6 kg ha-1 in the continuous cropping and ranged from 14.1 kg ha-1 (natural fallow) to 29.2 kg ha-1 (Leucaena fallow). Greater maize and cassava yields were obtained in the fallow plots than in the control during the subsequent cropping. The maize grain yield after fallow could be predicted by the potentially mineralizable N in surface soil (0-15 cm). Leucaena and Acacia are promising species for planted fallows for soil regeneration in the humid tropics. The binding of protein by polyphenols during leaf decomposition, as confirmed by higher N immobilization with the increase in leaf polyphenols, could be the main mechanism in the contribution of polyphenols to SOC and N replenishment in the degraded soil. The study suggests the possibility of stabilizing C and N in tropical ecosystems by manipulating polyphenols in vegetation.

AB  - This study is a part of a research programme on selection and improvement of fast growing tree species suitable for wood fuel production on sodic wastelands (pH 8.6-10.5). Field trials of nine legumes (Acacia auriculiformis, A. nilotica, Albizia lebbeck, A. procera, Dalbergia sissoo, Leucaena leucocephala, Pongamia pinnata, Prosopis juliflora, Pithecellobium dulce) and three other tree species (Azadirachta indica, Eucalyptus tereticornis and Terminalia arjuna) were selected for this study. Prosopis juliflora was the most promising species in terms of its biomass productivity (68.7 tha-1) and fuel value index (148.8) after 8-yr of growth. Acacia nilotica ranked second. Intra-specific variations were screened at provenance and individual tree level in order to improve fuelwood production potential of P. juliflora through selection and breeding. Successful populations (gene pools) and individuals (genotypes) were cloned and conserved in clonal gardens to produce quality germplasm for plantations on sodic wastelands. Genetic testing, selection and multiplication of selected material are under progress. This will optimise gains in future afforestation programmes on sodic soils. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The mineralization of sulfur (S) was investigated in a Vertisol and an Inceptisol amended with organic manures, green manures, and crop residues. Field-moist soils amended with 10 g kg-1 of organic materials were mixed with glass beads, placed in pyrex leaching tubes, leached with 0.01 M CaCl2 to remove the mineral S and incubated at 30°C. The leachates were collected every fortnight for 16 weeks and analyzed for SO 4-S. The amount of S mineralized in control and in manure-amended soils was highest in the first week and decreased steadily thereafter. The total S mineralized in amended soils varied considerably depending on the type of organic materials incorporated and soil used. The cumulative amounts of S mineralized in amended soils ranged from 6.98 mg S (kg soil)-1 in Inceptisol amended with wheat straw to 34.38 mg S (kg soil)-1 in Vertisol amended with farmyard manure (FYM). Expressed as a percentage of the S added to soils, the S mineralized was higher in FYM treated soils (63.5 to 67.3%) as compared to poultry manure amended soils (60.5 to 62.3%). Similarly the percentage of S mineralization from subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) loppings was higher (53.6 to 55.5%) than that from gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) loppings (50.3 to 51.1%). Regression analysis clearly indicated the dependence of S mineralization on the C : S ratio of the organic materials added to soil. The addition of organic amendments resulted in net immobilization of S when the C : S ratio was above 290:1 in Vertisol and 349:1 in Inceptisol. The mineralizable S pool (So) and first-order rate constant (k) varied considerably among the different types of organic materials added and soil. The So values of FYM treated soils were higher than in subabul, gliricidia, and poultry manure treated soils.

AB  - Sinorhizobium morelense sp. nov. is described to designate a group of bacteria isolated from root nodules of Leucaena leucocephata. S. morelense shows 98% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to some Sinorhizobium species and to Ensifer adhaerens. This novel species is distinguished from other Sinorhizobium species and from E. adhaerens by DNA-DNA hybridization, 16S rRNA gene restriction fragments and sequence and some distinctive phenotypic features. Strains of this species are highly resistant to some antibiotics, such as carbenicillin (1 mg ml-1), kanamycin (500 μg ml-1) and erythromycin (300 μg ml-1). They do not form nodules, but a nodulating strain, Lc57, is closely related to the novel species. Strain Lc04T (= LMG 21331T = CFN E1007T) is designated as the type strain of this novel species.

AB  - The germination response of 13 promising and commonly used tropical and subtropical legumes in northern Australia was tested in the laboratory at 10 constant temperatures ranging from 8 to 44°C. Total percent germination for most species was high at temperatures from 16 to 36°C, with Macroptilium atropurpureum, Lablab purpureus and Glycine latifolia germinating well at 12°C. Macroptilium atropurpureum and G. latifolia had less seed death than other species at 8°C. There was no germination at 8 or 44°C for any species. Optimum temperature for rate of germination ranged from 24°C for G. latifolia up to 36°C for Macroptilium bracteatum. Leucaena leucocephala showed a 12-degree range (24-36°C) of optimum temperatures for rate of germination, but most species had a range of 4-8°C. The ability to germinate at a broad range of temperatures indicates that the species are well adapted to northern Australia. Consideration of these responses could be useful in selection of future species or cultivars. Existing linear models with base, optimum and ceiling temperatures, and coefficients of germination rate above and below optimum temperature were tested to predict germination from thermal time. Predicted germination in real time explained 73-90% of the variation in observed germination, with the closeness of fit poor at temperatures distant from optimum. Models using a series of step-wise linear equations describing each 5% interval of germination explained over 99% of the variation in cumulative germination with time, but required a large number of parameters.

AB  - Condensed tannin (CT) in 26 Leucaena accessions (14 species and 3 hybrids) grown near Townsville, north Queensland was measured using 14C-labelled polyethylene glycol. Results showed a wide range in the amount of PEG bound (PEG-b) (0-167 mg/g DM) both between and within species, confirming other results indicating that selection and breeding for low CT levels is possible. Lowest PEG-b values (<25 mg/g) were measured in L. collinsii, L. lempirana, L. salvadorensis, L. magnifica, L. trichodes and L. trichandra OFI 4/91. Highest values (>120 mg/g) were measured in L. pulverulenta, L. involucrata, L. diversifolia K156 and OFI 82/92, and L. trichandra CPI 46568. L. pallida, L. diversifolia CPI 33820, L. trichandra OFI 53/88, L. macrophylla istmensis, the KX2 F1 hybrid between L. pallida and L. leucocephala and L. leucocephala had intermediate values. The cultivars Cunningham and Tarramba and the L. pallida x L. leucocephala F1 hybrid had similar values (81-87 mg/kg). The results were compared with reported values from the same species grown in south-cast Queensland and in Honduras where the CT was measured by different techniques (Dalzell et al. 1998; Stewart and Dunsdon 1998). For the Honduran data, with 12 common accessions, there was an excellent linear relationship between PEG-b and total tannin estimated by radial diffusion protein-precipitation assay (r2 = 0.881), but a poorer relationship with CT estimated by a butanol/HCl assay (r2 = 0.649). For the south-east Queensland data, the linear relationship between CT estimated by a butanol/HCl method and PEG-b was significant (r2 = 0.60), but there were notable departures from the relationship. Reasons for these are discussed.

AB  - Two experiments involving different browse species were carried out during the early dry season in an area of subhumid Nigeria with adult Yankasa sheep. Experiment 1 involved preference studies of nine browse species offered simultaneously in different post-harvest treatments (fresh, wilted or dried state). Experiment 2 determined the short-term intake rate of top four browse species from Experiment 1 offered in two forms (unchopped versus chopped) as either fresh or sun-dried material. In Experiment 1, fresh material was most preferred, followed by wilted and sun-dried material. The overall order of preference of the first four browse species accepted by sheep were: Cajanus cajan, Gmelina arborea, Leucaena leucocephala and Adenodolichos paniculatus. Based on mean dietary preference across the three post-harvest treatments, Khaya senegalensis and Gliricidia sepuim were completely rejected by sheep. Experiment 2 mean dry matter (DM) intake rate was highest (34 g DM/kg LW0.75 h-1) for L. leucocephala and least (6 g DM/kg LW0.75 h-1) for A. paniculatus. Fresh material was consumed more readily than dried (24 versus 10 g DM/kg LW0.75 h-1). Chopping of browse species before offering enhanced intake by around 60%. As the study period progressed, the consumption of fresh and chopped materials remained moderately consistent, while those of dried and unchopped materials in turn increased gradually. Results from Experiment 2 were in agreement with observations from Experiment 1, particularly in terms of order of preference of fresh materials, which matched animals' relative short-term intake. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The effects of legume-based soil management on soil dispersion were studied on an Alfisol between 1994 and 1995 in an experiment which was established in 1989 in southwestern Nigeria. The fallow systems, which constituted the main plots in the split-plot experiment, included natural fallow, Pueraria phaseoloides (Roxb.) Benth, and Leucaena leucocephala Lam de Wit. The subplots were 25, 33, 50 and 100 per cent cropping intensities. Apart from indices of soil dispersion such as water-dispersible clay and dispersion ratio, the fractal theory was applied to describe the fragmentation of soil aggregates less than 4 mm under the systems and cropping intensities. Although water dispersible clay was less than 60 g kg-1 in the 0-15 cm soil depth because it was inherently low in clay content, the soil dispersion ratio was generally above 50 per cent. Also, the fractal dimensions, which ranged between 2.75 and 2.89, were similar among the fallow systems with cropping intensities for the surface soil. However, the interaction of slope position with season caused significant differences in fractal parameters, suggesting that the processes of soil degradation were different for the upper and lower slopes even with similar microaggregate distribution. The soil was inherently vulnerable to soil dispersion, although, the fallow management systems with less than 100 per cent cropping intensity would maintain soil structure at similar level as the forest.

AB  - Traditional weed control practices in Mexico use legumes as cover crops or manures. Legumes used in these practices play a dual role in agroecosystems by protecting the soil from erosion and by enriching it with organic matter and N through Rhizobium symbiosis. Farmers in the tropical regions of Mexico use Mucuna spp., Canavalia spp. and other legumes to control weeds in their fields. We conducted in vitro bioassays and greenhouse experiments to evaluate the toxic effect of four legumes velvetbean [Mucuna deeringiana (Bort) Merr.], jackbean [Canavalia ensiformis (L.) DC.], jumbiebean [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit], and wild tamarind [Lysiloma latisiliquum (L.) Benth.] on weed growth, and on the survival of insects and nematodes. The aqueous leachates (1%) of the four legumes were tested on three test plants by seed germination and radicle growth bioassays in petri dishes. The aqueous leachates of all four legumes exhibited strong phytotoxic effect on the radicle growth of the test plants. The effects of velvetbean and jackbean leachates were also evaluated on the survival of phytopathogenic nematodes. Both leachates had nematotoxic effects. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of the four legumes dried leaves incorporated as mulches to potting soil, on the number and biomass of weeds, and on the biomass of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) plants. The decomposition of velvetbean and jackbean leaves in potting soil significantly reduced (>50%) the development of phytopathogenic nematodes in the roots of tomato. A 5-yr field experiment conducted at the University of Yucatan (UADY) evaluated the effect of velvetbean and jackbean used as living cover crops, and jumbiebean and wild tamarind used as dead mulches incorporated on soil surface, on weed growth, and corn (Zea mays L.) yield. The experimental field was treated with the traditional slash and burn system in February 1994. In July 1994 the experiment was performed using the local agricultural practices in a complete randomized block design with three repetitions. The treatments were: corn+velvetbean, corn+jackbean, corn+jumbiebean, corn+wild tamarind, corn+Paraquat (1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium ion) herbicide, corn weeded by hand, and plots without corn weeded by hand. The number, biomass, diversity, and relative importance of weeds, as well as corn yield, were evaluated. In addition, taxonomic composition of weeds was determined. All legumes reduced weed growth with velvetbean (as living cover crop) producing the largest weed biomass reduction (68%). These legumes also improved the yield of corn during the first 2 yr of the experiment. For better management of natural resources, the use of legumes as biological tools in agriculture to control weeds and improve soil conditions should be encouraged through coordinated efforts between farmers, academic, and governmental institutions.

AB  - Approximately 80 head of yearling cattle grazing on 680 acres exhibited signs of Leucaena leucocephala toxicosis, which was confirmed in 3 animals by detection of 3-hydroxy-4 (IH)-pyridone, the metabolite of the poisonous principle mimosine, in their urine. The animals had grazed leucaena almost exclusively due to lack of alternative forage resulting from drought conditions. Toxicosis from this otherwise high quality forage would likely not have occurred had animals consumed lower amounts of leucaena and could probably have been prevented, as it has been elsewhere, had the animals been colonized with Synergistes jonesii, a beneficial ruminal bacterium capable of degrading the toxic metabolites.

AB  - A study was conducted to estimate the nutritive value of some selected acacia forages using palatability index, in sacco degradability and in vitro gas production characteristics. Ten wethers (mean wt. 18±3.5 kg) were offered Acacia tortilis, Acacia nilotica, Acacia mellifera, Acacia brevispica, Acacia senegal and Leucaena leucocephala (control) using a cafeteria system to determine the species preference by the animals. The acacia species were rich in nitrogen and showed variable palatability pattern. Significant (p<0.05) differences in relative palatability index (RPI) were detected among the species with the following ranking: brevispica > leucaena > mellifera > tortilis > Senegal > nilotica. Acacia nilotica appeared to be of low relative palatability with RPI of 24% and this was attributed to relatively high phenolic concentrations. The DM potential degradability (B) and rate of degradation (c) of the species were significantly (p<0.05) different, ranging from 40.1 to 59.1% and 0.0285 to 0.0794/h respectively. Acacia species had moderate levels of rumen undegradable protein, much higher than that in leucaena. In vitro gas production results indicated the effect of polyphenolic compounds on the fermentation rate, with lower gas production recorded from A. nilotica and tortilis. Based on RPI, A. brevispica and mellifera were superior to the rest and comparable to L. leucocephala. Long-term feeding trials are required with the superior species when used as protein supplements to poor quality diets. (Asian-Aust. J. Anim. Sci. 2001 Vol 14, No. 11 : 1580-1584).

AB  - This study examined the reproductive performance of dihydroxy pyridone (DHP)-inoculated South African indigenous (SAIG) female goats maintained on two dietary treatments: (i) Leucaena leucocephala/grass mixture and (ii) natural pasture prior to conception, and during gestation. Leucaena leucocephala/grass mixture was nutritionally superior (crude protein and mineral elements) than the natural pasture. The average daily gain, products of pregnancy and foetal development in gravid goats raised on leucaena/grass mixture were significantly (P ≤ 0.03, P ≤ 0.009 and P ≤ 0.005, respectively) higher than those raised on natural pasture. Conception rate of goats fed natural pasture was higher than the band fed Leucaena leucocephala/ grass mixture. Leucaena/grass mixture fed goats had kids that were heavier at birth than their counterparts on natural pasture. Pre-weaning kid mortality over the period of study was significantly (P ≤ 0.01) higher in the Leucaena leucocephala/grass mixture treatment, Colostrum from kidded goats fed leucaena was viscous and difficult to sample. The absence of mimosine toxicity symptoms suggests a possibility of safe use of leucaena as a feed resource to DHP-inoculated SAIG. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The effects of feeding Leucaena leucocephala on semen quality and fertility were examined using four dihydroxy pyridone (DHP)-adapted (21·0, 26·5, 27·0 and 31·0 kg) and four DHP-unadapted (28·0, 31·0, 40·0 and 44·0 kg) South African indigenous Nguni bucks (mature male goats). The DHP-adapted bucks were assigned to air-dried Leucaena leucocephala forage (LL; Leucaena group) while the unadapted ones were maintained on a cereal-based concentrate diet (C; concentrate group) containing 122 g crude protein (CP)/kg over an 84-day period. Buck semen samples were collected on days 0 and 77 of the study. On the last day of the study (day 84), bucks in the Leucaena group were divided into two equal subgroups; a subgroup was assigned to Leucaena leucocephala-grass pasture (LGP) with ten does (mature female goats) while the second subgroup was assigned to natural pasture (NP) with nine does. Similarly, the two concentrate subgroups were separately assigned to mate nine and ten does on LGP and NP plots, respectively. The proportions of normal semen on both groups were not significantly different. However, semen quality on LL treatment increased significantly (P = 0·004) between days 0 and 77 and probably explains the significant (P < 0·01) difference between the fertility rates of bucks on both treatments. There was no evidence that feeding LL was detrimental to semen quality and fertility of bucks and to conception among females mated by the bucks fed the forage; perhaps due to the fact that the bucks had adapted to DHP as a result of the DHP-degrading rumen bacteria (Synergistes jonesii) that were transferred to them by the does. Synergistes jonesii is known to be capable of detoxifying mimosine and its toxic metabolites to innocuous compounds.

AB  - Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 that nodulates Leucaena leucocephala degrades mimosine, a toxin produced by this tree legume. A cosmid clone, pUHR263, containing ∼25 kb cloned DNA was isolated by plating Escherichia coli cells containing the cosmid clone library of TAL1145 on a minimal medium in which 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (HP), a degradation product of mimosine, was used as the source of nitrogen. Cosmid pUHR263 was mutagenized by random insertions of Tn3Hogus, a transposon that makes transcriptional gus fusions when it is inserted in a gene in the correct orientation. Various pUHR263::Tn3Hogus derivatives that showed mimosine-inducible or mimosine-repressible GUS activities when transferred to the Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 were selected. Mutants of TAL1145 were constructed by transferring these Tn3Hogus insertions into the TAL1145 chromosome through double-homologous recombination. These mutants were classified into five classes on the basis of defects in mimosine degradation. The growth of these mutants was inhibited to different extents by mimosine applied to the growth medium. Mimosine forms a red-colored Fe-mimosine complex when FeCl3 is added to the medium. The inhibitory effect of Fe-mimosine on growth of the mutants was much less than that of mimosine.

TI  - Autecological characteristics and allelopathic potential of the invasive species Stachytarpheta jamaicensis
PY  - 2001

AB  - Stachytarpheta jamaicensis, an introduced aggressive species, has invaded much of the southern part of Taiwan. To elucidate its invasive mechanisms, the autecological characteristics and allelopathic potential of this species were investigated. Each plant may have 35 spikes which flower for most of the year under favorable conditions. Therefore, a single plant may produce over 10,000 seeds in 1 growing season. In addition, it has the ability to reproduce by vegetative means and can withstand flooding. This plant is a shade-intolerant species. Biomass production was significantly higher under high light conditions. Under low light, the number of spikes was significantly reduced, and the time to spike formation was postponed. Although its seeds could germinate under dark conditions, the germination rates, when illuminated, increased to more than 70%. S. jamaicensis had remarkably high photosynthetic rates under both strong and low light conditions. Its photosynthetic rates were not light saturated, and its photosynthetic capacity was higher than 26 μ mol m-2S-1, indicating that it has a high primary production capacity. Aqueous leaf extracts of S. jamaicensis inhibited seed germination and radicle growth of many local herbaceous plants, implying it has allelopathic potential. Allelopathic activities were also observed in pot experiments using decaying leaves. The following ecological characteristics of S. jamaicensis may be suggested as reasons for its success as an aggressively invasive species: (1) prolific seed production and easy dispersal of seeds by wind; (2) ability of vegetative regeneration by stems; (3) production of allelopathic and repellent substances; and (4) a high primary production rate. Allelopathic relationships among Acacia confusa, Vitex negundo, Leucaena leucocephala, and S. jamaicensis, which inhabit the same drough-prone site of the Hengchun Peninsula, are also discussed in this paper.

AB  - The effect of supplementation of iodine on male reproduction of goats, when their diet contained subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf-meal, was assessed using 6 adult bucks (2.5-3 years; 24.4±0.94 kg). The bucks were randomly divided rote 2 groups of 3 animals each, viz., control (I0) and iodine supplemented (I100). The animals were fed on a concentrate supplement along with leucaena leaf-meal (LLM), the latter to meet 50% of their CP requirements. Wheat straw was given ad lib. In addition, animals under group I100 received 100 μg of supplemental iodine/head / day. Semen was collected and analysed at monthly intervals during the 3 months of experimental feeding. Plasma samples were analysed for testosterone at the begining and end of the experiment. The results revealed that animals under I100 group maintained their libido throughout the experimental period in contrast to a progressive decline observed in the I0 group. The concentration of spermatozoa (3.25±0.39 vs 2.74±0.24 billion ml-1) and per cent live spermatozoa (76.67±1.82 vs 66.17±2.00) were significantly (P<0.01) higher in iodine supplemented (I100) than the non-supplemented bucks (I0). Other semen characteristics, viz. semen volume, pH, number of spermatozoa per ejaculate and mass activity although similar (P>0.05), tended to be higher m I100 group. The initial fructose content, similarly, tended to be higher in I100 than I0 animals. Mean plasma testosterone level was significantly (P<0.05) higher in I100 than I0 (1.78±0.21 vs. 1.14±0.46 ng ml-1). The study indicated thin supplementation of iodine to leucaena based diet can improve the male reproductive performance of goats.

AB  - Leucæna gum derived from seeds of Leucæna leucocephala was evaluated as a binding agent in lactose-based tablets containing sodium salicylate. The binding properties of gum were compared with acacia and methyl cellulose at equivalent concentrations. The following granular properties were evaluated: densities, Hausner ratio, Carr's index, angle of repose, flow rate and percentage of fines. The tablet properties investigated included: uniformity of weight, hardness, friability, binding capacity, disintegration time and in vitro dissolution(k, t50%, A30). Like other binding agents, an increase in gum concentration decreases the percentage fines and friability, and increases the hardness and disintegration time. Furthermore, the greater the binding concentration, the lower the k, A30 and the higher the t50%. The results indicate that Leucæna seed gum is a potential pharmaceutical binding agent.

AB  - Untreated seeds of Leucaena leucocephala exhibited 26% germination capacity and 90% viability. Germination capacity was stimulated to an average of 74% by chipping and suitable durations of boiling (100 °C) or hot (90, 80, 70 °C) water. Untreated and pretreated seeds were then stored at 8% moisture content (fresh weight basis) and 4 °C for 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 weeks. Neither group (untreated or pretreated) showed any loss of viability or decrease in germination capacity over these storage periods and there was no change in germination speed (measured as "mean germination time", mgt) amongst untreated or chipped seeds. However, for all boiling/hot water pretreatments, not only were the beneficial effects of dormancy breakage retained throughout storage, but germination speed improved with increasing storage interval. The rate of improvement to mgt was described by a quadratic function. Boiling/hot water pretreated seeds of L. leucocephala not only resisted deterioration over 64 weeks storage, but their subsequent performance appeared to improve.

AB  - Subabul is extensively used as a forage crop for the livestock because of its high protein value and economy. But it contains a glucoside, mimosine, which may some times cause toxicity in the livestock. A case of similar toxicity in two goat kids was diagnosed. Leucaena leaves were removed from the diet and treatment with antihistaminics and sodium 1-thyroxine yielded good results and the kids regained normal condition in two weeks.

AB  - Seeds of 50 different seed lots from 38 species (12 tropical legumes, 2 temperate legumes, 10 introduced grasses, 11 native/naturalised grasses and 3 weedy forbs) were placed on the soil surface under either full sunlight or artificial shade transmitting 10% sunlight at Townsville, north Queensland in September 1983. Seedling emergence was measured until January 1988 and data are presented on a yearly basis where a year (Oct 1-Sept 30) includes the wet season and following dry season. In all seed lots, except for Sida acuta under shade, over 50% of all seedling emergence occurred in the first year and, for most seed lots, over 80% of emergence. Most of this emergence occurred in the first 3 months (Oct 1-Dec 31, 1983). Only 10 of 50 seed lots had more emergence in the last 9 months than in the first 3 months of the first year and these included 5 legumes, 4 native/naturalised grasses and 1 forb. Overall, more legume seedlings emerged in the shade than in full sunlight whereas more seedlings of native/naturalised grasses emerged in full sunlight. No seedling emergence occurred in the fourth and fifth years in full sunlight whereas there were still low levels of seedling emergence under shade, especially of legumes and Sida acuta. No grass seedlings emerged under shade in the fifth and final year. The advantages and disadvantages of a persistent seedbank for herbaceous pasture legumes and for the shrub legume Leucaena leucocephala are discussed.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala Lam. de Wit. is a suitable plant for afforestation in degraded lands of Uttar Pradesh, India. But so for, no attention has been paid to study their nutritional requirement and growth. For the first time disorders of calcium deficiency have been observed in this plant at seedling stage by growing them in low (0.08 gl-1) calcium. As compared to the plants at adequate (8.0 gl-1) calcium the growth of low calcium plants were reduced. Calcium deficiency in Leucaena spp. not only depressed the girth of the stem and branches but markedly reduced the calcium concentration in all parts of the plant. The decrease in calcium was most marked in roots than other parts of the deficient plants. Dye back syndrome was more prominent at later stages of growth.

AB  - Sixty crossbred Anglo-Nubian goats (growing females), 18-24 mo of age, with a mean pre-experimental live weight of 20.9±0.44 kg were used to investigate voluntary dry matter intake (DMI) and digestibility of supplements of Leucaena leucocephala (LL) leaves to a basal diet of guinea grass. The experiment was a 3 forms of presentation: fresh, wilted and dryx4 levels of supplementation: 10, 20, 30 and 40% of total forage allowance with LL leaves. The goats were assigned based on weight and age to one of the twelve diets in a randomized manner and each level had five animals (replicates) per diet for 56 days. The form of presentation of LL leaves had effects on dry matter (DM) and nutrient composition. DM and NDF were higher in the dry LL leaves (p<0.05). In the diets, CP increased as the level of supplementation with LL leaves increased (p<0.05). Mean CP was similar in the fresh (14.8±3.5%), wilted (14.3±3.3%) and dry forms (13.9±3.1%). Neutral detergent fibre (NDF) decreased linearly (p<0.05) with increase in levels of supplementation. Organic matter (OM) followed the trend of CP concentration (p<0.05). Drying was observed to reduce the availability of CP at the different levels of supplementation and subsequently this affected the NDF of the diets. DM intake of the goats on the fresh and wilted LL leaves was significantly higher (p<0.05) than in those on the dry LL leaves. DM intake of the basal diet was observed to decrease as the level of supplementation (p<0.05) increased regardless of the form of presentation of LL. Growth rate was best (p<0.05) on the fresh form followed by wilted and the least in the dry form. Growth rate decreased linearly (p<0.05) with increase in the level of supplementation in the dry form. The form of presentation and level of supplementation influenced DM, CP and OM digestibility (p<0.05). Except for NDF, the digestibility of DM, CP and OM were better (p<0.05) in the goats on fresh LL leaves compared to the wilted and dry leaves. Based on the data on DMI, growth rate and apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients, the results suggest that LL leaves is best utilized when fed fresh or wilted to goats. In the dry form of presentation, the best level of supplementation without a reduction in voluntary DMI and growth rate is the 20%. In the fresh and wilted form, LL leaves could be fed up to the 40% level with improved DMI, growth rate and nutrient utilization.

AB  - Thirty-six indigenous goats were used to determine the potential of sun-dried leaves of the shrub legumes Acacia angustissima, Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala as supplements to native pasture hay (NPH). The dried leaves were included at the rates of 80, 160 and 320 g/head/day. Cottonseed meal fed at the same levels, and NPH fed alone were included as controls. Among the browses, C. calothyrsus had the lowest N content of 19.0 g/kg dry matter (DM) and A. angustissima the highest of 35.0 g/kg DM. The leaves from the legumes had significantly less N and higher cell wall, neutral detergent insoluble N (NDIN) and acid detergent insoluble N (ADIN) contents than cottonseed meal. The values of NDIN as a fraction of total N were 19, 456, 526 and 816 g/kg for cottonseed meal, L. leucocephala, A. angustissima and C. calothyrsus, respectively. Proanthocyanidin contents were 33, 196 and 134 g/kg DM for A. angustissima, C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala, respectively. Type of supplement did not affect (P > 0.05) NPH, total and digestible DM intakes although NPH intake was depressed (P < 0.05) at the highest level of supplementation compared to the first two levels. Animals fed legumes excreted significantly more (P < 0.001) faecal N (g/kg N intake) than animals consuming cottonseed meal. The reverse was observed for urine N. Among the legumes, C. calothyrsus had significantly higher (P < 0.001) N in faeces (958 g/kg N intake) than A. angustissima (630) and L. leucocephala (615). Significant (P < 0.05) correlation coefficients were obtained between proanthocyanidins (PAs) intake and faecal N, NDIN and ADIN (0.535, 0.501 and 0.786, respectively). Regressing digestible N on N intake indicated that A. angustissima and C. calothyrsus tannins had significant effects on the digestion of dietary N. The animal responses were discussed in relation to PAs content. It was concluded that both the type and level of PAs were important determinants of the animal responses. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Twelve indigenous male goats, comprising of six intact and six castrated (2.5-3 years; 24.4±062 kg) were assigned evenly into two dietary treatments, viz. I0 and I100 and were used to study the effect of supplementation of iodine on the nutrient utilization when their diet contained Leucaena leaf meal. They were offered a conventional concentrate mixture along with Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal, the latter to meet 50% of their crude protein (CP) requirements, and supplemented with either no iodine (I0) or 0.1 mg of iodine (I100)/day/animal as potassium iodide for a period of 105 days. Wheat straw given ad libitum was the sole source of roughage. A metabolism trial of 8 days duration was conducted after 90 days of experimental feeding. It was observed that the overall dry matter (DM) intake during experimental period was higher (p<0.05) in I100 group as compared to I0 group (508.6 vs. 443.7g d-1). The intake of CP, digestible crude protein (DCP) and metabolisable energy (ME), although non-significant, tended to be higher in the iodine supplemented group, I100. Digestibility of dry matter, organic matter (OM), CP, ether extract and crude fiber (CF) did not differ (p>0.05) between the treatments. However, nitrogen retention was higher (p<0.01) in I100 than I0 with the values being 2.63 and 1.70 g d-1, respectively. No difference (p>0.05) was evident in the retention of calcium and phosphorus between the two groups. The castrated animal exhibited lower DM intake concurrent with higher digestibility of DM and crude fibre (p<0.05), and organic matter and total carbohydrates (P<0.01) when compared to intact ones. It was concluded that supplementation of iodine to leucaena based ration may help in improving the DM intake and nitrogen utilization by goats.

AB  - Locally available different feed and forages were evaluated for carbohydrate and protein fractions and digestion characteristics. CP content was similar in non-leguminous forages and higher values were observed in Leucaena leucocephala leaf (LLM), urd bhoosa and groundnut haulm. Starch content was lower in urd bhoosa (4.70%) and was higher in LLM (25.85%), barley grain (46.35%) and both the concentrate mixtures A (38.61%) and B (36.52%). Among different roughages, unavailable fibre fraction C was minimum in LLM (13.05%) and maximum in groundnut haulm 28.35%). NPN% of CP was higher in LLM (22.49%). Intermediately degradable fraction of protein (B2) were similar in C. ciliaris (42.92%), LLM (43.39), mixed grass (39.61%) and higher in urd bhoosa (53.66%). Fraction C was found similar in C ciliaris, jowar kadbi, mixed grass and LLM and lower in urd bhoosa and GN haulm. In situ dry matter and crude protein disappearance for legume straws and L. leucocephala leaves were higher than those of non-leguminous forages. The trend of disappearance of dry matter was faster than crude protein in non-leguminous forages, however, in legume straws the disappearance of crude protein was faster than dry matter. While in L. leucocephala leaves the trend of disappearance of dry matter and crude protein was almost similar during 72 hr of incubation in rumen. The faster rate of disappearance of crude protein from leguminous forages as compared to non-leguminous forages showed that legume proteins are readily available in the rumen and thus could be used as nitrogen supplement to improve the utilization of low grade roughages.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted from 1994 to 1996 on a degraded Ultisol at the University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria, to monitor changes in nutrient status as influenced by the incorporation of prunings of planted Leucaena leucocephala and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) for a period of 60 weeks. Although increases in soil pH were small decreases in exchangeable acidity were observed to be highly significant in the first few weeks after incorporation of the prunings. The soil pH decreased by 47% and 49% in the leucaena and pigeon pea treated plots, respectively, and became stabilized thereafter while the exchangeable acidity increased steadily in the control plots. The total nitrogen levels in leucaena pruning incorporated plots increased by 120 and 213% compared to 90 and 175% respectively in pigeon pea within the first 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. However, the soil nitrate levels were consistently higher in pigeon pea than in leucaena pruning incorporated plots. Increases in total phosphorus (P) levels were marginal in the first few weeks after incorporation. However by the 18th week, significantly higher values were observed in the pigeon pea pruning incorporated plots (18%) than in leucaena pruning incorporated plots. The organic P followed a similar trend. The calcium-P (Ca-P) and the aluminum-P (Al-P) did not change significantly as a result of pruning incorporation. The exchangeable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K) levels increased significantly with time in the pruning incorporated plots. The increases were more rapid in the leucaena pruning incorporated plots. It was concluded that pigeon pea compared favorably with leucaena in terms of long-term nutrient releasing ability of their incorporated prunings and consequently may be better alternative to leucaena and other woody species because of its immediate cash and food values and ease of establishment and control.

Marginal product analysis for the different levels of LLM as a substitute to cotton seed cake (CSC) was also calculated. The following treatment diets were used in the experiment: Diet 1, (control) composed of 1.8 kg DM CSH and 1.8 kg DM MB. Diet 2, 3 and 4 had an addition of 1.2, 2.0 and 2.6 kg DM of LLM respectively. Diet 5 was composed of 1.8 kg DM of CSC and 1.8 kg DM of MB. Treatments, number of lactations, farm and initial milk yields significantly (P < 0.01) influenced milk production. LLM supplementation to grazing cows significantly increased milk production, weight gain and milk composition (P < 0.05). Cows on treatment 1 achieved no significant (P > 0.05) increase in milk yield compared to cows on treatment 2, 3, 4 and 5 which attained net milk increase of 3.6, 4.1, 6.7 and 4.4 litres/cow/day respectively. There was no significant (P > 0.05) difference in net milk produced by cows on treatment 2, 3 and 5 compared to treatment 1. LLM supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) increased total solids (TS) in milk compared to that of cows under control, but there was no significant (P > 0.05) influence on milk crude protein (CP), butter fat (BF), solids not fat (SNF) and ash in all the diets. Body weight was significantly (P < 0.05) increased by LLM supplementation. Degradation coefficients of the treatment diets were high and varied significantly (P < 0.01) and had an influence on the metabolizable energy value of the treatment diets. Cows on diet 2 to 4 had a weight gain of 190.9, 101.8 and 80.9 g/cow/day respectively and cows on diet 5 attained the highest weight gain (234.5 g/cow/day). Diet 4 had the highest marginal productivity of 4.3 followed by diets 2, 3 and 1 with marginal productivities of 2.8, 0.6 and 0 respectively. It was therefore, concluded that the optimal supplementation level using LLM as a substitute for the more expensive CSC was diet 4.

AB  - The reduction in seed germination and seedling growth varies with plant species, salinity level and ionic composition of the salts present in soil solutions. Seed germination of Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis juliflora were affected in soil extract of all halophytic communities. Significant (p < 0.05) reduction in seed germination of Thespesia populnea was found in soil extract of Cressa-Suaeda-Atriplex and Suaeda-Heliotropium-Tamarix community. The root growth of P. juliflora was significantly reduced in soil extract of Haloxylon-Suaeda- Atriplex community. Significant inhibition in shoot growth of L. leucocephala and P. juliflora were found in soil extract of Haloxylon-Suaeda-Atriplex community. L. leucocepliala and T. populnea showed low tolerance in soil extract of Cressa-Suaeda-Atriplex community. P. juliflora demonstrated low tolerance in soil extract of Haloxylon-Suaeda-Atriplex community. The soil collected from different community showed variation for soil conductivity and cations. The highest sodium (11, 500 μg/g) was observed in Suaeda-Heliotropium-Tamarix community. Salsola-Fagoiiia-Zygopliylluiii community exhibited the lowest concentration of sodium and potassium, 500 and 75 μg/g, respectively. It was found that sodium was directly proportional to the conductivity of the soil extract. © 2002 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

AB  - Intercropping of legumes and non-legumes is considered to improve the quality and quantity of field forage crops. Under semi-arid desert conditions, intercropping of leucaena and sesbania with some annual grasses (barley, pearl millet, and Rhodes-, ryeand sudan-grasses) was evaluated in a series of field trials. Inocula of specific rhizobia for legumes and a composite of associative diazotrophs for non-legumes were applied in the presence or absence of N fertilizers. Rhizobia inoculation was indispensable, and supported better growth of legumes which extended to the neighboring non-legumes. Associative diazotrophs improved biomass and N yields of non-legumes, particularly in the presence of moderate N fertilization for winter barley and rye grass and of higher doses of 300 kg N·ha-1 for summer pearl millet and sudan grass. Intercropping improved productivity of non-legumes, in particular barley mixed with sesbania, and the calculated N-transfer from legumes to non-legumes ranged from 20 to 70 kg N·ha-1.

AB  - Pollen fertility and meiotic behaviour were analysed in some taxa of the Central American nitrogen-fixing multipurpose tree genus Leucaena. Pollen fertility exceeded 90% in most of the 26 accessions of 13 species [L. confertiflara, L. diversifolia, L. involucrata, L. leucocephala, L. pallida, L. cuspidata, L. lanceolata, L. pulverulenta, L. retusa, L. salvadorensis, L. shannonii, L. trichandra, (L. x spontanea)]. Chromosome associations at diakinesis and metaphase I were analysed in 14 accessions of L. diversifolia, L. pallida, L. pulverulenta, L. retusa and L. trichondra and in the L. hybrid? accession. The diploid species L. pulverulenta, L. retusa and L. trichandra presented regular chromosome pairing, mostly in bivalents, but 1 or 2 quadrivalents were observed in some cells. In the tetraploid L. diversifolia and L. pallida, the most common chromosome associations were also bivalents but quadrivalents were found in up to 67% of the cells of L. pallida. The L. hybrid? accession presented several irregularities, such as univalents and multivalents and chromosome stickiness, reflected in low pollen fertility. Further analysis of more species and accessions and a detailed study of meiotic behaviour are underway.

AB  - Two experiments were conducted to examine the degradation rates of 4 tropical legume forages in rumen and intestine of Kedah-Kelantan (KK) cattle. Three KK cattle, averaging 173 ± 17.15 kg each fitted with a permanent ruminal and a T-shaped duodenal cannulae were used. The cattle were fed a maintenance diet (1% DM of their body weight) composing of 60% oil palm frond (OFF) pellet and 40% of a legume mixture of Arachis pintoi (AP) and Leucaena throughout the study. The overall DM and CP degradabilities in the rumen for Gliricidia sepium (GS) and AP were significantly higher than those for Leucaena leucocephala-Bahru (LB) and Leucaena leucocephala-Rendang (LR). This implies that LB and LR would have higher dietary protein flows into the intestine for the more efficient enzymatic digestion. However, the results of the present study suggested only limited proportions of the ruminai undegraded protein in the Leucaenas were digested in the intestine.

AB  - Populations of soil-dwelling mites were monitored in monoculture plots of four agroforestry tree species, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Dactyladenia barteri and Treculia africana, and compared to those in grass and secondary forest plots in the dry season (December 1993 to January 1994) and in the wet season (April to June 1994) in southwest Nigeria. Mite populations were very low in all plots during the dry season (500-3000 m-2), compared to those during the wet season (10 000-30 000 m-2). The highest mite population was observed in Gliricidia plots (3 044 m-2) for the dry season and Leucaena plots (30 240 m-2) for the wet season. Mite genera that were dominant in all the experimental plots were Annectacarus, Haplozetes, Machadobelba, Scheloribates and members of the Galumnidae, Dermanyssidae and Parasitidae. The community structure of mites was similar in the soil for Treculia and Gliricidia plots and for Leucaena and Dactyladenia plots. Them were more taxonomic groups of mites under Leucaena than in the other agroforestry plots. Based on the density, diversity and complexity of the mite communities, Leucaena was considered to be better than other agroforestry species in encouraging the growth of mite populations.

AB  - Samples of foliage from multipurpose leguminous trees (MPT) which had been selected as potential feed supplements for ruminants were examined for their chemical composition and in situ degradation characteristics, and were compared with alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay and teff (Eragrostis abyssinica) straw. Organic matter (OM), acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), nitrogen, neutral detergent nitrogen, acid detergent lignin (ADL), soluble phenolics, NDF-bound proanthocyanidins and in vitro digestibility were determined in Acacia angustissima, Chamaecytisus palmensis (Tagasaste), Leucaena leucocephala, two cultivars of Sesbania sesban and Vernonia amygdalina (bitter leaf). The MPT all had a nutrient content, particularly in terms of N (up to 39.5 g available N per kg dry matter (DM)) similar to alfalfa hay, which would be suitable for supplementing teff straw, which had a high fibre, but low N (4.0 g available N per kg DM) content. In situ nylon bag digestion and in vitro gas production analyses were carried out to assess microbial degradation characteristics. The MPT were highly degradable in situ, however gas production in vitro decreased as the MPT:teff straw ratio increased in A. angustissima, indicating that antimicrobial components were present in this species. None of the chemical estimations were correlated with antimicrobial properties. It is concluded that some of the MPT tested may prove to be useful dietary supplements for ruminants receiving poor quality forages like teff straw, as has been found in other studies. However, chemical analysis alone will be of limited value in predicting the nutritive value of a new MPT which contains antimicrobial components or material toxic to the animal itself.

AB  - The ability of trees and shrubs to coppice vigorously after being cut or pruned is of great importance in the management of agroforestry systems. In a study conducted in the seasonally dry climate of Ibadan, Nigeria, frequent cutting progressively decreased concentrations of starch and total reserve carbohydrates in Gliricidia sepium (jacq.) Walp. and Leucaena leucocephala (lam.) De Wit. In frequently cut trees, starch was severely reduced in the stumps of both species. In contrast, soluble sugar concentrations in roots and stems of both species were consistently maintained at or above the levels in uncut control trees, suggesting that sugar levels were maintained through the hydrolysis of starch reserves. No starch replenishment occurred during the six weeks after cutting. In trees that were cut and then allowed to grow undisturbed during the wet season, replenishment of stem starch began within three months after cutting. Shoot regrowth after cutting decreased starch levels first in stems and, only after additional cuts, in roots. Dry-season cuts had little effect on reserve carbohydrates in G. sepium but quickly reduced stem starch in L. leucocephala. Frequent cutting decreased dry matter production, and this decrease was correlated with reduced levels of reserve carbohydrates.

Onion, potato and garlic were successfully inoculated with VAM fungi in nutrient deficient soil amended with composted leaves of Albizzia lebek (albizzia), Populus deltoides (poplar) and Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena). Colonization in onion reached approx. 85% of root length, followed by garlic and potato (65%). Inoculation response in terms of yield increase was maximum in onion (70%) whereas garlic and potato showed 30% and 48% increases respectively. Also, growth response to VAM fungus inoculation at the high level of organic amendment as well as production of infectious VAM population was demonstrated.

AB  - Thirty Angora (16±2 kg initial body weight) and 20 Spanish doelings (19±2 kg initial body weight), approximately 8 months of age, were used in an 10 week experiment to evaluate effects of dietary level of Leucaena leucocephala on body weight (BW) gain and fiber growth. The control diet (CS) included 9% dry matter (DM) of formaldehyde-treated casein; other diets consisted of 15, 30, 45 or 60% DM of leucaena leaf meal (0.75% mimosine; 15, 30, 45 and 60 l, respectively). Diets were formulated to be 2.13 Mcal metabolizable energy/kg DM, and ranged in crude protein from 10 to 14% of DM. DM intake was greater (P<0.05) for 45 l than for CS and 15 l (710, 648, 815, 899 and 811 g per day for CS, 15, 30, 45 and 60 l, respectively) and similar (P>0.05) between Angora and Spanish doelings. BW gain was similar (P>0.05) among diets (48, 28, 38, 34 and 26 g per day for CS, 15, 30, 45 and 60 l, respectively) and between breeds. Mohair growth rate was lower (P<0.05) for 60 and 30 l than for CS (1.34, 1.18, 0.94, 1.16 and 0.88 mg cm-2 per day, and mohair diameter was greatest (P<0.05) for CS and lowest (P<0.05) for 60 l (27.7, 25.9, 25.1, 25.0 and 23.8 μm for CS, 15, 30, 45 and 60 l, respectively). Cashmere growth rate and fiber diameter for Spanish goats were similar among diets, and primary and secondary follicle activities for both Angora and Spanish goats were not affected by dietary treatments (P>0.05). Diet affected (P<0.05) plasma concentrations of urea, threonine, arginine, valine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine and lysine, with concentrations increasing as dietary level of leucaena increased. In conclusion, diets of moderate to high levels (e.g., 45%) of leucaena with 0.75% mimosine can be fed to goats without adverse effects on BW gain or fiber growth. However, further study of the composition of leucaena-based diets appears necessary to achieve most efficient utilization. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) has a key role in maintaining soil fertility in weathered soils in the tropics. This study was conducted to determine the contribution of different SOM fractions to the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of a tropical soil as influenced by organic matter inputs of different biochemical composition. Soil samples were collected from a 16-yr old arboretum established on a Ferric Lixisol, under five multipurpose tree species: Leucaena leucocephala, Dactyladenia barteri, Afzelia africana, Pterocarpus santalinoides, and Treculia africana. Fractions were obtained by wet sieving and sedimentation after dispersion with Na2CO3. Fractions larger than 0.053 mm were separated into mineral and organic components by flotation on water. Relationships between CEC and pH were determined using the silver-thioureum-method. For all treatments the organic fractions had the highest CEC, expressed on a dry matter basis, and the CEC of the fractions smaller than 0.053 mm was inversely related to their particle size: clay (< 0.002 mm) > fine silt (0.002-0.02 mm) > coarse silt (0.02-0.053 mm). A positive correlation (significant at the 0.01 probability level) existed between the slope of the fitted CEC-pH relationships and the organic C concentrations of the whole soil and both silt fractions. The clay and fine silt fractions were responsible for 85 to 90% of the CEC of the soil. Organic inputs with a high C/N and lignin/N ratio produced fine and coarse silt sized SOM fractions with the highest charge density. Therefore, inputs of slowly decomposing organic residues seem to be promising for increasing the CEC of highly weathered soils.

AB  - A 22-week experiment was conducted in controlled environments to investigate the effects of light and inoculum application on the growth, nodulation and nitrogen fixation of 2 tropical legumes, viz Sifts tree [Albizia lebbeck (L. Benth] and Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.]. Two light regimes-high light and low light (stimulated shade) were used. Plants were either inoculated without the addition of inorganic nitrogen or they received inorganic nitrogen without inoculum application. Control plants neither received inoculum nor inorganic nitrogen. The results showed that in both species under high light, the inoculated plants outgrew the uninoculated ones. Although there appears to have been more investment of the biomass in the leaf area under simulated shade conditions for the inoculated plants, the lower net assimilation rate resulted in lower growth rate. The controlled plants had the least growth under both light regimes, though they grew better under low light indicating that these legumes may be able to withstand nitrogen stress under shade conditions. Also more nodules were produced and more nitrogen fixed under high light than under the low light. Although nitrogen fixation was reduced under low light, nitrogen uptake was higher for Albizia lebbeck for the inoculated treatments than the uninoculated treatments.

AB  - The effectiveness of tree-leaf biomass as a source of N to crops in agroforestry systems depends on the rate at which crops can obtain N from the biomass. A study was conducted to determine the fate of 15N labeled, soil-applied biomass of two hedgerow species, Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner (calliandra) and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (leucaena), in the subhumid highlands of Kenya. Labeled biomass obtained from 15N fertilized trees was applied to microplots in an alley cropping field and maize planted. N uptake and recovery by maize and hedgerow trees was periodically determined over a 20-week period during the short rain (1995) and the long rain (1996) growing seasons. In maize crop from treatments that received leucaena biomass, higher N uptake and recovery were recorded than in maize from the plots that received calliandra biomass. However, N uptake and recovery were higher in calliandra tree hedges than in leucaena hedges, indicating differences in N uptake by the two tree species. The largest fraction (55-69%) of N in the applied tree biomass was left in the soil N pool, 8-13% recovered by maize, 2-3% by tree hedges, and 20-30% could not be accounted for. Some of the unaccounted for N may have been left in the wood and root portions of the tree hedges and in the bulk soil below the 20-cm depth. The study shows that only a small fraction of the N contained in the N-rich biomass that is applied to the soil is taken up by the current season's crop, suggesting that a major benefit may be in the build-up of the soil N store.

AB  - The rooting behaviour of four agroforestry species in the northwestern hills of India, viz. Bauhinia purpurea, Grewia optiva, Eucalyptus tereticornis and Leucaena leucocephala, was investigated. Polybag-raised seedlings planted at 3 x 3 m on silty clay loam soil at Dehra Dun were excavated by the skeleton method periodically up to 90 months during the winter season. Along with the shoot growth patterns, rooting characteristics of these species were recorded in terms of changes in root length density, root weight, root system sorption zone and vertical and lateral expansions of roots with time. Above-ground biomass was closely related to root length and root biomass. The fast-growing species E. tereticornis and L. leucocephala had relatively more aggressive root systems than the slow-growing native spp. G. optiva and B. purpurea. At 90 months of age, more than one third of the root length of all the four species was positioned beyond 1 m depth. Bauhinia purpurea and G. optiva show much less root length density at 1 m depth compared to L. leucocephala and E. tereticornis. Therefore the former two indigenous species are likely to be less competitive with crops in agroforestry systems than the latter two fast-growing species. Bauhinia purpurea with a deep root system and high root:shoot ratio may be a suitable species for slope stabilisation while G. optiva with a shallow root system may be effective for erosion control particularly on terrace risers.

AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the replacement value of Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium as nitrogen sources in commercial type supplements for dairy goats. Six crossbred (Toggenburg X Saanen) goats at late stage of lactation were allocated to three dietary treatments in a double 3×3 Latin square design. The animals were offered rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay ad libitum and supplemented with either Leucaena-based concentrate (LBC), Gliricidia-based concentrate (GBC) or commercial based concentrate (CC). Voluntary food intake, milk yield and composition and changes in live weight were measured. The total dry matter (DM) intake was higher (p<0.05) in goats fed GBC than CC (1385 vs 1331 g/d). The DM intake for LBC (1343 g/d) was similar to CC (1331 g/d). The DM intake of hay was also higher (p<0.05) in goats fed GBC (834 g/d) than those receiving LBC or CC (789, 782 g/d, respectively). Animals supplemented with GBC recorded positive (11 g/d) weight gain while the other groups lost weight (13, 19 g/d) for LBC and CC respectively, although these differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). The composition of milk were: butterfat 58, 49 and 55 g/kg; crude protein 37.0, 35.4 and 36.1 g/kg; lactose 33, 29 and 30 g/kg; Ash 8.5, 8.5 and 7.9 g/kg and total solids 136.5, 121.9 and 129.0 g/kg, for goats fed LBC, GBC and CC respectively. There were no differences in the composition of milk due to these dietary treatments. At the end of performance trial, a digestibility trial was conducted using 6 female goats allocated to the three treatments (LBC, GBC and CC) in an incomplete randomized block design and each goat received a different supplement in each of two successive periods. There were no differences in nutrient digestibility except for DM, which was higher (p<0.05) in CC compared to the other treatments (615, 622, 720 g/kg for LBC, GBC and CC, respectively). Economic analysis showed that CC diet was more expensive (0.20 US$/kg) and had a lower margin over supplementation (0.11 US$) compared to LBC and GBC (0.13 vs 0.12 US$/kg and 01.5 vs 0.12 US$, respectively). It is concluded that the Leucaena and Gliricidia could contribute as nitrogen sources in compounded diet supplements without any detrimental effects on production in dairy goats.

AB  - A greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the potential use of two legume species, Acacia auriculiformis and Leucaena leucocephala for growth on ameliorated lagoon ash with or without nitrogen (N2)-fixing bacteria inoculation. Even though amendments of 30% (w/w) vermiculite or with sewage sludge compost were added to improve the chemical and physical limitations of lagoon ash, significant suppressions in biomass and plant nutrient content were found with ameliorated lagoon ash in comparison to an agricultural soil. The high proportion of clay-sized (<53 μm) ash particles limited root growth. In addition, heavy metal toxicity was a possible factor contributing to poor seedling growth. Higher plant productivity resulted from the sewage sludge compost-amended lagoon ash than with vermiculite due to a greater contribution of plant nutrients in the compost. Nodulation was inhibited in ameliorated lagoon ash but not in agricultural soil. High pH and electrical conductivity and elevated toxic metals may be important parameters that limit bacterial activity. Both species showed potential to establish on amended lagoon ash, with Acacia auriculiformis being the best adapted. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The animal production potential of 4 new Leucaena genotypes with superior pysllid tolerance and high yield x was investigated in a grazing trial in the Markham Valley of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Nursery raised seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala K636 cv. Tarramba, L. collinsii OFI 51/88 subspecies collinsii, L. pallida CQ 3439 and L. trichandra CPI 46568 were each planted into two 1.0 ha paddocks of existing signal grass in rows 5 m apart and 1 m between plants within rows. After 1 year, the Leucaena/signal grass pastures, and a control pasture of signal grass only, were rotationally grazed at 6 week intervals by 6 Brahman steers. Pasture DM yield before and after each rotation was estimated. X....X L. leucocephala K636 cv. Tarramba and L. collinsii OFI 51/88 gave best liveweight gains while L. pallida CQ 3439 proved to be less palatable and of lower quality. L. trichandra CPI 46568 did not perform well in this lowland tropical environment.

AB  - Enterolobium (Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Jacq.) Griseb) is a leguminous tree that has potential for use as a shade tree, in woodlots, for soil conservation and for fodder, and has wide ecological adaptation. A greenhouse study was conducted to determine the potential of Enterolobium as a fast-grower during its first three months of growth relative to Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam. de Wit) and Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium Walp.), the most commonly grown tree legumes in the lowland humid tropics of West Africa. The root and shoot growth of Enterolobium was generally similar (or better, before 6-8 weeks of growth) to that of Gliricidia, but was significantly more than that of Leucaena. Enterolobium nodulated freely without Rhizobium inoculation to the same extent as Gliricidia up to 10 weeks after planting; thereafter Gliricidia produced more nodules. Enterolobium produced more nodules than Leucaena throughout the period of sampling. There were, on average, 50 nodules/plant in Leucaena, 115 in Enterolobium and 223 in Gliricidia at 12 weeks after planting. Thus, compared with Leucaena and Gliricidia, Enterolobium is a fast-growing leguminous tree that nodulates early and freely with native rhizobia. The productivity of Enterolobium under regular cutting management and the value of the foliage as mulch/green manure and fodder need to be determined.

AB  - The binding constants for the complexed species formed in aqueous solution between galactomannan of Leucaena leucocephala and the metal ions Co2+, Mn2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ were determined by potentiometric titrations. The calculated values showed Ni2+ as the best Lewis acid towards the Lewis base -OH groups of the sugar monomers, with Zn2+ being the poorest. For all systems, a higher percentage of the complexed species was present near pH=7.0, although complexed species existed over a wide range of acidic and basic pH values. The isolated solid complexes were studied by TG-DSC thermal analysis and by EPR spectroscopy. The thermal profiles obtained showed higher thermal resistance to final degradation than the biopolymer alone for the complexed species ML having the smallest log K values. The EPR spectra confirmed the complexation of the metal ions via the Lewis base deprotonated hydroxyl groups (-O) and showed that the distances between metal ions in the complexed biopolymer structure depend on the nature of the metal ion. The ability of galactomannans to complex a variety of metal ions in their web like structure and the resistance to high temperatures and a wide range of pH values of these complexes open new perspectives in possible industrial uses whenever these properties are required, such as in bioremediation of waste waters and in the application of slow-release fertilizers.

AB  - An investigation was undertaken to test the hypothesis that amending peat to increase its P buffer capacity and optimizing the P concentration of the amended medium for mycorrhizal activity will enhance its usefulness for raising mycorrhizal seedlings of tree species. The approaches entailed mixing a small quantity of soil of high P adsorbing capacity with peat and constructing a P sorption isotherm for the medium in order to establish solution P concentration near-optimal to optimal for mycorrhization of seedlings. A P sorption isotherm based on incubating the medium with graded amounts of P at 50% of available water-holding capacity was developed. Target solution P concentrations established using the approach enabled us to identify the optimal solution P concentration for mycorrhizal development on roots of our indicator plant Leucaena leucocephala grown in the medium. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization, host growth, and P status of L. leucocephala pinnules measured at target solution P concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 1.0 mg L-1 revealed that AM fungal activity and symbiotic effectiveness was maximum at solution P concentration of 0.2 mg P L-1. Medium solution P concentrations in excess of 0.2 mg L-1 tended to depress AM fungal colonization, but colonization level did not decline below 43%.

AB  - A serine proteinase inhibitor isolated from Leucaena leucocephala seeds (LlTI) was purified to homogeneity by acetone fractionation, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration and reverse phase chromatography (HPLC). SDS-PAGE indicated a protein with M(r) 20 000 and two polypeptide chains (α-chain, M(r) 15 000, and β-chain, M(r) 5000), the sequence being determined by automatic Edman degradation and by mass spectroscopy. LlTI is a 174 amino acid residue protein which shows high homology to plant Kunitz inhibitors, especially those double chain proteins purified from the Mimosoideae subfamily. LlTI inhibits plasmin (K(i) 3.2x10-10 M), human plasma kallikrein (K(i) 6.3x10-9 M), trypsin (K(i) 2.5x10-8 M) and chymotrypsin (K(i) 1.4x10-8 M). Factor XIIa activity is inhibited but K(i) was not determined, and factor Xa, tissue kallikrein and thrombin are not inhibited by LlTI. The action of LlTI on enzymes that participate in the blood clotting extrinsic pathway is confirmed by the prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time, used as clotting time assay. The inhibition of the fibrinolytic activity of plasmin was confirmed on the hydrolysis of fibrin plates. LlTI inhibits kinin release from high molecular weight kininogen by human plasma kallikrein in vitro and, administered intravenously, causes a decrease in paw edema induced by carrageenin or heat in male Wistar rats. In addition, lower concentrations of bradykinin were found in limb perfusion fluids of LlTI-treated rats. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Laboratory incubation in the UK of an Oxisol from Burundi and an Ultisol from Cameroon with 3.1% by weight of prunings of young shoots of Calliandra calothyrsus, Cassia siamea, Flemingia congesta, Grevillea robusta, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena diversifolia and Leucaena leucocephala resulted in increased soil pH and decreased exchangeable aluminium content. The greatest increase in pH and corresponding decrease in exchangeable aluminium occurred during the first 14 days of incubation and the decrease continued at a slower rate until 42 days incubation. The acid neutralizing effect decreased after 42 days but was still important at the last sampling time at 98 days. Polyphenol to nitrogen ratio was not well correlated with observed change in soil pH whereas the total base cation (calcium, magnesium and potassium) content proved to be a good predictor of these changes in the Ultisol, but not in the Oxisol. The proposed mechanism giving rise to acid neutralization is complexation of protons and aluminium by organic anions. The total base cation content of the prunings ranged from 0.94 to 2.25 mol(c)/kg and the buffer capacity of the Oxisol was 48 mmol OH-/pH/kg.

AB  - A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of applying elemental sulphur inoculated with Thiobacillus or gypsum, on dry matter production and nitrogen fixation of Leucaena leucocephala and Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia grown in a soil with high sodium content and irrigated with saline water. An alluvial solodic medium texture soil, representative of the semi-arid region of Pernambuco, Brazil, was used. The treatments consisted of the addition of elemental sulphur at two levels (0.3 or 0.6 t/ha), and gypsum at two levels (0.6 or 1.2 t/ha). Plants were irrigated with saline water (containing NaHCO3, NaCl, MgCl2, CaCl2, KCl), at three levels of electrical conductivity (0.2, 6.1 and 8.2 dS/m at 25°C), in a factorial combination. There was a treatment with no sulphur or gypsum applied. The results showed that elemental sulphur inoculated with Thiobacillus decreased soil pH and increased Al toxicity which harmed the growth of L. leucocephala, and that M. caesalpiniaefolia was more susceptible than L. leucocephala to salinity promoted by the saline irrigation water.

AB  - Leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) psyllid resistance was evaluated in three species (7 accessions) and eight hybrids of the genus Leucaena. The results indicated that the species L. pallida (K177 and K376) was most resistant to this psyllid. The widely-planted species L. leucocephala (K8) was found to be susceptible to the insects. The hybrids, L. pallida x L. diversifolia and L. leucocephala x L. pallida performed better than the other hybrids in terms of psyllid resistance, followed by L. diversifolia x L. leucocephala. The cross L. leucocephala x L. diversifolia, although less resistant, was high-yielding. These hybrids were consequently selected to intensively advanced generations for further study. Four generations of the hybrids were assessed. The results showed that the resistance of F1 plants was intermediate between their parents. From F2 plants to F4 plants, individuals with low damage rating increased, whereas individuals with high scores decreased from generation to generation. The laboratory observation of psyllid resistance in F3 plants and F4 plants was similar. Thus, it is possible to breed for psyllid-resistant leucaena through hybrid selection.

AB  - The importance of the Northern Guam aquifer as a source of drinking water for the tropical Pacific island of Guam has stimulated public interest in the impact of forest clearing and conversion to agriculture on the region's environment. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of land clearing, tillage, and fertilization of tropical secondary forest on soil organic and organic C fractions in the shallow, calcareous soil that overlies most of Northern Guam. A field experiment was established on a secondary forest site in Northern Guam to simulate land clearing, cultivation and fertilization with two separate applications of N, P and K fertilizer or leucaena (Leucaena leucocephaIa (Lam.) de Wit) leaves. Initial aboveground biomass of secondary forest was relatively low in comparison to that of other moist tropical forest sites, possibly because of poor soil fertility, shallow soil depth, and frequent natural disturbance from tropical storms. Rates of litterfall were also affected by the high winds associated with storm activity. Clearing, cultivation and fertilization over a 325-day period significantly reduced microbial biomass C. Soil surface CO2 efflux was characterized by short-term flushes shortly after tillage and was affected by soil moisture content and possibly by the proportion of active organic C contained in the soil. A comparison of commercial fields with continuous cultivation histories of 1-26 years and forest sites in Northern Guam showed approximately a 44% decrease in soil organic C within 5 years after conversion of secondary forest to continuous cultivation. Further information is needed on the effectiveness of minimum tillage, application of organic amendments, or improved crop residue management to maintain soil organic C in Northern Guam.

AB  - Leaf litter decomposition in tree plantations of Eucalyptus hybrid. Grevellia robusta A. Cunn., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit., Pinus roxburghii Sarg., Populus deltoides Marsh. and Tectona grandis Linn. was studied in the Tarai region of Kumaun Himalaya (Central Himalaya) to examine: (i) the rate and seasonal pattern of decomposition, and (ii) the relationship between rate, litter quality and environmental factors. The upper layer of soil is rich in organic carbon (2.6-6.3%) and potassium (347-517 kg ha-1). The initial concentration (%) of N, P and K in leaf litter was highest in L. leucocephala (2.52), T. grandis (0.31) and P. deltoides (0.98) respectively and lower in P. roxburghii (0.63 N, 0.055 P and 0.375 K). Monthly rainfall and temperature could account for 37-85% and 39-57% of monthly weight loss of litter. The different combinations of temperature, rainfall, relative humidity and evaporation on weight loss produced an r2 of 0.48-0.89. The nutrient concentration of N, P and K on percent weight loss explained 30-60% of the variability whereas the combinations of N, P and K and climatic variables on percent weight loss produced an r2 of > 0.77.

AB  - Earthworm populations (predominantly Hyperiodrilus africanus and Eudrilus eugeniae) were sampled monthly for 1 yr during 1994 and 1995 in natural regrowth vegetation fallow (dominated by the natural fallow shrub Chromolaena odorata L.), planted fallow (the woody species Senna siamea Lam., Leucaena leucocephala Lam., and Acacia leptocarpa), and intercropped maize (Zea mays L.)-cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) established in 1989 in a degraded Alfisol (Oxic poleustalf) in southwestern Nigeria. Compared to leaves of Chromolaena (3.3% N), N concentrations were lower in those of Senna and Acacia, and higher in Leucaena. Acacia and Leucaena had higher polyphenol relative to the natural fallow (2%). The lignin was lower in Leucaena than the natural fallow leaves (14%). For 65% of the sampling dates, earthworm numbers under all follows were significantly higher than under continuous maize-cassava. The mean earthworm numbers (no. m-2) during the rainy season (April-October) decreased in the following order: Chromolaena (147), Senna (131), Leucaena (92), Acacia (80), and maize-cassava (14). Earthworm fresh weights in fallow plots were higher than in the maize-cassava plot, though this was significant for only 4 out of 11 sampling dates. Higher earthworm numbers and biomass in fallow plots were attributed to higher litterfall, lower soil temperature, and higher soil moisture. The mean earthworm numbers were directly correlated with the mean soil moistures (r2 = 0.80, P < 0.05) in fallow plots and N/polyphenol ratios of fallow litterfall (r2 = 0.95, P < 0.05). Increase in earthworm population by follows led to an increase in leaf-litter decomposition, soil organic matter, available P, and extractable cations and pH; and a decrease in soil bulk density and penetrometer resistance in the fallow plots.

AB  - Adapted tree+grass combinations make a valuable contribution to forage production in the Indian peninsula, but knowledge of the interactive effects between trees and grasses on their production is limited. We, therefore, conducted a field experiment involving combinations of four trees and grasses, besides monospecific grass controls, for seven years, to investigate grass productivity in association with leguminous and non-leguminous multipurpose trees (MPT) having disparate canopy architecture, and to assess the end-of-rotation soil fertility changes. Post rotation changes in herbage productivity were evaluated by growing teosinte (Zea mexicana) for three years. The four MPTs were Acacia auriculiformis, Ailanthus triphysa, Casuarina equisetifolia and Leucaena leucocephala. Grasses included Pennisetum purpureum (hybrid napier), Brachiaria ruziziensis (congo signal), Panicum maximum (guinea grass) and teosinte. Lower tree branches were pruned from fifth year. Understorey herbage production increased until three years in all tree+grass combinations, but declined subsequently, as tree crowns expanded. Overall, casuarina among MPTs, and hybrid napier and guinea grass among forage crops, were more productive than others. Pruning MPTs generally favoured greater herbage production. Understorey light levels for acacia, ailanthus, casuarina and leucaena were 17, 60, 55 and 55% of that in the open at five years. During the post-rotation phase, MPT plots were characterised by higher soil nutrient capital and consequently teosinte yields were higher than in the treeless control treatment. All previous tree-grass combinations showed an increasing trend till two years after MPT felling. Yield levels declined subsequently, despite at variable rates. Careful selection of the tree and grass components is, therefore, crucial for optimising herbage productivity in silvopastoral systems.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to study the performance of lambs supplemented with two levels of Leucaena leucocephala hay during the dry season in comparison to animals grazing on buffel grass or buffel grass grown with Cajanus cajan. During the rainy season, the performance of animals that were maintained in buffel grass pasture without supplementation was also determined. The following treatments were tested during the dry season: A - buffel grass pasture; B - buffel grass pasture consorted with Cajanus cajan; C - buffel grass pasture supplemented with Leucaena hay (250 g/anim•d); D - buffel grass pasture supplemented with Leucaena hay (500 g/anim•d). During the dry season, only lambs supplemented with the highest level of Leucaena hay (treatment D) showed daily weight gain higher than those animals on exclusively pasture diets (treatments A and B). During the rainy season, the animals that showed better daily gain rates in the dry season performed daily weight gain worse in relation to the others treatments. When both seasons were considered, the advantage with supplementation disappeared and there were no differences among treatments. The use of Leucaena hay for supplementation of lambs maintained in pasture, during the dry season, is efficient, since the animals are finished and slaughter at the end of the season.

AB  - A trial was conducted to evaluate the influence of antinutritional factors in some feedstuffs on broiler chick's performance and intestinal epithelium. A total of 480 one-day old broiler chicks were allotted to a completely randomized experimental design with four treatments (A= corn and soybean meal based control diet; B = diet containing Leucaena leucocephala - 6% [LL]; C = diet containing Leucaena cunningan - 6% [LC] and D = diet containing Pigeous bean - Cajanus cajan - 20% [CC]), four replicates and 30 broiler chicks per experimental unit. The broiler chicks, which were fed with LL and LC containing diets showed lower weight gain and a worse feed: gain in the periods from 1 to 21 and from 1 to 42 days of age. At 21stdays of age only the broiler chicks fed with LC containing diet showed a higher villi size in jejunum and villi: crypt ratio in jejunum and ileum. There was significant increase on the number of Goblet cells in the duodenum and jejunum in the broiler chicks of all treatments at the 21st day of age, and only broiler chicks fed with LL and LC containing diets showed an increased number of Goblet cells in the ileum. At 42th day of age, an increase of Goblet cells was observed in the duodenum of broiler chicks fed with CC containing diets, and in the ileum of broiler chicks fed with LL, LC e CC containing diets. Feed intake and crypt depth were not influenced by treatments in any of the experimental periods. Alterations on jejunum villi morphology, villi: crypt ratio and increased number of Goblet cells in the initial period resulted on a worse weight gain and feed: gain in the initial and total growth periods of the broiler chicks.

AB  - An experiment with eleven multipurpose tree species was conducted on red sandy loam soils of Agroforestry block in Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University, Rajendranagar campus. Evaluation of tree species nine years after plantation revealed that Dalbergia sissoo, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia auriculiformis and Eucalyptus camaldulensis were fast growing and suitable to Southern Telengana Zone of Andhra Pradesh which are dominated with red sandy loam soil. Studies on biomass production (Small and log wood) of eleven multipurpose tree species revealed that Dalbergia sissoo (214.6 t ha-1) recorded maximum biomass followed by Leucaena leucocephala (187.81 ha-1) and Acacia auriculiformis (162.41 ha-1). Maximum Mean Annual Biomass Production (MABP) recorded was also more for Dalbergia sissoo (23.8 t ha-1) followed by Leucaena leucocephala (20.9 t ha-1) and Acacia auriculiformis (18.0 t ha-1). Biomass yield component studies such as foliage yield at ninth year after planting revealed that maximum foliage production on oven dry weight basis was recorded by Leucaena leucocephala (16.8 t ha-1) followed by Acacia auriculiformis (12.0 t ha-1) and Eucalyptus camaldulensis (9.9 t ha-1). Cost benefit analysis of the study showed that for every rupee spent on cultivation of these tree species, highest return was obtained from Dalbergia sissoo (4.4) followed by Leucaena leucocephala (4.0), Acacia auriculiformis (3.1) and Eucalyptus (2.9).

AB  - During a 720-d experiment in a Holstein and Brown Swiss herd, two feeding regimens were compared during the grazing phase of dry cow management until confinement before expected calving. The two treatments involved rotational grazing (24-d cycles) at a stocking rate of 2.5 animals per hectare in: (A) all-grass swards or (B) all-grass plus 3 h daily access to swards of Leucaena leucocephala and grasses. Large heifers were added as needed to maintain constant group size at pasture. A daily supplement of 2 kg/head of bulky concentrate was fed. During the first 19 mo of the study, while rainfall was adequate, dry cows in treatments A and B gained live weight (LW) satisfactorily (0.69 ± 0.26 and 0.67 ± 0.23 kg/d) and increased in body condition score (BCS) on a scale of 1 to 5 at rates of 0.40 and 0.34 point/100 d, respectively. During the final 5 mo, pasture conditions and LW gains were poor because of prolonged drought. Monthly rainfall of 50 mm or more maintained grazing conditions adequate for use with the present level of supplemental feeding. There were no differences (P > 0.05) between treatments. Under common postpartum management, standard 305-d lactational milk yields were unaffected by previous treatments A or B. However, a positive trend (P < 0.10) was associated with higher prepartum BCS. Cows that scored <3.0, 3.0, 3.25, 3.5 and >3.5 produced 4,013; 4,111; 4,367; 4,627 and 4,450 kg, respectively. Postcalving reproductive performance was not affected by previous treatment or by BCS prepartum or BCS at 6 wk postpartum.

AB  - Two experiments using newly weaned heifers or steers compared leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) (0.4 ha) + bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) (0.4 ha) vs bahiagrass (0.8 ha) (3 replicates). In Experiment I, 18 heifers were inoculated with dihydroxypyridine-degrading (DHP) bacteria and placed on treatments from June 1994-January 1995. Presentation yields of leucaena leaf in June were 1800 kg/ha with 30% crude protein, and 62% IVOMD. Liveweight gains (LWG) for 1994 were greater for heifers grazing leucaena + bahiagrass (34 kg/hd) vs bahiagrass alone (12 kg/hd) even though heifers ate little leucaena until September. Experiment I continued with the same group of heifers grazing the same treatments from April-December 1995. Leucaena leaf was 1200 kg/ha in April and virtually nil by June. LWGs were similar for both groups. In Experiment II, two different groups of 18 steers each grazed from July-November 1996 and 1997. Initial presentation yields of leucaena leaf in July 1996 and 1997 averaged 2200 kg/ha and declined to 400 kg/ha in November each year. Mean LWG over 112 days in 1996 and 1997 was 53 kg/hd for steers grazing bahiagrass + leucaena and 8 kg/hd for steers grazing bahiagrass alone. Passive transfer of DHP-degrading bacteria was demonstrated. Leucaena is a dependable legume and can provide a high level of nutrition for weaned cattle in Florida providing its use is deferred until late summer when bahiagrass nutritive value is low. Weaned cattle not accustomed to leucaena may require adaptation by grazing with cattle used to grazing leucaena in order to hasten acceptance and permit transfer of rumen bacteria with DHP-degrading ability.

AB  - Archaeological specimens of Leucaena (Fabaceae; Mimosoideae) previously published (Tamaulipas, Tehuacan Valley, and Oaxaca Valley) which are housed at the Departmento de Prehistoria, Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Mexico City, were reexamined. Selected remains from Tehuacan were observed with scanning electron microscopy and ultrastructural features were compared to material from herbarium specimens. External epidermis near margins of legume valves provided identification characteristics (stomata abundance and m0orphology, texture, pubescence). In Tehuacan, L. leucocephala subsp. glabrata was found in addition to two previously reported taxa - L, esculenta and L. diversifolia subsp, stenocarpa (L. pueblana). Acacia sericea, a wild tree with edible legumes, was frequently misidentified as Leucaena. In Guild Naquitz, Oaxaca, all samples reported as L. esculenta were identified as another edible, wild legume tree, Conzatia multiflora. Chronology was assigned following published reports and, also for Tehuacan, the field catalogue. Possible use was assigned based upon evidence of chewing and insect damage, indicating ripeness of legumes. No direct evidence of cultivation was found. However, the presence of L. esculenta in Tehuacan (since ca. 4000-1000 B.C.) and of L. 1. glabrata (since ca. 300 B.C. - A.D. 780) suggests their introduction there as a cultivated plant.

AB  - An investigation conducted from 1990-91 to 1992-93 to study the response of subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) green manuring in alley cropped maize (Zea mays L.)-groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) system with alleys at 6 m distance having paired rows at 30 cm apart showed significant influence on yield of maize and groundnut. On an average, grain yield of maize and pod yield of groundnut with recommended dose of fertilizer and green-manuring were higher by 8.84% and 9.18% respectively over the recommended dose alone. The grain yield of maize at recommended dose of fertilizer alone was on a par with that of 75% N with green-manuring during the 3 years. The pod yield of groundnut differed significantly only during 1991-92. The pod yield at 50% recommended dose of fertilizer with green-manuring was on a par with that of recommended dose of fertilizer alone. On an average, organic nitrogen added from subabul to different treatments ranged from 35.01 kg to 41.37 kg/ha.

AB  - Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) and Gliricidia sepium (gliricidia) supplementation on intake, digestion, outflow rates, microbial protein yield and live-weight changes in sheep fed with ammoniated rice straw (ARS). In experiment 1, three rumen cannulated Japanese Corriedale wether (mean body weight of 35.6 kg) in 3 × 3 Latin Square Design were used. Animals were fed ad libitum ARS alone, or supplemented with 200 g of either leucaena or gliricidia. In experiment 2, twenty-four growing native Philippine sheep with average body weight of 13.5 ± 0.25 kg were used in a completely randomized design (CRD) and offered similar diets to those of experiment 1. Supplementation increased total dry matter intake and nutrient digestibility except for fiber (p<0.05) without affecting ARS consumption. Nitrogen balance revealed that absorbed and retained N was significantly higher in leucaena and gliricidia. The significant improvement in N utilization and more digestible OM intake brought about by the inclusion of leucaena and gliricidia to ARS resulted in increased (p<0.05) microbial N yield. Efficiency of microbial N supply in supplemented group was not significantly different, but higher (p<0.05) than the 24.92 g N/kg DOMR for ARS group. Liquid outflow rate was 7.8 and 6.8%/h, while the solid phase of rumen digesta was 4.4 and 3.8%/h for the leucaena and gliricidia group respectively, which were significantly higher than 5.30 and 2.50%/h in the control diet. The increase in total DMI resulted to higher (p<0.01) growth performance and efficient feed utilization. Average daily gain (ADG) was 19.3, 34.6 and 33.9 g/d for the ARS, leucaena and gliricidia respectively. It is therefore concluded that addition of leucaena and gliricidia to ARS in could increase nutrient intake and digestibility, subsequently improving N utilization and livestock performance.

AB  - A study was conducted to observe the nodulation status and measure nitrogenase activity of some important legume tree species in nursery. Of the thirteen species surveyed eight belong to Mimoceae, two Papilionaceae and three Caesalpiniaceae. All the species in Mimo-ceae and Papilionaceae were found nodulated whereas all the members of Caesalpiniaceae were non-nodulated. Among nodulated seedlings, highest number of nodules per seedling was recorded in Leucaena leucocephala (82) followed by Acacia auriculiformis (55), Acacia mangium (52), Albizia lebbeck (46), A. procera (41), Dalbergia sissoo (32) and Acacia catechu (29). Nitrogenase activity was highest in L. leucocephla (4913.59 nmole C2H4 h−1) followed by Albizia procera (2080 nmole C2H4 h−1). Seedling height, nodule fresh weight, root fresh weight and nitrogenase activity (per nodule per h, per gram nodule fresh weight per h, per gram root fresh weight per h and per gram root dry weight per h) were also highest in L. leucocephala. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Mimosine is a non-protein amino acid found in the forage legume Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, which is toxic to animals, has alellopathic effects and is an inhibitor of cell division with potential pharmacological applications. The regulation of mimosine accumulation in seedlings of L. leucocephala during early development, in different parts of seedlings and in response to various chemical and physical factors was examined. Mimosine was extracted in acid, purified by paper chromatography, and quantified spectrophotometrically through the reaction with p-nitroaniline. The highest mimosine content was found in the shoots. In etiolated seedlings exposed to light, there was an initial promotion of mimosine accumulation, followed by a reduction of the amount of the amino acid. Seedlings grown under light and transferred to dark had relatively more stable contents of mimosine. The amount of mimosine was increased locally by mechanical damage applied to shoots. Salicylic acid in culture media stimulated mimosine accumulation in roots. During early germination and axillary bud activation for plantlet formation, there was a significant reduction in mimosine content. The overall results indicate that the accumulation of mimosine is regulated by ontogenesis and environmental factors. This suggests that mimosine has adaptive roles, such as an ecochemical agent and a nutritional reserve source. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The effects of inter-row spacing of Leucaena leucocephala in an alley cropping system on the incidence and severity of diseases on intercropped beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and their yield were examined over two years (1993 and 1994) at Chepkoilel Campus in Kenya. Each experiment consisted of three randomized blocks with treatments of three alley widths (2 m, 4 m and 8 m) and a treeless control with two intra-row spacings of Leucaena (0.5 m and 1.0 m). Hedgerows were coppiced at 1.0 m height and pruned subsequently at two-to-three months intervals. No fertilizer was applied but Leucaena loppings were incorporated as green leaf manure. Incidence of angular leaf spot (Phaeoisariopsis griseola) and anthracnose (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum) on beans were assessed at three growth stages in each season, using the Centro International de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) scales. Microclimate was monitored in treatments, in 1994. Angular leaf spot and anthracnose decreased with increasing alley width and were more severe in bean rows adjacent to hedgerows. Light availability and diurnal temperature reaching the bean canopy increased with alley width but relative humidity and leaf wetness duration decreased. Proximity to hedgerows also had markedly reduced light levels, lower temperatures and higher relative humidity. Higher incidence and severity of angular leaf spot and anthracnose on beans in alleys than on beans in treeless plots were examined in relation to microclimate, inoculum survival and dispersal. The pattern of the diseases was best explained by microclimate changes induced by Leucaena hedgerows, especially effects of humidity.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted during rainy season (kharif) of 1993-94 to 1995-96 at Jhansi to study the productivity and sustainability of food-fodder alley cropping systems under dryland conditions of Bundelkhand region. Data revealed that significantly more grain, stover yield of sorghum, green fodder, dry-matter yield of fodder crops and sorghum grain equivalent yield were obtained in no tree association (control) compared with the farm boundary plantations with shisham (Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. ex DC) and alley species with subabul (Leucaena leucoccphala (Lam.) de Wit). Intercropping of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) + pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp) gave significantly highest grain and stover yield of sorghum compared with the other systems. Sorghum + cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) intercropping system gave significantly highest green fodder and dry-matter yield compared with the sorghum + grass strips. Among the different manurial schedules, half inorganic fertilizer + half organic manure doses gave significantly highest grain and stover yield of sorghum, green fodder and dry-matter yield of fodder crops and sorghum grain equivalent yield over the other manurial schedules.

AB  - The effect of feeding Arachis glabrata, Leucaena leucocephala, Calliandra calothyrsus or Desmodium spp. leaves to commercial layer on egg production and yolk colour was compared with the effect of feeding an artificial yolk pigmentor (Carophyl ®). Percent hen-day production averaging 77.4 and 74.7%, respectively for hens fed on Desmodium spp. and Leucaena leucocephala leaves, were significantly (P<0.05) higher than egg production in the control group. No significant difference was recorded among treatment groups for shell thickness. Yolk colour in groups fed forage leaves ranges between 6.76 and 9.83 and was significantly better than in control group (2.35). It was concluded that any of the studied forage leaves could be used to supply xanthophyll to commercial layers with no detrimental effect on egg production and quality.

AB  - The N, P and K balance was studied in a 52.4 ha dairy farm on a brown soil with carbonates having a steady drainage in a sward of C. nlemfuensis (60%), P. purpureum CT-115 clone (40%)., L. leucocephala and C. cajans were intercropped in 28% of the grass area. The herd had 114 cows, 35 heifers and 24 calves, with a total yearly milk production of 100 000 litres. In general, the system showed a negative balance in the three elements (-28, -11 and -39 kg/ha/year of N, P and K, respectively), since 40% of excretions were left in the shade pens and milking parlour and were not recycled in the grassland. On the other hand, there was also a negative balance of these nutrients in the soil component with values of -103, -22 and -76 kg/ha of N, P and K, respectively, mainly due to high extraction of these elements by the pasture. Values found in the different recycling rates are discussed. These are: litter, pasture remobilization, excretion, volatization and others. The return of all the excretion to the grassland ecosystem is recommended as well as increasing the area with legumes to attain a satisfactory balance in these nutrients. Further studies must consider maintenance fertilization, nutrient losses due to leaching and denitrification, as well as the variation of the stable OM in the soil and the influence of hydrophysical properties in the recycling process.

AB  - Sixty-one forage species obtained from the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia were screened to assess their adaptation to the subhumid zone of Nigeria. The control species were: Andropogon gayanus and Chloris gayana (grasses); Stylosanthes hamata (herbaceous legume); and Leucaena leucocephala (browse shrub). The highest mean yields over 3 years occurred in C. gayana ILCA 6627 (grass), S. guianensis ILCA 7285 (herbaceous legume) and Sesbania sesban, ILCA 1193 (browse shrub). Among the grasses, A. gayanus (control) largely maintained its greenness during the dry season while Panicum maximum ILCA 144 performed poorly during this period. In the hercaceous legumes, S. guianensis ILCA 7285 and Centrosema macrocarpum ILCA 151 remained green over the dry season. All promising browse species were highly drought-tolerant. The screening confirmed earlier reports on the performance of most Cenchrus and Chloris spp. in the subhumid vegetational zone. Neonotonia spp. and C. macrocarpum ILCA 151 failed to flower during the study period.

AB  - Decomposition and N release patterns from prunings of eight tree species were studied under field conditions. Leaves and stems (<1 cm diam) from 4-yr-old hedgerows were sealed in separate litter hags and placed on soil surface at low and high elevation (1150 m) sites in Haiti. Leaves decomposed faster than stems and leaf decomposition was described by a two-pool exponential model. At the low elevation, leaf C loss was highest (82%) in gliricidia [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp.] and lowest (42%) in flamboyant [Delonix regia (Bojer ex Hook) Raf.] after 48 wk. At the high elevation, leaf C loss after 48 wk was 48% in leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit] and 29% in Acacia angustissima (Mill.) Kuntze. Initial N concentrations correlated with leaf C loss (Phase I) at low elevation while C:N and lignin:N correlated with leaf C loss (Phase II) at low and high elevations, respectively. Nitrogen release resembled carbon loss. At the low elevation, gliricidia, Leucaena shannonii Donn. Sm., and leucaena released >50 kg N ha-1 during the first 4 to 6 wk, whereas at high elevation A. angustissima contributed <40 kg N ha-1 during the period. Leaf N release correlated negatively with (lignin + polyphenol):N at low elevation. At the low elevation, gliricidia, L. shannonii, and leucaena provided adequate N for maize production in alley cropping. At the high elevation, A. angustissima contained adequate N, but N release rate may not meet peak N demands of an associated crop.

AB  - The nitrification inhibition (NI) bioassay guided fractionation of the methanol extract of lyophilized and milled roots of Leuceana leucocephala resulted in the isolation of four compounds, 1-4, as confirmed from their 1H and 13C NMR spectral data. Compound 1, gallocatechin, was the most active NI inhibitor at 12μg/mL. Epigallocatechin, 2, and epicatechin, 4, isolated as mixtures, were not assayed individually for their NI inhibitory activities against the nitrification bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea.

AB  - Bouldery riverbed lands occupy about one-third of the geographical area in Doon Valley of north-west India. These marginal lands need rehabilitation through establishment of silvopasture system for meeting the biomass requirements of resource-poor farmers. A study was carried out for 14 years (1980 to 1993) at Dehradun, involving four multi-purpose tree species viz. Albizia lebbek (L.) Benth., Grewia optiva Drumm., Bauhinia purpurea L. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit.; and two grass species viz. Chrysopogon fulvus (Spreng.) Chiov. and Eulaliopsis binata (Retz.) C.E. Hubb. Fifty and 75% of the tree crown was lopped once a year after four years of age. Tree survival decreased with age, and was highest with L. leucocephala (86.9% in 1993 of initial density of 625 trees ha-1) and lowest with B. purpurea (49.3%). Canopy parameters of trees progressed differently, presumably due to their varying growth habits. The trees of A. lebbek were taller with more crown spread, whereas G. optiva had more crown height with lesser crown spread. Stem diameter growth of A. lebbek was highest followed by B. purpurea. Lopping intensity did not affect tree survival and also canopy growth in most years, but collar diameter and diameter at breast height (dbh) decreased significantly at the higher intensity of lopping. Intercropped grass species E. binata caused a greater adverse effect on the tree survival and growth parameters than C. fulvus. The biomass production (leaf and branch wood weight of lopped material) was highest at eight years of age in 1987 but showed no definite trend over the study period. Bauhinia purpurea produced the highest biomass and L. leucocephala the lowest, despite opposite trends in their survival. The performance of A. lebbek was on par with B. purpurea in the later years (1990-1993), but G. optiva was inferior despite its superiority in the early years (1984-1985). The effects of lopping intensity were not appreciable, but intercropping with E. binata decreased leaf and branch wood production significantly compared with C. fulvus throughout. However, the adverse effect was comparatively less pronounced on B. purpurea and A. lebbek than on G. optiva and L. leucocephala. The fibre yield of G. optiva also decreased due to intercropped E. binata compared with C. fulvus.

TI  - Productivity, nutrient cycling, and succession in single- and mixed-species plantations of Casuarina equisetifolia, Eucalyptus robusta, and Leucaena leucocephala in Puerto Rico
PY  - 1999

AB  - Tree growth, biomass productivity, litterfall mass and nutrient content, changes in soil chemical properties and understory forest succession were evaluated over a 8.5-year period in single- and mixed-species (50: 50) plantations of two N2-fixing species, Casuarina equisetifolia and Leucaena leucocephala, and a non-fixing species, Eucalyptus robusta. At the optimal harvest age for maximum biomass production (4 years), total aboveground biomass ranged from 63 Mg ha-1 in the Eucalyptus monoculture to 124 Mg ha-1 in the Casuarina/Leucaena mixture, and was generally greater in the mixed-species than in single-species treatments due to increased productivity of the N-fixing species in the mixed stands. Total litterfall varied from 5.3 to 10.0 Mg ha-1 year-1 among treatments, or between 5.9% and 13.2% of net primary production. Litterfall production and rates of nutrient return for N, P, K, Ca and Mg were generally highest for Leucaena, intermediate for Casuarina and lowest for Eucalyptus. These rates were usually higher in the mixed-species than in monospecific stands due to differences in biomass productivity, but varied considerably depending on their species composition. Total system carbon and nutrient pools (in biomass plus soils to 40-cm depth) for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn at four years were consistently greater in the plantation treatments than in the unplanted control plots. Relative to the single-species plantations, these system pools were generally larger in the mixed-species plantations for C (-10% to +10%), N (+17% to +50%), P (-1% to +63%), K (- 19% to +46%), Ca (-10% to +48%), Mg (+5% to +57%) and Mn (+19% to +86%). Whole-tree harvests at four years would result in substantial system carbon and nutrient losses, although these estimated losses would not exceed the estimated gains realized during the four-year period of tree growth at this site. At 7.5 years, soil organic matter and effective cation exchange capacity were reduced in all plantation treatments relative to the control. Changes in soil nutrient content from 0 to 7.5 years were highly variable and not significantly different among treatments, although stands containing Leucaena generally showed higher rates of nitrogen and phosphorus accretion in soils than those with Eucalyptus and/or Casuarina. Natural regeneration of secondary forest tree and shrub species increased over time in all plantation treatments. A total of 24 native or naturalized forest species were recorded in the plantations at 8.5 years. Woody species abundance at this age was significantly greater beneath Casuarina than either Eucalyptus or the Eucalyptus/Leucaena mixed stands. Species richness and diversity, however, were greatest beneath stands containing Eucalyptus and/or Leucaena than in stands with Casuarina.

AB  - The effect of feeding increasing levels of Leucaena leucocephala leaf hay on the potential fertility and feed intake of male highland sheep maintained on roughage diet was studied. In treatment 1 (NS), animals received only chickpea haulm. Treatments 2 (L100), 3 (L200) and 4 (L300) consisted of 100, 200 and 300 g per head per day of sun dried leucaena leaf hay while sheep under treatment 5 (C300) received 300 g per head per day of concentrate supplement. Chickpea haulm was offered ad-libitum to all groups and water and mineral licks were freely available. Addition of leucaena improved total dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) intake significantly without depressing the intake of the basal diet. Supplementation increased the percentage of motile cells (10 vs. 76% for L300) and mass activity/motility score (1.5 vs. 3.2 for L300) of spermatozoa while reducing the incidence of total morphologically defective sperm cells (34 vs. 5% for L200). Volume of ejaculate (0.36 vs. 1.1 ml for L200), sperm concentration (2.8 vs. 7.1 x 109 ml-1 for L300), and total number of spermatozoa per ejaculate (1.96 vs. 5.92 x 109 per ejaculate for L300), increased significantly as a result of supplementation. Testicular size showed significant differences among treatment groups and generally increased with supplementation. It was concluded that supplementation of up to 300 g per head per day of leucaena resulted in improved feed intake, testicular growth, sperm production and semen quality of Ethiopian highland sheep offered chickpea haulm basal diet.

AB  - Freeze dried samples of the leaves of six tropical leguminous shrubs were studied. Digestibilities of dry matter (IVDMD) and nitrogen (IVND) were determined in vitro using rumen fluid from sheep in the presence and absence of polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG). The difference due to PEG, the tannin effect, was more marked for IVND than for IVDMD and varied with species. The improvement for Acacia boliviana, Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena trichandra was large, intermediate with L. leucocephala and L. pallida and small with Gliricidia sepium (range 5.5-33.8 digestibility units). The tannin effect was poorly correlated with previously published (Jackson et al., 1996) data on the butanol CT levels in these samples: extractable CT (r2=0.0007); protein bound (r2=0.485); fibre bound (r2=0.566); and total CT (r2=0.1473). The bound CT and total CT were negatively related to the PEG effect. Vanillin CT was positively correlated with the PEG effect (r2=0.578). Two species, A. boliviana and C. calothyrsus, behaved differently to the others. Omitting these from the regressions improved the relationships with both butanol extractable CT and total butanol CT and with vanillin CT (r2≥0.9). For new pasture species, screening by using this modified in vitro digestion technique would avoid the problems of using a known CT standard or of isolating CT standards for each species. It would also provide some information on digestibility. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The antioxidant activity, expressed in mM Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), of some edible Yemeni plants belonging to different families was evaluated using the ferrylmyoglobin/ABTS.+ method. Methanolic (80%) extracts of tested plants exhibited higher (p<0.05) TEAC than extracts of other solvents. Extracts of coffee beans (Coffea arabica), sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum), wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum) and sorrel (Rumex acetosa) had antioxidant activities equivalent to 8.7-47.1 mM Trolox or 7.9-42.8 mM BHA per g dry weight of plant. The TEAC of methanolic extracts for sorrel was not significantly different (p>0.05) from extracts of Leucaena leucocephala (Thailand) and Japanese green tea (Camellia sinensis). A good correlation (R2=0.937) was observed between TEAC and total phenol contents in 80% methanol extracts of tested plants.

AB  - Incubation of cotyledons from seedlings of subabul [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de wit] in nutrient solution containing 0 or 5 mM nitrate and 0.1 mM putrescine or 5 mM glutamine, increased the nitrate-reductase activity, total nitrogen and total protein content only in the absence of nitrate. The inhibition of nitrate reductase and free amino acids by putrescine in the presence of nitrate may be either at the level of nitrate uptake and mobilization or at enzyme synthesis or inactivation. Glutamine had almost similar effect either in the presence or absence of nitrate.

AB  - The microsymbiont was isolated from the root nodule of a leguminous tree, Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit. and was identified as a Rhizobium sp. The bacteria produced a good amount of indole acetic acid (IAA) in tryptophan supplemented yeast extract mannitol (YEM) medium. For maximum production of IAA in culture, the bacteria perferred the L-isomer of tryptophan and the pH 6.9. The effect of some heavy metals (Hg2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+) on growth and IAA production by the Rhizobium was also tested. The tested three heavy metals had negative effect on growth and IAA production by the Rhizobium sp. particularly at higher concentration.

AB  - A study on the incidence and damage of insects during the establishment of two Leucaena leucocephala plantations intercropped with maize and vigna, respectively was carried out at the Institute of Animal Science. Visual samplings in prefixed furrows were carried out by random observation of 60 plants of each crop for each area with a fortnightly frequency. In the case of the vignas, 30 days after sowing, 9 samples of 20 catches were taken using an entomological net. There was a greater insect-pest incidence in the leucaena intercropped with vigna with severe damage to this seasonal species. However, Ieucaena was not largely affected in this study. The bioregulators showed a similar performance in both areas. Heteropsylla cubana was the predominating insect in leucaena with populations of 5 individuals/m2. In maize it was Spodoptera frugiperda with 1.2 larvae/m2 and in vignas, homopterous of the Empoasca genus with 23 insects/m2 and diverse Chrisomelidae that caused defoliation to the crop. It is concluded that leucaena during its establishment does not suffer physiological or plant health disorders when seasonal crops such as maize or vignas are intercropped. Maize intercropping is promisory. However, it does not seem advisable to intercrop vignas in view of phytophagous damage, which must be periodically studied.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) has been observed to control weeds when used as soil mulch. It contains mimosine, which, among other allelochemicals, is responsible for the allelopathic effect. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of leucaena on the development, root mitotic index, peroxidase activity and isoenzymes in the shoots and roots of maize seedlings. Inhibition of root growth and reduction of the mitotic index were proportional to the aqueous extract concentration. Cell division was not observed in extract concentrations equal or above 1.6%. Increase in extract concentration was followed by high peroxidase activity in roots and shoots, but no changes in peroxidase isoenzyme patterns were observed. The peroxidase activity in roots was positively correlated with the increase in anionic isoenzymes, pI 4.99 and 4.86, suggesting their participation in the thickening of roots and increased dry weight (mg/cm). High concentrations of the allelochemical mimosine were detected in concentrated aqueous extracts, possibly influencing seedling development.

AB  - Sixteen West African Dwarf Goats (WADG) were used to study the feeding behaviour and diet selection. The animals were offered freshly cut stems with leaves and fruiting bodies of Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Panicum maximum. The feeding behaviour of the goats was observed and recorded whilst the preference of the animals for each diet was also monitored. Data were collected on feed intake, number of bites per minutes, and preference for each of the forages. The data on feed intake were subjected to one-way analysis of variance. Within 30 minutes into the feeding period, it was observed that the goats concentrated on Leucaena leucocephala which they struggled over for favoured positions leading to horn locking. The animals first smelt the different plants took a bite before concentrating on a particular forage. The animals usually consumed fruiting bodies and leaves of leucaena before eating the other two forages. The mean number of bites per goat per minute was 10, 8 and 6 for gliricidia, leucaena and panicum respectively. The animals exhibited bi-pedal stance during feeding. Analysis of variance showed forage intake to be significantly different (P< 0.05) among the forages. Proximate analysis of the three forages indicated that leucaena had a higher quantity of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and ether extract. (EE) compared to the other two forages, while panicum had higher CF, lower CP, ash and EE content compared to gliricidia and leucaena.

AB  - Clustering of ten woody and shrub legumes (Acacia auriculiformis, Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena diversifolia, L. leucocephala var. K28 and var. K636, Lonchocarpus sericeus, Cajanus cajan, Crotalaria juncea and Tephrosia candida) was performed using the partitioning around medoid and the Fuzzy clustering methods to assess the appropriateness of their earlier performance rank scores for evaluating their dissimilarity within an Alfisol and an Ultisol. Differences among formed clusters were observed for the acid and non-acid soil conditions. Some species such as Albizia lebbeck and Leucaena leucocephala var. K636 isolated each in a single-species cluster, while others, depending on the soil type belonged to different closest hard clusters most likely in relation to their closeness in architecture and growth habit as well as to their genetic affinity which appear to be strong determinants of their performance similarity. Clustering analysis of species performance compared reliably well with the simple ranking in the Alfisol than it did in the Ultisol. In both soils, however, clustering analysis overcame the rigidity of the simple ranking procedure and thus led to more realistic ranking classes of species performance to the extent that, where possible, it should be recommended for discriminating species more efficiently.

AB  - Leaf extracts and mulch from 14 multipurpose trees were used to test their effects on maize germination, growth and yield. Maize germination was significantly reduced by leaf extracts of all species with increasing extract concentration. The most drastic reductions were caused by Gliricidia sepium, Tetrapleura tetraptera, Lonchocarpus sireceus, Senna siamea and Leucaena leucocephala. Terminalia superba, Tetrapleura tetraptera, Pithecelobium dulce, Gliricidia sepium and Senna siamea significantly reduced maize root growth at the lowest extract concentration, while shoot length was most significantly reduced by Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Alchornea coordifolia, Pithecelobium dulce, Terminalia superba, and Tetrapleura tetraptera at all concentrations. Growth of maize in pots and yield in the field were controlled by nitrogen supply and uptake. Fast-decomposing leaf material rich in nitrogen promoted growth and yield of maize. Thus Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium, both nitrogen-fixing legumes with high nitrogen contents and fast-decomposing leaf materials, significantly increased maize growth and yield. This suggests that the negative effects of leaf extracts observed in the laboratory are ecologically irrelevant in the field.

Since the mid-1980s the tree has suffered serious damage throughout its exotic range from the psyllid Heteropsylla cubana Crawford, which is also native to Central America. This article summarizes field studies on the tree and the psyllid conducted at 2 sites in north Thailand: a cool highland and a warm valley site. In the highlands, mean psyllid densities per shoot were slightly higher defoliation was greater, and dry matter production losses due to the psyllid were >3 times higher than those at the valley site (62.5 and 18.3% losses, respectively). Using field data, the lower thermal thresholds for tree growth and psyllid development were 11.2 and 9.6°C, respectively. Psyllid abundance was negatively correlated to temperature. When maximum temperatures exceeded 36°C, psyllid abundance fell dramatically, mortality increased, and body size decreased. These data suggest that the tree and the psyllid are climatically mismatched. H. cubana prefers new shoots, and population cycles were related to tree growth cycles. Finally, populations of the introduced parasitoid Psyllaephagus yaseeni Noyes (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), native coccinellids, and spiders showed little correlation to the psyllid population's intrinsic rate of increase. Percentages of parasitism by P. yaseeni were low (mean = 1.2-1.9%, maximum = 6.0%) and no evidence of density dependent regulation was found.

AB  - The pulping potentialities of nine exotic hardwoods from Sudan were investigated by the soda-anthraquinone method. Three eucalypts, Grevillea robusta and Azadirachta indica (neem) were the most suitable for pulping, followed by Cassia siamea and Leucaena leucocephala. Conocarpus lancifolius and Prosopis chilensis were of little value for papermaking. Generally, the pulps were similar to birch pulps, but with better tear strength. Addition ofgiiargum during beating facilitated beating and improved the wet/dry strength.

AB  - A major challenge in developing agroforestry approaches that utilize tree-leaf biomass for provision of N to crops is to ensure synchrony between the N released from decomposing prunings and N demand by crops. A study was conducted in the subhumid highlands of Kenya to assess the rate of decomposition and mineralization of soil-incorporated Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner (calliandra) and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (leucaena) tree biomass and maize roots (Zea mays L.) both in an alley cropping and a sole cropping system. The amount of mineralized N peaked four weeks after planting (WAP) maize in all the treatments during both seasons of 1995. Cumulative mineralized N at week 20 ranged from 114 to 364 kg N ha-1 season-1, the absolute control treatment giving the lowest and the prunings-incorporated treatments giving the highest amounts in the two seasons. Total N uptake by maize, ranging from 42 to 157 kg ha-1 season-1, was lowest in the 'alley-cropped, prunings-removed' treatments, and highest in the 'non alley-cropped, prunings-incorporated' treatments. The apparent N recovery rate by maize was highest in the fertilizer applied treatments in the two seasons. Decomposition rate constants (kD) ranged from 0.07 to 0.21 week-1, and the rates among the different plant residues were as follows: leucaena > calliandra > maize roots. Nitrogen release rate constants (kN), ranging from 0.04 to 0.25 week-1, followed a similar pattern as the rate of decomposition with leucaena releasing the highest amount of N followed by calliandra and lastly by maize roots.

AB  - Three cattle fattening systems were assessed with experimental data of the Institute of Animal Science according to costs and benefits of: a) intensive rotational grazing (24 paddocks) in 3.89 ha of grasses; b) rotational grazing (24 paddocks) in 3.84 ha of grasses and 2.4 ha of Leucaena leucocephala; c) traditional rotational grazing (4 paddocks) with 6.2 ha of grass and free access to 2.66 ha of leucaena. Each system had only one group of 20, 19 and 27 animals (3/4 Holstein x 1/4 Zebu), respectively with an initial liveweight of 157 kg. For each system, total expenses, value of production, profit, cost/animal and per ha and the benefit cost ratio, were estimated. Costs of each kg of liveweight were statistically assessed through a simple classification method. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) between systems. System c) showed the best monetary indices with profits higher than 4 000 Cuban pesos and the lowest cost/kg of liveweight and per animal (1.25 and 500.49, respectively) and a benefit cost ratio of 1.36. There were monetary advantages of the 4 paddock system compared to the rotational system with 24 paddocks, because of lower exploitation expenses and better animal performance. Further long-term studies must be carried to reduce paddock costs in the systems using intensive rotational grazing without affecting animal performance.

AB  - Weed seed rain was monitored in field plots under three fallow types and four landuse intensities in Ibadan, Nigeria, in 1994 and 1995. The fallow types were natural bush, planted Leucaena leucocephala, and Pueraria phaseoloides. The land-use intensities consisted of continuous cropping, involving Zea mays/Manihot esculenta and fallowing for 1, 2, and 3 yr, with each fallow period followed by 1 yr of Z. mays/M. esculenta cultivation. In 1994, seed rain in plots cropped after P. phaseoloids fallow was significantly lower than in plots cropped after bush or L, leucocephala fallow. Pueraria phaseoloides plots had similar seed rain as bush fallow plots in 1995, and the seed rain in these plots was significantly lower than in L. leucocephala plots. Weed seed rain was significantly higher in continuously cultivated plots across all fallow types than in plots that were cultivated after one or more years of fallow. The lowest seed rain was in plots that were cropped once after a 3-yr fallow. The largest quantity of weed seed input in the plots occurred in either August or September, reflecting the life cycle of the annual weeds that dominated the vegetation. Individual species differed in pattern and duration of shedding seeds within the fallow systems and land-use intensities. Annual weeds dominated the seed rain in continuously cropped plots, and seeds of perennial weeds were dominant in plots fallowed for more than 1 yr before cultivation. Weeds flowered earlier in continuously cropped plots than in plots that were cropped after 2 or 3 yr of fallow. Increased land-use intensity caused an increase in seed rain and consequently increased the soil seed bank. Pueraria phaseoloides fallow was more effective in shading weeds and probably reducing the quantity of light reaching them than the natural bush and planted L. leucocephala fallow systems, and this may have been the basis of the significantly lower seed rain in P. phaseoloides plots.

AB  - Mimosine is a toxic compound presents in the tropical legume Leucaena leucocephala which restrict the nutritional use of this plant in domestic animals. Both monogastrics and ruminants could undergo toxicity consuming this plant. Some ruminants can tolerate it because they have rumen microorganisms able to degrade mimosine and its pyridinediols derivatives: 3,4- y 2,3-Dihidroxypyridine (3,4- and 2,3-DHP). In the present study the existence of 2,3-DHP degrading-activity in mixed rumen bacterial cultures from cattle consuming L. leucocephala in Venezuela was determined, and the degradation of toxic pyridinediols by the rumen bacterium Synergistes jonesii was characterized. In vitro experiments using pure culture of S. jonesii indicated that the 2,3-DHP degradation was carried out at the end of the log-phase of bacterial growth and also the system showed substrate inhibition at high concentration of pyridinediols suggesting that a threshold of enzymes that allows 2,3-DHP-degradation from the medium is needed. S. jonesii is unable to degrade mimosine but it showed degrading activity against the mimosine derivatives 3,4-DHP and its isomer 2,3-DHP. 3,4-DHP induces an isomerase activity, which is lacking when the culture grows in 2,3-DHP. This latest activity is the responsible of the transformation of 3,4-DHP into 2,3-DHP. It was also showed that the degradation is a substrate-induced enzymatic system. However, the lack of substrate might cause the irreversible lost of 2,3-DHP degrading-activity. 2,3-DHP was found as intermediary substrate and also induced the expression of degrading enzymes in S. jonesii.

AB  - Growth data based on actual felling of Leucaena leucocephala trees, with in the DBH range of 10-25 cm, planted at the boundary of fields were recorded. Prediction of total above ground biomass were attempted through allometric regressions of the type Y=b* Xc; where Y is the total above ground biomass and X is diameter at 30% of the total height. The estimates of the parameters of the nonlinear model were computed using Gauss-Newton exact derivatives. For assessing the certainty of the parameters estimates, Wald confidence region and Cook and Weisberg confidence curves were plotted. The effect of over parameterization in the full model was solved by fixing one parameter and estimating the other for which C-W curve shows asymetry in distribution. The model: Biomass = 0.365* (dia.30)2.259 with R2 = 0.95 was found optimum to provide maximum possible prediction.

AB  - The nutritive value of leaf materials from five each of nitrogen (NFT), namely, Acacia nilotica, Albizia lebbeck, Butea monosperma, Leucaena leucocephala, Pongamia pinnata and non-nitrogen fixing multipurpose tree (non-NFT) species, namely, Anogeissus pendula, Azadirachta indica, Ficus bengalensis, Terminalia arjuna and Syzygium cumini grown at National Research Centre for Agroforestry, were evaluated by chemical and in sacco methods. Mean organic matter (OM) concentration (g kg-1 dry matter) was comparable between NFT (902 ± 5.3) and non-NFT (916 ± 6.5). However, significantly (P < 0.05) higher mean crude protein (CP) contents (g kg-1 DM) were recorded in NFT (174 ± 10.7) than non-NFT (96 ± 1.5) with maximum in L. leucocephala (228) and minimum in F. bengalensis (88), respectively. Mean neutral detergent fibre (NDF) contents were relatively lower in NFT than in non-NFT. Significantly (P < 0.05) higher contents of NDF, acid detergent fibre (ADF) and lignin (g kg-1 DM) were observed in F. bengalensis (597, 458 and 222) and S. cumini (566, 483 and 279) than in any of the other trees. Total phenolics (TP) concentration was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in NFT except for A. nilotica, but higher (P < 0.05) in non-NFT except in F. bengalensis. Mean condensed tannins (CT) concentration differed significantly (P < 0.05) between NFT and non-NFT and ranged from 17 to 31 and 14 to 94 g kg-1 DM, respectively. In sacco degradability of DM differed significantly (P < 0.05) amongst the MPTs and ranged from 504 to 809 for NFT and 513 to 881 g kg-1 DM for non-NFT, respectively. Mean CP degradability (g kg-1 DM) was similar for (P < 0.05) NFT (659 ± 24.1) and non-NFT (661 ± 62.5). Cell wall contents degradability was relatively higher in non-NFT than NFT. However, a poor correlation was observed between anti-nutritional characters and in sacco degradability, whereas strong negative correlations were recorded between DM degradability and NDF, ADF and cellulose contents. The NFT contained high CP and low cell wall contents and anti-nutritional characters, however the in sacco degradability of nutrients was less for non-NFT. Nutritive value of the trees indicated that all the species could potentially be used as protein banks to supplement grass or crop residues in dry seasons. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - In vitro techniques were evaluated to determine the nutritive value of a selection of tanniniferous tree and shrub legumes (Calliandra calothyrsus, Leucaena leucocephala L. diversifolia and L. pallida) compared with lucerne (Medicago sativa). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was also added to some in vitro fermentations (10 mg PEG/50 mg plant substrate) to assess the effects of tannins on digestion of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and nitrogen (N). Total tannin content was poorly correlated with digestibility of dry matter and nitrogen. Apparent digestibility of dry matter and N were significantly different between plants and ranked in the following order; lucerne > L. leucocephala > L. diversifolia > L. pallida > C. calothyrsus. Ammonia was not produced (net accumulation) during 72 h fermentation of C. calothyrsus, L. diversifolia and L. pallida although apparent nitrogen digestion in these plants ranged from 36.9 to 44.3%. Acid-pepsin digestion resulted in a further 17-22% of dry matter digestion in the shrub legumes compared with 8% in lucerne following 72 h fermentation. The amount of acid-pepsin digestible N available was lowest for lucerne (8.4%) and highest for L. pallida (38.9%) with the other legumes ranging from 26.5 to 36.8%. The PEG addition caused a significant increase in rate and extent of DM and NDF digestibility and ammonia production for all the tannin containing shrub legumes but not for lucerne. However, DM loss and fermentability of these plants appeared to be poorly correlated because PEG addition resulted in an increase in volatile fatty acid production ranging from 3.7 to 202% compared with an increase in apparent DM digestibility of 9.1-30%. It is concluded that in vitro evaluation of apparent DM and N digestibility of tannin containing plants provides a poor indication of true digestion (fermentability) and thus measurements of fermentation end-products (ammonia and short and branched chain fatty acids) should also be undertaken to evaluate nutritive value. Also, addition of PEG to in vitro fermentations can be used to determine the effect of tannins on N digestibility. Based on the in vitro methods of rumen fermentation used in this study, nutritive value of the tanniniferous forages is ranked as follows: L. leucocephala > L. diversifolia and L. pallida > C. calothyrsus.

AB  - We surveyed the relationship between the secondary-successional pathway and species diversity in secondary forests that have developed in the 55 years following agricultural abandonment throughout the Southern Region of Hahajima Island, one of the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, in the northwestern Pacific. Four forest types (Leucaena leucocephala comm., Bischofia javanica -Morus australis comm., Rhaphiolepis wrightiana comm., and Planchonella obovata-Hibiscus glaber comm.) were distinguished at the second level of the TWINSPAN classification, and differed from each other in the secondary-successional pathway interpreted from several historical aerial photographs. The late-successional secondary forests in areas that were invaded by L. leucocephala (B. javanica-M. australis comm.) differ markedly in species composition and forest structure from those in areas that were not invaded by L. leucocephala (R. wrightiana comm.). Late-successional alien species (B. javanica and M. australis) dominate the former areas and biodiversity is significantly lower, whereas the latter areas are more similar to the remaining natural forests in terms of both species composition and species diversity. This comparison suggests that biological invasion irreversibly changes the secondary-successional pathway, and decreases the species diversity of late-successional secondary forests.

AB  - The decline in yield of plantain has partly been attributed to inadequate soil moisture and pests, particularly nematodes. The objectives of the study therefore were to determine the effect of mulch from Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia macrophylla (Willd.) Merr. grown as hedgerows on (i) soil moisture and temperature (ii) growth and yield of plantain and (iii) pathogenic nematode populations. The study was conducted from 1991 to 1994 in Kumasi, Ghana. Treatments comprised of leguminous plants, L. leucocephala and F. macrophylla, and a control (no leguminous plants), arranged in a randomised complete block design with four replications. The leguminous plants were planted in 1991 while the plantain was planted in 1992. Results indicated that the highest biomass yield was produced by F. macrophylla. Mulching with prunings of F. macrophylla resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) higher retention of soil moisture and lower soil temperatures than mulching with prunings of L. leucocephala. Growth of plantain determined by plant height, leaf production, pseudostem girth and yield were significantly greater in F. macrophylla mulched plots than L. leucocephala treatment and control plots where no mulch was applied. Plant parasitic nematodes isolated were Meloidogyne spp., Pratylenchus spp., Paratylenchus spp., Helicotylenchus spp., and Rotylenchus spp. Three years after planting of hedgerows, significantly (P < 0.05) higher populations of Meloidogyne spp. (367 per 100 g soil), Paratylenchus spp. (92 per 100 g soil), Helicotylenchus spp. (8 per 100 g soil), and Rotylenchus spp. (308 per 100 g soil) were associated with L. leucocephala hedgerow than with Flemingia macrophylla hedgerow (42.0, 83.0 per 100 g soil) and the control (74.50, 41.0 per 100 g soil). F. macrophylla has qualities that suppress nematode populations. The results clearly indicated the superiority of Flemingia macrophylla over Leucaena leucocephala as much for plantain production.

AB  - Enterolobium (Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Jacq.) Griseb) is a leguminous tree that has potential for use as a shade tree, in woodlots, for soil conservation and for fodder, and has wide ecological adaptation. A greenhouse study was conducted to determine the potential of Enterolobium as a fast-grower during its first three months of growth relative to Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam. de Wit) and Gliricidia (Gliricidia septum Walp.), the most commonly grown tree legumes in the lowland humid tropics of West Africa. The root and shoot growth of Enterolobium was generally similar (or better, before 6-8 weeks of growth) to that of Gliricidia, but was significantly more than that of Leucaena. Enterolobium nodulated freely without Rhizobium inoculation to the same extent as Gliricidia up to 10 weeks after planting; thereafter Gliricidia produced more nodules. Enterolobium produced more nodules than Leucaena throughout the period of sampling. There were, on average, 50 nodules/plant in Leucaena, 115 in Enterolobium and 223 in Gliricidia at 12 weeks after planting. Thus, compared with Leucaena and Gliricidia, Enterolobium is a fast-growing leguminous tree that nodulates early and freely with native rhizobia. The productivity of Enterolobium under regular cutting management and the value of the foliage as mulch/green manure and fodder need to be determined.

AB  - The relationships between cow nutrition, restricted suckling and milking patterns and their effect on milk yield, milk composition and calf growth were examined under tropical conditions in south east Mexico. Eleven Bos indicus x Bos taurus cows, 14 days postpartum, with calves weighing on average 37 kg were used in a change-over experimental design. All cows were fed Cynodon nlemfuensis hay ad libitum, and either 4.0 kg Leucaena leucocephala, 2.0 kg sorghum grain and 0.25 kg sugar-cane molasses on a fresh weight basis (L1), or twice this amount of the same supplement (L2). The calves were offered the same hay ad libitum in addition to suckling milk. The milking/restricted suckling treatments were: twice-daily milking with suckling after morning milking (2 x AM), and once-daily milking in the morning with afternoon suckling (1 x PM). The two regimes were examined at L1 and L2 feeding levels. A suckling time of 30 min was allowed at each suckling occasion. For 2 x AML1, 2 x AML2, 1 x PML1 and 1 x PML2, respectively saleable milk yields (SMYs) (kg/day) were 5.43, 5.99, 3.47, 4.09 (S.E.M. 0.174); calf suckled milk (CSM) (kg/day) 1.36, 1.46, 3.14, 3.43 (S.E.M. 0.160); and total milk yield (kg/day) 6.79, 7.46, 6.62, 7.53 (S.E.M. 0.226). For SMYs, fat contents (g/kg) were 30.0, 29.4, 29.0, 28.7 (S.E.M. 1.11), respectively, and for CSM 59.6, 63.4, 38.8, 42.4 (S.E.M. 2.46).

AB  - The influence of formaldehyde fumigation and pesticide drenching with Bavistin, Cuman, Copperthom, Sulfex, Furadan, and Termix on the dynamics of root colonisation by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, spore number and rhizobial nodule number was investigated. Plant growth and nutrient accumulation were assessed regularly for a period of 90 days in the forest tree legumes, viz. Acacia mellifera, A. nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala, under open nursery conditions. Pesticide drenching initially enhanced AM fungal colonisation and spore count gradually increased with age of the seedlings. Sulfex and Termix treatments significantly increased the spore number 90 days after emergence in all three tree legumes. Termix treatment enhanced the nodule numbers of the seedlings at 30 day after emergence in all three tree legumes. Sulfex responded at later stages when compared with the control, though the nodulation positively correlated with the age of the seedlings. Pesticides reduced plant growth of the legume seedlings at all age levels. Nitrogen and potassium contents were higher in seedlings grown in formaldehyde fumigated beds than in the control, but the accumulation of phosphorus was lower in all pesticide treatments.

AB  - A novel rhizobial group, cluster 9, defined in previous research [Tan, Z. Y., Wang, E.T., Peng, G. X., Zhu, M.E., Martínez-Romero, E. & Chen, W.X. (1999). Int J Syst Bacteriol 49, 1457-1469], was further characterized by determination of DNA base composition, whole-cell protein SDS-PAGE analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and host specificity. These isolates were collected from the wild legumes Amphicarpaea trisperma, Coronilla varia and Gueldenstaedtia multiflora growing in arid and semi-arid regions in north-western China. Isolates within cluster 9 grouped into a single cluster above a similarity level of 90.6 % in a cluster analysis based on protein SDS-PAGE, and they were differentiated from defined rhizobial species. Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that isolate CCBAU 71623T, representing cluster 9, was most related to Rhizobium gallicum and Rhizobium mongolense. The DNA-DNA homologies were lower than 42.4 % among cluster 9 and defined species, including R. gallicum and R. mongolense. These data indicated that cluster 9 was a unique genomic species. Isolates within this cluster could share their host plants. They could not nodulate Galega orientalis and Leucaena leucocephala and formed ineffective nodules on Phaseolus vulgaris. This group could also be differentiated from defined species by phenotypic characteristics. It is therefore proposed as a new species, Rhizobium yanglingense, with isolate CCBAU 71623 as the type strain.

AB  - A study was conducted during 1994-96 at Bijapur on the effect of in-situ moisture conservation practices and integrated use of organic and inorganic sources of nutrients on crop yield and soil properties. Compartmental bunding and ridges and furrows increased the grain yield by 22.8 and 25.6 % respectively, mainly owing to reduction in runoff, soil loss and increased availability of moisture and nutrients, viz N, P and K. Higher availability of nutrients in the top soil (0-15 cm depth) compared to sub soil (15-30 cm depth) was due to application of nutrients and higher rate of mineralisation. Among different sources of organics, application of white popinac (Leucaena leucocephala Lam.) proved superior over farmyard manure and vermicompost due to higher moisture conservation and faster rate of mineralisation and higher nutrient availability. Increase in N dose up to 50 kg/ha increased the availability of nutrients and their uptake resulted in improved crop growth and grain yield over 25 kg/ha and control.

AB  - Topsoil (0-15 cm) bulk density, aggregate stability, soil dispersibility, water retention and infiltration were measured between 1989 and 1996 on an Alfisol under rehabilitation in southwestern Nigeria. The planted leguminous species were Pueraria phaseoloides, Senna siamea, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia leptocarpa and A. auriculiformis. Also, plots with natural fallow and maize/cassava intercropping were included. Level (minimum) and mound tillage with hoes was adopted for the cultivated areas under study after 4 and 6 year fallow periods. Under fallow, the soil bulk density decreased from 1.56 to 1.11 t m-3. The continuously cropped treatment (level tillage) had significantly higher bulk density than the fallowed subplots after 6 years. Mean soil penetrometer resistance ranged from 75 to 157 kPa for fallowed plots and from 192 to 295 kPa for the continuously cropped (level tillage) subplot. Surface soil water contents were similar for all the treatments during the soil strength measurements. Although soil aggregates were generally of low stability and not well formed, they were improved by fallowing. Soil structural improvement by planted fallows was similar to that by natural fallow, but the trees were more promising for long-term fallow (>6 years) than the herbaceous R phaseoloides. However, the improvement in soil structure after 4 or 6 year fallow could not be maintained in subsequent cropping. Furthermore, the significant improvement in soil bulk density caused by A. auriculiformis and natural fallow was more rapidly lost on the cultivated subplots compared with other fallow treatments. Thus, soil structure recovery under a fallow does not imply a sustained improvement when stress is applied to this soil. Post-fallow soil management options such as residue incorporation and tillage to ameliorate compaction or soil strength will be necessary to enhance the improvements by fallow species.

PY  - 1999

AB  - Although N-rich leaf biomass of multipurpose trees is known to be a good source of N to crops, integrating such trees into crop production systems is a major challenge in the development of viable agroforestry systems. An approach to integrating calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit), two promising agroforestry tree species, into maize (Zea mays L.) production system was investigated in the subhumid highlands of central Kenya during four maize-growing seasons from 1994 to 1996. The experiment consisted of maize plots to which tree prunings obtained from hedgerows grown either in situ (alley cropping) or ex situ (biomass transfer from outside) were applied. When alley-cropped with leucaena, maize produced significantly higher yields compared to maize monoculture (both non-fertilized and fertilized) treatments, but when alley-cropped with calliandra, the yield of maize was less than that of the monocropped unfertilized control. Application of ex situ grown calliandra and leucaena prunings with or without fertilizer resulted in higher maize grain yield than in the nonfertilized and fertilized treatments. Yields of calliandra alley-cropped maize were 11% to 51% lower than those of nonalley-cropped treatments receiving calliandra prunings from ex situ grown trees; the decrease was 2% to 17% with leucaena, indicating that calliandra hedges were more competitive than leucaena hedges. The alley-cropped prunings-removed treatments produced the lowest maize yields. The study showed that, in the subhumid tropical highlands of Kenya, inclusion of calliandra hedges on cropland adversely affected maize yields. On the other hand, alley cropping with leucaena was advantageous.

AB  - A galactopinitol (Galpi), O-α-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→1)-3-O- methyl-D-chiro-inositol, together with sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose were extracted from seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and characterized for glass formation and phospholipid vesicle stabilization during dehydration. Raffinose, stachyose, and Galpi were found to have good glass forming properties, and their glass transition temperatures (Tgs) were 67.4, 66.4, and 33.40 °C, respectively. The Tgs were much higher than those of glucose and sucrose. The Tg for a mass ratio mixture of Galpi and sucrose of 0.3/1 was greater than 0 and was similar to that of the same ratio mixture of raffinose to sucrose, indicating that Galpi as well as oligosaccharides plays an important role in glass formation. The mixture of Galpi plus sucrose appeared to protect phospholipid vesicles during dehydration and rehydration to the same degree as did raffinose or the stachyose plus sucrose mixture. The percent protection (leakage of isocitrate) of vesicles provided by sucrose, Galpi, raffinose, and stachyose was in the approximate range of 38 to 48%. The results suggest that Galpi may prevent cellular collapse during the desiccation of leucaena seeds and function much the same as oligosaccharides.

AB  - The in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD) and of nitrogen (IVND) was measured on six leguminous tropical shrubs and the grass Panicum maximum, in the presence and absence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000. The PEG was spiked with 14C-labelled PEG 4000 so that PEG remaining in the residues after digestion could be calculated. This was subtracted from the residues to enable a corrected IVDMD (CIVDMD) to be calculated. The plant samples were also mixed with labelled PEG in a buffer medium for 24 h, and the remaining PEG in the supernatant measured to estimate the PEG bound to the sample. PEG binding was then related to IVND and to the difference between the IVND of the samples measured with and without PEG. In the absence of PEG, the ranking of the species for IVDMD was: Gliricidia sepium>Panicum maximum>Leucaena leucocephala>L. trichandra>L. pallida>Calliandra calothyrsus>Acacia boliviana. PEG increased IVDMD for A. boliviana, decreased it for L. pallida and had no effect on the other species (p>0.05). The CIVDMD values for the legumes were all higher with + PEG by a mean of 8.6% units, though the species ranking remained the same. IVND varied from 82% for G. sepium to 49% for C. calothyrsus in the absence of PEG. The rankings were similar to those for IVDMD. PEG increased the IVND of all species except the grass and reduced the range from 86.6% with G. sepium to 75.5% with P. maximum. There are no condensed tannins in P maximum and so PEG had no effect on IVDMD or IVND. PEG binding of the legume species in mg/g DM (x) was negatively related to IVND% (y) in the absence of PEG: y=92.3-0.322x; r2=0.941, and to the IVN difference between the + and - PEG treatments (y): y=-7.5+0.303x; r2=0.923. The results show that the tannins in these shrub species can have a large effect on IVDMD and an even larger effect on IVND, consequently the potential value of A. boliviana and C. calothyrsus for improving animal production should be questioned. The digestibility of the psyllid-tolerant L. pallida and L. trichandra was also shown to be lower than that of the proven high quality but psyllid susceptible L. leucocephala.

Extracts at 20% (w/v) concentration were used in greenhouse on soil and germitest paper, and on filter paper under laboratory conditions. Results indicated that extract obtained with cold water (EC) when applied in soil had no phytotoxic effect on germination and plant growth. Extraction with hot water (EH) caused reduction in root length, but had no effect on maize seeds germination. The root length was more efficient as a sensitive indicator to EH than germination.

AB  - There are abundant local legume trees and shrubs potentially suitable for alley cropping systems in the sub-Saharan Africa, which are yet to be studied. The nitrogen contribution of two years old Albizia lebbeck and S. corymbosa to yield of maize grown in alley cropping was compared to that of Senna siamea, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala in four seasons at Ibadan. Maize shoot biomass and maize grain yield in A. lebbeck alley compared favourably with that in G. sepium and L. leucocephala. Maize biomass and grain yield in S. corymbosa alleys were the lowest. Within A. lebbeck, L. leucocpehala, and G. sepium alleys there were no significant differences in the maize yield in the alleys that received 0, 40 or 80 kg N/ha. Application of more than 40 kg N/ha in S. corymbosa alleys was not necessary as there was no significant increase in maize yield at the higher level of nitrogen. Maize yield and N uptake in A. lebbeck alleys were not significantly different from yield and N uptake in G. sepium, and L. leucocephala at the same fertilizer level. There was a significant correlation between hedgerow tree biomass and maize grain yield. At the end of twelve weeks after pruning application, the organic residues of the pruning applied in the alleys ranged from 5% in G. sepium and 44% in A. lebbeck in the first year compared with the original pruning applied which showed that the slow rate of A. lebbeck decomposition could have a beneficial effect on the soil. The maize N recovery from applied N fertilizer was low (10-22%). Percentage N recovery from the prunings was low in the non-N fixing trees (12-22%), while the recovery was high (49-59%) in A. lebbeck as well as in the other nitrogen fixing tree prunings. Thus A. lebbeck, apart from enhancing maize growth and grain yield like in L. leucocephala and G. sepium, had an added advantage because it remained longer as mulching material on the soil because of its slow rate of decomposition. It was able to survive pruning frequencies with no die-back. This indicates that A. lebbeck is a good potential candidate for alley cropping system in West Africa. S. corymbosa performed poorly compared with the other legume trees. Though it responded to N fertilizer showing a positive interaction between the hedgerow and fertilizer application, it had a high die back rate following pruning periods and termite attack.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted during the rainy season of 1993-94 to 1995-96 at Jhansi, to study the different food-fodder cropping systems and manurial schedules under rainfed conditions. Significantly higher grain and stover yields of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] were obtained in sorghum + pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] intercropping system as compared with other intercropping systems. Sorghum + cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] intercropping gave significantly more green fodder and dry-matter yields and sorghum grain-equivalent yield than the other intercropping systems. Among the different manurial schedules, combined application of organic and inorganic sources of plant nutrients resulted in significantly higher grain and stover yields of sorghum, green fodder and dry-matter yields of fodder crops and sorghum grain-equivalent yield as compared to 100% through inorganic fertilizers application.

The results revealed that amending fly-ash with press mud enhanced plant growth as well as other physiological responses such as chlorophyll, protein, in vivo nitrate reductase activity compared to 100% fly-ash treated plants. The elements Fe, Zn, Cu and Mn accumulated in larger quantities in plants grown in 100% fly-ash, and followed the order of accumulation Fe > Zn > Cu > Mn.

AB  - In 1994 and 1995 leaves from 10 selected West African trees and shrubs with varying tannin content were tested to determine their suitability as an alternative and supplementary browse feed for West African dwarf sheep to improve productivity in small-scale holdings in Benin. Dry matter intake per kg metabolic body weight (DM g/kg W0.75) varied between the different browse feeds and between the different trials and ranged from zero (Leucaena leucocephala) up to 26.7 DM g/kg W0.75 (Margaritaria discoidea). The digestibility of the organic matter varied between 58.9% (L. leucocephala) and 68.2% (Mallotus oppositifolius). Agelaea obliqua showed the highest levels of total phenols (10.2%), tannin phenols (8.8%) and extractable condensed tannins (8.0%). Leaves from various browse feeds are a good and protein-rich supplementary fodder in addition to the grass Panicum maximum. However, feeding of A. obliqua and Cnestis ferruginea should be avoided due to toxic components.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of feeding alfalfa and pods of tree legumes on rumen pH and ammonia concentration as well as in sacco degradability of dry matter and fibre constituents of maize stover, alfalfa hay and their neutral detergent extracts. The feeds were incubated in the rumens of five South African Merino sheep fed individually in an incomplete (5 × 4) Latin square design using five diets. The diets comprised equal proportions of pasture hay and either alfalfa (Alfalfa diet) or pods of Acacia sieberiana (Sieberiana diet), Acacia nilotica (Nilotica diet) or Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena diet). The fifth diet was composed of pasture hay alone (Hay diet) and served as a negative control. Supplementation of hay with either legume pods or alfalfa significantly (p <0.05) increased rumen ammonia concentration from 56 to a maximum of 86mg 1-1. The pH of the rumen fluid ranged between 6.2 and 6.5 for all diets, but variations in pH were not significant. Diet did not affect (p >0.05) the degradability constants lag time (LT), slowly degradable fraction (B), potential degradability (PD), effective degradability (ED) and rate of degradation (C) of dry matter (DM) but significantly (p <0.01) affected ED of the fibre constituents of the incubated feeds. The effective degradabilities of the incubated feeds differed (p <0.001), with alfalfa and maize stover having average values of 555 and 318 g kg-1 DM respectively. The rate of degradation of alfalfa was also higher (p <0.01) than that of maize stover. Neutral detergent extraction improved ED of the cell wall constituents of maize stover but produced the opposite effect for alfalfa. The interactions between incubation feed and extract were significant (p <0.01) for ED and C of neutral detergent fibre and hemicellulose. The observations show that pods from tree legumes are comparable to alfalfa in the provision of rumen ammonia but limit microbial activity in the degradability of fibre constituents. They also show that maize stover and alfalfa differ in their degradabilities and that the differences may be attributed to their cell wall chemistry. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In situ rumen degradability of organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and cell contents (CQ of four forages: grass hay, ammonia treated rice straw, red clover and Leucaena leucocephala leaf were determined using three rumen fistulated sheep. The rumen degradability of the forage components was fitted to a first-order model, and the rumen degradation ratio between two components was estimated within the forages. An asynchrony status of rumen degradation through the incubation was detected between CP and OM for grass hay and red clover, and between CC and NDF for grass hay. The change in CP degradation rate was greater than that in OM for grass hay and red clover, and the change in CC degradation rate was lower than that in NDF for grass hay. It was possible to assess the relationship of rumen degradation of forage components using the in site parameters.

AB  - The experiment was conducted to evaluate the ruminal pH and ammonia concentration (N-NH 3) in rumen liquor collected at 3, 6 and 12 hours after feeding using four ruminal fistulated European x Zebu steers. The forage leaves: stems ratio and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber in situ ruminal degradability of the leaflets from three tropical legumes (leucaena, Leucaena leucocephala; pigeon pea, Cajanus cajan; and glycine, Neonotonia wightii) and leaves from two others tropical forages (ramie, Boehmeria nivea and cassava, Manihot esculenta) were also studied. Samples of 3 g (pigeon pea, glycine and ramic) or 5 g (leucaena and cassava) of the material were incubated in the rumen of the animals for periods of 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 hours. A split-plot design was used, in which plots were the forages and split plots were the six periods of ruminal incubation of the material, and the four animals were considered blocks. Ruminal pH and N-NH 3 values probably allowed an adequate mìrobial fermentation. Forage leaves:stems ratio was variable among them and comparing to the literature. The forages NDF effective degradabilities (ED) were around 50%, being lower for pigeon pea leaflets (19.25%), which also demonstrated the lowest degradation rate (2.5%/h) and potential degradability (57.76%). ED values for NDF were negatively correlated to forages acid detergent insoluble nitrogen contents (r = -0.986). Pigeon pea was the worst forage concerning to the use of structural components.

AB  - The use of agroforestry systems in which pruning from trees is used to mulch the companion crops is an important area of research in the tropics. However, previous studies mostly evaluated the contribution of mulch to soil improvement and rarely examined the effect of mulch on weeds. Field experiments were conducted during the 1995 and 1996 growing seasons to investigate the effects of mulch from three woody fallow species on weed composition, biomass and maize grain yield. Treatments consisted of mulch from Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, and Senna siamea applied at rates of five and three tons dry matter ha-1 at planting and three weeks after planting (WAP), respectively, an unmulched treatment that received 90 kg N ha-1 of inorganic fertiliser, and an unmulched control plot that received no fertiliser. In both years and sampling dates, plots mulched with G. sepium and S. siamea had significantly lower weed density and biomass than the control plot in each of the sampling times and year of study. There was no significant difference in either weed density or biomass between the plot mulched with L. leucocephala and the unmulched plots. Mulches from G. sepium and S. siamea reduced weed density and weed biomass, while L. leucocephala was less effective in reducing weed biomass and weed density. Weed reduction by the mulches was in the order G. sepium ≥ S. siamea > L. leucocephala. Sedges were the dominant species in all the treatments except in G. sepium plots, where Talinum triangulare and other broadleaved species were dominant.

AB  - A five year field experiment was conducted to obtain information which will facilitate the scientific development of tree mixtures in an agroforestry system with two fruit trees, mango (Mangifera indica L.) and sapota (Achrus sapota L.) and three fast growing forest trees eucalyptus (Eucalyptus tereticornis L.), casuarina (Casuarina equisetifolia J.R. & G. Forst) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit). Observations on biometrics and edaphic parameters were recorded. The results revealed that growth of sapota can be enhanced by 17% when grown in mixture with leucaena while co-planting of casuarina had no influence on sapota. A reduction of 12% in the growth of mango was observed when co-planted with casuarina or leucaena. Eucalyptus was incompatible with mango and sapota, which were suppressed by the former. The present investigation identified two tree mixtures sapota + leucaena and sapota + casuarina for raising in tropical alfisol for a sustainable income. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The experiment was carried out to evaluate the use of Leucaena leucocephala and Cajanus cajan as protein sources, during the dry season for lambs grazing on buffel grass pastures. Nine experimental treatments resulting from the combination among three types of pasture (buffel grass, buffel grass+Cajanus cajan, and buffel grass+leucaena) and three stocking rates (4, 6 and 10 lambs/ ha) were tested. Eighteen paddocks (two replicates of pastures per treatment) of 0.5 ha were used. Sixty lambs with 19.4 kg live weight at the beginning of the experiment were allocated to pastures with water and mineral supplement offered ad libitum. Animal liveweight was recorded at 14 day-intervals after 16 hours of fasting. Lambs on the pasture of buffel grass+leucaena showed good performance with no variation in daily liveweight gain rate, when the stocking rate increased from 4 to 6 animals/ha. Buffel grass+Cajanus cajan pasture did not improve animal performance as compared to buffel grass pasture. It was concluded that leucaena, used as protein supplement, can improve the quality of buffel grass pastures.

AB  - A modified two stage in vitro digestion method was used to study the effects of rate of PEG addition (0-1100 mg/g DM) on dry matter (IVDMD) and nitrogen digestibility (IVND) of freeze dried leaf material from actively growing shoots of Calliandra calothyrsus (Calliandra) and Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham (Leucaena). For both species, IVDMD and IVND increased asymptotically with PEG rate; the IVND response being markedly greater for Calliandra. There was a three-fold greater amount of PEG bound to the residue after Stage 1 (rumen fluid/buffer) digestion with Calliandra than with Leucaena (105 versus 33 mg/g DM). The presence of PEG in the residue, which was not reduced after Stage 2 (acid-pepsin) digestion, resulted in a higher residue weight and therefore an underestimated IVDMD. Quantification of the PEG in the residue enabled a corrected IVDMD (CIVDMD) to be estimated. PEG did not bias estimates of nitrogen digestibility in the same way. In a second experiment, estimates of CIVDMD and IVND were made after Stage 1 and after Stage 2 in the presence and absence of PEG at 160 mg/g sample. For Leucaena, there were small, but significant, effects of PEG, whereas with Calliandra there were large responses to PEG and to timing of addition. When measured after Stage 1, IVND in the absence of PEG was not significantly different to zero (compared with 57% for Leucaena), whereas with PEG, IVND was 75% (compared with 68% for Leucaena). The low IVND for Calliandra was associated with low NH4 N levels in the rumen fluid/buffer after Stage 1. In summary, about 160 mg PEG/g sample is appropriate for most studies with tropical tanniniferous shrub legumes to estimate any deleterious tannin effect. The use of PEG to estimate this effect on IVDMD is not valid without accounting for the PEG bound to the residue. For estimation of the adverse effect of tannins on IVND the use of PEG may be more appropriate. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - One approach to predicting non-target attack by potential biological control agents is to first describe their fundamental host ranges and then to predict how it will be expressed under post-release field conditions. In this paper, we illustrate how the fundamental host range can be estimated experimentally by excluding possible limiting factors such as time-dependent effects. The example we use is a host-specificity study of a leaf-tying moth (Gelechiidae: Evippe sp. 1) which was being assessed for the biological control of mesquite (Leguminosae: Prosopis spp.) in Australia. Females oviposited all eggs on plants, mostly into cracks and fissures. First instar larvae leaf-mined and subsequent instars leaf-tied. Oviposition was not host-specific in cage trials, although ten times more eggs were laid on Prosopis than on non-targets. The fundamental host range for initiation of larval feeding was restricted to Prosopis and Leucaena leucocephala which both belong to the same tribe, and the fundamental host range for complete larval development was restricted to Prosopis. We predict that if released in Australia Evippe sp. 1 will only attack Prosopis spp., although low levels of 'indiscriminate' oviposition might occur on other taxa, and might result in initiation of feeding on L. leucocephala.

AB  - Foliage from 15 shrub species was used to estimate the extent and rate of cell wall (CW) degradation in the rumen of fistulated Pelibuey sheep. Branches from the browse species: Acacia berlandieri, Acacia farnesiana, Acacia greggii, Acacia rigidula, Celtis pallida, Cercidium macrum, Condalia obovata, Cordia boisieri, Desmanthus virgathus, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucophyllum texanum, Opuntia lindehimieri, Porlieria angustifolia, Prosopis glandulosa, and Ziziphus obtusifolia, were collected during the spring of 1993 in Marin, County, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Medicago sativa hay was used for comparison. Twelve ruminally cannulated male sheep (45 kg BW) were used (four sheep per plant) to incubate nylon bags (5 x 10 cm and 53 μm pore size); containing 4 g of ground material (1 mm screen) of each plant. Bags were incubated at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h. The rate of CW degradation (c, %) was highest (P < 0.001) in O. lindehimieri (9.8) and lowest in A. rigidula (2.8). Only O. lindehimieri and C. pallida (8.5) had higher CW degradation rates than M. sativa (7.1). Effective degradability of CW (EDCW), at outflow rates of 2%, 5% and 8% h-1 values were higher in C. pallida (74.3, 62.9 and 56.6), C. obovata (54.5, 45.8 and 39.7), L. leucocephala (54.7, 45.1 and 39.8) and O. lindehimieri (67.8, 56.6 and 50.6) than in M. sativa (54.1, 44.9 and 39.5). High levels of lignin and condensed tannins affected the EDCW in some plants. Species such as C. pallida, C. obovata, L. Leucocephala and O. lindehimieri may be considered as good available forages for grazing ruminants in northern Mexico. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Mimosine content was determined monthly for a year for leucaena cv. Cunningham and four shrubby types. There was a significant negative correlation between rainfall and mimosine content. It appears that more leucaeana could be used as feed in the rainy months, and leaves could be harvested then and stored for dry season feeding.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) and Gliricidia sepium (Gliricidia) supplementation on nitrogen balance and urinary purine derivative (PD) excretions of sheep fed ammoniated rice straw (ARS). Three cannulated wethers were used and were fed ad libitum with ARS alone or ARS supplemented with 200 g of either Leucaena or Gliricidia. Supplementation increased total nitrogen (N) intake (p < 0.05), subsequently resulting in improved N utilization. Nitrogen balance revealed that absorbed and retained N was significantly higher in the 2 supplemented groups. The higher total urinary PD excretions in the Leucaena and Gliricidia fed group indicated a higher microbial N supply compared with the ARS only group. In conclusion the added N from Leucaena and Gliricidia improved N utilization and microbial nitrogen supply in sheep receiving ARS diets, and N from Gliricidia could elicit similar effect as that from Leucaena.

AB  - Germination techniques and growth of eight multipurpose tree species native of the Gulf Coast Plain in northeastern Mexico were studied. Three techniques were utilized to break seed dormancy and accelerate germination. The best results were obtained by immersion in warm water and concentrated sulphuric acid for 10 to 20 min according to the species. Measurements of various growth parameters of trees over the first ten years were evaluated. Acacia farnesiana, Leucaena leucocephala performed best while Prosopis glandulosa and Condalia hookeri did not establish well due to biotic problems which arose under plantation conditions. Acacia farnesiana, Parkinsonia aculeata and Pithecellobium ebano showed high yields which is of great interest since their multipurpose potential is the best of the eight species.

AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementing different levels of Leucaena leucocephala leaves on reproductive capacity and growth of male highland sheep (Arsi type) in Debre Zeit Research Centre. Animals were randomly allotted to one of five experimental rations. In treatment 1 (NS) animals were allowed to feed only on chickpea haulm. Treatments 2 (L100), 3 (L200) and 4 (L300) consisted of 100, 200 and 300 g/head per day of sun dried leucaena leaf hay, while animals in treatment 5 (C300) received 300 g/head per day of concentrate mixture. The basal diet, chickpea haulm, was offered ad libitum to all groups. Leucaena supplementation significantly increased total DM intake without marked effect on intake of the basal diet. Live weight of sheep was found to have increased by 68, 88, 94 and 74% as a result of supplementation of 100, 200 and 300 g/head per day of sun dried leucaena leaves and 300 g/head/day of concentrate mixture, respectively. Epididymal growth was retarded in animals maintained solely on chickpea haulm and improved with supplementation. Similar effects were noted in all the epididymal components of both the left and right testes. The scrotal circumference of non-supplemented sheep has been reduced by about 10% while addition of leucaena to the diet increased testicular size by 20-24%. The diameters of the left and right testes were also affected positive by supplementation. It was concluded that supplementation of up to 300 g/head per day of leucaena leaf hay improved body weight gain of sheep with concurrent increases in testicular and epididymal sizes without resulting in clinical symptoms of toxicity.

AB  - In order to ascertain the influence of supplemental iodine on nutrient utilisation by goats fed a leucaena leucocephala leaf meal containing diet, 8 adult male goats (2 years; 22.3 ± 1.73 kg) were randomly allocated into two groups, viz. control and experimental. Both the groups were fed a diet comprising of wheat bran, leucaena leaf meal and wheat straw ad lib. In addition, the experimental animals were given extra iodine at 0.04 mg/head/day (as KI soln.). A metabolism trial of 6 days duration conducted after 13 weeks of experimental feeding revealed that the daily DM intake (g/W0.75) increased significantly due to iodine supplementation. Similar was the case with the intakes of DCP and ME. The digestibility of CP and EE showed significant improvement in the experimental group while that of DM, OM and total carbohydrates did not vary significantly between the two groups. The animals of control group were in negative nitrogen balance, which improved significantly and become positive in the experimental group. Moreover, the control animals lose weight apparently in contrast to the experimental animals, who maintained their weights. While iodine supplementation tended to enhance phosphorus retention that of calcium exhibited significant improvement. Conclusively, provision of extra iodine to Leucaena containing diet may prove beneficial in augmenting the nutrient utilization of this protein rich tropical forage.

AB  - We show here that seed reserves in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. and Zea mays L. (maize) are important for mycorrhizal formation and seedling growth. Seed reserve removal reduced mycorrhizal formation markedly in Leucaena but not in maize, except at 15 and 45 days after seed reserve removal. Partial or total removal of seed reserves decreased plant growth and tissue nutrient concentrations in both hosts. Nodule number in Leucaena, which was related positively to plant biomass and mycorrhizal infection levels, was reduced when one or both cotyledons were severed. Leucaena seedlings without or with partial seed reserves had higher nutrient use efficiencies throughout seedling growth. But such an effect was observed only initially in maize. Seed reserve removal increased the specific absorption rates of nutrients in both hosts. Phosphorus absorption rate was significantly and positively related to root infection levels in both Leuceana and maize. Though the growth rates of plants without seed reserves were low initially, these plants had higher growth rates during later stages. We conclude that seed reserves are not only important for seedling growth, but also for mycorrhizal formation and nodulation.

AB  - In a long-term study (1980 to 1993), the survival, growth performance and biomass production of two grass species viz. Chrysopogon fulvus (Spreng.) Chiov. and Eulaliopsis binata (Retz.) C.E. Hubb. were assessed when intercropped with four tree species viz. Albizia lebbek (L.) Benth., Grewia optiva Drumm., Bauhinia purpurea L. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit. on the bouldery riverbed lands of Doon Valley of north-west India. The survival of grass clumps was higher under the canopy of B. purpurea (48.3% in 1993 of the initial planting density of 20,000 clumps ha-1 in 1980) and G. optiva (47.4%) than of L. leucocephala (31.1%) and A. lebbek (29.4%), and at 75% intensity of tree lopping (40.9%) than at 50% (37.1%). The effect of tree species on different growth parameters of grasses was not uniform, with G. optiva and B. purpurea causing comparatively more synergistic effect on clump height and clump diameter respectively. Although the performance of grasses was good under A. lebbek and L. leucocephala in the early years (1980-1987), these tree species resulted in the lowest grass dry weight in the later years up to 1993. The beneficial effect of higher lopping intensity of 75% was observed on the growth and biomass production of grasses over 50% lopping, presumably due to increased light penetration into the under-storey. The biomass production of grasses reached a maximum at four years of growth in 1983, after which, it decreased gradually to less than half in 1993. Eulaliopsis binata showed higher survival, growth and biomass production than C. fulvus throughout the period of study. The total biomass production was highest in association with B. purpurea followed by G. optiva, which appeared to be the most suitable tree species along with E. binata for sustainable silvopasture development on the marginal lands of Doon Valley of north-west India.

AB  - Four groups of three Holstein-Friesian cows were supplemented with 1.5 kg of air-dried tree fodder of Acacia boliviana, Calliandra calothyrsus or Leucaena leucocephala, or 1.5 kg Rhodes grass hay as a control, mixed with 5 g of a commercial polyethylene glycol (PEG)-containing digestive modifier (Browse Plus). Cows on all treatments were fed a basal diet of maize silage, cottonseed cake and crushed maize grain, and had ad lib access to Rhodes grass hay from noon. A 2-week adaptation period was followed by a 2-week response period. Refusals of C. calothyrsus and grass hay were initially 12% and 32%, respectively, but their intake improved with time, and at the start of the response period practically all of the 1.5 kg was consumed for all the fodders. The highest milk yield of 13.19 kg day-1 was produced by cows receiving L. leucocephala (p < 0.001). Cows receiving A. boliviana produced 11.94 kg day-1, 0.58 kg day-1 more than with the grass hay control diet, but C. calothyrsus had no beneficial effect. Although L. leucocephala was judged not to be superior to the other tree fodders nutritionally with respect to protein and fibre content, its in vitro organic matter degradability (OMD) was higher, as was its 96 h gas production volume (p < 0.001). Despite being fed with PEG, it was concluded that anti-nutritional factors were operative with A. boliviana and C. calothyrsus. Amongst the tree forages, L. leucocephala had the lowest, and C. calothyrsus the highest, content of soluble polyphenolics and fibre-bound proanthocyanidins (PAs) (p < 0.001), though the former was still substantial in L. leucocephala, with the reverse occurring for OMD (p < 0.01). Soluble PA content and protein precipitating capacity were highest in A. boliviana (p < 0.001). There were strong negative relationships for both OMD and milk yield with tree fodder soluble phenolic and fibre-bound PA contents (r-values: OMD -0.88** and -0.96*** milk yield -0.96*** and -0.99*** respectively). The potential for use of C. calothyrsus conserved as hay is very limited, for A. boliviana only moderate, while for L. leucocephala it is apparently good.

AB  - Seventy seedlots of Leucaena leucocephala, L. pallida, L. diversifolia, L. retusa, L. esculenta, L. confertifolia, L. greggii and L. pulverulenta and various hybrid combinations were examined for survival to freezing weather, biomass production, leaf protein content and in vitro dry matter digestibility in Texas. Three sites along a 600 km north-south transect were chosen to provide a wide range in exposure to freezing weather. The minimum temperature on the warmer Three Rivers site was -7 °C while the minimum temperatures on the colder Vernon site was -14 °C. At the Three Rivers site where -7 °C temperatures occurred and where forage production was a priority and some winter frost damage was not a problem, L. leucocephala K636 and hybrids containing L. diversifolia and L. pallida have the most promise. If total lack of damage to -7 °C is essential, species such as L. retusa, L. pulverulenta (seedlot 61, 62) and hybrids such as L. retusa X L. greggii (53) and L. retusa x L. pulverulenta (55) have the greatest potential. This study examined only one family from each of the cold-hardy species as a parent in the promising hybrids. As extensive intraspecific genetic variation is present within these leucaena species there is great potential to find hybrids with much better combinations of cold hardiness, forage production, leaf protein and dry matter digestibility.

AB  - Samples of leaves from ten tropical species: six trees (Acacia mangium, Acacia auriculiformis, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Indigofera teysamii, Jackfruit - Artocarpus heterophyllus), three crop plants (Cassava - Manihot esculenta, sugar cane - Saccharum officinarum, banana - Musacea) and a crop residue (Rice straw - Oryza sativa) were put in nylon bags and the losses of dry matter were estimated for washing times of 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes in a commercial semi-automatic washing machine, and incubation times of 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours in the rumen of a cow fed rice straw and fresh grass (Panicum maximum). The relationships between losses of dry matter in the washing machine and time of washing were curvilinear (range of R2 from 0.86 to 0.99) for all leaves except those from banana and Acacia auriculiformis where the relationship was linear (R2=0.99). There were close relationships between in sacco dry matter loss after 48 hours incubation and dry matter losses by washing (R2=0.73, 0.80, 0.86 and 0.80 for washing times of 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes [average values for all samples at each time were used in this analysis]). Selecting the 90 minute washing time and correlating the data obtained with this method (range 15-47% for the ten species) with those from the 48 hour in sacco dry matter loss (range 25-61%) gave an R2 of 0.86. The two methods ranked the species similarly and were considered to be equally effective in rating the chosen materials as potential sources of digestible dry matter for both ruminant and monogastric livestock. The use of the washing loss method is recommended as a first approximation to estimation of nutritive value as it is simple, rapid, and low cost, and dispenses with the need for surgically modified animals.

AB  - Environmental impact of Eucalyptus tereticornis-globulus (Eucalyptus hybrid) plantation on the undergrowth diversity, soil moisture, soil nutrients and soil organic carbon, and on wildlife has been assessed. Qualitative as well as computer-aided quantitative studies gave clear indication that the ecological impacts of Eucalyptus hybrid plantation in terms of undergrowth diversity easily matches with the performance of Acacia auriculiformis or Leucaena leucocephala monocultures and polycultures. In other aspects as well these are no different from the impacts of mono or polycultures of Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia auriculiformis, Dalbergia sissoo, and so. The authors conclude that most of the adverse environmental impacts generally alleged against Eucalypts have not been seen.

AB  - A non-destructive method is required for estimating the forage yield of small stands of Leucaena leucocephala. Non-linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between the height of leucaena trees and wood and edible dry matter (edm) yield, and the relation between the diameter (at the point of browsing) of browsed leucaena twigs (DPB) and twig mass. Exponential regression (y = a + brx) of the logged biomass data provided the most accurate and precise description of the tree height-biomass and DPB-biomass relationships. More than 75% of the variation in wood and total tree yield was accounted for by the regressions on tree height, at an accuracy of within 8% of the true mean. The regression for edm on height was poor (r2 = 0.57) and was not improved substantially by including the number of basal stems as a predictor. The amount of leaf and stem material removed by browsers can be precisely (r2 > 0.90) and accurately (within 11% of the mean) predicted from DPB, thus providing a simple means of estimating browse offtake from leucaena trees. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Effects of changes in temperature around roots on water uptake by roots and leaf transpiration were studied in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit., a subtropical woody plant species, and in Zea mays L. When the temperature around roots was rapidly lowered from 25 °C to 15 °C, the water uptake by the roots and leaf transpiration were stimulated significantly within a short period (14 min). However, this effect did not occur when the cooling time was prolonged neither did if occur when the temperature around the roots was resumed from 15 °C to 25 °C. Both the hydraulic conductivity of roots and leaf transpiration were increased substantially at first (within 20 min) and then decreased steadily to a level lower than those of the control in which the roots were continuous exposed to a low temperature (15 °C). Low temperature also promoted the biosynthesis of ABA in roots and enhanced the xylem ABA concentration, but such stimulation did not occur untill about 30 min after cooling treatment. Leaf transpiration was reduced markedly, but the hydraulic conductivity of roots increased when the root system was treated with exogenous ABA. It was suggested that some mechanisms other than ABA may be involved in the short-time cryo-stimulation of water uptake by roots and leaf transpiration.

AB  - A trial was carried out in a feedlot of cross-bred cattle localized in a dry forest tropical zone, with an average precipitation of 600 mm/year and an average annual temperature of 28°C, to evaluate the effect of storage (8, 30 and 60 days) on the intake and fragility of nutritional blocks with different levels of ingredients. Two (2) levels of molasses (30 and 40%) and three (3) levels of limestone (5, 7.5 and 10%) were used with different levels (5, 7.5, 10, 15, 17.5 and 20%) of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) hay. The intake of nutritional blocks was different (P < 0.05) for all the treatments (67, 16, 23, 53, 32 and 21 g/100 kg live weight/day, for the treatments with 30:5:20, 30:7.5:17.5, 30:10:15, 40:5:10, 40:7.5:7.5 and 40:10:5% of molasses - limestone - hay, respectively). Being higher in the first and fourth treatments. Also the storage affected the consumption (P < 0.01) with values of 54, 17 and 35 g/100 kg LW/day, to 8, 30 and 60 days, respectively. It was higher in the first period of storage and lower at 30 and 60 days, due to an increase in the hardness.

AB  - Thirty Angora (16±2 kg) and 20 Spanish (19±2 kg) 8-month-old doelings, having not previously consumed Leucaena leucocephala, were used to determine effects of dietary inclusion of a moderate level of Leucaena on fleece shedding and subsequent fibre characteristics. A diet of 22.5% Leucaena leaf meal (0.17% mimosine in total diet dry matter) was consumed ad libitum for 8 days starting on November 13, with daily mimosine intake in the first 3 d averaging 56 mg/kg body weight. At d 10, fleece shedding was clearly visible in 17 of the 30 Angora doelings and in 9 of the 20 Spanish doelings. Doelings in which the visual shedding score was above 2 (5-point scale: 1 = no shedding and 5 = excessive shedding; mean of cashmere and guard shedding scores for Spanish doelings) on d 19 were categorized as exhibiting a shedding response to Leucaena. By d 35, six Angora and three Spanish doelings had completely shed fleece. Clean mohair growth rate in Angora doelings was lower (P<0.05) for shedding vs nonshedding doelings on d 8 to 40 (0.29 vs 0.68 mg/ (cm2 d-1)) but similar (P>0.10) between shedding groups on d 41 to 63 (1.51 vs 1.46 mg/(cm2 d-1)), although cashmere growth rate was not different (P>0.10) between shedding groups on either d 8 to 40 or d 41 to 63. Secondary follicle activity was lower (P<0.05) on d 8 for shedding than for non-shedding Angora doelings (89 vs 99%), but activity on d 63 was similar (95 and 96%, respectively). Secondary follicle activity for Spanish does was similar between shedding groups on d 8 and 63 (P>0.10). In conclusion, feeding of Leucaena holds promise as a means of inducing fleece shedding in goats, apparently without marked subsequent effects on productivity. However, further research with higher dietary levels of mimosine is necessary.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted at the Coconut Research Institute, Sri Lanka to examine the N2-fixing potential of Gliricidia sepiuin and Leucaena leucocephala and transfer of fixed N to Setaria sphacelata van splendida in tree legume-grass mixtures using the 15N isotope dilution method. A non-N2-fixing tree legume, Senna siamea, was used as the reference plant. Gliricidia, leucaena and senna were monocropped or mixcropped with grass (50:50 replacement density) in April 1992. Percent N derived from fixation (%Ndfa) in gliricidia and leucaena was measured during 4 periods of regrowth during August 1992-May 1993. Percent N derived from transfer (%Ndft) in grass grown with gliricidia and leucaena was calculated using the 15N enrichment of grass grown with senna as the reference. Nitrogen yield was higher (P < 0.05) in gliricidia than in leucaena and senna (which had similar N) monocultures. Mixcropped tree legumes produced similar N yields. In 3 tree legume species, a major percentage of the total N was in above-ground plant parts with roots accounting for around 22% at the final harvest. The 15N enrichments were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in senna than in gliricidia and leucaena at all harvests. Within a species, the 15N enrichments in different plant parts were not significantly different. %Ndfa varied little in monoculture gliricidia and leucaena, ranging from 61-72% in different regrowth periods. This increased to an average of 81% in mixcropped gliricidia and leucaena at the last 2 harvests. In both species, %Ndfa values calculated for different plant parts were not significantly different from the %Ndfa based on the weighted average 15N enrichment for the whole plant. N yield of grass grown with gliricidia and leucaena was 16% higher than that of grass monoculture. The 15N enrichments were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in grass grown with gliricidia and leucaena than in grass grown with senna and grass monoculture at the last 2 harvests. On average, up to 21% of N in grass growing with gliricidia and leucaena could be derived from transfer of biologically fixed nitrogen.

AB  - The effect of overnight supplementation with leucaena leaves on productivity and grazing activity of goats given access to a Digitaria setivalva pasture for 8 h during the day was studied. Maximum grazing activity occurred between 9 and 11 am for both control and supplemented groups. The latter showed lower grazing activity only during the first hour of being let out of the pens. A general decline in activity was observed after 3-4 h of grazing. Goats voluntarily returned to their shed for about 1 h to rest and ruminate, after which they resumed grazing. Daily live weight gain of the supplemented animals (72.4 g/head/day) was significantly greater than that of the control (31.4 g/head/day). Analysis of grab samples of pasture indicated that goats selected a diet that was of higher quality than the overall sward. Leucaena leaves were not only a good source of protein, but they also corrected the deficient Ca:P ratio of the grass diet.

AB  - One of the reasons for the low rate of adoption of alley cropping in the humid tropics is the problem of establishing the desired hedgerow trees. A split plot experimental design trial was set up to investigate the effects of 4 levels of nitrogen (N) fertilizer(0, 30, 60, and 120 kg N ha-1) on the growth of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in an intercrop with maize. Maize (Ekona 83TZ SR Y) was planted at 0, 25, 50, and 75 cm from Leucaena hedgerows planted on the same day. Leucaena plants were harvested at 3, 6, and 12 months after planting for biomass yield, N uptake, nodulation and mycorrhization. Results showed that at 0, 25, and 50 cm Leucaena/maize intercrop, there was no effect of N on Leucaena biomass. Leucaena biomass yield at 75-cm spacing compared favorably with the biomass of Leucaena sole Cropped that had received 0, 30, and 60 kg N ha-1 Application of 120 kg N ha-1 to sole Leucaena increased biomass yield significantly above all the intercrop spacings. Measurement of the solar radiation in the system showed that there was a close relationship between the amount of solar radiation received by Leucaena and its biomass yield. Maize intercropped close than 75 cm from Leucaena hedges reduced radiation received by Leucaena by 72% at 25 cm compared with 29% at 75 cm. This effect reduced Leucaena biomass yield at 25-cm spacing by 50%. This study showed that Leucaena can be established in intercrop with maize, but it requires about 75-cm intercrop spacing with crop and about 120 kg N ha-1 for good establishment. Leucaena/maize intercrop at 75-cm spacing enables Leucaena to receive about 72% solar radiation and larger area to forage for plant nutrients.

AB  - The trees and shrubs of different Leucaena spp. contain a non-protein amino acid, mimosine which is toxic to animals and microorganisms. We found small amounts of mimosine in the nodules and the root exudate of Leucaena leucocephala. Some Leucaena-nodulating strains of Rhizobium degrade mimosine (Mid+) and use it as a source of nutrients. To determine if the ability to catabolize mimosine by Rhizobium has a role in symbiosis, we constructed mutants that cannot degrade mimosine (Mid-) from a Mid+ competitive strain and tested them for growth in the presence of mimosine. When mimosine was added to a complete medium, it stimulated the growth of the Mid+ wild-type strain but inhibited the growth of a mutant in which the gene encoding a mimosine-degrading enzyme was disrupted. L. leucocephala and Phaseolus vulgaris plants inoculated with these mutants formed effective nodules showing that mimosine catabolism by the microsymbiont has no direct effect on symbiosis. When mixtures of the wild-type strain and the Mid- mutants were used to inoculate L. leucocephala and P. vulgaris seedlings, most nodules in L. leucocephala were occupied by the wild-type strain, whereas, the nodule occupancies in P. vulgaris were proportional to the inoculant mixtures. These results show that the Mid- mutants are defective in nodulation competition on Leucaena but not on beans. This indicates that mimosine present in Leucaena provides a nodulation competition advantage to the mimosine degrading Rhizobium strains.

AB  - Evaluation of soil aggregate stability under managed fallow systems is very relevant in the assessment of their agricultural sustainability. It is also important to identify the parameters that are most responsive to the effects of these fallow systems on aggregate stability. This study was carried out in southwestern Nigeria to quantify the effects of various fallow management systems on the macroaggregate stability of surface soft (0-15-cm depth) using a long-term fallow management trial established in 1989 on an Alfisol toposequence. Data were collected between 1994 and 1995. Three fallow systems (bush fallow, Pueraria phaseoloides, and Leucaena leucocephala) and three fallow periods (1-3 years after 1-year cropping) were evaluated. Cropping consisted of maize + cassava intercropping. A split-plot design with fallow systems as main plot and cropping intensities as subplot in four replications was used in the trial. Soil aggregate samples were wet-sieved to evaluate their mean-weight diameter (MWD) and fractal dimension (D). The means of MWD for the fallow systems and cropping intensities ranged from 2.4 to 6.4 mm. The mean D values ranged from 2.29 to 2.72 while the mean intercepts (log k) of the regression ranged from 2.01 to 2.28. Low D values (cohesive and stable aggregates) were associated with fallowing whereas high D values (fragmented aggregates) were associated with cultivation. Fallowing enhanced soil aggregate stability. The Pueraria system also enhanced soft aggregate stability more than the bush fallow and Leucaena systems when continuous cropping was practised. The subplots, which were fallowed for 2 or 3 years after 1 year of cropping, were usually similar in aggregate stability to the secondary forest soil. Fractal analysis showed further that soil aggregates in the dry season and on the upper slope of the topesequence were more cohesive than in the wet season and on the lower slope. Observed D and log k values were also significantly influenced by laboratory method.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to study the effect of inoculation of Rhizobium suspension in Albizia procera (Roxb.) Benth, Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth, and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit. seedlings grown in sterilized and nonsterilized soil media. Control treatments were maintained by non-inoculation. Inoculation response was observed strong in sterilized and modest in nonsterilized soil when compared to respective control treatments. Increase in height was found 105.07%, 63.42%, and 109% higher in sterilized soil and 52.1%, 68.6%, and 95.8% in non-sterilized soil for Albizia procera, Albizia lebbeck, and Leucaena leucocephala, respectively, after a period of 4 months. Nodule number increased up to 10.27 and 3.51 times in Albizia procera, 11.47 and 4.3 times in Albizia lebbeck, and 7.22 and 2.9 times in Leucaena leucocephala due to inoculation in sterilized and non-sterilized soil media respectively. Significant increase in nodule dry weight and nitrogenase activity was also recorded in both sterilized and non-sterilized soil for all the species tested. Nitrogenase activity per plant per hour was recorded 68.75, 11.58, and 13 times higher in sterilized and 6.7, 5.53, and 3.38 times higher in non-sterilized soil over control for the species respectively after 4 months. In the tree species tested the inoculation of Rhizobium showed higher productivity, modulation and nitrogenase activity than control suggesting the idea that application of Rhizobium suspension greatly enhances plant growth, modulation, and nitrogenase activity.

TI  - Genotypic diversity and symbiotic effectiveness of rhizobia isolated from root nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris L. grown in Tunisian soils
PY  - 1999

AB  - One hundred and sixty isolates of rhizobia were sampled from the root nodules of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivated in Tunisian soil samples originating from three geographically distinct fields. Plasmid profiling was used as a primary method to rapidly screen the isolates, and then 38 plasmid types were recorded among the 160 isolates. A sample representing the majority of plasmid types was chosen for further characterization by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of genomic DNA using chromosomal and symbiotic gene probes, and by their ability to nodulate a potential alternative host, Leucaena leucocephala. One third of the isolates showed a high similarity to Rhizobium gallicum isolated from common bean in France, another third showed the same characteristics as the R. etli-R. leguminosarum group, while the remaining isolates could not be related to any of the five species nodulating bean. When reexamined for nodulation, some of these isolates, showing similarities to R. tropici and Agrobacterium with respect to colony morphology and growth in different media, failed to nodulate their original host. The R. gallicum-like isolates, R. etli-like isolates, and R. leguminosatum-like isolates were recovered from regions where bean is frequently grown, while in fields which had not been cultivated with beans for at least the 10 previous years, solely unrecognized taxa of ineffective isolates were recovered. We detected variations in the symbiotic regions, but certain pSym RFLP patterns for nifH were conserved between Tunisian, French, and Austrian populations of bean rhizobia. Evaluation of symbiotic effectiveness showed that R. gallicum-like isolates and R. etli-like isolates were effective, whereas some R. leguminosarum-like isolates were ineffective. Furthermore, effective isolates were also found among the unrecognized taxa.

TI  - Alley cropping in the moist savanna of West-Africa: II. Impact on soil productivity in a North-to-South transect in Togo
PY  - 1998
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032407743&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1006124317003&partnerID=40&md5=d48c8788f789842d75c54535aca058ba
AB  - The moist savanna of West-Africa is characterized by a wide range of climates and soil types. The impact of the biophysical environment on hedgerow N uptake, wood production and maize grain yield was assessed for three years in three alley cropping trials with a selected number of hedgerow species in Glidji (Southern Togo), Amoutchou (Central Togo), and Sarakawa (Northern Togo). Senna siamea hedgerows accumulated significantly more N in the first pruning in Glidji (129-138 kg N ha-1) and Sarakawa (102-185 kg N ha-1) than in Amoutchou (17-26 kg N ha-1). This difference in N uptake was attributed to the infertile subsoil in Amoutchou, which was sandy up to I m and had a shallow groundwater-table. The amount of N accumulated in the Gliricidia sepium biomass varied between 38 kg N ha-1 in Glidji and 142 kg N ha-1 in Amoutchou. Averaged over all species and sites, 9 to 29% and 9 to 39% of the annual N accumulation in the hedgerow biomass is incorporated in the second, respectively third pruning. The Gliricidia trees produced between 12 and 26 ton fresh matter ha-1 of wood and the Senna trees between 4 and 38 ton fresh matter ha-1. Maize grain yield in Glidji was not affected by treatments (3196 kg ha-1, on average). In Amoutchou, the highest grain production was observed in the Gliricidia treatment (2774 kg ha-1 vs 1007 kg ha-1 in the control), while in Sarakawa, the Gliricidia (3786 kg ha-1) and Senna (3842 kg ha-1) plots produced a greater grain yield than the control plots (2123 kg ha-1). Maize yield increase in the alley cropping systems relative to the control plots was related to the soil total N content. Top and sub-soil characteristics were shown to he an important modifier of the functioning of alley cropping systems and should be taken into account when deciding on whether to use alley cropping and when selecting the hedgerow species.

AB  - Rhizobium-legume symbioses are important for their nitrogen input, but salinity and elevated temperature in arid and semi-arid areas limit their effectiveness, and therefore plant growth and productivity. Sixteen Rhizobium strains isolated from root nodules of Leucaena trees grown in different geographical areas of Egypt varied in their degree of tolerance to salinity and in their symbiotic effectiveness with Leucaena leucocephala under saline conditions. Three strains were tolerant to >3% NaCl. L. leucocephala grown in the greenhouse at concentrations of NaCl up to 1.0% and inoculated either with strain DS 78 or strain DS 158 displayed significantly better growth than those plants grown at the same levels of salinity and inoculated with reference strain TAL 583. Although nine of the Rhizobium strains grew at 42 °C, their mean generation times were lengthened two- to fourfold. When daylight growth temperatures were elevated from 30 °C to 42 °C, nodule number and mass, nitrogenase activities and shoot top dry weight of plants inoculated with strains DS 78, DS 157 and DS 158 significantly increased, whereas these parameters decreased in plants inoculated with strain TAL 583. Rhizobium strains that effectively nodulate Leucaena under adverse saline conditions and at high temperatures were thus isolated, identified and characterized.

AB  - Effects of intercropping Leucaena on early teak growth and soil properties in a simulated taungua system were evaluated in a humid tropical region of central Kerala in peninsular India. The experimental variables included five combination of teak and Leucaena (100:0, 67:33, 50:50, 33:67, and 0:100). Intercropping Leucaena promoted height and diameter growth of teak. Teak growth increased with increasing relative proportion of Leucaena in the mixture. Forty-four months after planting, teak in the 33% teak-67% Leucaena mixture were 45% taller and 71% larger in diameter at breast height than those in pure stands. Implicit in this growth stimulation of teak by intercropped Leucaena is its nitrogen fixing ability and potential as a soil improver. Soil analysis of the experimental plots provided corroborative evidence in this respect. Total nitrogen increased with increasing relative proportion of Leucaena in the mixture. Available P content of the soil increased as the proportion of Leucaena increased to 50% but declined thereafter.

TI  - Spatial and temporal gradients of earthworm casting activity in alley cropping systems
PY  - 1998

AB  - The amounts of earthworm surface casts were monitored for 200 days after commencement of casting in three alley cropping experiments of different ages and hedgerow species. Casts were collected twice per week in transects from under the hedgerow to the middle of the interrow space. Average annual cumulative amounts of casts were higher in alley cropping systems with one to five years of cropping than in the no-tree control. After five years of cropping, amounts of casts were similar in all treatments. Within the alley cropping systems, casting activity was highest immediately under the hedgerows and decreased towards the middle of the interrow space. In systems using Leucaena leucocephala as hedgerow species, the hedgerow to interrow space gradient of casting activity became more pronounced with increasing length of cropping. Casting activity in the interrow space was reduced by 12%, 55%, 80% and 86% in the first, fourth, sixth and seventh year of cropping, respectively, compared to the casting activity under the hedgerows. Senna siamea, which produced a more recalcitrant mulch, did not show such a strong decline in casting in the interrow space. In a Dactyladenia barteri system, the difference in casting between interrow space and hedgerows was insignificant. With perpendicular distance from the hedge, largest gradients in casting activity occurred close to the hedgerows with up to -4.00 Mg ha-1 cm-1 in L. leucocephala but only -1.23 and -0.76 Mg ha-1 cm-1 in S. siamea and D. barteri, respectively. The shading effect of trees and a relatively low level of soil disturbance is apparently more beneficial for earthworms in a cropped system than a high supply of readily available food from fast decomposing L. leucocephala prunings.

AB  - The influence of landfill leachate on the rhizobia-legume systems of Acacia confusa and Leucaena leucocephala was assayed for five months with a serial dilution (73-0.58%) of leachate which had a high concentration of NH4-N and dissolved organics. Although the acetylene reduction activity (ARA) of the nodules was suppressed by the leachate, the harvestable biomass of inoculated seedlings was higher than rhizobia-free seedlings. The total N content in rhizobia-free seedlings was higher than that for inoculated seedlings, indicating that the legumes accumulated more N from leachate- irrigated soil when they were not inoculated. Their performance was compared with that of two non-legumes (Cinnamomum parthenoxylon, Tristania conferta). These two non-legumes tolerated the highest concentration of leachate for only one month and then started to wilt.

AB  - Leucaena psyllid, Heteropsylla cubana, and long soft scale, Coccus longulus, populations were examined in 1993 and 1996 on nine Leucaena accessions grown at Raglan in coastal central Queensland. Accessions included five of Leucaena leucocephala, two of Leucaena diversifolia (a diploid and a tetraploid), and two hybrids (L. leucocephala x Leucaena pallida and L. leucocephala x L. diversifolia). The five L. leucocephala accessions had higher nymphal psyllid infestations than the two L. diversifolia accessions or the two hybrids. Scale numbers were highest on L. leucocephala (cultivar Tarramba), the tetraploid L. diversifolia and the two hybrids. Lowest scale counts were recorded on the diploid L. diversifolia and three lines of L. leucocephala (CPI 61222, Q25221 and cultivar Cunningham).

TI  - Effect of maize supplementation, seasonal temperature and humidity on the liveweight gain of steers grazing irrigated Leucaena leucocephala/Digitaria eriantha pastures in north-west Australia
PY  - 1998
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031935999&doi=10.1017%2fS0021859697004966&partnerID=40&md5=9d087e217ccef4463a67eb1ed39edbf2
AB  - Brahman Shorthorn steers (213±4·6 kg initial weight) were grazed on a pangola (Digitaria eriantha cv. Steudel) pasture interplanted with leucaena (Leucaena luecocephala cv. Cunningham) in rows 1·8-2·7 m apart in the Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) in north-west Western Australia. The leucaena comprised a mean of 46% of the diet but ranged from 100% of the diet on day 1 to c. 18% on a day 7 of a 7-day grazing period, within the rotational grazing system. It was suggested that the low herbage allowance of leucaena may have restricted the intake of the steers, reducing the quantity and quality of the herbage consumed. The steers were also supplemented with maize during the dry and wet seasons (1992 and 1992/93). THe maize supplement was offered at 0, 0·5, 1·0, 1·5 and 2·0 kg/head per day, over a 168-day period. Maize supplementation at 1·5 kg maize per head per day resulted in an increase in the liveweight gain of the steers grazing leucaena/pangola pastures in the dry season from 0·73±0·05 kg/day (mean ±S.E.) for no supplementation to 1·1±0·05 kg/day for 1·5 kg/head per day of maize. Maize supplementation up to 2·0 kg/day did not further increase the liveweight gain. A high rate of substitution of leucaena and pangola intake for the maize supplement occurred. There was a large seasonal difference in liveweight gain (mean 0·89 v. 0·63 kg/day for the dry and wet seasons respectively; p < 0·001) irrespective of the level of maize supplementation. This seasonal difference in liveweight gain was not primarily a function of the herbage on offer, but was most probably a direct function of the effect of seasonal temperature and humidity influencing the feed intake and growth rate of these Brahman crossbred cattle. This system produced some of the higher liveweight gains recorded per hectare for a grazing system (1570-2110 kg/ha per year), as a result of the very good individual liveweight gains (250-340 kg/head per year) and high stocking rate (6·25 head/ha).

AB  - The mineral status of native goats and forage species, namely; Cynodon plectostachyus, Pennisetum purpureum, Eleusine indica, Cynodon dactylon, Calopogonium muconoides, Centrosema pubescens, Leucaena leococephala, and Mimosa pudica in lahar affected areas of Concepcion, Tarlac, Philippines were determined. Forage and blood samples were collected six times in 1996-97, and analyzed for calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sulfur, copper, iron, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc. Forage calcium and sulfur are non-limiting. Most species had low phosphorus, copper and selenium, while some had magnesium and zinc levels lower than the critical limit because of low mineral content and high percolation rate of lahar deposits. Iron and molybdenum were in excess. The effect of seasonal variation was observed only in copper, sulfur and iron. Average blood mineral concentration of the animals was above critical limit, but there were no significant differences between seasons. All the animals had plasma phosphorus and magnesium above critical level; but 20 % had low copper, zinc and selenium especially in dry season possibly due to insufficient amount of these elements and excessive molybdenum and iron in most forage Conversely, calcium in forage was high; but 40 % of the animals had low plasma calcium concentration. Although no clinical signs of mineral deficiencies were observed, supplemental feeding would be important since the condition of the pasture in lahar-laden areas is not expected to improve in the next five years. Intensified use of L. leucocephala with better mineral profile would be ideal.

AB  - The Naalad system is an indigenous agroforestry practice developed by farmers more than 100 years ago in a small village in central Philippines. This study is the first attempt to scientifically document and evaluate the system. Six farm parcels at different stages of fallow and cultivation were selected as case studies. Farmers' practices were documented through interviews and record keeping. Soil samples were collected and selected chemical properties and bulk density were analyzed. Carbon (C) storage and sequestration were estimated by converting existing biomass data to C content. Results showed that there are two modifications in the Naalad system compared with common shifting cultivation systems in the Philippines. First, Leucaena leucocephala trees are planted in the fallow fields to shorten the fallow period to 5-6 years. The fallow field is also used as a source of fodder for cattle. Second, branches of Leucaena are used in the cultivated fields to serve as a fascine-like structure called balabag. These structures help to conserve the soil. Soil analysis revealed that there were no significant changes in soil properties within the fallow and cultivated fields over time. Similarly, there appeared to be no differences in the soil properties between the cultivated and fallow fields. The low levels of soil organic matter, P and K in the soil could indicate that the soils are being progressively depleted, albeit very slowly. Fallow fields are estimated to contain an average of 16 t C ha-1 in above-ground biomass, and sequester 5.3 t C ha-1 yr-1.

AB  - Studies to determine the most efficient seed disinfection and scarification methods, growth dynamics and culture media for the in vitro micropropagation of L. leucocephala cv. Peru, were carried out. Six disinfection periods with 1%sodium hypochlorite (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 min) and mercury bichloride as the control. The scarification was carried out with hot water for 3 min, seed pre-germination 24 hr in sterile water at room temperature and a control treatment. A simple classification design with 3 replications was used. Daily measurements of height were taken from the in vitro sowing until 14 days and from these plants 9 explants were dissected for their analysis. Also, the response to two culture media in plant formation was tested. In the seed disinfection the best response was obtained with the mercury bichloride where contamination reached only 23.7%. However, with sodium hypochlorite these ranged from 65.95 to 77.49% (P < 0.001). The most effective scarification was seed pre-germination in water for 24 hr with germination values of 77.08%, while in hot water it was of 59.2% (P < 0.001). The linear equation for growth (y = 0.993 + 0.503x) was of good fit (r2 = 0.99). Of the explants studied only the cotyledonal nodes formed plants and showed a superior response with the concentration of 5 mg/litre of BAP. Further studies on disinfection, scarification and hormone concentration for the in vitro micropropagation of L. leucocephala are suggested.

AB  - Fifty rhizobial isolates from root nodules of Mimosa affinis, a small leguminous plant native to Mexico, were identified as Rhizobium etli on the basis of the results of PCR-RFLP and RFLP analyses of small-subunit rRNA genes, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and DNA-DNA homology. They are, however, a restricted group of lineages with low genetic diversity within the species. The isolates from M. affinis differed from the R. etli strains that originated from bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) in the size and replicator region of the symbiotic plasmid and in symbiotic-plasmid-borne traits such as nifH gene sequence and organization, melanin production and host specificity. A new biovar, bv. mimosae, is proposed within R. etli to encompass Rhizobium isolates obtained from M. affinis. The strains from common bean plants have been designated previously as R. etli bv. phaseoli. Strains of both R. etli biovars could nodulate P. vulgaris, but only those of bv. mimosae could form nitrogen-fixing nodules on Leucaena leucocephala.

AB  - The soil- and litter-dwelling Collembola under four agroforestry tree species (Treculia africana, Dactyladenia (Acioa) barteri, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala) were monitored monthly for a period of 12 months and results were compared with those of a secondary forest and a grass plot. Treculia and Dactyladenia produced lower quality litter, leading to lower soil temperature and higher soil moisture under those species, relative to Gliricidia and Leucaena. The agroforestry tree plots contained more soil- and litter-dwelling Collembola than the secondary forest and grass plots. The slowly decomposing litter under Treculia and Dactyladenia supported more litter Collembola than the quickly decomposing litter under Gliricidia and Leucaena. Soil moisture and temperature were, respectively, positively and negatively correlated with populations of soil Collembola. Based on the results of this study, it is suggested that the use of prunings of agroforestry tree species as mulch in agroecosysterns would encourage the growth of Collembola populations and enhance their role in decomposition processes.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted during rainy season of 1991 and 1992 to study the effect of subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) canopy management practices and crop geometries on seed yield, quality and nitrogen uptake of clusterbean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.] and sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) crops. Topping at 1.50 m system of subabul canopy management gave significantly more yield and better quality of produce. Maximum uptake of nitrogen was also noted under the same system compared with central leader system, open centre system and no lopping conditions.

AB  - Synergistes jonesii is a rumen bacterium that degrades toxic pyridinediols from Leucaena leucocephala. This work presents progress on the characterization of the degradation of dihydroxypyridines from L. leucocephala by S. jonesii, and particularly by its cell free extracts. The substrate 3-hydroxy-4-[1H]-pyridone (3,4-DHP) induced degradation of both 3,4- and 2,3-dihydroxypyridine (2,3-DHP) isomers, while 2,3-DHP induced only degradation of 2,3-DHP. The 2,3-DHP was an intermediate of the degradation of 3,4-DHP by cultures. The compound 2,6-dihydroxypyridine inhibited degradation of 2,3-DHP by extracts of cells previously induced with this substrate. Cell-free extracts from S. jonesii had a high hydrogenase activity and degraded 2,3-DHP anaerobically either in the presence of methyl viologen under H2 or in the presence of α-ketoacids under H2 or N2. Specific activity of 2,3-DHP degradation was increased when FAD+ or CoA were present. The pyridine ring of the 2,3-DHP is enzymatically reduced by S. jonesii in reactions that demand reducing power provided by hydrogenase activity or by the metabolism of pyruvate. An unidentified non-polar amino compound appeared in thin layer chromatography as 2,3-DHP was degraded. We anticipate that gas chromatography mass spectrometry will permit the purification and identification of products from the cell-free reaction mix, which represents a simpler system than cell cultures, so that a pathway for pyridinediol metabolism by S. jonesii can be proposed.

AB  - In order to investigate the influence that plantations and clearing of native vegetation might have on plant regeneration in northeastern Mexico, seedling survival and germination (i.e., seedling emergence from the soil surface) were measured monthly in native fragments and an exotic plantation over a one-year period. Seedlings were measured in l-m2 plots, using 10 replicates under each of three different treatments: (i) dense thornscrub, (ii) semi-cleared thornscrub, and (iii) a dense L. leucocephala plantation. Seedling number peaked during summer and early autumn, lowest number of seedlings occurred during early spring. Excluding grasses, 36 species were present during the study, and only 14 were present in L. leucocephala plantation. Thornscrub and open thornscrub had similar number of grass seedlings, whereas more forb seedlings were present in open thornscrub. Seedlings of woody species were similar for all treatments. Under L. leucocephala germination was low for most species other than itself, most seedlings, however, died during the winter months.

AB  - The effect of three frequencies of defoliation (8, 12, and 16 weeks) on the yield and quality of Gliricidia sepium, Erythrina indica, and Leucaena leucocephala were investigated. Total dry matter (DM) yields of G. sepium, L. leucocephala, and E. indica increased significantly with longer intervals of defoliation. In spite of declining edible portion as a percentage of fresh yield with increasing maturity, the edible DM yields (EDMY) also increased, especially in G. sepium and L. leucocephala due to greater increase in total DM yields. When the EDMY were considered, G. sepium performed equally as well as L. leucocephala. Edible crude protein and digestible DM yields were positively related to EDMY and G. sepium performed best among the three species. Considering the most important yield and quality criteria, the best species was G. sepium when defoliated at 16 weeks. In order to reduce the wastage of forages and to obtain maximum yield and nutritive value of these three legumes, the species characteristics have to be considered together with the frequency of defoliations.

AB  - With the soaring cost and scarcity at times of inorganic fertilizers in the country, there is a need to find alternatives to inorganic fertilizers by making use of indigenous materials such as leaves of leguminous plants, mudpress, and so enhance growth and development of crops. Application of 'ipil-ipil' (Leucaena leucocephala) green manure supplemented with inorganic P and K caused vigorous growth of cassava (Manihot esculenta). Application of ipil-ipil biomass at the rate of 7.23 t ha-1 resulted in high yield and better values of yield components of cassava. However, due to high expenses incurred in hauling, transport and cost of the green manure materials, their use is likely to be more economical and feasible only if ipil-ipil is readily available in the farm. With taro (Colocasia esculenta), combined application of ipil-ipil green manure and inorganic P and K promoted vigorous stand and higher yield of the crop. Significantly larger corms were formed resulting in higher total corm yields and marketability than the control (untreated) and those treated only with 60-39.6-74.7 kg ha-1 N, P, and K from inorganic fertilizer. Increasing the rate of inorganic N applied to plants (90-36.9-74.7 kg ha-1 N, P, K) during a third cropping, gave comparable yield to treatment involving 7.23 t ha-1 ipil-ipil supplemented with inorganic P and K. Despite the relatively higher gross income obtained from organic and inorganic treatment combinations, slightly lower net income was obtained compared with inorganic fertilizer-applied plants due to higher production expenses incurred with the former treatments.

AB  - Fouling by marine organisms attached to ships' hulls is a serious problem for the shipping industry because it causes added drag which increases fuel consumption. In this study, the effect of micro texture on the biofouling resistance of low surface energy RTV silicones (PDMS) has been investigated. Surface microtexture in the range of 50-100 μm was achieved by molding silicones against various mesh structures. The surfaces were characterized with regard to chemical composition using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA); surface topography was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and wetting behavior was evaluated using contact angle measurements. It was found that the surface chemistry was not affected by the molding procedure and the surface texture proved to be regular and free from defects, with a surface free energy of 25.5 mN m-1. Above a certain degree of surface roughness, the water contact angle hysteresis decreased, which is characteric for composite surfaces according to the theories developed by Cassie and Baxter. Two-week field exposure on the west coast of Sweden showed that the microtextured PDMS surfaces were significantly less fouled by the barnacle Balanus improvisus than the smooth control PDMS surfaces.

AB  - Performance of male lambs and kids grazed on 4-year-old silvipastoral system consisting of Albizia amara and Leucaena leucocephala as trees, Dichrostachys cinerea as shrub and Chrysopogon fulvus + Stylosanthes hamata + S. scabra as pasture components was assessed from September 1994 to June 1996. Lambs and kids after introduction to the pasture continued to gain in their body weight up to April and May 1996, respectively, and after that animals maintained their body weight. The lambs gained body weight @ of 50 g/head/day in grazing period of 608 days while kids gained weight @ of 29 g/head/day in a grazing period of 639 days. The plant population of pasture and tree components after 2 years of grazing showed maximum decrease in S. scabra (91.3%) followed by S. hamata (58.3%) and L. leucocephala (38.0 %) indicating their relative preference by the animals. This results showed that sheep and goats can be maintained on silvipastoral systems with reasonable growth rates and that Stylosanthes were preferred plant species in pasture vegetation.

AB  - Leucaena species are leguminous plants native to Mexico. Using two L. leucocephala cultivars grown in different soils, we obtained 150 isolates from the nodules. Twelve rDNA types were identified which clustered into groups corresponding to Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, and Sinorhizobium by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of amplified 16S rRNA genes. Types 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 were distinct from all the defined species. Others had patterns indistinguishable from some recognized species. Most of the isolates corresponded to Sinorhizobium. Forty-one electrophoretic types (ETs) were identified among the isolates based on the different combinations of electrophoretic patterns of 13 metabolic enzymes. ETs were clustered into groups in general agreement with the rDNA types. Diverse plasmid patterns were obtained among the isolates, but common plasmids were observed among most isolates within rDNA types 5, 10, and 11. The symbiotic plasmids were identified among most of the isolates, except for the Mesorhizobium isolates. The affinities of host cultivars for different rhizobial groups and the impact of soil cultivation on the soil populations of rhizobia were analysed from the estimation of isolation frequencies and diversity. The results showed differences in rhizobial populations in cultivated and uncultivated soils and also differences in rhizobia trapped by L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham or Peruvian.

AB  - The influence of weeds on maize intercropped with cassava was evaluated in three fallow management systems and four cropping frequencies from 1989 to 1996 in Ibadan, Nigeria, West Africa. Fallow management systems consisted of natural bush, Leucaena leucocephala hedgerows and Pueraria phaseoloides fallow. Frequencies of cropping were continuous cropping, 1 cropping year alternating with 1, 2 and 3 years of uncropped fallow. Shrubs and climbers contributed 6070% and herbs (predominantly weeds) 30-40% to the total dry matter produced in all treatments. Weed dry matter and seedbank increased with time in all treatments but was higher in natural bush fallow by the fifth and sixth years and in continuously cropped plots. Weed seed density increased with time in the continuously cropped plots and in plots cropped after 1 or 2 years of fallow but decreased with time when the fallow period was up to 3 years. Maize grain yield decreased over time in both unweeded and weeded plots irrespective of treatment with the exception of the weeded P. phaseoloides fallow treatment. Cassava tuber yield decreased over time in unweeded plots in all treatments while tuber yield increased in weeded P. phaseoloides fallow treatment and remained relatively constant in L. leucocephala and natural bush fallow plots. The results from this study suggest that planted fallow involving legume species is more effective in weed management in the long term than natural fallow. Fallow period was beneficial to crop yield and yield improvement increased with the length of the fallow cycle, particularly for cassava.

AB  - The effects of Leucaena leucocephala and L. pallida prunings and cattle manure on maize nutrient uptake and yield were investigated in a hedgerow intercropping trial in the Ethiopian highlands. Hedgerow intercropping (also called alley cropping) is an agroforestry system in which trees are grown in dense hedges between alleys where short-cycle crops are grown. The hedges are pruned periodically during the cropping period and the prunings are added to the soil as green manure. For each leucaena species, the experiment had 16 treatments resulting from a factorial combination of four levels of leucaena leaf prunings (no prunings applied; first prunings applied; first and second prunings applied; first, second and third prunings applied), two levels of air-dried cattle manure (0 and 3 t dry matter ha-1) and two levels of N fertilizer (0 and 40 kg N ha-1 as urea). Uptake of N, P and K increased significantly with application of the three nutrient sources, but uptake of Ca and Mg either did not respond or decreased with application of prunings and manure. All the three factors increased maize grain and stover yields significantly, usually with no significant interactions between the factors. At least two applications of prunings were required to significantly increase nutrient uptake and maize yield. Maize in the row closest to the hedge did not respond to these nutrient inputs. It is concluded that hedgerow intercropping, with or without manure application, can increase crop yields moderately (to 2-3 t ha-1 maize grain yields) in the highlands, but P, Ca and Mg may have to be supplied from external sources if they are deficient in the soil. Additional N is still required for higher yields (>4 t ha-1 maize grain yields). However, quantification of the competition effects of the trees is also required to confirm these results.

AB  - This study was conducted near Hyderabad, India during 1991-1994 to quantify the effects of shoot pruning, fertilization, and root barriers around Leucaena leucocephala trees on intercropped sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) crop production under rainfed conditions. Crop plants grown with pruned trees attained higher dry matter and leaf area index than did those with unpruned trees. Two-year mean grain yields of sorghum with no root barriers were 76% and 39% of pure crop yield (1553 kg ha-1) for pruned and unpruned trees, respectively. Corresponding values for cowpea were 49% and 26% of pure crop yield (1075 kg ha-1). Sorghum or cowpea intercropped with trees responded to fertilizer application more strongly than did their respective pure crops, suggesting an increased need for fertilizer application in this agrisilviculture system over that currently used for pure crops. Impact of root barriers was small on either crop. Irrespective of root barriers, a high response to tree pruning suggested above ground competition for light dominated tree/crop interactions in this agrisilviculture system.

AB  - Presence of 3,4 DHP (3-hydroxy-4 (1H)-pyridone), a toxic metabolite of the nonprotein amino acid mimosine, in Leucaena leucocephala , a shrub legume with a high protein content and good potential for animal feed, limits its use. However, animals harbouring 3,4 DHP-degrading ruminai bacteria are able to utilize leucaena as a forage. DHP degrading bacteria were isolated from rumen fluid of a goat fed on leucaena using 3,4A medium containing 0.006% FeCl3. After 48 hr of incubation, black colonies were isolated that degraded 80 to 90% of 3,4 DHP and 2,3 DHP. Out of 6 selected isolates, 4 were obligatory anaerobic gram-positive cocci (1.2-1.8 mm), while 2 isolates were obligatory anaerobic gram-negative rods. Isolate P-15 degraded 3,4 DHP completely in a medium containing glucose and peptone . Its morphological and cultural characteristics showed that it belongs to the rumen Streptococci group. Establishing this strain into the rumen of DHP susceptible animals might be a remedy to the toxicity problem in leucaena fed animals.

AB  - A field trial on alley-cropping was conducted at the University of Ibadan research farm in the 1990/91 cropping season to assess the contributions of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and hedgerow woody legumes to the yield and nutrient uptake of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) as an intercrop in an infertile soil. The trial also investigated the influence of AM fungi on the interplanting of a non-nodulating woody legume Senna siamea (syn. Cassia siamea) with a nodulating woody legume (Leucaena leucocephala). AM contributions to cassava were greater than the hedgerow contributions, which demonstrated that AM associations are an essential component in the nutrition of cassava. In contrast to cassava, AM inoculation only influenced the leaf dry weight and uptake of nutrients of non-interplanted woody legumes but not the above-ground biomass and P uptake of interplanted woody legumes. However, non-inoculated interplanted Leucaena benefited more from indigenous AM fungi than the competing Senna. The negative contributions to the nutrient uptake (K, Ca and Mg) of cassava by hedgerows and the lack of response to AM inoculation in interplanted hedgerow woody legumes could be attributed to root competition among the different plant species growing in close proximity to each other. The present results show that cassava benefits more from AM association than Leucaena which in turn benefits more than Senna in an alley-cropping system.

AB  - A longterm alley cropping trial was undertaken on an eroded Oxic paleustalf in the forest-savanna transition zone of southwestern Nigeria from 1981-1993. Two nitrogen fixing hedgerow species (Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala) and two non legume hedgerow species (Alchornea cordifolia and Dactyladenia barteri) were used in the trial compared to a control (with no hedgerow) treatment. Plots were sequentially cropped with maize (main season) followed by cowpea (minor season). With 4 m interhedgerow spacing and pruning at 0.75 m height, the mean annual pruning biomass yields were observed in the following order: Leucaena (7.1 t ha-1) > Gliricidia (4.9 t ha-1) > Alchornea (3.7 t ha-1) > Dactyladenia (3.0 t ha-1). Alley cropping with the four woody species greatly enhanced the total plot (woody species + crop) biomass yield/ha as follows; Leucaena (21.8 t ha-1) > Gliricidia (17.7 t ha-1) > Alchornea (11.7 t ha-1) > Dactyladenia (9.5 t ha-1). Total biomass yield of crops in control plot was 5.3 t ha-1. Higher biomass yields with alley cropping also increased nutrient yield and cycling. Gliricidia and Leucaena showed higher nutrient yields than Alchornea and Dactyladenia. Alley cropping with Gliricidia and Leucaena could sustain maize yield at moderate level (>2 t ha-1), which would require a N-rate of 45 kg N ha-1 with sole cropping. Application of N in Gliricidia and Leucaena alley cropping still improved maize yield. Higher nitrogen rates are required for alley cropping with Alchornea and Dactyladenia hedgerows. A low rate of phosphorus application is needed for sustaining crop yields with all treatments. Occasional tillage is recommended to increase maize yield. Alley cropping and tillage showed little effect on cowpea seed yield. Surface soil properties declined with time with continuous cultivation. Alley cropping with woody species maintained higher soil organic carbon, phosphorus and potassium levels. Plots alley cropped with Gliricidia and Leucaena showed lower pH and extractable calcium level. Leucaena alley cropped plot also showed lower magnesium level. The decline in soil pH and extractable cations may be due to increased cation leaching with application of high rates of Gliricidia and Leucaena prunings. Alley cropping with the four woody species showed no effect on population of parasitic nematodes.

AB  - Dry season average daily liveweight gains of castrated, growing Landim fat-tailed sheep tethered on native grass (TR) or free-ranged in a cultivated pasture with a Leucaena leucocephala over-story (FL) were compared to sheep free-ranged on native grass (FR). During the year with 591 mm rainfall, growth rates (g/day) were 15.2, 37.8 and 25.8 for the respective treatments. During the year with 780 mm rainfall, growth rates were 17.0, 89.8 and 39.5 for the respective treatments. High rainfall versus low rainfall year differences in growth rate were not as large for TR animals (12% greater for high rainfall) compared to FR (53% greater) or FL (138% greater). The trial indicated that tethering fat-tailed sheep, thus limiting grazing selectivity, decreased growth rate compared to untethered animals. It also indicated that sheep with both greater herbaceous biomass and high crude protein leaves (from L. leucocephala) to select from had higher growth rate compared to animals in mixed cattle/sheep herds on native pasture.

AB  - A litter bag technique was used to study the decomposition and release of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg from Leucaena leucocephala and L. pallida prunings and cattle manure in a hedgerow intercropping trial conducted in the Ethiopian highlands. Hedgerow intercropping (also called alley cropping or alley farming) is an agroforestry system in which trees are grown in dense hedges between alleys where short-cycle crops are grown. The hedges are pruned periodically during the cropping period and the prunings are added to the soil as green manure. Manure was the most resistant to decomposition, losing only 15% of its dry matter (DM) in 15 weeks, compared to 41-57% lost by leucaena prunings. Large quantities of K (up to 104 kg ha-1) were mineralized from prunings and manure, but Ca and Mg were mostly immobilized. More N and P were released from prunings than from manure, which resulted in net immobilization of these nutrients in the initial stages of decomposition and net mineralization in later stages. Between the leucaenas more N was mineralized and less Ca and Mg were immobilized when L. leucocephala prunings were applied than when L. pallida prunings were applied. Fertilizer N increased DM decomposition and N mineralization. Mineralization of the nutrients was constrained by lignin and polyphenol contents. It is concluded that leucaena mulch and cattle manure may be significant sources of N and K for crop growth, but external sources of P, Ca and Mg may be required, particularly in acid soils which have low contents of these nutrients. However, this fertility effect has to be evaluated against the competition effect of trees to predict crop response.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is an important nitrogen fixing multipurpose tree recommended for shallow vertisols. It is a low fuel wood producer and is highly susceptible to psyllid bug, resulting in very low profit and affecting quality and quantity of forage. To identify suitable genotypes for minor timber and forage production, two separate studies were carried out at Regional Research Station, Bijapur (Karnataka) during 1990-95 and 1992-95, respectively. Results of first study indicated that among the eight genotypes, variety K-636 (L. leucocephala) produced high woody biomass and less seed, and had greater tolerance to psyllid bug. Heteropsylla cubana (Crawford) was found suitable for minor timber. In the second study, among 10 genotypes, provenance K-740 (L. collensi) was found better for forage production, since it was resistant to psyllid bug, which is detrimental for Leucaena based forage production system.

AB  - The study was undertaken to determine the relative performance of 13 fodder trees and shrubs in herbage production and quality under two forage regrowth periods six and 12 weeks. In primary growth assessment it was found that the species which achieved the most height growth were Cajanus cajan, Sesbania sesban and Gliricidia sepium. In terms of herbage dry matter production the species which performed best were Cajanus cajan, Flemingia macrophylla, Calliandra calothrysus, Codariocalyx gyroides and Gliricidia sepium. In crude protein content the superior species were Albizia lebbeck, Cajanus cajan, Leucaena leucocephaia and Sesbania sesban. Regrowth harvests in the second year showed Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra calothrysus and Flemingia macrophylla achieve the greatest herbage yields with yields in excess of 1 t/ha obtaining at the first 12 week regrowth harvest Albizia lebbeck, Cajanus cajan, Leucaena leucocephala and Samanean saman produced consistently very high crude protein levels (more than 20%) in the regrowth harvests. Calcium contents of herbage of all test species in the regrowth harvests were in excess of the critical minimum requirement of 0.44% for ruminant feeding.

AB  - Lack of Ca and often the presence of Al in subsoil restrict crop-root proliferation. The efficacy of soil surface liming in neutralize subsoil acidity is limited. Laboratory experiments were conducted with leaching columns to evaluate some organic and inorganic techniques to accelerate the mobility of Ca in a variable charge soil. Two different experiments were conducted, one with Ca-salts: CaCO3, CaSO4, Ca(NO3)2, Ca-acetate, and Ca-citrate; and another one with CaCO3 plus plant residues: black oat (Avena strigosa), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). The observations included MKCl exchangeable Ca in 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 30, 30 to 40 and 40 to 50 cm soil depth. The effects of CaCO3 without plant residue was limited to the upper 10 cm of the profile. The efficacy of Ca-salts on the mobility of Caex followed the order: NO3 > Acetate > Citrate > SO4 > CO3. Plant residues were highly efficient as Ca-carrier in the following order black oat > leucaena > wheat. Metal-organic complexes were assumed to be responsible for the movement of Ca in the profile associated with lime and plant residues. © 1999, Paraná Institute of Technology Publication.

AB  - In the first of two experiments, germination of seeds of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru)which had been stored for between 270 and 3955 days was examined, following scarification with hot water (80°C) for 0, 2 1/2 , 5 or 10 minutes. In the second trial, soil samples obtained from Samaru, Jos and Sokoto in Nigeria were used to investigate the effect of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 cm depth of placement in plastic pots on seedling emergence of 300-day old leucaena seeds subsequent to scarification. Germination declined significantly (P < 0.001) with the age of seed, was generally improved by hot water treatment and was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in seeds immersed for 10 minutes than for any other duration. The optimum depth of sowing appeared to be 2 cm for the heavier soils from Samaru and Jos while 6 cm was most favourable for the soil from Sokoto. Problems associated with the 0 and 10 cm depths of sowing are highlighted.

AB  - Four crossbred (Alpine x Beetal) milch goats (24 months; 30 kg live weight) in early lactation received during 31 days increasing levels of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM): 25, 50, 75 and 100% of dietary DM during first, second, third and fourth week onwards, respectively. Remaining dietary DM was supplied through green berseem and a concentrate mixture which constituted the whole diet after the 31 days feeding on LLM. Mimosine and 3-hydroxy-4 (IH) pyridone (3,4 DHP) contents of the LLM were 1.88 and 0.78% respectively. Daily average mimosine, 3,4 DHP and total toxin intake was 196, 82 and 278; 339, 141 and 480; 553, 230 and 783; and 648, 269 and 971 g kg-1 live weight (W) during first, second, third and from fourth week onwards, respectively. DM intake on sole feeding of LLM was 65.9 g kg-1 W0.75. No clinical toxicity symptoms were noted. Milk yield started declining from Day 27 onwards and reached the lowest level on Day 33 though LLM was discontinued from Day 31 onwards. Milk yield started improving from Day 37 and reached a peak by Day 49. The milk samples were free of mimosine and DHP, possibly due to some kind of barrier between blood and udder. Mimosine was not detectable in blood serum samples. The 3,4 DHP concentration in the blood serum, however, ranged from 97 on Day 8 to 402 μg ml-1 on Day 29 and disappeared completely by Day 36 when animals were on conventional diet. During metabolism trial faecal excretion of mimosine and 3,4 DHP was 4.43 and 17.9% of total toxin intake, respectively. Urinary excretion of mimosine was 1.59% while that of 3,4 DHP and 2,3 DHP through faeces and urine was 52.17% of total toxin consumed. DCP and TDN values of LLM in goats were 16.03 and 61.58%, respectively. Goats were in positive N balance. The T3 and T4 levels declined but DM intake was not affected. The SGOT and SGPT values were in the normal range. The study indicated that LLM could form a substantial portion of milch goat ration and milk of such goats being free of mimosine and DHP should be fit for human consumption.

TI  - Evaluation of Leucaena leucocephala and cactus (Opuntia sp.) as forages for growing rabbits
PY  - 1998

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala and cactus (Opuntia sp.) were evaluated as forages for rabbits based on growth, feed utilization, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) development, and carcass traits. A total of 64 purebred Altex and New Zealand White weanling rabbits were fed for 42 d. Experimental diets were 100, 90, 80 or 70% commercial pellets with corresponding levels of 0, 10, 20 or 30% leucaena leaves (dry matter basis), fed either with or without cactus offered ad libitum. Weekly growth response slopes varied by diet but not breed. Control rabbits (100% pellets fed ad libitum with and without cactus) had improved average daily gains by 9.0 g/d (P<0.01), reached 1,800 g minimum market weight earlier by 6.5 d (P<0.05), and had heavier 42-d final weights by 371 g (P<0.01) than rabbits fed leucaena with and without cactus. In general, cactus did not significantly influence any of the traits studied. Pellet and gross (pellet plus forage) feed intake performance in control versus forage-fed pens depended on whether cactus was included in the diets (P<0.05). However, independent of the cactus effect, conversion of gross feed to total gains was improved in control versus forage-fed pens (P<0.01). Rabbits fed 10% leucaena (with and without cactus) had higher pellet and gross feed intake levels (P<0.01), whereas no differences existed between 20 and 30% leucaena diets. Rabbits on the 20 and 30% leucaena with cactus diets numerically consumed the least quantity of pellets per unit of body gain. Control animals had 2.0% higher carcass (P<0.05), 0.85% lower GIT (P<0.01), and 0.14% lower stomach (P=0.07) weights as percentages of pre-slaughter weight than animals fed 30% leucaena with and without cactus. Carcass and GIT traits were similar between control animals fed only pellets and those fed pellets and cactus (P>0.05). Rabbits fed 30% leucaena with cactus had 2.7% higher carcass weight (P<0.05) and tended to have 1.0% higher pelt weight (P<0.10) compared to those fed 30% leucaena without cactus. Breeds were not different for growth, GIT and carcass traits (P>0.05). No signs of hair loss or discolored livers or urine due to possible mimosine toxicity were observed in 30% leucaena-fed rabbits. Hence, it is recommended for small-scale producers that the feeding level of leucaena (within a 0 to 30% range) should depend on economics in terms of realized feed cost savings in relation to growth response.

AB  - This study was aimed at evaluating the role of foliage from four leguminous trees (Sesbania grandiflora, Leucaena leucocephala, Hibiscus rosa-sinuensis and Ceiba pentadra) as a component of feeding systems for growing goats in the My Khanh village in the Mekong delta. Leaves and thin stems, the parts of the foliage that are consumed by goats, were collected every afternoon from March through to June, 1998. The amount of fresh foliage collected per unit of time was significantly higher for Hibiscus rosa-sinuensis than for three other tree species (Sesbania grandiflora, Leucaena leucocephala and Ceiba pentadra). The lowest harvest rate was for Sesbania grandiflora. Two feeding trials were done with the leguminous tree foliage as the sole component of the diet or as supplements to the fresh husk obtained from maize ears harvested at the immature (baby corn) stage. Eight smallholder farm families participated in each trial. Two young goats were distributed to each family and were housed in separate pens in a simple shed with raised slatted floor. In the trial with the tree foliages as the sole diet, the highest liveweight gains were with Sesbania grandiflora (114 g/day) followed by Leucaena leucocephala (98 g/day), Ceiba petandra (94 g/day) and Hibiscus rosa-sinuensis (77 g/day). Feed intakes (fresh foliage) were in the range of 2.5-2.9 kg/goat/day. In the trial with husk from immature maize the treatments were the fresh husk as harvested, or after ensiling, and with supplements of either Sesbania grandiflora or Leucaena leucocephala providing half the offered dry matter together with fresh husk. Best liveweight gain was with the supplement of Sesbania (112 g/day) followed by Leucaena (80 g/day). On the fresh husk as the only feed the growth rate was 50 g/day and was better than with the ensiled husk (32 g/day). It is concluded that foliage from Sesbania grandiflora has a high potential as a feed for growing goats, either as the sole component of the diet or as a supplement to the fresh husk from immature maize.

AB  - In cropping systems with limited amounts of external inputs, the soil organic matter pool (SOM) may contribute significantly to plant nutrition. The impact of organic inputs on total SOM and particulate organic matter (POM) N contents as affected by soil type and the relationships between sources of N and maize N uptake were assessed for a set of alley cropping trials in the West-African moist savanna. The trials were established in Niaouli (Benin Republic), in Glidji, Amoutchou, and Sarakawa (Togo), and in Bouake and Ferkessedougou (Cote d' Ivoire). The total soil N content, averaged over all treatments and years, varied between 324 and 1140 mg N kg-1 soil. The POM-N content varied between 50 and 160 mg N kg-1 soil. The average proportion of soil N belonging to the POM pool ranged between 9% and 29%. This was significantly related to the annual N inputs from maize stover and prunings, when averaged over the different alley cropping treatments. The trial 'age' also appeared to be related to the impact of the different treatments on the POM-N content. The Ferkessedougou soil contained a relatively higher proportion of total soil N in the POM pool because of its relatively high silt and clay content, compared to the other sites. The relative change in POM-N content between 1996 and the initial sampling was about twice the relative change in total soil N content. This suggests that N incorporated in the POM is relatively labile, compared to N incorporated in the other SOM fractions. Maize N uptake was related to the amount of add pruning-N (partial r2 of 27%), the rainfall during the growing season (partial r2 of 17%), the POM-N content (partial r2 of 14%), and to a lesser degree to the POM N concentration (partial r2 of 5%), the fertilizer N addition rate (partial r2 of 3%), and the silt and clay content of the soil (partial r2 of 3%). The POM-N content was shown to be influenced by organic matter additions and soil characteristics and to contribute significantly to maize N supply. This pool may be an important indicator for the soil fertility status of savanna soils.

AB  - Goats have been reported to browse and graze in different proportions during the year varying with the quantity and quality of available forage. Nevertheless, the proportions of these behaviors when the standing crop of bush and herbaceous forage is kept constant in availability (dry matter/ha) and varied in height (canopy) has been largely ignored. In this experiment three adjacent mixed irrigated pastures of grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) and shrub (Leucaena leucocephala) were used. Grass height was maintained at 27, 14 and 7 cm for treatments I, II and III, respectively, while the height of bushes (6666 plants/ha) were all kept at 150 cm. Dry matter availability was estimated on a weekly basis. Six 2-month-old Saanen female goats were placed in the three pastures (two goats per pasture) every morning from 0700 to 0800. One person observed each treatment (pasture), registering the time that each animal spent browsing, grazing and engaged in other activities. Every week, pairs of animals were assigned to a different treatment. By the end of the experiment (21 weeks), each pair of goats, had been observed for 7 weeks in each treatment. Across treatments goats grazed 63%, browsed 32% and were engaged in other activities for 3% of their time. The time spent browsing declined (P < 0.05) while time spent grazing increased (P < 0.05) as grass height increased. Other behaviors, remained constant. It is concluded that height of the grazing strata can influence time goats spend grazing and browsing when accessibility to browse is held constant.

AB  - The capabilities of rumen fluid sources from indigenous African ruminants and hindgut fluid from zebra to ferment leaves of Acacia angustissima, Calliandra calothyrsus, Leucaena diversifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena pallida, and Tephrosia bracteolata were evaluated to determine the presence of tannin tolerant or degrading microbes. In vitro gas and ammonia production and loss of neutral detergent fibre were estimated as indices for fermentation. The effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on fermentation was tested. The ability of microorganisms in rumen fluid sources to grow in the presence of tannin extracts or tannic acid was also tested and their disappearance was determined by HPLC. There was a significant (P < 0.001) rumen fluid source x fodder type interaction with all variables studied. The highest gas and ammonia production was from samples incubated with rumen fluid from dik-dik and goat. Addition of PEG enhanced fermentation with various rumen fluid sources and from some plant leaves but its effect was greatest (P <0.001) in A. angustissima. HPLC results showed that tannin and phenolic monomers were hydrolysed by all rumen fluid sources. The conclusion from this work was that rumen fluid from goat, gazelle, Gunther's dik-dik, and impala effectively fermented tannin-rich fodders and therefore may harbour tannin tolerant or degrading microorganisms.

AB  - We describe the isolation and characterization of alfalfa-nodulating rhizobia from acid soils of different locations in Central Argentina and Uruguay. A collection of 465 isolates was assembled, and the rhizobia were characterized for acid tolerance. Growth tests revealed the existence of 15 acid-tolerant (AT) isolates which were able to grow at pH 5.0 and formed nodules in alfalfa with a low rate of nitrogen fixation. Analysis of those isolates, including partial sequencing of the genes encoding 16S rRNA and genomic PCR-fingerprinting with MBOREP1 and BOXC1 primers, demonstrated that the new isolates share a genetic background closely related to that of the previously reported Rhizobium sp. Or191 recovered from an acid soil in Oregon (B. D. Eardly, J.P. Young, and R. K. Selander, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58:1809-1815, 1992). Growth curves, melanin production, temperature tolerance, and megaplasmid profiles of the AT isolates were all coincident with these characteristics in strain Or191. In addition to the ability of all of these strains to nodulate alfalfa (Medicago sativa) inefficiently, the AT isolates also nodulated the common bean and Leucaena leucocephala, showing an extended host range for nodulation of legumes. In alfalfa, the time course of nodule formation by the AT isolate LPU 83 showed a continued nodulation restricted to the emerging secondary roots, which was probably related to the low rate of nitrogen fixation by the largely ineffective nodules. Results demonstrate the complexity of the rhizobial populations present in the acidic soils represented by a main group of N2-fixing rhizobia and a second group of ineffective and less-predominant isolates related to the AT strain Or191.

AB  - Single-node leafy and leafless cuttings harvested from one-year-old, 1.3 to 1.5 m tall Leucaena leucocephala seedlings were successfully rooted in a non-mist propagator which is suitable for use in the rural tropics. Cuttings with a leaf attached rooted more successfully than those without a leaf (71% and 39% respectively) and clones differed significantly (43% to 71%). There was also a clear pattern in rooting ability of cuttings collected sequentially down the main stem: Cuttings rooted most successfully when taken from node five to 13 counting from the apex; this was the region where internodes were longest (64 to 109 mm) of moderate diameter (2.9 to 5.5 mm) and all cuttings had a leaf attached.

AB  - Following (iso)flavonoid induction, nodulation genes of the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 elaborate a large family of lipooligosaccharidic Nod factors (NodNGR factors). When secreted into the rhizosphere of compatible legumes, these signal molecules initiate root hair deformation and nodule development. The nonreducing glucosamine residue of NodNGR factors are N acylated, N methylated, and mono- or biscarbamoylated, while position C-6 of the reducing extremity is fucosylated. This fucose residue is normally 2-O methylated and either sulfated or acetylated. Here we present an analysis of all acetylated NodNGR factors, which clearly shows that the acetate group may occupy position C-3 or C-4 of the fucose moiety. Disruption of the flavonoid-inducible nolL gene, which is preceded by a nod box, results in the synthesis of NodNGR factors that lack the 3-O- or 4-O-acetate groups. Interestingly, the nodulation capacity of the mutant NGRΩnolL is not impaired, whereas introduction of the nod box::nolL construct into the related strain Rhizobium fredii USDA257 extends the host range of this bacterium to Calopogonium caeruleum, Leucaena leucocephala, and Lotus halophilus. Nod factors produced by a USDA257(pnolL) transconjugant were also acetylated. The nod box::nolL construct was also introduced into ANU265 (NGR234 cured of its symbiotic plasmid), along with extra copies of the nodDI gene. When permeabilized, these cells possessed acetyltransferase activity, although crude extracts did not.

AB  - The nylon bag dry matter digestibility (NBDMD) of one grass and 12 tropical shrubs (10 legumes and two non-legumes) varying in tannin content was measured in the rumens of five Droughtmaster steers. Five terminal and fully expanded leaves of each shrub were harvested by hand plucking, chopped fresh to about 3 mm lengths and incubated (either as fresh or after oven-drying at 65°C for 24 h) for 48 h. Chemical contents of freeze-dried samples varied widely among species: 1.59-3.84% for N, 25.93-53.21% for NDF, 19.17-39.44% for ADF and 1.97-19.36% for ADL. Extractable condensed tannin levels ranged from 0.3 to 11.6% for vanillin/HCl and from 0 to 9.3% for butanol/HCl extraction. Bound tannins also varied, the protein bound component of both Gliricidia sepium and Bauhinia rufescens exceeding 2% of the dry matter. B. rufescens also had a high fibre-bound tannin level of 0.9%. Oven drying consistently increased the NDF values and also increased the ADF and ADL levels in all species except Calliandra calothyrsus where there was a slight depression. However, the effect of oven drying on digestibility with this species was dramatic - 78% for fresh versus 41% for dried. For most of the other species NBDMD was similar for fresh and dried samples. NBDMD differed among species (p<0.001) from 18 to 78% for dried material and from 20 to 78% for fresh material. It was generally low in high tannin species and vice versa except for Calliandra calothyrsus which had high NBDMD for fresh material and high tannin, and Acacia currasavica which had low NBDMD but only average tannin levels. Only 5 of the 10 leguminous browse species evaluated were considered to be useful in sown pastures on the basis of their digestibility these were Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Albizia lebbek, Albizia richardiana and Calliandra calothyrsus. The non-leguminous, non-tanniniferous Combretum erythrophloeum had the highest NBDMD of all the browse species tested. Significant correlations existed between NBDMD and NDF, ADF, ADL and extractable tannins but not with the bound tannins. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (De Witt) plants were cultivated in a growth chamber, with 30% of artificial shading and in "cerrado" soil fertilized or not with addition of 0, 750, 1,500 and 3,000 kg ha-1 NPK, in Brazil. At 180 days after emergence, plants grown in soil without fertilization presented the lowest values of relative growth rate (TCR= 0.028 g g-1 day-1), total biomass (5.2 g), net assimilation rate (TAL = 4.2.10-4 g cm-2 day-1) and did not produce neither flowers or fruit. Among plants grown in fertilized soil, the highest values of TCR (43.92.10-4 g g-1 dia-1) and TAL (15.01 g cm-2 day-1) occurred in leucaenas fertilized with 750 kg ha-1 NPK. Plants fertilized with 1,500 and 3,000 kg ha-1 produced flowers and fruit since 120 days after emergence. Leaf senescence process began at 150 days after emergence, reducing the leaf area, TAL and TCR. Resistance to water stress was greater in 90 day-old plants than in 30 day-old ones. In both cases, the most desiccation resistant plants were those grown in soil with higher NPK rates. An osmotic adjustment aided the plants to survive during the drought period.

TI  - The relations of stomatal closure and reopening to xylem ABA concentration and leaf water potential during soil drying and rewatering
PY  - 1999

AB  - Two tropical tree species, Acacia confusa and Leucaena leucocephala, were used to study the relationships among stomatal conductance, xylem ABA concentration and leaf water potential during a soil drying and rewatering cycle. Stomatal conductance of both A. confusa and L. leucocephala steadily decreased with the decreases in soil water content and pre-dawn leaf water potential. Upon rewatering, soil water content and pre-dawn leaf water potential rapidly returned to the control levels, whereas the reopening of stomata showed an obvious lag time. The length of this lag time was highly dependent not only upon the degree of water stress but also on plant species. The more severe the water stress, the longer the lag time. When A. confusa and L. leucocephala plants were exposed to the same degree of water stress (around -2.0 MPa in pre-dawn leaf water potential), the stomata of A. confusa reopened to the control level 6 days after rewatering. However, it took L. leucocephala about 14 days to reopen fully. A very similar response of leaf photosynthesis to soil water deficit was also observed for both species. Soil drying resulted in a significant increase in leaf and xylem ABA concentrations in both species. The more severe the water stress, the higher the leaf and xylem ABA concentrations. Both leaf ABA and xylem ABA returned to the control level following relief from water deficit and preceded the full recovery of stomata, suggesting that the lag phase of stomatal reopening was not controlled by leaf and/or xylem ABA. In contrast to drying the whole root system, drying half of the root system did not change the leaf water relations, but caused a significant increase in xylem ABA concentration, which could fully explain the decrease of stomatal conductance. After rewatering, the stomatal conductance of plants in which half of the roots were dried recovered more rapidly than those of whole-root dried plants, indicating that the leaf water deficit that occurred during the drying period was related to the post-stress stomatal inhibition. These results indicated that the decrease in stomatal conductance caused by water deficit was closely related to the increase in xylem ABA, but xylem ABA could not fully explain the reopening of stomata after relief of water stress, neither did the leaf ABA. Some unknown physiological and/or morphological processes in the guard cells may be related to the recovery process.

AB  - Balances between nutrients applied or mineralized and nutrients removed in maize grain and stover were calculated in a hedgerow intercropping experiment in which Leucaena leucocephala and L. pallida prunings and cattle manure were applied. Hedgerow intercropping (also called alley cropping) is an agroforestry system in which trees are grown in dense hedges between alleys where short-cycle crops are grown. The hedges are pruned periodically during the cropping period and the prunings are added to the soil as green manure. In control treatments, nutrient depletion per season was in the order of 7-19 kg N ha-1, 4-12 kg P ha-1, 10-26 kg K ha-1, 0-2 kg Ca ha-1 and 3-6 kg Mg ha-1. N fertilizer reversed the depletion of N, but it accelerated the depletion of the other nutrients. Manure and at least two applications of leucaena prunings resulted in net positive balances of N, K, and Ca between amounts applied or mineralized and amounts removed by maize. The amounts of P and Mg applied with, or mineralized from, prunings or manure were insufficient to offset the negative balances of these nutrients.

AB  - Twelve males and twelve females weaner goats with mean initial body weight of 12.6±2.6 and receiving ensiled (14 days) chopped maize stover treated with urea (30 g urea in 600 ml of water kg-1 dry matter (DM) maize stover) and a protein supplement containing 30%, 67% and 3% of cotton seed cake (CSC), maize bran (MB) and a mineral mixture, respectively, were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments. These consisted in the replacement of 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3 of CSC and proportional amounts of maize bran by dry Leucaena leucocephala (DLL) to achieve isoprotein diets. Feed intake and growth performance were recorded for 90 days. Nutrients digestibility and nitrogen utilization was also performed on the 12 male goats allocated to treatments. The DM, crude protein (CP) and metabolizable energy (ME) intakes were not significantly (P>0.05) different between treatments and mean daily gains were not significantly (P>0.05) affected by dietary treatment. Digestibility coefficients of DM, organic matter (OM) and CP decreased with increasing levels of leucaena in the diets, but the differences between diets were small. Digestibility coefficients of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) were significantly (P<0.05) reduced when CSC was wholly replaced with DLL. The highest efficiency of N utilization (68.97±5.14%) was shown by goats on treatment 3 (T3). It can be concluded that DLL can substitute up to 2/3 of CSC as a protein supplement to goat weaners without reduction in performance. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - We surveyed 41 sites from throughout O'ahu that had been dominated by native pili grass (Heteropogon contortus) in the late 1960s. Pili grass was absent from 14 (35%) of those sites in 1997 and had declined in abundance in most of the 27 remaining sites, relative to the late 1960s. The pili grass communities have been replaced by communities dominated by one of three African grasses; Cenchrus ciliaris (buffel grass), Pennisetum setaceum (fountain grass), or Panicum maximum (Guinea grass). Panicum maximum was often associated with the shrub Leucaena leucocephala, and Cenchrus ciliaris and Pennisetum setaceum communities showed little evidence of succession toward woody vegetation. Communities dominated by the African grasses were significantly less diverse, in terms of number of plant species, than the native pili grass-dominated communities. Observations made on other Hawaiian islands suggest that this rapid pili grass decline and replacement with alien grasses has not been limited to O'ahu. Research is needed to determine how higher-diversity native pili grass communities can be maintained in the Hawaiian Islands as a valuable natural and cultural resource.

AB  - The potential of Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis cineraria leaves as nitrogen supplements (16 g/kg W0.75/d) to improve the utilization of a basal diet of rice straw by goats was assessed in a feeding trial. Rice straw supplementation with forage oats (Avena sativa) was fed as a control diet. DMI, g/kgW0.75 of rice straw by goats receiving Leucaena was significantly (p<0.05) higher followed by Prosopis and oat fodder. The supplementation of Leucaena improved the digestibility coefficient of DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF and nutrient density. Goats on Prosopis or oat fodder supplemented straw responded similarly in terms of nutrient utilization. The intake (g/kgW0.75) of DCP, TDN and nitrogen balance of goats were significantly higher (p<0.05) when Leucaena was fed. It is suggested that the Leucaena may be a useful N-suppiement in areas where livestock are fed poor quality crop residues.

AB  - Three rumen fistulated Karan Fries crossbred (Holstein X Tharparkar) calves were fed increasing dry matter (DM) levels of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% through leucaena leaf meal (LLM) starting at week 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The mimosine, 3,4 DHP and 2,3 DHP levels were determined in strained rumen liquor (SRL) and serum at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h postfeeding on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 42. LLM was incubated for 24 h with SRL in vitro on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 41 to study mimosine and dihydroxypyridone (DHP) biodegradation. On day 43, 1-1.5 1 of rumen liquor was transferred to another set of three unadapted calves which were fed 50% LLM after transfer of inoculum. DM intake was 1.78%, 2.13%, 2.27%, 1.66%, 1.54% and 1.35% of live weight during the 1st through 5th week, respectively. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed extensive degradation of mimosine to 3,4 DHP and 2,3 DHP from first day of LLM feeding. The overall in vitro DHP degradation was nil, 28.6%, 43.3% and 40.1% on day upto 15, 21, 28 and 42 of LLM feeding. No mimosine was found in serum on any day of sampling. The 3,4 DHP detected (56.94±31.65 μg ml-1 serum) one hour post feeding on day 1 exhibited a decline from day 22 onwards. The serum also contained 2,3 DHP on days 8, 15, 22, 42. The faecal and urinary excretion of 3,4 DHP and 2,3 DHP as percent of mimosine intake declined from first week (76.3±2.8) to 4th week (42.1±4.1). The feeding of LLM resulted in reduced level of T3 and T4 within a week of LLM feeding. The level of T3 improved to normal by 6th week while that of T4 remained low. The SGOT and SGPT activities were within normal range. The gradual adaptation to LLM feeding caused Karan Fries calves to acquire DHP degrading ability to nontoxic compounds and this ability was transferred through transfer of rumen liquor from such calves to other unadapted calves at as early as 9th day of LLM feeding. The results revealed the possibility of two types of microbes degrading mimosine and 3,4 DHP to 2,3 DHP. One type of 2,3 DHP degrading microbes may be inhibited in the presence of 3,4 DHP whereas the other type may be active. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Effects of inoculation of Rhizobium suspension on nodulation and plant growth were examined with Albizzia procera, Albizzia lebbeck and Leucaena leucocephala seedlings grown on sterilized and non-sterilized soil media. Inoculation resulted in nodule number increases of 28.6, 29.02 and 23.9 times in sterilized soil and 3.4, 3.6 and 3.27 times in non-sterilized soil for A. procera, A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala seedlings respectively. Total dry mass increased by 127.6%, 66.7% and 60.7% in sterilized soil and 100%, 95.5% and 52.65% in non-sterilized soil for these three legume trees, respectively, after a period of two months. Significantly high inoculation responses of root length, root diameter, collar diameter, shoot length, and dry mass of root, shoot, leaves and nodules were also observed in both sterilized and non-sterilized soil media as compared to respective control treatments. The response to inoculation was strong in sterilized and modest in non-sterilized soils. The significantly higher response to Rhizobium inoculation over control in all the species tested suggested that application of Rhizobium greatly enhanced plant growth, nodulation, biomass production and nitrogen-fixing activity of the nodules. © 1999 SCIENCE PRESS.

AB  - Leaf extracts and mulch from 14 MPTs were used to study their effects on germination, initial growth and nodulation of cowpea. Aqueous leaf extracts of 1/4 , 1/2 , 3/4 and full concentrations were added to cowpea seeds placed in Petri dishes. In the pot experiment, cowpea was planted in plastic pots filled with 1200 g of soil, and mulch was either surface-applied or incorporated into the substrate at rates equivalent to 5, 10 and 20 tons-ha-1. Leaf extracts from Gliricidia sepium, Senna siamea, Milletia thoningii, Grewia pubescens and Tetrapleura tetraptera reduced cowpea germination significantly at concentrations above 25 % of the full concentration 7 days of incubation. Root length was also strongly reduced by extracts from Gmelina arborea, Senna siamea, Alchornea coordifolia, and Tetrapleura tetraptera. These inhibiting effects were also observed in the pots. Mulch incorporation significantly reduced growth and nodulation of cowpea in the pots. These reductions were more pronounced with the incorporation of mulch from fast decomposing trees such as Leucaena leococephala, Gliricidia sepium and Grewia pubescens. Although Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium released much nitrogen, they strongly reduced cowpea growth when incorporated. This may suggest that other reasons than N immobilization caused growth reduction when the plant residues were applied to cowpea.

AB  - Nitrogen recovery from 15N-labelled prunings of Gliricidia sepium, Peltophorum dasyrrachis, Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala, each of two different chemical qualities, was followed over three cropping cycles in a growth room. Half of the pots of each treatment received a further addition of unlabelled pruning material, from the same species as that previously applied, before the second and third crop cycle. The cumulative maize total N accumulation revealed the largest benefit from N rich, low lignin and polyphenols Gliricidia prunings followed by Leucaena, Calliandra and Peltophorum. Cumulative N recovery measured using 15N over the three crop cycles ranged from 9% from Calliandra prunings to 44% from Gliricidia prunings. The vast majority of this N was recovered during the first crop cycle which agreed well with estimates using the N difference method. Recoveries in the second and third crops ranged from 0.4-5% (15N method) and 6-14% (N difference method) of the N initially applied. The protein binding capacity of polyphenols was the best predictor of N recovery at both initial and later crop cycles. Treatments which led to a large N recovery initially, continued to provide greater N benefits in subsequent cycles although with increasing harvest time this trend decreased. Thus, there was no compensation in initial N release from low quality prunings at later harvests and the agronomic implications of this are discussed. Addition of unlabelled Gliricidia prunings before the second and third cycle led to a positive apparent priming effect on previously applied 15N labelled prunings. By contrast, repeated additions of Peltophorum residues, rich in lignin and active polyphenols, resulted in a reduced recovery of initially applied pruning-15N. However, the maximum positive or negative effects on recovery of pruning N amounted to less than 2% recovery of the initial amount of N added over 14 weeks. Thus the scope for regulation of N release from tree prunings during these later stages of decomposition appears to be limited.

AB  - Completely randomized experiments under greenhouse conditions were carried to study the role of cotyledons on the cotyledonal axillary shooting of Phaseolus vulgaris L., Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit, Prosopisjuliflora (Sw.), Tamarindus indica L. and De/onix regia L. The seedlings underwent the following treatments: removal of both cotyledons on the first to the Ihird day afler emergence, removal of only one cotyledon on lhe first day of emergence, and no cotyledon removal. Growth recovery in P. vulgaris seedlings, as evaluated through shooting occurrence, is independent of lhe number of cotyledons removed on lhe flfSI to the third day after emergence, but it was mostly less effective than that in V. unglliculata. Growth recovery in V. unguiclllata seedlings was less effective when bOlh cotyledons were removed on the first day of emergence as compared to the other treatments. In L lellcocephala, P. juliflora, T. indica, and D. regia seedlings, the removal of both cotyledons, on the first to the third day after emergence, suggests an increase in the mortality of seedlings. The removal of only one cotyledon did not significantly affect the percentage of seedling survival nor limit shooting to the corresponding axil ofthe removed cotyledon. © 1999, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

AB  - Thirty crossbred West African lambs were assigned randomly to three different feeding systems: T1: grass pasture grazing (Cenchrus ciliaris) +2 h/day of grazing leucaena; T2: grazing pasture +300 g of feed concentrate and T3: grazing only on grass pasture in order to determine the effect of feed supplementation on carcass characteristics, non-carcass components, retail cut percentages and quality of lambs carcasses. Full live weight and empty live weight were 22 and 30% heavier (p < 0.05) for T1 and T2 with respect to T3. T2 differed from T1 and T3 in hot carcass weight (2.1 and 3.6 kg more) and cold carcass weight (1.2 and 2.2 kg more), respectively. T2 had a higher dressing percentage (p < 0.05) than T1 and T3 (40.77 vs. 37.88 and 35.07), respectively. T1 and T2 were 24 and 29% more in ribeye area than T3. The conformation was not very favorable in any of the treatments. The conformation of the leg in T1 and T2 was poor (slightly concave) and for T3 very poor (concave). T1 and T2 lambs had lighter feet (0.22 percentage points) and heavier testicles (0.52 and 0.60 percentage points), with respect to T3, respectively. The livers in T2 weighed 14 and 107 g more than in T1 and T3, respectively. T1 and T3, however, had a higher proportion of full intestines (6.32 and 2.64 percentage points, respectively) than T2. There were no differences between treatments (p > 0.05) for the chop, leg and shoulder neck percentages but there was a difference (p < 0.05) in the loin percentage in T1 and T2 with respect to T3 (4.69 and 4.57 vs. 3.93) respectively. T2 showed higher percentages of internal and fat deposits in kidneys than T1 and T3. T1 and T3 had light while T2 had moderate external carcass fat. T1 and T2 had slightly dark red muscle color while the muscle color for T3 was cherry red. It was concluded that the combination of feed concentrates and/or Leucaena leucocephala is an alternative in the production of well-finished lamb carcasses with good external fat, meat of better quality and appearance for the consumer and higher percentages in retail cuts.

AB  - A five year field experiment was conducted to get information which will facilitate the scientific development of tree mixtures in an agroforestry system with two fruit trees viz., mango (Mangifera indica L.) and cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) and four tropical nitrogen fixers viz., Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia holosericea, Casua-rina equisetifolia and Leucaena leucocephala. Observations on biometrics and edaphic parameters were recorded. Enhanced growth of cashew and mango was observed when coplanted with casuarina and leucaena, respectively. The enhanced height growth of cashew by 25% is recorded when interplanted with casuarina and plant girth (10.8 cm) was maximum when interplanted with leucaena. About 11% increase in height growth of mango was registered when interplanted with leucaena. The investigation identified two nitrogen fixers namely casuarina and leucaena for coplanting in cashew and mango orchards, respectively in the initial establishment Stage. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the liver of White Leghorn hens, the biochemical changes due to incorporation of Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) leaves in commercial poultry diet were studied. Lactate dehydrogenase, lipid peroxidation, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase activity altered in response to Leucaena leucocephala leaf-meal feeding. The results indicate that high level of LLM incorporation in diet may lead to oxidative stress, tissue damage and leakage of hepatic enzymes because of presence of toxic components in subabul.

AB  - Heavy Metal Accumulation in Reclaimed Soils is Increasing Rapidly in Developing Countries Where the Use of Saline Waters for Irrigat. is a Com. Pract., even though Salinity-heavy Metal Intrac. Are Not Fully Understood. An Example for This Devmt. is the Bangar Area of Egypt Where the Applic. of Contaminated Amendments during the Last 30 Years Has Increased the Cd and Zn Concentrations in Topsoils from 0.08 to 0.76 mg kg-1 and from 17 to 73 mg · kg-1 respectively. This work aimed at evaluating the uptake of Cd and Zn by Leucaena leucocephala, a leguminous tree cropped for fodder and green manure, as affected by the addition of 10 mM NaCl to irrigation water. During a 6 month field experiment, salinized and control plots were compared with respect to soil solution composition and root development as well as the uptake of Cd and Zn and their translocation to the leaves. NaCl treatment raised the concentration of organic carbon, Cd and Zn in soil solution and enhanced the uptake of Cd and Zn significantly. Salinized plants showed shorter roots, reduced retention of Cd and Zn in roots and stems and considerable translocation of both elements to the leaves. This work demonstrates that NaCl salinity affects not only the bioavailability of soil Cd and Zn but also modifies plant functions related to their acquisition and translocation to the leaves. The results provide evidence that the risk of transfer of heavy metals to the food chain and their leachability to the ground water may be greater under saline conditions than generally assumed. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1999.

AB  - There is keen interest in feeding small ruminants with herbage from forage shrubs and trees in Ghana because of the general perception about these plants being perennial and remaining green for lengthy periods. In this study, plant growth rate, herbage production and quality of two indigenous woody plants, Griffonia simplicifolia and Baphia nitida were compared to those of two introduced shrubs, Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium. Gliricidia sepium achieved the greatest height and produced the highest herbage dry matter (2 t/ha) compared to average production of 0.15 t/ha by the three other species. Gliricidia sepium herbage also had high contents of crude protein, calcium and ash. In regrowth herbage production at cutting intervals of 6 and 12 weeks, Gliricidia sepium again outperformed the three other species, however, there was little difference in herbage yield among the three other species. In all species one harvest at 12 weeks regrowth interval produced more herbage than the combination of yield of two six week interval harvests.

AB  - Allelopathic effect of leaves and litter of Leucaena leucocepahala was examined on Zea mays through various greenhouse and laboratory studies. The extracts of dried leaves as well as litter were found to be inhibitory to germination and seedling growth of Z. mays under laboratory conditions. Further, the amendment of leaf powder and litter in the soil as mulch or soil mixture caused detrimental effect on root and shoot growth and biomass which increased with increase in the amount of litter/leaf powder applied. The inhibitory effect was greater when the material was amended as soil mixture. Litter was found to be more inhibitory than leaf powder in both laboratory and greenhouse studies. The amount of phenolics (a well known allelochemical group) was determined from different soil horizons under Leucaena plantations as well as its leaves. Maximum amount was found in leaves followed by the A00- soil horizon containing partially degraded leaf litter of Leucaena.

AB  - The performance of bioregulator populations in two areas of leucaena (3 and 15 years of establishment) was studied for two years. Insect population was characterized and possible natural biological control agents of Heteropsylla cubana were studied to maintain the biological equilibrium within the agroecosystem. A monthly representative sample of 60 catches was used. The tables of risks and comparison of proportions were used for the analysis. There was a higher incidence of the H. cubana psyllid in the leucaena area of 3 years of establishment, without economical damages for the plants. It increased at the end of the rainy season and at the beginning of the dry season with averages of 1242.5 and 995.5 individuals in the areas of 3 and 15 years, respectively. October showed the maximum psyllid population in both areas. The study demonstrated that among the beneficial entomofauna the Chilocorus cacti coccinelidae had the highest incidence and stability reaching 84.6% while the other biological agents remained at low proportions. It is concluded that under our conditions the active presence of bioregulators prevents the psyllid from causing economical damages to leucaena, among them: Chrysopa sp. Cycloneda sanguina and Zelus longipes. Further bioecological studies of these predators are needed for their mass production and release in leucaena areas. Also, it is necessary to define the Ch. cacti as a possible psyllid bioregulator, givingan alternative to a more efficient pest control under safe ecological conditions.

AB  - The objective of this work was the selection of arboreal species for multi pie use in the semi-arid area of the state of Sergipe, Brazil Fifteen species from the semi-arid area of Central America were introduced in the region: Ameia farnesiana, Albizia caribaea, Albizia guachepele, Atelein herbert-smithii, Caesalpinia coriaria, Caesalpinia eryostachys, Caesalpinin velutina, Enterolobium cyclocarplIm, Glirieidia sepillm, Leucaena diversifolia, Leucaena lellcocephala, Leucaena shannoni, Parkinsonia aculeata, Pithecellobium dulce and Senna otomaria. The species were planted in the Experimental Field of Glória, Embrapa Semi-Árido, in Nossa Senhora da Glória, Sergipe State, in holes of 3Ocm×30cm, without fertilization, 3.Om×2.0m apart in a randomized block design with three replications and 36 plants per plot. They were evaluated for survival, height, diameter at the height of 130m from the soil surface, 55 months after planting. G. sepium and A. guachepelle showed higher growth than the other species, with mean heights (± standard deviation), of 4.0±0.4 and 4.3±O.2m respectively, and mean diameters (± standard deviation) of 4.4±O.5 and 6.3±O.1cm, and survival rates of 100 and 98%. Although L leucocephala showed excellent growth in height (5.0±03m) and in diameter (6.0±1.5cm), its survival rate was 44%. L diversifolia and A. farnesiana have shown 100% mortality in the studied plots. Glirieidia sepium and Albizia guachepele were outstanding, with great potentiality for the semi-arid areas in the State of Sergipe. Amcia farnesiana, Leucaena diversifo/ia and Senna otomaria did not show a good performance in the semi-arid conditions of the region. © 1999, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was carried out at Cantho University from March to June 1997 to determine effects of foliage of Sesbania grandiflora , Leucaena leucocephala , Hibiscus rosa -sinensis and Ceiba pentadra on intake, digestion and rumen environment of growing goats. The design used four goats (10-12 kg live weight) in a Latin square arrangement of four treatments (the tree foliages) with 21 day periods. Feed intake, total faecal and urine output were recorded during the last fifteen days of the study period. On the last day of each period, rumen fluid was obtained with a stomach tube before and 4 hours after offereing feed in the morning. Intake of fresh foliage was similar (P=0.24) on all treatments but dry matter and crude protein intakes differed significantly (P=0.001) with highest values for Sesbania, followed by Leucaena, Ceiba and Hibiscus. Apparent dry matter digestibility coefficients were 74.8, 75.9, 68.0 and 76.0 % for Sesbania, Leucaena, Hibiscus and Ceiba, respectively, and did not differ between foliages. There were significant differences (P=0.038) in apparent digestibility of crude protein with lower values for Hibiscus and Ceiba (50.5 and 49.3 %) compared with Sesbania and Leucaena (63.7 and 66.5 %). Feed dry matter intake was highly correlated (R2 = 0.86) with intake of crude protein. Changes in liveweight were 143, 80, 51 and 74 g/day (P=0.067) for Sesbania, Leucaena, Hibiscus and Ceiba, respectively. Rumen ammonia levels and protozoal counts after feeding were higher for Sesbania and Leucaena than for the other two foliages. It is concluded that the foliage of Sesbania grandiflora and Leucaena leucocephala has a higher feeding value for goats than that from Ceiba pentadra and Hibiscus rosa -sinensis, but that all four foliages will provide more than maintenance needs for growing goats.

AB  - Weed seed bank size and composition were analysed in 1995 and 1996 in maize fields mulched with pruning from Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Senna siamea in South Western Nigeria. Plots mulched with pruning from the three trees had a lower weed seed bank in the first year of cropping than unmulched plots. In the second year of cropping, the weed seed bank was higher than in the first year in the Gliricidia sepium, and Leucaena leucocephala mulch treatments by 41 and 65% respectively. Senna siamea had a lower seed bank at all times of sampling. Talinum triangulare, Sedges, Oldenlandia corymbosa and Ageratum conyzoides were the dominant species in the seed bank of all treatments. Mulched plots had a low seed bank of Oldenlandia corymbosa, and Ageratum conyzoides in all treatments but Talinum triangulare and sedges remained largely unaffected. Future weed control strategies with mulches in this area should therefore target the first named species. For weed management, Senna siamea mulch was the most effective in reducing seed bank.

AB  - As technologies to counter soil fertility decline, alley farming with Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium, annual short-season Mucuna pruriens var. Utilis fallowing, and perennial Acacia auriculiformis fallowing have been tested. With alley farming, timely pruning is a critical element in farmers' capacity to match on-station yield levels: 55% of the farmers who delayed pruning suffered about 60% yield losses. Farmers are now comparing a new alley band concept, grouping trees in bands 20 m apart with five times less tree/crop competition. However, an improved planted fallow of A. auriculiformis to regenerate exhausted soils grew a great deal in popularity because of quick regeneration of yields and a profitable bonus of good quality firewood. Mucuna, which was grown by 15 farmers in 1987 for Imperata control, is now known by almost 100 000 farmers. The regular use for soil fertility enhancement is, however, hampered by the lack of known uses for mucuna products. We developed recently a farmer-applicable detoxifying method for mucuna seeds, allowing incorporation of protein-rich mucuna flour into main staple dishes in Benin. We highlight the essential impact of farmer interaction on the course of experimentation, results and adoption.

AB  - An experiment was conducted during 1991-96 to identify suitable tree species to plant on farm bund and also to screen tree species for live bund on Vertisols. Among 7 tree species planted on farm bund, the maximum plant height was found with subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) (7.60 m), followed by siris (Albizzia lebbeck Benth.) (7.01 m) and the least in anjan (Hardwickia binata Roxb.) (4.20 m). The grain yield of arable crop, viz. sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] was highest (1,186 kg/ha) when it was grown with Hardwickia binata and minimum when it was grown with leucaena leucocephala (425 kg/ha). In another study (1992-95) screening of 6 different tree species for live bund was taken up. Among the different tree species, the maximum green-biomass yield was recorded in Gliricidia maculata (H.B. & K.) Steud. (45.64 q/ha) and the minimum in Albizzia amara Boiv. (9.69 q/ha). The grain yield of arable crop, viz. safflower (Cartharmus tinctorius L.), was highest when safflower was grown with Gliricidia as live bund (7.66 q/ha) and the lowest with Leucaena leucocephala (3.87 q/ha).

AB  - Nodulation, nitrogen fixation and growth in seedlings of a Senegalese provenance of Acacia nilotica subsp. tomentosa, inoculated with eight different Rhizobium strains isolated from various African Acacia species, were measured. The Rhizobium strains were markedly different in their ability to induce functional nodules suggesting, in view of previous reports of cross-inoculation studies, that strain specificity at subspecies and/or provenance level may occur in A. nilotica. Three strains isolated from Acacia species other than A. nilotica were non-invasive. Of two strains isolated from A. nilotica subsp. kraussiana, one strain induced formation of ineffective nodules, while the other induced formation of effective nodules displaying a mean acetylene reduction rate, on nodules from 10-week-old seedlings, of 57.7 μmol g-1 h-1. This is more than ten times higher than previously reported for an unspecified subspecies of A. nilotica in a field trial in India and compares favourably with results reported from other nitrogen-fixing tree species widely promoted for use in agroforestry such as Leucaena leucocephala. Three re-inoculated strains induced the formation of partially effective nodules. Seedlings with effective nodules had 50% larger dry mass and more than double the total nitrogen content of non-nitrogen fixing seedlings. Variability in total dry weight, nodule dry weight and total nitrogen content of effectively nodulated seedlings were high and strongly positively correlated (r= 0.88 to 0.99) indicating considerable potential to improve initial growth rates and nitrogen fixation in A. nilotica through selection.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted in the dryland farming area of northwest Venezuela in order to evaluate three diets in grazing goats (T1: Cenchrus ciliaris only; T2: grazing pasture + 0.3 kg of commercial concentrate/animal/day; T3: grazing pasture + restricted grazing for 2 hours daily in Leucaena leucocephala) on growth rate of goats. The experiment was laid out as randomized complete block design. The data showed significant differences (P < 0.01) between treatments. Supplement goats had higher growth rates (P < 0.01). Daily gains were 58.2, 50.3 and 23.2 g for animals on treatments T2, T3 and T1, respectively. The results suggest that L. leucocephala can supply an adequate amount of nutrient with similar value to commercial concentrate with 20% of crude protein for goats consuming tropical pastures.

AB  - The feed value of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) crop residues were evaluated on growing male landim goats tethered on native pasture during the 1992 and 1993 dry seasons in semi-arid Southern Mozambique. Treatments were native pasture alone as a control, native pasture+cowpea residue ad libitum and native pasture+groundnut residue ad libitum. During the second year, treatments with (0.5% liveweight (LW) on dry matter (DM) basis) or without fresh leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) leaves were superimposed on the three treatments. During the 1993 dry season, both the cowpea and the groundnut groups gained more weight (p=0.0002) than the control group. The situation changed in 1993, a year with dry season rains. The unsupplemented group lost weight only in November and only during this period did some positive effect of supplementation occur. Over the season, there was no effect (p=0.48) of either residue or leucaena supplementation. The ammonia-nitrogen concentrations in the rumen fluid of the control group, measured in the 1993 dry season, were depressed by the inclusion of groundnut hay and increased by cowpea supplementation. Leucaena also depressed the ruminal NH3 in the crop residue diets but increased NH3 in the control group. The conclusion was that residue supplementation during the dry season was beneficial during a dry year. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Variation in performance of several Eucalyptus species/provenances/land races, Casuarina equisetifolia, Leucaena leucocephala and Senna siamea was evaluated in two 14—year old trials planted at Michafutene, Mozambique. At the age of 6, 10, and 14 years, data were collected of survival, breast height diameter, height and stem form. Wood basic density was only measured at the final assessment occasion. Significant differences between species, provenances and land races were found in survival, growth and stem form. Wood basic density was not significantly different between species, provenances and land races. Overall, growth of Eucalyptus species/provenances from the natural range (Queensland, Australia) was found to be superior to that of sources (land races) form Brazil, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The performanance of C. equisetifolia, L. leucocephala and S. siamea land races was also poor. The following outstanding species and provenances are recommended for planting at Michafutene and similar sites: E. tereticornis (ex. S. Helenvale), E. brassiana (ex. SE Coen), E. cloeziana (ex. Stannary Hills) and E. camaldulensis (ex. Petford). For E. cloeziana, testing of additional provenances is recommended since only one provenance was tested in these trials. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of maize, sunflower and soybean intercropping at leucaena sowing on the establishment of this species, the recovery of star grass and grain yield of the intercropped seasonal cultures was studied. A random block design with 4 replications was used. Treatments were: leucaena sown alone or intercropped with 1 or 3 furrows between a double row with maize, sunflower or soybean after a conventional soil preparation. At 35 days of sowing the number of plants/m2 of leucaena was similar in all treatments (5-6 plants/m2). In the cultures, this measurement varied according to the species, being greater (P < 0.001) in soybean when 3 furrows between double rows of leucaena were sown. Yield (t/ha DM), height, leaves and stems/leucaena plants were not affected by the intercropped species 120 days after sowing. The best grain yield was obtained when 3 furrows of soybean between double rows of leucaena (0.72 t/ha) were intercropped. Sunflower contributed 1.95 t/ha of DM of harvest residues which differed (P < 0.05) from the remaining treatments. At the end of the experiment, 11 months after sowing, leucaena yield (1.95 t/ha DM) was higher (P < 0.05) when one furrow of sunflower was intercropped and lower (0.64 t/ha) when 3 furrows of sunflower were sown. The highest yield (P < 0.05) of star grass (2.6 t/ha DM) was attained when 1 or 3 furrows of soybean were intercropped and the lowest was when 3 furrows of sunflower were intercropped between double rows of leucaena (1.4 t/ha DM). It was concluded that the contribution to grain production when 3 furrows of maize or soybean are intercropped is an option to decrease the establishment costs of leucaena and star grass. Soybean had a higher contribution to grain production and it favoured or did not affect biomass production of leucaena and star grass. A single row of sunflower also improved leucaena yield.

AB  - Microarthropods, such as soil mites (Acari) and springtails (Collembola), with body width between 0.08 mm and 0.5 mm play important roles in soil fertility maintenance through their regulatory activities in decomposition and nutrient turnover. Observations were made at IITA, Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria to evaluate the effects of natural regrowth of vegetation - mainly the shrub Chromolaena odorata - and three planted woody fallow species (Acacia leptocarpa, Senna siamea, and Leucaena leucocephala) on soil microarthropods in a degraded Alfisol. Populations of soil microarthropods were higher in the rainy season than the dry season, and populations were greater under natural fallow than for continuous cropping with maize (Zea mays) and cassava (Manihot esculenta). Populations of soil microarthropods were comparable under leucaena and natural fallow, but populations in the rainy season were 38% higher under senna than natural fallow and 36% higher under acacia than natural fallow. Regression analysis indicated that soil microarthropod population under fallow species was positively correlated with the lignin contents of leaf litter.

AB  - In vitro shoot bud regeneration via callogenesis was achieved from hypocotyl explants of Leucaena leucocephalla (K8) collected from both contaminated (chromium, nickel and zinc) and uncontaminated sites. The proliferated calli raised from hypocotyl were tested in vitro for their relative tolerance to chromium, nickel and zinc. The calluses derived from contaminated sources were tolerant to metal and showed better growth on MS basal medium supplemented with 1.0 mg l-1 kinetin, 4.0 mg l-1 NAA and either 0.015 mM chromium, 0.13 mM nickel or 0.053 mM zinc than those derived from uncontaminated seeds. The specificity of metal tolerance noted in the parent materials was observed in the calluses. The calli derived L. leucocephalla growing on contaminated soil exhibited higher catalase and peroxidase activities than those from the uncontaminated soil. Biochemical studies provided evidences that plant material from the contaminated sources were physiologically distinct from the uncontaminated ones. This study indicated that seeds of Leucaena leucocephalla collected from contaminated sites were tolerant to chromium, nickel and zinc and may have the advantage of being used in sustainable revegetation programmes on metalliferous minewastes.

AB  - In woodlot and silvopasture experiments involving a total of three age-sequences, the rates of biomass accumulation and nutrient accumulation by multipurpose trees were evaluated. The woodlot experiment included nine multipurpose trees (Acacia auriculiformis, Ailanthus triphysa, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Artocarpus hirsutus, Casuarina equisetifolia, Emblica officinalis, Leucaena leucocephala cv. K8, Paraserianthes falcataria and Pterocarpus marsupium) and the silvopastoral experiment involved a subset of four trees (Acacia auriculiformis, Ailanthus triphysa, Casuarina equisetifolia and Leucaena leucocephala cv. K8). Both plantings were maintained at Thiruvazhamkunnu, Kerala, India. Trees in the woodlot experiment were felled (partially) at 8.8 years of age and that of the silvopastoral experiment both at 5 years and 7 years of age. Rate of biomass accumulation and nutrient accumulation was highest for Acacia and the least for Leucaena. Allometric relationships linking above ground biomass with DBH and/or total height gave reasonable predictions. A comparison between species and among tissue types within species indicated that nutrient use efficiency for N, P and K varied widely. Implications for nutrient export from the site through whole tree harvesting systems involving fast growing multipurpose tree species are discussed.

AB  - A study was conducted for 2 years (1995 and 1996) on productivity of rainfed castor (Ricinus communis L) alley cropped with white popinac [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] with conjunctive application of green leaf manuring and nitrogen. The result showed that the seed yield of castor was significantly higher in alley Cropping of castor 598.9 kg/ha (1995) and 474.5 kg/ha (1996) compared with the sole cropping (473.7 and 265.5 kg/ha during 1995 and 1996 respectively). Incorporation of green leaves of white popinac at 5 tonnes/ha 10 days before sowing of castor increased the seed yield o f castor significantly both in alley cropping (669.4 and 512.5 kg/ha) in 1995 and 1996, respectively and in sole cropping with values of 531.2 kg/ha (1995) and 315.4 kg/ha (1996) over without green leaf manuring. Significantly low seed yield of Castor was noticed at zero and 40 kg N/ha compared with the 80 kg N/ha during 1995 (710.6 kg/ha) and 1996 (384.9 kg/ha). Combined application of green leaves of white popinac with 40 kg N/ha produced significantly more seed yield of castor both in alley cropping with values of 708.3 kg/ha (1995) and 559.3 kg/ha (1996) and sole cropping (575.7 and 318.6 kg/ha during 1995 and 1996 respectively) over separate application of 80 kg N/ha without green leaf manuring. Similar response was observed in dry matter production, crop growth rate and nitrogen uptake of castor tO all the treatments.

AB  - Twenty-five 42-days old New Zealand white rabbits were weaned and accustomed to a control ration in the 1st week and randomly allotted to five groups of five rabbits each. They were offered the control ration (G-1), and in other groups a portion of the control ration was replaced by Leucaena leaf meal (LLM) treated with 1.2% FeCl3 or untreated i.e. 25% LLM (G-2), 50% LLM (G-3), 25% treated LLM (G-4), and 50% treated LLM (G-5) ration in pelleted form in a 8 weeks feeding cum metabolism trial. Average intake of mimosine and 3,4 DHP (dihydroxypyridone) was 304.6 and 129.5; 680.2 and 212.3; 279.6 and 147.6; and 643.1 and 239.9 mg day-1 in G-2-G-5, respectively. Mimosine and 2,3 DHP were not detected in faeces. The faecal excretion of 3,4 DHP (as % intake of mimosine plus 3,4 DHP) in the rabbits of groups G-4 (43.5) and G-5 (40.6) was significantly (P<0.05) higher due to FeCl3 treatment as compared to excretion in groups G-2 (30.1) and G-3 (21.4) fed untreated LLM. GOT (Glutamic oxalacetic transaminase), GPT (Glutamic-pyruvic transaminase), T3 (tri-iodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine) levels in blood were within normal physiological range. Mimosine 3,4 DHP and 2,3 DHP, all were excreted through urine. The urinary excretion of 3,4 DHP was significantly lower (P<0.05) in G-4 and G-5. The overall excretion of DHP (2,3 and 3,4 DHP) was similar in all the groups. Severe hepatic and kidney damage occured in G-2 and G-3, while, in G-4 and G-5 very mild or no damage to liver and kidney was recorded. All tissues were devoid of mimosine, but DHP was present in liver, kidney and lungs. The maximum DHP in liver indicated as the primary site of DHP metabolism. In vitro incubation of LLM with caecal contents revealed 72.68-100% microbial degradation of mimosine. The overall DHP degradation ranged from 7.10% to 37.81% being the highest in G-3. The results indicated that, FeCl3 treated leucaena could be used in commercial meat rabbit rations. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The introduction of mimosine detoxifying microbes to the rumens of African livestock eliminates the need to restrict the levels of Leucaena leucocephala in their diet to avoid mimosine toxicity. The performance of weaned Boer goats, which were inoculated with mimosine-detoxifying microbes, browsing stands of both L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham and var. Spectra was studied over 2 seasons. Goats were stocked at 8.6, 15 and 20 goats/ha for 120 days in 1994-95, and 11.5, 15, and 20 goats/ha for 140 days in 1995-96. No obvious signs of mimosine toxicity were visible during the trial. Weight gains were positive, except during the period immediately after the goats were introduced to the trial in 1994 and after short periods off the trial in the mid-summer of both seasons, necessitated by drought- and hail-induced defoliation of the leucaena trees. The mean individual animal performance over both years and leucaena types was 87±6.4 g/d, with gains approaching 200 g/d at times. There were no differences (P>0.05) in gain per animal between leucaena types or stocking rates. Therefore, gain per hectare increased with increasing stocking rate, resulting in a significantly (P<0.05) greater gain per hectare at the high stocking rate than at the lowest rate in both seasons, for both leucaena types. In total; over the whole experimental period, the high stocking rate treatment produced 82 kg/ha more live mass than the low stocking rate treatment in 1994-95 (over 98 days) and 85 kg/ha more live mass in 1995-96 (over 126 days). The productivity of Boer goats browsing leucaena could possibly be improved by providing a mineral supplement and a high energy base fodder (e.g. grass), as leucaena foliage is inherently low in phosphorus, sodium and digestible energy.

AB  - A study was made on the effects of landfill gas on ARA (acetylene reducing activity) of nodules of two woody legumes (Acacia confusa and Leucaena leucocephala) widespread on landfill sites in Hong Kong. The effects of the three main components of landfill gas, O2, CO2 and CH4, were first measured separately over a 1-hr period. Maximum ARA was found at 20% O2 (close to atmospheric partial pressure) and ARA decreased as the O2 decreased in the range of 16-1%. Acacia confusa nodular ARA was significantly inhibited at 30-50% CO2, but not Leucaena leucocephala nodular ARA. CH4 had no significant effect on ARA of either species. As the landfill gas concentrations in the landfill topsoil were mostly > 10% 02 and < 10% CO2, root nodules should fix N2 effectively over these ranges of gases. A four- week test was conducted to assess the long-term influence of landfill gas on seedlings of the two legumes. Landfill gas and elevated CO2 both suppressed their growth and their nodular ARA. Even under the influence of the gases, however, seedlings with nodules formed a higher biomass than seedlings lacking nodules. The growth of the two legumes under actual landfill conditions was investigated by transplanting non-inoculated and pre- inoculated seedlings to two landfill sites in Hong Kong: Junk Bay and Shuen Wan Landfill. After six months, most of the non-inoculated seedlings became infected: Acacia confusa 63 and 70%, Leucaena leucocephala 17 and 89%, respectively, at the test sites. The results indicate that there were free rhizobia at these landfill sites to infect the legumes and they had formed effective nodules to fix N2 under landfill conditions.; A study was made on the effects of landfill gas on ARA (acetylene reducing activity) of nodules of two woody legumes (Acacia confusa and Leucaena leucocephala) widespread on landfill sites in Hong Kong.

AB  - This study examined the effect of alley cropping of Leucaena leucocephala and Faidherbia albida on wood biomass, maize grain yield and soil nitrogen status. The treatments were: trees planted alone at 1 x 5 m spacing; trees intercropped with maize and a sole maize crop. Mulch biomass averaged 6.18 and 0.97 t ha-1 for L. leucocephala and F. albida, respectively. Corresponding wood production was 1.71 and 1.11 t ha-1. Both total N and inorganic N (NO3--N plus NH4+-N) were higher under F. albida and lowest under L. leucocephala. Similarly, foliar N concentration in maize was higher in plots intercropped with F. albida and least in L. leucocephala intercropping. Maize grain yield was little affected by the tree intercrop as competition for resources was reduced through periodic pruning and clean weeding. There was no gain in maize grain yield due to the presence of L. leucocephala and F. albida. These results suggest that alley cropping in Gario is justified for wood production but not for increasing maize grain yield.

AB  - A laboratory experiment was carried out to assess nitrogen (N) mineralization of roots of four woody agroforestry species (Dactyladenia barteri, Senna siamea, Gliricidia sepium, and Leucaena leucocephala) and maize (Zea mays). Addition of Gliricidia and Leucaena roots with high N contents and low carbon (C)-to-N ratio (≤14.0) resulted in net N mineralization, while the addition of maize roots with low N and high C-to-N ratio (40.3) immobilized N. Addition of Dactyladenia and Senna roots with intermediate N content and C-to-N ratio immobilized N to a lesser extent. Nitrogen mineralization was negatively and significantly correlated with C- to-N ratio of the added roots. Addition of roots of the five species also differentially affected soil pH during the first 12 weeks of incubation. Soil pH was positively and significantly correlated with the roots initial C-to-N ratio and negatively correlated with their initial N content. At 24 weeks of incubation, the pH of all treatments reverted to initial value.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a fast‐growing tree that can provide both high quality forage and firewood. The objective of this trial was to determine the optimum height and frequency of cutting for both wood and forage production. Cutting heights at 0.3 m, 0.6 m and 1.0 m were superimposed on 3‐month and 6‐month cutting frequencies on mature rows of L. leucocephala for three years. Effects of year or its interaction with the other factors were not significant (P≥0.10). There was an increase (P=0.07) in wood production but not forage production (P≥0.10) with the longer interval. Cutting height had an effect on forage (P<0.001) production, with 5.47 t ha−1 a−1 for the 0.3‐m height, 7.62 t ha−1 a−1 for the 0.7‐m height, and 8.71 t ha−1 a−1 for the 1.0‐m height. Cutting height also had an effect on wood production (P<0.001), with 7.22 t hd−1 a−1 for the 0.3‐m height, 9.33 t ha−1 a−1 for the 0.7‐mheight, and 11.55 t hd−1 a−1 for the 1.0‐m height. In this experiment, the six‐month interval produced more wood than the three‐month interval, but there were no differences in quantity of forage dry matter in L. leucocephala; there were advantages in both wood and forage production with the taller trunk base. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Samples of two grass species (Pennisetum purpureum, Trypsacum laxum) and four multipurpose tree leaves (Leucaena leucocephala, Calliandra calothyrsus, Sesbania sesban, Gliricidia sepium) from the Western Highland of Cameroon were tested using nylon bag and in vitro gas production techniques. The two grasses were of similar chemical composition and degradation characteristics. Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania sesban had the highest potential in sacco degradability and Calliandra calothyrsus the lowest. Although the in vitro fermentation failed to rank the browse species in the same order, there was a high positive correlation (r2 = 0.74) between the 48 h nylon bag degradation and the 48 h gas production. The in vitro degradation of Calliandra calothyrsus was unexpectedly low as compared to the in sacco potential degradability of the plant.

AB  - Young Landim wethers were either free-range or tethered on 3-m ropes on native pasture in semi-arid Southern Mozambique. A leucaena leaf supplement at 2% BW (DM basis) was given to half of the animals. The experiment took place over the dry season of 2 years with very different rainfall (327 mm and 723 mm). There was no interaction (P > 0.05) between physical restriction and supplementation for average daily gain (ADG) or carcass characteristics in either year. In the drier year restriction lowered ADGs to 18.6% of the unrestricted animals' ADG (P = 0.0018). In the wetter year this same effect resulted in ADGs in the tethered animals of 36.9% of the free-range animals' ADG (P = 0.001). Goats supplemented with leucaena gained 184% of the BW gained by the unsupplemented animals in the low-rainfall year (P = 0.0038) and 168% in the high-rainfall year (P = 0.001). Carcass % of BW as well as kidney, heart, carcass and liver masses were higher and digestive tract % of BW were lower in free-range animals (P < 0.05) only in the high-rainfall year. Carcass and kidney weights were higher (P < 0.05) in the drier year and liver higher (P < 0.05) during both years for the supplemented animals. Tethering appeared to affect goat development negatively, especially in the dry year, whereas supplementation with leucaena was equally beneficial in dry and wet years.

AB  - Bioassays were carried out to identify and characterize the allelopathic potential effects of forage legumes "leucena" (Leucaena leucocephala), "mineirão" (Stylosanthes guianensis cv. Mineirão) and "calopogônio" (Calopogonium mucunoides) on germination and radicle elongation of the pasture weeds "desmódio" (Desmodium adscendens), "guanxuma" (Sida rhombifolia) and "assa-peixe" (Vernonia polyanthes). Aqueous seeds and shoot extracts were prepared in a concentration of 10% (w/v). The pH and osmotic potential were measured in each extract. The effects of the osmotic potential on the results were calculated considering the regression equations adjusted to the variations of osmotic potential in each parameter and the osmotic potential of the extracts. The results showed that the pH did not constitute in a source of variation of the results. The donor species indicated allelopathic potential that varied in function of donor and receiver species and part of the donor plant. The aqueous shoot extract of "mineirão" and "calopogônio" showed inhibition potential higher than the extract from seeds, while for leucena the effects more evident were obtained with the extract from seeds. Comparatively, the radicle elongation was a more sensitive indicator than germination to the effects of the extracts.The receiver species "assa-peixe" was the less sensitive to the effects of the extract.

AB  - Introduction of the subcloned nodO gene of Rhizobium sp. BR816 into R. meliloti 1021, R. leguminosarum by. trifolii ANU843, and Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571 significantly stimulated nodulation and infection of Leucaena leucocephala by these transconjugants. The BR816 nodO gene was also shown to suppress the nodulation defect of the nodU mutants of Rhizobium sp. NGR234 and R. tropici CIAT899 on L. leucocephala and of the node mutant of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii ANU843 on white clover. Over-production of NodO in BR816 extended its host range to Trifolium repens. While a Rhizobium sp. BR816 strain, mutated in nodO, had reduced nodulation and competitiveness on P. vulgaris, no altered phenotype was observed for this mutant on L. leucocephala. Analysis of the transcriptional activation of nodO in BR816 revealed enhanced expression in the presence of apigenin, under both aerobic and microaerobic conditions. Moreover, nodO was also expressed in the bacteroids of L. leucocephala nodules.

AB  - A ten-year-study (1983 to 1992) conducted on nine 15 x 90 m runoff plots at 4% slope compared production efficiency of Leucaena leucocephala and Eucalyptus hybrid based agroforestry as well as monocropping landuse systems in the warm, subhumid climate of the western Himalayan region of India. Treatments for the first sequence were: monocropping systems of leucaena, eucalyptus, Chrysopogon fulvus grass and maize- wheat rotation, and alley cropping systems of grass and crops at 4.5 and 10.5 m alley widths with paired contour tree rows of leucaena and eucalyptus. In the second sequence, alley width increased to 22.5 m in 1989, grass was replaced by turmeric Curcuma longs and paired contour rows of leucaena hedges were introduced in monocropping systems of grain crops and turmeric. Integration of leucaena and eucalyptus trees with crops caused severe reduction of crop yields ranging from 21 to 92% for wheat grain, 59 to 69% for maize grain, 60 to 67% for dry grass and about 50% for turmeric rhizome depending upon the age of trees and alley width. The grain yield of crops stabilized at about 50% reduction with 22.5 m alley width. Total crop biomass (grain + straw) also revealed a similar trend; however, its magnitude of reduction was less severe than for grain. Production of biomass was much lower near the tree rows than in mid alleys. Managing leucaena as contour hedgerows eliminated crop yield reduction in alleys. Performance of grass and turmeric in alleys was not found to he satisfactory. Biomass produced from trees adequately compensated the crop yield reduction. Land equivalent ratios of agroforestry landuses were comparable or even better than monocropping systems indicating suitability of these systems for the western Himalayan valley region.

AB  - Conversion of tropical forest ecosystems to agricultural land use can have drastic impact on quality of natural waters as related to temporal changes in the sediment load and concentrations of dissolved nutrients. Long-term experiments were conducted in two phases to assess seepage and runoff water quality changes from an Alfisol owing to changes in land use in a sub-humid region of southwestern Nigeria. Phase I, from 1978 to 1981, studied the impact of deforestation and tillage methods, and Phase II, from 1982 to 1987, evaluated the impact of cropping systems and soil restorative practices. The six treatments evaluated in Phase I, involving combination of deforestation and tillage methods, were: (I) manual clearing (MC) with no-till (NT); (2) MC with plow-till (PT), which involved plowing to about 20 cm depth followed by harrowing; (3) shear blade (SB) clearing with NT; (4) treepusher-rootrake (TP) clearing with NT; (5) TP clearing with PT; (6) traditional farming (TF) involving slash-and-burn agriculture without use of fertilizer and amendments. The TF treatment was discontinued during Phase II. Therefore, the five treatments evaluated in Phase II were: (1) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit planted on the contour at 4 m interval; (2) restorative fallowing with mucuna (Mucuna utilis Lam.) on severely degraded soil; (3) mucuna fallowing on moderately degraded watersheds; (4) ley farming, involving establishment of pastures and grazing, on severely degraded watersheds; (5) ley farming on moderately degraded watersheds. Pastures included a mixture of Guinea grass (Panicum maximum Jacq.) and centro (Centrosema pubescens Benth). All treatments were imposed on watersheds of 2-4 ha each, and were replicated twice. Each watershed was equipped with a rate measuring H-Flume, a water stage recorder, a runoff sampler and a storage tank. In addition, a single lysimeter was installed in each treatment to monitor crop water use and nutrient transport in seepage water. Sediment concentration in water runoff was measured for both phases whereas nutrient concentrations in runoff and seepage waters were measured in Phase II only. Land clearing and tillage methods affected sediment concentration in runoff water. Mean sediment concentration during the first season after deforestation was 5.5 g l-1 for MC and 9.7 g l-1 for TP. Within the NT system, mean sediment concentration was 4.0 g l-1 for MC. 3.9 g l-1 for SB, and 8.0 g l-1 for TP. Sediment concentration was also low for NT compared with PT. 5.3 g l-1 vs 9.1 g l-1. Alley cropping decreased sediment concentration under maize (Zea mays L.) from 2.5 g l-1 to 0.44 g l-1. Mean sediment concentration was 4.3 g l-1 under maize and 0.2 g l-1 under cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) with alley cropping, compared with 1.4 g l-1 under maize and 0.04 g l-1 under cowpea grown after pastures. There were seasonal and cropping system effects on sediment concentration. Both alley cropping and mucuna cover decreased sediment concentration. Nutrient concentration in runoff was influenced by cropping systems treatments, and was higher without than with alley cropping. Although the total runoff was less, nutrient concentration was greater in water runoff from pastures and mucuna fallow than from maize. The maximum nutrient concentrations were much higher in seepage water than in surface runoff. Manual clearing, no-till, alley cropping and use of cover crops decreased transport of sediments and dissolved elements in surface runoff and seepage water.

AB  - Seasonal variations in the feeding behaviour of Jamunapari and Barbari goat breeds and their utilization of browse and grass nutrients was evaluated in a promising 3-tier (Leucaena leucocephala- Dichrostachys nutan-Cenchrus ciliaris) reconstituted pasture during summer, rainy and winter season of the years 1987 and 1988. Distinct diurnal pattern of feeding was observed with both the breeds. Jamunapari goats spent significantly more time foraging during winter season (352.0 min) followed by summer (306.0 min) and least in rainy season (277.0 min). Though no significant difference was observed in the relative time spent by Barbari goats on grazing activities during summer and winter season, they spent significantly more (p < 0.05) time during rainy season as compared to other two seasons. The preference of grazing goats for certain plant species in relation to others was evident with distinct seasonal and breed variations. DM intake (g/kg BW0.75) varied significantly (p < 0.05) from season to season. Among the browse. L. leucocephala was prefered over D. nutan irrespective of breed over the seasons. There was no breed difference in DM intake, or proximate composition and nutrient digestibility of ingested herbage. The available nutrient content of ingested forage was found sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of adult goats for maintenance (NRC, 1981). The reconstituted 3-tier pasture dominated by plant species like L. leucocephala and Cenchrus species appear to have great potential to sustain the nutrient requirement of goats without adverse seasonal fluctuations in pasture quality.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) is most preferred by development workers for agroforestry in the mid-altitude (600-1600 m) agro-ecological zone of North-West Cameroon because its seeds are common and inexpensive. This study was prompted by farmers' reluctance to accept leucaena for agroforestry because its early growth is poor on acid infertile soils prevalent in the area. Leucaena was planted using four-month-old potted plants and, from four months after planting, the shrub was cut five times in 20 months at 120 day intervals. Manuring improved leucaena's growth and biomass at sites with acid and non-acid soil alike. Total biomass responded linearly (R2= 0.97) to manure rates at the acid and infertile site and curvilinearly (R2 = 0.95) at the non-acid site. Total leafy biomass from the first cut and subsequent prunings was highest at 12 months after planting. Manuring increased rooting depth and this contributed to the plant's observed ability to cope with moisture stress during the dry season. The economics of manure use for tree establishment on acid infertile soils for agroforestry systems needs further study.

AB  - Samples and extracts of foliage from African multipurpose trees were screened for their effects on rumen protozoa and bacteria with a view to predicting their safety as feed supplements and for identifying species with potential antiprotozoal activity. The species tested were Acacia aneura, Chamaecytisus palmensis, Brachychiton populneum, Flindersia maculosa, Sesbania sesban, Leucaena leucocephala and Vernonia amyedalina. Antimicrobial effects were mild except for S. sesban, which was highly toxic to rumen protozoa in vitro, and A. aneura, which was toxic to rumen bacteria. The antiprotozoal factor in S. sesban was apparently associated with the fraction of the plant containing saponins. When S. sesban was fed to sheep, protozoal numbers fell by 60% after 4 d, but the population recovered after a further 10 d. In vitro experiments demonstrated that washed protozoa from later times were no more resistant to S. sesban than on initial exposure, suggesting that other micro-organisms, probably the bacteria, adapted to detoxify the antiprotozoal agent. Thus S. sesban may be useful in suppressing protozoa and thereby improving protein flow from the rumen, but only if the bacterial metabolism of the antiprotozoal factor can be avoided.

AB  - The role of microarthropods in leaf decomposition and N release was studied in various land-use practices: secondary forest, bush regrowth, Pueraria phaseoloides relay cropping, Leucaena leucocephala alley cropping, and cropping without cover crop or tree hedgerows (control treatment), using litterbags with mesh-size of 0.5 mm and 0.08 mm for 98 days. Litterbags with 0.5 mm mesh-size allowed access by microarthropods, whereas those with 0.08 mm mesh-size excluded microarthropods. Microarthropod-mediated leaf decomposition and N release varied with the land-use practices, particularly the last named. Inclusion of microarthropods in most cases increased leaf decomposition and N release rates, with the highest value 38 % for decomposition in control treatment and 29 % for N release in relay cropping. A decrease in leaf decomposition rate (10 %) and N release (32 %) was observed in the secondary forest. Microarthropod-mediated leaf decomposition and N release, which mainly occurred in later stages of decomposition, increased as microbial decomposition decreased. The results suggest that microarthropods have a 'buffering effect' in regulating leaf decomposition and N release, which is mediated by land-use history.

AB  - The effect of maize-leucaena agroforestry system on the abundance and activity of natural enemies of maize stem borers was evaluated. The study covered 6 cropping seasons from September 1992 to August 1995 and was conducted at both Mtwapa and Amoyo in coastal and western Kenya, respectively. Treatments included monocropped and intercropped (maize [Zea mays], leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala]) plots, weeded and unweeded, mulched and unmulched plots, and 3 spacing regimes (1.5, 2.25, 3.0 m) for leucaena hedgerows. Maize was interplanted at the onset of each rainy season. Rates of egg parasitism by Trichogramma sp. and Telenomus sp. were not affected by intercropping, but decreased with increased hedgerow spacing. Significantly more egg batches were preyed upon in the maize monoculture plots. Parasitoids recovered included the larval parasitiods Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron), Cotesia flavipes Cameron, Cotesia rufricus (Haliday), Glyptapanteles africanus (Cameron), Goniozus indicus Ashmead, Chelonus curvimaculatus Cameron, unidentified Cotesia sp. and Syzeuctus sp., the pupal parasitoid Pediobius furvus Gahan, and the hyperparsitoid Aphanogmus fijiensis (Ferrière). Larval and pupal parasitism at Mtwapa were unaffected by the vegetation structure or cultural treatment. However, at Amoyo, the percentage of stem borer larvae and pupae parasitized were significantly greater in the maize monocrop plot than in the intercropped plots, whereas parasitism also significantly increased with increasing hedgerow spacing. However, at both sites, larval and pupal mortality were unaffected by the vegetation structure. The oviposition preference of the predatory Chrysopa species was not influenced by the cropping system.

AB  - A litterbag experiment with Leucaena leucocephala and Senna residues collected during four different pruning activities was carried out in no-tree-control and alley cropping plots Decomposition was followed for 112 days after the respective pruning dates. Other factors studied were 'amount of residue' confined in the litterbags and 'plot management' (cropped or bare plots). The leaf litter of the same species, collected during the different prunings had different qualities. Older Leucaena and Senna residues had a lower N content Older Leucaena residues contained substantially more polyphenols than residues younger than 8 weeks, while 8-week-old Senna residues contained more soluble polyphenols than residues oF 29 weeks. The lignin content of the leucaena residues was greatest for the oldest prunings; while for the Senna residues no clear trend was observed. The decomposition and N release patterns of the four Leucena and Senna pruning residues were different. The first and second prunings decomposed following first order kinetics. For the third pruning, a negative exponential regression procedure against the number of days where rainfall exceeded pan evaporation ('rainy days') yielded a better fit than against time. Less than 10% of the dry matter of the fourth pruning decomposed after 112 days. Significant correlations were found between the decomposition rate calculated against the number of 'rainy days' and the N content, the C-to-N ratio and the (lignin + polyphenol)to-N ratio. The N release rate, calculated against the number of 'rainy days' correlated significantly with the polyphenol-to-N and (lignin + polyphenol)-to-N ratios. The presence of a fully established crop increased the decomposition and N release of the residues of the second pruning in the no-treecontrol plots. The amount of residues confined in the litterbags and the presence of a tree canopy had little effect on residue decomposition.

AB  - Four-month old regrowths (leaves, petioles and tender stems) were collected from four leguminous (Calliandra calothyrsus, Cratylia argentea, Erythrina berteroana and Leucaena leucocephala) and four non-leguminous (Guazuma ulmifolia, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Morus alba.and Trichantera gigantea), trees to determine chemical composition and in vitro digestibility (IVDMD). For five of the species (C. calothyrsus, C. argentea, H. rosa-sinensis, M. alba. and T. gigantea) determinations were made of in sacco digestibility using the nylon bag technique in four rumen-fistulated steers in confinement. Crude protein (N*6.25) in dry matter exceeded 18% for all species except G. ulmifolia (11%). In vitro digestibility was greater in the non-leguminous species M. alba, H. rosa-sinensis and T. gigantea (74, 72 and 67%, respectively), than in the other species for which the IVDMD values were in the range 34 to 54%. Rumen dry matter degradability after 96 hours incubation were also highest in the three non-leguminous species which had highest IVDMD (87, 87 y 89%, for M. alba, H. rosa-sinensis and T. gigantea, respectively). The values for digestibility and crude protein content of the three non-leguminous species (M. alba, H. rosa-sinensis and T. gigantea) indicate their high potential as supplements for animals receiving basal diets of low nutritive value.

AB  - A comprehensive study was undertaken to determine the relationship between age and dominant height (tree-site index method) and between site index and site properties (soil-site index method) for Leucaena leucocephala (also locally known as giant ipil-ipil). Development of tree-site index prediction equation was based on temporary sample plots established at sites representing the four climatic types of the Philippines. The variation in tree-site index as explained by age accounted for 66, 82, 88 and 79% for climatic types 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The factors that most influenced soil-site index were depth; phosphorus, magnesium and calcium contents; cation exchange capacity; and pH. The results showed that the tree-site index method was a more practical method to use than the soil-site index method.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted during 1994-95 and 1995-96 to evaluate some locally available organic plant residues as supplementary source of nutrients in maize (Zea mays L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori and Paol.) cropping system. Grain yield, nutrients uptake by maize increased significantly with increase in levels of NPK Response to 100% NPK was 1.51 and 1.36 tonnes/ha over control yield of 1.87 and 1.62 tonnes/ha in maize and wheat crops respectively. Integration of 75% N through chemical fertilizers + 25% N through organic sources gave equal yield to 100% NPK in maize. The farmyard manure and white popinac leaves had registered their residual effect on succeeding wheat crop by producing equivalent yield as 100% NPK. Among different organic sources, farmyard manure proved superior to blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.) straw followed by white popinac leaves while wheat straw proved inferior source of N substitution. The water-holding capacity, organic carbon, available nitrogen and phosphorus increased with increase in the organic residues while available K and bulk density decreased. The values were more evident in integration of 50% N from chemical fertilizer + 50% N through organic sources, viz farmyard manure, white popinac leaves and blackgram straw.

AB  - The effect of pruning on the dynamics of N release in the root zone of Albizia lebbeck and Leucaena leucocephala was studied using potted soil and minilysimeters with presterilized sand-medium supplied with N-free nutrient solution. Plants were pruned twice at 11 and 13 months and leachates were collected weekly for 16 weeks starting from first pruning, and analysed for mineral N content. Removal of plant shoots reduced nodule and root biomass by some 30-38% and halved nodule N yields, while total N yields did not differ between pruned and unpruned plants. The dynamics of N nutrient in the rhizosphere was also affected by pruning, irrespective of the growth medium. In soil culture, unpruned plants of both species maintained greater levels of total N in their rhizosphere compared to those that were pruned. In sand culture, nitrate-N was by 66-84% the predominant N form in soil leachate across the two sequential prunings. Over the 16 weeks following these prunings of A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala. cumulative mineral N in both forms was significantly higher in the root zone of unpruned plants, and was consistently greater under rhizobial inoculation. Less mineral N was released into the root zone of each species during the period after the second pruning than after the first one. L. leucocephala released significantly more N than A. lebbeck over the sampling period, but net N release beneath both species was lower than 1%, indicating that tree legumes do not release sizeable proportions of their N into root zone, and that pruning reduces their N release still further.

AB  - Long term incubation studies to determine the nitrogen (N) mineralization rates and kinetics in soils freshly amended with some commonly used green manures such as Sesbania rostrata, Gliricidia maculata, Leucaena leucocephala and Azolla pinnata are scarce. A long term aerobic study was, therefore, conducted by incubating soils freshly amended with the above-mentioned green manures in PVC columns at 35 ± 1°C and with 0.01 Mpa moisture content. The soils were then leached at periodic intervals for up to 36 weeks. The N-mineralization rates were greatest during the first week and decreased with time in all soils. The green manure amended soils leached 247 mg kg-1 more NO3 +NO2-N than the unamended control. In general, the total N mineralized (mean 61%) was almost twice that of net N mineralized (mean 30%) in the amended soils. The percent N mineralized (total and net), however, varied with the nature of green manure incorporated into the soil. It was greatest in the soil amended with sesbania and lowest in the soil amended with azolla. The kinetic parameters derived using the double exponential model indicated that green manure amended soils possessed significantly higher N-mineralization potentials and rate constants compared to the unamended control. The kinetic parameters also varied with the nature of green manure incorporated into the soil. Among the various parameters lignin content, lignin to N ratio and lignin + polyphenol to N ratio of the green manures were the key factors governing the rate of decomposition and subsequent N mineralization from the amended soils.

AB  - Seasonal variation in the feeding behaviour of Jamunapari and Barbari goat breeds and their utilization of browse and grass nutrients was evaluated in a promising three-tier (Acacia nilotica-Leucaena leucocephala-Cenchrus ciliaris) reconstituted pasture during the winter, summer and rainy season of the years 1987, 1988 and 1990. A distinct diurnal pattern of feeding was observed with both breeds, and they spent more time foraging (P < 0.05) during the rainy season (504.9 min) than in the winter (376.5 min) or summer (266.9 min). Preference of grazing goats for certain plant species in relation to others was evident, with distinct seasonal variations. Goats spent more time (52.9-62.0%) on browse during summer and the rainy season, while in winter they spent more of their foraging time on grasses (52.0-61.9%). Among the browse species, A. nilotica was preferred over L. leucocephala in all seasons irrespective of breed. DM intake (g per kg BW0.75) varied widely (P < 0.05) from season to season, with minimal values in summer (49.2-52.8) that increased to 68.5-69.7 in winter and 84.3 in the rainy season. There was no breed difference in DM intake or proximate composition and nutrient digestibility of ingested herbage. Available nutrient content of ingested forage was found to be sufficient to meet nutrient requirements of adult goats for maintenance (NRC, 1981). Reconstituted three-tier pasture dominated by native plant species such as A. nilotica and Cenchrus species appears to have the potential to sustain the nutrient requirements of goats without adverse seasonal fluctuations in pasture quality. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The effects were determined of the inclusion of a legume (Leucaena leucocephala or Stylosanthes guianensis) at the rate of 10, 20 or 40% of the dry matter, as a complement to tropical grass hay containing Cenchrus ciliaris L. and Dicanthium annulatum, on the dry matter intake (DMI), and on in vitro digestibility of the dry matter (DMD), neutral detergent fiber (NDFD), crude protein (CPD) and acid detergent fiber (ADFD). Dry matter and nutrient digestibility was measured with the total collection technique using lambs in individual pens. Dry matter intake was greater (P < 0.05) as the proportion of legume in the diets increased (1.00, 1.30 and 1.46% kg/d at 10, 20 and 40% of legume, respectively). Between the two legume species evaluated, DMI was greater in animals fed with Stylosanthes guianensis (1.30 kg/d) than in animals fed with Leucaena leucocephala (1.16 kg/d). There were significant differences between the legume species in digestibility of the main feed components except crude protein. The mean values obtained for the diets with Leucaena leucocephala and Stylosanthes guianensis were DMD, 61.88 and 59.36; CPD, 71.37 and 70.26; NDFD, 62.57 and 58.33; and ADFD, 47.71 and 41.48%, respectively. There were no effects on digestibility when the legumes were added at 10 or 20% of the dry matter (means: DMD, 59.3; CPD, 70.5; NDFD, 59.1; and ADFD, 43.0%). However, when the legume constituted 40% of the dry matter, there was an increase in DMD (63.8%), NDFD (63.5%) and ADFD (48.6%), but not CPD (71.1%). It is concluded that the utilization of legume species, as a complement to grass in diets for ruminants, can improve the productive performance because of increased intake of total digestible nutrients.

AB  - The seeds of Albizia lebbeck, Leucaena leucocephala and Peltophorum pterocarpum show a high rate of germination in the soil extract of control (campus) as compared to polluted areas (city). Germination percentage was lowest in the soil extracts of Gumminder and M. A. Jinnah road. The seedling length of A. Lebbeck and P. pterocarpum was not significantly altered by the soil extract of city areas, whereas L. leucocephala showed significant results. Reduction in root length was high in P. pterocarpum; similarly, it also showed a reduction in dry weight. This would indicate that P. pterocarpum was found to be the most susceptible species to automobile pollution. It showed reduction in germination, root and seedling length and biomass production. Tolerance of this species was also lowest as compared to other species.

AB  - A greenhouse experiment was undertaken to evaluate the influence of prestorage drying treatments and duration of storage on the effectiveness of root inoculum of Glomus aggregatum. Conditions under which roots were dried prior to storage had little or no effect on the level of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) effectiveness measured in terms of pinnule phosphorus (P) content of Leucaena leucocephala leaves after the first 14 days of storage. As duration of storage was further prolonged the time required by root inocula for initiating AM effectiveness and attaining peak levels of effectiveness was progressively prolonged relative to that required by the crude inoculum. However, the two sources of inoculum had similar peak AM effectiveness in many instances. Roots dried in the greenhouse or in the oven at 40°C were significantly inferior to that dried at 60°C. Root inocula stimulated growth of the indicator plant to the same extent as the crude inoculum after 14 days of storage. However, the effectiveness of root inocula in stimulating growth declined with further increase in duration of storage. Among root inocula tested, that dried at 60°C prior to storage was relatively more effective than that dried in the greenhouse or in the oven at 40°C. The overall inferiority of root inocula to that of the crude inoculum appears to be related to loss of viability of root inocula with increase in duration of storage.

AB  - The effect of tannins in browse supplements on intake, digestibility and live weight changes was evaluated using sixty-six male Ethiopian Menz sheep in a 90-day trial. Teff straw (Eragrostis tef) was fed ad libitum (control diet), or supplemented with 190 g dried leaves of six Sesbania sesban accessions with increasing levels of condensed tannin (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6), lablab (Dolichos lablab), tagasaste (Chamaecytisus palmensis), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and goetzei (Sesbania goetzei), in a completely randomized block design. The condensed tannins were highest in goetzei, S6, S5 and leucaena, intermediate in S4, S3, S2 and S1, and lowest in tagasaste and lablab. The forages differed significantly (P < 0.05) in their rates of degradation and truly undegradable dry matter. Lablab had lower water solubility and higher (P < 0.05) truly undegradable dry matter than the other browse supplements. With increasing tannin levels among Sesbania accessions, there was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the rate of degradation. Animals supplemented with forage legumes with low condensed tannin levels such as lablab, S1, S2, and S3 had a lower teff straw intake than those on the control diet. The converse was true for those fed with the high tannin supplements such as S4, S5, S6 and goetzei. Supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) increased total dry matter intake and live weight gains (LWG). The animals on the control diet lost weight (-1.9 g/kgW0.75), while the supplemented animals gained between 2.9 and 4.4 g/kgW0.73 daily. Leucaena supplementation promoted higher (P < 0.05) LWG than lablab, S1 and goetzei. With increasing tannin levels among Sesbania accessions, there was an increase (S1 < S2 < S3 < S4) followed by a decrease (S6 > S5 > goetzei) in LWG. The digestibilities of total DM and the supplements did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) between the diets, although the neutral detergent fibre (NDF) digestibility decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with supplementation. The control diet had significantly higher NDF digestibility than the leucaena, S3, S4, S5 and S6 supplemented diets. Results have beneficial attributes at low levels in ruminants. Condensed tannins confer important advantages in ruminant nutrition with respect to the prevention of excessive degradation of protein in the rumen.

AB  - An insect population in a Leucaena plantation intercropped with maize at 15 and 40 days after sowing was studied during establishment. Samples were taken with an entomological net with 60 trappings/sample every two weeks. Contingency tables and proportion comparisons were used for analysing the data. The main insects affecting Leucaena were: Heteropsylla cubana (148-938) and Euxesta stigmatias (9-81)which had a lower incidence in maize and weeds. In maize , insect infestation was negligible and a high population of Doru taeniatum, preying on larvae nymphs (Spodoptera frugiperda) was observed. However in weeds the highest incidence was of Draeculacephala cubana, Hortensia similis, Polymerus cuneatus and Diabrotica balteata. The presence of Mocis latipes was negigible. Regardless the number of insects collected, no important detrimental effect was found in crops. The results demonstrate that there was a greater incidence when plants were intercropped at 15 days and lower at 40 days. It is concluded that on intercropping at 15 days, the number of insects did not damage maize nor Leucaena during establishment and a land use is more efficient.

AB  - An experiment was conducted in 1990 and 1991 at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Nigeria to study the role of earthworms in the decomposition of plant residue mulches with different qualities. Five mulches of Dactyladenia barteri, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala prunings, maize (Zea mays) stover and rice (Oryza sativa) straw, which had a wide range of C-to-N ratio, lignin and polyphenol concentrations were studied. Based on their chemical compositions. Dactyladenia prunings were defined as low-quality mulch, Leucaena and Gliricidia prunings as high quality-mulches, and maize stover and rice straw as intermediate-quality mulches. The mean density of earthworms (Hyperiodrilus africanus and Eudrilus eugeniae) in the experimental plots decreased in the following order: high quality>intermediate quality>low quality mulches. High quality mulch (Leucaena and Gliricidia prunings) supported 54% higher earthworm populations than the (no mulch) control, whereas low-quality mulch (Dactyladenia prunings) only increased earthworm density by 15%, compared to the control in 1990. Plots with Leucaena and Gliricidia prunings had the highest earthworm populations at the initial stage of the experiment, while the other treatments showed increased earthworm numbers at a later stage. Effects of earthworms on mulch decomposition were examined in the field in large pots with or without earthworms (Eudrilus eugeniae). The effects of earthworms were more pronounced for Dactyladenis prunings (low quality), than for Leucaena and Gliricidia prunings (high quality). The results indicate that manipulation of earthworm activity with application of high-and low-quality mulches may improve the synchronization of soil nutrient supply and crop nutrient demand.

The first maize crop recovered 8.6 and 5.2% of the N from leucaena and dactyladenia, respectively, while the two subsequent crops recovered <1%. The cowpea plants in the leucaena and dactyladenia microplots contained 0.5 and 1.1% of the residue N in the first harvest. Sixteen and 9% of the residue N was recovered by the leucaena hedgerow in the first and second pruning following residue application. The dactyladenia hedges recovered maximally 3.1% of the residue N in a single pruning. The total N recovery in the leucaena microplots was ≃90% at 120 and 471 DAA, compared with 56 and 35% in the dactyladenia microplots.

AB  - An experiment was carried out in a slash-and-burn production system in northern Laos to evaluate legume establishment methods and effects of legume species on fallow vegetation, weeds, yield of upland rice, and soil parameters. Cajanus cajan, Calliandra calothyrsus, Crotalaria anagyroides, Flemingia congesta, Leucaena leucocephala, and Sesbania sesban were dibbled separately or mixed with rice. Legume and planting method had no effect on rice yield. Legume establishment was slightly improved and vigor after rice harvest was higher when planted in separate hills. Compared to control (no legume), the above ground fallow biomass observed 13 months after establishment, consisting mostly of Chromolaena odorata, was reduced by 68% with C. anagyroides and by 40% with L. leucocephala, while other species had no effect. Most of the C. cajan and S. sesban plants died. In March 1995, 22 months after planting, the biomass was 0.21, 0.25, 1.62 and 2.56 kg m-2 for F. congesta, C. calothyrsus, C. anagyroides, and L. leucocephala, respectively. Legume species had no effect on rice yield or weed biomass in the rice crop. The species tested can influence fallow vegetation but do not allow for field preparation without burning. Compared to mulching, burning of residue reduced weed biomass by 42%, soil organic C by 9% and the C/N ratio by 6% but increased extractable P by 90% and pH by 8%.

AB  - The study was carried out to investigate the possibility of improving degraded soil conditions of Andigama series by intercropping coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) with Calliandra calothyrsus, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia auriculiformis and Gliricidia sepium. Bulk density was significantly low in NFT interplanted plots followed by improved aeration in AB and B horizons of the soil profile. Total and readily available water fraction was higher in AB and B horizons of calliandra, acacia and gliricidia interplanled plots over control plots due to the increase of organic matter content and root growth. Root growth and proliferation of calliandra in A horizon were predominantly higher than that of leucaena, acacia and gliricidia species. In contrast, gliricidia roots penetrated into B horizon more densely than roots of other species. Better root growth of coconut in A horizon was observed in acacia and calliandra plots than other plots. The total coconut root biomass in AB and B horizons was higher in gliricidia and acacia plots than other species, which accounted for 91% and 0.3% in AB horizon and 21% and 23% in B horizon for gliricidia and acacia, respectively compared to the control. Total root biomass of coconut in calliandra plots was reduced by 5%, and 45% in AB and B horizons respectively. Results indicated that soil physical conditions of Andigama series (gravelly soil) could be significantly improved by interplanting acacia and gliricidia, as indicated by enhanced coconut root growth and proliferation.

Promising feeds included: water plants (duckweed, azolla, Eleocharis dulcis, Blyxa Javenicey, and Sacciolepis indica), natural grasses (Bbrachiaria mutica and Panicum repens), legume tree leaves (Sesbania sesban, Sesbania grandiflora, and Leucaena leucocephala), crop residues and agro-industrial by-products (rice straw, sugarcane tops, maize stover and pine apple peel) and protein and energy-rich supplements (coconut and ground nut cake, rice bran, broken rice and maize). The rumen environment study was a Latin square arrangement with four different diets: rice straw (RS), rice straw and molasses-urea cake (MUC), rice straw, MUC and grass (0.5% body weight), and rice straw and grass (0.5%DM of body weight). The results in the above order of diets were: ruminal NH3-N, 9.17, 13.7, 12.3, 10.2 mg/100ml (SE=1.19, P=0.032); bacteria population, 0.84, 1.01, 1.07, 0.98*109 (SE=0.03, P=0.002); protozoa population 2.49, 3.03, 3.38, 2.84*105 (SE=0.12, P=0.002). Feed intake was 96.0, 99.0, 113 and 109 g DM/W0.75 (SE=2.10, P=0.001), respectively. There was an indication of improvement in feed degradability when the rice straw was supplemented with molasses-urea cake and grass. It is concluded that there is an abundance of local feeds available for buffalo production in the Mekong delta and that supplementation of rice straw with molasses-urea cake and grass has beneficial effects on the rumen environment of swamp buffaloes.

AB  - With the purpose of evaluating the effect of three different levels of fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus on the content of structural and non-structural carbohydrates (SC) in the fine and gross fraction of two ecotypes of Leucaena leucocephala, an assay was carried out in the Municipality of Rosario de Perijá, State of Zulia (Venezuela). The evaluating factor in this research where: two echotypes of Leucaena leucocephala (CIAT 7984 and CIAT 17223), three levels of N (0.30 and 60 Kg N/Ha and three levels of P (0, 75 and 150 Kg.Ha). The plants were harvested at a highth of 30 cm each time which corresponded to the felling and then were separated in two fractions: the fine fraction which were leaves and limbs with a diameter of less that 5 mm and gross fraction formed by limbs with a diameter over 5 mm. The study factors were combined in an arrangement of 32 × 2, generating 18 treatments. The statistical design was that of plots divided in blocks at random with three repetitions. The main parcels where assigned to echotypes and the combinations of fertilization levels to the secondary parcels. The content of SC was affected by the various evaluating dates, registering lower and higher values of 49.69 and 54.78% in the fine fraction and 79.23 and 82.20% in the gross fraction. The different evaluating dates in combination with the nitrogen influence (P <0.05) the content of (CNE) in the fine fraction obtaining the highest value during the month of September with 20.38% for a dosis of N of 60 Kg/Ha. In the gross fraction the interaction echotype x phosphorus was significatively affected (P<0.05) the content of CNE registering the maximum value with the application of 150 Kg/Ha of P to the echotype CIAT 7984.

AB  - Plants in which growth was reduced by low and high Al applications were designated as Al-sensitive plant (Hordeum vulgare) and Al-medium tolerant plants (Leucaena leucocephala, Ischaemum barbatum, Stylosanthes guianensis, and Fagopyrum esculentum), respectively, while plants in which growth was not affected or was stimulated by Al application were designated as Al-tolerant plant (Brachiaria ruziziensis) and Al-stimulated plants (Melastoma malabathricum, Melaleuca cajuputi, Acacia mangium, Hydrangea macrophyila, Vaccinium macrocarpon, Polygonum sachalinense, and Oryza sativa), respectively. Plants tolerant to or stimulated by Al were further classified based on the criteria of Al accumulation: 1) Al-excluders such as M. cajuputi, A. mangium, L. leucocephala, I. barbatum, S. guianensis, and O. sativa, 2) Al root-accumulators such as V. màcrocarpon, B. ruziziensis, and P. sachalinense, and 3) Al-accumulators such as M. malabathricum, H. macrophylla, and F. esculentum. The growth and N, P, and K uptake in M. malabathricum, M. cajuputi, A. mangium, L. leucocephala, H. macrophylla, V. macrocarpon, I. barbatum, P. sachalinense, F. esculentum, and O. sativa were stimulated by Al application, especially P uptake, while in H. vulgare (Al-sensitive plant) they were reduced by Al application. Ca and Mg uptake of many plants was inhibited by Al application, while that of some plants adapted to low pH soils was not affected at all (Ca and Mg: M. cajuputi, H. macrophylla, V. macrocarpon, I. barbatum, and S. guianensis; Mg: B. ruziziensis and P. sachalinense). In M. malabathricum, the relationship between Al and Ca (or Mg) was antagonistic because the Ca and Mg contents decreased by Al application even though dry matter, N, P, and K accumulation was stimulated by Al application. Plants adapted to low pH soils grew poorly in the no-Al treatment. Since the effect of the pH on plant growth was less conspicuous than that of Al, growth stimulation by Al application was ascribed not only to the alleviation of H+ toxicity but also to the increase of root activity such as P uptake. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Shoot formation occurred after 11 and within 21 days in culture; responses depended on species, explant condition and growth regulators. In subculture, single shoots of L. leucocephala and A. visco formed roots (in presence of NAA or IBA) and plantlets (after a second transfer using the same growth medium but without regulators).

AB  - A cosmid from the Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 symbiotic plasmid, containing most of the nodulation genes described in this strain, has been isolated. Although this cosmid does not carry a nodD gene, it confers ability to heterologous Rhizobium spp. to nodulate R. tropici hosts (Phaseolus vulgaris, Macroptilium atropurpureum, and Leucaena leucoephala). The observed phenotype is due to constitutive expression of the nodABSUIJ operon, which has lost its regulatory region and is expressed from a promoter present in the cloning vector. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of the Nod factors produced by this construction shows that is still capable of synthesizing sulfated compounds, suggesting that the nodHPQ genes are organized as an open that is transcribed in a nodD-independent manner and is not regulated by flavonoids.

AB  - Twenty-one shrub legume accessions were grown at 2 sites in Indonesia and 2 in Australia, and repeatedly harvested to estimate leaf and stem production. Two fertiliser treatments (nil and complete) were imposed at each site. There were major effects of fertiliser at the 2 most infertile sites [Silkwood (Australia) and Sembawa (Indonesia)]. No shrub legume entry grew consistently well across sites without fertiliser. Some species did not persist more than one year, but produced quite high yields. These included Cajanus cajan, Codariocalyx gyroides and Sesbania sesban. These species may be of use as protein banks during the establishment of more perennial species. Leucaena leucocephala did not grow well at the 2 most infertile sites, and was badly affected by the leucaena psyllid at both Australian sites. Overall, the highest yielding species were Calliandra calothyrsus, Acacia angustissima, Gliricidia septum, L. diversifolia and L. pallida. There was a good relationship between leaf production of entries at the 2 Australian sites, and between the 2 very acid sites, but only with the fertilised treatment.

AB  - Ileal and total tract nutrient and energy digestibility was studied in pigs fed three diets with increasing levels (0-200 g kg-1) of leucaena meal (LM). The diets contained sugar cane molasses as the major source of energy. The composition of LM on a dry basis, was: 93.9% organic matter, 42.0% crude fibre, 4.14% nitrogen, 16.95 kJ g-1 gross energy. Either at the ileal or at the total tract level, the LM significantly depressed nutrient and energy digestibility. Estimated ileal and total tract nitrogen digestibility of LM was 52.8 and 57.0% respectively indicating an almost zero disappearance of nitrogen from the large intestine. In vitro nitrogen digestibility of LM was 44.2%. Daily ileal and faecal output of both short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and ammonia showed a slight trend to be proportional to the level of LM in the diet. This indicated a rather incomplete disappearance of SCFA and ammonia in the large intestine. At first approach it can be stated that digestibility of OM and CP are not strongly impaired by the introduction of 100 g kg-1 of LM in the diet. It is suggested that methods to improve digestive utilization of nutrients contained in LM must be developed in order to avoid a deterioration of digestive efficiency in pigs fed considerable amounts of LM in the diet. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The response of wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. 'Enkoy') to application of leaf primings of nine agroforestry-tree species was investigated in a field trial and a six-week pot trial. The tree species were Grevillea robusta, Erythrina abyssinica, Gliricidia sepium, Albizia schimperiana, Acacia nilotica, Acacia polyacantha, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena pallida and Entada abyssinica. L. leucocephala, L. pallida, G. sepium and Entada abyssinica proved to be good pruning sources in the pot trial. G. robusta, A. polyacantha, A. nilotica and E. abyssinica had adverse effects on wheat seedlings with increased pruning loads probably due to immobilization processes or allelopathic effects. N and lignin content, C/N ratio, lignin/N ratio, phenolics/N ratio and (phenolics + lignin)/N ratio of the pruning material were all significantly correlated with shoot dry matter production of the wheat seedlings. With the exception of Entada abyssinica, which performed well under field conditions, a similar ranking as in the pot trial was established in the field experiment, but at harvest differences were not as pronounced as in the pot trial. Gliricidia treated wheat produced by far the highest grain yield with 248 g/m2. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Seven hybrid lines of Leucaena leucocephala × L. diversifolia and two control lines of L. leucocephala were compared for their adaptation to acid-soils and tolerance to damage by the psyllid, Heteropsyla cubana, at four locations over two years in Peninsular Malaysia. Primary data on leaf composition and in vitro digestibility (nutrition variables) and secondary data on plant height, stem girth and psyllid damage (agronomy variables) were the measures of performance. Cluster solutions of the nine lines were different within locations, between locations and between years for nutrition and agronomy variables. Controls and hybrids did not cluster separately. Principal component scores of the nine lines gave rank orders which were different by location and by year. No performance trend could be detected between hybrids and controls. The conclusion is that nutritional and agronomic characteristics in Leucaena are independent, soil composition and weather did not consistently affect performance, and evidence is inconclusive as to the benefits of interspecific crossing with L. diversifolia.

AB  - A study was undertaken to assess the effects of levels and timings of incorporation of leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (L.) de Wit] leaf mulch on soil-water use and performance of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown on Dhoolkot silty clay loam soil in submontane northwest India. Air-dried leucaena leaves were applied as a surface mulch, at the rate of 0 (No mulch), 2, 4 and 6 t ha-1 as main plot treatments and its timings of soil incorporation namely: immediately, 15, 30 and 45 days after harvest of maize crop as subplot treatments. Each treatment was replicated four times in a strip-plot design. The results revealed that more moisture was available in mulched surface soil (0-15 cm) at the time of wheat sowing. Application of mulch increased moisture extraction, water use efficiency (WUE), grain and straw yield of wheat crop. Incorporation of leaf mulch at 30 days after harvesting of maize crop conserved more moisture for wheat sowing. This study indicated that optimal mulch application rate was 2 t ha-1 and time of incorporation was at 30 days after maize harvest.

AB  - Seed produced on a single clone of a self-incompatible Leucaena species interplanted with cross compatible pollen donors of another species should theoretically be interspecific hybrid seed. This paper reports on the parentage of seed produced on two clones (K804, K953) of L. pallida produced in two interspecific seed orchards during the first year of growth. Grafting was used to propagate the two L. pallida clones and the interplanted pollen donors including L. leucocephala (K420, K481, K636) and the F1 hybrid KX3 (L. diversifolia K156 x L. leucocephala K636). Seed was produced on L. pallida K804 in one orchard, and on L. pallida K953 in the other orchard. Seeding leaf morphological characteristics including pinnule pairs per pinna, pinnule width and general appearance were used to determine parentage of seed produced on the L. pallida clones in each orchard. L. pallida K804 produced 81% interspecific hybrid seed while L. pallida K953 only produced 27% hybrid seed. These results suggest a breakdown of the gametophytic self-incompatibility mechanism in L. pallida, particularly in the K953 clone. The feasibility and possible improvement to this seed production system are discussed. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Soil samples to a depth of 90 cm were collected in 1996 from adjacent 1 ha paddocks which had either been established to a leucaena-based or nitrogen-fertilised and irrigated pasture system in 1960 at Samford, south-eastern Queensland, to assess the impact of these production systems on soil chemical properties. The chemical properties were compared with those of soil samples collected from the site in 1960. Soil pH under both the nitrogen-fertilised and leucaena-based systems have declined significantly to a depth of 40 cm against that of the soil samples collected in 1960. However, the extent of acidification was higher under the more intensively managed nitrogen-fertilised system compared with the leucaena-based system. The acidification rates for the nitrogen-fertilised and leucaena-based pasture systems over the 36-year period are 5.1 and 1.0 kmol H+/ha.year, respectively, and are similar to values observed under annual pasture systems of temperate southern Australia. Associated with the decline in pH there was a decline in exchangeable Ca2+ in the nitrogen-fertilised system and a corresponding increase in exchangeable acidity. The contribution of the nitrogen cycle to net acidification for the leucaena-based pasture system was estimated to account for 20% of the total net acid addition. This result is discussed in the light of a similar study undertaken in the semi-arid tropics where the contribution of the nitrogen cycle by a similar leucaena-based system was estimated to be 78% of the net acidification.

AB  - The biophysical performance of hedgerow intercropping for soil fertility inprovement was assessed in a farmer-participatory trial in western Kenya over three years. Farmers successfully established dense hedgerows (median 6680 trees ha-1 on plots of 790 m2, but annual yields of hedgerow prunings of Leucaena leucocephala and Calliandra calothyrsus (1-4 t ha-1), were low compared to potentials in the region (48 t ha-1). The hedgerows reduced slopes from 7.2 to 4.5% within alleys (p < 0.01) but had no effect on grain yield over five seasons. Little of the variation in grain yield between hedgerow plots and control plots without hedgerows (adjusted r2 = 11%) and among control plots (adjusted r2 = 29%) could be accounted for by linear regression with measured agronomic and socio-economic variables. Fully researcher-managed trials are recommended for agronomic evaluation of complex agroforestry technologies.

AB  - Seed orchards of Leucaena were established at two experimental sites in Hawaii to produce either triploid or tetraploid interspecific hybrid seed by interplanting clonal self incompatible diploid (L. diversifolia, L. esculenta) or tetraploid (L. pallida) species with self-compatible L. leucocephala lines and the F1 hybrid of L. diversifolia (2n = 4x) x L. leucocephala. The seed parents were grafted onto three seedling rootstocks (L. diversifolia (2x = 4n), shrubby L. leucocephala, and giant L. leucocephala) to compare rootstock effects on scion growth. This paper reports on the effects of rootstock on scion growth during the first year based on total truck cross sectional area, height growth, and crown habit. In the triploid seed orchard, rootstock significantly affected the growth of four of the six clones, while in the tetraploid orchard the growth of two of the five clones was significantly affected by rootstock. Crown habit was independent of rootstock. Our study suggests that rootstock effects depend on the specific scion and rootstock combination, and site. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Faecal excretion and its annual distribution was studied through a completely randomized design with Holstein cows, using Voisin's Rational Grazing (VRG) system in guinea grass likoni (Panicum maximum likoni). A protein bank of Leucaena leucocephala (var Peru) and supplementation with humid Saccharina was used in the dry season. The grazing area has a total stocking rate of 3.9 animals/ha/year. Results show a notable variation of the organic matter distribution in the paddocks, from 40 to 24 t of FM/ha/year, due to the rotations and the grazing intensity. Faecal excretion occurred in 65, 24 and 11% of the grazing area, the shade building and the milking parlour, respectively. There was an inadequate number of faecal excretions for this type of animal, due to animal consumption factors, together with a marked difference within seasons. The area covered by each dung patch was 0.05, 0.09 and 0.11 m2 for those circular, elongated and irregular, while the weight was of 3.5, 2.6 and 1.8 kg MF/dung patch, respectively. It is concluded that under these conditions, the increase in DM consumption is necessary as well as the use of organic matter produced outside the system to correct the non homogeneous distribution of the faecal excretion in the guinea grass likoni area under VRG. Also, possibilities for increasing the time of the animal in the grassland must be created.

The poor growth of leucaena in all treatments, 10 months after sowing, appeared on intercropping in Paspalum with 141 cm of plant height and weight/plant of 30 g DM and 50 leaves/plant, which differ (P <0.05) from treatments with pitilla and guinea grass. The same situation appeared a year after the beginning of grazing where leucaena plants intercropped in pitilla and guinea grass had a higher growth (P <0.01) than with Paspalum, 187 and 175 cm high, a weight/plant of 20.7 and 24.6 g DM and branches/plant of 13 and 21, respectively. The number of plants was only affected (P <0.01) in leucaena intercropped on Paspalum with less than 2 plant/clump and 2 plants in linear m. The costs of preparing the soil and harvesting was $63.34 in all treatments and represented 69.5% of the expense. It is concluded that the type of graminae determines the establishment of leucaena. Furthermore, the growth control of the accompanying grass, together with the soil preparation, are the components determining the establishment costs of Leucaena and it is not advisable to intercrop Leucaena in Paspalum swards.

AB  - In a feeding trial, Jamunapari male kids (18) of about 4 months age were equally divided into two groups of nine animals each. Goats in the experimental group were fed sun-dried pelleted Leucaena leucocephala leaves and those in the control group were offered a conventional diet without Leucaena leaves as per Kearl (1982) recommendations for a period of 6 months. Daily dry matter intake DM/100 kg BW was 3.13 ± 0.04 kg in the Leucaena group and 3.30 ± 0.05 kg in the control. There were significant (p < 0.01) differences in the apparent digestibilities of DM, OM, CP, EE, CF and NFE being lower in the Leucaena group. Contents of digestible crude protein (DCP) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) were 11.40 and 52.20%, respectively, in the Leucaena group and 14.04 and 66.10%, respectively in the control. The nitrogen in the Leucaena group was not well utilized as compared to the control, though kids were in positive nitrogen balance in both the groups. The average daily weight gain of kids on pelleted Leucaena was 29.95 ± 2.60 g as against 42.09 ± 3.24 g observed in the control. The mean DMI/kg LW gain was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the Leucaena group (14.70 ± 0.78 kg) as compared to the control (11.55 ± 0.46 kg). The Hb, BUN, SGOT and SGPT concentrations were statistically similar in both the groups. Histopathological examination of thyroid gland of goats sacrificed at the end of experiment did not reveal any signs of colloidal goitre associated with mimosine toxicity. No significant pathological alterations were observed in vital organs irrespective of dietary treatment. Sundried, pelleted Leucaena foliage appears to be a promising potential feed for growing goats without any significant deleterious effect.

AB  - On a sandy tropical soil, organic materials (prunings of Leucaena leucocephala, Senna siamea and maize stover) with contrasting C/N ratio (13, 18 and 56, respectively) were applied at the rate of 15 t ha-1a-1 in order to increase the amount of soil organic matter. Two light fractions (LF1 = LF > 2 mm and LF2 = 0.25 mm < LF < 2 mm) and the heavy fraction (HF) of the soil organic matter pool were determined by means of a combined density/particle size fractionation procedure and data obtained were related to soil nitrogen mineralization under controlled conditions and to nitrogen uptake by maize under field conditions. Under controlled conditions and when the LF1 fraction was excluded, nitrogen mineralization was found not to be correlated to total organic carbon content in the soil (R2 = 0.02).The Revalue of the linear regression increased considerably, when amount and C/N ratio of the LF2 fraction was taken into account in the regression analysis (R2 = 0.88). Under field conditions, a multiple linear regression with amount and C/N ratio of HF, LF1 and LF2 better explained variation in crop nitrogen content and nitrogen uptake of maize (R2 = 0.78 and 0.94) than a simple linear regression with total organic carbon (R2 = 0.48 and 0.76). The results illustrate the importance of the two light and heavy organic matter fractions for estimating soil nitrogen mineralization. Determination of light and heavy soil organic matter fractions by density/particle size fractionation seems to be a promising tool to characterize functional pools of soil organic matter. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1998.

AB  - There are rumen bacteria capable of degrading toxic dihydroxypyridine compounds derived from mimosine, a non-protein amino acid found in the toxic legume Leucaena leucocephala. Activity of degradation of the metabolite 2,3- dihydroxypyridine (2,3-DHP) can be temporarily or permanently lost. In this study we have determined the extension of bacterial growth and degradation of 2,3-DHP under different conditions. Degradation of 2,3-DHP started once cultures reached late exponential phase, and complete degradation was achieved in 3 days. If additional 2,3-DHP was added to the cultures, complete degradation occurred within the following 12 h. Degradation of the 2,3-DHP occurred in medium (saline) containing either pyruvate, rumen fluid or arginine but not in saline supplemented with volatile fatty acids or vitamins. Strict anaerobic conditions allowed optimal culture growth and degradation of 2,3-DHP. Maintenance of cultures in medium lacking 2,3-DHP for 2 months caused loss of ability to degrade the compound. When cultured again in medium containing 2,3-DHP, cultures grew normally but only regained activity after a time lag of 4 weeks. Plasmids that could carry fundamental activities in the degradation process were not detected. The results of this work are relevant to the conditions of in vitro screening for 2,3-DHP degradation activity in rumen contents and manipulation of 2,3-DHP degrading cultures in the laboratory.

AB  - The chloroform soluble (CS) and ethyl acetate (ES) soluble alkaloidal extracts from the seeds of Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (de Witt) were tested for their analgesic, anthelminthic, mutagenic, antimutagenic and pharmacological activities. The CS alkaloidal extract is analgesic at a dose of 5 mg/20 g mouse as it showed a comparable result to mefenamic acid using the acetic acid-induced writhing method. An in vitro test for anthelminthic activity using Ascaris suum showed that the CS alkaloidal extract gave a comparable result to mebendazole (Antiox) at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. Results of the micronucleus test, an in vivo method, showed that both the CS and ES alkaloidal extracts were not mutagenic but instead exhibited antimutagenic activities at 0.5 mg/20 g mouse. The CS- and ES-soluble alkaloidal extracts reduced the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes induced by tetracycline, a known mutagen, by 67.0% and 71.2%, respectively. Preliminary pharmacological screening showed that both extracts caused a relative depression in the central nervous system as evidenced by a decrease in respiratory rate and depth and a decrease in motor activity.

AB  - A study was undertaken to determine the rumen DM and CP degradability characteristics of soyabean. canola seed, peanut, palm kernel and Leucaena leucocephala leaves. The oilseeds were either treated with n-hexane to extract the fat or left untreated. Nylon bags were incubated in each of four rumen cannulated sheep for 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. Animals were fed on a diet consisting of meadow hay (ad libitum) and 150 g of concentrate twice daily. Fat extraction caused a decrease (P≤0.05) in DM disappearance of soyabean at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 12 h and of peanuts at all incubation times. CP disappearance from peanuts was reduced (P≤0.05) as a result of fat extraction at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 12 h. Fat extraction of canola seed increased CP disappearance at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h (P≤0.05). However, in the case of defatted canola seed, an increase in DM disappearance (P≤0.05) was observed in the first 4 incubation times and a decrease (P≤0.05) in the later times. Fat extraction increased (P≤0.05) DM disappearance of palm kernel at 0 and 48 h, but reduced it at 4, 6 and 24 h. CP disappearance of palm kernel was improved by treatment (P≤0.05) at 0, 4, 24 and 48 h and decreased at 12 h. In the case of palm kernel the largest differences in DM and CP disappearance occurred between the 24 and 48 h incubation times. Degradability characteristics for DM and CP of full-fat soyabean, canola seed and peanut were comparable to those of the full fat samples. Effective DM degradability of soyabean, canola seed and peanuts was 72.2 and 71.9: 74 1 and 66.8; and 85.9 and 70.8 for full fat and extracted feeds, respectively. Effective CP degradability was similar in all oilseeds with the exception of the extracted canola seed. Therefore, the incorporation of full-fat soyabean, canola seed and peanut into ruminant rations can be considered as a means of increasing the energy balance. Both palm kernel DM and CP degradabilities were characterized by slow rates of degradation by negative values "h". This suggests the predominance of microbial colonization over disappearance during incubation. DM and CP disappearance of Leucaena leucocephala leaves originating from Cuba were lower than those from Nigeria. Degradability characteristics for CP and DM of Cuban leucaena leaves showed that the linear model resulted in a better fit than the exponential one.

TI  - Improving maize (Zea mays) yields in semiarid highlands of Kenya: Agroforestry or inorganic fertilizers?
PY  - 1998
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031974744&doi=10.1016%2fS0378-4290%2897%2900067-1&partnerID=40&md5=266a2389379c47562b2d65b6fd410237
AB  - Farmers' maize (Zea mays) yields in semiarid Kenya are low because of low and erratic rainfall and soil nutrient depletion. An experiment was conducted in Machakos, Kenya, during November 1989-July 1995 to explore the potential of hedgerow intercropping (HI) with Leucaena leucocephala as an alternative strategy to the use of inorganic fertilizers for improving maize yields in semiarid bimodal highlands. The study, conducted in a randomized block design with three replications, evaluated on an operational scale with four treatments: sole maize with or without fertilizer; and HI with prunings of L. leucocephala hedges used as green manure or with prunings and maize stover fed to oxen and manure returned to soil. About 1.4 t ha-1 of L. leucocephala foliar biomass and 1.2 t ha-1 manure were incorporated each season in green-manure and ox-manure systems, respectively. Although sole maize responded to inorganic fertilizer in six of 11 seasons, maize yield was improved by HI, with prunings used as green manure, only once, 5 yrs after the commencement of the study, when rainfall exceeded 500 mm. Over the experimental period, maize yields were 15% and 30% less in green-manure and ox-manure systems, respectively, than in unfertilized maize, primarily because of the competition of hedgerows with crops for water. The fodder system of HI recycled only 27% of N and 50% of P exported from the field in fodder, grain and stover, and depleted nutrients more than the other systems. The green-manure system made a positive N balance, with similar P depletion as in the fodder system. No changes were detected in soil organic carbon or cations in any of the systems during the experimental period while extractable P was significantly improved by fertilizing maize. Net present value of returns from fertilizing maize at 40 kg N and 18 kg P ha-1 was 10% higher than from the unfertilized control. Fertilizer use would be 25% more profitable, however, if P were applied only to match the amount of P removed by crop (9 kg P ha-1 per season) and if maize were not topdressed (amounting to 50% of the recommended N) in poor rainfall seasons. Of the two HI systems, only the fodder system was more profitable than either system of sole-cropped maize because the high value of fodder more than compensated the smaller maize yield obtained in HI. However, the fodder system may not give higher economic returns than a sole L leucocephala fodder bank. Hence, HI using competitive species such as L. leucocephala and with the level of productivity observed in this study, is not appropriate for semiarid climates to increase cereal yields, either directly through green manuring or indirectly by fodder production and nutrient cycling through livestock.

AB  - Rhizobium loti strain PN4115 (NZP2213 str-1) ineffectively nodulates Leucaena leucocephala, i.e., strain PN4115 induces nodulation (Nod+) and is able to invade these nodules (Inv+), but fails to fix nitrogen (Fix-). Strain PN4115 does not synthesize a flavolan-binding polysaccharide (FBP), which is synthesized by the fully effective (Nod+Inv+Fix+) R. loti strain PN184 (NZP2037 str-1). The FBP may offer protection from prodelphinidin-rich flavolans synthesized by Lc. leucocephala. In this work, we show that exopolysaccharide (EPS)-negative mutants derived from strain PN4115 have a more severe ineffective phenotype (Nod+Inv-Fix-)on Lc. leucocephala than strain PN4115. This suggests that EPS from strain PN4115 is functional during invasion of Lc. leucocephala and that the requirement for EPS precedes the requirement for FBP.

AB  - The quantities of earthworm surface casts were monitored in traditional bush fallow regrowth (BFR), Pueraria phaseoloides live mulch (PLM), Leucaena leucocephala alley cropping (LAC) and undisturbed forest. The fallow systems were planted to maize/cassava intercrop either permanently or for one year after three years of fallow i.e. at 100 and 25% cropping frequencies. Earthworm casting activity was lower in fields cropped after clearing three year old fallow than in the respective permanently cropped fallow management system. The reduction in casting was related both to the degree of biomass removed through burning and to re-establishment of cover crops. Higher exchangeable cation concentration in the soil did not cause increased casting activity. Concentrations of organic C, total N and exchangeable Ca and Mg in casts were significantly higher than in the 0-15 cm topsoil. Exchangeable Ca and Mg in casts did not significantly differ between treatments, with the exception of significantly higher Mg in casts after three years of P. phaseoloides fallow. Topsoil (0-15 cm) exchangeable Ca and Mg were not correlated with cast exchangeable Ca and Mg, but concentrations of organic C and total N in casts were significantly correlated with organic C and total N in the topsoil. Coefficients of variability of organic C, total N and exchangeable Ca and Mg were about twice as high in the soil than in casts. Significant negative correlations between the cast to soil ratio (cast enrichment factor) of organic C, total N and exchangeable Ca and Mg and the respective concentrations in the soil show that earthworms are increasingly selective in organic carbon and nutrient uptake as these parameters of soil fertility are declining. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1998.

AB  - An investigation of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) marker distribution was made for two well-characterised hybrids and their parents, Leucaena leucocephala and L. esculenta and Parkinsonia aculeata and Cercidium praecox. Three chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers identified the maternal parent of each L. leucocephala x L. esculenta hybrid. Fifteen species-diagnostic RAPD markers (invariant in one taxon and absent from the other) were always present in the Leucaena hybrid and assumed to be of nuclear origin, whilst three RAPD markers showed expression patterns identical to the cpDNA markers and were assumed to be of organellar origin. No RAPD or PCR-RFLP taxon-diagnostic markers were discovered for either P. aculeata or C. praecox. However, 21 RAPD markers were species-specific (polymorphic within one taxon but absent from the other) and Southern analysis indicated that none of the markers were of organellar origin. Only 67% additivity of markers specific to P. aculeata and C. praecox was demonstrated in the hybrids between these two species, whilst in Leucaena 97% additivity was demonstrated. Differences between the two hybridising situations were related to the behaviour of the molecular markers and the biology of the species.

K-8 (family Leguminosae), a natural polysaccharide, with properties comparable to guar gum, was evaluated as a pharmaceutical binder. Characterization was done using studies of compressibility, micromeritic, and mechanical properties of granules prepared by wet granulation and subsequent studies on compacts, both containing 5 % w/w of binder. The seed gum was subsequently used as a binder with a badly compressible material, paracetamol, and studied likewise. The seed gum compared well with standard pharmaceutical binders (starch and polyvinyl pyrrolidone [PVP] K30), at least for properties studied herein.

AB  - Between October 1988 and August 1992, field experiments were carried out in West Kenya to evaluate the suitability of Leucaena leucocephala, L. collinsii, Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra calothyrsus, Sesbania sesban, S. grandiflora, Senna siamea and S. spectabilis to provide a range of agroforestry products and services. The initial objective was to establish the growth rates and wood and leaf yields of these tree species, when planted in single rows. After the initial evaluation, it was evident that valuable additional information could be collected if the trees were converted to hedges and their effect on intercropped maize and soils was studied. At 21 months after planting, different species and provenances ranged in height between 3.5 and 6 m and varied considerably in phenotypic appearance. Wood production (1988-1990) varied from 3 to 33.8 t ha-1 and leaf production varied from 0.62 to 10.1 t ha-1. During intercropping (1990-1992), leaf production varied from 0 to 10.9 t ha-1. Maize yields were higher in association with Leucaena and Gliricidia than with Calliandra, Sesbania and Senna. Cumulative maize grain and stover yields over four seasons were positively correlated with the total amount of tree leaves applied (r2 range, 0.70-0.95). The effect of tree leaf mulch on crop yields decreased over time for all species. Leaves with high nutrient contents, which decompose fast (Leucaena, Gliricidia, Sesbania) are likely to have been more effective in sustaining crop yields than leaves with lower nutrient contents (Senna) or more complex decomposition patterns (Calliandra). Simple 'leaf input-crop output' budgets to calculate the reserves for N, P and K in different systems explained crop yield differences in some cases. Compared to the fertility status of 'zero-mulch' control plots, the status of soil C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S was to varying degrees improved under Leucaena, Gliricidia and Sesbania, much less under Calliandra but not under Senna. First season grain yields were related to the soil fertility status at the end of the tree fallow. The results of these experiments suggest that under subhumid tropical conditions with soils of relatively poor nutrient status, where light and water are not likely to be the major limiting factors to crop production, the application of sufficient quantities of high quality tree mulch may positively influence maize yields. When agroforestry tree species with contrasting decomposition and nutrient release patterns are evaluated jointly, it is more difficult to demonstrate a general relationship between quantities of mulch applied and improvements in crop yields and soil fertility levels. Therefore, further chemical, physiological and phenotypic characterization of tree species with potential for fallow and intercropping systems is required.

AB  - We present a phylogenetic analysis of nine strains of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria isolated from nodules of tagasaste (Chamaecytisus proliferus) and other endemic woody legumes of the Canary Islands, Spain. These and several reference strains were characterized genotypically at different levels of taxonomic resolution by computer-assisted analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR- RFLPs), 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS) RFLPs, and repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) genomic fingerprints with BOX, ERIC, and REP primers. Cluster analysis of 16S rDNA restriction patterns with four tetrameric endonucleases grouped the Canarian isolates with the two reference strains, Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110spc4 and Bradyrhizobium sp. strain (Centrosema) CIAT 3101, resolving three genotypes within these bradyrhizobia. In the analysis of IGS RFLPs with three enzymes, six groups were found, whereas rep-PCR fingerprinting revealed an even greater genotypic diversity, with only two of the Canarian strains having similar fingerprints. Furthermore, we show that IGS RFLPs and even very dissimilar rep-PCR fingerprints can be clustered into phylogenetically sound groupings by combining them with 16S rDNA RFLPs in computer-assisted cluster analysis of electrophoretic patterns. The DNA sequence analysis of a highly variable 264- bp segment of the 16S rRNA genes of these strains was found to be consistent with the fingerprint-based classification. Three different DNA sequences were obtained, one of which was not previously described, and all belonged to the B. japonicum/Rhodopseudomonas rDNA cluster. Nodulation assays revealed that none of the Canarian isolates nodulated Glycine max or Leucaena leucocephala, but all nodulated Acacia pendula, C. proliferus, Macroptilium atropurpureum, and Vigna unguiculata.

AB  - A microplot study was conducted with Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium to determine the effect of pruning the trees and applying the prunings to the soil (as either surface mulch or soil-incorporated green manure) on N2 fixation by the trees. N2 fixation was estimated by the 15N dilution method, and the non-N2-fixing species Senna siamea was used as a reference species. Number and dry weight of nodules were reduced with applications of prunings in Leucaena, and increased in Gliricidia. For both species, the lowest rate of N2 fixation (47%) occurred under green manure incorporation after pruning, and the highest (66%) with mulching and no-pruning. Incorporation of green manure into soil significantly depressed N2 fixation by 19.1% in Gliricidia and 20.6% in Leucaena compared to no-pruning treatment. The deleterious effect of incorporation of prunings into soil also affected the amount of N2 fixed. During the nine months following pruning, green manure incorporation steadily decreased the percentage of N2 fixed, whereas with no-pruning, pruning only and pruning with mulching, N2 fixation increased with time. Reduction of N2 fixation in pruned plants could imply that they would compete for N with interplanted food crops, causing lower N use efficiency by the latter. Despite lower dry-matter and N yields of Leucaena as compared with Gliricidia, its biological N2 fixation amounted to 73% of its N requirement as opposed to the corresponding figures of 50% for Gliricidia.

AB  - The influence of four pruning frequencies on biomass, nodulation and N2 fixation was investigated on Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala grown in the screenhouse for 16 months, using acetylene reduction and 15N dilution methods. Frequent prunings at 4-month intervals had no deleterious effect on symbiotic N2 fixation, which increased in Gliricidia and Leucaena in particular. Nodulation and nitrogenase activity varied inconsistently within species, and were not influenced by pruning frequency. Cumulative assessment of pruning effect showed higher biomass, N yield and N2-fixing capacity of the woody species than at last harvest, and appeared to have more practical relevance. Across species, cumulative total dry matter, N yields, and both percentage and absolute amount of N2 derived from atmosphere increased with pruning frequency, except when trees were pruned 3 times. Of the three species, G. sepium had the lowest biomass production, N2 fixation and N accumulation.

AB  - Soils from seven sites on the island of Jamaica were assayed for the symbiotic diazotrophs Frankia and Rhizobium using serial dilutions. Most probable number and least squares regression methods were used to estimate each soil's capacity to nodulate native Myrica cerifera, exotic Leucaena leucocephala and exotic Casuarina cunninghamiana. The sample sites included a montane forest, a slash-and-burn agricultural site, reclaimed bauxite mining areas, abandoned sugar cane fields, and a garden plot. None of the host plants used in the bioassay were present on the sites sampled except for scattered L. leucocephala on one site. Frankia capable of nodulating M. cerifera, which is native to Jamaican highlands, occurred at all sites sampled. No C. cunninghamiana-infective Frankia was detected in soils sampled. Only soils from one site on the tropical coastal plain harbored rhizobia able to nodulate L. leucocephala (37 nodulation units cm-3 of soil). A subset of nodulated M. cerifera and L. leucocephala reduced acetylene to ethylene indicating nitrogenase activity. The slash- and burn agricultural site, which was situated at an elevation of 200 m and possessed both high natural fertility and high soil moisture-supplying capacity, had significantly greater Myrica infectious capacity (1 000 nodulation units cm-3 of soil) than the other sites (7-207 nodulation units cm-3 of soil). A planned, paired comparison revealed that a recently cultivated sugar cane field and a recently reclaimed bauxite mining site together had significantly less Myrica-infective Frankia (4 nodulation units cm-3 of soil) than a corresponding pair of sites consisting of a sugar cane field abandoned for 25 years and a bauxite mining site reclaimed 20 years before sampling (118 nodulation units cm-3 of soil). Results indicate that Myrica-infective Frankia is widespread in Jamaica, that the number of Myrica infective Frankia units vary from site to site in accordance with soil type and soil history, that Jamaican sites sampled lack soil Frankia populations capable of nodulating a casuarina host, that rhizobial symbionts capable of nodulating L. leucocephala may be geographically restricted to lowlands in Jamaica, and that the occurrence of Frankia in these soils is independent of host plant presence.

AB  - A population of 513 hybrids of Leucaena leucocephala (4x) and L. diversifolia ssp. diversifolia (4x), that is being analyzed for several morphological and agronomical characteristics, aiming at selecting cold tolerant plants, was also analyzed for floral color. A model of additive dominant inheritance (pink color dominant over white color, or presence versus absence of pigment, and the number of dominant alleles present determining the intensity of the pink color) is proposed. The action of two independent locus sets is also suggested, one for the male (with two main structural genes) and another for the female floral organs (one main structural gene). It is suggested that an undetermined number of regulatory genes affect color expression.

AB  - Differences in crop systems reflect in soil microorganisms and in this work some interactions among agronomically important microorganisms and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and maize (Zea mays) grown in monoculture or intercropped were studied. Under controlled conditions, both bean and maize exudates stimulated rhizobial survival, growth, and nod gene inducing activity, bean nodulation and N accumulation in tissues, and Azospirillum lipoferum survival. After two years with bean and maize in monoculture or intercropped, Azospirillum spp. population was high and did not differ between treatments, while Rhizobium tropici, nitrite oxidizers and soil biomass were favored by bean plants. Rhizobium etli represented, on average, 15% of rhizobial population, except for soils with maize grown alone, where this species was absent, predominating Rhizobium spp., which nodulate exclusively leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). Soil extracts from the intercropped system showed higher content of nod gene inducing phenolic compounds. Mycorrhizal spore number was not affected by the treatments, although bean in monoculture favored species diversity.

AB  - Quantification of the movement of residue N through various biologically meaningful soil organic matter (SOM) fractions is essential in low-input tropical cropping systems for the development of management practices aimed at optimizing N-use efficiency. The flow of N derived from 15N-labeled leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] and dactyladenia [Dactyladenia barteri (Hook f ex Oliv.)

A bioassay study with maize (Zea mays L.) was carried out to assess the availability of residue-derived N (RDN) incorporated in the particle-size fractions. At 53 d after residue application (DAA), most of the RDN was found in the fraction between 0.250 and 2 mm (O250) in the leucaena treatment and in the fraction >2 mm and the surface litter (O2000 + SL) in the dactyladenia treatment. The RDN content of all fractions <0.250 mm was significantly higher in the leucaena than in the dactyladenia treatment up to 471 DAA. The proportion of the total amount of RDN recovered in the fractions <2 mm shifted toward the smaller particle-size classes near the end of the experiment. Highly significant (P < 0.001) relationships between RDN present in the particulate organic matter (POM) and uptake of RDN by maize indicated the relatively high availability of RDN in the POM. Fractionating the SOM pool into different particle-size classes yielded useful information on the relative contributions of the different SOM fractions to N turnover and availability.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted during 1981-82 to 1990-91 on a clay soil to study the effect of alley cropping of white popinac [Leucaena latisiliqua L] Gillis; syn L. leucocephala (L.) de Wit] with field crop of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], sorghum + pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] and pigeonpea + blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.) on crop productivity and soil fertility under rainfed condition. Hedge rows of white popinac at 3.75 m spacing grown with field crops reduced the grain yield of sorghum, sorghum + pigeonpea and pigeonpea + blackgram by 12.4, 13.6 and 16.9% respectively compared with the expected reduction of 20%. But the reduction in green-fodder yield of white popinac was 65.4, 73.6 and 63.0% compared with the expected reduction of 80% sole cropping at 0.75 m spacing. The values of land-equivalent ratio of 1.20-1.22 under white popinac grown with field crops were higher than of sole cropping. White popinac with sorghum + pigeonpea intercropping gave overall higher yield advantage by producing higher biomass as grain and fodder. Field crops with white popinac also improved the soil-fertility status by increasing the organic carbon, and the available N and P content of soils.

AB  - The detection of hybridity in Leucaena is discussed in relation to: (i) traditional criteria, (ii) molecular criteria and (iii) models to predict hybrid leaf morphology. Morphological, geographical and molecular evidence for the occurrence of interspecific hybrids between L leucocephala and L. diversifolia in south-central Mexico, northern Guatemala, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea is presented. Predicted mean hybrid leaf trait values calculated from parent material are compared with data from putative hybrids and shown to be similar. The origin of these hybrids is discussed and shown to be the result of artificial sympatry resulting from indigenous, and recent exotic, domestication of the parent species. The hybrid is described as L. x spontanea.

AB  - The binding constants of Cu2+ and galactomannans composed of sugar units of mannose and galactose from the seeds of Cassia fastuosa and Leucaena leucocephala were determined by potentiometric titrations and inspected by EPR spectroscopy. Two complexed species were found in both systems, one moiety being the metal ion (M) and the other moiety a sugar monomer of the polysaccharide (L), non-protonated, ML, and protonated, MHL. The values for the logarithms of the binding constants are in the range of 15 units for ML for both employed galactomannans, and 8.0 for MHL for Man:Gal medium average ratio 4:1 galactomannan (C. fastuosa) and 6.8 for Man:Gal medium average ratio 2.6:1 one (L. leucocephala). The EPR spectra have shown one octahedral complex species linked through the oxygen atoms of the hydroxyl groups of the monomer with tetragonal deformation. The A and g obtained values were A∥ = 178G, g∥ = 2.260, and g⊥ = 2.050 and A⊥ = 30G for CU2+ with the galactomannans. This was assigned to be ML2 complex which was only detected in the solid state due to the formation of insoluble products in solution, above pH value of 7.0. The extension of formation of complexed species of galactomannans with Cu2+ is probably much more affected by the pH variation than by the degree of substitution of monomers of the chain of the biopolymers studied so far. © 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

AB  - The effects of water stress and nitrogen availability on leaf water potential, nitrogenase activity, and growth was studied in a pot experiment with Leucaena leucocephala seedlings. Water stress was imposed on fertilized and unfertilized plants after inoculation with Rhizobium. Non-inoculated seedlings were used as control plants. Water stress lowered leaf water potential in all seedlings after 14 days of treatment. In inoculated seedlings, fertilized plants were more sensitive to water stress than unfertilized plants, as shown by a higher leaf water potential in plants of the latter treatment. Uninoculated and fertilized seedlings were most affected by water stress. This indicates that Rhizobium might increase stress tolerance in unfertilized seedlings at moderate water stress levels. The combined effects of water stress and applied fertilizers resulted in cessation of nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation came to a complete stop after 22 days of water stress in fertilized seedlings. The different treatments were accompanied by anatomical changes of nodule structure. It is hypothesised that the leaf water potential may be used as an indicator to predict changes in nitrogen fixation in legume tree/shrub species during periods of water stress.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of including legume species (Leucaena leucocephala, Stylosanthes guianensis, Centrosema pubescens Benth or Neonotonia wightii) at levels of 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40% of the dry matter on the chemical composition (crude protein, CP neutral detergent fiber, NDF; acid detergent fiber, ADF) and on in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of mixtures of each legume with four grass species (Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst, Panicum maximum jacq., Pennisetum purpureum Schum., or Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Of the legume species included, Leucaena leucocephala and Centrosema pubescens had the highest CP content and IVDMD, respectively. For the legumes, the mean CP and IVDMD values, respectively, were Leucaena leucocephala, 21.98 and 68.09; Stylosanthes guianensis, 13.70 and 63.44; Centrosema pubescens, 18.29 and 68.60; and Neonotonia wightii, 16.72 and 66.64%.

Neutral detergent fiber and ADF contents were higher in the grasses (Cynodon nlemfuensis, 73.03 and 44.45; Panicum maximum, 65.27 and 49.06; Pennisetum purpureum, 69.26 and 51.88; and Sorghum bicolor, 60.24 and 50.99%, respectively) than in the legumes (Leucaena leucocephala, 50.52 and 28.50; Stylosanthes guianensis, 52.57 and 36.63; Centrosema pubescens, 58.43 and 34.84; and Neonotonia wightii, 54.11 and 33.23%, respectively). The chemical composition of the forages varied according to the relative proportions of the species included, as expected. However, the effects on IVDMD were not additive; rather, associative effects, mainly antagonistic, were observed in most of the mixtures.

Leaf leachate were prepared by soaking 200 g oven dried ground leaves of Leucaena in distilled water for 24 hours. Solutions were filtered and then diluted to make concentrations of 1,2,3,4 and 5 per cent. The leachates of different concentrations were used to study their effect on germination (%), plumule length and radicle length of Oats seeds. Germination (%), plumule length and radicle length decreased progressively with an increase in the concentration of leaf leachate. However, root number did not vary significantly.

AB  - Erosion losses were investigated in a field experiment, from 90 x 15 m erosion plots at 4% slope in the western Himalayan valley region of India. The plots were planted with Leucaena leucocephala and Eucalyptus hybrid, either as block plantation or in alley farming with maize (Zea mays), Chrysopogon fulvus grass or turmeric (Curcuma longa). The treatments also included contour planting of sole maize, sole Chrysopogon fulvus grass and a clean weeded cultivated fallow. During the nine year study period, the average annual monsoon rainfall was about 1000 mm and it caused 347 mm runoff and 39 Mg ha-1 soil loss per year from fallow plots. The runoff and soil loss were reduced by 27% and 45% by contour cultivation of maize. Contour tree-rows or leucaena hedges reduced the runoff and soil loss by 40% and 48%, respectively, over the maize plot, reducing soil loss to about 12.5 Mg ha-1. This reduction in erosion was primarily due to the barrier effect of tree or hedgerows and micro-terraces formed through sediment deposition along the contour barriers. Such vegetative measures, that are productive while being protective, offer viable alternative for erosion control in areas with gentile slopes of the valley region. High density block plantations of eucalyptus and leucaena almost completely controlled erosional losses and can be recommended for steeper slopes that are vulnerable to heavy erosion.

AB  - Sixteen accessions of Leucaena leucocephala, L. pallida and L. diversifolia and their interspecific hybrids were assessed for psyllid resistance, agronomic performance and forage quality in subtropical south-east Queensland. All accessions except the 4 L. leucocephala lines, L. diversifolia (K156) and its hybrid with L. leucocephala (K8) exhibited moderate-high psyllid resistance, fast seedling growth, high dry matter production and cool tolerance. However, their forage quality, as indicated by in vitro dry matter digestibility and chemical composition, was inferior to that of L. leucocephala. Condensed tannin concentration, in particular, was higher in the non-L. leucocephala lines and this was associated with lower IVDMD and higher psyllid resistance. The implications for development of these lesser-known Leucaena species for forage use are discussed.

We studied the dynamics of mineral nitrogen (N) in the top 100 cm of soil with a system of tensiometers and suction cups after applying 15N-labelled Leucaena leucocephala and Dactyladenia barteri residues to bare and cropped microplots installed in the respective alley cropping systems, and followed the fate of the N for two maize-cowpea rotations (1992 and 1993). Fifty days after applying the residues (DAA), 20% of the added residue N was found in the soil profile of the bare Leucaena treatment, and 5% under Dactyladenia, compared with 5% and 1%, respectively, where cropped. All values decreased to about 1% after 505 days. In the cropped soil, no mineral N derived from the residues was lost by leaching during the first 6 weeks. As the maize grew, the soil profile was gradually depleted of nitrate to near zero in the Dactyladenia treatment, whereas during the cowpea season the amount of nitrate N increased to 36 kg N ha-1 for the Leucaena treatment, and 26 kg N ha-1 for the Dactyladenia treatment. The soil of the bare microplots contained substantially more nitrate N (98 and 47 kg N ha-1 during the first year on average, under Leucaena and Dactyladenia, respectively) than that of the cropped microplots, except during the 1993 cowpea season. Nitrate residing in the subsoil (80-100 cm) in the bare treatments was not readily leached to deeper soil. The risk of losses of native mineral N was greatest during the first 50 DAA and to a lesser extent during the cowpea seasons. Improved management of the hedgerows could increase the potential of the hedgerow trees to recycle mineral N.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to assess the N availability of roots of woody species and maize. The trial was conducted using a split-plot design with four replications. Four incubation periods (0, 2, 4 and 6 months) made up the main plots. There were six subplots, consisting of addition of fine roots (< 2 mm diameter) of four woody species(Dactylcidenici barteri, Senna siamea, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala) and maize(Zea mays), and a control with no roots added. Roots from four-month-old plants were used in this study. Maize as test plant was grown in pots containing sandy loam soil (Psammentic ustorthent). Incubation period of roots before planting maize increased maize dry matter yield and N uptake. Addition of Gliricidia and Leucaena roots which have high? content and low C/N ratio (13.1 and 14.0 respectively) improved maize dry matter yield and N uptake following 2 months incubation. Application of maize roots which have low N content and high C/N ratio (40.3) reduced maize dry matter yield and N uptake. Application of Dactyladenia and Senna roots had an intermediate effect on maize dry matter yield and N uptake. Maize dry matter yield and N uptake were significantly and inversely correlated with the C/N ratio of the added roots with 0, 2, and 6 months incubation. No relationships were observed between the other root chemical characteristics and maize dry matter yield, and N uptake. © 1998 A B Academic Publishers.

AB  - The study aimed at evaluating an alternative supplementation system, designed to significantly anticipate the 48-60-month average slaughter age observed in steers, in the Northeast semi-arid region. The liveweight gain of 45 weaned male calves was monitored under three treatment groups: (C) exclusive and yearlong grazing on caatinga: (CB) rainy season grazing on caatinga and dry season grazing on buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris, L.) pasture; (CBL) the same as CB plus leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.) hay supplementation, during the dry season. Observations were made over two dry and two rainy periods, a 711-day total period. At the end of the experimental period, the leucaena-supplemented animals were, on average, 33.4 kg and 107.5 kg heavier (P < 0.05) than those of the CB and C groups, respectively. Results showed that it was possible, for steers, even with an inadequate leucaena hay supply, to achieve the regional average slaughter weight with, at least, 14 months of anticipation.

AB  - In order to evaluate the Leucaena leucocephala's effect and the Panicum maximum on the productive parameters: daily weight gain (DWG), feeding conversion (FC) and weight increasing by group (WIG) in California (C) and New Zeland (NZ) breed rabbits, two feeding assays were realized: one in growing and the other in fattening. The animals from simultaneous brood were uniformed on base of weight and age. They were submitted to a 15 days accustoming period, the feeding period lasted 30 days in each case. 4 treatments of 7 units each were proposed: T1 received 100% of commercial concentrated; T2 received 50% of commercial concentrated plus 50% of Leucaena green foliage; T3 received 50% of commercial concentrated plus 50% of Leucaena dry foliage, and T4 received 50% of commercial concentrated plus 50% of Panicum maximum pasture. The Leucaena foliage and the Panicum maximum were supplied ad libitum. This test was realized in a large open shed conditioned by the Experimental Unit of Animal Production of the Universidad de los Andes (EUAP - ULA), Trujillo. The climatic characteristics were: Temperature average 27°C, Precipitation 800 -1359,5 mm/per year, altitude over the sea 495m and relative humidity 70%. The statistical data analysis for the variance method and the average test of Tukey revealed significant differences (P< 0,05) in growing and fattening for DWG/group and individual for T2, but the weight increasement and the feeding conversión were similar in buth cases. The foliage acceptance was good and it was not verified adversary effects on the animal's health.

AB  - Field samples and seedlings of 51 leguminous forage species were tested for alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) in routine monitoring of seed multiplication fields of the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Ethiopia. The virus was detected in 24 species and a solanaceous weed Solanum nigrum. Of these, the following 17 species are being reported for the first time as hosts of the virus in world literature: Aeschynomene falcata, Centrosema pascuorum, Chamaecrista rotundifolia, Desmanthus virgatus, Desmodium intortum, Leucaena leucocephala, Macroptilium atropurpureum, Macroptilium lathyroides, Macrotyloma axillare, Medicago truncatula, Neonotonia wightii, Sesbania sesban, Stylosanthes scabra, Trifolium calocephala, T. steudneri, T. tembense and Vigna parkeri. The solanaceous weed S. nigrum was suspected to play a role in the virus epidemiology. The level of seed infection varied from 0.00% to about 13.00%. Infectivity studies on 5 isolates of the virus revealed heterogeneity in prevalent AMV isolates. Two major strains were identified, based on the development of necrotic local lesions on Vigna unguiculata accessions. One of the isolates which failed to incite local necrotic lesions on V. unguiculata infected Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Top Crop systemically. Differences among isolates were also noticed in their concentration in different hosts as indicated by ELISA absorbance values.

AB  - Slash-and-burn farmers in the hills of Laos urgently need techniques that can sustain rice yields and reduce weed pressure under short fallow periods. For this, the potential of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth) as a fallow crop was evaluated in variety, establishment, and cropping systems studies conducted at Houay Khot station (19°N) from 1992 to 1995. Introduced perennial varieties were not superior to local material for the parameters evaluated. Some semi-perennial varieties produced grain yields up to 2.2 t ha-1 but were inferior in weed suppression and survival 12 months after planting. All varieties lost much of their weed competitiveness after the first picking of pods. In studies without weeding, < 10% initially established plants were present 15 months after planting. Compared with pigeon pea, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala performed better in biomass production, weed suppression, persistence, and self-regeneration after cultivation of rice. In a rotation study, rice yield was 1.3, 1.5, 2.3, 1.6, 1.8, 1.8, and 2.2 t ha-1 (LSD 5% = 0.5 t) for continuous rice, rice-pigeon pea intercropping, rice after pigeon pea, rice after cowpea, rice after Stylosanthes hamata, rice after maize, and rice after fallow, respectively. Compared with continuous rice, intercropping or rotation with pigeon pea reduced nematode (Meloidogyne graminicola) infestation of rice and weed biomass in the rice crop. In spite of the beneficial effects, rotation or intercropping systems with pigeon pea will only he viable if economic benefits from harvested grain or from using plant parts as livestock feed can be obtained. Because of high mortality and weed invasion pigeon pea is not suitable for fallow improvement if fallow duration is more than one year.

AB  - Using Leucaena leucocephala as a trap-host, 422 strains of rhizobia were isolated from the bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) rhizosphere in the Cerrado region of Brazil. Traditional bean-producing areas with no history of rhizobial inoculation were sampled. Colony DNA hybridizations with gene- specific probes were used to identify strains that could be grouped as R. tropici, type I strains (R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli or R. etli), or as other Rhizobium species. The same typing procedure was applied to 61 isolates from a large collection of strains isolated from bean plants inoculated with the same soil samples. Rhizobium tropici was present at all sites. The population of rhizobia isolated from bean plants was more heterogeneous than rhizobial population isolated from Leucaena. More than 90% of Leucaena isolates could be typed as R. tropici. Strains typed as R. tropici hybridized with R. leguminosarum hup structural genes, but not with R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli ORF3, and the majority of them had a relative efficiency above 0.75. All the Leucaena strains were found to effectively nodulate beans and most of them yielded higher shoot dry weight than R. tropici strain CIAT899.

AB  - An experiment was conducted with eight growing sheep (average initial weight 20.6 kg and average final weight 23.7 kg) in a 4 × 4 Latin square design to study the effect of type of forage supplementation to a basal diet of rice straw (ad libitum) and cassava (Manihot esculanta, approximately 9 g of dry matter (DM).kg-0.75 · day-1) on voluntary intake, digestion, rumen microbial protein synthesis and daily weight gain. Forages used were Leucaena (L, Leucaena leucocephala), Gliricidia (G, Gliricidia maculata) and Tithonia (T, Tithonia diversifolia, wild sunflower) at a DM supplementation level of approximately 13 g.kg-0.75·day-1. Organic matter intake was 40.4, 55.5, 55.0 and 54.9 g · kg.-0.75 · day-1 for control (C, ad libitum straw and cassava), L, G and T. respectively, significantly lower for C than for the supplemented diets. Intake of supplementary forage had also a significantly positive effect on voluntary rice straw intake. All forage supplemented diets showed a significantly higher whole diet organic matter digestion than C (488 g · kg-1) while T (557 g · kg-1) differed significantly from L (516 g · kg-1) but not from G (526 g · kg-1). Daily weight gain was -1.7, 5.2, 5.4 and 4.7 g · kg-0.75, for C, L, G and T. respectively, significantly lower for C than for the forage-supplemented diets. Efficiency of microbial protein synthesis estimated from urinary excretion of purine derivatives was lower for C (3.8 g microbial N. (kg digestible organic matter intake (DOMI))-1 than for the forage supplemented diets (11.3, 9.0 and 9.4 g microbial N.(kg DOMI)-1 for L, G and T. respectively).

AB  - This paper consists of two parts. First the N fixation, C storage and animal production of legume-based pastures are reviewed; then the adoption of pasture legume technology is discussed in terms of technical, biological and socio-economic constraints. Different forage production systems and their place in livestock production systems are described. The prospects for legume use in Australia, south-east Asia, Africa south of the Sahara and Latin America are discussed in relation to forage and animal production systems. Tropical legumes fix as much N as temperate ones. Measured amounts of N added to pasture systems range from 30-290 kg/ha/yr for herbaceous legumes in mixtures with grasses to 575 kg/ha/yr for a pure stand of Leucaena leucocephala. Soil N increments under tropical legumes were up to 140 kg/ha/yr in Australia and 128 kg/ha/yr in Costa Rica. Legume-based tropical pastures store more C than pure grass or native pastures. In Colombia, an improved grass-legume mixture had accumulated 237 t/ha C to a depth of 1 m over 6 years compared with 186 t by a grass-only pasture. The highest cattle liveweight gain recorded from an irrigated pure stand of L. leucocephala was 2000 kg/ha/yr in the Kimberleys, Western Australia. On herbaceous legume-grass pastures the highest liveweight gain measured was 937 kg/ha/yr on Brachiaria brizantha - Arachis pintoi in the humid tropics of Costa Rica. Maximum milk production on tropical grass-legume pastures without concentrates is around 10-12 kg/cow/d. However, due to high carrying capacities, milk yields per ha of about 8000 kg/ha/yr have been recorded in north Queensland and in Malaysia. There is reasonable adoption of legume-based technology in tropical Australia and parts of south-east Asia and Latin America. However, many countries, particularly in Africa, have such a low development status that problems related to land tenure, infrastructure and social justice need to be solved first.

AB  - Three successive greenhouse experiments were carried out to determine the effectiveness of an initial application of benlate for obtaining soil free of mycorrhizal activity. An Oxisol was amended with P to obtain target concentrations optimal for mycorrhizal host growth or near-sufficient for mycorrhiza-free growth. The soil was not inoculated or was inoculated with the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus aggre-gatum and amended with benlate to obtain concentrations of 0–100 mg kg-1. At the former soil P concentration, benlate completely suppressed mycorrhizal formation and effectiveness, indicated by pinnule P content and shoot yield of Leucaena leucocephala in the initial experiment. The fungicide did not have significant effect on pinnule P content or shoot yield at the higher soil P concentration. In the second and third experiments, the inhibitory effect of the fungicide persisted through the first 30–40 days if the soil was not inoculated with G. aggregatum. Mycorrhizal activity in the benlate-treated and untreated low-P soils was similar in the third experiment if they had been inoculated with G. aggregatum. Our data suggest that benlate could be used to obtain mycorrhiza-free conditions at concentrations as low as 25 mg kg-1 for up to 90 days. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The performance of seven tree species, Acacia auriculiformis, Azadirachta indica, Dendrocalamus strictus, Dalbergia sissoo, Eucalyptus, Leucaena leucocephala and Tectona grandis under high density planting (60 × 60 cm) was evaluated on irrigated red sandy clay loam soils of Regional Research Station, Raichur, Karnataka during the period from 1983 to 1988. At the end of fifth year, Eucalyptus produced significantly the highest wood yield (105 t ha -I) as compared to other tree species. The lowest wood yield (28.1 t ha -I) was recorded in Tectona grandis. The net returns realised from wood yield was also more from Eucalyptus (Rs. 54,450 ha -I) followed by Azadirachta indica (Rs. 46,602 ha -I) and Leucaena leucocephala (Rs. 43,857 ha -I), while the lowest net returns (Rs. 18,522 ha -I) was realised from Dendrocalamus strictus.

AB  - The influence of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and Rhizobium during ex vitro hardening stage on growth and survival of micropropagated Leucaena leucocephala was investigated. Ex vitro inoculation with the AM fungus Glomus fasciculatum plays a key role in favoring increased growth and survival of these plants. The dual inoculation of G. fasciculatum and Rhizobium has resulted in higher growth rate of root and shoot, number of leaves, number of nodules, mycorrhizal colonization and 100% survival of micropropagated plants up to 5 months as compared to 91.66% and 65.21% survival in only mycorrhizal and Rhizobium treated plants, respectively. The non-inoculated plants grew poorly and all the plants died after 5 months. This biotechnology therefore, appears to be of potential interest in ensuring improved growth and survival of micropropagated multipurpose legume trees during the nursery stage.

AB  - Further studies of mimosine toxicity in broiler chicks were done to clarify a possibility of osteopathy. The mineral content and density of femur and the strength, ductility, and toughness for the index of mechanical properties significantly decreased in the 1% mimosine group, compared with those in the control and restricted groups. The stiffness had a decreasing tendency in the 1% mimosine group. Consequently, it was concluded that chicks fed ad libitum a 1% mimosine diet for 12 days developed osteopathy. The bone mineral density and the strength of the restricted group were lower than those of the control group, and those of the 1% mimosine group were still lower than those of the restricted group. Contents of pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline in the excrement were significantly higher in the restricted group than those in the control group, but the contents in the 1% mimosine group were significantly lowest among the groups. Osteopathy in chicks fed mimosine, therefore, seemed to be done by loss of appetite and changing to a low turnover of bone caused by mimosine. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Phenotypic diversity was studied among 13 Rhizobium strains selected from a total of 160 Rhizobium isolates from root nodules of Leucaena leucocephala. Two strains from Acacia saligna and two strains from Sesbania sesban plants were included in the examination for host range in the greenhouse. The Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena) strains were different from the reference strains and fell into three distinct groups for the utilization of 95 different carbon sources. Four of the best symbionts constituted a group, the majority of the strains fell into a second group, and strain DS 91 was the only member of the third group. Strains were effective symbionts for their original hosts. Nine strains were tolerant to elevated temperature (>42°C), and three strains were resistant to high salinity (>3% NaCl). All Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena) strains effectively nodulated L. leucocephala and L. culensii, but nitrogen fixation was greater with L. leucocephala than with L. culensii. These strains failed to form effective symbioses with two other species of Leucaena (L. retusa and L. divursiflora) or with alfalfa, Medicago sativa. Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena) strains DS 65, DS 78, and DS 158 nodulated and efficiently fixed nitrogen with Phaseolus vulgaris, with DS 65 showing the highest symbiotic capability. Strain DS 65 also nodulated and fixed nitrogen with Glycine max and Vigna sinensis. Nodulation of Leucaena by two Bradyrhizobium sp. (Acacia) strains was sparse. Strain DS 101 from Sesbania formed nodules on Leucaena, whereas the other strain from Sesbania, DS 110, failed to nodulate this genus.

AB  - Adult Jamunapari breed goats (n = 24) were randomly assigned to four iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric pelleted diets containing 97 (high level; HL), 60 (medium level; ML), 20 (low level; LL) and 0 (control) percent sun-dried Leucaena leucocephala foliage and fed ad libitum for one year. L. leucocephala supplementation increased total DM intake, (g kg-0.75) from 70.4 ± 2.3 in the control group to 94.1 ± 6.9 in HL (P < 0.01). The digestibility of most of the nutrients was depressed (P < 0.05) with increasing dietary levels of Leucaena. All the goats were in positive nitrogen balance, but daily nitrogen retention decreased (P < 0.05) at medium and high Leucaena levels as a result of the poor utilization of the high protein content of the foliage. The nutritive value in terms of digestible crude protein (DCP) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) of Leucaena-supplemented diets was lower (P < 0.05) than the control. However, DCP and TDN intake was comparable among diets. None of the blood biochemical constituents (Haemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen) and activities of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of experimental feeding varied significantly due to dietary treatment. Histopathological examination of the thyroid glands of the goats sacrificed at the end of the experiment did not reveal any sign of colloidal goiter associated with mimosine toxicity. However, mild to moderate hyperplasia and degenerative changes in focal area were observed. No significant pathological changes were observed in vital organs (lungs, liver, kidney, heart, testes and intestine) irrespective of dietary treatment. The apparent comparable performance observed in goats fed sun-dried pelleted Leucaena foliage suggests the possibility of its long-term use as a sole feed for the maintenance of stall fed goats without any significant deleterious effect. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Fifteen Jamunapari male goats, weighing 22.0 kg were divided into 3 groups of 5 animals each. The animals were offered rations containing leaves and twigs of Leucaena leucocephala to provide 0, 25 and 50% of CP of total rations in L1, L2 and L3 groups. Three animals from each group were sacrificed after a feeding for 330 days for pathological examination of vital organs. Incorporation of leucaena in L3 group resulted in significant (P<0.05) increase in DM consumption. Except EE, the digestibility of DM, OM, CP, ADF, NDF and cellulose was similar on different treatments. Incorporation of leucaena leaves in diets resulted in reduction of EE digestibility which was 62.7, 56.3 and 42.1 in L1, L2 and L3 groups respectively. The average daily live-weight gain was 39±2.3, 48±4.5 and 45±3.9g per head in L1, L2 and L3 groups with no significant differences (P<0.05). Histopathological examination of vital organs did not reveal any significant change due to leucaena feeding, excepting in thyroid glands and kidneys. The thyroid glands of L2 and L3 revealed mild variation in size of follicles with normal or pale staining colloids. Kidneys revealed intense engorgement of interstitial blood vessels with extravasation of red blood corpuscles. It is concluded that leucaena may be providing up to 50% CP of the ration for goats up to 330 days and it does not cause any serious disorder in vital organs.

AB  - Six crossbred castrated male pigs weighing 55 kg each were randomly allocated to three diets according to a duplicate 3 × 3 Latin Square Design to study digestion indices determined by sun-dried leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam.) meal (LM) of 11 and 22% on dry matter basis in diets based on sugar cane molasses grade B and soya bean meal. Ferrous sulphate (0.5%) was included in all diets. A significant decrease in energy (P < 0.01) but not in N digestibility was observed by increasing the level of LM in the diet. There was no treatment effect on crude fibre digestibility. Faecal pH significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and daily faecal short chain fatty acids and ammonia excretion increased (P < 0.001) with increasing levels of dietary LM. No adverse effects on nutrient digestibility were observed when LM at 11% was included in the diets.

AB  - An experiment was conducted during rainy season of 1991 and 1992 to study the effect of subabul [Leucaena leucoceohala (Lamk) deWit] on the yield of clusterbean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taubert] and sesame (Sesame indicum L.) and on Leucaena itself. Association of Leucaena adversely affected the grain production of field crops with advancement in the age and canopy. The reduction in grain yield was minimum when Leucaena was topped at 1.50 m over central leader system, open centre system and no lopping system. The reduction in pod, seed, fodder and fuelweed production of Leucaena was minimum under no lopping conditions compared with open centre system, central leader system and topping at 1.50 m.

AB  - The effect of feeding graded levels of Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena pallida, Sesbania sesban and Chamaecytisus palmensis supplements on intake, digestibility and live weight changes was evaluated using 102 male Ethiopian highland sheep in a 90-day trial. Teff straw (Eragrostis tef) was fed ad libitum (control diet), or supplemented with graded levels (15, 30, 45, 60% of ration dry matter intake) of L. leucocephala, L. pallida, C. palmensis or S. sesban in a randomized complete block design. Significant (P < 0.05) decrease in teff straw intake was observed, as the level of supplement increased. Substitution rates (g kg-1 supplement) increased with increasing levels of supplementation. Substitution rate varied from 162 to 528 in L. pallida, -89 to 312 in L. leucocephala, -566 to 231 in S. sesban and -10 to 134 in C. palmensis supplemented diets. Dry matter and digestible organic matter intake increased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing level of L. leucocephala, C. palmensis and S. sesban, but not in L. pallida. Live weight gain increased significantly (P < 0.01) with increasing level of browse supplementation. The animals fed the control diet lost weight (-24.4 g d-1) while the supplemented ones gained weight in the range of 6.5-65.2 g d-1. The maximum live weight gain (65.2 g d-1) was observed in sheep fed a diet with 60% L. pallida. The optimum levels of browse supplementation in terms of live weight gain per g supplement were 45, 45, 30, 30% DM of total ration for L. leucocephala, L. pallida, C. palmensis and S. sesban, respectively. A close relationship between live weight gain and amount of supplement was observed. The digestibilities of DM, OM, N and supplement DM increased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing level of supplementation. No significant (P > 0.05) differences were observed in NDF digestibility. Faecal nitrogen, urinary nitrogen output and nitrogen retention increased significantly (P < 0.0001) with level of supplementation. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An analysis of the main chemical constituents (DM, CP, TP, NDF, OMD, ash, Ca, P, mimosine and DHP) of Leucaena leucocephala varieties (17474 Venezuela, 17389 Perú, 17218, 17222, 17217, 9386, 17489, 9904 and CNIA-250) from an agronomical evaluation experiment was carried out to determine the effect of variability on their composition. It was confirmed that the first four main components accounted for 88.4% of the total variability and that only Ca did not affect total variability from 10 constituents analysed. Further discrimination studies of the varieties of this plant for animal feeding should be considered when studying these varieties.

AB  - The potential of alley cropping systems supplied with a limited amount of fertilizer to restore crop productivity on a degraded site and to maintain crop productivity on a recently cleared, non-degraded site on 'terre de barre' soils in Southern Bénin was investigated from 1994 to 1996. Leucaena leucocephala. Senna siamea and Gliricidia sepium were used as hedgerow species. Maize yields of the no-tree control plots dropped from the initial (1990) 401 kg ha-1 and 2181 kg ha-1 on the degraded and non-degraded sites, respectively, to 109 kg ha-1 and 1346 kg ha-1 in 1996, even with application of a minimal amount of mineral fertilizer. The alley cropping systems produced on average (mean of three treatments and three years) 107% more grain than the initial 1990 values on the degraded site and 11% less grain than the initial 1990 values on the non-degraded site. Especially the Senna and to a lesser degree the Leucaena treatment yielded consistently more grain than the control. The Senna trees contained a larger amount of N and produced more wood during the first pruning on the degraded site (155 kg N ha-1 and 14.0 ton fresh wood ha-1) than on the non-degraded site (49 kg N ha-1 and 6.6 ton fresh wood ha-1) most likely because of differences in subsoil fertility, as indicated by the higher clay, exchangeable bases, and N content between 60 and 125 cm cm. N accumulation and wood production by the Leucaena and Gliricidia trees was similar in both sites (82 and 36 kg N ha-1 and 4.6 and 9.3 ton fresh wood ha-1, respectively). When a limited amount of fertilizer is available, Senna appears to be the best choice as hedgerow species on sites with a relatively fertile subsoil. For other soils, a N2-fixing species may be a better choice. © 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Investigations were carded out to achieve cent per cent transplantation success of micropropagated Leucaena leucocephale (a fast growing multipurpose leguminous tree species) plantlets using two vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Glomus fasciculatum and Glomus macrocarpum. Plantlets were obtained by rooting the shoots [obtained through; hypocotyl callus in presence of 10-5M BAP + 10-6M NAA; and axillary bud sprouting from cotyledonary and other nodes in presence of 10-5M BAP, on Gamborg's B5 medium], on half strength B5 medium supplemented with 5 x 10-6M IBA. Subsequent to the nodulation of their roots with Rhizobium (strain PRGL 001) in soilrite, these plantlets were transferred to sterilized garden soil by laying inoculum of either Glomus fasciculatum or Glomus macrocarpum around their roots. Only 20% of the plantlets survived in soils lacking VAM fungus. In contrast, cent per cent of the plantlets of Leucaena leucocephala established very well and showed good growth in VAM inoculated soil. Roots of the later plantlets showed presence of both external and internal hyphae with well formed arbuscules and vesicles confirming the establishment of good mycorrhizal association. These studies convincingly demonstrate that the mycorrhizal association help in successful establishment of tissue culture raised plantlets of Leucaena leucocephala in the field conditions by alleviating the transplantation shock.

AB  - A study was conducted at a farm near Colima, Mexico, to evaluate the reproductive performance of 60 hair sheep and 30 F1 crossbreds (Rambouillet or Dorset × Rambouillet) with progesterone and gonadotropin treatments. Sheep grazing was supplemented with a protein bank of Leucaena leucocephala. Ewes were supplied with a concentrate of 3 Mcal ME/kg and 18% CP 1 month before and 1 month after lambing. Oestrus synchronization or induction was performed with progesterone and gonadotropins. Females were bred 48-69 h after sponge retrieval. Of the treated sheep 97% showed oestrus. Average fertility was 66%. Seasonally low lambing rate was from March to July in the absence of hormone treatments. Hormone treated sheep (hair sheep and crossbreds) showed increased (P < 0.01) fertility in 8 out of 12 months. Higher difference in fertility was due to treatment in January to May. Fertility was highest from June to December. Overall prolificacy of treated ewes was 1.93 ± 0.32 versus 1.79 ± 0.21 for controls. Hormone treated ewes had a greater percentage of twins, triplets and quadruplets than controls. Overall yield of lambs from treated ewes was 29.86 kg per year compared to 19.99 kg for controls, however since controls had more single lambs, overall birth weight was in favour of controls (2.20 versus 1.85). It is concluded that crosses of Rambouillet or Rambouillet × Dorset males with Pelibuey and Barbados Blackbelly hair ewes increased lamb crop, birth weight, and number of parturitions per ewe per year under tropical conditions in Mexico. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - A lack of feed resources has been identified as the major constraint in ruminant livestock production in the tropics. Although forages, such as grasses, legumes and tree forages and the agro-industrial by-products, such as palm kernel cake, are available in abundance, their utilisation as animal feeds are limited due to the presence of dietary factors which may affect the voluntary intake and the entero-hepatic function of the animals. These dietary factors include saponins and copper in the palm kernel cake, mimosine and tannin in the tree legume (Leucaena leucocephala), sapogenins (epi-sarsasapogenin and epi-smilagenin) in the Signal grass (Brachiaria decumbens) and indospicine in the creeping indigo (Indigofera spicata). Great economic losses through general unthriftiness, poor weight gain, inefficient production and death have been attributed to these dietary factors. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The productivity and nutritive value of 10 leucaena accessions (1 L. leucocephala; 5 hybrids; 1 composite; 2 L. diversifolia; 1 L. pallida) were compared with that of L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham for 6 sampling occasions over 31 months at Tumbi-Tabora, western Tanzania. Total annual yields of 4 accessions and edible dry matter (DM) yields of 5 accessions consistently exceeded that of cv. Cunningham. DM yields of the highest yielding accessions (L. pallida CPI 94581; hybrid KX2; and L. diversifolia No. 8 CPI 85132) were 2.5 times that of cv. Cunningham for total yield and twice for edible DM yield. Nitrogen and potassium levels were highest in cv. Cunningham and calcium and magnesium concentrations varied between entries but all nutrients except phosphorus in some entries and potassium in all entries were adequate for growth in ruminants. Cultivar Cunningham was more digestible and contained less acid detergent fibre than the other accessions. The superiority in yield of the entries over the commercial cultivar emphasises the need to evaluate them further over a range of environments.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare growth, coppicing, and biomass production of 17 accessions of Leucaena leucocephala widely distributed for planting in East and Southern Africa by National Tree Seed Centres in Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Kenya. A widely used accession in alley cropping in West Africa was also included. The trial was established in 1989 on a sandy loam soil in a sub-humid unimodal rainfall area at Makoka, Malawi. Assessments were done for survival at 3 months and at 15 and 30 months after establishment for height, diameter at the root collar, number of branches and biomass production. Survival was generally good for most accessions (> 90%) with the exception of an accession from Machakos, Kenya (No. 84511) which had a survival ofonly67%. Fifteen months after establishment, accessions from Yimbo (Kenya),and two K8 accessions from Kasama (Zambia) and Machakos (Kenya) achieved the best height of over 3.2 m. Poor accessions included accession No. 84511 from Machakos (Kenya), Peru (ex. Makoka, Malawi), and the West African accession from HTA (Nigeria) whose height was less than 2.5 m. At 15 months, 12 of the accessions tested showed high total biomass production (dry wt), 25 - 38 t ha-1. The foliage biomass (leaves, twigs and pods) yields exceeded 101 ha-1 in all but one accession from Makoka, Malawi and another from Korogwe, Tanzania. After clear cutting, all the Leucaena accessions coppiced and grew exceptionally well, achieving very high biomass production in only 15 months. The highest yields were produced by accessions from Isiolo, Kenya (47.71 ha-1); Namiyanga, Malawi (42.2 t ha-1); Yimbo, Kenya (36.3 t ha-1) and accession Pursa from Kasama, Zambia (35.61 ha-1). Poor accessions yielded less than 201 ha-1 and included local seed sources of Peru and Cunningham from Makoka, Malawi and the West African accession from IITA, Ibadan, Nigeria.

AB  - Biological dinitrogen fixation in Casuarina equisetifolia J.R. and G. Forst, and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit was evaluated using the 15N- enrichment technique under field conditions in single species and mixed- species plantings (with a nonfixing reference species, Eucalyptus X robusta J.E. Smith) between 1.0 and 3.5 years of age in Puerto Rico. Following periodic labelling of trenched and untrenched plantation quadrats with 15N- enriched ammonium sulfate, analyses of foliar and whole-tree (weighted average) N-isotopic ratios and total biomass N were used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen derived from biological dinitrogen fixation (PNDFA) and total nitrogen derived from fixation (TNDFA) in C. equisetifolia and L. leucocephala. The 15N-enrichment technique yielded accurate estimates of dinitrogen fixation in maturing stands of these two tree species provided the reference species (Eucalyptus) was grown in close proximity to the N-fixing species in trenched, mixed-species plots. Changes in the 15N/14N ratio of soil-available nitrogen in single-species plots of the N-fixing and reference were found to yield inaccurate estimates of dinitrogen fixation in the single-species plots of C. equisetifolia and L. leucocephala after 2 years of age. The results confirm earlier findings that foliar sampling is a useful nondestructive alternative to whole tree biomass sampling for the 15N- enrichment protocol. Between 1.0 and 3.5 years after plantation establishment, PNDFA in C. equiselifolia remained relatively constant between 50 and 60%, while PNDFA in L. leucocephala declined from nearly 100% at 1 year to less than 40% at 3.5 years. The rate of dinitrogen fixation (kg-ha- 1-year-1) did not decline as the stands matured. Cumulative dinitrogen fixation (TNDFA) estimates at 3.5 years were very similar between species: 73 in C. equisetifolia and 74 kg N-ha-1-year-1 in L. leucocephala.

AB  - The recovery of a single application of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf N (78 kg N ha-1) in a maize crop, the hedgerow and the top 10 cm soil of a leucaena alley cropping system was measured for 236 d through the use of 15N labeled residues. The leucaena-derived-N (LDN) was followed in the surface litter and the soil-litter - separated by a flotation method on water - during the same period. At 45 and 129 d after the residue application (DAA), only 4.2 and 10.0% of the added leucaena N was recovered in the maize crop while the aboveground hedgerow incorporated 9.6 and 9.4% in its first and second canopy regrowth. At 45 and 129 DAA, 19.7 and 13.2% remained in the surface litter and soil. Total recoveries were 33.5 and 42.2% on the respective dates. The C and N content of the coarse (larger than 2 mm) and fine (between 2 and 0.25 mm) soil-litter fraction of the top 5 cm layer strongly increased after residue application. Soil total C in the total soil- litter decreased from 22% at 45 DAA to 8% at 236 DAA A significant positive relationship (1% level) was found between the microbial biomass C and the total soil-litter C. The LDN release rate from the combined surface litter- coarse soil-litter was 0.0477 d-1, while the fine soil-litter had a LDN release rate of 0.0083 d-1. Only 8.6% of the released surface litter- coarse soil-litter LDN entered the fine soil-litter pool. These turnover rates lead to a poor synchronization of the LDN released from all litter pools with the maize LDN uptake during the first 45 d of maize growth, while between day 45 and 129, all released LDN was recovered either in the soil, maize or hedgerow.

AB  - Alley cropping with leguminous tree hedgerows planted on contours is an emerging practice in the northern highlands of Rwanda where field slopes range from 4 to 76% and loss of soil fertility due to erosion is the principal impediment to food production. Sesbania sesban and Leucaena Leucocephala, the two woody species recommended for alley cropping in the region, do not perform equally well across sites: Sesbania is faster growing, but is more sensitive to pruning than Leucaena. We tested the hypothesis that the two species could be grown together to make the best use of their relative advantages. Species were planted in pure and 1:1 mixed stands at 26 sites to give a range of altitudes, slopes, azimuths and soil fertility levels representative of the region. During two cropping seasons' growth spanning 19 months, in pure stands, Sesbania produced more biomass, grew taller and had thicker stems than Leucaena: for the same species, stem diameter and height were not different in pure and mixed stands. Biomass and number of poles from 1:1 mixed stands of Sesbania and Leucaena were equivalent to biomass and pole numbers from Sesbania in pure stands. However, mixed stands produced more biomass and pole numbers than Leucaena in pure stands. Growth of S. sesban was positively correlated with soil pH, potassium and altitude; whereas, growth of L. leucocephala was positively correlated with soil phosphorus, but negatively correlated with field slope. All other soil and site variables tested were nonsignificant. The study suggests that farmers can plant S. sesban and L. leucocephala in 1:1 mixtures in an alley cropping setting and retain levels of biomass production and bean pole numbers equivalent to those from S. sesban alone without compromising future growth and production by Leucaena. As well, the impact of pH, K and P on growth and production of Sesbania and Leucaena as a function of field slope and altitude should be determined before extending their use to other regions. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

TI  - Occurrence of a novel galactopinitol and its changes with other non- reducing sugars during development of Leucaena leucocephala seeds
PY  - 1996

AB  - A new cyclitol which is abundant in the late developmental stages of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) seeds was identified by HPLC, NMR, and GC-MS as O-α-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 1)-3-O-methyl-D- chiroinositol, a new galactopinitol. This galactopinitol was initially detected midway through seed development and increased to 10.2 mg (g DW)- 1, but decreased in mature seeds to its about a half. Stachyose content increased greatly and remained the most abundant of the soluble sugars in mature seeds (25.6 mg (g DW)-1). Artificial drying at 73% relative humidity of 70 DPA immature seeds induced the accumulation of raffinose, stachyose, galactopinitol and galactinol, but the total amounts of these sugars were only about half of those found in mature seeds. Seed germination decreased following an initial increase after 8 d artificial drying to a moisture content of 24%, and this dehydration damage probably is because of underdevelopment of seed tissue. Galactopinitol changes in a similar fashion to the oligosaccharides during the late developmental stage and dehydration experiment, implying that galactopinitol may play a role in desiccation tolerance of leucaena seeds.

AB  - Eight Philippine forages were studied to obtain the following: 1) nutrient concentrations and digestibility, 2) distribution of the various minerals in fiber fractions through mineral analyses of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) residues, and 3) correlation coefficients among the factors affecting forage quality and mineral concentrations. These Philippine forages were paragrass [Brachiaria mutica (Forsk.) Stapf], stargrass (Cynodon plectostachyum Pilger), napiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.) calopo (Calopogonium muconoides Desv.), centrocema (Centrocema pubescens Benth.), gliricidia [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp.], leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.] and sesbania [Sesbania grandiflora (L.) Poir]. Species differences (p < 0.01) were observed on various nutrient fractions including mineral composition and digestibility. The cell wall (NDF) fraction, prepared by boiling in neutral detergent solution, contained the following proportions of the total mineral originally present (%): calcium (Ca), 0.7; phosphorus (P), 14.3; magnesium (Mg), 1.9; potassium (K), 3.7; copper (Cu), 16.4; zinc (Zn), 2.9; molybdenum (Mo), 9.3; cobalt (Co), 16.2; manganese (Mn), 5.6, and iron (Fe), 81.3. The ligno-cellulose (ADF) fraction, prepared by boiling in acid detergent solution, contained the following proportions of the total mineral originally present (%): Ca, 0.2; P, 4.4; Mg, 0.7; K, 2-8; Cu, 32.3; Zn, 1.1; Mo, 8.9; Co. 4.7; Mn, 5.4; and Fe, 36.8. Correlation coefficients among the factors affecting forage quality and mineral concentrations were also observed. Evidently, 75 and 45% of the minerals in grasses and legumes was positively correlated to CP and IVDMD, respectively. Moreover, 55, 80 and 75% of the forage minerals was negatively correlated to NDF, ADF, and ADL fraction, respectively, implying that most of the minerals reside in the non-structural cell components.

TI  - Impact of residue quality on the C and N mineralization of leaf and root residues of three agroforestry species
PY  - 1996

AB  - A laboratory incubation experiment with 15N labeled root and leaf residues of 3 agroforestry species (Leucaena leucocephala, Dactyladenia barteri and Flemingia macrophylla) was conducted under controlled conditions (25 °C) for 56 days to quantify residue C and N mineralization and its relationship with residue quality. No uniform relation was found between the chemical composition of the above and below residues. The leucaena and dactyladenia roots contained more lignin (8 and 26% respectively) and less N (2.0 and 1.0% respectively) than the respective leaves (2 and 13% lignin and 2.9 and 1.4% N, respectively), whereas the differences between the lignin and N contents of the flemingia leaves and roots were not significant (4.6 and 3.0% lignin and 2.63 and 2.68% N, respectively). The leucaena leaves contained more polyphenols than the roots (6.4 and 3.6%), while the polyphenol content of the leaves and roots of the other residues was similar (5.0 ad 5.1% for dactyladenia and 4.0 and 3.5% for flemingia). Three patterns of N mineralization could be distinguished. A first pattern, followed by residues producing the highest amounts of CO2, showed an initial immobilization of soil derived N, followed by a net release of both soil and residue derived N after 7 days of incubation. A second pattern, followed by the flemingia leaf residues which produced intermediate amounts of CO2 and had an intermediate quality, showed no significant immobilization of soil derived N, and significant mineralization of residue N. A third pattern, followed by both low quality dactyladenia residues, showed a low release of residue derived N and a continued inmobilization of soil derived N. Residue C mineralization was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with the residue lignin content, C-to-N ratio, and polyphenol-to-N ratio. The proportion of residue N mineralized (immobilized) after 56 days of incubation was significantly correlated with the residue N content (p < 0.01) and the C-to- N ratio (p < 0.05). The relations were quadratic, rather than linear. The ratio of the proportion of residue N mineralized (immobilized) over the proportion of residue C mineralized after 56 days was highly significantly correlated with the lignin content (p < 0.01) and C-to-N (p < 0.001), lignin- to-N (p < 0.01), polyphenol-to-N (p < 0.01) and (lignin+polyphenol)-to-N ratios (p < 0.01) in a linear way. This indicates that due to the low availability of the residue C, relatively less N is immobilized for the very low quality residues ((lignin+polyphenol)-to-N ratio: 29.7) than for the residues with a relatively higher quality ((lignin+polyphenol)-to-N ratios between 3.3 and 12.5).

AB  - Interspecfic hybridization in the genus Leucaena produces hybrid vigor, resulting in highly adaptable varieties that expand the growth range of the genus. This study was conducted to test the total biomass (combined stem and forage fraction), total forage dry matter (DM) yield, psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana Crawford) damage, and phenolic concentration of Leucaena F1 hybrids in comparison with species-level selections in two distinctly different environments. A total of 19 Leucaena spp. and hybrid selections were tested for 2 yr at the Waimanalo and Mealani Research Stations in Hawaii. Thirteen species and hybrid selections were replicated three times and included species selections from L. pallida Britton and Rose; L. leucocephala (Lain.) de Wit; L. diversifolia (Schlechtend.) Benth. (2n = 4x); and L. trichandra (Zucc.) Urban [syn. L. diversifolia (Schlechtend.) Benth. subsp. trichandra (Urban) F.J. Pan] (2n = 2x). Additionally, five selections were interspecific F1 hybrids and two were advanced-generation interspecific hybrids. Six other selections were augmented in the trials. Over 2 yr, L. pallida x L. leucocephala F1 hybrids (K748 x K636 and K748 x K584) had the highest DM yield at both locations. At Waimanalo, K748 x K636 produced 53.4 Mg ha-1 total DM biomass of which 24.6 Mg ha-1 was forage, while at Mealani, K748 x K636 produced 29.4 Mg ha-1 total DM biomass and 9.6 Mg ha-1 forage. These yields were twice those of L. leucocephala at Waimanalo and eight times greater at Mealani. Leucaena leucocephala was the most susceptible to psyllid damage (P < 0.001), while the most resistant was L. trichandra (2n = 2x). Leucaena pallida hybrids had intermediate levels of psyllid resistance. Psyllid damage was negatively correlated with forage DM once at Waimanalo (r = -0.37, P < 0.05, n = 42). Forage phenolic concentration averaged 110 mg g-1 for all treatments at both locations and was correlated once to psyllid damage (r = 0.32, P < 0.05, n = 42) at Waimanalo. Superior yield, psyllid resistance and cold tolerance of L. pallida x L. leucocephala hybrids was observed at low and high elevation sites.

AB  - Psyllid, a noxious insect, has spread everywhere in the tropical and sub-tropical regions. This insect has an habit of infesting Leucaena leucocephala. We have found that a crude enzyme of psyllid hydrolyzed mimosine, a strongly toxic substance for livestock, into 3-hydroxv-4(1H)-pyridone, pyruvic acid, and ammonia. Besides, this enzyme was also able to cleave 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - An experiment was carired out through a random block design with 4 replications in order to evaluate the performance of Leucaena leucocephala var. Peru sown alone in furrows or combined with 2, 3, 4 or 6 rows of Cynodon dactylon var. 68 between the legume furrows. Another treatment was also carried out consisting of sowing 6 rows of grass between Leucaena which should be 60-70 cm high. The yield of Cynodon 68 accumulated in the three samplings showed the highest values (P < 0.01) with the use of 3 (1137.2 g/DM/m2) and 4 (1074.4 g/DM/m2) rows. While, those treatments showed poor weed infestation (59.3 g/DM/m2 and 87.6 g/DM/m2, respectively). The poorest performance of Cynodon was observed when sown with Leucaena 60-70 cm high. Sowing all the rows while grass between the Leucaena furrows hampers the planting and cleaning of the grass and legume in the middle of the rows, respectively. Sowing 3 or 4 rows of Cynodon 68 with a 2 disk plowing betweeen Leucaena furrows 4 m apart when Leucaena plants are 8-9 cm high is recommended due to the economical and productive results of these treatments.

AB  - The natural abundance of 15N and 13C, conventional soil analyses, and biomass production by maize were used to study the influence of five tropical tree species on soils and their fertility. The experiment was conducted in Morogoro, Tanzania, to compare Cassia (Senna) siamea, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. tereticornis (all non-N2-fixing), Leucaena leucocephala, Prosopis chilensis (both N2-fixing), and a grass fallow. Maize biomass production, which was correlated with N uptake (P=0.001), was higher on soils from plots with 5-year-old Leucaena and Prosopis spp. compared to the grass fallow, while other tree species had less favourable effects on maize growth. The per cent N was higher in soil and δ15N of soil total N was lower under Prosopis sp. compared to soil under other tree species, which suggests an input from N2 fixation by Prosopis sp. A transfer of fixed N to maize or to understorey grass species was, however, not indicated by the 15N natural abundance. Prosopis sp. contributed more C to the soil than the other four tree species; the difference in δ13C between soils from Prosopis sp. plots and from grass fallow plots showed that the tree contributed 11% to the total C of the soil over a period of 8 years. The leaves of the N2-fixing species had a low ratio of lignin+phenols to N, and maize growth was negatively correlated with this parameter. The Eucalyptus spp. had leaves with a high lignin+phenols to N ratio, contributed very little C to the soil, and lowered the soil pH.

AB  - Recent work to establish and produce multipurpose trees is reviewed in terms of their production and role in animal feeding systems. A great deal of variability was found in fodder production, with Acacia angustissima, Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham, Gliricidia sepium and to some extent Cajanus cajan producing the highest fodder yields at both Domboshawa and Makoholi sites. However, with C. cajan the yields at Makoholi were much lower than at Domboshawa. Among the alternative species to the psyllid-prone L. leucocephala, A. angustissima has shown superior fodder productivity. Within the Leucaena genus L. esculenta subsp. paniculata (OFI 52/87), L. diversifolia subsp. stenocarpa (OFI 53/88), L. pallida (G2137) and to some extent L. pulverulenta (OFI 84/87) have shown the greatest potential at both Domboshawa and Makoholi. Due to differences in chemical composition, the different fodder trees were variable in the extent to which they can be relied upon as feed resources in Zimbabwe. Notable differences were found in fibre content, in vitro dry matter digestibility, acceptability and intake by livestock and therefore, their potential in affecting animal productivity. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Slow establishment has been identified as a major limitation to the more widespread adoption of the fodder tree Leucaena leucocephala in Queensland. Field experiments were conducted at Mt Cotton, Gayndah and Theodore in south-east Queensland during the 1987-88 summer to identify the major factors limiting first year yield of leucaena. Treatments at each site included irrigation (applied at sowing only, or at intervals throughout the trial), and rates of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and lime. Attack by psyllid insects, weed competition and defoliation by wildlife were noted and minimised where possible. Soil moisture appeared to be the major limitation to plant growth at the inland sites of Theodore and Gayndah where post-establishment irrigation increased final dry weight by 250%. Waterlogging reduced plant height increase at the low lying Mt Cotton site following higher than normal rainfall. Increase in plant height at the other sites stopped when night temperatures fell below 15°C. Application of P at 75-1200 kg/ha tripled final dry weight of leucaena at Mt Cotton (5 mg/kg bicarbonate-extractable P) but had no effect at Theodore (10 mg P/kg) or Gayndah (35 mg P/kg). Larger than normal responses to P during early growth may be due to slow colonisation of the roots by arbuscular mycorrhiza. Application of N (200 kg N/ha) increased dry weight of Rhizobium-inoculated leucaena by 27% at Theodore but had little or no effect at the other sites. Application of lime had no significant effects on plant height or dry weight of leucaena at Mt Cotton despite the soil being slightly acidic (pH 5.9 in 1:5 H2O suspension). Further work on the role of colonisation by arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi in determining uptake of P by leucaena is warranted in view of the large response to very high rates of P in young seedlings at Mt Cotton.

AB  - Most of the work discussed in the paper is part of the Agroforestry Research Network for Africa (AFRENA). In the sub-humid highlands the most common form of livestock management is a mixture of grazing, tethering and stall feeding. In the arid and semi-arid lowlands of Kenya the normal livestock management practice is grazing. Leucaena leucocephala was a popular fodder species until it was attacked by the leucaena psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana) to which other species like L. diversifolia, L. esculenta and L. pallida have shown some degree of tolerance. Sesbania spp. showed early promise but did not withstand intensive cutting management. In Kenya, when Calliandra calothyrsus is grown in 4:1 and 1:1 grass-legume combinations the fodder yields are higher than for pure hedgerows. Cutting C. calothyrsus 6 months before the height of the dry season gives maximum yield during that season. For dairy cows 1 kg of concentrates can be successfully replaced by 3 kg of fresh C. calothyrsus. At altitudes above 2300 m supplementation with Mimosa scabrella enabled local goats to gain 50 g day-1 compared with 31 g day-1 for grass alone. In Kenya a survey was conducted on farmers' practices and knowledge of indigenous fodder trees. Some identified popular species were Commiphora zimmermanii, Triumfetta spp., Tithonia diversifolia, Melia volkensii and Crotalaria goodiiformis. Both indigenous and exotic tree species are being fed to cattle to determine the exact parts that are consumed and to assess their nutritive value. Further research is needed on inclusion levels of tree fodder in diets, optimal management of fodder trees in the dry land farming systems and anti-nutritive factors in some tree species. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Effects of leaf water deficit and increase in endogenous ABA on photosynthesis of two tropical trees, Acacia confusa and Leucaena leucocephala, were investigated with two soil-drying methods, i.e. half or whole root system was subjected to soil drying. Half-root drying was achieved by allowing upper layer of soil column to dry and lower layer of soil column to remain watered. Half-root drying had little effect on leaf water potential, but when compared to the well-watered control, both methods of soil drying substantially increased the ABA concentration in xylem and reduced leaf conductance in both species. There was a significant relationship between leaf conductance and xylem ABA concentrations in both species, which was comparable to the same relationship that was generated by feeding ABA to excised twigs. The rate of photosynthesis was inhibited substantially in both soil-drying treatments and in both species, but photochchemical efficiency, measured as a ratio of variable fluorescence to a peak fluorescence emission of a dark-adapted leaf (F(y)/F(m)), was not reduced except in the whole root-dried L leucocephala plants where leaf water potential was reduced to -2.5 MPa. In all the cases where photosynthesis was inhibited, there was a concomitant reduction in both leaf conductance and calculated internal CO2 concentration. After two days of rewatering, leaf water potential and xylem ABA concentration rapidly returned to pre-treatment levels, but leaf conductance and photosynthesis of both whole-root and half root dried L. leucocephala remained inhibited substantially. Rewatering led to a full recovery of both stomatal conductance and photosynthesis in soil-dried A. confusa, although its photosynthesis of whole-root dried plants did not recover fully but such difference was not significant statistically. These results suggest that drought-induced decline of photosynthesis was mainly a result of the stomatal factor caused by the increase of ABA concentration in the xylem sap. Non-stomatal factors, e.g. reduced photochemical activity and/or carbon metabolic activity, were species-specific and were brought about only at very low water potential.

AB  - The above-ground biomass yield of seven-year-old trees of Gliricidia sepium, Gmelina arborea and Leucaena leucocephala grown for fuel production were assessed. The combustion properties of the fuelwood and charcoal produced from the trees (moisture content, density, percentage fixed carbon, volatile matter, micro-elemental composition and heat of combustion) were determined. There were significant differences in the above-ground biomass and the charcoal yield from the various species. The stand biomass was 37.4 t/ha for Gliricidia sepium, 85.6 t/ha for Gmelina arborea and 46.2 t/ha for Leucaena leucocephala. The charcoal yield (range 25-42%) was highest in Leucaena leucocephala. The average heat of combustion of charcoal, 33.25 MJ/kg, was higher than that of wood, 21.6 MJ/kg. Gmelina arborea gave the greatest energy yield per hectare due to its high stand biomass.

AB  - Palatability indices of dry and wilted 18 multipurpose tree species (MPTs) were determined using 12 wethers and 12 bucks (mean ± SD liveweight 17.5 ± 1.24 kg and 20.5 ± 1.46 kg, respectively), blocked into two groups on liveweight and age, housed in a roofed and half-walled shed with individual feeding pens. The 18 MPTs were randomly grouped into sets of six by form (dried and wilted), such that each animal received three samples of each form. Each animal received 0.5 kg teff straw (Eragrostis tef) in addition to 0.4 kg and 0.2 kg of the wilted and dry forms of the appropriate MPTs, respectively, daily at 08:00 h over a 12-day experimental period. Dry matter intake of MPTs on day 1 (A1), average intakes on days 2-4 (A2), days 5-8 (A3), days 9-12 (A4) and days 2-12 (A5) were compared. A significant (P < 0.0001) decrease in intake, with correlation coefficients of r = 0.92 (A1 and A2), r = 0.88 (A1 and A5) and r = 0.85 (A1 and A3) in sheep, was observed. A similar trend was observed for palatability indices R1, R2, R3 and R4. A close relationship was observed between R2 and R5 (r = 0.91), R3 and R5 (r = 0.97), and R4 and R5 (r = 0.94). R1 was poorly correlated with R5 (r = 0.61). The same trend was found in goats. Linear regressions of A5 on A1, A5 on A2, A5 on A3 and A5 on A4 (adj. r2 = 0.81, 0.95, 0.97, 0.94 and r2 = 0.64, 0.90, 0.97, 0.94 in sheep and goats, respectively) showed that the best relationship existed between A5 and A3. The results of analysis of variance for palatability index R5 showed that the palatability index significantly (P < 0.001) depended on previous clustering and animal species. The cluster means for R5 were 1.34, 1.02, 0.68 and 0.54 for clusters 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. However, the palatability indices for goats were more than double those for sheep (1.33 vs. 0.48). There were no significant interaction effects for cluster, form and animal species. In this study the form of feed (wilted or dry) did not affect the palatability index. Acacia persiciflora, Leucaena leucocephala and Chamaecytisus palmensis were ranked high by both sheep and goats. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Uricase II is a purine metabolic enzyme highly induced in root nodules during the symbiosis established between legumes and bacteria of the genera Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium. Here we describe the characterization of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) nodule uricase II cDNA and show that uricase II is encoded by a single gene in the bean genome. This gene is also expressed in cotyledons, roots, and hypocotyls during bean seedling establishment, and an antiuricase antibody recognizes the protein in different seedling organs. Uricase II has also been found in Leucaena leucocephala seedlings, suggesting that it participates during seedling establishment in legumes that do not transport ureides. A 50-kD polypeptide that is detected by the anti-uricase antibody is found in cotyledons during seedling development. This higher-molecular-mass form is also detected in developing roots and hypocotyls but not in nodules. In situ hybridization experiments in root seedlings showed uricase II transcripts in the metaxylem parenchyma cells and phloem fibers of the vascular system.

AB  - We have explored a method to collect xylem sap using a Scholander pressure chamber for potted plants. Intact root system in pots which fitted the pressure chamber was pressurized at a pneumatic pressure numerically equal to the absolute value of shoot water potential. The rate of xylem flow obtained from the stem stump under such pressure was found similar to the rate of transpiration before detopping. The rate of pressurized flow from detopped roots was linearly related to the pressure applied in both well-watered and soil-dried plants. The osmotic concentration of the xylem sap was negatively related to the rate of volume flow, suggesting the necessity to collect xylem sap at in vivo flow rate if original solute concentration is to be evaluated. The concentration of ABA in the xylem sap, however, did not show such a relationship with water flux. Both well-watered and soil-dried plants showed the concentration of ABA in xylem sap largely stable with a range of volume flow rate, indicating a linear relationship between the rate of ABA delivery through xylem and that of volume flow. We also compared the concentrations of ABA in xylem sap sequentially collected from pressurized roots with that from detached shoots of the same plants. The concentration of ABA in the initial saps from shoots showed to be similar to that from roots. However, a decrease in the concentration of ABA in the xylem sap collected from detached leaf or twig was observed when more volume of sap was collected, which might also be dependent on the plant species and the volume of xylem vessels concerned.

AB  - Methanolic extracts of 79 Malaysian plants representing 42 families were assessed for antinematodal activity against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus using a fungal-feeding assay. Extracts of 27 plants from 19 families showed antinematodal activity, while 52 species were inactive. Five extracts (Sauropus androgynus, Eugenia polyantha, Areca catechu, Piper betle and Piper nigrum) exhibited very strong activity against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus at a minimum effective dose (MED) of 0.625 mg per ball. Strong antinematodal activity (MED: 1.25-2.5 mg per ball) was shown by the extracts of Spondias cyntherea, Codiageum variegatum, Euodia glabra and Cicca acida. Eleven extracts (Carica papaya, Ipomoea aquatica, Ocimum basilicum, Leea gigantea, Pithecellobium jiringa, Crypteronia paniculata, Myristica fragrans, Murraya koenigii, Leucaena leucocephala, Melastoma malabathricum and Morinda citrifolia) demonstrated moderate activity between MED of 5 and 10 mg per ball, and weak activity was observed in seven extracts (Ipomoea batatas, Cymbopogon citratus, Garcinia atroviridis, Psophocarpus tetragonolobus, Tamarindus indica, Allium odorum and Stenochalaena palustris).

AB  - This study evaluates the impact of the moisture content of biomass on thermal efficiency and relative boiler size which directly represent the economic merits of biomass drying. A model for predicting the moisture content of bundled Leucaena (Leucocephala) trees under open environment was validated for tropical Hawaii. Cumulative precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) are the major factors affecting the biomass moisture content change. ET was computed using Hargreave's model, which requires only temperature and solar radiation data. Integration of these models made it possible to calculate the thermal efficiency and relative boiler size when using bundled trees as a fuel under a given drying regime and for a specific geographical location.; This study evaluates the impact of the moisture content of biomass on thermal efficiency and relative boiler size which directly represent the economic merits of biomass drying. A model for predicting the moisture content of bundled Leucaena (Leucocephala) trees under open environment was validated for tropical Hawaii.

ET was computed using Hargreave's model, which requires only temperature and solar radiation data. Integration of these models made it possible to calculate the thermal efficiency and relative boiler size when using bundled trees as a fuel under a given drying regime and for a specific geographical location. A geographic information system provided the temperature and precipitation data required for evaluating the spatial variation in boiler efficiency and size for the 1440 km2 island of Kauai. Depending on the time of harvest, the Leucaena moisture content varied from 35 to 69% (on wet basis) following a period of 6 months of in-field drying. Boiler efficiency using fuelwood with this range of moisture content varied from 49 to 73%. Boiler relative size varied from 1.2 to 2.2 times the size required when Leucaena with 0% moisture content is used as a fuel. The spatial and temporal effects on the value of biomass were thus found to be important factors for various sites in the study area. The methods for quantifying the merit of biomass moisture management proposed in this paper demonstrate how GIS modeling can lead to appropriate decision-making capability in bioenergy.

AB  - A two-year field experiment was undertaken on an Alfisol in the forest-savanna transition zone of southwestern Nigeria, to study the effect of alley cropping, root barrier, application of N fertilizer and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit. prunings, on N utilization by maize and Leucaenahedgerows. The trial was conducted using a split-plot design with three replications. Mainplot treatments were alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala planted at 4m interhedgerow spacing and control (no hedgerows). Four subplot treatments were with and without addition of hedgerow prunings, and with and without presence of root barriers. There were no significant effects of presence of Leucaena hedgerows and root barriers on maize grain yield. Leucaena hedgerows recovered about 7% of the 30 kgN/ha applied as (15NH4)2SO4 to maize during one year. Application of hedgerow prunings increased maize yield by 82% and N-uptake in the grain by 50% over the treatment without prunings. Recoveries of 15N-labelled prunings and fertilizer N by maize plants were about 10 and 16% respectively. Prunings addition increased 15N-fertilizer recovery in main season maize and the residual value during the minor season by about 36% over the treatment without prunings. Pruning N-use efficiency was higher for plants grown adjacent to the hedgerows than in the middle of alleys during main season and the reverse was observed during the minor season. Absence of a root barrier increased N-use from prunings. Large amounts of applied N in the system were unaccounted for. Results of the trial showed, that without root barrier there was no measurable below-ground N competition between Leucaena hedgerows and maize.

AB  - The distribution, and the morphological and genetic variation of the cultivated taxa of the genus Leucaena (especially L. esculenta, guaje rojo and guaje colorado, and L. leucocephala, guaje verde and guaje blanco, are discussed in terms of their long history as arboreal food resources. In order to understand the domestication process it is essential to understand the changes in management, diffusion and importance of this natural resource throughout the prehistoric, prehispanic, colonial, modern and contemporary periods of Mexican history. In this article the principal documents of the contact period (Florentine Codex, writings of Francisco Hernandez and sixteenth century Relaciones Geograficas) are analyzed to examine the effect of culture change on the domestication process. The persistence of Prehispanic uses and management of Leucaena as a source of food is documented. Today's patterns appear to be both a product of neglect of the plant by the conquerors, and the cultural resilience of the native people.

AB  - Twenty intact and five fistulated crossbred steers were used in two experiments to examine the effect of supplementing maize stover with Gliricidia sepium or Leucaena leucocephala forage on intake, rumen fermentation, microbial protein supply and live weight changes. The basal diet plus 1 kg maize bran was offered alone or supplemented with 7.5, 15, 22.5 or 30 g DM/kg W0.75 of gliricidia (experiment 1), and with either 15 or 30 g DM/kg W0.75 of gliricidia or leucaena forage (experiment 2). Supplementation increased total dry matter intake (TDMI) (P < 0.001). DMI of stover was depressed (P < 0.001) in experiment 1 from 2.1 to 1.3 kg/day, but increased at the lower levels of supplementation in experiment 2. Diet digestibility was only significantly increased in experiment 2. Supplementation increased the rumen ammonia from 53 to 106 mg/1 and from 31 to 111 mg/1 in experiment 1 and 2 respectively, and tended to improve the degradation characteristics of the basal diet. The efficiency of microbial N supply ranged between 21.0 and 27.7 g N/kg DOMR. The live weight gains from supplementation were greater, and the responses to gliricidia and leucaena did not differ significantly. It is concluded that the supplementation improved dry matter intake and live-weight gains, and that Gliricidia sepium could be an alternative supplement to Leucaena leucocephala. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Four creole rams of 26 kg of average live weight were used in a Latin square design (4 x 4) in order to study the effect of different levels of inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru on the consumption and digestibility of the fiber. Treatments consisted on substituing 0, 20, 40 and 60 % of the dry matter of a ration of star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) hay for leucaena forage. The levels of inclusion of the legume had a positive linear effect on the DM consumption: 64.8, 66.5, 71.3 and 73.0 g/kg LW0.75 and in the neutral detergent fibre (NDF) digestibility: 44.5, 46.7, 49.3 and 56.0 % for treatments with 0, 20, 40 and 60 % of leucaena, respectively. The NDF consumption was very similar for all treatments and ranged between 49-50 g/kg LW0.75. Results showed that the inclusion of leucaena in diets of star grass hay improves total fibre digestibility and increases the DM consumption up to a level which seems to depend on the quantity of NDF present in the rumen.

AB  - The potential of Stenotaphrum secundatum (buffalo grass) as a forage species for ruminants is reviewed. Buffalo grass has been used as a pasture grass to a limited extent in Florida, the Caribbean, the Pacific Islands and Australia. From agronomic and animal production data, it is concluded that buffalo grass has value as a pasture grass for shaded, humid-tropical environments in developing countries, where smallholders require a robust, persistent grass. Considerable genetic variation exists within the species with the sterile triploid types showing greatest potential for grazing. Dry matter productivity is only moderate but buffalo grass is tolerant of a wide range of edapho-climatic conditions. Its moderate nutritive value can be improved by combination with legumes such as Leucaena leucocephala, Arachis pintoi cv. Amarillo, Aeschynomene americana cv. Glenn and Desmodium spp. Animal production from buffalo grass is highly sensitive to stocking rate. It has been well adopted by smallholders grazing cattle under coconuts in the Pacific Islands because of its ease of establishment and tolerance of long-term heavy grazing. The ability of buffalo grass to form a dense, stable and weed-free sward under heavily shaded and heavily grazed conditions makes it worthy of consideration for grazing under plantation crop systems.

AB  - In two dry and two wet seasons forage of pigeon pea, leucaena and sesbania were fed to growing goats as supplements to natural grazing over a two year period. The supplemented goats gained live-weights faster (P < 0.05) than the control animals. Intakes of pigeon pea (63.1 to 91.4 g/head/day) and leucaena (52.6 to 93.8 g/head/day) were consistently higher (P < 0.05) than that of sesbania (49.7 to 83.4 g/head/day) and this was reflected in liveweight gains in both wet and dry season. Liveweight gains ranged from 25.5 to 43.2, 16.7 to 37.5, 14.4 to 28.3 and 6.7 to 21.6 g/head/day for goats supplemented with pigeon pea, leucaena, sesbania and the control animals respectively. Preliminary cost-benefit analysis of the results indicate that such interventions are likely to be economically attractive and the responses provide a basis for improvement of goat production in the Tabora agro-pastoral systems.

AB  - When multipurpose-tree (MPT) prunings are used as a source of nitrogen to annual corps in agroforestry systems, it is important that high levels of N recovery are attained. In order to test the effect of pruning quality and method of pruning application on N-recovery rates, a field experiment was conducted using prunings of five MPT species and two methods of application (surface versus incorporation). There was an interaction of pruning quality and method of pruning application on N recovery and maize grain yield. For most MPT species used, incorporated prunings gave high nitrogen recovery compared to surface applied prunings. In order to achieve synchrony between N supply from prunings and N demand by a maize crop, relatively large amounts of N should be released into the soil before peak N demand by the maize crop. This could be achieved by incorporating adequate quantities of high quality prunings such as those of Cajanus cajan and Leucaena leucocephala. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Appropriate 15N-labeling methods are crucial for estimating N2-fixation in trees used in agroforestry systems. A 4-year field experiment was conducted on an Alfisol in Southwestern Nigeria to compare the estimates of N2 fixed in Leucaena leucocephala, using two non-N2-fixing leguminous trees, Senna siamea and S. spectabilis, as reference plants and three different methods of introducing 15N into soil. The atom % 15N uptake pattern (as reflected in the leaves) was identical in both N2- and non-N2-fixing tree species irrespective of the 15N-application method. There was a significant decline in atom % 15N excess in the leaves of L. leucocephala (from 0.266 to 0.039), S. siamea (0.625 to 0.121), and S. spectabilis (from 0.683 to 0.118) from the first sampling 12 months after planting and the second sampling 18 months after sampling. From the second harvest in 1991 until the end of the experiment (fifth) harvest in 1993, however, the atom 15N % excess decline in leaves of the three species was less pronounced and depended on the method of 15N application. In those plants to which the tracer was applied once at planting, the 15N decline was steady between the second and the last prunings. In the split-application treatment, the atom 15N % excess increased slightly at the third pruning and decreased during the subsequent two prunings. The reference tree and the method of 15N application influenced the estimated proportion of N derived from atmospheric N2 by L. leucocephala, calculated as 73 and 64%, corresponding to 119 and 98 kg N ha-1 of N2 fixed per 6 months, when S. spectabilis and S. siamea were used as reference trees, respectively. The approach by which 15N-labeled fertilizer was applied to the soil in three splits gave slightly higher estimates of N derived from the atmosphere but this was of little agronomic significance because total N2 fixed was similar for all methods.

AB  - The effect of fresh leaves of Gliricidia sepium, Acacia mangium, Leucaena leucocephala and Senna siamea on P availability and uptake from phosphate rocks from North Carolina (NCPR), Christmas Island (CIPR), China (CPR), Algeria (APR) and Tunisia (TPR) was studied. The 32P isotope dilution technique was used in a pot experiment with sweet corn. APR was the most reactive PR whilst CPR was the least reactive in the absence of green manures (GMs). GMs generally increased the solubility of the less reactive PRs and depressed that of the more reactive ones. This was believed to be through nutrient supply and release of P; and indirectly by decreasing or increasing P fixing capacity. The extent of the influence was observed to be dependent on GM quality, especially C:P ratio.

AB  - Nodulation potential, nitrogen fixation efficiency (nitrogenase activity) and biomass yield response of Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia nilotica to inoculation with 6 selected fast growing Rhizobium strains was explored in long-term (5 year) field trials. All the strains formed nodules and fixed nitrogen in L. leucocephala and A. nilotica. Seasonal effects on nitrogenase activity was observed and in winter (ambient temperature about 20 °C), nitrogenase activity could not be detected. However, with the onset of spring and a rise in temperature, fresh nodulation (renodulation) by all the inoculant rhizobial strains was observed in both the tree legumes. In L. leucocephala, maximum renodulation was exhibited by strain A1 while in A. nilotica, strain AB3 formed the maximum renodulation 24 months after transplantation. Dry matter yield of all the inoculated plants demonstrated a significant increase over that of the uninoculated plants at the end of five years after transplanting. In L. leucocephala, strain NGR8 gave the maximum response (45% more dry matter yield) in dry matter production while in A. nilotica, strain USDA 3325 showed a 25% increase in total dry matter yield five years after transplantation.

AB  - In a long-term study, 21 Barbari male kids were divided into five groups and fed Leucaena leucocephala fodder to supply 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% of their crude protein (CP) requirements. At varying periods some animals developed enlargement of the facial bone and exophthalmos. First appearance of these signs was recorded in an animal supplied 75% of its CP requirements through leucaena, after 264 days on the diet. Subsequently, other animals displayed these signs after 480 and 570 days on 100% CP from leucaena (two animals), and 660 days on 25 and 50% CP from leucaena (one animal each) in the ration. In all, five animals exhibited signs similar to those of mandibular osteodystrophy fibrosa. The incidence of the disorder was significant (P < 0.05). A Ca and P balance study performed after 336 days of leucaena feeding revealed that two animals on 100% and one animal on 25% CP from leucaena in the ration were not able to store P in the body. Histological examination of the tissues, taken post-mortem, revealed changes in thyroid, parathyroid, kidney, adrenal, and pituitary glands of the affected animals.

TI  - Use of fodder resources by ruminants in warm climate countries
PY  - 1996
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3042976510&doi=10.1051%2fanimres%3a19960601&partnerID=40&md5=7aad8e72732623da5d3589ce15c84b32
AB  - Fodder resources provide the principal sources of feeds throughout the humid and sub-humid, arid and semi-arid and Mediterranean regions. They include grasses and legumes, and fibrous crop residues (FCR). Browse is another important source of fodder. The availability and use of the fodder resources is dependent on type of agroecosystem (e.g. humid and sub-humid to arid and semi-arid), cropping patterns and their intensity, type and concentration of animal species, and prevailing animal production systems. The productivity of ruminants is dependent on the potential of a feed to supply, through microbial degradation, balanced nutrients for production; digestible dry matter intake is highly correlated with animal productivity with individual feeds. Nutritive value relates to the capacity of a feed to supply nutrients to meet productive functions, and this is contingent on maximizing voluntary feed intake, potential digestibility, protein:energy (P/E) ratio, and availability of bypass nutrients, particularly proteins. FCR form the main base in feeding systems for ruminants throughout the tropics and the Mediterranean region, and in recent years considerable progress has been achieved in their use. A number of technologies can be applied singly or in combination: treatment with alkalis to increase digestibility, supplementation to improve overall digestion and provide balanced nutrients, use of bypass nutrients, and large scale on-farm application to demonstrate economic profitability. Supplementation is central to effective utilization and includes the use of multi-nutrient block licks (MNBL), non-protein nitrogenous sources, and a variety of leguminous forages like Acacia spp., Gliricidia maculata, Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis juliflora. Given the advances that have been made on the use of FCR, extending known technologies through on-farm testing and demonstration far outweighs the need for further research on the effects of pre-treatments or supplementation. Such effort must involve strategies for more effective use of the fodder resources, especially in large scale participatory on-farm situations. These need to address efficiency in integrated natural resource use, the totality of production-post-production-consumption systems, and demonstration of more sustainable animal production systems.

AB  - Competition for growth resources between woody and crop species is said to be the main reason for failure of hedgerow intercropping (alleycropping) in semiarid tropics, but the mechanisms of competition are not clearly understood. In this study, conducted in the semiarid highlands of Kenya, soil-water changes and root dynamics were monitored during two rainy seasons from a long-term, replicated, alleycropping experiment. The treatments were (i) maize (Zea mays L.) grown alone, without fertilizer; (ii) maize, without fertilizer, intercropped between hedgerows of leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit], with hedgerow prunings returned to the alleys; and (iii) maize grown alone, with fertilizer at 40 kg N and 18 kg P ha-1. Available water in 1.25 m of soil depth under alleycropping was lower than with maize alone. Depletion of soil water by hedgerows continued after maize harvest and carried water deficits in alleycropping from one season to the next. Leucaena provided 1.45 Mg ha-1 leaf biomass, which contained 41.6 kg N and 2.5 kg P ha-1; moreover, it added 0.51Mg ha-1 season-1 of root biomass to the soil, equivalent to 7 kg N and 0.2 kg P ha-1. Therefore, N contributed through the alleycropping system was equivalent to the recommended fertilizer level; the system, however, did not meet the P requirements of the crop. Maize did not respond to fertilizer in both seasons, and the alleycropped maize yielded lower than the unfertilized maize. Our study indicates that under water-limiting conditions, alleycropping is detrimental to crop yields because competition of trees with crops for water outweighs the likely soil- fertility benefits.

AB  - Structure and distribution of root systems were studied in 30-month old five tree species, Acacia nilotica, Leucaena leucocephala, Dalbergia sissoo, Azadirachta indica and Prosopis cineraria and two shrub species, P. juliflora and Cajanus cajan raised at a spacing of 4 × 0.5 m in an arid region of North-western India. Maximum penetration of root systems was observed in P. cineraria (138 cm of soil depth), followed by A. nilotica, D. sissoo, L. leucocephala and P. juliflora, whereas A. indica (85 cm) and C. cajan (65 cm) showed comparatively a shallow root systems. P. juliflora showed a maximum root spread (347 cm), followed by L. leucaena (228 cm), A. nilotica (216 cm), D. sissoo (187 cm), A. indica (95 cm), C. cajan (80 cm) and P. cineraria (31 cm). Top 30 cm of soil depth had the maximum distribution of root biomass in C. cajan, A. indica and L. leucaena (45-62% of the total), whereas the 30-60 cm soil horizon had the maximum distribution of root biomass in P. juliflora, A. nilotica and D. sissoo (34-40% of the total), Root distribution in P. cineraria was almost uniform throughout the soil column. Surficial location of a high proportion of roots in the stands of C. cajan, A. indica and L. leucaena indicates that these species will show strong root competition if intercropped with crops as compared to A. nilotica, D. sissoo and P. juliflora which had subsurface location of most of the roots. A vertical root system and narrow crown in P. cineraria, make the species most suitable for agroforestry system.

AB  - A field screening trial of seventeen different multi-purpose tree species was conducted with the objective to identify best adaptable species with desirable characters that could be used in various afforestation, Agroforestry and Social Forestry programmes for semi-arid regions of Central India. The species evaluated were Azadirachta indica, Bauhinia variegata, Eucalyptus F.R.I.-4, Albizia procera, Emblica officinalis, Pongamia pinnata, Gmelina arborea, Dalbergia sissoo, Dendrocalamus strictus, Albizia lebbek, Eucalyptus F.R.I.-5, Acacia benthami, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia auriculiformis, Tectona grandis, and Acacia catechu. Results suggested that Gmelina arborea, Azadirachta Indica and Leucaena leucocephala were among the fastest growing species with maximum MAI (Mean Annual Increment) making them promising candidate, for Agro and Social Forestry plantations. Acacia catechu, Albizia procera, Bauhinia variegata, Tectona grandis and Acacia benthami showed slow growth. Tectona grandis and Gmeli na arborea, species were found to be promising species for maximum survival. However Eucalyptus F.R.I.-5, Acacia auriculiformis and Bauhinia variegata are poorly adapted to the region (on the basis of survival).

TI  - NodZ of Bradyrhizobium extends the nodulation host range of Rhizobium by adding a fucosyl residue to nodulation signals
PY  - 1996
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-9544246868&doi=10.1046%2fj.1365-2958.1996.00644.x&partnerID=40&md5=ee3f54ac5eed0b719761804596751f20
AB  - The nodulation genes of rhizobia are involved in the production of the lipo-chitin oligosaccharides (LCO), which are signal molecules required for nodule formation. A mutation in nodZ of Bradyrhizobium japonicum results in the synthesis of nodulation signals lacking the wild-type 2-O-methylfucose residue at the reducing-terminal N-acetylglucosamine. This phenotype is correlated with a defective nodulation of siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum). Here we show that transfer of nodZ to Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar (bv) viciae, which produces LCOs that are not modified at the reducing-terminal N-acetylglucosamine, results in production of LCOs with a fucosyl residue on C-6 of the reducing-terminal N-acetylglucosamine. This finding, together with in vitro enzymatic assays, indicates that the product of nodZ functions as a fucosyltransferase. The transconjugant R. leguminosarum strain producing fucosylated LCOs acquires the capacity to nodulate M. atropurpureum, Glycine soja, Vigna unguiculata and Leucaena leucocephala. Therefore, nodZ extends the narrow host range of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae to include various tropical legumes. However, microscopic analysis of nodules induced on siratro shows that these nodules do not contain bacteroids, showing that transfer of nodZ does not allow R. leguminosarum to engage in a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with this plant.

AB  - Fifteen intact male Jamunapari goats, average body weight 22.0 ± 1.18 kg were divided into three groups of 5 animals in each to investigate the effects of feeding leucaena on energy retention and distribution of retained energy. Leucaena leaves and twigs provided 0%, 25% and 50% of CP in the rations of animals in L1 (control), L2 and L3 groups, respectively. Energy balances were determined in an open circuit respiration chamber from gaseous exchange and nitrogen carbon balances. Energy retentions calculated from gaseous exchange data were 181.6, 190.0 and 172.8 kJ/kg W0.75/d and from carbon-nitrogen balances were 178.2, 199.5 and 171.1 kJ/kg W0.75/d in L1, L2 and L3 groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed among the groups in both the methods. The retention of nitrogen and energy in the form of protein was similar in different treatment groups. Similarly, no significant effect was observed on energy retention in the form of fat and total energy retention due to incorporation of leucaena in the diets.

AB  - Field sample preservation and tissue selection for condensed tannin (CT) analysis were investigated with three Leucaena genotypes, L. leucocephala subspecies glabrata (Lam.) de Wit cv. Tarramba (K636), L pallida Britton and Rose (K806) and the F1 interspecific hybrid L. pallida (K748) × L. leucocephala (K636). Shoot, youngest fully expanded leaf (YFEL) and mature leaf (ML) tissues were analysed for extractable, protein and fibre-bound CT for each Leucaena species. There was no significant difference in CT content measured in excised tissues whether frozen by dry ice or liquid nitrogen. The shoot material of all genotypes contained more CT, of all components, than the YFEL and ML tissues. Extractable CT was highest in L. pallida, lowest in L. leucocephala and intermediate in the hybrid. The YFEL was selected as the most appropriate sample tissue because it was easily recognized, enabled consistent sampling of tissue at the same physiological stage of maturity, and contained sufficient CT for the determination of the CT status of each genotype. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - From 1986-1992 alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam,) de Wit and Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. was compared to a no-tree control, and fertilization with 90, 39 and 75 kg ha-1 N, P and K vs. no fertilization were studied in maize and cassava grown intercropped or in rotation. Light transmission measurements and row position effects on food crop yield did not indicate any decisive shading effect in tree-crop competition when trees were pruned 2-3 times a year. In the last three years, with NPK in solecropping the crop growth rates (CGR) of maize reached a peak of 100 g m-2 wk-1 around 70 days after planting (DAP). CGR in unfertilized Cajanus alleys was as high as in corresponding fertilized treatments but delayed by one month. For cassava, the highest growth rates of 60-130 gm-2 wk-1 lasted from 60 to 190 DAP with NPK in solecropping. The harvest index (HI) of cassava reached 40-55% in all intercropping and unfertilized solecropping treatments. The HI in solecropping was reduced by fertilization to 30-40% due to excessive leaf growth at 60-190 DAP. The increase in number of thickened roots starting at 30 DAP in solecropping was delayed by one month in intercropping. The reason for significantly higher cassava root yields in Cajanus alleys as compared to no trees in the fertilized solecrop was attributed to the enhanced root formation at 85 DAP due to a slower release of nutrients subject to leaching such as N and K from tree prunings than from mineral fertilizer.

AB  - Previous work has shown thai slow colonisation of roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may be responsible for the slow early seedling growth of leucaena in some soils. The aim of the following experiments was to determine relative population levels of AM fungi in a range of Australian soils and their effect on the growth and phosphorus nutrition of the tropical tree legume leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), grown in pots and in the field. Soils chosen were typical of those used for leucaena production in Queensland and included sites al which previous commercial plantings of leucaena had failed. Large differences were found in mycorrhizal population levels between soils and results of a bioassay ranged from 12 to 52% of leucaena root length infected. Results of the bioassay were significantly correlated with plant height of leucaena grown in pots at 28 and 42 days after sowing (P<0.05) and shoot weight 42 days after sowing (P<0.05). However, results of the bioassay were not positively correlated with plant growth of leucaena 63 days after sowing in pots or at any time in the field. This was because colonisation levels in most soils had reached levels that were adequate to meet the phosphorus requirements of the plant. Low population levels of AM fungi, therefore, do not appear to be a major long-term limitation to growth of leucaena in most soils. However, at 2 sites where previous commercial leucaena plantings had failed, other factors became relatively more important in limiting first season yield. These included poor soil physical structure, low phosphorus fertility and at 1 site, colonisation of leucaena roots with root knot nematode, a factor which had not previously been reported in Australia. Soil physical, chemical and biological factors, therefore, all need to be considered in selecting suitable sites for leucaena establishment.

AB  - The hypothesis to be tested in the present study was that the biomass yield of the multi-purpose tree Trichanthera gigantea would be enhanced by growing it under partial shade in association with either bananas or the legume tree Leucaena leucocephala. Two experiments of split-plot design were carried out. In the first experiment, the comparison was beween partial shade from bananas (at 5 m spacing) or no shade. In the second experiment, partial shade from Leucaena leucocephala (5 m spacings) was included as a third treatment. A higher proportion of the Trichanthera cuttings germinated in the shade than in the "sun". The biomass yield of Trichanthera was higher when it was associated with bananas than when planted alone or in association with Leucaena. The absence of effect of the Leucaena may have been because the canopy of this tree is more "open" than in the case of the bananas hence the shade effect was less. There were no significant differences for biomass yield of Trichanthera between plant densities of 20 and 25 thousand plants/ha. On the basis of harvests every 3 months, then the observed yield (10-12 tonnes fresh biomass/ha/harvest) in the associations with bananas is in the range of 40-50 tonnes fresh biomass/ha/year.

AB  - Runoff and soil erosion were measured in a two-phase experiment for seven consecutive years from 1979 through 1986 on a 44·3 watershed comprising 12 sub-watersheds of 2-4 ha each. These experiments were conducted at Ibadan, Nigeria, which is characterized by two growing seasons per year. The first season lasts from mid-March through mid-July, and the second season from mid-August to early November. Experiments were conducted in two phases comprising different treatments. The six treatments during Phase I (1979-1981), involving different combinations of land clearing and tillage methods, were: (1) manual clearing (MC) with plough-till (PT); (2) MC with no till (NT); (3) shear-blade (SB) clearing with NT; (4) tree-pusher (TP) clearing with PT; (5) TP clearing with NT; (6) traditional clearing and farming (TF). The five farming-system treatments during Phase II (1982-1987) were: (A) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala planted on the contour at 4 m intervals, (B) fallowing with mucuna (Mucuna utilis) on severely degraded soils; (C) fallowing with mucuna on moderately degraded soils; (D) ley farming on severely degraded soils; (E) ley farming on moderately degraded soils. The traditional farming treatment of Phase I was discontinued in 1982 at the beginning of Phase II and the land was returned to natural fallowing. Runoff, soil erosion, and nutrient losses in runoff were monitored using a 4·5 feet H-Flume, FW-1 waterstage recorder and Coshocton Wheel sampler. From the mean annual rainfall of 1320 mm, mean annual runoff amounts for the 3-year period from 1979 through 1981 during Phase I were 5·6 mm (0·42 per cent of rainfall) for MC-NT, 5·7 mm (0·43 per cent) for TF, 43·2 mm (3·27 per cent) for SB-NT, 43·5 mm (3·30 per cent) for MC-PT, 68·3 mm (5·17 per cent) for TP-NT, and 113·1 mm (8·57 per cent) for TP-PT treatments. Runoff losses were consistently more during the first compared with the second growing season. Trends in soil erosion were similar to those of runoff, and annual soil erosion amounts were 0·1 Mg ha-1 for MC-NT, 0·2 Mg ha-1 for TF, 1·5 Mg ha-1 for SB-NT, 3·6 Mg ha-1 for MC-PT, 5·1 Mg ha-1 for TP-NT, and 8·3 Mg ha-1 for TP-PT treatments. Measurements made during Phase II showed that there were no significant differences in runoff or soil erosion among the restorative farming systems adopted. Nutrient concentrations in runoff and nutrient loss were generally high in uncropped treatments, e.g. mucuna fallow during the fallowing phase and ley farming during the grazing phase.

AB  - The restorative ability of herbaceous (Psophocarpus palustris, Pueraria phaseoloides) and woody (Leucaena leucocephala, Senna siamea, Acacia leptocarpa, Acacia auriculiformis) legume species and of natural regrowth was studied on an eroded and compacted Oxic Paleustalf in southwestern Nigeria. Compared to the control treatment that was continuously cropped for 15 years, four years of following significantly improved test crop yields. However, fallowing with the above species did not substantially improve soil properties, particularly soil bulk density. A longer fallow period may be needed to amend soil physical conditions of this degraded Alfisol. Soil chemical properties were greatly improved following land clearing and plant biomass burning in 1993. However, the residual effect of burning on soil fertility was insignificant in the second cropping year. Among the fallow species, P. palustris and natural fallow showed the best residual effect on test crop performance. Despite the high biomass and nutrient yields of S. siamea and A. auriculiformis, test crop yields on these plots were low due to the border effects from the uncleared and fallowed subplots.

AB  - The high cost of conventional fossil fuels has resulted in a rise in the demand for charcoal in developing countries. There has been a problem of wood scarcity and indigenous tree species are being replaced with the fast-growing, short-rotation species. Three short-rotation tree species: Gliricidia sepium, Leucaenea leucocephala and Gmelina arborea were converted to charcoal by a pyrolytic process. The effects of final carbonisation temperature on the yield, heating value and proximate analysis of charcoal from the tree species were determined. Gliricidia sepium gave the highest charcoal yield of 51.6% with a gross heating value of 31.45 MJ/kg at 300°C final carbonisation temperature. There was no significant difference in the charcoal yield of Gmelina arborea and Leucaena leucocephala at 5% level of testing. The charcoal yield decreased with an increase in carbonisation temperature. The percentage volatiles in charcoal decreased with an increase in temperature, while there was an increase in the percentage fixed carbon.; The high cost of conventional fossil fuels has resulted in a rise in the demand for charcoal in developing countries. There has been a problem of wood scarcity and indigenous tree species are being replaced with the fast-growing, short-rotation species. Three short-rotation tree species: Gliricidia sepium, Leucaenea leucocephala and Gmelina arborea were converted to charcoal by a pyrolytic process. The effects of final carbonisation temperature on the yield, heating value and proximate analysis of charcoal from the tree species were determined Gliricidia sepium gave the highest charcoal yield of 51.6% with a gross hearing value of 31.45MJ/kg at 300°C final carbonisation temperature. There was no significant difference in the charcoal yield of Gmelina arborea and Leucaena leucocephala at 5% level of testing. The charcoal yield decreased with an increase in carbonisation temperature. The percentage volatiles in charcoal decreased with an increase in temperature, while there was an increase in the percentage fixed carbon.

AB  - To optimize biomass and crude protein (CP) production for leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) in southern Texas, field trials were conducted with treatment combinations of three levels of phosphorus (P), two levels of Mg and two levels of soluble trace element mixture (STEM). The P was banded in the soil while the Mg and micronutrient blend were applied to the foliage. A combination of P (22 kg ha-1), Mg and STEM fertilizers significantly increased biomass from 2555 kg ha-1 to 3028 kg ha-1. This treatment was associated with an increase in leaf CP from 27.9% to 31.0%. P fertilizer had no significant effect on leaf P, but significantly increased leaf nitrogen (N) and leaf copper (Cu). A foliar spray of Mg significantly increased leaf N, P, and Cu. A foliar spray of a complete micronutrient blend increased leaf Cu. Biomass production was correlated positively (decreasing order) with leaf Cu, N, and Mg and negatively with Zn. Leaf N was positively correlated with leaf P and calcium. The critical tissue concentrations (CTC) (where 90% of predicted maximum leaf protein was obtained) were 0.18% and 4.49 mg kg-1 for leaf P and Cu, respectively.

AB  - The competitiveness of wild-type strains of Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena) and their genetically marked double mutants was examined in mixed infection experiments in the greenhouse. Antibiotic resistance markers were selected for use in strain identification, but these genetic markers apparently lowered both competitiveness and effectiveness, except in the case of strain DS 144/2 where the genetically marked derivative was evidently superior to the wild-type parent strain in effectiveness. Four wild-type strains and their genetically marked derivatives were carefully evaluated using double reciprocal pairs, the results of which nevertheless allowed the formulation of some conclusions. Strains DS 65 and DS 78 were more competitive than strain DS 144/2; only strain DS 78 was more competitive than DS 158; and strains DS 158 and DS 65 were equally competitive. There was no correlation between nodule number and competitiveness. Shoot dry weight and nitrogen mass, as well as nitrogenase activity, decreased with some strain mixtures indicating that relatively ineffective symbioses had formed, as compared with single-strain inoculations using symbiotically competent strains.

AB  - Fifteen intact male Jamunapari goats, average BW 22.0 kg, were divided into three groups to investigate the effects of long-term consumption of leucaena on fasting heat production and thyroid hormones. Animals were offered rations containing leucaena leaves and twigs to provide about 0%, 40% and 50% CP in L1 (control), L2 and L3 groups, respectively, in Phase I (165 days). In the second phase (210 days) L1 and L3 were similar to the first phase whereas in L2 the proportion of leucaena was reduced to provide 25% CP. Basal roughage was Zea mays (maize), aerial part, in Phase I and Avena sativa (oat) hay in Phase II. Blood samples were collected at 100-day intervals. The mean value of triiodothyronine was 0.82 ng ml-1, 1.00 ng ml-1, 1.65 ng ml-1; 0.84 ng ml-1, 0.91 ng ml-1, 0.96 ng ml-1 and 0.76 ng ml-1, 0.66 ng ml-1 and 0.67 ng ml-1 in L1, L2 and L3 groups, respectively, on Day 135 (Stage I), Day 240 (Stage II) and Day 340 (Stage III) of feeding. Triiodothyronine was higher (P ≤ 0.01) for the L3 group in Stage I with no differences at later samplings. Thyroxine level was not affected in this study. Fasting heat production (FHP) was not affected by diet (269 ± 9 kJ per kg W0.75 day-1). It is concluded that feeding leucaena up to a level to provide 50% CP in the rations to Jamunapari goats had no effect on FHP and serum thyroxine level.

AB  - To identify possible sources of psyllid resistance and determine the effect of psyllid damage on biomass yield of various Leucaena spp. and hybrids in subtropical Florida, a 3-year trial was conducted at Brooksville, Florida. Leucaena spp. tested were L. leucocephala K8, K584, and K636, L pallida K376 and L. esculenta K948. Three F2 hybrids in the trial were L. pallida x L. diversifolia KX1, L. pallida x L. leucocephala KX2 and L. diversifolia x L. leucocephala KX3. Leucaena esculenta and L. pallida consistently displayed the lowest psyllid damage (P<0.01), with L. esculenta being essentially free from psyllids and damage. Leucaena leucocephala selections had the highest damage ratings (P<0.001) in 19 of 20 high psyllid-infestation events over the 3 years, while the F2 hybrids had intermediate levels of damage. Adult psyllid populations were positively correlated with plant damage (P<0.05) in 18 of 20 high psyllid-infestation periods, while nymph populations were positively correlated with damage (P<0.001) at all 20 observations. Psyllid damage was positively correlated with edible dry matter (DM) and total DM for only 2 of 11 harvests. The lack of correlation between psyllid damage and biomass yield suggests that psyllid-susceptible L. leucocephala selections can be grown in subtropical Florida.

AB  - Two trials were carried out over five growing seasons in western Tanzania to investigate (a) forage production and quality of eight lines of Leucaena leucocephala, one of L. diversifolia and one of L. esculenta and (b) the effect of cutting height (25, 50 and 75 cm) on forage production of nine lines of L. leucocephala and one of L. diversifolia. The locally naturalized lines, T1 and K1, were consistently better in yield, out-producing the commercial L. leucocephala cultivars Cunningham, Peru and K8 in three or four out of the five seasons' harvests. Mean daily dry matter yields for all lines decreased as the dry season progressed. Mean yields were 54.9, 28.6 and 12.8 kg/ha/day in the rainy season, late rainy season/early dry season and late dry season, respectively. The concentrations of N (2.3 to 3.1%), P (0.13 to 0.17%), K (0.7 to 1.3%), Ca (0.6 to 1.6%) and Mg (0.4 to 0.6%) in the edible forage declined as the dry season became pronounced but were at levels sufficient for animal production except for P levels, which were low. Three distinct yield groups emerged from responses to cutting height: cv. Cunningham produced the greatest yields of edible forage at 25 cm cutting height; cv. Peru, cv. K8, Korog, T1, CPI 90790 and CPI 58394 at 50 cm; and CPI 58398, CPI 84511 and CPI 85132 at 75 cm.

AB  - The effect of boiling and soaking in water on the mimosine and protein contents of young leaves, pods and seeds of the tropical leguminous tree Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) was investigated. It was observed that the soluble protein content in leucaena tissue was overestimated because of the presence of mimosine. A more accurate method of determining the soluble protein content in leucaena tissue containing mimosine was developed and used in this study. It was found that boiling removed mimosine from young leaves, pods and seeds of leucaena but it also reduced the amount of soluble protein significantly. Soaking in water for 24 h eliminated 97% of mimosine from young leaves, pods and split seeds of leucaena, and up to 20% of mimosine from the whole young seeds without significantly reducing the soluble protein content. © 1996 Blackwell Science Ltd.

AB  - An experiment was carried out in "Palmichal S.C." Experimental station, located in El Hornito, at Miranda county of Zulia state, characterized as Very Dry Tropical Forest, with 445 mm of precipitation and average annual temperature of 29°C in order to evaluate the effect of different levels of residual water on the growth of Leucaena leucocephala in nursery conditions. The levels of residual water evaluated were: 0% 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. The experimental design was completely at random with 20 replications. Results showed that height of plants, stalk diameter at the base and branches were affected (P<0.01) by evaluation periods, observing an increase of this variable, with the plant's development The various levels of residual waters, influenced the variables under study, finding an increase in the height of the plant with concentrations between and increment in height 75% 50% (26.28 cm) and 100% (27.11 cm) and numbers of branches with levels of 25% (42.80) and 50% (41.29), while stalk diameter at the base decreased significantly (P<0.05) with levels of 75% and 100%, with 4.64 and 4.95 mm, respectively.

PY  - 1997

AB  - Slow seedling growth is a limitation to the more widespread adoption of the tree legume, leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). Three glasshouse trials examined the role of arbuscular mycorrhiza and phosphorus (P) nutrition in determining early growth and nodulation of leucaena. Treatments included soil types, inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, P application, grass competition and fumigation with methyl bromide, an anti-fungal agent. Plant measurements included colonisation by AM fungi, nodule weight, tissue nitrogen (N) and P concentrations. Slower early growth of leucaena in a soil from Mt Cotton than in soils from Gayndah or Theodore was due to slow colonisation of roots by AM fungi. Sequential harvests of plants revealed that rate of colonisation in the Mt Cotton soil was only half that in the Theodore soil prior to 28 days after planting resulting in subcritical P concentrations 21 days after sowing and an approximate halving of top dry weight 41 days after sowing. However, following increased infection, tissue P concentration and final plant growth 98 days after sowing were similar in both soils. Early seedling growth in the Mt Cotton soil was increased by inoculating the soil with mulch containing AM fungi but not with soil collected from beneath established leucaena added at a lower rate. Phosphorus application significantly increased growth of leucaena seedlings, but only the highest rate of 1200 kg P/ha was able to prevent early P deficiency. Final growth was reduced by 50% in the presence of Panicum maximum as a result of increased competition for N and P and by 90% in fumigated soil as a result of P deficiency. The results of these experiments confirm the important role of AM fungi on early seedling growth of leucaena. However, the potential to increase early growth using a soil or mulch inoculum containing AM fungi or P fertiliser may be limited by the high rates of application needed. More work is needed to determine whether slow rate of infection is a significant limitation in soils other than the Mt Cotton soil in the field.

AB  - Foliage (leaves, small-diameter stems and flowers and fruits if present) was harvested in March 1994 from Acacia angustissima, Cajanus cajan, Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala and given as a supplement at four levels (0, 50, 100 and 150 g dry matter/day) to a diet of maize stover fed ad libitum to sheep. Sixteen sheep were used and divided into four groups of four, each with a mean weight of 18 kg. Each group was allocated at random to one of the legumes. Four 4 × 4 Latin square design experiments were carried out using 14-day periods and during the second week of each period feed intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance and microbial protein yield were measured. For each legume, other than C. calothyrsus, there was a significant increase (P < 0.05) in dry matter intake as the level of supplement increased. For all four legumes, there was a significant increase (P < 0.05) in digestibility of organic matter, nitrogen balance (NB) and microbial protein yield as the level of supplement increased. As judged by increases in intake of digestible organic matter and NB, A. angustissima gave the best response, followed by C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala which were similar and then C. cajan gave the poorest response. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - There is considerable interest in improving nitrogen fixation in tropical legume trees to increase soil fertility, particularly in developing countries. To provide information needed for the development of improved strains, characterization of strains of Leucaena-nodulating Rhizobium was performed. Thirteen strains were isolated from root nodules of Leucaena leucocephala grown in different geographical regions in Egypt. Plasmid DNA profile groups, including identification of symbiosis-controlling plasmids, were defined. Symbiotic competence was determined in plant tests and some strains were perhaps more symbiotically proficient at fixing nitrogen with L. leucocephala than were reference strains. The genetic diversity of these strains was determined by RFLP analysis of total DNAs using, as probes, six arbitrarily selected cosmid clones from a gene library of strain TAL 1145, a well-characterized reference strain. There were four plasmid profile groups which did not correlate with either symbiotic competence or RFLP analysis. RFLP analysis, unlike plasmid profiles, permitted a determination that all 13 Egyptian strains were evidently homogeneous and quite distinct from previously studied Leucaena-nodulating Rhizobium as represented by reference strains.

AB  - The minimum amounts of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) required to improve the performance of cattle on a straw diet has been studied. Four levels of leucaena, namely 0 (0%), 2 kg (10%), 4 kg (18%) and 6 kg (27% of dietary dry matter intake) were supplied to 4 adult indigenous bulls (355 ± 21.5 kg weight) fed rice straw alone, in a 4×4 latin square design. Measurements were made on intake, digestibility, N balance and microbial N yield. Up to 10% level of leucaena supplementation, there were no significant improvement on intake, digestibility, microbial N yeild and N balance. Both straw and total dry matter intake showed diminishing return to increasing levels of leucaena supplementation and the maximum intake was observed at around 20% level. However, dietary N and digestible organic matter intake, the microbial N yield and the N balance increased linearly to the increasing levels of leucaena supplementation. On a rice straw based diet, the minimum level of leucaena required to improve the animal performance would probably be at around 20% of the dietary intake.

AB  - A greenhouse experiment was conducted to assess the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi inoculum potential for Leucaena leucocephala in a range of nutrient-depleted farm soils in western Kenya. Leucaena was grown in 12 uninoculated farm soils with pH 5.0-6.7, with or without rock P and farmyard manure. Root infection, nodulation, and shoot and root weight were determined 25, 46, and 69 days after planting. Spore concentrations in the farm soils at the start of the experiment ranged from 44 to 126 live spores per 100 g dry soil with 6-10 species per soil, principally Scutellospora spp. and Acaulospora spp. Nodulation was absent or poor in all soils, indicating the need for rhizobial inoculation of species belonging to the leucaena crossinoculation group in this agrosystem. Rock-P alone increased final shoot dry weight by a factor of 1.4, manure alone by 1.8, and rock-P plus manure by 1.9, compared with no ameliorant. Root infection with AM fungi was detected in all soils 25 days after planting and increased linearly in the different farm soils to values of 33-65% 69 days after planting. Soil pH and root infection 25 days after planting accounted for much of the variation in final shoot weight among soils with no amelioront (87%). As early root infection increased from 20 to 40% at soil pH 5.0, the predicted final shoot dry weight was doubled, and the response to ameliorants was reduced by two- thirds. The growth responses to increased infection became smaller as pH increased from 5.0 to 6.5.

AB  - Time of pruning application and mixing primings of varying qualities could be important management options to increase the rate of nitrogen recovery from multipurpose-tree prunings that are used as a source of nitrogen to crops. A field experiment was conducted in the semiarid zone of Zimbabwe to test this hypothesis, using prunings of calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), alone and in mixtures, and maize (Zea mays) as the test crop. Time of pruning application significantly improved N uptake, N recovery, and grain yield of maize. Applying prunings of calliandra at maize planting was significantly better in terms of N uptake, N recovery, and grain yield than applying them four weeks after planting. However, with Ieucaena, time of prunings application had no significant effects on N recovery. Mixing prunings of leucaena and calliandra had no effect on maize N uptake, N recovery, and grain yield. Split application of available prunings during the crop growth cycle had no effect on N recovery compared to one-time application of entire amounts of prunings at planting. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

The seeds of most of the species collected from the polluted areas also showed significant reduction in germination as compared to the seeds of the control area, except Cassia surattensis and Tecoma stans. These two species showed a comparatively higher rate of germination in the polluted seeds. In this germination study the species were found to be resistant in the following order: C. surattensis, T. stans, A. lebbeck, P. pinnata, P. pterocarpum, S. sesban, A. indica, L. leucocephala, P. aculeata, and D. sissoo.

AB  - In order to determine how dependent a woody legume can be upon potential N sources, the time course of N2 fixation and N absorption was studied on Gliricidia sepium cv. ILG50, Leucaena leucocephala cv. K28, and Albizia lebbeck in a screenhouse for 16 months using Senna siamea as a reference tree. Dry matter and N yield in all four species increased steadily with time. The numbers and dry weight of nodules also increased with tree age. N-difference and 15N dilution methods correlated well (r = 0.87–0.93) in defining an increasing pattern of N2 fixation with time in all species, with the highest increment rate between sowing and 8 months. The percent N2 fixed ranged from 17.9 to 74%, 27.7 to 71.9% and 43.6 to 83.6%, equivalent to 191 to 3385 mg, 321 to 2863 mg and 533 to 6419 mg N in Leucaena, Gliricidia and Albizia, respectively, for the period between 4 and 16 months. In contrast to others, G. sepium had its peak of amount of N2 fixed at 12 months after planting. In both the proportion and amount of N2 fixed over time, A. lebbeck was superior to L. leucocephala and G. sepium which were similar. The proportion of plant N derived from absorption (soil+fertilizer) over time decreased inversely to the increase in symbiotic N2 fixation, with soil being the predominant source. This study evidenced the benefit of relying on N2-fixing woody legumes as sustainable N-supplying sources to soil-crop systems. © 1996 A B Academic Publishers.

AB  - Temporal changes in soil chemical and nutritional properties were evaluated in a long-term experiment conducted on Alfisols in West Africa. Effects of land use and cropping duration on soil chemical properties at 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths were evaluated for five treatments: (1) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala established on the contour at 4-m intervals; (2) mucuna (Mucuna utilis) fallowing for 1 year followed by maize (Zea mays)-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cultivation for 2 years on severely degraded land; (3) fallowing with mucuna on moderately degraded soils; (4) ley farming involving growing improved pastures for 1 year, grazing for the second year, and growing maize-cowpea for the third year on severely degraded land; (5) ley farming on moderately degraded soils. Soil chemical properties were measured once every year from 1982 through 1986 during the dry season, and included pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TSN), Bray-P, exchangeable cations, and effective cation exchange capacity (CEC). Regardless of the cropping system treatments, soil chemical quality decreased with cultivation time. The rate of decrease at 0-5 cm depth was 0·23 units year-1 for pH, 0·05 per cent year-1 for SOC, 0·012 per cent year-1 for TSN, 0·49 cmol kg-1 year-1 for Ca2+, 0·03 cmol kg-1 year-1 for Mg2+, 0·018 cmol kg-1 year-1 for K+, and 0·48 cmol kg-1 year-1 for CEC. Although there was also a general decrease in soil chemical quality at 5-10 cm depth, the trends were not clearly defined. In contrast to the decrease in soil properties given above, there was an increase in concentration at 0-5 cm depth of total acidity with cultivation time at the rate of 0·62 cmol kg-1 year-1, and of Mn3+ concentration at the rate of 0·081 cmol kg-1 year-1. Continuous cropping also increased the concentration of Bray-P at 0-5 cm depth due to application of phosphatic fertilizer. Trends in soil chemical properties were not clearly defined with regards to cropping system treatments. In general, however, soil chemical properties were relatively favorable in ley farming and mucuna fallowing treatments imposed on moderately degraded soils. Results are discussed in terms of recommended rates of fertilizer use, in view of soil test values, expected yields, and critical limits of soil properties.

AB  - The impact of dry spells on the developmental stages of the coconut fruit from inflorescence initiation up to fruit maturity and its relation to nut production was studied. The rainfall pattern from 1976 to 1980 was superimposed on the ontogeny of the coconut fruit beginning from the time of initiation of the inflorescence primordium up to maturity of the nut. Based on the total annual rainfall and the monthly precipitation, the degree and duration of dry spells corresponding to each stage of nut developwent were deduced. A critical analysis of the rainfall data in relation to the stages of fruit development revealed that a prolonged dry spell at three stages viz. initiation of primordium, ovary development ran button size nuts could adversely affect the productivity of palms, while other stages are comparatively less affected by water stress.

AB  - The effects of forage supplement and level of maize grain (Zea mays L.) offered on intake, digestibility, N balance, and rate of gain were determined for rams fed teff straw (Eragrostis abyssinica). Supplements (leaves from five trees, Faidherbia albida, Carissa edulis, Dichrostachys cinerea, Leucaena leucocephala, and Sesbania sesban, or chopped alfalfa hay, Medicago sativa) provided 40 g per day of crude protein. Maize grain was supplemented to half of the sheep at 100 g per day. Rams fed leaves of F. albida, L. leucocephala, S. sesban, and the alfalfa hay gained 49 g per day with maize and 23 g per day without maize. Higher content of proanthocyanidins and related polyphenols in F. albida had no detrimental effect on N balance and rate of gain (P < 0.05) in comparison to alfalfa. The high content of proanthocyanidins and related polyphenols in C. edulis and D. cinerea resulted in low intake, digestibility, and rate of gain (6 g day-1) when fed with maize, and high weight loss (-63 g day-1) without maize.

AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.) and Leucaena leucocephala (a tropical tree) were subjected to different degrees of soil drying and changes in their root and xylem ABA concentrations were measured simultaneously. Additional treatments such as defoliation, light sheltering and stem girdling were applied so that phloem transport into roots was manipulated. When soil was dried, ABA concentration in xylem sap increased almost linearly with that of roots in both species. Such an increase was relatively plateaued at high root ABA concentrations, suggesting that severe soil drying might have hindered some parts of roots from delivering ABA into xylem flow. When 3H-ABA was loaded into roots and monitored for its disappearance, it was found that the capability of roots to catabolize ABA was much lower than that reported for leaves, with a half-life of 1.15 h and a considerable amount (46%) of fed 3H-ABA was remained unmodified during 21 h of incubation. Previous soil drying significantly reduced such a capability of catabolism and extended the half-life of fed 3H-ABA to 2.27 h, and the amount remaining unmodified was elevated to 50.7%. Defoliation and light-sheltering treatments significantly reduced xylem ABA concentration of waterstressed plants. Using stem girdling approach, it was estimated that about 25 to 30% of ABA in the xylem sap might come from shoot through phloem under soil drying condition. It was concluded that in addition to an enhanced ABA biosynthesis in roots during soil drying, a slowed ABA catabolism in roots and an increased import from shoots were also important contributions to the sensitive changes of xylem ABA concentration in response to such a stress.

AB  - As an alternate vegetable protein source, roasted (110 C, 15 m) seeds of L. leucocephala were incorporated in the growing rabbits ration at 0, 10, 20 or 30% level. 8 weaner rabbits, housed individually, were fed on each diet for 8 weeks and then slaughtered. Average daily liveweight gains of 11.30, 11.50, 6.50 and -0.50±0.07g were recorded for rabbits on the 4 diets, respectively. Growth rate, feed consumption, carcass yield, yield of primal cuts were all adversely affected by inclusion of RLS at 20 or 30% level, while rabbits on 10% level behaved as well as those on control ration. It is concluded that roasted leucaena seeds can be included in rabbit diets upto 10% level without any deleterious effect. © GSP, India.

AB  - Leaves of nine agroforestry tree species (Grevillea robusta, Erythrina abyssinica, Gliricidia sepium, Albizia schimperiana, Acacia nilotica, Acacia polyacantha, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena pallida and Entada abyssinica) were compared in a glasshouse incubation experiment under natural temperature conditions to relate the observed nitrogen mineralization pattern to quality factors of the mulch material such as N, lignin, phenolic and tannin content and C/N ratio, lignin/N ratio, phenolic/N ratio and (lignin + phenolics)/N ratio. Separation of the plant material into leaflets and petioles/rachis or into leaves and petioles with subsequent chemical analyses revealed large differences in the quality of the material not only between species but also amongst plant parts within the same species. Erythrina abyssinica, G. sepium, L. leucocephala and L. pallida had a rapid nitrogen release especially during the early sampling dates and were superior compared with mulch treatments of G. robusta, A. polyacantha, and Entada abyssinica. Immobilization processes started around 5 weeks after incubation and continued up to the end of the experiment, 9 weeks after incubation. N and lignin content, C/N ratio, lignin/N ratio, phenolics/N ratio and (phenolics + lignin)/N ratio were all significantly correlated with mineralized nitrogen after 3 weeks but their influence in driving the mineralization pattern decreased with incubation time.

AB  - A mutational and structural analysis of Rhizobium loti nodulation genes in strains NZP2037 and NZP2213 was carried out. Unlike the case with other Rhizobium strains examined to date, nodB was found on an operon separate from nodACIJ. Sequence analysis of the nodACIJ and nodB operon regions confirm that R. loti common nod genes have a gene organization different from that of other Rhizobium spp. At least 4 copies of nodD-like sequences were identified in R. loti. The complete nucleotide sequence of one of these, nodD3, was determined. A new host-specific nod gene, nolL, was identified adjacent to nodD3, NolL shares homology with NodX and other O-acetyl transferases. Mutational analysis of the nod regions of strains NZP2037 and NZP2213 showed that nodD3, nodI, nodJ, and nolL were all essential for R. loti strains to effectively nodulate the extended host Lotus pedunculatus, but were not necessary for effective nodulation of the less restrictive host, Lotus corniculatus. Both nodD3 and nolL were essential for R. loti strains to nodulate Leucaena leucocephala.

AB  - The impact of grazing on plant composition and dominance of natural grassland, as well as plant population of established silvipasture, were studied at Jhansi from October 1991 to June 1994. There was no harmful effect on the plant composition and dominance of the perennial grasses in natural grassland due to round the year grazing. Similarly, plant population of Chrysopogon fulvus was also not affected due to round the year grazing by sheep and goats under silvipastoral system. However, legume components drastically decreased under natural grassland, as well as in silvipastoral system. Out of three tree species, Leucaena leucocephala survived minimum (11.5%), followed by Dichrostachys cinerea (64.0%) under grazing conditions. Thus, it can be concluded that the legume components are affected severely by grazing in both the types of pasture even with optimum stocking rate of animals. In tree species, L. leucocephala was also affected adversely, while perennial grasses did not show any harmful effect of grazing.

AB  - The dry matter (DM) disappearance and ruminal solubility of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P),                 magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K) in eight Philippine forages were studied. The forages were: paragrass                 (Brachiaria mutica (Forsk.) Stapf), stargrass (Cynodon plectostachyum Pilger), napiergrass (Pennisetum                 purpureum Schumach), calopo (Calopogonium muconoides Desv.), centrocema (Centrocema pubescens Benth.),                 gliricidia (Gliricidia septum (Jacq.) Walp.), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit), and                 sesbania (Sesbania grandiflora (L.) Poir. Nylon bags with samples were incubated for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48                 and 72 h in rumen cannulated sheep. The 0-h bags were washed with deionized water. For the 0-h samples,                 20.4, 17.2, 50.7, 52.2 and 80.1% of the DM, Ca, P, Mg, and K was solubilized, respectively. At 3-h                 incubation period, DM disappearance was 10 percentage units higher than that of 0-h incubation whereas                 mineral disappearance increased by 43, 21, 30 and 13% for Ca, P, Mg, and K, respectively. At 72-h                 incubation period, greater proportion of DM, Ca, especially in P, Mg, and K was solubilized with a value                 of 73.8, 71.5, 85.6, 91.4 and 98.2%, respectively. The average particulate passage rate obtained in the                 present study was 1.9%h where as the range of disappearance rates of various mineral elements were: 0.4                 to 1.2%/h for Ca, 0.1 to 1.6%/h for P, 0.7 to 2%/h for Mg, and 0.1 to 2%/h for K. The effective ruminal                 solubilization (ERS) of the macrominerals was calculated where particulate passage rate and                 disappearance rate of the various elements were included in the equation. The ERS of Ca, P Mg and K was                 50.0, 72.6, 83.9 and 94.5%, respectively. Species differences (p < 0.05) on the various mineral                 solubilities were also observed. This study shows that ruminal solubility of macrominerals in selected                 Philippine forages is K > Mg > P > Ca.

AB  - The amounts of thioproline, an effective nitrite-trapping agent in the human body, in various edible leguminous seeds have been determined. Thioproline in uncooked Parkia speciosa, the most popular seeds eaten in the south of Thailand, was undetectable but increased markedly to 0.14 ± 0.02 mmol/100 g after boiling. The formation of thioproline was effectively inhibited by the addition of N-ethylmaleimide, a thiol-trapping agent. The uncooked Parkia speciosa seeds contained substantial amounts of formaldehyde and thiol compounds and the amounts decreased after boiling. The contents of thioproline in other uncooked edible leguminous seeds, Parkia javanica and Archidendron clypearia, were 0.006 ± 0.002 and 0.31 ± 0.11 mmol/100 g, respectively and increased to 0.54 ± 0.2 and 2.95 ± 0.8 mmol/100 g after boiling. Archidendron jirringa and Leucaena leucocephala, both uncooked and boiled, showed no detectable amount of thioproline.

TI  - Palatability of multipurpose tree species: Effect of species and length of study on intake and relative palatability by sheep

AB  - The potential forage value and appropriate length of study on intake and relative palatability ranking of 40 multipurpose tree species (MPTs) were determined using 24 sheep blocked on live weight and age. As the MPTs had different dry matter contents, intakes were also expressed as a ratio of quantity offered (A(i)/D(i)). Using daily Eragrostis tef straw offer (TD) and intake (T), relative palatability indices were calculated as R(i) = (A(i)/D(i))/(T(i)/TD(i)). There was a significant (P < 0.0001) decrease in correlation of intake measured in day 1 and subsequent days (r = 0.88, 0.81 and 0.79 for days 2-4, days 5-8 and days 9-12, respectively). A similar trend was observed on corresponding palatability indices. Individual animal preference and blocking did not affect intake and palatability indices significantly (P > 0.05), however significant (P < 0.0001) tree species differences were observed. Results on linear regression, correlation coefficients, palatability ranking and standard errors of means (adjusted palatability indices) indicate that, if palatability is done to predict long- term intake of MPTs, at least 5 days are appropriate in palatability assessment for sheep. Using mean palatability index (days 2-12), the MPTs were grouped into four clusters. The MPTs such as Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania sesban which are known to have good nutritive value had high palatability. In the same classification group, there were less known species such as Acacia venosa, A. persiciflora, A. melanoxylon, A. hockii, A. polyacantha, Tamarindus indica, Chamaecytisus palmensis, Tipuana tipu, Indigofera arrecta and Atriplex nummularia. Flemingia macrophylla, Erythrina abyssinica, Acacia salicina, Acacia coriacea, Albizia schimperiana, Ceratonia siliqua, Casuarina glauca and Erythrina burana had poor palatability. These species seem to have little forage value for animals with short-term adaptation periods. Gliricida sepium and Calliandra calothyrsus although currently being used by farmers had a medium palatability ranking.

AB  - The ruminal solubility of copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), and zinc (Zn) in eight Philippine forages was studied. These forages were: 1) grasses: paragrass (Brachiaria mutica (Forsk.) Stapf), stargrass (Cynodon plectostachyum Pilger), and napiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.); 2) creeping legumes: calopogonium or calopo (Calopogonium muconoides Desv.) and centrocema (Centrocema pubescens Benth.); 3) tree lequmes: gliricidia or kakawate (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp.), leucaena or ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit), and sesbania or katuray (Sesbania grandiflora (L.) Poir). Nylon bags with samples were incubated for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72h in three rumen cannulated sheep fed with timothy hay (Phleum pratense L.) at 2% body weight/d. The 0-h bags were washed with deionized water. There were species differences (p < 0.05) on the different solubilities of trace elements. At 0-h incubation, the trend of solubility was Mo (54%) > Zn (43%) > Cu (38.7%) > Mn (29.5%). At 3 -h incubation, all the elements except Mn had an average solubility above 50%. Combining particulate passage rate (1.9%/h) and various trace elements disappearance rates, the effective ruminai solubilization (ERS) of trace elements were computed. The ERS across species ranged from 44.6 to 89.9% for Cu, 29.9 to 84% for Mn, 66 to 95.1% for Mo, and 30.1 to 82.3% for Zn resulting to a trend of Mo > Zn > Cu > Mn.

AB  - An alley cropping experiment was conducted from 1986 to 1992 near Cotonou, Benin Republic on a field previously used as four-year bush-fallow. A no-tree control was compared with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. grown in 4 m distant hedgerows. In the same experiment, application of 90-39-75 kg ha-1 NPK fertiliser vs. no fertiliser and maize-cassava intercropping vs. rotation of sole crops was also tested. Topsoil samples (0-30 cm) were taken initially and again after four and six years. Alley cropping enhanced nitrogen recycling relative to the no-alley control by 253 kg ha-1 yr-1 for Leucaena and 131 kg ha-1 yr-1 for Cajanus in the overall average but a maximum of 22 kg N ha-1 yr-1 was recovered in total crop exports. Apparent fertiliser-N recovery increased from a low average of 14% in the first year to 66% in the second year up to a maximum of 109% in the no-tree control in the last year. Soil nutrient depletion during the six years was significant for all nutrients except P, K falling from 0.5 to 0.1 cmolc kg-1 soil and N from 0.08 to 0.05%. Hedgerow accumulation of N in the topsoil-plant system calculated as difference to a no-tree control was only 18 to 37 kg ha-1 yr-1 during the first four years after clearing, increasing to 208 kg in Leucaena and 111 kg ha-1 yr-1 in Cajanus without NPK during the last two years. During the first four years, average N, K, Ca and Mg losses from the topsoil-plant system of 223 kg, 160 kg, 176 kg and 80 kg ha-1 yr-1 were high but probably stored in the subsoil because corresponding leaching losses were only 10, 1, 15 and 6 kg ha-1 yr-1 at 150 cm depth during the second to fourth cropping year. Beyond the fourth year, markedly reduced nutrient losses from the topsoil and stable food crop yields in no-tree plots suggest that continuous maize-cassava cropping using balanced rates of mineral fertiliser is producing sustainable yields with almost closed nutrient cycles of the soil-plant system on our site. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

TI  - Effect of shade on the growth and mineral nutrition of a C4 perennial grass under field conditions
PY  - 1997
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030613316&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1004296622463&partnerID=40&md5=60a36afc22cc50f14e46c31188e4c86a
AB  - The effect of shading by a shrub legume on the growth and nutrient uptake of a C4 tropical grass was studied during four regrowth cycles. Regrowth periods were characterised by contrasting soil water availability. Dichanthium aristatum (Poir.) C. E. Hubbard swards were grown in full sun and under Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit with a light transmission level ranging from 80 to 30% of the incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), depending on shrub regrowth. A treatment with high N and water supply was included in one of the cycles to quantify the effect of shade alone on potential growth. Aboveground biomass (DM) and leaf area index (LAI) of swards were not depressed by the reduction of incoming PAR. The reduction in transmitted PAR by shrubs was compensated by an increase in the radiation use efficiency (RUE) of shaded swards. Higher RUE of unfertilised, shaded stands may be explained by higher levels of N availability in the soil. This is supported by the analysis of curves relating sward N accumulation to sward DM accumulation. In fact, for similar measured biomass the accumulated N was higher in shaded stands, a consequence of their higher N concentrations. This allowed shaded leaves to improve their CO2 assimilation rates on a leaf area basis. Higher RUE reported on shaded stands may be the consequence of higher leaf CO2 assimilation rates and also possible changes in the shoot:root ratio. As with N, the amount of K taken up by the sward was higher under shade, whereas P data were higher under shade only during the driest cycle. A positive water balance, alone or in combination with high N fertilisation, eliminated the improvement of the N nutrition of shaded stands. Thus, the positive effects of shade may be only observed when N and water are limiting sward growth in the open.

AB  - Six-week-old wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum) grown in pots with an alfisol soil with vertic properties and mulched at a rate equivalent to 10 t ha-1 with leaf prunings of Grevillea robusta, Erythrina abyssinica, Gliricidia sepium, Albizia schimperiana, Acacia nilotica, Acacia polyacantha, Leucaena leucocephala, leucaena pallida and Entada abyssinica were used to diagnose nutrient contributions by these tree species. A control treatment of 20 kg P + 30kg N ha-1 was chosen as the reference treatment for the vector analysis applied to the mulch effects. Nitrogen was found to be the most important nutrient in seedlings mulched in L. pallida, L. leucocephala, Erythrina abyssinica and to a lesser extent A. schimperiana. Other nutrients of these mulches were also in the deficiency zone but with shorter vectors and therefore with lower impact. Since all these mulches showed increased values for shoot dry weight, nutrient concentration and nutrient uptake they have still reserves for further plant growth and appear therefore to be good mulch sources for annual crops. In contrast, wheat seedlings treated with A. polyacantha and Entada abyssinica had at least some vectors in the toxic zone due to an excess of nutrients while Grevillea treated plants showed a typical toxicity response with large vectors for all nutrients in between the toxic and the antagonistic zone. Allelopathic compounds might also have been involved.

AB  - Introduction of a cosmid library of megaplasmid DNA of Rhizobium sp. BR816, a broad host range Rhizobium strain, into R. etli CE3, a narrow host range bean symbiont, resulted in the isolation of a transconjugant that could effectively nodulate Leucaena leucocephala. Analysis of the corresponding cosmid, pBRF2, revealed the presence of genes required for eliciting nitrogen-fixing nodules on L. leucocephala. Subcloning and Tn5 tagging identified a locus responsible for the host range extension. Sequence analysis of this locus revealed an ORF that shows significant identity with NodO of A. leguminosarum bv. viciae.

AB  - An experiment was conducted on a commercial farm located in the western part of Venezuela (10.5°N and 72°W; mean annual rainfall of 1000 mm; mean annual temperature of 28°C; sandy-loam Alfisol with pH of 5.5). The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), crude protein (CP) content and mineral composition of four Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit accessions under rotational grazing by heifers over a 6-month period covering dry and rainy seasons, using a split-plot experimental design with two replications. Neither accessions nor the accession x season interaction affected (P>0.05) any of the variables. The mean IVOMD was 68.6%, whereas CP content during the rainy season (26.5%) was higher (P<0.05) than in the dry season (24.3%). Average mineral content of the accessions were adequate in relation to grazing ruminant requirements with the exception of phosphorus [(P) 0.13%], sodium [(Na) 0.038%], copper [(Cu) 6.9 ppm], and zinc [(Zn) 19.7 ppm]. Forage P concentration may have been influenced by the low soil P content of the experimental site. The mean forage Ca:P ratio (11.3:1) was considerably wider than desirable. During the dry season, ash content increased (P<0.05), Na, iron (Fe), and cobalt (Co) decreased (P<0.05), but Fe and Co still remained above the critical levels. Mean concentrations of other elements were not affected (P>0.05) by season. Forage molybdenum (Mo) concentrations were low and, therefore, would not result in conditioned Cu deficiency. The four L. leucocephala accessions had similar feeding value for grazing ruminants and their quality was not markedly reduced in the dry season. Mineral supplementation of ruminants grazing this legume may be needed to correct specific deficiencies and imbalances.

AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate in growth chambers the behaviour of tropical forage legumes under chilling-stress conditions. A hypothesis was made by which low temperatures (15/10°C day/night) applied just before a cold stress (15/2°C) period would influence the development of plant cold-hardening. Leucaena pulverulenta Sel 22, L. leucocephala cv. Perú and cv. Cunningham were studied. During seven days, plants were either submitted to a 15/10°C day/ night regime, or maintained under 30/20°C, as a control. To promote plant growth and recovery after the stress, a 30/20°C regime was used. The dry matter daily growth rate was determined. Sel 22 and cv. Cunningham showed more cold tolerance than cv. Perú. Legume recovery after stress was greater under the cold-hardening induction condition. The greatest sensibility was shown when plants suffered stress during active growth. Cv. Cunningham and Sel 22 exhibited more cold-hardening than cv. Perú.

AB  - To decrease adverse environmental impacts of fertilizer N and to decrease input costs in agroecosystems, there is a renewed interest in using green manure to maintain soil fertility. Nitrogen mineralization from the leaves of two leguminous /Leucaena leucocephala (Lamb.) de Witt, and Acacia nilotica (Linn.) Willd. ex Del] and two nonleguminous (Azadirachta indica A. Jussieu and Melia azedarach L.) tree species was compared in a sandy loam soil (Typic Camborthids) at constant temperature (35°C) and moisture (-0.03 MPa). The cumulative amounts of mineralized N from the leaves of four tree species increased with increasing incubation periods; however, the magnitude ofN mineralization decreased with an increase in the incubation period and the amount of tree leaves applied to the soil. Mineralization patterns of all four species were almost identical, but the mineralization rate differed markedly among leaf materials. At 100 mg of leaf material added per gram of soil, the amount of net mineralized N was of the order L. leucocephala (323 mg kg-1 soil) > M. azedarach (315 mg kg-1 soil) > A. indica (269 mg kg-1 soil) > A. nilotica (70 mg kg-1 soil). The nitrogen mineralization potentials (No) differed markedly among the four tree species. It ranged from 71 (A. nilotica) to 284 mg per kilogram of soil (L. Leucocephala) at 25 mg of leaf material added per gram of soil, and from 82 to 332 mg per kilogram of soil at 100 mg of leaf material added per gram of soil for the same corresponding tree species. Irrespective of added leaf material concentrations, the mineralization potential (No) of the leaves was also of the order L. Leucocephala > M. azedarach > A. indica > A. nilotica. The N mineralization rate constants (k) did not differ significantly among L. leucocephala, M. azedarach, and A. indica except between L. leucocephala and M. azedarach or A. indica at 25 mg of leaf material per grams of soil amendment but were significantly higher than those of A. nilotica at all concentrations of added leaf material. In this study the N content and C/N ratio were found to best describe N mineralization from both leguminous and nonleguminous tree species. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A series of four digestibility trials, each with four local adult castrated sheep and goats, conducted in Burkina Faso, confirmed the superiority of goats in using the low quality roughage chopped sorghum stover. Goats ingested less DM, but through selection and better digestion they absorbed more OM than sheep. A diet with 30% Combretum aculeatum was as digestible as one with supplementation from agro-industrial by-products but the first allowed the absorption of more OM, especially by goats. The ration with 30% Leucaena leucocephala was not as digestible and the diet with 10% Leucaena leucocephala did not provide maintenance requirements. Refusal of chopped Sorghum bicolor stovers decreased if it was supplemented with 30% dried tree leaves, which are more available to farmers than agro-industrial by-products. Utilization of browse species in ruminant nutrition will contribute to the durability of the mixed agricultural production system through more intensive recycling of cereal crop residues. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Two village surveys were carried out in six villages in southwestern Nigeria to assess goat feeding under traditional management ranging from free roaming to permanent confinement. Three of the villages are located in the lowland rainforest zone (FZ) and three in transition between FZ and the derived savannah (TZ). Cassava products (tuber and peel) and maize offal (a by-product from local maize processing) were the most frequently used feeds. In FZ, breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) was also important. There were more feeds in FZ than in TZ. DM digestibilities of the most frequently used feeds were: cassava: 89 ± 2 (% ± SE); breadfruit: 88 ± 2 and maize offal: 75 ± 1. Of these feeds only maize offal had a high CP content (19%). Under free roaming, considerable amounts of feed were given (29-49 g kg-0.75 day-1); however, CP content was low (7-10%). The animals may have balanced their diet through scavenging and browsing. Larger amounts were offered to permanently confined stock (70 g kg-0.75 day-1), but CP content was low (10%); this may have limited weight gain. Some feeds frequently reported to be fed did not contribute much quantitatively. This shows that care must be taken when quantitatively interpreting the results of a qualitative survey. It is concluded that Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala could replace maize offal and/or increase the total amount of feed offered per animal. Suitability appeared to depend on the labour needed to harvest and feed browse, cost of maize offal and value of the extra production. Within the socio-economic setting at the time of the survey, feeding small amounts of browse to balance protein-deficient diets seemed the most attractive option. Feeding larger amounts of browse or using browse to replace maize offal seems to be feasible only if harvesting and feeding can be combined with other on-farm activities.

AB  - The effect of different condensed tannins concentrations on protein metabolism from browse supplements was investigated in a 90-day trial using sixty-six male Ethiopian Menz sheep. Teff straw (Eragrostis tef) was fed ad libitum (control diet), or supplemented with 190 g dried leaves of six Sesbania sesban accessions with increasing levels of condensed tannin (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6), lablab (Dolichos lablab), tagasaste (Chamaecytisus palmensis), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and goetzei (Sesbania goetzei) in a completely randomized block design. The condensed tannins were highest in goetzei; S6, S5 and leucaena, intermediate in S4, S3, S2 and S1, and lowest in tagasaste and lablab. The supplemented animals had significantly (P < 0.05) higher total dry matter and nitrogen (N) intake than the ones fed teff straw alone. The digestibility of N was lower for the control diet than for any other treatment (P < 0.05). S1 and S2 supplemented diets had significantly higher (P < 0.05) N digestibilities than all other diets. Faecal N, urinary N and urinary N per kg N excreted were significantly different (P < 0.0001) between diets. With increasing tannin levels (among Sesbania accessions) there was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in urinary N (S1 > S2 > S3 >S4 > S5), and an increase (P < 0.05) in faecal N (S1 < S2 < S3 < S4 < S5). Supplementation increased faecal N output significantly (P < 0.0001) as well as the N retention. Among the forage supplements, N retention was significantly (P < 0.0001) lower in lablab-, tagasaste-, leucaena-, S4- and goetzei-supplemented diets, than for S1, S2, S5 and S6. Apparent nitrogen digestibility was positively correlated (P < 0.001) with the supplement dry matter and crude protein (CP) degradation after 24 h (r = 0.93 and r = 0.85, respectively), the CP content (r = 0.87), and was negatively correlated with acid detergent fibre and neutral detergent fibre (r = -0.87 and -0.87, respectively). The CP degradability characteristics of the forages differed (P < 0.001) in water solubility (93-470 g kg-1 CP), rate of degradation (2.58-9.73 %/h), lag phase (-1.36-13.37 h), and estimated escape protein (262-619 g kg-1 CP). With increasing tannin levels (among Sesbania accessions), there was a significant decrease (P < 0.0001) in the rate of degradation (S1 > S2 > S3 > S4 > S5), and an increase in the estimated escape protein. The estimated rumen degradable protein (supplements) varied from 482 to 744 g kg-1 CP, while intestine digestible protein and the undegradable protein varied from 140 to 314 g kg-1 CP, hence the browses can supply adequate levels of rumen degradable and bypass protein.

AB  - This paper outlines a successful approach that was followed to evaluate grass and legume accessions for revegetation of low fertility and saline coal mine spoils. At the first stage, using seed collection records (passport data) of the Australian Tropical Forages Genetic Resource Centre, a range of grasses and legumes adapted to low rainfall, clay soils and saline areas were selected. At the second stage, legume seed was germinated in NaCl solutions of 0 to 0.2M and salinity tolerance was assessed based on germination percentage and seedling vigour. At the third stage, germination of legumes was assessed in pots filled with mine top-soil and spoils to be revegetated. Grasses were not included in stages 2 and 3 as adequate passport data was available to select a range of accessions for the 4th stage. The fourth stage of evaluation comprised field trials of 10 grass and 10 legume accessions, on two top-soils and two spoils. A stoloniferous form of Urochloa mosambicensis was the most promising grass providing up to 20% of ground cover 12 months after establishment. Legumes surviving at the end of the first season were Desmanthus subulatus, D. virgatus and Neptunia dimorphantha on top-soil and Clitoria ternatea, Leucaena leucocephala, and Rhynchosia sublobata on the spoil. Depending on long term survival, grass and legume accessions will be released as cultivars for minesite revegetation purposes.

AB  - . Imperata is shade-intolerant, although little is known of the relative roles of competition for light, water and nutrients in suppressing its growth. Shading of Imperata results in reduced carbohydrate storage, reduced rhizome and tuber-bulb production, reduced shoot dry weight, increased susceptibility to competition, increased susceptibility to herbicides and decreased vigor/regeneration. Herbaceous cover crops in the genera Calapogonium, Crotoleria, Mucuna and Pueraria have been shown to effectively suppress Imperata growth and can be used to prevent and in some cases eradicate Imperata. Tree fallows with fast-growing species such as Sesbania sesban. Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala can improve soil physical and chemical properties and suppress weed growth. Forest plantations have been successfully used, particularly with the use of moderate to high tillage, weeding and fertilizer inputs to suppress Imperata growth. These plantations produce marketable wood and reclaim the site for other uses. Additional research is needed to evaluate the specific nature of competition and allelopathic effects from Imperata. Continued evaluation of tree species and provenances for Imperata suppression, forms of tillage after woody fallow crops and the constraints to adoption of cover crops and trees as Imperata control measures are also needed.

AB  - An experiment was carried out under drylot conditions with three grazing systems and 67 animals (3/4 Zebu x 1/4 Holstein), randomly distributed with an average initial weight of 157 kg, in order to study the effect of the stocking rate and number of paddocks on the performance of bovine males in grazing systems with access to Leucaena leucocephala banks. The systems were: A) a grazing of 24 paddocks without access to leucenana banks and 5 animals/ha; B) idem to A but with limited access to leucaena banks and C) 4 paddocks with 3 animals/ha and free access to leucaena banks. Neither fertilizer nor supplementation were applied. Daily live weight gains in the three systems during the experimental period were significantly different, 290, 380 and 465, (P < 0.001). Final weights in that same order were 301, 361 and 403 kg The LW gain/ha/year was of 527, 701 and 509, in which treatment B was better than A and C (P < 0.01), which did not differ between them. The number of paddocks, stocking rate and access to leucaena banks had a positive effect on the individual and per ha gain.

AB  - Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) fodder was supplemented in the ration of 21 Barbari kids of uniform age and body weight to supply 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% CP on the basis of their CP requirements for 16 months. After this period 5 kids exhibited signs of mandibular osteodystrophy fibrosa. Mild to severe changes were recorded in thyroid gland, hepatic parenchyma and mucosa of intestine in animals in groups 2 to 5 after over 2 years of uninterrupted feeding of subabul. Animals subsisting on higher proportion of subabul in the ration (75 and 100%) exhibited decreased number of spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules, degenerative changes in the kidney, myofibrils and hyperplasia of spleen and lymphnode. On the basis of this study, 25-30% incorporation of subabul which is generally considered safe, does not appear to be safe under a long-term feeding.

TI  - The effects of supplementation with Gliricidia sepium or Leucaena leucocephala forage on intake, digestion and live-weight gains of Bos taurus X Bos indicus steers offered napier grass
PY  - 1996
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030526984&doi=10.1017%2fs1357729800015265&partnerID=40&md5=05c34f465a0cb04747d91516ef0d335f
AB  - Two experiments were carried out to evaluate the effect of incremental levels of Gliricidia sepium (gliricidia) and Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) on forage intake, diet apparent digestibility, microbial nitrogen supply and live-weight changes in cattle. In each experiment, 20 intact and five fistulated crossbred steers (Bos taurus X Bos indicus) were used. Napier grass basal diet was offered ad libitum alone or supplemented with 7.5, 15, 22.5, or 30 g dry matter (DM) per kg metabolic body weight (M0.75) gliricidia (experiment 1) or leucaena (experiment 2). In experiment 1, total DM intake increased but not significantly with gliricidia supplementation (5.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.7 (s.e.d. 0.21) kg/day) while intake of napier grass was depressed linearly (5.2, 4.7, 4.5, 4.3, 4.2 (s.e.d. 0.21) kg/ day; P < 0.05). In experiment 2, supplementation with leucaena increased the total DM intake linearly without depressing the intake of napier grass (5.2, 5.8, 6.2, 6.6, 6.7 (s.e.d. 0.31) kg/day; P < 0.001 and 5.2, 5.3, 5.3, 5.3, 5.0 (s.e.d. 0.21) kg/day respectively). Neither gliricidia nor leucaena supplementation affected the apparent digestibility of the diet or in sacco DM degradation characteristics of the forages. Rumen ammonia and live-weight gain were increased linearly (P < 0.05) by supplementation from 130 to 215 mg/l (experiment 1) and 75 to 113 mg/l (experiment 2), from 306 to 478 g/day (experiment 1) and from 538 to 850 g/day (experiment 2), respectively. However, since the responses were linear, further experiments are required to quantify the responses to higher levels of these legume supplements.

AB  - Agricultural use of waste office paper as a soil amendment is restricted by the potential for N immobilization. Our objectives were: 1) to determine agricultural management practices for overcoming N immobilization; and 2) to compare several indices to predict N mineralization or immobilization with application of paper to soil. Mixing of locally-available N sources of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lamb) de Witt) and chicken manure with paper or composting those mixtures for 49 days (d) reduced C:N ratios and the potential for N immobilization but increased lignin and polyphenol contents of the mixtures. A minimum of between 64 to 74 percent leucaena or 82 to 85 percent chicken manure to paper mixtures was needed to overcome N immobilization over a six month period in two common soils on Guam. Soil N mineralization was significantly related to total N, lignin, cellulose, C:N ratio and the cellulose:N ratios of the paper mixtures but not to the lignin:N and the (lignin+polyphenol):N ratios. In the field, an application of between 200 to 400 kg N ha−1 of N fertilizer was required to overcome N immobilization in a crop of sweet corn to which 14 Mg ha −1 of paper had been added. In addition, soil test results suggest that early season N loss by leaching of high rates of N fertilizer may have been reduced by N immobilization after waste paper was applied. © 1997 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Esterase (EST), superoxidedismutase (SOD) and malic enzyme (ME) isozyme patterns were analyzed in Leucaena leucocephala and tetraploid L. diversifolia ssp. diversifolia and in F2, F3, and F4 hybrid plants. No variability was detected in ME, all individuals presenting only one and the same band (rm = 0.17). For SOD clearly different patterns in L. leucocephala (rm = 0.32, 0.40, 0.70) vs. L. diversifolia (rm = 0.12, 0.35, 0.39, 0.72) were found. Hybrid plants presented combined patterns and some of them had a new band (rm = 0.50), absent in the parental species. In EST a great variation within species and hybrids was verified. Up to nine α (rm = 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.62, 0.75 and 0.90) and four β (rm = 0.10, 0.20, 0.25, 0.28) bands were detected; some hybrids had bands absent in the parental species. However, no distinctive EST patterns for the species could be established.

AB  - The xylera ureide method, based on analysis of xylem sap for N solutes associated with N2 fixation (ureides) and soil-N use (NO3                             -, α amino-N), is used for estimating Pfix (proportion of plant N derived from N2 fixation) of herbaceous species of the leguminous tribes Phaseoleae and Desmodieae and may have application for tree legumes. We report experiments, involving Calliandra calothyrsus, Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Sesbania grandiflora, Desmodium rensonii and Codariocalyx gyroides, to: (i) determine for each species the composition of N solutes of xylem sap and to calibrate, where possible, the xylem ureide method using 15N isotope dilution as an independent measure of Pfix; and (ii) establish appropriate procedures for sampling xylem sap in field studies. In the first experiment, the tree legumes were grown for 55-77 weeks and sampled repeatedly (6-9 times) for vacuum-extracted xylem sap, shoot dry matter, total N and 15N. Asparagine was the predominant amino compound in xylem sap of all species. The relative abundance of ureide-N in xylem sap (ureide-N as a proportion of ureide-N + α amino-N + NO3                             --N) was compared with Pfix for five of the six tree legumes. Sap of S. grandiflora could not be analysed for ureides and NO3                             - using the standard colorimetric methods because of high levels of non-specific, background colour. For D. rensonii and C. gyroides, relative ureide-N ranged from less than 20% (Pfix of zero) to around 65 and 40%, respectively (Pfix of 100%). Functions describing the relationships between relative ureide-N (y) and Pfix (x) were: y = 18.3 + 0.446x (r = 0.91) for D. rensonii; and y = 8.49 + 0.279x (r = 0.92) for C. gyroides. With the other three species, relative ureide-N was not related to Pfix. We concluded that the xylem ureide technique is suitable for estimating Pfix for D. rensonii and C. gyroides only. In the second experiment, established trees of G. sepium, D. rensonii, C. calothyrsus and C. gyroides were used to assess sampling protcols. Results indicated that vacuum extraction of sap should proceed immediately the branch is cut, that plants need to be sampled around noon to eliminate diurnal effects and that branch-to-branch variation in relative ureide-N values within a single tree was minor.

AB  - The study of leaf litter decomposition in a semi-arid ecosystem, Madurai, using litterbags showed a reduction in the dry mass of Leucaena leucocephola by 70% and Cymbopogon citratus by 63% after oneyear of exposure. Initial chemical characteristics differed. Linear decay function and exponential decay function provided satisfactory fits to litter data. Different elements (C, N, P, K, Na, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb) have different patterns of release over time and the gains and losses of mineral elements from litter over the time intervals are compared. Variations in leaf litter over the time intervals are compared. Variations in leaf litter disappearance are related to substrate quality, environmental and soil variables. The analysis indicated that C, K, Na, Mg for substrate quality; relative humidity for environmental variables; and soil temperature for soil variables were strongly correlated.

AB  - A research was conducted at ranch "Los Angeles", located in Rosario County at Perijá, Venezuela, region characterized as a tropical dry forest and soils with low fertility and pH of 5.6., presenting a natural low fertility rate (0.8%,2ppm, 0.03me./100g, 1.20ppm, 0.80ppm and 0ppm de Mo, P, K, Ca, Mg and Al, respectively) The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of different fertilization levels of N (0, 30 and 60 Kg/ha) and P (0, 75 and 150 Kg/ha) on mineral content (levels of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Zn y Mn) of two leucaena leucocephala ecotypes (CIAT 7984 and CIAT 17223). The statistical design was a ramdomized split plot design with three replicates. The results obtained showed a higher (P<0.01) mineral content for ecotype CIAT-17223 in both fractions. N fertilization did not affect mineral level in the fine fraction, but Mg which decreased at 60 Kg N/ha. In the coarse fraction, K increased as N fertilization increased while Ca, Mg and Na content remained constant. P fertilization increased Mg, Mn and Zn levels in the fine fraction. Mineral content was increased (P<0.05) in the fine fraction when combining 0 Kg N/ha and 150 Kg P/ha as fertilization levels; however, for the coarse fraction mineral content was increased for the 30 Kg N/ha and 75 Kg P/ha.. For both ecotypes, fine fraction presented the highest levels of mineral accumulation. These levels were greater than the critical levels recommended for grazing animals.

AB  - Assessments of the effects of deforestation, post-clearance tillage methods and farming systems treatments on soil properties were made from 1978 through 1987 on agricultural watersheds near Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria. These experiments were conducted in two phases: Phase I from 1978 through 1981 and Phase II from 1983 to 1987, with 1 year (1982) as a transition phase when all plots were sown with mucuna (Mucuna utilis). There were six treatments in Phase I involving combinations of land clearing and tillage methods: (1) manual clearing with no-till (MC-NT); (2) manual clearing with plough-till (MC-PT); (3) shear-blade clearing with no-till (SB-NT); (4) tree-pusher/root rake clearing with no-till (TP-NT); (5) tree-pusher/root-rake clearing with plough-till (TP-PT); (6) traditional farming (TF). The six treatments were replicated twice in a completely randomized design. The traditional treatment of Phase I was discontinued during Phase II. The five farming systems studied during Phase II with a no-till system in all treatments were: (1) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala established on the contour at 4-m intervals; (2) and (3) fallowing with Mucuna utilis on severely degraded and moderately degraded watersheds, respectively, for 1 year followed by maize-cowpea rotation for another; (4) and (5) ley farming involving establishment of pasture in the first year on severely and moderately degraded plots, respectively, controlled grazing in the second year, and growing maize (Zea mays)-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) in the third year. All treatments, imposed on watersheds of 2-4 ha each, were replicated twice. The soil properties analyzed were particle size distribution, total aggregation and mean weight diameter of aggregates, soil bulk density, penetrometer resistance, water retention characteristics, infiltration capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. These properties were measured under the forest cover in 1978, and once every year during the dry season thereafter during Phases I and II. Prior to deforestation, mean soil bulk density was 0·72 Mg m-3 and 1·30 Mg m-3, soil penetration resistance was 32·4 KPa and 90·7 KPa, and mean weight diameter of aggregates was 3·7 mm and 3·2 mm for 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths, respectively. The infiltration rate was excessive (54-334 cm hr-1) and saturated hydraulic conductivity was rapid (166-499 cm hr-1) under the forest cover. Furthermore, water transmission properties varied significantly even over short distances of about 1 m. Deforestation and cultivation increased soil bulk density and penetration resistance but decreased mean weight diameter of aggregates. One year after deforestation in 1980, mean soil bulk density was 1·41 Mg m-3 for 0-5 cm depth and 1·58 Mg m-3 for 5-10 cm depth. Soil bulk density and penetration resistance were generally higher for NT than for PT methods, and the penetration resistance was extremely high in all treatments by 1985. During Phase II, soil bulk density was high during the grazing cycle of the ley farming treatment. Sand content at 0-5 cm depth increased and clay content decreased with cultivation duration. Soon after deforestation, saturated hydraulic conductivity and equilibrium infiltration rate in cleared and cultivated land declined to only 20-30 per cent of that under forest. Mean saturated hydraulic conductivity following deforestation was 46·0 cm hr-1 for 0-5 cm depth and 53·7 cm hr-1 for 5-10 cm depth. Further, infiltration rate declined with deforestation and cultivation duration in all cropping systems treatments. During Phase I, mean infiltration rate was 115·8 cm hr-1 under forest cover in 1978, 20·9 cm hr-1 in 1979, 17·4 cm hr-1 in 1980 and 20·9 cm hr-1 in 1981. During Phase II, mean infiltration rate was 8·5 cm hr-1 in 1982, 11·9 cm hr-1 in 1983, 11·0 cm hr-1 in 1984, 11·3 cm hr-1 in 1985 and 5·3 cm hr-1 in 1986. Infiltration rate was generally high in ley farming and mucuna fallowing treatments. Natural fallowing drastically improved the infiltration rate from 19·2 cm hr-1 in 1982 to 193·2 cm hr-1 in 1986, a ten-fold increase within 5 years of fallowing. High-energy soil water retention characteristics in Phase I were affected by those treatments that caused soil compaction by mechanized clearing and no-till systems. Soil water retention at 0·01 MPa potential in 1979 was 19·2 per cent (gravimetries) for SB, 17·9 per cent for TP, 15·9 per cent for MC and 17·8 per cent for TF methods. With regards to tillage, soil water retention was 17·8 per cent for NT compared with 16·8 per cent for PT. During Phase H, water retention characteristics were not affected by the farming system treatments. Mean soil water retention (average of 4 years' data from 1982 to 1986) at 0·01 MPa for 0-5 cm depth was 16·6 per cent for alley cropping, 16·7 per cent for mucuna fallowing and 16·8 per cent for ley farming. Mean soil water retention for 1·5 MPa suction was 9·3 per cent for alley cropping, 8·7 per cent for mucuna fallowing, and 9·3 per cent for ley farming. Water retention at 1·5 MPa suction correlated with the clay and soil organic carbon content.

AB  - An experiment was conducted in an upland rice field to test rice crop response to burning in a Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit fallow. No significant differences (P < 0.05) were detected between the burned and unburned treatments in grain or straw yield, or in soil or foliar nutrients, although foliar P concentration was lower in the unburned treatment at P = 0.06. No differences were detected between soils sampled before burning and those collected 182 days after burning. Weeding requirements were greater in the unburned treatment. Stump survival was higher in the unburned treatment (41%) than in the burning treatment (4%). The number of leucaena seedlings at the end of the rice harvest was greater in the unburned treatment. The advantages of the unburned treatment were only in the enhanced regeneration from stumps and seedlings. Advantages of the burned treatment included reduced labour for weeding and greater P availability as evidenced by higher foliar P levels.

AB  - High nitrogen (N2)-fixing potential is a desirable characteristic for any candidate hedgerow tree. Thus a study was conducted to evaluate Albizia lebbeck as a N2-fixing tree in comparison to Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala currently used in alley cropping. Nitrogen fixation and utilization were assessed in a screenhouse at four months after planting by the 15N dilution technique using Senna siamea as the non N2-fixing reference. A. lebbeck accumulated significantly more N than L. leucocephala, but G. sepium was intermediate. This superiority in N yield was mainly due to its abundant nodule dry weight production which accounted for up to 10.8% of its total N. This was equivalent to 2.5 and 6 fold that of Gliricidia and Leucaena nodules, respectively. A. lebbeck had bigger but significantly (P<0.05) lower number of nodules per plant than G. sepium, but it did not differ from Leucaena. Albizia was the best N2 fixer with 44% Ndfa equivalent to 533 mg N per plant. G. sepium followed with 28% Ndfa and L. leucocephala with 18% Ndfa corresponding to 321 and 191 mg N fixed, respectively. However, the relatively higher N2 fixation in Albizia was not translated into higher N or dry matter yields. As A. lebbeck fixed more N, it depended less on soil N (49.8%) than did Leucaena (72.5% Ndfs) and Gliricidia (63.9% Ndfs) and less on fertilizer N as well. Thus A. lebbeck appears to be a potential hedgerow species for alley cropping purpose. © 1995, MCB UP Limited

AB  - Kraft pulp from Leucaena leucocphala with a kappa number of 28 was oxygen delignified and then bleached using two sequences, one employing chlorine and the other chlorine dioxide (clo2), followed by oxidative extraction with hydrogen peroxide. The pulp could be readily bleached to a brightness level of 80% ISO using both sequences. When compared to Eucalyptus, bleachability was achieved more readily for the eucalyptus pulp. With the current environmental concern for pollution, a bleaching sequence utilizing chlorine dioxide is recommended instead of a sequence employing chlorine as it will significantly reduce effluent load in the waste treatment plant. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Inadequate supply of fodder is a serious constraint to the potentially-promising small-holder-dairy production system in coastal Kenya. Alley farming could be an approach to addressing this problem. A study of forage production based on Napier grass and leucaena in an alley cropping system was conducted on an infertile sandy soil in lowland coastal Kenya. The effects of leucaena hedgerows, Clitoria ternatea (L.) intercropping, addition of slurry (110 t ha-1 yr-1) and two harvesting managements (severe and lenient) on the yield of Napier grass fodder, were assessed. The study was initiated in 1989 and three years results are reported. Napier grass fodder yields did not decline in the presence of leucaena heggerows in most harvests. Generally, the Napier rows adjacent to the hedgerows gave greater yields than in either the centre or sole Napier rows. Interplanting clitoria between Napier rows had a beneficial effect on Napier yields in the later harvests. Compared with sole Napier, the hedgerow treatment receiving slurry increased yield ha-1 of Napier by 50%, of total forage by 80%, and of nitrogen (measured over two harvests) by 200%. During the first two years of cropping most treatments did not affect the OM and nitrogen content of the soil but by the end of the third cropping year, slurry application increased soil OM by 21% and slurry and clitoria treatments each increased soil nitrogen by 33%. The study demonstrated the increases in the supply and quality of forages for dairy cattle that can be achieved by planting complementary forages, legume and grass species in an intercropping system like alley farming and the benefits to soil composition by the return of slurry. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Six tree legume species, namely Sesbania grandiflora, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia nilotica, Acacia auriculiformis, Prosopis juliflora and Albizia lebbeck, were grown in iron mine waste soil to study their comparative growth, nodulation and total nitrogen contents with a view to select suitable plant species to be used for reclamation of mine waste soils. Growth responses were found to be highest in S. grandiflora, followed by L. leucocephala and A. nilotica. A. nilotica showed better rooting and nodulation capacity. Total nitrogen content of plant was highest in L. leucocephala. From overall performance, L. leucocephala, S. grandiflora and A. nilotica were seen to be the best responding plants. However, S. grandiflora was unsuitable because of its high water demand, soft wood and lower hardiness. -from Authors

AB  - This experiment was designed to investigate whether circulating mimosine imposes limitations on absorption of amino acids and minerals from the gastrointestinal tract of Alpine goats. Circulating mimosine, portal blood and plasma flow rate, and concentrations and net absorption of amino acids and minerals were measured 60 h before (PRE) and 24 h after (POST) the femoral vein infusion of mimosine (12.5 mg kg-1 BW-0.75 h-1). Mimosine infusion did not affect portal plasma flow rate. Venous and arterial plasma amino acid and mineral concentrations were depressed and the absorption of alanine (P < 0.09), serine (P < 0.04) and methionine (P < 0.03) from the gastrointestinal tract were reduced for up to 24 h after the cessation of mimosine infusion, even when normal feeding was resumed. This disruption was possibly caused by the circulating mimosine (4.88 μm 1-1 during POST) directly, via chelation or competition for absorption, or, indirectly, by gastrointestinal lesions resulting from circulating mimosine. Pivotal to this experiment was the observation that mimosine was eliminated from the goat circulatory system approximately 40 times more rapidly in a 24 h period than when similar concentrations were infused in sheep. © 1995.

TI  - Productivity of hedgerow shrubs and maize under alleycropping and block planting systems in semiarid Kenya
PY  - 1995

AB  - A field experiment was conducted for eight cropping seasons from 1988 to 1991 in semiarid Machakos, Kenya, to compare the productivity of shrubs and crops in intercropping (alleycropping) versus block (sole) planting systems. The study, conducted in a split-plot experiment with three replications, consisted of two tree species (Leucaena leucocephala and Senna siamea syn. Cassia siamea) in the main-plots and combinations of two planting systems (alleycropping and block planting of the shrubs and maize) with five different ratios of land allocation for the shrub and crop (100:0, 15:85, 20:80, 25:75, and 0:100) in sub-plots. Thus, a sole maize and a sole tree were included in the subplot treatments. The spacing between hedgerows of shrubs in intercropping was 6.7, 5, and 4 m, respectively, corresponding to 15, 20, and 25% land allocation to shrubs. The trees were pruned to 0.5 m height four times a year. Intercropped hedgerows of senna and leucaena produced 10% and 24% more biomass than their respective block planting systems. On average, leucaena produced more biomass than senna. Maize alleycropped with leucaena yielded 16% less grain than sole-crop maize, whereas senna intercropping caused hardly any maize-yield reduction. Compared with the respective sole-crop systems, leucaena intercropping did not affect land equivalent ratio (LER), whereas LER increased by 28% with senna intercropping. The different tree:crop land occupancy ratios did not affect the production of either the component species or of the total system, except that LER declined with incrreased spacing between hedgerows. It is concluded that in semiarid highlands of Kenya, leucaena and crops should better be grown in sole blocks, not in alleycropping. In the case of slow-growing species such as senna, intercropping is worthwhile to consider only if the additional labour needed does not pose a serious problem for management, and the species has fodder value. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - A Tn5lacZ-insertion mutant of the Leucaena-nodulating Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 defective in exopolysaccharide (EPS) and lipopolysacchsaride (LPS) synthesis was characterized. This mutant, NP84, formed pseudonodules on Phaseolus vulgaris and Gliricidia sepium that did not show invasion by bacteria. On Leucaena leucocephala it formed nodules that appeared Fix- at 4 weeks but Fix+ at 8 weeks after inoculation. Microscopic examination of the sections of the L. leucocephala nodules formed by NP84 after 4 weeks of inoculation showed fewer infected cells than in nodules formed by TAL1145. Ultrastructural differences were observed in the cells infected by NP84 compared with those infected by TAL1145. When NP84 was coinoculated with TAL1145 on L. leucocephala, all nodules were occupied by TAL1145 although some nodules showed double occupancy with NP84. None of the nodules were found to be infected by NP84 alone. A 3.8-kb DNA fragment of TAL1145 was identified and cloned that complemented NP84 for EPS, LPS, and symbiotic defects.

AB  - Collagenase (100 μg) induced a large plasma extravasation, during the first 15 min after its injection in rat paw, associated with the rapid development of oedema which subsided after 6 h. The extent of the oedema was similar in normal and kininogen-deficient rats. The swelling induced in normal rats was reduced by HOE 140 (d-Arg[Hyp3, Thi5, d-Tic7, Oic8]bradykinin), a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, and by three serine protease inhibitors, soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), Leucaena leucocephala trypsin inhibitor 1 (LLTI-1) and Leucaena leucocephala trypsin inhibitor 2 (LLTI-2). These agents had no effect on the oedema induced in kininogen-deficient rats. The swelling was also reduced by methysergide, indomethacin, ketoprofen and methylprednisolone. It was increased by heparin, but it was not modified by mepyramine, WEB 2086 (3-[4-(2-chlorophenyl)-9-methyl-6H-thieno[3,2-f][1,2,4]-triazolo-[4,3-a][1,4]-diazepine-2-yl-1-(4-morpholinyl)-1-(propanone) and NG-nitro-l-arginine. In vitro, collagenase did not release kinins from rat plasma or from purified T-kininogen. LLTI-1 and LLTI-2 did not inhibit collagenase activity for one of its specific substrates. Kinins are thus involved in the development of collagenase oedema in normal rats. Their generation would be indirect following changes in matrix proteins in extravascular spaces. Nevertheless, kinins are not the decisive mediators of the swelling. Serotonin, possibly released from platelets, and prostanoids participate in the inflammatory process. © 1995.

AB  - In two experiments with Gliricidia sepium (G) and G combined with Leucaena leucocephala (GL), 14 West African Dwarf goats were offered seven feed levels varying from 60 to 120 g DM kg-0.75 d-1, with increments of 10 g, in Expt. 1, and from 40 to 130 g DM kg-0.75 d-1, with increments of 15 g in Expt. 2. Maximum DMI for the G and GL were, in Expt. 1: 72.5 ± 2.6 and 90.7 ± 27.2, in Expt. 2: 55.5 ± 3.7 and 63.4 ± 5.3 g kg-0.75 d-1, respectively. In both experiments GL rations were more digestible than G rations, the difference in the second experiment being larger (10.3 vs. 3.6 percentage units), mainly due to a lower digestibility of G. A marked effect of refusal rate on intake was found and the relationship between refusal rate and DMI differed per diet. Animal production per unit of forage offered was maximal at offer levels ranging from 79.4 (Expt. 1, G) to 106.6 g DM kg-0.75 d-1 (Expt. 1, GL). Corresponding weight gains were estimated to range from 2.0 (G2) to 8.2 g kg-0.75 d-1 (GL1). Refusal rates at maximum production levels varied from 13.4% (G1) to 41.6% (G2). Estimated maintenance levels were attained at refusal rates varying from 0.7% (G1) to 20.3% (G2). It was concluded that a wide range of offer levels is required to obtain a reliable estimate of the relationship between feed offer and intake. Feeding at a fixed refusal rate to determine the quality of feeds may lead to misjudgment as feeds do not attain maximum intake at the same refusal rate. If a feed is heterogenuous and thus offers opportunity for selection, high offer levels and accompanying high refusal rates may have to be accepted if the objective is to maximise animal production per unit of available feed. © 1995.

PY  - 1996

AB  - In agroforestry systems, loppings from trees and shrubs are commonly used, often as mulch, as sources of nutrients for interplanted crops. Therefore, it is important to understand the rates of mulch decomposition. This paper reports the results of a study on the decomposition and nitrogen (N)-mineralization patterns of the leaves, small twigs, and mulch (leaves plus twigs) of Leucaena leucocephala and Cassia siamea in a field experiment in an Alfisol in semiarid Kenya. Plant materials contained in 5mm nylon bags were placed below or on the soil surface in an alleycropping system involving the two tree species, with maize (Zea mays L.) as the intercrop. For plant materials of both species (except Leucaena leaves), there were two phases of decompositions: an initial rapid phase and a slower second one; Leucaena leaves had only a single phase. When placed below the soil surface, the decomposition rates of both Leucaena and Cassia mulch were similar (about 12% week-1 in the first phase and 1% week-1 in the second phase). When placed on the soil surface, Leucaena mulch decomposed 1.3 times more rapidly than Cassia mulch in the first phase. The patterns of N release from the mulch of both species were similar to those of mass loss. In general, mulch- decomposition and N-release rates of both species were related more to their C:N ratios than to polyphenol contents; while C:N ratio predicted the rate of first (rapid) phase, the rate of the second (slow) phase appeared to be regulated by lignin and polyphenol contents.

AB  - In southern Benin, West Africa, two alley cropping systems were studied from 1986 to 1992. Yield development was followed in a maize and cassava crop rotation vs. intercropping system, with alleys of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. vs. a no-tree control, with and without NPK fertilizer. Without alleys, NPK fertilization maintained high yield levels of 2-3 t maize dry grain plus 4-6 t ha-1 cassava root DM in intercropping 3-4 t ha-1 maize and 6-10 t ha-1 cassava in solecropping. Without NPK, final yields seemed to stabilize at about 1 t maize plus 2 t cassava in intercropping and twice as much in each solecrop. Alley cropping induced significant yield increases by about 50% with both tree species in unfertilized, intercropped maize, and with Cajanus in fertilized, solecropped cassava. In monetary terms, the NPK-fertilizer response of stabilized yields was significant lot all treatments except the solecropped Leucaena alleys. It is concluded that on Ultisols with low nutrient status in the upper rooting zone, alley cropping with low competitive tree species may improve food crop yields but the greatest monetary output is achieved by intercropping with mineral fertilizer independent of the presence or absence of an agroforestry component.

AB  - The effects of leucaena hedgerows, mulching with leucaena foliage (0,50 and 100% of harvested foliage), cowpea intercropping and adition of dairy cattle slurry (55 t ha-1 per maize crop) on the yield of maize from a sandy soil were assessed. The four-year results from five maize crops are reported. Except in the first year, yields of maize grain and stover were significantly reduced by 30% in the presence of leucaena hedgerows. Use of leucaena mulch eliminated this effect; application of all the harvested leucaena mulch (100%) increased the total maize grain yield of the five crops by 44% over sole maize. Hedgerow and mulching management required an additional 36 mandays labour ha-1 which was more than compensated by the increased maize yields. Furthermore leucaena hedgerows substantially depressed the growth of weeds between cropping seasons. Intercropping with cowpea significantly depressed yields of maize grain and stover when both crops were sown together, but not in later seasons when cowpea was sown four weeks after the maize. Application of slurry increased the total yields of maize grain and stover by 35 and 37%, respectively. The grain yield of maize in leucaena hedgerow treatments fertilized with slurry did not respond to application of more than 50% of leucaena foliage, which suggested that half of the foliage could be spared for feeding to livestock. The cumulative yield of maize grain from the highest yielding organic system was 85% of the yield from the fertilizer treatment. The study, which is continuing, demonstrates that large increases in agricultural productivity are possible through the intercropping of maize with woody forage and grain legumes and the integration of dairy cattle production into the system. It thus shows the importance of exploiting crop/livestock interactions. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Agronomic and economic benefits of maize intercropped with groundnut in alleys formed by Leucaena leucocephala were assessed at Matomb, Cameroon, from 1990 to 1992: (a) without fertilizers and (b) with the application of 200 or 400 kg ha-1 of N-P2O5-K2O (20-10-10). In treeless (control) plots, maize grain yields decreased from 1.2 t ha-1 in 1990 to 0.8 t ha-1 in 1992, while groundnut yields declined from 1.1 to 0.5 t ha-1 during the same period. With the application of Leucaena prunings alone, groundnut yield was maintained around 1 t ha-1 for 3 years while maize yields stabilized at 2.5 t ha-1 in the second and the third year; the yields of both crops were greater over the 3 years than in the control. Leucaena prunings applied in combination with 200 and 400 kg ha-1 of N2-P2O5-K2O increased maize yield by 1.7 and 2.0 t ha-1, respectively, but groundnut yield decreased by 13 and 24% over the 3 years. The dominance analysis showed that alley cropping without fertilizer was the only non-dominated alternative, with a marginal rate of return of 447%. It was the best system at this early stage (3 years) of implementing the technology. © 1995.

Soil loss averaged 2.0 t/ha per year on the Leucaena plots compared with an initial 80 t/ha per year on the unprotected control plot, falling to 27 t/ha per year after the top soil had been eroded. After 6 years, micro terraces of 35 cm high and 81 cm wide had developed on the intercropped plots, with substantially improved soil properties. Maize yield (unfertilized) were maintained at 1.5-2.0 t/ha on the protected plots, compared with a progressive fall from 0.8 to 0.5 t/ha on the sole maize control. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - In the first two of four experiments, sheep were fed, ad libitum, sorghum stover supplemented with graded levels of foliage of the shrub leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) or mulga (Acacia aneura), which provided between 0 and 0.34 or between 0 and 0.43 of the dietary dry matter (DM) respectively. A second treatment (with or without urea) was superimposed in a factorial design. The effect of treatments on liveweight (LW) was explainable by their effects on voluntary intake of apparently digestible organic matter (DOMI). DOM1 was increased by mulga, largely due to an increase in the total voluntary intake of organic matter (OM). Leucaena increased DOMI by increasing the ration OM digestibility and, at low levels of inclusion, intake of the basal diet. Roughage intake was greatest when leucaena provided 0.15-0.20 of the dietary DM. Leucaena increased rumen ammonia, and whenever roughage intake was increased by urea, leucaena also increased it. In the third experiment, when diets were made isonitrogenous with urea, roughage intake was slightly greater when leucaena, rather than its ash or a mineral mixture, was supplemented. Total OM intake and DOMI were greatest when leucaena was fed. In the final experiment, sheep were fed one of ten treatments: three basal diets (two of sorghum stover and the third of native pasture hay) each supplemented with legumes (leucaena to the hay and one stover diet and cowpea straw to the second stover diet), ash of the respective legume and formaldehyde-treated casein. The tenth treatment was sorghum stover plus urea. For sorghum stover diets with leucaena-based or cowpea straw-based supplements, DOMI responded linearly to the non-urea nitrogen concentration of the diet. On the other hand, for native hay with leucaena-based supplements, the response of DOMI to non-urea N was negligible. It was noted that the native hay (predominantly Flinders grass, Iseilema vaginiflorum), contained lower concentrations of polyphenols than sorghum stover. It was concluded that browse foliage can increase the voluntary DOMI of sheep consuming low quality roughages by providing nitrogen and sometimes minerals and OM of greater digestibility. The slowly-degradable proteins in leucaena, cowpea straw or formaldehyde-treated casein are more effective with polyphenol-rich sorghum stover than with native hay of otherwise similar composition. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Three to six-week old plants of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, cv K8, were grown hydroponically without root nodules. They showed much better growth response to nitrate than to ammonium. They were found to be tolerant to salinity of up to 50 mM NaCl. Effects of salinity in this range and moderate Na+ accumulation in young organs could be alleviated by supplying 10 mM nitrate to the medium. Na+ mainly accumulated in basal leaves and cotyledons as disposable organs. Distribution of Cl was more uniform than of Na+, its exclusion from young organs by nitrate was less effective. K+ distribution in the plants was almost uniform and little affected by NaCl, while nitrate accumulated only in the roots and at high external concentrations. Nitrate uptake of N-starved plants initially showed higher rates, a maximum after 2 h and then increased during several hours suggesting a constitutive and an inducible transport component. Induction of nitrate assimilation as shown by nitrate reductase activity (EC 1.6.6.2). Nitrate uptake was not affected by 20 mM NaCl. In K+ -and N-starved plants uptake rates of K+ roughly followed those of nitrate. In N-supplied plants nitrate reductase activity was found mainly in the roots, where in starved plants induction was also strongest. In the nutrient supplied culture salt treatment especially stimulated nitrate reductase activity in the roots. In general, counteraction of nitrate to salinity effects occurs in distribution of the ions within the plant but only at low salinity.

The median chemical composition for leucaena leaf meal [g 100 g-1 dry matter (DM basis)] was calculated to be 4.15 nitrogen (N), 29.2 crude protein (CP), 4.3 mimosine, 19.2 crude fibre (CF), 10.5 ash, 1.01 tannin (Tn), 1.9 calcium (Ca), 0.23 phosphorous (P), 0.34 magnesium (Mn), 1.7 potassium (K), 237.5 ppm carotene. The median chemical composition (g 100 g-1 DM of Leucaena forage was 3.52 N, 22.03 CP, 2.14 mimosine, 3.5 CF, 39.5 neutral detergent fibre (NDF), 35.1 acid detergent fibre (ADF), 4.71 hemicellulose, 18.3 ash, 1.05 tannin, 0.22 sulphur, 1.80 Ca, 0.26 P, 0.33 Mg, 1.45 K, 169.5 mg kg-1 zinc (Zn), and 26 mg kg-1 copper (Cu) and 881.6 mg kg-1 oxalate. The digestible energy (DE) value of Leucaena forage varied from 11.6 to 12.9 MJ kg-1 DM, the total apparent digested crude protein (TADCP) reported ranged from 64.7 to 78.0%. A model developed in one source suggested 42% rumen degradable protein (RDP), with 48% of the undegradable protein (UDP) being digested post ruminally, giving a TADCP value of 70%. Leucaena forage productivity indicated that the optimum harvesting interval or age at harvest should be about 8 weeks or just before the onset of flowering.

AB  - The effect of 3 species of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi on the growth of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit. in a phosphorus-deficient and aluminumsulfate (AIS)-treated medium was investigated in a screenhouse experiment. Plant height, root length, nodulation, phosphorus uptake and nitrogen fixation were used as indices of plant performance. While there were significant differences among mycorrhizal plants with respect to these indices, they outperformed their non-mycorrhizal counterparts in all respects except in nitrogen content. Of the 3 mycorrhizal species studied, Glomus etunicatum (Becker and Gerd) was the most efficient, followed by Glomus fasciculatum (Thaxter) Gerd and Trappe, and finally, Gigaspora margarita (Becker and Hall). Both aluminumsulfate and mycorrhizal treatments increased shoot dry weight. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The paper reports selected results from an extensive experiment in which runoff and soil loss were measured from a range of treatments applied to runoff plots at the Visayas State College of Agriculture (VISCA) in the Philippines. Treatments included bare soil, common agricultural practice, and a range of soil-conserving practices, including intercrops and hedgerows of Leucaena leucocephala. The presence of a maize crop reduced soil loss but not runoff relative to the bare plot. Addition of hedgerows approximately halved runoff from the steep experimental plots, thereby reducing soil loss, though sediment concentration was similar to the cropped treatment. The addition of an intercrop of peanut further reduced both runoff and sediment concentration in the runoff, thus leading to a substantial reduction in soil loss. The erodibility of a nearby different soil at low slope (10%) was found to be high, but its erodibility appeared to be increased following cultivation. © 1995.

AB  - Three methods: litterbags, incubation of materials in pots and incubation in leaching-tubes, were compared to determine the effects of N, lignin and polyphenols of legume tree prunings on their decomposition and N release rates in a Red-yellow Podzolic soil (Ultisol). A protein-binding capacity assay was used to measure the content of active polyphenols in pruning materials in relation to their effect on decomposition. Prunings of Calliandra calothyrsus, Peltophorum pterocarpa, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and a mixture of Peltophorum and Gliricidia from an alley cropping experiment in Lampung, Indonesia, were used for the study. Decomposition and N release rates of the prunings were in the order Gliricidia > Leucaena > Calliandra > Peltophorum in all three incubation methods, however, the patterns of N release varied between incubation methods and species. The (lignin + polyphenol):N ratio was consistently among the best quality descriptions to predict weight losses and N released from the prunings in the litterbag and leaching-tube experiments but not in the pot experiment. In the latter the lack of a good correlation with quality factors maybe due to the presence of soluble polyphenols with a greater capacity to bind protein under non-leaching conditions. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Peak flowering activity among woody species in the tropical dry forests of St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, coincided with the brief spring rainy season but continued at moderate levels for six months, abating with the autumn rains. Fruit maturation showed a major peak in the long winter dry season and a minor crest during the summer dry season. Seeds of wind‐dispersed species disseminated mainly during the winter dry season, while animal dispersal of seeds (74% of all woody species) followed the bimodal pattern (for wet and dry seasons) described for the community as a whole. Under shadehouse conditions, most dry forest tree species germinated well (> 80%) and emerged promptly (within four weeks of planting) and synchronously (90% emergence within a four‐week interval). Nine of 29 species tested in the shadehouse manifested dormancy of at least six weeks. Seed germinability varied among tree species, and the viability of most species began to decline following six months of dry storage. Few species retained high germinability after nine months of dry storage. The species composition of soil seed banks did not correspond closely with above‐ground communities on three forested sites of varying stand age. in the youngest stand (35 years old), dominated by the weedy, arborescent legume Leucaena leucocephala, the soil seed bank was also dominated by this species, but no seeds of any other tree species were found in the soil samples. Seeds of native trees were scarcely encountered (only one indigenous species) in soil seed bank samples of three forest sites. Local seed rain from less disturbed forest may not be sufficient for prompt recovery of the dry forest community on degraded sites. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Somatic antigens of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Rhizobium sp. (Cicer arietinum) and Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena leucocephala) were prepared as standard, single-species type from cultured cells. Equal numbers of the cells of these rhizobia were then combined to obtain a mixed-rhizobial-species antigen preparation. Rabbits were immunized either with the standard, single-species type or with the mixed-rhizobial-species antigen preparations. The antisera developed from the mixed antigen immunization contained antibodies for all three rhizobial species, detectable at agglutination titres of over 800. The mixed-rhizobial-species antisera were made species specific by cross-absorption. The cross-absorbed and the mixed-rhizobial-species antisera were generally similar in quality for strain identification by agglutination, fluorescent antibodies, immunoblot and ELISA. A 66% reduction in cost was estimated for the production of antisera by immunization with mixed-rhizobial-species antigen. © 1994 Rapid Communications of Oxford Ltd.

AB  - A model experiment was carried out at 15, 25, and 35°C to investigate the changes in microbial biomass and the pattern of mineralization in upland soil during 8 weeks following the addition of 8 organic materials including 6 tropical plant residues, ipil ipil (Leucaena leucocephala), azolla (Azolla pinnata), water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), dhaincha (Sesbania rostrata), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and sunhemp (Crotalaria juncea). The amounts of CO2-C evolved and inorganic N produced at 35°C were about 2 times larger than those at 15°C. At any temperature, the flush decomposition of C was observed within the first week and thereafter the rate of mineralization became relatively slow. A negative correlation was observed between inorganic N and C/N ratios of the added organic materials. The relationships between the amounts of cellulose or cellulose plus hemicellulose and the amount of mineralized N of the added organic materials were also negative. The changes in the microbial biomass were affected by temperatures. The amount of biomass C and N was maximum after 42 d of incubation at 15°C, and after 7 d at 25 and 35°C, and thereafter decreased. The rate of biomass decline was slower at 15°C and faster at 35°C than at 25°C. Regardless of the temperatures, the addition of organic materials enhanced microbial biomass formation throughout the incubation periods. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Fast growing trees, in particular nitrogen fixing trees, are essential for the establishment of sustainable agroforestry practices by resource-poor and/or environmentally conscious farmers. An important selection factor for trees is therefore high N2 fixing capability. This study was conducted to examine biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in Leucaena leucocephala L., as affected by growth in pots containing 4, 10, 15 and 30 kg soil and when grown together with Eucalyptus camaldulensis. BNF was measured by the 15N isotope dilution technique. Leucaena and Eucalyptus were grown either sole (SL, SE) or in two mixtures (1:1 - L1:E1 and 1:2 - L1:E2) for a period of 6 months. Planting pattern influenced (P < 0.05) dry matter and N content of shoot and roots of Eucalyptus, as the sole planted trees gave the highest yield. Dry matter, N content and total amount of N fixed by Leucaena significantly decreased with decreasing rooting volume. Also, the smaller the rooting volume (or soil weight), the higher was the proportion (%) of N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) by leucaena. For each rooting volume, the sole or mixed planting pattern did not significantly influence either the proportion (%) or amount of N fixed by leucaena. For these trees, therefore, rooting volume rather than cropping pattern influenced the proportion and amount of nitrogen fixed.

AB  - Data on chemical composition of Leucaena leucocephala are presented. The nitrogen, sugar, starch and neutral detergent fibre contents were 32.4, 42.8, 8.6 and 201.8 g kg-1 dry matter. Gross energy was 20.24 MJ/kg DM. Tannin content was 2.9% while total trypsin concentration is also presented. In Experiment 1 the effect of different levels of inclusion of leucaena in rabbit broiler mash on performance of rabbits was studied. Treatment A was 100% broiler mash while Treatments B and C were composed of 15% and 30% leucaena meal, the other portions being broiler mash. Growth rate, feed intake and feed conversion ratio and dressing percentage were not affected by level of inclusion. Experiment 2 with 40 female rabbits comprised five treatments: Treatment A was rabbit broiler mash while Treatments B, C, D and E were made up of 40% of either Leuneae cornuta, Leucaena leucocephala or Commelina benghalensis or equal proportions of the three species respectively, the other portions being broiler mash. Animals on Treatment A had relatively higher liveweights and dressing percentages but were not significantly different from those of Treatments B, C and E (P>0.05). Rabbits on Treatment D had significantly (P<0.05) lower growth rate and dressing percentage. In Experiment 3, 12 growing-finishing pigs were allocated to three treatments: A, B and C. The three treatments contained 0, 10 and 20% leucaena leaf meal respectively, substituted at the expence of the standard commercial feed. Growth rates of 654, 512 and 410 g per day and feed conversion ratios of 3.97, 5.02 and 6.22 g feed g-1 gain were obtained for pigs on Treatments A, B and C respectively. © 1994.

AB  - A long-term field experiment was established on a kaolinitic Alfisol in Ibadan, Nigeria, in 1972. The land was cleared manually from secondary forest and used for (i) continuous no-till cropping with maize (Zea mays L.) and maize/cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) intercropping, (ii) planted fallow of guinea grass (Panicum maximum Jacq.), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala de wit), and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan Millsp.), and (iii) natural bush regrowth in a randomized complete block design with three replications. At the end of 15 years, the fallow plots were cleared manually and cropped with maize for three years. The chemical and physical soil properties and crop performance of the newly-cleared plots were compared with those under 15 years of continuous cultivation. A total of 26 woody species were identified on the bush regrowth plots. Above-ground biomass accumulation of the bush plots was 157 Mg ha-1 containing 1316 kg N ha-1. Guinea grass, leucaena and natural bush regrowth plots had comparable organic C concentrations (approximately 20 g kg-1) in the surface soil (0 to l0 cm) after 15 years. The organic C concentration in the surface soil under pigeon pea was the lowest (9.5 g kg- 1) among the four fallow treatments. Soil under 15 years of continuous no- till maize with and without residue mulch, respectively, contained approxi- mately half (10 g kg-1) and a quarter (5.7 g kg-1) of the organic C under natural bush or guinea grass fallow. The levels of exchangeable Ca, K, Mg and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) were lower in the soils under continuous cultivation than in those under natural bush and planted fallow. Soil acidification occurred in soils under continuous cropping as depicted by the lower pH values and greater exchangeable Al and Mn concentrations compared to the fallow plots. Grain yield of maize (3 to 5 Mg ha-1) without fertilizer application in the plots newly cleared from natural bush, guinea grass and leucaena fallow was comparable with that of continuous no-till maize with residue mulch and chemical fertilizer (N, P, K, Mg, Zn) applications. Among the four fallow treatments, maize grain and stover yields were the lowest in plots cleared from pigeon pea fallow.

AB  - Root competition in polyculture systems involving combinations of four tree species and four grass species was evaluated based on 32P recovery by each species in mixed and sole crop situations. The tree species were: Leucaena leucocephala, Casuarina equisetifolia, Acacia auriculiformis and Ailanthus triphysa, and the grass species were: Pennisetum purpureum (hybrid napier), Brachiaria ruziziensis (congo signal), Panicum maximum (guinea grass) and Zea mexicana (teosinte). Four lateral distance (25 and 50 cm) and depth (15 and 50 cm) treatments were included in the study to characterize the relative fine root distribution of trees. Absorption of 32P was monitored through radioassay of leaves. Regardless of the species, 32P uptake from 50 cm soil depth was lower than that of 15 cm depth. Absorption of 32P from 50 cm lateral distance was also less than that of 25 cm distance in Acacia and Casuarina. Grass species in sole crop situations absorbed more 32P than in mixed systems. None of the grass species when grown in association with tree components affected the absorption of 32P by trees. All grass species exerted a complementary effect on 32P absorption by Casuarina. Leucaena also benefited in the same way when grown in association with congo signal and/or teosinte. Of the tree species, Acacia and Leucaena adversely affected the 32P uptake by grass species.

AB  - Two hundred and eighty seven isolates of Rhizobium nodulating Phaseolus vulgaris L. were sampled in France from four geographically distant field populations. They were characterized by their colony morphology and by plasmid profiles. A representative sample was further characterized: a) by the ability of each isolate to nodulate a potential alternative host Leucaena leucocephala and to grow on specific media, and b) by RFLP analysis of PCR amplified 16S rRNA genes. On the basis of their phenotypic and genetic characteristics the isolates could be assigned either to Rhizobium leguminosarum bv phaseoli, or to R. tropici. The two species co-occurred at three sites. R. leguminosarum bv phaseoli represented 2%, 4%, 72% and 100% of the population at the four different sites. Eighteen and 22 different plasmid profiles were identified within R. tropici and R. leguminosarum bv phaseoli, respectively. Some of them were conserved between distant geographical regions. The fact that R. tropici was found in France shows that this species is not limited to tropical regions and gives additional evidence of the multi-specific nature of the Phaseolus microsymbiont, even over a geographically limited area. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - An experiment was carried out to evaluate dairy performance and rumen fermentation from a forage-based diet supplemented with Lucaena leococephala (leucaena) and maize bran. Bos indicus (Ayrshire/Brown Swiss) х Bos taurus (Sahiwal) cattle were offered Pennisetum purpureum (napier grass) ad libitum either unsupplemented (N) or supplemented on a dry-matter (DM) basis with 1 kg (LL) or 2 kg leucaena (LH) or 2 kg leucaena together with 1 kg DM maize bran (LHM). Food intake, milk yield, diet apparent digestibility and nitrogen balance were measured using eight cows (mean live weight 384 (s.d. 41) kg in two 4х4 Latin squares. Rumen fermentation was measured using four rumen fistulated steers (mean live weight 352 (s.d. 12) kg in a 4 х 4 Latin square. Performance was recorded during the last 7 days of each 21-day experimental period. Supplementation increased food intake (6·3, 7·6, 7·9 and 8·7 kg DM per day; P < 0·01; s.e.d. 0·24) and milk yield (5·1, 5·4, 5·5 and 6·5 kg/day; P < 0·01; s.e.d. 0·28) for N, LL, LH and LHM respectively. Supplemented diets tended to be more digestible compared with napier grass as the sole food (organic matter apparent digestibility coefficients 0·54, 0·55, 0·57 and 0·57; s.e.d. 0·020; N, LL, LH and LHM, respectively) and N balance increased progressively with supplementation. Supplementation progressively increased rumen ammonia-nitrogen concentrations in steers and the rate of rumen degradation of napier grass increased when leucaena (diets LL and LH) was offered. The results suggest that supplementation of napier grass with leucaena increased DM intake owing to increased ammonia concentrations and rates of napier degradation in the rumen. Supplementation of the forage diet with 1 kg DM maize bran did not significantly reduce the rumen degradation of napier grass and increased the molar proportions of propionate which may have increased the efficiency of utilization of metabolizable energy and therefore milk production. © 1995, British Society of Animal Science.

AB  - A longterm experiment was conducted on Alfisols at Ibadan, Nigeria, to assess agricultural productivity and sustainability of different farming systems. The experiment, conducted for a 10 year period from 1979 to 1988, was implemented in two phases. The effects of methods of land clearing on crop growth-yield were evaluated during Phase I from 1979 to 1982. Effects of different farming systems on agronomic productivity were evaluated in Phase II from 1983 to 1988. Six land clearing-cum-tillage treatments evaluated in Phase I were: (i) manual clearing with no-till, (ii) manual clearing with plow-till, (iii) shearblade clearing with no-till, (iv) treepusher/rootrake clearing with no-till, (v) treepusher/rootrake clearing with plow-till, and (vi) traditional farming. Similarly, six farming systems evaluated in Phase II were: (i) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala, (ii) Mucuna fallowing on severely degraded soils (iii) Mucuna fallowing on moderately degraded soil, (iv) ley farming on severely degraded soil, (v) ley farming on moderately degraded soil, and (vi) natural fallow control. In Phase I, yields of maize (Zea mays), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and cassava (Manihoc esculenta) were higher on manually cleared with no-till and shearblade cleared with no-till treatments than on other treatments. In Phase II, maize growth was higher on plots with Mucuna fallowing than in alley cropping or ley farming treatments. In contrast, cowpea growth was higher on alley cropped plots. Regardless of the farming system, maize grain yield declined with the cultivation duration. The relative decline in cowpea grain yield with cultivation duration was less than that of maize. © 1994 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two projects on alley cropping research and development have been implemented in the Forest zone of Cameroon (FZC) since 1988. Their goal was to identify the main agricultural constraints in the FZC and to introduce alley cropping in the farming systems to improve soil fertility and crop yields. The first step in the implementation process was the participatory surveys which revealed that (a) the main agricultural constraint in the FZC is low soil fertility; (b) alley cropping is an agroforestry technology which may solve the problem; (c) alley cropping should be first targetted to farmers who own inherited or purchased lands. The second step was the on-station tree screening activity from which Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra calothyrsus and Paraserianthes falcataria were identified as promising tree species. The third activity was to test alley cropping with three promising tree species (Leucaena, Gliricidia and Calliandra) on farmers' fields. Results from the first year testing on farmers' fields showed that: (1) the direct seeding method used was ineffective: seedling emergence rate was 45% for Leucaena and 52% for Gliricidia; (2) Cassava suppressed the growth of Leucaena and Gliricidia by 57 and 45%, respectively; (3) three-month-old Calliandra seedlings planted 1 m away from cassava plants had 96% survival rate. Based on these third step findings, all new farms were established with Calliandra seedlings using maize as a test-crop in the year of establishment and the subsequent year. After two years of cropping, maize grain yield in alley plots was 52% higher than maize grown on no-tree plots. In 1993, 52 farmers who had witnessed the alley farm maize growth in 1992 requested to join the project. This sudden interest of farmers to start their own alley farms was considered as a positive sign for adoption and therefore a success in alley cropping (AC) introduction in the zone. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Leaf and root (tuber) nutrient uptake patterns of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) alley-cropped with gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), and senna [(Senna (syn. Cassia) siamea] as influenced by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) inoculation in a degraded Alfisol were investigated in consecutive years. The cassava plants were mulched with fresh prunings of each hedgerow tree species at 2-month intervals in the second and third years of alley cropping. While VAM inoculation significantly influenced the root uptake of nutrients, the leaf uptake was not affected except for the uptake of P. In most cases, there was no difference in the nutrient concentration between inoculated and uninoculated plants, either in the leaf or in the root, indicating that the productivity of cassava was regulated by the amount of nutrients the roots could absorb. In spite of similar total soil N in all inoculated and uninoculated alley-cropped cassava plots and similar exchange-able soil K contents in inoculated and uninoculated alley-cropped cassava plots with leucaena and senna, greater uptake of N, P, and K and greater concentrations of K were observed in roots of inoculated alley-cropped cassava with gliricidia and leucaena than with senna. These results indicated that greater mineralization and availability of nutrients to cassava roots from prunings of nodulating gliricidia and leucaena than from non-nodulating senna may be important, particularly with efficient VAM inoculation, in these alley-cropping systems. Also, for similar nutrients in the inoculated and uninoculated cassava soils alley-cropped with each hedgerow species, VAM inoculation significantly enhanced cassava root dry weights, indicating that an effective VAM fungus can be an agent of greater nutrient uptake in a competitive environment. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Structural and histochemical features of the hilar region in the seed of Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (De Wit) were investigated by bright-field and fluorescence light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In the dry seeds the lens appeared as an elliptical depression prevailing in size over the hilum and micropyle. In the imbibed seeds, both naturally softened seed and those requiring softening with boiling water, the lens rose gradually to form a cavity between the palisade layer and the mesophyll below. This apoplastic pathway was traced using Ruthenium Red dye. In place of the hour-glass cells, the hilar region contained abnormal cells, called ’white cells’ because they remained unstained by Toluidine Blue O at pH 4·4. The apparently opposing characteristics of the lens are discussed. It is hypothesized that the lens acts as a valve. By remaining closed it hinders the entry of water because of the presence of a high light-line rich in callose and in lipid-like substances and to the almost total lack of hydrophilic polysaccharide material. Under favourable conditions for germination, the lens opens, allowing water to enter, through a thin palisade layer and with the probable intervention of the ’white cells’. © 1995 Annals of Botany Company.

AB  - In alley-cropping systems, hedgerow trees are regularly cut back. Losses of N released from the decomposing prunings are minimized when N release is synchronized with crop N demand. In this study, the sensitivity of the decomposition of Leucaena leucocephala, Senna siamea, and Dactyladenia barteri leaf litter to the nature of the rainfall regime is correlated with the residue quality. The litterbag technique was used to measure decomposition. Four periods of 115 days, each starting at a time when hedgerow trees are normally pruned, were selected and the rain that fell during each of these periods in 1986 was simulated on a day-to-day basis by applying irrigation water on the litterbags. The number of rainfall events was better correlated with the percentage dry matter loss than with the total amount of precipitation. The relationship consisted of two lines. The slope of the first line, indicative of the sensitivity of the decomposition to varying numbers of rainfall events, correlated well with the watersoluble fraction (P<0.05), the C:N ratio (P<0.05), and the polyphenol: N ratio (P<0.01) of the residues. The decomposition process was shown to be dominated by microbial catabolism, rather than leaching. Because the decomposition of the higher quality residues is affected by varying rainfall patterns and because rainfall may often be unpredictable in frequency and intensity, synchronization of N released from a significant part of the decomposing residue with crop N demand may require additional management practices. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Laboratory and nursery studies were carried out to determine the effect of water leachates of A. xanthophloea on the germination of some agricultural and leguminous tree crops to determine compatibility for intercropping in agroforestry systems. Leachates from leaves, bark and litter were applied on seeds of Zea mays (maize), Eleusine coracana (finger millet), Vigna radiata (green gram), Albizia lebbeck, Leucaena leucocephala and A. xanthophloea. The germination of the agricultural crops and of two tree species, Albizia lebbeck and A. xanthophloea, was not inhibited by the leachates. However, the germination of L. leucocephala was significantly inhibited by the bark and litter leachates in the laboratory, but not in sand culture in the nursery. From this study it appears unlikely that A. xanthophloea produces potentially allelopathic substances. -from Authors

AB  - Measures of forest community structure, including species richness and basal area, increased with increasing stand age among a series of five dry forest sites. Species richness of the stands (based on 0.1 ha samples) ranged from eight species at the 35-year-old site to 30 species at the 125-year-old site. A 35-year-old forest on former pastureland contained about one-third of the richness and 27.5% of the basal area of a 50-year-old stand, and had accurred 21.4% of the basal area of a 100-year-old stand of subtropical dry forest. The youngest, most degraded stand was dominated by Leucaena leucocephala, an exotic species. This stand included only seven other native tree species. -from Authors

AB  - Five Karan Swiss crossbred (Sahiwal × Brown Swiss) calves were abruptly switched over from a diet of concentrate and maize fodder to ad libitum air dried Leucaena leucocephala leaves plus twigs. After 17 days on the L. leucocephala diet, 3 of the calves were supplemented with copper sulphate (10 mg/kg DM L. leucocephala) for 12 days. Thereafter all the calves were taken off the L. leucocephala diet and returned to the pre-experimental concentrate and maize fodder diet. While on the L. leucocephala diet, the average DM intake/d of L. leucocephala declined to 497 g within 3 weeks and all calves lost weight. This weight loss was reversed in the 3 calves that received copper sulphate, and all calves gained weight when they resumed the concentrate and maize fodder diet. The toxic effects of L. leucocephala feeding for 24 days were characterised by poor growth, emaciation, alopecia, loss of hair from the tail switch, ear and eye lesions, ulceration of the mouth region, drooling viscid saliva and vomiting of thick green saliva in one of the calves. Mean levels of 3,4 dihydroxypyridone (DHP) (mg/100 ml) were 30·35 ± 13.52 and 55.57 ± 13.77 on days 2 and 4 respectively in rumen liquor and up to 136.01 ± 80·18 in urine. The mean ratios of mimosine: DHP of 3·14, 0·12 and 0·04 in feed, faeces and urine respectively revealed extensive degradation of mimosine to DHP in the calves fed the L. leucocephala diet and it was concluded the calves were unable to tolerate a diet consisting solely of L. leucocephala. © 1994 Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine, University of Edinburgh.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of tree coppicing on tree-crop competition in farmed parkland and in alley farming, both in semiarid Burkina Faso. Azadirachta indica A. Juss (neem) was studied in the parklands, while neem, Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth. (albizia) and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (leucaena) were investigated in the alley farming system. The crop was sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) in both cases. Under non-coppiced neem trees in the parkland, the sorghum yield at 0-3 m distance from the tree (under the tree canopy) was 82% of open field yields at 6-9 m distance, but the difference was not significant (p=0.07). Close to trees (0-3 m distance) which had been coppiced before planting, the sorghum yield was 148% of open field yields. In alley farming, early coppicing was superior; sorghum yields were highest close to trees coppiced early and lowest close to trees coppiced late. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Two concurrent factorial experiments investigated the relative merits of the following management options to maximise liveweight gains in finishing cattle: breed [Hereford (Bos taurus) v. Belmont Red (B. taurus x B. indicus)]; implantation with zeranol; feed energy source (sorghum grain, molasses + urea, tropical grass pastures); feed protein source (sunflower meal, Leucaena leucocephala, tropical pasture legumes). These combinations of treatments were delivered by using nil, intermittent, or continuous grazing systems. Sixty steers of initial liveweight (± s.e) 321 ± 3.6 kg were held on their respective treatments for 77 or 98 days, by which time all except those on pasture without supplement had attained at least 400 kg liveweight. Steers were slaughtered in a commercial abattoir and carcass characteristics recorded. Zeranol-implanted cattle grew faster than untreated (0.84 v. 0.66 kg/day), and there was a trend (P = 0.14) for Belmont Red cattle to grow faster than Herefords (0.83 v. 0.67 kg/day). In all systems, cattle given ad libitum sorghum grain grew significantly (P<0.05) better than those given molasses + urea (1.54-0.65 v. 0.72-0.45 kg/day). The poor performance of molasses-fed cattle was associated with low voluntary feed consumptions. The highest rates of gain (1.54 kg/day) were for penned cattle on a sorghum grain + sunflower ration. The provision of either supplement promoted better gains than that found for unsupplemented steers grazing tropical grass-legume pastures (-0.29 to +0.26 kg/day). However, cattle continuously grazing (10 steers/ha) leucaena-grass pastures and those given sunflower meal had significantly (P<0.05) higher rates of gain (0.82 and 0.91 kg/day, respectively) than cattle given molasses supplements or grazing alone. Cattle given sorghum had higher carcass weights and fat contents than those fed molasses or with grazing alone, although only those in the feedlot had acceptable fat cover at slaughter. There was no significant effect of treatments on the fatty acid composition of subcutaneous fat. © 1995 CSIRO.

AB  - Performance of commonly grown agroforestry woody species was assessed at two locations in S Nigeria, on an Alfisol at Ibadan in the forest-savanna transition zone and on an Ultisol at Onne in the forest zone. The improvement effect of the wood species on soil properties appeared to be more pronounced on the Alfisol than on the Ultisol. Cordia alliodora and Gmelina arborea performed equally well on both sites, but C. alliodora seemed to be more suitable for use in an agroforestry system. Leucaena leucocephala and Pterocarpus soyauxii, which performed better on the Alfisol, were more suitable for use in agroforestry system in this ecozone. Dialium guineense, Irvingia gabonensis, and Treculia africana had more potential for use in agroforestry systems on the Ultisol in the humid forest zone. Fruit productivity in these wild fruit species was found to differ between sites. -from Authors

AB  - The N2-fixing potential (NFP) (i.e. the amount of fixed N2 in a constraint-free environment) of N2-fixing trees (NFTs) varies with the genotype. The NFP can be higher than 30-50 g N2 fixed tree-1 year-1 in the most active species, be they leguminous trees such as Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala, or actinorhizal trees such as Casuarina equisetifolia. The actual amount of nitrogen fixed (ANF) (i.e. the amount of N2 fixed in the field) is lower than the NFP or even nil because of various constraints, especially drought, nutrient deficiencies, excess of available N and pathogenic nematodes. As tree litters are mineralized, the amount of available N in the soil increases with time, this process leading to the cessation of N2 fixation in aging plantations. When the mineralization rate is slowed down or inhibited, N2 fixation can continue. NFTs improve the N status of soils, but the transfer of fixed N to associated plants is not always ensured. Three main approaches are appropriate to increase N2 fixation: clonal selection of trees combined with vegetative propagation, inoculation with effective rhizobium or Frankia strains, and proper fertilization (especially P). In the absence of major environmental constraints, a positive response to inoculation is expected only when specific (non-promiscuous) NFTs are grown in sites where the density of compatible rhizobia is low or nil. The potentialities of NFTs are far from being fully exploited. Further investigations are proposed and the economics of NFT management is briefly discussed. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The pattern of soil moisture changes was studied during a cropping season in an alley cropping experiment of maize with Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia macrophylla at the SADC/ICRAF Agroforestry Research Station in a semiarid region near Lusaka, Zambia (28°29′56″ East and 15°21′32″ South). Soil moisture potential was monitored at regular intervals using tensiometers installed at 15, 30 and 45 cm depths in fertilized and unfertilized alleys within the double hedgerow, and the first, second and third rows of maize in the alleys. Soil moisture moved mostly towards the top horizon during very dry conditions. Alleys that had received a combination of fertilizer and hedgerow prunings depleted more moisture than those that had only hedgerow prunings. There were no differences in moisture utilization pattern between leucaena and flemingia hedgerows. The hedgerows depleted the same amount of moisture as the maize plants. However, during dry conditions, there was a higher soil moisture content under the hedgerows than in maize rows, indicating that there was no apparent competition for moisture between the hedgerows and the maize plants. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Five exotic fast-growing tropical tree species (Racosperma auriculiforme, R. mangium, Eucalyptus urophylla, Cassia siamea, and Leuceana leucocephala) were tested on four different sites in Zaire in order to assess their growth, adaptability, and wood density. The rank of species changed across sites, indicating significant species × environment interactions. Ranking of species for growth and adaptability over all sites was in the following descending order: R. auriculiforme, E. urophylla, R. mangium, C. siamea, L. leucocephala. L. leucocephala was the least adapted species but because of the importance of L. leucocephala in agroforestry systems, it is important to improve the prospects for Leucaena cultivation in Zaire through additional testing to identify and create improved varieties. -from Authors

AB  - A method, based on the negative adsorption of NO2-, has been developed to determine surface area of roots. Young roots of 3-4 year old plants of Acacia catechu, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Leucaena leucocephala were up-rooted and cut into 18 cylindrical pieces. Each root piece was immersed individually for 10 sec in 0.05 M, 0.10 M and 0.15 M aqueous NaNO2 solution and the excess solution on the root surface allowed to drain off. It was then transferred to conical flask containing distilled water and shaken for 15 min for desorption of nitrite. A known quantity of this aliquot was reacted with 1% acidic sulphanilamide and 0.02% NED HCl. A pink colour developed, and its optical density was read at 540 nm. A positive linear correlation was noted between colour density and root surface area. The respective correlation coefficientvalues for 0.05 M, 0.10 M and 0.15 M NaNO2 solutions were 0.973, 0.963 and 0.964 for Acacia catechu, 0.933, 0.903 and 0.898 for Eucalyptus camaldulensis and 0.968, 0.976 and 0.972 for Leucaena leucocephala (significant at p<0.001). The method was successfully adopted to determine the root surface area of seedlings of Albizia lebbek, A. procera, Acacia auriculiformis, A. nilotica, Dalbergia latifolia and D. sissoo. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Glomus aggregatum and Leucaena leucocephala were allowed to interact in a manganese-rich oxisol at pH 4.3-6.0 and at soil P concentrations considered optimal for mycorrhizal host growth and sufficient for nonmycorrhizal host growth. At 0.02 mg P l-1, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (VAMF) colonization of roots increased as soil pH increased from 4.3 to 5.0. However, VAMF colonization of roots did not respond to further increases in pH. At pH 6.0, growth of mycorrhizal Leucaena observed at 0.02 mg P was comparable with that observed at 0.8 mg P l-1. Increasing P concentration from 0.02 to 0.8 mg P 1-1 increased target soil pH from 4.3 to 4.7 and reduced the concentration of available soil Mn from 15.1 to 1.9 mg 1-1. Thus, the normal plant growth observed at the higher P concentration at pH<5 was mainly due to the alleviation of Mn toxicity as a result of its precipitation by excess P. VAMF colonization levels observed at pH 5.0-6.0 were similar, but maximal plant growth occurred at pH 6.0, suggesting that the optimal pH for mycorrhizal formation was substantially lower than for VAMF effectiveness. The poor growth of Leucaena at the lower P concentration in the unlimed soil was largely due to high concentrations of Mn2+ and H+ ions. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In a completely randomized design, 28 Black Bengal goats were assigned to seven types of tree leaves: mander (Erythrina variegata Lamk), sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn.), krishnachura (Dolonix regia Boj ex-Hook), jack fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lamk), ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala Lam.), mango (Mangifera indica I.) and guava (Psidium guajava I.). The duration of the study was 140 days. There were significant differences in dry matter intake between tree leaves, but no significant differences between krishnachura, mango and guava leaves. Animals fed guava leaves lost weight at a rate of 3.9 g/d, whereas ipil-ipil-, jack fruit-, mander-, sal-, krishnachura- and mango-fed goats gained 52.8, 43.9, 33.3, 26.9, 12.1 and 6.4 g/d, respectively, with significant differences (P < 0.01). Tree leaves, such as ipil-ipil, jack fruit, mander and sal, could be used as fodder for Black Bengal goats when 140 g concentrate mixtures were allowed for them. © 1994.

AB  - The growth characteristics, intrinsic antibiotic resistance pattern, utilization of different C sources and symbiotic characteristics of 18 fast-growing rhizobial strains isolated from root nodules of Macroptilium atropurpureum (Siratro) were studied. Colonies on agar at 2-3 days were large, gummy, translucent and spreading (2-4 mm dia) and were acid producing. These strains did not utilize sodium citrate as a sole source of C and were sensitive to low concentrations of chloramphenicol (25 μg ml-1), tetracycline (8 μg ml-1) and streptomycin (12 μg ml-1). The host specificity and effectiveness of these strains on different legume hosts revealed that they are different from other fast-growing strains. All strains failed to nodulate Glycine max (soybean cv. William, Lee and Peking). Sixteen of the isolates nodulated Leucaena leucocephala (ipil-ipil) and all 18 nodulated Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean). The fast-growing strains showed varying degrees of effectiveness in N2 fixation on M. atropurpureum, Vigna mungo (blackgram) and V. unguiculata (cowpea). The isolates formed ineffective symbioses on two genotypes of V. radiata (mungbean). © 1995.

AB  - A study was conducted at Fasola (7°45′ N and 3°5′ E) in southwest Nigeria to determine the best tree cutting scheme for forage production and the effects of hedge configurations on tree, grass and total forage productivity of 6-8-year-old leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam. de Wit) and gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium Walp.)-Guinea grass (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Ntchisi) mixture. After a uniform cut at the end of January 1990 (mid-dry season), the trees were cut according to the following cutting regimes: one cut after a 12-month regrowth (12M); two cuts after three- and nine-month regrowth (3-9M); two cuts every six months (6-6M); two cuts after nine- and three-month regrowth (9-3M); three cuts, two cuts every three months and the third cut after a six-month regrowth (3-3-6M), and four cuts every three months (3-3-3-3M). Grass was cut every six weeks between April and October followed by a cut in January. The hedge configuration was either one or three hedgerows of mixed stands of leucaena and gliricidia. There were twice as many trees and one-third less grass in the triple than in the single hedgerow hedge configuration. The 3-3-3-3M, 9-3M and 3-3-6M cutting regimes produced the highest total forage (tree foliage + grass) dry matter yields (DM) of 6.54, 5.80 and 5.77 t DM ha-1 annum-1, respectively. The magnitude of the difference between the tree forage yields of the triple and single hedgerow plots (16%) did not reflect the theoretical difference in the number of trees (33%) in the two arrangements. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - During the period February to July 1992 the incidence of attacks by insect pests on ten cultivated browse species was studied at Obio Akpa, located in humid southeastern Nigeria. Two of the browse species Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala were exotic and eight Alchornia cordifolia, Baphia nitida, Rauvolfia vomitoria, Diallum guineensis, Ficus capensis, Glyphaea brevis, Homalium aylmeri and Manniophytum fulvum indigenous. Forty insect pests were collected and 33 identified. Those identified belonged to either the order Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Lepidoptera or Orthoptera. Some of the insects were browse-specific, while others attacked several browse species. None of the browse species was free from insect attacks. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Phytogeographical, morphological, and molecular evidence for the widespread but sporadic occurrence of sterile hybrids between Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata and L. esculenta subsp. esculenta in South-Central Mexico is presented. Most morphological and DNA characters studied in the putative hybrids showed states intermediate between the proposed parental taxa. The occurrence of non-additive nuclear ribosomal DNA phenotypes is discussed and the need to use a suite of nuclear taxon-specific markers to determine hybridity is emphasized. The origin of the hybrid is discussed in relation to the disruption of the distributions of both parental taxa through use by man as minor food plants, providing another example of the important influence of human interference on the evolution of Leucaena. The successful use of dried leaf material as a source of DNA is highlighted as an efficient way to identify sterile hybrids at the molecular level. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The response of corn (Zea mays) to incorporated leaf and twig mulches of Leucaena leucophala, Gliricidia sepium and Cassia siamea, and Grevillea robusta as a non-legume comparison was investigated in a 10-week pot trial and a concurrent soil incubation study to evaluate the suitability of various agroforestry trees as mulch sources. Leucaena contributed to the highest N uptake and biomass production of these corn plants, reflecting the benefits of organic mulching. Cassia-treated plants also performed better than the unmulched controls, but Grevillea incorporation suppressed corn growth probably because of the relatively high Mn status of this mulch. Manganese toxicity was confirmed by comparative vector diagnosis of plant nutrient status. Cliricidia mulching resulted in seedling mortality after germination possibly from high soil pH and ammonium toxicity. Mineral N production in mulched soils during the laboratory incubation was well correlated with N uptake in corn shoots. The results suggest that the nutritional effects of agroforestry tree mulches on growth of companion crops may be effectively screened by a combined soil test, pot trial, and plant analysis approach. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

PY  - 1994
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84972014760&doi=10.1017%2fS0003356100007728&partnerID=40&md5=11c4126fe65d2efe8c101b292ba59d8e
AB  - Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of supplementation with fodder tree leaves on the utilization of teff straw. This ivas aimed at testing the hypothesis that forage supplements (e.g. sesbania) that disappear faster from the rumen compared with those that disappear slowly (eg. leucaena) may elicit higher intakes of the basal diet. Experiment 1 investigated the effect of level (i.e. 0,200,300 and 400 g/kg dry matter (DM) intake) of leaves of Sesbania sesban or Leucaena leucocephala on the utilization of teff straw fed ad libitum. Seven sheep were given the seven diets in four periods following a partially balanced (7 × 4) cross-over design. In experiment 2, teff straw alone or supplemented with graded levels of sesbania (250, 350 and 450 g/kg DM intake), were fed to 16 sheep in a completely randomized block design. Intake, degradability, nitrogen (N) utilization, particulate and liquid passage rates were estimated. In experiment 1, protein source × protein level interaction was not significant. Supplementation increased intakes of total DM (P < 0-05), organic matter (P < 0·01) and N retention (P < 0·01) but had no effect on the intake of teff straw. Supplementation with sesbania, but not with leucaena, increased (P < 0·05) the apparent digestibility of DM. Both supplements increased (P < 0·05) the fractional rate of passage from the rumen. In experiment 2, graded levels of sesbania increased DM intake (P < 0·05), fractional rate of liquid outflow (P< 0·05) and tended to increase the rate of degradation. It was concluded that the effect of fodder tree leaves on roughage intake is a function of their disappearance rate from the rumen. © 1994, British Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Growth data for three promising tropical hardwoods, Eucalyptus grandis, E. saligna and Leucaena leucocephala, from field trials in Hawaii were analyzed to determine relationships between yield and soil, climatic, and management variables. Species- and site-specific regression models were developed that feature growth age, planting density, nitrogen fertilizer application, temperature, rainfall and solar radiation, soil nitrogen content and pH value, and elevation as independent variables. Each of these models was then incorporated into a system model for estimating short-rotation intensive-culture (SRIC) woody biomass production costs, including establishment, maintenance, harvesting, transport and storage costs. By coupling the system model results with a geographical information system, yield (dry Mg) and delivered cost of biomass (US$ dry Mg-1) were estimated for each species at all locations identified as potentially available for tree plantations on the islands of Kauai, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. © 1994.

AB  - Callus was induced from various explants of Leucaena leucocephala, a fast growing, multipurpose, leguminous tree species. Callus obtained from hypocotyl segments showed high morphogenetic potential. Caulogenesis was achieved on B5 medium supplemented with 6-benzylamino purine. Presence of α-naphthaleneacetic acid in the medium promoted 6-benzylamino purine induced caulogenesis. Callus obtained from hypocotyl segments retained the capacity to produce shoots upon subculturing even after four months from induction. The shoots obtained from callus were transferred to auxin containing media for rooting. Good root induction was achieved in the presence of 10-6M 3-indolebutyric acid. Various morphologically distinct somaclonal variants were exposed to high concentrations of carbon dioxide. Somaclonal variants capable of growing well in the presence of high levels of carbon dioxide were selected. The majority of such variants were found to have high carbon dioxide assimilating capacity (as indicated by infra red gas analysis). Simultaneously methods were standardised for rapid multiplication of Leucaena leucocephala through apical bud and nodal cultures. Best apical bud and axillary bud sprouting was achieved on B5 medium supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine. Subsequent to multiplication, the efficient carbon dioxide assimilating variants can be used for afforestation and reforestation purposes in barren lands. This is likely to be one of the best methods, that can be employed safely, for alleviating the problem of global warming. © 1995.

AB  - Rhizobia were isolated from two Kenyan soils with pHs of 4.5 and 6.8 and characterized on the basis of their host ranges for nodulation and nitrogen fixation, colony morphologies, restriction fragment fingerprints, find hybridization with a nifH probe. The populations of rhizobia nodulating Phaseolus vulgaris in the two soils were similar in numbers and in effectiveness of N2 fixation but were markedly different in composition. The population in the Naivasha soil (pH 6.8) was dominated by isolates specific in host range for nodulation to P. vulgaris; these all had multiple copies, in most cases four, of the structural nitrogenase gene nifH. Only one of the isolates from this soil formed effective nodules on Leucaena leucocephala, and this isolate had only a single copy of nifH. By contrast, the population in the acid Daka-ini soil (pH 4.5) was composed largely of broad-host-range isolates which had single copies of nifH. The isolates from the Daka-ini soil which were specific to P. vulgaris generally had three copies of nifH, although one isolate had only two copies. These rhizobial isolates are indigenous to Kenyan soils and yet have marked similarities to previously described Rhizobium species from other continents.

AB  - The effect of 16 plant species used in traditional medicine in the Ica Department of Peru was evaluated towards the enzymes xanthine oxidase (XO) and β-glucuronidase (β-gluc) in vitro as well as for their ability to bind to DNA and to reduce tumor proliferation in the potato disc test. P. chingoyo, L. leucocephala and P. odoratissimum inhibited the XO with IC50 of 8-12 μg crude extract/ml. Most extracts were active towards the β-gluc; this inhibition, however, can be of unspecific type. A. peruviana, P. chingoyo, T. integrifolia and S. riparius extracts, at 0.5 mg/ml, reduced by >50% the area of the DNA peak in the HPLC assay, suggesting the presence of DNA-binding compounds. Good correlation was observed between the DNA binding activity and the reduction of tumors in potato discs test.

AB  - The leucaena psyllid, Heteropsylla cubana Crawford, can devastate plantings of Leucaena leucocephala (Leguminosae), an economically important tree species in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, Australia, India, Africa, and elsewhere. The predatory beetle, Curinus coeruleus Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), has been introduced into many of these areas from Hawaii for biological control of the psyllid. In this study, collections of C. coeruleus were made from 11 populations on four islands in the Hawaiian archipelago to determine population structure and estimate levels of gene flow. Over all populations, a measure of population subdivision, theta;, was 0.095, and the estimate of N, m, the average migration rate, was 2.4. theta; values for the individual islands were 0.02, 0.12, 0.24 and 0.05 for Kauai, Hawaii, Maui, and Oahu, respectively. Estimated levels of gene flow between populations were not correlated with geographic distance, therefore isolation by distance does not appear to be an important process structuring C. coerulevs populations. Gene flow estimates can be used to characterize dispersal capabilities in insects or other organisms released for biological control. In this case, the inferior dispersal ability of C. coeruleus likely limits its rapid widespread establishment during release programmes.

AB  - The influence of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi on rhizosphere mycoflora was studied together with the possible mechanism involved in this process. Six combinations of VAM fungi and phosphorus fertilizer treatments were applied to Leucaena leucocephala roots and quantitative and qualitative observations were made periodically of the rhizosphere mycoflora and constituents of root exudates. The results obtained indicate that the presence of specific mycoflora in the rhizosphere of mycrorrhizal roots is mediated through root exudates rather than being an outcome of improved P nutrition. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Soil microarthropod populations in maize plots mulched with the prunings of three woody agroforestry plant residues (Acioa barteri, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala) and two crop residues [maize (Zea mays) stover (leaves and stems) and rice (Oryza sativa) straw] were monitored throughout the 1991 growing season and compared with those in fallow, bare fallow and unmulched control plots with three rates of nitrogen application. The mean densities of detritivore and phytophage microarthropods in the experimental plots decreased in the following order: rice straw > Gliricidia prunings > Leucaena prunings > maize stover > Acioa prunings > control 2 (90 kg N ha-1 year-1) > fallow > control 3 (135 N) > control 1 (45N) > bare fallow. Mulching also affected the population dynamics of predatory microarthropods and omnivorous ants. The chemical composition of plant residues probably influenced the densities of detritivore and phytophage microarthropods, which in addition were also greatly influenced by microclimatic conditons imposed by vegetation cover. Extremely low densities of microarthropods were recorded in the bare fallow plots probably as a result of the combined effects of absence of plant residues and vegetation cover. The potential of mulching as a component of farming practice for increasing the density of microarthropods and for influencing their species composition and population dynamics in agroecosystems is discussed. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Four shrubs, viz. Hibiscus tiliaceus, Leucaena leucocephala, Vitex negundo and Sesbania sesban, were evaluated for their performance as firewood crops in coppiced stands of varying cutting heights (15, 30 and 45 cm) in repeated annual harvests (4) on alkaline soils of the North Indian plains. The dry wood yield of Leucaena and Sesbania ranged between 22.9-42.6 and 9.9-18.0 tonnes ha-1 year-1, respectively. Leucaena showed progressive increases in yield from coppiced stumps up to the 4th harvest while Sesbania showed a reduction after the third harvest mainly due to the high degeneration (60%) of coppiced stumps. Degeneration was low (<10%) in Leucaena and Vitex. The coppicing heights generally did not show any significant effect on the growth and productivity. The number of coppice shoots per stump increased with stump height and production of coppice shoots was maximum in Vitex and minimum in Leucaena. The average diameter of coppice shoots tended to decrease with increasing coppicing height of the stumps. © 1996.

Acacia mangium, Acacia auriculiformis, Cassia siamea, Calliandra calothyrsus and Paraserianthes falcataria established well, when compared to Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Dialum guineense, Dubocia macrocarpa and Milicia excelsa. A. mangium, A. auriculiformis, C. calothyrsus, C. siamea and P. falcataria produced the highest leaf (4 to 20 t ha-1) and wood (12 to 37 t ha-1) biomass yield (primary growth) at one to three years after planting. Coppicing percentage of A. mangium A. auriculiformis and P. falcataria were relatively low (35 to 50%). C. calothyrsus and C. siamea showed the highest coppicing percentage (95 to 100%) and produced the greatest coppice biomass (9 to 13 t ha-1). Total nitrogen and organic matter percentage of soils from under the stands of these two species were also significantly higher than that of the rest. The two species may thus be considered for use in agroforestry technologies for soil improvement on acid soils, which are typical of the moist tropics. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Yields under alley cropping might be improved if the most limiting nutrients not adequately supplied or cycled by the leaves could be added as an inorganic fertilizer supplement. Three historic leaf management strategies had been in effect for 3 years in a Leucaena leucocephala alley cropping trial on the Lilongwe Plain of central Malawi: 1) leaves returned; 2) leaves removed; and 3) leaves removed, with 100 kg inorganic N ha-1 added. An initial soil analysis showed P status to be suboptimal under all strategies. A confounded 34 factorial experiment was conducted with the following treatments: leaf management strategy (as above), N fertilizer rate (0, 30, and 60 kg N ha-1), p fertilizer rate (0, 18, and 35 kg P ha-1), and maize population (14,800, 29,600, and 44,400 plants ha-1). Both N and P were yield limiting, and interacted positively to improve yields. The addition of 30 kg N and 18 kg P ha-1 improved yields similarly under all leaf management strategies by an average of 2440 kg ha-1. Increasing the rates to 60 kg N and 35 kg P ha-1 improved yields an additional 1990 kg ha-1 in the 'leaves returned' and 'leaves removed + N' strategies, but did not improve yields under the 'leaves removed' strategy. Lower yields were related to lack of P response at the highest P rate in this treatment, which may have induced Zn deficiency. Plots receiving leaves had higher organic C, total N, pH, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, and S, and lower C/N ratios in the 0-15 cm soil layer than did plots where leaves had been removed. Leaf removal with N addition was similar to leaf removal alone for all soil factors measured except for organic C and total N, which were higher where N had been added. The results show that N and P were the primary yield-limiting nutrients. Historic N application maintained the soil's ability to respond to N and P on par with leaf additions.

AB  - The present study estimates above-ground biomass and net primary productivity in high density ('energy') plantations of three important species raised at Hisar (29 °10′N, 75 °46′E, 215 m.a.s.l.) in arid India. In 4-year-old plantations, with initial plant spacing of 0·6 × 0·6 m (which is generally used for production of fuelwood), Leucaena leucocephala showed fairly high net primary productivity (33 t ha-1 year-1) closely followed by Eucalyptus tereticornis (29 t ha-1 year-1). In both species, the values were about two-fold higher than Acacia nilotica. Of the total net primary productivity, 23 to 27% returned to the soil as litterfall. The standing biomass after 4 years was 112 t ha-1 in L. leucocephala, 96 t ha-1 in E.tereticomis and 52 t ha-1 in A.nilotica. In 8-year-old plantations with initial spacing of 2 × 2 m (which is generally used for small timber and fuelwood), the net primary productivity was 25 t ha-1 year-1 in L. leucocephala, 21 t ha-1 year-1 in E.tereticomis and 14 t ha-1 year-1 in A. nilotica; and 38 to 45% of it was returned to the soil as litterfall. After 8 years of growth, biomass was 126 t ha-1 in L. leucocephala, 102 t ha-1 in E. tereticomis and 77 t ha-1 in A.nilotica. The plantations have a high potential for the production of biomass. © 1995 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - Glomus aggregatum and Leucaena leucocephala were interacted in an acid Mn-rich oxisol unamended or amended with lime [Ca(OH)2] or gypsum (CaSO4) at soil P concentrations considered optimal for mycorrhizal host growth and sufficient for mycorrhiza-free growth. At 0.02 mg P 1-1, both vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (VAMF) colonization and function were significantly curtailed if soil was not amended with gypsum or lime. The highest mycorrhizal effect was observed in the limed soil, followed by the soil treated with gypsum at the rate of 32 g Ca kg-1 soil. Higher concentrations of gypsum deleteriously affected VAMF infectivity and effectivity. The first increment of gypsum compensated completely for the VAMF colonization and for part of the mycorrhizal effect that was lost due to low pH. The superiority of the limed soil to that amended with gypsum apparently lies in the fact that Ca supply was assured in the former and also that the adverse effects of toxic constituents such as H+ and Mn2+ were eliminated. We were unable to separate the effect of Ca on VAMF from its effect on the host because a P concentration sufficient for mycorrhiza-free growth was not attained due to interaction of some of the P with Ca to form insoluble phosphate. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Twelve accessions of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan [L.] Millsp.) were grown on an Alfisol in a humid ecozone in Nigeria in 1989. At 4 and 8 months after planting (MAP), the primary growth was cut to determine the effect of age at first pruning on stump survival and coppice regrowth, and also on total herbage yield in a 12-month pruning cycle. It was clear that a height of 3 m or more is adequate for pigeonpea to receive its first cut with only 10 % stool mortalities. Cutting the primary shoot at 8 MAP (in the dry season) ensured greater stump survival and also stimulated rapid coppice shoot regrowth, indicating the advantage of coppicing in the dry season and also at maturity. The total leaf and wood dry matter (DM) production in a 12-month cycle is greatest if the primary shoot was first cut at 8 MAP. This suggests that allowing the trees to become established is beneficial in the pruning management of pigeonpea. Accessions 11563 and 11575 have the ability to produce 7 t/ha of leaf DM from two prunings when first cut at 8 MAP, and significantly outperformed the local variety. The study revealed that pigeonpea does not coppice well and its biomass yields are much lower than that of Leucaena leucocephala. © 1995, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Establishment of Leucaena leucocephala was poor at Ibadan (Transition forest-savanna zone) and Fashola (savanna zone, 70 km north of Ibadan) in southwestern Nigeria as a result of low soil fertility and the presence of only a few native rhizobia capable of nodulating it. Inoculation with L. leucocephala at these two locations in 1982 resulted in striking responses with Rhizobium strains IRc 1045 and IRc 1050 isolated from L. leucocephala grown in Nigeria. The persistence of inoculated effective Rhizobium strains after inoculation is desirable since it removes the need for reinoculation. Because of the perennial nature of L. leucocephala and its use in long-term alley farming experiments, we examined the persistence of inoculated rhizobial strains after inoculation, and their ability to sustain N2-fixation and biomass production at Ibadan. In 1992, ten years after Rhizobium introduction, uninoculated, L. leucocephala fixed about 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 or about 41% of total plant N compared to 180 kg N ha-1 yr-1 or 43% measured in 1982. Serological typing of the nodules using the Enzyme-Linked-Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and intrinsic resistance to the streptomycin test revealed that most of the nodules (96%) formed on L. leucocephala in 1992 were by Rhizobium strains IRc 1045 and IRc 1050, which were inoculated in 1982. Nodules were absent on uninoculated L. leucocephala grown on the adjacent field with no history of L. leucocephala cultivation. We conclude that the N2 fixed by Rhizobium strains IRc 1045 and IRc 1050 persisted for many years in the absence of L. leucocephala and sustained effectively fixed N2 which growth and yield of L. leucocephala after several years, thus encouraging a possible low-input alley farming system by smallholder farmers in Nigeria. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Results from farmer evaluations of exploratory on-farm trials with hedgerow inter-cropping in a semi-arid region of Kenya (the Yatta Plateau of Machakos District) are presented. Hedgerows of Cassia siamea, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala, which were managed by eight farmers to enhance soil fertility, were established in the mid-1980s. Although trial farmers appear convinced of the ability of the technology to increase crop yields, reduce erosion and provide firewood, most did not feel that the short-term risks (i.e. reduction in crop productivity) and the extra labour required were worth the long-term benefits. Hence, few of the eight farmers were willing to extend their hedges. The discussion suggests that in the risky production environment of the Yatta Plateau, where crop yields fluctuate constantly with the amount of rainfall, soil fertility is not of urgent concern to farmers. A participatory case study approach, which emphasizes farmers' opinions, preferences and ideas elicited through regular farmer evaluation exercises, as distinct from on-farm technology testing for validation, is recommended for on-farm research on new and complex agroforestry technologies. This approach permits between understanding of some of the complex socio-economic factors affecting the adoption of hedgerow intercropping and is the most cost-effective way to gather in-depth and contextual information on farmer decision-making and management of externally introduced agroforestry technologies. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The effects of five agroforestry woody species (Dactyladenia barteri, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Senna siamea and Treculia africana) on the surface aasting activity of Hyperiodrilus africanus were studied in an Alfisol (Oxic Paleustalf) in southwestern Nigeria. Casting activity under the woody species decreased in the following order:Dactyladenia sp. (26.4 Mg ha-1 year-1)>Gliricidia sp. (24.4 Mg ha-1 year-1)>Treculia sp. (22.9 Mg ha-1 year-1)>Leucaena sp. (18.6 Mg ha-1 year-1)>Senna sp. (18.3 Mg ha-1 year-1). These differences in casting activity were partly explained by microclimatic effects. Irrespective of the woody species, the worm casts were higher in clay and silt contents, bulk density, water-stable aggregates, pH, organic C, exchangeable cations, effective cation exchange capacity, and extractable P levels than the corresponding surface soils. The woody species did affect the physicochemical properties and P sorption of the worm casts. The content of water-stable aggregates of worm casts decreased in the following order:Dactyladenia sp.>Treculia sp.>Senna sp.>Leucaena sp.>Gliricidia sp. Large differences in extractable P levels were observed. Senna sp. was associated with the highest extractable P level (11.5 mg kg-1) and Treculia sp. the lowest (4.9 mg kg-1). P sorption was highest on worm casts under Dactyladenia sp. and lowest on those under Treculia sp. Without fertilizer application, there were no significant differences in the dry weight of maize grown in the different worm casts. With NPK applications, the dry weight of maize grown in worm casts associated with Treculia sp. was significantly lower than that of maize grown in the other worm casts, mainly due to the low extractable P level. Despite a high organic C and exchangeable K status, maize grown in the worm casts still responded significantly to N and K applications. The N uptake by maize grown in worm casts associated with Treculia sp. was lower than that in the other treatments. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Alley cropping is being widely tested in the tropics for its potential to sustain adequate food production with low agricultural inputs, while conserving the resource base. Fast growth and N yield of most trees used as hedgerows in alley cropping is due greatly to their ability to fix N2 symbiotically with Rhizobium. Measurements of biological N2 fixation (BNF) in alley cropping systems show that some tree species such as Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Acacia mangium can derive between 100 and 300 kg N ha-1 yr-1 from atmospheric N2, while species such as Faidherbia albida and Acacia senegal might fix less than 20 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Other tree species such as Senna siamea and S. spectabilis are also used in alley cropping, although they do not nodulate and therefore do not fix N2. The long-term evaluation of the potential or actual amounts of N2 fixed in trees however, poses problems that are associated with their perennial nature and massive size, the great difficulty in obtaining representative samples and applying reliable methodologies for measuring N2 fixed. Strategies for obtaining representative samples (as against the whole tree or destructive plant sampling), the application of 15N procedures and the selection criteria for appropriate reference plants have been discussed. Little is known about the effect of environmental factors and management practices such as tree cutting or pruning and residue management on BNF and eventually their N contribution in alley cropping. Data using the 15N labelling techniques have indicated that up to 50% or more of the tree's N may be below ground after pruning. In this case, quantification of N2 fixed that disregards roots, nodules and crowns would result in serious errors and the amount of N2 fixed may be largely underestimated. Large quantities of N are harvested with hedgerow prunings (>300 kg N ha-1 yr-1) but N contribution to crops is commonly in the range of 40-70 kg N ha-1 season. This represents about 30% of N applied as prunings; however, N recoveries as low as 5-10% have been reported. The low N recovery in maize (Zea mays) is partly caused by lack of synchronization between the hedgerow trees N release and the associated food crop N demand. The N not taken up by the associated crop can be immobilized in soil organic matter or assimilated by the hedgerow trees and thus remain in the system. This N can also be lost from the system through denitrification, volatilization or is leached beyond the rooting zone. Below ground contribution (from root turnover and nodule decay) to an associated food crop in alley cropping is estimated at about 25-102 kg N ha-1 season-1. Timing and severity of pruning may allow for some management of underground transfer of fixed N2 to associated crops. However many aspects of root dynamics in alley cropping systems are poorly understood. Current research projects based on 15N labelling techniques or 15N natural abundance measurements are outlined. These would lead to estimates of N2 fixation and N saving resulting from the management of N2 fixation in alley cropping systems. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

The number and dry weights of nodules were increased by two to three and 13 to 25 times, respectively, over the control which received no S and P. Applying P at 7.5 mg/kg soil significantly increased number and dry weight of nodules by 151% and 575%, respectively, and shoot height by 14% over the control, but had no effect on root growth.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a leguminous, deep rooting tree, increasingly utilized in “Low Input” mixed cultures under arid conditions to reduce mineral N requirements and to improve nutrient cycling. This work was carried out to evaluate the growth and N yield of Leucaena and Maize in sand culture with low (0,6 mM) nitrogen supply under saline conditions (NaCl; NaCl + CaCl2; NaCl + CaSO4). While the low N nutrient solution failed to sustain maize growth in monoculture, both Leucaena and maize grew well in mixed culture with considerable N yields suggesting significant transfer of N from Leucaena to maize. NaCl depressed the uptake of Ca and S and reduced growth and N yields of both crop species. CaSO4 counteracted partly the NaCl‐effects. Copyright © 1995 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - A total of 157 New Zealand White rabbits were used in three separate experiments to determine the performance of growing rabbits which received leaves of the browse plants -Gliricidia sepium andLeucaena leucocephala as green feeds. Feeding of gliricidia allowed for the daily consumption of 65.1 g of pelleted concentrates and this was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the pellet intake of 52.7 g for the leucaena-fed rabbits. On a dry matter basis rabbits consumed 7.17 g of leucaena leaves or 5.86 g of gliricidia leaves daily, suggesting that leucaena was more palatable. In all the studies the daily rates of gain ranged from 18.1 to 21.2 g for the gliricidia-fed rabbits and from 13.5 to 14.3 g for the leucaena-fed rabbits. The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The feed/gain ratio of 3.07 for the gliricidia-fed rabbits was significantly (P < 0.01) higher than the value of 3.91 for the leucaena-fed rabbits. Leucaena-fed rabbits produced reddish-brown urine and showed serious loss of hair. They also had very dark and tender liver which had a lower % (2.72%) of body weight when compared with 3.06% for the gliricidia-fed rabbits and 2.94% for the rabbits which received no green feed. Histological examination showed that kidneys and livers of rabbits which received no green feed had normal and well preserved architecture. Kidneys of leucaena-fed rabbits showed serious degenerative changes in the tubules while the gliricidia-fed rabbits had mild degenerative changes of the tubules. The livers of the leucaena-fed rabbits showed a dense chronic inflammatory reaction in the portal tracts. The livers of the gliricidia-fed rabbits had relatively well preserved architecture. The degenerative effects noted in the livers and kidneys of leucaena-fed rabbits as well as the poor performance of these rabbits may be attributed to mimosine. The results suggested that gliricidia is a better green feed than leucaena for rabbits. It is recommended that leucaena should not constitute more than 50% of the green feed given to rabbits (or more than 7% of the feed dry matter). © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tethering goats on marginal lands is a common practice in many countries but may result in BW loss during the dry season. To test an alternative system, groups of six young male Landim × French Alpine goats (12 kg BW average) were tethered daily for 6 h on native pasture or free-ranged for 24 h on a cultivated pasture which incorporated herbaceous grasses and legumes as well as Leucaena leucocephala rows. The trial started late in the wet season and ended early in the wet season of the following year, and was repeated during a second year with the addition of a tethered treatment receiving supplementation of L. leucocephala leaves at 2% BW (dry matter basis). Average daily gains were higher (P < 0.05) on cultivated pasture, (70 g day-1 and 51 g day-1 in Years 1 and 2) compared with tethered animals (31 g day-1 and 24 g day-1 in Years 1 and 2). Gains in the second year for tethered/supplemented animals were intermediate (38 g day-1; P < 0.05). Carcass, as percent BW at slaughter, was highest (P < 0.05) for cultivated pastures, 47.4%, versus 40.2% for tethered animals and 40.7% for tethered/supplemented animals the second year. It was concluded that free-ranging, 24 h grazing on a cultivated pasture can be a sustainable, low-input alternative which can avoid animal BW loss during the dry season. © 1995.

AB  - Kraft pulp from Leucaena leucocephala with a kappa number of 28 was oxygen delignified and then bleached using two sequences, one employing chlorine and the other chlorine dioxide (clo2), followed by oxidative extraction with hydrogen peroxide. The pulp could be readily bleached to a brightness level of 80% ISO using both sequences. When compared to Eucalyptus, bleachability was achieved more readily for the eucalyptus pulp. With the current environmental concern for pollution, a bleaching sequence utilizing chlorine dioxide is recommended instead of a sequence employing chlorine as it will significantly reduce effluent load in the waste treatment plant. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

All share the capacity to nodulate Phaseolus vulgaris L., the common bean. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that these strains are of two different chromosomal lineages. We defined the host ranges of two strains of Rhizobium etli and three strains of R. tropici, comparing them with those of the two most divergently related new strains. Twenty-two of the 43 tested legume species were nodulated by three or more of these strains. All seven strains have broad host ranges that include woody species such as Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia maculata, and Leucaena leucocephala.

AB  - In vitro gas production, dry matter and nitrogen degradabilities of fresh and sun-dried foliages of four fodder trees (FTs) (Sesbania sesban, Leucaena leucocephala, Chamaecytisus palmensis (tagasaste), Vernonia amygdalina) and of teff straw were estimated. In Experiment 1, feed samples were incubated in three different rumen environments (ecologies) created by feeding sheep the following: teff straw, teff straw + 174 g dry matter (DM) of sesbania and teff straw + 167 g DM of leucaena. In Experiment 2, different rumen ecologies were created by feeding teff straw supplemented with 119, 178 or 232 g DM day-1 of sesbania or with 117, 175 or 232 g DM day-1 of leucaena. Gas production constants were estimated following the equation: GP = B(1 - e-Ct) where GP is gas produced at time t, B is potential gas production and C is the rate of gas production at time t. Rumen fluid was sampled at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h after feeding in Experiment 2 and pH, NH3-N, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and minerals determined. Plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) concentrations were estimated in blood taken from the sheep at 3, 6, 9 and 12 h. Drying relatively increased the neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and NDF-nitrogen concentrations in all foliages except in leucaena. Dry sesbania, tagasaste and vernonia had lower nitrogen concentrations than the fresh ones but the opposite trend was observed for leucaena. Dry matter disappearance (DD) at incubation times of 3-48 h and degradation constants differed among the four foliages (P<0.05). Compared with the other foliages, sesbania had lower fibre fractions and degraded faster. Drying of foliages reduced degradability. Supplementation did not affect (P>0.05) the DD of fresh foliages but enhanced (P<0.05) the rate of DD of dry foliages. There was no feed type × rumen ecology interaction (P>0.05) for either dry or fresh foliages. The rate of teff straw degradation in sheep fed supplemented diets was increased (P<0.06). Gas production was lower in dry than in fresh foliage. Gas production values (ml per 200 mg DM) for dry foliages were: sesbania, 55.5; tagasaste, 54.5; vernonia, 49.5; leucaena, 45. Corresponding values for fresh foliages were: tagasaste, 81.8; sesbania, 62.7; leucaena, 51.1; vernonia, 51. The rates of gas production (h-1) were highest for dry tagasaste (0.0779), followed by sesbania (0.0718), leucaena (0.0563) and vernonia (0.0477). Corresponding values for fresh foliages were: leucaena, 0.0541; tagasaste, 0.0528; sesbania, 0.0478; vernonia, 0.0366. Supplementation increased levels of all rumen metabolites measured. Rumen NH3-N was highly correlated (r=0.88; P<0.05) with PUN. Correlations among the other metabolites were either low or negative. The results are discussed in relation to the chemical composition, type and form of fodder tree and the rumen ecology resulting from feeding these foliages. © 1995.

AB  - The nutrient budget in soil and vegetation, and the rates of nutrient recycling in high density ('energy') plantations in arid climate of north-western India (29°10′N latitude, 75°46′E longitude, 215 m.a.s.l.) were estimated. The amounts of nutrients were highest in the vegetation of 4-year-old stand of Leucaena leucocephala: N, 1159; P, 62; K, 563; Ca, 478 and Mg, 134 kg ha−1; the values were two-fold greater than the stand of Acacia nilotica and three-fold higher than that of Eucalyptus tereticornis. Leaves had the highest concentrations of nutrients followed by fruit and bark. Maximum amounts of nutrients were stored in the branches of A. nilotica and L. leucocephala, and in boles of E. tereticornis. The transfer of nutrients through litterfall in the stand of L. leucocephala was significantly (p<0.05) higher than in the remaining two species. In 8-year-old stands, nutrient contents in vegetation and their recycling rates through litterfall increased markedly, while rates of nutrients accumulated as the vegetation decreased. The enrichment quotients of vegetation were maximum for N, P and Mg in L. leucocephala and for K and Ca in E. tereticornis. Greater quantities of nutrients in the stands were in the soil compartment except phosphorus. Soil phosphorus may become a limiting factor in maintaining high productivity in subsequent rotations because boles and branches are completely removed from the ecosystem. The results are important in soil fertility in short-rotation energy plantations in arid climates. © 1995 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - Changes in soil chemical properties under natural bush regrowth, planted fallows (i.e. Guinea grass (Panicum maximum), Leucaena leucocephala, and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan)) and under continuous cropping with minimum tillage (i.e. maize (Zea mays L.)/cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) intercrop and maize monoculture with residue returned or removed), were monitored for 13 years after clearing of secondary forest on a kaolinitic Alfisol in Nigeria, West Africa. Under bush fallow, soil organic C (SOC) decreased during the first 7 years, then increased to the original level of approximately 20 g kg-1 at 12 years, whereas soil pH, exchangeable Ca and Mg and ECEC remained relatively constant. Chemical soil properties under Guinea grass and leucaena fallows compared favorably to those under bush fallow, whereas chemical properties of the surface soil under pigeon pea fallow deteriorated. Under continuous maize cropping, soil organic C decreased during the first 7 years, then reached a steady-state at about 65% of the level maintained by bush fallow. The surface soil under continuous maize also became acidified. Maize grain yields of the first season declined from 6.0 t ha-1 to 2.5 t ha-1 during 7 years of cropping. Relative yield sustainability of the three cropping systems was maize/cassava intercrop > maize monoculture with residue returned > maize monoculture with residue removed. © 1995.

AB  - Abstract.  Patterns of understory colonization by native and naturalized trees and shrubs were evaluated in 4.5‐year‐old plantations of three exotic tree species, Casuarina equisetifolia, Eucalyptus robusta, and Leucaena leucocephala, on a degraded coastal grassland site with reference to overstory composition and understory environmental conditions. 19 secondary forest species were established in the plantation understories (with a total area of 0.52 ha), while no natural regeneration occurred in unplanted, though protected, control areas. The majority of these species (90 %) and the total seedling population (97 %) were zoochorous, indicating the importance of frugivorous bats and particularly birds as facilitators of secondary forest species colonization. Understory species richness and seedling densities were affected significantly by overstory composition, the most abundant regeneration occurring beneath Leucaena and least under Casuarina. Understory colonization rates within mixed‐species stands were intermediate between those of single‐species stands of the trees comprising their overstories. Significant negative correlations were found between understory species richness and seedling density, and forest floor depth and dry mass, especially for small‐seeded ornithochorous species. Higher colonization rates near the peripheries of plantation plots relative to plot interiors were due in part to roosting site preferences by frugivores, particularly bats. The study results indicate that overstory species selection can exert a significant influence on subsequent patterns of colonization by secondary forest species and is an important consideration in the design of plantations for ‘catalyzing’ succession on deforested, degraded sites. 1995 IAVS ‐ the International Association of Vegetation Science

AB  - Fifteen leguminous browse plants harvested in SW Nigeria were evaluated with respect to their proximate chemical composition, mineral (trace and major) content, phytin, phytin-phosphorus and oxalate constituents. There were distinct variations in the proximate composition of all the materials. For example, crude protein ranged from 5.54 g (100 g)-1 dry matter (DM) in Acacia auriculata to 25.27 g (100 g)-1 DM in Leucaena leucocephala, and crude fibre ranged from 11.22 g (100 g)-1 DM in Vigna unguiculata to 27.80 g (100 g)-1 DM in A. auriculata. Ether extract was generally low, although Glycine max and Gassia alata had respective values of 10.30 g (100 g)-1 and 9.14 g (100 g)-1 DM. Ash content was no more than 18.84 g (100 g)-1 DM in any of the species. Sodium, calcium and potassium were the most abundant minerals, and copper and manganese were the least abundant. Oxalate ranged from 25.36 mg (100 g)-1 DM in G. max to 223.16 mg (100 g)-1 DM in Bauhinia thoningii, and none was detected in Delonix regia. Phytin content varied from 5.07 mg g-1 DM in C. alata to 82.28 mg g-1 DM in Calapogonium mucunoides, and phytin-phosphorus was no more than 23 mg g-1 DM in any of the species. © 1994.

AB  - Fodder was harvested at an age of 10 years and 11 years. Fodder yields of Leucaena leucocephala varied between spacing for both years and between the two years (seasons). Average fodder yieldwas 5.64 t/ha/year. The yield was not significantly influenced by inter-cropping (managementregime) or interaction between the components of the experiment (i.e. beans, maize and tree crop). Hedge row spacing did have a significant influence on yield. The amount of nutrients removed from the site through fodder harvest was high, resulting in high equivalent costs of replacing the lost nutrients. Due to the large amount of nutrients removed by fodder harvests, replacements are needed but costs are prohibitive. Manipulation of the system for optimum benefits and better nutrient conservation are recommended. © 1995 A B Academic Publisher.

AB  - The dynamics of nodulation, N2-fixation and N use in Leucaena leucocephala cv. K28 over time was investigated in a screenhouse at 4, 8, 12 and 16 months after planting (MAP) using the 15N-labelling method. Leucaena had a consistently increasing pattern of nodulation, dry biomass and nitrogen yield. A sharp rise in nodulation was observed between 12 and 16 MAP, whereas for biomass, N accumulation and N2-fixation, and N2-fixation, an upward surge occurred between 4 and 12 months. Nodulation, N accumulation, N2-fixation and biomass yield all peaked at 16 MAP. Along with the steady increase in N2-fixation throughout the 16-month growth period, the % N derived from the atmosphere rose from 17.9% to 61.5%, 70.1% and 74%, equivalent to 191, 1623, 2395 and 3385 mg N2 fixed plant-1 at 4, 8, 12 and 16 MAP, respectively. Nitrogen assimilation from soil and fertilizer decreased inversely to the increase in symbiotic nitrogen fixation with time. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The potential of alley cropping was explored on calcareous alluvial soils of the mid-Indio-Gangetic Plains of Bihar. The study involved two alley widths (2 and 3 m) and two intra-row spacings (25 and 50 cm) of Leucaena leucocephala. Maize, wheat and green gram were cultivated in alleys 12 months after establishment. The hedgerows were pruned every six months. Forage and wood yields were highest in the narrow alleys while grain production was highest in the wide alleys. The decline in grain yield was highest for green gram and lowest for maize. © 1995 A B Academic Publisher.

AB  - The effects of tropical earthworms (Eudrilus eugeniae) and millipedes (Spirostreptidae) on the breakdown of plant residues [Acioa (presently, Dactyladenia) barteri, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala prunings, maize (Zea mays) stover and rice (Oryza sativa) straw], with contrating chemical compositions, were studied in the field under humid tropical circumstances. Addition of earthworms significantly increased the breakdown of maize stover. Addition of millipedes significantly increased the breakdown of maize stover and rice straw. Combined addition of earthworms and millipedes generally resulted in greater plant residue breakdown, compared to that of a single group of fauna. During 10 weeks of exposure, earthworms and millipedes, on average, accounted for the breakdown of all plant residues by 10.4 and 28.4%, respectively. Millipedes and earthworms contributed more to the breakdown of plant residues with low quality (high C-to-N ratio, lignin and polyphenol contents) than to the degradation of those with high quality. It is concluded that fauna-enhanced breakdown of plant residues will have different effects on soil nutrient supply, depending on residue quality. © 1995.

AB  - Laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to study the effects of mulch incorporations of Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Grevillea robusta and Cassia siamea residues under saline conditions for 10 weeks. Periodic sampling at two-week intervals revealed that nitrification was inhibited in all treatments, especially for the Grevillea and Cassia mulches. In contrast, ammonification was enhanced in all the treatments, increasing directly with salinity in the control and Leucaena treatments. Soil incorporation of Gliricidia, Grevillea and Cassia mulches stimulated NH4-N release with salt addition, but there was little sensitivity to the different salt levels. The results imply that mulching practices under brackish water irrigation may reduce salinity effects on plant growth. -from Authors

AB  - When roots of Leucaena leucocephala seedlings (White Popinac, a tropical legume tree belongs to the Family Mimosaceae) were fumigated with simulated landfill gas (CO2 above 10% and O2 from 10% to atmospheric level), the stem elongation rate and stomatal conductance were inhibited at the absence of any apparent leaf water deficit. When compared with a treatment where root system was flooded, the effect of gas fumigation on the shoot physiology was relatively mild and appeared later. On the other hand, nodule activity (measured as rate of acetylene reduction activity, ARA) was much more severely inhibited by gas fumigation. Although nodule dry weight and carbohydrate storage in nodules were reduced, the inhibition was not likely a result of the shortage of carbohydrate reserve in the nodules. This was because the ARA of untreated fresh nodules was also inhibited immediately following exposure to the simulated landfill gas. In further experiments where CO2 and O2 were manipulated separately, although a reduction of O2 concentration to half of the atmospheric level might account for up to 30% loss of ARA with considerable variation, the high CO2 alone showed a much more severe inhibition. This CO2-induced inhibition was not reversible one hour after the high CO2 gas was removed. There was some recovery of activity 5 day after plants were fumigated, suggesting that the legume plant can maintain some nitrogen-fixation activity under the influence of landfill gas.

AB  - The efficacy of Leucaena leucocephala root litter as a natural biological fertiliser was assessed using Zea mays as a test plant. Up to 8% of the fine roots of the plants constituted root litter. This fine root litter was better than that of Trigonella foenum-graecum at increasing the growth and productivity of Zea mays. The root litter increased the growth of maize shoots more than the growth of roots. This appears to be a general phenomenon when plant nutrients are insufficient, as in the present study. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture, especially in the tropics, could be stably developed through the introduction of trees that symbiotically fix atmospheric nitrogen. Nitrogen fixing intensity is often low, or inhibited by environmental constraints: drought, salinity, shortages, excess mineral nitrogen, diseases and parasites. Very few nitrogen-fixing trees are now used in agroforestry management programmes to enhance the soil nitrogen balance. Nevertheless, symbiotic bacteria/host trees could eventually be improved through plant biotechnology and genetic engineering research. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation could also be optimized by modifying agricultural practices. Nitrogen-fixing trees can be intercropped or not with other annual crops in various conditions, eg, hedges, bush fallows, and long-term rotations. Socieconomic situations have to be taken into account for management programmes in rural environments, promoting species that produce wood and high-protein livetock fodder or edible fruit or seeds. The following species are of interest for their nitrogen-fixing potential: high nitrogen-fixing species, eg Leucaena leucocephala, Calliandra spp., Casuarina equisetifolia; average nitrogen-fixing species, eg Prosopis juliflora, Acacia saligna, low nitrogen-fixing species that are otherwise of considerable interest for intercropping, livestock farming or erosion control. -English summary

AB  - Agroforestry systems involving leaf removal for animal fodder may result in rapid depletion of soil fertility. The purpose of this research was to determine if the effects of leaf removal on soil fertility parameters and maize yield in a Leucaena leucocephala alley cropping system could be reversed. Three leaf management strategies in a Leucaena alley cropping trial that had been in effect from 1987 to 1991 were investigated: 1) leaves returned, 2) leaves removed, and 3) leaves removed, with 100 kg inorganic N ha-1 added. In the 1990/91 season, a 34 confounded factorial design was utilized to investigate the effects of leaf management strategy, N rate (0, 30 and 60 kg N ha-1); maize plant population (14,800, 29,600, and 44,400 plants ha-1); and P rate (0, 18, and 35 kg P ha-1). In the 1991/92 and 1992/93 seasons, leaves were applied equally to all plots, and no P was applied. The N rate and plant population treatments were continued, and the same confounded factorial design was implemented to investigate residual leaf management strategy, residual P rate, n rate, and plant population. The yield gap between the plots where leaves had been returned vs. removed narrowed each season due to uniform leaf application. Application of N improved yields during both seasons. Residual effects of the initial P application decreased to only 10% of the total yield in 1992/93. Plant population affected yields only during the season of very good rainfall. Leaf additions resulted in a relative increase in soil pH, total N, and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K and a decrease C/N ratio in plots that had not previously received leaves. Leaves supplied more K and Zn to the upper 15 cm of soil than were being extracted by the maize crop, but uniform leaf additions eliminated differences in K and Zn uptake. Plant Zn uptake decreased with increasing P rate and plant population, and increased with increasing N rate and a history of leaf return. The results show that applying leaves equilibrated yields within two seasons, and resulted in a relative improvement of several soil properties. The residual effect from P applications was not adequate to maximize yields.

AB  - A greenhouse study was undertaken to determine the nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization requirements for raising mycorrhizal seedlings in soil in containers. Seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala were grown for 40 days in dibble tubes containing fumigated or nonfumigated soil uninoculated or inoculated with Glomus aggregatum. The soil was fertilized with NH4NO3 solution to obtain 25-200 mg N kg-1 soil, and with a KH2PO4 solution to establish target soil solution P concentrations of 0.015-0.08 mg P l-1. At the end of 40 days, seedlings were transplanted into pots containing 5-kg portions of fumigated soil. Posttransplant vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (VAMF) effectiveness, measured as pinnule P content, plant height, shoot dry weight and tissue N and P concentrations, was significantly increased by pretransplant VAMF colonization in both soils. The best posttransplant mycorrhizal colonization and mycorrhizal growth responses were observed if the nonfumigated pretransplant soil was amended with 50 mg N kg-1 soil and 0.04 mg P l-1 or if the fumigated pretransplant soil was amended with 100 mg N kg-1 soil and 0.04 mg P 1-1. There was no relationship between N:P ratios of nutrients added to the pretransplant soil medium and shoot N:P ratios observed after transplanting. Shoot N:P ratio was also not correlated with root colonization level. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Mimosine, a free amino acid present in the leaves and seeds of Leucaena leucocephala, is transformed by some rumen bacteria into the goitrogenic 3-hydroxy-4-(1H) pyridone (3,4 DHP). The present study was conducted to survey the presence of 3,4 DHP-degrading microorganisms in the rumen of cattle in India, since these bacteria have previously been shown to increase the resistance of livestock to 3,4 DHP-toxicity when the plant is used as a forage crop. DHP disappearance was evaluated in semisynthetic culture media. Our results show that the ruminal fluids from experimental cattle, buffalo and goat were colonized with microorganisms that are able to metabolize DHP. However the rate of transformation was rather low, which suggests that these microorganisms do not play a significant role in detoxifying DHP in vivo. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Limited.

TI  - Non-starch polysaccharide composition and in vitro fermentability of tropical forage legumes varying in phenolic content
PY  - 1995

AB  - The fermentation kinetics of leaves of eleven tropical forage legumes varying in phenolic and condensed tannin content were investigated. The leaf samples were from Acacia cyanophylla, Chamaecytisus palmensis, Calliandra sp., Dioclea guianensis, Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania sesban, S. goetzei and three accessions of Tadehagi sp. (accession numbers 13269, 13275 and 23227). The phenolic, condensed tannin (bound condensed tannin and extractable condensed tannin) and non-starch polysaccharide (NSP ≡ to dietary fibre) contents of leaves were determined. Leaves were incubated at 39 °C with rumen micro-organisms in a habitat-simulating medium and the fermentation kinetics investigated using a pressure transducer. The NSP content of leaves both pre-and post-incubation was quantified and proportional losses of the NSP constituents calculated. The NSP content of leaves ranged from 124-252 mg g-1 dry matter, the major components in each case being cellulose-derived glucose and the uronic acids. In all samples, the most degradable NSP constituent was the uronic acids, closely followed by arabinose; cellulose-derived glucose and xylose were the least degradable NSP components. Samples ranked in terms of asymptotic gas-pool in descending order as follows: L. leucocephala = C. palmensis > D. guianensis > S. sesban > A. cyanophylla > S. goetzei > Tadehagi sp., (23227) > Tadehagi sp., (13269) > F. macrophylla > Calliandra sp. > Tadehagi sp., (13275). There were significant relationships between gas accumulation throughout the incubation and the NSP loss (NSPL) values at the end of the incubation. Moreover, the gas pool at the end of the incubation period and NSPL were significantly correlated (r = 0.90) with a yield constant (ml gas g-1 NSP loss) of 200 ml. Furthermore, there were significant (P ≤ 0.05) negative relationships between both gas accumulation and NSPL and the phenolic and condensed tannin content of leaves. © 1995.

AB  - A series of pot experiments were conducted to test the effect of phosphorus (P) application and liming on early growth performance of Zea mays, Mucuna pruriens and nine woody species (Albizia ferruginea, Cajanus cajan, Dactyladenia barteri, Dalbergia sissoo, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Flemingia macrophylla, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Pentacletra macrophylla) on an Ultisol. Low reponse to liming and high response to P application were observed in this trial. Early top growth of the eleven species was correlated to seed size and seed nitrogen (N), P, and calcium (Ca) contents. Highest correlation was observed with seed P content (r = 0.896**). Large seeded size species (D. barteri E. cyclocarpum, M. pruriens, and P. macrophylla) showed the least reponse to P application, while the remaining small seeded size species showed significant responses to P application. The large seeded species also showed relatively less increases in N, P and Ca uptakes with P application and liming. The pot test can be used in prescreening of woody species for use on low P and acid soils. The results also emphasize the need for seed size consideration in multipurpose trees and shrubs selection for establishment in low P and on degraded soils. © 1995, MCB UP Limited

AB  - The recent submission of gum samples collected from Leucaena leucocephala and L. diversifolia in Guatemala has enabled comparison to be made with the corresponding data published previously for these species growing in India and Hawaii. The limited data available to date (n = 6,leucocephala; n = 3, L. diversifolia) indicate that L. diversifolia appears to be more variable,geographically, than L. leucocephala. © 1995 A B Academic Publisher.
