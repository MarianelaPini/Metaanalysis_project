TI  - REMOVAL OF CADMIUM USING ALKALINE-TREATED ACTIVATED CARBON FROM LEUCAENA LEUCOCEPHALA BIOMASS
T2  - ARCHIVES OF METALLURGY AND MATERIALS
AB  - Water contamination that caused by heavy metals is a very common phenomenon in the industrial age. One of the popular way to treat metal contaminated water is by adsorption process using activated carbon as the adsorbent. This paper works on producing activated carbon by chemical means with impregnation ratios of NaOH:char (w/w) was predetermined at 1:1 (ACT1-1), 2:1 (ACT2-1) and 3:1 (ACT3-1) under activation temperature of 700 degrees C. Considering the Leucaena leucocephala is a wildly, easy and fast grown species, with the availability throught the year, it was chosen to be used as the precursor. The properties of these activated carbons and its potential for cadmium removal from aqueus solution was analyzed. It was found that the highest surface area was recorded at 662.76 m(2)/g. Four parameters were studied which are contact time, the effect of pH, initial concentration of adsorbate and temperature. The equilibrium time was achieved in 40 min treatment at initial concentrations of 30 mg/l. The adsorbent exhibited good sorption potential for cadmium at pH 8.0 and equilibrium temperature of 30 degrees C. Based on the results, this study had proved that activated carbon from Leucaena leucocephala biomass have the good potential to be used for removal of cadmium from wastewater.

TI  - Development of high-performance CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbents from urea-modified <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> hydrochar
T2  - BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY
AB  - This study explores the development of urea-functionalized hydrochar from Leucaena leucocephala wood (LW) for CO2 capture. Hydrochar was produced via hydrothermal carbonization at 170 degrees C for 90 min and subsequently functionalized with urea. The effects of urea: hydrochar ratio (1:1 to 3:1), activation temperature (400-800 degrees C), and heating rate (5-15 degrees C/min) on CO2 adsorption capacity were investigated. Optimal conditions (2:1 urea: hydrochar ratio, 600 degrees C activation temperature, 5 degrees C/min heating rate) increased CO2 adsorption capacity from 13.09 mg/g to 76.20 mg/g. The modified adsorbent demonstrated high affinity towards CO2 over N-2, CH4, and O-2, and maintained performance over 11 adsorption-desorption cycles. Kinetic studies revealed physisorption as the primary adsorption mechanism. In fixed-bed column tests, best performing conditions within the tested ranges (30 ml/min flow rate, 15% CO2 concentration, 30 degrees C) yielded a CO2 uptake of 195.54 mg/g. This study demonstrates the potential of urea-functionalized hydrochar from Leucaena leucocephala as an efficient, sustainable adsorbent for CO2 capture.

TI  - Estimating Biomass Sources for a 10 MW Dendro Power Plant Using <i>Leucaena Leucocephala</i> Fuel Wood
T2  - 2023 IEEE 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN POWER ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS, ICPEA
CP  - IEEE 3rd International Conference on Power Engineering Applications (ICPEA) - Shaping Sustainability Through Power Engineering Innovation
AB  - This paper presents the results of an investigation to determine the potential of Leucaena leucocephala as a commercial energy crop for dendro-power generation plants. Dendro-power generation is the generation of electricity from wood fuels. Modern technology enables the efficient, clean and long-term use of wood in dendro power plants. Various tests and calculations have been carried out, such as moisture content, physical analysis and calorific value of tree species. The Leucaena leucocephala yield per unit area of the special plantation for the development of 10 MW dendro power plants was estimated. The development of a 10 MW dendro power plant provides for an annual electricity generation of 50 GWh, which can be used for self-consumption or sold to a power company. This study provides a quantitative approach to estimating the wood requirements for Dendro power generation which has not been done before. From the calculation, the annual fuel consumption of the Dendro power plant requires 48,880 tons/year. Therefore, the total area required for planting the energy plant Leucaena leucocephala is 815 hectares. The number of Leucaena leucocephala trees required to meet the annual fuel consumption of the Dendro power plant is 4,075,000 trees. The implementation of this project will also help the economic development of local communities, especially in rural areas.

TI  - Diversity, Succession and Seasonal Variation of Phylloplane Mycoflora of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> in Relation to Its Leaf Litter Decomposition
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNGI
AB  - To address international food security concerns and sustain a growing global population, global agricultural output needs to increase by 70% by the year 2050. Current agricultural techniques to increase crop yields, specifically the application of chemicals, have resulted in a wide range of negative impacts on the environment and human health. The maintenance of good quality soil organic matter, a key concern in tropical countries such as India, requires a steady input of organic residues to maintain soil fertility. A tree with many uses, Leucaena leucocephala, has attracted much attention over the past decades. As per our literature review, no research has been conducted examining Leucaena leucocephala leaves for their fungal decomposition and their use as green manure. A study of the fungal colonization of Leucaena leucocephala leaves at various stages of decomposition was conducted to get an insight into which fungi play a critical role in the decomposition process. In total, fifty-two different species of fungi were isolated. There was an increase in the percentage of fungus occurrences as the leaves senesced and then finally decomposed. Almost all decomposition stages were characterized by a higher percentage occurrence of Deuteromycetes (75.47%) and by a lower rate of Ascomycetes (9.43%). A gradual increase of basidiomycetes such as unidentified sclerotia and Rhizoctonia solani was seen as the leaves senesced and finally decomposed. In the moist chamber, Didymium nigripes was the only Myxomycete isolated from completely decomposed leaves. In the present study, on average, there were more fungi in wet seasons than in the dry seasons.

TI  - Characterization Studies on New Cellulosic Fiber Extracted from <i>Leucaena Leucocephala</i> Tree
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS
AB  - The present world faces critical issues such as global warming, sea-level rise, and drastic change in the climate pattern due to the emission of greenhouse gases. Large-scale use and disposal of hazardous plastics contribute significantly to the present scenario and it becomes essential to use naturally derived materials for making plastics. Natural fibers were found to possess the inherent characteristics required for reinforcing the polymer. In this work, one such novel cellulosic fiber derived from the bast of Leucaena leucocephala was identified and characterized using tests such as chemical, tensile, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric, Differential scanning calorimetry, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Field emission scanning electron microscopy. The presence of high cellulose (59.03 wt.%) with high crystallinity index (63.10%) contributes to high tensile strength(415-693 MPa) and high tensile modulus (9.90-13.10 GPa) of the Leucaena leucocephala fiber (LLF). From thermogravimetric analysis, LLF was observed to be thermally stable up to 188.20 degrees C and activation energy of 64.22 kJ/mol. The morphological analysis of LLF revealed the existence of honeycombed porous surface characterized with serrations, and this facilitates better bonding characteristics with polymer. Lower density, mechanical properties, and better thermal stability make LLF a suitable alternate for synthetic fibers while making composites.

TI  - Effect of Cadmium on Macro and Micronutrient Uptake and Translocation by <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Environmental contamination with Cadmium (Cd) is of great concern due to its hazardous effects on living organisms.Query In the present research, Leucaena leucocephala plants were exposed to Cd concentrations of 5, 10, and 15 mg/L to determine their potential use in Cd remediation. Different parameters including Cd uptake, macro/micronutrient content, chlorophyl, and catalase production were determined. Results indicated that Cd uptake by L. leucocephala roots did not show a significant difference between treatments. However, a significant increase in Cd content (Tukey ' s HSD) was observed in stems as Cd levels in the media augmented. The highest Cd content (830 +/- 20 mg/kg) was determined in stems of plants exposed to 15 mg/L Cd, and no Cd was detected in leaves. Data showed that as Cd concentration increased in the media, Ca, Mg, K, Zn, and Mn decreased. Moreover, while the presence of Cd reduced catalase activity in roots, chlorophyll production was not affected.

TI  - Leucaena leucocephala and Montmorillonite Co-pyrolysis Biochar: A Study on Physicochemical Properties and Stability
T2  - BIORESOURCES
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, an invasive toxic tree species, has threatened Due to the small-to-medium diameter, the utilization and processing of L. leucocephala is highly restricted, while its discarding accelerates carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere. Biochar, produced from the pyrolysis of biomass under an inert atmosphere, is considered an effective carbon sequestration technique with high stability, which is important for long-term carbon storage and soil improvement. L. leucocephala biomass and montmorillonite were co-pyrolyzed under inert conditions, aiming to investigate the effects of different pyrolysis temperatures and montmorillonite blending ratios on biochar yield and carbon retention. Results showed improved biochar yield and carbon retention with increasing montmorillonite addition. Thermogravimetric analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated enhanced stability of the modified biochars. The production of modified L. leucocephala biochar represents a promising technique for carbon dioxide sequestration and biochar stabilization, enabling the development of L. leucocephala utilization approaches.

TI  - Unveiling<i> Fusarium</i><i> falciforme:</i> Genome sequencing of a Novel wilt causing pathogen in subabul<i> (Leucaena</i><i> leucocephala</i> L.) in India
T2  - MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS
AB  - Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala L.) is a leguminous species often referred to as the "miracle tree," it provides numerous ecosystem services and exhibits robust ecological characteristics. However, the infection caused by phytopathogenic fungi is poorly understood in Subabul. Therefore, this study provides comprehensive insights into the molecular and genomic characteristics of Fusarium falciforme, the causal agent of wilt disease in Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala). Pathogen isolation from infected samples, followed by morpho-molecular characterization through DNA sequencing of key markers (ITS, LSU, TEF1 alpha) and phylogenetic analysis, confirmed the identity of F. falciforme. Host range analysis demonstrated the pathogen's ability to infect additional leguminous crops, including chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and soybean (Glycine max). A complete genome assembly revealed a genome size of 59.19 Mb, comprising 18,853 protein-coding genes. Comparative genomic analysis elucidated evolutionary relationships with other Fusarium species, while functional annotation identified critical virulence factors, such as polyketide synthases, ABC transporters, and secretory proteins, which facilitate host tissue invasion. These findings enhance the understanding of F. falciforme pathogenicity, enabling improved diagnostic tools and management strategies for controlling wilt disease in Subabul and related legumes.

TI  - Performance of Particleboard Made with <i>Neolamarckia cadamba</i>, <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>, and their 50:50 Admixtures
T2  - BIORESOURCES
AB  - The performance of a particleboard seems to be related to the chemical constituents of the species and the size distribution the particles. Neolamarckia cadamba (NC) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL) are fast growing species and good potential resources for particleboard production. This study examined the chemical contents of both species, as well as the mechanical and physical performance of particleboard made with 100% NC, 100% LL, and their 50:50 admixtures. High moisture resistance boards were prepared using melamine urea formaldehyde (MUF) at a content of 10, 12, and 14 %. The 30% extra buffering of LL translated to its lower performance for both mechanical and physical properties. The 50:50 admixtures provided enticing results, as it counteracts the impact of lowered performance of 100% LL. All boards passed the mechanical requirements of the BS EN 312 (2003) standard, but they did not meet the requirement for thickness swelling. The internal bond for cyclic test only failed for 100% LL with 10% resin added. With use of wax, the potential of improvement in swelling properties is possible.

TI  - Coagulation activity of liquid extraction of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> and <i>Sesbania grandiflora</i> on the removal of turbidity
T2  - OPEN CHEMISTRY
AB  - Turbidity is removed by adding a chemical coagulant, which produces a secondary toxic of alumina residues in the water. Therefore, the aim of study was to evaluate the coagulation activity of NaCl extract from Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania grandiflora seeds on the removal of turbidity for water purification. The proximate composition of the seeds was determined. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to identify the functional groups of protein, and the surface morphology was observed by SEM-EDS. To obtain the optimized condition, all experiments were evaluated by artificial turbid water before being applied on the natural water (i.e., Selokan Mataram). The coagulation process was evaluated by concentration (M), dosage (mL/L), and pH in terms of turbidity, total dissolved solids, and transmittance of light. The results showed that both coagulant seeds contained 25.32 and 30.81% of protein. These coagulants could remove the turbidity by 99.7% for L. leucocephala and 94.24% for S. grandiflora from artificial turbid water at the optimized concentration of 1.0 M, and dosage of 5 and 10 mL/L, respectively. At pH 5 the removal of turbidity from Selokan Mataram was 99.4% for L. leucocephala and 97.23% for S. grandiflora.

TI  - Adsorption of Nickel (II) from Aqueous Solution Using <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> Shells
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING-INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH EDITION
AB  - Water pollution, as a result of industrial development, has detrimental effects on aquatic organisms and human beings. In this research, Leucaena leucocephala biomass was modified using Fenton's reagent and sodium hydroxide, and the performances of the native, Fenton-treated, and NaOH-activated adsorbents for removal of Ni(II) from aqueous solution were evaluated under various experimental conditions such as initial pH, contact time, initial concentration of Ni(II), adsorbent dosage, and temperature. The adsorbents were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and pH of the point of zero charge. Kinetic and equilibrium adsorption data were well described by Elovich and Liu models, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities are 50.66, 56.72, and 75.17 mg/g for the native, Fenton-treated, and NaOH-activated L. leucocephala adsorbents, respectively. Desorption of Ni(II) from the surface of the adsorbents was done effectively with 0.03 mol/L of hydrochloric acid. Thermodynamic calculations show that the adsorption process was spontaneous, feasible, and favorable because the values of Delta G degrees were negative. Adsorption of Ni(II) onto the adsorbents was exothermic (Delta H degrees values were negative) and there was also a decrease in the randomness of the liquid-solid interface (Delta G degrees values were negative). Overall, the three adsorbents can be used for the treatment of water that is contaminated with Ni(II).

TI  - Isolation of Cellulose from <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> Mature Pods and How Different Bleaching Agents Affect Its Characterization
T2  - MATERIALS PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERIZATION
AB  - A Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer was used to investigate the effect of using different bleaching agents during the bleaching process on the functional group of cellulose obtained from Leucaena leucocephala pods. The spectra showed that fiber treated with 5 % sodium hypochlorite (NaCIO) showed a similar functional group with the commercial cellulose. Moreover, the chemical composition analysis and whiteness index showed that fiber treated with NaCIO produced 89.37 % cellulose. The whiteness index was 78.5 %, which was the highest. Therefore, these results are expected to provide insight into the potential of utilizing L. leucocephala pods as the alternative raw material for the isolation of cellulose, as the pods of these plants are underutilized.

TI  - Effect of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> leaves hydroalcoholic extract over the hatching of <i>Haemonchus contortus in vitro</i>
T2  - ABANICO VETERINARIO
AB  - Haemonchus contortus (HC) is a gastrointestinal nematode of worldwide importance due to the economic losses it causes directly and indirectly in sheep production. Plant extracts rich in secondary metabolites have been proposed as an alternative method of gastrointestinal nematode control in sheep and goats, as they fulfill their biological function and a sustainable environmental accompaniment. The objective of the present experiment was to determine the effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of Leucaena leucocephala leaves (HELL) on the hatching of Haemonchus contortus in vitro. The extract was obtained by the maceration technique and was subjected to qualitative phytochemical characterization, in which instaurations, phenolic oxydryls, lactones, flavonols, floratanins, coumarins, saponins and aromatic compounds were identified. Concentrations of 100, 90, 80, 70, 60 and 50 mg/mL of the extract were evaluated on the inhibition of egg hatching (IEH) of HC. The hydroalcoholic extract of L. leucocephala showed 71% IEH at 100 mg/mL, an EC50 and EC90 of 52.22 and 302 mg/mL, respectively. The hydroalcoholic extract of L. leucocephala leaves contains bioactive compounds (phenolics, terpenes and flavonoids) that inhibit HC egg hatching with dose-dependent effect. Therefore, HELL could be considered as an alternative control on this nematode, however, it is necessary to determine the specific metabolite that confers the activity, determine its toxicity and perform in vivo trials.

TI  - A review on bioenergetic applications of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB  - The awareness of the environmental impact of CO2 emission from fossil fuels has resulted in the search for alternative renewable energy sources. Biomass-derived from agro-residues and economic trees have been identified as a sustainable fossil fuel alternative. The Leucaena leucocephala tree is abundant and presents diverse beneficial opportunities as a high-energy density tree. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions and constituent nutrients render it valuable for biogas, bio-oil, biodiesel, ethanol, char, activated carbon, etc. production. In this review, an overview of the bioenergetic applications of the Leucaena leucocephala tree was discussed with emphasis on the challenges and potentials of production of biodiesel, bio-oil, ethanol, char, biogas, and activated carbon from the seeds, forages and leaves, bark, wood, and legumes of the Leucaena leucocephala. Also, the biorefinery concept was elucidated for the plausible generation of fine chemicals and fuels. It is hoped that this study will intensify research on the production of biofuels and fine chemicals from agro-industrial crops such as Leucaena leucocephala and its integration into biorefinery.

TI  - Green guaje (Leucaena leucocephala) and pigmented guaje (Leucaena esculenta) as sources of antioxidant and immunomodulatory peptides
T2  - FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in plant-based diets, particularly legumes, as a sustainable and healthy dietary choice. This study breaks new ground by investigating the effects of simulated gastrointestinal digestion on green (Leucaena leucocephala) and pigmented (Leucaena esculenta) guaje proteins. We evaluated the antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties of ultrafiltered fractions resulting from digestion in a macrophage model. Both fractions showed promising potential as radical scavengers. The fraction <5 kDa from pigmented guaje, even at the lowest doses tested, significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6, and demonstrated an immunomodulatory effect by reducing the levels of ROS and NO. These findings suggest that green and pigmented guaje could be a valuable source of bioactive peptides, potentially used as a coadjutant for treating and preventing oxidative stress and inflammation-associated non-communicable diseases through the utilization of underutilized legumes.

TI  - Effect of hydrogen sulfide on cadmium and macro- and micronutrients uptake by <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>
T2  - CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB  - Cadmium (Cd) levels in agricultural soils are increasing because of industrial expansion and pesticide discharge. There are few plants that tolerate heavy metals particularly Cd. NaHS as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor plays a significant role in Cd tolerance by plants reducing its toxicity. The present research was oriented to evaluate the effect of NaHS in Cd and macro-/micronutrient uptake, as well as some physical and chemical parameters in Leucaena leucocephala plants exposed to this metal. Seedlings were grown in a hydroponic system and exposed to 5 ppm of Cd and NaHS at 1, 10, and 100 mu M for 3 days. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP/OES) was used to quantify Cd content and macro-/ micronutrients in plant tissues. Results show a significant difference (Fisher's LSD) in radicle length and chlorophyll but did not show effect on carotenoids content. Addition of NaHS to the media shows a significant increase in Cd uptake by root as NaHS concentration in media increased. The maximum Cd uptake (7670 +/- 102 mg/kg) was found in the roots of plants exposed to 100 mu M of NaHS. A significant reduction in catalase (CAT) activity was observed in the root system, which is due to Cd concentration inside tissues. Results suggested that NaHS helps to decrease the toxic effect of Cd on the growth and development of plants.

TI  - Synthesis of a Chemically Modified Biosorbent Based on the Invasive Plant <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> and Its Application in Metformin Removal
T2  - WATER
AB  - The present study investigated the use of a biosorbent produced from Leucaena leucocephala pods for the removal of metformin from aqueous solutions. The pods were subjected to chemical and thermal treatments and were referred to as L. leucocephala modified, which was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The parameters investigated in the sorption process were temperature, contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH, and initial metformin concentration. The experimental data were in accordance with the Langmuir isothermal model. The maximum adsorption capacity reached was 56.18 mg g(-1) at 313 K. In the kinetic study, stability was achieved in 300 min, with 53.24% removal, and the pseudo-first-order model agreed well with the experimental data. The thermodynamic parameters indicated a spontaneous, favorable, and exothermic reaction. The presence of NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 negatively affected metformin adsorption. Thus, the importance of the study was that a developed material showed promising results in the removal of metformin, particularly because it is an innovative material, and there are no studies in the literature on drug removal using L. leucocephala.

TI  - Porous hydrogel composite with whey protein isolate and galactomannans of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> (<i>subabul</i>) seeds: Stability, rheological, thermal, and morphological characterization
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE
AB  - The present study was aimed at curating a porous KCl crosslinked hydrogel with purified subabul galactomannans (SG) from the defatted seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) and kappa-carrageenan (kappa C) by inducing whey protein isolate (WPI). WPI showed 345% foam overrun and minimal foam drainage (%) at 70 degrees C when whipped for 5 min at pH 6.8 in the hydrogel prepared with 6.5% w/v SG + 1% w/v kappa C + 0.63% w/v KCl + 2% w/v WPI. The SG and WPI incorporated porous hydrogel (SGWP) showed maximum G ' (3010 Pa) and frequency independence (>30 Hz) at 65 degrees C. NMR (H-1), scanning electron microscopy, and thermal characterization of SGWP showed a crosslinked microporous gel network formation. SGWP had high water uptake rate (Q) (432%) at 45 degrees C. The stability of SGWP at neutral pH and high temperature (65 degrees C) added an impetus to this study as it could be used for a wide range of applications. Hence the protein-polysaccharide complexation improvised the functional properties of the porous hydrogels. The results suggested a possible valorization of galactomannans from subabul, a forest resource, into a porous hydrogel suitable as a matrix for delivery of bioactive(s) or an aerogel for multifarious industrial applications. Practical ApplicationA porous hydrogel is defined as a solid, or collection of solid bodies, with sufficient open space to enable a fluid to pass through or around them. Leucaena leucocephala seed (forest resource) galactomannans are non-starch polysaccharides having weak gelling capacity. Whey protein isolates (WPI) are a dairy industry byproduct having excellent foaming properties. Incorporation of WPI in the hydrogel prepared with subabul galactomannan and kappa-carrageenan using KCl as a crosslin could form a stable porous structure having high water uptake rate (Q) at neutral pH and elevated temperature. The hydrogel so developed could be a step toward circular economy.

TI  - LC-MS ANALYSIS AND ANTIOXIDANT, ANTIMICROBIAL AND ANTIPROLIFERATIVE INVESTIGATIONS OF <i>LEUCAENA LEUCOCEPHALA</i> FLOWERS GROWING IN JORDAN EXTRACTS
T2  - FARMACIA
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae family) is one of the plants used in the traditional medicine for the treatment of many diseases. The objective of the present work was to evaluate phytochemically and biologically different extracts of L. leucocephala flowers, grown in Jordan. Total phenols and total flavonoid contents and antioxidant activities of the water, 70% ethanol and n-butanol extracts of the fresh flowers were determined. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evaluated using the dilution method. Microculture tetrazolium assay (MTT) was used to measure the antiproliferative activity. The toxicity of the extracts was assessed using Brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA). The chemical composition of the n-butanol extract, the most potent extract, was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). LC-MS evaluation of the n-butanol extract revealed the presence of 23 compounds. It showed the highest phenolic content (gallic acid equivalent - 321.087 mg/g) and the highest flavonoid content (rutin equivalent - 210.388 mg/g). It exhibited highest antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus (MIC = 0.390 +/- 0.002 mg/mL) and highest antiproliferative activity against T47D (IC50 = 0.094 +/- 0.01 mg/mL). None of the tested extracts exhibited toxicity.

TI  - Leucaena <i>leucocephala </i>toxicity in Brazilian horses
T2  - TOXICON
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala poisoning is reported in horses in different Brazilian regions. The poisoning occurred one month after the horses were introduced into paddocks invaded by the plant or after 10 days of consuming cut Leucaena administered as the only food. Affected horses showed moderate to severe hair loss on the mane and tail, orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with marked follicular telogenization, and hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells. Mimosin concentration in leaves (5.5 mg/g) was determined by a new HLPC-UV method which is also reported.

TI  - Effect of increasing levels of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> seeds to grass pellets on performance of grower rabbits
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - The study was carried out to determine the chemical composition of composite pellets of Megathyrsus maximus containing Leucaena leucocephala seed meal at the varying level and growth responses, as well as haematological and serum biochemical of rabbits, fed the pellets for 60 days. The treatment consists of M. maximus and L. leucocephala-100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30 and 60:40, respectively. Results revealed an increase (P < 0.05) in the proximate composition of the grass pellets with an increase in seed inclusion while there was a reduction (P < 0.05) in the NDF contents of the pellets. An increase in the tannin contents was recorded with an increase in seed inclusion to the grass pellets. Rabbits fed with 30 and 40% inclusions of seed in the grass pellets had similar weight gain while the lowest feed conversion ratio was recorded in rabbits fed grass with 30% seed inclusion. Packed cell volume, RBC and lymphocyte in rabbits were altered with feeding grass seed pellet (P < 0.05), although no particular pattern was followed. Total protein, globulin and urea contents were reduced in the rabbits as the contents of the seeds in the grass pellets increased. Albumin contents in pellets with 30% of seeds were higher in the rabbits fed the pellets above other treatments. It can be concluded that increasing the seed meal level up to 30% in grass pellets supported growth response without inflicting any side effects on the health indices of the rabbits.

TI  - Mapping <i>Lantana camara</i> and <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> in Protected Areas of Pakistan: A Geo-Spatial Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Invasive alien plants are considered as one of the major causes of loss of native biodiversity around the world. Remote sensing provides an opportunity to identify and map native and invasive species using accurate spectral information. The current study was aimed to evaluate PlanetScope (3 m) and Sentinel (10 m) datasets for mapping the distribution of native and invasive species in two protected areas in Pakistan, using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The multispectral data were analysed with the following four ML algorithms (classifiers)-random forest (RF), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM)-to classify two invasive species, Lantana camara L. (common lantana) and Leucaena leucocephala L. The (Ipil-ipil) Dzetsaka plugin of QGIS was used to map these species using all ML algorithms. RF, GMM, and SVM algorithms were more accurate at detecting both invasive species when using PlanetScope imagery rather than Sentinel. Random forest produced the highest accuracy of 64% using PlanetScope data. Lantana camara was the most dominating plant species with 23% cover, represented in all thematic maps. Leucaena leucocpehala was represented by 7% cover and was mainly distributed in the southern end of the Jindi Reserve Forest (Jhelum). It was not possible to discriminate native species Dodonea viscosa Jacq. (Snatha) using the SVM classifier for Sentinel data. Overall, the accuracy of PlanetScope was slightly better than Sentinel in term of species discrimination. These spectral findings provide a reliable estimation of the current distribution status of invasive species and would be helpful for land managers to prioritize invaded areas for their effective management.

TI  - Critical Insights Into the Ecological and Invasive Attributes of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>, a Tropical Agroforestry Species
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGRONOMY
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (commonly known as leucaena) is a leguminous species of the family Fabaceae and a native of Mexico and Central America. It is often addressed as a "miracle tree" for offering a wide variety of ecosystem services and possessing strong ecological attributes. The multiple uses of leucaena in agroforestry, livestock, and restoration practices led to the worldwide distribution of its ssp. glabrata and leucocephala. However, following its introduction into non-native regions, the commercial value of ssp. leucocephala was challenged by its large-scale spread outside the cultivation zone. It has assumed a status of an environmental weed and invasive plant in many regions across Africa (17 countries and Island nations), Asia (17), Europe (1), Oceania (23), North America (12), and South America (7). The plant is enlisted in the top five terrestrial invasive plant species with the greatest international presence. The species is now considered one of the 100 worst invaders in the world. The plant mainly invades roadsides, wastelands, cultivated lands, riverbanks, and forest edges, and suppresses the growth of other woody and herbaceous species. Its infestations alter the patterns of vegetation, plant succession, and community assembly in the introduced habitats. Propagation of ssp. leucocephala, without considering the environmental risks associated with it, may result in major repercussions and irreparable losses. Therefore, it is important to discuss its invasive propensities and the possible alternatives that may replace the weedy species without encumbering its economic benefits. This review aims to thoroughly evaluate the ecological and invasive attributes of leucaena, promote awareness about the ecological costs associated with its spread, and suggest suitable options for its management.

TI  - Evolution of novel strains of Ensifer nodulating the invasive legume Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in different climatic regions of India through lateral gene transfer
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Invasive legume Leucaena leucocephala nodulated with Ensifer strains harboring different combinations of core and sym gene.
   More than 200 root-nodule bacterial strains were isolated from Leucaena leucocephala growing at 42 sampling sites across 12 states and three union territories of India. Genetic diversity was observed among 114 strains from various climatic zones; based on recA, these were identified as strains of Ensifer, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, and Bradyrhizobium. In multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) strains clustered into several novel clades and lineages. Ensifer were predominant nodulating genotype isolated from majority of alkaline soils, while Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium strains were isolated from a limited sampling in North-Eastern states with acidic soils. Positive nodulation assays of selected Ensifer representing different genetic combinations of housekeeping and sym genes suggested their broad host range within the closely related mimosoid genera Vachellia, Senegalia, Mimosa, and Prosopis. Leucaena selected diverse strains of Ensifer and Mesorhizobium as symbionts depending on available soil pH, climatic, and other edaphic conditions in India. Lateral gene transfer seems to play a major role in genetic diversification of Ensifer exhibited in terms of Old World vs. Neotropical genetic make-up and mixed populations at several sites. Although Neotropical Ensifer strains were most symbiotically effective on Leucaena, the native Ensifer are promiscuous and particularly well-adapted to a wide range of sampling sites with varied climates and edaphic factors.

TI  - Effects of Composting Yard Waste Temperature on Seed Germination of a Major Tropical Invasive Weed, <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Composting is an environmental-friendly option for yard waste management, and produces products for improving soil quality. However, there is a weed dispersal risk if the compost contains many active weed seeds. This study assessed the potential of composting in minimizing the seed germination of a major tropical invasive weed, Leucaena leucocephala. The germination of the species was tested after two different sets of thermal treatments, i.e., (1) different constant temperatures (20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 50 degrees C, 60 degrees C, and 70 degrees C) for 5 days, and (2) composting temperature (simulating the temperature profile of a typical composting process) for 60 days. A three-month growth test was further conducted for the seeds treated with the composting temperature. The seeds were present either alone (N-seeds) or mixed with wood chips (W-seeds) when thermally treated. A constant temperature treatment of 70 degrees C suppressed the seed germination to a low rate. For the composting temperature treatment, the germination percentage of the N-seeds and W-seeds were reduced from around 60% to 22.7% and 12.7%, respectively. This preliminary study suggested that the temperature should reach as high as 70 degrees C in the composting process to guarantee the suppression of the germination of the seeds of L. leucocephala, particularly when the seeds are contained within seed pods during composting.

TI  - Alien invasive Leucaena leucocephala successfully acquires nutrients by investing in below-ground biomass compared to native Vachellia nilotica in nutrient-amended soils in South Africa
T2  - AOB PLANTS
AB  - Soils in grasslands and savannas of southern Africa are acidic and nutrient-poor. Legume plants, such as Vachellia nilotica and alien invasive Leucaena leucocephala, are a major component of the vegetation there. Vachellia nilotica can establish in drought-prone environments, and is invasive in high rainfall areas. Leucaena leucocephala is an emerging invasive in South Africa and is ranked among the world's 100 most invasive alien species. Alien plants can invade native habitats through their adaptability to low-resource soils, and thus can out-compete and displace native vegetation. We investigated the effects of phosphorus (P) deficiency and soil acidity on legume-microbe symbiosis, nitrogen (N) nutrition and carbon (C) growth costs of these two legumes in grassland soils. We used as inoculum and growth substrate soils collected from a long-term (>65 years) nutrient and lime-addition trial, the Veld Fertilizer Trial (VFT), located at Ukulinga Research Farm near Pietermaritzburg in South Africa. We used soils from three VFT treatments: soils fertilized with superphosphate (336 kg ha(-1)) applied once per year (+P), soils fertilized with superphosphate (336 kg ha(-1)) applied once per year with dolomitic lime (2250 kg ha(-1)) applied once every 5 years (P+L) and soils with no superphosphate and no dolomitic lime applications (Control). Seeds of V. nilotica and L. leucocephala were germinated and grown independently in these soils in green house conditions and harvested after 125 days for measurement of growth, legume-microbe symbiosis, N nutrition and C growth costs. Results showed that the two legumes had different growth adaptations. Vachellia nilotica grown in control soils and +P soils nodulated with various Burkholderia spp., while L. leucocephala did not nodulate in all soil treatments. Both legumes utilized for growth both atmospheric- and soil-derived N across all treatments thereby decreasing C growth costs. Vachellia nilotica grown in +P soils accumulated the most biomass and N nutrition. Leucaena leucocephala maximized specific N assimilation rates by investing in below-ground biomass accumulation in control soils. This shows that L. leucocephala possesses traits that are successful in acquiring nutrients by investing in below-ground biomass and relying on utilization of N from both the soil and the atmosphere.
   Alien plants such as L. leucocephalacan invade native habitats through their adaptability to low-resource soils, and thus can out-compete and displace native vegetation. They do this by investing on their below-ground biomass, reliance in free-living N-fixing bacteria and altering N sources. Therefore, soil management practices that seek to address nutrient deficiency and soil acidity in nutrient-stressed ecosystems may affect the interaction between native and alien invasive woody plants in impacted ecosystems.

TI  - Therapeutic Effect and Immune Changes after Treatment of <i>Hymenolepis nana</i>-Infected BALB/c Mice with Compounds Isolated from <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>
T2  - VETERINARY SCIENCES
AB  - Simple Summary This article is mainly about the development of natural medicines against the zoonotic tapeworm (Hymenolepis nana), which is caused by tapeworm eggs in infected mice, through the isolation of the components of jumbay (Leucaena leucocephala). This study allowed for an understanding of the drug therapy through the testing of these isolated components in vitro and in vivo. The authors assessed the survival and motility, and they confirmed that the two components had good effects against tapeworm. One of these components has a promising therapeutic effect in tapeworm-infected mice in the response to egg production, worm numbers, and immune responses. This article highlights the immune-enhancing and therapeutic effects of 13(2)-hydroxy-(13(2)-S)-pheophytin a against tapeworms in infected mice. Background/Purpose: Hymenolepis nana is globally distributed. Leucaena leucocephala has been studied as a treatment, including the nematodes and protozoa, but no research results are related to cestodes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to target H. nana. Methods: The natural components of L. leucocephala were isolated and added to H. nana, which was cultured in vitro, to observe changes in the mortality, motility, and morphology. BALB/c male mice infected with H. nana were treated with effective components of L. leucocephala for 10 days, and the changes were recorded. After the mice were sacrificed, the spleen weight was measured, and a primary culture was performed for the subsequent cytokine and chemokine testing. Results: The experiment found that 13(2)-hydroxy-(13(2)-S)-pheophytin a and aristophyll-C have clear cestocidal effects in vitro. 13(2)-hydroxy-(13(2)-S)-pheophytin a has been shown to be effective at reducing parasite populations and eliciting host immune responses in vivo. IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, MCP-1, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, MIP-1 alpha, and GM-CSF in 13(2)-hydroxy-(13(2)-S)-pheophytin a were significantly increased after stimulation, while IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-3, IL-12p70, and RANTES were unchanged. Conclusions: The investigation shows that components of L. leucocephala have actual cestocidal activity against H. nana.

TI  - Valorization of arabinoxylans from Linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) and galactomannans from Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) to develop hybrid hydrogels: Rheological, morphological and thermal characterization
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB  - The present investigation was aimed at preparing hydrogels from galactomannans extracted from the defatted seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) (SGM) and kappa-carrageenan (xC) in an aqueous phase (pH 6.8) using KCl as ionic crosslinker. The dynamic moduli (G' and G") and Power law parameters (n' and n") of the hydrogels were optimized through full factorial design (CCD). The optimized hydrogel was prepared with SGM (6.5% w/v) and xC (1% w/v) in the presence of KCl (0.63% w/v) (GA1). A hybrid hydrogel using a combination of SGM and crude arabinoxylan from flaxseed (FX) was also optimized similarly as GA1. The optimized hybrid hydrogel was composed of FX (1% w/w), SGM (5.5% w/v), and xC (1.32% w/v) crosslinked with 0.25% w/v KCl (GAX). GAX showed higher dynamic moduli (G'-2871 Pa, G"-1711 Pa) than GA1 (G'-2589 Pa and G"-1399 Pa) due to the formation of stable interpenetrating polymer network between the hydrogel components. The structural (NMR (1H), FTIR), morphological (SEM), rheological as well as thermal studies confirmed superior characteristics of GAX than GA1. This was also evident from high gel strength (2019 N) and increased firmness (1231 N.s) of GAX. GAX also exhibited 389% water uptake ratio (q) at neutral pH and 45 degrees C, and did not show any syneresis for 72 h at 4 degrees C. The synergistic amalgamation of a galactomannan from a forest resource and an arabinoxylan from flaxseed processing byproduct not only valorizes them but also enables the development of a self-stable hydrogel that can find far reaching applications in various industrial sectors.

TI  - Performance of water-extracted Leucaena leucocephala seeds as coagulant and alum in treating aquaculture effluent: effect of dosage, rapid mixing speed, and settling time
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of plant-based coagulant extracted from Leucaena leucocephala seeds compared with alum in removing solids from aquaculture wastewater. Water-extraction method was used to extract the active ingredients from the seeds by dissolving the seeds' powder in distilled water at 20 g/L concentration, whereas alum was dissolved directly at the same concentration. Operation parameters of jar test including dosage, rapid-mixing speed, and settling time were optimized for the water-extracted seed solution and alum to improve the removal efficiency. The optimum operation parameters for the water-extracted seed solution and alum were dosages of 240 and 320 mg/L respectively, rapid-mixing speed 150 rpm, and settling time 40 min. At the optimum operation parameters, water-extracted seed solution had removal efficiencies of 96.32%, 92.85%, and 86%, whereas alum had removal efficiencies of 99.77%, 99.92%, and 99.92% for turbidity, total suspended solids, and color, respectively. Despite the high efficiency of the water-extracted seed solution, dissolved contaminants such as NO3, PO4, COD, and true color increased owing to the presence of organic matter in the solution. With these results, L. leucocephala seeds had high potential to be used as alternative in removing solids from aquaculture wastewater. Further studies on the extraction of active ingredients should be conducted to increase the removal efficiency and avoid side effects on the contaminants dissolved in the effluent.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen regulation on heavy metal phytoextraction efficiency (<i> Leucaena</i> leucocephala ): Application of a nitrogen fertilizer and a fungal agent
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) have been identified as the primary contaminants in soil, posing potential health threats. This study aimed to examine the effects of applying a nitrogen fertilizer and a fungal agent Trichoderma harzianum J2 (nitrogen alone, fungi alone, and combined use) on the phytoremediation of soils co -contaminated with Pb and Cd. The growth of Leucaena leucocephala was monitored in the seedling, differentiation, and maturity stages to fully comprehend the remediation mechanisms. In the maturity stage, the biomass of L. leucocephala significantly increased by 18% and 29% under nitrogen -alone (NCK + ) and fungal agent -alone treatments (J2), respectively, compared with the control in contaminated soil (CK + ). The remediation factors of Pb and Cd with NCK + treatment significantly increased by 50% and 125%, respectively, while those with J2 treatment increased by 73% and 145%, respectively. The partial least squares path model suggested that the nitrogen -related soil properties were prominent factors affecting phytoextraction compared with biotic factors (microbial diversity and plant growth). This model explained 2.56 of the variation in Cd concentration under J2 treatment, and 2.97 and 2.82 of the variation in Pb concentration under NCK + and J2 treatments, respectively. The redundancy analysis showed that the samples under NCK + and J2 treatments were clustered similarly in all growth stages. Also, Chytridiomycota , Mucoromucota , and Ciliophora were the key bioindicators for coping with heavy metals. Overall, a similar remediation mechanism allowed T. harzianum J2 to replace the nitrogen fertilizer to avoid secondary pollution. In addition, their combined use further increased the remediation efficiency.

TI  - Adsorption study of methylene blue dye removal with activated carbon derived from <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> wastes prepared via H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> activation
T2  - REACTION KINETICS MECHANISMS AND CATALYSIS
AB  - This study aims to valorize agricultural waste of Leucaena leucocephala pods (LP) as a low-cost precursor for synthesizing high-performance activated carbon (LP-AC) for the removal of methylene blue dye (MB). Phosphoric acid H3PO4 was employed as a chemical activator of the LP biomass with a mass ratio of phosphoric acid to the precursor (3/1) before being calcined at 500 degrees C for 55 min. Box Benken design was investigated to optimize the experimental parameters of initial concentration, adsorbent dose, and pH. Variable optimization indicated that the highest removal efficiency of MB dye, estimated as 99.99%, was noticed at the initial concentration of 300.87 mg L-1, adsorbent dose of 0.049 g, and solution pH of 10.07. Isotherm study revealed that Temkin model shows the best agreement with the experimental data with a correlation coefficient of (R-2 = 0.990). The adsorption capacity of MB dye was determined as 584.32 mg g(-1). The kinetic study suggested that the pseudo-second-order model is the best-correlated model for data fitting with (R-2 > 0.997). The thermodynamic analysis indicated an enthalpy change (Delta H) of - 18.50 kJ/mol, confirming that the adsorption of MB dye onto LP-AC material is an exothermic process. SEM characterization of the surface showed that the LP-AC exhibits a heterogeneous structure. The BET analysis revealed a remarkable surface area of 1367.30 m(2) g(-1) for the produced carbon, including a blend of mesoporous and microporous structures. Furthermore, complementary analyses including EDS, TGA, and FTIR confirmed the presence of crucial properties, underscoring its potential effectiveness as an adsorbent for removing MB dye.

TI  - Anthelmintic Effect of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> Extract and Its Active Compound, Mimosine, on Vital Behavioral Activities in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - Helminth infections continue to be a neglected global threat in tropical regions, and there have been growing cases of anthelmintic resistance reported towards the existing anthelmintic drugs. Thus, the search for a novel anthelmintic agent has been increasing, especially those derived from plants. Leucaena leucocephala (LL) is a leguminous plant that is known to have several pharmacological activities, including anthelmintic activity. It is widely known to contain a toxic compound called mimosine, which we believed could be a potential lead candidate that could exert a potent anthelmintic effect. Hence, this study aimed to validate the presence of mimosine in LL extract and to investigate the anthelmintic effect of LL extract and mimosine on head thrashing, egg-laying, and pharyngeal pumping activities using the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Mimosine content in LL extract was confirmed through an HPLC analysis of spiking LL extract with different mimosine concentrations, whereby an increasing trend in peak heights was observed at a retention time of 0.9 min. LL extract and mimosine caused a significant dose-dependent increase in the percentage of worm mortality, which produced LC50s of 73 mg/mL and 6.39 mg/mL, respectively. Exposure of C. elegans to different concentrations of LL extract and mimosine significantly decreased the head thrashing, egg-laying, and mean pump amplitude of pharyngeal pumping activity. We speculated that these behavioral changes are due to the inhibitory effect of LL extract and mimosine on an L-type calcium channel called EGL-19. Our findings provide evidential support for the potential of LL extract and its active compound, mimosine, as novel anthelmintic candidates. However, the underlying mechanism of the anthelmintic action has yet to be elucidated.

TI  - Phytochemicals derived from <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) biomass and their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities: HPLC analysis of extracts
T2  - BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY
AB  - The biomass production from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (family Fabaceae) is a valuable source for chemical biorefinery. The bioactive molecules from the methanol extracts (MEs) from various parts of L. leucocephala grown in Egypt were evaluated. The antibacterial activity against the growth of Erwinia amylovora, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined by the inhibition zones (IZs) and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The antifungal activity against the growth of Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, and Alternaria solani was recorded by measuring the fungal growth inhibition (FGI %) and MICs. The phytochemical compounds in the MEs were identified by HPLC-DAD, where the higher compounds identified (mg/kg ME) in seeds were benzoic acid (1520.44), myricetin (848.73), and rosmarinic acid (792.46); in roots, were benzoic acid (554.04), naringenin (419.99), and myricetin (205.51); in leaves were rosmarinic acid (4768.16), resveratrol (2983.99), quercetin (2052.43), myricetin (1432.63), and naringenin (1182.39); in branches, were rosmarinic acid (2230.26), resveratrol (1605.3), o-coumaric acid (691.16), and myricetin (681.93); in fruits were rosmarinic acid (431.43) and resveratrol (261.07); in stem-wood, were ellagic acid (1319.75), p-coumaric acid (1051.59), and ferulic acid (512.45); and in stem-bark, were resveratrol (1079.01), benzoic acid (1071.11), and catechol (305.51). The MEs at the concentration of 4000 mg/L from stem-wood, leaves, and stem-bark, the higher IZs against the growth of E. amylovora, A. tumefaciens, and S. aureus with values of 4.06 cm, 2.5 cm, and 2.63 cm, respectively, were found. The range of MICs values of MEs was 75-500 mg/L, 75-125 mg/L, and 75-125 mg/L, against the growth of A. tumefaciens, E. amylovora, and S. aureus, respectively. MEs prepared from seeds, fruits (pod), and stem-bark at 4000 mg/L showed the higher FGI (100%) against the growth of A. solani; MEs from seeds and branches observed the higher FGI values of 63.83% and 63.6%, respectively, against the growth of F. solani, and all MEs showed potent antifungal activity (FGI 100%) against R. solani except for leaf ME (88.06%). MICs were in the range of 250-500, 250-500, and 500-1000 mg/L against A. solani, F. solani, and R. solani, respectively. At 500 mg/L, the roots ME showed the highest total antioxidant activity (94.30%) compared to vitamin C (VC) (98.30%) at 100 mg/L. The EC50 values of the MEs from seeds, fruits, stem-bark, branches, stem-wood, leaves, and roots were 424.24 mg/L, 131.40 mg/L, 341.78 mg/L, 380.50 mg/L, 153.59 mg/L, 153.59 mg/L, and 129.89 mg/L compared with VC (6.88 mg/L). In conclusion, the botanical parts of L. leucocephala have several bioactive compounds, which can act as promising antimicrobial and antioxidant properties.

TI  - Investigation on the Chemical Composition of Phenolic, Fatty Acid Profiles (GC-FID) and Biological Activities from <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> (Lam de wit) Seed Oil and Leaves Extracts: Effect of Geographical Location and Maturation Stage
T2  - CHEMISTRY AFRICA-A JOURNAL OF THE TUNISIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam de wit) is a valuable source of bioactive metabolites with high preventive and therapeutic effectiveness. Here, and taking into account the effect of geographical location and maturation stage, we aimed to investigate the chemical composition of phenolic, fatty acid profiles (GC-FID) and biological activities from L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) seed oil and leave extracts. The results indicated that L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) ethanolic leaves extracts growing in Ariana have the highest levels in phenolic and flavonoid contents and showed remarkable antioxidant activities. Furthermore, L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) oils extracted from seeds growing in two locations at different maturation stage were analyzed using GC-FID to determine fatty acids profiles and significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between growing area and maturation stage. In addition, both oils and ethanolic extract of L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) were able to limit gram positive and gram negative bacteria, Candida species as well as the tested filamentous fungi species, and the examination of results prove that the diameter of zone inhibition was related to the tested microorganisms. The results credibly indicate that L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) leaves and seeds are nutrient-rich and can contribute effectively to the daily nutrient requirements alongside its therapeutic properties.

TI  - EVALUATION OF IPIL-IPIL<i> (Leucaena</i><i> leucocephala)</i> SEED GUM AS CO-ENCAPSULATING AGENT FOR TARGETED AND CONTROLLED DELIVERY OF POWDERED INSULIN PLANT<i> (Chamaecostus</i><i> cuspidatus)</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY AND FOOD SCIENCES
AB  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is the most common non-communicable disease in the Philippines, characterized by increased blood glucose levels brought by low insulin production or insulin resistance. Chamaecostus cuspidatus is a medicinal plant known for its glucose-lowering property. The controlled release of the C. cuspidatus leaves must be achieved to maximize its antidiabetic property. Leucaena leucocephala is an endemic tree in the Philippines, having its seed as a source of possible co-encapsulating material for drug delivery. Galactomannan, as the main component of the isolated seed gum, can be used as a substitute for an effective moderate drug release to its intended site. Thus, this study evaluates the drug release property and stability of seed gum as a co-encapsulating agent for targeted and controlled delivery of the C. cuspidatus leaves. The encapsulation process of the C. cuspidatus leaves was done through the extrusion method. The stability of the encapsulation was evaluated through in vitro gastrointestinal simulation analysis and was examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) to verify its surface morphology. The capsules were observed to fully disintegrate at the fed state (pH 5.4) of the simulated gastrointestinal conditions, which is the target site. The fingerprint on the FTIR spectra of the encapsulated drug presented indicates the successful incorporation of the powdered leaves inside the encapsulating material. Morphological micrographs have shown that the resulting capsules were fairly in spherical, having a size of approximately 3.8 mm. Ridges and pores are also present on the surface of the capsules for their immediate disintegration and hydration. Therefore, the L. leucocephala seed gum can be a potential candidate as a co-encapsulating material suitable for effective, targeted, and controlled delivery of C. cuspidatus leaves for maximum antidiabetic benefits.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES
AB  - This study investigated the effects of replacing fish meal with Leucaena leucocephala leaf powder on survival, growth performance, digestive enzyme activities, biochemical body composition and muscle texture of the white -leg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931). Five different diets were examined, by replacing fish meal with L. leucocephala leaf powder at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20%, in triplicates. Shrimps were stocked in 0.5 m3 tanks @ 70 shrimps per tank and fed on the experimental diets for a period of 60 days. The results showed that the survival rate (%), daily weight gain (g day-1), specific growth rate (% day-1), feed intake (% fish-1 day-1), feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, and protein retention were not significantly different (p>0,05) among the treatment groups. The values of alpha-amylase and pepsin in the stomach and chymotrypsin (mU min-1 mg protein-1) in the intestine were not significantly different among treatments. However, the value of alpha-amylase in the intestine was significantly higher in animals fed diets that replaced fish meal with L. leucocephala leaf powder at 0, 5 and 10% compared to other treatments. The biochemical constituents (except for lipid) and the texture (N) of shrimp meat were not significantly different among treatment groups. The results suggested that L. leucocephala leaf powder could replace fish meal up to 20% in white-leg shrimp diets.

TI  - Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent based Ultrasound-assisted extraction: A green approach for extraction of sulfhydryl and mimosine from<i> Leucaena</i><i> leucocephala</i> (Lam) de Wit seeds
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit seeds, also known as river tamarind, contain sulfhydryl compounds that exhibit antioxidant effects. However, these seeds also possess a toxic effect from mimosine. In this study, the river tamarind seeds were extracted using a natural deep eutectic solvent (NADES) based UAE. Among six NADES compositions screened, choline chloride-glycerol (ChCl-Gly) and choline chloride-sucrose (ChCl-Suc) were selected to be further optimized using a Box-Behnken Design in the RSM. The optimization of total sulfhydryl content was performed in 17 runs using three variables, namely water content in NADES (39%, 41%, and 43%), extraction time (5, 10, and 15 min), and the liquid-solid ratio (3, 5, and 7 mL/g). The highest concentration of sulfhydryls was obtained from ChCl-Gly-UAE (0.89 mg/g sample) under the conditions of a water content in NADES of 41% (v/v) and a liquid-solid ratio of 3 mL/g for 15 min, followed by that of from ChCl-Suc-UAE extract under the conditions of water content in NADES of 43% (v/v) and the liquid-solid ratio of 3 mL/g for 10 min with total sulfhydryl level was 0.67 mg/g sample. The maceration method using 30% ethanol resulted in the lowest level of sulfhydryls with a value of 0.52 mg/g. The mimosine compounds obtained in the NADES-based UAE (ChCl-Suc and ChCl-Gly) extracts were 4.95 and 7.67 mg/g, respectively, while 12.56 mg/g in the 30% ethanol-maceration extract. The surface morphology of L. leucocephala seed before and after extraction was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of ChCl-Suc and ChCl-Gly in NADES-based UAE is more selective in attracting sulfhydryl compounds than that of 30% ethanol-maceration extraction.

TI  - Phosphorous Fractions in Soils of Natural Shrub-Grass Communities and <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> Plantations in a Dry-Hot Valley
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Afforestation is an effective approach for restoring degraded ecological functions in the dry-hot valleys of southwest China. Afforestation can affect soil carbon and nitrogen storage; however, how it affects soil P fractions, and their driving factors. is poorly understood in this region. To address these questions, we conducted a field study of Leucaena leucocephala plantations at three different stand age sites (3, 10, and 20 years) and an adjacent natural shrub-grass community control site to investigate changes in soil total phosphorus (Pt), Pi (inorganic phosphorus), Po (organic phosphorus), and phosphorus (P) fractions and their driving factors. Soil Pt, Po, labile P, and moderately labile P significantly increased in the Leucaena leucocephala plantation compared with the natural shrub grass site, and the Leucaena leucocephala plantation increased soil Pt content by significantly increasing soil Po. Soil Pt, Po, Pi, labile P, moderately labile P and non-labile P were not significantly different among the different stages of the Leucaena leucocephala plantation, and soil Pt and its fractions were all significantly higher in the middle-age forest stage of the Leucaena leucocephala plantation. These results indicate that Leucaena leucocephala plantations increased the soil P transformation ability, and soil Po played a critical role in sustaining soil P availability. The middle-age forest stage of Leucaena leucocephala plantations had the best conditions for P stocks and P conversion capacity. The abundance of actinomycetes and fungi showed significant positive relationships with soil Pi fractions (NaHCO3-Pi, NaOH-Pi, and NaOHu.s.-Pi); soil Pt and moderately labile P were significantly and directly influenced by fungal abundance. Soil organic carbon (SOC), NH4+-N, and NO3--N showed significant and positive relationships with the soil Pi fractions (NaHCO3-Pi, NaHCO3-Po, and HCl-Po). SOC and NO3--N were the key drivers of soil Pt, labile P, moderately labile P and non-labile fractions. These results indicate that abiotic and biotic factors differently affected the soil P fractions and Pt in Leucaena leucocephala plantations in the dry-hot valley.

TI  - Morphological Characteristics Selection of Acid-tolerant <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> Mutant to Addition of IBA Hormone (Indole Butyric Acid) in Tissue Culture
T2  - JURNAL ILMU TERNAK DAN VETERINER
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a legume forage plant that has a high protein content. Tissue culture is a technique that can be used to select mutants for forage plants in vitro. IBA (Indole butyric acid) is one type of auxin that can induce rooting and growth in plants. This study aimed to select the morphological characteristics of the acid-tolerant Leucaena leucocephala mutant to the addition of the hormone IBA in tissue culture. The design used in this study was a completely randomized design (CRD) with lamtoro plant explants as many as 11 acid-tolerant mutant lines pH 3.4 resulting from 400 gy irradiation which had been treated on 300 ppm Al3 acid media, namely the K1-K11 strain (mutant+MS+1ppm IBA) and 2 parent trees Leucaena leucocephala without gamma irradiation, namely PO as Leucaena leucocephala parent+MS+0ppm IBA, P1 as Leucaena leucocephala parent+MS+ 1 ppm IBA with 15 replicates. The treatment which had a significant effect was continued with the test Tukey. Variables observed were an increase in root length, plant vertical height, number of shoots, and percentage of rooted plants. The increase in root length and increase in plant vertical height showed the best results on the K10 mutant strain, the number of shoots showed the best results on the K9 and K11 mutant strains, and the highest percentage of rooted plants on the K3 and K11 mutant strains. The addition of IBA can increase the morphological characteristics of the Leucaena leucocephala mutant.

TI  - Chemical composition and <i>in vitro</i> rumen fermentation kinetics of leaves and stems of <i>Moringa oleifera</i> and <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> as potential feedstuffs for sheep
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the nutritive value of different vegetative parts of Moringa oleifera (leaves, stems and plant debris) and Leucaena leucocephala (leaves and dried pods after seed harvesting). Nutrient composition, secondary metabolites and kinetics of gas production (GP) from in vitro rumen fermentation were measured to investigate the adequacy of these materials as feed resources for ruminants. Leaves of M. oleifera had the highest (p < .001) crude protein content (22.9%), total polyphenols (336 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry matter [DM]), flavonoids (158 mg quercetin equivalent/g DM), condensed tannins (2.26 mg catechin equivalents/g DM) and extraction yield (29.3%). Debris of M. oleifera showed the highest (p < .001) antioxidant activity. The pods and leaves of L. leucocephala showed the highest organic matter (OM; 94.5 and 92.7%, respectively), neutral detergent fiber (63.1 and 64.6%, respectively), acid detergent fiber (48.5 and 45%, respectively) and hemicellulose (14.6 and 19.6%, respectively). However, the leaves and stems of M. oleifera showed the highest (p < .001) asymptotic GP (152 and 147 mL/g DM incubated) and fractional rate of fermentation (0.168 and 0.146 per h) compared to the leaves and pods of L. leucocephala. Additionally, the highest (p < .001) OM digestibility (59.8%), metabolizable energy (8.32 MJ/kg DM), net energy (in terms of forage units for lactation or meat production) were observed with the leaves of M. oleifera. In conclusion, the concentration of nutrients differed between plants and within parts of the plant. Leaves of M. oleifera showed higher nutritive value than the stems and shed material. The pods of L. leucocephala showed higher nutritive value than its leaves.

TI  - CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND POTENTIAL USES OF<i> LEUCAENA</i> LEUCOCEPHALA STEM BARK
T2  - WOOD RESEARCH
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala stem bark that was eleven years old was studied for its chemical composition and usage. The samples were subjected to chemical analyses based on ASTM standard procedures after being air-dried for several days. The results found that the bark of L. leucocephala has a pH value of 6.04 and that the solubility of the bark in 1% NaOH alkali is the highest compared to the solubility in hot water (14.45%) and cold water (14.36%), while the chemical composition of the bark of L. leucocephala was ash (15.76%); extractives (8.39%); holocellulose (132.85%); hemicellulose (103.66%); cellulose (29.19%) and lignin (38.24%). Based on the findings, L. leucocephala bark was less acidic. When used as a source of carbohydrates, bark has a high solubility, and its chemical composition may have an impact on how quickly it burns when it is pyrolysed.

TI  - Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae), an invasive species in Argentina
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ARGENTINA DE BOTANICA
AB  - Background and aims: Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) has been considered one of the 100 most invasive species on a global scale. Despite its potential threat, its introduction is increasingly being promoted for agroforestry, ornamentation, shading and handicrafts in the warm and temperate forest regions of Argentina. The threat of Leucaena populations to biodiversity has been reported worldwide, where control was not effective. The aims of the present study were to update the record of naturalized populations in Argentina and provide information on the historical and current processes of naturalization and invasion.
   M&M: The records were documented by collecting plant material in the field and examination of material housed in herbaria. Field observations were also made to observe current naturalization processes and interaction with dispersers/predators. Results: The invasive condition was confirmed in Argentina and two introduction pathways were recognized. Based on the general appearance of the groves and the microhabitat that is generated in the invaded environments, it is considered a transformer species in Argentina. The reproductive characteristics and their interaction with other strata of regional biodiversity related to the invasive process are indicated.
   Conclusions: The analysis of the herbarium labels allowed detecting that in 1921 this species was already naturalized in the country. The intervention of humans in its dispersal is discussed and future scenarios are proposed.

TI  - Rainwater harvesting and <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> biomass rates effects on soil moisture, water use efficiency and <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> [(L.) Moench] productivity in a semi-arid area in Zimbabwe
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
AB  - BACKGROUND Sorghum is one of the major staple crops in Sub Saharan Africa but its production is mainly limited by moisture stress, frequent droughts and soil infertility, especially in the smallholder farming systems. This raises the need to develop climate smart options to improve sorghum production. The objective was to assess the effects of rainwater harvesting and use of different Leucaena leucocephala biomass rates on soil moisture content, rainwater use efficiency, and stover and grain yields in two sorghum varieties (Macia and SV1). The experiment was laid as a randomized complete block design in split-split plot arrangement from 2017/2018 to 2019/2020 season. RESULTS The results show that tied contour (TC) and infiltration pits (IPs) significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil moisture content than standard contour (SC). Soil moisture content increased gradually with the increase in soil depth (20-40 cm > 0-20 cm), with 2018/2019 season having the maximum soil moisture content. Soil moisture content also increased with the increase in application rates of Leucaena biomass. Grain and stover yields were significantly (P < 0.05) increased by all Leucaena biomass application rates with higher yield observed in 2018/2019 season. SC had significantly lower grain and stover yields at all Leucaena biomass application rates. TC and IPs had comparable rainwater use efficiency compared to SC. Rainwater use efficiency increased with application rates of Leucaena biomass across all seasons and varieties. CONCLUSION TC and IPs are better adaptive mechanisms against drought spells in semi-arid areas and can be combined with 10 t ha(-1) of Leucaena biomass due to better yield increments realized.

T2  - CIENCIA ERGO-SUM
AB  - The quality of the carcass of Japanese quail previously fed with Moringa oleifera and Leucaena leucocephala, and the level of liking of the products (chorizo, brined and smoked) by residents of Santo Domingo Keste, Campeche was evaluated. Finding that the inclusion of Moringa oleifera and Leucaena leucocephala in the diet does not affect the composition of the ash, pH, protein, and humidity in the quality of the carcass. The smoked quail of the Moringa oleifera treatment presented the highest level of liking in relation to flavor, odor, and softness. Moringa oleifera foliage in quail feed improves the organoleptic characteristics in smoked meat, providing better flavor, odor, and softness, being feasible for consumption by inhabitants.

TI  - Supplementation of Water Spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) on the utilization of Mimosa pigra and Leucaena leucocephala leaf for in vitro fermentation
T2  - VETERINARY WORLD
AB  - Background and Aim: Ipomoea aquatica (Water Spinach) is the most potential for livestock growth performance, including chickens, pigs, cattle, and goats, especially in a tropical country like Cambodia. It is not only an alternative feed source but also one kind of supplemented feed for goat raising. Supplementation with Water Spinach in the utilization of low-quality tree foliage results in an increase in dry matter intake in goat production. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of supplementation of Water Spinach in the utilization of Mimosa pigra and Leucaena leucocephala leaf in in vitro fermentation.Materials and Methods: The study was designed according to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in randomized design of seven treatments with different ratios consisted of different three types of dietary treatments, including M. pigra, L. leucocephala, and Water Spinach. The treatments were arranged according to a completely randomized design and were as follow: T1 = M. pigra leaf (100%); T2 = L. leucocephala leaf (100%); T3 = M. pigra leaf and L. leucocephala leaf (50% and 50%); T4 = M. pigra leaf and Water Spinach (99.5% and 0.5%); T5 = L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach (99.5% and 0.5%); T6 = M. pigra leaf and Water Spinach (99% and 1%); and T7 = L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach (99% and 1%). A total of 200 mg (dry matter) of dietary treatments were prepared in a 60 mL syringe. Each treatment was replicated 3 time. Gas recording of each treatment lasted for 3 days. In vitro was performed for 72 h, was followed by Makkar method. Gas production was recorded at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h of incubation by using strict anaerobic technique. A mixture of rumen fluid and dietary treatments were carried out under continuous flushing with CO2 in sharking incubator at 39 degrees C. After incubating for 72 h, the ammonia concentration (NH3-N) was measured and recorded to identify pH, nutrient digestibility, and ammonia concentration (NH3-N).Results: Nutrient digestibility of the treatment with Water Spinach supplement in the utilization of L. leucocephala was obtained at a higher digestibility than treatment with M. pigra (p < 0.05). Gas production was different between groups (p < 0.05). Treatment with only M. pigra leaf had the highest gas production (A), while treatment with Water Spinach supplementation had the lowest gas production (A). At 0-24 h, the treatment with L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach 0.5% had the highest gas production, but after 24 h, M. pigra leaf and Water Spinach 1% and L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach 0.5% produced more gas compared to the other treatments (p < 0.05).Conclusion: The supplementation of Water Spinach 1% in treatment with M. pigra and L. leucocephala leaf resulted in increased degradability, gas production, and NH3-N concentration without a change in the pH value rumen condition. Based on these results, it is recommended that the level of Water Spinach supplementation should be 1% of dietary intake. Future studies should consider investigating the rumen ecology associated with Water Spinach supplementation. Feeding with Water Spinach remains a good supplement for ruminant performance; therefore, further studies should be conducted using Water Spinach in ruminant feeding in both metabolic and feeding trials.

TI  - Richness and structure of a semideciduous microphyll forest of Eastern Cuba at different cover levels of Leucaena leucocephala
T2  - REVISTA CUBANA DE CIENCIAS FORESTALES
AB  - The invasion of exotic species of natural spaces constitutes a global conservation problem. In the Siboney- Jutic & iacute; Ecological Reserve, Leucaena leucocephala is considered one of the main threats to the conservation of the semideciduous microphyll forest. The objective of this study is to characterize the richness and structure of the semideciduous microphyll forest in areas with different levels of Leucaena leucocephala coverage in that reserve. For the study, 15 plots of 400 m 2 were established at three levels of coverage of the invasive species: ABSMNI (undisturbed forests), ABSM-PI (40-60 % coverage of Leucaena leucocephala) and ABSMTI (70 % cover of Leucaena leucocephala). The number of individuals per species and their presence in each of the stratus were estimated, in addition, the height of the woody species was considered. For each of the levels studied, the specific richness, the relative abundance of the species and the floristic composition by stratus were determined; as well as the floristic similarities between each of the levels. In ABSM-NI, 55 species were recorded, in ABSM-PI 51 and in ABSM-TI 43. At the three levels of cover, the strata (tree, shrub, herbaceous) and lianas were maintained. In ABSM-TI the epiphytes were not recorded. The greatest biological similarity was between ABSM-PI and ABSM-TI; some of the shared species are ruderal and colonize areas with some type of disturbance. The main transformation was in the composition and abundance of the species as the coverage of the invasive species increased. In ABSM-TI, the specific richness and abundance/cover of secondary vegetation species increased, to the detriment of other typical forest species. In the sites with the greatest coverage of the invasive species, a decrease in the specific composition and height of the tree stratus occurs. At this site, an increase in the specific composition of the shrub and herbaceous strata was also observed. Epiphytes were only recorded in ABSM-NI and ABSM-PI.

T2  - 3 BIOTECH
AB  - This study aimed at energy reduction during pulping of L. leucocephala by passing the wood chips through an impressafiner followed by xylanase pretreatment. An impressafiner compressed the chips and converted them into spongy materials. Wood chips of L. leucocephala with or without de-structuring and de-structured wood chips followed by enzymatic treatment were subjected to Kraft pulping at different temperatures varying from 135 to 170 degrees C and active alkali varying from 12 to 20% (as Na2O) to observe effect on screened pulp yield and kappa number. The de-structured wood chips followed by enzymatic treatment produced a pulp yield of 48.2% and kappa number 18.6. L. leucocephala without de-structuring produced a pulp yield of 50.1% and kappa number 23.7. When the pulp was subjected to oxygen delignification to reduce kappa number in the vicinity of 18.6, pulp showed shrinkage by 6.64% compared to Kraft pulp of de-structured wood chips followed by enzymatic treatment. Kraft pulp produced from de-structured wood chips of L. leucocephala followed by enzymatic treatment showed net saving of US$ 163.15 per digester over Kraft pulp produced without de-structuring of wood chips of L. leucocephala. Moreover, the pulp obtained by de-structuring followed by enzymatic treatment showed improvement in pulp brightness and physical strength properties including tensile, tear, and burst index significantly compared to pulp obtained without de-structuring.

TI  - Carbon storage and sequestration rates in Leucaena leucocephala-based silvopasture in Southern Mexico
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Agroforestry practices that include trees on grazing lands could enhance atmospheric CO2 sequestration and storage. However, carbon sequestration rates and storage capacity of intensively grazed agroforestry systems vary due to the diversity in species composition, stand structure, system age, and management practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate carbon stocks and accrual rates in Leucaena leucocephala + Cynadon plectostachyus, and Brachiaria decumbens grass silvopastoral systems and compare them with conventional open grazing lands. The study was carried out in Chiapas in southern Mexico, one of the hotspots of deforestation driven by the expansion of livestock farming. We measured above- and belowground carbon stocks in 18 silvopasture (SP) plots, with the plantation age ranging from 2 to 10 years. Nine plots of adjacent conventional full-sun grasslands (open pasturelands) grazed rotationally were sampled for comparison. The average tree biomass stock in SP was 5.5 +/- 1.9 Mg C ha(-1) and differed with SP age. Mean annual biomass accrual rates ranged from 0.25 to 2.57 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), indicating that SP systems are CO2 sinks, excluding other sources of GHG such as methane emissions from enteric fermentation. The average soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rate of SP was 0.143 +/- 0.043 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) to 50 cm depth. The SOC sequestration rates correlated positively with SP age at the beginning and decreased after about 8 years. The results suggested that the age and lifespan of trees play a significant role in aboveground C sequestration through the Leucaena leucocephala SP, while SOC storage varied with soil properties. Further research on the relative response of active and stable SOC fractions along with soil CO2 fluxes could explain the results on the SOC storage potential of these agroforestry systems.

TI  - <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> oil-based poly malate-amide nanocomposite coating material for anticorrosive applications
T2  - E-POLYMERS
AB  - This article describes the synthesis of polyesteramide (PEA) resin from Leucaena leucocephala oil (LLO) obtained from seeds of L. leucocephala tree, locally grown in King Saud University Campus. LLO was transformed into amide diol by based catalyzed amidation reaction, followed by esterification reaction with malic acid (MA), that resulted in LLO-based PEA (LPEA). The synthesis was performed without using any solvent or catalyst. Fourier-transformation infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the formation of LPEA by the introduction of amide and ester moieties. LPEA was further reinforced with nano graphene oxide (GO) and fabricated into nanocomposite corrosion protective coatings (LPEA/GO). LPEA/GO coatings obtained were tough, flexibility retentive and showed good corrosion resistance performance toward 3.5 w/w% NaCl medium. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed good thermal stability of coatings with safe usage up to 200 degrees C.

TI  - <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> (Fabaceae) Invasion: The Opposite Effects of Fire and Flood
T2  - WETLANDS
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (hereafter L. leucocephala) is considered one of the 100 most invasive plant species in the world and has been found in areas subject to wildfire events and flooding. Its rapid L. leucocephala invasion capacity can lead to decrease in local diversity due to the exclusion of native plant species. In this way, the L. leucocephala proliferation has advanced across the Pantanal. Here, we assess the effects of the fire, flooding and distance to the source population on the invasion of L. leucocephala, and whether this dynamic negatively affects the richness of native plant species in the Brazilian Pantanal. Our results showed that fire recurrence and flood level were the opposite under L. leucocephala invasion. Areas with low flood level and greater fire occurrence tend to have more L. leucocephala regenerants while the distance of the source population had no effect. L. leucocephala and native plants occupy sites with different abiotic conditions. In an expected scenario for the Pantanal islonger droughts and more frequent wildfire, this could mean a pronounced increase in L. leucocephala invasion over time. Therefore, the use of fire as a management action for L. leucocephala control is not recommended, and it is necessary to find methods to extract or eliminate the seed banks.

AB  - In this study, four experimental treatments were evaluated: (T1) alfalfa hay + concentrate, (50:50%, DM); (T2) alfalfa hay + Leucaena leucocephala + concentrate, (30:20:50%, DM); (T3) alfalfa hay + prickly pear + concentrate, (30:20:50%, DM); and (T4) alfalfa hay + Leucaena leucocephala + prickly pear + concentrate, (30:10:10:50%, DM). NH3-N concentrations in T2 and T4 decreased when replaced with alfalfa hay in 20 and 10%, respectively. Treatments did not affect the concentration of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) between T3 and T4 (p > 0.05), while the concentrations among T1 and T2 were different (p < 0.05). T2 showed a reduction of 25.5% in the methane production when compared to T1 (p < 0.05). The lowest concentrations of protozoa were observed in T2 and T4, which contained Leucaena leucocephala (T2) and Leucaena leucocephala + prickly pear (T4) (p < 0.05). The highest concentration of total methanogens was recorded in T1 and was different in T2, T3, and T4 (p < 0.05). Leucaena leucocephala, at an inclusion percentage of 20%, decreased the methane when compared to T1, whereas prickly pear increased methane production in relation to T1.

TI  - Leucaena leucocephala succinate based polyelectrolyte complexes for colon delivery of synbiotic in management of inflammatory bowel disease
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) formed by the interaction between oppositely charged polymers have emerged as promising carriers for accomplishing colon-specific release. In this study, we have explored the potential of polyelectrolyte complexes between a succinate derivative of Leucaena leucocephala galactomannan and cationic guar gum for colon delivery of synbiotic. The PECs were prepared using a polyelectrolyte complexation method and characterized. The PECs exhibited excellent stability, with high encapsulation efficiency for both probiotics (95.53 %) and prebiotics (83.33 %). In vitro studies demonstrated enhanced survivability and proliferation of the encapsulated probiotics in the presence of prebiotics (93.29 %). The SEM images revealed a smooth and firm structure with reduced number of pores when both prebiotic and probiotic were encapsulated together. The treatment with synbiotic PECs in acetic acid induced IBD rats significantly relieves colitis symptoms as was evident from colon/body ratio, DAI score and histopathology studies. An increase in the protein and reduced glutathione levels and reduction in superoxide dismutase activity was observed in colitic rats that received synbiotic treatment as compared to colitic rats. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Leucaena leucocephala succinate-cationic guar gum PECs as a promising system for colon-specific synbiotic delivery, with implications for improved gut health and the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  - Root development in <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> (Lam.) de Wit enhances copper accumulation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Potentially toxic elements (PTE) in soil like copper (Cu) have been common in agricultural and mining areas worldwide. The sustainable remediation of these areas has been shown to have high socio-environmental relevance and phytoremediation is one of the green technologies to be considered. The challenge is to identify species that are tolerant to PTE, and to assess their phytoremediation potential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological response of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and to determine the species tolerance and phytoremediation potential to concentrations of Cu in the soil (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/dm(3)). The photosynthetic rate was not affected, while the content of chlorophylls decreased as Cu concentrations increased. There was an increased in stomatal conductance and water use efficiency from the treatment of 300. The root biomass and the length were bigger than the shoots, in the treatments above 300. Cu accumulation was greater in the roots than in the shoot of the plants, thus, the Cu translocation index to the shoot was lower. The ability to absorb and accumulate, mainly, Cu in the roots, allowed the development and growth of plants, since the parameters of photosynthesis and biomass accumulation were not affected by the Cu excess. This accumulation in the roots is characterized as a strategy for the phytostabilization of Cu. Therefore, L. leucocephala is tolerant to the Cu concentrations evaluated and has a potential phytoremediation of Cu in the soil.

TI  - Integrated catalytic pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading of<i> Leucaena</i><i> leucocephala</i> over natural catalysts
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ENERGY INSTITUTE
AB  - Catalysts are used to improve the properties of the bio-oil produced through biomass pyrolysis. In this study, natural minerals, such as natural zeolite and dolomite, were used for the catalytic upgrading of the pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala. Pyrolysis was performed using an in-house designed fluidized bed system wherein the catalyst beds can be placed in two locations. Dolomite and zeolite catalyst beds were placed in the primary fluidized bed and/or secondary hot filter reactors. Four catalyst configurations were utilized in this study. The effects of the type and location of the catalyst on the catalytic activity and product selectivity were investigated. The highest light bio-oil fraction was obtained using the dolomite catalyst situated at the primary and secondary reactors. On the other hand, the configuration in which the natural zeolite catalyst was placed in the two reactors produced heavy bio-oil that was mainly composed of hydrocarbons. The viscosity, flash point, and fly point of the bio-oil produced in this work fall within the standard values for fuel oils. In particular, the viscosity of the bio-oil produced using the catalysts was lower by 60% of that of the product obtained through noncatalytic biomass pyrolysis. The pyrolysis system employed in this study is a promising technology for catalytic biomass pyrolysis processes.

AB  - This research is part of knowledge management and value-added transmission of goat production for sus-tainable career promotion and community food security. The objective of this study was to investigate how fresh leucaena and the effect of different sources of leucaena on growth performance and meat quality in indigenous Anglo-Nubian hybrid goats ale after weaning, with an average weight starting at approximately 15 kg, were divided into 5 groups of 4 with 4 repetitions each. The research was allotted in five into five groups of four repeats each. Treatment 1 received pangola grass as a crude feed source, treatment 2 re-ceived leucaena as a 25% feed substitute, treatment 3 received leucaena as a crude feed substitute at level 50%, treatment 4 received leucaena as a feed substitute at level 75, and treatment 5 received leucaena as a 100% coarse feed substitute. Leucaena was able to raise goats at a rate of 75-100%. The average daily gain, feed cost per gain of 1 kg, and blood-urea-nitrogen (BUN) values after 4 hours of feeding were the best and higher than the BUN values of the other groups. The difference in values was statistically significant. (P < 0.05), and use in percentages 50-100 did not affect the final weight, total weight gain, dry matter con-tent, protein intake, total feed conversion ratio (FCR), dry matter intake (DMI) to percentage body weight (BW), feed cost per gain, economic loss index, production performance index, salable head return, carcass characteristics, quality and chemical composition of meat, or meat acceptance according to research results. The difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).

TI  - Allelopathy and Allelochemicals of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> as an Invasive Plant Species
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit is native to southern Mexico and Central America and is now naturalized in more than 130 countries. The spread of L. leucocephala is probably due to its multipurpose use such as fodder, timber, paper pulp, shade trees, and soil amendment. However, the species is listed in the world's 100 worst invasive alien species, and an aggressive colonizer. It forms dense monospecific stands and threatens native plant communities, especially in oceanic islands. Phytotoxic chemical interactions such as allelopathy have been reported to play an important role in the invasion of several invasive plant species. Possible evidence for allelopathy of L. leucocephala has also been accumulated in the literature over 30 years. The extracts, leachates, root exudates, litter, decomposing residues, and rhizosphere soil of L. leucocephala increased the mortality and suppressed the germination and growth of several plant species, including weeds and woody plants. Those observations suggest that L. leucocephala is allelopathic and contains certain allelochemicals. Those allelochemicals may release into the rhizosphere soil during decomposition process of the plant residues and root exudation. Several putative allelochemicals such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and mimosine were identified in L. leucocephala. The species produces a large amount of mimosine and accumulates it in almost all parts of the plants, including leaves, stems, seeds, flowers, roots, and root nodules. The concentrations of mimosine in these parts were 0.11 to 6.4% of their dry weight. Mimosine showed growth inhibitory activity against several plant species, including some woody plants and invasive plants. Mimosine blocked cell division of protoplasts from Petunia hybrida hort. ex E. Vilm. between G(1) and S phases, and disturbed the enzyme activity such as peroxidase, catalase, and IAA oxidase. Some of those identified compounds in L. leucocephala may be involved in its allelopathy. Therefore, the allelopathic property of L. leucocephala may support its invasive potential and formation of dense monospecific stands. However, the concentrations of mimosine, phenolic acids, and flavonoids in the vicinity of L. leucocephala, including its rhizosphere soil, have not yet been reported.

TI  - The soil response in experimental <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> plots under manipulated rainfall regimes
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, a prominent invasive woody plant in India, is constantly recognised for its capacity to invade in various ecosystems. The chances of invasion by L. leucocephala are increasing due to rainfall variability, to which the plant has already adapted. However, the understanding of L. leucocephala, particularly its response to soil attributes and alterations in nutrient cycling processes under varying rainfall conditions, is currently inadequate. In response to the perceived threat of rainfall shift and invasion impacting native plant species through soil modification, the study was designed to investigate the interplay between L. leucocephala invasion and simulated rainfall conditions. The experimental setup included three rainout shelter plots receiving different precipitation levels (low, normal, and high) and subplots within each plot dedicated to pure stands of L. leucocephala. The study findings reveal significant variations in soil inorganic nitrogen and N-mineralization based on precipitation levels and seasons, with the highest values observed in the high rainfall plot and during the rainy season. In contrast, microbial biomass (carbon and nitrogen) peaked in the low rainfall plot and during the summer season, indicating a contrasting trend. The implications of the study suggest that, in addition to variable rainfall, L. leucocephala may play a significant role in altering nutrient cycling, particularly nitrogen cycling. The plant enhances soil properties related to nitrogen availability, creating opportunities for multiple invasions and potentially leading to a chance of "Invasion Meltdown," with a significant threat to native biodiversity. Overall, the research is emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics to formulate effective management strategies for preserving native ecosystems.

TI  - Heterologous expression and characterization of a thermoalkaliphilic SAM-synthetase from giant leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala subsp glabrata)
T2  - PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The cDNA encoding S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase was isolated from giant leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata) root tissue mRNA. Transcriptome data and 5 '-RLM-RACE were used to obtain the transcript sequence and clone into the T7-expression vector pEt14b. N-terminal Histidine-tagged recombinant protein was expressed highly in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized by activity assays. A straightforward method using isocratic reverse-phase HPLC analysis (mobile phase: 0.02M o-phosphoric acid) of enzyme assays determined optimal enzyme activity at pH 10.0, 55 degrees C and 200 mM KCl. In addition to thermophilic activity, giant leucaena SAM-synthetase remains highly active in solutions containing up to 4 M KCl and accepts Na+ to some extent as a substitute for K+, a known required cofactor for SAM-synthetases. The enzyme followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km = 1.82 mM, Kcat = 1.17 s- 1, Vmax 243.9 mu M. min-1) and was not inhibited by spermidine, spermine or nicotianamine. Giant leucaena SAM-synthetase is a highly tolerant enzyme to extreme conditions, suggesting further studies on plant SAM-synthetases.

TI  - Seed germination ecology of leucaena (<i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>) as influenced by various environmental parameters
T2  - WEED SCIENCE
AB  - Leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] is a perennial weed in more than 25 countries, including Australia. Knowledge regarding the seed biology of L. leucocephala could help in making weed management decisions. Experiments were conducted to study the effect of hot water (scarification), alternating temperatures, heat stress, salt stress, water stress, and burial depth on seed germination of two populations of L. leucocephala collected from Toowoomba and Gatton, Australia. The optimum duration of hot water treatment to break the hard seed coat dormancy was 2 min for both populations. The highest germination (92% to 98%) was recorded at 35/25 C for both populations, and similar germination occurred at 30/20 C. The Toowoomba population recorded greater germination at low temperature (15/5 to 25/15 C) than the Gatton population. Additionally, the Gatton population had higher germination than the Toowoomba population after 5 min of exposure to temperatures of up to 100 C, suggesting that the Gatton population may be more tolerant to heat stress. Germination was completely inhibited at pretreatment (5 min) temperatures of 150 to 250 C. The Toowoomba population recorded 17% greater germination than the Gatton population at a high salt concentration (160 mM NaCl), indicating its greater salt tolerance. At low moisture stress (-0.1 and -0.2 MPa), higher germination was observed in the Toowoomba population than in the Gatton population, whereas germination was similar for both populations at higher water stress levels (-0.4 MPa or lower). Germination was similar for both populations at shallow depths (0 and 1 cm) but higher emergence was recorded for the Toowoomba population at 2 to 8 cm than the Gatton population. Differential germination behaviors of both populations suggest that they adapted differently in their respective local environments. Knowledge gained from this study will help in formulating integrated management practices for L. leucocephala.

TI  - Silicon application and mycorrhiza inoculation promoted <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> growth in a soil highly contaminated by manganese
T2  - NATIVA
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can increase the acquisition of silicon (Si) and, therefore, alleviate the problems caused by metallic toxicity in plants, but this effect remains poorly understood. The objective was to evaluate the influence of Si application on the growth of Leucaena leucocephala inoculated with AMF (Claroideoglomus etunicatum) in a soil contaminated by manganese (Mn). We exposed plants to increasing levels of Si (0, 100, 200 and 400 mg kg-1) in the soil for 90 days. Intermediate levels of Si and AMF inoculation significantly increased shoot and root dry mass, the number of sheets, root system length and mycorrhizal colonization. The abundance of AMF spores decreased linearly with increasing levels of Si applied to the soil, suggesting a low correlation with mycorrhizal colonization. In addition to the higher Mn contents in the shoots and, mainly, in the roots, the combined application of Si and inoculation with AMF significantly reduced foliar toxicity by more than 40%, when compared to the absence of Si and AMF inoculation. Our results demonstrated a synergistic effect of AMF and Si in improving the growth and tolerance of L. leucocephala plants in soil contaminated by Mn.

TI  - Optimizing pyrolysis parameters and product analysis of a fluidized bed pilot plant for Leucaena leucocephala biomass
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
AB  - This study aimed to optimize the production of bio-oil from Leucaena leucocephala wood using a fluidized bed reactor. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the fast pyrolysis through three operational parameters: pyrolysis temperature, nitrogen flow rate, and temperature of the first condensation stage. The optimum conditions obtained for bio-oil production were 500 degrees C, 26.4 L min(-1), that is, about 3.3 times the minimum fluidization flow, and 80 degrees C, respectively. The bio-oil obtained under optimum conditions was of good quality and did not require further treatment. Physical properties of the bio-oil were analysed according to ASTM D7544-12. In addition, the chemical composition of the non-condensed gases and bio-oil were identified using GC-MS. The non-condensed gases were found to contain mainly ketones and lignin derivatives, while the bio-oil contained cyclic ketones, alcohol ethers, aromatic alcohols, and lignin derivatives. The study found that increasing the pyrolysis temperature did not significantly increase the yield of H-2 and CO for syngas production. Regarding the solid obtained, a large amount of unreacted material (66.7 wt.%) is generated at 400 degrees C, and as the temperature is increased, a high-quality biochar is obtained.

TI  - Protein and iron source snack bar made from <i>Mlanding</i> Tempeh - A fermented <i>Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala)</i>
T2  - FUTURE OF FOOD-JOURNAL ON FOOD AGRICULTURE AND SOCIETY
AB  - Mlanding Tempeh is an Indonesian fermented food made from Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala), a tropical legume that contains complete nutrients. The legume has high productivity and adapts well to dry climates thus serving well as a plant-based protein source in arid areas to improve the local food security. This is especially true for Indonesian male adolescents who often suffer from undernutrition. This study aimed to introduce a process to further improve the nutritional value and potential acceptance of the Mlanding Tempeh by developing it into a snack bar. A complete food process development and nutrient analysis were performed. Analysis of anti-nutrient content found a reduction of tannins after 24h fermentation of Lamtoro, from 52.11 to 4.20 (mg. tannic acid). Frying and oven-baked method was chosen for processing the Tempeh into the snack bar. Formulation with 60% Mlanding Tempeh, 35% red kidney beans, and 5% puffed rice had the highest acceptance and preference score. The energy and nutrients such as protein, fat, and carbohydrates content in 100 g of snack bars were 385.44 kcal, 17.62 g, 3.18 g, and 71.58 g, respectively. A 100 g of snack bar provided around 29% of the daily protein and 22.27% of iron needs for male adolescents. Hence, the Mlanding Tempeh snack bar can be considered a good source of protein and iron for this demography. In addition, it also has high dietary fibre.

TI  - Sustainable approach from underutilized <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> biomass by polyphenols composition and protein functional properties assessment
T2  - CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB  - The seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (LL), a legume tree native to Mexico, are traditionally harvested and utilized as food ingredients in regional dishes. In this study, the usefulness of LL biomass was investigated and processed in flours using the wholegrain seed (WS) and pods for polyphenols identification, whereas the cotyledon (CT) for protein concentrates functional characterization was used. The WS flour exhibited carbohydrates as the main macronutrient, followed by proteins (30.59%). Water-extracted polyphenols from pods flour (544.29 mg/L) were higher compared to the WS flour (165.85 mg/L). The predominant polyphenols in all samples were flavonols, specifically catechins. Although, in comparison to the mixtures of methanol-water (315.14 mg/L) and ethanol-water (471.22 mg/L), pods had about threefold polyphenols content than WS flours extracts. Protein fractionation in CT was higher than in WS flour, with globulins being the most abundant fraction in both materials (44.73 and 55.2%, respectively). Structural analyzes indicated a higher presence of structural elements in globulins, evident in FTIR spectra and SDS-PAGE analysis. Globulins displayed bands around 50, 37, and 22 kDa, while glutelins exhibited a unique band at 50 kDa. Globulins also demonstrated a higher essential amino acid content. The functional properties of globulins and glutelins were pH-dependent. Globulins solubility (72.53%), emulsifying (35.13%), foaming (138.66%), water holding (3.17 g/g), and oil absorption (1.20 g/g) capacities were higher compared to glutelins (62.42%, 31.69%, 66.70%, 2.86 g/g, and 0.52 g/g, respectively). These findings suggest that LL biomass holds potential as a sustainable source of natural ingredients for food development.

TI  - Increasing the proportion of Leucaena leucocephala in hay-fed beef steers reduces methane yield
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB  - Context Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a leguminous shrub adapted to higher rainfall (>600 mm) in frost-free areas of Australia. It can be a source of high-quality forage for cattle grazing tropical grass-based pastures that are seasonally deficient in the nitrogen content required for adequate levels of performance. Leucaena contains bioactive compounds that may reduce methanogenesis in the rumen, helping to achieve Australia's goal to make red meat production carbon neutral by 2030. Aim A study was undertaken to evaluate the response in animal performance and methane production to increasing percentages of leucaena in a hay-based diet. Methods Growing steers were fed diets containing 0%, 18%, 36% and 48% leucaena. Intake, liveweight gain, methane production and yield were measured in a cross-over trial with two modern cultivars of leucaena (Redlands and Wondergraze). Methane was measured in open-circuit respiration chambers. Key results There were no effects of cultivar on most parameters. Increasing leucaena percentage in the diet increased dry matter intake, animal performance and methane production (g/day) but reduced methane yield (g/kg dry matter intake) according to the equation: methane yield = 19.8 - 0.09 x leucaena percentage in the diet. The inclusion of polyethylene glycol to nullify potential antimethanogenic activity of tannins restored methane yield by 67%, indicating that tannins were responsible for most of the observed reduction in methane yield. Conclusion The results demonstrate that leucaena can improve animal performance and reduce methane yield in steers fed low-quality grasses. Implications Leucaena can be included in diets of grazing cattle in areas agronomically suited to its production, as a means to reduce enteric methane emissions.

TI  - Advanced Anticorrosive Graphene Oxide-Doped Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Nanocomposite Coating Derived from <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> Oil
T2  - POLYMERS
AB  - Metal corrosion poses a substantial economic challenge in a technologically advanced world. In this study, novel environmentally friendly anticorrosive graphene oxide (GO)-doped organic-inorganic hybrid polyurethane (LFAOIH@GO-PU) nanocomposite coatings were developed from Leucaena leucocephala oil (LLO). The formulation was produced by the amidation reaction of LLO to form diol fatty amide followed by the reaction of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and a dispersion of GO(x) (X = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 wt%) along with the reaction of isophorane diisocyanate (IPDI) (25-40 wt%) to form LFAOIH@GO(x)-PU35 nanocomposites. The synthesized materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); H-1, C-13, and Si-29 nuclear magnetic resonance; and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A detailed examination of LFAOIH@GO(0.5)-PU35 morphology was conducted using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. These studies revealed distinctive surface roughness features along with a contact angle of around 88 G.U preserving their structural integrity at temperatures of up to 235 C-degrees with minimal loading of GO. Additionally, improved mechanical properties, including scratch hardness (3 kg), pencil hardness (5H), impact resistance, bending, gloss value (79), crosshatch adhesion, and thickness were evaluated with the dispersion of GO. Electrochemical corrosion studies, involving Nyquist, Bode, and Tafel plots, provided clear evidence of the outstanding anticorrosion performance of the coatings.

TI  - The application of wasted <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> seed pods as a bio-based adsorbent for decolourization of solution
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The adsorption method is widely used in water and wastewater treatment; however, most industrial adsorbents are expensive, limiting the use of the adsorption method in developing countries. Therefore, this study aims at developing a biosorbent from the wasted Leucaena leucocephala seed pods (LLSP) and apply it (as a cost-effective bio-adsorbent) to remove Janus Green B dye (JGBD) from solutions at different values of pH, agitation time, LLSP dose and JGBD concentration. Different techniques were used to characterize LLSP before and after JGBD removal, including pore size distribution, surface area (S-BET) analysis, FTIR, SEM, SPM and the point of zero charges (pH(pzc)) of the LLSP surface. The results proved that LLSP could remove up to 95% of JGBD at pH, LLSP dose, JGBD concentration and agitation time of 9, 0.08 g/100 ml, 50 mg/l and 30 min, respectively. Langmuir and Freundlich were applied to fit the data of equilibrium biosorption, and it was noticed that the Langmuir isotherm model fits the data, and the full monolayer biosorption ability for JGBD was 142.85 mg/g.

TI  - Production and nutritional value of<i> Pleurotus</i><i> floridanus</i> grown on rice straw supplemented with<i> Leucaena</i><i> leucocephala</i> foliage
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB  - Edible mushrooms are increasingly recognized to offer health, environmental and socio-economical benefits across the globe. However, long cultivation time and low nutritional value of harvested mushrooms have remained the limiting factors for taping the benefits and sustainable production in developing counties. There is therefore a need to seek for alternative substrate formulations that would shorten cultivation time, increase the nutritional value of mushrooms as well as ensure environmental sustainability. This study examined the potential of using nutrient and biomass rich Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit foliage in combination with the rice straw (traditional substrate) to bolster production and nutritional value of Pleurotus floridanus mushroom in Morogoro, Tanzania. Mushrooms were grown in 30 x 40 cm 1.6 kg dry weight polythene bags in a randomized complete block design experiment with five treatments. The shortest cultivation period (average of 21 days) which stemmed largely from spawning to full mycelia colonization was attained when 5% Leucaena foliage was mixed with the rice straw. There was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in protein content from 23.3 to a maximum of 29.8%, when rice straw was supplemented with the 5% Leucaena, while further increase in Leucaena supple-mentation caused a lowering of crude protein content. There were significant increases (P < 0.05) in the contents of copper and calcium minerals when 5% of Leucaena foliage was incorporated into the growing substrate. Thus, to increase production cycle and contents of protein and essential minerals, addition of 5% of L. leucocephala foliage is recommended during production of P. floridanus using rice straw, for sustainability.

TI  - Comparative study of the combustion, pyrolysis and gasification processes of Leucaena leucocephala: Kinetics and gases obtained
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a fast-growing leguminous biomass with great energetical and valueadded chemical compounds potential (saccharides, biogas, bio-oil, etc.). Using the thermogravimetric and derivative thermogravimetric curves, the different trends followed by L. leucocephala during pyrolysis, 0.25 equivalence ratio (ER) of gasification, 0.50 equivalence ratio of gasification and combustion were analyzed, and the activation energies were obtained by Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM) method. Gas samples were collected through adsorption tubes during the gasification at 0.25 ER and 0.50 ER to observe the distribution of the main chemical products in this process by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and were compared with pyrolysis products. It was found that small amounts of oxygen have changes in the kinetics of the process, leading to significant decreases in the activation energy at the beginning of the degradation of components such as cellulose (from 170 to 135 kJ mol- 1 at 0.25 conversion at 0.50 ER gasification). The activation energy of lignin disintegration was also reduced (342 kJ mol-1), assimilating the beginnings of gasification processes such as the Boudouard reaction. 0.50 ER gasification is potentially an interesting process to obtain quality bio-oil, since a large amount of hexane is detected (44.96%), and value-added oxygenated intermediates such as alcohols and glycols. Gasification at 0.25 ER, on the other hand, is much more similar to pyrolysis, obtaining a wide variety of short-chain compounds resulting from the disintegration of the main lignocellulosic components, especially ketones such as 1-hydroxypropan-2-one (19.48%), and notable amount of furans and anhydrosugars like d-allose (5.50%).

TI  - Climate change and the potential distribution of the invasive shrub, <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> (Lam.) De Wit in Africa
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, previously known as 'miracle tree' because of its numerous agroforestry uses has become a serious invasive species in tropical regions. Despite the risks associated with the spread of L. leucocephala, changes in its distribution with respect to climate are poorly understood, particularly in Africa where it has been widely introduced in more than 30 countries. To provide first-line information for the management of L. leucocephala, we examined its potential distribution in Africa using ecological niche modelling. We identified bioclimatic variables that determine the global distribution of L. leucocephala, and calibrated niche models using MaxEnt and species occurrences recorded between 1973 and 2013. The potential distribution of this species was estimated from model projections in Africa based on current and future climatic conditions. We tested the hypothesis of niche conservatism for L. leucocephala by comparing its climatic niche in Africa to that of its native range. Under current conditions, L. leucocephala is constrained between 30 degrees S and 20 degrees N in Africa, with the broadest distribution in East Africa. High rainfall areas in Central Africa with no known records of this species hitherto, were found to be highly suitable for its establishment. We predicted a significant decrement in the extent of areas at risk of invasion by L. Leucocephala under changing climates in Africa. Our results revealed that the study species occupies a similar but non-identical climatic niche in Africa in relation to its native niche. Climate change is likely to impede the spread of L. leucocephala in Africa.

TI  - Seed hydration memory in the invasive alien species Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) in the Caatinga
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Seed hydration memory is an adaptive strategy for plants in semiarid environments where water availability is irregular and unpredictable. Species native to these environments that have memory benefit from discontinuous hydration during their germination process and acquire tolerance to environmental stresses. The guiding question of this study is "does an alien species that invades a semiarid ecosystem also have seed hydration memory and benefit from discontinuous hydration?" To answer this question, we collected seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, an alien species that invades a Brazilian Tropical Dry Forest. We subjected the seeds to 0, 1, 2 and 3 hydration/dehydration cycles (HD cycles) at three different time intervals and, subsequently, to water, saline and thermal stresses. In addition, we used modeling to define the osmotic and thermal limits for occurrence of L. leucocephala and evaluated whether these limits increase after discontinuous hydration of seeds. The cycles of HD positively influenced the germination of seeds submitted to all stresses evaluated, increasing seed tolerance to treatments of water, saline, and thermal stresses. Discontinuous hydration increased the osmotic limits of salinity and thermal tolerance, although not increasing the osmotic limit of water deficit. Our results show that HD cycles also change the patterns of germinative responses of an invasive species to the environmental stresses of the invaded ecosystem.

TI  - Chemical Composition in Juvenile and Mature Wood of Branch and Main Trunk of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> (Lam.) de Wit
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Secondary growth is the most dynamic developmental aspect during the terrestrialization of plants. The development of secondary xylem tissue composed of thick-walled cells with characteristic changes in its structure and chemistry facilitates the growth and development of woody plants. In the present study, the chemical composition of the secondary xylem of juvenile and mature wood from the branch and main trunk of Leucaena leucocephala, has been investigated and the differences established. The biochemical analysis of different cell wall components in the mature wood of the main trunk revealed high holocellulose and alpha-cellulose and less lignin content in the juvenile wood while its syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio was less than for the mature wood. As compared to the branch xylem, concentration of cell wall polysaccharides and lignin content was higher in both juvenile and mature wood collected from the main trunk. Thioacidolysis and GC-MS analysis of wood lignin from juvenile and mature wood showed that an increased concentration in lignin content in mature wood is associated with a corresponding increase in S/G ratio. The structural information of the acetylated lignin was investigated by H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Our results indicate that the mature wood from the main trunk is superior in pulp yielding and lignin degradability as compared to the juvenile wood of the branch and trunk.

TI  - Antihyperglycemic Potential of Quercetin-3-glucoside Isolated from <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> Seedpods via the SIRT1/AMPK/GLUT4 Signaling Cascade
T2  - ACS OMEGA
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala. (Lam.) de Wit, a traditional medicinal plant, has been reported among the ethnic communities of Mexico, Indonesia, China, and India for the treatment of diabetes, obesity, and related complications. This study investigates the antihyperglycemic activity of the plant and its isolated active compound quercetin-3-glucoside. Further, bioactivity guided marker assisted development of an enriched bioactive fraction toward enhancing insulin sensitization was carried out. The enriched fraction was also found to contain 397.96 mg/g of quercetin-3-glucoside along with three other marker compounds, which were also isolated and identified. Quercetin-3-glucoside, out of the four isolated marker compounds from the plant, showed the most significant bioactivity when tested in palmitate-induced insulin-resistant C2C12 myotubes. The compound also showed significant upregulation of sirtuin1 (SIRT1) followed by enhancement of insulin-dependent signaling molecules SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1-alpha and GLUT4 translocation. Molecular dynamics studies showed the compound having stable interactions with the SIRT1 protein. SIRT1 upregulation has been associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, increasing the glucose uptake by muscle cells. The prepared enriched fraction also modulated the SIRT1/AMPK/GLUT4 pathway. The findings of the present study may find future application toward the development of botanical or phytopharmaceutical drugs from the traditionally important plant L. leucocephala against type II diabetes.

TI  - Thinning enhances success of enrichment planting with selected tree species under a pure stand of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Increasing the biodiversity of Leucaena leucocephala (hereafter leucaena) stands without losing the benefits provided by the forest structure is a challenge for adaptive management. Here, we report the survival and growth (height, stem, and canopy diameter) of five Atlantic Forest tree species planted underneath a pure stand of the exotic leucaena, which was broadcast sown 35 years before in a 0.6 ha area. Two treatments were compared: thinning (cutting all leucaena trees in 4-m wide rows, where seedlings were planted) and control (seedlings planted under leucaena canopy), with four replicates each (20 seedlings per plot, four per species, 2-m spaced). The five species selected were long-lived emergent trees from seasonal forests, with broad canopy, evergreen, and shade-tolerant. These traits were expected to allow their survival and growth, and, later on, to shade out the leucaena trees. Seven years after planting, survival was high for all species (around 80%), not differing between treatments or species. On average, stem diameter, height, and crown diameter were, respectively, 69, 44, and 36% higher in thinned than in control plots. Response to thinning differed between species in growth, with Gallesia integrifolia and Luehea divaricata standing out. Our results demonstrate that the species used for enrichment planting, selected by their suitable functional traits, can successfully survive under leucaena stands. Reducing competition by thinning, however, is crucial to enhance their growth. Despite the benefits from thinning, enrichment success strongly depends, therefore, on the abilities of the species selected to face the ecological filters acting on the target ecosystem.

TI  - Inoculation with rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in Leucaena leucocephala plants in nursery phase in a neutral pH substrate
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the simple and combined inoculation with three local rhizobia isolates (R1, R2 and R3) and two species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomus cubense -AMF1-and Claroideoglomus claroideum-AMF2-) on mycorrhizal colonization, nodulation, growth and biomass production of Leucaena leucocephala in a substrate with a close to neutral pH under greenhouse conditions. Thirteen treatments were evaluated in a completely randomized design with five replications. The inoculation and co-inoculation promoted greater plant growth with respect to the control without inoculation and to the fertilization treatment. Within the inoculation and co-inoculation treatments, one rhizobium isolate (R2) stood out for producing the highest plant height and leaflet production, while the R3 + AMF1 and R3 + AMF2 combinations promoted the highest plant height, and also promoted higher biomass together with R1 + AMF1. In addition, the R3 + AMF2 combination stood out for presenting a high number of AMF spores, frequency and intensity by AMF colonization, and nodule activity. It is concluded that inoculation with local rhizobia isolates and their combination with AMF favors the development of mycorrhizal structures, nodulation, growth and biomass production of L. leucocephala grown in a substrate with neutral pH. Isolate R2 and the combination R3 + AMF2 were identified as effective inoculants to increase plant growth.

TI  - Growth and pulpwood traits of<i> Leucaena</i><i> leucocephala</i> and<i> Eucalyptus</i><i> camaldulensis</i> at rainfed and irrigated sites in southern India
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Growth and wood traits of Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata were compared with India's most widely grown pulpwood, Eucalyptus. Three Leucaena seedlots and sixty-four Leucaena clones selected in plantations established from two Indian land races and a Hawaiian seed source were tested together with five commercial E. camaldulensis clones at two contrasting sites in southern India. At the wetter, irrigated site, the three sources of Leucaena clones had significantly greater 4-year height and similar mean stem diameter to the Eucalyptus clones, while the Leucaena seedlots were slower-growing. At the semi-arid, rainfed site, Eucalyptus grew faster and had better survival than the three sources of Leucaena clones, which again were similar in their performance and superior to the Leucaena seedlots. Basic densities, determined from breast-height wood cores, of 4-year-old Leucaena and Eucalyptus were quite similar (568 and 534 kg m-3 respectively) at the irrigated site, but at the rainfed site Eucalyptus wood density was higher (590 kg m-3), while that of Leucaena was lower (508 kg m-3). The kraft pulp yield (KPY) of Leucaena clones was about 1.5 % higher than Eucalyptus at both sites; KPYs of both species were 1.8 % lower at the rainfed than the irrigated site. Leucaena fibres were 31 % and 39 % longer and 65 % and 58 % wider than Eucalyptus, at the irrigated and rainfed sites respectively, and had lower cell wall proportions. Differences among Leucaena clones were significant for growth traits and for most wood and fibre traits, indicating the potential for selecting fast-growing Leucaena clones with improved wood properties. Clonal Leucaena plantations can serve as a productive and complementary pulpwood crop to Eucalyptus in southern India, increasing the yield and strength of blended pulps.

TI  - Biosynthesis of Silver Nanoparticles by Polysaccharide of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> Seeds and Their Anticancer, Antifungal Properties and as Preservative of Composite Milk Sample
T2  - JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS
AB  - The AgNPs were synthesized using water-soluble polysaccharides extracted from the Leucaena leucocephala seeds. The UV-visible spectrum of the AgNPs showed a sharp absorption peak at 448 nm. The XRD analysis showed four major peaks of the crystalline AgNPs with planes of a face-centered cubic lattice of silver. The EDS spectrum showed a strong signal peak at ~3 keV. TEM and SEM observations showed the spherical shape of AgNPs with no particle agglomeration, and the size ranged from 8 to 20 nm. AgNPs were highly stable at -14.2 mV by zeta potential measurement. AgNPs showed significant anticancer activity against the cell lines of breast cancer, liver carcinoma, and colon carcinoma with the IC50 value of 22.5, 12.3, and 8.9 mu g mL(-1), respectively. AgNPs at 900 mu g mL(-1) exhibited considerable antifungal activity against ten fungal pathogens. Water-soluble polysaccharide has the ability to synthesize AgNPs keeping strong antitumor, antifungal activities. The AgNPs can slow down spoilage of composite milk samples at different temperatures. In addition, the accuracy of milk-IR-analyses was not affected by different concentrations of AgNPs.

TI  - GREEN MANURE AS A SOIL FERTILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL OPTION IN SEMIARID AGROSYSTEMS: MINERALIZATION RATE AND N CONTENT
T2  - AGROCIENCIA
AB  - Green manures are an adequate alternative for improving the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus for crop nutrition, within a global context of decreasing soil fertility and the urgent need to care for the environment. Mixteca region, covers a wide area of central Mexico, characterized by a semi-arid climate, eroded calcareous soil, and rural poverty. With the aim of proposing technologies for improving soil quality and increasing the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus, an experiment was conducted using green manures: Canavalia ensiformis, Dolichos lablab, Leucaena leucocephala and Avena strigosa and Phaseolus vulgaris, that would ensure a balance between N and P release and the requirements of maize cultivation. The rate of enriched soil mineralization with green manures was determined through incubation, controlled for 15 days with CO2 emissions using an OxiTop OC110((R)) kit as an indicator of decomposition. CO2 emissions were greatest in the soil established with Leucaena leucocephala and least in the soil with no fertilizer, with emissions descending in the following order: Leucaena leucocephala > Canavalia ensiformis > Avena strigosa +Phaseolus vulgaris > Dolichos lablab > soil without green manure. It is assumed that a greater flow of CO2 is accompanied by greater mineralization and release of nutrients. The N-total in the soil treated with green manures was similar and greater than that of the soil without fertilizer. Soil treated with Avena strigosa+Phaseolus vulgaris contained the highest values of N-mineral (N-ammonium + N-nitrate). P-Olsen content in soils with green manures was double that of the soil without fertilizer. Incubation provided the opportunity of identifying those green manures with higher agronomic potential in the area under study. The biomass comprising Leucaena leucocephala leaves and tender stems constitute an alternative for improving soil by providing OM. However, when considering the availability of N and P, the Avena strigosa+Phaseolus vulgaris combination is a superior alternative for meeting the needs of maize cultivation.

TI  - Impacts of seed-feeding beetles and their parasitoids on seed germination of Leucaena leucocephala and Senna multijuga (Fabaceae) in Brazil
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - We investigated the influence of seed-feeding beetles (Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae) and their parasitoids on the germination performance of two Fabaceae, Leucaena leucocephala and Senna multijuga. We collected 150 fruits per species in forest fragments in the city of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil, between July and August 2020. Seeds were examined and separated into predated and non-predated categories. The predated category was divided into two subcategories: predated by Coleoptera (Bruchinae) (PCO) and predated in the presence of Coleoptera parasitoids (PARCO). The non-predated category was divided into artificially injured (AI), intact seeds without insect infestation (IS), and intact seeds with insect infestation (SIF). Seeds of S. multijuga and L. leucocephala germinated to 40% and 30%, respectively. PCO and PARCO seeds not only had a negative and restricting influence on S. multijuga germination (no germination) but also contributed to a large proportion of non-viable predated seeds (38%). PCO (7%) and PARCO (23%), on the other hand, improved L. leucocephala germination. This work represents one of the first attempt to evaluate the parasitoid effect on seeds germination. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the effect of herbivore predation and the presence of parasitoids on host plant seed germination, which can be critical to mother plant fitness depending on plant species. Further studies are necessary to determine the extend seed consumption by beetles and the presence of their parasitoids may facilitate or impair seed germination, and consequently plant fitness in other systems.

TI  - Comparative reproduction performance of Giant African Land Snail (Archachatina marginata) fed with the leguminous plant Leucaena leucocephala
T2  - REVISTA CIENTIFICA-FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS VETERINARIAS
AB  - The study was carried out between July and October 2022 at the sub-station of the Faculty of Agriculture Research and Teaching farm to assess the reproductive performance of Archachatina marginata fed the leguminous Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal as feed additive. 208 adult snails were randomly partitioned into 4 treatments and 4 repetitions of 13 comparable snails (weight and size). The treatment T0 0 (control) received only the experimental diet as described while three other treatments received not only diet but, L. leucocephala leaf meal at 0.25%, 0.5% and 0.75% for a period of 12 weeks. In each treatment, every morning, the substrate of each breeding bucket was stirred entirely and minutely to collect the eggs to determine the laying and morphometric characteristics of the eggs. The eggs were then placed 10 cm deep in loose soil substrates until hatching to evaluate the characteristics of the fecundity. The unhatched eggs were opened, and the state of embryonic development observed to determine early embryonic mortality rate and late embryonic mortality. At the end of the experiment, animals of each replicate were sacrificed; the hemolymph was collected determine the total cholesterol and protein. The results showed that the characteristics of reproduction were affected with graded level of L. leucocephala. . The highest number of eggs laid (17.29 +/- 13.44) and the number of clutches (268.91) was recorded in animals receiving 0.5% and 0.75% L. leucocephala in the diet respectively while the highest value of fecundation rate (95.50 +/- 8.80), hatch rate (94.55 +/- 9.36), and hatchability (98.99 +/- 3.15) was registered in the treatment that received 0.75%. The highest value of total protein and cholesterol was recorded in the same treatment. In conclusion 0.75% of L. leucocephala can be added in the diet of adult snail to increase its reproductive performance.

TI  - Mature fruits of <i>Gliricidia sepium</i> and <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> plants have potential as inexpensive protein and mineral supplements for ruminants
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Multifunctional leguminous trees like Gliricidia sepium Jacq. (Steud.) and Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (de Wit) are ideal for sustainable agro-ecological farming systems. They are commonly used in alley cropping to provide a sustainable source of nitrogen to cultivated crops or in silvopastoral systems where the leaves are used as livestock feed. However, these plants produce fruits that are not widely used. This study evaluated the nutritive value of mature fruits from G. sepium and L. leucocephala plants to determine their potential as supplemental feedstuffs for ruminants. Mature fruits were collected from 15 plants of each species and evaluated for crude protein (CP), total digestible nutrients (TDN), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), lignin, non-fiber carbohydrates, total digestible nutrients, minerals, phytochemicals, in-vitro ruminal dry matter degradability (IVDMD) and 48-h (h) in-vitro ruminal organic matter digestibility (IVOMD). The concentration of CP (242 g/kg DM) was approximately 28% higher in G. sepium fruits. The TDN (552 g/kg DM), NDF (560.1 g/kg DM) and 48-h IVOMD (590 g/kg) were superior in L. leucocephala fruits. Similarly, L. leucocephala fruits had significantly higher minerals (i.e., calcium, magnesium, potassium, among others). However, G. sepium fruits had lower concentrations of soluble and insoluble condensed tannins and mimosine. The immediately degradable fraction (265.9 g/kg DM), potential degradability (621.6 g/kg DM), and effective degradability (438.9 g/kg DM) values were higher in L. leucocephala fruits. We concluded that mature fruits of G. sepium plant may be a better protein supplement for poor quality grass forages than L. leucocephala because of higher CP and lower phytochemicals contents.

TI  - Performance, Rumen Microbial Community and Immune Status of Goat Kids Fed <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> Post-weaning as Affected by Prenatal and Early Life Nutritional Interventions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala represents a local protein source in tropical ruminant diets. However, its full exploitation is impaired by mimosine, unless it is degraded by the rumen microbial community. Recently, the ruminal bacterial communities of newborns were persistently modified through prenatal or postnatal dietary interventions. Such early-life interventions might enhance adaptation of ruminants to Leucaena leucocephala, which was investigated using a 2 x 2 factorial design trial that tested both supplementation of L. leucocephala in the late pregnancy diet of goat does, and supplementation of live yeast to their newborns. The composition of ruminal bacteria, immune status, as well as organic matter digestibility (OMD) and performance of kids were studied during and after the intervention. Ten pregnant goats were divided into two groups: the D+ and D- groups, which either received or did not receive 30 g of L. leucocephala forage meal during the last 7 +/- 0.5 weeks of gestation. Twins from each goat were divided into the K+ and K- group (supplemented with or without 0.2 g/d of live yeast from day 3 until weaning at 8 weeks). Rumen samples were collected from 4-, 8-, 14-, and 20-weeks old kids to assess the bacterial community, while immune parameters (white blood cells, immunoglobulin M and G, and chitotriosidase activity) were measured in blood and saliva sampled at 4-, 8-, and 20-weeks. We found a stimulatory effect of the prenatal exposure on the post-weaning dry matter intake of the L. leucocephala supplemented diet, resulting in a higher daily gain and final body weight at 20 weeks in the D+ vs. D- group (406 vs. 370 g DM/d, 85.4 vs. 78.6 g/d, and 15.2 vs. 13.8 kg, respectively). Moreover, Ruminococcus represented a greater proportion of the rumen bacterial community of the D+ vs. D- kids (5.1 vs. 1.6%). Differences in the immune status were relatively small and not thought to be a driving factor of differences in animal performance. Furthermore, postnatal supplementation of live yeast favored maturation of the rumen bacterial community (i.e., greater abundance of Bacteroidetes, in particular Prevotella, and reduced abundance of Firmicutes) and protozoa colonization. Concomitantly, OMD was enhanced post-weaning, suggesting effects of the early-life intervention persisted and could have affected animal performance.

TI  - Potential of Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena esculenta Seeds in Human Nutrition: Composition, Techno-functional Properties, Toxicology and Pretreatment Technologies
T2  - LEGUME RESEARCH
AB  - The consumption of legume seeds has benefits for human nutrition and health. Seeds of Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena esculenta are fast-growing legumes that are used for a variety of purposes. In general, they are used to preserve/restore the soil; the foliage can be used as fodder for livestock and the seeds for human consumption in rural populations. Leucaena seeds are a source of nutrition, since they contain proteins, carbohydrates and lipids (including omega 3, 6 and 9 unsaturated acids). The protein fraction has shown pharmaceutical effects of interest (analgesic, lipolytic, emollient, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant and anti-diabetic) and some techno-functional properties for the food industry. However, the main limitation to the human consumption of leucaena seeds is the presence of mimosine, an antinutrient that produces side effects such as alopecia, growth retardation, cataracts and infertility in animals. In this sense, some technological processes that could contribute to its decrease. This work was carried out at the Nutraceuticals Department of the Interdisciplinary Research Center for Integral Regional Development, Oaxaca Unit, Mexico. A comprehensive and integrative review of research work carried out in different parts of the world was conducted. The bibliographic search was carried out from January 2020 to January 2022. Several databases such as Scopus, Latindex, Dialnet, Redalyc.org, FAO and Academic Google were explored. A total of 81 documents were used to prepare this review document. This review integrates aspects related to the potential use of leucaena seeds in human nutrition: nutritional composition, pharmacological, techno-functional properties, the processes to improve digestibility and reduce toxicity.

TI  - An environmentally friendly synthesis method of activated carbons based on subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) sawdust waste for CO2 adsorption
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - A novel micro-mesoporous activated carbon (SBL AC-700) is synthesized from subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) sawdust waste by direct single-stage physical activation at 700 degrees C for 1 h for carbon capture applications. The synthesized AC is characterized to explore various physiochemical properties like elemental composition, surface morphology and crystallinity, presence of functional groups, surface area, pore size, and pore volume. Additionally, emphasis is given to exploring the thermophysical aspects of the novel AC, the literature regarding which is scarce in the open domain. The CO2 adsorption study is carried out for a 0-1 bar pressure for temperatures ranging from 0 to 75 degrees C. The analysis revealed that the AC possesses a surface area of 590 m2/g and pore volume and width of 0.27 cm3/g and 1.85 nm, corresponding to a 70% microporosity with a well-developed porous structure. At 25 degrees C and 1 bar, a CO2 uptake of 40.54 cm3/g is achieved, corresponding to an increment of 6-202% compared to other commercials, chemically and physically activated carbons. Moreover, SBL AC-700 has a thermal conductivity of 0.095 W/m K, 8-131% higher than other benchmarks ACs and much lower specific heat of 0.82 kJ/kg K corresponding to lesser regeneration energy requirements. Experimental data are fitted with various isotherm models, i.e., Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips, R-P, and Toth, out of which R-P and Toth models exhibit the best fit. In continuation, adsorption kinetics is studied to explore the dynamic performance of the SBL AC-700 by using Pseudo-first-order, Pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models.

TI  - Overall performances of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> and <i>Morus alba</i> in high-density protein banks at maturity in western Burkina Faso
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - The objective of this work was to carry out long-term monitoring of protein banks (PB) established under the real-low-input-farm conditions of Burkina Faso, characterized by a Sudano-Sahelian climate type with wide variations in rainfall. The PBs, planted in 2016-2017 with Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Morus alba (MA) at a high density (20,000 plants/ha), were monitored from 2016/2017 to 2021 for their biomass (fodder) production, chemical composition and nutritional value of the edible fodder, and their impacts on soil carbon content. The average annual fodder production of LL for the 6 PBs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) was 11.4 +/- 2.12 t DM/ha/year, while that of MA was 3.8 +/- 1.2 t DM/ha/year for the 3 PB (1, 2, and 3). Such differences are related to higher adaptive capacity for LL in such climatic conditions. Crude protein was higher in LL (19% versus 17%), but dry matter digestibility (65% versus 77%) was superior in MA. Soil carbon increased during the five monitored years, an exciting result for these poor, low-fertility soil conditions. Our results demonstrate the technical and environmental feasibility of establishing this low-input agroforestry technology in these conditions and inspire the potential of sustainable agriculture as an agroecological alternative to overcoming feed shortages for local livestock farming. However, the successful management of a PB relies on selecting the right suitable species, protecting them, and managing them during the establishment and fodder production periods with suitable cutting frequency and appropriate post-harvest management.

TI  - The invasive tree River Tamarind<i> Leucaena</i><i> leucocephala</i> as a seasonal food item for a threatened population of Southern Mealy Amazon<i> Amazona</i> farinosa
T2  - ACTA ORNITHOLOGICA
AB  - Biological invasions are among the main threats to biodiversity, yet invasive species may also have positive impacts on native taxa, such as supplementing the diet of native species when other food items are less available. Herein, we assess whether the invasive River Tamarind Leucaena leucocephala, a small Fabaceae tree, is an important food item for a genetically distinct, threatened population of the Southern Mealy Amazon Amazona farinosa in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We surveyed citizen science platforms and published articles for feeding records of Southern Mealy Amazon to quantify the occurrence of River Tamarind seeds in its diet throughout the year, and assess if seed consumption differed between seasons. Our results showed that, although the density of records of fruit consumption is relatively constant throughout the year, consumption of River Tamarind seeds occurs almost exclusively during the dry season. Furthermore, seed prevalence in feeding events was also significantly higher during that time of the year. Our findings indicate that L. leucocephala represents an important source of nutrition for Atlantic Forest A. farinosa during the dry season. We highlight how citizen science may help to elucidate potentially positive interactions with invasive species and emphasize the need to better understand the ecological roles between the River Tamarind and threatened seed predators at different scales in the Neotropics.

TI  - Impact of Root Distribution Characteristics on the Overturning Resistance of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> Forest in Debris-Flow Accumulation Area, Dawazi Gully, Yunnan, China
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Tree resistance to overturning is crucial in forestry hazard applications and management. Tree anchorage varies considerably with species, tree age, and site conditions. We investigate the relationship between the root characteristics of the overturning slip surface and the role of roots (regarding different diameters in overturning). Four Leucaena leucocephala were fully excavated by a quadrate monolith to establish root distribution characteristics, and 19 L. leucocephala were uprooted until the trees completely overturned to measure the anchoring resistance to overturning. A model was developed to improve the descriptions of root characteristics in the mechanical processes for tree overturning. The results show that the distribution characteristics of the root system were well described by the model. For the root-soil plate radius, the thickest root diameter and the root biomass of different diameters at the overturning slip surface increased with the diameter at the breast height. The root biomass affected the strength of the overturning slip surface; the root density may be a key factor in identifying the location of the overturning slip surface. The model could predict the overturning moment of most overturned trees; although it overestimated the overturning moment for small diameters at breast height trees, the results will be useful for understanding the influence of root distribution characteristics in overturning.

T2  - BIOFUELS BIOPRODUCTS & BIOREFINING-BIOFPR
AB  - The substrate to inoculum ratio (SIR) is an often overlooked parameter in the determination of the methane potential of a substrate.In this article we highlight the importance of the SIR, in the determination of the biochemical methane potential of two substrates, Guinea grass (Panicum maximum) and river tamarind (Leucaena leucocephala). Additionally, the results of this method not only give the specific methane potential, but also the optimum substrate to inoculum ratio, which is an important parameter for bioreactor start-up.The specific methane volumes of the two substrates are, 148 mL/gDM and 250 mL/gDM for the river tamarind and Guinea grass, respectively, with optimum substrate to inoculum ratios of 0.055 and 0.035, respectively.

TI  - Could nitrogen compounds be indicators of tolerance to high doses of Cu and Fe in the cultivation of<i> Leucaena</i><i> leucocephala?</i>
T2  - PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Nitrogen metabolism and the production of primary and secondary metabolites vary according to biotic and abiotic factors such as trace elements (TE) stress, and can, therefore, be considered biomarkers. The present study evaluated the effect of copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) TE, separately, on the metabolism of nitrogen compounds and biomass production, partitioned into shoot and roots of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit., and identified possible defense mechanisms linked to nitrogen metabolism. At 120 days of cultivation, the biomass production of L. leucocephala was higher when exposed to excess Fe than Cu. Nonetheless, the biomass gain (%) of plants exposed to Cu was higher, especially the biomass gains in roots. The tolerance and biomass production of L. leucocephala is related to the regulation of nitrogen metabolism and production of secondary metabolites. The biochemistry of plant metabolism against the excess of Cu and Fe TE manifested similarly, but with some spe-cifics regarding the chemical nature of each metal. There was a reduction in the content of ureides and proteins and an increase in amino acids in the roots in relation to the increase in Cu and Fe concentrations. There was low accumulation of proline in the roots in treatments 400 and 500 mg/dm3 compared to the control for both TE. On the other hand, the total phenolic compounds in the roots increased. Our results indicate that the increased synthesis of amino acids and the accumulation of phenolic compounds is involved in the tolerance of L. leucocephala to Cu and Fe.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENTOMOLOGIA
AB  - The parasitism of Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae) by the parasitoid Horismenus abnormicaulis (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is described for the first time. We harvested 90 Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) fruit pods, in June 2019 on the campus of the Federal University of Lavras in the municipality of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We found 21 individuals of H. abnormicaulis and 334 of A. macrophthalmus. The presence of cephalic capsule of beetle's pupa and evidence of predation into seed pods from which the wasps emerged suggested H. abnormicaulis is a parasitoid of A. macrophthalmus. Horismenus abnormicaulis has been added to the list of A. macrophthalmus parasitoids, and its occurrence has been expanded to the state of Minas Gerais. This discovery expands our knowledge of H. abnormicaulis biology and distribution in Brazil, as well as the tri-trophic interaction, plant-herbivore-parasitoid in invasive plant systems.

TI  - Predicting potential invasion risks of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> (Lam.) de Wit in the arid area of Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
AB  - The presence of invasive plant species poses a substantial ecological impact, thus comprehensive evaluation of their potential range and risk under the influence of climate change is necessary. This study uses maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling to forecast the likelihood of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit invasion in Saudi Arabia under present and future climate change scenarios. Utilizing the MaxEnt modeling, we integrated climatic and soil data to predict habitat suitability for the invasive species. We conducted a detailed analysis of the distribution patterns of the species, using climate variables and ecological factors. We focused on the important influence of temperature seasonality, temperature annual range, and precipitation seasonality. The distribution modeling used robust measures of area under the curve (AUC) and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves, to map the invasion extent, which has a high level of accuracy in identifying appropriate habitats. The complex interaction that influenced the invasion of L. leucocephala was highlighted by the environmental parameters using Jackknife test. Presently, the actual geographic area where L. leucocephala was found in Saudi Arabia was considerably smaller than the theoretical maximum range, suggesting that it had the capacity to expand further. The MaxEnt model exhibited excellent prediction accuracy and produced reliable results based on the data from the ROC curve. Precipitation and temperature were the primary factors influencing the potential distribution of L. leucocephala. Currently, an estimated area of 216,342 km(2) in Saudi Arabia was at a high probability of invasion by L. leucocephala. We investigated the potential for increased invasion hazards in the future due to climate change scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 245 and 585). The analysis of key climatic variables, including temperature seasonality and annual range, along with soil properties such as clay composition and nitrogen content, unveiled their substantial influence on the distribution dynamic of L. leucocephala. Our findings indicated a significant expansion of high risk zones. High-risk zones for L. leucocephala invasion in the current climate conditions had notable expansions projected under future climate scenarios, particularly evident in southern Makkah, Al Bahah, Madina, and Asir areas. The results, backed by thorough spatial studies, emphasize the need to reduce the possible ecological impacts of climate change on the spread of L. leucocephala. Moreover, the study provides valuable strategic insights for the management of invasion, highlighting the intricate relationship between climate change, habitat appropriateness, and the risks associated with invasive species. Proactive techniques are suggested to avoid and manage the spread of L. leucocephala, considering its high potential for future spread. This study enhances the overall comprehension of the dynamics of invasive species by combining modeling techniques with ecological knowledge. It also provides valuable information for decision-making to implement efficient conservation and management strategies in response to changing environmental conditions.

TI  - Evaluation of Kraft pulp yield and syringyl/guaiacyl ratio from standing trees (<i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i>, <i>E</i>. <i>urophylla</i>, <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> and <i>Casuarina junghuhniana</i>) using portable near infrared spectroscopy
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY
AB  - Measurement of pulpwood traits from a standing tree has considerable advantage when screening large populations for tree selection. It reduces time and also eliminates requirements of transport, powdering, and storing the sample. This study describes estimation of Kraft pulp yield (KPY) in Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. urophylla, Leucaena leucocephala, and Casuarina junghuhniana by portable NIR spectroscopy of standing trees. Calibration models were developed for KPY estimation using portable NIR spectroscopy for the four species, along with a calibration model for syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio in E. camaldulensis. The calibration models for KPY showed R-2 values ranging from 0.93 (E. camaldulensis) to 0.83 (L leucocephala), and 0.95 for S/G ratio. The developed calibration models for E. camaldulensis and L. leucocephala were compared with laboratory NIR models, and a variation of <+/- 2.0% was found between both methods. The models were validated by both external and cross validation which showed <2.0% RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction) and <2.0% RMECV (root mean square error of cross validation) in external and cross validations, respectively.

TI  - Image analysis of seeds and machine learning as a tool for distinguishing populations: Applied to an invasive tree species
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIARUM-AGRONOMY
AB  - Invasive species threaten crops and ecosystems worldwide. Therefore, we sought to understand the relationship between the geographic distribution of species populations and the characteristics of seeds using new techniques such as seed image analysis, multivariate analysis, and machine learning. This study aimed to characterize Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. seeds from spatially dispersed populations using digital images and analyzed their implications for genetic studies. Seed size and shape descriptors were obtained using image analysis of the five populations. Several analyses were performed including descriptive statistics, principal components, Euclidean distance, Mantel correlation test, and supervised machine learning. This image analysis technique proved to be efficient in detecting biometric differences in L. leucocephala seeds from spatially dispersed populations. This method revealed that spatially dispersed L. leucocephala populations had different biometric seed patterns that can be used in studies of population genetic divergence. We observed that it is possible to identify the origin of the seeds from the biometric characters with 80.4% accuracy (Kappa statistic 0.755) when we applied the decision tree algorithm. Digital imaging analysis associated with machine learning is promising for discriminating forest tree populations, supporting management activities, and studying population genetic divergence. This technique contributes to the understanding of genotype-environment interactions and consequently identifies the ability of an invasive species to spread in a new area, making it possible to track and monitor the flow of seeds between populations and other sites.

TI  - Effectiveness of using water-extracted <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> seeds as a coagulant for turbid water treatment: effects of dosage, pH, mixing speed, mixing time, and settling time
T2  - BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY
AB  - Natural materials have a high potential to be used as coagulant/flocculant owing to the problems of inorganic materials. Petai belalang (Leucaena leucocephala) is a widely abundant plant in Malaysia and very efficient as a plant-based coagulant in previous research. This research investigated the effectiveness of seeds of L. leucocephala in removing turbidity from synthetic wastewater and the effect of operation parameters of jar test on treatment performance through optimization of dosage, pH, rapid mixing speed and time, slow mixing speed and time, and settling time. The water extraction method was used to extract the active ingredients from the seeds by drying and pulverizing the seeds and then dissolving them in distilled water at a concentration of 20 g/L. The extraction solution of the seeds gives removal efficiency of turbidity of 93.05% at the optimum operation parameters dosage, pH, rapid mixing speed and time, slow mixing speed and time, and settling time of 120 mg/L, 6.5, 260 rpm for 11 min, 30 rpm for 15 min, and 30 min, respectively. It is expected that bridging was the possible mechanism given that the flocs are formed under the same negative zeta potential condition. With this high performance of L. leucocephala, it has high potential to be used as a coagulant in wastewater treatment at specific operation parameters with further exploration to determine the optimum extraction method of the active ingredients.

TI  - Changes in growth pattern and rhizospheric soil biochemical properties of a leguminous tree species <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> under long-term exposure to elevated ozone
T2  - 3 BIOTECH
AB  - Increasing concentrations of ground-level ozone (O-3) exert significant impacts on the plants, but there is limited data for belowground processes. We studied the effects of long-term exposure of elevated O-3 (EO3) on plant growth parameters (plant height and biomass) and biochemical parameters (nutrients, microbial biomass and enzymatic activities) of rhizospheric soil of leguminous tree species Leucaena leucocephala. L. leucocephala seedlings were grown under ambient O-3 (AO(3)) and EO3 (+20 ppb above ambient) under Free Air Ozone Concentration Enrichment (O-3-FACE) facility and changes in plant growth and their rhizospheric soil properties were studied during 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of EO3 exposure. L. leucocephala showed significant reductions in shoot length, root biomass, shoot biomass, leaf biomass and total biomass during 12, 18 and 24 months of exposure to EO3. Total nutrients in rhizospheric soil like carbon and phosphorus were significantly reduced after 24 months of EO3 exposure. Most of the available nutrients showed significant reduction after 6, 12 and 24 months of EO3 exposure. A significant decrease was apparent in microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of EO3 treatment. Significant reductions were observed in extracellular enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glycosidase, fluorescein diacetate, arylsulfatase, cellulase and protease) of soil after 6, 12 and 24 months of EO3 exposure. These results suggest that increasing O-3 concentrations will directly impact L. leucocephala growth as well as have indirect impact on the nutrient contents (C, N, and P), microbial biomass and extracellular enzymatic activities of rhizospheric soil of L. leucocephala. Our results suggest that continuous increase in O-3 concentrations will have serious implications for aboveground plant growth and belowground soil fertility in this region considered as O-3 hotspot.

TI  - Solid degradation and its kinetics on phenol-rich bio-oil production from pyrolysis of coconut shell and Lamtoro wood residue
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - The pyrolysis of coconut shell (CS) only, lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) wood residues (LWR) only, and a CS/LWR mixture was experimentally studied herein for the first time. Additionally, the reaction kinetics of solid destruction during the pyrolysis process of CS and LWR was deduced. An experimental investigation was carried out in a batch reactor at the different pyrolysis temperatures (300-500 degrees C). The highest phenol yield (30.97%) was observed at 500 degrees C for the pyrolysis of CS. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor and for degradation of solid were successfully determined for the first time using the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy was determined in the range of 121-153 kJ mol(-1) for the temperature range of 300-500 degrees C. Meanwhile, the pre-exponential factors of 3.51x10(10) s(-1), 4.77x10(10) s(-1), and 5.38x10(10) s(-1) were calculated for the pyrolysis of CS only, LWR only, and a CS/LWR mixture, respectively. This research presents the mitigation for the alleviation of the energy crisis and to convert underutilized biomass to high-value products.

TI  - Cattle intensification based on silvopastoral systems with <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> (Lam.) de Wit as a strategy to increase production and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the Caribbean region of Colombia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Different cattle production interventions have been proposed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase animal productivity, but few studies have identified their real potential under grazing conditions and at the whole system level. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of silvopastoral systems (SPS) with Leucaena leucocephala on total GHG emissions, emission intensity, GHG balance and cattle productivity in a series of production scenarios in northern Colombia. A life cycle analysis (LCA) approach was used to evaluate one baseline system (BL) based on pastures and four SPS intervention scenarios. For this analysis, the emissions from enteric fermentation and manure were determined in situ. Methane emissions from enteric fermentation were 9.7% lower in the SPS with leucaena than in BL systems (p = 0.0369). Emission factors for manure were higher in the BL systems (p < 0.05) as were emission intensities to produce one kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) and one kg of live weight gain (LWG). For animal production and GHG balance, it was found that the inclusion of leucaena increased animal production up to four times compared to the BL system and mitigated GHG emissions per hectare up to 86% due to carbon sequestration. In conclusion, leucaena SPSs are an alternative to mitigate climate change under grazing conditions, as they reduce GHG emissions and increase animal productivity.

TI  - Management of nitrogen nutrient flow under legume practice from La Teresa basin to the Batabano Gulf
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
AB  - Nitrogen management in a karst basin is examined through the establishment of legumes Leucaena leucocephala and Phaseolus vulgaris in pasture and crop areas respectively, with the objective of enriching the nutrient flow interrupted by the construction of dams and canals built during the 1990s, which have altered the natural patterns of hydrological variation and transport to the sea. The different soil treatments show low values of overland fluxes to the sea between 0.9623 and 0.9624 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for crops, discretely increasing by 0.02% in pasture and by 0.28% for crop + pasture according to the geomorphic potential of the basin. For land use conditions, a positive economic nitrogen balance was estimated in the range of 55-1560 for crops and 22-2400 USD ha(-1) yr(-1) for pastures, the latter showing positive balances at the lowest fixation rates, confirming that cover management with legumes maximizes gains and minimizes losses for both agricultural and marine ecosystems, providing a source of indirect fertilization downstream where agricultural areas are located.

TI  - Effect of slope exposure on the structure and diversity of a submontane scrub in Northeast Mexico
T2  - GAYANA BOTANICA
AB  - Slope exposure is one of the environmental factors that influences vegetation characteristics. Although there are studies on this aspect in various types of vegetation, up to now submontane shrublands have not been extensively studied. In this work, the effect of slope exposure on the structure and composition of plant species in a state park in northeastern Mexico where the dominant vegetation is submontane scrub was evaluated. Ten 10 x 10 m exposure sites were sampled: northeast, southwest and northwest. Total height (h), basal diameter (d0.10) and crown diameter (k) were measured for each individual. Our hypotheses were: 1) the northwestern exposure community will have greater basal area, canopy cover, volume, absolute abundance, and specific richness due to higher humidity, 2) each slope will present dissimilarity in species composition. As results, nine families, 17 genera and 17 species of vascular plants were recorded. Fabaceae was the best represented family with six species. The species with the highest importance value index were the endemic shrub Neopringlea integrifolia in the northeast exposure (21.52 %) and the exotic tree Leucaena leucocephala in the southwest (16.17 %) and northwest (27.16 %) exposures. It is concluded that the plant community of the northwest exposure has a greater basal area, crown cover, volume, absolute abundance and specific richness. However, there was no real difference in the species composition of the three exposures.

TI  - Biosynthesis of<i> Leucaena</i><i> Leucocephala</i> leaf mediated ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and MgO based nano-adsorbents for Reactive Golden Yellow-145 (RY-145) and Direct Red-31 (DR-31) dye removal from textile wastewater to reuse in agricultural purpose
T2  - SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Environmental pollution by textile dye-based wastewater raises a vital call for consideration to industrialists and scientists due to its influence on the ecosystem. In this study, zinc oxide (ZnO), copper oxide (CuO), Manganese dioxide (MnO2), and Magnesium Oxide (MgO) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized from Leucaena leucocephala leaves for the removal of Reactive Golden Yellow-145 (RY-145) and Direct Red-31 (DR-31) dyes. The nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Optimization of various operating parameters like initial dye concentration, pH, temperature, contact time, and dose of nanoparticles was investigated. The results showed that Leucaena leucocephala leaf-mediated ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and MgO nanoparticles presented the highest adsorption capacities for RY-145 of 47.50 (mg/g), 65.53(mg/g), 53.62 (mg/g), and 58.72 (mg/g) respectively, with optimized parameter values of pH solution, contact time, adsorbent dose, initial dye concentration, and temperature were 3, 75 min, 0.05 g/50 mL, 100 mg/L and 25 degrees C on 124 rpm, correspondingly. DR-31 presented the highest adsorption capacities of 57.08 (mg/g), 83.47(mg/g), 67.36 (mg/g), and 72.53 (mg/g) respectively at optimized parameter values of pH solution, contact time, adsorbent dose, initial dye concentration and temperature were 2 and 3, 60min, 0.05 g/ 50 mL, 100 mg/L and 25 degrees C on 124 rpm. The surfactants and electrolytes effects were also scrutinized on dyes' adsorption. The surfactants and electrolytes' existence in the aqueous media reduced the adsorption of dye because of the competition for limited binding sites. The RY-145 and DR-31 adsorbents adsorption efficiencies were found in following order; MgO (65.52% and 83.47%) > MnO2 (58.72% and 72.53%) > CuO (53.62% and 67.36%) > ZnO (47.50% and 57.08%). The adsorption-based dye data were scrutinized using various isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics models. The studies presented that the adsorption processes were well fitted to pseudo-second-order kinetics since correlation coefficient (R2) values ranged from 0.994 to 0.999 and Intraparticle diffusion models correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.88 to 0.97, their values were relatively near the experimental values signify the adsorption kinetics in both dyes. Both dyes adsorption on green nanoadsorbents followed a Langmuir isotherm due to decent correlation coefficient values of 0.999 with value of 59.17 (mg/g), 66.22 (mg/g), 72.99 (mg/g), and 81.30 (mg/g) respectively for DR-31 and 47.62 (mg/g), 53.763 (mg/g), 58.48 (mg/g), and 64.93 (mg/g) for RY-145 with monolayer coverage. RY-145 also followed Temkin and Doubinin Radushkevich's isotherm. The thermodynamics investigations revealed spontaneous dyes adsorption onto MgO and MnO2, ZnO is non-spontaneous in both dyes while CuO is spontaneous in DR-31 and nonspontaneous in RY-145. The maximum desorption of 78-86% was attained using the 0.2 N and 0.4 N NaOH for adsorbed RY-145 and DR-31 dye respectively. The desorption data was favorable as the Leucaena leucocephala leaf-mediated ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and MgO nanoparticles adsorbents were utilized several cycles and have stability This experimental study also determines the potential efficacy of green nano-adsorbents for the removal of dye from the real textile effluent. In addition, a phytotoxicity investigation of used green nano-adsorbents is carried out on the pea seeds, to demonstrate their sustainability from a real environmental point of view.
   Thus, Because of their promising efficiency, green ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and MgO nanoparticles have the potential to apply for dye adsorption from textile wastewater.

TI  - Secondary invasion by an invasive shrub limits native tree seedling growth in a size-dependent manner following the eradication of a different invasive species in an island ecosystem
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Following the control of an invasive tree species, native forest ecosystem restoration can be prevented by a secondary invasion by another invasive species that inhibits the reestablishment of native trees. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the invasive shrub Leucaena leucocephala on the initial growth of planted seedlings of four native tree species (Pandanus boninensis, Rhaphiolepis indica, Schima mertensiana, and Terminalia catappa) after eradication of the invasive tree Casuarina equisetifolia in the Ogasawara Islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. In a 24-month field experiment, we compared the sizes of planted seedlings (diameter at ground level, height, and leaf number) among four treatments in a 2 x 2 design of initial seedling size (large vs. small) x L. leucocephala invasion (sowing L. leucocephala seeds vs. control). More than 75% of the seedlings (excluding S. mertensiana) survived regardless of the treatments. For all four species, initially large seedlings tended to become larger plants at the end of the experiment than initially small seedlings. We detected significant effects of L. leucocephala invasion on one or more plant size parameters in all four species. Seedlings grown in L. leucocephala invasion quadrats were smaller than those in control quadrats at the end of the experiment. We detected significant interactions between initial seedling sizes and L. leucocephala invasion for three species. Together, these results indicate that secondary invasion by L. leucocephala after controlling C. equisetifolia inhibits the initial growth of native tree seedlings, depending on their size at the time of invasion.

TI  - Evaluation of energy supplements in dual purpose cows in a silvopastoral system
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB  - The objective was to evaluate the effect of three energy concentrates on dietary nitrogen utilisation efficiency, milk production and milk composition. Twelve dual-purpose cows fed in a silvopastoral (SSP) system with Leucaena leucocephala and Digitaria swazilandensis were fed four treatments, supplemented with 25 MJ/cow/day of sorghum, molasses and gluconeogenic precursors, plus the control treatment, using a 4x4 Latin square experimental design with three replicates and experimental periods of 14 days and a total duration of 56 days. No significant differences were found for milk yield, milk chemical composition and milk urea nitrogen (MUN). No significant differences were found for cow live weight and dry matter intake. Forage analysis showed significant difference for crude protein (CP) concentration. There was no significant difference for average values of dry matter (DM) yield, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), lignin and in vitro DM matter. For Leucaena, a significant difference was found only in DM yield, with period 4 being the highest yielding period compared to periods 1, 2 and 3. There was no significant difference for CP, NDF, ADF, lignin and in vitro DM digestibility. This work allows to understand the interaction of CP metabolism with DM. It is concluded that SSP provides sufficient dietary energy to cows in production for dual-purpose cows ranching.

TI  - Effect of the diet for cattle based on Leucaena leucocephala on the emission of N2O in a simulated urine patch in a silvopastoral system in the dry season
T2  - REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CONTAMINACION AMBIENTAL
AB  - N2O has a global warming potential of 300 times greater than CO2, and in silvopastoral systems, urine is a source of N2O emission. The objective of the research was to evaluate the effect of the diet for bovines based on Leucaena leucocephala on N2O emissions in a simulated urine patch in a silvopastoral system. A Cynodon plectostachyus meadow was used, and 13 samplings were carried out during March - April 2021. The treatments were, A: 20 kg of urea/ha from bovine urine fed with 100% C. plectostachyus hay + 0% L leucocephala, B: 36 kg of urea/ha from the urine of bovines fed with 16% of L. leucocephala + 84% of C. plectostachyus and C: 79 kg of urea/ ha from the urine of bovines fed with 33% L. leucocephala + 67% C. plectostachyus. A completely randomized design with four replicates was used. Static closed stainless-steel chambers were used to obtain gas samples at 0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes. Environmental temperature, pH, humidity, nitrate and ammonium contents in the soil were recorded. Data were analyzed with the statistical program SAS 9.0. The N2O emission flux ( mu g/m(2)/h) between treatments did not present significant differences. The emission peak was observed on the fourth day of sampling in the treatments (A: 17.49, B: 23.71 and C: 22.88 mu g N2O N m(2)/h). In addition, there was a positive correlation between the N2O flux and soil moisture. The increase in the amount of L. leucocephala in the diet of the animals did not influence the emission of N2O, due to the concentration of urea in the urine. However, a positive correlation with soil moisture was observed.

TI  - A water-absorbent hydrogel prepared with arabinoxylans from flaxseed (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i>) and galactomannans from <i>subabul</i> (<i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>) impacts the growth and composition of cherry tomatoes in potted experiments
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - A water-absorbent hybrid hydrogel was prepared using arabinoxylans from flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) (FX) and galactomannans from subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) (SG) in the presence of kappa-carrageenan (kappa C) with variable concentration of potassium chloride as crosslinker (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.3 M), and evaluated on the basis of their swelling rate (%). The optimized hydrogel (GAXH) from a blend of SG, kappa C, FX and KCl at 5.5% w/v, 1.32% w/v, 1% w/v and 0.3M, respectively, showed 300% swelling in water at room temperature and pH 7.4 with 100% retention of water for 30 days at 10 degree celsius. Blending 50% w/w GAXH in the soil could retain 140% water for 30 days, acting as a water reservoir in the soil system at 35 degree celsius and pH 7.4 which reached 100% evaporation after 60 days. Incorporation of 50% w/w GAXH in sandy, loamy soil was used for the potted cultivation of cherry tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme) and observed for growth and composition of the tomatoes. GAXH enhanced the physiological growth of both the plant as well as cherry tomatoes by controlling the release of KCl into the soil and maintaining soil moisture when 3 day intermittent watering schedule was used. An additional advantage was an improved water use efficiency and reduction in water footprint from 3.23 cm(3)/g to 9.32 cm(3)/g and 19.87 mL/fruit to 8.56 mL/fruit, respectively. The fully ripened tomatoes grown on GAXH-incorporated soil showed higher contents of lycopene, total carotenoids, and total polyphenols from 166 to 257 mu g/g fresh weight, 99-107 mg beta-carotene equivalent/100g fresh weight, 223-241 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g fresh weight, respectively, than control cherry tomatoes grown in soil with no added GAXH. This was also reflected in enhanced antioxidant activity of cherry tomatoes grown in GAXH-incorporated soil.

TI  - Biogenic Functionalized ZnO/CuO Nanocomposite Sensor for Potentiometric Determination of Pseudoephedrine-HCl in Pure and Commercial Products
T2  - BAGHDAD SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - The ultrafunctional potential of zinc oxide (ZnO) and copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) has generated a great interest in using such metal oxides as remarkable and electroactive nanocomposites in the studies on potentiometry and sensors. These nano-oxides were prepared from the extract of Leucaena leucocephala seeds as an environmentally friendly process. The development of a ZnO/CuO "core-shell nanocomposite-modified" coated copper wire film sensor was proposed as a new method for potentiometric determination of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (PSD) in pure and pharmaceutical dosage forms. With the existence of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a polymer with high molecular weight and "o-nitrophenyl octyl ether (o-NPOE) as a solvent mediator", PSD was combined with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) to produce pseudoephedrine hydrochloride-phosphotungstate (PSD-PT) as a sensing substance. The improved sensor showed a very high sensitivity and selectivity for determining and quantifying the PSD with a linear relationship of 1.0x10(-8)-1.0x10(-2) mol L-1. It was estimated that the regression equation was represented by the EmV = (-58.143) log [PSD] + 526.71. With the proposed sensors, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride could be effectively determined in pure and commercial product forms.

TI  - Augmenting<i> Leucaena</i><i> leucocephala</i> biomass with mineral fertiliser on rainwater use efficiency, agronomic efficiency and yields on sorghum<i> (Sorghum</i><i> bicolor</i> [(L.) Moench]) under rainwater harvesting techniques in semi-arid region of Zimbabwe
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Food security in semi-arid regions is threatened by declining soil fertility, soil moisture stress and long frequent droughts as a result of erratic rainfall. Therefore we assessed the effects of augmenting Leucaena leucocephala biomass (organic manure) with mineral fertiliser on rainwater use efficiency, agronomic efficiency, grain and stover yields for two sorghum varieties (Macia and SV1) under rainwater harvesting techniques. The experiment was laid in split-split plot arrangement with rainwater harvesting method as main plot factor, with Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser as subplot factor and sorghum variety as sub-sub plot factor over three cropping seasons. Data collected include rainwater use efficiency, agronomic efficiency, grain and stover yields. Results show that tied contours have significantly (p <= 0.05) higher grain and stover yields from all varieties and seasons. Irre-gardless of sorghum variety, tied contours had significant (p <= 0.05) sorghum grain and stover yield followed by infiltration pits and lastly standard contours. Grain and stover yields improved with increasing levels of Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser combination. Highest grain yields observed were 1.146 t ha-1 (Macia) and 1.1 t ha-1 (SV1) from tied contour +15 t ha-1 biomass +150 kg ha-1 NPK fertiliser treatments. Rainwater use efficiency was significantly (p <= 0.05) higher from tied contours compared to infiltration pits and standard contour. Rainwater use efficiency was statistically (p <= 0.05) influenced by increasing application levels of Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser in all seasons. Agronomic efficiencies were considerably (p <= 0.05) affected by rainwater harvesting, Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser and interaction of all factors. It can therefore be concluded that Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser, tied contours and infiltration pits improve sorghum yields. Augmenting 2.5 t ha-1 biomass with 25 kg ha-1 NPK fertiliser under tied contours and Macia have better agronomic efficiency.

TI  - Performance of Forage Cactus Intercropped with Arboreal Legumes and Fertilized with Different Manure Sources
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - The use of agricultural practices such as fertilization and intercropping can improve the production of forage cacti. The objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of forage cactus intercropped with leguminous trees and fertilized with different sources of manure in the tropical semiarid region of Brazil. The research was carried out at the Agricultural and Livestock Research Enterprise of Pernambuco State during the period from March 2011 to September 2013. The following cultivation systems were used: (i) Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth + forage cactus cv. IPA-Sertania [Opuntia cochenillifera (L.) Mill]; (ii) Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit + forage cactus; and (iii) forage cactus in monoculture. All of these systems were fertilized with different sources of manure (cattle, goat, sheep, and broiler litter). The goat and sheep manure (16.6 and 16.5 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1)) provided the least production of cactus in the different cropping systems. Cattle manure provided greater production of forage and wood from legumes (1.4 and 4.3 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1)) and cactus (20.9 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1)). Gliricidia produced more forage and wood than Leucaena. Total production of the forage cactus-Gliricidia system produced 4.7 and 3.8 Mg DM ha(-1) of biomass and wood in two years, respectively. The production and morphological characteristics of the cactus increased at further distance from the trees (3 m), and the opposite effect was observed for the concentrations of N, p, and K. Thus, cropping systems using forage cactus and tree legumes fertilized with manure represent an option for tropical semiarid regions.

TI  - Characterization of charcoals produced from Acacia, Albizia and Leucaena for application in ironmaking
T2  - FUEL
AB  - Fossil coal can be replaced with renewable charcoal to reduce CO2 emissions from ironmaking processes. Charcoals produced from three hardwood species, Acacia nilotica (W1), Albizia lebbeck (W2) and Leucaena leucocephala (W3), were evaluated as a reductant in ironmaking. Charcoals were produced with slow (5 & DEG;C/min) and fast heating rates (50 ?/min) at 600, 800 and 1100 & DEG;C. Charcoals were characterized using proximate, ultimate analysis, volume shrinkage, compressive loading, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy for their chemical, mechanical and physical properties. It was found that among the selected biomass species, fixed and total carbon content is higher in W1 (83-97; 84-91%) and W2 (83-96; 86-92%) than W3 (76-89; 78-84%) and increases with increase in carbonization temperature and heating rate. Charcoal yield in W1 (22-28%), W2 (22-26%) and W3 (23-28%) decreases with an increase in carbonization temperature and heating rate. Charcoals produced at various carbonization conditions have at most 10% ash content. Values from different tests indicate that W2 and W3 charcoal are potentially better reductant than W1.

TI  - Initial In Vitro Assessment of the Antifungal Activity of Aqueous Extracts from Three Invasive Plant Species
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - The development of new, safe, and effective methods of managing fungal pathogens is required. This study was conducted to perform an initial in vitro assessment of the antifungal activity of water-based plant extracts from three plants which are invasive in Egypt: Prosopis juliflora, Ipomoea carnea, and Leucaena leucocephala. These extracts were tested against three pathogenic fungi species that cause high crop losses in Egypt: Fusarium solani, Alternaria solani, and Colletotrichum circinans. Three extract concentrations, 10%, 20%, and 30%, were tested using a completely randomized design, with three replicates per treatment. Antifungal activity was determined based on the effects of plant extracts on fungal radial growth inhibition, average daily growth of fungi, spore formation, spore germination, and total biomass. Inhibition of the growth of fungal strains increased with increasing plant extract concentration, with the highest inhibitory rate at the 30% extract concentration. In addition, spore density, spore germination, and total biomass decreased significantly with increasing extract concentration. The three fungal pathogens differed in their inhibition and their response to these plant extracts. Prosopis juliflora had the highest inhibitory effect on the three fungal pathogens, compared to the extracts from the other two invasive plants. The results of this feasibility study indicate that P. juliflora extracts have high antifungal activity and follow-up in vivo assays should be conducted to determine their efficacy in the safe and sustainable management of these and other fungal pathogens.

TI  - Reclamation of Saline Soil under Association between <i>Atriplex nummularia</i> L. and Glycophytes Plants
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Phytoremediation is an efficient technique for the reclamation of salt-affected soils by growing plants. The present study aims to evaluate the intercropping of halophyte Atriplex nummularia Lindl. with naturally occurring species (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) adapted to semiarid regions as a management capable of enhancing the phytoremediation capacity of these species. A field experiment was conducted in a randomized block and contained four replicates. Species were cultivated alone and in association with A. nummularia to evaluate their potential uses in the reclamation of soils. Exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+, as well as salinity and sodicity variables, were evaluated. The evaluations were performed at 9 and 18 months of plant growth. The results indicated that A. nummularia individualized was the treatment most efficient; with reductions of 80%, 63%, and 84% in electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, and exchangeable sodium percentage values, respectively at 18 months compared to starting of the experiment. However, the use of A. nummularia and species adapted to the semiarid in association, or even alone, promoted beneficial effects on the soil quality after the establishment of the plants.

TI  - Understanding competition between two invasive woody plants of India under an altered rainfall regime
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Prosopis juliflora and Leucaena leucocephala are notable examples of invasive woody plants that can spread throughout similar habitats in India. However, little is known about how these two species may interact with one another if future rainfall pattern shifts, which is particularly concerning. Recognizing the pivotal role of eco-physiological parameters in deciphering the dynamics of interspecific competition, a study was devised to elucidate the interplay between L. leucocephala and P. juliflora under simulated rainfall conditions. At Botanical Garden, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, UP, India, three fixed rainout shelter plots were established, each receiving distinct precipitation levels: low rainfall (LR), normal rainfall (NR), and high rainfall (HR). Within each plot, three replicate subplots were dedicated to pure stands of L. leucocephala (L), pure stands of P. juliflora (P), and mixed stands of the two species (LP). The findings of the study underscore significant variations in soil Inorganic N, N-mineralization, based on precipitation levels, with maximum values observed in HR plot and L. Similarly, biomass, photosynthetic rate, and transpiration rate exhibited significant variability in response to precipitation treatment, reaching their highest values in HR plot and L. Conversely, root length, root-shoot ratio, and water use efficiency peaked in LR plot and P, presenting a contrasting trend. This study suggests that L. leucocephala may facilitate the growth of P. juliflora by improving the soil's nitrogen availability and, consequently, the eco-physiological characteristics of the plant in mixed plant stands. Furthermore, L. leucocephala is providing P. juliflora with favourable conditions for robust growth under water stress-a scenario indicative of Facilitative approach.

TI  - An innovative insecticidal approach based on plant protease inhibitor and<i> Bt</i> protoxins inhibits trypsin-like activity in zebrafish
T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The Leucaena leucocephala trypsin inhibitor (LTI) + Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protoxins mix has been proposed as a novel larvicide agent in order to control the vector mosquito of dengue virus, Aedes aegypti, in their aquatic breeding sites. However, use of this insecticide formulation has raised concerns about its impacts on aquatic biota. In this context, this work aimed to assess the effects of LTI and Bt protoxins, separately or in combination, in zebrafish, in regard to the evaluation of toxicity at early life stages and to the presence of LTI inhibitory effects on intestinal proteases of this fish. Results showed that LTI and Bt concentrations (250 mg/L, and 0.13 mg/L, respectively), and LTI + Bt mix (250 mg/L + 0.13 mg/L) -10 times superior to those with insecticidal action - did not cause death nor did it induce morphological changes during embryonic and larval development (3 to 144 h post-fertilization) of zebrafish. Molecular docking analyses highlighted a possible interaction between LTI and zebrafish trypsin, especially through hydrophobic interactions. In concentrations near to those with larvicidal action, LTI (0.1 mg/mL) was able to inhibit in vitro intestinal extracts of trypsin in female and male fish by 83 % and 85 %, respectively, while LTI + Bt mix promoted trypsin inhibition of 69 % in female and 65 % in male ones. These data show that the larvicidal mix can potentially promote deleterious effects to nutrition and survival in non-target aquatic organisms, especially those with trypsin-like dependent protein digestion.

TI  - Nanoremediation and Antioxidant Potential of Biogenic Silver Nanoparticles Synthesized Using Leucena's Leaves, Stem, and Fruits
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Synthetic dyes are persistent organic environmental pollutants that can cause extensive damage to living beings and to the ecosystem as a whole. Cost-effective, sustainable, and efficient strategies to deal with this type of pollution are necessary as it commonly resists conventional water treatment methods. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using the aqueous extract from the leaves, stem, and fruits of Leucaena leucocephala (Leucena) were produced and characterized through UV-vis, TEM, EDS, SDL, XPS, XRD, and zeta potential, and they proved to be able to promote adsorption to remediate methylene blue and tartrazine pollution in water. The nanoremediation was performed and did not require direct exposure to sunlight or any special lamp or a specific reduction agent. The AgNPs produced using the extract from the leaves exhibited the best performance in nanoremediation and also presented antioxidant activity that surpassed the one from butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Consequently, it is an interesting nanotool to use in dye nanoremediation and/or as an antioxidant nanostructure.

TI  - Hydrology and runoff water quality from three improved pastures compared with virgin brigalow (<i>Acacia harpophylla</i>) woodland over 8 years in semiarid Australia
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
AB  - The Fitzroy Basin in central Queensland has the largest cattle herd of any natural resource management region in Australia, and legumes have been widely used to boost fertility of rundown soil and improve cattle liveweight gains. However, there is a paucity of information on the effect of leguminous pastures on hydrology and water quality. This study investigated runoff water quality over eight hydrological years from virgin brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) woodland and three improved pastures, namely, buffel grass (Pennisetum ciliare), butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). Runoff event mean concentrations and loads of total and dissolved nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon in addition to total suspended solids are reported. Brigalow woodland had the greatest loss of sediment and nitrogen attributed to the inherently fertile Vertosols (clay soil), but the low occurrence and amount of runoff meant that it had a low risk to water quality. Despite a similar number of runoff events from the improved pastures, leucaena pasture had less total runoff and a lower maximum peak runoff rate in addition to lower nitrogen and carbon in runoff. Total suspended solids and carbon in runoff were greater from grass pasture than from the leguminous pastures, whereas nitrogen and phosphorus were greatest from the butterfly pea pasture, especially in the first 2 years post-planting. Greater exports of phosphorus from the improved pastures were concerning, given the potential for downstream impacts.

TI  - Mimosine concentration in giant leucaena<i> (Leucaena</i><i> leucocephala</i> subsp.<i> glabrata)</i> fluctuates with age and plant part
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES
AB  - Giant leucaena is a multipurpose tree-legume found throughout the tropics and sub-tropics. Its foliage is used as animal fodder due to high protein and fiber. Giant leucaena has several other advantageous traits such as fast-growth, high yields and strong tolerance to environmental stresses. Despite having these desirable qualities, leucaena tissues contain an undesirable attribute, a toxic non-protein amino acid, mimosine, found in all parts of the plant including the foliage. The goal of this research was to determine mimosine concentrations in various tissues and life stages of giant leucaena plants to inform use of leucaena foliage as a fodder. Mimosine was extracted from different parts of giant leucaena at different ages and quantified using HPLC analysis. qRT-PCR was used to determine the relative expression of mimosine synthase in leucaena tissues. Mimosine was present in all parts of the leaf, stem and root of giant leucaena, and concentrations changed depending on the age of the plant. Green seeds had the highest expression level of mimosine synthase. Mimosine is ubiquitous and abundant in leucaena tissues with younger and immature plants and tissues containing more mimosine than older mature plants and tissues.

TI  - Combination of organic amendments as a soil recovering strategy at a desertification hotspot in the Brazilian semiarid
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The use of manure, organic mulch, and legume-based fertilizers can increase soil fertility in semiarid regions. However, the effects of such practices on soils prone to desertification are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate soil fertility and herbaceous stratum yield on soils amended with different organic inputs in the desertification hotspot of Iraucuba, Ceara state, Brazil. The experiments were performed in two areas with different soils (Planosol and Cambisol), in randomized blocks with a 2 x 2 x 3 + 1 factorial design. The factors consisted of (i) mulch (presence or absence of Copernicia prunifera [carnauba palm] straw), (ii) manure (sheep or cattle), and (iii) legume-based fertilizer (Mimosa tenuiflora [jurema], Mimosa caesalpiniifolia [sabia], and Leucaena leucocephala [leucena]), in addition to an untreated control, with three replicates. Soil chemical attributes and herbaceous stratum yield were assessed in the two areas. Positive effects of the combined use of carnauba palm straw, manures, and legume-based fertilizers on soil fertility were more evident for Planosol than for Cambisol. The combination of sheep manure with sabia-based fertilizer in Planosol, and cattle manure and leucena-based fertilizer in Cambisol increased herbaceous stratum yield. Herbaceous stratum yield in Planosol is more responsive to the input of great amounts of soil nutrients (especially P) and it increases soil organic matter levels, while in Cambisol, herbaceous stratum yield is more associated with the ability of inputs to make nutrients readily available. The use of organic amendments can reverse, in the short-term, degradation and desertification processes of soils in the Brazilian semiarid region.

TI  - A Synthesis of Magnetic Natural Coagulant and Its Application to Treat Congo Red Synthetic Wastewater
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Natural plant-based coagulant has been extensively studied these days due to its effectiveness and efficiency in wastewater treatment. However, utilization of plant-based coagulant happens to hold certain drawbacks, namely a long settling time and an increase of dissolved organic in the treated water. A combination of magnetic iron nanoparticles and plant-based protein was subsequently proposed as a solution. In this study, magnetic natural coagulant was synthesized via adsorption of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) protein on tannic acid-modified Fe3O4. The obtained magnetic coagulant was furthermore analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to observe the characteristics before and after protein adsorption. The effect of pH (2 to 4) and coagulant dosage (25 to 250 mg L-1) on the removal of Congo red from wastewater and sludge formation was observed. The best condition was found at pH 2 due to the charge neutralization mechanism. Furthermore, the highest removal of 89.10% with a sludge volume of 4 mL L-1 and a settling time of 5 min was obtained at a magnetic coagulant dosage of 100 mg L-1 and pH 2. The removal result was comparable with a crude extract of Leucaena, however with a much faster settling time. Furthermore, coagulation using magnetic natural coagulant resulted in higher removal of dissolved organics in the treated water, compared to crude extract, where the increase of organic contents was detected due to the presence of various soluble organic compounds in the crude extract. The results obtained in this study show a promising application of magnetic natural coagulant for sustainable water-wastewater treatment.

TI  - Effects of supplementing rice straw with two fodder tree leaves and their combinations on voluntary feed intake, growth, and nitrogen utilization in sheep
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB  - Fodder tree leaves (FTL) are limitless nutrient resources that provide high-quality feed, particularly during the dry season, improving animal diets, and reducing the use of concentrates in ruminant livestock farming. In order to determine the benefits of FTL, two experiments were conducted to measure the voluntary feed intake, growth performance, and nitrogen utilization of forest-type (FT) sheep fed rice straw (RS) and supplemented with either Leucaena leucocephala (LEU) or Samanea saman (SAM) or their equal combination (LS). For the growth trial (Experiment 1), 12 male FT sheep with mean initial body weight (BW) of 17.0 +/- 1.0 kg (mean +/- SD) were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments in a Completely Randomized Design. The diets were Urea-treated RS (UTS) (Control), RS + L (LEU), RS + S (SAM), and RS + 50% L + 50% S (LS). After 14 d of adjustment period, feed intakes and refusals were recorded daily, whereas BW was recorded bi-weekly for 12 wk. Four rams weighing 17.0 +/- 1.0 kg BW were randomly assigned to the four treatments over a four period in a repeated (4 x 4) Latin square design to estimate the nitrogen (N) balance study (Experiment 2). Treatment diets were the same as that of Experiment 1. Dry matter intake of straw was highest (P = 0.0001) for sheep fed UTS. However, combining L with S increased (P = 0.0001) straw DM intake compared to feeding L or S alone. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in total feed intake between sheep offered UTS and LS, but both were significantly higher (P = 0.0001) than those offered LEU and SAM. Body weight gain (3.70 kg) and growth rate (196.15 g/d) were highest (P = 0.0001) for sheep offered LS compared to the other treatment groups. Values for N balance differed (P = 0.0001) among treatment diets. N balance for LUE and LS supplemented diets were higher than that of SAM but all were higher (P = 0.0001) than those offered UTS. Leucaena and Samanea leaves could, therefore, be utilized as supplement to poor-quality straws to improve the productivity of small ruminants especially during the long dry seasons in the tropics.

TI  - Mimosine facilitates Fe uptake by <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> subsp. <i>glabrata</i> in alkaline soils by solubilizing Fe-oxides
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Purpose Giant leucaena is a tropical tree-legume that thrives in alkaline and calcareous soils. It contains large amounts of mimosine, the physiological role of which is not well understood. The goals of this study were to determine i) if mimosine is released by giant leucaena into the rhizosphere ii) if mimosine enhances solubility of Fe present in various forms in alkaline soil, and iii) if mimosine enhances transition metal uptake in giant leucaena. Methods Mimosine in the extracts of rhizosphere soil and root exudates was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to determine if it is released by giant leucaena. Iron concentration in tissue and aqueous samples was determined by ICP-OES analysis. Results Mimosine was detected in both the rhizosphere eluates and root exudates. Mimosine added to samples of goethite, hematite and FeCl3 increased Fe solubility in water. Giant leucaena plants grown in alkaline soils and supplied with mimosine had higher levels of chlorophyll, Fe and Mn than the control plants. Conclusion Mimosine is released by giant leucaena roots into the rhizosphere, where it interacts with Fe. Mimosine enhances solubility of insoluble Fe-oxides and prevents conversion of ferric Fe to insoluble oxides at an alkaline pH. Mimosine enhances Fe and Mn uptake in plants growing in alkaline soil conditions.

TI  - Effects of a<i> Leucaena</i><i> leucocephala</i> leaf extract on xanthine oxidase activity and serum oxypurine levels in mice
T2  - BIOTECNIA
AB  - There is a need for novel alternatives to the medical use of allopurinol. In this sense, the present study obtained a leaf extract from L. leucocephala, and its chemical composition, inhibitory action against xanthine oxidase (XO) in vitro, inhibitory interaction between the extract and allopurinol, and the inhibitory action on XO in vivo using mice treated with potassium oxonate and hypoxanthine, were determined. Polyphenol and flavonoid compounds were found in the leaf extract. For the leaf extract, the IC50 and maximal values were 334.60 pg/mL and 46.4 % for the inhibition of XO. The 3:1 ratio combination of allopurinol and extract showed IC50 and waDRI values of 1.35 pg/mL, 1.13 (allopurinol) and 1015.72 (extract) to inhibit XO, resulting in a synergistic interaction against XO in vitro. This combination also enhanced the therapeutic success in the mouse model compared with allopurinol administered alone. The present study presents the first evidence for the use of an allopurinol and L. leucocephala extract combination at a 3:1 ratio, as a substitute for the administration of allopurinol alone.

TI  - Laboratory evaluation of four types of biochar to manage some stored product insects
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Four types of biochars were prepared from rice husk as farm waste, sugarcane bagasse as sugar cane juice store waste, residues of Leucaena leucocephala tree as horticulture waste and chicken manure as chicken farm reduce at 700(omicron)C, then evaluated as a alternative to control Tribolium castaneum, Rhyzopertha dominica, Oryzaephlius surinamensis and Sitophilus oryzae. The character of each type has been defined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with an Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to identify the elemental composition and functional groups distributed on biochars surface. The elemental compositions refer to the chicken manure biochar exhibited a decrease in Carbon concentration and increase Oxygen content; there is a negative correlation between C and O contents. On the other hand, the chicken manure biochar is the only tested biochar that contains Ca, P, and Cl. The chicken manure biochar has the largest number of functional groups on its surface, the mortality of insects was recorded after 10 days which showed that the chicken manure biochar was the most effective which contains more different elements and functional groups on its surface. The most affected insects were O.surinamensis and R. dominica with mortality percentages 86.66 and 73.33. Smaller particles of chicken manure biochar were more effective than larger particles against both R. dominica and O. surinamensis, the smaller particles (1.80-0.94 mu m) recorded LC50 1.29 and 0.56 g/kg against R. dominica and O. surinamensis. SEM images for the affected insects showed the adhesion of biochar particles on insect's body parts, also, the sensilla were disappeared as a result of the friction between biochar particles and insect cuticle. Our results may indicate the promising features of biochar as an alternative method to control some stored product insects with considering the source of biochar which affect its elemental and functional groups contents. Biochar had different efficacy depending upon its moisture contents, with increased moisture the toxicity of biochar decreased.

TI  - Preliminary investigation on the effect of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> leaves supernatant on the microalgae lipid content <i>Botryococcus braunii</i>
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Botryococcus braunii is recognized as one of the most important microalgae species due to its high lipid content that may reach 75% of its dry weight. This amount is relatively higher than that in other microalgae species, thus potentially exploitable for biofuel production. Culture media support the growth of this microalga to sustain its culture production. Leucaena leaves supernatant (LLS) has potential as natural growth culture supplement. The present study aims to analyse the best concentration of LLS with optimum light intensity as supplement for microalgae growth by using an experimental method. This study consisted of four treatments with three replications during 14 days of experiment or one cycle of growth phase of B. braunii. The concentrations of LLS on the treatment were 2.5, 7.5 and 12.5%. The determination of light intensity for cultivation was based on the preliminary test, with 2500, 5000 and 7500 Lux. The best growth-producing light intensity was used in the main experiment. The initial density of microalgae was 100,000 cells/mL under environmental conditions of 26 C-degrees, pH of 7.85, salinity of 30 ppt and photoperiod of 12/12 h light/dark cycle. The lipid test was carried out using Soxhlet method. The results of the study showed that LLS at 12.5% produced the highest lipid content (41.39%), while lower lipid content was found at 7.5, 2.5 and 0% of LLS (control) (37.23, 30.61 and 23.73%, respectively).

TI  - Green Synthesis, Characterization and Antimicrobial Activities of Silver Nanoparticles against some Phypathogenic Bacteria
T2  - JOURNAL OF NANO RESEARCH
AB  - Green chemistry methods are now an intriguing field of study in agriculture, particularly in pest management. For this reason, novel approachesfor the moreefficient manufacturing of nanoparticles with improved biological characteristics have been developed. Because nanoparticle production is faster, this method is more eco-friendly and less toxic than old methods. The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Leucaena leucocephala, Mentha aquatica, and Zingiber officinale extracts and their antibacterial activity against Pectobacterium cartovorum, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Xanthomonas axonopodis. The results showed that spectroscopic and microscopic methods, such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealed absorption peaks for Ll-AgNPs at 415 nm, 420 nm for Ma-AgNPs, and 430 nm for Zo-AgNPs, indicating the silver nature of the prepared colloidal samples. The TEM images revealed the quasi-spherical morphology of NPs with an average size of 12.51, 10.63, and 10.26 nm for Ll-AgNPs, Ma-AgNPs, and Zo-AgNPs. The Xray diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure with crystallite. While distinctive peaks in an investigation using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy showed that several biomolecules were attachedto AgNPs, antibacterial activity was evaluated by an inhibitory zone test, which showed high efficiency against P. cartovorum, A. tumefaciens, and X. axonopodis, with an antibacterial function comparable to L. leucocephala, M. aquatica, and Z. officinale extract. The green production of silver nanoparticles has the potential to be a useful tool in pest management strategies against phytopathogenic bacteria.

TI  - Dataset of biopellet characteristics from various lignocellulosic agricultural waste and shrubs produced using different method
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - The data presented here is the characteristics of biopellets and its raw materials. The raw materials of lignocellulosic waste (coffee skin, corncob, patchouli waste) and shrubs ( Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium ) were collected from certain districts in Indonesia which provided quite abundant stocks of these raw materials. The raw material preparation and pelletization at room temperature (25 degrees C) using a manual press machine were carried out at Hasanudat high temperatures (225 degrees C) was carried out at The Integrated Laboratory of Forest Research and Development, Bogor, Indonesia. The evaluation of density, moisture content, volatile matter content, ash content, and amount of fixed carbon were also carried out at the laboratory. Meanwhile, evaluation of mineral content (sulfur, Na2O, K2 O, Cl) and calorivic value was carried out at the Livestock Research Institute, Bogor, Indonesia. The results show that pelletization at high temperature produces better quality biopellets compared to pelletization at room temperature. Pelletization of L. leucocephala at high temperature produces the best quality biopellets with the highest density (1.17 g/cm(3) ) and calorific value (4726 kcal/kg) and the lowest moisture content (4.87 %) and mineral content (0.01 % of S, 0.0014 % of Na2O, 1.53 % of I<2O, and 0.17 % of Cl) among the other raw materials tested. This dataset is expected to be a primary source in comparing and determining the proper type of raw material for biopellet production as an alternative renewable energy source, es- pecially those originating from shrubs and similar lignocellulosic waste.

TI  - Angiotensin-I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory (ACE-I) Peptide from Germinated Lamtoro Gung (<i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> ssp. <i>glabrata</i> (Rose) S. Zarate) Flour
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
AB  - Hypertension is a significant public health problem worldwide, a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cause of premature death. Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity is one of the causes of hypertension. Lamtoro Gung has potential as an Angiotensin-I-converting Enzyme Inhibitory (ACE-I) due to the presence of peptide that able to inhibit its activity to prevent hypertension. The germination process was carried out to hydrolyse storage proteins and produce peptides that have a low molecular weight. This study investigated ACE-I activity from Lamtoro Gung seed during germination and evaluated the blanching effect on it. This experiment was conducted with a Completely Randomised Design (CRD), and the factor is the differences in germination duration (0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h). Proteolytic activity and the degree of hydrolysis during germination were studied to know the correlation between germination and ACE-I activity. The highest ACE-I activity sample was blanched with three different durations (2, 4, and 6 s). The 48 h germinated Lamtoro Gung had the highest ACE-I activity (70.62%). This result was supported by the proteolytic activity (168.79 U/g protein dry matter) and degree of hydrolysis (23.26%). Forty-eight hours of germination of Lamtoro Gung resulted in the highest ACE-I activity. Blanching of germinated Lamtoro Gung for 2 s could hold the ACE-I activity, but the longer duration decreased it.

TI  - High efficient preparation of low molecular weight galactomannan from <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> galactomannan through the combination of hydrogen peroxide and oxalic acid
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB  - Researchers have always been interested in polysaccharide degradation because of the increased biological activity and usability following degradation. In this work, low molecular weight galactomannan (LMW-GM) was produced through the degradation of galactomannan by H 2 O 2 and oxalic acid (OA). The optimal reaction conditions were found by conducting the response surface optimization experiment based on single -factor experiment and kinetics analysis. Under these conditions, the LMW-GM yield was 69.48 +/- 1.02 %. Ultimately, an analysis of the degradation process revealed that OA attacked GM indiscriminately, and H 2 O 2 has a stronger effect on the removal of branched chains while degrading GM. Hence, the degradation steps were rearranged as H 2 O 2 was added 20 min before OA at a constant total time. The LMW-GM yield was successfully increased to 76.49 +/- 1.27 %. The goal of this work is hopefully to give a theoretical foundation for the low-cost preparation and industrial production of the degradation of galactomannan.

TI  - Four Invasive Plant Species in Southwest Saudi Arabia Have Variable Effects on Soil Dynamics
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Predicting the direction and magnitude of change in soil dynamics caused by invasive plant species has proven to be difficult because these changes are often reported to be species- and habitat-specific. This study was conducted to determine changes in three soil properties, eight soil ions, and seven soil microelements under established stands of four invasive plants, Prosopis juliflora, Ipomoea carnea, Leucaena leucocephala, and Opuntia ficus-indica. Soil properties, ions, and microelements were measured in sites invaded by these four species in southwest Saudi Arabia, and these values were compared to the results for the same 18 parameters from adjacent sites with native vegetation. Because this study was conducted in an arid ecosystem, we predict that these four invasive plants will significantly alter the soil properties, ions, and microelements in the areas they invaded. While the soils of sites with the four invasive plant species generally had higher values for soil properties and ions compared to sites with native vegetation, in most instances these differences were not statistically significant. However, the soils within sites invaded by I. carnea, L. leucocephala, and P. juliflora had statistically significant differences for some soil parameters. For sites invaded by O. puntia ficus-indica, no soil properties, ions, or microelements were significantly different compared to adjacent sites with native vegetation. Sites invaded by the four plant species generally exhibited differences in the 11 soil properties, but in no instance were these differences statistically significant. All three soil properties and one soil ion (Ca) were significantly different across the four stands of native vegetation. For the seven soil microelements, significantly different values were detected for Co and Ni, but only among stands of the four invasive plant species. These results indicate that the four invasive plant species altered soil properties, ions, and microelements, but for most of the parameters we assessed, not significantly. Our results do not support our initial prediction, but are in general agreement with previous published findings, which indicate that the effects of invasive plants on soil dynamics vary idiosyncratically among invasive species and among invaded habitats.

TI  - In vitro Anthelmintic Efficacy of Three Plant Extracts against Various Developmental Stages of Haemonchus contortus
T2  - PAKISTAN VETERINARY JOURNAL
AB  - Gastrointestinal nematodes, including Haemonchus (H.) contortus, have a notable impact in terms of impaired production, high fatalities, and substantial economic losses, affecting small ruminants in tropical countries, including Pakistan. The irrational use of synthetic chemicals has fueled anthelmintic resistance, particularly in H. contortus, as a formidable challenge, prompting a search for alternative treatment strategies. This study evaluated the anthelmintic potential of leaf extracts of three forage plants, including Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa oleifera, and Acacia ampliceps, against various developmental stages of H. contortus. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of secondary metabolites in the extracts. In vitro assays were performed to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of the extracts on the inhibition of egg hatching, larval paralysis, and adult worm motility following the guidelines of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology, while Albendazole was used as a positive control and PBS as a negative control. The highest concentrations of tannins and flavonoids in Acacia ampliceps and phenolic compounds in Leucaena leucocephala were detected in the extracts as major secondary metabolites. All the tested extracts showed significant time- and dose-dependent responses to various stages of H. contortus. The ED50 values showed that the lowest dose of Leucaena leucocephala (0.285), Moringa oliefera (0.81), and Acacia ampliceps (0.245) inhibited egg hatching and larval and adult motility, respectively. Extracts of Leucaena leucocephala exhibited significant inhibition of egg hatching (70.3%), whereas Moringa oliefera showed maximum percent inhibition (66.6) of larval motility. These findings suggest that these plants, traditionally used by local healers in Pakistan, may possess antiparasitic properties, encouraging further studies on the relationship between phytochemicals, extraction methods, and in vivo trials to explore their anthelmintic efficacy.

TI  - Compatibility of <i>Leucaena leucocephala</i> biomass and cattle manure combination under rainwater harvesting on sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> (L.) Moench) productivity in semi-arid region of Zimbabwe
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Soil infertility is one of the constraints contributing to poor sorghum production in semi-arid areas across Africa. To increase sorghum production, there is need to address soil fertility issues. Therefore, the objective was to assess the effects of Leucaena/cattle manure combination on grain and stover yields, harvest index and net return of two sorghum varieties (Macia and SV1) under rainwater harvesting techniques. The field experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design over three cropping seasons in a split-split plot arrangement. Results show significant (P < 0.05) increase in sorghum grain yield with increased applications of Leucaena/cattle manure combination. Macia variety had statistically greater (P < 0.05) grain yield than SV1 variety. Tied contour show considerably higher yield for both varieties across all seasons. Stover yield show significant differences (P < 0.05) as affected by Leucaena/cattle manure and rainwater harvesting techniques. Rainwater harvesting techniques significantly influence (P < 0.05) harvest index, with tied contour and infiltration pits having comparably higher harvest index than standard contour. Application of Leucaena/cattle manure combination show significant increases in harvest index with increased application rates. However, no significant effect was observed at 20 and 30 t ha(-1) from SV1 variety across all seasons. Leucaena/cattle manure combination significantly influenced (P < 0.05) sorghum net return across all seasons except at 5 t ha(-1) where no significant effect was observed. Macia variety had higher net return than SV1. To increase grain yield and net return, farmers can adopt Macia variety, tied contour and 10 t ha(-1) Leucaena/cattle manure combination due to higher incremental yield per tonne.

TI  - Evaluation of cropping systems for livelihood security of farmers in rainfed sub-tropics of Jammu
T2  - RANGE MANAGEMENT AND AGROFORESTRY
AB  - In this study, Leucaena leucocephala was introduced in the traditional agriculture system and total six systems viz., cereal-cereal, pulse-cereal, agri-pastoral, agri-silvi-pastoral, agri-horti-pastoral and vegetable-vegetable were evaluated for livelihood security of farmers under rainfed sub-tropical foot hill plains of Jammu. The agrisilvi-pastoral system recorded an overall increase in gross income (43.23%), maize equivalent yield (50.73%), rain water use efficiency (55.57%), sustainable yield index (44.17) and employment days (34.7 md) in comparison to the other systems studied. The Leucaena leucocephala plots were also characterized by higher organic carbon content and available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium availability. This technological intervention also increased the fuel and fodder (mixed fodder and green leaves) production and enhanced the B: C ratio (61.6%) of the system when compared to other systems in vogue in rainfed subtropical foot hill plains of Jammu.

TI  - Amoxicillin Degradation and Antimutagenic Potential of Phytofabricated Silver Nanoparticles-Doped Polyurethane Membrane for Wastewater Treatment
T2  - NANO LIFE
AB  - Human encroachment and rapid usage of antibiotics, and toxic chemicals have given rise to fatal waterborne diseases and drinking water crises. This work focuses on the phytofabrication of silver nanoparticle-doped polyurethane membranes (PUM) for wastewater treatment via amoxicillin degradation and its antimutagenic potential. Fresh leaf extracts of Acokanthera oppositifolia and Leucaena leucocephala were utilized for the reduction and capping of silver ions. The structural properties of nanoparticles were studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive analysis (EDAX), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The ability of a polyurethane membrane embedded with silver nanoparticles to remove amoxicillin and residual antimicrobial in treated water was also tested. Additionally, antimutagenic activity against Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA 98 and 100) with 2-aminofluorene and sodium azide mutagens was investigated in filtered water. The effectiveness of the developed membrane was assessed in a sewage sample using the catalase test and plating on an agar plate to estimate the reduction in the microbial population. The finding reveals that the membranes doped with nanoparticles of Leucaena leucocephala demonstrated the highest amoxicillin degradation (94%) and antimutagenic (99.0%) with pseudo-first-order kinetics R-2 of 0.96. The microbial population was reduced from 1.13x10(5) to 3.04x10(2 )and 2.16x10(2) CFU/mL after filtration by PUM-doped nanoparticles of Acokanthera oppositifolia and Leucaena leucocephala, respectively. The results conclude that polyurethane membranes doped with silver nanoparticles are very effective in wastewater treatment and hold great promise for wastewater remediation applications.

TI  - Potential immunomodulatory response associated with L-mimosine in male Wistar rats
T2  - TOXICON
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a plant that is used as animal and human food worldwide. This plant contains the toxic compound namely L-mimosine. The main mechanism of action of this compound involves its ability to chelate metal ions, which may interfere with the proliferative activity of cells and being studied for the treatment of cancer. However, little is known about the effect of L-mimosine on immune responses. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of L-mimosine on immune responses in Wistar rats. Different doses of L-mimosine (25, 40 and 60 mg/kg body weight/day) were administered orally by gavage to adult rats for 28 days. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed in animals, but a decrease in the T-dependent response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in animals treated with 60 mg/kg L-mimosine and an increase in the intensity of S. aureus phagocytosis by macrophages in animals treated with 40 or 60 mg/kg L-mimosine were observed. Therefore, these findings suggest that L-mimosine did not compromise macrophage activity and inhibited T-dependent clonal expansion during the immune response.

TI  - Yield and chemical composition of<i> Panicum</i><i> maximum</i> cv.Tanzania in a silvopastoral system in Chiapas
T2  - BIOTECNIA
AB  - To evaluate the effect of L. leucocephala incorporation on P. maximum cv. Tanzania biomass production and chemical composition of in a silvopastoral system, an experiment was established in two grasslands, established with P. maximum cv. Tanzania as the only crop in one of them and in the other, associated with L. leucocephala in an arrangement of pastu-res in alleys. In each meadow, 12 exclusion cages of 1 m3 were placed in a completely random design with a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement, two systems (monoculture and silvopastoral) and four cutting dates (28, 56, 84 and 112 d) and three repetitions. Chemical fertilization with Phosphonitrate was applied in each of the exclusion cages for both treatments. A significant difference was observed between systems for the variables height, coverage, production of organic matter (kg/ ha), production of crude protein (kg/ha) and the percentage of FDN, reporting the best values of the silvopastoral system. It is concluded that the use of Leucaena offers important advantages if we consider its capability for producing food of high nutritional value for animals, as well as it improving the forage quality and quantity of the system.

TI  - Effects of fibrolytic enzyme supplementation on feed intake, digestibility and rumen fermentation characteristics in goats fed with Leucaena silage
T2  - SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of adding fibrolytic enzyme cocktail, which was derived from dried tomato pomace treated with Aspergillus niger, to Leucaena silage on total gas production by using in vitro gas techniques. In addition, the effect of these enzymes on voluntary feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and rumen fermentation were determined using 8 male, crossbred Anglo Nubian x Native goats. The experiment was designed as a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square. The experimental treatments were randomly assigned to each sequence of feeding of the 4 experimental treatments, i.e., 0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.8% (dry matter) of enzyme cocktail supplemented to Leucaena silage. The addition of 0.4% enzyme cocktail increased total gas production at 96 h, which was not different from the addition of commercial cellulase. Gas production from the insoluble fraction (b) was improved by increasing the enzyme cocktail levels (P = 0.039). The voluntary intake of Leucaena silage increased with an increase in the addition of enzyme level (P = 0.025). The dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, NDF and ADF digestibility's were also increased by increasing the addition of enzyme cocktail level. The addition of enzyme cocktail increased the Prevotella_1 in rumen fluid compared with the untreated group. In conclusion, at 0.4%, the fibrolytic enzyme cocktail derived from A. niger increased feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and ruminal fibrolytic bacteria community in goats.

TI  - Cactus species and tree forage hay in the diet of dairy goats
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the association of Opuntia stricta (OS) or Nopalea cochenillifera (NC) with Moringa hay (MY) or Leucaena hay (LY) on nutrient intake, ingestive behavior, serum biochemistry, and milk production and composition of dairy goat. Eight multiparous Saanen goats were used, with an average of 68 +/- 8 days in milk and 48.5 +/- 6 kg of initial weight, fed with the following treatment diets: OS + MY; OS + LY; NC + MY, and NC + LY. The treatments were distributed in a double Latin square, in a 2 x 2 factorial scheme (two varieties of cactus and two of hay). Goats fed with NC had higher (P < 0.05) intakes of dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and non-fibrous carbohydrates. There was no influence (P > 0.05) on milk production, but goats fed with OS produced milk with higher (P < 0.05) fat content and presented higher (P < 0.05) feed efficiency. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of the hay type on the nutrient intake and milk production and composition of goats, but the animals fed with MY had higher (P < 0.05) serum cholesterol levels and greater efficiency of NDF rumination. Goats fed with OS showed greater feeding and rumination efficiency. Our results indicated that both cactus species could be successfully included in the diet of low yielding dairy goats fed 18.4% concentrate.

TI  - Potential to use invasive plants in biomass energy production: A case study<i> Prosopis</i><i> juliflora</i> in coastal wetlands of Sri Lanka
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Prosopis juliflora is an invasive plant species rapidly expanding in the Asian and African continents. The invasion of P. juliflora in Bundala Ramsar Wetland (BRW) in Sri Lanka has created several biodiversity conservation issues. This study was conducted to assess the possibility of utilizing invasive P. juliflora as an alternative energy source. P. juliflora performed better than L. leucocephala for most evaluated fuelwood properties. Ash content was comparatively higher in P. juliflora than L. leucocephala. However, biomass to ash ratio of P. juliflora was significantly lower (<0.05) and the Fuel Value Index (FVI) of P. juliflora (3,276) was slightly lower than that of L. leucocephala (3,336), a non-significant difference. P. juliflora and L. leucocephala reached Fiber Saturation Point within 24 and 27 days of drying, respectively. Results show that 1 kg of P. juliflora would produce an estimated energy equivalent to 0.5 L of diesel and furnace oil and 5 kWh of electricity. As such, we recommend further study on harvesting and commercialization of P. juliflora as a potential wood energy source.

TI  - The Effects of Two Species of Leucaena on In Vitro Rumen Fermentation, Methane Production and Post-Ruminal Protein Supply in Diets Based on <i>Urochloa hybrid</i> cv. Cayman
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - This study evaluates the effects of the inclusion of two different Leucaena species as a source of condensed tannins based on in vitro fermentation, methane production and post-ruminal protein supply in a diet based on Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman CIAT BR02/1752 grass. Under in vitro conditions, Leucaena leucocephala CIAT 17263 and Leucaena diversifolia ILRI 15551 were incubated in two proportions (25% and 50% w/w) with Cayman grass and with/without polyethylene glycol as a tannin-binder. The results show that substrates with Leucaena diversifolia produced less gas and methane than those with Leucaena leucocephala with and without polyethylene glycol. The mass in undegraded feed + solid associated microbes fraction decreased linearly with increasing level of inclusion of both species of Leucaena, while increasing its nitrogen content. It is concluded that the condensed tannins of Leucaena diversifolia possess the superior activity and that the tannin content of both evaluated Leucaenas did not affect the diet degradation, and reductions in post-ruminal protein did not occur in the present study. Further studies are needed to differentiate the tannins present in different Leucaena species and their dietary effects.

TI  - The Potential of Natural Plant Growth Regulators to Increase Vigor and Growth of Seeds Clove
T2  - NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA
AB  - Some problems in producing good quality clove seeds were the seed's slow growth and the absence of technology to accelerate its growth. Therefore, we performed the research to get one natural Plant Growth Regulator and its concentration potential to enhance clove seed growth. The study was arranged in a completely randomized design, with two factors and four replications. The first factor was five kinds of natural plant growth regulators (PGRs): (1) Leucaena leucocephala leaf extract (auxin source) + coconut water (Cytokinin), (2) Leucaena leucocephala seedling extract (auxin source) + coconut water, (3) gliricidia shoot extract + coconut water and (4) sprouted onion bulb extract (Eleutherine bulbosa) + coconut water. The second factor was the concentration of PGRs: (1) control (no PGRs), (2) 2.5 ml l-1, (3) 5.0 ml l-1, (4) 10 ml l-1, and (5) 20 ml l-1. Parameters observed were plant growth (plant height, leaf number, leaf length, leaf width, and stem diameter), the chlorophyll content of leaves, and the auxin and cytokinin content of each extract. Clove seedlings' growth was observed until four months old. PGRs from the extract of sprouted onion (Eleutherine bulbosa) and Gliricidia shoots could be developed due to their high auxin content, which can boost clove seed growth at the concentration of 10 ml l-1.

TI  - Ovicidal Effect on <i>Haemonchus contortus</i> of Extract Partitions Shrubby Plants of the Tropical Dry Forest and Potentially Active Compounds Identification by UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap/MS/MS
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - The in vitro anthelmintic effect of the extracts on Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) of three forage species in the tropical dry forest is known; however, there is no information about the effects of the extract partitions, nor their chemical composition. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the in vitro ovicidal activity of H. contortus in extract partitions of the species Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Pithecellobium dulce, and to identify the compounds present in the extract partitions with the highest activity by employing ultra HPLC Quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry. Four extract partitions, hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and hydroethanolic from the three forage species were assessed in an inhibition of egg hatching (IEH) assay. The extract partitions with the highest anthelmintic activity (AA) were subjected to analysis, from which the tentative identification of the compounds was established. The extract partitions, including dichloromethane from Gliricidia sepium, ethyl acetate from Leucaena leucocephala, and hydroethanolic from Pithecellobium dulce showed a greater anthelmintic effect, with IC50 values of 0.39, 0.86, and 0.27 mg/mL for the IEH, respectively. Metabolites with in vitro AA potential included flavonoids, fatty acid esters, hydroxycinnamic acids, organic oxygenated compounds of the benzene class and substituted derivatives, phenolic glycosides, and phenols.

TI  - Tropical tree foliage supplementation in ruminants improves rumen fermentation and the bacterial profile and decreases methane production
T2  - ANIMAL BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - The main of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementation of tropical tree foliage in ruminant diets on the in vitro fermentation, bacterial population, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and enteric CH4 production. Seven experimental diets were evaluated: a control treatment of Pennisetum purpureum (T7) and six treatments of P. purpureum supplemented (30%) with the foliage of Neomillspaughia emargiata (T1), Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia (T2), Caesalpinia gaumeri (T3), Piscidia piscipula (T4), Leucaena leucocephala (T5), and Havardia albicans (T6). The T2, T7, and T5 treatments had the highest (p < 0.05) digestibility of dry matter. Overall, supplementation increased (p < 0.05) the concentrations of propionic and butyric acid and decreased acetic acid. Methanogenic bacteria decreased (p < 0.05) in T1, T2, T5, and T6. Ruminococcus albus decreased in T1, T2, T3, and T5 and Selenomonas ruminiantum increased in T3. Fibrobacter succinogenes increased, except in T5. Methane production decreased (p < 0.05) in T1, T4, T5, and T6. The supplementation with Leucaena leucocephala, Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia, Neomillspaughia emargiata, Piscidia piscipula, Havardia albicans, and Caesalpinia gaumeri is a potential alternative nutritional strategy for ruminants that results in positive changes in VFAs profile, a decrease on CH4 production and methanogenic bacteria, and changes on fibrolytic and non-fibrolytic bacteria composition.

TI  - Maize weed control in tropical alley-cropping systems using foliage of different tree species as soil cover
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Using foliage of woody species as soil cover (SC) in agroforestry systems is an agroecological technique which may help to confront great challenges to food production, including conservation of soil moisture, provision of nutrients to the soil, and weed control. This study evaluated the effect of adding foliage of Leucaena leucocephala and Guazuma ulmifolia as SC on diversity, abundance, biomass, and potential for suppression of weeds. Eight treatments were established based on addition or not of foliage of woody species as SC to maize crop between alleys of the woody species. Richness, density, diversity, and production of weed biomass at 35, 65, and 95 days after germination of maize were recorded, and the potential for weed suppression was calculated. The study identified 47 weed species belonging to 18 families; no significant effect of addition of foliage on diversity and density of weeds was found. Production of biomass was significantly greater in the control treatment without woody species or SC than in the other treatments, while the greatest potential for suppression (40%) was found for the treatment with SC of foliage of both woody species. It was concluded that addition of foliage of L. leucocephala and G. ulmifolia as SC reduces weed biomass, increasing potential for weed suppression. Therefore, use of foliage of these species in alley cropping agroforestry systems contributes to weed control.

TI  - Productivity and Nutritional Quality of Nitrogen-Fixing and Non-Fixing Shrub Species for Ruminant Production
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Fodder shrubs are important dry season feed sources for livestock in semi-arid environments. It has been proposed that a mixture of leguminous with non-leguminous shrubs may increase rates of N cycling and improve biomass and fodder quality. The objective of the present study was to assess the biomass productivity and fodder quality of leguminous shrubs growing a mixture with non-leguminous shrubs. Three shrub species-the legume Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) and the non-legumes Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) and Moringa oleifera (Lam.)-were grown as legume/non-legume mixtures and as monocultures. Total fodder production and quality were estimated over five harvests at three-month intervals. The Leucaena-Guazuma mixture had the largest fodder production (9045 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), followed by the Leucaena monocrop (7750 kg ha(-1) year(-1)). Total nitrogen accumulation in the foliage was also high in the Leucaena-Guazuma mixture, reaching 282 kg ha(-1) year(-1); the Leucaena monocrop accumulated 244 kg N, while the Moringa monocrop took up only 46 kg N ha(-1). The concentration of polyphenols was high in Leucaena and Guazuma, while Moringa had the lowest value. The high survival and excellent growth rates, as well as the high foliage production observed in Leucaena and Guazuma, suggest that they have the potential to provide high-quality fodder for livestock.

In order to characterize the floristic composition and structure of a coastal and subcoastal xeromorphic scrub, the following study was developed, at the "El Rosal" site located in the semi-arid zone of the Guantanamo province. Twenty sampling plots with an area of 20 x 25 m were established; the diameter (1.30) and height of all individuals e" 5 cm were recorded, the sampling was validated with the area-species curve. With the values obtained, the Shannon, equity and Simpson diversity indices and beta diversity were calculated through an analysis of hierarchical clusters, by means of the Sorensen distance measure, the horizontal structure and the vertical structure through the description of the strata. of the vegetation. A total of 15 species belonging to 10 genera and 11 families were recorded, where the species of greatest ecological importance were Guaiacum officinale L. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. In the cluster analysis, three clusters were distinguished with 63 % similarity. Low floristic diversity was demonstrated and the vegetation reached up to 5 m in dominant height and the species with the highest sociological position were Guaiacum officinale, Leucaena leucocephala and Azadirachta indica.

TI  - Total Mixed Ration Silages Based on Forage Cactus and Xerophile Legumes as Alternatives for Ruminants
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the fermentative profile, fermentative losses, microbial populations, aerobic stability, chemical composition, and in situ degradability of total mixed ration silages based on forage cactus associated with xerophytic legumes. The treatments consisted of four total mixed ration silages based on forage cactus and concentrate (TMRC), associated with legumes such as Gliricidia sepium (TMRG), Leucaena (TMRL), and Senna obtusifolia (TMRS). There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) among the evaluated treatments for the pH and NH3-N (% of total N) variables. The pH values remained within the ideal range, from 4.2 to 4.4, and the NH3-N content ranged from 2.21 to 0.85%. The dry matter recovery for the evaluated treatments averaged 89%. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts ranged from 5.0 to 6.3 log CFU/g among the evaluated silages, with TMRC presenting the lowest count at 5 log CFU/g in comparison with the total mixed ration silages associated with legume plants. All of the total mixed ration silages associated with legumes presented an average mold count of 3.3 log CFU/g. Yeast populations were observed only for TMRG at 5 log CFU/g. A higher aerobic stability was observed for TMRC, followed by TMRG and then TMRS. In conclusion, the total mixed ration silages associated with G. sepium and S. obtusifolia can be recommended based on their fermentation and nutritional value.

TI  - Lipophilic profile of mature seeds of unconventional edible tree legumes
T2  - EUROPEAN FOOD RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Several tree legume species' (Caesalpinia pulcherrima, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Leucaena leucocephala, Pithecellobium dulce, Samanea saman, Sesbania grandiflora and Tamarindus indica) mature seeds were investigated for their lipophilic fraction profile. The oil yield ranged 2.1-14.9%. Linoleic acid was generally dominant (31.86-62.28%), followed by oleic (14.95-33.84%) and palmitic (7.21-17.54%) acid. Total tocochromanol content ranged 41.7-326.0 mg 100 g(-1) oil. Tocopherols (Ts), especially alpha-T (23.0-197.8 mg 100 g(-1) oil) and gamma-T (7.3-264.0 mg 100 g(-1) oil), dominated, and the seeds either did not contain tocotrienols or the content was negligible. Total carotenoid content ranged 2.1-11.8 mg 100 g(-1) oil. Only C. pulcherrima and P. dulce contained squalene. The total sterol content ranged 94-1810 mg 100 g(-1) oil, and the seeds contained mostly beta-sitosterol, Delta 5-stigmasterol, campesterol and cycloartenol. Although the oil yield is too low for commercial oil production, some of the studied species (C. pulcherrima, L. leucocephala and T. indica) could be considered as bioactive compound-rich oil sources.

TI  - Effect of tropical forage species in silvopastoral arrangements on methane production and<i> in</i><i> vitro</i> fermentation parameters in a RUSITEC system
T2  - REVISTA COLOMBIANA DE CIENCIAS PECUARIAS
AB  - Background: Supplementation of grazing cattle with native and naturalized forages using silvopastoral systems has been suggested as an affordable strategy to reduce methane production and improve nutrition, diminishing the environmental impact of cattle production. Objective: To evaluate the effect of three tropical forage species in a silvopastoral arrangement on methane production and fermentation parameters using an in vitro ruminal simulation system (RUSITEC). Methods: Four diets were evaluated. The control treatment was a basal diet of colosuana grass (COL; Bothriochloa pertusa), while the other diets consisted of 70% COL complemented with 30% shrub forage from either Leucaena leucocephala (CL), Guazuma ulmifolia (CG), or Crescentia cujete (CT). A randomized complete block design with repeated measurements over time was used. Results: The inclusion of shrub forage did not affect pH, organic matter degradation (OMD) or volatile fatty acids (VFA). The inclusion of shrub forage affected the degradation of structural components. The concentration of N-NH3 increased in the CL diet compared to COL (p<0.05). In general, methane production in terms of mL/day, mL/g DMi, mL/g DMd, and mL/gOMd was reduced for CL compared to COL (p<0.05). Conclusions: Based on these results, inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala, Guazuma ulmifolia or Crescentia cujete on B. pertusa-based diets improves ruminal fermentation parameters and reduces in vitro methane production.

TI  - EVALUATION OF ROOT PROFILES AND ENGINEERING PROPERTIES OF PLANTS FOR SOIL REINFORCEMENT
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - The potential values and application of soil bioengineering techniques are crucial for the slope protection and ecological restoration. Knowledge related to the biological and engineering properties of plants is essential for the implementation of soil bioengineering techniques. Thus, four tropical species namely Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia mangium, Dillenia suffruticosa and Melastoma malabathricum were evaluated in terms of root profiles and root engineering properties. Leucaena leucocephala showed the highest root tensile strength followed by A. mangium, D. suffruticosa and M. malabathricum. Pull-out resistance was mostly affected by the root than the shoot profiles. Leaf area index (LAI) and root biomass were strongly correlated (R2 = 0.79), implying that the root biomass would be higher if the plant canopy was higher. Tree species, L. leucocephala and A. mangium, had deep rooting system and recommended for slope protection. Shrub species, M. malabathricum and D. suffruticosa had shallow root system and suggested for controlling soil erosion. Based on the overall engineering properties, L. leucocephala showed excellent performance through its root profiles and can be a potential plant for soil reinforcement. In conclusion, plant pull-out resistance, root tensile strength and type of roots can be used as important tools to identify plant performance for soil reinforcement. The results can be an aid to select potential slope plants for implementing soil bioengineering and slope protection techniques successfully.

TI  - Assessment of Street Tree Diversity, Structure and Protection in Planned and Unplanned Neighborhoods of Lubumbashi City (DR Congo)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Street trees are always considered a vital part of urban green infrastructure in urbanized areas through mitigating the negative effects caused by urbanization taking part in human well-being. However, little is still known about their diversity, structure and protection, mostly in Lubumbashi city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), where the pace of urbanization is not only rapid but also unplanned. In this study, using an inventory, we have characterized the diversity, structure and protection measures of street trees along a land-use planning gradient in Lubumbashi for both planned and unplanned neighborhoods. From the results, a total of 1596 trees were encountered, comprising 40 species, 33 genera and 17 families, mostly dominated by exotic species (65%). In addition, most of the studied trees (63%) belonged to four species only (Jacaranda mimosifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Mangifera indica, and Acacia auriculiformis) with Leucaena leucocephala and Jacaranda mimosifolia being highly represented in unplanned and planned neighborhoods, respectively. The most abundant diameter classes in the planned neighborhoods were those with at most 10 cm against the classes larger than 50 cm in the planned neighborhoods. In both neighborhoods, trees with protection equipment represent less than 35%. Furthermore, in planned neighborhoods notably, nearly half of the observed equipment is in a good condition. Despite the benefits associated with street trees, there is a need to reduce the proportion of exotic tree species by planting native utilitarian tree species.

TI  - Feasibility Analysis of Lignocellulosic Biomass Materials towards Sustainable Biofuel Production
T2  - SOLID FUEL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Biomass is a sustainable renewable energy source that can solve energy demand and environmental pollution. In this present study, four non-edible biomass that are fast growing in wasteland and forest regions were chosen to check their feasibility as biofuels for the different thermochemical conversion processes. Senna auriculata seeds, Albizia lebbeck seed with shell, Leucaena leucocephala seed, and Acacia nilotica seed were selected. Characterizations such as thermogravimetric analysis, proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, calorific value, bulk density, and functional groups via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis were performed. The proximate analysis confirmed the minimum level of moisture content (4.98 to 6.75%) and significant volatile matter content (53.75 to 72.48%) in these feedstocks. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the maximum devolatilization takes place in the temperature range of 200 to 500 & DEG;C. The maximum value of solid residue was found in Leucaena leucocephala (31.76 wt %) and the minimum was found in Senna auriculata seeds (8.83 wt %). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the highest peaks were in the range of 3200 to 3323 cm(-1), as related to the existence of O-H stretching of carboxylic acid, alcohol, and amine groups. The calorific value of these non-edible biomass materials was in the range of 17.19 to 23.28 MJ/kg. The physio-chemical analysis results confirmed that these feedstocks are more suitable for the thermochemical conversion processes. Also, the processing of this non-edible biomass is more appropriate for future energy development and improves employment opportunities in rural and forest areas.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of mimosine degrading enzyme from <i>Arthrobacter</i> sp. Ryudai-S1
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala growing in the tropics and subtropics serves as potential forage for livestock because its foliage is rich in protein, fiber, and minerals. However, its use for livestock feed has been hindered by toxic nonprotein amino acid mimosine. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method to reduce or eliminate mimosine from foliage. A previous study found that the fermentation of L. leucocephala foliage reduced the mimosine content and prompted the authors to isolate potent mimosine degrading microorganisms and characterize the mimosinase for the complete elimination of mimosine in the L. leucocephala foliage. The soil screening of the L. leucocephala tree surroundings led to the isolation of Arthrobacter sp. Ryudai-S1, which can degrade and assimilate mimosine as a nitrogen and carbon source. Mimosinase in this strain was found to be thermostable and showed strong activity. Docking model's inspection and the interaction energy calculation between mimosine-pyridoxal-5 '-phosphate (PLP) complex and the active site of this enzyme identified 11 important amino acid residues that stabilized the binding. Of these amino acid residues, mutation experiment suggested that Tyr-263 ' and Phe-34 stabilizes the substrate binding and play a critical role in guiding the substrate to proper positions to accomplish high catalytic efficacy and selectivity. These observations suggest that Arthrobacter sp. Ryudai-S1 could be potentially useful for the development of L. leucocephala feed with reduced mimosine content.

TI  - Economic potentiality of <i>Colocasia</i> <i>esculenta</i> L. under multipurpose tree-based agroforestry systems
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND BIOLOGY
AB  - Taro (Colocasia esculenta L. cv. Latiraj) is a vegetable for many people in tropical and sub-tropical countries in the world. Because of large quantities of vitamins and minerals, it has considerable value in the food market. As the Taro has raised market demand, it needs to increase production as much as possible. Agroforestry would be a possible production approach for Taro as it can be practised in a partially shaded conditions. The research aimed to evaluate the performance of Taro under woody perennials of Melia azedarach, Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia lebbeck and sole crop cultivation to get potential production and high financial return. This experiment was followed a single factor Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. The treatments were (1) sole cropping of Latiraj, (2) Latiraj-Melia azedarach, (3) Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck and (4) Latiraj-Leucaena leucocephala. The results showed the maximum number of stolon per plant (29.50) found in LatirajAlbizia lebbeck and noted the minimum number of stolon (19.17) was in LatirajLeucaena leucocephala. Also, the highest stolon length (60.85 cm) and girth (3.33 cm) were observed in Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck and Latiraj-Melia azedarach, respectively. Moreover, the highest stolon yield (10.08 ton/ha) was obtained from Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck compared to (9.85 ton/ha) Latiraj sole cropping. The maximum benefit-cost ratio (4.78) was recorded in the Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck, 24% higher than (3.62) Latiraj sole cropping for economic performance. Finally, it was found that the Taro cv. Latiraj cultivation under Albizia lebbeck as an agroforestry practice would be a sustainable strategy to maximize the production, touching financial benefit and ensuring the proper utilization of vacant woodlots space.

TI  - Rhizosphere microbiome of plants used in phytoremediation of mine tailing dams
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION
AB  - Rhizospheric microbial communities improve the effectiveness of hyperaccumulators in the phytoremediation of heavy metals. However, limited access to tailing dams and inadequate assessment of plants' phytoremediation potential limit the characterization of native accumulators, hindering the effectiveness of local remediation efforts. This study evaluates the heavy metal sequestration potentials of Pennisetum purpureum, Leucaena leucocephala, and Pteris vittata and their associated rhizospheric microbial communities at the Marlu and Pompora tailing dams in Ghana. The results indicate shoot hyperaccumulation of Cd (334.5 +/- 6.3 mg/kg) and Fe (10,647.0 +/- 12.6 mg/kg) in P. purpureum and L. leucocephala, respectively. Analysis of rhizospheric bacterial communities revealed the impact of heavy metal contamination on bacterial community composition, associating Fe and Cd hyperaccumulation with Bacillus, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas species. This study reports the hyperaccumulation potentials of L. leucocephala and P. purpureum enhanced by associated rhizosphere bacterial communities, suggesting their potential application as an environmentally friendly remediation process of heavy metals contaminated lands.
   The novelty of this study is the report of the heavy metal accumulation potentials of the fast-growing herbaceous plants Leucaena leucocephala and Pennisetum purpureum at abandoned gold mine tailing dams in Ghana. Substantial amounts of Cd (334.5 mg/kg) and Fe (10,647.0 mg/kg) were accumulated in P. purpureum and L. leucocephala shoots, indicating their hyperaccumulation potentials. The concentration of heavy metal levels in the rhizosphere influenced the bacterial community structure, with the abundance of Bacillus, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas linked to hyperaccumulation. The outcome of this study supports the utilization of L. leucocephala and P. purpureum in the phytoremediation of lands contaminated with heavy metals.

TI  - Aerofloral studies and allergenicity of dominant pollen types in Taraba and Bauchi States of Northeastern Nigeria
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Pollen and spores have been identified as major airborne bio-particles inducing respiratory disorders including allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis among hypersensitive individuals. The present study was conducted with a view to inves-tigating monthly depositional rate of atmospheric palynomorphs to determine the influence of the immediate vegeta-tion on airborne pollen distribution; allergenic activities of dominant atmospheric pollen types at selected study locations in Taraba and Bauchi States, Northeastern Nigeria. Bioaerosols were collected using Tauber-like pollen traps and subjected to standard palynological treatment procedures, microscopy and photomicrography. Plant enu-meration within the surrounding vegetation revealed that some airborne pollen types were produced by local plants at the study locations. Spores of Nephrolepis sp., Pteris sp. and a trilete fern, as well as diatoms were also recovered. Crude protein contents of some dominant pollen types; Borreria verticillata (L.) G.F.W. Meyer and Panicum maximum Jacq. for Taraba State; Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. and Terminalia catappa L. for Bauchi State, were quantified and extracted to sensitize Mus musculus mice for serology (ELISA) and haematology (differential and total white blood cell counts). Statistical significance was tested and recorded in the correlation between levels of serological and haematological parameters elicited by each test group; differences between levels of these parameters elicited by each test group and those of the control, as well as at varying sensitization periods. In the Leucaena leucocephala test group, swollen body and histopathological morbid features showing more extensive areas of inflammatory cells and alveoli filled with fluid in the lungs, were recorded in two dead M. musculus, respectively. The study revealed that all the tested pollen types are possible allergens at the study locations, establishing a complexity of interaction among allergy mediators at varied periods of mice sensitization and forming a paradigm of human immune response to the different pollen allergens.

TI  - Prenatal toxicity of L-mimosine in Wistar rats
T2  - TOXICON
AB  - L-Mimosine is the main active component of the plant Leucaena leucocephala. Due to its metal-chelating mechanism, it interacts with various metabolic pathways in living organisms, making it a potential pharmacological target, although it also leads to toxicity. The present study aimed to investigate the transplacental passage of L-mimosine and its effects on embryofetal development. Pregnant Wistar rats were divided into control groups (CO2; n = 8 or CO3; n = 6, according to experimental design 2 or 3) that received only the vehicle, and groups that received doses of 60 (n = 9), 100 (n = 8), 140 (n = 9), and 240 (n = 7) mg/kg of L-mimosine from gestational day (GD) 6-19. For the transplacental analysis, five rats were used: two as controls and three treated with a dose of 140 mg/kg L-mimosine from GD12 to 14. All the animals received food and water ad libitum. The parameters analyzed were body weight gain; water and food consumption; serum biochemistry; blood cell counts; reproductive indices; and histopathological, visceral and skeletal analyses of the fetuses. In the groups that received doses of 60, 100, and 140 mg/kg, alterations (P < 0.05) in the skeletal development of the fetuses were observed. In the 240 mg/kg group, a decrease (P < 0.05) in total food consumption; a decrease (P < 0.05) in absolute leukocyte and neutrophil counts; alterations (P < 0.05) in the levels of ALT, GGT, and creatinine enzymes; a decrease (P < 0.05) in the relative weight of the thymus along with a loss of the corticomedullary distinction; coalescence of lymphoid follicles in the spleen; and skeletal and visceral alterations and alopecia were observed. L-Mimosine was detected in the amniotic fluid of the rats. These results demonstrate the complex action of L-mimosine, leading to toxic effects on both dams and fetuses, highlighting the risk of exposure to this substance during the perinatal period, which negatively impacts embryo/fetal and neonatal growth and development.

TI  - Alley cropping agroforestry systems change weed community composition and reduce dominant weed species associated with corn in southern Mexico
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Alley cropping systems can change the weed community composition and reduce common weed species. However, it is unclear how different woody species intercalated with corn can affect weed abundance and community structure and corn yield in the tropics. The present study examined weed species diversity and community composition in alley cropping systems with three woody species associated with corn: Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Guazuma ulmifolia Lam., and Moringa oleifera Lam. independently, and corn mono-culture, as a control. The tree most dominant weed species were Ruellia nudiflora (Engelm. & A. Gray) Urb., Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., and Portulaca pilosa L. Our results showed that the alley cropping system compared with corn monoculture reduced the densities of common abundant weed species, changed weed community composition, maintained or increased plant diversity, but did not affect grain yield (t/h). Based on the sample completeness profile we found that Leucaena associated with corn had a higher weed diversity of order q =1 and 2 (Shannon and Simpson index) and showed higher evenness compared with corn monoculture, which showed the lowest evenness of all treatments. We found nine weed species that only grow in alley cropping systems and Waltheria americana L., Momordica charantia L. and Porophyllum punctatum (Mill) S.F. Blake. with higher den-sities. Our findings support the hypothesis that alley cropping systems not only changes weed community composition, but also favours biodiversity conservation without reducing corn yield.

TI  - Levels of leucaena hay associated with cactus pear in diets for crossbred steers
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Our hypothesis is that the total replacement of ground corn grain (GCG) by cactus pear (CP) in association with 70% of leucaena hay (LH) increases dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility and nitrogen metabolism and maintains the feeding behavior of cattle. The objective was to evaluate the effects of inclusion of these feeds on the nutritional parameters and nitrogen metabolism of cattle. Eight steers, average age of 12 months, weight of 267.5 +/- 15 kg, were distributed into two simultaneous 4 x 4 Latin squares according to a 2 x 2 factorial scheme, in which the first factor evaluated was different proportions of inclusion of LH (50 or 70% DM basis), and the second factor was the total replacement of GCG with CP. There was lower DM intake in animals fed with 70% LH. There was an interaction between the factors for DM digestibility, in which the animals fed CP did not differ regardless of the inclusion of LH, but for animals without CP, the greater inclusion of LH decreases DM digestibility. The inclusion of CP decreased free water intake. There was an interaction for total water intake (WI), in which the animals fed without CP presented similarity for this, while in the inclusion of CP, the animals fed 70% of LH presented higher WI. Also, lower values of chewing were observed for animals fed with CP. The replacement of GCG with CP improves the efficiency of nitrogen utilization in the rumen. The inclusion of 70% LH depresses intake.

TI  - The relationship between host plant traits and biodiversity across three sympatric seed-feeding tri-trophic systems in a tropical region of Brazil
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - We describe the diverse community of insect herbivores and parasitoids associated with the seeds and fruits of three sympatric Fabaceae species in Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil: Inga vera, Senna multijuga and Leucaena leucocephala.A total of 5353 individual insects, representing 77 different species, were identified via morphology and DNA barcoding. The non-native L. leucocephala had the least diverse natural enemy community (N = 17 species), while two native species, I. vera and S. multijuga, were more diverse (N = 40 and N = 24 species, respectively).Individuals from the insect order Hymenoptera, a group dominated by parasitoid wasps, were the most diverse recovered from our samples in all hosts. Additionally, individual herbivore and parasitoid species were more likely to be found on a single host, with only four out of the 77 species found in more than one plant species.This includes the generalist agricultural pest herbivore, Lasioderma serricorne, found in two species, and three parasitoids connecting native S. multijuga and non-native L. leucocephala communities, hinting at recent host shifts.Furthermore, different host plant traits had complex effects on the herbivore and parasitoid communities, where seed number per fruit promoted a propagating effect on the abundance and richness at both higher trophic levels, whereas seed and fruit weight did not.We highlight the importance of including parasitoids in insect community studies because they are highly diverse and provide important ecosystem services. Additional study of the biology, behaviour and distributions of parasitoids would be advantageous to inform conservation and biological control.

TI  - NEW OCCURRENCE OF THE <i>SPODOPTERA LITURA</i> (FABRICIUS) (LEPIDOPTERA: NOCTUIDAE) INFESTATION ON COCOA IN INDIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS SOCIETY
AB  - Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a highly polyphagous insect pest, which inflicts serious economic damage on many agricultural and horticultural crops globally. During our recent surveillance surveys, an unusual defoliation was noticed by a caterpillar pest on cocoa saplings at ICAR - Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Regional Station, Vittal farm, Karnataka, India. Morphological identification and molecular characterization using mitochondrial cytochromec-oxidase (COI) gene confirmed the collected insect samples as S. litura. Hitherto, this species was only known to infest Leucaena leucocephala (CABI), a shade tree of cocoa plantations in Indonesia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of infestation by tobacco cut worm on cocoa in India. Consequently, solarization of rooting medium has been suggested for the destruction of the quiescent pupal stage.

TI  - Description of the herbivore and natural enemy community associated with the seeds of an invasive plant in Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - 1. Studies have shown that fruits of plants from the Fabaceae family harbour a diverse community of herbivorous insects and their natural enemies. Despite this observation, we still lack information on the specific interactions within these multi-trophic communities. Herein, we describe the food web of insects associated with fruits and seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae), an invasive plant in Brazil, and their relationship with plant traits including seed biomass.2. We found 17 species of insects distributed across three trophic levels. The main herbivore species sampled was Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae), which was responsible for most of the seed predation and associated with the highest parasitoid biodiversity (N = 10 species). Four other herbivorous species were lower in abundance, including a previously unreported Lepidopteran species with two parasitoids and one hyperparasitoid associated with it.3. Seeds with more mass promoted an increase in insect abundance, insect species richness, and the number of links and connectivity. We observed two native parasitoid species, Paracrias pluteus and Stenocorse suldamericanos, shift from herbivores on native plants to herbivores on the invasive L. leucocephala, consistent with a potential host shift. However, more investigation is required to ascertain the effects of recent shifts of native insect communities (on native plants) to non-native ones and their consequences on plant fitness. Our study contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of communities and food webs in unknown systems, specifically in fruits of an invasive plant, and provides information about the influence of different plant traits on these communities.

TI  - Quantitative Phytosociological study of weeds of Wheat crop in village Turlandi, district Swabi Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan
T2  - BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH
AB  - Published: 18-01-2022 The present work was conducted to study weed networks of wheat crop in village Turlandi, District Swabi Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan during 2020. A total of 38 weeds species from 20 families were identified. Data from 90 releves were collected and then analyzed through altered Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) by utilizing the host program JUICE. Base on fidelity values five weed communities i.e., Mentha-Verbena-Brassica, Lepidium-Parthenium-Coronopus, Salvia-Galium-Leucaena, Veronica-Tripolium-Cyperus, and Phalaris-Avena-Cynodon were established. Among them, SalviaGalium-Leucaena group was the most dominant community due high-fidelity index and greater number of weeds species. The most successive species which are more than 50 % fidelity values were Lepidium sativum, Salvia plebian, Galium aperine, Parthenium hysterophorus, Leucaena leucocephala, Scandix pecten-veneris, Cannabis sativa and Torilis leptophylla.

TI  - Rumen Fermentation Profiles of Protein-Energy Synchronization IndexBased Ration: an <i>In Vitro</i> Study
T2  - JURNAL ILMU TERNAK DAN VETERINER
AB  - The study examined the effect of protein-energy synchronization (PES) index-based rations on the rumen fermentation profile. The material used was the Jawa Randu goat's rumen fluid, collected soon after the goat was slaughtered. The treatment ration consisted of elephant grass, lamtoro ( Leucaena leucocephala), coconut meal, tofu waste, bran, cassava waste, and mineral mix arranged based on the PES index of each feed ingredient. The research was conducted in vitro using a completely randomized design (CRD). The treatment consisted of 4 PES indexes, namely 0.55 (R1); 0.6 (R2); 0.65 (R3); 0.7 (R4), and each had 5 replications. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and orthogonal polynomials (OP). The results of the ANOVA showed that the PES index did not affect the production of acetate (C2) and butyrate (C4) but had a highly significant effect on dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), pH, a total of volatile fatty acids (VFA), propionate (C3), C2:C3 ratio, methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and microbial protein synthesis (MPS). The analysis of OP showed a quadratic effect on all variables with the equation Y= - 81.601X(2)+375.04X-310.78 (DMD), Y= -433.69X(2)+522.69X- 128.75 (OMD), Y=-44X(2)+54.04X-.9 (pH), Y= 2160X(2)+2576.8X-604.2 (VFA Total), Y= -481.8X(2)+585.01X-143.45 (C3), Y = 50.93X(2)-60.177X+21.067 (C2:C3), Y = 202.45X(2)-223.18X+103.41 (CH4), Y= 436X(2) - 552.28X+181.08 (NH3), dan Y= -1012X(2)+1260X-311.64 (MPS). Protein-energy synchronization (PES) index of 0.6 achieved the best rumen fermentability. The formulation of the PES index-based ration of 0.6 had the most effective compared to other indexes based on the high of propionate, the lowest methane, the lowest NH3, and the best microbial protein synthesis. The ration with an index of 0.6 is composed of 30% elephant grass, 30% Leucaena leucocephala, 10% coconut meal, 10% tofu waste, 10% rice brand, 9% cassava waste, and 1% mineral mix.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration Potential of Commercial Agroforestry Systems in Indo-Gangetic Plains of India: Poplar and Eucalyptus-Based Agroforestry Systems
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Climate change, land degradation, and desertification lead to the loss of carbon present in the soil and plants. The carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere has reached 412 ppm. This is a rise of 47% since the start of the industrial period, when the concentration was close to 280 ppm. Therefore, the sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere to earth is the need of the hour. Many scientists have suggested agroforestry as a potent instrument for climate change mitigation as well as to fetch lucrative benefits. The Indian government is also promulgating tree-based systems for increasing tree cover up to 33% of the total geographical area to mitigate climate change. Therefore, the expansion of the commercial agroforestry system of fast-growing tree species producing higher biomass could be a sustainable and ecologically benign technique to sequester carbon, increase green cover, and improve the financial status of farmers. This review highlights the commercial agroforestry systems, biomass and carbon sequestration potential, and case studies of poplar and eucalyptus. The species such as poplar (Populus deltoides), nilgiri (Eucalyptus spp.), subabul (Leucaena leucocephala), tree of heaven (Ailanthus excelsa), willow (Salix spp.), malabar neem (Melia dubia), cadamba (Neolamarckia cadamba), and white teak (Gmelina arborea) are the suitable tree species for carbon sequestration under agroforestry. Among these species, poplar and eucalyptus are major agroforestry tree species that have been adopted by millions of farmers in India since the 1990s. Indo-Gangetic plains are considered the birthplace of commercial or industrial agroforestry, as poplar and eucalyptus are widely planted. This review reports that poplar and eucalyptus have the potential to sequester carbon stock of 212.7 Mg C ha(-1) and 237.2 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. Further, the net carbon sequestration rate in poplar and eucalyptus was 10.3 and 12.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. In conclusion, the commercial agroforestry system was very successful in the Indo-Gangetic regions of the country but needs further expansion with suitable compatible crops in different parts of the country.

TI  - The effects of white-popinac on regenerating seasonal semideciduous forests propagate across spatial scales
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - Biological invasions are complex scale-dependent processes. Metacommunity ecology provides the means to understand the effects of invasive species (IS) because it explicitly considers how local and regional processes interact to drive the three main components of biodiversity: alpha, beta, and gamma. White-popinac (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) is a widely distributed IS in regenerating forests in the Atlantic Forest (Brazil). White-popinac establishment results in a particular spatial occupancy as the species forms dense and homogeneous patches, instead of spreading individuals throughout invaded areas. Here we took advantage of this unique spatial configuration formed by fragments of native forest and their respective regenerating areas, partially occupied by patches of white-popinac, to investigate how local and regional dynamics of plant metacommunities and communities under natural regeneration are affected by white-popinac. We conducted replicated multi-strata surveys in 131 communities distributed among 29 metacommunities of regenerating forests that had different ages of white-popinac invasion. We found (i) Mirrored responses among local and regional scales: at both scales, native species richness decreased with the increase of invasion age, whereas IS richness increased; and (ii) beta-diversity of native species decreased with the increase of invasion age, showing that time-advance of invasion led to a homogenizing effect. We also found evidence that the advance of white-popinac patches towards regenerating forests increases with time and proximity to the forest fragment, which likely had indirect effects on regenerating communities by reducing the size of the regenerating area. Our results indicate that the effects of white-popinac invasions on regenerating forests can be so vigorous that they propagate from the local to the regional scale, via a decrease in beta-diversity. We reinforce the importance of considering multiscale approaches on assessing effects of white-popinac invasions.

TI  - Soil Microbial Responses to Varying Environmental Conditions in a Copper Belt Region of Africa: Phytoremediation Perspectives
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - The mining industry in the copper belt region of Africa was initiated in the early 1900s, with copper being the main ore extracted to date. The main objectives of the present study are (1) to characterize the microbial structure, abundance, and diversity in different ecological conditions in the cupriferous city of Lubumbashi and (2) to assess the metal phytoextraction potential of Leucaena leucocephala, a main plant species used in tailing. Four ecologically different sites were selected. They include a residential area (site 1), an agricultural dry field (site 2), and an agricultural wetland (site 3), all located within the vicinity of a copper/cobalt mining plant. A remediated tailing was also added as a highly stressed area (site 4). As expected, the highest levels of copper and cobalt among the sites studied were found at the remediated tailing, with 9447 mg/kg and 2228 mg/kg for copper and cobalt, respectively. The levels of these metals at the other sites were low, varying from 41 mg/kg to 579 mg/kg for copper and from 4 mg/kg to 110 mg/kg for cobalt. Interestingly, this study revealed that the Leucaena leucocephala grown on the remediated sites is a copper/cobalt excluder species as it accumulates soil bioavailable metals from the rhizosphere in its roots. Amplicon sequence analysis showed significant differences among the sites in bacterial and fungal composition and abundance. Site-specific genera were identified. Acidibacter was the most abundant bacterial genus in the residential and remediated tailing sites, with 11.1% and 4.4%, respectively. Bacillus was predominant in both dry (19.3%) and wet agricultural lands (4.8%). For fungi, Fusarium exhibited the highest proportion of the fungal genera at all the sites, with a relative abundance ranging from 15.6% to 20.3%. Shannon diversity entropy indices were high and similar, ranging from 8.3 to 9 for bacteria and 7.0 and 7.4 for fungi. Beta diversity analysis confirmed the closeness of the four sites regardless of the environmental conditions. This lack of differences in the microbial community diversity and structures among the sites suggests microbial resilience and physiological adaptations.

TI  - In vitro rumen degradability of tropical legumes and their secondary metabolites depends on inoculum source
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - In this study, the in vitro apparent rumen degradability of organic matter (ARDOM) and plant secondary metabolites (ARDPSM) of three tropical legumes (Mucuna pruriens, Canavalia ensiformis, and Leucaena leucocephala) were assessed. For this, 3 experiments were set up, i.e., single end-point incubations (24 h) with ruminal inoculum from either Belgian or Cuban sheep, as well as kinetic assessments (0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 12 h, and 24 h) inoculum from Belgian sheep. L-mimosine, L-canavanine, Concanavalin A (Con A), and trypsin inhibitor (TI) were the plant secondary metabolites (PSM) targeted in this study. In all three experiments, both beans, as well as forage/bean meals of M. pruriens and C. ensiformis and their PSM, were extensively degraded during 24 h incubation, irrespective of the inoculum source (0.44 to 0.70 and 0.43 to 0.78 g/g of organic matter (OM) for ARDOM, respectively, and > 0.80 g/g for L-canavanine, > 0.76 TIU/TIU for TI, and > 0.95 g/g for Con A, for both legumes). Forage meal of L. leucocephala was considerably less degraded, with apparent ruminal degradabilities of 0.20 g/g OM and 0.35 g/g OM after 24 h incubation with Belgian or Cuban sheep inoculum, respectively. This could - at least partially - be related to L-mimosine, present in L. leucocephala, which was hardly degraded in the Belgian incubation, while a more extensive ruminal breakdown was observed under the Cuban conditions (0.05 g/g PSM vs. 0.78 g/g PSM, respectively). The negative effect of L-mimosine on OM degradability was supported in an additional in vitro experiment with straw and inoculum from Belgian sheep, as ruminal degradation of straw was 31% lower when pure L-mimosine was supplemented.

TI  - Effects of 15-Year-Old Plantation on Soil Conditions, Spontaneous Vegetation, and the Trace Metal Content in Wood Products at Kipushi Tailings Dam
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Phytostabilization is a more appropriate way for rehabilitation of metal-polluted environments in the Copperbelt region. A 1.5-hectare tree planting trial had been installed on the tailings dam (TD) with the help of organic matter (OM) mixed to topsoil. Then, 15 years later, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of the tree plantation, in regard to soils and spontaneous vegetation. The Cu and Co concentration was higher in the reclaimed soil compared with the unreclaimed. Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia polyacantha, Albizia lebbeck, Pinus sylvestris, Psidium guajava, Senna siamea, Senna spectabilis, and Syzygium guineense responded well to the criteria of phytostabilization, whereas Leucaena leucocephala was very invasive. Metal concentration was manifold higher in charcoals than in woods (Zn: 3.8-39.8 mg kg-1 in wood versus 272-523 mg kg-1 in charcoal) with no differences between charcoals regardless of the origin. The tree implantation aided with amendments can meet the criteria of phytostabilization through good survival and regeneration in the heavily contaminated TD.

TI  - Plasticidad Fenotípica Bajo Estrés por Sales en Leguminosas Pratenses Phenotypic Plasticity Under Salt Stress in Legume Grasses
T2  - TERRA LATINOAMERICANA
AB  - The present research investigated the phenotypic plasticity of pasture legumes subjected to salinity stress in a semi-controlled environment. Two salinity levels were tested (0.02 dS m-1 and 10 dS m-1) to assess their impact on aerial and root biomass accumulation, as well as histological characteristics and nitrogen, sodium, and potassium accumulation. Findings indicated a detrimental salinity effect on all measured traits in the legumes examined. Species such as Sesbania rostrata, Leucaena leucocephala, Clitoria ternatea, Centrosema pubescens, and Canavalia ensiformis notably exhibited significant phenotypic adaptability to salt stress across the parameters evaluated. Aerial and root dry matter, along with nitrogen accumulation, demonstrated the highest phenotypic plasticity indices in response to salinity. Additionally, the consistent sodium accumulation observed suggests that these species may employ sodium exclusion as a mechanism to cope with salt stress. Future research is warranted to explore photosynthesis and other growth stages, which would enhance understanding the phenotypic plasticity of these legumes under saline conditions.

TI  - Detection of biogenic volatile organic compounds emitted from common tropical plant species in the Western Ghats region of India: chamber-based experiments
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - This study deals with emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from some common plant species found in the Western Ghats of India using branch -enclosure experiments. A custom-made dynamic cham-ber system was deployed to collect samples from seven different plant species. Analysis of speciated BVOCs was performed using C2-C6 and C6-C12 VOC analysers to determine the emission composition and relative concentration. Isoprene was the most abundant com-pound, followed by ethene, propene, alpha-pinene and beta- pinene. Among the plant species, Tectona grandis, Bambusa vulgaris and Psidium guajava showed high fractions of isoprene emission, Saraca asoca showed moderate emission, and Manilkara zapota and Leucaena leucocephala showed the lowest emission. However, M. zapota and L. leucocephala showed higher emission of both ethene and propene compared to isoprene. This study emphasizes the importance of emission flux mea-surements of major plant species in different forest re-gions of India, which is necessary to make emission inventories of important BVOCs.

TI  - Nutritional profiling of multipurpose tree species for fodder quality
T2  - RANGE MANAGEMENT AND AGROFORESTRY
AB  - Leaves of twenty fodder tree species were collected from Forest College and Research Institute, Mettupalayam and estimated for nutritional and anti-nutritional factors during 2019. High and significant fodder yield (kg/0.5 acre) was recorded for Dalbergia sissoo (27.36) followed by Leucaena leucocephala (24.77), L. diversifolia (23.53) and Gliricidia sepium (19.36) along with high carbohydrate (16.60%) and calcium contents. Crude protein content ranged from 7.43 to 35.0%, crude fat content varied from 1.05 to 4.81% and carbohydrate content varied from 10.40 to 17.20%. The maximum phenol content was exhibited by Ficus religiose (0.24 mg/g) and minimum in Sesbania grandiflora, Dalbergia sissoo and Moringa oleifera (0.02 mg/g). Highest and lowest tannin contents were recorded in Thespesia populnea and Neolamarkia cadamba (0.12 mg/g) and L. diversifolia, Inge dulce and Hibiscus tiliaceus (0.02 mg/g). All the fodder trees exhibited less phenol, tannins and nitrate contents, which are expected to show positive effects in ruminants as feed supplement throughout the year.

TI  - Rain water harvesting, agroforestry and goat based intensification for livelihood resilience in drought prone rainfed smallholder farming system: a case for semi-arid tropics
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Rainfed areas are the home of millions of resource poor farmers whose livelihood is under continuous threat due to frequent droughts. Assuring double cropping and imparting livelihood resilience to rainfed smallholders is a challenge. A study was planned in this direction during 2013-2021 for livelihood resilience and sustainable intensification of rainfed smallholder farming systems through rain water harvesting and agroforestry based interventions. The one hectare rainfed farming system model comprising of rain water harvesting farm pond (25 m x 20 m x 2.5 m), less water requiring food crops (groundnut-barley and sorghum-chickpea), agrihorticulture [Ziziphus mauritiana + (Sesamum indicum-Cicer arietinum)], silvipasture (Leucaena leucocephala + Tri-species hybrid grass + Stylosanthes hamata) and boundary plantation (Leucaena leucocephala and Opuntia ficus-indica) was evaluated at on-station as well as promoted on-farm. The goat rearing potential of the above model was also estimated under intensive and semi-intensive systems. The on-station rainfed farming system module produced 4979 kg ha(-1) barley equivalent yield consisting of multiple products like barley, chickpea, groundnut, Indian jujube fruits, sesame, fodder (sorghum, TSH, Stylosanthes, Leucaena dried leaf meal and spine-less fodder cactus cladodes) and Grewia fruits and resulted in 655 US$ year(-1) net returns with a benefit cost ratio of 2.1. The carrying capacity of the above model was found to be 9 and 35 goat year(-1) under intensive and semi-intensive rearing systems, respectively. The net returns increased by 36 and 226% with the inclusion of goat under intensive (US$ 892) and semi-intensive rearing system (US$ 2136), respectively in the rainfed farming system model. It was evident from the study that inclusion of goat, agroforestry and farm pond for rain water harvesting in the rainfed farming have resulted in higher profitability and resilience to less rainfall and its aberrations. Contrarily, the on-farm observations revealed that farmers could not take winter season crops without rain water harvesting. The rain water harvesting proved to be the key for reducing chances of crop failures due to droughts, ensuring double cropping (cropping intensity up to 200%) and sustainable intensification in rainfed areas. It can be concluded from the present study that intervention of water harvesting, agroforestry and goat in rainfed farming systems could enhance the farm productivity and profitability and impart resilience to the livelihood of rainfed farmers in semi-arid tropics.

TI  - Effect of solar radiation intensity of the grazing system on Pelibuey sheep behavior in rainy season
T2  - BIOTECNIA
AB  - The objective was to determine the effect of solar radiation intensity of the grazing system sheep behavior. Treatment 1 consisted of: monoculture of natural grasses (47 +/- 5 lux); treatment 2: natural grasses with Leucaena leucocephala trees (34 +/- 3 lux); and treatment 3: natural grasses with Manguifera indica trees (16 +/- 3 lux). The total time of each activity per session of the day was determined. A completely randomized design was used with a 3x2 factorial arrangement (three intensities of solar radiation for sessions per day). Grazing behavior was affected by the interaction between factors. The grazing-walking activity was higher in the pastures with lower levels of solar radiation (Leucaena y Manguifera), with 217.50 y 216.38 min, respectively, in the morning session, while all times were lower in the afternoon session, with the lowest result in grazing in the sun (108.05 minutes). The reduction of solar radiation under the treetops favored the behavior of the sheep, this allowed the animals to perform resting and ruminating activities under the shade of the trees, more preferably in the afternoon session.

TI  - Some Enzymatic and Non-enzymatic Antioxidants Response under Nickel and Lead Stress for Some Fabaceae Trees
T2  - ARO-THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL OF KOYA UNIVERSITY
AB  - This study investigates the effects of soil contamination by nickel and lead on some enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in addition to the nitrate reductase (NR) enzyme activity for Gleditsia triacanthos, Leucaena leucocephala, and Robinia pseudoacacia plant species. The results of this study show a significant increase in peroxidase enzyme activity and a significant decrease in catalase enzyme activity, proline, total carotenoids, and total carbohydrate content of leaves of the three species with increasing the concentration of Ni and Pb except for the total carbohydrate, which increased only for L. leucocephala species. Each NR enzyme activity and ascorbic acid content are increased significantly with increasing the concentration of Ni and Pb for G. triacanthos, L. leucocephala, and on the contrary, they decreased significantly for R. pseudoacacia species. From the result, we can conclude a general increase or decrease in leaves content of some antioxidants content for all the species, whereas there is some peculiarity according to the plant species regarding other contents, which in turn reflects different mechanisms of these species to tolerant heavy metal stress.

TI  - Microbial colonisation of tannin-rich tropical plants: Interplay between degradability, methane production and tannin disappearance in the rumen
T2  - ANIMAL
AB  - Condensed tannins in plants are found free and attached to protein and fibre but it is not known whether these fractions influence rumen degradation and microbial colonisation. This study explored the rumen degradation of tropical tannin-rich plants and the relationship between the disappearance of free and bound condensed tannin fractions and microbial communities colonising plant particles using in situ and in vitro experiments. Leaves from Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium, and Leucaena leucocephala, pods from Acacia nilotica and the leaves of two agricultural by-products: Manihot esculenta and Musa spp. were incubated in situ in the rumen of three dairy cows to determine their degradability for up to 96 h. Tannin disappearance was determined at 24 h of incubation, and adherent microbial communities were examined at 3 and 12 h of incubation using a metataxonomic approach. An in vitro approach was also used to assess the effects of these plants on rumen fermentation parameters. All plants contained more than 100 g/kg of condensed tannins with a large proportion (32-61%) bound to proteins. Calliandra calothyrsus had the highest concentration of condensed tannins at 361 g/kg, whereas Acacia nilotica was particularly rich in hydrolysable tannins (350 g/kg). Free condensed tannins from all plants completely disappeared after 24-h incubation in the rumen. Disappearance of protein-bound condensed tannins was variable with values ranging from 93% for Gliricidia sepium to 21% for Acacia nilotica. In contrast, fibre-bound condensed tannin disappearance averaged similar to 82% and did not vary between plants. Disappearance of bound fractions of condensed tannins was not associated with the degradability of plant fractions. The presence of tannins interfered with the microbial colonisation of plants. Each plant had distinct bacterial and archaeal communities after 3 and 12 h of incubation in the rumen and distinct protozoal communities at 3 h. Adherent communities in tannin-rich plants had a lower relative abundance of fibrolytic microbes, notably Fibrobacter spp. whereas, archaea diversity was reduced in high-tannin-containing Calliandra calothyrsus and Acacia nilotica at 12 h of incubation. Concurrently, in vitro methane production was lower for Calliandra calothyrsus, Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala although for the latter total volatile fatty acids production was not affected and was similar to control. Here, we show that the total amount of hydrolysable and condensed tannins contained in a plant govern the interaction with rumen microbes affecting degradability and fermentation. The effect of protein- and fibre-bound condensed tannins on degradability is less important. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of The Animal Consortium.

TI  - The Seedlings Growth Performance of Areca Nut Palm (<i>Areca catechu</i> L.) under Different Types of Organic Mulching
T2  - CARAKA TANI-JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB  - Seedlings is the initial part of seed plant's growth and development including areca nut palm which germination is an essential part of it. Organic mulching is one of the utmost sustainable practices, therefore, it has been employed to enhance areca nut seedlings growth. The study aims to evaluate the effect of several types of organic mulch on areca nut seedlings shoot-root growth. The 3-month long experiment was conducted according to completely randomized design, with four treatments, namely no mulching (control) (M0), gliricidia ( Gliricidia sepium) ) mulching (M1), imperata ( Imperata cylindrica) ) mulching (M2) and lamtoro ( Leucaena leucocephala) ) mulching (M3). The treatments were repeated 5 times with 20 experimental units. The findings revealed that no significant differences (p < 0.05) were found on the application of different organic mulching among all of the parameters. The treatment covered by imperata mulch tended to score the highest compared to other mulches on germination time, seedling height and shoot fresh weight while the minimum yield was recorded in M1 where gliricidia mulch was used. Application of organic mulch displayed better results for most of the parameters than that of the control resulting from an optimal growing environment for areca nut seedlings growth.

TI  - Tracing the Wanderers of the Riverbed: Home Ranges, Daily Movements and Habitat Frequentation of the Grey Francolin in Reunion Island
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - The Grey Francolin, a Phasianidae species native to India and Pakistan, was introduced to Reunion Island in the XVIIIth century for hunting. One of its populations resides in the Rivi & egrave;re des Pluies riverbed, in the island's north, a secondary vegetation area surrounded by an industrial zone. The study aimed to determine the minimum daily movements, home range size, and macro-habitat use of individuals during the breeding season, as well as the species used for roosting at night. Six individuals from four different pairs were fitted with GPS. Home ranges ranged from 2.4 to 5.8 ha (MCP 100) and from 2.1 to 8.3 ha (Kernel 95), with averages of 4.5 +/- 1.2 (MCP 100) and 5.0 +/- 3.0 (Kernel 95). Minimum daily movements varied from 252 to 513 m, averaging 402 +/- 147 m per day. GPS points were found in three macro-habitats: wooded areas with Pithecellobium dulce and Leucaena leucocephala (62%), pebble riverbed (23%), herbaceous vegetation (13%), but never in the urban zone.

TI  - In vitro effect of three tropical plants on adult <i>Haemonchus placei</i>, an haematophagous nematode from cattle
T2  - BENI-SUEF UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Vernonia amygdalina (leaf), Garcinia kola (seed), and Leucaena leucocephala (seed) are three well-known tropical plants used in African ethnomedicine to reduce parasitic worm burdens and are potential sources of alternative solution for controlling parasitic helminths infection in grazing livestock. This study investigated extracts from these plants for anthelmintic activity against adult Haemonchus placei, an haematophagous nematode from cattle abomasa. Powdered plant materials were macerated in acetone and the crude acetone extracts evaluated for anthelmintic activity using H. placei adult worm motility assay. Afterwards, fresh sample of V. amygdalina was macerated successively in chloroform and acetone and the extracts evaluated for anthelmintic activity. The chloroform extract was subjected to phytochemical and FT-IR analyses and fractionated by vacuum liquid chromatography. Anthelmintic data were fitted to a nonlinear regression equation (Log [extract or fraction] vs. lethality; variable slope) to produce best-fit sigmoidal curves and LC50 values computed with associated uncertainty.
   Results: Of the three tropical plants, only V. amygdalina was active against adult H. placei with best-fit LC50 of 6.51 mg/mL (95% CI: 5.32-7.75). Evaluation of the two extracts obtained by successive maceration showed that chloroform extract (LC50, 2.46 mg/mL, 95% CI: 1.87-3.28) was 11 times as potent as acetone extract (LC50, 27.01 mg/ mL, 95% CI: 21.32-48.57) (a <0.0001). Chromatographic fractionation of the chloroform extract yielded four fractions (FA-FD) with FB (LC50, 2.38 mg/mL, 95% CI: 1.76-3.28) 2.19 times as potent as FC (LC50, 5.21 mg/mL, 95% CI: 4.40-5.79) against H. placei, while FA and FD were inactive. Phytochemical evaluation of the chloroform extract revealed the presence of saponins, steroids, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, and the absence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and anthraquinones. FT-IR structural analysis of chloroform extract indicated the presence of key functional groups which are chemical fragments/ structural motifs known to be present in the two major classes of bioactive compounds (sesquiterpene lactones and steroid glucosides) reportedly to be found in V . amygdalina.
   Conclusions: The findings showed that chloroform extract of V. amygdalina leaf possessed relatively good anthelmintic activity against adult H. placei. This could be indicative of its potential usefulness as an anthelmintic phytomedicine to control gastrointestinal nematodes infection in cattle.

TI  - SURVIVAL OF 12 NATIVE TREE SPECIES IN RESTORATION PLANTINGS IN THE DRY FOREST
T2  - BOTANICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Dry Forest can be recovered with restoration plantings. Selection of tree species for restoration plantings depends on its successful performance under the adverse conditions of degraded areas.
   Hypotheses: Early-successional legume species have higher survival in degraded areas.
   Studied species: Twelve native tree species from the dry forest.
   Study site and dates: Pastures excluded from cattle ranching activities in Quilamula, Tlaquiltenango, Morelos, Mexico for 28 months, from July 2017 to October 2019.
   Methods: Experimental plantings of 12 tree species (N= 1,080 juveniles). Survival was registered in October 2017, June and October 2018, and in October 2019.
   Results: Early-successional tree species showed higher survival (27 %) than late- successional species (20 %). Legumes showed higher survival (25 %) than non-legumes (22 %). Early non-legume species and late-successional legumes had similar and higher survival (> 30 %) than early-successional legume species (< 18 %).
   Conclusions: To ensure the success of restoration plantings and accelerate the recovery of the forest, it is suggested to plant a mix of early-successional species (i.e., Dodonaea viscosa Jacq. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit) and as many late-successional legumes and non-legumes species as possible.

TI  - <i>Cratylia argentea </i>- review of a tropical shrub legume: Biology and agronomy
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES
AB  - A comprehensive review, based on about 170 references, synthesizing research and development about Cratylia argentea , is presented to expand interest in its dissemination and use in animal production systems. The species has been widely evaluated, mainly in tropical America, with the objective to develop it as a shrub legume and an alternative to the fertility-demanding species, Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium . The review on cratylia is presented in 2 separate parts covering biology and agronomy and quality and utilization. This paper focuses on the (1) description of the species, (2) biogeography and information on germplasm collections and genetic diversity, synthesis, (3) discussion of results from agronomic research, reproductive biology, seed production and (4) multipurpose uses of cratylia. Some strengths of the species as a forage shrub are adaptation to the acid, infertile soils that prevail in the tropics and drought tolerance in subhumid climates with a pronounced dry season. Major shortcomings are slow establishment and rapidly declining seed quality. Research resulted in the release of a blend of 2 germplasm accessions (CIAT 18516 and CIAT 18668) as a commercial forage legume cultivar in Costa Rica and Colombia. Finally, recommendations for future research are proposed.

TI  - Design, Development, and Optimization of Sustainable Pyrolyzer for Biochar Production from Agricultural Crop Residue
T2  - BIOENERGY RESEARCH
AB  - This article presents an energy-efficient biochar kiln that produces biochar from agricultural crop residues. The kiln is designed to be easy to operate and has minimal requirements for special operations. It works by heating biomass in a combustion chamber using recirculated pyrogas. The study optimized the process parameters and economics of producing biochar from wheat straw using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Central Composite Design (CCD). The sustainable pyrolyzer had a thermal efficiency of 43.69%, with steady-state operation at 517.68 +/- 98.18 degrees C. It produced an average of 54.57 +/- 1.86 kg of biochar per batch, using 36.96 +/- 3.66 kg of subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) as fuel and 179.61 +/- 2.87 kg of wheat straw as feedstock. Subabul is chosen as a fuel due to its rapid growth, high calorific value, low moisture content, efficient combustion, and minimal smoke emission. The thermogravimetric index (TGI) and calorific value of WSB were 7.14 and 25.91 +/- 0.74 MJ/kg, respectively. The benefit-cost ratio and payback period were 2.27 +/- 0.16 and 4.92 +/- 0.44 months, respectively.

TI  - Enhancing bioenergy and feed production in Southern Thailand: An approach through <i>Leucaena</i> cultivation and hydrothermal carbonization
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB  - This study addresses sustainability challenges in Southern Thailand, particularly the scarcity of biomass fuel and animal feed. It investigates the integration of Leucaena leucocephala cultivation with hydrothermal carbonization. The research compares the biomass yield and economic feasibility of growing Leucaena as a sole crop versus intercropping it with Para rubber trees. Sole cropping Leucaena produces higher biomass yields and is more economically viable. The wood stem of Leucaena is competitive with other biomass fuels used in local power plants, while its leaves, with over 14 % protein content, meet local animal feed market standards. Additionally, branches, which constitute 15.15 %-30.58 % of the total biomass, are usually left as residue but can be used for hydrochar production. The study examines the effects of temperature (235 degrees C and 265 degrees C) and retention time (1, 2, and 3 h) on hydrochar properties. Optimal condition (265 degrees C for 1 h) produces hydrochar with high heating value and energy yield. Using these branches for hydrochar can significantly boost total revenue, with hydrochar contributing 54.9 % to overall revenue (4522.00 USD/ha). Integrating Leucaena cultivation with hydrothermal carbonization offers a sustainable solution, enhancing revenue, supporting local energy and feed needs, and promoting environmental sustainability.

TI  - Morphologic Differentiation of the Exotic Parasitoid <i>Eupelmus pulchriceps</i> (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae) in the Galapagos Archipelago
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The historical and geographical properties of the archipelagos allow a detailed study of species diversification, and phenotypic traits can indicate the extent of such processes. Eupelmus pulchriceps (Cameron, 1904) is an exotic species to the Galapagos archipelago, and generalist parasitoid that attacks a beetle species that consumes the seeds of the invasive shrub Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Despite extensive sampling, the wasp is recorded only in Santa Cruz and San Cristobal islands of the Galapagos archipelago. Thus, using 112 female wasps, we compare body size, proportion, and allometric differentiations within and between the two islands. There were no body size differences between islands. A PerMANOVA indicates differences between the islands and a single differentiation between two localities of one island. Allometric differences between islands were not the same for all structures. These results are consistent with the greater distance between islands than between localities and suggest a differentiation process. The variables with allometric differentiation are associated with wings and ovipositor, possibly responding to different ecological pressures. It is interesting that this parasitoid, recently arrived at the archipelago, is already showing differentiation. Also, it is essential to monitor the behavior of these wasps in the archipelago, given their potential to access other species affecting the trophic interactions of the local biota.

TI  - Rapid assessment of post-dispersal seed removal in an agricultural landscape of semi-arid West Africa
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Post-dispersal seed removal is crucial for maintaining plant recruitment by influencing secondary dispersal and the mortality of seeds. However, data on seed removal in the northern savanna of Ghana is scarce. In this study, we applied a rapid assessment method to examine the effect of three habitat types (conventional farmland, agroforestry parkland, and woodland) and two seed species (Leucaena leucocephala and Faidherbia albida) on seed removal by invertebrates and vertebrates in an agricultural landscape using selective exclosures in Nyankpala, a town located in the northern savanna of Ghana. The exclosures, closed and open, were designed to impose restrictions that allow either invertebrates or both invertebrates and vertebrates access to seeds. Using a generalized linear mixed modelling approach, we showed that habitat type and seed species significantly influenced the rate of seed removal, with the woodland habitat and F. albida seeds recording the highest removal rates. Our results suggest that invertebrates often dominated seed removal events compared to vertebrates, possibly due to differences in allometry and morphological traits and their effect on seed preference. This study adds to the growing evidence that savanna habitats and fauna play a critical role in maintaining plant population dynamics through seed predation and dispersal events.

TI  - Quelites in poultry feed
T2  - TERRA LATINOAMERICANA
AB  - In traditional poultry farming, the consumption of fresh plants is an important part of the diet and a fundamental component of the indigenous poultry raising technique. Therefore, the objective is to know the studies that have included some quelites for feeding domestic birds. Quelite is a term used to refer to edible tender plants which are used as a whole plant, sprouts, branches, leaves, petioles, stems or flowers. The present review will consider the quelites Amaranth (Amarantus sp.), Chepil (Crotalaria longirostrada), Epazote (Dysphania ambrosioides), Blackberry (Solanum americanum), Holy grass (Piper autitum), Guaje (Leucaena leucocephala), Huazontle (Chenopodium berlandieri subsp. nuttalliae) and Purslane (Portuca olerecea). Nutritional and nutraceutical characteristics of these chelites are presented. In tests of egg and meat production, both in hens and in native turkeys, the main results of these studies are presented. The use of quelites in poultry farming has begun to be tested in order to reduce production costs, without af fecting the productive variables or the quality of eggs or meat. Although contradictory information has been reported, there is enough evidence to continue this line of study. It is proven that quelites have different nutritional and nutraceutical properties, which are intended to be used in favor of producers and consumers; however, much research is lacking.

TI  - Acetic acid as a protic solvent for reducing sulphuric acid concentrations in the production of cellulose nanocrystals alongside transition metal co-catalysts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB  - Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) conventionally involve highly concentrated sulphuric acid, which typically resulted in the formation of undesirable by-products. Although less corrosive mineral acids have been explored as alternatives, high concentrations are still required. In this study, CNC was successfully isolated from Leucaena leucocephala wood using mild sulphuric acid with acetic acid as protic solvent, and it was further studied with the addition of Lewis acids in the form of multivalent transition metal salts as co-catalyst. Selected divalent and trivalent transition metal salts including (Cr(NO3)3, Fe(NO3)3, Co(NO3)2, and Ni(NO3)2) were investigated. The morphology, chemical structure, particle size, and physicochemical properties of the CNCs were determined. Controlled depolymerization of cellulose was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Rod-like morphology for all CNCs was obtained during the hydrolysis process with the smallest CNC particles found at an average length of 278.1 +/- 35.1 nm and a diameter of 13.4 +/- 3.0 nm. The results showed that higher valence state metal ions resulted in better cellulose hydrolysis efficiency. In addition, the use of transition metal salt as a co-catalyst improved production efficiency and minimised carbonization of CNC while maintaining desired crystallinity and thermal properties.

TI  - Colon-Specific Delivery of Naproxen Pellets for Rheumatoid Arthritis: Development, Optimization, and Evaluation Using a 3-Level Randomized Full Factorial Design
T2  - JOURNAL OF MACROMOLECULAR SCIENCE PART B-PHYSICS
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by increased joint pain and stiffness, particularly in the morning, which requires medication for treatment. Our research described here was aimed to develop, evaluate, and optimize coated naproxen pellets for colon-specific delivery using the carboxymethyl Leucaena leucocephala gum for the chronotherapy of RA. The extrusion-spheronization process was used for the preparation of the pellets followed by coating in a fluidized bed processor with materials such as Eudragit (R) S 100 and L 100. An 11-run, 2-factor, 3-level, randomized full factorial design was used to analyze the impact on the responses by varying the levels of independent factors to obtain the optimized formulation. The drug release of all the formulation batches at the 4th hour varied from 1.24 to 17.22% in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract; while the release of the drug at the 10th hour varied from 76.87 to 98.39% at the colonic pH. Furthermore, it was observed that the optimized formulation exhibited an increased release of naproxen in the presence of cecal matter collected from rats. We suggest that the prepared optimized formulation of the coated pellets of naproxen shows promise for the chronotherapeutic treatment of early morning symptoms associated with RA.

TI  - Multiple Uses of Wild Edible Trees by a Nahua-Origin Community in Western Mexico
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Wild edible trees (WETs) play an important role in the diet of many rural communities. Therefore, research on their use and management is important to support both food sovereignty and local conservation of biocultural resources. We evaluated the different uses of WETs by the community of Zacualpan, Colima, in western Mexico, through 32 semi-structured interviews registering the species richness, plant parts consumed, and non-food uses. Additional information was collected on their management, availability, and forms of preparation. We used a cultural salience index to determine the food importance of the WETs mentioned. We registered 33 edible tree species (26 wild, 3 native crops, and 4 exotic crops) that were most commonly consumed as fruits or seeds. WETs were also used for fuel, live fences, timber, handicrafts, medicine, shade, fodder, poles, utensils, construction, tanning, soap, and paper. Pithecellobium dulce had the highest food salience, followed by Spondias purpurea, Leucaena esculenta, Leucaena leucocephala, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Jacaratia mexicana. Salient wild trees were collected in the wild and promoted in agroforestry systems. These trees provided food during the dry season and also had the highest number of additional uses. Promoting the biocultural value of WETs and their sustainable use can favor ecosystem conservation and local food sovereignty.

TI  - Heavy Metal Contamination in Rhizosphere of Plants at a Decommissioned Gold Mine Tailings Dam
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - The rhizosphere is an important interface for soil-plant interaction and a significant zone for the uptake and removal of heavy metals from soils. This study assesses the level of heavy metals contamination in the rhizosphere of plants growing at a decommissioned tailings dam in Ghana. Concentrations of heavy metals [Arsenic, Cadmium, Copper, Iron, Manganese and Zinc] and physicochemical parameters [pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, phosphate, nitrate, sulfate] of rhizospheric soils were determined. The assessment of the extent of rhizospheric contamination was conducted using the enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (Igeo), and pollution load index (PLI). Factor analysis unveiled the most relevant heavy metal contributors to rhizosphere contamination. Results indicate moderate to significant enrichment of Cd (1.72 - 8.28) and Mn (1.70 - 8.32) in the rhizosphere. The PLI showed that rhizospheres are heavily polluted (18.8 - 29.6) and thus require remediation. Principal component analysis revealed significant Cd, As, and Fe contamination in the rhizosphere accrues from anthropogenic or mining activities. The levels of heavy metal ions in the rhizosphere suggest that Mimosa pudica, Centrosema pubescens, Leucaena leucocephala, Pueraria phaseoloides, and Tridax procumbens could be investigated as candidates for phytostabilization of mine tailings. This study emphasizes the importance of effective remediation and continual tailing dam monitoring before and after decommissioning to avert the spread of heavy metal contaminants.

TI  - Potential of field edge rainwater harvesting, biomass transfer and integrated nutrient management in improving sorghum productivity in semi-arid regions: a review
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Sorghum has been promoted in arid and semi-arid areas due to its drought tolerance which makes it survive under harsh environmental conditions, but grain yields are very low, e.g., averaging 514 kg ha(-1). The use of field edge rainwater harvesting techniques of tied contours and infiltration pits can be suitable options to capture rainfall and reduce runoff on the soils. Furthermore, integration of field edge rainwater harvesting with appropriate soil fertility management practices can potentially increase sorghum yields. The use of biomass transfer of nitrogen fixing trees such as Leucaena leucocephala is an agroforestry practice which can improve soil fertility through increasing mineral nitrogen, cation exchange capacity and porosity, water retention, and reduce soil bulk density. Other appropriate soil fertility management include integrated nutrient management (INM) where organic fertilisers such as cattle manure are mixed with inorganic fertilisers. These technologies are examples of climate smart agricultural practices that have the potential to increase sorghum yields. The integration of rainwater harvesting techniques and INM show improved sorghum yields ranging from 750 to 2100 kg ha(-1) with potential of increasing yields in clay soils. However, currently there is little data available on the implementation of these technologies in semi-arid areas. This paper reviews and analyses the potential effect of integration rainwater harvesting, biomass transfer and INM on sorghum yields in semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe.

TI  - Relative palatability of woody forage species from the tropical dry forest using a cafeteria method
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES
AB  - The relative palatability of woody perennials ' fodder has been proposed as the selection criteria for species to be integrated in livestock systems. For that purpose, 20 species with different nutritional characteristics, that grow in the tropical dry forest of Colombia, were evaluated. The woody perennials were managed under pruning, in plots established at the Agrosavias Nataima Research Center. Fodder of those species was offered to five mature Blanco Orejinegro (BON) cattle for a total of 19 days, using a cafeteria method with each species exposed to animals for only 3 minutes. The assignment of species was in pairs, with a total of 190 pairs, resulting from the combinations of 20 species taking two at the same time, without replication. The results of the palatability trials identified nine species with very high and high palatability, which ordered in a descending manner were: Albizia niopoides, Leucaena leucocephala, Erythrina fusca, Guazuma ulmifolia, Gliricidia sepium, Tithonia diversifolia, Clitoria fairchildiana, Spondias purpurea and Spondias mombin. The pair of species that showed the highest palatability was A. niopoides-L. leucocephala; and the species frequently present in combinations with high intake was A. niopoides. It is concluded that there are several native species with high relative palatability, whose forage potential is unknown by technicians and ranchers, and the high palatability of some species already known was confirmed.

TI  - Biomass production and salt extraction by species alone or associated in the revegetation strategy
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
AB  - Anthropogenic actions have caused soil degradation and revegetation is a way to recover degraded soils. However, salt-affected soils require the use of suitable species to extract salts from the soil. This study investigated the growth of shrub and tree species in a soil degraded by salts, alone or associated with a phytoextraction salt species, evaluating plant biomass yield and extraction of elements by plants. A field experiment was assembled with eight treatments: 1) Atriplex nummularia Lindl., 2) Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth, 3) Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) Wit, 4) Azadirachta indica A. Juss, 5) A. nummularia + M. caesalpiniifolia, 6) A. nummularia + L. leucocephala and 7) A. nummularia + A. indica; in randomized blocks with four replications. After 30 months of cultivation, plants were collected to measure biomass and concentrations of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, P, and N. A. indica plants had the highest total biomass (10.75 kg plant(-1)), about 15 times more than M. caesalpiniifolia, both in associated cultivation with A. nummularia. A. nummularia plants extracted more Na and Cl in the dry matter, maximum of 124.70 and 166.79 g plant(-1), respectively. The highest production of plant biomass (23.55 t ha(-1)) and total extraction of elements (1438.51 kg ha(-1)) were obtained by associated cultivation of A. nummularia and A. indica. Associated cultivation did not decrease the phytoextractor potential of Na and Cl by A. nummularia plants and it can be used to regenerate degraded areas.

T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB  - Non-typhoidal invasive Salmonella (NTiS) diseases are one of the most important zoonoses in the world. This study explored the antipathogenic potential of twenty-four plants used in Benin folk medicine against NTiS diseases. The in vitro antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of ethanolic plant extracts were screened against clinical resistant isolates and ATCC reference strains of Salmonella. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimuriuminfected rat model was used to examine the in vivo antibacterial potential of plant extracts. Of the 24 plants, 18 plants exhibited antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.156 to 1.25 mg/mL. Anacardium occidentale, Artemisia afra, Detarium microcarpum, Detarium senegalense, and Leucaena leucocephala were the most active plant species. Extracts from A. afra, D. microcarpum, and D. senegalense showed biofilm inhibition greater than 50% against Salmonella clinical isolates. In the rat model of infection, A. afra and D. senegalense extracts were found to have an effective dose of less than 100 mg/kg and to stop the salmonellosis after 10 days of treatment. Additionally, these extracts did not produce any toxic effects in the treated animals. These results indicate clear evidence supporting the anti-Salmonella activity of A. afra and D. senegalense. Further studies are now needed to isolate bioactive compounds and to ensure the safety of these plant species.

TI  - <i>In Vitro</i> Evaluation of <i>α</i>-Glucosidase and <i>α</i>-Amylase Inhibition in Thai Culinary Vegetables
T2  - SCIENTIFICA
AB  - Diabetes management through dietary intervention has gained significant interest, particularly in the use of natural plant-based inhibitors of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion. The objective of this study was to assess the inhibitory effects of ten Thai culinary vegetables on alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, including Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum), holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum), star gooseberry (Phyllanthus acidus), galangal (Alpinia galanga), bamboo grass (Tiliacora triandra), Turkey berry (Solanum torvum), cassod tree (Senna siamea), dill (Anethum graveolens L.), noni (Morinda citrifolia), and pearl wattle (Leucaena leucocephala). All vegetables were extracted using deionized water at a 1 : 10 ratio in an ultrasonic bath operating at 350 W and a frequency of 50 Hz for 30 minutes. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the vegetable extracts ranged from 13.42 +/- 0.23% to 79.84 +/- 0.47%, while the inhibitory activities against alpha-amylase were relatively modest, ranging from 4.82 +/- 3.32% to 27.49 +/- 1.67%. Cassod tree exhibited the highest alpha-glucosidase inhibition with the lowest IC50 at 126.38 +/- 0.98 mu g/mL, followed by galangal (203.17 +/- 1.05 mu g/mL) and holy basil (1,240 +/- 20.31 mu g/mL), respectively. These results may hold promise for encouraging the consumption of vegetables as a strategy for diabetes management through the targeting of key enzyme inhibition.

TI  - Use of novel microbial and phyto-biotic feed additives in mycotoxins degradation<i> in</i><i> vitro</i> and their potential<i> in</i><i> vivo</i> application in fish diet
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Aims: This study focused on new fish feed additives that could supply a nutritional value and inhibit or eliminate mycotoxins. Four novel feed additives, including Albizia lebbeck (L.), Leucaena leucocephala leaf extracts, Serendipita indica and Bacillus megaterium were applied to contaminated fish feed; besides investigating the toxicity of these new fish feed additives.Methodology and results: Our data exhibited that the different tested feed additives were not toxic for brine shrimp larvae or fish. Albizia lebbeck extract at a concentration 0.5% was highly effective in detoxifying mycotoxins with efficacy ratios of 88.01%, 93.89% and 92.89% for aflaB1, aflaG1 and CPA, respectively and L. leucocephala at 0.5% had efficacy ratios of 93.52% and 100% for aflaG1 and CPA, respectively. The addition of S. indica with a concentration of 0.75% was highly effective for the usage of good feed approximately free of mycotoxins, with efficacy ratios of 85.65%, 90.81% and 100% for aflaB1, aflaG1 and CPA, respectively. Moreover, B. megaterium, with a concentration of 0.75% was recommended for detoxification. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: Studied new feed additives as feed additives in fish diets to eliminate mycotoxin with the potential of providing antioxidant activity. Results suggest that mycotoxins degradation can happen in vitro and in vivo by applying new fish feed additives in the fish diet.

TI  - Inhibitory Activities of Thai Culinary Vegetables against Key Enzymes Relevant to Diabetes Mellitus and the Kinetics of Enzyme Inhibitions
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most challenging noncommunicable diseases, as it causes significant costs for medical treatment as well as high morbidity and mortality rates. Dietary plants with antidiabetic properties have been explored as an alternative to synthetic medicines to treat DM because of their safety and nutrition. Hence, the objective of the present study was to determine the inhibitory activities of twenty commonly consumed Thai culinary vegetables against alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. All vegetables were extracted using deionized water, ethanol, and hexane at 150 rpm and 30 degrees C for 24 hours. The enzyme inhibitory activities were performed using a colorimetric assay. Diverse results for alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities were found for all vegetable extracts. The most potent anti-alpha-glucosidase activity was obtained from the ethanolic extract of Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 13.39 +/- 0.14 mu g/mL, followed by the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Polygonum odoratum Lour with IC50 of 25.60 +/- 0.42 and 49.03 +/- 0.72 mu g/mL, respectively. All the samples exhibited mixed, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibition. It can be concluded that the alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylose inhibitory effects of the investigated extracts may be an indicator of antidiabetic potency, and these extracts might potentially be beneficial as functional components for postprandial hyperglycemia treatment.

TI  - Reduction behaviour of iron ore pellets using hardwood biomasses as a reductant for sustainable ironmaking
T2  - BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY
AB  - Renewable biomass is a potent, CO2 neutral substitute to fossil coal and coke in iron making. However, there has been relatively little work on the utilization of biomass for the production of directly reduced iron (DRI). The aim of the present work is to characterize Acacia nilotica (W1), Albizia lebbeck (W2), and Leucaena leucocephala (W3) biomass and to reduce iron ore pellets primarily with the volatile matter from the wood at high temperature, yielding charcoal simultaneously as a co-product. The chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the three biomass species were investigated. Effect of different biomasses and reduction parameters like C/O ratio, reduction temperature, and time on %Reduction (%R) was studied. DRI was characterized using %Metallization (%M), XRD, and SEM. Up to 89% reduction was achieved in the simultaneous carbonization of biomass and the reduction of iron ore pellets at a temperature of 1000 degrees C. The pellets cooled in the furnace after reduction resulted in lower %R (e.g., W1:57%, W2:54%, and W3:63%) than the respective air-cooled pellets (e.g., W1:88%, W2:83%, and W3:86%). Oxidation was the cause for lower %R in furnace cooled (slow cooling) reduction experiments than in the air cooled. Co-produced wood charcoal after the reduction of iron ore contained approximately 76-81% carbon which competes well with a typical value for coal of 70%.

TI  - Upgrading of Bio-oil from Energy Crops via Fast Pyrolysis using Nanocatalyst in a Bubbling Fluidized Bed Reactor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ENERGY JOURNAL
AB  - The aim of this research is to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of TiO2 nanocatalyst in fast pyrolysis. Leucaena leucocephala was used as the feedstock pyrolyzed in the presence of TiO2 catalyst in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. The influence of pyrolysis temperature, catalytic zone temperature and TiO2 catalyst to biomass (T/W) ratio on bio-oil production was evaluated. The structure and surface chemistry of TiO2 catalyst were characterized by various analytical techniques. The characteristics and composition of the biomass were also investigated. In the absence of the catalyst, the maximum bio-oil yield of 54.21% was achieved at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 degrees C. Regarding the influence of catalytic zone temperature, pyrolysis at 600 degrees C using the T/W ratio of 1:1 resulted in an upgraded bio-oil product the yield of which was 59.98%. The obtained bio-oil contained 27.1% oxygen content with the HHV of 29.1 MJ/kg, indicating the TiO2 catalyst could enhance the yield of bio-oil, accompanied by a decrease in gas generation. Moreover, in this study, the maximum yield 67.1% was obtained using 3:1 T/W ratio. The obtained bio-oil consisted of oxygen content 24.5% and generated the highest HHV of 31.5 MJ/kg. Thus, the TiO2 catalyst had a potential for improving production efficiency of bio-oil product.

TI  - Root-associated functional microbiome endemism facilitates heavy metal resilience and nutrient poor adaptation in native plants under serpentine driven edaphic challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Serpentine soils are characterized by high concentrations of heavy metals (HMs) and limited essential nutrients with remarkable endemic plant diversity, yet the mechanisms enabling plant adaptation to thrive in such harsh environments remain largely unknown. Full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, coupled with physiological and functional assays, was used to explore root-associated bacterial community composition and their metabolic and ecological functions. The results revealed that serpentine plant species exhibited significantly higher metal transfer factor values compared to non-serpentine plant species, particularly evident in Bidens pilosa, Miscanthus floridulus, and Leucaena leucocephala. The serpentine root-associated microbes showed a higher utilization of carboxylic acid, whereas carbohydrate utilization was higher in the non-serpentine site. Zymomonas mobilis and Flavabacterium sp. exhibited high resistance to heavy metal concentrations, showing greater adaptability, while, Staphylococcus carnosus showed sensitivity to HMs, showing limited adaptability. Moreover, Ni, Cr, and Co resistance genes were found, while nitrogen and phosphorous metabolism genes were less abundant in the serpentine site compared to the non-serpentine site. Furthermore, Flavobacterium sp. had a strong positive relationship with Cd and Cu, Zymomonas mobilis with Ni, and Cr, Streptomyces sp. with Co, and Staphylococcus carnosus with N and P cycling. These findings underscore critical role of root-associated bacterial communities and distinctive soil conditions of serpentine habitats in fostering ecological adaptation of native plant species to the challenges posed by HMs and nutrient deficiencies.

TI  - Seasonal variations in the nutritive value of fifteen multipurpose fodder tree species: A case study of north-western Himalayan mid-hills
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Multipurpose tree species are recognized as an important fodder source for livestock, but their potential remains untapped due to dearth of knowledge about their nutritive value. Therefore, 15 MPTs, i.e., Acacia catechu, Albizia chinensis, Bauhinia variegata, Celtis australis, Ficus roxburghii, Grewia optiva, Leucaena leucocephala, Melia composita, Morus serrata, Olea glandulifera, Ougienia oojeinensis, Pittosporum floribundum, Quercus glauca, Q. leucotrichophora and Salix tetrasperma were evaluated for nutritional characteristics, relative nutritive value index (RNVI), palatability index and farmers' preference on a seasonal basis in north-western Himalayas mid-hills. Most of the nutritive and mineral content decreased as leaves matured with the exception of ether extract, calcium, copper, organic matter and carbohydrate content, while cell-wall constituents and anti-nutritional contents increased. Overall, M. serrata had the highest RNVI in spring and summer, while G. optiva during autumn and winter. Similarly, L. leucocephala had the highest palatability (97.86%), while M. composita (38.47%) had the lowest one. Additionally, G. optiva was the most favored MPT for livestock among farmers, while M. composita was the least ones. The outcome of the study will help policy makers, planners and farm managers in establishing large scale plantations of highly nutritious and palatable species, like G. optiva, L. leucocephala, B. variegata, and M. serrata for year-round supply of green leaves and as a supplement to low-quality feed.

TI  - RETRACTED: Phytotoxicological study of selected poisonous plants from Azad Jammu & Kashmir (Retracted Article)
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Poisonous plants cause tremendous economic losses to the livestock industry. These economic losses are deterioration in their health, decreased productivity, deformed offspring, and reduced longevity. The current study is the first comprehensive report on poisonous plants of Azad Jammu and Kashmir which systematically documents the phytotoxicological effect and mode of action in livestock. The information was gathered from 271 informants including 167 men and 104 women through semi-structured interviews and literature search through available databases. The data collected through interviews was analyzed with quantitative tools viz. the factor informant consensus and fidelity level. A total of 38 species of flowering plants belonging to 23 families and 38 genera were reported. Family Asteraceae (5 spp) was the most dominant, followed by Solanaceae (4 spp), Fabaceae (4 spp), Euphorbiaceae (4 spp) and Convolvulaceae (3 spp). Among all the species collected, herbs were the dominant life form (22 spp, 57.89%), trailed by shrubs (11 spp, 28.95%), and trees (5 spp, 13.16%). Whole plant toxicity was reported to be the highest (15 spp, 39.47%), followed by leaf toxicity (12 spp, 31.58%), seed toxicity (4 spp, 7.89%), fruit toxicity (3 spp, 10.53%), latex toxicity (2 spp, 5.26%), flowers toxicity (1 spp, 2.63%), and berries toxicity (1 spp, 2.63%). The most toxic route of administration was found oral (39 spp, 40.63%), followed by intraperitoneal (24 spp, 25%), and intravenous (21 spp, 21.88%). The most commonly affected organ was found liver (20.41%), followed by gastrointestinal tract (20.341%), CNS (16.33%), skin (14.29%), kidneys (12.24%), lungs (4.04%), reproductive organs (2.04%), spleen (1.75%), blood (1.75%), heart (1.75%), urinary tract (1.75%), and pancreas (1.75%). The maximum Fic value was found for dermatological disorders (0.91), followed by the endocrine system (0.90), gastrointestinal (0.82), neurology (0.77), nephrology (0.67), cardiovascular (0.67), urinary (0.67), respiratory (0.60), sexual (0.60) disorders. Senecio vulgaris, and Ageratum conyzoides were the most important plants with fidelity level (0.95) and (0.87). Nerium oleander, Lantana camara, Leucaena leucocephala, and Ricinus communis were the important poisonous plant with maximum fidelity level (100%). Ricinus communis with reported lowest LD50 (<20 mg/kg) was the top-ranked poisonous plant followed by Lantana camara and Justicia adhatoda (25-50 mg/kg), Nerium Oleander (157.37 mg/kg), and Datura innoxia (400 mg/kg). We found that knowledge about poisonous plants is less prevailing in the rural areas of Azad Kashmir compared to the knowledge about medicinal plants and poisonous nature of reported plants is due to production of toxic substances and presence of essential oils.

TI  - Evaluation of tropical top feed species for their nutritional properties, <i>in vitro</i> rumen digestibility, gas production potential and polyphenolic profile
T2  - RANGE MANAGEMENT AND AGROFORESTRY
AB  - The present study was planned to screen nutritional properties of eight different species of top feeds viz., Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, Bambusa vulgaris, Ficus benghalensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Pithecellobium dulce, Senegalia catechu and Terminalia arjuna used in southern Gujarat, India. Top feeds were assessed for their chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, gas production potential and polyphenolic fraction using rumen liquor of Surti buffalo. To check resemblance, two conventional fodders Sorghum vulgare and Medicago sativa were also assessed. Crude protein (CP) content was in the range of 10.28 (Acacia nilotica) to 21.71% (Pithecellobium dulce). The NDF content varied from 35.57% (Acacia nilotica) to 64.47% (Bambusa vulgaris). Acacia nilotica had the highest total phenolic (12.60%) content, whereas Azadirachta indica had higher condensed tannin (CT) content (8.60%). In vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) of top feeds ranged from 75.41 to 86.71% and 50.09 to 72.67%, respectively. The in vitro gas production (IVGP) was high (P>0.05) in Azadirachta indica (44.00 ml). Results revealed that all proximate components, fiber fractions, mineral content, total phenols and their fractions in top feeds were found comparable to or better than conventional fodders. Major parameters of in vitro digestibility were also resemblance and more comparable to conventional fodders. However, Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, and Pithecellobium dulce were found best suitable amongst top feeds by considering their chemical composition, phenolic contents and in vitro rumen evaluation.

TI  - Economic-environmental assessment of silvo-pastoral systems in Colombia: An ecosystem service perspective
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Cattle production in Colombia has an important social and economic role but causes considerable environmental impacts, such as deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions by ruminants, particularly methane. Thus, technological innovations aimed at reducing these impacts must focus on both economic and environmental sustainability. Silvo-pastoral systems (SPS) offer productivity increases while generating environmental benefits and ecosystem services and are therefore at the center of debate around sustainable production alternatives. The objective of this article is to evaluate the economic-environmental performance of two proposed SPS for a cattle fattening system for the Colombian context: (i) Urochloa brizantha cv. Toledo and (ii) Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman, both in association with Leucaena leucocephala trees for browsing and shade provision. They are compared with the respective base scenarios of only using the grasses in monocultures. The study consists of a financial analysis, which estimates potential profitability increases in beef production in the SPS, and an environmental evaluation, which estimates the monetary values of microclimatic regulation and reduction of methane emissions. The value of methane emission reductions is then integrated into a combined economic-environmental evaluation. Results show that both SPS improve the profitability indicators of the production system and reduce the probability of economic loss. Likewise, the reduction of methane emissions in the SPS is estimated at US$6.12 per cattle, and the economic value of microclimatic regulation at US $2,026 per hectare.

TI  - Emission factors of PM2.5-Bounded selected metals, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and water-soluble ionic species emitted from combustions of biomass materials for source Apportionment-A new database for 17 plant species
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Over the past few years, burning agricultural or crop residues has resulted in serious air pollution, particularly in northern Thailand. In this study, constant endeavours were made to achieve the first-hand emission factors (EFs) of water-soluble ionic species (WSIS), organic carbon, elemental carbon, and selected metals emitted from the combustion of 17 plant species. The average EF values of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) ranged from 280 g kg??? 1 to 1441 g kg??? 1 and from 32 g kg??? 1 to 142 g kg- 1, respectively. Sugarcane burning shows the highest EFs of toxic metals, such as V, Cr, Co, Ni, and Pb, which is concerning because Thailand is the world???s second largest sugar exporter. The comparatively high percentage contribution of Cl??? coupled with extremely low levels of K+ resulted in questions on its reliability as a chemical tracer for maritime aerosols and biomass burning particles, respectively. OC/EC ratios varied from 4.68 (Leucaena leucocephala) to 11.4 (Terminalia catappa) with the average value of 8.88 ?? 1.72. Further attempts to investigate the most suitable diagnostic binary ratios of metals representing biomass burning were conducted using 2D plots of Zn/Mn, Fe/Zn, Fe/Cu, Ni/Co, Mn/Cr, Ni/V, Al/Si, and Pb/As. In this study, Mn/Cr versus Ni/V and Pb/As versus Al/Si can be used as diagnostic binary ratios to classify biomass-burning-related aerosols.

TI  - Bio-phenols production via hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived guaiacol and bio-oil over high water-tolerant NiMo/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalysts
T2  - CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Transformation of some oxygenated compounds in bio-oil derived from biomass pyrolysis via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) generally improves its quality and potentially produces bio-based chemicals. Although alumina (Al2O3) supported catalysts are normally applied for HDO, they have certain limitations, such as acidity and high susceptibility to water, which need to be improved. In this research, an Al2O3-incorporated zirconia (ZrO2) composite (AZ) was prepared as a support of nickel (Ni)-molybdenum (Mo) catalysts used for HDO of guaiacol (GUA) and real bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala trunks to produce phenols. In the absence of water, the NiMo catalyst supported on AZ at 1/1 Al2O3/ZrO2 molar ratio [NiMo/AZ(1/1)] having higher reducibility with a greater number of weak-medium acid sites provided >98% GUA conversion with 87% selectivity to phenols. In the presence of water, the NiMo/AZ(1/1) catalyst maintained its catalytic activity, whereas NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst showed its deactivation to obtain the lowering GUA conversion (27.1% reduction). The FESEM and Al-27-NMR analyses revealed that the addition of ZrO2 improved the water tolerance of the catalyst by protecting the Al2O3 structure and preventing the transformation of Lewis acid-related tetrahedral Al to octahedral Al. Moreover, the NiMo/AZ(1/1) catalyst exhibited the highest HDO activity for real bio-oil without solvents, achieving a maximum oil yield of 25.2 wt% with 75.6% selectivity to phenols and the lowest coke formation.

TI  - Co-Inoculation of Phosphate-Solubilizing Bacteria and Rhizobia Increases Phosphorus Availability and Promotes the Development of Forage Legumes
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Tropical grassland soils, especially those with alkaline properties, often exhibit limited phosphorus availability due to its precipitation in insoluble forms. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and rhizobia have demonstrated their potential to enhance the availability of this nutrient and promote the growth of forage legumes. This study, conducted under controlled conditions in a mesh house, evaluated the effect of co-inoculation with PSB, including Micrococcus sp. Sfcm-14-01, Agrobacterium sp. Sfl-043-09, and Enterobacter sp. Sfcm-014-02 and Sfcm-054-06, along with rhizobia (Ensifer terangae R1-012-02 and Bradyrhizobium glycinis Rcm-025-01), under different levels of phosphorus fertilization on the legumes Leucaena leucocephala and Centrosema macrocarpum. The results indicate significant increases in various growth parameters, such as chlorophyll levels (SPAD), biomass (dry weight of roots and aerial parts) (mg), the foliar phosphorus concentration (ppm), and the concentration of available phosphorus in the soil, particularly under low-phosphorus fertilization conditions. The highest level of available phosphorus in the soil was achieved with 75% of the recommended fertilization dose, resulting in concentrations of 13.73 ppm for L. leucocephala and 7.69 ppm for C. macrocarpum, representing increases in phosphorus availability of 170.81% and 240.27%, respectively, compared with no fertilization or inoculation. These findings suggest that the co-inoculation of PSB and native rhizobia is a promising strategy to enhance the biomass productivity and mineral content of forage in tropical grazing systems, especially under phosphorus-limited conditions.

TI  - Forest structure and diversity in a fragment of dry deciduous forest associated with human communities in Manabi, Ecuador
T2  - AVANCES
AB  - The objective of the research was to evaluate the structure and diversity of a fragment of dry deciduous forest in Manabi, Ecuador. Thirty plots of 0.10 ha were established, equally distributed in the human settlements La Pila Vieja, San Francisco, Quimis, Via a Membrillal and Las Mercedes, where individuals of tree species =2 m in height and diameter at 1, 30 m =5 cm, validated using the rarefaction curve. Structure and diversity were evaluated with the Shannon and Pielou Equity indices compared to the baseline of a conserved Macara forest in Loja. The affectation to the forest by community was carried out through a cluster analysis using the species and abundances, with the Dice similarity index and a correspondence analysis between the richness of species and communities. 1397 individuals belonging to 61 species were recorded. The cluster and correspondence analysis indicated differences in the structure of the forest in the five sectors, but without notoriety in relation to the baseline. Overall, Shannon diversity was rated as medium influenced by abundant and dominant species. Three structurally differentiated groups were identified. The ecologically important species were: Ceiba trichistandra, Bursera graveolens, Guazuma ulmifolia, Leucaena leucocephala and Cordia lutea; while on the other hand they register little natural regeneration despite being abundant in the adult mass. What should affect restoration actions as part of the management and conservation for the maintenance of the structure and composition in this fragment of forest.

TI  - Roost tree characteristics of <i>Pteropus medius</i> (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) in the midland laterite hillocks of northern Kerala, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC BIODIVERSITY
AB  - The roost tree characteristics of Indian flying fox (Pteropus medius) were studied in the midland laterite hillocks of northern Kerala in peninsular India. A total of 170 trees belonging to 20 families, 32 genera, and 37 species were identified as roost trees from eleven roost sites located in Kannur and Kasargod districts of northern Kerala. Roost tree parameters such as habit, origin, diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, bole height, crown length, crown spread, and crown closure were analyzed. Families Ana-cardiaceae and Lamiaceae represented more number of roost trees in the study area. The mean bat abundance per tree for the entire study area was found to be 54.35 +/- 5.2 and it was highest for Ficus religiosa (peepal) followed by Tetrameles nudiflora (false hemp tree) and Leucaena leucocephala (subabul). Bats showed a preference for native trees and did not show any difference in the selection of evergreen and deciduous trees for roosting. The study also revealed that P. medius prefers large trees with greater height, diameter, crown length, and crown spread. As the midland laterite hillocks are under severe habitat degradation, the study recommends preserving large trees for better conservation of the remaining habitats of P. medius in the area.

TI  - Physiological and transcriptome analyses reveal tissue-specific responses of Leucaena plants to drought stress
T2  - PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) is a leguminous tree widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions due to its strong environmental suitability for abiotic stresses, especially drought. However, the molecular mechanisms and key pathways involved in Leucaena ' s drought response require further elucidation. Here, we comparatively analyzed the physiological and early transcriptional responses of Leucaena leaves and roots under drought stress simulated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments. Drought stress induced physiological changes in Leucaena seedlings, including decreases in relative water content (RWC) and increases in relative electrolyte leakage (REL), malondialdehyde (MDA), proline contents as well as antioxidant enzyme activities. In response to drought stress, 6461 and 8295 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the leaves and roots, respectively. In both tissues, the signaling transduction pathway of plant hormones was notably the most enriched. Specifically, abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and signaling related genes ( NCED , PP2C , SnRK2 and ABF ) were strongly upregulated particularly in leaves. The circadian rhythm, DNA replication, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and secondary metabolites biosynthesis related pathways were repressed in leaves, while the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis processes were promoted in roots. Furthermore, heterologous overexpression of Leucaena drought-inducible genes ( PYL5 , PP2CA , bHLH130 , HSP70 and AUX22D ) individually in yeast increased the tolerance to drought and heat stresses. Overall, these results deepen our understanding of the tissue-specific mechanisms of Leucaena in response to drought and provide target genes for future drought-tolerance breeding engineering in crops.

TI  - Arboreal structure in hydrological regimes present in a gallery forest of northeast Mexico
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS Y RECURSOS AGROPECUARIOS
AB  - The study of the structure and diversity of forest ecosystems is essential to understand the functioning and dynamics of forests. The structure and diversity of woody species in different types of watercourses along the Santa Catarina river in Nuevo Leon, Mexico were described. Three conditions were identified: permanent (I), I ), semipermanent (II) II ) and temporary (III). III ). In each condition, 14 rectangular sites of 1 000 m2 2 were established. All species were identified. The crown diameter of each individual was measured. The Importance Value Index (IVI) IVI ) was determined for each condition. Species richness and diversity was calculated with the Margalef (DMg) D Mg ) and Shannon- Wiener (H') H' ) indices. In addition, the similarity between conditions was determined using the Sorensen index (Is). Is ). 32 species, 29 genus and 16 families were identified. Condition I recorded greater specific richness and greater diversity with 28 species and a diversity value H' = 2.41 +/- 0.710, where Salix nigra presented the highest IVI. . Condition II presented the highest Margalef richness with a D Mg value = 1.77 +/- 0.22. In condition III Leucaena leucocephala turned out to be the most important species. The similarity between conditions was greater than 50%. The results demonstrate the structural variation of the vegetation in different hydrological regimes, which constitutes a solid base for future investigations on the development of the vegetation associated with the Santa Catarina river, and other riparian areas of north of Mexico.

TI  - Physiological adaptability of pregnant doe Kacang goats in a dry-land-area of Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR AND BIOMETEOROLOGY
AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the physiological adaptability of pregnant doe Kacang goats in a dryland area of Indonesia. Thirty pregnant doe Kacang goats aged 2-3 years were observed. The rearing system was semi-intensive without giving concentrated feeds. Local grasses and legumes such as Leucaena leucocephala leaves, Gliricidia sepium leaves, Sesbania grandiflora leaves, and drinking water were offered ad libitum. Experimental data such as respiration rate, rectal temperature, adaptability coefficient, heart rate, and heat tolerance coefficient, were collected during 2-3 months of gestation. The mean and standard deviation were calculated using a descriptive analysis method. The average humidity in the morning and afternoon and the ambient temperature in the middle of the day were outside the normal range. The THI value indicates that the experimental animals are under medium heat stress. The average values of HTC, AC, RT, HR, and RR were still typical for goats. In conclusion, although the average ambient temperature at midday and humidity in the morning and afternoon were outside of the normal range, they did not cause any effects on feed and water intake, health, and fetus growth and development of pregnant doe Kacang goats. This happened because the Kacang goat is a local breed that can adapt well to extreme environments. Therefore, pregnant doe Kacang goats in Malaka District can be allowed to graze in the paddock throughout the day and housed at night.

TI  - Anthelmintic evaluation of four fodder tree extracts against the nematode <i>Haemonchus contortus</i> under <i>in vitro</i> conditions
T2  - REVISTA MEXICANA DE CIENCIAS PECUARIAS
AB  - The objective was to evaluate the nematocidal effect of four hydroalcoholic extracts (HAE) of Brosimum alicastrum (HAE-Ba), Guazuma ulmifolia (HAE-Gu), Erythrina americana (HAE-Ea) and Leucaena leucocephala (HAE-Ll) against Haemonchus contortus. The tests of egg hatching inhibition (EHI) and larval (infective larvae) mortality were used. The treatments were HAEs at concentrations of 6.25-50 mg/mL for EHI and 25-100 mg/mL for larval mortality, ivermectin (5 mg/mL, positive control) and distilled water (negative control). Data were analyzed using an ANOVA and treatments with a concentration -dependent effect were subjected to a regression analysis to determine lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90). In addition, a phytochemical analysis was performed on the extracts to identify the presence of the main secondary metabolites. The best ovicidal and larvicidal activity was observed in HAE-Gu with 96.78 % EHI at 6.25 mg/mL and 57.2 % larval mortality at 75 mg/mL. Followed by HAE-Ba showing 90 % EHI at 6.25 mg/mL and 58.0 % larval mortality at 75 mg/mL. The LC50 and LC90 of HAE-Gu on EHI were 2.7 and 4.4 mg/mL, respectively. While the LCs of this same extract on larvae were LC50= 64 and LC90= 125 mg/mL. The phytochemical analysis indicates that all extracts contain tannins, coumarins, flavonoids and terpenes. The fodder species G. ulmifolia and E. americana could be candidate plants for the control of H. contortus.

TI  - Diversity, composition, and structure of the vegetation in cattle farms of the Cesar River valley, Colombia: forests, silvopastoral systems, and conventional pastures
T2  - CALDASIA
AB  - Silvopastoral systems have been promoted as part of a strategy to improve livestock productivity and ecosystem services in the Cesar River Valley, Colombia. Between 2014 and 2017, patterns of diversity, structure, and composition of the vegetation (> 2.5 cm DBH) were studied in 35 plots of 1000 m 2 located in silvopastoral systems, conventional pastures, and forests in cattle farms of the region. A total of 1852 individuals were registered, distributed in 281 morphospecies, 109 genera, and 44 families. The most abundant families were Fabaceae (35%), Bignoniaceae (7.5%), and Myrtaceae (6.7%). Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit , Eucalyptus cf. tereticornis Sm. , and Roseodendron chryseum (S.F. Blake) Miranda were the most abundant species. Forest fragments and riparian forests presented the highest values for plant density, canopy cover, leaf index, the total volume of vegetation, and species richness, followed by paddocks with scattered trees and mixed fodder banks. The largest trees were found in the relicts of forests and paddocks with scattered trees ( Peltogyne purpurea Pitter. , Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Jacq.) Griseb. , Anacardium excelsum (Bertero & Balb.) Skeels. , Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn. , and Albizia saman (Jacq.) Merr.). Silvopastoral arrangements contribute to landscape connectivity and complement the role of forest fragments to conserve 14.2 % of the tree species in the Cesar River Valley. However, restoring this landscape requires conserving and connecting existing forest fragments, scaling up livestock systems with trees and shrubs, and integrating a greater diversity of native species across all land uses.

TI  - A review of bioengineering techniques for slope stability in Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Slope erosion and shallow failures occur in developed areas in Malaysia as a result of the natural vegetation removal, resulting in soil disturbance and greater exposure of bare ground. The use of bioengineering techniques through vegetation is a preferred solution to these problems by providing cover from rainfall and reinforcing the soil through root systems. Considering the potential of bioengineering in slope management, the current study aims to (i) review slope bioengineering techniques that uses vegetation to stabilise slope in Malaysia and (ii) highlight research gaps. Findings were discussed from 17 original studies published between 2000 and 2020, which were selected from the output of four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar), several grey literature works, and local scientific publications. The studies on bioengineering using vegetation recorded that several slope species with superior performance in terms of beneficial traits, such as root length density and transpiration rate, were more prominent in Melastoma malabathricum and Leucaena leucocephala. Moreover, previous studies identified biomaterials that protected slopes, including empty fruit bunch and geotextiles, despite the currently critical limitations in the applicability of these techniques. This study highlighted the research gaps that may lead to the progress of the bioengineering techniques, such as beneficial traits and techniques, the exploration of mix-culture systems, and the utilisation of modelling techniques. This review serves as a structured and current overview of bioengineering knowledge for shallow slope instability and erosion management in Malaysia.

TI  - Larger water use efficiency associated with greater dependence on deep water sources in hot-dry valleys with reservoirs
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB  - Identifying the carbon-water relationship of plants helps to understand their adaptive water use strategies. The relationship between WUE and the water source remains uncertain in the hot-dry valleys with reservoirs. The leaf delta 13C and soil and xylem water isotopes (delta 2H and delta 18O) were determined to identify the WUE and water source contributions, respectively, in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit communities. We propose a source contributing score (SCS), calculated as a value for the contribution of water from different soil layers (a higher SCS value indicates plants use deeper water sources). The positive relationship between leaf delta 13C and SCS (R2 = 0.16, P = 0.022) and the negative relationship between leaf delta 13C and topsoil contribution (R2 = 0.21, P = 0.009) confirmed the close association of larger WUE with less reliance on shallow soil water. The redundancy analysis suggested a stronger connection between leaf delta 13C and d-excess than leaf delta 13C and topsoil moisture content, which emphasized the key role of soil moisture d-excess. Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) suggested soil properties and microclimate explain more than 89.8 % of the variations in tree water use. VPA also suggested different roles of microclimate and soil properties in explaining tree water use strategies. Findings broadened the understanding of the relationship between WUE and water sources and emphasized the key role of soil moisture d-excess in hot-dry valleys with reservoirs.

TI  - Woody plant community structure and composition of an urban riparian forest in Monterrey metropolitan area, Northeast Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY
AB  - This work details the structure and composition of the woody plant community of a gallery forest located in the La Silla River, between Monterrey and Guadalupe urban areas in Nuevo Le ' on, Mexico. For the analysis, the woody vegetation was categorized into upper and lower strata. The upper stratum maximum height was 38 m, and the canopy cover was 100%. The canopy consisted of 22 species from 16 families, of which seven species represented 82.3% of the importance value index (IV); Taxodium huegelii had the highest IV (34.32%). The lower stratum maximum height was 2.5 m, and the cover was 48%. Thirteen species from 10 families were identified, five of which reached 81.3% of the IV; Ricinus communis had the highest IV (23.42%). The plant community diversity was 3.8 and 2.29, based on Margalef and Shannon indices, respectively. As one finding in the present study, it can be stated that the main threat is the presence of widely distributed exotic species such as Ricinus communis and Leucaena leucocephala, with high importance values. However, the presence of a well-established tree stratum, as well as the presence of species typical of the gallery forest, suggest a good state of conservation of this gallery forest. The present results highlight the importance of studying the composition, structure, and diversity, taking into consideration the flora of floristic provinces, as an analytic strategy for the diagnosis of riparian lentic community health.

TI  - Unlocking renewable fuel: Charcoal briquettes production from agro-industrial waste with cassava industrial binders
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
AB  - Increasing global fuel demand has created challenges in sourcing raw materials, making agro-waste biomass utilization for energy production a critical alternative. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the production of charcoal briquettes using different base materials such as coconut shells (TC1), Leucaena leucocephala wood (TC2), and assorted wood charcoal residues (TC3), along with binders derived from cassava industry by-products-namely, tapioca starch (TB1), cassava peel (TB2), and cassava tubers (TB3) at binder content (BC) ratios of 5, 10, 15, and 20 by volume. Initially, assessing the physical properties, including proximate and ultimate analyses, was crucial for predicting effective charcoal production. The TC2 briquettes, using TB2 and TB3 binders at a BC20 concentration, were found to be optimal, displaying a high production capacity and low specific energy consumption. Using cassava peel and tubers as binders not only efficiently uses agricultural by-products, thereby reducing costs and avoiding competition with food resources (TC1) but also results in high-quality briquettes. In scenarios of raw material shortages, TC3 and TC2 can effectively replace TC1. Mechanically, TC3 and TC2 briquettes exhibited superior characteristics. Although BC20 enhances the mechanical properties and facilitates handling, it may compromise heat release. Thermally, a higher BC decreases the charcoal proportion, leading to increased ignition time, reduced calorific value, and heating effectiveness. In conclusion, the successful production of charcoal briquettes from agro-industrial waste using cassava industrial binders presents a viable pathway towards more sustainable energy practices, improves waste management, and adds value to agricultural waste.

TI  - Hydrodeoxygenation of Oxygenates Derived from Biomass Pyrolysis Using Titanium Dioxide-Supported Cobalt Catalysts
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - Bio-oil upgrading to produce biofuels and chemicals has become an attractive topic over the past decade. However, the design of cost- and performance-effective catalysts for commercial-scale production remains a challenge. Herein, commercial titania (TiO2) was used as the support of cobalt (Co)-based catalysts (Co/TiO2) due to its low cost, high availability, and practicability for commercialization in the future. The Co/TiO2 catalysts were made with two different forms of TiO2 (anatase [TiO2-A] and rutile [TiO2-R]) and comparatively evaluated in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 4-propylguaicol (4PG), a lignin-derived model compound. Both Co/TiO2 catalysts promoted the HDO of 4PG following a similar pathway, but the Co/TiO2-R catalyst exhibited a higher activity in the early stages of the reaction due to the formation of abundant Ti3+ species, as detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and hydrogen-temperature programed reduction (H-2-TPR) analyses. On the other hand, the Co/TiO2-A catalyst possessed a higher acidity that enhanced propylcyclohexane production at prolonged reaction times. In terms of reusability, the Co/TiO2-A catalyst showed a higher stability (less Co leaching) and reusability compared to Co/TiO2-R, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses. The HDO of the real bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala revealed that the Co/TiO2-A catalyst could convert high oxygenated aromatics (methoxyphenols, dimethoxyphenols, and benzenediols) to phenols and enhanced the phenols content, hinting at its potential to produce green chemicals from bio-feedstock.

TI  - Host Plant Regulates Growth Processes, Ion Homeostasis, and Salinity Tolerance of Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i> L.)
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION
AB  - Salinity is one of the most detrimental abiotic stresses to the productivity of crops. Saline lands can be easily transformed into commercial forest plantations by growing high value tree species. Therefore, present investigation was undertaken to assess the effect of saline irrigation (ECiw similar to 9), including control, and ten different host species (Melia dubia, Dalbergia sissoo, Azadirachta indica, Casuarina equisetifolia, Acacia ampliceps, Citrus aurantium, Punica granatum, Syzygium cumini, Phyllanthus emblica, and Leucaena leucocephala) on growth, physiological processes and salinity tolerance of sandalwood (Santalum album L.). Results revealed that hosts D. sissoo, A. indica, and M. dubia maintained high (p < 0.05) K+ /Na+ ratio and resulted in higher growth of sandalwood under salinity stress. The plant growth traits of sandalwood showed variable trends of decline with different hosts under the same conditions. The biomass of sandalwood decreased by 41-75% under salinity stress; resulting in the substantial differences for salinity tolerance varying from 25 to 59.8%. Sandalwood grown with D. sissoo produced maximum (p < 0.05) biomass under salinity stress as well as depicted higher salinity tolerance. The growth parameters (collar diameter, height, and biomass) of sandalwood exhibited a highly negative (p < 0.05) correlation with Na+ ion under salinity stress. Hosts M. dubia, D. sissoo, and A. indica showed only a slight decline in growth and biomass of sandalwood under salinity stress. Results suggested that sandalwood growth is modulated mainly by host species under both control and salinity stress, and thus have immense potential for cultivation with suitable host in the degraded saline soils.

TI  - Soil Conditioning and Neighbor Identity Influence on <i>Cycas</i> Seedling Performance
T2  - ECOLOGIES
AB  - Translocation of endangered plant species and facilitating in situ regeneration require knowledge of the factors that define suitable habitat characteristics. Four approaches were employed to define how antecedent and contemporary plant identity influenced Cycas seedling growth and survival in Guam, Yap, and the Philippines. Cycas micronesica K.D. Hill or Cycas nitida K.D. Hill & A. Lindstr. seedlings growing beneath the canopy of the maternal parent tree reached 100% mortality in 4 to 8 year. Cycas micronesica seedlings planted beneath a conspecific male adult tree reached 68% mortality in two years while seedlings planted away from a conspecific individual exhibited 100% survival. Cycas micronesica seedlings planted beneath monostands of invasive Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit or Vitex parviflora Juss. reached 40% mortality in two years while seedlings planted in adjacent native forest cover exhibited 100% survival. Cycas micronesica seedlings planted in soil conditioned for 9 months by conspecifics, heterospecific native species, Carica papaya L., L. leucocephala, or V. parviflora exhibited the greatest growth in the soils conditioned by heterospecific natives and the least growth in the soils conditioned by the three invasive species. The seedlings growing in soil conditioned by conspecifics exhibited the most coralloid roots and the greatest shoot:root ratio. These studies confirmed that the identity of antecedent and competitive plants strongly influenced the longevity and growth of Cycas seedlings. Conservationists may improve outcomes by avoiding degraded forests that have experienced invasive plant species when positioning translocation projects. Planting Cycas seedlings in biodiverse native forest but away from a conspecific individual may lead to the greatest success in population recovery.

TI  - Successful creation of seedless (sterile) leucaena germplasm developed from interspecific hybridisation for use as forage
T2  - CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE
AB  - Context. The legume shrub/tree leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.) is highly regarded as a cattle fodder, although it is considered an environmental weed in many parts of Australia. Aims. We investigated the feasibility of developing a forage variety of triploid leucaena through interspecific hybridisation that is sterile (without seeds) as a strategy to mitigate its weed risk. Methods. A conventional breeding strategy was used to create triploid hybrids from hand crosses between tetraploid and diploid species of leucaena. Molecular markers were developed to confirm successful crosses and flow cytometry was used to confirm the ploidy level. The plants are being evaluated for flowering behaviour, seed and herbage production across two environmentally diverse sites at Carnarvon and Kununurra in northern Western Australia. Key results. During 2018/19 and 2019/20, 2260 crosses between 45 different combinations of diploid females by tetraploid males and their reciprocals have created over 3000 putative triploid hybrid plants. This is the first time that triploids have successfully been created in Australia and 10 new parental combinations were created as a world -first. Conclusions. A cohort of sterile triploid plants has been identified and selections will be made based on their edible biomass productivity, insect tolerance, capacity for regrowth after cutting, nutritive value and plant chemistry (including anti-methanogenic responses). A sterile leucaena variety will have application not only in Australian grazing systems but also in other tropical regions of the world. Implications. A cost-effective technology for mass vegetative propagation of leucaena will be required for commercialisation of a sterile variety.

TI  - Development of Meso- and Macro-Pore Carbonization Technology from Biochar in Treating the Stumps of Representative Trees in Taiwan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study uses the tree stumps of the three representative trees in Taiwan (Leucaena leucocephala, Syzygium samarangense, and Ziziphus jujuba) as the material source and recyclable oyster shell powder as an activator. A carbonization process for upgrading and recycling the tree stumps was developed with our homemade, digital-controlled, energy-saving carbonization system. First, the tree stumps are carbonized at a medium temperature of 500 degrees C and then heated to 900 degrees C for high-temperature carbonization, followed by the activation procedure as required. With our method, we can produce biochar with a high proportion of fixed carbon and a high proportion of meso- and macropores while maximizing the yield of wood vinegar. The specific surface area of the meso- and macropores can reach up to 70 m(2)/g or more. The effect of different activation materials on the pore characteristics and specific surface area of biochar was carefully examined. It was found that both KOH and oyster shell powder is the ideal activator for producing biochar with a high proportion of meso- and macropores. The FTIR spectrum, CEC, and contents of the ordinary elements and heavy metals of the biochar were also reported. It is clear from the FTIR data that the absorption peaks of the overall spectrum of the three types of biochar after carbonization at high temperature are cleaner than those of biochar carbonized at low temperature. This research can promote the recycling of agricultural residues, enhance soil carbon sequestration, preserve fertilizers, and suppress diseases and pests, moving towards approaching the goal of net-zero carbon emissions.

TI  - Effects of Urea-Molasses, Maize Bran, and Ipil-ipil Leaf Meal on the Quality of Cogon Grass Silage at Different Harvesting Intervals
T2  - MINDANAO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The study examines how varying harvesting intervals and processing methods affect the physicochemical and nutritional properties of Cogon grass (Imperata cylindrica Linn) silage. Its goal is to determine optimal practices for improving silage quality and nutritional value to support sustainable livestock feeding in tropical regions. A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used, with four treatments based on harvesting intervals (20, 25, 30, and 35 days) and three replications per treatment. Cogon grass silages were enhanced with 2.1% urea molasses, 5.12% maize bran, and 8.9% Ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf meal to improve fermentation and nutrition. The 20-day interval (T1) had the highest dry matter (DM, 39.1%) and crude protein (CP, 9.25%), while the 35-day interval (T4) had the lowest (30.2% DM, 5.66% CP). Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was highest in T1 (78.0%) and lowest in T3 (76.8%). Gross energy ranged from 4606 to 4832 cal/g, with no significant differences. Silage pH decreased with longer harvest intervals, with T4 recording the lowest pH (4.64), indicating better fermentation. Total soluble solids (TSS) were highest in T1 (0.80 degrees Brix) and lowest in T4 (0.12 degrees Brix). Sensory evaluations showed silages harvested at 20 and 25 days (T1 and T2) were most acceptable in color, odor, and moisture. Harvesting Cogon grass at 20-25 days and supplementing with urea molasses, maize bran, and Ipil-ipil leaf meal produced high-quality silage with enhanced nutrition and fermentation, offering a sustainable feeding strategy for tropical livestock.

TI  - PHYTOCHEMICAL PROFILE AND ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF PLANT EXTRACTS AGAINST PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS OF IMPORTANCE TO THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY
T2  - AGROCIENCIA
AB  - Infections caused by pathogenic bacteria are a recurrent problem in the livestock sector, generating important economic losses in the livestock industry. One of the main strategies includes antibiotic therapy; however, its use is limited since pathogenic bacteria present resistance to these drugs, which makes treatment against microbial infections difficult. Therefore, the hypothesis proposed was that ethanolic extracts of native plants from the state of Sonora, Mexico, can inhibit the growth of Gram (+) and Gram (-) pathogenic bacteria related to common infections in the livestock industry. The objective was to evaluate the phytochemical and antimicrobial profile of native plants from the state of Sonora, Mexico. In this study, 17 ethanolic extracts were obtained from native plants of Sonora, and the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the agar diffusion method and by the microdilution technique using reference bacteria from the ATCC collection. The phytochemical profile was evaluated by spectrophotometry and the experimental design used was completely randomized with three replicates per treatment at 95 % confidence. The results showed that extracts of Prosopis velutina, Ibervillea sonorae, Populus alba, Ambrosia ambrosioides, Krameria sonorae, and Leucaena leucocephala were effective in eliminating Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (p <= 0.05). In addition, these extracts presented the highest concentration of total polysaccharides, flavones and flavonols, flavanones and dihydroflavonols, tannins and total chlorogenic acid (p <= 0.05). Therefore, plant extracts from Sonora, Mexico, represent a natural alternative for the control of Gram (+) and Gram (-) pathogens of importance to the livestock industry.

TI  - Rice performance as influenced by crop establishment methods, green organic mulches and rates of nitrogen fertilization along with liquid <i>Azotobacter chroococcum</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - The effect of green organic mulches (Sesbania aculeata and Leucaena leucocephala) and nitrogen (N) levels on growth, yield, quality and nutrient uptake of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar "Pusa Basmati 1509" was investigated in aerobic rice (AR) and transplanted rice (TPR). The levels of N were control (N-0), 75% recommended dose of N (RDN); and 100% RDN) applied through Chemical fertilizer and Azotobacter chroococcum a liquid biofertilizer. A Field experiment was conducted in split plot design with four main-plot and 5 sub-plot treatments. The main plot consisted of bare soil, Sesbania mulch (10 Mg ha(-1), fresh weight-FW), Leucaena mulch (10 Mg ha(-1) FW), and TPR; and sub-plot consisted N-0; 75% RDN, 100% RDN; 75% RDN+Azotobacter, and 100% RDN+Azotobacter. The highest grain, straw and biological yields (3.84, 6.74 and 11.6 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and nutrient uptake were recorded with TPR followed by AR with Leucaena and Sesbania mulch. Grain, straw and biological yield of TPR over bare soil were increased by 31.9, 26.6 and 28.3%, respectively. Uptake of Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu by rice under TPR were 52, 33, 36 and 33% higher, respectively than AR under bare soil. The highest grain, straw, and biological yields (3.86, 7.79 and 11.7 Mg ha(-1), respectively) of AR were obtained in 100% RDN + Azotobacter compared to the rest of the treatments. Therefore, the cultivation of AR with Leucaena/Sesbania mulch along with 100% RDN and Azotobacter biofertilizer can be most productive in the study area.

TI  - Mulching on family maize farms in the tropics: A systematic review
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Family farms, predominantly reliant on family labour, produce approximately three-quarters of the World's food. Maize (Zea mays) is the world's most produced cereal. Yet in much of the tropics, actual maize yields are far below those attainable with best-bet practices. While any advantage of adding mulch might depend on soil fertility level, mulch quality, amount of rainfall, irrigation, and other factors, no ranking of their importance has been found. Our objectives were to disentangle these influences to assess how mulch affects yields on different fertility soils under different precipitation regimes. We conducted a systematic review in Web of Science, obtaining 50 papers on experiments from the tropics. Fewer trials have been conducted in Asia and Pacific (n = 10) than in Africa (n = 20) or Latin America and the Caribbean (n = 20). Twenty mulches had been tested of which Leucaena leucocephala had been used in 25% of trials. Mulch was more commonly applied after (n = 15) than before (n = 18) sowing or at sowing (n = 14); three trials did not mention application timing. Mulch increased grain yield and biomass. The positive effect of mulch was greater when combined with mineral fer-tilizer, implying a synergistic rather than a substitutional effect and demonstrating its applicability, even for farmers able to afford inputs. Mulch increased both maize grain yield and total biomass so is recommended as a sustainable practice in general, but particularly on low fertility soils in lower rainfall areas. Future work should model mass loss and nutrient release of different mulch types under different agroecological conditions.

TI  - The effects of pH, salinity, age of leaves, post-harvest storage duration, and psyllid infestation on nutritional qualities of giant leucaena fodder
T2  - JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Giant leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata) can be managed as a profusely branched bushy plant by repeated harvest of its foliage for use as fodder. The objective of this research was to determine the effects of soil pH and salinity, age of the leaves, post-harvest storage duration, and psyllid infection on the nutritional qualities of leucaena fodder. To determine the effects of soil pH and salinity on fodder quality, giant leucaena K636 plants were grown in large pots containing soils adjusted to different pH and salinity levels. The effects of age of the leaves, post-harvest storage duration and psyllid infection on fodder quality were studied using leucaena samples collected from Waimanalo Research Station. Among five pH levels tested, pH 6.0 was found to produce the highest amounts of protein and structural fibers in the foliage. Mimosine contents were highest at pH 6 and 7 and lowest at pH 5.0. The growth of giant leucaena was retarded and the nutritional quality were adversely affected under salinity conditions. Compared to young leaves, old leaves contained 18.5% less protein, 95% less mimosine, 30% less tannin and 40% more structural fibers. Post-harvest storage duration up to 72 h, at room temperature did not seem to affect protein, tannin and structural fiber contents of the foliage; however, mimosine content was reduced by 25%. These results will help to identify ideal soil pH, age of foliage, and post-harvest storage duration for obtaining high forage yield and nutritional quality for giant leucaena.

TI  - Dynamics of carbon storage in forage systems in a livestock farm in Concepci'on, Paraguay
T2  - REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE AGRONOMIA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD DEL ZULIA
AB  - Although the capacity of plants to store carbon is known, obtaining information about the sequestration potential in the soil and in herbaceous, shrubby and tree biomass in land use systems is essential, even more so in landscapes dominated by livestock. The objective was to study the dynamics of carbon storage in three different forage systems in a livestock farm in Concepcion, Paraguay. For this, the carbon level was estimated at different soil depths (0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) and in the herbaceous/shrub biomass in three systems (Brachiaria brizantha cv Marandu, Panicum maximum cv Colonial and Leucaena leucocephala consortium with colonial), with an interval of 30 days between the three measurement moments. The results generated from the biomass indicated that the system constituted by the colonial forage consortium with L. leucocephala, presented the highest level of carbon (3.73 t.ha(-1)), showing a significant difference in relation to the B. brizantha (2.12 t.ha(-1); p<0.05). On the other hand, the initial period showed higher carbon concentration (4.55 t.ha(-1); p<0.05). Likewise, a higher content was found at a depth of 0-20 cm (20.26 t.ha(-1); p<0.05). These results were obtained in a winter process. In this regard, it is important to mention that forage shrubs in systems with pastures constitute a fundamental nutritional resource in winter, in this sense it is recommended to use improved and consortium pasture systems, to increase carbon storage, achieve stable and productive systems, in correspondence with its potentialities.

TI  - Chemical indicators of soil health in silvopastoral systems, restoration forest, and maize cultivation in a tropical dry forest
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES
AB  - Annual crops and pastures in monoculture frequently have negative effects on ecosystem services due to soil and biodiversity losses. Silvopastoral systems (SSP) have been proposed as an alternative for livestock production systems; however, there are few studies that demonstrate their benefits on soil health. For that reason, this study was established to evaluate the effect of different land uses on soil health measured through chemical indicators. For this purpose, the following land uses managed for at least 19 years were evaluated: (i) intensive maize (Zea mays) production, (ii) a guinea (Megathyrsus maximus) and angleton (Dichantium aristatum) mixed pasture, (iii) SSP with grasses and shrubs of totumo (Cresentia cujete) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), (iv) a multistrata SSP with the same grasses and shrubs plus tree fodder species: (Cassia grandis, Albizia saman and Guazuma ulmifolia); and (v) a secondary forest used as a reference. The evaluations were made in contrasting seasons (dry and rainy), in soils of the Middle Sinu river valley (Colombia), with a drainage gradient. In general, the soils of the SPS presented the highest values for MOS, total N, Mg, B, N-NO3 and CICE, the grass alone pasture presented the highest values in micronutrients: Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn and S and NH4, and lower values for pH, P and NO3, and the highest for Al; whereas, intermediate values for all chemical indicators were obtained in the secondary forest. In contrast, soils cultivated with corn presented the poorest chemical indicators. It is concluded that SSP improve the chemical indicators of soil health as compared to the grass alone pasture and corn monoculture.

TI  - Plants extracts as germination and seedling establishment promoters in lettuce and maize
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
AB  - Substances produced by plants have huge importance regulating multiple functions as germination, development promoter/ enhancer, yield increaser and activator of plant defense system against diseases and pests. Due to diversity, each plant species produces different compounds and in different concentrations. This research evaluated the role of 20 plants extracts obtained from different plant species or plant tissues on seed germination and seedlings establishment of maize and lettuce, in concentration of 5%, 10% or 20%. For this, two experiments were carried out, the first analyzing 20 plant extracts and the effects on germination percentage and root and shoot length based on the germination test for the two species. The second was carried out in a greenhouse, in a completely randomized design with three and ten repetitions for maize and lettuce, respectively, using only the three extracts with the best results from the first experiment. Seedling height and seedling dry matter were evaluated. To germination test most of extracts showed negative or no effects in both species. Only Conyza bonariensis at 5% and Richardia brasiliensis at 5% and 20% had positive effects on early seedling growth, increasing the seedlings length for maize seedlings. To seedlings establishment, Conyza bonariensis, Leucaena leucocephala and Richardia brasiliensis extracts did not show statistical difference to shoots height but increased the dry mass of shoots and roots. The results demonstrated that these plants extract have potential as growth promoters and can be a good option to a better seedling growth and establishment, collaborating to a more effective agriculture.

TI  - Evaluation of the productivity and feed value of Wondergraze and Redlands leucaena cultivars under grazing
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB  - Context. Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a leguminous shrub used for beef grazing in low-rainfall regions (< 600-700 mm). Newer cultivars have the potential to extend adoption of the species to higher rainfall (> 600-700 mm), frost-free areas of Australia. Aim. We compared productivity, nutritional value and animal performance of two leucaena cultivars, new psyllid-resistant Redlands and the 2010-released Wondergraze, under continuous grazing management in a higher rainfall environment. Methods. Growing steers were allocated to replicated established stands of Wondergraze or Redlands with inter-row mixed grass-legume pasture from January to July 2021. Pasture and leucaena were characterised for biomass and nutritive characteristics. Botanical composition was measured. Liveweight gain, rumen fermentation, and leucaena mimosine breakdown products were measured in grazing steers. Key results. At the beginning of the study, leucaena edible biomass was similar for both cultivars (P > 0.05), but at subsequent samplings, biomass of Redlands was lower than of Wondergraze (P < 0.01). Biomass of both cultivars declined rapidly over the grazing period. Pasture biomass increased between February and July and was significantly higher in Wondergraze paddocks (P < 0.05). Animal performance was not significantly different between cultivar treatments, averaging 0.8 kg/day, but declined over time. Patterns of mimosine conversion to DHP isomers and their conjugation were similar for the two cultivars, suggesting that effectiveness of detoxification did not differ between them. Conclusion. The results demonstrate that leucaena can sustain high levels of animal performance when included in tropical grass pastures in a higher rainfall environment if present in a sufficient quantity (> 2 t leucaena edible dry matter/ha established leucaena).

TI  - Decomposition and Nitrogen Release Rates of Foliar Litter from Single and Mixed Agroforestry Species under Field Conditions
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Decomposition and N release pattern from the leaves of three shrubs species were studied under field conditions. Leaves of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.), Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) and Moringa oleifera (Lam.) and two mixtures, Leucaena + Moringa and Leucaena + Guazuma, in a complete randomized block design, were studied during the dry and wet seasons. Litterbags were randomly distributed in each experimental block and placed on the soil surface, and residues were recovered after 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks. Double exponential model decay was better fitted to describe the pattern of the decay of the release of various leaf constituents. Litter dry weight loss and N release were faster from Moringa, followed by the Leucaena + Moringa mixture, while the Guazuma leaf litter decomposed much slower. In the wet period, a rapid N release was observed for Moringa (60%) and Leucaena + Moringa (43%) in the first two weeks. In contrast, Guazuma and the Leucaena + Guazuma mixture released about 46% of N in 16 weeks. In the dry period, leaves released most of their N during the first 8 to 16 weeks. Moringa and Leucaena + Moringa ranked first, having lost 81 and 75% of its initial N, respectively. The ratios of condensed tannin and polyphenols to N were significantly correlated with the N released. It was concluded that the initial mass loss from the leaf litter was high and rapid in the rainy period in comparison to the dry period. The residue disappearance pattern of Moringa, Leucaena and Leucaena + Moringa followed an asymptotic model, with more than 80% of the original residue released during the 16-week study period.

TI  - Mine soil properties as influenced by tree species and topography of the re-vegetated coal mine overburden dump
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Re-vegetation or natural succession of plant species is an important factor of soil development in postmining overburden dumps. As the parent material (sedimentary rocks and regolith) is more or less uniform in the dump, the topographic position and vegetation are the major factors that affects the mine soil quality. Accordingly, this study was designed for a relative evaluation of the influence of dump topographical position (crest, backslope, toeslope) and tree species (Azadirachta indica, Cassia siamea, and Leucaena leucocephala) on soil quality. Trees growing on the toeslope of the dump were significantly taller with larger diameter at breast height than those at backslope or crest. Soil moisture, pH, total S, available P, and Fe content were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by topographical position of the dump. All these properties were higher in the toeslope, except S in the crest. Tree species affected all the soil properties, except electrical conductivity and Mn. Organic carbon content was significantly lower for the nitrogen fixer L. leucocephala (2.03 %) than A. indica (3.30 %) or C. siamea (3.39 %). Soil dehydrogenase activity (39.79 mg TPF/24hr/kg) and microbial biomass carbon (286 mu g/g) was higher under L. leucocephala, and C. siamea, respectively. Based on redundancy analysis (RDA), 87.5 % of the data variation is explained by the tree species, whereas, only 12.5 % by the topography. Principal component analysis revealed that C. siamea contributes significantly for the variation in soil properties of the dump. Re-vegetated plant species are a dominant factor of soil development in post mining dump than the topographical position. C siamea and the toeslope are closely associated with soil microbial biomass carbon. It is recommended to plant C. siamea with relatively higher planting density in crest and backslope than toeslope of the dump.

TI  - Enhancing Nutrient Intake, Digestibility, Rumen Fermentation, and Blood Metabolites in Kacang Goats Using Compost-Enriched Hydroponic Maize Fodder
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - This study aimed to enhance nutrient intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation, and blood metabolites in Kacang goats by substituting grass silage with hydroponic maize fodder enriched with fermented compost tea. The compost tea, prepared by fermenting organic compost with sugared water + 40 mL EM4 for 3 days, was used to grow maize fodder hydroponically. Four male Kacang goats (13.05 +/- 1.32 kg) were assigned to four dietary treatments in a 4x4 latin square design over four 15-day periods (10 days for adaption, 5 days for data collection). The treatments were: 60% grass silage + 10% Leucaena leucocephala + 30% concentrate (control, FCG0); 30% grass silage + 30% hydroponic maize fodder + 10% L. leucocephala + 30% concentrate (FCG1); 15% grass silage + 45% hydroponic maize fodder + 10% L. leucocephala + 30% concentrate (FCG2); and 60% hydroponic maize fodder + 10% L. leucocephala + 30% concentrate (FCG3). Goats on FCG3 had lower (p<0.05) dry matter intake (152.48 g/day) compared to FCG0 (226.83 g/day). Nutrient digestibility, including organic matter and crude fiber, improved (p<0.05) in FCG3 (77.21% and 66.12%) compared to FCG0 (76.62% and 52.27%). Total volatile fatty acids (VFA) increased in FCG3 (131.54 mM) compared to FCG0 (111.73 mM). However, no significant differences were observed in ruminal ammonia (NH3-N), ruminal pH, or blood metabolites. In conclusion, substituting grass silage with hydroponic maize fodder enriched with fermented compost tea up to 75% of the diet improved digestibility and rumen fermentation without negatively affecting intake, digestibility, or blood metabolites in Kacang goats, suggesting its potential as an alternative feed. However, complete substitution (100%) reduced intake, indicating challenges at higher substitution levels.

TI  - <i>Leucaena</i> interspecific fi c hybrid ' KX4-Hawaii' ' as a source of agricultural biomass in a water-scarce small island developing state
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background: Leucaena leucocephala is a useful multipurpose tree species for agroforestry systems, but traditional seeded cultivars often become weedy and invasive. A seedless hybrid cultivar, ' KX4-Hawaii ' , offers a potential solution to this problem. However, relevant agronomic information and information on the performance of ' KX4-Hawaii ' under varying growth conditions is required. The goal of this research was to evaluate ' KX4-Hawaii ' as a source of agricultural biomass in Barbados, a small island developing state with limited arable land. Methods: ' KX4-Hawaii ' air layers were imported into Barbados to create stock trees. Air layering was used to create propagation material and a fi eld study was established with a ' KX4-Hawaii ' hedgerow planted as a fi eld border. Three plant spacings (50, 75, and 100 cm) were evaluated and data on the growth and biomass yields of the trees were collected at 4-month intervals. Precipitation data were used to investigate climatic effects on ' KX4-Hawaii ' productivity. Results: ' KX4-Hawaii ' was successfully propagated via air layers and could be planted directly in the fi eld with irrigation. All recorded growth and biomass yields were correlated with precipitation. However, the woody (lignified fi ed stems and branches) biomass was more responsive to precipitation than the green (leaves and green tender stems) biomass and made up a large fraction of the total biomass produced. ' KX4-Hawaii ' was productive even under drought conditions and biomass yields per meter of hedgerow increased with closer spacings. Of the tested spacing treatments, 75 cm was optimum for a 4-month pruning interval under the conditions seen in Barbados as it produced similar yields to the 50 cm spacing treatment but would require less propagation material.

TI  - Nutritional and toxicological aspects of selected wild edible plants and significance for this society
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Consumption of wild edible plants has played a significant role in supplying food and nutritional requirements and increasing the health status of underprivileged communities in many rural parts of the world. The present investigation was to evaluate the nutritive value, mineral content, vitamin content, and toxicological status of ten wild edible plants viz. Phlogocanthus thrysiflorus, Lasia spinosa, Eriosema chinense, Polygonum microcephalum, Nasturtium indicum, Spinacia oleracea, Malva parviflora, Leucaena leucocephala, Elsholtzia blanda, and Sonchus oleraceus, consumed by the tribal people of Meghalaya State in India, as their nourishment. All investigated plants were collected from different areas of Meghalaya state, and their nutraceutical potential was evaluated following the standard food analysis methods described in the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. Protein contents were very high in several species, especially in N. indicum (24.75%). Carbohydrate content ranged from 5.86% (S. oleracea) to 21.28% (E. chinense). All plants contained significant amounts of minerals (Na, K, Ca, Fe, Zn, Mg), and water soluble vitamins such as vitamin C (0.24-5.79 mg/ 100 g of dry plant material), B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B9. Antinutrients such as oxalate, phytate, saponin and heavy metal (Pb, Cr, Cd, Hg) levels in all plants were estimated below fatal levels. The consequences of haemolytic toxicity, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of water extracts of wild edible plants ensure safety for human consumption. Therefore, this study focuses on the utilization of wild edible plants as a source of dietary supplements, which may result in the commercialization of the produce; hence, it assesses consumer perceptions towards wild edible plants in India.& COPY; 2023 SAAB.

TI  - Host-parasite interaction: an insight into the growth and physiological responses of sandalwood and associated host species
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Introduction Sandalwood (Santalum album L.) is categorized as vulnerable in the IUCN Red list and is also an industrially important tree species valued for its heartwood and aromatic oil. Sandalwood is a semi-root parasite tree that relies on its host plants for its water and nutrient requirements. Therefore, there is need to understand the growth and physiological interactions between sandalwood and its hosts.Methods Sandalwood were planted with ten different host species viz., Syzygium cumini, Punica granatum, Phyllanthus emblica, Melia dubia, Leucaena leucocephala, Dalbergia sissoo, Casuarina equisetifolia, Citrus aurantium, Azadirachta indica and Acacia ampliceps to assess the interactive effect on the change in growth and physiology of both sandalwood and host tree species.Results The findings revealed that sandalwood grown with hosts D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia showed higher growth performance, while among hosts, S. cumini, followed by C. aurantium and L. leucocephala, showed better growth and physiobiochemical traits. The stepwise regression analysis and trait modeling indicated that the six traits, namely, plant height, photosynthetic rate, relative water content, water potential, intercellular CO2 concentration, and total soluble protein, contributed greater growth in the sandalwood, while four traits, namely, water potential, osmotic potential, leaf area, and total soluble protein, contributed greater growth in the host species. The traits modeling study predicted greater growth of sandalwood with the hosts D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia, whereas among host species, prediction revealed greater growth of S. cumini and C. aurantium.Discussion The study concluded that host-parasite interaction modulated the growth and physiological processes in both sandalwood and hosts and sandalwood plantations can be successfully developed with the hosts D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia.

AB  - The Caesalpinioideae subfamily contains many well-known trees that are important for economic sustain- ability and human health, but a lack of genomic resources has hindered their breeding and utilization. Here, we present chromosome-level reference genomes for the two food and industrial trees Gleditsia sinensis (921 Mb) and Biancaea sappan (872 Mb), the three shade and ornamental trees Albizia julibrissin (705 Mb), Delonix regia (580 Mb), and Acacia confusa (566 Mb), and the two pioneer and hedgerow trees Leucaena leucocephala (1338 Mb) and Mimosa bimucronata (641 Mb). Phylogenetic inference shows that the mimosoid clade has a much higher evolutionary rate than the other clades of Caesalpinioideae. Macrosynteny comparison suggests that the fusion and breakage of an unstable chromosome are responsible for the difference in basic chromosome number (13 or 14) for Caesalpinioideae. After an ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) shared by all Caesalpinioideae species (CWGD, similar to 72.0 million years ago [MYA]), there were two recent successive WGD events, LWGD-1 (16.2-19.5 MYA) and LWGD-2 (7.1-9.5 MYA), in L. leucocephala. Thereafter, '40% gene loss and genome-size contraction have occurred during the diploidization process in L. leucocephala. To investigate secondary metabolites, we identified all gene copies involved in mimosine metabolism in these species and found that the abundance of mimosine biosynthesis genes in L. leucocephala largely explains its high mimosine production. We also identified the set of all potential genes involved in triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis in G. sinensis, which is more complete than that based on previous transcriptome-derived unigenes. Our results and genomic resources will facilitate biological studies of Caesalpinioideae and promote the utilization of valuable secondary metabolites.

TI  - The Restoration of Degraded Landscapes along the Urban-Rural Gradient of Lubumbashi City (Democratic Republic of the Congo) by <i>Acacia auriculiformis</i> Plantations: Their Spatial Dynamics and Impact on Plant Diversity
T2  - ECOLOGIES
AB  - This study examines the spatio-temporal dynamics of Acacia auriculiformis in Lubumbashi city, southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the context of rapid urbanization following the liberalization of the mining sector. The city has experienced significant demographic growth and unplanned spatial expansion, resulting in a decrease in vegetation cover. The introduction and proliferation of A. auriculiformis, an exotic tree species, have occurred without strategic planning or monitoring. Utilizing digitized remote sensing imagery from 2006, 2014, and 2021, we quantified the expansion of A. auriculiformis along the urban-rural gradient. Additionally, a floristic inventory conducted in 2021 provided insights into tree diversity within A. auriculiformis plantations. Our findings indicate a substantial increase in the number and area of A. auriculiformis patches, predominantly in urban zones. However, the patch values, highest in 2006, were shown to decline by 2021, especially in urban areas. The floristic inventory identified 39 tree species within A. auriculiformis plantations, including predominant species such as Albizia lebbeck, Albizia alba, and Leucaena leucocephala. Notably, 20 of these species are exotic, with half being invasive. In contrast, the 19 indigenous species were primarily found in peri-urban areas. While a greater number of tree species were observed in urban zones, larger average diameters were recorded in peri-urban zones. The persistence and expansion of A. auriculiformis in a landscape characterized by declining tree cover suggest its potential sustainability in this setting. However, A. auriculiformis plantations have facilitated the establishment of predominantly exotic and potentially invasive species. These findings highlight the need for the strategic management of A. auriculiformis and associated exotic flora to mitigate their spread and to consider their role in the restoration of degraded lands.

TI  - Use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the nutrition of <i>Leucacephala</i> <i>leucocephala</i> (Lam.) De wit for forage production
T2  - TEMAS AGRARIOS
AB  - At present, the use of biofertilizers and protein plants in the nutrition of pastures and forage has increased. The investigation was carried out in the University Center of the municipality of Cumanayagua, county of Cienfuegos, Cuba with the objective of evaluating the response of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit to the inoculation of different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) strains. The experiment was carried out in polyethylene bags. The experiment used a random blocks design with three replicates and the following treatments: #1. Soil (Control treatment, without inoculation and NPK application), #2. Soil + inoculation with the AMF strain F. mosseae/INCAM-2, #3. Soil + inoculation with the AMF strain G. cubense/INCAM-4) and #4. Soil + NPK fertilization at plant establishment application of NPK (25, 40 y 120 kg ha(-1) de N, P2O5 y K(2)0) + N at each cut at 70% of the initial dose. The inoculation with AMF was simultaneous for all treatments. A establishment cut and five successive cuts were performed, with 51.33 average days between them. The biomass production, the content of gross protein of L. leucocephala in each harvest and the cumulative total, as well as mycorrhizal effectiveness, were quantified. L. leucocephala positively responded to F. mosseae/INCAM-2 inoculation. Biomass production for cut increased between 31,50 % (Treatment #2) y 19,40 % (Treatment #3) with respect to control treatment. Inoculation with F. mosseae/INCAM-2 showed higher mycorrhizal effectiveness. The highest value in gross protein was obtained in the variant with mineral fertilization and the inoculated variants overcame the control treatment, with better performance than treatment # 2 ( Soil+ Funneliformis mosseae/INCAM-2).

TI  - PHYTOCHEMICAL PROFILE AND ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF PLANT EXTRACTS AGAINST PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS OF IMPORTANCE TO THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY
T2  - AGROCIENCIA
AB  - Infections caused by pathogenic bacteria are a recurring problem in the livestock sector, leading to significant economic losses in the livestock industry. One of the main strategies includes antibiotic therapy, however, its use is limited due to the fact that pathogenic bacteria present resistance to these drugs, which makes treatment against microbial infections difficult. Therefore, the proposed hypothesis was that the ethanolic extracts of native plants from the state of Sonora, Mexico, are capable of inhibiting the growth of Gram (+) and Gram (-) pathogenic bacteria related to common infections in the livestock industry. The objective was to evaluate the phytochemical and antimicrobial profile of native plants from the state of Sonora, Mexico. In this study, 17 ethanolic extracts of native plants from Sonora were obtained, and the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the agar diffusion method and by the microdilution technique using reference bacteria from the ATCC collection. The phytochemical profile was evaluated by spectrophotometry and the experimental design used was a completely randomized design with 3 repetitions per treatment at 95% reliability. The results showed that the extracts of Prosopis velutina, Ibervillea sonorae, Populus alba, Ambrosia ambrosioides, Krameria sonorae, and Leucaena leucocephala were effective in killing Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Salmonella enterica serovar. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (p <= 0.05). In addition, these extracts presented the highest concentration of total polysaccharides, flavones and flavonols, flavanones and dihydroflavonols, tannins and total chlorogenic acid (p <= 0.05). Therefore, the extracts of the plants of Sonora, Mexico, represent a natural alternative for the control of Gram (+) and Gram (-) pathogens of importance for the livestock industry.

TI  - Resiliencies of soil phosphorus fractions after natural summer fire are governed by microbial activity and cation availability in a semi-arid Inceptisol
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - The unintended impact of natural summer fire on soil is complicated and rather less studied than its above-ground impact. Recognising the impact of a fire on silvopastoral soils and their resilience can aid in improving the management of silvopastoral systems. We studied the immediate (after 1 week (W)) and short-term (after 3 months (M)) recovery of different soil biological and chemical properties after the natural fire, with specific emphasis on phosphorus (P) dynamics. Soil samples were collected from four different layers (0-15, 15-30, 30-45, and 45-60 cm) of Morus alba, Leucaena leucocephala, and Ficus infectoria based silvopastoral systems. In the 0-15 cm soil layer, soil organic carbon (SOC) declined by-37, 42, and 30% after the fire in Morus-, Leucaena-, and Ficus -based systems, respectively within 1W of fire. However, after 3M of fire, Morus and Leucaena regained-6 and 11.5% SOC as compared to their status after 1W in the 0-15 cm soil layer. After 1W of the fire, soil nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and potassium availability declined significantly at 0-15 cm soil layer in all systems. Iron and manganese availability improved significantly after 1W of the fire. Saloid bound P and aluminium bound P declined significantly immediately after the fire, increasing availability in all systems. However, calcium bound P did not change significantly after the fire. Dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activity declined significantly after the fire, however, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activity were unaltered. Resiliencies of these soil properties were significantly impacted by soil depth and time. Path analysis indicated microbial activity and cationic micronutrients majorly governed the resilience of soil P fractions and P avail-ability. Pasture yield was not significantly improved after the fire, so natural summer fire must be prevented to avoid loss of SOC, N, and S.

TI  - The naturalized vascular flora of Malesia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - Major regional gaps exist in the reporting and accessibility of naturalized plant species distribution data, especially within Southeast Asia. Here, we present the Malesian Naturalized Alien Flora database (MalNAF), the first standardized island-group level checklist of naturalized vascular plant species for the Malesian phytogeographical region. We used MalNAF to investigate the composition, origins, and habitat preferences of the naturalized flora. The naturalized vascular flora of Malesia consists of at least 1177 species. Richness is highest in the Philippines (539 spp.) and lowest in the Maluku Islands (87 spp.). But, the Lesser Sunda Islands had the highest naturalized species richness relative to native richness and Singapore has a higher naturalized plant species richness than would be expected given its size. When comparing the data for Malesia with a global dataset, we found that naturalized richness increased with area for islands but not for continental regions. Across the archipelago, 31 species are widespread, occurring in every island group, but the majority have a limited distribution of 2.4 +/- 2.3 (mean +/- SD) island groups per naturalized species. The naturalized plant species are representatives of 150 families, twenty of which are newly introduced to the region. Families richest in naturalized plant species in Malesia were Fabaceae (= Leguminosae) (160 spp.), Poaceae (= Gramineae) (138 spp.), and Asteraceae (= Compositae) (96 spp.). Most of these have a native range that includes tropical Asia, closely followed by those from Southern America (inclusive of the Caribbean, Central and South America), although at the island-group level, most have a higher proportion with a Southern American native range. Most naturalized species occur in anthropogenic habitats, but many are present in "natural" habitats with fewer species, such as Leucaena leucocephala, reported from specialized habitats like drylands. MalNAF provides a baseline for future studies of naturalized plant species distributions in the region.

TI  - Soil Nutrient Dynamics under Silviculture, Silvipasture and Hortipasture as Alternate Land-Use Systems in Semi-Arid Environment
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - In order to support livelihoods, enhance food security, restore ecosystem services, and reduce pressure on forests, degraded land can be restored by utilising alternative land-use systems (ALUS), such as silviculture, silvipasture, and hortipasture techniques. ALUS significantly modify the dynamics of soil nutrients in both the surface and subsurface layers. Soils from the 0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm layers of Leucaena leucocephala (S)-, Hardwickia binata (H)-, Emblica officinalis (A)-, and Azadiracta indica (N)-based silviculture systems, Acacia nilotica-based silvipasture systems (SPS), natural grassland (NT), and fallow land (F) were sampled in order to better understand the nutrient dynamics of ALUS. Soils under S, H, and SPS had similar to 203%, 195%, and 129% higher organic carbon (SOC), respectively, than fallow land in the 0-15 cm soil layer. In the subsequent soil layer, those land-use systems had similar to 199%, 82%, and 110% higher SOC, respectively, than fallow land. Similarly, in the deeper layer, those land uses had similar to 232%, 23%, and 105% higher SOC, respectively, than fallow land. SPS and NT also improved the SOC concentration significantly over fallow land. Plots under S, H, and SPS had similar to 198%, 190%, and 125% higher available N, respectively, than fallow land in 0-15 cm soil layer. In the 15-30 cm soil layer, those land-use systems had similar to 19%9, 82%, and 110% higher available N, respectively, than fallow land. These systems also improved the P and K contents in subsurface soil. Micronutrient concentrations were also improved in soils under S, H, and SPS. Hence, ALUS' adoption in degraded areas with trees provides a chance for C storage and improves the nutrient dynamics on degraded land.

TI  - Endorsement and phylogenetic analysis of some Fabaceae plants based on DNA barcoding
T2  - MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Background DNA barcoding have been considered as a tool to facilitate species identification based on its simplicity and high-level accuracy in compression to the complexity and subjective biases linked to morphological identification of taxa. MaturaseK gene (MatK gene) of the chloroplast is very vital in the plant system which is involved in the group II intron splicing. The main objective of this study is to determine the relative utility of the "MatK" chloroplast gene for barcoding in 15 legume as a tool to facilitate species identification based on their simplicity and high-level accuracy linked to morphological identification of taxa. Methods and Results MatK gene sequences were submitted to GenBank and the accession numbers were obtained with sequence length ranging from 730 to 1545 nucleotides. These DNA sequences were aligned with database sequence using PROMALS server, Clustal Omega server and Bioedit program. Maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining algorithms were employed for constructing phylogeny. Overall, these results indicated that the phylogenetic tree analysis and the evolutionary distances of an individual dataset of each species were agreed with a phylogenetic tree of all each other consisting of two clades, the first clade comprising (Enterolobium contortisiliquum, Albizia lebbek), Acacia saligna, Leucaena leucocephala, Dichrostachys Cinerea, (Delonix regia, Parkinsonia aculeata), (Senna surattensis, Cassia fistula, Cassia javanica) and Schotia brachypetala were more closely to each other, respectively. The remaining four species of Erythrina humeana, (Sophora secundiflora, Dalbergia Sissoo, Tipuana Tipu) constituted the second clade. Conclusion Moreover, their sequences could be successfully utilized in single nucleotide polymorphism or as part of the sequence as DNA fragment analysis utilizing polymerase chain reaction in plant systematic. Therefore, MatK gene is considered promising a candidate for DNA barcoding in the plant family Fabaceae and provides a clear relationship between the families.

TI  - The Perception of Farmers on Soil Erosion and Conservation Measures in the Surrounding Areas of Lake Ziway, Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - The level of sediment deposited in the Lake Ziway is increasing through time as a result of soil erosion, and eventually the depth of the lake has decreased. Therefore, the objective of the study was to assess farmers' perception of soil erosion and the conservation measures to the surrounding areas of Lake Ziway in the central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. The survey was made using purposive sampling techniques. The survey has considered the 14 Kebeles from the 3 districts adjacent to the lake. From each Kebele, 10 respondents were selected randomly. Totally, 140 respondents were selected from the community. The descriptive statistic was used to compare the dependent variables. The majority of respondents (92.2%) have observed the presence of soil erosion in the study area. The hillsides and slope areas are the major sources of soil erosion, according to 80% of the respondents. The respondents that have identified the most and least susceptible soils to erosion by their textural classes are sand soil (Biyyo Chirecha) (57.1%) and soft clay soil (Biyyo Bole) (1.4%), respectively. The soil erosion is increasing in their cultivated land and surrounding areas. The study has found that most of the respondents (86.5%) are participating in soil and water conservation activities. Leucaena leucocephala, Faidherbia albida, Azadirachta indica, and Schinus molle are the dominant tree species planted in the study area for soil and water conservation purposes. In conclusion, there is heavy soil loss due to erosion on cultivated land from the upland which directly deposited to Lake Ziway as sediment which decreases the lake depth. The study recommends that appropriate soil and water conservation measures and land management should be implemented on erosion prone areas in the Lake Ziway watershed with full participation of all stakeholders including the local farmers.

TI  - Long-term impact of silviculture systems on phosphorus transformation and adsorption behaviour in semi-arid restored lands
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a key nutrient in silvicultural ecosystems, where its cycling influences both primary productivity and ecosystem development. Different trees affect P availability in distinct ways. Analyzing impact of various trees on soil P fractions and the its adsorption-desorption behavior helps better understand soil P availability in these ecosystems. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of silviculture systems (SCSs) on depth distribution of P fractions, the P adsorption-desorption pattern, and P availability in eco-restored land. Three distinct silviculture systems, namely Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Hardwickia binata (HB), and Azadirachta indica (AI) SCSs were compared with degraded fallow (F) to assess their influence on soil properties and P dynamics in a Typic Haplustepts of semi-arid ecosystem. Soil samples were collected from three different depths 0-15 cm, 15-30 cm, and 30-45 cm of these SCSs. The LL, HB and AI showed 2.50, 2.01 and 1.39 times increase in available P over fallow, respectively. Microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) content increased in LL by 99, 97, and 53 % at 0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm, respectively, over fallow. For acid phosphatase activity, LL, HB, and AI exhibited 3.15, 2.43, and 1.56 folds increase over fallow. The distribution of different phosphorus fractions followed the order: Fe-P (39.9-36.7 %)> Organic P (25.7-24.4 %) > Al-P (24.8-19.1 %)> Ca-P (8.64-4.05 %)> Res-P (8.61-7.37 %)> Saloid P (0.63-0.50 %). Additionally, P adsorption-desorption revealed that SCSs could lower the adsorption capacity and P desorption than fallow. Thus, different silviculture systems exhibit the potential to enhance the P-supplying capacity of soil and restore degraded soils in semi-arid regions.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration Potential of Forest Plantation Soils in Eastern Plateau and Hill Region of India: a Promising Approach Toward Climate Change Mitigation
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Plantation tree species have an immense potential for significantly reducing the atmospheric carbon dioxide and hence regulating climate change. The present study assessed the role of tree species to store carbon and soil enrichment in the eastern plateau and hill region of India. The species investigated were Leucaena leucophala, Gmelina arborea, Cassia siamea, and Eucalyptus tereticornis. The plantation of trees was found to have higher levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) (0.53-0.62%), nitrogen (239.12-253.01 kg ha(-1)), phosphorus (37.02-38.79 kg ha(-1)), and potassium (175.47-237.22 kg ha(-1)) over the non-forested land (control) but was lower in the levels of pH (5.28-5.95) and bulk density (1.32-1.52 g cm(-3)). However, as soil depth increased, the nutritional status of both plantation and non-forested land soil decreased. The per cent SOC was the highest in surface layers, while the bulk density was the highest in sub-surface layers under different forest plantations. The maximum SOC (0.62%) and bulk density (1.52 g cm(-3)) were present in Gmelina arborea and Eucalyptus tereticornis plantation, respectively. Among the studied tree species, the soil carbon density and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) were found to be maximum (13.56 t ha(-1) and 1.28 t ha(-1) year(-1)) in Gmelina arborea followed by Eucalyptus tereticornis, Cassia siamea, and Leucaena leucocephala, respectively, depicting that these tree species have a stronger capacity to sequester and store carbon, making them suitable as atmospheric carbon reducers. The study also demonstrated that forest plantation enhanced the SOC, nutrient stock, and other crucial soil fertility indicators compared to non-forested site.

TI  - Okra tree crop agroforestry model: economic and environmental impact
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L. Moench) is a beneficial vegetable and oil crop that has found valuable use as food, paper, medicine, and oil. However, because of climate change, a lack of better okra cultivars that can resist drought has hampered okra production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and across the world. This study aimed to investigate the economic production of this vegetable in a forest setting. The okra (A. esculentus L.) experiment was conducted underneath three forest trees (i.e. Albizia lebbeck, Melia azedarach, and Leucaena leucocephala) in the agroforestry area. A single-factor Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications was utilised. The sample was then separated into three groups: okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry, okra-M. azedarach agroforestry, and okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry. The findings of the study revealed that okra production had differed significantly in three agroforestry practices. The fresh okra yield was highest (10.20 ton/ha) in the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry. The okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry (9.10 ton/ha) came in second, while the lowest yield was in the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry (8.90 ton/ha). Moreover, the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry recorded the maximum benefit-cost ratio (3.97) for economic performance. This ratio was 21% and 14% higher compared to the respective performance of the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry and okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry. However, the highest amount of carbon sequestration (238.90 ton/ha/yr) was measured in the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry as well as (229.80 ton/ha/yr) in the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry practice. Finally, the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry practice would significantly increase production, touching financial benefit and ensuring sound environmental quality using the vacant woodlot space.

TI  - Ecological restoration of degraded lands with alternate land use systems improves soil functionality in semiarid tropical India
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - To test the applicability of alternate land use systems for improving soil functionality in restored ecologies, soils were sampled from 0-15, 15-30 and 30-45 cm deep layers of Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Hardwickia binata (HB), Emblica officinalis (EO), Azadiracta indica (AI)-based silviculture systems; Acacia nilotica-based silvipasture systems (AN); and natural grassland (NG). These were compared with samples from fallow land (F). They were evaluated for their carbon management index (CMI), nutrient supply capacity (NSC), soil functionality (SF), ecorestoration efficiency (ERE) and 21-day cumulative microbial respiration (CO2-21) to assess their applicability in semiarid India. Soil functionality and functional diversity as impacted by restoration have remained largely overlooked. The LL had similar to 12, 7 and 11% higher CMI than fallow in sampled soil layers. ERE of LL was similar to 55, 65 and 79% higher than fallow land in sampled soil layers, respectively. However, ERE in surface layer was poorer than subsequent soil layers for all systems. The LL, HB and AN improved NSC and SF by: a) similar to 2.5-, 2.2- and 1.6-times; and b) 9.3-, 5.3- and 5.1-times over fallow land in the surface soil layer. A similar trend was observed for SF in lower layers. However, the topsoil layer had >16% mean SF values than subsequent layers. LL, HB and AN systems had similar to 4.2-, 2.3- and 1.9-times higher CO2-21 than fallow land in the top layer. CO2-21 was positively correlated with NSC and SF but could not predict ERE well. Hence, legume tree-based restoration tactics might be useful for improving land restoration and soil functionality in semiarid regions.

TI  - Isolation of polysaccharide producer and heavy metal tolerant local rhizobial isolates
T2  - ADVANCEMENTS IN LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Rhizobial bacteria is an important species among the soil bacteria that inter a relationship with leguminous plant and fix nitrogen symbiotically. Importance of this relation not only for soil as soil fertilizer but also to keep our environment without pollution. Methods: Survey was conducted to collect different strains of rhizobial from different area in Nineveh Governate in Iraq. Isolation and biochemical tests were done under laboratory conditions. Determination of exopolysaccharide and tolerance of heavy metal was conducted also. Data obtained was recorded after cultivation and incubation of rhizobial strains.Results: The rhizobial bacteria were isolated from the following leguminous plants: Vigna unguiculata L., Trifolium alexandrinum, Trigonella foenum-graecum L., Leucaena leucocephala L., Medicago sativa L., Phaseolus vulgaris L., Tribulus terrestris L. and Vicia faba L. Maximum exopolysaccharide production were reached to 3.70 gm/L by the isolate R. leguminosarum bv. Viciae RM25,after two days of incubation. The maximum cell dry weight was 2.90 gm/L. by the isolate E. meliloti RM14, after two days of incubation. Maximum reduction in pH were 4.30 by strain E. meliloti RM5, after two days incubation. All the local isolated rhizobia were tolerated to nickel chloride for the studied concentrations: 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 mu g/ ml. Also were tolerance to 100 and 500 mu g/ ml of zinc sulfate and copper sulfate. 1000 mu g/ ml concentration of zinc sulfate were also tolerated by all rhizobial isolates.Conclusion: Rhizobium bacteria possess several mechanisms that allow them to tolerate heavy metal exposure. These mechanisms include the expression of efflux pumps, the presence of metal-resistance plasmids, the production of EPS, and the ability to adapt to environmental factors. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind the heavy metal tolerance in Rhizobium and to explore the potential applications of these bacteria in bioremediation of heavy metal polluted soils.

TI  - Decomposition and nutrient release of leaves of tree legumes with agroforestry potential in the sub-humid tropic
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Litterfall, decomposition, and nutrient release to the soil are important biogeochemical cycling processes in agroecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of decomposition and nutrient release of the leaves of four tree legumes with agroforestry potential: Piscidia piscipula, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Lysiloma latisiliquum, common in the areas with natural regeneration after the abandonment of agriculture in south-eastern Mexico. We employed 112 litterbags with 40 g of dry leaf litter on ground surface for decomposition and recollected seven bags per species at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. The initial and recollected samples were oven-dried, and weighed to determine the remaining dry mass (DM), organic matter (OM), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) content, and the C:N ratio. The initial OM and N contents of L. leucocephala leaves were greater, compared to the rest of the legumes. P. piscidia and G. sepium showed the highest C content. P. piscidia, G. sepium, and L. latisiliquum had the highest C:N ratio, compared to L. leucocephala. The relative decomposition rate k values of DM, OM, C, and N were greater for L. leucocephala. The remaining DM, OM, C, and N were affected by the interaction between species and decomposition time. G. sepium and L. latisiliquum showed greater remaining mass from 30 to 60 days of decomposition. However, after 60 days L. latisiliquum showed the greatest remaining DM and OM until the end of the incubation period (120 days). We conclude that L. leucocephala had the highest rate of decomposition and the fastest release of nitrogen, however, the asynchronous pattern of litter decomposition among the tree legumes showed the potential to supply OM and nutrients to the soil for a prolonged period if planted in combination in agroforestry systems.

TI  - Effects of browse legume species addition on nutritional composition, fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability of <i>Opuntia</i> cladodes silage
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB  - Forage legumes are commonly used as an absorbent additive in high-moisture silages. Thus this study was carried out to assess the nutritive value, fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability of Opuntia-legume browse mixed silages. Five browse legume species (Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia mellifera, Searsia lancea, Prosopis velutina, and Grewia flava) were mixed with Opuntia cladodes. The silage mixture was formulated at a ratio of 60 Opuntia cladodes: 40 leguminous browse species and ensiled in polythene bags and kept in a laboratory for 42 days to determine chemical composition and fermentation characteristics. Silage samples were also subjected to an aerobic stability test. One-way analysis of variance in a completely randomised design was used to analyse the data. The pH values for silages made from Opuntia cladodes with L. leucocephala, A. mellifera and G. flava were lower than 4.8, which is considered an indicator of good-quality silage. The water-soluble carbohydrates content of silages made with Opuntia cladodes and S. lancea and G. flava was within the range of 8-12 g/kg dry matter, which is sufficient for good fermentation. The highest CO(2 )production, which signifies poor aerobic stability, was recorded for the control silage (Opuntia) compared to all Opuntia-legume mixed silage treatments. The addition of legume browse leaf-meal to Opuntia cladodes improved nutritive value, fermentation characteristics, and silage quality. Therefore, despite some limitations, Opuntia-legume browse silages, particularly Opuntia-G. flava and Opuntia-L. leucocephala, proved to be beneficial for livestock, as they meet the nutritional requirement of a ruminant.
   Significance:
   This study underlines the importance of co-ensiling Opuntia cladodes and high protein legume browse hay to offer an alternative feeding strategy for ruminant livestock and ensure sustainable provision of high-quality feed during dry periods.

TI  - Thriving green havens in baking deserts: Plant diversity and species composition of urban plantations in the Sahara Desert
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
AB  - Hot arid zones represent vital reservoirs of unique species and ecosystems, holding significant importance for biodiversity. This study aimed to explore the plant diversity associated with tree plantations in urban ecosystems under hyper-arid climatic conditions in the Sahara Desert of Algeria. In May 2022, 30 quadrats measuring 1 m2 each were established at the base of Phoenix dactylifera, Leucaena leucocephala, and Tamarix aphylla, corresponding to the dominant tree species in each of three plantations. In each quadrat, the plant quantitative inventory was conducted to measure plant diversity and similarity among the studied plantations. Based on this, we assessed the plant functional traits and rarity/abundance status of the flora. The findings revealed a diverse flora associated with the studied plantations, comprising 29 plant species grouped into 27 genera and 12 families. Notably, Poaceae (accounting for 30.8% of the flora), Asteraceae (25.0%), and Zygophyllaceae (21.6%) were well-represented. With an overall density of approximately 555 individuals/m2, Zygophyllum album (120 individuals/m2) and Polypogon monspeliensis (87 individuals/m2) emerged as the most abundant species. Functional trait analysis underscored the pivotal role of therophytes (constituting over 50.0% of the flora) and anemochorous species (33.0%-62.5%). Phytogeographic analysis emphasized the prevalence of the Saharo-Arabic element (constituting over 31.0% of the flora) and the Mediterranean Saharo-Arabic element (9.5%-21.5%). The Cosmopolitan element thrived under disturbance factors, recording percentages from 13.0% to 20.0% of the plant community. The rarity/abundance status of the flora emphasized the significance of rare, common, and very common species in the studied plantations. These findings could provide fundamental data for the effective control and management of biodiversity in hot hyper-arid urban ecosystems.

TI  - Assessment of antioxidant and antibacterial efficacy of some indigenous vegetables consumed by the Manipuri community in Sylhet, Bangladesh
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - The rapid dietary changes experienced by indigenous people worldwide threaten the use of traditional foods, which are often undervalued. This study focused on evaluating the antioxidant and antibacterial efficacy of five vegetables typically consumed by the Manipuri ethnic groups in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh: Yongchak seed (Parkia speciosa), Telikadam seed (Leucaena leucocephala), Phakphai leaf (Persicaria odorata), Sheuli leaf (Nyctanthes arbor-tristis), and bamboo shoot (Bambusa spp.). The samples were dried and powdered to assess the antioxidant activity through total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total tannin content (TTC), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. Antibacterial efficacy was determined by measuring the zone of inhibition (ZOI), minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Leafy vegetables exhibited higher TPC, TFC, and TTC than seeds and shoots, with N. arbor-tristis leaf showing the highest TPC (99.16 +/- 2.07 mg GAE/g DW) and P. odorata leaf exhibiting the highest TFC (9.19 +/- 0.7 mg QE/g) and TTC (3.59 +/- 0.26 mg TAE/g). However, Bambusa spp. shoot extract showed the highest antioxidant potential (IC50: 1.66 +/- 0.05 mg/mL). All samples exhibited higher ZOI against gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp.), ranging from 10 +/- 2.65 to 19.33 +/- 2.08 mm. L. leucocephala seed extract showed the highest antibacterial activity against both the tested gram-positive bacteria with a MIC of 15.6 mg/mL. Conversely, the P. odorata leaf extract exerted the strongest antibacterial effect against gram-negative bacteria, with the lowest MIC values for Klebsiella spp. (31.25 mg/mL) and Escheria coli (62.5 mg/mL). The findings of this investigation suggest that the selected indigenous vegetables could be valuable sources of phytochemicals with potential antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Incorporating and promoting these traditional foods into the diet may improve food security, dietary diversity, and public health in Bangladesh.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas emissions from different land utilization types in Western Kenya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - IntroductionThere is a vast data gap for the national and regional greenhouse gas (GHG) budget from different smallholder land utilization types in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) at large. Quantifying soil GHG, i.e., methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from smallholder land utilization types, is essential in filling the data gap.MethodsWe quantified soil GHG emissions from different land utilization types in Western Kenya. We conducted a 26-soil GHG sampling campaign from the different land utilization types. The five land utilization types include 1) agroforestry M (agroforestry Markhamia lutea and sorghum), 2) sole sorghum (sorghum monocrop), 3) agroforestry L (Sorghum and Leucaena leucocephala), 4) sole maize (maize monocrop), and 5) grazing land.Results and discussionThe soil GHG fluxes varied across the land utilization types for all three GHGs (p <= 0.0001). We observed the lowest CH4 uptake under grazing land (-0.35 kg CH4-C ha-1) and the highest under sole maize (-1.05 kg CH4-C ha-1). We recorded the lowest soil CO2 emissions under sole maize at 6,509.86 kg CO2-Cha-1 and the highest under grazing land at 14,400.75 kg CO2-Cha-1. The results showed the lowest soil N2O fluxes under grazing land at 0.69 kg N2O-N ha-1 and the highest under agroforestry L at 2.48 kg N2O-N ha-1. The main drivers of soil GHG fluxes were soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, soil moisture, clay content, and root production. The yield-scale N2O fluxes ranged from 0.35 g N2O-N kg-1 under sole maize to 4.90 g N2O-N kg-1 grain yields under agroforestry L. Nevertheless, our findings on the influence of land utilization types on soil GHG fluxes and yield-scaled N2O emissions are within previous studies in SSA, including Kenya, thus fundamental in filling the national and regional data of emissions budget. The findings are pivotal to policymakers in developing low-carbon development across land utilization types for smallholders farming systems.

TI  - The alien vascular flora of the Pantelleria Island National Park (Sicily Channel, Italy): new insights into the distribution of some potentially invasive species
T2  - BIOINVASIONS RECORDS
AB  - Pantelleria is a volcanic island located in the Sicily Channel (Italy), between Sicily and Tunisia. The island, designated a National Park in 2016, hosts an interesting vascular flora of over 600 species including 9 narrow endemics. The island's incredible biodiversity is, however, at risk due to anthropogenic influences, climate change, and, recently, the presence and spread of alien plant species. The Pantelleria alien flora has never been thoroughly investigated, probably because many non-native species were not yet present or so widespread on the island. Now, however, with the increased general awareness of the risks associated with invasive alien species, documentation of the presence of non-native species has been steadily increasing. In this study, field and literature research was carried out to investigate the alien flora of the island. Here, we report the status of a number of non-native plants with known invasive potential. Cenchrus setaceus (=Pennisetum setaceum) is reported for the first time as naturalized in the island with clear invasive behaviour, while, particularly remarkable for their invasive potential are other studied plants such as: Acacia saligna, Ailanthus altissima, Boheravia coccinea, Carpobrotus edulis, Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata, Malephora crocea, Melia azedarach, Nicotiana glauca, Opuntia ficus-indica, Parkinsonia aculeata, Washingtonia robusta and a few others less important at the moment, but to be monitored. Although most taxa showed a relatively limited distribution, the trend is to observe an increased invasiveness, which indicates that they can potentially become invasive in Pantelleria as well in the next years or decades. Their limited current distribution suggests that these species are in the early stages of the general invasion curve, when intervention is feasible and most likely to succeed. Therefore, it is most prudent to prioritize management for as many potentially problematic nonnatives as possible, which will contribute greatly to the conservation of native species and ecosystems of Pantelleria. Prevention and management of invasive non-native species-both future arrivals and those already present-are necessary to preserve the peculiar volcanic landscape of Pantelleria, which was shaped by man over the last millennia.

TI  - Interactive Effect of Residue Quality and Agroecologies Modulate Soil C- and N-Cycling Enzyme Activities, Microbial Gene Abundance, and Metabolic Quotient
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Understanding interactive effect of agroecology explained by rainfall, temperature, elevation, and biochemical composition of residues on soil microbial abundance and functions is crucial for unraveling soil ecological processes. This study aimed to investigate how agroecology and residue quality influence enzymatic activities, gene abundance, and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)). A field experiment was conducted using Leucaena leucocephala (LL) (high-quality residue) and Acacia decurrens (AD) (low-quality residue) in soils of highland and midland agroecologies. These residues differed in decomposability, characterized by a ratio of (lignin + polyphenol)/N of 5.0 for high-quality residue versus 21.0 for low-quality residue. Two experimental setups were employed: soil with litter mixture in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes and residues buried in the surface soil using litterbags. Soil samples were collected after 30, 120, and 270 days of incubation and analyzed for biochemical properties, enzyme activities, and the abundance of nitrifying and total archaea and bacteria. Soil respiration was also measured at different intervals in the field. qCO(2) was calculated using microbial biomass (MBC) and daily respiration (DCO2). Linear mixed model (P < 0.05) revealed that combined factors of agroecologies and residue qualities affected enzymatic activities, microbial abundance, soil properties, and qCO(2). Agroecological differences exerted a greater influence than residue qualities. Positive and negative significant correlations (P < 0.05, r = 0.27 to 0.67) were found between different C and N pools as well as enzymatic activities. Positive correlations (P < 0.05) were observed between the abundance of total bacteria, total archaea, and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria versus leucine-aminopeptidases. qCO(2) was influenced more by beta-xylosidase, leucine-aminopeptidases, and thermolysin-like neutral metalloproteases (TLP) than by beta-D-glucosidase and beta-D-cellobiohydrolase. Leucine-aminopeptidases and TLP were identified as rate-limiting factors for protein and peptide decomposition, while beta-xylosidase controlled hemicellulose degradation. In summary, this study provides insights into the intricate relationships between agroecology, residue quality, enzymatic activities, and microbial communities, shedding light on key processes governing soil ecological functions.

TI  - Twenty-one years' impact of using organic amendments on the productivity of rice-wheat rotation and soil properties
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB  - Shifting from chemical -intensive practices to organic -based farming within the rice -wheat rotation (RWR) is crucial for its long-term sustainability. This highly productive system holds a significant carbon (C) sequestration potential if managed efficiently. The dynamics of soil organic -C profoundly impacts the global climate change and crops' productivity, necessitating the continuous monitoring of organic carbon to ensure soil vitality. Hence, we have evaluated the long-term (twenty-one years) impact of organic amendments on yields of the RWR, soil properties and C -dynamics. After 21 years, we observed that organic -based amendments increased the rice and wheat grain yields by 33.4-52.5% and 20-42.8%, respectively, over the control (no organics). On an average, in top 0.0-0.15 m soil layer, the organic-manured plots had 21.6%, 21.3% and 23.4% greater available nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) over the control plot, respectively. Furthermore, such organic-manured plots recorded 32.9-50.8% and 6.04-32.3% greater microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) over the control. Also, the use of organic amendments had a significant (p <= 0.05) and positive impact on the soil carbon dynamics (0.0-0.45 m). In 0.0-0.45 m soil depth, the organic-manured treatments registered a 25.9-44.2% greater total organic carbon (TOC) than the control. These treatments improved the active (labile, very labile) and recalcitrant (less labile, non -labile) -C pools especially in upper soil layers. In summary, the synergistic use of Sesbania green manure, Leucaena leucocephala leaf manuring, farmyard manure, and biofertilizers (blue-green algae/ Azotobacter etc.) proves effective in restoring soil health and enhancing crop productivity by increasing soil organic carbon and ensuring nutrients availability. Thus, these organic amendment treatments can be advocated to farmers to sustain the productivity of the rice -wheat ecosystems.

TI  - Are the anthropized <i>Cerradão</i> of the <i>Cerrado</i>-<i>Pantanal</i> ecotone resistant to alien species invasion?
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Alien species pose a potential threat to biodiversity, necessitating vigilant monitoring to inform effective control strategies and prevent their invasiveness. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of alien species on the richness, horizontal structure, and diversity of the tree-shrub layer within a Cerrado-Pantanal transition region fragment. A floristic census was conducted across a fragment of approximately 3.0 ha, measuring all individuals with an aboveground diameter (DAG) >= 5.0 cm. The study assessed the statistical significance of diversity variation in the presence and absence of alien species using the Hutcheson t-test and examined the correlation between the proportion of alien species and various community parameters through Pearson's correlation. The findings revealed a total of 84 species belonging to 34 families, with a total of 2218 recorded individuals. Notably, eight species (9.52%) were identified as alien, distributed across five families. Among the alien species, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit exhibited the highest importance value. However, the analysis indicated that the presence of alien species did not yield a significant variation in diversity, as demonstrated by the applied test with a 5.0% probability level, at both the plot and community levels. Moreover, the correlation analysis indicated that the community variables exhibited a low association with the proportion of individuals belonging to alien species. Specifically, the correlation decreased in the following order: Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index, density of native species, basal area of native species, and richness of native species. The observed low correlation coefficients (r) and nonsignificant p-values (p < 0.05) suggested that the presence of alien species did not exert a significant influence on the richness, structure, and diversity of the tree-shrub layer within the studied fragment. This outcome was likely facilitated by the absence of dominant populations of alien species. Thus, the study concludes that, at least within this specific context, alien species do not exert a significant influence on the assessed community parameters.

TI  - Transcriptional Analyses of Genes Related to Fodder Qualities in Giant Leucaena Under Different Stress Environments
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata (giant leucaena) is a tree legume, whose foliage is used as a fodder for animals because of its high protein content. In spite of being a highly nutritious fodder, giant leucaena foliage has two undesirable secondary metabolites, mimosine and tannin. The amounts of mimosine and tannin in giant leucaena foliage are known to vary under different environmental conditions. Giant leucaena was grown under different salinity, pH and nitrogen availability conditions. It produced the highest amounts of mimosine at pH 6.0-7.0, whereas, variation in soil pH did not affect tannin concentrations. Salinity stress had negative effects on both mimosine and tannin concentrations, while nitrogen abundance promoted both mimosine and tannin production. Seven genes for mimosine and tannin metabolism were isolated from a transcriptome library of giant leucaena. These were mimosine synthase, mimosinase, chalcone synthase, flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol reductase, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, and anthocyanidin reductase. The highest level of mimosine synthase activity was observed in the absence of salt in the soils. Mimosine synthase activities had strong positive correlation with mimosine concentrations in the foliage (R-2 = 0.78) whereas mimosinase expression did not appear to have a direct relationship with salt concentrations. The expression of mimosine synthase was significantly higher in the leucaena foliage under nitrogen abundant condition than in nitrogen deficiency conditions, while mimosinase expression was significantly higher under nitrogen deficiency condition than in nitrogen abundance conditions. Mimosine concentrations in the foliage were positively correlated with the expression levels of mimosine synthase but not mimosinase. Similarly, the concentrations of tannin were positively correlated with expression levels of dihydroflavonol reductase, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, and anthocyanidin reductase. Understanding of the environmental conditions that promote or inhibit transcription of the genes for mimosine and tannin biosynthesis should help to design environmental conditions that inhibit transcription of these genes, resulting in reduced levels of these compounds in the leucaena foliage.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU TERNAK DAN VETERINER
AB  - This study was conducted to select a breed based on the morphological characteristics of Kacang goats in the dry land area, by assessing 31 doe Kacang goats. Semi-intensive raising system is carried out (without giving concentrate), yet water; forage (such as Gliricidia sepium leaves, Sesbania grandiflora leaves, Leucaena leucocephala leaves) and local grass are given by applying ad libitum method. Description of morphological characteristics, Pearson's correlation between body weight and body size, and body index, were analyzed using SPSS 25.0 program. The result of descriptive analysis for BW, BL, WH, CG, CW, CD, RW, RH, RL, HL, HW, and HH are 20.72 +/- 3.26 kg, 44.34 +/- 8.17 cm, 55.42 +/- 7.84 cm, 62.68 +/- 7.12 cm, 10.98 +/- 2.07 cm, 22.74 +/- 2.12 cm, 8.44 +/- 1.38 cm, 54.96 +/- 6.44 cm, 12.55 +/- 0.85 cm, 14.07 +/- 0.55 cm, 10.19 +/- 0.36 cm, dan 11.69 +/- 0.45 cm respectively. The value of the morphological index for WS, BI, DI, LI, PI, B, HS, FL, and CI are 0.78+0.12, 71.06 +/- 12.38, 0.42 +/- 0.06, 0.81 +/- 0.18, 67.55 +/- 11.93, 0.43 +/- 0.08, 11.18 +/- 5.78, 32.68 +/- 7.40, dan 72.48 +/- 2.82, respectively. The conclusion is that the body weight and body measurements in the dry land area are still below the quality National standards of Indonesia. The correlation coefficient of body weight with body size is in the positive range of moderate to high except, the correlation of body weight with head height which shows a negative correlation. The correlation coefficient of body weight with the morphological index is in the low positive range except for the correlation coefficient of body weight with width slope, balance, and height slope which has a negative correlation coefficient.

TI  - Effects of brining and standardized drying on the composition, shelf stability, microbial safety and antioxidant status of four wild edible vegetables
T2  - SUSTAINABLE FOOD TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Wild edible vegetables (WEVs) are integral for sustained nutrition and livelihood of forest-dwelling tribal communities. Shelf-life enhancement of WEVs is crucial to overcome their perishability and ensure availability. Chemical preservatives are detrimental to their commercial 'organic' status, and modern processing technologies are often challenging to be implemented by the marginalized farmers. In this study, four nutritionally important WEVs popularly cultivated, consumed and marketed in the hilly, forest-covered state of Mizoram, India, namely, Solanum aethiopicum (ST), Solanum torvum (TP), Solanum anguivi (TT) and Leucaena leucocephala (JZ), were subjected to brining and drying to enhance their shelf-lives. The drying method was standardized using response surface methodology at 80 degrees C and 540 minutes, obtaining the lowest moisture content with the highest total phenolic content (TPC) and DPPH radical scavenging activity (DRSA). A strong positive correlation was obtained between TPC and DRSA values of ST (R = 0.738), TP (R = 0.760), TT (R = 0.977) and JZ (R = 0.935). Both brined bottled and dried vacuum-packaged samples were studied over 35 days of storage. Packaged dried samples were stored at room temperature (RT) and under refrigeration (RF). Brined WEVs showed a decrease in moisture and carbohydrate contents. Microbial conversion of sugars to lactic acid was evidenced by lowering pH to below 3.0. Bacterial activity also markedly enhanced TPC, flavonoids and DRSA values by causing free phenolics release and their structural transformation. However, overall microbial population in terms of aerobic coliform bacteria and fungal species were efficiently retarded up to more than 65% by the two treatments. Vacuum-packaged RF samples exhibited lowered microbial metabolism. Pigment degeneration and tissue structure changes were indicated by changed color and hardness. Dried tissue brittleness enhanced the extractability of bioactive compounds. Vacuum-packaging improved antioxidant retention in the processed WEVs.

TI  - Anti-nutrient contents and methane reduction potential of medicinal plants from maize stover based diet
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from Ethiopian agriculture are significantly increasing, with the largest share is from enteric fermentation and manure left on pasture. An investigation was conducted to evaluate the anti-nutrient composition and effect of commonly used medicinal plant extracts on enteric methane emission from fibrous feeds using maize stover as substrate feed. Total phenols, flavonoid, tannin and essential oil contents were analyzed using established standards. Effects of leaf extracts of Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, three varieties of Cymbopogon citratus (Cymbopogon citratus-I, Cymbopogon citratus java and Cymbopogon citratus upper awash), Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa stenopetala, three varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosmarinus officinalis I, Rosmarinus officinalis II and Rosmarinus officinalis III) and Thyme schimperi, seed of three Coriandrum sativum varieties (Coriandrum sativum Batu, Coriandrum sativum Tulu and Coriandrum sativum Waltai) and root of Echinops kebericho on total gas production, digestibility and methane production of maize stover were investigated at different doses using the standard procedures. The results indicated that leaf extracts of Acacia nilotica had the highest (P < 0.001) total phenolic and total tannin contents. Compared to other evaluated plant species, all varieties of Cymbopogon citratus had the highest (P < 0.001) flavonoid content. Significantly high (P < 0.001) essential oil content was observed in Rosmarinus officinalis II than other varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis and other plant species. Significant reduction (P < 0.001) of methane production was observed with extracts of Cymbopoon citratus java (22.5 % less methane than the control) and thyme schimperi (16.7 % less methane than the control) at dose of 50 mg/kg DM. There was also significant (P < 0.001) interaction effect between plant species and dose rates at 50 mg/kg DM for both plant species. It can be concluded that the use of 50 mg/kg DM of Cymbopoon citratus java and Thyme schimperi extract to maize stover reduced methane production without negatively affecting feed digestibility. Further studies are necessary to examine the storability of the extracts in different time durations and evaluate their effects in vivo with animals.

TI  - Assessing the combination efficiency of some unconventional feed resources with concentrates and <i>Chloris gayana</i> grass in mitigating ruminal methane production in vitro
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro study, leaves of Acacia nilotica, Prosopis juliflora, Cajanus cajan, Leucaena leucocephala and seed kernel of Mangifera indica were identified as potential candidates in mitigating ruminal methane (CH4) production. The objective of the current study was to investigate the combination efficiency of these unconventional feeds with concentrate mix (CM) or Chloris gayana grass in CH4 reduction. Two feed combinations in different proportions were incubated in vitro with buffered rumen fluid at Hohenheim Gas test. In combination 1, C. gayana and CM were included as basal substrates, while in combination 2, A. nilotica, P. juliflora, C. cajan, L. leucocephala or M. indica seed kernel were included as CH4 reducing supplements at different proportions. The CH4 reducing potentials of feed combinations were presented as the ratio of CH4 to net gas production and expressed as percentage (pCH(4)). The pCH(4) for CM and C. gayana was 16.7% and 16.9%, respectively, while it ranged from 3.18% in A. nilotica to 13.1% in C. cajan. The pCH(4) was reduced (p < 0.05) from 14.6% to 9.39% when A. nilotica was combined with CM. In combination of L. leucocephala or C. cajan with CM, the pCH(4) (p < 0.05) was reduced from 16.5% and 16.6% with the lowest proportion to 15.1% and 15.2% with the highest inclusion rate respectively. The combination of C. gayana with L. leucocephala or C. cajan reduced (p < 0.05) the pCH(4) from 16.3% and 16.4% to 15.1% and 14.9% respectively. The pCH(4) was reduced (p < 0.05) from 13.4% to 7.60% when A. nilotica was combined with C. gayana. Estimated digestible organic matter (dOM) and metabolizable energy (ME) increased (p < 0.05) with increasing proportions of M. indica seed kernel with CM or C. gayana. In conclusion, the combination of the basal substrates with unconventional supplements resulted in CH4 reduction without affecting the dOM and ME at lower inclusion rates. Animal-based experiments await to validate in vitro findings.

TI  - Exploration of the Wild Edible Plants Used for Basic Health Care by Local People of Bahawalpur and Adjacent Regions, Pakistan
T2  - FOODS
AB  - The current study aimed to explore the traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous communities in Bahawalpur and adjacent regions, Pakistan, to treat a variety of diseases with a particular focus on the usage of ethnomedicinal wild plants. The objective of the study was to collect and evaluate local and indigenous knowledge regarding the quantity, variety, use and management of resources by the people. Data were gathered using Rapid Appraisal Approach (RAA), which involved in-person interviews. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics methods as well as common ethnobotanical analytical techniques viz. use value (UV), relative frequency of citation (RFC), informant consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL), relative importance (RI), frequency index (FI), family use value (FUV), family importance value (FIV), popular therapeutic use value (POPUT), plant part value (PPV), preference ranking (PR), cultural significance index (CSI), rank order priority (ROP) and Jaccard index (JI). A total of 158 plant species from 49 families were identified. The perennial herbs made up 72% of the documented species of therapeutic plants. There were 21 different species in each of the two major plant families i.e., Fabaceae and Poaceae. The maximum ICF were calculated for gonorrhea and paralysis (1.0) and maximum POPUT was calculated for skin disorders (0.088) and cough (0.077), respectively. The maximum UV was found for Rumex crispus (0.57) and RI for Leucaena leucocephala (4.38). Heliotropium crispum had the highest FL value (83%) and is used to treat kidney diseases. Alhagi maurorum had the greatest RFC (0.009) and FI (0.93). Arecaceae (0.45) and Fabaceae (13.39%) had the greatest FUV while Poaceae and Fabaceae had the highest FIV (13.29 for each). Leaves were the most frequently used plant part (35%). Alhagi maurorum (4.0) and Rumex crispus (32.57) had the highest CSI and ROP, respectively. The maximum JI (28.31) was calculated for Cholistan desert. These results showed the local population's reliance on herbal remedies to treat prevalent illnesses. To demonstrate the viability of species, it ' s crucial to emphasize both the use and conservation of these species. Adopting innovative applications, enhancing their value, and prioritizing the protection of multipurpose wild plants in inhabited environments is vital.

TI  - Growth rate of male Bali cattle (<i>Bos javanicus</i>) fed leucaena and rice straw diets with increasing levels of cassava
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB  - Context. The planting and use of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) to fatten cattle is both practical and profitable for smallholder farmers in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Currently smallholder farmers feed leucaena as the primary component of a cattle fattening diet. However, the high protein content in leucaena could be more effectively used if combined with a fermentable energy source, such as cassava (Manihot utilissima). Aim. An experiment was conducted to determine the ratio of leucaena to cassava corresponding to largest average daily gain and most efficient feed conversion for gain. Methods. Thirty growing male Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) similar to 18 months of age with an initial live weight of 164 +/- 1.8 kg (mean +/- s.e.) were allocated to one of six experimental treatments in a randomised block design. Bulls were held in individual stalls and had access to experimental diets and water ad libitum. The diets were 20% rice straw + 80% leucaena hay (A), 20% rice straw + 65% leucaena hay + 15% cassava meal (B), 20% rice straw + 50% leucaena hay + 30% cassava meal (C), 20% rice straw + 35% leucaena hay + 45% cassava meal (D), 20% rice straw + 20% leucaena hay + 60% cassava meal (E) and 20% rice straw + 5% leucaena hay + 75% cassava meal (F). A mineral mix was provided at 1% DM of total diet and urea was added to the cassava meal at 2% DM. In consideration of animal welfare concerns, the trial was concluded on Day 77 due to observations indicating that bulls receiving the highest level of cassava (F) were experiencing significant weight loss. Key results. The optimum level of inclusion of cassava was 29.5% (based on the quadratic response curve) but there was little difference in average daily gain up to 45% inclusion. Feeding a high level of cassava meal (more than 45% of diet) reduced feed intake, average daily gain and income over feed cost. Conclusion. Cassava meal can be successfully and profitably incorporated into leucaena-based rations of Bali bulls for fattening. Implications. Formulating rations with cassava meal and leucaena can be economically beneficial in cattle fattening systems.

TI  - Influence of selected plant extracts on bacterial motility, aggregation, hydrophobicity, exopolysaccharide production and quorum sensing during biofilm formation of enterohaemorrhagic<i> Escherichia</i><i> coli</i> O157:H7
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli is a serious threat to human and animal health, with antimicrobial drug resistance contributing to the problem. Alternative mechanisms of prevention and treatment of E. coli-induced diarrhoea include those targeting biofilm production and quorum sensing, properties that have been associated with some investigated plant extracts. Plants were selected from various genera, including Vachellia, Senegalia, Morus, Leucaena, Salix, Grewia, Ziziphus, Searsia, Dichrostachys and Ceratonia, based on their known antimicrobial activity. The antibacterial effects of leaf extracts against multidrug-resistant E. coli O157:H7 were investigated using a broth microdilution method, and cytotoxicity to normal mammalian cell lines was studied using a tetrazolium colorimetric assay. Subsequently, antibiofilm activity and inhibition of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production by plant extracts against E. coli O157:H7 was investigated using crystal violet as a staining dye after 0 and 24 h incubation and carbohydrate estimation 5 % phenol-sulfuric assay. The biosensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472 was used to study the anti-quorum sensing potential of the selected plant extracts. Cell motility, cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH), and aggregation were also investigated. All plant extracts had weak antibacterial activity (MIC > 0.62 mg/ml) with relatively low cytotoxicity. The acetone extracts of Salix babylonica and Leucaena leucocephala prevented bacterial cell attachment (0 h) by 81.21 % and 89.36 %, respectively. Approximately 28 % of plant extracts eradicated established biofilms by more than 50 %, however, they were unable to inhibit EPS production above 30 %. The halfmaximal concentration of extracts generally inhibited violacein production (ranging from 0.01 to 0.02 mg/ ml), with V. erioloba acetone extract being the most effective at quorum quenching. Some plant extracts exhibited a significant difference (p<0.05) in motility, aggregation and hydrophobicity compared to untreated cells. This study highlights the potential of selected plant extracts to act via different mechanisms of action to decrease virulence of enteric E. coli, motivating further investigation of the bioactive compounds in the leaves.

TI  - Synergistic effects of canopy chemistry and autogenic soil biota on a global invader
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil biota have strong effects on plants, but we have a poor understanding of how plant chemistry might modify these effects. We examined the effect of soil biota associated with an exotic invasive tree, Prosopis juliflora, versus that associated with native species, from seven sites across India on conspecifics and two other plant species. We then measured changes in species-specific soil biota effects (identified as plant-soil feedbacks, PSFs) when leaf leachate from P. juliflora or from native plant species was added to soil containing respective live and sterile soil inoculum.We quantified the amino acid L-tryptophan from leaf leachate of P. juliflora, Leucaena leucocephala (another invader), and two native species. We also tested effects of P. juliflora or native species soil inoculum amendment of tryptophan on P. juliflora, P. cineraria and L. leucocephala across seven sites. We then quantified the microbially metabolized derivatives of tryptophan, phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and intermediates after adding tryptophan into P. juliflora and native soils.Soil biota associated with P. juliflora generated positive effects on conspecifics and L. leucocephala, but negative effects on the native congener P. cineraria. When P. juliflora leaf leachate was added to soil with live P. juliflora inoculum, PSFs became more positive for P. juliflora and other species, compared to leaf leachate amended with sterile soil inoculum. Native leaf leachate interacted weakly with soil biota to impact biomass of conspecifics and heterospecifics.There was roughly 10x more tryptophan in the leaf leachate of P. juliflora than in the leaf leachate of other species. Tryptophan generally increased positive PSFs associated with P. juliflora relative to soil biota associated with other plant species. When tryptophan was added to live P. juliflora soil, IAA and its intermediates were produced at five of seven sites, and at four of these sites soil biota from P. juliflora had positive PSFs.Synthesis. These results provide the first experimental evidence that a chemical leached from the leaves of an invader regulates PSFs. Our results indicate that canopy effects and PSFs, which are usually studied independently, can interact in ways that strongly affect conspecifics and neighbouring species.

TI  - Non-native tree regeneration indicates regional and national risks from current invasions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Non-native (introduced, exotic, and alien) species alter forest ecosystem processes, cause landscape change, interfere with services provided by native trees, and contribute to biotic homogenization. To quantify the degree of invasion by non-native trees in the United States, we combined two broad-scale datasets: (1) tree species occurrence data from the national Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot network and (2) ecoregions characterized by relatively homogeneous environmental conditions. Using the FIA statistical design, we created an indicator of non-native tree regeneration success by estimating the proportion of small trees (seedlings and saplings) relative to all trees for non-native species in the conterminous United States and southeast Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Species with at least 75 percent of their stems consisting of smaller stems were classified as highly invasive while those with 60 percent to 75 percent of smaller stems were classified as moderately invasive. Above these thresholds, non-native species are of ecological concern because they are established and reproducing successfully and therefore likely to continue to spread in the future. For the conterminous United States and southeast Alaska, we identified 16 highly invasive and four moderately invasive non-native tree species. Widespread highly invasive and relatively well-established species included Ailanthus altissima, Triadica sebifera, and Ulmus pumila. The richness of highly invasive species was the highest in parts of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic States, followed by much of the Southeast. In Hawaii, we identified seven highly invasive and three moderately invasive non-native tree species. The most widespread highly invasive and well-established tree species in the archipelago were Psidium cattleyanum, Psidium guajava, Ardisia elliptica, and Syzygium cumini. The largest numbers of highly invasive species were inventoried in the lowland/leeward dry and mesic forests of O'ahu and the lowland wet and mesic forests of Hawai'i Island. Puerto Rico had 17 highly invasive and two moderately invasive tree species. The most widespread and well-established non-native species were Leucaena leucocephala, Spathodea campanulata, Coffea arabica, Syzygium jambos, and Melicoccus bijugatus. The results of this assessment offer insights into which species are most likely to alter forest ecosystems and which forests may be effectively managed to control invasive trees.

TI  - Great Facilitation of Thirty Years of Reforestation with Mixed Species to Ecosystem Nitrogen Accumulation in Dry-Hot Valley in the Jinsha River
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Nitrogen is a key factor influencing ecosystem structure and function in reforestation, but knowledge of ecosystem nitrogen accumulation through reforestation with mixed species is limited. Especially in the dry-hot valley of the Jinsha River, no studies cover total ecosystem nitrogen accumulation in mature plantations and its allocation for difficulty in collecting tree roots and deep soil from dry red soil. In this study, nitrogen accumulation of seven mixed plantations in the dry-hot valley in the Jinsha River was studied after thirty years of reforestation with an analogous sites method. The results were as follows: (1) Soil nitrogen stocks decreased with depth in the soil profile. Deep soil nitrogen storage (20-80 cm) was significantly correlated with stand age (R-2 = 0.752, p = 0.000; n = 7), accounting for 56-63% of total soil nitrogen storage and 43-47% of soil nitrogen accumulation in the dry-hot valley. (2) Total biomass nitrogen stock of the 30-year-old plantation was 1.22 t ha(-1), 61 times that of degraded wasteland and 7.6 times that of natural recovery shrub grassland, and it recovered to the reference level of natural forest following 30 years of reforestation. (3) Total ecosystem nitrogen stock in the 30-year-old plantation was 12.72 t ha(-1), 1.4 times the reference wasteland and 1.19 times the natural recovery shrub grassland. The contribution of soil nitrogen to ecosystem nitrogen storage and accumulation was 90% and 67%, respectively. Litter nitrogen accounted for 1.6% ecosystem nitrogen storage. It indicated that reforestation with mixed plantation of Leucaena leucocephala and other species greatly facilitated more ecosystem nitrogen accumulation, especially soil nitrogen (including deep compartment). Secondary biomass nitrogen, especially litter, could not be overlooked. This study filled the gap of ecosystem nitrogen storage and distribution during reforestation in the dry-hot valley. Mixed plantation with legume species such as L. leucocephala and other species and an important role of secondary biomass, especially litter in nitrogen accumulation, provided a reference for the strategy formulation of reforestation and forest nitrogen management in the dry-hot valley and other semi-arid or arid regions.

TI  - Comparative analysis of leaf litter decomposition and nutrient release patterns of bamboo and traditional species in agroforestry system in Ghana
T2  - CLEANER MATERIALS
AB  - Understanding leaf litter decomposition dynamics is imperative owing to nutrient release rates and synchronization. The overarching aim is to sustainably manage agroforestry systems and ensure environmental integrity. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the decomposition and nutrient release of leaves of different bamboo species (Oxytenanthera abyssinica, Bambusa balcooa, Bambusa vulgaris), rarely used woody perennials in agroforestry system in Ghana, and compared with commonly used agroforestry species; Albizia lebbeck, Senna siamea, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Eucalyptus grandis. Litterbag technique was used and freshly fallen leaves of the species (equivalent to 100 g on a dry weight basis) were collected and placed into 30 cm x 45 cm nylon litterbags with a 2-mm mesh size. The weight of the samples in the litterbags was based on local plant litter application rates (5 t dry matter ha1) for maize production in the study location. There was a total of 216 litterbags (27 per species) for the study. Eight transects spaced at 1.0 m apart were laid in a randomized complete block design and twenty-seven litter bags spaced 0.5 m apart were placed on each transect. The litterbags were buried at 2 cm depth and three samples of each species were retrieved and weighed for 210 days to determine weight loss and nutrient release. Compared with Oxytenanthera abyssinica (8 weeks) and Senna siamea (6 weeks) half-life, rate of decomposition was analogous and higher than the other species. Further, Bambusa balcooa and the other non-bamboo species showed similar rate of decomposition. However, Bambusa vulgaris had marginally slower rate of decomposition compared to the traditional species. The highest rate of N, P, K and Ca release was recorded for Albizia lebbeck. Nonetheless, rates of P, Ca and Mg release were comparable to the other non-bamboo species. Eucalyptus grandis and Bambusa vulgaris also showed dominance in initial nitrogen and lignin concentrations and release. Therefore, with the observed substantial and comparable litter quality and decomposition rate among the species, it may be imperative to consider using the bamboo species for soil amendment and green manure in agroforestry system.

TI  - Novel Recycling, Defibrillation, and Delignification Methods for Isolating α-Cellulose from Different Lignocellulosic Precursors for the Eco-Friendly Fiber Industry
T2  - POLYMERS
AB  - Alpha-cellulose, a unique, natural, and essential polymer for the fiber industry, was isolated in an ecofriendly manner using eleven novel systems comprising recycling, defibrillation, and delignification of prosenchyma cells (vessels and fibers) of ten lignocellulosic resources. Seven hardwood species were selected, namely Conocorpus erectus, Leucaena leucocephala, Simmondsia chinensis, Azadirachta indica, Moringa perigrina, Calotropis procera, and Ceiba pentandra. Moreover, three recycled cellulosic wastes were chosen due to their high levels of accumulation annually in the fibrous wastes of Saudi Arabia, namely recycled writing papers (RWPs), recycled newspapers (RNPs), and recycled cardboard (RC). Each of the parent samples and the resultant alpha-cellulose was characterized physically, chemically, and anatomically. The properties examined differed significantly among the ten resources studied, and their mean values lies within the cited ranges. Among the seven tree species, L. leucocephala was the best cellulosic precursor due to its higher fiber yield (55.46%) and holocellulose content (70.82%) with the lowest content of Klasson lignin (18.86%). Moreover, RWP was the best alpha-cellulose precursor, exhibiting the highest holocellulose (87%) and the lowest lignin (2%) content. Despite the high content of ash and other additives accompanied with the three lignocellulosic wastes that were added upon fabrication to enhance their quality (10%, 11%, and 14.52% for RWP, RNP, and RC, respectively), they can be considered as an inexhaustible treasure source for cellulose production due to the ease and efficiency of discarding their ash minerals using the novel CaCO3-elimination process along with the other innovative techniques. Besides its main role for adjusting the pH of the delignification process, citric acid serves as an effective and environmentally friendly additive enhancing lignin breakdown while preserving cellulose integrity. Comparing the thermal behavior of the ten cellulosic resources, C. procera and C. pentandra exhibited the highest moisture content and void volume as well as having the lowest specific gravity, crystallinity index, and holocellulose content and were found to yield the highest mass loss during their thermal degradation based on thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis in an inert atmosphere. However, the other resources used were found to yield lower mass losses. The obtained results indicate that using the innovative procedures of recycling, defibrillation, and delignification did not alter or distort either the yield or structure of the isolated alpha-cellulose. This is a clear indicator of their high efficiency for isolating cellulose from lignocellulosic precursors.

TI  - Foliage of Tropical Trees and Shrubs and Their Secondary Metabolites Modify In Vitro Ruminal Fermentation, Methane and Gas Production without a Tight Correlation with the Microbiota
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary Ruminants produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as a byproduct of microbial activity during ruminal fermentation. To lessen greenhouse gases emissions, it is necessary to evaluate methane-reducing feeding alternatives for ruminants, such as the use of tropical trees and shrubs. The secondary metabolites produced by these plants have been shown to reduce ruminal methane emissions. Here, we evaluated the effect of the foliage of eleven tropical trees and shrubs edible for cattle in ruminal fermentation, methane production and microbiota in an in vitro assay. The content of condensed tannins and saponins in the foliage was variable between the species of plants. We observed a reduction in methane production and changes in microbial populations depending on the species of tree or shrub. Additionally, condensed tannins reduced methane production. The inclusion of the foliage of tropical trees and shrubs in the diet of ruminants may be a step towards diminishing greenhouses gases emissions, and therefore reducing the contribution to global warming from cattle production. Ruminants, mainly cattle, contribute to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions as methane (CH4) is produced by ruminal fermentation. Hence, various anti-methanogenic feed strategies have been studied, including the use of plants with secondary metabolites. This study evaluated in vitro ruminal fermentation metrics, microbial composition by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and the CH4 production of the foliage of several tropical trees and shrubs: Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa oleifera, Albizia lebbeck, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Piscidia piscipula, Brosimum alicastrum, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Guazuma ulmifolia, Cnidoscolus aconitifolius, Gliricidia sepium and Bursera simaruba, using Cynodon plectostachyus grass as control. The results showed a wide variation in the chemical composition of the foliage, as well as in the ruminal microbiota. The crude protein (CP) content ranged from 11 to 25%, whereas the content of condensed tannins (CT) and saponins (S) was from 0.02 to 7%, and 3.2 to 6.6%, respectively. The greatest dry matter degradability (DMD) after 72 h was 69% and the least 35%, the latter coinciding with the least gas production (GP). A negative correlation was found between the CT and CH4 production, also between protozoa and fungi with the SGMT group of archaea. We concluded that the foliage of some tropical trees and shrubs has a high nutritional value and the potential to decrease CH4 production due to its CT content.

TI  - Effects of invasive species on the ecosystem services of a tropical insular protected area in Brazil
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) represent a global problem for biodiversity conservation, and a growing concern involving IAS is related to their impacts on ecosystem services. However, their effects on ecosystem services in insular ecosystems are poorly known, which are particularly relevant and concerning due to the fragility and limited resources in these areas for several organisms, including humans. Therefore, the present study aimed to inventory ecosystem services and assess the impact of IAS on these services and the terrestrial ecosystems of the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, Brazil, which is a tropical protected area. The approach was applied to four IAS: black rat (Rattus rattus), domestic cat (Felis catus), tegu lizard (Salvator merianae), and lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala). A worksheet for ecosystem services was created, using the subdivisions defined in the zoning of the protected areas of Fernando de Noronha as management units, namely Urban Area, Beach Area, Green Area, Primitive Area, and Secondary Island. Additionally, two quantitative approaches were combined: the INvasive Species Effects Assessment Tool (INSEAT) to assess the positive and negative effects of IAS on ecosystem services, based on a questionnaire applied to experts; and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software to estimate the risk of impacts from IAS. In total, 21 ecosystem services, 41 benefits, and 10 groups of benefitting social actors were identified in Fernando de Noronha. In general, all IAS presented risks to the ecosystem services of Fernando de Noronha, especially F. catus and R. rattus. According to the impact index, the IAS caused negative effects to most ecosystem services considered, but the effects were more pronounced on the provisioning and cultural ecosystem service groups. On the other hand, a positive effect was found for L. leucocephala on regulating and maintenance services, although with a low impact index. With the exception of the Urban Area, all management units showed a high risk of being impacted by IAS, especially the Primitive Area. The main social actors impacted by the IAS were the local community, the floating population, and the Administration. The present study is the first to combine these quantitative techniques (INSEAT and InVEST) and represents a set of guidelines for ecosystem-based management to mitigate the impact of IAS, aiming at the maintenance and improvement of ecosystem services within protected areas in insular environments.

TI  - Alley Cropping System in Degraded Land of Central India: Evaluation of Crop Performance, Economic Benefit and Soil Nutrients Availability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION
AB  - Hedgerow or alley cropping is being advocated for sustainable land productivity and improved soil health in the developing world. The suitable food-fodder species grown on bed and furrow system with soil moisture conservation practices need to be adopted for the success of alley cropping under rainfed semi-arid region. A field experiment was conducted during 2013-2016 to assess different food-fodder based alley cropping systems with resource conservation practices (RCP) for enhancing productivity, economic returns and energetics. The perennial Pennisetum tri-specific hybrid (TSH) grass and legume shrubs were planted on a raised bed of 1.5 m wide. One row of shrub was planted in the middle of the bed along with two rows of TSH grass on both side of the shrub row. The seasonal crops were grown in furrow (2.2 m) placed between two beds (1.5 m). In RCP, one supplement irrigation treatments to crops were given i.e. one pre-sowing irrigation (rabi) + other irrigation as per theoretical calculation i.e. 30% of total rainfall-ET losses. In-situ moisture conservation practices include residue retention (stubble height 15 cm + mulching (green weed biomass + litterfall) in furrows. The result indicates that among woody perennials, Sesbania sesban as a hedgerow was superior to Desmanthus virgatus but found at par with Leucaena leucocephala in terms of DM production. Furthermore, TSH grass grown on the side of woody legumes produced about 15-20 Mg DM ha(-1) across the treatment per year. The grain yield of the annual crops was in the order of barley > chickpea > pigeonpea across the years and not significantly influenced by perennial components. The highest system productivity (112.2 Mg ha(-1)) was found under TSH + S. sesban + (sorghum + cowpea-barley) cropping systems leading to higher net monetary returns (US$ 1430 ha(-1)). While alley cropping with sorghum + pigeonpea was the lowest yielder. Among resource conservation practices, one supplement irrigation and in-situ soil moisture conservation treatments were comparable and produced about 12-14% higher yield than control. The TSH + S. sesban + (sorghum + cowpea-barley) cropping system accumulated highest bio-energy (497 GJ ha(-1)) but maximum value of energy use efficiency was computed in TSH + Sesbania + (sorghum + pigeonpea). The soil organic carbon was enhanced substantially under 4 years of hedgerow systems over antecedent level. Findings of this study suggest that TSH + S. sesban hedgerow system grown in bed with seasonal crops (sorghum + cowpea-chickpea) in furrow could improve food and fodder production, ensure green fodder availability during dry season and sustain natural resources in rainfed semi-arid agro-ecologies.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Crossbred Cow Milk Production in a Silvopastoral System in Tropical Mexico
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary Currently there is an urgent need to modify food production systems, including the influence of ruminants, due to extensive land use and environmental impacts. Grazing cattle excreta emit considerable amounts of methane and nitrous oxide. The objectives of this work were to assess the production and quality of the forage, milk production, and methane and nitrous oxide emissions from the cattle feces and urine in two production systems: conventional grazing (grass in a monoculture) and a silvopastoral system (association of leguminous shrubs with grass). The inclusion of legumes in the diet of grazing cattle increases forage quality and reduces the methane and nitrous oxide emissions from urine and feces. In Mexico, pasture degradation is associated with extensive pastures; additionally, under these conditions, livestock activities contribute considerably to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Among the options to improve grazing systems and reduce GHG emissions, silvopastoral systems (SPS) have been recommended. The objectives of this work were to quantify the N outflow in a soil-plant-animal interface, as well as the CH4 emissions and milk production in an SPS with woody legumes (Leucaena leucocephala) that is associated with stargrass (Cynodon nlemfuensis). This was then compared with stargrass in a monoculture system (MS) in the seasons (dry and rainy period) over a two-year period. Dung was collected from the animals of each of the grazing systems and applied fresh to the land plots. Fresh dung and urine were collected from the cows of each grazing system and were applied to the experimental plots. In addition, the soil CH4 and N2O contents were measured to quantify the emissions. Average milk yield by seasons was similar: MS (7.1 kg per animal unit (AU)/day(-1)) and SPS (6.31 kg per AU/day(-1)). Cows in the MS had a mean N intake of 171.9 g/UA day(-1) without seasonal variation, while the SPS animals' mean N intake was 215.7 g/UA day(-1) for both seasons. For the urine applied to soil, the N2O outflow was higher in the MS (peak value = 1623.9 & mu;g N-N2O m(-2) h(-1)). The peak value for the SPS was 755.9 & mu;g of N-N2O m(-2) h(-1). The N2O emissions were higher in the rainy season (which promotes denitrification). The values for the feces treatment were 0.05% (MS) and 0.01% (SPS). The urine treatment values were 0.52% (MS) and 0.17% (SPS). The emissions of CH4 showed that the feces of the SPS systems resulted in a higher accumulation of gas in the rainy season (29.8 g C ha(-1)), followed by the feces of the MS system in the dry season (26.0 g C ha(-1)). Legumes in the SPS helped to maintain milk production, and the N2O emissions were lower than those produced by the MS (where the pastures were fertilized with N).

TI  - Potential of Combined Yeast Culture and Enzymatically Hydrolysed Yeast to Improve In Vitro Dry Matter and Nutrient Degradability of Different Feedstuffs
T2  - RUMINANTS
AB  - Simple Summary Enzymatically hydrolysed yeast is a novel form of yeast culture with positive effects as prebiotics used to improve gastrointestinal health in ruminants. However, their effect on ruminal nutrient digestion is unclear. This study evaluated the effects of a combined yeast culture and enzymatically hydrolysed yeast on dry matter, fibre, and crude protein ruminal digestibility in vitro. Seven different substrates inclusive of legume and grass forages and commercial supplemental feedstuffs were incubated for 24 and 48 h, with or without enzymatically hydrolysed yeast, and again for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h to determine crude protein degradability. Enzymatically hydrolysed yeast improved the fibre digestion of Brachiaria arrecta by 32%, while the dry matter and crude protein digestibility in soybean meal and Glircidia sepium were reduced by 16.2% and 38.5%, respectively, after 24 h of incubation. Therefore, enzymatically hydrolysed yeast has potential to improve ruminal fibre digestibility and modify the crude protein degradation of different substrates, which may contribute to the improved utilization of fibrous feedstuffs and efficiency in nitrogen and crude protein metabolism in ruminants.Abstract Live yeast cultures have been a popular additive in ruminant feeds to improve fermentation efficiency, rumen, and intestinal health. However, very little is known about inactive yeast culture and hydrolysable yeast cells on nutrient digestibility in ruminants. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effects of a combined yeast culture and enzymatically hydrolysed yeast (YC+EHY) on in vitro dry matter and nutrient digestibility. Seven chemically contrasting substrates, including the leaves and petiole of forage plants (Trichanthera gigantea, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Brachiaria arrecta), agriculture by-products (soybean meal and rice hulls), and a commercial concentrate feed, were incubated in vitro with and without YC+EHY to determine dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), and acid detergent fibre (ADF) digestibility after 24 and 48 h of incubation. A second experiment evaluated in vitro CP degradability by incubating substrates for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h with and without YC+EHY. Incubation with YC+EHY reduced 24 h DM and CP digestibility in soybean meal and G. sepium by 16.2% and 38.5%, respectively. Conversely, the ADF digestibility of B. arrecta incubated with YC+EHY increased by 32%. In vitro ruminal DM and nutrient digestibility were unaffected by YC+EHY after 48 h of incubation. The rate of CP degradability in the commercial concentrate and rice hull inoculated with YC+EHY increased sharply between 16 and 24 h post-incubation and generally plateaued afterwards. Similarly, YC+EHY significantly increased CP degradability in L. leucocephala after 8 and 16 h of incubation. The 16 h CP degradation in T. gigantea without YC+EHY was significantly higher. It was therefore concluded that YC+EHY has potential to improve ruminal ADF digestibility and modify ruminal CP degradation dependent on the type of substrate.

TI  - The diversity and quality of forages and their potency as herbal anthelmintic for swamp buffalo in Brebes District, Central Java
T2  - VETERINARY WORLD
AB  - Background and Aim: Swamp buffaloes play an important role in the rural economy of Indonesia. They consume various forages during their grazing time, including those with anti-parasitic potential. However, the information about the type and quality of forages and their potential as a natural anthelmintic for swamp buffalo is very limited. This study aimed to identify the diversity, quality, and anthelmintic potency of forages consumed by swamp buffaloes reared in Bantarkawung Subdistrict, Brebes District, Central Java Province, Indonesia.Materials and Methods: Samples of forages were obtained during three observation periods of the study, with a 12-week interval between each period. Forage diversity was evaluated by identifying its consumption by swamp buffaloes during their grazing activity in the field and feeding time in their shed. The quality of forages was analyzed using proximate analysis to measure their dry matter (DM), crude fiber (CF), crude protein (CP), crude fat (CFat), and ash contents. This is followed by the calculation of their total digestible nutrient based on the proximate analysis results. Botanical composition analysis was then conducted to measure the predominance of forages consumed by the livestock during their grazing activity. Literature reviews were carried out to explore forage's anthelmintic activity.Results: The results showed that swamp buffaloes consume nine species of forage in the shed and 47 in the grazing area, including nine legumes, 18 grass, and 20 others. Swamp buffaloes consumed forages of lower quality, which contained high CF contents and varying levels of other nutrients below their daily nutritional needs. The grazing activity allowed swamp buffaloes to consume a higher variety of forages with better nutritional quality, thereby enabling them to meet their nutritional needs. Legumes and other forages served as the major protein sources, providing CP of 20.03% DM and 11.53% DM, and CF levels of 17.01% DM and 20.35% DM, respectively. The results also showed that the consumption of these forages increased during the rainy season. The predominant species of legumes consumed were Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia spp., while Alternanthera sessilis and Merremia umbellata were the predominant species of other forages. A total of 13 of the 47 species could potentially be used as natural anthelmintic due to their secondary metabolites, namely, tannin, flavonoid, saponin, terpenoid, diterpenoid, and mimosine. These compounds exert anthelmintic effects by inhibiting egg-hatching and larval development, as well as damaging the surface structure of both larvae and adult worms, ultimately leading to the death of the parasites.Conclusion: Overall, swamp buffaloes consumed more variety of forages during grazing compared to when they were kept in sheds. While the low-variety and low-quality forages provisioned for swamp buffaloes in their shed resulted in a low nutrient intake below their daily requirement. Furthermore, daily grazing activities allowed swamp buffaloes to fulfill and supplement their need by consuming a variety of grasses, legumes, and other forages in their respective grazing areas. Some of these forages also have the potential to become natural anthelmintic because they contain secondary metabolites, such as tannins, flavonoids, saponins, terpenoids, diterpenoids, and mimosine.

TI  - Co-inoculation of Rhizobium and Arbuscular Mycorrhiza Increases <i>Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia</i> Growth in Soil Degraded by Manganese Mining
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Co-inoculation of microorganisms has been frequently used to promote greater plant growth in degraded soils. However, the use of this biotechnological strategy for the revegetation of soils contaminated by heavy metals in mining areas is still poorly understood. In our study, we analyzed the influence of the co-inoculation of rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the initial growth of Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia and its tolerance to excessive manganese (Mn) in a soil degraded by mining. In an experiment in a greenhouse, the species M. caesalpiniaefolia was cultivated to evaluate the establishment potential considering the contribution of the co-inoculation of rhizobia and AMF together or in isolation. In addition, we use control plants, under ideal levels of nutrients. Co-inoculated plants showed greater tolerance to excessive Mn and had their initial growth stimulated. The highest mycorrhizal colonization rate (64%) was observed in the treatment with AMF alone, while the highest abundance of AMF spores in the soil (419.7) was found when the plants were co-inoculated. In addition to favoring the balance of nutrients in the plant and the use of nitrogen and phosphorus from the soil, co-inoculation also provided higher levels of Mn in the roots and lower levels of Mn in the shoot. Morphological and physiological changes, which helped the plants to withstand the excess of Mn in the soil, were also evidenced when they were co-inoculated. Taken together, our results suggest that co-inoculation in M. caesalpiniaefolia regulates toxicity, maximizes early growth, and increases tolerance to excessive Mn in soils degraded by mining.

TI  - Effect of replacement of concentrate feed with Moringa leaves on dietary nutrient utilization in non-descript Chhattisgarh goats
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
AB  - An experiment was conducted to analyse the effect of replacing commercially available concentrate mixture with dried Moringa oleifera leaves on the nutrient utilization pattern of diet in non-descript goat breeds of Chhattisgarh. Eight non-descript yearling goats allotted randomly into 2 groups (group1 and group 2) based on their BW (13.48 & PLUSMN;1.07 kg). Animals in group 1 were offered concentrate @ 1.5% of body weight and hybrid Napier grass ad lib. In the group 2, 50% of concentrate was replaced by Moringa leaves on dry matter basis. Dried leaves were analyzed for their chemical composition. The CP content was 27.52% and Fe and Zn were 125.4 ppm and 29.8 ppm, respectively. There was no significant effect on palatability of feed that was evident from similar DM intake in both the groups. Intake of individual nutrients also did not differ significantly among the groups. There was no effect of moringa leaves inclusion on the nutrient utilization. However significantly higher N retention was observed in Moringa supplemented group compared to commercial concentrate supplemented group. Thus, Moringa supplementation was helpful in reducing the quantity of commercial concentrate mixture inclusion in the diet of non-descript goats.

TI  - Potential application of Latin American silvopastoral systems experiences for improving ruminant farming in Nigeria: a review
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - In a world marked by shifting climate patterns, a growing human population, and rising demand for ruminant-derived protein, producers face the need to implement strategies that enhance productivity, reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), promote adaptability, and improve the sustainability of milk and meat production while optimizing resource use. One promising strategy to address these challenges is the adoption of silvopastoral production systems, which combine livestock with trees and shrubs. These systems are widely used in Latin America due to their proven benefits in terms of production, reduced emission intensity, land utilization efficiency, and other ecosystem services. Transferring technology from one region to another necessitates adapting these techniques to suit the receiving environment. This review suggests that the successful silvopastoral systems employed in the Latin America context can be effectively introduced in Nigeria, offering potential advantages for livestock owners. The research encompassed in this review demonstrates that the utilization of silvopastoral systems in ruminant farming can contribute to achieving several sustainable development goals, including enhancing food security, increasing milk and meat yields, supporting conservation efforts, bolstering biodiversity, and reducing GHG emissions. At the level of individual farms, the adoption of silvopastoral systems (SPS) can enhance the stability and resilience of farmers' livelihoods, boost milk production, facilitate animal growth, and improve animal welfare.

TI  - Intake, nutrient metabolism and balance studies in sheep fed Himalayan Elm (<i>Ulmus wallichiana</i>) leaf meal incorporated total mixed ration
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB  - With the soaring cost and scarcity of concentrate feeds worldwide, use of un-conventional tree foliages in the animal diets can be effective in curtailing the feeding costs to economise livestock production. The present experiment was conducted with the aim to assess incorporation of Himalayan Elm (Ulmus wallichiana) leaf meal (ELM) as partial replacement to conventional concentrate feed mixture (CFM) in total mixed ration (TMR) of sheep. In Experiment-I (in vitro study), the effect of graded increasing levels (0, 10, 20, 30. 40 and 50%) of ELM inclusion as replacement to CFM constituting 40% in the basal TMR on nutrient degradability was assessed. The results revealed the effective level for optimal nutrient degradability at 30% ELM inclusion. In Experiment-II (in vivo study), a feeding trial was conducted for 30 days on sheep (16) distributed equally into two groups, offered basal TMR as control (Cont) and TMR containing ELM replacing CFM at 30% level as treatment group (ELMG), the level selected based on results of optimum nutrient degradability in in vitro assay. Without affecting dry matter and organic matter intakes, ELM included diet enhanced crude protein and neutral detergent fibre digestibility. Moreover, content and the intakes of digestible nutrients were similar between the two groups. with total digestible nutrients intake being 56.66% and 61.88% more than the recommendation in control and ELMG groups, respectively. Animals of both the groups were in positive balances of N, Ca and P, though N balances (g/d) and live weight gain (g/d) were comparable while Ca and P balances (g/d) were higher in ELMG. Cost of production lowered with 35.84% reduction in feed cost per kg live weight gain in ELMG group compared to control. It was concluded that 30% CFM in TMR for sheep could be replaced with ELM safely as a sustainable strategy to alleviate the conventional feed shortage for profitable sheep rearing.

TI  - A Systematic Analysis of Nutritional and Mineral Composition and Toxicity in <i>Acacia</i> Species Leaves
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - In the present study, the nutritive composition and mineral content of the leaves of eight species of Acacia trees were evaluated to assess their potential for different purposes, such as food resources for ruminants and mineral sources in soils. Caco-2 cells were employed to assess cytotoxicity, revealing that the extracts exhibited no cytotoxic effects after cellular incubation, suggesting their suitability as an alternative animal feed. The leaves proved to be a promising source of protein and fiber, offering an alternative to meet the needs of ruminants. The protein content differed among species, ranging from 18.96% in A. cyclops to 14.04% in A. melanoxylon. Similarly, fiber content varied from 35.52% in A. melanoxylon to 16.43% in A. cyclops. The species displayed moderate to high levels of minerals, particularly concentrations of Ca, P, and K. These values varied among species, ranging from 8452.90 to 28,465.31 mg/kg DM for Ca, 309.61 to 1293.82 mg/kg DM for P, and 5557.24 to 11,475.85 mg/kg DM for K, respectively. Each species displayed a distinct profile regarding the analyzed parameters, suggesting varied potential for their respective use. Additionally, vibrational spectroscopy analysis proved to be a highly valuable and dependable method for distinguishing between species.

TI  - Effect of dietary utilization of a mixture of tropical tree foliage leaves on growth performance, nutrient utilization, blood biochemistry, and immune status of goats
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - The global goat population continues to grow, and simultaneously, fodder demand is increasing, despite the fact that feed resources are limited, and thus, new unconventional feed resources should be explored. The present study focuses on the nutrient utilization of ten top feeds viz. Acacia nilotica, Celtis australis, Ficus palmata, Ficus religiosa, Grewia optiva, Melia azadarach, Morus alba, Quercus incana, Salix alba and Zizyphus jujuba. Twelve adult, non-descript local male goats (27.02 +/- 2.93 kg, 14 +/- 2 months old) were randomly assigned to two equal groups. The control group was fed a conventional concentrate mixture (CON), while the treatment group received a leaf meal-based concentrate mixture (LMM). Both groups were provided ad libitum access to wheat straw as forage. The outcome of body weight changes revealed non-significant (P > 0.05) variations between groups. The dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI), and balance of nutrients (viz. calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen) showed non-significant differences (P > 0.05) between groups. The digestibility of all the nutrients were similar between groups. All the blood biochemicals were within normal physiological range without any significant difference (P > 0.05) between dietary treatments. The animals provided with LMM based rations showed better humoral immune response, however, cell-mediated immune (CMI) response was similar (P > 0.05) among both groups. So, it can be concluded that leaf meal mixture can be incorporated up to 15% level in the concentrate mixture of adult goats without affecting their nutrient intake, nutrient digestibility, blood-biochemical profile, and cell-mediated immune response, with better humoral immune response.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of native top feeds of western Himalayas for utilization as goat's ration in mash and block form
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - The current research was undertaken to scrutinize the effect of leaf meal mixture as concentrate mixture in the ration of goats. Leaf meal mixture (LMM) was prepared using equal quantities of ten top-foliages namely Acacia nilotica, Celtis australis, Ficus palmata, Ficus religiosa, Grewia optiva, Melia azadarach, Morus alba, Quercus incana, Salix alba and Zizyphus jujube obtained from district Poonch of Jammu region in western Himalayas. The LMM prepared was substituted for 15% in the concentrate mixture being fed to the goats. The study constituted of two trials. Concentrate mixture offered to the animals was in mash and multi-nutrient block in first and second trial respectively. A total of twelve non-descript, adult male goats were selected for each trial. Goats of 0-14 months age (27.71 +/- 2.96 kg live body weight) of for first trial while goats of 12-16 months age (27.02 +/- 2.93 kg live weight) for second trial were divided into control and treatment groups as per randomized block design and fed ad-lib wheat straw and concentrate mixture @ (20 g/kgW(0.75)). No significant variation was observed (p > 0.05) in body weight, feed and DM intake among all groups in both trials. Comparable intake as well as digestibility of various nutrients like DM, OM, CP, EE, CF, NFE, NDF, ADF and TDN were found between the two groups during individual trials. There was a positive nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balance among all experimental animals in both the trials. Serum enzymes ALT, AST and haemato-biochemical parameters like total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin: globulin and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) showed no significant differences during both trials in all groups, being within normal physiological levels. However, haemoglobin concentration was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in treatment group with respect to the control group in first trial. On the basis of current results, it can be established that leaf meal mixture can successfully be used to replace concentrate mixture up to 15% in the ration of goats without expecting any adverse impacts on their growth and overall health.

TI  - Pyrolysis kinetic, thermodynamic and product analysis of different leguminous biomasses by Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS
AB  - To ascertain the potential of various leguminous biomass such as L. leucocephala, C. proliferus, P. alba and S. sesban, both energetic and a source of high added value products, the pyrolytic behaviour was studied at different heating rates by using the analytical method of thermogravimetric (TG), isoconversional method of Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), determination of some thermodynamic parameters and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). It was concluded that biomass such as L. leucocephala or C. proliferus are more suitable for pyrolysis since less energy is required to degrade them, more evident in the final stages of degradation in which P. alba and S. sesban present very high activation energies calculated by KAS. All leguminous biomass produced volatile compounds with high phenol content at the peak of maximum degradation of hemicellulose, most of the heavy derivates are derived from lignin, such as ferulaldehyde or methoxyeugenol, because sufficient energy has not yet been provided to break down the structure. At this peak it can see some furans and saccharides in the case of C. proliferus since it has a higher C5 content in its composition. A wide range of compounds were detected at the peak of maximum degradation of cellulose, L. leucocephala and C. proliferus produce more short-chain compounds that give rise to bio-oils whereas, S. sesban and especially P. alba, in addition, produce a quantity of high added value of saccharides such as levoglucosan and D-allose (4.73% and 13.94%, respectively).

TI  - Effects of grazing intensity and pasture type on soil organic carbon stock in the semi-arid tropics of India
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES
AB  - Pastures may act as carbon sources and sinks depending on grazing pressure and management practices. Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and its fractions were quantified under 3 different grazing intensities using 5, 10 and 15 sheep/ ha under sown, improved and natural pastures in the semi-arid tropics of India. Results revealed that after 3 years, improved pasture had significantly higher particulate organic carbon (POC-4.5 g/kg), SOC (-0.53 %), total organic carbon (TOC-7 g/kg) and SOC stock (-15 mg/ha) as compared with sown and natural pastures. Labile carbon (LC -185 mg/kg) and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC -378 mu g/g soil) were higher under natural pasture. A moderate grazing intensity of 10 sheep/ha resulted in significantly greater carbon fractions, TOC and SOC stock. SOC stock and its fractions were significantly higher in the topsoil layers as compared with the subsoil layers. These results indicate that improved pasture management practices with moderate grazing intensity can be recommended for improving SOC stock and its fractions in semi-arid tropical pastures.

TI  - Effect of dietary inclusions of different types of<i> Acacia</i><i> mearnsii</i> on milk performance and nutrient intake of dairy cows
T2  - VETERINARY AND ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB  - This study investigated the effects of including different types of Acacia mearnsii (tannin extract and forage) on nutrient intake and milk performance in dairy cattle. Holstein-Friesian x Jersey dairy cows (n per Experiment = 24) that had 200 days in milk were selected for this study in a completely randomized study design. This study was conducted under on-farm conditions at Springfontein dairy farm, a farm that lacked a functional bodyweight scale to measure the cow bodyweight and a computer system to register cow parity. Cows were assigned Acacia mearnsii tannin extract (ATE) pellets which were added with 0 (0ATE), 0.75 (0.75ATE), 1.5 (1.5ATE) or 3 (3ATE) % ATE in pellets while 0ATE was a commercial protein concentrate (Experiment 1). Cows were assigned Acacia mearnsii forage (AMF) at a rate of 0 (0AMF), 5 (5AMF), 15 (15AMF) or 25 (25AMF) % AMF inclusion in corn silage-based diet (Experiment 2). For both Experiments, treatments had six cows each, in which they were adapted (14 d) to diets before data collection (21 d). All AMF inclusions decreased (P<0.0001) dry matter intake (DMI), crude protein intake (CPI), neutral detergent fibre intake (NDFI), acid detergent fibre intake (ADFI) and organic matter intake (OMI) at 25AMF. Linear (P<0.0001) and quadratic (P<0.001) effects were observed on DMI, CPI, NDFI, ADFI and OMI. Inclusions of AMF in corn silage diets affected milk yield, protein yield, lactose yield and milk protein percentage (P<0.001). Linear effect was present in milk yield per DMI (P<0.0001). In conclusion, the dairy cow diet supplemented with ATE pellets did not have a beneficial effect on the nutrient intakes and milk yield. However, the AMF supplemented in corn silage of the dairy cow diet, increased milk production due to positive effects on nutrient intake, which was favourably influenced from a nutritional point of view.

TI  - Preparation, Optimization, and Characterization of Biochar Using Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) Sludge of a Wastepaper Based Paper Mill
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING-INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH EDITION
AB  - This paper reports the preparation of biochar from sludge generated in a wastepaper-based paper mill operating on the Zero liquid discharge principles. Biochar has been prepared from sludge, hereafter referred to as Zero liquid discharge sludge, in a laboratory muffle furnace using the slow pyrolysis method. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and pyrolysis time on biochar' yield, surface area, and pore volume of biochar has been studied by applying response surface methodology. The pyrolysis temperature and pyrolysis time were maintained in the range 450-750 degrees C and 100-200 min. respectively, under the central composite design. It was found that temperature and time significantly impacted the biochar's yield, surface area, and pore volume of biochar showing strong linear, quadratic, and interaction effects. ANOVA of the empirical models developed in this study was found to be efficient with high R-predicted(2), (R-adjusted(2) - R-predicted(2)) < 0.2, adequate precision > 4, and non-significant lack of fit value. The optimum pyrolysis temperature and pyrolysis time were determined to be 539.65 degrees C and 176.67 min correspondingly having desirability value 0.651. The optimized values of biochar's yield, surface area, and pore volume for Zero liquid discharge sludge biochar were found to be 63.95%, 40.23 m(2)/g, and 0.048 cm(3)/g respectively. The physicochemical (proximate and CHNS) and instrumental (XRD, TGA, DSC, FT-IR, and SEM) analyses along with their comparison with other biochar reported in the literature confirmed the use of this biochar as an adsorbent in wastewater treatment.

TI  - Towards transdisciplinary identification of suitable woody perennials for resilient agro-silvopastoral systems in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Parkland systems in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa are commonly perceived as a resilient agroforestry practice well adapted to the semi-arid climatic conditions of the region. However, there exist several knowledge gaps regarding the interplay between the different components of this agro-silvopastoral land use system. A literature review with subsequent meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the effects of woody perennials on soil, crops and livestock, for which our study found very context-specific responses. A scoring of tree and shrub species indicated a general trend of trade-off between positive impact on crops and livestock vs. impact on soil organic carbon content. The study further confirmed that Faidherbia albida (Del.) Chev. is one of the most promising parkland species, but also revealed that there are no multipurpose single species that should be promoted exclusively. The focus should rather shift to species mixtures that satisfy multiple human and environmental needs. The study also pointed out that information on the nutritional properties of the majority of browse species is particularly limited. Transdisciplinary modelling is suggested as a tool to assess the complex interactions between the different components that shape this agro-silvopastoral system at different scales.

TI  - <i>Mucuna pruriens </i>, <i>Crotalaria juncea</i>, and chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>) have the potential for improving productivity of banana-based systems in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - LEGUME SCIENCE
AB  - Intercropping banana and shorter annual crops in small holder systems is inevitable despite shade being a limitation. Current production is also limited to the wet seasons. Strategies to exploit the spaces under banana shade and drier seasons are crucial for optimal production of these systems. We determined the performance of two legume cover crops, Mucuna pruriens and Crotalaria juncea, and chickpea (Cicer arietinum), a grain legume, under different banana shade levels and over the wet and dry seasons in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Banana and legume monocrops served as controls. Shade reduced weed biomass and legume root nodulation, biomass, and grain yields. Chickpea root nodulation had a lower sensitivity to shade (3-9% reduction) compared with mucuna (30-60%) and crotalaria (31-71%). Legume biomass yield declines varied from 37-83%, 56-93%, and 80-98% for mucuna, crotalaria, and chickpea, respectively. Higher nodulation occurred in the rainy compared with the dry season. Biomass yield declines, albeit low occurred in the dry season for mucuna (15%) and crotalaria (30%). In contrast, chickpea biomass and grain yields increased by 394% and 4487%, respectively, in the dry season. A higher banana vegetative growth occurred in the intercropped plots. Land equivalent ratios of 1.15-1.34 under dense shading for mucuna and crotalaria and 1.10-1.62 for chickpea occurred irrespective of the seasons. These findings suggest that these cover crops and chickpea could be exploited to enhance biomass (for fodder, mulch, or manure) and grain yields under banana shade and over the drier seasons.

TI  - <i>Acanthoscelides atrocephalus</i> (Pic, 1938) and Its Potential for Biological Control of Two Weed Species
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - In order to replace chemical herbicides, which harm the environment and health, we seek sustainable methods to control weeds. We remove a seed-beetle species, Acanthoscelides atrocephalus, from synonymy with Acanthoscelides modestus and recognize it as a potential bioagent for Aeschynomene denticulata and A. indica. Belonging the megacornis group of the genus Acanthoscelides, its fine morphology was analyzed using high-resolution photography and scanning electron microscopy. The species differs from others of the A. megacornis group based on integument coloration, distinctive patterns of vestiture on the pronotum and pygidium, large and sexually dimorphic eyes, a strong frontal carina extending from the vertex of the head to the clypeus, and distinctive armature in the internal sac of the male genitalia. It stands out as a biological control agent due to the larvae's habit of feeding on seeds, which hinders the development of the embryo. Through tetrazolium and germination tests, it was discovered that 100% of the infested seeds had no viable seed integument and did not germinate. A. atrocephalus is no longer a synonym of Acanthoscelides modestus. This species is a predator of A. denticulata and A. indica and prevents seed germination, becoming promising as a bioagent for the control of these weeds.

TI  - Predicting ecosystem changes by a new model of ecosystem evolution
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - In recent years, computer simulation has been increasingly used to predict changes in actual ecosystems. In these studies, snapshots of ecosystems at certain points in time were instantly constructed without considering their evolutionary histories. However, it may not be possible to correctly predict future events unless their evolutionary processes are considered. In this study, we developed a new ecosystem model for reproducing the evolutionary process on an oceanic island, targeting Nakoudojima Island of the Ogasawara Islands. This model successfully reproduced the primitive ecosystem (the entire island covered with forest) prior to the invasion of alien species. Also, by adding multiple alien species to this ecosystem, we were able to reproduce temporal changes in the ecosystem of Nakoudojima Island after invasion of alien species. Then, we performed simulations in which feral goats were eradicated, as had actually been done on the island; these suggested that after the eradication of feral goats, forests were unlikely to be restored. In the ecosystems in which forests were not restored, arboreous plants with a high growth rate colonized during the early stage of evolution. As arboreous plants with a high growth rate consume a large amount of nutrient in soil, creating an oligotrophic state. As a result, plants cannot grow, and animal species that rely on plants cannot maintain their biomass. Consequently, many animals and plants become extinct as they cannot endure disturbances by alien species, and the ecosystem loses its resilience. Therefore, even if feral goats are eradicated, forests are not restored. Thus, the founder effect from the distant past influences future ecosystem changes. Our findings show that it is useful to consider the evolutionary process of an ecosystem in predicting its future events.

TI  - Effect of exogenous application of L-mimosine on physiological, cytogenetic, biochemical and anatomical characteristics of Allium cepa L
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Mimosine [beta-(3-hydroxy-4-pyridone-1-yl)-l-alanine] is a toxic non- protein amino acid, and one of its major effects is to suppress plant growth and development. Since mimosine is a compound responsible for many interesting biological activities, intensive studies have begun to be carried out on it in recent years. The current work investigated toxic effects of exogenously given 1, 2 and 3 mM l-mimosine doses on some physiological, cytogenetic, biochemical, and anatomical parameters of Allium cepa L. bulbs. For this purpose, the germination percentage (GP), root length (RL), root number (RN), and fresh weight (FW) were determinated as physiological parameters to be examined experimentally; the micronucleus (MN) frequency, chromosomal aberrations (CAs), and mitotic index (MI) were chosen as cytogenetic parameters; and the catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and free proline (PR) content were determinated as biochemical parameters to be investigated. In addition, the changes in the root anatomical structure of the bulbs were examined under the microscope by taking cross-sections. Onion bulbs were divided into four groups as three treatments and one control (C). For seven days, the bulbs in the treatment groups were germinated with three different doses of l-mimosine (1, 2 and 3 mM), while the bulbs in the C group were germinated with tap water. Consequently, all three doses of l-mimosine caused a decrease (p < 0.05) in all investigated physiological parameter (GP, RL, RN and FW) values compared to C. Furthermore, every l-mimosine dosage resulted in a reduce (p < 0.05) in MI and an increase (p < 0.05) in MN and CA frequency compared to C group. l-mimosine application promoted CAs such as irregular mitosis, stick chromosome, lagging chromosome, protruded out chromosome, pole deviation and alignment in root meristem cells. Exposure to l-mimosine resulted in dose-related increases (p < 0.05) in SOD and CAT enzyme activity as well as MDA and PR levels compared to C group, indicating that l-mimosine also induced toxicity by causing oxidative stress in cells. Also, especially exposure to a dose of 3 mM l-mimosine caused the anatomical damages such as deformations of the epidermis and cortex cells, necrosis, buildup of certain chemical compounds in the cortex cells, thickening of the cortex cell wall, formation of vacuoles in the cell nuclei and flattened cell nuclei in the root tip meristem cells. In summary, since l-mimosine showed an inhibitory effect in the Allium cepa L. test material, it was concluded that the compound induced multi-dimensional toxicity, and the Allium test proved to be a highly valuable tool in identifying this toxicity.

TI  - Magnetic biochar based on furfural residue as an excellent candidate for efficient adsorption of Tetracycline, Bisphenol A, Congo red, and Cr<SUP>6+</SUP>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Magnetic porous adsorbent materials are widely favored for their large specific surface area, good adsorption performance, and ease of separation. This work provided a magnetic biochar derived from furfural residue (M-FRAC) with excellent adsorption properties for various pollutants, including Congo red (CR), Tetracycline (TC), Bisphenol A (BPA), and Cr6+. The influence of experimental parameters, such as pollutant concentration, contact time, and pH, on the adsorption properties of M-FRAC was studied in detail. The adsorption process was highly dependent on pH and initial contaminant concentration. All pollutant adsorption was favorable under acidic conditions. The optimal pH of the CR, TC, and Cr6+ adsorption was 5, 4, and 2, respectively, while that of BPA was in the range of 2-5. The experimental equilibrium adsorption amount of CR, TC, BPA, and Cr6+ by M-FRAC was 110.89, 602.81, 157.76, and 265.31 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption processes of pollutants on M-FRAC were in accordance with the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption kinetics fitted the pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetics model. In addition, M-FRAC could be readily separated from solution by applying an external magnetic field. Therefore, the M-FRAC has a good application prospect in practical industrial wastewater treatment.

TI  - Traditional knowledge on Livestock poisonous plants of District Bajaur, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan.
T2  - BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH
AB  - Poisonous plants comprise the third largest category of poisons known around the world. They are the major cause of economic losses in the livestock industry since the advent of civilization. Aim of the present study was to collect and systematically document the traditional knowledge of poisonous plants of Bajaur District for the benefit of humanity before it is entombed forever. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews from the community members and local herbalists. The reported plants were collected post interviews and later on pressed on herbarium vouchers for reference. Afterwards, the data was analyzed through Use value (UV) and Informant consensus factors (Fic) A total of 66 toxic plants were listed from the study site. Most dominant toxic families were Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Solanaceae, Apocynaceae and Euphorbiaceae. Most of the poisonous plants were herbs (53.03%), shrub (28.78%) and tree (18.18%) and the leaves toxicity was reported to be the highest (21.88%). And the whole plant toxicity was the highest (18.75%), followed by seed toxicity (14.58%), According to the factor informant consensus; gastrointestinal category had the greatest agreement closely followed by the death category. The most important species on the basis of fidelity level for the death category are Nerium oleander L, Ricinus communis L., Euphorbia helioscopia L., Narcissus tazetta L. In the dermatological category, the most important species were Calotropis procera (Aiton) W.T.Aiton, Datura stramonium L., Erigeron canadensis L., Datura stramonium L., and Solanum incanum L. The most important species of fever category were Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn, Tulipa clusiana Redoute, Similarly the valuable species for the category Gastrointestinal disorders were Ricinus an important contribution towards the preservation of indigenous toxic plants' based knowledge. Hence, this is an opportunity to investigate such plants pharmacologically and toxicologically studies are required to ascertain the toxic components of the poisonous plants, so that they may be utilized for the betterment of future generations.

TI  - Phytochemical profile and in vitro evaluation of cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz) foliage as ruminant feed with/without green banana flour
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a crucial crop in tropics and subtropics, primarily cultivated for its tuber. However, its foliage is rich in protein and can supply essential elements for ruminants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the phytochemical compounds by Gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS) and the main phenolic by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) present in cassava foliage, along with the fermentation pattern using a semi-automated gas production (GP) system. The in vitro evaluation was carried out for four diets formulated as follows: T1 (alfalfa: grass hay at ratio of 30: 70); T2 (alfalfa: grass hay: banana flour 30:60:10); T3 and T4 (replaced alfalfa in T1 and T2 with cassava foliage, respectively). The addition of green banana flour aimed to increase the diets' energy. The GC-MS results indicated that cassava foliage showed a large number of valuable bioactive components, with the biflavonoid isoginkgetin representing the major component at 25.33% of total peak area percentage. The HPLC analysis declared that rutin, gallic acid, and ferulic acid were the main phenolic compounds presented in cassava foliage ethanolic extract. The accumulative gas after 24 h of incubation was significantly lower with cassava diets compared to alfalfa diets, being 119.3 versus 130.1 ml/g DM, respectively. The degradation of both organic matter and neutral detergent fiber was significantly higher with alfalfa compared to cassava diets, while there was no significant difference between alfalfa and cassava diets on final pH, ammonia concentration and protozoal count. Banana flour inclusion, regardless of the forage type, decreased the accumulative gas after 24 h of incubation with about 9% compared with no banana addition. The use of cassava foliage in ruminant diets considered a promising protein source with valuable bioactive components that could have a positive effect on animal health and production.

TI  - The state of knowledge of freshwater resources in the US Virgin Islands: Data scarcity and implications
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
AB  - Like many small island communities, the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), an unincorporated territory of the U.S., is naturally freshwater scarce. In recent decades, rapid land development in the USVI has increased water demand considerably, exerting extra pressure on freshwater resources. Freshwater quantity and quality data for the USVI are very scarce and scattered, which limits freshwater management capabilities. We draw attention to this information deficit and discuss its implications by reviewing the current state of knowledge of surface and groundwater quantity and quality for the USVI. Our review confirms that long-term records of surface and groundwater quantity and quality are limited and unreliable. For example, streamflow was most recently monitored in 2006, and the most extensive surface water quality records are from the 1960s and 1980s. Since 2016, mean groundwater levels have been recorded daily, but only for three wells (one on each island of the USVI). Importantly, this lack of information threatens water security for the territory and limits our understanding of how development has impacted water quality and availability over time. This could be addressed using models, such as a groundwater recharge model, in combination with remote sensing and updated field data (i.e., streamflow, groundwater, and ecohydrological characterizations of land use change).

TI  - Intensive Silvopastoral Systems Mitigate Enteric Methane Emissions from Cattle
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
AB  - Assessments of the efficiency of grazing systems, in terms of productivity and ecological sustainability, are necessary in view of the increased demand for animal protein. In this study, the methane (CH4) emissions (sniffer methodology), dry matter (DM) yield, paddock chemical composition (AOAC and Van Soest methods), nutrient intake (dry matter, DMI; crude protein, CPI; metabolizable energy, MEI), daily milk yield (DMY), body condition score (BCS), and body weight (BW) of cattle, in intensive silvopastoral systems (ISPSs) and monoculture systems (MSs), in the tropics of Mexico were evaluated. In the ISPS, CH4 emissions (18% less) and DMY were lower than in the MS. Cows from MSs tend to disperse across higher values of CH4 emissions per kg of DMI, as well as higher milk production, while cows from the ISPS were dispersed over a higher intake (DMI, CPI, and MEI) and lower CH4 emissions. There were no differences between systems in paddock DM yield, chemical composition, cows' BCS, and BW, regardless of whether it was the dry (April to May) and rainy (September to October) season. Based on the results obtained in this study, ISPSs contribute to the mitigation of methane emissions in cattle; forage and animal production variables in both systems were similar, with a lower use of imported inputs in the ISPS.

TI  - Evaluation of minerals, trace elements, and antinutritional factors in selected legume fodder species (Fabaceae) with the potential to improve cattle nutrition and gastrointestinal health
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - The study aimed to investigate the nutritional composition, trace elements and anti-nutritional factors of fodder species belonging to the family Fabaceae potentially used as an alternative feed for cattle. The proximate composition, particularly dry matter, moisture, fats, crude proteins (CP), carbohydrates, crude fibre (CF), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF), were analysed, thereby, nonfibre carbohydrate (NFC) and gross energy (GE) were calculated. Thirty-three trace elements were determined from chemically digested dried plant material using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) and ICP-OES (ICP-Optical Emission Spectrophotometry). The tannin levels, a known antinutritional factor, were estimated using Folin-Ciocalteu method. The methods were validated by the relative standard deviation (RSD) values and acceptable recovery percentage, linearity, limit of quantification (LoQ), and limit of detection (LoD). The proximate composition analysis estimated levels of dry matter (> 90 %), ash (3.77-26.98 %), crude proteins (8.22-22.19 %), carbohydrates (54.00-86.79 %), crude fibre (10.54-40.10 %), NDF (22.26-59.20 %) and GE (< 100 Kcal kg(-1) DM) in leguminous species. Essential elements were detected in recommended levels including Zn (21.20-50.30 mg/kg), Co (0.06-0.045 mg kg), Cr (0.5-5.08 mg kg(-1)), Mn (9.02-197 mg kg(-1)), Mg (0.10-0.52 mg kg(-1)), Fe (42.40-812 mg kg(-1)) and Na (72.00-1721 mg kg(-1)). The concentration of toxic elements was below critical levels and tannin occurred at a safe level (< 50 mgTAE kg(-1)) for ruminant consumption. Therefore, the selected fodder can effectively contribute to cattle dietary requirements for smallscale farmers in Onderstepoort, Gauteng Province, South Africa.

TI  - A scientometrics analysis of silvopastoral systems: what we know and what we need to know?
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) are a sustainable alternative to reduce livestock environmental impacts and restore degraded pastures due to their higher diversity, increased forage production and quality, enhanced soil quality, and C storage. Legume-based silvopastoral systems also contribute through biological nitrogen fixation by the legume component. In this study we evaluate the scientific production on the Web of Science database from 2010 to 2022, with a two-step process. First the keywords "silvopastoral systems" were used for an initial analysis of the overall literature, followed by "legume" or "enzym*" or "microbial communit*, yielding more than 870 papers. The number of publications grew exponentially during the period evaluated, and between 2019 and 2022, approximately 63% of all publications occurred. Brazil had the largest number of published articles, followed by Mexico, USA, Spain, and Colombia. There was also a network of collaborations between institutions in these countries. Agriculture is the research area with the most published articles, with the most studied topics being management, biodiversity, and nutrient dynamics and cycling, especially carbon and nitrogen. However, only nine of these studied the soil microbial community and five, the soil enzymatic activity. Although these previous studies have observed the effect of SPS on important soil indicators, how SPS is used as a restoration tool to affect the microbial biomass and activity of extracellular enzymes remains poorly understood and is important to validate the regeneration strategies. Thus, this article analyzes the evolution of publications on this agroecosystem to advance the knowledge and sustainability in those segments that are still little studied, such as the microbial community and soil enzymatic activity.

TI  - Supplementation of a tropical low-quality forage with <i>Calliandra calothyrsus</i> improves sheep health and performance, and reduces methane emission
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB  - Ruminant production systems in the arid and semi-arid regions of Sub-Saharan Africa confront severe challenges due to recurring droughts and the intensifying effects of climate change (CC). These systems grapple with numerous stress factors, including poor animal nutrition, water scarcity, gastrointestinal (GIT) parasite burdens, and heat stress, which contribute to below optimal animal productivity and a high environmental footprint. Addressing these issues urgently, by creating livestock systems resilient to CC that also promote better animal health, enhanced productivity, and reduced environmental impact, is paramount to safeguarding the livelihoods of the rural population. This 50-day study aimed to evaluate the effects of improved feeding and nutritional management in sheep, focusing on GIT parasite infections, feed intake and digestibility, liveweight (LW) gain, and enteric methane (CH4) emissions. We investigated the legume forage tree, Calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus), as a high-quality feed source because of its rich crude protein content and its potential as a remedy for gastrointestinal tract (GIT) parasite infections, attributed to its high condensed tannin (CT) content. Twenty-eight Dorper lambs underwent random allocation across four treatments, each consisting of seven lambs. These treatments combined either a trickle infection or no infection with Haemonchus contortus with a supplementation (40% of diet on a dry matter basis or lack thereof) of the basal diet (Rhodes grass hay) with dried Calliandra leaflets. The treatments were: UnHay (uninfected, fed on hay-only), InHay (infected, fed on hay-only), InHay+Cal (infected, fed on hay plus Calliandra), and InHay+Cal+PEG [infected, fed on hay, Calliandra, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)]. The latter was to evaluate the potential effects of Calliandra's condensed tannins. The results show that lambs in the InHay+Cal treatment exhibited a higher packed cell volume (PCV) and lower faecal egg counts (FEC) compared to the InHay group. No effects of infection on the other measured variables were observed in unsupplemented lambs. Calliandra supplementation increased total feed dry matter intake (DMI) by 20% (61.8 vs. 51.7 g DM/kg LW0.75) (InHay+Cal vs. InHay) and enhanced LW gain (7.2 g/d) in the InHay+Cal group, whereas the unsupplemented infected group (InHay) experienced LW loss (-26.6 g/d). Calliandra supplementation to infected lambs reduced daily CH4 emission by 15% (13.9 vs. 16.2 g/d) and CH4 yield (g/kg DMI) by 30% (18.7 vs. 26.5 g/kg DMI), compared to emissions from unsupplemented infected lambs. Nonetheless, Calliandra supplementation decreased the digestibility of crude protein and fibre and raised the faecal nitrogen (N) output to N intake (FN/NI) ratio. The effects of PEG supplementation on CT activity remained inconclusive. The study concludes that a 40% replacement of a protein-deficient basal diet with Calliandra may be excessive. However, the findings underscore the considerable advantages of integrating Calliandra into farming systems. Such nature-based solution control GIT parasite infections and their lifecycle, bolster the nutritional value of a deficient basal diet, improve animal productivity cost-effectively, and mitigate enteric methane emissions both in absolute terms and intensity.

TI  - Effect of <i>Acacia mearnsii</i> forage or tannin extract on rumen dry matter and crude protein degradation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION
AB  - This study investigated rumen degradation kinetics of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) in compound feed with different tannin extract inclusions and Acacia mearnsi forage (AMF) relative to dairy feeds (perennial ryegrass+white clover mixture pasture, maize silage, lucerne hay and Themeda triandra hay). The compound feed had 0.75%, 1.5% and 3% tannins extract inclusions while the control was a commercial compound feed. Triplicates of each feed per incubation period were incubated in two fistulated Jersey cows for 0, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h, resulting in six replicates per feed. Tannin extract inclusions in compound feed only affected (p < 0.05) the (a) fraction, degradation rate and potential degradability (PD) for DM degradation, and affected (p < 0.05) the (a) and (b) fractions, as well as PD for CP degradation. The (a) fraction and degradation rate for DM degradation changed linearly (p < 0.05). The (a) fraction, PD and effective degradability (ED) of DM degradation changed quadratically (p < 0.05). Except for the degradation rate, the feed type affected (p < 0.05) the degradation parameters in both DM and CP degradations. For DM and CP degradations, (a) fraction was similarly the least in Themeda triandra hay and AMF but similarly the highest in maize silage, perennial ryegrass+white clover mixture pasture and lucerne hay. The (b) fraction was the least in AMF for both DM and CP degradations but the highest for pasture's DM degradation and similarly the highest in maize silage, lucerne hay and T. triandra hay for CP degradation. The PD was the least in AMF for both DM and CP degradations and similarly the highest in pasture DM but similarly the highest in perennial ryegrass+white clover mixture pasture, maize silage and lucerne hay for CP degradation. Furthermore, the ED was the lowest in AMF and the highest for perrenial ryegrass + white clover mixture pasture for DM degradation and same trend was observed for CP degradation whereby perrenial ryegrass + white clover mixture pasture, maize silage and lucerne had the highest ED. Digestible undegraded protein was the highest in AMF and similarly the least in dairy feeds. Tannin source inclusion in ruminant diets should be moderate to prevent rumen DM or CP degradation limitation.

TI  - Plant proteins, peptides, and non-protein amino acids: Toxicity, sources, and analysis
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Plants have evolved various mechanisms to synthesize diverse range of substances that contribute to their survival against pests, pathogens, predators, and adverse environmental conditions. Although several plant metabolites possess therapeutic potential, some can be potentially harmful to human and animal health when consumed in large proportion. Proteins, peptides, and nonprotein amino acids are products of plant biochemical pathways with proven beneficial and nutritional effects. Despite these benefits, the in vivo toxicities associated with certain plantderived proteins, peptides, and non-protein amino acids pose a significant risk to humans and animals. Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair and weight loss, goiter, cataracts, and infertility. Even though plant processing methods such as soaking and drying can reduce the amount of toxin contained in plants, complete riddance is often impossible. As such, food regulatory bodies need to prevent uncontrolled consumption of the listed and many other toxin-containing plant species to keep the public safe. For this purpose, this review collates crucial insights into the sources, and in vivo toxicity associated with certain plant-derived proteins, peptides, and non-protein amino acids that have the clear potential to adversely affect human health. Additionally, this review provides information on analytical methods suitable for the detection of these substances in plants.

TI  - Ruminant contribution to enteric methane emissions and possible mitigation strategies in the Southern Africa Development Community region
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - The Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region is not a major emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG). However, Sub-Saharan Africa is considered a potential future hotspot for GHG emissions because of its large livestock population dispersed across large arid lands, coupled with the inherent low digestible feeds in the region and consequently low productivity of livestock. In SADC, climate change is predicted to increase temperatures further reducing agricultural productivity. Therefore, there is incentive to reduce agriculture's contribution to GHG emissions in the SADC region. Ruminant production, a mainstay of rural economy, is predicted to decrease because of diminished grazing due to reduced rainfall and feed quality. However, ruminants' enteric methane (CH4) production contributes to GHG emissions. This review explores strategies for the SADC region to reduce CH4 by ruminants. As methanogenesis is an outcome of microbial activity, potential opportunities include selecting animals with inherent low CH4 production; altering ruminal microbial populations to those that do not yield CH4; enhancing feed digestibility by feeding additives which improve diet quality and alter the ruminal microbiome and using specific forages such as seaweed or duckweed that contain plant secondary metabolites that may decrease methanogen populations or methanogenesis. These strategies are considered in terms of their potential magnitude of CH4 mitigation, the practicality for their implementation in the SADC region and their suitability to be included in the grazing-based livestock industries in the SADC region.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration associated with Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forestry (ICLF) systems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS
AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the Agriculture, Forest, and Other Land Use sector account for 23% of net global anthropogenic emissions. However, effective conservation agriculture practices can sequester carbon (C) up to 1 m in soil depth and vegetation biomass. Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forestry (ICLF) systems attempt to ensure sustainable agricultural production by combining various agricultural, livestock, and forestry production systems. This bibliographic review aims to present and discuss ICLF systems and their advantages and disadvantages compared with conventional systems, achieving a better understanding of the sources and sinks of GHGs (CH4, N2O, and CO2). Integrated systems exist in tropical and temperate climates with different practices, arrangements, designs, and modalities. Intercropping species with different root structures provides more ecological interactions that enhance biodiversity, soil quality, and C sequestration while reducing GHG emissions. Yet, ICLF systems are complex and require technical assistance and support for being implemented, besides an extensive initial investment that increases the cost of operation. A relevant carbon sink in ICLF systems is carbon from tree biomass, where the wood can be used for various purposes. Timber for sawmills and general construction has a longer C immobilization time. Methane from enteric fermentation is the greatest contributor to GHG emissions in livestock and ICLF systems. Nitrous oxide is released primarily from synthetic fertilizers (when applied), manure deposited on pastures, and the decomposition of plant residues. Carbon dioxide is emitted to a lesser extent from the application of lime and urea. Many studies do not include all compartments in the C balance and often focus on only one GHG or compartment of C. Accordingly, more studies on the sources and sinks of C and their potential to offset GHG emissions in terms of CO2 equivalent are urged.

TI  - An overview of alternative protein sources for ruminants in the tropical area
T2  - ANNALS OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB  - Investigating alternative protein sources for ruminants in tropical regions is crucial due to distinct climatic conditions and limited resources. Scientists, acknowledging the challenges, are exploring locally accessible alternatives to develop cost-effective and sustainable protein supplements for ruminant nutrition, emphasizing the importance of understanding the nutritional composition for advancing livestock husbandry sustainability. The aim of this research is to elucidate alternative local protein sources for ruminants in tropical areas and assess their effectiveness in promoting sustainable production and enhancing ruminant nutrition. Protein feed sources are essential for providing amino acids to animals and producing animal products such as meat, milk, and wool. Inadequate protein in animal feed may have a detrimental impact on rumen fermentation and animal output. Therefore, alternative protein sources have received increased attention in order to replace the main protein source. The alternative protein sources in this review were divided into five categories: agricultural biomass, fodder shrubs, biological protein and plant weeds, insect protein and agro-industry biomass. Furthermore, plant secondary compounds found in alternative protein sources might be used to modulate rumen fermentation and improve animal performance. By focusing on regional sources of protein, feed costs are reduced while availability is raised. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that there are a number of alternative protein sources that might be used in place of primary protein sources and that they could support ruminant production in the face of several animal feed crises. However, the potential use of any protein source should be assessed in light of the country's availability and animal production practices.

TI  - Medicinal Importance and Phytoconstituents of Underutilized Legumes from the Caesalpinioideae DC Subfamily
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Underutilized legumes are common crops in developing countries with superior dietary potentials that could be useful sources of protein as well as some phytoconstituents. They are more tolerant of abiotic environmental conditions like drought than the major legumes. This makes them more adapted to harsh soil and climatic conditions, which helps to minimize the pressure brought on by climate change. However, despite their potential, underutilized legumes have been greatly overlooked compared to the major legumes due to supply constraints. Underutilized legumes in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae are better suited for use as animal feeds with little or no value as food for humans, and the extracts and infusions of the different parts of plant species in this subfamily are traditionally used for the treatment of different diseases. In addition, underutilized legumes in this subfamily contain phytoconstituents that are of pharmacological relevance, some of which have been isolated, characterized and evaluated for use in the treatment of a variety of disorders. Therefore, this review describes the medicinal activities of some selected underutilized legumes from five genera in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae as well as their phytoconstituents, which could be exploited as lead compounds for drug discovery.

TI  - Agroforestry's contribution to livelihoods and carbon sequestration in East Africa: A systematic review
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Agroforestry is a powerful practice for sustainable and regenerative intensification because it promotes multifunctional landscapes that deliver ecological functions that contribute to livelihoods, land productivity, biodiversity conservation, and other ecosystem services. Despite a large body of literature on agroforestry in East Africa, a systematic understanding of its livelihood benefits and contribution to carbon sequestration is still lacking. A systematic review was used to provide a quantitative and qualitative synthesis of available evidence and knowledge gap from 185 publications that met the selection criteria regarding the contribution of agroforestry to livelihoods (n = 152) and carbon sequestration (n = 43) in East Africa. The main livelihood benefits include fodder, food, firewood and income, reported in over 70, 63, 56 and 40 publications, respectively. These and other benefits diversify livelihoods of rural communities and act as safety nets in times of climate shocks. Agroforestry systems in East Africa stock an average of 24.2 +/- 2.8 Mg C ha-1 in biomass and 98.8 +/- 12.2 Mg C ha-1 in the soil. Much of the aboveground carbon is held in homegardens (34.3 +/- 7.9 Mg C ha-1), perennial treecrop systems (29.9 +/- 12.7 Mg C ha-1) and trees on boundaries (26.7 +/- 14.1 Mg C ha-1). Empirical studies are needed for better understanding of belowground carbon in agroforestry and emission of greenhouse gases in different agroforestry practices. A smaller number of studies reported income from sale of carbon credits, suggesting a gap in the development of science regarding carbon rights, land tenure, tree tenure rights, and the potential impact of climate change on the growing niches of tree species in the region. The results show that agroforestry is a powerful climate adaptation and mitigation solution as it can increase household resilience and sequesters significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

TI  - Meta-analysis of the relationship between dietary condensed tannins and methane emissions by cattle
T2  - ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Using condensed tannins (CT) in ruminant nutrition yields many benefits, especially regarding better dietary protein utilization and decreased methane (CH4) emission by altering ruminal fermentation kinetics. A meta-analysis was conducted to develop and analyze a database from published studies and verify the effects of CT inclusion on enteric CH4 emission by cattle, nutrient digestibility and ruminal parameters, and their interactions. The study aimed to develop regression equations based on the significant components and their interactions to target a spe-cific ruminal CH4 mitigation when correctly associating CT inclusion level and diet composition. A database was developed from 40 published studies that measured cattle CH4 emission using in vitro or in vivo methods and reported the source and inclusion levels of CT as well as typical diet characteristics, including crude protein (CP), organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and ether extract (EE). Other related parameters were also included in the database when re-ported, such as dry matter intake (DMI) and digestibility, OM digestibility, NDF digestibility, and ruminal parameters, including pH, ruminal ammonia nitrogen, total volatile fatty acids (VFA), acetate, propionate, butyrate, and the acetate-to-propionate ratio. The meta-analysis was con-ducted by multiple linear regression, using the nlme package of R 4.2.1, in which studies were assumed as random variables affecting the intercept and slopes. The CH4 emission, expressed in L/kg of DMI, decreased with increasing levels of dietary CT when in vitro and in vivo were analyzed together (P < 0.001) or in vivo alone (P < 0.001). Total VFA concentration (P = 0.049), propionate (P = 0.042), and butyrate (P = 0.047) increased with increasing levels of dietary CT on in vitro + in vivo methods, suggesting improved fermentability. When analyzing all chemical components of the diet, OM (P = 0.043) and CP (P = 0.010) decreased CH4 production with in vitro methods, EE decreased CH4 production on in vivo method (P = 0.001), while dietary NDF increased CH4 production on in vitro + in vivo (P = 0.016), and also separately for in vivo (P = 0.058) and in vitro method (P = 0.022). There was an interaction between CT and CP for in vivo experiments (P = 0.010): CH4 = 35.64 - 6.87 xCT - 0.49 xCP + 0.33 xCT*CP. Across many experiments, increasing the level of dietary CT led to a decrease in ruminal CH4 concentrations for in vitro and in vivo fermentation conditions and an increase in molar proportions of propionate, butyrate, and total VFA, indicating that it is an efficient natural alternative to reduce environ-mental impacts of ruminant production systems possibly. Our meta-analysis identified diet components that significantly affect enteric CH4 emissions by cattle and developed a prediction model based on these components, including OM, CP, NDF, and EE. The in vivo CH4 method showed that an interaction between CT and CP diet content affects CH4 emissions. Future research and meta-analysis must focus on CT biological activity along with percent content to dictate ideal diet inclusion to suppress CH4 emissions without depressing animal performance.

TI  - Consumption of Purple Neem Foliage Rich in Anthocyanins Improves Rumen Fermentation, Growth Performance and Plasma Antioxidant Activity in Growing Goats
T2  - FERMENTATION-BASEL
AB  - This study aimed to investigate how the consumption of purple neem foliage rich in anthocyanins improves rumen fermentation, growth performance and plasma antioxidant activity in growing goats. In total, 25 Anglo-Nubian Thai native male goats (about 20 +/- 2 kg body weight; mean standard deviation (SD)) were assigned to 2 x 2 + 1 factorial in a completely randomized study design. There were five treatments: (1) control, (2) 3% normal neem foliage in concentrate, (3) 6% normal neem foliage in concentrate, (4) 3% purple neem foliage in concentrate and (5) 6% purple neem foliage in concentrate. The results show that the goats that were fed 6% purple neem foliage in concentrate had a higher (p < 0.01) feed intake gDM/d, %BW, g/kgBW(0.75), nutrient intake, nutrient digestion, final weight, weight change and ADG than did the goats that were fed 3% purple neem foliage in concentrate, 3% normal neem foliage in concentrate, 6% normal neem foliage in concentrate and control treatment. The feeding of 6% purple neem foliage in concentrate had higher (p < 0.01) N intake, N urine, N digestion, N digestion (%), N retention and N retention (%) than the other treatments. The goats receiving 6% purple neem foliage in concentrate had no negative effect (p < 0.01) on pH but had a higher (p < 0.01) level of ammonia nitrogen, BUN, acetic acid, propionic acid, ratio of acetic acid to propionic acid and total VFA at 2 and 4 h after feeding compared to the other treatments. The effect of anthocyanin-rich 6% purple neem foliage was shown to be higher than the other treatments (p < 0.01) for total bacteria, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Streptococcus bovis at 2 and 4 h after feeding. The goats fed 6% purple neem foliage displayed higher (p < 0.01) levels of total antioxidant (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and catalase (CAT) antioxidant activity in plasma at 2 and 4 h after feeding. The goats fed 6% purple neem foliage had lower (p < 0.01) protozoa methanogen and malondialdehyde (MDA) at 2 and 4 h after feeding. In developing growing goats, the introduction of anthocyanin-rich purple neem foliage boosted plasma antioxidant capacity, improved rumen volatile fatty acids and caused a shift in the structure and relative abundance of the ruminal microbial community.

TI  - Soil and Water Conservation Techniques in Tropical and Subtropical Asia: A Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Soil and water loss is a severe environmental problem in tropical and subtropical Asia (TSA). This review systematically summarizes the techniques that have been widely applied in the TSA region and compares the conservation efficiency of these techniques based on the runoff and sediment reduction ratios (eta(r) and eta(s)). The results show that the current techniques can be divided into biological, engineering and agricultural practice measures, and in most cases, their efficiencies in reducing sediment loss (eta(s) = 14.0-99.5%, 61.3-100.0% and 0.6-95.4%, respectively) were higher than in reducing runoff loss (eta(r) = 2.8-9.38%, 0.28-83.3% and 1.62-70.2%, respectively). Monocultures of single tree species (e.g., Pinus massoniana) sometimes showed very limited conservation effects. Vetiver and alfalfa were more effective at reducing soil loss than other hedgerow species. Contour tillage, ridge farming, and reduced tillage generally showed high efficiencies in reducing soil loss compared with other agricultural practice measures. The combination of engineering and biological techniques could more effectively reduce soil and water loss compared with the application of these techniques along. Future works should be conducted to build unified technical standards and reasonable comprehensive evaluation systems, to combine these techniques with environmental engineering technologies, and to develop new amendment materials.

TI  - Effect of Purple Neem Foliage as a Feed Supplement on Nutrient Apparent Digestibility, Nitrogen Utilization, Rumen Fermentation, Microbial Population, Plasma Antioxidants, Meat Quality and Fatty Acid Profile of Goats
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary Purple Neem foliage has been mostly found in Thailand. This plant contains anthocyanins, which may be useful to ruminants. Therefore, as a result, the purpose of this research was to evaluate the effect Purple Neem foliage as a feed supplement on nutrient apparent digestibility, nitrogen utilization, rumen fermentation, microbial population, plasma antioxidants and meat quality in goats. We observed that giving Purple Neem foliage to goats improved feed intake, nutrient digestion, nitrogen utilization, growth performance, rumen fermentation, microbial population, plasma antioxidant, meat quality and fatty acid profile in meat goat by increasing polyunsaturated fatty acid and antioxidant gene expression in meat goat by improve glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). As a results, Purple Neem foliage as a ruminant feed supplementation may become a viable alternative feed addition in the future. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effect of Purple Neem foliage as a feed supplement on nutrient apparent digestibility, nitrogen utilization, rumen fermentation, microbial population, plasma antioxidants, meat quality and fatty acid profile of goats. Eighteen Boer male goats (approximately 20 +/- 2 kg body weight; mean +/- standard deviation (SD)) were randomly allocated into three treatments. All goats were fed a 60 d daily feeding with three treatments: (1) control, (2) 3% Purple Neem foliage (PNF) + 3% sunflower oil (SFO) in concentrate, and (3) 6% Purple Neem foliage (PNF) + 3% sunflower oil (SFO) in concentrate. The findings indicate that goat feed containing 6% PNF + 3% SFO in concentrate increased feed consumption, nutrient intake, nutrient apparent digestibility and nitrogen utilization compared to the goat feed at 3% PNF + 3% SFO and the control group. The feeding of goats with 6% PNF + 3% SFO in concentrate resulted in high ammonia nitrogen, BUN, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and the total VFA levels were increased at 2 and 4 h after feeding (p < 0.01). The individual microbial population with 6% PNF + 3% SFO had higher (p < 0.01) total bacteria, higher Butyrivibrio fibrisolven, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefacises, and Streptococcus bovis, decreased protozoa and methanogen levels at 2 and 4 h after feeding. The antioxidant in plasma indices varied, with 6% PNF + 3% SFO having higher total antioxidant (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and catalase (CAT) antioxidant activity and lower malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma at 2 and 4 h after feeding. Additionally, goat fed 6% PNF + 3% SFO can improve meat quality by lowering drip loss, cooking loss, shear force, and saturated fatty acid as well as increase the fatty acid profile (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids) in goat meat. Our findings suggest that Purple Neem foliage might be an excellent alternative additive for goat feed.

TI  - Biological additives improved qualities, <i>in vitro</i> gas production kinetics, digestibility, and rumen fermentation characteristics of different varieties of rice straw silage
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB  - Context. The amelioration of low-quality cheap feed for livestock production has become a huge challenge faced by the livestock producers coupled with the illicit disposal of the straw, which causes global environmental nuisance through burning and health impairment. Aims. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of biological additives on nutrient profiles, silage quality, in vitro rumen fermentation in different varieties of rice straw silage; ML4, ML10, ML21, ML24, MR219 and Putra-1 were ensiled with water (control), enzyme (E) and a combination of bacteria and enzyme (BE) in a complete randomised design (CRD) experiment. Methodology. The rice straw varieties, obtained from the paddy research farm were chopped to similar to 2-3 cm, treated according to the above treatments to attain 70% moisture content and compressed in a 1 L jar and ensiled for 30 days. Key results. Crude protein (CP) in the treated rice straw silage was higher than in the control. The treatment with BE had a lower neutral detergent fibre (42.31%) and a lower acid detergent fibre (21.08%) concentration for Putra-1 than did other treatments (E and control) and varieties. For the silage extract, the lowest pH, NH3, butyric acid and propionic acid were obtained in the BE treatment in most of the rice straw varieties. In addition, straw treated with BE had the highest lactic acid content, in vitro gas production kinetics, digestibility, and rumen fermentation, compared with the E and control treatments. Conclusion. This study showed that a BE treatment effectively improved the quality of rice straw silage, with the Putra-1 variety giving the most outstanding result.

TI  - Silage preparation and sustainable livestock production of natural woody plant
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - As the global population increases and the economy grows rapidly, the demand for livestock products such as meat, egg and milk continue to increase. The shortage of feed in livestock production is a worldwide problem restricting the development of the animal industry. Natural woody plants are widely distributed and have a huge biomass yield. The fresh leaves and branches of some woody plants are rich in nutrients such as proteins, amino acids, vitamins and minerals and can be used to produce storage feed such as silage for livestock. Therefore, the development and utilization of natural woody plants for clean fermented feed is important for the sustainable production of livestock product. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the research progress, current status and development prospects of forageable natural woody plant feed resources. The nutritional composition and uses of natural woody plants, the main factors affecting the fermentation of woody plant silage and the interaction mechanism between microbial co-occurrence network and secondary metabolite are reviewed. Various preparation technologies for clean fermentation of woody plant silage were summarized comprehensively, which provided a sustainable production mode for improving the production efficiency of livestock and producing high-quality livestock product. Therefore, woody plants play an increasingly important role as a potential natural feed resource in alleviating feed shortage and promoting sustainable development of livestock product.

TI  - Nutritional Composition of Black Soldier Fly Larvae (<i>Hermetia illucens</i> L.) and Its Potential Uses as Alternative Protein Sources in Animal Diets: A Review
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary With the increasing global population, the shortage of protein feed resources is becoming more and more serious, and human beings urgently need to find new protein sources to replace traditional soybean meal and fish meal. Black soldier fly larvae are rich in fatty acids, proteins and minerals. Numerous studies have shown that adding black soldier fly larvae powder to monogastric animals has no negative effects on animal growth performance, meat quality and immunity. However, black soldier flies are still subject to legal constraints and consumer acceptance when they are used as feed. The rapidly growing population has increased demand for protein quantities and, following a shortage of plant-based feed protein sources and the prohibition of animal-based feed protein, has forced the search for new sources of protein. Therefore, humans have turned their attention to edible insects. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) (Hermetia illucens L.) are rich in nutrients such as fat, protein and high-quality amino acids and minerals, making them a good source of protein. Furthermore, BSFL are easily reared and propagated on any nutrient substrate such as plant residues, animal manure and waste, food scraps, agricultural byproducts, or straw. Although BSFL cannot completely replace soybean meal in poultry diets, supplementation of less than 20% has no negative impact on chicken growth performance, biochemical indicators and meat quality. In pig studies, although BSFL supplementation did not have any negative effect on growth performance and meat quality, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was reduced. There is obviously less research on the feeding of BSFL in pigs than in poultry, particularly in relation to weaning piglets and fattening pigs; further research is needed on the supplementation level of sows. Moreover, it has not been found that BSFL are used in ruminants, and the next phase of research could therefore study them. The use of BSFL in animal feed presents some challenges in terms of cost, availability and legal and consumer acceptance. However, this should be considered in the context of the current shortage of protein feed and the nutritional value of BSFL, which has important research significance in animal production.

TI  - Effect of <i>Brosimum alicastrum</i> Foliage on Intake, Kinetics of Fermentation and Passage and Microbial N Supply in Sheep Fed <i>Megathyrsus maximus</i> Hay
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - The foliage of the tree Brosimum alicastrum is widely employed by small farmers in Latin America to supplement cattle, sheep and goats during the dry season. Foliage is manually cut, and the branches are chopped and fed directly, being highly palatable to ruminant species. The foliage remains green throughout the year, and the tree can be defoliated twice per year. Cattle can also directly browse the foliage from the tree, but it is mostly used in cut and carry systems and transported in carts to farms. The experiment hereby described showed that the crude protein fraction of the foliage of B. alicastrum is highly fermentable in the rumen, supplying nitrogen for growth of the microbial population. As the percent of foliage of B. alicastrum in the ration was increased, dry matter intake by sheep was concomitantly increased, as was the rate of the passage of digesta through the rumen and the supply of microbial nitrogen to the small intestine. The foliage of B. alicastrum is a valuable feedstuff for ruminants in the tropics and can be used as a cheap source of protein during the critical periods of the year to improve weight gain and milk yield in a sustainable way. An experiment was carried out to assess the effect of the incorporation of sun-dried foliage of Brosimum alicastrum into rations based on hay of Megathyrsus maximus on intake, rumen fermentation, kinetics of passage, microbial nitrogen supply to the small intestine, apparent digestibility in Pelibuey hair sheep. Four rations were randomly allotted to four rumen-cannulated lambs (BW = 37.4 +/- 4.9 kg) using a 4 x 4 Latin square design to assess the effect of increasing levels (0, 15, 30 and 45% DM basis) of foliage of Brosimum alicastrum on a basal ration of M. maximus. Organic matter intake and water consumption increased linearly (p < 0.01) with increasing levels of B. alicastrum in the ration. The rate and potential extent of rumen fermentation of OM and CP of B. alicastrum were 10.6%/h and 86.6% and 11.4%/h and 95.2%, respectively, but no effect (p > 0.05) was found on the potential rumen degradation of DM (40.2%) or on the rate of degradation of DM (0.033%/h) of M. maximus, although a positive effect was found in the rumen degradation rate of NDF (p < 0.05). VFA and ammonia concentration in the rumen and the rate of passage of solids and liquids through the rumen (k1) increased linearly (p < 0.01) with increasing levels of B. alicastrum. Rumen pH was not affected by the incorporation of B. alicastrum (p > 0.05). Microbial nitrogen supply to the small intestine (p < 0.001), apparent digestibility of dry matter (p < 0.01) and NDF (p < 0.05) of the rations were also significantly increased as a result of the incorporation of B. alicastrum foliage. Results from this experiment suggest that the foliage of Brosimum alicastrum can be readily incorporated at around 30% of the ration of dry matter in hair sheep with beneficial effects on feed intake, rate of passage and microbial N supply to the lower tract.

TI  - Plants causing poisoning outbreaks of livestock in South America: A review
T2  - TOXICON-X
AB  - This paper reviews toxic plants for livestock in South America. We included 219 plants in this review, considering only the plants that caused at least one demonstrated outbreak of poisoning. Plants reported as toxic in other regions and present in South America, but with no confirmed outbreaks of poisoning in this region, are not included. We report the main aspects of the epidemiology, clinical signs, pathology and economical importance of the poisonings. Initially, the toxic plants are described based on their toxic compounds, but because the toxic compound is unknown in 92 (42%) of the plants we also classify them according to the affected system. This review highlights the great diversity of toxic plants capable of affecting livestock in South America, and for this reason studies in this regard should be intensified.
