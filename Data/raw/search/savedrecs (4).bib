Title = {Acanthoscelides atrocephalus (Pic, 1938) and Its Potential for
   Biological Control of Two Weed Species},

Abstract = {In order to replace chemical herbicides, which harm the environment and
   health, we seek sustainable methods to control weeds. We remove a
   seed-beetle species, Acanthoscelides atrocephalus, from synonymy with
   Acanthoscelides modestus and recognize it as a potential bioagent for
   Aeschynomene denticulata and A. indica. Belonging the megacornis group
   of the genus Acanthoscelides, its fine morphology was analyzed using
   high-resolution photography and scanning electron microscopy. The
   species differs from others of the A. megacornis group based on
   integument coloration, distinctive patterns of vestiture on the pronotum
   and pygidium, large and sexually dimorphic eyes, a strong frontal carina
   extending from the vertex of the head to the clypeus, and distinctive
   armature in the internal sac of the male genitalia. It stands out as a
   biological control agent due to the larvae's habit of feeding on seeds,
   which hinders the development of the embryo. Through tetrazolium and
   germination tests, it was discovered that 100\% of the infested seeds
   had no viable seed integument and did not germinate. A. atrocephalus is
   no longer a synonym of Acanthoscelides modestus. This species is a
   predator of A. denticulata and A. indica and prevents seed germination,
   becoming promising as a bioagent for the control of these weeds.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the interactions between two arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (Glomus aggregatum and Glomus mosseae) and a
   P-solubilizing fungus (Mortierella sp.), with respect to their effects
   on growth of Kostelelzkya virginica and urease, invertase, neutral
   phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and catalase activities of
   rhizosphere and bulk soils at different salinity levels (i.e., 0, 100,
   200, and 300 mM NaCl). Percentage of AMF colonization, Mortierella sp.
   populations, pH, electrical conductivity, and available P concentration
   in soil were also determined. Combined inoculation of AMF and
   Mortierella sp. increased the percentage of AMF colonization and
   Mortierella sp. populations under salt stress (i.e., 100, 200, and 300
   mM NaCl). The dual inoculation of Mortierella sp. with AMF (G.
   aggregatum or G. mosseae) had significant effects on shoot and root dry
   weights and available P concentrations, pH values, and electrical
   conductivities of rhizosphere and bulk soils under salt stress. The
   inoculation of Mortierella sp. significantly enhanced the positive
   effects of AMF on some enzyme activities (i.e., neutral phosphatase,
   alkaline phosphatase, and catalase in bulk soil; neutral phosphatase and
   urease in rhizosphere soil); on the contrary, it produced negative
   effects on urease activities in bulk soil and invertase activities in
   bulk and rhizosphere soils. The results indicated that the most
   effective co-inoculation was the dual inoculation with Mortierella sp.
   and G. mosseae, which may help in alleviating the deleterious effects of
   salt on plants growth and soil enzyme activities.},

Abstract = {The contribution of the leguminous hedgerow trees Flemingia congesta and
   mixed Gliricidia sepium - Peltophorum dasyrrachis established on an
   Ultisol (Grossarenic Kandiudult) in Northern Lampung, Sumatra to the N
   economy of the hedgerow intercropping system was assessed. N-2 fixation
   estimates of hedgerow trees over a two year period after establishment
   were obtained by the N-15 dilution method using Peltophorum dasyrrachis
   as the non-fixing reference plant.
   Average yearly tree pruning dry matter and total N yields of the two
   hedgerow systems were not significantly different although seasonal
   differences occurred. Gliricidia obtained a larger (average 51\%)
   proportion of its N from N-2 fixation than Flemingia (average 25\%) the
   effect being consistent over the two years. Seasonal variation in the \%
   N derived from N-2 fixation was associated with changes in soil mineral
   N availability. The amount of N-2 fixed was not significantly different
   between the two N fixing trees (26 vs. 35 kg N ha (1) yr(-1)
   respectively). This was due to the higher total N yield of Flemingia
   compared to Gliricidia compensating for the smaller proportion of N
   derived from N-2 fixation. The amount of tree soil N uptake was similar
   for the two hedgerow systems suggesting that the higher proportion of N
   derived from N-2 fixation in Gliricidia was probably due to competition
   for soil mineral N by the associated non-fixing Peltophorum. Rapid
   temporal and spatial decline in plant available N-15 occurred suggesting
   that matching of fixing and non-fixing reference plants is important.
   Compared with estimates of N-2 fixation obtained by the natural
   abundance method the N-15 dilution method overestimated N-2 fixation by
   the tree legumes (an average of up to 18\%), however the difference
   between the two fixing legume trees was maintained. N balance estimates
   suggested that N-2 fixation inputs of alley trees were sufficient to
   sustain moderate crop yields but for higher food crop yields, N-2 fixing
   leguminous crops would have to be included to balance N off-take.},

Abstract = {Toxic compounds present in plants are an important factor limiting the
   nutritional use of tropical legumes. This work deals particularly with
   the toxic nonprotein amino acid analogues mimosine, DOPA, and canavanine
   and structurally related compounds such as nicotinic acid,
   3-hydroxypyridine, and catechol. The effect of these toxins was measured
   on the viability of eukaryote cultured cells (MA-104) and rumen protozoa
   and on the fermentation activity (production of VFAs, ammonia, and gas)
   by inocula from faunated and defaunated sheep in vitro. Toxins did not
   increase cell death of protozoa, while catechol and nicotinic acid
   increased cell death of MA-104 cells. Thus, these toxins affected
   differentially the viability of eukaryote cells. Mimosine, nicotinic
   acid, DOPA, and canavanine had a stimulatory effect on fermentation but
   increased accumulation of methane by faunated inoculum. Catechol
   drastically depressed the fermentation activity of faunated and
   defaunated inocula and impaired the ammonia uptake by rumen microbes.
   Therefore, none of these toxins would be suitable to eliminate protozoa,
   and they do not appear to improve the overall fermentation balance in
   the rumen.},

Abstract = {Objective: To explore anthelmintic effects of oral administration of
   aqueous extract of Sauce lloron (Salix babylonica; SB) against
   gastrointestinal nematodes and Moniezia spp. Methods: Sixteen Pelibuey
   male lambs of 3-4 months of age and (23.7 +/- 3.3) kg body weight were
   used in a completely randomized design to be fed a total mixed ration
   (Control: SBO), or Control plus SB extract using 20 (SB20), 40 (SB40)
   and 60 (SB60) mL/lamb/day for 45 days. Lambs had a natural
   gastrointestinal nematodes and Moniezia spp. infection and had never
   been treated with chemical anthelmintic drugs. Individual faecal samples
   were collected for ova counting using McMaster procedure after 0, 7, 14,
   21, 30 and 45 days post extract administration. Results: No extract dose
   X day interactions for both gastrointestinal nematodes and Moniezia spp.
   egg count were found. Administration of SB extract had a higher effect
   (quadratic effect, P=0.0064) at dose of 20 mL SB/lamb/day for
   gastrointestinal nematode eggs during the first 21 days: however, the
   dose of SB40 tended (linear effect, P=0.089 7) to be more effective than
   the others for Moniezia spp. egg during the first 7 days. Sampling day
   had a linear (P=0.043 6) effect on Moniezia spp. egg count. Conclusions:
   The aqueous extract of SB could be more effective against nematodes at
   20 and at 40 mL/lamb/day for Moniezia spp. The use of the SB extract
   could represent a promising alternative to synthetic anthelmintics for
   the treatment of gastrointestinal nematodes and Moniezia spp. in small
   ruminants from organic and conventional production systems.},

Abstract = {The interrelationship among seasonality of cambium, wood formation, cell
   size variation, lignification, tree phenology and climatic factors has
   been examined in Moringa oleifera, a tropical evergreen tree. The
   vascular cambium in Moringa is a storied with a distinct seasonal
   variation in its structure due to dimensional changes in rays. Though
   cambium remains active throughout the year it is sensitive to water
   availability. Peak cambial cell division and rate of xylem
   differentiation are influenced by average rainfall during the monsoon
   period. Cambial cell division reaches higher up in the tree trunk when
   it is supporting a high number of branches and leaves. Statistical
   analysis of cell size variation and climate factors revealed that xylem
   cell development is greatly influenced by rainfall and rarely by
   temperature. Lengths of fusiform initials and vessel elements are
   positively correlated. The pattern of lignification during xylogenesis
   shows that the vessels are the first element to develop lignified walls
   and ray cells are the last elements to become lignified. Fiber cell
   walls show more syringyl lignin, while the cell walls of other xylem
   elements are characterized by relatively more guaiacyl lignin units. (C)

Abstract = {Effects of supplementing tree foliage mixtures on voluntary intake,

   fed low quality diets. Five treatments were examined in a 5 x 5 Latin
   square design, which consisted of a basal diet of grass (Sorghum
   halepense) hay supplemented with Brosimum alicastrum (B) and Lysiloma
   latisiliquum (L) at the following rates (g DM/kg diet): 13264, L0;
   13198, L66; 13132, L132; B66, L198 and 130, L264. Additionally, an in
   situ degradability evaluation was completed with two ruminally
   cannulated cows. Neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent insoluble
   N (ADIN), lignin(sa) and total phenols (TP) were higher (P<0.01) in L
   latisiliquum versus B. alicastrum. Daily intake (g/kg LW0.75/day) of DM
   (from 98 to 73) and OM (from 88 to 66) decreased quadratically (P<0.01),
   whereas CP (from 8.0 to 5.6) and ME (from 7.7 to 5.2, MJ/sheep/day)
   reduced linearly (P<0.01), as L. latisiliquum increased in the diet.
   Apparent digestibility of DM (from 0.486 to 0.445), OM (from 0.511 to
   0.458) and CP (from 0.417 to 0.198) decreased linearly (P<0.01) and was
   associated with a low ruminal in situ CP degradability of L.
   latisiliquum. The decrease in N intake and digestibility induced lower
   (P<0.01) N retention (from 2.7 to 0.1 g/sheep/day). Although the
   incremental substitution of B. alicastrum with L latisiliquum negatively
   affected intake, rumen degradation, digestibility and N balance, results
   indicate that this foliage mixture, but with no more than 132 g DM/kg
   diet of L latisiliquum, could be used as a supplementation strategy to
   sheep fed low quality forage without negative effects on voluntary

   The autohydrolysis process was more suitable for woody species than for

Abstract = {Intake of nutrients and rumen fermentation values were determined in a 4
   x 4 Latin square design using four rumen fistulated Friesian steers. In
   Trial 1, steers were fed medium (MNG) or old (ONG) maturity napier grass
   (Pennisetum purpureum) supplemented with 3.65 kg of DM of sunflower seed
   meal based concentrate (SFBC) or poultry litter based concentrate (PLBC)
   while in Trial 2, steers were fed MNG only or MNG supplemented with
   0.91, 3.65 or 6.35 kg of DM of the PLBC. In Trial 1, intakes of crude
   protein (CP) (15.3 vs 11.1 g kg(-1) W-0.75) and organic matter (OM)
   (127.1 vs 124.7 g kg(-1) W-0.75) were higher on MNG vs ONG diets while
   intakes of CP and OM were 3\% higher on SFBC vs PLBC diets. Rumen pH was
   higher (7.1 vs 6.7) on ONG vs MNG (P < 0.05) but similar on SFBC vs PLBC
   diets (P > 0.05). Concentrations of ammonia (NH3-N) were higher on MNG
   vs ONG (101.0 vs 51.2 mg l(-1)) but 12.5\% lower on SFBC vs PLBC diets
   while concentrations of VFA were higher on MNG vs ONG (123.8 vs 101.8
   mmol l(-1)) and 2.5\% higher on SFBC vs PLBC diets (P < 0.05),
   Supplementing ONG with PLBC resulted in suboptimal feed intake and
   digestion. In Trial 2, the substitution rate of MNG was negative at 0.91
   kg/day of PLBC but positive, and higher (P < 0.05) at higher levels of
   supplementation. Intakes of OM were 100.8, 111.6, 128.6 and 132.3 g
   kg(-1) W-0.75 while intakes of CP were 10.6, 12.2, 15.6 and 17.5 g
   kg(-1) W-0.75 for treatments 0, 0.91, 3.65 and 6.35 kg/day of PLBC,
   respectively, (P < 0.05). Although rumen concentrations of NH3-N
   increased to 6.35 kg/day of PLBC (P < 0.05), optimal feed intake and
   digestion were obtained at 3.65 kg/day. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title = {Mixed short rotation plantations of Populus alba and Robinia
   pseudoacacia for biomass yield},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {410},
Pages = {48-55},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The possibility of using mixtures of species in an attempt to increase
   biomass yield in plantations managed in short rotation coppice (SRC) has
   received little attention in scientific literature. The hypothesis is
   that mixtures of two complementary species under SRC are more productive
   than monocultures. The objective of this study was to compare the growth
   and yield of mixtures and monocultures at the tree and stand levels. A
   mixed plantation of Populus alba L. genotype `111' (P) and the nitrogen
   -fixing species Robinia pseudoacacia L. genotype `Nyirsegi' (R) was
   established in 2012 in the centre of Spain, at a density of 10,000 trees
   per hectare (spacing 0.4 m x 2.5 m). The experimental design included
   pure as well as mixtures with different proportions of the species
   (100P:OR; 75P:25R; 50P:50R; 25P:75R and OP:100R) following a completely
   randomized block design with 64 trees per plot. There was a positive
   effect of the mixture 75P:25R in terms of biomass yield, achieving a
   total yield of 13.66 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (26.83\% higher than that of the
   P. alba monoculture and 89.99\% higher than the R. pseudoacacia
   monoculture), with both species achieving a greater biomass yield per
   tree. In the other mixture treatments there was no significant positive
   effect of the nitrogen (N) fixing species on the non-N-fixing species.
   Within-row interactions were more important than between
   row-interactions. There was a positive effect on the yield of R.
   pseudoacacia when the neighbouring trees (within a row) on both sides
   were P. alba, while P. alba responded better with a P. alba tree on one
   side and a R. pseudoacacia tree on the other. The results point to the
   presence of competitive reduction or facilitation as the mechanisms for
   increased biomass yield under certain mixture ratios, and indicates the
   importance of mixing within the same row rather than row-by-row, in this
   type of plantation.},

Abstract = {This study tested the ability of exponential fertilization to minimize
   the tradeoff of increased seedling size and nutrient concentration with
   good root colonization by mycorrhizae. Two native Hawaiian tree species
   were tested. Four rates of nitrogen (N) (0-3 g per seedling) were
   delivered by the method of exponential fertilization to seedlings with
   and without inoculation with a native strain of arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungus. For both species, the highest growth and nutrient concentrations
   occurred with mycorrhizal colonization at 1-2 g N per seedling. Growth
   of inoculated seedlings was significantly lower at 3.0 g N per seedling,
   likely due to a large reduction in mycorrhizal colonization. Our results
   demonstrate that mycorrhizal colonization is not only compatible with
   exponential fertilization, combined they produce larger seedlings with
   higher nutrient content. This should improve outplanting success in
   degraded or challenging sites.},

Journal = {SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH},

Volume = {24},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Structural studies in seeds with physical dormancy (PY) are important to
   better understand its causes and release when subjected to treatments
   for dormancy breaking. The aims of this study were to (1) characterize
   the PY break; (2) examine the role of different seed structures in water
   uptake; and (3) identify the water gap in Senna multijuga seeds.
   Imbibition patterns of dormant and non-dormant (subjected to dormancy
   breaking treatments) seeds and the morphological changes during dormancy
   breaking and germination were evaluated. To identify the water gap, the
   micropyle and lens were blocked separately, and the water absorption by
   seed parts was determined. Structural characteristics of the seed coat
   were also examined. Immersion in water at 80 degrees C was efficient in
   breaking seed dormancy and imbibition occurred first at the hilar
   region, through the lens. Water was not absorbed through the micropyle
   or the extra-hilar region. S. multijuga seeds have a testa with a
   linearly aligned micropyle, hilum and lens. The seed coat consisted of a
   cuticle, macrosclereids, one (hilar region) or two (extra-hilar region)
   layer(s) of osteosclereids and parenchyma cell layers. The lens has
   typical parenchyma cells underneath it and two fragile regions comprised
   of shorter macrosclereids. Heat treatment stimulated the lens region,
   resulting in the opening of fragile regions at the lens, allowing water
   to enter the seeds. It is concluded that short-term exposure to a hot
   water treatment is sufficient for the formation of a water gap in S.
   multijuga seeds, and only the lens acts in the imbibition process.},

Abstract = {Grain legumes fix about 15-210 kg N ha(-1) seasonally in Africa, and
   therefore feature prominently in the cropping systems of traditional
   farmers. However, increased exploitation of this biological N is
   constrained by various environmental and nutritional Factors, including
   the cropping patterns used. An evaluation of traditional cropping
   systems in Africa shows that crop rotation involving legume and cereal
   monocultures is by far more sustainable than intercropping, the most
   dominant cultural practice in the continent. Tree legumes also fix about
   43-581 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), making their leaf prunings an important
   component of sustainability in agroforestry and alley cropping systems.
   In a single year, the prunings of Sesbania sesban can provide up to a
   hectare of cereal crop, up to 448 kg N, 31.4 kg P, 125 kg K, 114 kg Ca
   and 27.3 kg Mg, thus making the foliage of this legume the `'ideal''
   fertilizer. Clearly, achieving sustainable yields in Sub-Saharan Africa
   would require a deeper understanding of how fixed N in legume residues
   is managed in the soil environment, in addition to expanding the use of
   neglected African food legumes, which exhibit considerable drought
   resistance and nitrate tolerance. In Africa. where soil moisture often
   limits yields, research on neglected, symbiotic native legumes with NOS
   and drought-tolerant traits would constitute a sound basis for increased
   sustainable production. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDIn northern Australia, beef cattle grazed extensively on
   tropical rangelands are responsible for 5\% of the nation's total
   greenhouse gas emissions. Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas and
   in grazing ruminants might be mitigated by selecting forages that, when
   consumed, produce less CH4 when fermented by rumen microbes. This study
   examined variability in the in vitro fermentation patterns, including
   CH4 production of selected tropical grasses and legumes, to identify
   candidates for CH4 mitigation in grazing livestock in northern
   Australia.
   RESULTSNutritive values and fermentation parameters varied between plant
   species and across seasons. Grasses with a relatively low methanogenic
   potential were Urochloa mosambicensis (wet summer), Bothriochloa
   decipiens (autumn), Sorghum plumosum (winter) and Andropogon gayanus
   (spring), while the legumes were Calliandra calothyrsus (wet summer and
   autumn), Stylosanthes scabra (winter) and Desmanthus leptophyllus
   (spring). There was some correlation between CH4 production and overall
   fermentation (volatile fatty acid concentrations) in grasses (R-2 =
   0.67), but not in legumes (R-2 = 0.01) and there were multiple plants
   that had lower CH4 not associated with reduction in microbial activity.
   CONCLUSIONDifferences in nutrient concentrations of tropical grasses and
   legumes may provide opportunities for productive grazing on these
   pastures, while offering some CH4 mitigation options in the context of
   northern Australian extensive beef farming systems. (c) 2017 Society of

Abstract = {Twenty-four yearling male local Washera lambs with an average initial
   body weight of 18.14 +/- 1.07 kg were used to assess the nutritional
   value of Millettia ferruginea. Experimental animals were grouped into
   six blocks of four animals, and each animal was randomly assigned to one
   of the four dietary treatment feeds. The treatments used were; Sole
   natural pasture grass hay (T1), and 150, 300, 450 g DM Millettia
   ferruginea leaf hay with ad libitum natural pasture grass hay assigned
   for (T2), (T3) and (T4), respectively. The feeding trial was carried out
   for 80 days followed by a 10 days of digestibility trial. Carcasses of
   each experimental animal were evaluated at the end of the digestibility
   experiment. Millettia ferruginea leaf hay had 224.6, 556.6, 360.7and
   127.4 g/kg crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid
   detergent fiber (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL), respectively. The
   average intakes of Millettia ferruginea leaf hay were 0, 133, 263 and
   253 g/day for T1, T2, T3 and T4, in that order. The proportions of
   Millettia ferruginea leaf hay intake from the total dry matter (DM) were
   0, 23.5, 44.1, and 43.3\% for T1, T2, T3 and T4, respectively. The total
   DM intake was not significant but showed a trend of T1 > T3 > T4 > T2.
   CP intake was higher for T3 and T4 with the least intake for T1. Final
   body weight measurement was higher for T3 and T1 but lower and negative
   for T2 and T4. Generally, body weight measurements were not consistent
   in the supplemented groups throughout the trial period. The weight of
   heart, spleen, and liver were higher for the supplemented groups
   compared to the sole grass hay. From the results of the current study,
   it can be concluded that, Millettia ferruginea had some limiting
   factors, which prevented the animal from efficiently utilize it.
   Therefore, this study revealed the indispensable role of animal feeding
   experiments with target animals to examine such impacts.},

Abstract = {Effect of supplementation with non-conventional agro-industrial

   and field pea hull. Thirty indigenous rams weighing 22.6 +/- 0.97 kg,
   were stratified into weight groups and randomly assigned to dietary

   but improved (P < 0.001) rumen ammonia, total VIA, microbial nitrogen
   supply (P < 0.01) and microbial efficiency (P < 0.05). Supplement types
   did not affect (P > 0.05) rumen fermentation and microbial nitrogen
   supply, but showed difference (P < 0.001) for propionate and butyrate
   concentrations. Type of atella supplements showed variation, whereby
   rumen pH was low (P < 0.05), but rumen ammonia, VFA, molar proportions
   of acetate, propionate and butyrate were high (P < 0.001) for katikala
   atella compared to tela atella. Lentil hull had higher (P < 0.01) rumen
   ammonia concentration, microbial nitrogen supply and microbial
   efficiency than other pulse hull supplements. It was concluded that both
   atella and pulse hulls have potential as supplements for ruminants. More
   specifically lentil hull and katikala atella seemed to be superior in

   assessed for nodulation in three Ghanaian soils. After 12 weeks of
   growth in nursery pots the 200 rhizobial strains isolated from their
   nodules were characterized culturally, metabolically and phenotypically.
   Sixty of these isolates were selected randomly and their genotypic
   characteristics determined using PCR-RFLP of 16S rRNA and intergenic
   spacer (ITS) genes. Each tree legume was nodulated by isolates
   classified as fast or very fast-growers or by isolates classified as
   slow-or very slow-growers with 54 \% of all the 200 isolates belonging
   to fastor very fast-growers. Morphologically, eighty five percent of the
   colonies formed on yeast extract mannitol agar were wet and gummy while
   70 \% were acid tolerant, i.e. they were able to grow at a pH of 3.5.
   Combined restriction of the 16S rRNA genes of the 60 rhizobial isolates
   with five restriction enzymes clearly distinguished seven different
   clusters at 80 \% similarity level. The majority of A. lebbeck isolates
   were distinct from those of the Acacias and L. leucocephala. The M.
   thonningii isolates were related to L. leucocephala isolates. Simple PCR
   of the ITS DNA provided several distinct band sizes indicating great
   variation among the isolates and restriction of the ITS with three
   different enzymes did not yield many further differences. Molecular
   techniques revealed a great diversity among the rhizobia that nodulate
   tree legumes in the tropics and this may explain why many introduced
   and/or indigenous trees are able to form nodules with indigenous
   rhizobia in this region.},

Abstract = {Magnetic porous adsorbent materials are widely favored for their large
   specific surface area, good adsorption performance, and ease of
   separation. This work provided a magnetic biochar derived from furfural
   residue (M-FRAC) with excellent adsorption properties for various
   pollutants, including Congo red (CR), Tetracycline (TC), Bisphenol A
   (BPA), and Cr6+. The influence of experimental parameters, such as
   pollutant concentration, contact time, and pH, on the adsorption
   properties of M-FRAC was studied in detail. The adsorption process was
   highly dependent on pH and initial contaminant concentration. All
   pollutant adsorption was favorable under acidic conditions. The optimal
   pH of the CR, TC, and Cr6+ adsorption was 5, 4, and 2, respectively,
   while that of BPA was in the range of 2-5. The experimental equilibrium
   adsorption amount of CR, TC, BPA, and Cr6+ by M-FRAC was 110.89, 602.81,
   157.76, and 265.31 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption processes of
   pollutants on M-FRAC were in accordance with the Langmuir isotherm
   model. The adsorption kinetics fitted the pseudo-second-order (PSO)
   kinetics model. In addition, M-FRAC could be readily separated from
   solution by applying an external magnetic field. Therefore, the M-FRAC
   has a good application prospect in practical industrial wastewater
   treatment.},

   three housekeeping genes and symbiosis related genes. Eleven strains
   improved the plant shoot dry mass significantly comparing to that of not

   and four species related to Rhizobium and Agrobacterium. The isolates
   carried four and five genotypes of nifH and nodC, respectively, in six
   different nifH-nodC combinations. When looking at the species-nifH-nodC
   combinations it is noteworthy that all but two of the six R. anhuiense

Volume = {27},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Plant competition can be a potent force influencing the success or
   failure of pasture establishment and hence the financial viability of
   pasture development. Perennial legumes, including tree legumes, are
   particularly vulnerable to competition because of their slow seedling
   growth rate. This paper reviews the effects of plant competition during
   pasture establishment in subtropical and tropical areas of northern
   Australia and advances the hypothesis that gaps in the existing pasture
   of adequate size are needed for reliable and effective establishment.
   Root competition is generally more important than shoot competition for
   the growth and survival of seedlings. Variation in requirements for
   nutrients and the ability to form symbioses with rhizobium bacteria and,
   in some cases, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza, enable legumes to
   compete successfully with, and establish in native grasslands on low
   fertility soils; grass establishment usually fails under such
   conditions. This paper discusses the need for a greater understanding of
   how the effects of root competition vary according to the amount and
   distribution of rainfall, and how the effects of fire and grazing might
   affect root competition in different climatic regions.},

Title = {Effect of exogenous application of L-mimosine on physiological,
   cytogenetic, biochemical and anatomical characteristics of Allium cepa L},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {175},
Pages = {744-754},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mimosine {[}beta-(3-hydroxy-4-pyridone-1-yl)-l-alanine] is a toxic non-
   protein amino acid, and one of its major effects is to suppress plant
   growth and development. Since mimosine is a compound responsible for
   many interesting biological activities, intensive studies have begun to
   be carried out on it in recent years. The current work investigated
   toxic effects of exogenously given 1, 2 and 3 mM l-mimosine doses on
   some physiological, cytogenetic, biochemical, and anatomical parameters
   of Allium cepa L. bulbs. For this purpose, the germination percentage
   (GP), root length (RL), root number (RN), and fresh weight (FW) were
   determinated as physiological parameters to be examined experimentally;
   the micronucleus (MN) frequency, chromosomal aberrations (CAs), and
   mitotic index (MI) were chosen as cytogenetic parameters; and the
   catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities,
   malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and free proline (PR) content were
   determinated as biochemical parameters to be investigated. In addition,
   the changes in the root anatomical structure of the bulbs were examined
   under the microscope by taking cross-sections. Onion bulbs were divided
   into four groups as three treatments and one control (C). For seven
   days, the bulbs in the treatment groups were germinated with three
   different doses of l-mimosine (1, 2 and 3 mM), while the bulbs in the C
   group were germinated with tap water. Consequently, all three doses of
   l-mimosine caused a decrease (p < 0.05) in all investigated
   physiological parameter (GP, RL, RN and FW) values compared to C.
   Furthermore, every l-mimosine dosage resulted in a reduce (p < 0.05) in
   MI and an increase (p < 0.05) in MN and CA frequency compared to C
   group. l-mimosine application promoted CAs such as irregular mitosis,
   stick chromosome, lagging chromosome, protruded out chromosome, pole
   deviation and alignment in root meristem cells. Exposure to l-mimosine
   resulted in dose-related increases (p < 0.05) in SOD and CAT enzyme
   activity as well as MDA and PR levels compared to C group, indicating
   that l-mimosine also induced toxicity by causing oxidative stress in
   cells. Also, especially exposure to a dose of 3 mM l-mimosine caused the
   anatomical damages such as deformations of the epidermis and cortex
   cells, necrosis, buildup of certain chemical compounds in the cortex
   cells, thickening of the cortex cell wall, formation of vacuoles in the
   cell nuclei and flattened cell nuclei in the root tip meristem cells. In
   summary, since l-mimosine showed an inhibitory effect in the Allium cepa
   L. test material, it was concluded that the compound induced
   multi-dimensional toxicity, and the Allium test proved to be a highly
   valuable tool in identifying this toxicity.},

Abstract = {Management of nitrogen (N) nutrition is a vital aspect in maize
   production systems of Kenya. In Central and Western parts of Kenya, high
   population density has eliminated the use of traditional fallow farming
   systems for replenishing soil fertility while high unevenly distributed
   rainfall increase chances of N leaching. A study was conducted at
   Maseno, and Kabete to investigate the fate of fertilizer N in the
   soil-plant system using treatments that had been receiving leaf prunings
   of Calliandra calothyrsus and Tithonia diversifolia. Two microplots were
   installed in the main treatments to which labelled fertilizer was
   applied. At the beginning and at the end of 2002 long rains, soil was
   sampled to 200 cm for N and N-15 enrichment analysis at the two trials.
   Also at the end of the season plant samples were collected for N and
   N-15 analysis. At Maseno trial, evenly distributed rainfall and the
   influence of organic resource quality enhanced good fertilizer nitrogen
   recovery in the maize crop. Also substantial nitrate movement down the
   soil profile was observed in the control followed closely by calliandra
   at the end of the 2002 long rains season. At Kabete trial recorded the
   poorest fertilizer N recovery due to unevenly distributed rainfall.
   Limited soil moisture reduced both soil and fertilizer N uptake which
   was reflected in high N in the top soil and low recovery in plant. Most
   of the nitrate-N was left in the tp soil as a result of low rainfall
   which couldn't move it into the lower soil depths.},

Abstract = {Four Pelibuey sheep fitted with flexible rumen cannula were fed
   increasing levels of Gliricidia sepium foliage (gliricidia) in a 4 x 4
   Latin square design. Treatments were: control, 10, 20 and 30\% (dry
   basis) of gliricidia mixed in a basal diet of Cynodon nlemfuensis
   (stargrass) hay. Dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and crude protein
   (CP) intakes were linearly increased (P < 0.05) from 45.2, 40.4, 2.0 to
   71.5, 63.3 and 6.8 g/kg W-0.75/d, for the control and the 30\%
   gliricidia diet, respectively. Similarly, increments of gliricidia in
   the diet resulted in a linear increase in DM, OM and CP apparent
   disgestibilities from 43.7, 48.4 and 27.0 to 50.7, 54.7 and 57.3\%, for
   the control and 30\% gliricidia diet, respectively. There was no effect
   (P > 0.05) of supplementation with gliricidia on rumen dry matter
   digestion of stargrass. Microbial nitrogen (N) supply to the small
   intestine had a trend towards an increase from 4.9, for the control, to
   9.6 g N/d, for the 30\% diet, though it was not significant (P > 0.05).
   It is concluded that, gliricidia might be incorporated into low quality
   diets since iii increases total DM intake, supplies highly degradable N
   to the rumen and appears to increase the microbial N supply to the small
   intestine of sheep.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing of forest vertical structure is possible with lidar data,
   but lidar is not widely available. Here we map tropical dry forest
   height (RMSE =0.9 m, R-2 = 0.84, range 0.6-7 m), and we map foliage
   height profiles, with a time series of Landsat and Advanced Land Imager
   (ALI) imagery on the island of Eleuthera, The Bahamas, substituting time
   for vertical canopy space. We also simultaneously map forest disturbance
   type and age. We map these variables in the context of avian habitat
   studies, particularly for wintering habitat of an endangered
   Nearctic-Neotropical migrant bird, the Kirtland's Warbler (Dendroica
   kirtlandii). We also illustrate relationships between forest vertical
   structure, disturbance type and counts of forage species important to
   the Kirtland's Warbler. The ALI imagery and the Landsat time series are
   both critical to the result for forest height, which the strong
   relationship of forest height with disturbance type and age facilitates.
   Also unique to this study is that seven of the eight image time steps
   are cloud-cleared images: mosaics of the clear parts of several cloudy
   scenes. We created each cloud-cleared image, including a virtually
   seamless ALI image mosaic, with regression tree normalization. We also
   illustrate how viewing time series imagery as red-green-blue composites
   of tasseled cap wetness (RGB wetness composites) aids reference data
   collection for classifying tropical forest disturbance type and age. Our
   results strongly support current Landsat Program production of
   co-registered imagery, and they emphasize the value of seamless time
   series of cloud-cleared imagery. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Effects of iodine (1) supplementation on performance of intact and

   studied in fourteen 2-year-old goats (six intact and eight castrated
   bucks) for 210 days. Goats were initially assigned to one of the two
   dietary treatments (0 or 0.1 mg supplemental iodine) in a 2 x 2
   factorial design. Concentrate supplement contained 35\% mustard cake,
   which was fed along with oat hay ad libitum. A metabolic trial conducted
   180 days after the experimental feeding revealed no effect of I on the
   digestibility of the organic nutrients. Castrated animals, however,

   and ME (379.0 versus 300.7 kJ) were increased (P < 0.05) due to I
   supplementation, but not the CP or DCP intakes. Retention of N, Ca and P
   were similar irrespective of I level or castration. Average daily gain
   of the goats at the end of 210 days of study was higher (P < 0.01) in
   the I supplemented (25.5 g) than non-supplemented (10.9g) goats. DM
   intake also improved (P < 0.01) because of provision of extra iodine
   (556.2 versus 448.9g per day). Serum triiodothyronine concentration was
   similar between the groups, I supplementation increased (P < 0.01) serum
   thyroxine from 21.43 to 29.72 ng ml(-1) with a concomitant reduction (P
   < 0.01) in serum cholesterol. Semen quality of bucks assessed at the end

   physical seminal attributes, viz. volume, motility, concentration and
   number of spermatozoa/ejaculate due to extra iodine, with a concurrent
   improvement in serum testosterone (1.75 versus 0.47 ng ml(-1)). Overall,

Abstract = {The IITA in its research for sustainable soil fertility management has
   passed through several stages during which legume-based systems were
   always at the forefront. Alley cropping has N yields of more than 200 kg
   ha(-1) with 50\% N-2 fixation. In the case of Mucuna cover cropping, the
   ecological benefit was unequivocal, with more than 100 kg ha(-1) of N-2
   fixed and consistently positive effects on crop yields. But adoption by
   farmers has been too low to bring the benefit of BNF to farm households.
   Based on these experiences, we have proposed increased emphasis on
   systems based on cowpea and soybean rotation because of their high
   adoptability although the benefits to the soil are small compared with
   Mucuna fallows and alley farming. Besides high protein grain production,
   cowpea and soybean rotation reduced densities of Striga hermonthica by
   50\% in farmer-managed trials and increased net benefits to farmers.
   Cover cropping and agroforestry systems can also be used for soil
   fertility management, but only if their adoptability increases by
   providing products needed by farmers.},

Abstract = {Trees have a different impact on soil properties than annual crops,
   because of their longer residence time, larger biomass accumulation, and
   longer-lasting, more extensive root systems. In natural forests
   nutrients are efficiently cycled with very small inputs and outputs from
   the system. In most agricultural systems the opposite happens.
   Agroforestry encompasses the continuum between these extremes, and
   emerging hard data is showing that successful agroforestry systems
   increase nutrient inputs, enhance internal flows, decrease nutrient
   losses and provide environmental benefits-when the competition for
   growth resources between the tree and the crop component is well
   managed. The three main determinants for overcoming rural poverty in
   Africa are (i) reversing soil fertility depletion, (ii) intensifying and
   diversifying land use with high-value products, and (iii) providing an
   enabling policy environment for the smallholder farming sector.
   Agroforestry practices can improve food production in a sustainable way
   through their contribution to soil fertility replenishment. The use of
   organic inputs as a source of biologically-fixed nitrogen, together with
   deep nitrate that is captured by trees: plays a major role in nitrogen
   replenishment. The combination of commercial phosphorus fertilizers with
   available organic resources may be the key to increasing and sustaining
   phosphorus capital. High-value trees-'Cinderella' species-can fit in
   specific niches on farms, thereby making the system ecologically stable
   and more rewarding economically, in addition to diversifying and
   increasing rural incomes and improving food security. In the most
   heavily populated areas of East Africa, where farm size is extremely
   small, the number of trees on farms is increasing as farmers seek to
   reduce labour demands, compatible with the drift of some members of the
   family into the towns to earn off-farm income. Contrary to the concept
   that population pressure promotes deforestation, there is evidence that
   demonstrates that there are conditions under which increasing tree
   planting is occurring on farms in the tropics through successful
   agroforestry as human population density increases.},

Abstract = {Oak (Quercus spp.) afforestation in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial
   Valley has involved planting 1-year-old bareroot seedlings on a
   relatively wide spacing in single-species stands or planting
   light-seeded species with oaks to form mixed-species stands. In the
   former case, the developing single-species stands have limited future
   management options because they do not provide structures that favor
   quality wildlife habitat or quality sawtimber production. In the latter
   case, species mixtures are being planted with little knowledge of
   subsequent stand development, leading to an inability to predict future
   stand composition for management purposes. In this article, we present a
   system to determine bottomland tree planting mixtures that will create
   single-cohort, mixed-species stands with a component of high-quality
   bottomland oak. Using individual species ecological life-history
   characteristics, such as early height growth pattern, relative twig
   diameter and durability, and developmental patterns in natural stands,
   bottomland species are rated for their ability to provide beneficial
   training effects that will lead to the development of quality oak boles.
   Incorporating such a system to determine species value in mixtures
   should provide an increased number of future options to meet explicit
   management objectives and promote improved restoration of bottomland
   hardwood ecosystems.},

Abstract = {A field experiment was established at Port-Bouet in Cote d'Ivoire (West
   Africa) on quaternary coastal sandy soils in order to test the effects
   of rhizobial inoculation and soil fertility on the growth of Acacia
   mangium and the percentage of atmospheric N-2 fixed by this species.
   Three inoculation treatments, all replicated in three blocks having
   different fertility levels, were tested within a complete randomized
   block design. Twenty-one months after transplanting to the field, we
   observed a positive effect of the inoculation with the Bradyrhizobium
   strain Aust13c on tree growth in all blocks with an overall significant
   increase of 10\% in height and 15\% in diameter compared to trees
   inoculated with the Bradyrhizobium strain CB756 or uninoculated control
   trees, the two latter treatments being not significantly different. The
   gradient of fertility determined by a soil analysis and observed from
   block to block had a significant effect on tree growth as well.
   Concomitantly, the total nitrogen content (\%N) measured in sampled A.
   mangium leaves did not vary according to the block or inoculation
   treatment. In contrast, the \%N contained in leaves of inter-planted
   Eucalyptus urophylla, which were used as non-N-2-fixing reference trees
   for the measurement of nitrogen fixation, decreased gradually from block
   I to III and proportionally to a decline in the different forms of soil
   N and other elements. The percentage of nitrogen derived from
   atmospheric N-2 (\%Ndfa), estimated by comparing the natural N-15
   abundance (delta(15)N) in A. mangium leaves with that of inter-planted
   E. urophylla, varied greatly and ranged from 19 to 91\%, according to
   the block and inoculation treatments. The \%Ndfa calculated in the
   inoculation treatments Aust13c, CB756 and uninoculated controls reached
   62, 55, and 41\% respectively, all blocks combined. On the other hand,
   combining all inoculation treatments, \%Ndfa was found to reach a mean
   of about 65\% in each of the two least fertile blocks (blocks II and
   III) while with 27\%, it was 2.4 times lower in trees located in the
   most fertile block (block I). This study shows that the N-2-fixing
   potential of A. mangium, which is subject to large variations within a
   relatively restricted area, is mostly due to the gradient of fertility
   observed. The quantification of total N fixed per tree remains to be
   determined in further in situ studies to explain the positive effect of
   inoculation with Aust13c strain on A. mangium growth. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {Torrefied biomass is a commercial fuel, which is particularly produced

   Response surface methodology using Box-Behnken design was employed for

   was the most effective parameter for the six responses (higher heating
   value, carbon content, hydrogen/carbon and oxygen/carbon ratios, mass
   loss, and energy yield). Besides, temperature/bulk density interaction
   was found to be significant for all responses whereas residence
   time/bulk density interaction was effective for process yields. The
   optimization results showed that more economical torrefied biomass with
   similar quality of lignite could also be produced under process
   conditions of 305 degrees C-32 minutes-158 kgm(-3). At this point,
   higher heating value and carbon content of product were calculated as

Abstract = {Alley-cropping has successively been overestimated and despised, due to
   unrealistic expectations of this `more natural' type of agriculture and
   the disappointment thereafter, when the negative effects of trees on
   crops became evident over time. In this paper we examine the performance
   and underlying mechanisms of a Calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus
   Meissn.)-maize (Zea mays L.) alley-cropping system on a phosphorus (P)
   limiting ferralsol in Western Kenya. The system performance analysis

   International Conference on Ecophysiology of Intercropping. INRA, Paris,
   France, pp. 45-66] and {[}Agric. Ecosyst. Environ. 80 (2000) 87] were
   used as well as mechanistic research into availability, uptake and
   balances of below ground resources. The Calliandra-maize system
   performed worse than sole maize (I = -66\%, according to Ong's method)
   Calliandra affected the less limiting resource nitrogen (N) positively,
   but the negative effect of Calliandra on P-availability, the main
   limitation of the environment outweighed the positive or fertility
   effect, according to Kho's performance analysis method. However, after P
   application, when the main limiting resource for maize in our
   environment shifted to N, the Calliandra had still only a marginal
   positive effect on maize yields (insignificant 5\% increase of
   alley-cropping compared to sole maize). this was explained by a negative
   total N balance in the soil of -30 kg ha(-1), and a negative inorganic N
   balance in the soil of -277 kg ha(-1) over the seven seasons. The
   difference between total and inorganic N balance was due to a
   mineralisation of only 20\% of the N in all the Calliandra mulch applied
   over the seven seasons. Net negative nutrient balances also explain the
   general trend of decreasing yields of 40-90\% over the seven seasons. We
   conclude that the combination of Ong's simpled method, Kho's
   resource-base explanation and further investigation of long-term supply
   and availability of the resources that are the main limitation(s) of an
   environment can give an understanding needed to create productive and
   sustainable alley-cropping systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Cyanogenic glycosides are anti-nutritional components capable of
   liberating hydrogen cyanide, a respiratory poison that has been reported
   to be responsible for the death of livestock that browse some Acacia
   species containing these compounds. The objective of the study was to
   improve the nutritive value of the pods of Acacia sieberiana by reducing
   their contents of cyanogenic glycosides through ensiling, and to examine
   the influence of various levels of added molasses and urea on the
   aerobic stability of the silage. In experiment 1, laboratory silages,
   prepared by mixing ground pods with water in two ratios (60:40 and 40:60
   w/w pod material:water), were put into 250ml polythene bottles, ensiled
   for 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 or 35 days and analyzed for cyanide. In experiment
   2, silages prepared as described above but using only one of the ratios
   (40:60), and with the addition of molasses (0, 30 or 60 g kg(-1)) and
   urea (0, 2.5 or 50 g kg(-1)) were included in a 3 x 3 factorial design,
   to study the effects of these additives on the stability of the silage.
   The period of ensilage was 14 days. In experiment 3, the concentrations
   of molasses and urea were modified to 0, 45 or 90 g kg(-1) and 0, 7.5 or
   15 g kg(-1), respectively, and the period of ensilage was extended to 45
   days. The parent material contained 130.6 mg CN kg(-1) DM and ensiling
   the material for 35 days reduced the concentration to 18.1 mg CN kg(-1)
   DM. Moisture content at ensiling significantly (P < 0.001) affected the
   concentration of cyanide in the stored silages. Silages opened after 14
   days were unstable irrespective of the use of additives. However those
   with combined urea and molasses exhibited a slow rate of deterioration
   and low fungal counts. Extending the period of ensiling to 45 days
   improved the aerobic stability of all the silages. The addition of urea
   significantly (P < 0.001) increased the pH, crude protein content, gross
   energy and fermentation acids while molasses treatment increased (P <
   0.001) the lactic acid and ash content of the silages. Ensiling ground
   pods for 45 days was enough to reduce the cyanide content to non-toxic
   levels and produced a silage which was aerobically stable, while the
   inclusion of additives further improved the quality of the silages. (C)

   Two Friesian cows fitted with 10-cm-diameter rumen cannulae on a

   cowpea showed the highest (p < 0.05) level of degradability of amino
   acid followed by silverleaf desmodium and then velvet bean. Readily and
   slowly degradable components in all amino acids were highest (p < 0.05)

Abstract = {Physical dormancy (impermeability of seed coats to water) is related to
   histological features of the seed coat. This mechanism has ecological
   importance since it determines the time and space of germination. The
   aim of the present study was to compare the histology and impermeability
   of the seed coat in five Neotropical Acacia species from xerophytic
   forests of central Argentina: Acacia aroma, A. coven, A. atramentaria,
   A. gilliesii and A. praecox. An imbibition experiment was performed to
   determine the presence or absence of physical dormancy. Seed coat
   structure was studied through histochemical analysis. The seeds of A.
   gilliesii and A. praecox were treated with ammonium ferrous sulfate to
   identify the sites of water entry. Acacia aroma, A. coven and A.
   atramentaria exhibited physical dormancy; the seed coat was very thick
   and compact, with a wide, sclerified parenchyma and a ``water gap{''}
   for water uptake. Seed coat impermeability in these species was mainly
   attributed to characteristics of the lignified epidermis. By contrast,
   A. gilliesii and A. praecox did not have physical dormancy and showed
   thin seed coats with a much narrower sclerified parenchyma. Water
   entered the seeds of A. gilliesii and A. praecox not only through the
   hilar zone but also through the entire surface of the seed coat.
   Differences in the seed coat structure among species could be related to
   different regenerative responses to environmental conditions that would
   facilitate the coexistence of these Acacia species in the xerophytic
   forests of Cordoba, Argentina. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {In Sudanian region of Africa, agricultural systems are under increasing
   pressure because of human and animal population growth, climate changes,
   extensive practises, decreasing prices for cash crops, etc.
   Possibilities of intensification in smallholder fanning systems of the
   Borgou region in Benin are limited due to difficulties to pay for
   external inputs. Therefore, rural communities rely heavily on low input
   technologies to increase crop production and animal feed. Cultivated
   forages are of better-feed quality for ruminants compared to weed
   fallows. Their integration in cropping system through ley pastures has
   the potential to increase not only animal feed availability but also to
   improve soil fertility. This paper reviews some possible grass and
   legume species that can be used for that purpose with a special focus on
   the strengths and weaknesses of the species in terms of soil and climate
   suitability, forage production, nutritive value and soil fertility
   restoration. The choice of one or several among them as leys in pure
   stands or mixed forage crops must be taken carefully considering the
   balance between advantages and disadvantages of the species, the
   available financial and technical inputs and the adaptation to the local

Abstract = {Two native shrubs (Piliostigma reticulatum and Guiera senegalensis)
   commonly coexist with crops in fields throughout the Sahel but
   aboveground residue is annually coppiced and burned. An alternative
   with, potential to improve soil quality, would be non-thermal return of
   residues to soils but information is needed on the potential of
   residues' to provide nutrients before such systems can be adopted. The
   objective of this research was to characterize carbon (C), net nitrogen
   (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization of shrub residues during
   decomposition in soil beneath or outside shrub canopies. Two lab
   incubation (30 degrees C for 118 days) studies (1 for each shrub
   species/soil type system) had a 2 by 4 factorial design with two soil
   sources (beneath or outside the shrub canopy) and four residue soil
   amendments (leaf, leaf+stem, beef manure, or control of soil only).
   Soils amended with P. reticulatum or G. senegalensis leaf residues
   immobilized N during the first 62 and 76 days, respectively, but later
   had net release of inorganic N. The addition of stems to leaf amendments
   for both shrub species resulted in net N immobilization throughout the
   incubation. Manure had positive but shrub residues negative release of
   inorganic R However if the leached P, released at time zero is included
   in the summation, all amendments released more P than the control.
   Cumulative net release of C, N or P over the incubation was higher in
   soil originating from beneath than outside the shrub canopy except for
   release of P from soil associated with G. senegalensis. Residue
   chemistry was related to nutrient release, particularly high lignin
   content of stems, which corresponded to N immobilization. Our results
   suggest that none of the shrub residues when added to soil would
   potentially provide short-term plant available N and that additional
   fertilizer would be required for optimal crop yield. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {This study was conducted to assess the effect of greenleaf desmodium
   (Desmodium intortum) and sweet potato vine (Ipomoea batatus)
   supplementation of napier grass on dry matter intake, degradation and
   rumen fermentation in Friesian steers. Four fistulated steers were
   offered napier grass diets containing 0, 10, 20 or 30\% desmodium or
   sweet potato vine in two 4 x 4 latin squares. Organic matter intake per
   kg metabolic body weight increased linearly with increasing inclusion
   level of desmodium (74-90 g/ kg(075)) and sweet potato vine (78-94
   g/kg(0.75)). Crude protein intake also increased linearly with the
   increase in inclusion level of desmodium (7.6-13.0 g/kg(0.75)) and sweet
   potato vine (7.9-12.9 g/kg(0.75)). Supplementation improved DM
   degradation but did not change rumen pH. Rumen fermentable organic
   matter increased by up to 52\% and 43\% for desmodium and sweet potato
   vine respectively at the highest levels of supplementation. Ammonia
   nitrogen concentrations increased with increasing level of desmodium
   (130-214 mg/l) and sweet potato vine (139-235 mg/l). Inclusion of
   desmodium and sweet potato vine led to small increases in concentrations
   of total and individual volatile fatty acids. It was concluded that the
   two forage supplements could play an important role in improving animal
   performance when napier grass is fed as the basal diet.},

Title = {Pyrolysis of chemically treated corncob for biochar production and its

Abstract = {In this study, corncob was used as raw material for biochar production.
   Slow pyrolysis of corncob was done at different temperatures (400-600
   degrees C) with a constant heating rate of 16 degrees C/min in a quartz
   reactor with the aim to produce biochar. The physicochemical treatment
   of corncob was done to make it suitable for pyrolysis. Chemical
   treatment was done at different o-phosphoric acid to corncob ratio
   (PA/CC) of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.2 for improvement of quality and yield of
   produced biochar. With increasing temperature biochar yield decreased
   but pretreatment showed an increase in the yield. Biochar yield was
   found optimum at PA/CC of 1.0. The FTIR, SEM, TGA and XRF analysis of
   corncob and biochar were done to see the changes before and after
   pyrolysis. Presence of different inorganic elements along with lesser
   H/C and O/C ratios makes biochar as additive for soil amendment. Also
   lesser H/C and O/C ratios and HHV of 19.97 MJ/kg confirms biochar
   suitable as solid fuel. Further application of biochar was examined for
   Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solution as innovative adsorbent in batch
   process with varying parameters such as pH, initial concentration of
   Cr(VI) solution, contact time and adsorbent dose. Maximum removal of
   Cr(VI) was found to be 93\% at pH 2.01, initial Cr(VI) concentration 50
   mg/L, adsorbent dose 10 g/L and equilibrium time of 90 min. Langmuir
   isotherm showed a better fitting model and maximum adsorption capacity
   was 25.69 mg/g. Biochar showed good repeatability by reusing it twice as
   adsorbent for Cr(VI) removal. (c) 2017 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {A Kunitz proteinase inhibitor from Archidendron ellipticum seeds (AeTI)
   was purified and complexed with bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin. The
   stoichiometric stability of AeTI with its interacting proteinases was
   then investigated using spectrophotometric, size exclusion
   chromatography (HPLC system), Western blotting and circular dichroism
   (CD) studies. All the methods were remarkably similar in revealing the
   preference of trypsin over chymotrypsin by AeTI for complex formation.
   Both Western blotting as well as spectrophotometry based assays for
   competition experiments indicated that trypsin displaces chymotrypsin
   from a previously formed AeTI-chymotrypsin complex. Chemical
   modification of lysine and arginine by TNBS and CHD treatments,
   respectively, suggested a lysine as the active site residue and also
   indicated the presence of a single protease-binding site for AeTI. CD of
   native AeTI showed a sharp minimum at 200 nm and deconvolution of the CD
   spectra revealed it to be an unordered protein possessing high
   beta-sheet content. Complex formation of AeTI with trypsin induces a
   fractional switchover of its unordered structure towards the P-sheet
   fraction but lacked any such conversion in the presence of chymotrypsin.
   Prolonged exposure of excess trypsin generates conformational
   modifications both in the secondary and the tertiary structures. (c)

Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {A rapid predictive method based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was
   developed to measure acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber
   (NDF), and acid detergent lignin (ADL) of rice stem materials. A total
   of 207 samples were divided into two subsets, one subset (similar to 136
   samples) for calibration and cross-validation and the other subset for
   independent external validation to evaluate the calibration equations.
   Different mathematical treatments were applied to obtain the best
   calibration and validation results. The highest coefficient of
   determination for calibration (R(2)) and coefficient of determination
   for cross-validation (1-VR) were 0.968 and 0.949 for ADF, 0.846 and
   0.812 for NDF, and 0.897 and 0.843 for ADL, respectively. Independent
   external validation still gave a high coefficient of determination for
   external validation (r(2)) and a low standard error of performance (SEP)
   for the three parameters; the best validation results were SEP 0.933 and
   r(2) = 0.959 for ADIF, SEP = 2.228 and r(2) = 0.775 for NDF, and SEP =
   0.616 and r(2) = 0.847 for ADL, indicating that NIR gave a sufficiently
   accurate prediction of ADF and ADL content of rice material but a less
   satisfactory prediction for NDF. This study suggested that routine
   screening for these forage quality parameters with large numbers of
   samples is possible with NIRS in early-generation selection in
   rice-breeding programs.},

Abstract = {Although rhizobia for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are
   established in most Brazilian soils, understanding of their genetic
   diversity is very poor. This study characterized bean strains from two
   contrasting ecosystems in Brazil, the Northeast Region, with a semi-arid
   climate and neutral soils and the South Region, with a humid.
   subtropical climate and acid soils. Seedlings of the cultivars Negro
   Argel and Apore were used to trap 243 rhizobial isolates from 12 out of
   14 sites. An analysis of ERIC-PCR products revealed enormous
   variability, with 81\% of the isolates representing unique strains
   considering a level of 70\% of similarity. In general, there was no
   effect of either the bean cultivar, or the ecosystem on rhizobial
   diversity. One-hundred and one strains showing genetic relatedness
   (ERIC-PCR) less than 70\% were further analyzed using restriction
   fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16 S rDNA cleaved with five
   restriction enzymes. Twenty-five different profile combinations were
   obtained. Rhizobium etli was the predominant species, with 73 strains
   showing similar RFLP profiles, while 12 other strains differed only by
   the profile with one restriction enzyme. Fifty strains were submitted to
   sequencing of a 16 S rDNA fragment, and 34 clustered with R. etli,
   including strains with RFLP-PCR profiles similar to those species or
   differing by one restriction enzyme. However, other strains differing by
   one or two enzymes were genetically distant from R. etli and two strains
   with identical profiles showed higher similarity to Sinorhizobium
   fredii. Other strains showed higher similarity of bases with R. tropici,
   R. leguminosarum and Mesorhizobium plurifarium, but some strains were
   quite dissimilar and may represent new species. Great variability was
   also verified among the sequenced strains in relation to the ability to
   grow in YMA at 40degreesC, in LB, to synthesize melanin in. vitro, as
   well as in symbiotic performance, including differences in relation to
   the described species, e.g. many R. etli strains were able to grow in LB
   and in YMA at 40 T, and not all R. tropici were able to nodulate
   Leucaena. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   (y4xL and NolX) is controlled by the TTSS of NGR234 and occurs after the
   induction with flavonoids. Polar mutations in two TTSS genes, rhcN and
   the nod-box controlled regulator of transcription y4xl, block the
   secretion of both proteins and strongly affect the ability of NGR234 to
   nodulate a variety of tropical legumes including Pachyrhizus tuberosus

Title = {Patterns in hydraulic architecture from roots to branches in six
   tropical tree species from cacao agroforestry and their relation to wood
   density and stem growth},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {For decades it has been assumed that the largest vessels are generally
   found in roots and that vessel size and corresponding sapwood
   area-specific hydraulic conductivity are acropetally decreasing toward
   the distal twigs. However, recent studies from the perhumid tropics
   revealed a hump-shaped vessel size distribution. Worldwide tropical
   perhumid forests are extensively replaced by agroforestry systems often
   using introduced species of various biogeographical and climatic
   origins. Nonetheless, it is unknown so far what kind of hydraulic
   architectural patterns are developed in those agroforestry tree species
   and which impact this exerts regarding important tree functional traits,
   such as stem growth, hydraulic efficiency and wood density (WD). We
   investigated wood anatomical and hydraulic properties of the root, stem
   and branch wood in Theobroma cacao and five common shade tree species in
   agroforestry systems on Sulawesi (Indonesia); three of these were
   strictly perhumid tree species, and the other three tree species are
   tolerating seasonal drought. The overall goal of our study was to relate
   these properties to stem growth and other tree functional traits such as
   foliar nitrogen content and sapwood to leaf area ratio. Our results
   confirmed a hump-shaped vessel size distribution in nearly all species.
   Drought-adapted species showed divergent patterns of hydraulic
   conductivity, vessel density, and relative vessel lumen area between
   root, stem and branch wood compared to wet forest species. Confirming
   findings from natural old-growth forests in the same region, WD showed
   no relationship to specific conductivity. Overall, aboveground growth
   performance was better predicted by specific hydraulic conductivity than
   by foliar traits and WD. Our study results suggest that future research
   on conceptual trade-offs of tree hydraulic architecture should consider
   biogeographical patterns underlining the importance of anatomical
   adaptation mechanisms to environment.},

Abstract = {The research was conducted at the International Livestock Research
   Institute's Debre Zeit Research Station in Ethiopia. Leucaena pallida
   14203, Sesbania sesban 1198 and Lablab purpureus were grown, harvested
   and dried at the research station. Seventy individually penned Menz ewes
   with a mean initial weight of 18.6 +/- 0.41 kg (mean S.D.) were used in
   a randomized block design experiment that lasted for 6 months.
   Treatments consisted of supplementing ewes with L. pallida 14203 or S.
   sesban 1198 at 0.9\%, 1.2\% or 1.5\% of live weight (LW). L. purpureus,
   offered at 1.2\% of LW was used as a positive control. The basal feed
   tef straw (Eragrostis tef) was offered at 20\% of refusal. Data on feed
   intake, LW gain, reproductive parameters and plasma activities of
   aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK),
   gamma-glutamyletransferase (gamma-GT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
   were collected and analyzed. Graded levels of L. pallida 14203 promoted
   superior intakes of basal feed dry matter (DM) (P < 0.05) supplement and
   total feed DM, CP, higher daily LW gain, higher fecundity (P<0.001) and
   lambing rate (P < 0.01) than graded levels of S. sesban 1198. Intake of
   basal feed DM was higher (P < 0.05) for ewes supplemented with the
   lowest than the highest level of L. pallida 14203. Supplementation with
   S. sesban 1198 than with the same level of either L. pallida 14203 or L.
   purpureus resulted in increased (P < 0.001) plasma activities of the
   assayed enzymes. Ewes supplemented with L. pallida 14203 were heavier (P
   < 0.05) at lambing, had lambs with higher (P < 0.05) daily pre-weaning
   LW gain (first 30 days), and pre-weaning LWs at 10, 20 and 30 days
   compared to those supplemented with the same level of L. purpureus or S.
   sesban 1198. Ewe weight at lambing was positively correlated (P < 0.01)
   with lamb birth weight and pre-weaning lamb LW gain (P < 0.01) for the
   first 30 days after birth. Supplementation with S. sesban 1198 appears
   to interfere with the reproduction of ewes and thus it could be
   considered as unsuitable supplement feed to pregnant ewes for an
   extended period of feeding. The plasma activities of assayed enzymes
   suggest that S. sesban 1198 may contain hepato-toxic anti-nutritive
   factors. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Few studies of adaptability and growth of native legume species have
   been conducted on degraded acid soils. The lack of data for native
   species has often precluded their use in incentive-supported
   reforestation and international agroforestry schemes. A species
   screening trial that included 25 legume species was conducted at three
   abandoned pasture sites in the Atlantic Lowland of Costa Rica. Most of
   the leguminous species were of potential multipurpose value: 8\% were
   exotic N-2-fixing trees, 60\% (some of which were N-2-fixers) were
   indigenous to the region, and 32\% (some of which were N-2-fixers) were
   native to other areas of Costa Rica. Survival (including damage
   indices), growth, tree form and N2-fixing ability were used to evaluate
   species performance. Survival of the majority of the species after 3
   years was high. Pithecellobium idiopodum, Inga edulis, Albizia
   guachapele, Pithecellobium elegans and Dalbergia retusa had greater than
   90\% survival at all sites. There were significant differences in growth
   measures among species. Across sites Acacia mangium, Stryphnodendron
   microstachyum and Inga edulis produced the greatest stem volume, and A.
   mangium, I. edulis, P. idiopodum and S.microstachyum had the highest
   crown volume. Inga edulis, P. idiopodum, I. coruscans and P. macroloba
   failed to form straight single stems. Acetylene reduction assay at Site
   3 showed that I. edulis, A. mangium, A. guichapele, and I. coruscans had
   the highest nitrogenase activity among the best growing species. This
   trial indicates that there are native leguminous species with excellent
   potential for reforestation and agroforestry on acid soils high in
   aluminum and manganese. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   livestock industry since the advent of civilization. Aim of the present
   study was to collect and systematically document the traditional
   knowledge of poisonous plants of Bajaur District for the benefit of
   humanity before it is entombed forever. Data was collected through
   semi-structured interviews from the community members and local
   herbalists. The reported plants were collected post interviews and later
   on pressed on herbarium vouchers for reference. Afterwards, the data was
   analyzed through Use value (UV) and Informant consensus factors (Fic) A
   total of 66 toxic plants were listed from the study site. Most dominant
   toxic families were Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Solanaceae, Apocynaceae and
   Euphorbiaceae. Most of the poisonous plants were herbs (53.03\%), shrub
   (28.78\%) and tree (18.18\%) and the leaves toxicity was reported to be
   the highest (21.88\%). And the whole plant toxicity was the highest
   (18.75\%), followed by seed toxicity (14.58\%), According to the factor
   informant consensus; gastrointestinal category had the greatest
   agreement closely followed by the death category. The most important
   species on the basis of fidelity level for the death category are Nerium
   oleander L, Ricinus communis L., Euphorbia helioscopia L., Narcissus
   tazetta L. In the dermatological category, the most important species
   were Calotropis procera (Aiton) W.T.Aiton, Datura stramonium L.,
   Erigeron canadensis L., Datura stramonium L., and Solanum incanum L. The
   most important species of fever category were Pteridium aquilinum (L.)
   Kuhn, Tulipa clusiana Redoute, Similarly the valuable species for the
   category Gastrointestinal disorders were Ricinus an important
   contribution towards the preservation of indigenous toxic plants' based
   knowledge. Hence, this is an opportunity to investigate such plants
   pharmacologically and toxicologically studies are required to ascertain
   the toxic components of the poisonous plants, so that they may be
   utilized for the betterment of future generations.},

Title = {Insight into the kinetic analysis of catalytic combustion for biomass
   after alkaline metals loaded pretreatment},
Journal = {FUEL},

Volume = {203},

Abstract = {Biomass combustion was important for a wide range of scientific and
   industrial processes, and played a key role in biomass utilization. This
   study was aimed to research the catalytic combustion kinetics of biomass
   after alkali metals (AM) loaded pretreatment. Firstly, this paper
   investigated the behavior of catalytic combustion for biomass after AM
   loaded pretreatment. Without considering the evaporation of moisture,
   the thermal events of catalytic combustion for biomass could be divided
   into two mass loss steps. The first process was the loss of volatile
   compounds and the formation of semi-coke. The second process was
   volatile compounds and the semi-coke were oxidized, and released a lot
   of heat. Secondly, this paper evaluated the performance of catalytic
   combustion for different kinds of AM. With the increment of AM loading
   ratio, the initial pyrolysis temperatures reduced, whereas the
   devolatilization index, the comprehensive combustibility index, the
   semi-coke yield index and the differential thermal peak area showed an
   opposite variation trend. Additionally, at the same concentration, the
   same kind of AM had different catalytic influences on various type of
   biomass. Thirdly, this paper established the kinetic model to described
   the catalytic combustion for biomass after AM loaded, which accurately
   described catalytic combustion for biomass after AM loaded. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The effect of feeding different levels of foliage from Erythrina
   variegata on the performance of growing goats was studied using a local
   breed (Ma T'ou) with an average initial body weight of 11.2 kg (SD =
   0.9). Twenty-four animals were allocated to a randomized design, with
   six animals (three males and three females) per treatment. The
   treatments were four different levels of replacement of the diet crude
   protein (CP) with CP from Erythrina foliage (EF) at 0 \% (E-0), 20 \%
   (E-20), 40 \% (E-40), and 60 \% (E-60). There were no significant
   differences in the dry matter (DM) intake between treatments, but total
   CP intake was significantly higher in the goats fed the diet E-60
   compared to E-20 (61.1 and 51.4 g/day, respectively). The average daily
   liveweight gain of the goats did not differ between treatments and
   ranged from 51 to 63 g/day. Sixteen animals were kept in metabolism
   cages for a digestibility study and given with the same four diets as in
   the main experiment. The digestibility of DM, organic matter, neutral
   detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber was significantly higher for
   diet E-60 than for E-0. Neither the apparent digestibility of CP and N
   retention nor carcass characteristics (16 animals) differed with an
   increase in the level of CP from EF in the diets. In conclusion, CP from
   EF can replace up to 60 \% of CP from a mixed diet with soybean meal
   without any negative effect on the growth in goats.},

Abstract = {The Dry Chaco region is a vast plain that extends throughout
   north-western Argentina. This region concentrates about 13\% of the
   total Argentine cattle national stock. Beef cattle systems in the
   north-west of Argentina are highly varied including extensive pastoral
   systems, silvopastoral systems and intensive grazing systems. Little is
   known about the impact of these systems on microbial biodiversity and
   soil quality in this region. This study describes the relationship
   between soil parameters (FDA, MBC, SOC, CFU, pH, TN and MR) and
   bacterial communities in silvopastoral systems (SPS) of the Argentine
   Dry Chaco region. The bacterial composition, evaluated through Illumina
   MiSeq sequencing of ribosomal 16S amplicons, differed between SPS and
   pastoral systems, being also influenced byLeucaenaandProsopistree
   species. Higher diversity of bacterial populations was detected in SPS
   withProsopis. The phylum Firmicutes and Bacilli class were the most
   abundant in all the treatments. As indicated by Mantel tests, changes in
   soil bacteria community were related to soil parameters (e.g. SOC and
   pH). SPSs are viable alternatives for improving soil quality, supported
   by a significant increase in microbial biomass and activity in
   comparison with pastoral systems. Furthermore, the different livestock
   systems strongly affected microbiomes. Overall, the results of the
   present study suggest that soil bacterial populations are involved in
   nutrient cycling processes in SPSs of the Argentine Dry Chaco. Further,
   the composition of soil bacterial communities was related to the
   analysed soil parameters and tree species.},

Journal = {BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {38-44},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an attractive technology in tropical regions
   for converting locally abundant biomass wastes into biogas which can be
   used to produce heat, electricity, and transportation fuels. However,
   investigations on AD of tropical forestry wastes, such as albizia
   biomass and food wastes, such as taro, papaya, and sweet potato, are
   limited. In this study, these tropical biomass wastes were evaluated for
   biogas production by liquid AD (L-AD) and/or solid-state AD (SS-AD),
   depending on feedstock characteristics. When albizia leaves and chips
   were used as feedstocks, L-AD had greater methane yields (161 and 113 L
   kg (1) VS, respectively) than SS-AD (156.8 and 59.6 L kg (1) VS,
   respectively), while SS-AD achieved 5-fold higher volumetric methane
   productivity than L-AD. Mono-digestion and co-digestion of taro skin,
   taro flesh, papaya, and sweet potato achieved methane yields from 345 to
   411 L kg (1) VS, indicating the robustness of AD technology. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Characteristic and antioxidant activity of the extracts from freshwater
   macroalgae (C. glomerata) as influenced by extraction media, i.e., water
   or ethanol (20-100\%, v/v) were studied. The highest yield (28.0\%) was
   obtained when water was used. Ethanolic extracts had significantly lower
   yields (2.98-15.5\%) (P<0.05). However, total phenolic and chlorophyll
   contents were lower in water extract. Among all extracts, the 60\%
   ethanolic extract (E60) had the highest antioxidant activities,
   including DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities, ferric reducing
   antioxidant power and metal chelating activity. Based on LC/MS of E60,
   quercetin, isoquercetin and hydroquinin were the major phenolic
   compounds. When E60 at different levels (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) were
   added to eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis) slices, the reduction
   in lipid oxidation was dose-dependent (P<0.05) as shown by smaller
   increases in peroxide and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances
   (TBARS) values, compared to the control. Therefore, C. glomerata could

Abstract = {Changes in the seed coat morphology of 12 annual legumes were studied
   using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). The seeds of
   Biserrula pelecinus L. cv. Casbah, Ornithopus sativus cv. Cadiz,
   Trifolium clypeatum L., T. spumosum L., T. subterraneum L. cv. Bacchus
   Marsh, Trigonella balansae Boiss. \& Reuter., Trigonella monspeliaca L.
   and Vicia sativa subsp. amphicarpa Dorthes (morthes.) were examined by
   ESEM after exposure to field conditions for 6 months, while those of
   Medicago polymorpha L. cv. Circle Valley, Trifolium clypeatum L., T.
   glanduliferum Boiss., T. lappaceum L., T. spumosum L., and T.
   subterraneum L. cv. Dalkeith, were examined after 2 years' exposure. The
   entry of water into seeds was followed by covering various parts of the
   seed coat with petroleum jelly and soaking the treated seeds in dyes.
   As the seeds softened over time, more and larger fractures appeared on
   the seed coat. Water entered the seed either through fractures, over the
   seed coat as a whole or through the lens. It is hypothesized that the
   formation of fractures occurs after physicochemical changes in the seed
   coat, probably associated with changes in the amount and nature of seed
   coat lipids.
   The newly matured whole seeds of M. polymorpha cv. Circle Valley, T.
   clypeatum, T. glanduliferum, T. lappaceum, T. spumosum, and T.
   subterraneum cv. Dalkeith were analysed for lipid content in 1997. The
   seed coats of T. subterraneum cv. Dalkeith and T. spumosum were
   separated from the cotyledons and examined in detail for lipid content.
   The lipid content of whole seeds ranged from 48 (T. lappaceum) to 167
   mg/g (T. subterraneum cv. Dalkeith). Total lipid of the whole seeds of
   T. subterraneum cv. Dalkeith and T. glanduliferum declined by about 9
   mg/g over 2 years, while in T. spumosum it declined by about 17 mg/g.
   In contrast, the major fatty acids in the seed coat declined by 0.67
   mg/g over the 2 years. Change in seed coat lipids showed a marked
   similarity to changes in hardseededness for both T. subterraneum cv.
   Dalkeith and T. spumosum. The results strongly suggest that seed
   softening is associated with loss of lipids in the seed coat, because
   lipids have physical characteristics that are altered at temperatures
   experienced in the field.},

Abstract = {The importance of finding alternative materials to remediation of
   natural and waste waters is undoubted nowadays. The search for
   inexpensive and renewable substances that could grab metal ions and
   safely return the used waters to be used again is a matter of great
   importance. The properties of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) renewable,
   inexpensive and water soluble biopolymer, in the absence and in the
   presence of some metal ions that have varying industrial applications,
   are reported in this work.
   Potentiometric and ultraviolet-visible titrations were performed in
   aqueous solutions of CMC in the absence and in the presence of Cu2+,
   VO2+ and Mo6+ obtaining the values of the logarithms of the binding
   constants (stepwise formation constants) considering the complexation
   towards the monomeric sugar repeating units of CMC (HL) as follows,
   10.63 +/- 0.08, 12.08 +/- 0.02 and 15.89 +/- 0.03 for ML, when M was
   Cu2+, VO2+ and Mo6+, respectively. For ML2, the calculated values were
   8.54 +/- 0.08 and 9.1 +/- 0.1 for Cu2+ and VO2+, respectively. Other
   binding constants were detected and their values calculated. The
   quantitatively obtained infrared spectra of the solids precipitated from
   aqueous systems revealed decreasing intensity in the -OH and -COOH bands
   as the pH values of the solution in which the solids were obtained were
   raised. These results matched the species distribution diagrams obtained
   in the aqueous studied systems. Also the solids were inspected for their
   thermal behavior and the results showed a more thermally stable complex
   species than the CMC alone. Scanning Electron Microscopy showed stable,
   compact and homogeneous films. CMC will be employed as a remediation
   agent in different aqueous solutions containing metal ions and the
   results will be released soon. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {161},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted at the Coconut Research Institute in
   Sri Lanka to examine the biological nitrogen fixation potential of three
   Gliricidia sepium provenances (OFI 14/84, 17/84, 12/86) and a local
   landrace (designated LL), using the N-15 isotope dilution method. There
   was marked variation in dry matter, total N, nodulation and N-15
   enrichment among the Gliricidia genotypes (= 0.001), and the dry matter
   yield of Cassia siamea (syn. Senna siamea), the non-N-2 fixing reference
   plant was higher than for G. sepium. In all cases, highest biomass and
   total N were aboveground, with roots on average accounting for < 20 \%
   of total dry matter or the total N in plants. Atom \% N-15 excess was
   highest in C. siamea, and lowest in OFI 14/84. Although atom \% N-15
   excess was lower in Gliricidia leaves than in the other organs (all of
   which had similar N-15 enrichments), values of \% N derived from
   atmospheric N-2 fixation ( \% Ndfa) calculated for any individual organ
   or for the whole plant were similar. This was because the relative
   distribution of N-15 in the different parts of the fixing plant followed
   the same trend as in the reference plant. There were significant
   differences (p,= 0.01) in N-2 fixation between the Gliricidia genotypes.
   The values ranged from 17.8 g M tree(-1) (equivalent to 86 kg N ha(-1)
   at 5000 trees ha(-1)) in OFI 12/86 to 61.7g N tree(-1) (equivalent to
   309 kg N ha(-1)) in OFI 14/84. Although most of this variability was due
   to differences in both \% Ndfa and total N in plant, amount of N fixed
   was more correlated with total N in plant (r = 0.935) than with \% Ndfa
   (r = 0.707). On average, \% Ndfa in all three G. sepium provenances and
   LL was about 55 \% or 34.6 g N tree(-1) (equivalent to some 166 kg N
   ha(-1)) in the 9 months within which N-2 fixation was measured. This
   represents a substantial contribution of N into the soil-plant system.},

Abstract = {The introduction of trees that symbiotically fix atmospheric nitrogen is
   widely acknowledged as one of the most efficient means to sustain the
   productivity of agrosystems through the improvement of the soil nitrogen
   balance, especially in the tropics. Nevertheless, very few research
   programs specifically focus on this topic. Quite varied results have
   been obtained on fixed-nitrogen enrichment of the soil and use of this
   nitrogen to fertilize annual intercrops. The N-2-fixing potential of
   tree species is often low or inhibited by environmental constraints such
   as drought, salinity, and excess mineral nitrogen or plant diseases. The
   symbiotic bacteria/host tree association could possibly be improved
   through plant biotechnology and genetic engineering research. Symbiotic
   nitrogen fixation could also be optimized by modifying current
   agricultural practices. Nitrogen-fixing trees can be intercropped or not
   with other annual crops in various conditions, e.g. hedges, bush fallows
   and long-term rotations. Such management programs should be better
   integrated in rural environments through the promotion of multipurpose
   species producing wood and high-protein livestock fodder as well as
   edible fruits or seeds.},

Abstract = {Assessments of the efficiency of grazing systems, in terms of
   productivity and ecological sustainability, are necessary in view of the
   increased demand for animal protein. In this study, the methane (CH4)
   emissions (sniffer methodology), dry matter (DM) yield, paddock chemical
   composition (AOAC and Van Soest methods), nutrient intake (dry matter,
   DMI; crude protein, CPI; metabolizable energy, MEI), daily milk yield
   (DMY), body condition score (BCS), and body weight (BW) of cattle, in
   intensive silvopastoral systems (ISPSs) and monoculture systems (MSs),
   in the tropics of Mexico were evaluated. In the ISPS, CH4 emissions
   (18\% less) and DMY were lower than in the MS. Cows from MSs tend to
   disperse across higher values of CH4 emissions per kg of DMI, as well as
   higher milk production, while cows from the ISPS were dispersed over a
   higher intake (DMI, CPI, and MEI) and lower CH4 emissions. There were no
   differences between systems in paddock DM yield, chemical composition,
   cows' BCS, and BW, regardless of whether it was the dry (April to May)
   and rainy (September to October) season. Based on the results obtained
   in this study, ISPSs contribute to the mitigation of methane emissions
   in cattle; forage and animal production variables in both systems were
   similar, with a lower use of imported inputs in the ISPS.},

Abstract = {Supplementation of basal diets with multipurpose trees (MPTs) increases
   essential nutrients available to rumen microbes, increases rate of
   passage of particulate matter by 23-53\% and of liquid matter by 9-43\%.
   Supplementing teff straw with graded levels of cowpea or lablab
   significantly increased microbial N supply in calves. Supplements of
   Sesbania and Chamaecytisus sp, promoted higher N retention compared with
   unsupplemented roughage. The ILRI's work on evaluation of MPTs
   demonstrated that type, form and quantity affect microbe-MPT
   interactions and, consequently, the utilization of the basal diet. Using
   gas production as an index of fermentation, it was shown that
   Chamaecytisus palmensis (Tagasaste) is fermented rapidly while Acacia
   angustissima is fermented slowly by mixed ruminal microbes. Volatile
   fatty acid (VFA) analysis showed that mixed ruminal microbes produced
   most (63.9 mu mol/ml) VFAs from Sesbania sesban while A. angustissima
   fermentation produced the least (15 mu mol/ml) amount at 12 h. Extracts
   of A. angustissima inhibited the growth of pure cultures of rumen
   bacteria (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Prevotella
   ruminicola and Streptococcus bovis). Multipurpose trees affect protozoal
   populations in sheep differently. Sesbania sesban significantly (P <

Title = {A scientometrics analysis of silvopastoral systems: what we know and
   what we need to know?},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},

Abstract = {Silvopastoral systems (SPS) are a sustainable alternative to reduce
   livestock environmental impacts and restore degraded pastures due to
   their higher diversity, increased forage production and quality,
   enhanced soil quality, and C storage. Legume-based silvopastoral systems
   also contribute through biological nitrogen fixation by the legume
   component. In this study we evaluate the scientific production on the
   Web of Science database from 2010 to 2022, with a two-step process.
   First the keywords ``silvopastoral systems{''} were used for an initial
   analysis of the overall literature, followed by ``legume{''} or
   ``enzym{*}{''} or ``microbial communit{*}, yielding more than 870
   papers. The number of publications grew exponentially during the period
   evaluated, and between 2019 and 2022, approximately 63\% of all
   publications occurred. Brazil had the largest number of published
   articles, followed by Mexico, USA, Spain, and Colombia. There was also a
   network of collaborations between institutions in these countries.
   Agriculture is the research area with the most published articles, with
   the most studied topics being management, biodiversity, and nutrient
   dynamics and cycling, especially carbon and nitrogen. However, only nine
   of these studied the soil microbial community and five, the soil
   enzymatic activity. Although these previous studies have observed the
   effect of SPS on important soil indicators, how SPS is used as a
   restoration tool to affect the microbial biomass and activity of
   extracellular enzymes remains poorly understood and is important to
   validate the regeneration strategies. Thus, this article analyzes the
   evolution of publications on this agroecosystem to advance the knowledge
   and sustainability in those segments that are still little studied, such
   as the microbial community and soil enzymatic activity.},

Title = {Phytochemical profile and in vitro evaluation of cassava (Manihot
   esculenta Crantz) foliage as ruminant feed with/without green banana
   flour},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a crucial crop in tropics and
   subtropics, primarily cultivated for its tuber. However, its foliage is
   rich in protein and can supply essential elements for ruminants. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the phytochemical compounds by
   Gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS) and the main phenolic by High Pressure
   Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) present in cassava foliage, along with the
   fermentation pattern using a semi-automated gas production (GP) system.
   The in vitro evaluation was carried out for four diets formulated as
   follows: T1 (alfalfa: grass hay at ratio of 30: 70); T2 (alfalfa: grass
   hay: banana flour 30:60:10); T3 and T4 (replaced alfalfa in T1 and T2
   with cassava foliage, respectively). The addition of green banana flour
   aimed to increase the diets' energy. The GC-MS results indicated that
   cassava foliage showed a large number of valuable bioactive components,
   with the biflavonoid isoginkgetin representing the major component at
   25.33\% of total peak area percentage. The HPLC analysis declared that
   rutin, gallic acid, and ferulic acid were the main phenolic compounds
   presented in cassava foliage ethanolic extract. The accumulative gas
   after 24 h of incubation was significantly lower with cassava diets
   compared to alfalfa diets, being 119.3 versus 130.1 ml/g DM,
   respectively. The degradation of both organic matter and neutral
   detergent fiber was significantly higher with alfalfa compared to
   cassava diets, while there was no significant difference between alfalfa
   and cassava diets on final pH, ammonia concentration and protozoal
   count. Banana flour inclusion, regardless of the forage type, decreased
   the accumulative gas after 24 h of incubation with about 9\% compared
   with no banana addition. The use of cassava foliage in ruminant diets
   considered a promising protein source with valuable bioactive components
   that could have a positive effect on animal health and production.},

Title = {Effects of Replacing Grass with Foliage on Growth Rate and Feed Intake
   in Goats-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Small ruminants such as goats have a higher preference for browse
   species than cattle and sheep. In a meta-analysis of 42 papers
   describing 117 experimental treatments found by a search performed in
   June 2021 in PubMed and Web of Knowledge, we examined the general effect
   of including foliage in the diet of goats, replacing grasses, on dry
   matter intake and average daily weight gain. The inclusion requirement
   for a paper was that it described a controlled trial with a control diet
   of grass and with grass replaced by foliage in the experimental diet.
   Publication bias was estimated by calculating the Fail-safe n. Random
   effects analyses were conducted, using effect size calculated as Hedges'
   d. The results showed that inclusion of foliage increased feed intake
   (Hedges' d = 1.350, SE = 0.388) and average daily weight gain (Hedges' d
   = 1.417, SE = 0.444) compared with a grass-based control. The positive
   effect of foliage inclusion on dry matter intake was associated with
   lower neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and higher crude protein (CP) in the
   foliage than in the grass it replaced. The positive effect on average
   daily weight gain was associated with higher CP concentration in the
   foliage than in grass. Foliage inclusion level showed a quadratic
   relationship with dry matter intake, with maximum dry matter intake
   achieved at a level of 50-60\%. There was wide variation between the
   studies reviewed, and this variation was not reduced by subgroup
   analysis based on different kinds of foliage. In conclusion, the
   addition of foliage to goat diets can increase feed intake and daily
   weight gain, as an effect of the dietary preferences of goats and of
   generally higher nutritional value in foliage species compared with
   natural/semi-natural grass species.},

Abstract = {Currently for the reduction of methane (CH4) emissions are using fodder
   rich in condensed tannins, however, not yet known exactly how they act
   in the rumen is not yet clear. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate the effect of the inclusion of leaves of Prunus salicifolia
   (PS, 0\%, 15\%, and 30\%) on the productive behavior of growing kid
   goats, methane production, nutritional value, fermentation, and ruminal
   digestibility through an in vivo and in vitro study was performed. Diets
   were administered ad libitum to 6 Saanen kids with live weight (LW) of
   12.25 +/- 2.25 kg. Three levels of inclusion were used in a diet based
   on ground corn grain, soybean meal, corn stover, and oat hay in
   substitution with P. salicifolia leaves. The in vivo productive behavior
   was determined, as well as the fermentation kinetics, in vitro gas
   production, CH4 and hydrogen (H-2) in an in vitro system was determined.
   For the in vivo study, we used a 3 x 3 Latin square design in in vivo
   study and an analysis of variance with three replications for in vitro
   gas production. The inclusion of 30\% increased (P = 0.0011) dry matter
   intake (DMI 589.33 g/day) compared to the control group (418.80 g/day).
   The highest N excretion (feces and urine) (P < 0.001) was for T0, in
   addition to presenting a negative nitrogen balance compared with T15 and
   T30. The production of CH4 (mM)/g DM incubated, and CH4 (mM)/g DM
   fermented, CH4 (mM/day), and H-2 was lower (P < 0.05) in T30 than T0 and
   T15. CH4 (mM)/day was lower (P < 0.036) in T130 (283 mM/day) compared
   with T0 (407 mM/day) P. salicifolia is a forage that helps to reduce the
   production of methane and can be included in the diets of growing kid
   goats in amounts less than 30\% without affecting production
   performance.},

Abstract = {In order to inducein vitroaxillary shoot proliferation from single-node
   explants ofRhododendron mucronulatumTurcz., two techniques of
   thidiazuron (TDZ) application were tested: (i) two-step procedure
   including cultivation on Anderson medium (AM) supplemented with varying
   TDZ concentrations (0.1 mu M; 0.25 mu M; 0.5 mu M; 1.0 mu M; 2.5 mu M)
   for 8 wk followed by cultivation on hormone-free medium (AM0) for 6 wk
   and (ii) 4-h liquid-pulse treatment with different TDZ concentrations
   (7.5 mu M, 15.0 mu M, or 30.0 mu M) followed by cultivation on AM0 for 8
   wk. The highest number of axillary shoots per explant was achieved with
   0.1-mu M TDZ after the two-step procedure. The best response in terms of
   percent regeneration (87\%), shoot length (13 mm), absence of structure
   anomalies, and the shortest shoot production cycle (8 wk) was obtained
   with 30.0-mu M TDZ liquid-pulse treatment for 4 h. The clonal fidelity
   of regenerated shoots was evaluated by random amplified polymorphic DNA
   (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers and flow
   cytometry. Genetic similarity of all regenerants between themselves and
   with the mother seedlings was 99\%. Flow cytometric analysis revealed
   that all samples studied were diploid. The nuclear DNA content of
   microshoots obtained under the TDZ treatments varied from 1.26 to 1.32
   pg per 2C. There were no significant differences in DNA content among
   mother seedlings andin vitrodeveloped shoots triggered by 0.1- and
   2.5-mu M TDZ nor by those triggered by the 30.0-mu M TDZ pulse
   treatment.},

   activities and the length of time the animals engaged in each activity
   was measured during the day time (6:00-18:00 h) by visual observations
   at 10-min intervals. The results obtained suggest that buffaloes use
   tree shade to partially supplement wallowing. Feeding behavior increased
   under intense heat stress in the silvopastoral system indicating that it
   can be a promising alternative to improve the buffaloes rearing
   conditions in the tropics.},

Title = {The state of knowledge of freshwater resources in the US Virgin Islands:
   Data scarcity and implications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {60},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1270-1292},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Like many small island communities, the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), an
   unincorporated territory of the U.S., is naturally freshwater scarce. In
   recent decades, rapid land development in the USVI has increased water
   demand considerably, exerting extra pressure on freshwater resources.
   Freshwater quantity and quality data for the USVI are very scarce and
   scattered, which limits freshwater management capabilities. We draw
   attention to this information deficit and discuss its implications by
   reviewing the current state of knowledge of surface and groundwater
   quantity and quality for the USVI. Our review confirms that long-term
   records of surface and groundwater quantity and quality are limited and
   unreliable. For example, streamflow was most recently monitored in 2006,
   and the most extensive surface water quality records are from the 1960s
   and 1980s. Since 2016, mean groundwater levels have been recorded daily,
   but only for three wells (one on each island of the USVI). Importantly,
   this lack of information threatens water security for the territory and
   limits our understanding of how development has impacted water quality
   and availability over time. This could be addressed using models, such
   as a groundwater recharge model, in combination with remote sensing and
   updated field data (i.e., streamflow, groundwater, and ecohydrological
   characterizations of land use change).},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rhizobium-legume symbioses serve as paradigmatic examples for the study
   of mutualism evolution. The genus Ensifer (syn. Sinorhizobium) contains
   diverse plant-associated bacteria, a subset of which can fix nitrogen in
   symbiosis with legumes. To gain insights into the evolution of symbiotic
   nitrogen fixation (SNF), and interkingdom mutualisms more generally, we
   performed extensive phenotypic, genomic, and phylogenetic analyses of
   the genus Ensifer. The data suggest that SNF likely emerged several
   times within the genus Ensifer through independent horizontal gene
   transfer events. Yet, the majority (105 of 106) of the Ensifer strains
   with the nodABC and nifHDK nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes were
   found within a single, monophyletic Glade. Comparative genomics
   highlighted several differences between the ``symbiotic{''} and
   ``nonsymbiotic{''} clades, including divergences in their pangenome
   content. Additionally, strains of the symbiotic Glade carried 325 fewer
   genes, on average, and appeared to have fewer rRNA operons than strains
   of the nonsymbiotic Glade. Initial characterization of a subset of ten
   Ensifer strains identified several putative phenotypic differences
   between the clades. Tested strains of the nonsymbiotic Glade could
   catabolize 25\% more carbon sources, on average, than strains of the
   symbiotic Glade, and they were better able to grow in LB medium and
   tolerate alkaline conditions. On the other hand, the tested strains of
   the symbiotic Glade were better able to tolerate heat stress and acidic
   conditions. We suggest that these data support the division of the genus
   Ensifer into two main subgroups, as well as the hypothesis that
   preexisting genetic features are required to facilitate the evolution of
   SNF in bacteria.},

Abstract = {Pterocarpus officinalis (Fabaceae) dominates in the swamp forests of the
   Lesser Antilles, submitted to strong variations of soil salinity (30-445
   mM). This study aimed to assess the effect of salinity on growth,
   nodulation, N-2 fixation, water status and ions content in P.
   officinalis and to clarify the mechanisms involved. Seedlings inoculated
   or not with two strains from areas of contrasting salinity levels (< to
   50 or 445 mM) were watered with 0, 171 and 342 mM solutions of NaCl in
   greenhouse conditions. Non-inoculated seedlings were tolerant to a
   salinity of 171 mM, with no significant effect on seedling biomass.
   Evapotranspiration per unit of leaf area (E/TLa) remained unchanged at
   171 mM. Maintenance of a constant E/TLa and especially the control of
   ion transport to the upper parts of the plant could explain seedling
   salt tolerance up to intermediate salinity conditions (171 mM). The two
   strains have a 99.8\% genetic identity in spite of differences in their
   original habitats, this explaining the similar response of the symbiosis
   to salinity. The higher salt sensitivity of inoculated seedlings was
   linked to the sensitivity of both Bradyrhizobium strains (reduction of
   free-living cells) and to that of the nodulation process (fewer nodules
   and inhibition of N-2-fixation) to intermediate salinity.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present work was to evaluate milk yield, postpartum (pp)
   ovarian activity and pregnancy rate in dual-purpose cows grazing and
   browsing with or without energy supplementation. Twenty-four x cows were
   divided in two groups from calving to 70 days post-calving: supplemented
   group (SG) with ground sorghum grain offered at 0.4\% of live weight at
   calving and control group (CG) without supplement. There was a trend for
   milk yield (kg day(-1)) to be greater ( = 0.08) for SG (10.55 +/- 0.51)
   compared to CG (9.53 +/- 0.61), although without differences in fat
   (0.42 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.38 +/- 0.03 kg day(-1)), protein (0.29 +/- 0.02 vs.
   0.29 +/- 0.02 kg day(-1)) or lactose (0.49 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.49 +/- 0.03 kg
   day(-1)) concentration. Populations of large, medium and small follicles
   were similar between treatments. Percentage of cows which showed corpus
   luteum tended to be greater in SG (50\%), compared to CG (33\%).
   Supplemented cows tended to have a shorter calving-first corpus luteum
   interval (40 +/- 10 vs. 51 +/- 10 days) and had a significantly higher (
   (2) = 0.03) pregnancy rate (42\% vs. 0\%). It is concluded that energy
   supplementation helped to improve ovarian activity and pregnancy rate.
   Since supplementation did not avoid loss of body condition, the higher
   pregnancy rate in SG suggests beneficial effects of supplementation
   probably mediated by metabolic hormones.},

Abstract = {Two calorimetric experiments were performed to investigate the effects
   of two diets with same concentrate: roughage ratio (70:30) but varying
   in composition on energy metabolism and methane production in faunated
   (F) and defaunated (DF) Muzaffarnagari sheep. For experiment 1. ten
   animals were divided equally into two groups of which one was kept
   normally F as such while other was DF using 10\% sodium lauryl sulphate.
   All the animals, ere offered diet I which comprised of oat ha and
   concentrate mixture I (CM I) containing maize grain (93\%) as a major
   ingredient in 70:30 ratio. Similarly, the experiment II was conducted
   for which four F and four DF sheep (same as used for experiment 1) were
   switched to diet II that consisted of maize hay and CM II (maize grain
   59\% + molasses 36\%). Through diet II, DM intake in DF sheep was
   significantly (p <0.05) lower. Intake of GE through both the diets was
   similar in F and DF sheep. Digestibility of DM, OM, CP and GE and also
   metabolisability (ME/GE) was similar in F and DF sheep on both the
   diets. Total urinary energy loss did not differ in F and DF on both the
   diets. but methane energy loss as a percent of GE in DF was
   significantly (p<0.05) lower on diet 1 (3.75 vs 2.48), while it did not
   differ on diet Il (3.20 vs 3.60). Heat production was significantly
   (p<less than>0.01) reduced in DF on both the diets. Although, efficiency
   of utilisation of ME For maintenance calculated as per ARC ( 1984) did
   not differ in F and DF on both the diets. efficiency for maintenance and
   growth was higher (0.60 vs 0.672) on diet I in DF, It was inferred that
   methane production in DF sheep reduces on good quality hay-based diet
   supplemented with slowly fermentable carbohydrate (maize grain) but
   supplementation of molasses(rap idly fermentable CHO) nullify this
   effect when sheep were fed diets with concentrate: roughage ratio of
   70:30.},

Abstract = {A total of 54 rhizobial strains were isolated from faba bean root
   nodules in 21 counties of Sichuan hilly areas in China, and their
   symbiotic effectiveness, genetic diversity and phylogeny were assessed.
   Only six strains increased the shoot dry mass of the host plant
   significantly (P <= 0.05). Based on the cluster analysis of combined 16S
   rDNA and intergenic spacer region (IGS) PCR-RFLP, the strains were
   divided into 31 genotypes in 11 groups, indicating a high degree of
   genetic diversity among the strains. The sequence analysis of three
   housekeeping genes (atpD, glnll and recA) and 16S rDNA indicated that
   the strains represented two R. leguminosarum, two Rhizobium spp., R.
   mesosinicum, Agrobacterium sp. and A. tumefaciens. The strains
   representing four Rhizobium species were divided into two distinct nodC
   and Will genotypes. However, the phylogeny of housekeeping genes and
   symbiotic genes was not congruent, implying that the strains had been
   shaped by vertical evolution of the housekeeping genes and lateral
   evolution of the symbiotic genes. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {The utilisation of cereal crop residues as animal feed is limited by
   deficiencies of protein, fermentable energy and other nutrients. In this
   study, rumen fermentation and nitrogen metabolism of lambs fed basal
   diets of maize stover harvested at three stages of maturity and
   supplemented with graded levels (0, 150, 300 and 450 g per head per day)
   of desmodium (Desmodium intortum cv Greenleaf) hay were investigated.
   The maize stovers were harvested at 30, 22 and 12\% grain moisture
   content which were designated as stages I, II and III, respectively.
   Rumen ammonia and volatile fatty acids (VFA), nitrogen (N) balance and
   microbial N supply, based on urinary excretion of purine derivatives,
   were determined. The concentration of ammonia-N in rumen fluid was
   significantly lower (P < 0.05) in sheep fed maize stover harvested at
   stage III than at stages I and II and increased significantly (P <
   0.001) with increasing level of supplementation. The total VFA
   concentration and the molar proportions of acetate and butyrate in rumen
   fluid were not significantly influenced (P > 0.05) by the stage of
   maturity of the stover. The total VFA content increased with increasing
   level of supplementation and varied from 64.1 to 113.6 mmol/l of rumen
   fluid. The N intake, N absorbed and N retained decreased with increasing
   stage of maturity of the stover and showed a significant linear increase
   (P < 0.05) with increasing level of supplementation. However, use of
   maize stover as a sole diet resulted in negative N balance at all stages
   of maturity due to the low N content of the stover. Microbial N supply
   was not affected by stage of maturity of the stover while microbial
   efficiency (g/kg digestible organic matter fermented in the rumen) was
   significantly lower (P < 0.05) in sheep fed maize stover harvested at
   stage III than at stages I and II. The microbial N supply increased with
   increasing level of supplementation, presumably due to improved
   degradation of the diet and increased supply of N, fermentable
   carbohydrates, sulphur and probably other essential nutrients. (C) 2000

Title = {Supplementation of a tropical low-quality forage with Calliandra
   calothyrsus improves sheep health and performance, and reduces
   methane emission},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ANIMAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Ruminant production systems in the arid and semi-arid regions of
   Sub-Saharan Africa confront severe challenges due to recurring droughts
   and the intensifying effects of climate change (CC). These systems
   grapple with numerous stress factors, including poor animal nutrition,
   water scarcity, gastrointestinal (GIT) parasite burdens, and heat
   stress, which contribute to below optimal animal productivity and a high
   environmental footprint. Addressing these issues urgently, by creating
   livestock systems resilient to CC that also promote better animal
   health, enhanced productivity, and reduced environmental impact, is
   paramount to safeguarding the livelihoods of the rural population. This
   50-day study aimed to evaluate the effects of improved feeding and
   nutritional management in sheep, focusing on GIT parasite infections,
   feed intake and digestibility, liveweight (LW) gain, and enteric methane
   (CH4) emissions. We investigated the legume forage tree, Calliandra
   (Calliandra calothyrsus), as a high-quality feed source because of its
   rich crude protein content and its potential as a remedy for
   gastrointestinal tract (GIT) parasite infections, attributed to its high
   condensed tannin (CT) content. Twenty-eight Dorper lambs underwent
   random allocation across four treatments, each consisting of seven
   lambs. These treatments combined either a trickle infection or no
   infection with Haemonchus contortus with a supplementation (40\% of diet
   on a dry matter basis or lack thereof) of the basal diet (Rhodes grass
   hay) with dried Calliandra leaflets. The treatments were: UnHay
   (uninfected, fed on hay-only), InHay (infected, fed on hay-only),
   InHay+Cal (infected, fed on hay plus Calliandra), and InHay+Cal+PEG
   {[}infected, fed on hay, Calliandra, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)]. The
   latter was to evaluate the potential effects of Calliandra's condensed
   tannins. The results show that lambs in the InHay+Cal treatment
   exhibited a higher packed cell volume (PCV) and lower faecal egg counts
   (FEC) compared to the InHay group. No effects of infection on the other
   measured variables were observed in unsupplemented lambs. Calliandra
   supplementation increased total feed dry matter intake (DMI) by 20\%
   (61.8 vs. 51.7 g DM/kg LW0.75) (InHay+Cal vs. InHay) and enhanced LW
   gain (7.2 g/d) in the InHay+Cal group, whereas the unsupplemented
   infected group (InHay) experienced LW loss (-26.6 g/d). Calliandra
   supplementation to infected lambs reduced daily CH4 emission by 15\%
   (13.9 vs. 16.2 g/d) and CH4 yield (g/kg DMI) by 30\% (18.7 vs. 26.5 g/kg
   DMI), compared to emissions from unsupplemented infected lambs.
   Nonetheless, Calliandra supplementation decreased the digestibility of
   crude protein and fibre and raised the faecal nitrogen (N) output to N
   intake (FN/NI) ratio. The effects of PEG supplementation on CT activity
   remained inconclusive. The study concludes that a 40\% replacement of a
   protein-deficient basal diet with Calliandra may be excessive. However,
   the findings underscore the considerable advantages of integrating
   Calliandra into farming systems. Such nature-based solution control GIT
   parasite infections and their lifecycle, bolster the nutritional value
   of a deficient basal diet, improve animal productivity cost-effectively,
   and mitigate enteric methane emissions both in absolute terms and
   intensity.},

Abstract = {Resprouting in the oil mallee, Eucalyptus kochii Maiden \& Blakely
   subsp. plenissima Gardner (Brooker), involves generation of new shoots
   from preformed meristematic foci on the lignotuber. Numbers of such foci
   escalated from 200 per lignotuber in trees aged 1 year to 3000 on 4- to
   5-year-old trees. Removal of shoot biomass by decapitation 5 cm above
   ground in summer (February) or spring (October) resulted in initiation
   of 140-170 new shoots, but approx. 400 shoots were induced to form if
   crops of new shoots were successively removed until sprouting ceased and
   rootstocks senesced. Initially, the new shoot biomass of regenerating
   coppices increased slowly and the root biomass failed to increase
   appreciably until 1.7-2.5 years after cutting. Newly cut trees showed
   loss of fine root biomass, and structural roots failed to secondarily
   thicken to the extent shown by uncut trees. After 2 years, the biomass
   of shoots of coppiced plants was only one-third that of uncut control
   trees and shoot : root dry mass ratios of coppiced plants were still low
   (1.5-2.0) compared with those of the controls (average ratio of 3.1).
   Spring cutting promoted quicker and greater biomass recovery than summer
   cutting. Starch in below-ground biomass fell quickly following
   decapitation and remained low for a 12-18 month period. Utilization of
   starch reserves in naturally regenerating coppices was estimated to
   provide only a small proportion of the dry matter accumulated in new
   shoots. Results are discussed in relation to their impact on coppicing
   ability of the species under natural conditions or when successively
   coppiced for shoot biomass production. (C) 2002 Annals of Botany

Abstract = {The study aimed to investigate the nutritional composition, trace
   elements and anti-nutritional factors of fodder species belonging to the
   family Fabaceae potentially used as an alternative feed for cattle. The
   proximate composition, particularly dry matter, moisture, fats, crude
   proteins (CP), carbohydrates, crude fibre (CF), and neutral detergent
   fiber (NDF), were analysed, thereby, nonfibre carbohydrate (NFC) and
   gross energy (GE) were calculated. Thirty-three trace elements were
   determined from chemically digested dried plant material using ICP-MS
   (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) and ICP-OES (ICP-Optical
   Emission Spectrophotometry). The tannin levels, a known antinutritional
   factor, were estimated using Folin-Ciocalteu method. The methods were
   validated by the relative standard deviation (RSD) values and acceptable
   recovery percentage, linearity, limit of quantification (LoQ), and limit
   of detection (LoD). The proximate composition analysis estimated levels
   of dry matter (> 90 \%), ash (3.77-26.98 \%), crude proteins (8.22-22.19
   \%), carbohydrates (54.00-86.79 \%), crude fibre (10.54-40.10 \%), NDF
   (22.26-59.20 \%) and GE (< 100 Kcal kg(-1) DM) in leguminous species.
   Essential elements were detected in recommended levels including Zn

   and Na (72.00-1721 mg kg(-1)). The concentration of toxic elements was
   below critical levels and tannin occurred at a safe level (< 50 mgTAE

Abstract = {The cell cycle effects, alteration in radiation response, and inherent
   cytotoxicity of the metal chelators mimosine, desferrioxamine (DFO),
   N,N'-bis(o-hydroxybenzyl)-ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (HBED), and
   deferiprone (L1) were studied in exponentially growing Chinese hamster
   V79 cells. Incubation of cells with 200-1000 muM mimosine for 12 h
   reduced clonogenic survival to 50-60\%, while incubation for 24 h
   reduced survival further to 0.5\%. Mimosine treatment resulted in cell
   cycle blocks at the G(1)/S-phase border and in S phase. Pulse labeling
   with 5-bromodeoxyuridine indicated that the S-phase cells ceased to
   actively replicate DNA after only 2 h of mimosine treatment and were
   unable to replicate DNA for extended periods. Treatment of V79 cells
   with 600 muM minosine for 12 h resulted in radiosensitization, yielding
   a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) of 2.7 +/- 0.3 at the 10\% survival
   level. To study the kinetics of the sensitization, V79 cells were
   incubated with mimosine for various times up to 12 h and irradiated with
   a single 10-Gy dose of X rays. It was found that the radiosensitization
   increased continually up to 8 h (from a 3- to a 100-fold difference in
   survival) and then reached a plateau after 8 h. Mimosine also equally
   radiosensitized human lung cancer cells having either a normal or
   mutated TP53 gene, suggesting a TP53-independent mechanism. To test
   whether iron binding by mimosine was responsible for the observed
   radiosensitization, additional experiments were performed using the iron
   chelators DFO, HEED and L1. V79 cells treated with 500 muM of these
   agents for 8 h followed by various doses of X rays gave SERs similar to
   that for mimosine (2.0-2.7). These studies indicate that metal chelators
   are potent radiosensitizers in V79 and human cells. Importantly, when
   the DFO was preloaded together with Fe3+ {[}Fe(III)-DFO], the
   radiosensitizing effect was lost. These preliminary findings warrant
   further studies for the possible application of metal chelators as
   radiation sensitizers in radiation oncology. (C) 2001 by Radiation

Abstract = {Trees integrated with crops in time and/or space mediate nutrient
   cycling on farms by increasing the supply and availability of nutrients
   in the crop root zone and reducing nutrient losses. However,
   quantitative information is lacking on biological nitrogen fixation and
   nutrients recycled in semi-arid agroforestry due to the control of
   losses by trees, and most information available is on nutrients recycled
   through their above- and below-ground biomass. The potential for
   exploiting nutrient cycling in simultaneous agroforestry systems is
   constrained by a low and erratic water supply in the semi-arid areas of
   Africa. In parkland systems, there is a limited scope for increasing
   nutrient cycling because of the small quantity of biomass added into
   soil from low tree density in the system. However, trees in these
   traditional systems are more important for economic products in terms of
   poles; timber, fruits, etc., and have ecological benefits such as the
   reduction of nutrient and water losses. Although hedgerow intercropping
   uses high tree density and increases the nitrogen (N) supply in the
   soil, crops nevertheless fail to benefit due to competition between
   trees and crops for water. Contour hedgerows can conserve nutrients by
   arresting soil erosion on moderately sloping lands and are worthy of
   consideration for both soil conservation and fodder production. Mixed
   intercropping of Gliricidia septum and maize with efficient tree
   management appears to be promising in some areas and needs further
   testing before widespread dissemination. Sequential systems with
   short-duration leguminous trees and shrubs, exemplified by 2-year
   Sesbania sesban rotated with crops, and biomass transfer systems are
   both efficient in nutrient cycling and increasing crop yields.
   Therefore, these systems can be considered for dissemination depending
   on the socio-econornic conditions. The potential for using biomass
   transfer systems is constrained by the availability of biomass outside
   the farms, land for its production on farms and labor for its
   application. Although these agroforestry systems provide an adequate
   quantity of N for moderate cereal yields, they cannot meet the
   phosphorus (P) requirements of crops in P-deficient soils, which should
   be supplemented through inorganic P sources. Nutrient cycling using
   livestock is less efficient due to N losses by volatilization and
   leaching than direct use of biomass as green manure. The use of
   palatable and high quality biomass as fodder is three to five times more
   economical than green manure. While agroforestry clearly has a definite
   role to increase nutrient cycling in low input systems, no single
   technology can guarantee controlling nutrient depletion in the long
   term; The choice of different technologies to suit different niches of
   the farm and their integration with inorganic nutrients is important for
   sustainable production even on smallholders' farms in the semi-arid
   Africa.},

   (Brachiaria dictyoneura) with legume foliage (Cratylia argentea) or

   Body energy retention, however, was similar in all diets. Along with CP
   intake, the proportionate CP losses through faeces decreased (P < 0.001)
   with increasing legume proportion which was associated with improved (P
   < 0.001) body protein retention and reduced (P < 0.1) fat retention.
   Ruminal fluid ammonia concentration was not significantly affected (P >
   0.1) by the inclusion of S. saponaria in the concentrate, but increased
   linearly (P < 0.001) as dietary legume proportion was elevated.
   Supplementation with fruits of S. saponaria increased (P < 0.01) total
   bacteria count, and decreased (P < 0.001) total ciliate protozoa count
   by more than proportionately 0.50. Daily methane release was reduced (P
   < 0.01) by S. saponaria supplementation in all basal diet types.
   Although being not clearly affected on a daily basis, methane release
   relative to body protein retention decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with
   increasing legume proportion. The fact that interactions were mostly
   non-significant (P > 0.05) indicates that supplementation with S.
   saponaria fruits is a useful means to reduce methane emission from sheep
   given both tropical grass-based and grass-legume-based diets. Likewise,
   including legumes in N-limited tropical diets seems to represent an
   environmentally friendly way to improve animal productivity.},

Abstract = {The relative importance of the processes of SOM (maintenance of active
   soil organic matter) and SYNCHRONY (timing of release of
   organically-bound nutrients to coincide with crop demand) were assessed
   for their contribution to the maintenance of crop nitrogen availability
   in alley cropping. Alley cropping is a system of agroforestry where
   trees and crops are intercropped, the former being periodically pruned
   to produce mulch. Two maize alley cropping treatments, with Erythrina
   poeppigiana and with Gliricidia sepium, were compared to sole-cropped
   maize in an 8 yr old experiment at CATIE in Costa Rica.
   Maize productivity, maize N uptake, and N release from mulch and crop
   residue decomposition were measured each month during one cropping
   cycle. The effects of changes in active soil organic matter (SOM) on
   available N were assessed by measuring field N mineralization and the
   size of the microbial N pool through the cropping season. Two
   sub-treatments were introduced to assess the contribution of a current
   mulch application to maize N uptake (1) removing the mulch, and (2)
   applying N-15 labelled mulch. Monthly sampling of N-15 in the mulch,
   microbial biomass, and maize allowed assessment of the SYNCHRONY of
   mulch N release and crop uptake.
   Maize biomass and maize N content, N release from mulch and residue
   decomposition, and N mineralization were all higher in the alley crop
   than the sole crop by 2.2-, 2.8-, 5.0- and 2.1-fold respectively. Soil
   microbial N was not significantly different between treatments, but
   increased by 80\% during the cropping season. Maize grown in the alley
   crop with the mulch removed contained only 3-15\% less N at maturity.
   Similarly N-15` labelled mulch only contributed about 10\% of crop N.
   The percentage contribution of mulch N-15 to the maize declined from
   13-14\% 30 days after planting to 8-11\% 100 days after planting. Total
   recovery of mulch N by the maize was only about 10 kg ha-1 and almost
   all of this was taken up by 60 days after planting. The contribution of
   mulch N to weed N content declined from 15-24\% 7 weeks after mulch
   application to 2-6\% 9 months after application. Mulch N contributed
   only 3-5\% of the microbial N pool at 40 days and this fell to zero by
   105 days.
   The higher rates of N mineralization under the alley crop compared to
   rates under the sole crop led to faster establishment of the maize in
   the alley crop and maintained higher rates of N accumulation thereafter.
   These higher rates of N mineralization resulted from the build up of
   readily-mineralizable organic N in the soil over the 7 yrs of tree mulch
   application. The size of the microbial N pool was not to be related to
   nitrogen availability nor organic residue inputs. Mulch N released
   during a cropping season accounted for about 15\% of the increase in N
   uptake by maize. Transfer of mulch N to the crop may have been
   restricted by the low incorporation of mulch N into the microbial
   biomass. The long-term build-up of the SOM reserve of mineralizable
   organic N was more important than the SYNCHRONY of mulch N release and
   crop uptake in determining the substantially higher productivity and N
   uptake in the alley crop compared to the sole crop},

   used as a predictor of the effectiveness of microbes to increase soluble
   Pi via desorption from soils. The Pi desorption was most pronounced in a
   Mollisol followed by an Oxisol, an Ultisol, and then by three Andisols.
   The quantity of Pi desorbed by the fungus was also greater when the
   amount of sorbed Pi was high.},

Title = {Role of biological nitrogen fixation in legume based cropping systems; a

Journal = {PLANT AND SOIL},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {252},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) has been gradually depleted from West African soils and now
   poses serious threats to food production. Many ways of increasing N
   supply ( e. g. judicious use of inorganic fertilizers and
   nitrogen-fixing plants) have been tried in West African farming systems.
   Herbaceous and woody legumes commonly contribute 40 - 70 kg N ha(-1)
   season. This represents about 30\% of the total N applied as residues.
   Nevertheless and despite repeated demonstrations of the usefulness of
   green manures in enhancing soil fertility, their practices and adoption
   are still limited. Promiscuous soyabeans are being used to develop
   sustainable cropping systems in the moist savannah. Reliable estimates
   of N-2 fixed by soyabeans and their residual N benefits to subsequent
   cereal crops in the savannah zone of southern Guinea have only
   infrequently been made. The actual amounts measured varied between 38
   and 126 kg N ha(-1) assuming that only seeds of soyabeans are removed
   from the plots, the net N accrual of soil nitrogen ranges between minus
   8 kg N ha(-1) and plus 47 kg N ha(-1) depending on the soyabean
   cultivar. Residual soyabean N values of 10 - 24 kg N ha(-1) (14 - 36\%
   of the total N in maize) were obtained in a soyabean-maize rotation.
   Although cereal yields following legume cultivation have been attributed
   to greater N accumulation, our data show that the relative increase in
   maize N was smaller than the relative increase in dry-matter yield.
   Hence, the increased yields of maize following soybeans are not entirely
   due to the carry-over of N from soyabean residues ( as well as to
   conservation of soil N) but to other rotational effects as well. It is
   thus clear that the Nbenefit of grain legumes to non-legumes is small
   compared to the level of N fertilizer use in more intensive cereal
   production systems but is nevertheless significant in the context of the
   low amounts of input in subsistence farming.},

Abstract = {Using various mutant strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum by. viciae, we
   have investigated the role of nodO in stimulating infection thread
   development in vetch and pea. Analysis of R. leguminosarum by. viciae
   nodE and nodO mutants revealed no significant difference from the
   wildtype infection phenotype, Conversely, an R, leguminosarum by. viciae
   nodE nodO double mutant was severely impaired in its ability to form
   normal infection threads. This strain displayed a number of novel
   infection-related events, including intracellular accumulations of
   bacteria at the base of root hairs, distended and enlarged infection
   threads, and reversed threads growing up root hairs. Since normal
   infection was seen in a nodE mutant, nodO must suppress these abnormal
   infection phenomena. A deletion mutant retaining only the nodD and
   nodABCIJ genes, also formed intracellular accumulations at the base of
   root hairs. Addition of R, leguminosarum by. viciae nodO could alleviate
   this phenotype and restore some infection thread formation, although
   these threads appeared to be abnormal. Exogenous application of R,
   leguminosarum by, viciae Nod factors could not alleviate the aberrant
   infection phenotype, Our results show that the most basic Nod factor
   structure can allow bacterial entry into the root hair, and that nodO
   can promote subsequent infection thread development.},

Abstract = {P>Thirty-six published studies containing 219 treatment means and 1069
   sheep were included in the dataset for meta-analysis to elucidate
   responses of foliage supplementation on digestibility, nitrogen balance
   and rumen parameters. Major predictive variables were percentages of
   foliages in diets (FL), crude protein (CP) in foliages (FCP), NDF in
   foliages (FNDF), NDF in basal forages (BNDF), CP in basal forages (BCP),
   CP in total diets (DCP) and foliage CP intake (FCPI). Organic matter
   digestibility increased linearly (p = 0.10) with increasing FL, but
   responded quadratically to DCP (p = 0.021) and BCP (p < 0.001), with
   maximal OM digestibility occurred at 14.6\% of CP in diets (R2 = 0.12).
   The digestibility of CP was affected by FL (p = 0.01), FCPI (p < 0.026),
   FCP (p < 0.001), FNDF (p < 0.001) and DCP (p < 0.032) positively and
   quadratically, and maximal response was at 14.1\% DCP (p < 0.001), 51\%
   FL (p < 0.001), 29\% FCP (p < 0.001) and FCPI of 122 g/day (p < 0.001).
   The digestibility of NDF increased quadratically (p = 0.09) with
   increasing FL, peaking at 16\% foliage levels, decreased quadratically
   (p = 0.001) with increasing FNDF and decreased linearly (p = 0.048) with
   increasing FCPI. Digestible OM and CP intakes were the highest at 37.2\%
   and 42.1\% FL, respectively. Fecal N excretion increased linearly with
   increasing FL (p < 0.001) and DCP (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.66). However, FCPI
   (p = 0.082), FCP (p = 0.003) and BCP (p < 0.001) affected fecal N
   excretion positively and quadratically. Urinary N excretion increased
   linearly (p < 0.001) with increasing FL (R2 = 0.45), FCPI (R2 = 0.79),
   FCP (R2 = 0.51), BCP (R2 = 0.72) and DCP (R2 = 0.77). Rumen NH3
   concentration was affected positively and quadratically (p = 0.023) by
   FL with a peak rumen NH3 level of 160 mg/l at 17.3\% FL. However, rumen
   NH3 concentration (mg/l) increased linearly with increasing FCP (p =
   0.001), FCPI (p = 0.01) and DCP (p < 0.001). In conclusion, catalytic
   foliage supplementation at low levels, preferably, at 16\% may enhance
   nutrient utilization, while foliage levels up to 42\% may result greater
   performance of sheep fed on low-quality roughages.},

Abstract = {Even though agronomists have considered the spatial root distribution of
   plants to be important for interspecific interactions in agricultural
   intercropping, few experimental studies have quantified patterns of root
   distribution and their impacts on interspecific interactions in
   agroforestry systems. A field experiment was conducted to investigate
   the relationship between root distribution and interspecific
   interactions between intercropped jujube tree (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.)
   and wheat (Triticum aestivum Linn.) in Hetian, south Xinjiang province,
   northwest China. Roots were sampled by auger in 2-, 4- and 6-year-old
   jujube tree/wheat intercropping and in sole wheat and 2-, 4- and
   6-year-old sole jujube down to 100 cm depth in the soil profile. The
   roots of both intercropped wheat and jujube had less root length density
   (RLD) at all soil depths than those of sole wheat and jujube trees. The
   RLD of 6-year-old jujube intercropped with wheat at different soil
   depths was influenced by intercropping to a smaller extent than in other
   jujube/wheat intercropping combinations. 6-year-old jujube exhibited a
   stronger negative effect on the productivity of wheat than did 2- or
   4-year-old jujube and there was less effect on productivity of jujube in
   the 6-year-old system than in the 2- or 4-year-old jujube trees grown in
   monoculture. These findings may partly explain the interspecific
   competition effects in jujube tree/wheat agroforestry systems.},

Abstract = {A feeding trial was carried out for 90 days to asses the supplementing
   effect of tagasaste forage as a substitute for a concentrate supplement
   (wheat bran-noug seed cake (Gizotia abyssinica) mixture in 3:1
   proportion) using 24 Menz male sheep (initial weight of 18.3 +/- 1.6
   kg). The sheep were fed on natural pasture hay as basal diet. The
   treatments were iso-nitrogenous supplements of 100\% concentrate offered
   at 200 g DM/sheep/day (T1), 67\% concentrate +33\% tagasaste (T2), 33\%
   concentrate +67\% tagasaste (T3) and 100\% tagasaste (T4). Digestibility
   tests of treatment diets were done for 10 days following the feeding
   trial using the same experimental animals. At the end of the experiment,
   carcass parameters were also evaluated. In situ degradability of feeds
   was determined using three rumen fistulated crossbred steers. Tagasaste
   forage contains more CP (215 g/kg), ADF (221 g/kg), ADL (69 g/kg); and
   less NDF (351 g/kg) compared to the concentrate. The concentrate had a
   high immediately soluble fraction (a), and a low insoluble but potential
   degradable matter (b), while tagasaste had a low a and higher b values
   and the overall potential degradability was 755, 702, and 586 g/kg, for
   tagasaste, concentrate and natural pasture hay respectively. Tagasaste
   forage had also shown higher rates of degradation (c) compared to the
   concentrate which might increase the total effective degradability. In
   the feeding trial the supplements made 26.8, 27.0, 28.3 and 29\% of the
   total dry matter (DM) intake for T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively.
   Increasing the inclusion of tagasaste forage significantly (P<0.01)
   decreased the daily total DM intake of the basal diet and total
   metabolizable energy (ME), and increased the CP intake. The average
   weight gain of sheep did not show significant difference (P>0.05), but
   had a decreasing trend, with 44.4, 41.4, 38.9 and 38.1 g/sheep for T1,
   T2, T3, and T4, respectively. The in vivo digestibility of DM and
   nutrients generally followed the order of T1 > T2 > T3 > T4. The
   dressing percentage of the carcass was 40.4\% and all other parameters
   measured did not show significant variation due to treatment diets
   (P>0.05). However, weight of liver, kidney and spleen was higher for
   sheep fed with higher tagasaste forage diet. The result of this study
   revealed that tagasaste can substitute wheat bran-noug seed cake
   concentrate mixture as a protein supplement. Options to increase the low
   ME and minimize the effect of the anti nutritional factors will improve
   nutrient digestibility in tagasaste forage and will enhance the overall
   efficiency of feed utilization. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 kg dry matter (DM)/day in a 4 x 4 Latin square design.
   Feed DM intakes were measured during the 14 days and sample of feeds,
   feces, urine, as well as rumen fluid and blood were collected during the
   7 days while the animals were on metabolism crates. Results Based on
   this experiment strategic supplementation of FMS increased (P < 0.05)
   nutrients digestibility (organic matter, crude protein, and acid
   detergent fiber) enhanced rumen total volatile fatty acid production
   especially propionic acid (C-3), C-2:C-3 ratio while, remarkably
   promoted the microbial protein synthesis (MPS) by increasing N-balance
   and retention of purine derivatives. Conclusions Under this experiment,
   the results revealed the potential use of FMS as a good-quality feed to
   improve nutrients digestibility, rumen fermentation, microbial protein
   synthesis, and to mitigate methane production. FMS supplementation at
   0.6 kg DM/day exhibited the best result.},

Abstract = {Eucalyptus and Acacia are two tree genera that are commonly used in
   industrial plantations and as components of agroforestry systems in
   southeast Asia. These fast-growing trees are mostly grown in
   monocultures. However, questions are now being raised about the
   long-term sustainability of their growth as well as their effects on
   site quality. Losses of N and P from the site through biomass harvest
   and during site preparation constitute a major nutrient drain. As an
   alternative to monocultures, mixed-species cultures which include at
   least one N(2)-fixing tree species can improve plant productivity and
   soil N dynamics. Among the various aspects of N dynamics in such stands,
   export of N during biomass harvest and inputs by the N(2)-fixing
   component are the most important.
   Reported estimates of the amount of N fixed by acacia and other
   N(2)-fixing trees are highly variable, depending on inherited plant
   characteristics, tree age, site factors (e.g., drought), soil fertility
   (e.g., available P, metal toxicities) and unreliable methods of
   measuring N(2)-fixation. Of the available techniques for assessing
   N(2)-fixation by trees, the total N difference method (TND) is the
   simplest. The contribution of roots to assessments of N(2)-fixation is
   recognized but rarely measured.
   For short-rotation mixed-species plantations, the amount and time of N
   transfer from N(2)-fixing trees to non-N(2)-fixing trees are important
   issues to consider when attempting to develop productive nutrient
   management strategies. Based on limited information from trials in
   southeast Asia, it appears that acacia fixes substantial amounts of N
   during the first few years of establishment and a significant amount of
   that N is transferred to adjacent eucalypts, thereby improving the
   growth and nutrition of the eucalypts. The presumed transfer of N from
   acacias to eucalypts during the early stages of plantation development
   probably results from below-ground turnover of roots and nodules because
   aboveground litter decomposition is slight at this stage, and
   contributes little to the overall N dynamics.
   The available information on P cycling in mixed-species stands, during
   the early stages of stand growth, provides inconclusive evidence as to
   whether the availability of soil P increases, despite indications of
   higher levels of phosphatase activity in the fine roots of
   nitrogen-fixing trees. This would imply that additional inputs of P as
   fertilizer are required to remove any P deficiency in mixed-species
   stands. Long-term observations are required for better understanding of
   the nutritional and growth benefits of including N(2)-fixing trees in
   mixed-species stands.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG; methane and nitrous oxide) emissions from enteric
   fermentation and manure management of Indian livestock were estimated
   from the last two Indian livestock census datasets (2003 and 2007) using
   IPCC Tier 2 (2006) guidelines. The total annual GHG emissions from
   Indian livestock increased in 2007 compared to the year 2003 with an
   annual growth rate of 1.52\% over this period. The contributions of GHG
   by dairy cattle, non-dairy cattle, buffaloes, goats, sheep and other
   animals (yak, mithun, horse, donkeys, pigs and poultry) were 30.52,
   24.0, 37.7, 4.34, 2.09 and 3.52\%, respectively, in 2007. Enteric
   fermentation was the major source of methane, accounting for 89.2\% of
   the total GHG emissions, followed by manure methane (9.49\%). Nitrous
   oxide emissions accounted for 1.34\%. GHG emissions (CO2-eq. per kg of
   fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM)) by female animals were
   considerably lower for crossbred cows (1161 g), followed by buffaloes
   (1332 g) and goats (2699 g), and were the highest for indigenous cattle
   (3261 g) in 2007. There was a decreasing trend in GHG emissions (-1.82\%
   annual growth rate) in relation to milk production from 2003 to 2007
   (1818 g and 1689 g CO2-eq. per kg FPCM in 2003 and 2007, respectively).
   This study revealed that GHG emissions (total as well as per unit of
   products) from dairy and other categories of livestock populations could
   be reduced substantially through proper dairy herd management without
   compromising animal production. In conclusion, although the total GHG
   emissions from Indian livestock increased in 2007, there was a
   decreasing trend in GHG production per kg of milk production or animal
   products.},

Title = {Evaluation of Himalayan Elm (Ulmus wallichiana) leaf meal as a
   partial substitute for concentrate mixture in total mixed ration of
   sheep},
Journal = {SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {196},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Exploring novel feed resources in substitution for concentrate feeds is
   a primary aim for lowering the cost of feeding and a viable strategy to
   mitigate the shortage of animal feeds. The present experiment was
   accomplished by in vitro and in vivo assays with the aim to evaluate the
   potential of Himalayan Elm (Ulmus wallichiana) leaf meal (ELM) as
   partial substitute to the concentrate feed mixture in total mixed ration
   (TMR) of sheep. Under in vitro study, graded levels (0, 10, 20, 30, 40
   and 50\%) of ELM inclusion substituting concentrate feed mixture
   constituting 40\% of the basal TMR were evaluated for degradability of
   dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF).
   In vitro degradability of DM, OM and NDF were higher (P < 0.05) with
   30\% ELM inclusion, and the level was used for sheep feeding study. In
   the in vivo experiment, a feeding trail was conducted for one month on
   Corriedale (16) male (23.43 +/- 0.47 kg body weight, 13-14 months of
   age) sheep allotted randomly into two equal groups, offered basal TMR as
   control (T0) and TMR containing ELM substituting concentrate mixture at
   30 \% level as treatment (T1) group. The animals of control and
   treatment group had similar feed intake (83.91 vs 85.28 g DM/kg
   W0.75/day, respectively); however, digestibility (\%) of crude protein
   and neutral detergent fibre was higher (P < 0.05) in T1 group. Content
   and the intakes of digestible nutrients (digestible crude protein, total
   digestible nutrients and metabolisable energy) were similar between the
   two groups. Animals of both the groups were in positive balance of
   nitrogen (N), calcium and phosphorus, and were comparable for N and
   higher (P < 0.05) for Ca and P in the T1 group. Haemato-biochemical
   metabolites were within the normal physiological ranges in both the
   groups with significantly improved (P < 0.01) levels of haemoglobin and
   haematocrit while reduced values for serum urea N (P < 0.05) and
   aspartate amino-transferase (P < 0.01) in T1. Likewise, rumen
   fermentation metabolites were in normal ranges and comparable between
   the groups for pH, total volatile fatty acids, N and its fractions in
   rumen fluid collected at 30 days of experimental feeding. It can be
   concluded that Elm leaf meal can replace 30 \% of concentrate feed
   mixture in the TMR of sheep as substitution improved digestibility of CP
   and NDF, and balance of Ca and P, without effecting feed intake, rumen
   fermentation, blood metabolites and live weight.},

Title = {Effects of KCl and CaCl2 on the evolution of anhydro sugars
   in reaction intermediates during cellulose fast pyrolysis},
Journal = {FUEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {251},
Pages = {307-315},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Reaction intermediates mainly consisting of anhydro sugars are the
   crucial transitional stage connecting the cellulose feedstock and the
   three phases of products during pyrolysis. For the first time, the
   effects of KCl and CaCl2 on the evolution of anhydro sugars in reaction
   intermediates were examined by using levoglucosan pyranose (LGA\_Pyran),
   maltosan and cyclodextrin as model compounds. These compounds were
   subjected to fast pyrolysis on a Py-GC/MS, where dry samples were heated
   at a heating rate of 10 degrees C/s to 500 degrees C with a holding time
   of 20 s at 500 degrees C. The results indicated that KCl had a stronger
   inhibitory effect than CaCl2 on LGA\_Pyran formation during cellulose
   fast pyrolysis. However, during the pyrolysis of the oligosaccharides,
   the catalytic effects of KCl were weakened by the low degree of
   polymerization and the lack of reducing ends, while the catalytic
   effects of CaCl2 were enhanced by a better distribution. This led to the
   reverse order of their effects on LGA\_Pyran formation. Furthermore,
   much higher char yields from oligosaccharides under catalysis of CaCl2
   than under the catalysis of KCl indicate the prominent influence of
   CaCl2 on the secondary reactions of reaction intermediates leading to
   secondary char.},

Abstract = {Effect of graded levels (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0\% of DM) of
   condensed tannins (CT) from tanniferous tree leaves of A. heterophyllus,
   E. jambolana, F. infectoria; F. glomerata and P. guajava supplementation
   on gas production, methane production, substrate degradation and
   efficiency of microbial biomass production was studied on wheat straw
   based substrate using in vitro gas production test. Gas volume in 24
   hours (ml/200 mg) was reduced (26.59-22.74) significantly (P < 0.05) as
   the CT level increased from 1.0-3.0\%. Methane produced in 24 hours
   (ml/g DM) was also reduced (22.90-18.34) significantly (P < 0.05) with
   CT supplementation from 1.0-3.0\% levels. Average CH4 (ml/g DM) produced
   in 24 hours was significantly higher in E. jambolana (22.45) followed by
   comparable CH4 production among F. infectoria, P. guajava and F.
   glomerata (20.65, 20.61 and 20.58) and lowest methane production in A.
   heterophyllus (18.36) leaves. The percent reduction in methane
   production was highest (P < 0.05) in P. guajava (17.21) followed by F.
   infectoria, A. heterophyllus and E. jambolana (14.25, 8.98 and 6.64) and
   least CH4 reduction was evident in F. glomerata (3.36). Supplementation
   of CT at 1.0\% level did not exert any adverse (P < 0.05) effect on
   (46.96) truly degradable organic matter in rumen (TDOMR, \%)
   irrespective of sources, however, CT levels from 1.5-3.0\% significantly
   (P < 0.05) reduced (43.50 - 40.18) the TDOMR (\%). Efficiency of
   microbial biomass production (EMP) and partitioning factor (PF) were
   significantly (P < 0.05) higher in A. heterophyllus (39.85 and 3.66).
   From present study it can be concluded that supplementation of condensed
   tannins from tanniferous tree leaves at 1 to 3\% levels considerably
   reduces the gas production and methane production in in vitro gas
   production test.},

Title = {Rumen protozoal dynamics during the transition from milk/grass to
   high-concentrate based diet in beef calves as affected by the addition
   of tannins or medium-chain fatty acids},
Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {257},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Changes in rumen protozoal community during adaptation of 7-month-old
   beef calves from a milk/grass diet to a high-energy diet consisting of
   cereal-based concentrate plus wheat straw, both given ad libitum (diet
   C), were studied. Eighteen rumen-cannulated Limousine crossbred male
   calves were randomly assigned to three diets (C; C plus 20 g/kg of a
   65:35 chestnut and quebracho tannin extract, T; and C plus 6 g/kg
   medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) mixture, M). Fermentation variables were
   studied, and rumen ciliates were quantified and classified from rumen
   fluid sampled just before the morning feeding on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and
   28 of the experiment. Protozoal population changed over time, but all
   calves harbored a stable population at the end of the experiment.
   Diversity decreased on time, and Entodinium and Isotricha species were
   the most abundant at the end of the trial. When occurred, defaunation
   was transient as protozoa were absent from M calves in three occasions
   on days 7 and 14 but were refaunated thereafter reaching a consistent
   population. Regardless the diet, proportions of Isotricha spp. and
   Dosytricha ruminantium, Epidinium spp. and Subfamily Diplodiniinae,
   decreased throughout the experiment, whereas Entodinium spp. increased
   reaching 0.93 of total protozoa. Dasytricha and protozoa from Subfamily
   Diplodiniinae disappeared from the rumen of all calves at the end of the
   study, except for Polyplastron multivesiculatum. Rumen variables were
   not affected by the addition of additives (P > 0.05). Rumen pH decreased
   across the study (P < 0.001) but did not reach acidotic values despite
   the high fermentability of the diet. Higher levels of lactate were
   observed on C calves at d14, but not in other dates (diet by day
   interaction, P = 0.03). Addition of tannin extract did not affect
   protozoal concentration and diversity, but MCFA might even lead to a
   transient defaunation. Transition to a high-concentrate diet does not
   necessarily reduce initial protozoal concentration, but diversity is
   affected towards a major proportion of Entodinium and, to a lesser
   extent, Isotricha. Dietary shift from weaning to a high-concentrate
   ration promotes a less diverse rumen protozoal population, but a high
   concentration is still maintained thereafter.},

Abstract = {A revegetation trial was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of
   growing a legume species, Prosopis juliflora L., on fly ash ameliorated
   with combination of various organic amendments, blue-green algal
   biofertilizer and Rhizobium inoculation. Significant enhancements in

   nitrate reductase activity were found in the plants grown on ameliorated
   fly ash in comparison to the plants growing in unamended fly ash or
   garden soil. Higher growth was obtained in fly ash amended with
   blue-green algae (BGA) than farmyard manure or press mud (PM), a waste
   from sugar-processing industry, due to the greater contribution of plant
   nutrients, supply of fixed nitrogen and increased availability of
   phosphorus. Nodulation was suppressed in different amendments of fly ash
   with soil in a concentration-duration-dependent manner, but not with
   other amendments. Plants accumulated higher amounts of Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn
   and Cr in various fly ash amendments than in garden soil. Further,
   inoculation of the plant with a fly ash tolerant Rhizobium strain
   conferred tolerance for the plant to grow under fly ash stress
   conditions with more translocation of metals to the above ground parts.
   The results showed the potential of P juliflora to grow in plantations

Title = {Development and validation of near-infrared spectroscopy for the
   prediction of forage quality parameters in Lolium multiflorum},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) is an important cool-season,
   annual forage crop for the grassland rotation system in Southern China.
   The primary aim of breeding programs is always to seek to improve forage
   quality in the animal productivity system; however, it is time- and
   labor-consuming when analyzed excessive large number of samples. The
   main objectives of this study were to construct near-infrared
   reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) models to predict the forage chemistry
   quality of Italian ryegrass including the concentrations of crude
   protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF),
   and water soluble carbohydrate (WSC). The results showed that a broader
   range of CP, NDF, ADF and WSC contents (\% DM) were obtained
   (4.45-30.60, 21.29-60.47, 11.66-36.17 and 3.95-51.52, respectively) from
   the samples selected for developing NIRS models. In addition, the
   critical wavelengths identified in this study to construct optimal NIRS
   models were located in 4,247-6,102 and 4,247-5,450 cm(-1) for CP and NDF
   content, and both wavelengths 5,446-6,102 and 4,247-4,602 cm(-1) could
   for ADF and WSC. Finally, the optimal models were developed based on the
   laboratory data and the spectral information by partial least squares
   (PLS) regression, with relatively high coefficients of determination
   (R-2 CV, CP = 0.99, NDF = 0.94, ADF = 0.92, WSC = 0.88), ratio of
   prediction to devitation (RPD, CP = 8.58, NDF 4.25, ADF = 3.64, WSC =
   3.10). The further statistics of prediction errors relative to
   laboratory (PRL) and the range error ratio (RER) give excellent
   assessments of the models with the PRL ratios lower than 2 and the RER
   values greater than 10. The NIRS models were validated using a
   completely independent set of samples and have coefficients of
   determination (R-V(2), CP = 0.99, NDF = 0.91, ADF = 0.95, WSC = 0.91)
   and ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD, CP = 9.37, NDF = 3.44, ADF =
   4.40, WSC = 3.39). The result suggested that routine screening for
   forage quality parameters with large numbers of samples is available
   with the NIRS model in Italian ryegrass breeding programs, as well as
   facilitating graziers to monitor the forage development stage for
   improving grazing efficiency.},

Abstract = {The generation of compounds derived from lignocellulosic biomass
   fractionation has a boost in recent years. An interesting plant could be
   tagasaste (Chamaecytisus proliferus) due to its high biomass production
   and its leguminous nature. A sequence of acid hydrolysis, as
   pretreatment, and pyrolysis of the solid residue, as treatment, has been
   used in its valorization. An experimental design (H2SO4 acid
   concentration 0.5-2\%, temperature 130-170 degrees C, and time 30-60
   min) has been used to study the hydrolysis process. In the proposed acid
   hydrolysis process, under 170 degrees C as operational temperature,
   0.5\% of H2SO4 and 30 min for the operation time, 91.75\% of the initial
   xylose have been extracted. The thermal behavior of both tagasaste
   trunks-large branches and some solid residues after hydrolysis (furthest
   and center points in the experimental design) process and raw material
   have been studied by thermogravimetric analysis under nitrogen
   atmosphere at different heating rates (5, 10, 15, and 20 degrees C
   min(-1)). The thermal degradation of the studied materials is influenced
   by its initial composition. Then, the higher reactivity of
   hemicelluloses can accelerate the pyrolysis degradation reaction.
   However, higher cellulose content implies lower activation energy in
   pyrolysis process.},

Title = {Sinorhizobium fredii HH103 has a truncated nolO gene due

Abstract = {Strain SVQ121 is a mutant derivative of Sinorhizobium fredii HH103
   carrying a transposon Tn5-lacZ insertion into the nolO-coding region.
   Sequence analysis of the wild-type gene revealed that it is homologous
   to that of Rhizobium sp. NGR234, which is involved in the 3 (or
   4)-O-carbamoylation of the nonreducing terminus of Nod factors.
   Downstream of nolO, as in Rhizobium sp. NGR234, the noel gene
   responsible for methylation of the fucose moiety of Nod factors was
   found. SVQ121 Nod factors showed lower levels of methylation into the
   fucosyl residue than those of HH103, suggesting a polar effect of the
   transposon insertion into nolO over the noel gene. A noel HH103 mutant
   was constructed. This mutant, SVQ503, produced Nod factors devoid of
   methyl groups, confirming that the S. fredii noel gene is functional.
   Neither the nolO nor the noel mutation affected the ability of HH103 to
   nodulate several host plants, but both mutations reduced competitiveness
   to nodulate soybean. The Nod factors produced by strain HH103, like
   those of other S. fredii isolates, lack carbamoyl residues. By using
   specific polymerase chain reaction primers, we sequenced the noLO gene
   of S. fredii strains USDA192, USDA193, USDA257, and 042B(s). All the
   analyzed strains showed the same -1 frameshift mutation that is present
   in the HH103 nolO-coding region. From these results, it is concluded
   that, regardless of their geographical origin, S. fredii strains carry
   the nolO-coding region but that it is truncated by the same base-pair
   deletion.},

   feed conversion in a single grass pasture and a silvopastoral system in
   40 intact male pelibuey lambs with an initial average weight of 22.48
   +/- 2.3kg, during 90 days in dry season. A completely randomized
   experimental design was used with four treatments and 10 replicates
   (lambs) in each one. The treatments were: T1) single grass pasture +
   250g/day of concentrate; T2) single grass pasture + injection of 1ml
   zeranol; T3) silvopastoral system + injection of 1ml of zeranol; T4)
   silvopastoral system + 250g/day of concentrate. Data were statistically
   evaluated using variance analyses and multiple mean comparisons of
   Duncan. FI and AD of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF)
   and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were higher (P<0.05) for T4 than the rest
   of the treatments. ADG was different (P<0.05) among treatments; T4=133g
   per animal-day was higher than T1=108g per animal-day. A significant
   difference (P<0.05) was found among treatments in feed conversion; T4
   was higher (5.65) than T1(5.18), T2(4.97) and T3(5.10). In conclusion,
   the silvopastoral system supplemented with concentrate had advantages in
   performance of lambs used in this experiment and the application of
   zeranol had no effects on productive parameters.},

Abstract = {The influences of pyrolysis temperature and phosphorus additives on
   physico-chemical quality and combustion property of bio-char briquettes
   were investigated in this research. Bio-char briquettes were obtained
   from directly pyrolysis of maize straw briquettes. Pyrolysis temperature
   were from room temperature to 250-650 degrees C with a heating rate 10
   degrees C/min. Combustion tests were performed in a thermal-gravimetric
   analyzer. Results showed that with the increased pyrolysis temperature,
   volume density decreased initially and subsequently turned flat. While
   durability rating and mass yield sustained to decline. The optimal
   pyrolysis temperature was estimated to be 550 degrees C, gave the higher
   heating value 21.05 MJ/kg, energy-mass co-benefit (EMCI) 8.14. The
   volumetric energy densities were mainly in the range of 10-14 GJ/m(3).
   Combustion feature of bio-char acquired at 250 degrees C was
   significantly different. Both the index S and Di at the first stage were
   obviously higher; the S was improved by addition of Ca (H2PO4)(2) at a
   suitable pyrolysis temperature. The E generally showed increasing trend
   with enhanced pyrolysis temperature. In the same pyrolysis temperature,
   the sequence of E from high to low is: EMS, EMS-CPM and EMS-ADP. The
   performance of NH4H2PO4 on combustion characteristics was worst. (C)

Abstract = {The literature and unpublished reports relating to the symbiosis between
   Acacia and its root-nodule bacteria (rhizobia) have been reviewed. The
   weight of evidence suggests that acacias fix useful quantities of
   nitrogen in the field. thereby conserving resources of soil nitrogen and
   perhaps acting as a source of nitrogen for other trees growing with them
   in mixed stands. Acacia species, and even provenances within species,
   are highly strain-specific in their requirement for effectively
   nitrogen-fixing rhizobial strains. Therefore, acacias introduced into
   new lands will require inoculation with effective rhizobia. Effective
   strains for acacias are probably most effectually selected on a
   species-by-species basis. inoculation of acacias will be done most
   efficiently by sowing seed into rhizobia-rich nursery soil so that
   seedlings are well nodulated and fixing nitrogen when the!, are
   outplanted into plantations. The implications of these matters for
   inoculant preparation are discussed.},

   carbohydrates, MPOLY-VO and MM-VO were highly toxic to macrophages. The
   mannan and its complexes with vanadyl ion lowered superoxide anion
   production in macrophages triggered with PMA. MPOLY enhanced nitric

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study was conducted to examine the effects of condensed tannins
   (CT) from Ficus bengalensis leaves on the feed utilization, milk
   production and health status of crossbred cows. Eighteen crossbred dairy
   cows at their second and mid lactation (avg. BW 351.6 +/- 10.6 kg) were
   randomly divided into two groups of nine each in a completely randomized
   block design and fed two iso-nitrogenous supplements formulated to
   contain 0\% and 1.5\% CT through dried and ground leaves of Ficus
   bengalensis. The diets were designated as CON and FBLM, respectively and
   fed to cows with a basal diet of rice straw to meet requirements for
   maintenance and milk production. The daily milk yield was significantly
   (p<0.05) increased due to supplementation of FBLM diet. The 4\% fat
   corrected milk yield was also significantly (p<0.01) higher due to
   increased (p<0.05) milk fat in cows under diet FBLM as compared to CON.
   The inclusion of CT at 1.5\% in the supplement did not interfere with
   the feed intake or digestibility of DM, OM, CP, EE, NDF, and ADF by
   lactating cows. Digestible crude protein (DCP) and total digestible
   nutrients (TDN) values of the composite diets were comparable between
   the groups. The blood biochemical parameters remained unaltered except
   significantly (p<0.05) lowered serum urea concentration in cows fed FBLM
   diet. There was a significant (p<0.05) increase intracellular reduced
   glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)
   activity in cows supplemented with condensed tannins. The total thiol
   group (T-SH) was found to be higher with reduction in lipid peroxidation
   (LPO) in cows of FBLM group. The cost of feeding per kg milk production
   was also reduced due to supplementation of Ficus bengalensis leaves.
   Therefore, a perceptible positive impact was evident on milk production
   and antioxidant status in crossbred cows during mid-lactation given
   supplement containing 1.5\% CT through Ficus bengalensis leaves.},

Abstract = {Two galactomannans, GALMAN-A and GALMAN-B, were isolated from seeds of
   Mimosa scabrella (bracatinga), with deactivation and exposure to native
   enzymes, respectively. They were treated with oxovanadium(IV) and
   oxovanadium(V), designated (VO2+/VO3+) to form GALMAN-A:VO2+/VO3+ and
   GALMAN-B:VO2+/VO3+ complexes, respectively. The potentiometric studies
   provided the binding constants for the complexes and the resulting
   complexed species were a function of pH.V-51 NMR spectra of
   GALMANA:VO2+/VO3+ and GALMAN-B:VO2+/VO3+ at pH 7.8 and at 30 degrees C
   indicated the occurence of two types of complexes formed by oxovandium
   ions and galactomannans. GALMAN-A:VO2+/VO3+ and GALMAN-B:VO2+/VO3+
   caused loss of HeLa cells viability at concentrations of 50-200 mu g/mL.
   GALMANA:VO2+/VO3+ exhibited low toxicity for 24 h, although
   GALMAN-B:VO2+/VO3+ was extremely toxic, since 50 mu g/mL was sufficient
   to decrease HeLa cell viability after 48 h by 60\%. GALMAN-A gave rise
   to a slight increase in cell proliferation after 48 h at 100 mu g/ml,
   whereas GALMAN-B promoted a slight decrease at concentrations of 50-100
   mu g/mL. GALMAN-A:VO2+/VO3+ and GALMAN-B:VO2+/VO3+ exhibited a
   significant decrease in cell proliferation after 48 h, each reaching
   60\% inhibition at 5-10 mu g/mL. The complexes which caused this effect
   were at concentrations 10 times lower than the uncomplexed polymers. (C)

Abstract = {The common bean crop (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) occupies 5.5 million
   hectares in Brazil and provides about 30\% of the population's protein
   needs. Yield remains low mainly due to limited availability of N and P,
   and to the often acid soil conditions. Surprisingly, there have been
   only very limited studies in Brazil in which the isolation and
   evaluation of efficient N-2-fixing bean strains has been attempted. This
   paper reports the selection of bean rhizobia for the ``Cerrados{''}, the
   savannas that represent one-fourth of Brazilian land. Two-hundred
   strains were selected from large pink-colored nodules collected in the
   Cerrados region and biological nitrogen fixation was evaluated under
   optimal (27/21 degreesC, day/night) and high (37/21 degreesC)
   temperature conditions. Thirty-six strains were selected and their
   nitrogen-fixing capacity and competitiveness further evaluated with
   black-seeded ``Negro Argel{''}, and colored ``Carioca{''} cultivars.
   One-fifth of the strains showed low genetic stability of nodulation
   genes, but some strains were as or more competitive than the strains
   currently recommended for use in commercial bean inoculants in Brazil.
   The superior performance of five strains was confirmed under field
   conditions and reinoculation in the second year increased bean yield.
   The DNA fingerprintings obtained by the ERIC-REP-PCR analyses indicated
   a high level of genetic diversity, and among the 36 strains, six
   different patterns of RFLP-PCR of the 16S rRNA gene region were
   detected. The 16S rDNA sequences of the most efficient and competitive
   strains were genetically similar to Rhizobium tropici, suggesting that
   further studies on inoculant strains in the hot and acid soils of the
   Brazilian Cerrados and Africa should emphasize this species. (C) 2002

Abstract = {Inadequate and low quality feed resources and declining soil fertility
   limit smallholder dairy production and crop yields in western Kenya.
   Integrating legumes into mixed crop-livestock smallholder production
   systems may improve feed resources and soil fertility. Mucuna {[}Mucuna
   pruriens var. utilis (L.) DC (Wright) Burck] and lablab {[}Lablab
   purpureus L. (Sweet)] are adapted legumes that can serve both functions,
   but data are limited which assess their use as supplements to cattle
   diets. The objective was to evaluate the potential benefits to dairy cow
   performance of feeding mucuna and lablab cv. Rongai hays as supplements
   to a basal diet of mature napiergrass {[}Pennisetum purpureum (Schum.)
   cv. Bana]. Eight multiparous Friesian cows were used in two 4 X 4 Latin
   squares. Treatments were (i) napiergrass basal diet fed alone (NG), (ii)
   napiergrass supplemented with mucuna hay (MH), (iii) napiergrass
   supplemented with lablab hay (LH), and (iv) napiergrass supplemented
   with a commercial dairy meal (CDM). The supplements were fed at
   iso-nitrogenous levels to meet the crude protein (CP) requirement of a
   350-kg lactating cow producing 8-10 kg milk day(-1). The MH, LH, and CDM
   treatments increased (P < 0.01) total dry matter intake (TDMI) (130,
   136, and 142 g kg(-1) BW0.75, respectively) compared to NG (108 g kg(-1)
   BW0.75). Supplementation also increased (P < 0.01) apparent DM
   digestibility (587, 625, and 615 g kg(-1), for MH, LH, and CDM,
   respectively) compared to NG (558 g kg(-1)) and daily yield of 4\% fat
   corrected milk (FCM) (4.20, 4.15, and 5.21 kg, for MH, LH, and CDM,
   respectively) compared to NG (3.69 kg). Supplements increased mean body
   condition score, but they had no effect on body weight (BW) gain.
   Results show that milk production can be increased by supplementing a
   napiergrass-based diet with mucuna or lablab hay, highlighting the
   importance of integrating legumes into the low-input, mixed cropping
   systems in the tropics. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study investigated rumen degradation kinetics of dry matter (DM)
   and crude protein (CP) in compound feed with different tannin extract
   inclusions and Acacia mearnsi forage (AMF) relative to dairy feeds
   (perennial ryegrass+white clover mixture pasture, maize silage, lucerne
   hay and Themeda triandra hay). The compound feed had 0.75\%, 1.5\% and
   3\% tannins extract inclusions while the control was a commercial
   compound feed. Triplicates of each feed per incubation period were
   incubated in two fistulated Jersey cows for 0, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120
   h, resulting in six replicates per feed. Tannin extract inclusions in
   compound feed only affected (p < 0.05) the (a) fraction, degradation
   rate and potential degradability (PD) for DM degradation, and affected
   (p < 0.05) the (a) and (b) fractions, as well as PD for CP degradation.
   The (a) fraction and degradation rate for DM degradation changed
   linearly (p < 0.05). The (a) fraction, PD and effective degradability
   (ED) of DM degradation changed quadratically (p < 0.05). Except for the
   degradation rate, the feed type affected (p < 0.05) the degradation
   parameters in both DM and CP degradations. For DM and CP degradations,
   (a) fraction was similarly the least in Themeda triandra hay and AMF but
   similarly the highest in maize silage, perennial ryegrass+white clover
   mixture pasture and lucerne hay. The (b) fraction was the least in AMF
   for both DM and CP degradations but the highest for pasture's DM
   degradation and similarly the highest in maize silage, lucerne hay and
   T. triandra hay for CP degradation. The PD was the least in AMF for both
   DM and CP degradations and similarly the highest in pasture DM but
   similarly the highest in perennial ryegrass+white clover mixture
   pasture, maize silage and lucerne hay for CP degradation. Furthermore,
   the ED was the lowest in AMF and the highest for perrenial ryegrass +
   white clover mixture pasture for DM degradation and same trend was
   observed for CP degradation whereby perrenial ryegrass + white clover
   mixture pasture, maize silage and lucerne had the highest ED. Digestible
   undegraded protein was the highest in AMF and similarly the least in
   dairy feeds. Tannin source inclusion in ruminant diets should be
   moderate to prevent rumen DM or CP degradation limitation.},

Title = {Effect of medium composition, genotype and age of explant on the

   kiwiberry (Actinidia arguta)},

Abstract = {Key message This study reveals that the genotype, thidiazuron, zeatine,
   meta-topolin, and age of explants affect the induction of
   endosperm-derived callus and subsequent hexaploid plant regeneration
   from tetraploid kiwiberry.
   Endosperm, an ephemeral and storage tissue, serves as a source of
   nutrition and protection during embryo development and germination. It
   can be used for the cultivation of polyploid plants in vitro. Here,
   results of plant regeneration and acclimatization from the
   endosperm-derived calli of four cultivars of Actinidia arguta has been
   presented. Seeds excised from fresh fruit and dry seeds stored for one
   year served as the sources of endosperm explants of selected tetraploid
   cultivars of A. arguta. Callus Induction Medium (CIM; containing 0.25,
   0.5, or 1 mg/l of TDZ) and Actinidia Endosperm Medium (AEM; containing 2
   mg/l of 2,4-D and 5 mg/l of kinetin) were used to study the organogenic
   responses of the calli. On AEM, the source of explant did not
   significantly affect the rate of callus induction for any of the tested
   cultivars; no organogenic events were observed. In contrast, on CIM both
   the source of explants and the cultivar origin caused significant
   differences in callus formation and subsequent organogenic events.
   Histological and ultrastructural analyses revealed the adventitious
   nature of shoot bud formation on these media. The most efficient
   elongation of shoot buds was achieved after transferring organogenic
   calli with adventitious shoot buds to a medium supplemented with zeatin
   or meta-topolin. Robust root induction with minimal basal callus
   formation occurred on the medium with indole-3-acetic acid. Flow
   cytometric analysis revealed that the nuclear DNA content in the leaves
   of some regenerants was approximately 50 \% higher (4.5 pg/2C) than that
   in leaves from the tetraploid seedlings (3.1 pg/2C),which confirmed that
   those regenerants originated from the endosperm. The regeneration of
   such hexaploid plants was more efficient when endosperm from fresh seeds
   served as an explant; therefore, fresh rather than dry seeds are
   recommended for endosperm-derived plant production. The hexaploid plants
   of A. arguta can serve as an important source of breeding material.},

Abstract = {Miombo woodlands cover approximately 3.6 million km(2) in sub-Saharan
   Africa and have been identified as one of the global priority areas for
   conservation. Nonetheless, it is debatable whether the presence of the
   pastoralists and livestock in Miombo woodlands is linked to the
   ecological degradation and resources use conflicts. Besides, the impact
   of Miombo woodlands utilization in relation to biodiversity and
   ecosystem service provision is not well understood. The current review
   describes the various concurrent issues underlying livestock production
   in Miombo woodlands and ecosystem resilience. Analytical review
   established that livestock in Miombo woodlands have a crucial role in
   enhancing food security and animal source protein requirement in the
   future. Ecologically, pastoralists' presence in the Miombo serves
   biodiversity conservation, enhances nutrient recycling, and regulates
   wildfires. On the other hand, pastoralists are faced with several
   challenges including pests and diseases and persistent drought that
   leads to scarcity of water and pasture resources. Other setbacks include
   high enteric methane emission due to poor livestock productivity,
   unsustainable rangeland management practices, land tenure, and poor
   water management. Observations of wildlife interactions with the natural
   ecosystem elsewhere provide crucial evidence for the potential of
   livestock-woodland beneficial symbiotic interaction. It is concluded
   that, since there is high ecological compatibility of livestock
   production in Miombo woodlands, there is need to reform management
   policy to promote livestock interaction on the Miombo woodlands.},

Abstract = {Incorporation of foliage and pods of tropical legumes in ruminant
   rations is an alternative to mitigate enteric methane emissions. The
   objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of adding
   increasing levels of ground pods of Enterolobiurn cyclocarpum (Jacq.)
   Griseb. mixed with foliage of Gliricidia septum (Jacq.) Steud. on
   emissions of rtuninal methane (CH4), volatile fatty acid proportions,
   rumen pH and microbial population in cattle. Four heifers (218 +/- 18 kg
   LW) were fed (13 days) 0, 15, 30, and 45\% of pods of E. cyclocarpum
   mixed with foliage of G. sepium, which were supplemented to a basal
   ration of Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) Stapf. Data were
   analyzed as a 4 x 4 Latin square. After three days of CH4 measurements
   in open circuit respiration chambers, rumen fluid was collected to
   determine volatile fatty acid (VFA) molar proportions and quantify the
   microbial population. Samples of ration ingredients, refusals and feces
   were collected to evaluate nutrient composition. Foliage and pods of
   legumes provided crude protein (CP), condensed tannins (CT) and
   saponins, while grass was characterized by higher concentrations of
   neutral detergent fiber (NDF). Dry matter intake (DMI) was 5.35 kg/day
   on average (P = 0.272). Apparent fiber digestibility was reduced (81
   g/kg) and digestible CP intake (13 g/kg) increased when E. cyclocarpum
   mixed with G. sepium in rations were given (P < 0.05). Incorporation of
   legume foliage and pods had a linear effect on molar proportions of
   butyric acid and acetic to propionic acid ratio (P < 0.05). Methane
   production, expressed on basis to digestible dry matter intake (DDMI),
   ranged between 43.22 and 49.94 g/kg DDMI (P = 0.131) and when CH4 was
   related to digestible CP (347 vs. 413 g CH4 /kg DCP) or annual weight
   gains (0.30 vs. 0.38 kg CH4/kg weight gain, P < 0.001) there were
   differences between the E. cyclocarpum mixed with G. septum rations
   compared to the control treatment, respectively. Rumen population of
   total bacteria, methanogenic archaea, and total protozoa was not
   affected by the increasing levels of condensed tannins and saponins in
   rations (P > 0.05). Substitution of 15 and 30\% of pods of E.
   cyclocarpum mixed with foliage of G. sepium in the ration, decreases
   annual methane emissions per unit product, without affecting dry matter
   intake or rumen microbial population, on the contrary, digestible CP
   intake and animal productivity increased due to supply of CP, CT and
   saponins.},

Abstract = {Galactomannans can be employed in food industries to modify the final
   rheological properties of the products. Since they are not absorbed by
   the living organisms they can also be used in dietary foods. The
   equilibria involving the interactions of Fe(III) and galactomannans and
   arabinogalactan of several leguminous plants were characterized by
   potentiometric titrations and EPR spectroscopy. The log of the
   equilibrium constants for the formation of ML species, where M is the
   metal ion and L is the monomeric unit of the biopolymers, were 15.4,
   14.1 and 18.5, for the galactomannans of C. fastuosa, L. leucocephala
   and S. macranthera, respectively. Log K values for protonated species
   (MHL) were 3.1, 3.3, and were not detected for the galactomannan of S.
   macranthera. The log K values for the formation of ML2 were 14.1, 13.3
   and 15.2, respectively. Early formation of insoluble products in the
   equilibrium with arabinogalactan and Fe(III) prevented acquisition of
   reliable data. The solid complexes assays showed a great dipolar
   interaction between two Fe(III) ions in the inner structure of the
   biopolymer which increased as the degree of substitution of the
   galactomannan decreased, and also showed the resulting thermal
   stability. The complexes impart a new possibility of providing essential
   metal ions in dietary foods since decomplexation of the complexes can
   occur at different pH values existing in the human body.},

Title = {Rumen digestion of rice straw structural polysaccharides: effect of

Journal = {ANIMAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1642-1647},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The combined effects of lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) extract
   supplementation and ammonia treatment of rice straw (Oryza sativa,
   variety Thaibonnet) on the ruminal digestion of cell wall components
   were investigated in six continuous culture systems using a randomised
   complete block design. Data were fitted to second-order polynomial
   models. Untreated rice straw had higher contents of ash-free cell wall
   residues (CWR; 763 v. 687 g/kg dry matter (DM)) and non-cellulosic
   sugars (191 v. 166 g/kg DM) than treated rice straw Ammoniation
   preferentially removed xylose, which resulted in a lower
   xylose-to-arabinose ratio (5.1 v. 5.8). In absence of lucerne
   supplementation and ammoniation, degradability coefficients were 0.54,
   0.46, 0.58, 0.54, 0.42 and 0.60 for cellulose glucose, xylose,
   arabinose, galactose, mannose and uronic acids, respectively Both
   factors had significant effects on the microbial degradation of
   structural polysaccharides. With lucerne extract at an optimal level,
   ammonia treatment increased ash-free cell wall degradation by more than
   10\%. The degradability coefficients were increased by ammoniation
   without any significant interaction with lucerne extract, except for
   glucose, whose degradability was mostly influenced by lucerne extract in
   a curvilinear way. The comparison of regression coefficients in cell
   wall and CWR models suggested that ammoniation improved the
   degradabilities of xylose, galactose and mannose by partly solubilising
   the corresponding hemicelluloses and by improving the susceptibility of
   the remaining fraction to microbial attack, whereas it increased the
   degradability of arabinose only by favouring microbial attack.},

Journal = {TREE PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {27},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Mixtures of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Acacia mearnsii de Wildeman
   are twice as productive as E. globulus monocultures growing on the same
   site in East Gippsland, Victoria, Australia, possibly because of
   increased nitrogen (N) availability owing to N(2) fixation by A.
   mearnsii. To investigate whether N(2) fixation by A. mearnsii could
   account for the mixed-species growth responses, we assessed N(2)
   fixation by the accretion method and the 15 N natural abundance method.
   Nitrogen gained by E. globulus and A. mearnsii mixtures and monocultures
   was calculated by the accretion method with plant and soil samples
   collected 10 years after plantation establishment. Nitrogen in biomass
   and soil confirmed that A. meamsii influenced N dynamics. Assuming that
   the differences in soil, forest floor litter and biomass N of plots
   containing A. mearnsii compared with E. globulus monocultures were due
   to N(2) fixation, the 10-year annual mean rates of N(2) fixation were 38
   and 86 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in 1: 1 mixtures and A. mearnsii monocultures,
   respectively. Nitrogen fixation by A. mearnsii could not be quantified
   on the basis of the natural abundance of 15 N because such factors as
   mycorrhization type and fractionation of N isotopes during N cycling
   within the plant confounded the effect of the N source on the N isotopic
   signature of plants. This study shows that A. mearnsii fixed significant
   quantities of N(2) when mixed with E. globulus. A decline in delta(15)N
   values of E. globulus and A. mearnsii with time, from 2 to 10 years, is
   further evidence that N(2) was fixed and cycled through the stands. The
   increased aboveground biomass production of E. globutus trees in
   mixtures when compared with monocultures can be attributed to increases
   in N availability.},

Abstract = {The taxonomic affiliations of nineteen root-nodule bacteria isolated
   from the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Mexico, Ecuador and
   Brazil were investigated by analyses of 16S rRNA and of four
   protein-coding housekeeping genes. One strain from Mexico could be
   assigned to Rhizobium etli and two from Brazil to Rhizobium leucaenae,
   whereas another from Mexico corresponded to a recently described
   bean-nodulating species-level lineage related to R. etli and Rhizobium
   phaseoli. Ten strains isolated in Ecuador and Mexico corresponded to
   three novel Rhizobium lineages that fall into the R. phaseoli/R.
   etli/Rhizobium leguminosarum clade. One of those lineages, with
   representatives isolated mostly from Ecuador, seems to be dominant in
   beans from that Andean region. Only one of the Mexican strains clustered
   within the Rhizobium tropici clade, but as an independent lineage.
   Interestingly, four strains were affiliated with species within the
   Rhizobium radiobacter clade. The existence of yet non-described native
   Rhizobium lineages in both the Andean and Mesoamerican areas is

Abstract = {Mixed plantations of a Eucalyptus species with a nitrogen-fixing tree
   species can produce significantly higher quantities of aboveground
   biomass than monocultures. However, if species or sites are not chosen
   correctly, one species may suppress the growth of the other and mixtures
   may be less productive than monocultures. Based on a study of Eucalyptus
   globulus and Acacia mearnsii, this paper discusses the species
   attributes and site factors that should be considered to improve the
   probability of increasing biomass production using mixed-species
   plantations.
   In an 11-year-old mixed-species trial of E. globulus and A. mearnsii in
   southeastern Australia aboveground biomass production was twice as high
   in mixtures containing 50\% E. globulus and 50\% A. mearnsii than in E.
   globulus monocultures. There are three main types of interactions that
   led to this growth outcome: competition, competitive reduction and
   facilitation. Facilitation occurred as A. mearnsii fixed significant
   quantities of N, both in monoculture and when mixed with E. globulus. In
   addition, not only rates of N but also those of P cycling through
   litterfall were significantly higher in mixed stands than E. globulus
   monocultures, pointing to the importance of selecting a nitrogen-fixing
   species that is capable of N fixation and subsequent fast nutrient
   cycling through litterfall. Mixed stands developed stratified canopies,
   such that E. globulus eventually overtopped A. mearnsii after 9 years.
   This resulted in an increase in light capture at the stand level and a
   reduction in competition for light for E. globulus, a relatively shade
   intolerant species. This illustrates the importance of selecting species
   based on their height growth dynamics and relative shade tolerances, to
   ensure that neither species is suppressed by the other and that the less
   tolerant species is not overtopped by the more shade tolerant species.
   In addition to species attributes, site factors, such as soil nitrogen,
   phosphorus and water availability, play an important role in the
   interactions and processes occurring in mixtures. In a pot trial
   containing monocultures and mixtures of E. globulus and A. mearnsii,
   mixtures produced more biomass than monocultures of either species at
   low levels of N fertiliser. However, at high levels of N fertiliser E.
   globulus suppressed A. mearnsii and the biomass production of mixtures
   was not significantly different to that of E. globulus monocultures.
   This suggests that mixtures should only be planted on sites where the
   processes and interactions between species will increase the
   availability of, or reduce competition for, a major limiting resource
   for growth at that site.
   The accurate prediction of successful mixed-species combinations and
   sites is difficult due to the limited number of studies on mixtures. A
   mechanistic approach is required to examine the interactions and
   processes that occur in mixtures and to demonstrate why certain

Abstract = {Feed intake, digestibility and body weight change of lambs fed basal
   diets of maize stover harvested at three stages of maturity and
   supplemented with graded levels (0, 150, 300 and 450 g per head per day)
   of desmodium (Desmodium intortum cv. Greenleaf) hay were studied. The
   maize stovers were harvested at 30, 22 and 12\% grain moisture content
   which were designated as stages I, II and III, respectively. The crude
   protein (CP) content of the stovers showed a decreasing trend whereas
   the fibre contents showed an increase from stages I to III. The
   desmodium hay had higher CP, phenolic compounds, calcium, sulphur and
   manganese contents and lower fibre (neutral and acid detergent fibres,
   cellulose and hemicellulose) contents than the stovers. Maize stover,
   total dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) intake showed a decreasing
   trend (p>0.05) with increasing stage of maturity of the stover. The CP
   intake was significantly higher (p<0.05) in sheep fed maize stover
   harvested at stage I than at stages II and III. Total DM, OM and CP
   intake increased whereas maize stover DM intake showed a significant
   decrease (p<0.05) with increasing level of supplementation. Desmodium
   hay constituted about 28, 47 and 66\% of the total DM intake and, on
   average, there was a substitution of about 12, 21 and 37\% of the stover
   by the desmodium hay at 150, 300 and 450 g of supplementation,
   respectively.
   Dry matter, OM and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) digestibilities showed
   a decreasing trend (p>0.05) with increasing stage of maturity. Crude
   protein digestibility and the intakes of digestible OM and metabolizable
   energy (ME) were significantly higher (p<0.05) in sheep feeding on maize
   stover harvested at stage I than stage III and showed a general
   declining trend with increasing stage of maturity of the stover.
   Supplementation resulted in improved digestibility of the diet. There
   was a significant increase (p<0.05) in CP digestibility, digestible OM
   intake, digestible organic matter in the DM (DOMD), ME concentration of
   the diet and ME intake with increasing level of supplementation. The
   body weight gain showed a significant increase (p<0.05) with increasing
   level of supplementation whereas all sheep without supplement lost body
   weight. The weight loss increased with increasing stage of maturity of
   the stover. Considering DM intake and digestibility, 300 g of desmodium
   hay appears to be an optimum level of supplementation, under similar
   conditions to the current study. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {Plants catalyze the biosynthesis of a large number of non-protein amino
   acids, which are usually toxic for other organisms. In this review, the
   chemistry and metabolism of N-heterocyclic non-protein amino acids from
   plants are described. These N-heterocyclic non-protein amino acids are
   composed of beta-substituted alanines and include mimosine,
   beta-pyrazol-1-yl-l-alanine, willardiine, isowillardiine, and lathyrine.
   These beta-substituted alanines consisted of an N-heterocyclic moiety
   and an alanyl side chain. This review explains how these individual
   moieties are derived from their precursors and how they are used as the
   substrate for biosynthesizing the respective N-heterocyclic non-protein
   amino acids. In addition, known catabolism and possible role of these
   non-protein amino acids in the actual host is explained.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {132},

Abstract = {Mimosinase degrades the non-protein amino acid mimosine and is thought
   to have evolved from cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL) via gene
   duplication. However, no study has, to date, compared the molecular
   characteristics of mimosinase and CBL. We therefore cloned mimosinase
   and CBL from the Mimosoideae subfamily member Mimosa pudica (Mp) and
   explored the molecular relationship between mimosinase and CBL for the
   first time. The recombinant Mp mimosinase degraded both mimosine and
   cystathionine with a much higher turnover number (k(cat)) for mimosine
   compared with cystathionine, and Mp CBL utilized only cystathionine as a
   substrate. The critical residues implicated in the substrate binding of
   Arabidopsis thaliana CBL (Tyr-127, Arg-129, Tyr-181, and Arg-440) were
   highly conserved in both Mp mimosinase and CBL. However, homology
   modeling and molecular simulation of these enzymes predicted variations
   in the residues that interact with substrates. A mutation experiment on
   Mp mimosinase revealed that the disruption of a disulfide bond in the
   vicinity of the pyridoxal-5 `-phosphate domain increased the enzyme's
   preference toward cystathionine. Treatment of Mp mimosinase with a
   disulfide-cleavage agent also decreased mimosinase activity.
   Furthermore, mutation near the conserved binding residue altered the
   substrate preference between mimosine and cystathionine. Molecular
   dynamics simulations of Mp mimosinase suggested a closer coordination of
   the residues that interact with mimosine at the active site compared
   with cystathionine, indicating a more compact pocket size for mimosine
   degradation. This study thus may provide new insights into the molecular
   diversification of CBL, a C-S lyase, into the C-N lyase mimosinase in
   the Mimosoideae subfamily.},

Year = {2000},
Volume = {85},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {89-98},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {A study was conducted to evaluate the nutritive potential value of six
   species of acacia tree leaves: Acacia brevispica, nubica, tortilis,
   seyal, nilotica, and mellifera from Kenya. A wide variability in
   chemical composition, polyphenolics and gas production and in situ dry
   matter (DM) degradability was recorded. Crude protein (CP) content
   ranged from 134 to 213 g/kg DM. The content of neutral detergent fibre
   (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) ranged from 154 to 308 and from 114
   to 251 g/kg DM, respectively, and was significantly (p < 0.05) different
   among the species. A. nubica had the lowest fibre, and polyphenolics
   concentration and the highest potential gas production and DM
   degradability. Mineral concentrations varied among species. All were
   relatively poor in phosphorus, moderate in calcium, magnesium and
   sulphur and rich in most microelements. Iron and selenium ranged from
   132 to 459 and 13 to >100 mg/g (p < 0.05), respectively. The rate of gas
   production was highest in A. nubica (0.1165 h(-1)) and lowest in A.
   brevispica (0.0295 h(-1)). A similar trend was observed with in situ DM
   degradability. A strong relationship between the cell-wall fraction and
   gas production after 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 was established. A weak and
   negative correlation was recorded between total extractable phenolics
   (TEPH), total extractable tannins (TET) and total condensed tannins
   (TCT) with gas production.
   The ranking order of the acacia species on the basis of their potential
   degradability was A. nubica > A. tortilis > A. mellifera > A. brevispica
   > A. seyal > A. nilotica. It is concluded that based on the moderate to
   high CP values and the degradation characteristics, these species have
   potential as livestock fodder. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Booktitle = {MICROBIAL STRATEGIES FOR CROP IMPROVEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Pages = {325-351},
Abstract = {One of the major constraints for plant productivity in tropical regions
   is low soil phosphate (Pi) availability. Phosphate ions are rendered
   unavailable for plant uptake due to adsorption onto the surface of soil
   minerals and precipitation by free aluminum and iron ions. In highly
   weathered soils, this is so intense that plant crops commonly exhibit
   Pi-deficiency. High rates of soluble Pi-fertilizers are employed to meet
   plant P demands. However, the large quantity of Pi required in order to
   offset the high Pi-retention capacity of the soils and the high cost
   associated with it makes it inaccessible to the vast majority of growers
   in the region. An alternative means of improving plant Pi-uptake from
   insoluble native and applied rock phosphate is the use of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. These fungi form a symbiotic association with
   most plants and improve the efficiency of associated plants to take up
   Pi from the soil solution. Other soil microorganisms commonly known as
   phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms (PSM) can replenish soil solution
   Pi by solubilizing complex phosphorus compounds found in soil or added
   to it, mostly through the release of organic acids. In this chapter, an
   attempt is made to highlight the interactions of these two distinct
   groups of soil microorganisms and the mechanisms by which they
   facilitate plant available Pi and enhance plant growth in the soils of
   the tropics.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {182},

Abstract = {Rhizobium leguminosarum secretes two extracellular glycanases, PlyA and
   PlyB, that tan degrade exopolysaccharide (EPS) and carboxymethyl
   cellulose (CMC), which is used as a model substrate of plant cell wall
   cellulose polymers. When grown on agar medium, CMC degradation occurred
   only directly below colonies of R. leguminosarum, suggesting that the
   enzymes remain attached to the bacteria. Unexpectedly, when a
   PlyA-PlyB-secreting colony was grown in close proximity to mutants
   unable to produce or secrete PlyA and PlyB, CMC degradation occurred
   below that part of the mutant colonies closest to the wild type. There
   was no CMC degradation in the region between the colonies. By growing
   PlyB-secreting colonies an a lawn of CMC-nondegrading mutants, ne could
   observe a halo of CMC degradation around the colony, Using various
   mutant strains, we demonstrate that PlyB diffuses beyond the edge of the
   colony but does not degrade CMC unless it is in contact with the
   appropriate colony surface. PlyA appears to remain attached to the cells
   since no such diffusion of PlyA activity was observed. EPS defective
   mutants could secrete bath PlyA and PlyB, but these enzymes were
   inactive unless they came into contact with an EPS' strain, indicating
   that EPS is required for activation of PlyA and PlyB, However, we were
   unable to activate CMC degradation with a crude EPS fraction, indicating
   that activation of CMC degradation may require an intermediate in EPS
   biosynthesis. Transfer of PlyB to Agrobacterium tumefaciens enabled it
   to degrade CMC, but this was only observed if it was grown on a lawn of
   R. leguminosarum. This indicates that the surface of A. tumefaciens is
   inappropriate to activate CMC degradation by PlyB, Analysis of CMC
   degradation by other rhizobia suggests that activation of secreted
   glycanases by surface components may occur in other species.},

Abstract = {Tropical forests have a high diversity of plant species; are they

   this question by examining the symbiotic rhizobium bacteria that
   nodulate a diverse pool of forest legume species in Brazil. The 44
   strains studied had been isolated from 29 legume tree species
   representing 13 tribes including all three subfamilies of the
   Leguminosae, and were chosen to represent major groups from a larger
   sample that had previously been characterized by SDS-PAGE of total
   proteins. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequence was determined, corresponding
   to positions 44-303 in the Escherichia coli sequence. Fifteen sequences
   were found, including six novel ones. However, all but one of them could
   be assigned to a genus because they grouped closely with sequences from
   previously described rhizobial species. Fast-growing strains had
   sequences similar to Rhizobium spp., Sinorhizobium spp. or Mesorhizobium
   spp., while the slow-growing strains had sequences similar to
   Bradyrhizobium spp. One strain with an intermediate growth rate had a
   unique sequence which indicated that the strain might belong to the
   genus Azorhizobium. Although the strains showed a variety of sequences,
   it was surprising that these strains isolated from taxonomically very
   diverse host plants in previously unexplored environments were mostly
   very similar to strains described previously, largely from agricultural

   show that when expressed in NGR234 cured of its symbiotic plasmid (=
   ANU265) or when purified as a fusion protein (MBP-NoeE), NoeE transfers
   sulfate from PAPS to fucosylated lipochitin-oligosaccharides. Enzyme
   assays showed that sulfotransferase activity is dependent on the
   presence of an acyl group (stearic and vaccenic acids were tested) since
   mo activity was detected when fucosylated oligochitins (oligomers of two
   to six N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units) were used as substrates, Thus, NoeE
   is unique in that it is the only characterized sulfotransferase that is
   specific for fucosylated Nod factors, It probably acts after NodA, which
   acylates the amino-sugar backbone.},

Abstract = {Plants have evolved various mechanisms to synthesize diverse range of

   metabolites possess therapeutic potential, some can be potentially
   harmful to human and animal health when consumed in large proportion.
   Proteins, peptides, and nonprotein amino acids are products of plant
   biochemical pathways with proven beneficial and nutritional effects.
   Despite these benefits, the in vivo toxicities associated with certain
   plantderived proteins, peptides, and non-protein amino acids pose a
   significant risk to humans and animals. Symptoms of poisoning include
   nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair and weight loss, goiter, cataracts, and
   infertility. Even though plant processing methods such as soaking and
   drying can reduce the amount of toxin contained in plants, complete
   riddance is often impossible. As such, food regulatory bodies need to
   prevent uncontrolled consumption of the listed and many other
   toxin-containing plant species to keep the public safe. For this
   purpose, this review collates crucial insights into the sources, and in

Title = {Potential of Molecular Weight and Structure of Tannins to Reduce Methane
   Emissions from Ruminants: A Review},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: Regardless of the production system adopted, ruminant
   livestock contribute to greenhouse emissions that are associated with
   climate change. Among the greenhouse gases, enteric methane produced
   from the rumen is of the greatest concern because it is the largest
   single source of livestock emissions. Among the different dietary
   strategies examined to decrease methanogenesis in ruminants, the use of
   tannins shows promise, but has received only moderate attention.
   However, tannins are abundant in both tropical and temperate plants and
   so are widely available globally and may be an economical approach for
   livestock producers to mitigate enteric methane emissions. This review
   explores the challenges and opportunities of using dietary tannins to
   reduce enteric methane emissions from ruminants.
   Abstract: There is a need to reduce enteric methane (CH4) to ensure the
   environmental sustainability of ruminant production systems. Tannins are
   naturally found in both tropical and temperate plants, and have been
   shown to consistently decrease urinary nitrogen (N) excretion when
   consumed by ruminants. However, the limited number of in vivo studies
   conducted indicates that the effects of tannins on intake,
   digestibility, rumen fermentation, CH4 production and animal performance
   vary depending on source, type, dose, and molecular weight (MW). There
   are two main types of tannin in terrestrial plants: condensed tannin
   (CT; high MW) and hydrolysable tannin (HT; low MW). Consumption of CT
   and HT by ruminants can reduce N excretion without negatively affecting
   animal performance. High MW tannins bind to dietary protein, while low
   MW tannins affect rumen microbes, and thus, irrespective of type of
   tannin, N excretion is affected. The structure of high MW tannin is more
   diverse compared with that of low MW tannin, which may partly explain
   the inconsistent effects of CT on CH4 production reported in in vivo
   studies. In contrast, the limited number of in vivo studies with low MW
   HT potentially shows a consistent decrease in CH4 production, possibly
   attributed to the gallic acid subunit. Further in vivo studies are
   needed to determine the effects of tannins, characterized by MW and
   structural composition, on reducing CH4 emissions and improving animal
   performance in ruminants.},

Abstract = {The effects of four types of tropical protein-rich trees on nutrient
   digestibility, nitrogen (N) balance, urinary purine derivative (PD)
   excretion and blood metabolites in four Thai Brahman cattle (290 +/- 2.5
   kg) were studied. The animals were fed twice daily, with each feeding
   consisting of I kg (fresh weight) rice straw and one of the four dietary
   supplements: i) 1.98 kg oven-dried rain tree pods (RTP) and 20 g premix
   (RTPP), ii) 980 g RTP and I kg sun-dried leucaena leaves and 20 g premix
   (LLRT), iii) 980 g RTP and I kg sun-dried cassia leaves and 20 g premix
   (CLRT) and iv) 980 g RTP and I kg sun-dried mulberry leaves and 20 g
   premix (MLRT). The apparent dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM)
   digestibilities were higher (p<0.05) in cattle fed the CLRT supplement
   than in those fed the other supplements, whilst the apparent
   digestibility of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) was higher (p<0.05) in
   cattle fed the CLRT and MLRT supplements than in those fed the other
   supplements. The N-balance of cattle fed LLRT and CLRT supplements was
   higher (p<0.05) than in cattle fed RTPP and MLRT supplements, whilst the
   apparent digestibility of N was highest (p<0.05) in cattle fed RTPP
   supplement, compared to the other supplements. Allantoin and PD
   excretion in the urine, and the ratios of allantoin/DOMI and PD/DOMI
   were higher (p<0.05) in cattle fed RTPP and MLRT than for those fed LLRT
   and CLRT supplements. Plasma beta-hydroxy butyrate (beta-HBA) and
   insulin concentrations were higher (p<0.05) in cattle fed RTPP
   supplement than in those fed the other supplements. The study
   demonstrated the value of using local multipurpose trees (MPTs) to
   improve Brahman cattle feeding systems in the tropics.},

   region},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region is not a major
   emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG). However, Sub-Saharan Africa is
   considered a potential future hotspot for GHG emissions because of its
   large livestock population dispersed across large arid lands, coupled
   with the inherent low digestible feeds in the region and consequently
   low productivity of livestock. In SADC, climate change is predicted to
   increase temperatures further reducing agricultural productivity.
   Therefore, there is incentive to reduce agriculture's contribution to
   GHG emissions in the SADC region. Ruminant production, a mainstay of
   rural economy, is predicted to decrease because of diminished grazing
   due to reduced rainfall and feed quality. However, ruminants' enteric
   methane (CH4) production contributes to GHG emissions. This review
   explores strategies for the SADC region to reduce CH4 by ruminants. As
   methanogenesis is an outcome of microbial activity, potential
   opportunities include selecting animals with inherent low CH4
   production; altering ruminal microbial populations to those that do not
   yield CH4; enhancing feed digestibility by feeding additives which
   improve diet quality and alter the ruminal microbiome and using specific
   forages such as seaweed or duckweed that contain plant secondary
   metabolites that may decrease methanogen populations or methanogenesis.
   These strategies are considered in terms of their potential magnitude of
   CH4 mitigation, the practicality for their implementation in the SADC
   region and their suitability to be included in the grazing-based
   livestock industries in the SADC region.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of quebracho tannins
   extract (QTE) on feed intake, dry matter (DM) digestibility, and methane
   (CH4) emissions in cattle fed low-quality Pennisetum purpureum grass.
   Five heifers (Bos taurus x Bos indicus) with an average live weight (LW)
   of 295 +/- 19 kg were allotted to five treatments (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4\%
   QTE/kg DM) in a 5 x 5 Latin square design. Intake, digestibility, and
   total methane emissions (L/day) were recorded for periods of 23 h when
   cattle were housed in open-circuit respiration chambers. Dry matter
   intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI), dry matter digestibility
   (DMD), and organic matter digestibility (OMD) were different between
   treatments with 0 and 4\% of QTE/kg DM (P < 0.05). Total volatile fatty
   acid and the molar proportion of acetate in the rumen was not affected
   (P < 0.05); however, the molar proportion of propionate increased
   linearly (P < 0.01) for treatments with 3 and 4\% QTE. Total CH4
   production decreased linearly (P < 0.01) as QTE increased in the diet,
   particularly with 3 and 4\% concentration. When expressed as DMI and OMI
   by CH4, production (L/kg) was different between treatments with 0 vs 3
   and 4\% QTE (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the addition of QTE at 2 or
   3\% of dry matter ration can decrease methane production up to 29 and
   41\%, respectively, without significantly compromising feed intake and
   nutrients digestibility.},

Abstract = {The major limitation to ruminant production in many tropical regions of
   Africa, Asia and Australia is poor nutrition. Annual growth rates of
   animals are restricted by the low nitrogen and high fibre content of the
   native grasses and crop residues that form the basis of the diets in
   these regions. Supplementation of tropical roughages with fodder trees
   and shrubs (FTS) is a promising method to alleviate nutrient
   deficiencies associated with these basal diets. However, FTS often
   contain toxins and anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) that limit their use
   as feedstuffs. Selection and breeding for cultivars that are low in
   toxins/ANFs has not been successful since the presence of these
   compounds is strongly associated with survival in many tropical
   environments. A solution to the problem, may be the rumen microorganisms
   from adapted domestic and wild ruminants that have evolved rumen
   fermentation mechanisms to transform or detoxify some of these plant
   secondary compounds. This review examines the use in ruminant feeding
   systems of FTS that contain deleterious secondary compounds; our current
   understanding of microbial interactions with these secondary compounds,
   and advances in the use of rumen biotechnology to overcome these
   limitations.},

Abstract = {Given that phosphate supplies may diminish and become uneconomic to mine
   after 2020, there is a compelling need to develop alternative industries
   to support the population on Christmas Island. Former mine sites could
   be turned into productive agricultural land, however, large-scale
   commercial agriculture has never been attempted, and, given the
   uniqueness of the island, the diversity of rhizobia prior to introducing
   legumes needed evaluation. Therefore, 84 rhizobia isolates were obtained
   from nine different hosts, both crop and introduced legumes, located at
   seven sites across the island. Based on 16S rRNA and recA gene sequence
   analysis, the isolates grouped into 13 clades clustering within the
   genus Bradyrhizobium, Ensifer, Cupriavidus and Rhizobium. According to
   the sequences of their symbiosis genes nodC and nifH, the isolates were
   classified into 12 and 11 clades, respectively, and clustered closest to
   tropical or crop legume isolates. Moreover, the symbiosis gene phylogeny
   and Multi Locus Sequence Analysis gene phylogeny suggested vertical
   transmission in the Alpha-rhizobia but horizontal transmission within
   the Beta-rhizobia. Furthermore, this study provides evidence of a large
   diversity of endemic rhizobia associated with both crop and introduced
   legumes, and highlights the necessity of inoculation for common bean,
   chickpea and soybean on the Island. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {Ruminant livestock production in the tropics, particularly when based on
   pastures, is frequently blamed for being detrimental to the environment,
   allegedly contributing to: (1) degradation and destruction of
   ecosystems, including degradation and loss of soil, water and
   biodiversity; and (2) climate change (global warming). In this paper we
   argue that, rather than being detrimental, tropical forage legumes can
   have a positive impact on the environment, mainly due to key attributes
   that characterize the Leguminosae (Fabaceae) family: (1) symbiotic
   nitrogen fixation; (2) high nutritive value; (3) deep-reaching tap-root
   system; (4) wide taxonomic and genetic diversity; and (5) presence of
   particular secondary metabolites. Although there are also potential
   negative aspects, such as soil acidification and the risks of introduced
   legumes becoming invasive weeds, we submit that legumes have potential
   to contribute significantly to sustainable intensification of livestock
   production in the tropics, along with the provision of ecosystem
   services. To further assess, document and realize this potential,
   research for development needs in a range of areas are indicated.},

   metabolites secreted by the SM25 strain, which carries most of the

   carbamoyl and methyl substituents on the nonreducing terminal residue
   and an acetyl moiety on the fucosyl residue on the reducing-terminal
   residue as determined by mass spectrometry. We have reported previously
   that the root hair cell actin cytoskeleton from bean responds with a
   rapid fragmentation of the actin bundles within 5 min of NF exposure,
   and also is accompanied by increases in the apical influxes and
   intracellular calcium levels. In this article, we report that
   methyl-bearing NFs are more active in inducing root hair curling and
   actin cytoskeleton rearrangements than nonmethylated NFs. However, the

Title = {Ecology of seed and seedling growth for conservation and restoration of
   tropical dry forest : a review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-52},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Dry forests are among the most threatened ecosystems and have been
   extensively converted into grasslands, secondary forest, savanna or
   agricultural land. Knowledge of seed germination and seedling
   establishment is required for the success of efforts on restoration of
   these forests. This review focuses on the ecological requirements at
   seed and seedling stages, and collates the current knowledge of seed
   viability, dormancy, germination pattern and seedling behaviour of dry
   tropical tree species. The spatio-temporal variations within the
   tropical dry forest biome in soil moisture, light, temperature,
   nutrients and intensity of predation, significantly affect the seed and
   seedling traits of component species. The majority of dry tropical
   species possess orthodox seeds which are characterized by dormancy,
   while a few have recalcitrant seeds which possess little or no dormancy.
   Seed coat dormancy, which can be overcome by mechanical or acid
   scarification or sometimes by transit through animal guts, is most
   prevalent in the dry tropical forest species. Persistent species
   dominating the undisturbed portions of the forest have bigger seeds
   compared to those that mostly occur in disturbed regions and require
   shade for the survival of their seedlings. Shade demand is associated
   with drought endurance, and may be absolute in species such as Guettarda
   parviflora and Coccoloba microstachya, or facultative as in Plumeria
   alba and Bursera simaruba. The fluctuation in temperature significantly
   affects seed germination in several species of dry Afromontane forest
   trees of Ethiopia. Seedling mortality is primarily a function of
   moisture stress during the dry period. Adaptive responses of seedlings
   to drought stress include increased chlorophyll content, for example in
   Acacia catechu, and root biomass, as in several dry forest species (for
   example Drypetes parvifolia, Teclia verdoornia) of Ghana. Mulching,
   application of fertilizers, interplanting of leguminous species and
   mycorrhizal inoculation are useful tools for promoting seedling
   establishment in nutrient-poor dry tropical soils. Periodic forest
   fires, and predation affect recruitment and seedling development
   according to their intensity. Many species experiencing frequent fires
   have evolved thick seed coats, produce fire-hardy seedling, or escape
   the effect by temporal separation of seed dispersal and fire events.
   Predation may result in abortion of fruits or may enhance germination
   and recruitment by scarification and dispersal, as in most species of
   the Guanacaste dry forest. Exposure to elevated CO2 has increased
   relative growth rate, total leaf area and water use efficiency in most
   of the dry tropical seedling tested, but the magnitude of the effect has
   varied markedly among species. Due to the availability of a large source
   of energy, large seeds show higher germination percentage, greatet
   seddling survival and increased growth. Seeds originating from different
   provenances exhibit differences in germination and seedling growth (for
   example Prosopis cineraria, Albizia lebbeck, Eucalyptus camaldulensis
   and Acacia mangium), efficiency of nodulation (for example Acacia
   nilotica, A. auriculiformis), and stress resistance (for example Populus
   deltoides, Dalbergia sissoo). The review points out the need for
   coordinated, long-term, field-based studies for identification of
   multiple cues and niches for germination, on seed and seedling dynamics
   in response to fire, and on within-species genetic variability for
   selection of suitable provenances.
   Field-based studies at species and community levels are also needed to
   permit manipulations of biotic components to augment the recruitment of
   desired species and to suppress that of undesirable species.},

Abstract = {Minimum tillage and vegetative barriers can conserve soil and water
   resources in the steep-sloping highlands of East Africa but there has
   been little adoption by smallholder farmers. Soil conservation
   efficiency and short-term economic benefits provided by tillage and
   vegetative barriers were assessed over four cropping seasons to
   understand performance under local farming conditions. Minimum tillage
   was compared with regular tillage and vegetative barriers (leucaena and
   Napier) with no barriers. Maize and soybean yields were greater with
   than, without vegetative barriers, except with Napier barriers when
   minimum tillage was practiced where strong root competition occured.
   Cumulatively for the four cropping seasons, Napier barriers with regular
   tillage conserved most soil (72\%) followed by Napier with minimum
   tillage (53\%). The least soil (1\%) was conserved for minimum tillage
   without barriers and leucaena barriers were intermediate in decreasing
   soil erosion. The highest positive marginal rate of returns (MRRs) were
   realized under leucaena barriers with regular tillage (2.09) followed by
   Napier with regular tillage (1.32). Minimum tillage without barriers had
   the lowest positive MRRs (0.08). Future increase in the price of key
   inputs would have greater depressive effect on the MRRs of Napier
   barriers with regular tillage than leucaena barriers with regular
   tillage. Minimum tillage without barriers was inefficient in soil
   conservation particularly when rainfall was intense and had poor MRRs.
   Leucaena barriers conserved less soil than Napier barriers but were more
   economically attractive, demonstrating a clear trade-off between soil
   erosion that is likely to impact crop yields in the long-term and
   short-term economic benefits. Napier barriers with regular tillage
   present a win-win scenario due to efficient soil conservation and
   attractive economic returns provided future prices of labour and Napier
   cuttings remain stable. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A review of anti-nutritive factors limiting potential use of Acacia
   angustissima as a ruminant feed},

Abstract = {Acacia angustissima is a tropical legume which originated from Central
   America and has potential as a protein supplement to improve ruminant
   nutrition if the adverse effects of anti-nutritive factors can be
   diminished. It has a high nitrogen content and possesses many
   advantageous growth characteristics such a high leaf yield, drought
   tolerance, adaptation to acidic infertile soils and large temperature
   variations. However, the widespread implementation of supplementation
   practices with A. angustissima is currently impeded by reports of
   anti-nutritive/toxic effects in feeding trials with both monogastric and
   ruminant animals. Although the plant contains an array of secondary
   metabolites in high concentrations there have been few documented
   reports of toxicity under conventional feeding. The intent of this paper
   is to review the current knowledge on the secondary plant metabolites in
   A. angustissima, their toxic and anti-nutritive effects and
   investigations of rumen microbial interactions with these compounds.
   Condensed tannins, simple phenolics and non-protein amino acids have
   been investigated experimentally for their role in the reported toxicity
   of A. angustissima but recent studies have not been able to establish a
   definitive link between these classes of compounds and toxicity.
   Attempts to reproduce toxicity in the ruminant animal have also proved
   difficult particularly when the plant comprizes less than 300 g/kg of
   the dry matter intake. Ruminal adaptation to the plant occurs in that
   the major non-protein amino acids are degraded by rumen microorganisms
   while the condensed tannins promote populations of organisms which are
   tolerant to these compounds. In vitro studies indicate that condensed
   tannins in the plant could severely impair nitrogen digestibilility
   whereas digestibility trials in ruminants show favourable responses in
   nitrogen utilization when A. angustissima is provided as a supplement.
   Further research needs to focus on feeding trials in ruminants which
   demonstrate the nutritional benefits and toxic potential of this plant
   at varying inclusion rates in the diet. Crown Copyright (C) 2007

Title = {Greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration associated with

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the Agriculture, Forest, and Other
   Land Use sector account for 23\% of net global anthropogenic emissions.
   However, effective conservation agriculture practices can sequester
   carbon (C) up to 1 m in soil depth and vegetation biomass. Integrated
   Crop-Livestock-Forestry (ICLF) systems attempt to ensure sustainable
   agricultural production by combining various agricultural, livestock,
   and forestry production systems. This bibliographic review aims to
   present and discuss ICLF systems and their advantages and disadvantages
   compared with conventional systems, achieving a better understanding of
   the sources and sinks of GHGs (CH4, N2O, and CO2). Integrated systems
   exist in tropical and temperate climates with different practices,
   arrangements, designs, and modalities. Intercropping species with
   different root structures provides more ecological interactions that
   enhance biodiversity, soil quality, and C sequestration while reducing
   GHG emissions. Yet, ICLF systems are complex and require technical
   assistance and support for being implemented, besides an extensive
   initial investment that increases the cost of operation. A relevant
   carbon sink in ICLF systems is carbon from tree biomass, where the wood
   can be used for various purposes. Timber for sawmills and general
   construction has a longer C immobilization time. Methane from enteric
   fermentation is the greatest contributor to GHG emissions in livestock
   and ICLF systems. Nitrous oxide is released primarily from synthetic
   fertilizers (when applied), manure deposited on pastures, and the
   decomposition of plant residues. Carbon dioxide is emitted to a lesser
   extent from the application of lime and urea. Many studies do not
   include all compartments in the C balance and often focus on only one
   GHG or compartment of C. Accordingly, more studies on the sources and
   sinks of C and their potential to offset GHG emissions in terms of CO2
   equivalent are urged.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Although commercial forest plantations have been termed ``green
   deserts{''}, several studies from the last two decades have reported the
   opposite. These studies suggest that forest plantations can catalyze the
   natural regeneration in their understory and, thus, contribute to
   biodiversity conservation. In order to obtain a wide and multi-faceted
   panorama of forest plantations and their potential contribution to
   biodiversity conservation and forest restoration, previous studies
   investigating natural regeneration under forest plantations have been
   reviewed, highlighting those carried out in Brazil. Methods and
   environmental conditions are quite variable among studies, making
   generalizations difficult. Nevertheless, results indicate that
   historical and environmental factors, such as canopy density and light
   availability, plantation age, forest species, distance from natural
   forests, silvicultural practices, and previous land use directly or
   indirectly affect natural regeneration richness, abundance and community
   structure under forest plantations. The reviewed studies, as a whole,
   reinforce the idea that commercial forest plantations can act as
   environments of biodiversity, at least for some life forms, and, in
   addition, can facilitate the restoration of native forests. Although the
   Brazilian studies are abundant, they have been restricted to a few
   regions and biomes and are mostly descriptive studies. Experimental
   studies focusing on specific factors that affect the natural
   regeneration dynamic under forest plantations as well as on management
   techniques in order to combine high production and biodiversity
   conservation are desirable. Nonetheless, other biomes and regions rather
   than those already studied, where forest plantation is a common land
   use, should be considered.},

Journal = {SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {75},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study examined the effects of dietary inclusion of tanniferous
   leaves of Ficus infcctoria as a protectant of proteins on the
   performance of lambs. Twenty-four lambs were randomly divided into four
   groups of six each in a completely randomized block design and fed four
   iso-nitrogenous supplements formulated to contain 0, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0\%
   condensed tannins (CT) through dried and ground leaves of F infectoria.
   The diets were designated as CT- 1.0, CT- 1.5 and CT-2.0, respectively,
   and fed to lambs on a basal diet of wheat straw to meet requirements for
   maintenance and growth. Blood-biochemical profile was monitored in all
   the lambs at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180 days of feeding. The average daily
   growth rate and wool growth for a period of 180 days showed a
   significant (P < 0.05) increase by the supplementation of CT at 1.5\%
   through E infectoria leaves. Although addition of CT up to 1.5\% in the
   supplement did not interfere with the nutrient intake or digestibility,
   a depressing effect on DM, OM and ADF digestibility at 2.0\% CT level
   was apparent without any detrimental affect on intake. Digestible crude
   protein (DCP) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) values of the
   composite diets were comparable, except for significantly (P<0.05) lower
   TDN (\%) in CT-2.Othan thecontrol. Intake of DCP, digestible organic
   matter and TDN was comparable irrespective of dietary treatments, though
   lambs under CT2.0 had significantly (P < 0.05) lower intake as compared
   to their counterparts given diet CT-1.0. Feeding of CT containing diets
   particularly at 1.5 and 2.0\% levels significantly (P < 0.05) influenced
   N utilization and improved its retention, however, the microbial protein
   synthesis as estimated by urinary excretion of purine derivatives was
   not affected by the dietary treatments. Haernatological (haemoglobin and
   packed cell volume) and biochemical parameters (serum glucose, total
   protein, albumin, globulin, A:G ratio,aianine arninotransferase and
   aspartate arninotransferase were similar among the dietary treatments
   except for significant (P < 0.05) reduction in serum urea concentration
   of lambs fed 1.5 and 2.0\% CT in the supplement. It may be concluded
   that CT from E infectoria leaves at 1.5\% in supplement could be used as
   a protectant of proteins for improving the performance of lambs. (c)

Journal = {LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {This study evaluated the synergism between oilseed {[}50:50 noug
   (Guizotia abyssinica) and groundnut] cake (OSC) and tanniferous feeds
   (pods of Acacia albida and Sesbania sesban leaves) in two experiments.
   S. sesban has a lower content of soluble phenolics than A. albida pods
   (196 vs. 270 g/kg). Dietary treatments during trial 1 comprised teff
   (Eragrotis tef) straw given ad Libitum supplemented per day with the
   following: 168 g of OSC alone (T1), or 100 g of OSC plus 135 g of
   sesbania leaves (T2) or 100 g of OSC plus either 50 (T3),100 (T4) or 200
   g (T5) of acacia pods. During trial 2 dietary treatments comprised T1,
   T2, T5 and an additional treatment comprised 100 g sesbania leaves plus
   200 g pods which were fed to sheep as a mixture. One strategy (sequence)
   was to give the OSC following complete consumption of either sesbania
   leaves or acacia pods while the other strategy (mixture) was to mix OSC
   with either of these forages before feeding. The sequence strategy was
   used in trial 1 while both strategies were used in trial 2. Each
   experiment used 30 sheep in a RCB design. During trial one incremental
   intake of pods resulted to linear increases (P < 0.05) of live weight
   gain (LWG), organic matter (OM) and nitrogen (N) intake but had no
   effect on straw intake. T5 and T2 had similar LWG (60 vs. 56 g) and
   intake. During trial 2 total nitrogen (N) intake was within the range
   12.0 to 12.9 g/day for diets containing OSC. Dietary treatments had no
   effect on the intake of teff straw, but the diet supplemented with OSC
   alone had lower dry matter (DM) intake (g/day; approximate to 595) than
   the sesbania leaves (637; P < 0.08) and acacia (694; P < 0.001) diets.
   The digestibilities of DM, OM and neutral detergent fibre were similar
   among diets. Faecal N (g/day) was similar between the sesbania leaves
   (5.11) and acacia (5.29) diets which were higher (P < 0.01) than on OSC
   alone. Sheep fed on the sesbania diets excreted similar urinary N as did
   those on acacia (4.04 v. 3.39 g/day) but more (P < 0.05) than those on
   OSC done (2.9 g/day). Sheep had similar rates of LWG (g/day) on sesbania
   leaves (57) and OSC alone (62) which were inferior to the acacia diets
   (74). The difference in LWG between sesbania and acacia groups was small
   using the mixture strategy (10 g/day; P > 0.05) and substantial using
   the sequence strategy (23 g/day; P < 0.01). Similarly, the LWG
   differences between strategies were small (2 g/day; P > 0.05) for the
   sesbania and large (15 g/day; P < 0.05) for the acacia diets. A
   comparison between the OSC-acacia mixture and acacia-sesbania mixture
   suggested that sesbania leaves could replace OSC with rather marginal
   increases in LWG. The discussion was structured to explain why the
   sequence strategy could offer a greater chance of interaction between
   tannin and OSC-protein than the mixture strategy and why such
   interaction was most probable with A. albida pods than with S. sesban.
   It was concluded that it is beneficial to feed sheep on OSC following
   the intake of tanniferous feeds as this could support superior LWG. (C)

Abstract = {Too often soils and their constraints are ignored when designing or
   evaluating agroforestry systems. This paper reviews the nature of soil
   constraints in the humid and semi-arid tropics and how these limitations
   affect plant/soil interactions related to nutrient additions, losses,
   and cycling via litter-soil organic matter (SOM) pathways in
   agroforestry systems. The ability of agroforestry systems to enhance
   nutrient availability on infertile soils is very limited compared to
   systems on fertile soils. On both, however, agroforestry systems can
   play an important role in reducing nutrient losses. Litter production
   and quantities of nutrients recycled in litter are greater on fertile
   than on infertile soils, however, management techniques for accelerating
   nutrient fluxes through pruning appear to hold promise for increasing
   plant productivity on the latter soils. Much more information is needed
   on the magnitude of and controls on below-ground litter production and
   how it can be managed. Litter decomposition and SOM dynamics in
   agroforestry systems might most easily be manipulated by managing woody
   vegetation to produce organic residues of a certain quality and to
   regulate soil temperature and moisture. More attention needs to be paid
   to specific SOM pools, their importance in nutrient supply and soil
   structure, how they are affected by soil properties, and how they can be
   managed.},

Abstract = {Investigating alternative protein sources for ruminants in tropical
   regions is crucial due to distinct climatic conditions and limited
   resources. Scientists, acknowledging the challenges, are exploring
   locally accessible alternatives to develop cost-effective and
   sustainable protein supplements for ruminant nutrition, emphasizing the
   importance of understanding the nutritional composition for advancing
   livestock husbandry sustainability. The aim of this research is to
   elucidate alternative local protein sources for ruminants in tropical
   areas and assess their effectiveness in promoting sustainable production
   and enhancing ruminant nutrition. Protein feed sources are essential for
   providing amino acids to animals and producing animal products such as
   meat, milk, and wool. Inadequate protein in animal feed may have a
   detrimental impact on rumen fermentation and animal output. Therefore,
   alternative protein sources have received increased attention in order
   to replace the main protein source. The alternative protein sources in
   this review were divided into five categories: agricultural biomass,
   fodder shrubs, biological protein and plant weeds, insect protein and
   agro-industry biomass. Furthermore, plant secondary compounds found in
   alternative protein sources might be used to modulate rumen fermentation
   and improve animal performance. By focusing on regional sources of
   protein, feed costs are reduced while availability is raised. Based on
   this analysis, it can be concluded that there are a number of
   alternative protein sources that might be used in place of primary
   protein sources and that they could support ruminant production in the
   face of several animal feed crises. However, the potential use of any
   protein source should be assessed in light of the country's availability
   and animal production practices.},

Abstract = {Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 possesses a functional type three secretion
   system (TTSS), through which a number of proteins, called nodulation
   outer proteins (Nops), are delivered to the outside of the cell. A major
   constraint to the identification of Nops is their low abundance in the
   supernatants of NGR234 strains grown in culture. To overcome this
   limitation, a more sensitive proteomics-based strategy was developed.
   Secreted proteins from wild-type NGR234 were separated by
   two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and the gel was compared to similar
   gels containing the proteins from a TTSS mutant (NGROmegarhcN). To
   identify the proteins, spots unique to the NGR234 gels were analyzed by
   matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass
   spectrometry and the data were compared to the sequence of the symbiotic
   plasmid of NGR234. A nonpolar mutant of one of these proteins was
   generated called NopB. NopB is required for Nop secretion but inhibits
   the interaction with Pachyrhizus tuberosus and augments nodulation of
   Tephrosia vogelii. Flavonoids and a functional TTSS are required for the
   formation of some surface appendages on NGR234. In situ immunogold
   labeling and isolation of these pili showed that they contain NopB.},

Abstract = {Mao seed is a by-product of the wine and juice industry, which could be

   the effect of supplementation of mao (Antidesma thwaitesianum Muell.
   Arg.) seed meal (MOSM) containing condensed tannins (CT) on rumen
   fermentation, nitrogen (N) utilization and microbial protein synthesis
   in goats. Four crossbred (Thai NativexAnglo Nubian) goats with initial
   body weight (BW) 20+/-2 kg were randomly assigned to a 4x4 Latin square
   design. The four dietary treatments were MOSM supplementation at 0\%,
   0.8\%, 1.6\%, and 2.4\% of total dry matter (DM) intake, respectively.
   During the experimental periods, all goats were fed a diet containing
   roughage to concentrate ratio of 60:40 at 3.0\% BW/d and pangola grass
   hay was used as a roughage source. Results showed that supplementation
   with MOSM did not affect feed intake, nutrient intakes and apparent
   nutrient digestibility (p>0.05). In addition, ruminal pH and ammonia
   nitrogen (NH3-N) were not influenced by MOSM supplementation, whilst
   blood urea nitrogen was decreased quadraticly (p<0.05) in goats
   supplemented with MOSM at 2.4\% of total DM intake. Propionate was
   increased linearly with MOSM supplementation, whereas acetate and
   butyrate were remained the same. Moreover, estimated ruminal methane
   (CH4) was decreased linearly (p<0.05) when goats were fed with MOSM at
   1.6\% and 2.4\% of total DM intake. Numbers of bacteria and protozoa
   were similar among treatments (p>0.05). There were linear decreases in
   urinary N (p<0.01) and total N excretion (p<0.01) by MOSM
   supplementation. Furthermore, N retention was increased linearly
   (p<0.05) when goats were fed with MOSM supplementation at 1.6\% and
   2.4\% of total DM intake. Microbial protein synthesis were not
   significantly different among treatments (p>0.05). From the current
   study, it can be concluded that supplementation of MOSM at 1.6\% to
   2.4\% of total DM intake can be used to modify ruminal fermentation,
   especially propionate and N utilization in goats, without affecting the
   nutrient digestibility, microbial populations and microbial protein
   synthesis.},

Abstract = {We mapped native, endemic, and introduced (i.e., exotic) tree species
   counts, relative basal areas of functional groups, species basal areas,
   and forest biomass from forest inventory data, satellite imagery, and
   environmental data for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Imagery
   included time series of Landsat composites and Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based phenology. Environmental data
   included climate, land-cover, geology, topography, and road distances.
   Large-scale deforestation and subsequent forest regrowth are clear in
   the resulting maps decades after large-scale transition back to forest.
   Stand age, climate, geology, topography, road/urban locations, and
   protection are clearly influential. Unprotected forests on more
   accessible or arable lands are younger and have more introduced species
   and deciduous and nitrogen-fixing basal areas, fewer endemic species,
   and less biomass. Exotic species are widespread-except in the oldest,
   most remote forests on the least arable lands, where shade-tolerant
   exotics may persist. Although the maps have large uncertainty, their
   patterns of biomass, tree species diversity, and functional traits
   suggest that for a given geoclimate, forest age is a core proxy for
   forest biomass, species counts, nitrogen-fixing status, and leaf
   longevity. Geoclimate indicates hard-leaved species commonness. Until
   global wall-to-wall remote sensing data from specialized sensors are
   available, maps from multispectral image time series and other predictor
   data should help with running ecosystem models and as sustainable
   development indicators. Forest attribute models trained with a tree
   species ordination and mapped with nearest neighbor substitution
   (Phenological Gradient Nearest Neighbor method, PGNN) yielded larger
   correlation coefficients for observed vs. mapped tree species basal
   areas than Cubist regression tree models trained separately on each
   species. In contrast, Cubist regression tree models of forest structural
   and functional attributes yielded larger such correlation coefficients
   than the ordination-trained PGNN models.},

Title = {Bioeconomic evaluation of feedings strategies in the yearling beef

Year = {2021},
Volume = {247},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The application of feeding strategies (FS) to meet nutrient requirements
   of beef cattle grazing on native pastures during the dry season, are
   required to improve the productivity of production systems in tropical
   regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the bioeconomic
   effects of different FSs applied to yearling bulls in Mozambique, using
   modeling and simulations as tools to support decision making. A simple
   deterministic simulation model was developed, assuming initial body
   weight (120 kg), average daily gain (ADG), feedstuffs, and production
   costs as inputs. FSs were simulated for a total of 120 days within four
   ADG systems: 0.000 kg (S000), 0.200 kg (S200), 0.400 kg (S400), and
   0.600 kg/d (S600), and three diets were simulated for the positive and
   maintenance ADG systems, totaling 12 FS. The effects of 12 FS
   combinations were analyzed and a sensitivity analysis was performed. The
   effect of the change in the inputs of the model (feedstuffs purchase and
   calf purchase price) showed the sensitivity of the model to economic
   parameters (Gross Margin and Net Profit). The negative ADG (-0.200 kg)
   system (S-200) had the highest labor cost. Corn bran, considering its
   availability and low cost in the studied region, is a promising
   feedstuff for concentrates. Effective operational cost (EOC) was higher
   than 99\% in all FSs. S-200, S000, and FS5 within the S200 system
   resulted in negative net profit (NP) values. Net profit proportionally
   increased as ADG increased. FS12 (Hyparrhenia rufa, corn bran, and
   Sesbania sesban) of S600 promoted the highest ratio (NP/total operation
   cost) (0.48), and consequently, the highest profitability (32.37\%). In
   general, the simulation model shows that, in native and communal pasture
   beef production systems in regions of Africa with similar production
   conditions, the productivity of yearling beef cattle during the dry
   season may be improved by applying feeding strategies.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, strategies have been evaluated to reduce rumen
   methane (CH4) production by supplementing tropical forages rich in
   secondary compounds; however, most of these beneficial effects need to
   be validated in terms of their persistence over time. The aim of this
   study was to assess CH 4 emissions over time in heifers fed with and
   without Gliricidia sepium foliage (G) mixed with ground pods of
   Enterolobium cyclocarpum (E). Two groups of 4 crossbred (Bos taurus x
   Bos indicus) heifers (284 +/- 17 kg initial weight) were fed with 2
   diets (0\% and 15\% of a mixture of the pods and foliage {[}E + G:0 and
   E + G:15, respectively]) over 80 d, plus 2 wk before the experiment, in
   which every animal was fed a legume and pod-free diet. Every 14 d, CH4
   production, apparent digestibility, volatile fatty acids (VFA), and
   microbial population were quantified for each animal. The experiment was
   conducted with a repeated measurements design over time. Diets fed
   differed in terms of their crude protein (CP), condensed tannins, and
   saponins content supplied by E. cyclocarpum and G sepium. For most of
   the experiment, dry matter intake (DMI) and digestible dry-matter intake
   (DDMI) were 6.3 kg DMI/d and 512 g DDMI/kg, respectively, for both diets
   (diet: P> 0.05). Apparent digestible crude protein (DCP) was reduced by
   21 g DCP/ kg DM when the diet was supplemented with E + G:15 (P =
   0.040). Molar proportions of VFA's in the rumen did not differ between
   diets or in time (P > 0.05). Daily methane production, expressed in
   relation to DMI, was 23.95 vs. 23.32 g CH4 /kg DMI for the diet E + G:0
   and E + G:15, respectively (diet: P = 0.016; Time: P > 0.05). Percent
   gross energy loss as CH4 (Ym) with grass-only diets was above 8.1\%,
   whereas when feeding heifers with the alternate supplementation, Ym
   values of 7.59\% (P = 0.016) were observed. The relative abundance of
   total bacterial, protozoa, and methanogenic archaeal replicates was not
   affected by time nor by the incorporation of legume and pods into the
   diet (P > 0.05). Results suggest that addition of G. sepium mixed with
   E. cyclocarpum pods can reduce CH4 production in heifers and this
   response remains over time, without effect on microbial population and
   VFA concentration and a slight reduction in CPD digestibility.},

Title = {Methane Emissions and the Use of Desmanthus in Beef Cattle
   Production in Northern Australia},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary An in-depth review of Australia's tropical beef cattle
   production system is presented with emphasis on the use of Desmanthus, a
   tropical legume, as a nutritional supplementation strategy for the
   abatement and mitigation of methane emissions. It also identifies
   current knowledge gaps in in vivo methane emissions research. The
   Australian beef industry is a major contributor to the economy with an
   estimated annual revenue generation of over seven billion dollars. The
   tropical state of Queensland accounted for 48\% of Australian beef and
   veal production in 2018. As the third biggest beef exporter in the
   world, Australia supplies 3\% of the world's beef exports and its
   agricultural sector accounts for an estimated 13.2\% of its total
   greenhouse gas emissions. About 71\% of total agricultural emissions are
   in the form of methane and nitrous oxide. In this review, an overview of
   the carbon footprint of the beef cattle production system in northern
   Australia is presented, with emphasis on the mitigation of greenhouse
   gases. The review also focuses on the tropical legume, Desmanthus, one
   of the more promising nutritional supplements for methane abatement and
   improvement of animal growth performance. Among the review's findings is
   the need to select environmentally well-adapted and vigorous tropical
   legumes containing tannins that can persistently survive under the harsh
   northern Australian conditions for driving animal performance, improving
   meat quality and reducing methane emissions. The paper argues that the
   use of appropriate legumes such as Desmanthus, is a natural and
   preferred alternative to the use of chemicals for the abatement of
   methane emanating from tropical beef cattle production systems. It also
   highlights current gaps in knowledge and new research opportunities for
   in vivo studies on the impact of Desmanthus on methane emissions of
   supplemented tropical beef cattle.},

Abstract = {Increased rice production in East and Southern Africa explains the
   crucial role rice plays in household food and income security. However,
   in last three decades, rice productivity per unit area has stagnated due
   to abiotic and biotic factors, hence the need for the application of
   Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) principles. Farmyard manure,
   crop residues are central to improving soil fertility in rice systems.
   Compared to mineral fertilizer, organic manure use results in higher
   rice yield gains. Symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by grain
   legumes has been successfully applied to improve rice yields. However,
   only a few legumes are suitable for use under flooded conditions.
   Application of Azolla sp. improves rice yields though drought and the
   need for inoculum limit widespread adoption. Poor quality organic
   fertilizers limit their effectiveness as macronutrient sources. Where
   soils are P deficient, BNF and animal manure technologies seem to be of
   little value. In conclusion, combinations of mineral fertilizers,
   farmyard manure, and short seasoned legumes have the potential of
   improving rice yields. Further research on the application of ecology
   specific ISFM technologies is required in view of land degradation and
   climate variability. Research is needed on suitable legumes, fertilizer
   equivalency values of organics, fortification of organic fertilizers,
   and effectiveness of combinations of mineral and organic fertility
   inputs. We propose a step-by-step innovative approach to improving rice
   productivity by incorporating the components of ISFM at different
   stages. Decision guides essential to improved adoption and increased
   investment on rice production systems are required.},

Abstract = {Leguminous trees play a major role in alley farming or hedgerow by
   providing or recycling N and organic matter to annual crops. Little is
   known, however, about their capacity to fix N2 under field conditions
   because of methodological difficulties. This study evaluated whether the
   N-15 natural abundance (deltaN-15) method could be applied successfully
   to an alley-cropping system to estimate N2 fixation by Gliricidia sepium
   (Jacq.) Walp. The study also assessed the suitability of the
   non-nodulating legume Cassia spectabilis (L.) DC {[}syn. Senna
   spectabilis (DC.) Irwin and Barneby] as a suitable reference for
   investigations with N2-fixing trees. The hedgerow species were planted
   in double rows, 3 m long with 5-m-wide alleyways, at an acid upland site
   in the Philippines. The deltaN-15 of total N of Cassia and Gliricidia
   prunings was determined from six samplings between January 1990 (17 mo
   after establishment) and July 1991. The deltaN-15 of the total N of
   samples from nonfixing Cassia ranged from 4.47 to 7.28 parts per
   thousand with an average and standard error of 6.16 +/- 0.41 parts per
   thousand. These values were similar to those of extractable N of soil
   from different soil depths, ranging from 4.66 to 7.33\%, suggesting that
   Cassia is a suitable nonfixing reference species. The changes in
   deltaN-15 of total N of prunings were similar in both tree species;
   therefore, the observed variation was considered not to have interferred
   with estimation of N2 fixation (\%Ndfa). At four of the six sampling
   times, Gliricidia had an Ndfa close to 50\%, whereas at other two
   sampling dates the Ndfa dropped to 30 and 35\%. This study also provides
   the first quantitative data demonstrating that Cassia is a non-N2-fixing
   legume.},

Title = {Agroforestry's contribution to livelihoods and carbon sequestration in
   East Africa: A systematic review},
Journal = {TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Agroforestry is a powerful practice for sustainable and regenerative
   intensification because it promotes multifunctional landscapes that
   deliver ecological functions that contribute to livelihoods, land
   productivity, biodiversity conservation, and other ecosystem services.
   Despite a large body of literature on agroforestry in East Africa, a
   systematic understanding of its livelihood benefits and contribution to
   carbon sequestration is still lacking. A systematic review was used to
   provide a quantitative and qualitative synthesis of available evidence
   and knowledge gap from 185 publications that met the selection criteria
   regarding the contribution of agroforestry to livelihoods (n = 152) and
   carbon sequestration (n = 43) in East Africa. The main livelihood
   benefits include fodder, food, firewood and income, reported in over 70,
   63, 56 and 40 publications, respectively. These and other benefits
   diversify livelihoods of rural communities and act as safety nets in
   times of climate shocks. Agroforestry systems in East Africa stock an
   average of 24.2 +/- 2.8 Mg C ha-1 in biomass and 98.8 +/- 12.2 Mg C ha-1
   in the soil. Much of the aboveground carbon is held in homegardens (34.3
   +/- 7.9 Mg C ha-1), perennial treecrop systems (29.9 +/- 12.7 Mg C ha-1)
   and trees on boundaries (26.7 +/- 14.1 Mg C ha-1). Empirical studies are
   needed for better understanding of belowground carbon in agroforestry
   and emission of greenhouse gases in different agroforestry practices. A
   smaller number of studies reported income from sale of carbon credits,
   suggesting a gap in the development of science regarding carbon rights,
   land tenure, tree tenure rights, and the potential impact of climate
   change on the growing niches of tree species in the region. The results
   show that agroforestry is a powerful climate adaptation and mitigation
   solution as it can increase household resilience and sequesters
   significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.},

Abstract = {Several beta-proteobacteria have been isolated from legume root nodules
   and some of these are thought to be capable of nodulating and fixing
   N-2. However, in no case has there been detailed studies confirming that
   they are the active symbionts. Here, Ralstonia taiwanensis LMG19424,

   before being used to inoculate axenically-grown seedlings of M. pudica
   and M. diplotricha. Plants were harvested at various intervals for 56
   days after inoculation, then examined for evidence of infection and
   nodule formation. Nodulation of both Mimosa spp. was abundant, and
   acetylene reduction assays confirmed that nodules had nitrogenase
   activity. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that fresh M.
   pudica nodules with nitrogenase activity had infected cells containing
   bacteroids expressing gfp. In parallel, fixed and embedded nodules from
   both Mimosa spp. were sectioned for light and electron microscopy,
   followed by immunogold labeling with antibodies raised against gfp and
   nitrogenase Fe (nifH) protein. Significant immunolabeling with these
   antibodies confirmed that R. taiwanensis LMG19424 is an effective
   N-2-fixing symbiont of Mimosa spp. Both species were infected via root
   hairs and, in all respects, the nodule ontogeny and development was
   similar to that described for other mimosoid legumes. The nodules were
   indeterminate with a persistent meristem, an invasion zone containing
   host cells being invaded via prominent infection threads, and an
   N-2-fixing zone with infected cells containing membrane-bound
   symbiosomes.},

Abstract = {The mycorrhizal stimulation of trees by increasing the efficiency of
   nutrient uptake from soil is discussed with special reference to tree
   species used in agroforestry/sylvopastoral systems. The occurrence of
   the two major classes of mycorrhizas is indicated as are the soil, plant
   and fungus factors affecting the size of the response. The low intensity
   of rooting of many tree species and the prevalence of low fertility
   soils suggest large responses may be obtained frequently by inoculation
   with mycorrhizal fungi selected for high efficiency or by management to
   increase populations of indigenous fungi where these are highly
   effective but low in number. Effective mycorrhiza function may also
   ameliorate deleterious soil conditions other than nutrient deficiency
   and is important to maximize symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Inoculation of
   tree species in the nursery is logistically feasible and inoculated
   arbuscular mycorrhizal trees, when outplanted, may serve as inoculum
   sources for interrow crops. Future avenues of research are indicated.},

Title = {Medicinal Importance and Phytoconstituents of Underutilized Legumes from
   the Caesalpinioideae DC Subfamily},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Underutilized legumes are common crops in developing countries with
   superior dietary potentials that could be useful sources of protein as
   well as some phytoconstituents. They are more tolerant of abiotic
   environmental conditions like drought than the major legumes. This makes
   them more adapted to harsh soil and climatic conditions, which helps to
   minimize the pressure brought on by climate change. However, despite
   their potential, underutilized legumes have been greatly overlooked
   compared to the major legumes due to supply constraints. Underutilized
   legumes in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae are better suited for use as
   animal feeds with little or no value as food for humans, and the
   extracts and infusions of the different parts of plant species in this
   subfamily are traditionally used for the treatment of different
   diseases. In addition, underutilized legumes in this subfamily contain
   phytoconstituents that are of pharmacological relevance, some of which
   have been isolated, characterized and evaluated for use in the treatment
   of a variety of disorders. Therefore, this review describes the
   medicinal activities of some selected underutilized legumes from five
   genera in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae as well as their
   phytoconstituents, which could be exploited as lead compounds for drug
   discovery.},

Abstract = {Plants have developed several strategies to overcome the broad scope of

   including chemical defenses known as secondary metabolites, natural
   products or, more recently, specialized metabolites, i.e. chemicals

   large heterogeneous group of nitrogen-containing specialized metabolites
   with wide distribution in the Plant Kingdom, commonly found in several
   genera of Fabaceae. Various examples of toxic effects attributed to the
   NPAAs on animal, microbial and other plant cells are known and often
   related to their structural similarities to protein amino acids (PAAs).
   However, NPAAs have also been shown to play important roles in planta as
   protectant molecules against oxidative damage, besides increasing
   tolerance of different plant species to a variety of abiotic-induced
   stresses, such as drought, salinity, and temperature. In this review, we
   discuss well-established and novel functions recently unveiled for

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of supplementing oat hay (OH; milk
   stage at harvest) with 250 g (as-fed) of either lablab (Dolichos lablab,
   50\% flowering at harvest) hay or sun dried leaves of sesbania (Sesbania
   sesban) with or without 91 g dry matter (DM) of crushed maize grain on
   rumen pH and ammonia concentration (RAG), intake, degradability, rumen
   particle passage rate (k1) (in Experiment 1), digestibility, microbial N
   synthesis and live weight gain (LWG) (in Experiment 2). A randomized
   complete block design with a 2 x 2 factorial structure was used in both
   experiments. In sacco DM and N degradabilities of the feeds were also
   determined in three sheep.
   Sesbania degraded faster and to a greater extent than lablab DM. Lablab
   N was more soluble than sesbania N. Maize-free diets of sesbania and
   lablab had similar k1 but k1 was lower (P < 0.05) for lablab than for
   sesbania in the presence of maize. No other effect of forage legume by
   maize grain interaction was significant. Crushed maize grain induced
   lower (P < 0.05) pH, tended to depress the rate of OH degradation by
   23\%, depressed (P < 0.05) hay intake, increased the intake of DM (P <
   0.05) and N (P < 0.001) and the growth rate of sheep (P < 0.05) but had
   no effect on the digestibility (DM, OM, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) or
   N) and microbial N synthesis. Multiple regression analysis indicated pH
   (P < 0.03) but not RAC (P > 0.05) affected the rate of OH degradation.
   Sesbania sustained higher (P < 0.001) RAG, lower (P < 0.05) potential
   degradability of OH and higher intakes (P < 0.01; OH, DM and N), N
   digestibility (P < 0.05), N retention (P < 0.01) and microbial N
   synthesis (P < 0.07) than lablab. Sesbania and lablab diets had similar
   rates of OH degradation, digestibility (DM, OM or NDF) and LWG. It was
   concluded that sesbania promoted higher OH intake and tended to increase
   (P < 0.08) microbial N supply but had no effect on LWG. Maize grain
   tended to depress OH degradation rate but promoted faster LWG.},

Title = {Agroforestry: Essential for Sustainable and Climate-Smart Land Use?},
Booktitle = {TROPICAL FORESTRY HANDBOOK, 2ND EDITION},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {2013-2116},
Abstract = {Over the past four decades, a solid body of research has revealed the
   potential of agroforestry for increasing or maintaining system
   productivity while protecting natural resources and providing
   environmental services, including pollination, pest control/prevention,
   carbon sequestration, and the conservation of soil health, water
   quality, and biodiversity. Thus, agroforestry is well suited as a
   central tool for ``sustainable intensification{''} within a land use
   paradigm that should be based, in alignment with a recent call by FAO,
   much more on biology and agroecology, rather than on chemistry and
   fossil fuels. With success stories from around the world and new
   methodological tools for valuing also environmental services, we can now
   apply these tools to design practices and systems that match the outputs
   of sustainable crop, tree, and animal agroforestry systems to the local
   needs. To custom-tailor the systems to the respective environmental and
   socioeconomic conditions, and rise to the challenge of sustainably
   producing more food that is less contaminated and less contaminating, we
   should advance in the following directions: (i) expand the species
   characterizations, (ii) widen the scope of plants and animals used and
   include ``neglected and underutilized species{''} (NUS), (iii) intensify
   work on ``using{''} beneficial soil organisms for soil and plant health,
   (iv) optimize the system design and management to maximize resource use
   efficiency and minimize pest incidence, (v) create climate-smart and
   pest-suppressive landscapes, and, finally, (vi) advance toward more
   holistic socioeconomic assessments including an improved valuation of
   environmental services. A call is made to apply also relevant
   experiences from other fields such as biointensive or organic
   production, urban agriculture, and permaculture.},

Title = {Biofilm compartmentalisation of the rumen microbiome: modification of
   fermentation and degradation of dietary toxins},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {57},
Number = {11, SI},
Pages = {2188-2203},
Abstract = {Many deleterious chemicals in plant materials ingested by ruminants
   produce clinical effects, varying from losses of production efficiency
   through to death. Many of the effects are insidious, often going
   unrecognised by animal managers. When secondary plant compounds enter
   the rumen, they may undergo modification by rumen microbes, which often
   removes the deleterious compounds, but in specific instances, the
   deleterious effect may be enhanced. Improved understanding of rumen
   ecology, particularly concerning the biofilm mode of microbial
   fermentation, has led to major advances in our understanding of
   fermentation. In the present review, the potential impact of the
   physical structuring of the rumen microbiome is discussed in relation to
   how several economically important secondary plant compounds and other
   toxins are metabolised by the rumen microbiome and how their toxic
   effects may be remedied by providing inert particles with a large
   surface area to weight ratio in the diet. These particles provide
   additional surfaces for attachment of rumen microorganisms that help
   alleviate toxicity problems associated with deleterious compounds,
   including fluoroacetate, mimosine, mycotoxins, cyanoglycosides and
   hydrogen cyanide. The review first summarises the basic science of
   biofilm formation and describes the properties of biofilms and their
   roles in the rumen. It then addresses how biofilms on inert solids and
   fermentable particulates may assist in detoxification of potentially
   toxic compounds. A hypothesis that explains how nitrate poisoning may
   occur as a result of compartmentalisation of nitrate and nitrite
   reduction in the rumen is included.},

Title = {Allelopathy: a tool for weed management in forest restoration},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {213},
Number = {12, SI},
Pages = {1975-1989},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Forest restoration uses active management to re-establish natural forest
   habitat after disturbance. However, competition from early successional
   species, often aggressively invasive exotic plant species, can inhibit
   tree establishment and forest regeneration. Ideally, restoration
   ecologists can plant native tree species that not only establish and
   grow rapidly, but also suppress exotic competitors. Allelopathy may be a
   key mechanism by which some native trees could reduce the abundance and
   impact of exotic species. Allelopathy is a recognized tool for weed
   management in agriculture and agroforestry, but few studies have
   considered how allelopathic interactions may aid restoration. Here we
   introduce the ``Homeland Security{''} hypothesis, which posits that some
   na < ve exotic species may be particularly sensitive to allelochemicals
   produced by native species, providing a tool to reduce the growth and
   impacts of invasive exotic species on reforestation. This article
   explores how exploiting allelopathy in native species could improve
   restoration success and the re-establishment of natural successional
   dynamics. We review the evidence for allelopathy in agroforestry
   systems, and consider its relevance for reforestation. We then
   illustrate the potential for this approach with a case study of tropical
   forest restoration in Panama. C-4 grasses heavily invade deforested
   areas in the Panama Canal watershed, especially Saccharum spontaneum L.
   We measured the effect of leaf litter from 17 potential restoration tree
   species on the growth of invasive C-4 grasses. We found that leaf litter
   from legume trees had a greater inhibitory effect on performance of S.
   spontaneum than did litter from non-legume trees. However, allelopathic
   effects varied greatly among species within tree functional groups.
   Further evaluation of intra- and inter-specific interactions will help
   to improve our selection of restoration species.},

Title = {Acacia mangium Willd: benefits and threats associated with its
   increasing use around the world},
Journal = {FOREST ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Background: Acacia mangium, a fast-growing tree native to parts of
   Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia, has been cultivated outside
   its native environment and introduced into humid tropical lowland
   regions of Asia, South America and Africa over the last few decades. It
   is a multipurpose tree used in agroforestry, forestry and for
   restoration of degraded lands. It is also highly invasive in many
   regions where it has been introduced outside its native range. This
   paper reviews evidence of its obvious benefits and its negative impacts
   on biodiversity.
   Methods: A literature review on Australian acacias and especially on A.
   mangium was undertaken to highlight both benefits and threats associated
   with their increasing worldwide use outside their native ranges.
   Results: Through N-2 fixed from the atmosphere, A. mangium improves soil
   fertility, especially by increasing N status and soil C accretion when
   introduced to N-limited areas; it thus has the potential to restore
   nutrient cycling in degraded systems. No studies have, however, been
   done to assess the effectiveness of A. mangium in restoring biodiversity
   of degraded lands. Most Australian acacias have traits that facilitate
   invasiveness, and 23 species have been recorded as invasive to date. A.
   mangium has been reported as invasive in Asia, Indonesia, Pacific
   Islands, Indian Ocean Islands, southern Africa and Brazil. Research on
   other invasive Australian acacias in several parts of the world has
   elucidated the types of impacts that are likely in different types of
   ecosystems and key options for mitigating impacts.
   Conclusions: A. mangium has the potential to restore nutrient cycling in
   degraded systems, but is highly invasive wherever it is planted. Many
   parts of the world have a large invasion debt for this species.
   Experience with other invasive acacias around the world suggests a suite
   of interventions that could be used to reduce invasions and mitigate
   impacts. Careful risk assessments should be undertaken prior to any new
   plantings of this species.},

Title = {Meta-analysis of the relationship between dietary condensed tannins and
   methane emissions by cattle},
Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {298},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Using condensed tannins (CT) in ruminant nutrition yields many benefits,
   especially regarding better dietary protein utilization and decreased
   methane (CH4) emission by altering ruminal fermentation kinetics. A
   meta-analysis was conducted to develop and analyze a database from
   published studies and verify the effects of CT inclusion on enteric CH4
   emission by cattle, nutrient digestibility and ruminal parameters, and
   their interactions. The study aimed to develop regression equations
   based on the significant components and their interactions to target a
   spe-cific ruminal CH4 mitigation when correctly associating CT inclusion
   level and diet composition. A database was developed from 40 published
   studies that measured cattle CH4 emission using in vitro or in vivo
   methods and reported the source and inclusion levels of CT as well as
   typical diet characteristics, including crude protein (CP), organic
   matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and ether extract (EE).
   Other related parameters were also included in the database when
   re-ported, such as dry matter intake (DMI) and digestibility, OM
   digestibility, NDF digestibility, and ruminal parameters, including pH,
   ruminal ammonia nitrogen, total volatile fatty acids (VFA), acetate,
   propionate, butyrate, and the acetate-to-propionate ratio. The
   meta-analysis was con-ducted by multiple linear regression, using the
   nlme package of R 4.2.1, in which studies were assumed as random
   variables affecting the intercept and slopes. The CH4 emission,
   expressed in L/kg of DMI, decreased with increasing levels of dietary CT
   when in vitro and in vivo were analyzed together (P < 0.001) or in vivo
   alone (P < 0.001). Total VFA concentration (P = 0.049), propionate (P =
   0.042), and butyrate (P = 0.047) increased with increasing levels of
   dietary CT on in vitro + in vivo methods, suggesting improved
   fermentability. When analyzing all chemical components of the diet, OM
   (P = 0.043) and CP (P = 0.010) decreased CH4 production with in vitro
   methods, EE decreased CH4 production on in vivo method (P = 0.001),
   while dietary NDF increased CH4 production on in vitro + in vivo (P =
   0.016), and also separately for in vivo (P = 0.058) and in vitro method
   (P = 0.022). There was an interaction between CT and CP for in vivo
   experiments (P = 0.010): CH4 = 35.64 - 6.87 xCT - 0.49 xCP + 0.33
   xCT{*}CP. Across many experiments, increasing the level of dietary CT
   led to a decrease in ruminal CH4 concentrations for in vitro and in vivo
   fermentation conditions and an increase in molar proportions of
   propionate, butyrate, and total VFA, indicating that it is an efficient
   natural alternative to reduce environ-mental impacts of ruminant
   production systems possibly. Our meta-analysis identified diet
   components that significantly affect enteric CH4 emissions by cattle and
   developed a prediction model based on these components, including OM,
   CP, NDF, and EE. The in vivo CH4 method showed that an interaction
   between CT and CP diet content affects CH4 emissions. Future research
   and meta-analysis must focus on CT biological activity along with
   percent content to dictate ideal diet inclusion to suppress CH4
   emissions without depressing animal performance.},

Abstract = {Agroforestry can increase the sequestration of carbon (C) in soils of
   tropical agroecosystems through increased litter and tree pruning
   inputs. Decomposition of these inputs is a key process in the formation
   of soil organic matter and in nutrient cycling. Our objectives were to
   study decay of tree pruning mulch and effects on soil C and N in a
   shaded coffee agroecosystem in Hawaii. Chipped tree pruning residues
   (mulch) were added to coffee plots shaded with the Leucaena hybrid KX2
   over three years. We measured mulch decomposition and nitrogen loss over
   one year and changes in soil carbon and nitrogen (N) over two years.
   Mass loss of mulch was 80\% over one year and followed first-order decay
   dynamics. There was significant loss from all major biochemical
   components. Net N loss from the mulch was positive throughout the entire
   period. The C:N and lignin:N ratios of the mulch declined significantly
   over the decomposition period. Mulch additions significantly increased
   soil C and N in the top 20 cm by 10.8 and 2.12 Mg ha(-1), respectively.
   In the no-mulch treatment, there was no significant change in soil C or
   N concentration, but a decline in soil bulk density led to a significant
   decline in total soil C. Leucaena mulch can provide an important source
   of organic C and N to coffee agroecosystems and can help sequester C
   lost as plant biomass during shade tree management. Published by

Abstract = {The four commonly used methods for measuring biological nitrogen

   method, acetylene reduction assay (ARA) technique, xylem-solute (or
   ureide production) method and the use of N-15 labelled compounds.
   The TND method relies on a control non-N-2-fixing plant to estimate the
   amount of N absorbed by the fixing plant from soil. It is one of the
   simplest and least expensive methods, but works best under low soil N
   conditions. The ARA technique measures the rate of acetylene conversion
   to ethylene by the N-2-fixing enzyme, nitrogenase. The ethylene produced
   can then be converted into N-2 fixed, using a conversion ratio,
   originally recommended as 3. Although the method is inexpensive and
   highly sensitive, its major disadvantages are, the short-term nature of
   the assays, the doubtful validity of always using a conversion ratio of
   3 and the auto-inhibition of acetylene conversion to ethylene. The ARA
   technique is therefore not a method of choice for measuring BNF.
   The xylem-solute technique can be used to measure BNF for those species
   that produce significant quantities of ureide as product of BNF Although
   simple and relatively inexpensive, it is an instantaneous assay and also
   needs to be calibrated against a known method. The most serious
   limitation is, that only a small proportion of N-2-fixing plants
   examined are ureide exporters, and the method is therefore not widely
   applicable.
   The N-15 methods, classified into the isotope dilution and A-value
   methods, appear to be the most accurate, but also the most expensive.
   They involve labelling soil with N-15 fertilizer and using a
   non-N-2-fixing reference plant to measure the N-15/N-14 ratio in the
   soil. The N-15 isotope dilution approach is both operationally and
   mathematically simpler than the A-value approach. To limit potential
   errors in the selection of reference crops, it is recommended to use
   N-15 labelled compounds or soil labelling methods that result in the
   slow release of N-15 or the slow decline of N-15/N-14 ratio in the soil.
   Additionally, the use of several reference plants rather than a single
   one can improve the accuracy of the results.},

Abstract = {Tree legumes are an underexploited resource in warm-climate
   silvopastures. Perceived benefits of tree legumes include provisioning
   (browse/mast, timber, fuel, human food, natural medicines, and
   ornamentals), regulating (C sequestration, greenhouse gas mitigation,
   soil erosion control and riparian buffers, shade, windbreaks, and
   habitat for pollinators), supporting (biological N-2-fixation, nutrient
   cycling, soil fertility and soil health, photosynthesis, and primary
   productivity), and cultural ecosystem services. Tree legumes, however,
   have not been assessed to the same extent as herbaceous legumes. Once
   tree legumes are established, they are often more persistent than most
   herbaceous legumes. There are limitations for extended research with
   tree legume silvopastures, but extensive research has been done in
   Africa and Australia and recent efforts have been reported in South
   America. Economic benefits must be demonstrated to land managers to
   increase adoption. These benefits are apparent in the research and
   successes already available, but more long-term research, including the
   livestock component is necessary. Other factors that reduce adoption
   include paucity of domesticated germplasm, lag in research/technology,
   challenges of multipurpose trees and management complexity, challenges
   to mechanization, dangers of invasive weeds, and social and cultural
   barriers. In the current scenario of climate change and the need to
   increase food security, tree legumes are a key component for the
   sustainable intensification of livestock systems in warm-climate
   regions.},

Abstract = {We evaluated the effects of tannins from Flemingia macrophylla (CIAT
   17403) and Calliandra calothyrsus (San Ramon CIAT 22310 and Patulul CIAT
   22316) on invitro ruminal and post-ruminal dry matter and apparent
   protein degradation. For each tannin source (legumes), different dosages
   of polyethylene glycol (PEG) (8000Da) in McDougall buffer were added to
   achieve ratios of 0:3, 1:3, 2:3 and 3:3 PEG:condensed tannin (CT).
   Ruminal fluid mixed with McDougall buffer (1:4) was added to tubes
   containing only legume foliage (control) or PEG-treated legume foliage.
   For both Calliandra varieties, a higher ruminal dry matter degradation
   was observed at a PEG:CT ratio of 3:3. For F.macrophylla, no differences
   were found between 2:3 and 3:3 ratios (p>0.05), indicating that a PEG:CT
   ratio of 2:3 might be enough to bind tannins. Increasing PEG:CT ratios
   increased apparent ruminal degraded protein and ammonia concentration
   (p<0.0001) differing among species (species x ratio: p<0.0001). The
   degradation of bypass crude protein (dBCP) was influenced by both legume
   type and PEG:CT ratio (p<0.0001). For Patulul, as PEG:CT ratio
   increased, dBCP increased, but after tannin ratio of 2:3, there was not
   a significant increase, and for San Ramon, dBCP degradation was higher
   as PEG:CT ratio increased up to 2:3. For Flemingia, dBCP was higher than
   PEG:CT ratio of 0:3 but not different among 1:3, 2:3 or 3:3. Low
   concentration of CT (116mg/g DM) increased the proportion of protein
   digested in the abomasum, but higher levels of CT (252mg/g) clearly
   reduced the proportion of digested CP. For Flemingia, PEG:CT ratio of
   2:3 is enough to inactivate tannins, while PEG:CT ratio of 3:3 was
   needed for Calliandra and consequently increased ruminal degradation of
   dry mater (rdDM), and crude protein (rdCP), total degradation of dry
   matter (tdDM), crude protein (tdCP) and ammonia levels.},

   average size) was the most important structural parameter: large CT
   reduced larval feeding more than small CT. The flavan-3-ols of
   prodelphinidin (PD)-type tannins had a stronger negative influence on
   parasite activity than the stereochemistry, i.e. cis-vs
   trans-configurations, or the presence of a gallate group. In contrast,
   for C. oncophora high reductions in the motility of larvae and adult
   worms were strongly related with a higher percentage of PDs within the

   Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The environmental sustainability of beef production is a significant
   concern within the food production system. Tannins (TANs) can be used to
   minimize the environmental impact of ruminant production because they
   can improve ruminal fermentation and ruminants' lifetime performances
   and mitigate methane (CH4) emissions. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with TANs as sustainable
   natural alternative to reduce the environmental impact on growth
   performance, rumen fermentation, enteric CH4 emissions, and nitrogen (N)
   use efficiency of beef cattle through a meta-analysis. A comprehensive
   search of studies published in scientific journals that investigated the
   effects of TANs' supplementation on the variables of interest was
   performed using the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. The
   data analyzed were extracted from 32 peer-reviewed publications. The
   effects of TANs were assessed using random-effects statistical models to
   examine the standardized mean difference (SMD) between TANs' treatments
   and control (non-TANs). The heterogeneity was explored by
   meta-regression and subgroup analysis was performed for the covariates
   that were significant. TANs' supplementation did not affect weight gain,
   feed consumption, feed efficiency, or N use efficiency (p > 0.05).
   However, it reduced the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in rumen (SMD
   = -0.508, p < 0.001), CH4 emissions per day (SMD = -0.474, p < 0.01) and
   per unit dry matter intake (SMD = -0.408, p < 0.01), urinary N excretion
   (SMD = -0.338, p < 0.05), and dry matter digestibility (SMD = -0.589, p
   < 0.001). Ruminal propionate (SMD = 0.250) and butyrate (SMD = 0.198)
   concentrations and fecal N excretion (SMD = 0.860) improved in response
   to TANs' supplementation (p < 0.05). In conclusion, it is possible to
   use TANs as a CH4 mitigation strategy without affecting cattle growth
   rate. In addition, the shift from urinary to fecal N may be beneficial
   for environment preservation, as urinary N induces more harmful
   emissions than fecal N. Therefore, the addition of tannins in the diet
   of beef cattle could be used as a sustainable natural alternative to
   reduce the environmental impact of beef production.},

   Applicability of Mitigation Strategies},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. It is 80-times more effective at
   heating the earth than carbon dioxide over the first 20 years following
   release into the atmosphere. Ruminant animals have diverse microbial
   populations in their stomachs that employ anaerobic fermentation to
   digest feed. Methane is belched into the atmosphere as a by-product of
   the digestive process. This gut, or enteric methane, primarily from
   cattle, but also sheep and goats, contributes 30\% of the methane
   released into the earth's atmosphere each day, and is more than any
   other single methane source. A major reduction in methane emissions from
   ruminants is crucial to preserve ecosystems on the planet. Various
   strategies to reduce enteric methane emissions in farm operations are
   reviewed to quantify their mitigation potential, determine their impact
   on animal productivity and likelihood of adoption. Two feed supplements,
   a commercial product, 3-NOP (Bovaer(R)), and the seaweed, Asparagopsis,
   can reduce methane emissions by 40+\% and 90\%, respectively, with
   associated increases in animal productivity and no adverse effects on
   animal health or product quality. The rumen microbial population can
   also be changed to provide long-term intergenerational reduction in
   methane emissions, if treated herds remain isolated from non-treated
   animals.
   Anthropomorphic greenhouse gases are raising the temperature of the
   earth and threatening ecosystems. Since 1950 atmospheric carbon dioxide
   has increased 28\%, while methane has increased 70\%. Methane, over the
   first 20 years after release, has 80-times more warming potential as a
   greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Enteric methane from microbial
   fermentation of plant material by ruminants contributes 30\% of methane
   released into the atmosphere, which is more than any other single
   source. Numerous strategies were reviewed to quantify their methane
   mitigation potential, their impact on animal productivity and their
   likelihood of adoption. The supplements, 3-nitrooxypropanol and the
   seaweed, Asparagopsis, reduced methane emissions by 40+\% and 90\%,
   respectively, with increases in animal productivity and small effects on
   animal health or product quality. Manipulation of the rumen microbial
   population can potentially provide intergenerational reduction in
   methane emissions, if treated animals remain isolated. Genetic
   selection, vaccination, grape marc, nitrate or biochar reduced methane
   emissions by 10\% or less. Best management practices and cattle browsing
   legumes, Desmanthus or Leucaena species, result in small levels of
   methane mitigation and improved animal productivity. Feeding large
   amounts daily of ground wheat reduced methane emissions by around 35\%
   in dairy cows but was not sustained over time.},

   mechanisms and management options},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {5-34},
Abstract = {This review summarises current knowledge on root interactions in
   agroforestry systems, discussing cases from temperate and tropical
   ecosystems and drawing on experiences from natural plant communities
   where data from agroforestry systems are lacking. There is an inherent
   conflict in agroforestry between expected favourable effects of tree
   root systems, e.g. on soil fertility and nutrient cycling, and
   competition between tree and crop roots. Root management attempts to
   optimise root functions and to stimulate facilitative and complementary
   interactions. It makes use of the plasticity of root systems to respond
   to environmental factors, including other root systems, with altered
   growth and physiology. Root management tools include species selection,
   spacing, nutrient distribution, and shoot pruning, among others. Root
   distribution determines potential zones of root interactions in the
   soil, but are also a result of such interactions. Plants tend to avoid
   excessive root competition both at the root system level and at the
   single-root level by spatial segregation. As a consequence, associated
   plant species develop vertically stratified root systems under certain
   conditions, leading to complementarity in the use of soil resources.
   Parameters of root competitiveness, such as root length density,
   mycorrhization and flexibility in response to water and nutrient patches
   in the soil, have to be considered for predicting the outcome of
   interspecific root interactions. The patterns of root activity around
   individual plants differ between species; knowing these may help to
   avoid excessive competition and unproductive nutrient losses in
   agroforestry systems through suitable spacing and fertiliser placement.
   The possibility of alleviating root competition by supplying limiting
   growth factors is critically assessed. A wide range of physical,
   chemical and biological interactions occurs not only in spatial
   agroforestry, but also in rotational systems. In a final part, the
   reviewed information is applied to different types of agroforestry
   systems: associations of trees with annual crops; associations of trees
   with grasses or perennial fodder and cover crops; associations of
   different tree and shrub species; and improved fallows.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis of data containing 127 different dietary
   treatments with 593 goats from 30 published studies was performed to
   explain the effects of foliage supplementation to low-quality roughages
   on intake, digestibility and N utilisation in goats.
   RESULTS: Basal dry matter (DM) intake decreased linearly with increasing
   foliage level (FL) in diets and foliage crude protein (CP) intake,
   whereas total DM intake increased linearly with increasing FL and CP
   intake from foliages and quadratically with increasing concentration of
   neutral detergent fibre (NDF) in foliages. The digestibility of DM and
   CP increased linearly with increasing FL and CP concentration in basal
   roughages and foliage CP intake. The greater concentration of NDF in
   foliages and roughages decreased CP digestibility linearly. Intakes of
   digestible DM and CP increased quadratically with increasing FL, with
   plateau levels of 36.4 and 5.52 g kg(-1) (body weight)(0.75) in response
   to 490 and 740 g kg(-1) FL respectively. Faecal N, urinary N and N
   retention increased linearly with increasing FL and foliage CP intake.
   CONCLUSION: Responses of goats fed basal roughages supplemented with
   foliages are influenced by the quality and quantity of foliages and
   quality of roughages. Up to 490 g kg(-1) FL can be incorporated in diets
   for better feed utilisation and animal performance, beyond which
   nutrient utilisation may be adversely affected. (C) 2009 Society of

Abstract = {In the last 35 years, the population of sub-Saharan Africa has increased
   nearly threefold and is expected to reach 681 million by the year 2000,
   with nearly 50\% of the population living in urban centres. Such
   population pressures, exacerbated by a range of social and political
   factors, have already resulted in widespread land degradation in areas
   of high population densities and the expansion of agriculture on to
   marginal and sloping land. Declining soil fertility and soil erosion are
   increasingly threatening the sustainability of small scale farming
   systems throughout Africa, and affordable external nutrient inputs are
   seldom available to farmers. In addition, shortages of wood for
   construction and fuel and high-quality dry-season fodder for livestock
   are widespread and serious constraints to farm productivity.
   Agroforestry, the deliberate integration of woody perennials into crop
   and livestock systems, has the potential to mitigate many of these
   constraints through both the service and production functions played by
   trees. In recent decades much agroforestry research has been undertaken
   in sub-Saharan Africa. In this review we focus specifically on research
   which addresses the potential of agroforestry systems to enhance soil
   fertility, prevent soil erosion, provide high-quality dry-season fodder
   or generate much needed income through the production of high-value
   goods.
   Much emphasis has been placed on a wide range of agroforestry systems
   for the maintenance of soil fertility and the prevention of soil erosion
   losses, and encouraging results, both in technical performance and
   farmer enthusiasm, have occurred. However, it is clear that agroforestry
   solutions to land degradation are always likely to be location-specific
   in their relevance, performance and farmer acceptability. It is
   essential chat farmers are included as research partners to determine
   what is appropriate for their conditions.
   Good progress has also been made on identifying fast-growing leguminous
   trees and shrubs for high-quality livestock fodder supplements. Where
   livestock enterprises, such as peri-urban milk production, are
   market-oriented the adoption and impact of such systems have been high.
   Given population and urbanization projections, it is likely that fodder
   trees and shrubs will have a major role to play in meeting future feed
   demands for both milk and meat production. Research on the potential of
   high-value indigenous and exotic trees to generate income has been less
   extensive in Africa, although the huge potential of this approach has
   been clearly demonstrated by Farmers in south-east Asia. We suggest that
   there is a need for increased research emphasis on the domestication of
   high value indigenous trees, and their integration into more
   sustainable, diverse and intensive land use systems.
   We conclude that, although good progress has been made in agroforestry
   research in Africa and farmer adoption is occurring, future population
   projections pose a clear challenge. Agroforestry systems which provide
   solutions for today's land degradation problems will need to evolve in
   both diversity and intensity if they are to remain relevant and
   effective for tomorrow's Africa.},

Abstract = {Sixteen Suffolk lambs with 29 +/- 2.0 kg body weight were housed in
   individual cages for 60 days and allotted to four treatments in a
   completely randomized design to determine the effect of administration
   of Salix babylonica (SB) extract and/or exogenous enzymes (ZADO (R)) on
   lamb performance. Lambs were fed with 300 g/kg concentrate (160 g crude
   protein (CP)/kg, 13.4 MJ metabolizable energy (ME)/kg dry matter (DM))
   and 700 g/kg maize silage (80 g/kg CP, 11.7 MJ ME/kg DM) as a basal diet
   (control). Another three treatments were tested; the SB extract was
   administered at 30 ml/day (SB) and exogenous enzymes ZADO (R) (i.e. an
   exogenous enzyme cocktail in a powder form) directly fed at 10 g/day
   (EZ), while the last treatment contained ZADO (R) at 10 g/day + SB
   extract at 30 ml/day (EZSB). Lambs of the treatment EZSB had the
   greatest average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed conversion throughout
   the period of the experiment. However, during the first 30 days SB was
   more effective for ADG than EZ and vice versa during the last 30 days of
   the experiment. Water consumption was greater for SB, followed by EZ and
   EZSB compared to the control. Intakes of DMand organicmatter (OM) were
   the highest in EZSB followed by EZ, which had the greatest neutral
   detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre (ADF) and nitrogen (N) intakes.
   The EZSB treatment had the greatest DM and OM digestibilities compared
   to the other treatments; however, SB had the greatest ADF digestibility.
   Combination of EZ and SB had the best N balance. Allantoin, total purine
   derivatives (PD), allantoin : -creatinine ratio, and PD: creatinine
   ratio were increased in EZSB compared to the other treatments. However,
   EZ supplementation increased uric acid concentration, whereas the
   microbial N (g N/day) and metabolizable protein (g N/day) were increased
   in EZSB versus the other treatments. It can be concluded that addition
   of 10 g ZADO (R) in combination with S. babylonica extract at 30 ml/day
   in the diet of lambs increased feed intake, nutrient digestibility and
   daily gain, with a positive impact on the use of N and microbial protein
   synthesis.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate how the consumption of purple neem
   foliage rich in anthocyanins improves rumen fermentation, growth
   performance and plasma antioxidant activity in growing goats. In total,
   25 Anglo-Nubian Thai native male goats (about 20 +/- 2 kg body weight;
   mean standard deviation (SD)) were assigned to 2 x 2 + 1 factorial in a
   completely randomized study design. There were five treatments: (1)
   control, (2) 3\% normal neem foliage in concentrate, (3) 6\% normal neem
   foliage in concentrate, (4) 3\% purple neem foliage in concentrate and
   (5) 6\% purple neem foliage in concentrate. The results show that the
   goats that were fed 6\% purple neem foliage in concentrate had a higher
   (p < 0.01) feed intake gDM/d, \%BW, g/kgBW(0.75), nutrient intake,
   nutrient digestion, final weight, weight change and ADG than did the
   goats that were fed 3\% purple neem foliage in concentrate, 3\% normal
   neem foliage in concentrate, 6\% normal neem foliage in concentrate and
   control treatment. The feeding of 6\% purple neem foliage in concentrate
   had higher (p < 0.01) N intake, N urine, N digestion, N digestion (\%),
   N retention and N retention (\%) than the other treatments. The goats
   receiving 6\% purple neem foliage in concentrate had no negative effect
   (p < 0.01) on pH but had a higher (p < 0.01) level of ammonia nitrogen,
   BUN, acetic acid, propionic acid, ratio of acetic acid to propionic acid
   and total VFA at 2 and 4 h after feeding compared to the other
   treatments. The effect of anthocyanin-rich 6\% purple neem foliage was
   shown to be higher than the other treatments (p < 0.01) for total
   bacteria, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes,
   Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Streptococcus bovis at
   2 and 4 h after feeding. The goats fed 6\% purple neem foliage displayed
   higher (p < 0.01) levels of total antioxidant (TAC), superoxide
   dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX),
   2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and catalase (CAT) antioxidant
   activity in plasma at 2 and 4 h after feeding. The goats fed 6\% purple
   neem foliage had lower (p < 0.01) protozoa methanogen and
   malondialdehyde (MDA) at 2 and 4 h after feeding. In developing growing
   goats, the introduction of anthocyanin-rich purple neem foliage boosted
   plasma antioxidant capacity, improved rumen volatile fatty acids and
   caused a shift in the structure and relative abundance of the ruminal
   microbial community.},

   A Review},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Soil and water loss is a severe environmental problem in tropical and
   subtropical Asia (TSA). This review systematically summarizes the
   techniques that have been widely applied in the TSA region and compares
   the conservation efficiency of these techniques based on the runoff and
   sediment reduction ratios (eta(r) and eta(s)). The results show that the
   current techniques can be divided into biological, engineering and
   agricultural practice measures, and in most cases, their efficiencies in
   reducing sediment loss (eta(s) = 14.0-99.5\%, 61.3-100.0\% and
   0.6-95.4\%, respectively) were higher than in reducing runoff loss
   (eta(r) = 2.8-9.38\%, 0.28-83.3\% and 1.62-70.2\%, respectively).
   Monocultures of single tree species (e.g., Pinus massoniana) sometimes
   showed very limited conservation effects. Vetiver and alfalfa were more
   effective at reducing soil loss than other hedgerow species. Contour
   tillage, ridge farming, and reduced tillage generally showed high
   efficiencies in reducing soil loss compared with other agricultural
   practice measures. The combination of engineering and biological
   techniques could more effectively reduce soil and water loss compared
   with the application of these techniques along. Future works should be
   conducted to build unified technical standards and reasonable
   comprehensive evaluation systems, to combine these techniques with
   environmental engineering technologies, and to develop new amendment
   materials.},

Note = {8th International Conference on Goats, Pretoria, SOUTH AFRICA, JUL

Abstract = {This paper analyses the progress in recent research in goat nutrition
   since the last International Conference on Goats (Tours, 2000). This
   review reveals clear progress in the quality of papers, now similar to
   those on cattle or sheep, particularly on nutritional aspects in
   tropical areas. Topics dealt with in goat nutrition are feeding
   behaviour, particularly on pastures or rangelands, feed digestibility,
   tree leaf or by-product utilization, effects of nutritional factors on
   growth, milk and hair production, while nutritional adaptation to harsh
   environments, underfeeding, factors influencing energy consumption,
   quality of goat products (milk, cheese, meat) and reproduction
   performance along with the connection between nutrition and pathology
   require more attention. Goat nutrition in a tropical environment follows
   the same physiological mechanisms as under temperate conditions, but
   genotypes can present specificities enabling a better adaptation to
   feeding conditions. Complete and precise information on the nutritive
   value of tropical forage, rangeland vegetation in accordance with the
   season, and new feed or by-products is still missing. Researchers in
   goat nutrition frequently use different methods, making it difficult to
   compare results from several research teams. Agreement on the
   methodology in goat nutrition is easier when the research teams are
   organized in networks at the national or international level. To be
   successful with technological transfer in goat nutrition, the message
   for the end users must be clear and well adapted. At the present time,
   we are short of review papers that provide an analysis of all results
   already published to establish quantitative relationships between
   variables, which can clarify the messages for the field. Methods of
   meta-analysis can be used to analyse the quantitative results from
   experimental data banks and to establish response laws and define limits
   of application. Finally, if we implement a research project on goat
   nutrition dedicated to application in the field, not only the research
   works but also the actions of technological transfer must be financed.

Title = {Role of Secondary Plant Metabolites on Enteric Methane Mitigation in
   Ruminants},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {The rumen microbiome plays a fundamental role in all ruminant species,
   it is involved in health, nutrient utilization, detoxification, and
   methane emissions. Methane is a greenhouse gas which is eructated in
   large volumes by ruminants grazing extensive grasslands in the tropical
   regions of the world. Enteric methane is the largest contributor to the
   emissions of greenhouse gases originating from animal agriculture. A
   large variety of plants containing secondary metabolites {[}essential
   oils (terpenoids), tannins, saponins, and flavonoids] have been
   evaluated as cattle feedstuffs and changes in volatile fatty acid
   proportions and methane synthesis in the rumen have been assessed.
   Alterations to the rumen microbiome may lead to changes in diversity,
   composition, and structure of the methanogen community. Legumes
   containing condensed tannins such asLeucaena leucocephalahave shown a
   good methane mitigating effect when fed at levels of up to 30-35\% of
   ration dry matter in cattle as a result of the effect of condensed
   tannins on rumen bacteria and methanogens. It has been shown that
   saponins disrupt the membrane of rumen protozoa, thus decreasing the
   numbers of both protozoa and methanogenic archaea. Trials carried out
   with cattle housed in respiration chambers have demonstrated the enteric
   methane mitigation effect in cattle and sheep of tropical legumes such
   asEnterolobium cyclocarpumandSamanea samanwhich contain saponins.
   Essential oils are volatile constituents of terpenoid or non-terpenoid
   origin which impair energy metabolism of archaea and have shown
   reductions of up to 26\% in enteric methane emissions in ruminants.
   There is emerging evidence showing the potential of flavonoids as
   methane mitigating compounds, but more work is requiredin vivoto confirm
   preliminary findings. From the information hereby presented, it is clear
   that plant secondary metabolites can be a rational approach to modulate
   the rumen microbiome and modify its function, some species of rumen
   microbes improve protein and fiber degradation and reduce feed energy
   loss as methane in ruminants fed tropical plant species.},

Title = {What role can planted fallows play in the humid and sub-humid zone of
   West and Central Africa?},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Crop management without fertilizer input, which is commonly practiced by
   most farmers in the humid forest zone of West and Central Africa,
   requires soil fertility replenishment during a fallow period.
   Hypothetical relationships between fallow length and crop yields assume,
   that after the cropping phase replenishment starts with high annual
   increments, leading to an early recovery of most soil fertility, then
   slowly approaching a maximum level. The few available empirical data,
   however, indicate that this assumption is wrong. Within the first 8
   years of fallow, biomass and nutrient accumulation is either progressive
   (low initial increments) or linear. Planted fallows are supposed to
   replenish soil fertility faster or to higher levels than natural
   regrowth and should thus lead to higher crop yields. Two major types of
   planted fallow are distinguished: tree-based and herbaceous fallows.
   Data from West and Central Africa do not confirm that tree based fallows
   are generally capable of attaining higher crop yields than natural
   regrowth or other planted fallows. The majority of experiments with
   tree-based fallows showed no differences to the control (60.0\%). Crop
   yield declines were found in 15.7\% of cases, and only 24.3\% resulted
   in significant yield increases. Changes in soil properties were more
   frequently positive (34.3\%) than negative (9.8\%), yet, most often
   (55.9\%), there was no effect. Herbaceous fallow had dominantly positive
   effects on crop yields (52.5\% of cases), with only 3\% of cases in
   which significant reductions were observed. Positive features of some
   herbaceous fallows, such as easy establishment, rapid weed suppression,
   and labor efficient slash-and-burn crop establishment make the
   technology more likely to be accepted and adopted by farmers. It appears
   that fallows have to be specifically designed for responsive crops, i.e.
   maize. It is unlikely that one type of fallow can serve the multitude of
   crops and intercrops grown in the region. Depending on the major
   constraints to crop production or income generation, planted fallows
   have to be specifically designed to address these constraints. This may
   require de-emphasizing the soil fertility aspect and focusing on
   marketable fallow by-products, weed and pest suppression and reduced
   labor requirements. Thus, future impact through research on planted
   fallows will depend on exact targeting of specific fallow types and
   species to the most responsive crops and to explicit farmer
   circumstances.},

Abstract = {Legume leaves used as green manure are a potential alternative to the
   use of commercial N fertilizers for non-legume crop production. Thus it
   is important to understand the rate of legume leaf decomposition and its
   release of nutrients. This paper reports the results of a litter bag
   experiment using fresh Gliricidia sepium leaves under field conditions.
   The leaves were confined in litterbags (5.3 mm mesh) and buried 10 cm in
   the soil. Dry matter, C, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg remaining after
   decomposition was determined at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70
   days. A rapid initial phase followed by a much slower one was identified
   in the decay and nutrient release patterns. The duration of the former
   ranged from 21 to nearly 30 days for dry matter and nutrients. Potassium
   and Ca were the most rapidly released nutrients, with the early phase
   lasting 28 and 6 days respectively. Nitrogen and P showed similar
   patterns of release and initial phase duration (21 and 22 days). Their
   rate constants were also 10 and 8 times that of their respective slow
   phases. C:N and C:P ratios increased initially and then decreased in the
   subsequent phase of decomposition. Magnesium also gave an identical
   pattern and rate of release as N in the early phase. No influence of
   rainfall was observed on the parameters studied.},

Abstract = {To understand the genetic mechanism of host specificity in the
   interaction between rhizobia and their hosts, it is important to
   identify genes that influence both early and late steps in symbiotic
   development. This paper focuses on the little-understood genetics of
   host-specific nitrogen fixation. A deletion mutant of Bradyrhizobium
   japonicum, strain NAD163, was found to induce effective, nitrogen-fixing
   nodules on soybean and siratro plants but produced ineffective nodules
   on cowpea plants. Additional transposon and deletion mutants defined a
   small region that conferred this phenotype, and this region was
   sequenced to identify two putative open reading frames (ORFs). Data
   indicate that only one of these ORFs is detectable in bacteroids. This
   ORF was termed hsfA, with a predicted protein product of 11 kDa. The
   transcriptional start site of hsfA was determined and found to coincide
   with a predicted RpoN-dependent promoter. Microscopic studies of nodules
   induced by the wild type and hsfA mutants on cowpea and soybean plants
   indicate that the cowpea mutant nodules are slow to develop. The data
   indicate that hsfA appears to play a crucial role in bacteroid
   development on cowpea but does not appear to be essential for nitrogen
   fixation on the other hosts tested.},

Abstract = {Current production from natural forests will not satisfy future world
   demand for timber and fuel wood, and new land management options are
   required.
   We explore an innovative production system that combines the production
   of short rotation coppice in wide alleys with the production of
   high-value trees on narrow strips of land; it is an alternative form of
   alley cropping which we propose to call `alley coppice'. The aim is to
   describe this alley coppice system and to illustrate its potential for
   producing two diverse products, namely high-value timber and energy wood
   on the same land unit.
   Based on a comprehensive literature review, we compare the advantages
   and disadvantages of the alley coppice system and contrast the features
   with well-known existing or past systems of biomass and wood production.
   We describe and discuss the basic aspects of alley coppice, its design
   and dynamics, the processes of competition and facilitation, issues of
   ecology, and areas that are open for future research.
   Based on existing knowledge, a solid foundation for the implementation
   of alley coppice on suitable land is presented, and the high potential
   of this system could be shown.},

Abstract = {Acacia karroo is one of the most widespread and abundant indigenous tree
   legume species in Southern Africa. The tree possesses positive
   attributes such as high growth rates, drought tolerance, adaptation to
   acidic infertile soils and resistance to large temperature variations.
   In the recent past, A. karroo was deemed to be a severe encroacher,
   which adversely affected land utilisation and rangeland productivity.
   Research attention has been diverted from its riddance as a weed to its
   utilisation as an animal feed. Widespread adoption of feeding strategies
   based on A. karroo was mainly impeded by the presence of thorns and
   tannins. Opportunities to minimise the adverse effects of these
   anti-quality factors are now well documented. A. karroo leaves have
   desirable fatty acid profiles, high N and mineral concentrations. At
   present, utilisation of A. karroo for beef production on rangelands is
   restricted by limited evidence regarding its feeding value. The current
   paper, therefore, demonstrates the potential of A. karroo to reduce worm
   burdens, and improve growth rates, carcass traits, beef quality and
   fatty acid profiles of cattle on rangeland. Economics of feeding A.
   karroo, strategies for incorporating it into feeding regimes for beef
   cattle and its relevance to sustainable livelihoods in low input
   production systems are outlined. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Coffee (Cofea arabica) production provides a source of income for
   small-scale farmers in Chiapas, Mexico. Organic production regulations
   prohibit the use of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers, therefore
   farmers are dependent upon N-sources accepted by organic certification
   agencies. In the state of Chiapas, little is known about effectiveness
   of rhizobia and nodule development, location and structure of the common
   coffee shade tree genus Inga. The objectives of this study were to (1)
   evaluate the symbiotic effectiveness of selected rhizobia isolates as
   inoculants for Inga oerstediana under greenhouse and field conditions,
   (2) describe the morphological and histochemical characteristics of I.
   oerstediana root nodules, and (3) apply the N-15 natural abundance
   technique to investigate nitrogen fixation in two stands of I.
   oerstediana of different ages intercropped with C. arabica. To meet
   objectives one and two, we assessed shoot biomass, nodule number, nodule
   mass and total shoot N of inoculated I. oerstediana seedlings at 90 and
   150 days after planting (DAP) in the greenhouse and field. Light
   microscopy, and in situ hybridization of nodule sections for
   leghemoglobin and Nif H cDNA determination were used to describe nodule
   morphology and histology. Results indicated that tested isolates appear
   not to be fixing NZ 150 DAP and inoculation with isolated bacteria, and
   that inoculated treatment nodules lacked leghemoglobin and Nif H mRNA
   transcript, however contained infected bacteroids. An unidentified
   brown-pigmented granular substance was present in all nodules examined.
   I. oerstediana appears slow to nodulate, with negligible nodulation at
   90 DAP, and limited nodulation at 150 DAP. Using the natural abundance
   method to meet objective three, recycling of fixed N in older 5-7 year
   plots is thought to have caused great N-15 value variation in both
   reference and leguminous trees and data could not be used to estimate \%
   N derived from Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF). I. oerstediana found
   in younger 1-3 year old plots was found to derive 20\% of its N from
   BNF. As fixation appears to be low in young Inga, recommendations for
   organic C. arabica shade tree management include supplementation of N
   during early growth of Inga-C. arabica intercrop, and longer-term
   nodulation studies combined with additional N-2-fixation assessment
   using N-15 natural abundance methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {217-231},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Forests with nitrogen-fixing trees (N-fixers) typically accumulate more
   carbon (C) in soils than similar forests without N-fixing trees. This
   difference may develop from fundamentally different processes, with
   either greater accumulation of recently fixed C or reduced decomposition
   of older soil C. We compared the Soil C Pools under N-Fixers with
   Eucalyptus (non-N-fixers) at four tropical sites: two sites on Andisol
   soils in Hawaii and two sites on Vertisol and Entisol soils in Puerto
   Rico. Using stable carbon isotope techniques, we tracked the loss of the
   old soil organic C from the previous C-4 land use (SOC4) and the gain of
   ne v soil organic C from the C-3, N-fixer, and non-N-fixer plantations
   (SOC3). Soils beneath N-fixing trees sequestered 0.11 +/- 0.07 kg m(-2)
   y(-1) (mean +/- one standard error) of total soil organic carbon (SOCT)
   compared with no change under Eucalyptus (0.00 +/- 0.07 kg m(-2) y(-1);
   P = 0.02). About 55\% of the greater SOCT Sequestration under the
   N-fixers resulted from greater retention of old SOC4 and 45\% resulted
   from greater accretion of new SOC3. Soil N accretion under the N-fixers
   explained 62\% of the variability of the greater retention of old SOC4
   under the N-fixers. The greater retention of older soil C tinder
   N-fixing trees is a novel finding and may be important for strategies
   that use reforestation or afforestation to offset C emissions.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Purple Neem foliage has been mostly found in Thailand.
   This plant contains anthocyanins, which may be useful to ruminants.
   Therefore, as a result, the purpose of this research was to evaluate the
   effect Purple Neem foliage as a feed supplement on nutrient apparent
   digestibility, nitrogen utilization, rumen fermentation, microbial
   population, plasma antioxidants and meat quality in goats. We observed
   that giving Purple Neem foliage to goats improved feed intake, nutrient
   digestion, nitrogen utilization, growth performance, rumen fermentation,
   microbial population, plasma antioxidant, meat quality and fatty acid
   profile in meat goat by increasing polyunsaturated fatty acid and
   antioxidant gene expression in meat goat by improve
   glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), glutathione peroxidase
   (GPX), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). As a results,
   Purple Neem foliage as a ruminant feed supplementation may become a
   viable alternative feed addition in the future. The purpose of this
   experiment was to investigate the effect of Purple Neem foliage as a
   feed supplement on nutrient apparent digestibility, nitrogen
   utilization, rumen fermentation, microbial population, plasma
   antioxidants, meat quality and fatty acid profile of goats. Eighteen
   Boer male goats (approximately 20 +/- 2 kg body weight; mean +/-
   standard deviation (SD)) were randomly allocated into three treatments.
   All goats were fed a 60 d daily feeding with three treatments: (1)
   control, (2) 3\% Purple Neem foliage (PNF) + 3\% sunflower oil (SFO) in
   concentrate, and (3) 6\% Purple Neem foliage (PNF) + 3\% sunflower oil
   (SFO) in concentrate. The findings indicate that goat feed containing
   6\% PNF + 3\% SFO in concentrate increased feed consumption, nutrient
   intake, nutrient apparent digestibility and nitrogen utilization
   compared to the goat feed at 3\% PNF + 3\% SFO and the control group.
   The feeding of goats with 6\% PNF + 3\% SFO in concentrate resulted in
   high ammonia nitrogen, BUN, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid,
   and the total VFA levels were increased at 2 and 4 h after feeding (p <
   0.01). The individual microbial population with 6\% PNF + 3\% SFO had
   higher (p < 0.01) total bacteria, higher Butyrivibrio fibrisolven,
   Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefacises,
   and Streptococcus bovis, decreased protozoa and methanogen levels at 2
   and 4 h after feeding. The antioxidant in plasma indices varied, with
   6\% PNF + 3\% SFO having higher total antioxidant (TAC), superoxide
   dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), 2,
   2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and catalase (CAT) antioxidant
   activity and lower malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma at 2 and 4 h after
   feeding. Additionally, goat fed 6\% PNF + 3\% SFO can improve meat
   quality by lowering drip loss, cooking loss, shear force, and saturated
   fatty acid as well as increase the fatty acid profile (monounsaturated
   and polyunsaturated fatty acids) in goat meat. Our findings suggest that
   Purple Neem foliage might be an excellent alternative additive for goat
   feed.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Here we report that the structure of the Sinorhizobium fredii HH103
   exopolysaccharide (EPS) is composed of glucose, galactose, glucuronic
   acid, pyruvic acid, in the ratios 5:2:2:1 and is partially acetylated. A
   S. fredii HH103 exoA mutant (SVQ530), unable to produce EPS, not only
   forms nitrogen fixing nodules with soybean but also shows increased
   competitive capacity for nodule occupancy. Mutant SVQ530 is, however,
   less competitive to nodulate Vigna unguiculata. Biofilm formation was
   reduced in mutant SVQ530 but increased in an EPS overproducing mutant.
   Mutant SVQ530 was impaired in surface motility and showed higher
   osmosensitivity compared to its wild type strain in media containing 50
   mM NaCl or 5\% (w/v) sucrose. Neither S. fredii HH103 nor 41 other S.
   fredii strains were recognized by soybean lectin (SBL). S. fredii HH103
   mutants affected in exopolysaccharides (EPS), lipopolysaccharides (LPS),
   cyclic glucans (CG) or capsular polysaccharides (KPS) were not
   significantly impaired in their soybean-root attachment capacity,
   suggesting that these surface polysaccharides might not be relevant in
   early attachment to soybean roots. These results also indicate that the
   molecular mechanisms involved in S. fredii attachment to soybean roots
   might be different to those operating in Bradyrhizobium japonicum.},

Abstract = {A feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of inclusion of
   Sesbania leaf meal in the diet of Cyprinus carpio as a replacer of
   de-oiled rice bran (DORB). Bacillus subtilis was used to ferment the
   Sesbania leaf meal (SLM) to produce FSLM (fermented sesbania leaf meal).
   Fishes were fed with five isonitrogenous (30\% CP) and isocaloric diets
   for 60 days and treatments were viz., C (30\% DORB, 0\% SLM), R15 (15\%
   DORB, 15\% SLM), R30 (0\% DORB, 30\% SLM), F15 (15\% DORB, 15\%FSLM) and
   F30 (0\% DORB, 30\% FSLM) by replacing DORB with SLM. A similar growth
   performance with control was observed in 15\% FSLM group while there was
   a growth reduction in all the raw leaf meal fed groups. Similarly, the
   expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was significantly (p
   < .05) higher in control and 15\% FSLM fed groups. Growth and metabolic
   enzymes such as protease, amylase, ALT and AST activities were
   significantly higher in the fermented leaf meal fed groups compared to
   their non-fermented counterparts. Antioxidant enzymes, serum
   transaminase enzymes (SGOT, SGPT) and total bilirubin (TBR) were found
   to be increased by enhanced level of RSLM, however, reduced by inclusion
   of FSLM. However, 30\% inclusion level of FSLM even after fermentation
   showed detrimental effect on growth and metabolic response at cellular
   and molecular level. Thus, the results concluded that fermented Sesbania
   leaf meal (FSLM) using B. subtilis could replace 50\% DORB (15\% FSLM
   group) in the diet of C. carpio without affecting the growth and other
   physiological responses.},

   purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of biological additives
   on nutrient profiles, silage quality, in vitro rumen fermentation in
   different varieties of rice straw silage; ML4, ML10, ML21, ML24, MR219
   and Putra-1 were ensiled with water (control), enzyme (E) and a
   combination of bacteria and enzyme (BE) in a complete randomised design
   (CRD) experiment. Methodology. The rice straw varieties, obtained from
   the paddy research farm were chopped to similar to 2-3 cm, treated
   according to the above treatments to attain 70\% moisture content and
   compressed in a 1 L jar and ensiled for 30 days. Key results. Crude
   protein (CP) in the treated rice straw silage was higher than in the
   control. The treatment with BE had a lower neutral detergent fibre
   (42.31\%) and a lower acid detergent fibre (21.08\%) concentration for
   Putra-1 than did other treatments (E and control) and varieties. For the
   silage extract, the lowest pH, NH3, butyric acid and propionic acid were
   obtained in the BE treatment in most of the rice straw varieties. In
   addition, straw treated with BE had the highest lactic acid content, in
   vitro gas production kinetics, digestibility, and rumen fermentation,
   compared with the E and control treatments. Conclusion. This study
   showed that a BE treatment effectively improved the quality of rice
   straw silage, with the Putra-1 variety giving the most outstanding
   result.},

Abstract = {Extensive grazing is common on low phosphorus (P) soils in tropical
   areas. In this study we aimed to use experience and research results
   from northern Australia to investigate methods to manage low P status to
   efficiently raise animals without exploiting soil P resources.
   Simple ``farm-gate{''} P balances were calculated for four cattle
   breeding and growing operations. Estimated P balances were slightly
   negative (outputs > inputs) for extensive breeding operations (0.02 to
   0.04 kg/ha/year depending on P supplementation), slightly positive for a
   system growing young animals with small annual P fertilizer
   applications, and negative for a mixed grazing-cropping enterprise. In
   northern tablelands pastoral environments, responses to P application
   have remained unchanged over the last 50 years, with > 80\% of paddocks
   remaining P limited. Liveweight gain responses to P fertilizer in most
   experiments have been < 4 kg LWG/kg P applied as fertilizer.
   Little or no P fertilizer is used in most grazing systems. Supplying P
   directly to animals as a feed supplement can economically improve animal
   performance and contribute to an improvement in the P balances of
   grazing systems. Guidelines for supplement use have been devised.
   Further research is required to determine the best application
   strategies to overcome P deficits, and the best farming systems to
   minimise P requirements.},

Title = {Trees on farms to support natural capital: An evidence-based review for
   grazed dairy systems},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {704},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Intensification of the dairy industry globally, combined with a changing
   climate, has placed increased pressure on natural capital assets (and
   the flow of ecosystem services) on farms. Agroforestry is widely
   promoted as an intervention to address these issues. While some benefits
   of integrating trees on farms, such as carbon sequestration and
   biodiversity, are reasonably well known, less is known about other
   potential benefits, such as on-farm production. Understanding and
   quantifying these benefits would inform farm planning and
   decision-making. We used a systematic review approach to analyse the
   evidence base for biophysical ecosystem services from woody systems
   (including shelterbelts, riparian plantings, plantations, pasture trees,
   silvopasture and remnant native vegetation) provided to grazed dairy
   enterprises. We identified 83 publications containing 123 records that
   fit our review criteria of reporting on biophysical ecosystem services
   from woody systems on dairy farms relative to a grazed pasture
   comparison. For each relationship between a woody system and ecosystem
   service, we assessed the level of support, strength and predominant
   direction of evidence, and summarised the causal relationships (woody
   system >> mechanism >> outcome). Shelterbelts and riparian plantings
   were the most commonly reported woody systems. Linkages between woody
   systems and ecosystem services were largely positive, with the types of
   services provided and their importance differing among systems. Mean
   evaluation scores for the strength of the evidence were moderate to
   strong. However, the number of records for each relationship was often
   low. Consequently, only eight of the 30 causal pathways identified had
   high confidence; a further 14 had medium confidence indicating that
   these have good potential to deliver benefits but warrant further work.
   Although the evidence here was largely qualitative, our results provide
   strong support for the internal benefits that natural capital assets,
   such as on-farm woody systems, can provide to the productivity and
   resilience of grazed dairy enterprises. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Forty rhizobia nodulating four Acacia species (A, gummifera, A.
   raddiana, A. cyanophylla, and A, horrida) were isolated from different
   sites in Morocco, These rhizobia mere compared by analyzing both the 16S
   rRNA gene (rDNA) and the 16S-23S rRNA spacer by PCR with restriction
   fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, Analysis of the length of
   16S-23S spacer showed a considerable diversity within these
   microsymbionts, but RFLP analysis of the amplified spacer revealed no
   additional heterogeneity. Three clusters were identified when 16S rDNA
   analysis was tarried out. Two of these clusters include some isolates
   which nodulate, nonspecifically, the four Acacia species, These
   clusters, A and B, fit within the Sinorhizobium lineage and are closely
   related to S, meliloti and S. fredii, respectively. The third cluster
   appeared to belong to the Agrobacterium-Rhizobium galegae phylum and is
   more closely related to the Agrobacterium tumefaciens species, These
   relations were confirmed by sequencing a representative strain from each

Title = {Agroforestry for ruminants: a review of trees and shrubs as fodder in
   silvopastoral temperate and tropical production systems},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {58},
Number = {5},
Pages = {767-777},
Abstract = {Among the oldest agroforestry systems, silvopastoralism uses shrubs and
   trees to feed ruminants. The practice is common in extensive livestock
   production systems, whereas the intensification of grass-based systems
   in the past century has led to the removal of woody species from
   agricultural temperate landscapes. In Europe however, woody species are
   promoted again on grasslands through environment-friendly policies due
   to the ecosystem services they provide such as carbon sequestration,
   control of soil erosion, limitation of airborne pollutants and
   biodiversity conservation. Positive effects of browse on rumen digestion
   and parasite control have also been documented across different plant
   species and regions. Under optimal conditions, feeding ruminants from
   woody fodder sustains animal production. Nonetheless, limitations can
   restrict the use of woody forage into animal diets, such as the presence
   of anti-nutritive and toxic compounds. The incorporation of this
   resource in ruminant feeding systems raises the question of the
   management of the interface between the plant and the animal. Various
   management systems are practiced. Temperate species such as Salix spp.
   and Populus spp. are fed to sheep and cattle in fodder blocks or by
   pruning trees in New Zealand, and Fraxinus spp. or Corylus avellana in
   hedgerows supply forage to livestock in Belgium, whereas Leucaena
   leucocepahala and Desmanthus spp. browsing is common in Australia.
   Nowadays, ensiling and pelleting techniques are being developed as a way
   to store browse forage. As the renewed interest in using shrubs and
   trees to feed ruminants is recent, especially in temperate regions,
   additional research about the optimal introduction of this resource
   within systems is needed.},

   Ballina, AUSTRALIA, AUG 05-07, 2005},
Abstract = {Mixed-species plantations of Eucalyptus with a nitrogen (N-2) fixing
   species have the potential to increase productivity while maintaining
   soil fertility, compared to Eucalyptus monocultures. However, it is
   difficult to predict combinations of species and sites that will lead to
   these benefits. We review the processes and interactions occurring in
   mixed plantations, and the influence of species or site attributes, to
   aid the selection of successful combinations of species and sites.
   Successful mixtures, where productivity is increased over that of
   monocultures, have often developed stratified canopies, such that the
   less shade-tolerant species overtops the more shade-tolerant species.
   Successful mixtures also have significantly higher rates of N and P
   cycling than Eucalyptus monocultures. It is therefore important to
   select N-2-fixing species with readily decomposable litter and high
   rates of nutrient cycling, as well as high rates of N-2-fixation. While
   the dynamics of N-2-fixation in tree stands are not well understood, it
   appears as though eucalypts can benefit from fixed N as early as the
   first or second year following plantation establishment. A meta-analysis
   of 18 published studies revealed several trials in which mixtures were
   significantly (P < 0.001) more productive than monocultures, and no
   instances in which mixtures were less productive than monocultures.
   Regression analyses of such data were more informative than indices of
   relative yield, and were more informative in trials that contrasted four
   or more different species compositions. Thus replacement series
   examining compositions of 100:0, 67:33, 33:67, and 0: 100 were more
   informative than minimalist 100:0, 50:50 and 0: 100 series. (c) 2006

Title = {Nutritional Composition of Black Soldier Fly Larvae (Hermetia

   in Animal Diets: A Review},
Journal = {INSECTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Simple Summary With the increasing global population, the shortage of
   protein feed resources is becoming more and more serious, and human
   beings urgently need to find new protein sources to replace traditional
   soybean meal and fish meal. Black soldier fly larvae are rich in fatty
   acids, proteins and minerals. Numerous studies have shown that adding
   black soldier fly larvae powder to monogastric animals has no negative
   effects on animal growth performance, meat quality and immunity.
   However, black soldier flies are still subject to legal constraints and
   consumer acceptance when they are used as feed. The rapidly growing
   population has increased demand for protein quantities and, following a
   shortage of plant-based feed protein sources and the prohibition of
   animal-based feed protein, has forced the search for new sources of
   protein. Therefore, humans have turned their attention to edible
   insects. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) (Hermetia illucens L.) are rich
   in nutrients such as fat, protein and high-quality amino acids and
   minerals, making them a good source of protein. Furthermore, BSFL are
   easily reared and propagated on any nutrient substrate such as plant
   residues, animal manure and waste, food scraps, agricultural byproducts,
   or straw. Although BSFL cannot completely replace soybean meal in
   poultry diets, supplementation of less than 20\% has no negative impact
   on chicken growth performance, biochemical indicators and meat quality.
   In pig studies, although BSFL supplementation did not have any negative
   effect on growth performance and meat quality, the feed conversion ratio
   (FCR) was reduced. There is obviously less research on the feeding of
   BSFL in pigs than in poultry, particularly in relation to weaning
   piglets and fattening pigs; further research is needed on the
   supplementation level of sows. Moreover, it has not been found that BSFL
   are used in ruminants, and the next phase of research could therefore
   study them. The use of BSFL in animal feed presents some challenges in
   terms of cost, availability and legal and consumer acceptance. However,
   this should be considered in the context of the current shortage of
   protein feed and the nutritional value of BSFL, which has important
   research significance in animal production.},

Abstract = {This study characterised the response of ruminal fermentation and the
   rumen microbiome in lambs fed commercial vegetal sources of hydrolysable
   tannins (HT) and condensed tannins (CT). Forty-four lambs (19.56 +/-
   2.06 kg) were randomly assigned to either a concentrate diet (CON, n =

   negra, CT-m) and gambier (Uncaria gambir, CT-g)] extracts (all, n = 9)
   for 75 days pre-slaughter. Tannin supplementation did not influence
   ruminal fermentation traits. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that tannins
   did not affect the absolute abundance of ruminal bacteria or fungi.
   However, CT-m (-12.8\%) and CT-g (-11.5\%) significantly reduced the
   abundance of methanogens, while HT-t (-20.7\%) and CT-g (-20.8\%)
   inhibited protozoal abundance. Ribosomal amplicon sequencing revealed
   that tannins caused changes in the phylogenetic structure of the
   bacterial and methanogen communities. Tannins inhibited the fibrolytic
   bacterium, Fibrobacter and tended to suppress the methanogen genus,
   Methanosphaera. Results demonstrated that both HT and CT sources could
   impact the ruminal microbiome when supplemented at 4\% inclusion level.
   HT-t, CT-m and CT-g extracts displayed specific antimicrobial activity
   against methanogens and protozoa without compromising ruminal
   fermentation in a long-term feeding trial.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {As the global population increases and the economy grows rapidly, the
   demand for livestock products such as meat, egg and milk continue to
   increase. The shortage of feed in livestock production is a worldwide
   problem restricting the development of the animal industry. Natural
   woody plants are widely distributed and have a huge biomass yield. The
   fresh leaves and branches of some woody plants are rich in nutrients
   such as proteins, amino acids, vitamins and minerals and can be used to
   produce storage feed such as silage for livestock. Therefore, the
   development and utilization of natural woody plants for clean fermented
   feed is important for the sustainable production of livestock product.
   This paper presents a comprehensive review of the research progress,
   current status and development prospects of forageable natural woody
   plant feed resources. The nutritional composition and uses of natural
   woody plants, the main factors affecting the fermentation of woody plant
   silage and the interaction mechanism between microbial co-occurrence
   network and secondary metabolite are reviewed. Various preparation
   technologies for clean fermentation of woody plant silage were
   summarized comprehensively, which provided a sustainable production mode
   for improving the production efficiency of livestock and producing
   high-quality livestock product. Therefore, woody plants play an
   increasingly important role as a potential natural feed resource in
   alleviating feed shortage and promoting sustainable development of
   livestock product.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {188},
Number = {24},
Pages = {8560-8572},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Leguminous plants and bacteria from the family Rhizobiaceae form a
   symbiotic relationship, which culminates in novel plant structures
   called root nodules. The indeterminate symbiosis that forms between
   Sinorhizobium meliloti and alfalfa requires biosynthesis of Nod factor,
   a beta-1,4-linked lipochitooligosaccharide that contains an essential
   6-O-sulfate modification. S. meliloti also produces sulfated cell
   surface polysaccharides, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The
   physiological function of sulfated cell surface polysaccharides is
   unclear, although mutants of S. meliloti with reduced LPS sulfation
   exhibit symbiotic abnormalities. Using a bioinformatic approach, we
   identified a homolog of the S. meliloti carbohydrate sulfotransferase,
   LpsS, in Mesorhizobium loti. M. loti participates in a determinate
   symbiosis with the legume Lotus japonicus. We showed that M. loti
   produces sulfated forms of LPS and capsular polysaccharide (KPS). To
   investigate the physiological function of sulfated polysaccharides in M.
   loti, we identified and disabled, an M. loti homolog of the
   sulfate-activating genes, nodPQ, which resulted in undetectable amounts
   of sulfated cell surface polysaccharides and a cysteine auxotrophy. We
   concomitantly disabled an M. loti cysH homolog, which disrupted cysteine
   biosynthesis without reducing cell surface polysaccharide sulfation. Our
   experiments demonstrated that the nodPQ mutant, but not the cysH mutant,
   showed an altered KPS structure and a diminished ability to elicit
   nodules on its host legume, Lotus japonicus. Interestingly, the nodPQ
   mutant also exhibited a more rapid growth rate and appeared to
   outcompete wild-type M. loti for nodule colonization. These results
   suggest that sulfated cell surface polysaccharides are required for
   optimum nodule formation but limit growth rate and nodule colonization
   in M. loti.},

Title = {Growth Performance and Plasma Metabolites of Grazing Beef Cattle
   Backgrounded on Buffel or Buffel-Desmanthus Mixed Pastures},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Pasture quality and digestibility decline during the dry
   season resulting in weight loss or marginal weight gains of grazing
   cattle in the seasonally dry subtropics of northern Australia.
   Oversowing grass with legume pastures has shown potential to improve
   pasture quality and cattle weight gain. This study aimed to evaluate the
   change in steers' weight gain and plasma metabolites in response to
   grazing buffel grass pastures oversown with Desmanthus spp.
   (Desmanthus), a tropical legume adapted to cracking clay soils, compared
   to buffel-grass-only pastures. Results showed that Desmanthus at a low
   botanical composition had no effect on weight gain and plasma
   metabolites, although pasture yield and stocking rate were 443 kg/ha and
   9.5\% higher, respectively. Since the productivity of grazing systems
   depends on cattle annual weight gain and stocking rate, the practical
   implication of this study is that Desmanthus may improve the
   profitability of beef production in the dry tropics of northern
   Australia by improving pasture-carrying capacity with no adverse effect
   on cattle health status and growth performance. Dietary crude protein
   and dry matter digestibility are among the major factors limiting feed
   intake and weight gain of cattle grazing native and improved pastures in
   the subtropics of Northern Australia during the dry season.
   Incorporating a suitable legume into grasses improves pasture quality
   and cattle weight gain, but only a limited number of legume pastures can
   establish and persist in cracking clay soils. This study aimed to
   evaluate the effect of Desmanthus inclusion in buffel grass (Cenchrus
   ciliaris) pastures on the plasma metabolite profile and growth
   performance of grazing beef cattle during the dry season. We
   hypothesised that backgrounding steers on buffel grass-Desmanthus mixed
   pastures would elicit significant changes in plasma glucose, bilirubin,
   creatinine, non-esterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate,
   resulting in higher liveweight gains than in steers on buffel grass only
   pastures. Four hundred tropical composite steers were assigned to buffel
   grass only (n = 200) or buffel grass oversown with Desmanthus (11.5\%
   initial sward dry matter) pastures (n = 200) and grazed for 147 days
   during the dry season. Desmanthus accounted for 6.2\% sward dry matter
   at the end of grazing period. Plasma metabolites results showed that
   changes in beta-hydroxybutyrate, creatinine, bilirubin, glucose and
   non-esterified fatty acids were within the expected normal range for all
   the steers, indicating that with or without Desmanthus inclusion in the
   diet of grazing steers, animal health status was not compromised. It was
   also evident that Desmanthus inclusion in buffel grass pastures had no
   impact on the plasma metabolite profile, liveweight and daily weight
   gain of grazing steers. Therefore, our tested hypothesis of higher
   changes in plasma metabolite profile and higher liveweight gains due to
   backgrounding on low-level buffel grass-Desmanthus mixed pastures does
   not hold.},

   (PS). NDF in foliages (FS), NDF in forages (FB), CP in basal roughages
   (PB), CP in diet (PD) and foliage CP intake (SPI). TDMI (g/d) increased
   quadratically (P<0.001) with increasing PS, FS, SPI (R-2=0.66), PB, SD
   (R-2=0.58) and PD (R-2=0.73). The maximal response of TDMI were 778g/d
   at 42\% of SD, 894g/d at 19.8\% PD, 893 g/d at 148g/d SPI and 749g/d at
   26.4\% PS (P<0.001; R-2=0.58, 0.73, 0.66, and 0.37, respectively). BDMI
   increased quadratically with increasing SD, PD and PB, but decreased
   quadratically (P<0.001)with increasing PS (P<0.001; R-2=0.07). The
   breakpoint of BDMI was 570 g/d at 6.58\% of PD in the diet (P<0.001,
   R-2=0.28). Overall, BDMI responded at very low level of SD in the diet.
   peaking at 76\% SD with BDMI of 572 g/d (P<0.001, R-2=0.72). However,
   when PB was less than 3\%, the maximal BDMI was 489 g/d at foliage
   levels of 25.7\%. When PB was between 3 and 6\%, maximal BDMI was at
   13\% of foliage in the diet and the basal forage intake of 597 g/d;
   whereas, BDMI decreased linearly with SD when PB was greater than 6\%.
   BDMI (g/d) decreased quadratically when foliage CP percentages were
   lesser than 10\%, but increased quadratically with PS when foliage CP
   percentages were greater than 10\%. ADG responded positively and
   quadratically to PS, SPI. SD, PD and TDMI (g/d) and the relationships
   were moderate to high. However, ADG (g/d) decreased linearly with
   increasing FS (P<0.001, R-2=035). The maximal ADG was 42 g/d at 43\% of
   SD, 41 g/d at 9.4\% PD, 42 g/d at 53 g/d SPI, 35 g/d at 25\% PS and 46
   g/d at TDMI of 889 g/d (P<0.001; R-2=0.74, 0.84, 0.74, 0.29 and 0.74,
   respectively). It is concluded that the interactions of quality and
   quantity of foliage supplements and quality of basal forages affect
   intakes of basal and total DM, and growth in sheep, (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {A database of 349 treatment mean observations, representing 3404 goats
   from 73 publications between 1973 and 2003, was used to determine
   metabolizable protein (MP) requirements for maintenance (MPm) and growth
   (MPg) of goats. Published CP degradation properties of feedstuffs and
   proportions of dietary ingredients were used to estimate MP intake (MPI,
   g/day), which was regressed against ADG, with both variables scaled by
   BW0.75. Goats were classified as meat (>50\% Boer; 60 observations),
   dairy (selected for milk production; 129 observations) and indigenous
   (160 observations) biotypes. Because of differences (P < 0.01) among
   biotypes in slopes, separate regressions were initially performed-meat:
   MPI = 2.55(S.E. = 0.360) + (0.441(S.E. = 0.0276) x ADG) (n = 58; R-2 =
   0.82); dairy: MPI = 2.83(S.E. = 0.344) + (0.299(S.E. = 0.0238) x ADG) (n
   = 123; R-2 = 0.57); and indigenous: MPI = 3.23(S.E. = 0.212) +
   (0.281(S.E. = 0.0304) x ADG) (n = 152; R-2 = 0.36). Intercepts did not
   differ among biotypes (P = 0.37), but the slope for meat goats differed
   (P < 0.01) from those for dairy and indigenous goats; therefore, data
   sets for dairy and indigenous goats were pooled and split into
   development (n = 150) and evaluation (n = 125) subsets. Using the
   equation derived from the development data subset for dairy and
   indigenous goats (i.e., MPI = 3.14(S.E. = 0.189) + (0.285(S.E. = 0.0168)
   x ADG) (n = 144; R-2 = 0.67)), MPI for the evaluation subset was
   predicted; regressing observed against predicted MPI of the evaluation
   data subset resulted in an intercept and slope not different from 0 and
   1, respectively (P > 0.05). The equation from the development subset for
   dairy and indigenous goats was compared with the equation from the meat
   goat data set; there was a difference (P < 0.01) in slopes but not in
   intercepts (P = 0.25). Therefore, a dummy variable (D = 1 for meat goats
   and 0 otherwise) was used to develop a common intercept equation: MPI =
   3.07(S.E. = 0.165) + (0.290(S.E. = 0.0150) x ADG) + (0.114(S.E. =
   0.0162) x D x ADG) (n = 202; R-2 = 0.75). In conclusion, based on
   regression of MPI against ADG, MPm was 3.07 g/kg BW0.75 for all biotypes
   of growing goats, and MPg was 0.404 and 0.290 g/g ADG for meat and other
   (dairy and indigenous) goats, respectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Effect of Brosimum alicastrum Foliage on Intake, Kinetics of
   Fermentation and Passage and Microbial N Supply in Sheep Fed
   Megathyrsus maximus Hay},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The foliage of the tree Brosimum alicastrum is widely employed by small
   farmers in Latin America to supplement cattle, sheep and goats during
   the dry season. Foliage is manually cut, and the branches are chopped
   and fed directly, being highly palatable to ruminant species. The
   foliage remains green throughout the year, and the tree can be
   defoliated twice per year. Cattle can also directly browse the foliage
   from the tree, but it is mostly used in cut and carry systems and
   transported in carts to farms. The experiment hereby described showed
   that the crude protein fraction of the foliage of B. alicastrum is
   highly fermentable in the rumen, supplying nitrogen for growth of the
   microbial population. As the percent of foliage of B. alicastrum in the
   ration was increased, dry matter intake by sheep was concomitantly
   increased, as was the rate of the passage of digesta through the rumen
   and the supply of microbial nitrogen to the small intestine. The foliage
   of B. alicastrum is a valuable feedstuff for ruminants in the tropics
   and can be used as a cheap source of protein during the critical periods
   of the year to improve weight gain and milk yield in a sustainable way.
   An experiment was carried out to assess the effect of the incorporation
   of sun-dried foliage of Brosimum alicastrum into rations based on hay of
   Megathyrsus maximus on intake, rumen fermentation, kinetics of passage,
   microbial nitrogen supply to the small intestine, apparent digestibility
   in Pelibuey hair sheep. Four rations were randomly allotted to four
   rumen-cannulated lambs (BW = 37.4 +/- 4.9 kg) using a 4 x 4 Latin square
   design to assess the effect of increasing levels (0, 15, 30 and 45\% DM
   basis) of foliage of Brosimum alicastrum on a basal ration of M.
   maximus. Organic matter intake and water consumption increased linearly
   (p < 0.01) with increasing levels of B. alicastrum in the ration. The
   rate and potential extent of rumen fermentation of OM and CP of B.
   alicastrum were 10.6\%/h and 86.6\% and 11.4\%/h and 95.2\%,
   respectively, but no effect (p > 0.05) was found on the potential rumen
   degradation of DM (40.2\%) or on the rate of degradation of DM
   (0.033\%/h) of M. maximus, although a positive effect was found in the
   rumen degradation rate of NDF (p < 0.05). VFA and ammonia concentration
   in the rumen and the rate of passage of solids and liquids through the
   rumen (k1) increased linearly (p < 0.01) with increasing levels of B.
   alicastrum. Rumen pH was not affected by the incorporation of B.
   alicastrum (p > 0.05). Microbial nitrogen supply to the small intestine
   (p < 0.001), apparent digestibility of dry matter (p < 0.01) and NDF (p
   < 0.05) of the rations were also significantly increased as a result of
   the incorporation of B. alicastrum foliage. Results from this experiment
   suggest that the foliage of Brosimum alicastrum can be readily
   incorporated at around 30\% of the ration of dry matter in hair sheep
   with beneficial effects on feed intake, rate of passage and microbial N
   supply to the lower tract.},

Abstract = {Legume Kunitz type trypsin inhibitor (KTI) family is one of the most
   versatile families of proteins. A typical KTI features a single peptide
   folded in beta-trefoil manner, with the molecular weight about 20-22 kDa
   and two disulphide bonds. The members are known to inhibit a wide range
   of serpins proteases at the same time many of them possess unique
   features. Copaifera langsdoiffii Trypsin inhibitor (CTI) has a
   beta-trefoil fold made up of two non-covalently bound polypeptide chains
   with only a single disulfide bridge. Delonix regia Trypsin inhibitor
   (DrTI) has one amino acid insertion between P1 and P2 of the reactive
   site distorting its conformation. Bauhinia bauhinioides Cruzipain
   inhibitor (BbCI) has a conservative beta-trefoil fold but lacks
   disulfide bonds. Such subtle differences in structures make Kunitz
   inhibitors different from other inhibitor families. Most of the studies
   on these inhibitors are focused towards their proposed role in defense
   from insect pests and wounding but their exact physiological role in
   nature is still uncharted. Thus, it would be very interesting to closely
   analyze the structural details of these inhibitors in order to ascertain
   their biological role and other fascinating applications. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas (GHG) produced and released by
   eructation to the atmosphere in large volumes by ruminants. Enteric
   CH(4)contributes significantly to global GHG emissions arising from
   animal agriculture. It has been contended that tropical grasses produce
   higher emissions of enteric CH(4)than temperate grasses, when they are
   fed to ruminants. A number of experiments have been performed in
   respiration chambers and head-boxes to assess the enteric
   CH(4)mitigation potential of foliage and pods of tropical plants, as
   well as nitrates (NO3-) and vegetable oils in practical rations for
   cattle. On the basis of individual determinations of enteric
   CH(4)carried out in respiration chambers, the average CH(4)yield for
   cattle fed low-quality tropical grasses (>70\% ration DM) was 17.0 g
   CH4/kg DM intake. Results showed that when foliage and ground pods of
   tropical trees and shrubs were incorporated in cattle rations, methane
   yield (g CH4/kg DM intake) was decreased by 10\% to 25\%, depending on
   plant species and level of intake of the ration. Incorporation of
   nitrates and vegetable oils in the ration decreased enteric CH(4)yield
   by similar to 6\% to similar to 20\%, respectively. Condensed tannins,
   saponins and starch contained in foliages, pods and seeds of tropical
   trees and shrubs, as well as nitrates and vegetable oils, can be fed to
   cattle to mitigate enteric CH(4)emissions under smallholder conditions.
   Strategies for enteric CH(4)mitigation in cattle grazing low-quality
   tropical forages can effectively increase productivity while decreasing
   enteric CH(4)emissions in absolute terms and per unit of product (e.g.
   meat, milk), thus reducing the contribution of ruminants to GHG
   emissions and therefore to climate change.},

Abstract = {Among a vast number of forage trees, Vachellia karroo (Acacia karroo)
   remains one of the most widely distributed indigenous plant legumes in
   Southern Africa. The plant possesses some striking attributes, such as
   rapid growth rate, drought tolerance, adaptation to alkaline and acidic
   sterile soils, and resistance to a variety of edaphic and temperature
   changes. In past years V. karroo was recognised to be a major threat to
   rangeland productivity owing to its invasive nature. Research interest
   has shifted from its eradication as an unwanted plant to its utilisation
   as a feed resource for livestock. Extensive utilisation of V. karroo is
   mainly hindered by the presence of tannins and spines. Prospects to
   lessen the adverse effects of the anti-nutritional influences are now
   recognised. Vachellia karroo possesses desirable fatty acid profiles,
   and high protein and mineral contents that can improve animal
   performance. Presently, the use of V. karroo for goat production in
   communal areas is restricted owing to limited evidence for its
   nutritional value as animal feed. The present review, therefore, seeks
   to demonstrate the utility potential of V. karroo to improve growth
   performance, carcass characteristics, chevon quality, meat fatty acid
   profiles and as a natural anti-helminth for goats raised under an
   extensive system of production.},

Number = {4},
Pages = {367-380},
Abstract = {A total of about 50 strains of rhizobia from two leguminous trees
   (Acacia and Prosopis) were described and compared with 20 reference
   strains of rhizobia from other tree and herb legumes on the basis of
   protein, fatty acid and plasmid profiles, and DNA-DNA hybridization. The
   rhizobia formed thirteen clusters based on protein profile analysis.
   These clusters were not in complete agreement with a previously
   published cluster analysis based on numerical taxonomy of phenotypic
   characteristics and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profile analysis (Zhang et
   al., Int.J.Syst.Bacteriol. 41, 104, 1991; Lindstrom and Zahran, FEMS
   Microbiol.Lett. 107, 327, 1993). The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) of
   representative strains of rhizobia were analyzed. The rhizobia formed
   fourteen different clusters based on FAME analysis but the results also
   conflicted with the phenotypically based methods of analysis. Strains of
   rhizobia classified in one cluster by any of the above methods of
   analysis may have shown very different fatty acid profiles. The plasmid
   profile analysis of the tree rhizobia, on the other hand, was more
   consistent with the phenotype- and LPS-based numerical analysis. Some
   strains of the tree rhizobia showed medium or high levels of DNA
   homology with Rhizobium meliloti. The DNA-DNA hybridization correlated
   well with protein and fatty acid profiles. The described methods provide
   a significant taxonomic tool for discrimination between rhizobia of
   leguminous trees. However, further DNA-DNA hybridization studies with
   other recognized species of rhizobia are needed for proper
   identification and classification of the diverse rhizobia from

Title = {Examining the Variables Leading to Apparent Incongruity between
   Antimethanogenic Potential of Tannins and Their Observed Effects in
   Ruminants-A Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In recent years, several secondary plant metabolites have been
   identified that possess antimethanogenic properties. Tannin-rich forages
   have the potential to reduce methane emissions in ruminants while also
   increasing their nutrient use efficiency and promoting overall animal
   health. However, results have been highly inconclusive to date, with
   their antimethanogenic potential and effects on both animal performance
   and nutrition being highly variable even within a plant species. This
   variability is attributed to the structural characteristics of the
   tannins, many of which have been linked to an increased antimethanogenic
   potential. However, these characteristics are seldom considered in
   ruminant nutrition studies-often because the analytical techniques are
   inadequate to identify tannin structure and the focus is mostly on total
   tannin concentrations. Hence, in this article, we (i) review previous
   research that illustrate the variability of the antimethanogenic
   potential of forages; (ii) identify the source of inconsistencies behind
   these results; and (iii) discuss how these could be optimized to
   generate comparable and repeatable results. By adhering to this roadmap,
   we propose that there are clear links between plant metabolome and
   physiology and their antimethanogenic potential that can be established
   with the ultimate goal of improving the sustainable intensification of
   livestock.},

Abstract = {Crop management without fertilizer input, which is commonly practiced by
   most farmers in the humid forest zone of West and Central Africa,
   requires soil fertility replenishment during a fallow period.
   Hypothetical relationships between fallow length and crop yields assume,
   that after the cropping phase replenishment starts with high annual
   increments, leading to an early recovery of most soil fertility, then
   slowly approaching a maximum level. The few available empirical data,
   however, indicate that this assumption is wrong. Within the first 8
   years of fallow, biomass and nutrient accumulation is either progressive
   (low initial increments) or linear. Planted fallows are supposed to
   replenish soil fertility faster or to higher levels than natural
   regrowth and should thus lead to higher crop yields. Two major types of
   planted fallow are distinguished: tree-based and herbaceous fallows.
   Data from West and Central Africa do not confirm that tree based fallows
   are generally capable of attaining higher crop yields than natural
   regrowth or other planted fallows. The majority of experiments with
   tree-based fallows showed no differences to the control (60.0\%). Crop
   yield declines were found in 15.7\% of cases, and only 24.3\% resulted
   in significant yield increases. Changes in soil properties were more
   frequently positive (34.3\%) than negative (9.8\%), yet, most often
   (55.9\%), there was no effect. Herbaceous fallow had dominantly positive
   effects on crop yields (52.5\% of cases), with only 3\% of cases in
   which significant reductions were observed. Positive features of some
   herbaceous fallows, such as easy establishment, rapid weed suppression,
   and labor efficient slash-and-burn crop establishment make the
   technology more likely to be accepted and adopted by farmers. It appears
   that fallows have to be specifically designed for responsive crops, i.e.
   maize. It is unlikely that one type of fallow can serve the multitude of
   crops and intercrops grown in the region. Depending on the major
   constraints to crop production or income generation, planted fallows
   have to be specifically designed to address these constraints. This may
   require de-emphasizing the soil fertility aspect and focusing on
   marketable fallow by-products, weed and pest suppression and reduced
   labor requirements. Thus, future impact through research on planted
   fallows will depend on exact targeting of specific fallow types and
   species to the most responsive crops and to explicit farmer
   circumstances.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Databases amassed from the literature were used to predict feed intake
   by lactating, Angora, growing and mature goats, using 221, 54, 282 and
   99 treatment means, respectively. One prediction approach was based on a
   calculated constant overall efficiency of ME utilization (k) considering
   biotype (meat, greater than or equal to50\% Boer; dairy; indigenous;
   Angora), BW (kg; all goats), 4\% fat-corrected milk (FCM, kg;
   lactating), BW change or ADG (kg; lactating, growing and mature),
   dietary ME concentration (MEC, MJ/kg DM; all goats), tissue gain (TG,
   kg; Angora) and clean mohair fiber gain (FG, kg; Angora). For lactating
   goats, assumptions included efficiency of ME utilization for maintenance
   and activity: 0.503 + (0.019 x MEC); efficiency of ME use for gain
   (k(g)): 0.75; efficiency of use of mobilized ME for lactation: 0.84;
   efficiency of use of dietary ME for lactation: 0.589; tissue energy
   concentration (TEC): 23.9 MJ/kg; ME requirement for maintenance and
   stall or pen activity (ME(m)REQ): 0.5013 and 0.4227 MJ/kg BW0.75 for
   dairy and other goats, respectively; and all mobilized tissue energy
   used for lactation. After removing observations with residuals greater
   than 1.5 x root mean square error (RMSE), k was 0.653 (S.E. = 0.0014).
   Predicted DM intake (DMIP) including an adjustment (DMIAP) for the ratio
   of ADG:FCM (ADGFCM) was: DMI = 0.0964 (S.E. = 0.0704) + (0.9334 (S.E. =
   0.9314) x DMIP) - (0.1237 (S.E. = 0.05923) x ADGFCM) (R-2 = 0.84; RMSE =
   0.2187; n = 191). Mean k, estimated from a random development data set,
   resulted in unbiased prediction of intake for an evaluation data set
   without observations removed. Assumptions for Angora goats that differed
   from lactating goats were efficiency of ME use for tissue gain (TG;
   kg/day): 0.006 + (0.0423 x MEC); efficiency of use of ME (dietary and
   mobilized tissue) for clean fiber gain (FG): 0.151; TEC = 4.972 +
   (0.3274 x kg BW); MEm: 0.473 MJ/kg BW0.75; ME used for FG: FG x 157
   MJ/kg; and all mobilized tissue energy used for FG. Mean k for Angora
   goats was 0.525 (S.E. = 0.0112), and prediction accuracy was improved by
   adjusting for dietary CP concentration (PTCP, \% DM): DMI = -0.1607
   (S.E. = 0.11430) + (0.8227 (S.E. = 0.10851) x DMIP) + (0.0199 (S.E. =
   0.00697) x PTCP) (R-2 = 0.65; RMSE = 0.1239; n = 54). Assumptions for
   growing goats included: k(g): 0.006 + (0.0423 x MEC); efficiency of use
   of mobilized tissue energy for maintenance: k(m); and ME(m)REQ: 0.489,
   0.580 and 0.489 MJ/kg BW0.75 for meat, dairy and indigenous goats,
   respectively. After removing observations with residuals greater than 2
   x RMSE, k was 0.634 (S.E. = 0.0020). Prediction accuracy was improved by
   adjusting for ratios of ADG to BW (ADGBW), BW0.75 (ADGMBW) and
   ADGMBW(2): DMI = -0.0047 (S.E. = 0.1854) + (0.9637 (S.E. = 0.04928) x
   DMIP) - (70.27 (S.E. = 23.534) x ADGBW) + (38.71 (S.E. = 12.224) x
   ADGMBW) - (243.4 (S.E. = 121.73) x ADGMBW(2)) (R-2 = 0.88; RMSE = 0.
   1030; n = 266). Mean k estimated from a random development data set
   resulted in unbiased prediction of intake for an evaluation data set
   without observations removed.
   Assumptions for mature goats were the same as those for growing goats
   except for a ME(m)REQ of 0.462 MJ/kg BW0.75. k was 0.632 (S.E. =
   0.00448), and prediction accuracy was improved by adjusting for PTCP,
   ADGBW and ADGMBW: DMI = -0.1241 (S.E. = 0.07374)+(0.7915 (S.E. =
   0.06911)xDMI(P))+(0.0214 (S.E. = 0.00381) x PTCP) - 535.2 (S.E. = 66.35)
   x ADGW) + (247.3 (S.E. = 29.53) x ADGMBW) R-2 = 0.85; RMSE = 0.1537; n =
   99). Because of the relatively large number of observations in this
   study, these methods should be useful for predicting voluntary intake of
   different diets by a variety of goats in or near thermoneutral
   conditions fed in pens or stalls. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The research was carried out at the animal experimental station of the
   National Agricultural Research Institute of the French West Indies
   (Guadeloupe) in 1999. Effects on intake and digestion by sheep of
   addition of Gliricidia leaves to a diet of 35-day-old Digitaria
   decumbens (pangola) hay, have been studied. In a first trial (a 4 x 4
   Latin Square design), four rams were fed four diets: hay (GO); hay plus
   1300 g of Gliricidia (G0.25), hay plus 2600 g of Gliricidia (G0.50), hay
   plus 3900 g of Gliricidia (G0.75). Total dry matter intake (DM), hay and
   Gliricidia intake, total tract and rumen digestibility of DM and its
   components, microbial and total nitrogen flows were estimated. In a
   second trial (a 2 x 2 Latin Square design), the same animals received
   hay (GO) or Gliricidia (G 1.00) ad libitum to estimate the rumen
   turnover of pangola and Gliricidia fibrous particle. Neutral detergent
   fibre and crude protein content of the Digitaria decumbens hay and
   Gliricidia were 746 and 51, 458 and 198 g/kg dry matter respectively.
   Total dry matter intake (DM) varied from 42.7 to 76 g DM/kg LW0.75 from
   G0 to G0.75. The rate of substitution of pangola by Gliricidia (decrease
   of pangola intake for one unit Gliricidia consumed) was 233 g/kg. The
   digestibility of cell-wall linearly decreased with increasing level of
   Gliricidia in the diet. No digestive interaction was registered in the
   mixed diets. The total nitrogen and microbial nitrogen duodenal flows
   increased with the level of Gliricidia in the diet. The rumen turnover
   of fibrous particles of Gliricidia was double that of pangola. The
   incorporation of Gliricidia in diets increases their nutritive value by
   higher intake and intestinal nitrogen duodenal flows, but no positive
   digestive interaction was observed between pangola hay and Gliricidia
   leaves.},

Abstract = {Livestock production systems worldwide rely largely on conventional
   feedstuffs. The current world food crisis highlights the need to improve
   the use of local resources for animal nutrition, such as fodder trees
   and shrubs. The detrimental effects of tropical tannin-rich plants (TRP)
   on animal production have been frequently described. In contrast, their
   potential benefits have long been neglected. This paper presents the
   potential positive effects of tropical TRP on small ruminants either as
   source of feed or as nutraceuticals with anthelmintic (AH) properties.
   It also analyses the host behavioral and physiological adaptations
   associated with exploitation of those tannin-rich resources. Both sheep
   and goats preferred a mixture of plants even when tannin-free forage was
   available. Moreover, the preference for TRP by goats and hair sheep were
   mainly associated with the digestible fraction of fiber and to a less
   extent with tannin content, which implies that they do not necessarily
   select against TRP. The addition of polyethylene glycol did not modify
   the preference or intake of TRP by goats and sheep. Evidence of
   physiological adaptation to TRP is presented and discussed. Both,
   experienced hair sheep and goats had saliva with tannin binding
   capacity, enabling both species to eat higher quantities of TRP which
   could lead to a higher availability of tannins in the gastrointestinal
   tract. Tannins in the gastrointestinal tract could be an AH against
   gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN). Indeed, in vitro and in vivo studies
   have shown AH effects of tannins from TRP, suggesting their possible use
   as natural anthelmintics against GIN. This paper supports the change in
   the current view of tannins in TRP as anti-nutritional compounds. If
   adequately managed. TRP can be a valuable component of sustainable small
   ruminant production systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We explored the genetic basis of the promiscuous symbiosis of Sophora
   flavescens with diverse rhizobia. To determine the impact of Nod factors
   (NFs) on the symbiosis of S. flavescens, nodulation-related gene mutants
   of representative rhizobial strains were generated. Strains with
   mutations in common nodulation genes (nodC, nodM, and nodE) failed to
   nodulate S. flavescens, indicating that the promiscuous nodulation of
   this plant is strictly dependent on the basic NF structure. Mutations of
   the NF decoration genes nodH, nodS, nodZ, and noeI did not affect the
   nodulation of S. flavescens, but these mutations affected the
   nitrogen-fixation efficiency of nodules. Wild-type Bradyrhizobium
   diazoefficiens USDA110 cannot nodulate S. flavescens, but we obtained 14
   Tn5 mutants of B. diazoefficiens that nodulated S. flavescens. This
   suggested that the mutations had disrupted a negative regulator that
   prevents nodulation of S. flavescens, leading to nonspecific nodulation.
   For Ensifer fredii CCBAU 45436 mutants, the minimal NF structure was
   sufficient for nodulation of soybean and S. flavescens. In summary, the
   mechanism of promiscuous symbiosis of S. flavescens with rhizobia might
   be related to its nonspecific recognition of NF structures, and the host
   specificity of rhizobia may also be controlled by currently unknown
   nodulation-related genes.},

Abstract = {Tannins are one of the important plant secondary metabolites having wide
   prevalence in the plant kingdom. They are a prominent constituent of
   various types of feed, fodder and agro-industrial wastes. The intake of

   effects in ruminants. However, the use of tannin-rich biomass as animal
   feed, having high content of tannins, is limited by the antinutritional
   effects of tannins at this level in an animal system. A number of
   physical, chemical, biological and miscellaneous approaches have been
   developed for inactivation or removal of tannins for enhancement of the
   feeding value of tannin-rich biomass. However, none of the individual
   method is successful in total inactivation or removal of tannins without
   loss of nutritive value, and this limits the utilization of a vast
   amount of plant resource. A cohesive and an integrated detanninification
   strategy is required for alleviating the antinutritional effects of

Abstract = {Recognition is increasingly given to the need of improving agricultural
   production and efficiency to meet growing global food demand, while
   minimising environmental impacts. Livestock forms an important component
   of global food production and is a significant contributor to
   anthropogenic greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. As such, livestock
   production systems (LPS) are coming under increasing pressure to lower
   their emissions. In developed countries, LPS have been gradually
   reducing their emissions per unit of product (emissions intensity; EI)
   over time through improvements in production efficiency. However, the
   global challenge of reducing net emissions (NE) from livestock requires
   that the rate of decline in EI surpasses the productivity increases
   required to satisfy global food demand. Mechanistic and dynamic whole
   farm-system models can be used to estimate farm-gate GHG emissions and
   to quantify the likely changes in farm NE, EI, farm productivity and
   farm profitability as a result of applying various mitigation
   strategies. Such models are also used to understand the complex
   interactions at the farm-system level and to account for how component
   mitigation strategies perform within the complexity of these
   interactions, which is often over looked when GHG mitigation research is
   performed only at the component level. The results of such analyses can
   be used in extension activities and to encourage adoption, increase

Abstract = {Those nonprotein amino acids found in food and fodder plants and known
   to be toxic to man and domestic animals are described. These include
   toxins from many legume genera including Lathyrus, from other higher

   synthesis, while others are incorporated into proteins with toxic
   effects. Basic processes such as urea synthesis and neurotransmission
   may be disrupted. The probable roles of nonprotein amino acids in
   protecting plants against predators, pathogens, and competing plant
   species are considered. The need to learn more of the nutritive value of
   nontoxic nonprotein amino acids and to explore the potential of others
   either as drugs or as leads to drugs in human and veterinary medicine is

Title = {Enteric methane mitigation strategies for ruminant livestock systems in
   the Latin America and Caribbean region: A meta-analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {312},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) is a developing region characterized
   for its importance for global food security, producing 23 and 11\% of
   the global beef and milk production, respectively. The region's ruminant
   livestock sector however, is under scrutiny on environmental grounds due
   to its large contribution to enteric methane (CH4) emissions and
   influence on global climate change. Thus, the identification of
   effective CH4 mitigation strategies which do not compromise animal
   performance is urgently needed, especially in context of the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDG) defined in the Paris Agreement of the United
   Nations. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to: 1)
   collate a database of individual sheep, beef and dairy cattle records
   from enteric CH4 emission studies conducted in the LAC region, and 2)
   perform a meta-analysis to identify feasible enteric CH4 mitigation
   strategies, which do not compromise animal performance. After outlier's
   removal, 2745 animal records (65\% of the original data) from 103
   studies were retained (from 2011 to 2021) in the LAC database. Potential
   mitigation strategies were classified into three main categories (i.e.,
   animal breeding, dietary, and rumen manipulation) and up to three
   subcategories, totaling 34 evaluated strategies. A random effects model
   weighted by inverse variance was used (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis
   V3.3.070). Six strategies decreased at least one enteric CH4 metric and
   simultaneously increased milk yield (MY; dairy cattle) or average daily
   gain (ADG; beef cattle and sheep). The breed composition F1 Holstein x
   Gyr decreased CH4 emission per MY (CH4IMilk) while increasing MY by
   99\%. Adequate strategies of grazing management under continuous and
   rotational stocking decreased CH4 emission per ADG (CH4IGain) by 22 and
   35\%, while increasing ADG by 22 and 71\%, respectively. Increased
   dietary protein concentration, and increased concentrate level through
   cottonseed meal inclusion, decreased CH4IMilk and CH4IGain by 10 and
   20\% and increased MY and ADG by 12 and 31\%, respectively. Lastly,
   increased feeding level decreased CH4IGain by 37\%, while increasing ADG
   by 171\%. The identified effective mitigation strategies can be adopted
   by livestock producers according to their specific needs and aid LAC
   countries in achieving SDG as defined in the Paris Agreement.},

Abstract = {The sustainability of plantation forests is closely dependent on soil
   nitrogen availability in short-rotation forests established on
   low-fertility soils. Planting an understorey of nitrogen-fixing trees
   might be an attractive option for maintaining the N fertility of soils.
   The development of mono-specific stands of Acacia mangium (100A:0E) and
   Eucalyptus grandis (0A:100E) was compared with mixed-species
   plantations, where A. mangium was planted in a mixture at a density of
   50\% of that of E. grandis (50A:100E). N(2) fixation by A. mangium was
   quantified in 100A:0E and 50A:100E at age 18 and 30 months by the (15)N
   natural abundance method and in 50A:100E at age 30 months by the (15)N
   dilution method. The consistency of results obtained by isotopic methods
   was checked against observations of nodulation, Specific Acetylene
   Reduction Activity (SARA), as well as the dynamics of N accumulation
   within both species. The different tree components (leaves, branches,
   stems, stumps, coarse roots, medium-sized roots and fine roots) were
   sampled on 5-10 trees per species for each age. Litter fall was assessed
   up to 30 months after planting and used to estimate fine root mortality.
   Higher N concentrations in A. mangium tree components than in E. grandis
   might be a result of N,, fixation. However, no evidence of N transfer
   from A. mangium to E. grandis was found. SARA values were not
   significantly different in 100A:0E and 50A: 100E but the biomass of
   nodules was 20-30 times higher in 100A:0E than in 50A: 100E. At age 18
   months, higher delta(15)N values found in A. mangium tree components
   than in E. grandis components prevented reliable estimations of the
   percentage of N derived from atmospheric fixation (\%Ndfa). At age 30
   months, \%Ndfa estimated by natural abundance and by 15N dilution
   amounted to 10-20 and 60\%, respectively. The amount of N derived from
   N(2) fixation in the standing biomass was estimated at 62 kg N ha(-1) in
   100A:0E and 3 kg N ha(-1) in 50A:100E by the (15)N natural abundance
   method, and 16 kg N ha(-1) in 50A:100E by the (15)N dilution method. The
   total amount of atmospheric N, fixed since planting (including fine root
   mortality and litter fall) was estimated at 66 kg N ha(-1) in 100A:0E
   and 7 kg N ha(-1) in 50A:100E by the (15)N natural abundance method, and
   31 kg N ha(-1) in 50A:100E by the (15)N dilution method. The most
   reliable estimation of N(2) fixation was likely to be achieved using the
   (15)N dilution method and sampling the whole plant. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {A fundamental shift has taken place in agricultural research and world
   food production. In the past, the principal driving force was to
   increase the yield potential of food crops and to maximize productivity.
   Today, the drive for productivity is increasingly combined with a desire
   for sustainability. For farming systems to remain productive, and to be
   sustainable in the long-term, it will be necessary to replenish the
   reserves of nutrients which are removed or lost from the soil. In the
   case of nitrogen (N), inputs into agricultural systems may be in the
   form of N-fertilizer, or be derived from atmospheric N-2 via biological
   N-2 fixation (BNF).
   Although BNF has long been a component of many farming systems
   throughout the world, its importance as a primary source of N for
   agriculture has diminished in recent decades as increasing amounts of
   fertilizer-N are used for the production of food and cash crops.
   However, international emphasis on environmentally sustainable
   development with the use of renewable resources is likely to focus
   attention on the potential role of BNF in supplying N for agriculture.
   This paper documents inputs of N via symbiotic N-2 fixation measured in
   experimental plots and in farmers' fields in tropical and temperate
   regions. It considers contributions of fixed N from legumes (crop,
   pasture, green manures and trees), Casuarina, and Azolla, and compares
   the relative utilization of N derived from these sources with fertilizer
   N.},

Abstract = {Intraspecific competition is an ecological process that can affect the
   structure of populations with important consequences for population
   persistence. In this study, we investigated (in the larval stage) the
   effect of intraspecific competition in the seed-feeding beetle
   Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus on its population structure and
   persistence. By using Leslie matrices, which are useful to project
   future population sizes of structured populations, we conducted
   demographic analysis when competition was (more than one larva per seed)
   and was not (one larva per seed) present. The hypothesis that
   competition reduces the finite rate of population growth, the survival
   of the immatures and the fecundity of females, influencing population
   persistence, was tested. To understand whether intraspecific competition
   is a common process in this system, the oviposition pattern was also
   studied. We found that in the presence of competition, the larvae from
   the third instar were smaller than those in the absence of competition
   and, in the presence of competition, fewer larvae reached the adult
   stage. Larval survival was lower in the presence of competition,
   particularly from the third larval stage until the pupal stage, and the
   fecundity of females was also reduced in the presence of competition,
   which affected the population structure. Although we showed that
   populations may either grow geometrically or go extinct in absence and
   presence of competition, respectively, the finite rates of population
   increase did not differ from 1.0 when compared to the estimated
   confidence intervals. Therefore, although larval competition may affect
   the structure of this seed-feeding beetle, there is no clear evidence
   that this ecological process can negatively affect its persistence.
   Furthermore, most seeds with eggs had just one egg per seed, which
   suggests that competition should occur with low frequency under natural
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Trees can influence both the supply and availability of nutrients in the
   soil. Trees increase the supply of nutrients within the rooting zone of
   crops through (1) input of N by biological N-2 fixation, (2) retrieval
   of nutrients from below the rooting zone of crops and (3) reduction in
   nutrient losses from processes such as leaching and erosion. Trees can
   increase the availability of nutrients through increased release of
   nutrients from soil organic matter (SOM) and recycled organic residues.
   Roots of trees frequently extend beyond the rooting depth of crops.
   Research on a Kandiudalfic Eutrudox in western Kenya showed that
   fast-growing trees with high N demand (Calliandra calothyrsus, Sesbania
   sesban and Eucalyptus grandis) took up subsoil nitrate that had
   accumulated below the rooting depth of annual crops. Sesbania sesban was
   also more effective than a natural grass fallow in extracting subsoil
   water, suggesting less leaching loss of nutrients under S. sesban than
   under natural uncultivated fallows.
   Nutrient release from SOM is normally more dependent on the portion of
   the SOM in biologically active fractions than on total quantity of SOM.
   Trees can increase inorganic soil N, N mineralization and amount of N in
   light fraction SOM. Among six tree fallows of 2- and 3-year duration on
   an Ustic Rhodustalf in Zambia, inorganic N and N mineralization were
   higher for the two tree species with lowest (lignin + polyphenol)-to-N
   ratio (mean = 11) in leaf litter than for the two tree species with
   highest ratio (mean = 20) in leaf litter. Trees can also restore soil
   fauna, which are important for SOM and plant residue decomposition.
   Some agroforestry trees have potential to provide N in quantities
   sufficient to support moderate crop yields through (i) N inputs from
   biological N-2 fixation and retrieval of nitrate from deep soil layers
   and (ii) cycling of N from plant residues and manures. The cycling of P
   from organic materials is normally insufficient to meet the P
   requirements of crops. Sustained crop production with agroforestry on
   P-deficient soils will typically require external P inputs.},

Abstract = {To develop a technology for the degradation of the toxic and refractory
   pollutants, the Fe-0-PM-PS system and 6 control experiments were setup
   in this study. First, effects of Fe dosage (0-18.3 g/L), PM dosage
   (0-25.0 mmol/L), PS dosage (0-30.0 mmol/L), initial pH value (3.0-11.0),
   air flow rate (0-2.0 L/min), and feeding times of PM and PS (1-5) on the
   degradation of PNP in aqueous solution by the Fe-0-PM-PS system were
   studied through the single-factor experiment. Furthermore, the optimized
   experimental conditions (i.e., Fe-0 dosage of 11.9 g/L, PM dosage of
   15.0 mmol/L, PS dosage of 18.1 mmol/L and feeding times of oxidants of
   4) were obtained through response surface methodology (RSM). The result
   shows that the maximum COD removal efficiency (89.0\%) was obtained by
   the Fe-0-PM-PS system under the optimal conditions, which was mainly
   attributed to the strong synergistic effect among Fe-0, PM and PS. In
   addition, PNP degradation pathway was proposed according to the
   intermediates detected by HPLC. According to the analysis results of
   SEM-EDS, XRD and XPS, the reaction mechanism of the Fe-0-PM-PS system
   has been clarified thoroughly. In short, these results suggest that the
   Fe-0-PM-PS system should be proposed as an effective pretreatment

Abstract = {The integration of trees. especially nitrogen fixing trees (NFTs), into
   agroforestry and silvo-pastoral systems can make a major contribution to
   sustainable agriculture by restoring and maintaining soil fertility, and
   in combating erosion and desertification as well as providing fuelwood.
   The particular advantage of NFTs is their biological nitrogen fixation
   (BNF), their ability to establish in nitrogen-deficient soils and the
   benefits of the nitrogen fixed (and extra organic matter) to succeeding
   or associated crops.
   The importance of NFTs leads to the question of how we can maximise or
   optimize their effects and how we can manage BNF and the transfer of
   nitrogen to associated or succeeding plantings. To be able to achieve
   these goals. suitable methods of measuring BNF in trees are necessary.
   The total nitrogen difference (TND) method is simple, but is better
   suited for low than high soil N conditions. The acetylene  reduction
   assay (ARA), although sensitive and simple, has many technical
   limitations especially for NFTs, and the estimates of BNF have generally
   been very low, compared to other methods. For NFTs, the N-15 techniques
   are still under development, but have already given some promising
   results (e.g., has been used to measure large genetic variability in BNF
   within different NFTs).
   Various  factors affect BNF in trees. They include the age of trees, the
   microbial component. soil moisture,  temperature, salinity, pH, soil N
   level and plant nutrient deficiencies. Some of the factors, e.g.
   temperature. affect the symbiosis more than plant growth, and
   differences in the effects of these factors on BNF in different NFT
   genotypes have been reported. These factors and research needs for
   improving BNF in trees are discussed.},

Abstract = {The use of natural products that can serve as natural herbicides and

   Woody plants can produce allelochemicals, but they are studied much less

   woody species with neighboring plants in the process of introduction or
   invasion, co-cultivation with agricultural crops (agroforestry) or in
   plantation forestry (multiclonal or multispecies plantations). This
   review describes woody plants with the greatest allelopathic potential,
   allelochemicals derived from them, and the prospects for their use as

Abstract = {Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) associated with trees and shrubs
   plays a major role in the functioning of many ecosystems, from natural
   woodlands to plantations and agroforestry systems, but it is
   surprisingly difficult to quantify the amounts of N-2 fixed. Some of the
   problems involved in measuring N-2 fixation by woody perennials include:
   (a) diversity in occurrence, and large plant-to-plant variation in
   growth and nodulation status of N-2-fixing species, especially in
   natural ecosystems; (b) long-term, perennial nature of growth and the
   seasonal or year-to-year changes in patterns of N assimilation; and (c)
   logistical limitations of working with mature trees which are generally
   impossible to harvest in their entirety. The methodology which holds
   most promise to quantify the contributions of N-2 fixation to trees is
   the so-called `N-15 natural abundance' technique which exploits
   naturally occurring differences in N-15 composition between
   plant-available N sources in the soil and that of atmospheric N-2. In
   this review we discuss probable explanations for the origin of the small
   differences in N-15 abundance found in different N pools in both natural
   and man-made ecosystems and utilise previously published information and
   unpublished data to examine the potential advantages and limitations
   inherent in the application of the technique to study N-2 fixation by
   woody perennials. Calculation of the proportion of the plant N derived
   from atmospheric N-2 (\%Ndfa) using the natural abundance procedure
   requires that both the N-15 natural abundance of the N derived from BNF
   and that derived from the soil by the target N-2-fixing species be
   determined. It is then assumed that the N-15 abundance of the N-2-fixing
   species reflects the relative contributions of the N derived from these
   two sources. The N-15 abundance of the N derived from BNF (B) can vary
   with micro-symbiont, plant species/provenance and growth stage, all of
   which create considerable difficulties for its precise evaluation. If
   the \%Ndfa is large and the N-15 abundance of the N acquired from other
   sources is not several delta(15)N units higher or lower than B, then
   this can be a major source of error. Further difficulties can arise in
   determining the N-15 abundance of the N derived from soil (and plant
   litter, etc.) by the target plant as it is usually impossible to predict
   which, if any, non-N-2-fixing reference species will obtain N from the
   same N sources in the same proportions with the same temporal and
   spatial patterns as the N-2-fixing perennial. The compromise solution is
   to evaluate the N-15 abundance of a diverse range of neighbouring
   non-N-2-fixing plants and to compare these values with that of the
   N-2-fixing species and the estimate of B. Only then can it be determined
   whether the contribution of BNF to the target species can be quantified
   with any degree of confidence. This review of the literature suggests
   that while the natural abundance technique appears to provide
   quantitative measures of BNF in tree plantation and agroforestry
   systems, particular difficulties may arise which can often limit its
   application in natural ecosystems.},

Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Mining activities generally decrease topsoil and vegetation, reduce soil
   biodiversity, and yield extremely harsh environmental conditions, which
   in turn limit natural revegetation and soil restoration. Ecological
   restoration of mining sites using beneficial microorganisms such as
   arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (AMF) is considered necessary and
   useful. In this article, several aspects of AMF-assisted ecological
   restoration of mining-impacted sites were reviewed. First, the data
   collected from 98 previous studies show that more than 80\% of surveyed
   plants growing on mining sites are colonized by AMF, and a great number
   of AMF species and a large AMF diversity exist in various
   mining-impacted sites. Second, AMF can promote ecological restoration of
   mining-impacted sites through various possible mechanisms at different
   scales, such as improving mineral acquisition and tolerance of host
   plants, contributing to soil structure and quality, and helping maintain
   ecosystem stability and functioning. Third, a total of 101 studies on
   AMF and mine restoration, including 22 field and 79 laboratory
   experiments, were summarized, most of which (95\%) confirm that AMF
   exhibit significant positive effects, such as increased plant survival,
   enhanced growth and nutrition, improved soil structure and quality, and
   greater plant re-establishment. Finally, the future prospects regarding
   enhancing AMF-assisted restoration were discussed.},

Abstract = {Agricultural landscapes are increasingly being managed with the aim of
   enhancing the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services and
   sustainability of production systems. However, agricultural management
   that maximizes provisioning ecosystem services can often reduce both
   regulating and maintenance services. We hypothesized that agroforestry
   reduces trade-offs between provisioning and regulating/maintenance
   services. We conducted a quantitative synthesis of studies carried out
   in sub-Saharan Africa focusing on crop yield (as an indicator of
   provisioning services), soil fertility, erosion control, and water
   regulation (as indicators of regulating/maintenance services). A total
   of 1106 observations were extracted from 126 peer-reviewed publications
   that fulfilled the selection criteria for meta-analysis of studies
   comparing agroforestry and non-agroforestry practices (hereafter
   control) in sub-Saharan Africa. Across ecological conditions,
   agroforestry significantly increased crop yield, total soil nitrogen,
   soil organic carbon, and available phosphorus compared to the control.
   Agroforestry practices also reduced runoff and soil loss and improved
   infiltration rates and soil moisture content. No significant differences
   were detected between the different ecological conditions, management
   regimes, and types of woody perennials for any of the ecosystem
   services. Main trade-offs included low available phosphorus and low soil
   moisture against higher crop yield. This is the first meta-analysis that
   shows that, on average, agroforestry systems in sub-Saharan Africa
   increase crop yield while maintaining delivery of regulating/maintenance
   ecosystem services. We also demonstrate how woody perennials have been
   managed in agricultural landscapes to provide multiple ecosystem
   services without sacrificing crop productivity. This is important in
   rural livelihoods where the range of ecosystem services conveys benefits
   in terms of food security and resilience to environmental shocks.},

Abstract = {We compiled quantitative estimates on symbiotic N-2 fixation by trees in
   agroforestry systems (AFS) in order to evaluate the critical
   environmental and management factors that affect the benefit from N-2
   fixation to system N economy. The so-called ``N-2-fixing tree{''} is a
   tripartite symbiotic system composed of the plant, N-2-fixing bacteria,
   and mycorrhizae-forming fungi. Almost 100 recognised rhizobial species
   associated with legumes do not form an evolutionary homologous clade and
   are functionally diverse. The global bacterial diversity is still
   unknown. Actinorrhizal symbioses in AFS remain almost unstudied.
   Dinitrogen fixation in AFS should be quantified using N isotopic methods
   or long-term system N balances. The general average +/- A standard
   deviation of tree dependency on N-2 fixation (\%Ndfa) in 38 cases using
   N isotopic analyses was 59 +/- A 16.6 \%. Under humid and sub-humid
   conditions, the percentage was higher in young (69 +/- A 10.7 \%) and
   periodically pruned trees (63 +/- A 11.8 \%) than in free-growing trees
   (54 +/- A 11.7 \%). High variability was observed in drylands (range
   10-84 \%) indicating need for careful species and provenance selection
   in these areas. Annual N-2 fixation was the highest in improved fallow
   and protein bank systems, 300-650 kg {[}N] ha(-1). General average for
   16 very variable AFS was 246 kg {[}N] ha(-1), which is enough for
   fulfilling crop N needs for sustained or increasing yield in low-input
   agriculture and reducing N-fertiliser use in large-scale agribusiness.
   Leaf litter and green mulch applications release N slowly to the soil
   and mostly benefit the crop through long-term soil improvement. Root and
   nodule turnover and N rhizodeposition from N-2-fixing trees are sources
   of easily available N for the crop yet they have been largely ignored in
   agroforestry research. There is also increasing evidence on direct N
   transfer from N-2-fixing trees to crops, e.g. via common mycelial
   networks of mycorrhizal fungi or absorption of tree root exudates by the
   crop. Research on the below-ground tree-crop-microbia interactions is
   needed for fully understanding and managing N-2 fixation in AFS.},

Abstract = {The rate and extent to which biophysical resources are captured and
   utilized by the components of an agroforestry system are determined by
   the nature and intensity of interactions between the components. The net
   effect of these interactions is often determined by the influence of the
   tree component on the other component(s) and/or on the overall system,
   and is expressed in terms of such quantifiable responses as soil
   fertility changes, microclimate modification, resource (water,
   nutrients, and light) availability and utilization, pest and disease
   incidence, and allelopathy. The paper reviews such manifestations of
   biophysical interactions in major simultaneous (e.g., hedgerow
   intercropping and trees on croplands) and sequential (e.g., planted tree
   fallows) agroforestry systems.
   In hedgerow intercropping (HI), the hedge/crop interactions are
   dominated by soil fertility improvement and competition for growth
   resources. Higher crop yields in HI than in sole cropping are noted
   mostly in inherently fertile soils in humid and subhumid tropics, and
   are caused by large fertility improvement relative to the effects of
   competition. But, yield increases are rare in semiarid tropics and
   infertile acid soils because fertility improvement does not offset the
   large competitive effect of hedgerows with crops for water and/or
   nutrients. Whereas improved soil fertility and microclimate positively
   influence crop yields underneath the canopies of scattered trees in
   semiarid climates, intense shading caused by large, evergreen trees
   negatively affects the yields. Trees in boundary plantings compete with
   crops for above-and belowground resources, with belowground competition
   of trees often extending beyond their crown areas. The major biophysical
   interactions in improved planted fallows are improvement of soil
   nitrogen status and reduction of weeds in the fallow phase, and
   increased crop yields in the subsequent cropping phase. In such systems,
   the negative effects of competition and microclimate modification are
   avoided in the absence of direct tree-crop interactions.
   Future research on biophysical interactions should concentrate on (1)
   exploiting the diversity that exists within and between species of
   trees, (2) determining interactions between systems at different spatial
   (farm and landscape) and temporal scales, (3) improving understanding of
   belowground interactions, (4) assessing the environmental implications
   of agroforestry, particularly in the humid tropics, and (5) devising
   management schedules for agroforestry components in order to maximize
   benefits.},
