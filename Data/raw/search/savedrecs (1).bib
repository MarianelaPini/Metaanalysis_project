Abstract = {This study examines the sustained release behavior of both water-soluble
   (acetaminophen, caffeine, theophylline and salicylic acid) and
   water-insoluble ( indomethacin) drugs from Leucaena leucocephala seed
   Gum isolated from Leucaena leucocephala kernel powder. It further
   investigates the effect of incorporation of diluents like
   microcrystalline cellulose and lactose on release of caffeine and
   partial cross-linking of the gum (polysaccharide) on release of
   acetaminophen. Applying exponential equation, the mechanism of release
   of soluble drugs was found to be anomalous. The insoluble drug showed
   near case II or zero-order release mechanism. The rate of release was in
   the decreasing order of caffeine, acetaminophen, theophylline, salicylic
   acid and indomethacin. An increase in release kinetics of drug was
   observed on blending with diluents. However, the rate of release varied
   with type and amount of blend in the matrix. The mechanism of release
   due to effect of diluents was found to be anomalous. The rate of release
   of drug decreased on partial cross-linking and the mechanism of release
   was found to be super case II.},

Abstract = {The existence of mimosine in Leucaena leucocephala prevents the
   utilization of its biomass residues (after energy conversion) as animal
   feed. In this study, mimosine quantification in Leucaena leucocephala
   was carried out by using rapid colorimetric method. In addition, two
   different extraction methods which are soxhlet extraction with either
   distilled water or ethyl acetate as extraction solvent and digestion
   method were used to compare its efficiency in extracting the mimosine
   from Leucaena leucocephala leaves. The samples from both extraction
   methods were then clarified by boiling it with 30 mg activated carbon
   and filtered. The absorbance of diluted aliquot of 1-2-3-4-5 mL was then
   obtained from spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 535 nm. The
   concentration of mimosine from soxhlet extraction with distilled water
   was found to be higher compared to the digestion method but in contrast
   with ethyl acetate solvent extraction. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {Gum exudates from Leucaena Leucocephala (Family: Fabaceae) plants grown
   all over India were investigated for its physicochemical properties such
   as pH, swelling capacity and viscosities at different temperatures using
   standard methods. Leucaena Leucocephala bark gum appeared to be
   colorless to reddish brown translucent tears. 5 \% w/v mucilage has pH
   of 7.5 at 28 degrees C. The gum is slightly soluble in water and
   practically insoluble in ethanol, acetone and chloroform. It swells to
   about 5 times its original weight in water. A 5 \%w/v mucilage
   concentration gave a viscosity value which was unaffected at temperature
   ranges (28-40 degrees C). At concentrations of 2 and 5 \%w/v, the gum
   exhibited pseudo plastic flow pattern while at 10 \%w/v concentration
   the flow behaviour was thixotropic. The results indicate that the
   swelling ability of Leucaena Leucocephala (LL) bark gum may provide
   potentials for its use as a disintegrant in tablet formulation, as a
   hydro gel in modified release dosage forms and the rheological flow
   properties may also provide potentials for its use as suspending and
   emulsifying agents owing to its pseudo plastic and thixotropic flow
   patterns.},

Abstract = {Background: Leucaena leucocephala is native to Southern Mexico and
   Northern Central America, but is now naturalized throughout the tropics.
   The phyto-chemical data of L. leucocephala revealed the presence of
   terpenes, flavonoids, coumarins and sterols. Various parts of L.
   leucocephala have been reported to have medicinal properties.
   Materials and Methods: Flavonoids were isolated from the aerial parts of
   L. leucocephala. Antioxidant activity of the extracts and the isolated
   compounds was evaluated using (DPPH), as well as their cytotoxic
   activity using a single tumor {[}Ehrlish ascites carcinoma cells].
   Results: The flavonoidal constituents isolated from chloroform, ethyl
   acetate and n-butanol fractions of the aqueous alcoholic extract of
   aerial parts of Leucaena leucocephala were identified as Caffeic acid,
   Isorhamnetin, Chrysoeriol, Isorhamnetin 3-O-galactoside,
   Kaempferol-3-O-rubinoside, Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside and
   Luteolin-7-glucoside. Chemical structures of the isolated compounds were
   identified by TLC, PC and spectral techniques (UV, H-1 -NMR and MS). The
   ethyl acetate fraction and the isolated flavonoidal compounds showed
   high antioxidant activity compared to Trolox (standard antioxidant
   compound). The different fractions and isolated compounds of Leucaena
   leucocephala exhibited no cytotoxic activity against Ehrlich- ascitis
   carcinoma cell line at the tested concentrations.
   Conclusion: This is the first record of the flavonoids in the aerial
   parts of Leucaena leucocephala (L.) except Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside.},

Abstract = {Water contamination that caused by heavy metals is a very common
   phenomenon in the industrial age. One of the popular way to treat metal
   contaminated water is by adsorption process using activated carbon as
   the adsorbent. This paper works on producing activated carbon by
   chemical means with impregnation ratios of NaOH:char (w/w) was
   predetermined at 1:1 (ACT1-1), 2:1 (ACT2-1) and 3:1 (ACT3-1) under
   activation temperature of 700 degrees C. Considering the Leucaena
   leucocephala is a wildly, easy and fast grown species, with the
   availability throught the year, it was chosen to be used as the
   precursor. The properties of these activated carbons and its potential
   for cadmium removal from aqueus solution was analyzed. It was found that
   the highest surface area was recorded at 662.76 m(2)/g. Four parameters
   were studied which are contact time, the effect of pH, initial
   concentration of adsorbate and temperature. The equilibrium time was
   achieved in 40 min treatment at initial concentrations of 30 mg/l. The
   adsorbent exhibited good sorption potential for cadmium at pH 8.0 and

Abstract = {An experiment was carried out in a ferralitic rough sed soil (Acrisols)
   in order to study the establishment of leucaena in pastures of different
   grass especies. A random block design with 4 replications was used.
   Treatments were: intercropping Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru in Panicum
   maximum (guinea grass), Paspalum notatum (Paspalum) and Dichanthium
   annulatum (pitilla) pastures. The poor growth of leucaena in all
   treatments, 10 months after sowing appeared on intercropping in Paspalum
   with 141 cm of plant height and weight/plant of 30 g DM and 50
   leaves/plant, which differ (P < 0.05) from treatments with pitilla and
   guinea grass. The same situation appeared a year after the beginning of
   grazing when leucaena plants intercropped in pitilla and guinea grass
   had a higher growth (P < 0.01) than with Paspalum, 187 and 175 cm high,
   a weight/plant of 20.7 and 24.6 g DM and branches/plant of 13 and 21,
   respectively. The number of plants was only affected (P<0.01) in
   leucaena intercropped on Paspalum with less than 2 plant/clump and 2
   plants in linear m. The costs of preparing the soil and harvesting was
   \$63.54 in all treatments and represented 69.5\% of the expense. It is
   concluded that the type of graminae determines the establishment of
   leucaena. Furthermore, the growth control of the accompanying grass,
   together with the soil preparation, an the components determining the
   establishment costs of Leucaena and it is not advisable to intercrop

Abstract = {Six experiments were carried out for 3 years to study weed control

   and the combination of these methods. One control was unweeded and
   another one weeded with a hoe. Another group of theatments studied the

   the plants that remained unweeded showed the poorest development (P <
   0,001): height (19 cm), number of leaves and branches per plant (4 and
   1). The plants receiving pre-emergent herbicide application (Treflan
   0,75 litres/ha a. s.) and subsequently a minimum tillage after sowing,
   until 60 or 80 days were similar to the plants which were weeded during

   carbons increased with increasing KOH/char ratio and activation time.
   Overgasification induced a substantial amount of mesopores in the
   activated carbons. In addition, the electrochemical properties and CDI
   electrosorptive performance of the activated carbons were evaluated;
   cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements
   revealed a typical capacitive behavior and electrical double layer

Abstract = {This study explores the development of urea-functionalized hydrochar
   from Leucaena leucocephala wood (LW) for CO2 capture. Hydrochar was
   produced via hydrothermal carbonization at 170 degrees C for 90 min and
   subsequently functionalized with urea. The effects of urea: hydrochar
   ratio (1:1 to 3:1), activation temperature (400-800 degrees C), and
   heating rate (5-15 degrees C/min) on CO2 adsorption capacity were
   investigated. Optimal conditions (2:1 urea: hydrochar ratio, 600 degrees
   C activation temperature, 5 degrees C/min heating rate) increased CO2
   adsorption capacity from 13.09 mg/g to 76.20 mg/g. The modified
   adsorbent demonstrated high affinity towards CO2 over N-2, CH4, and O-2,
   and maintained performance over 11 adsorption-desorption cycles. Kinetic
   studies revealed physisorption as the primary adsorption mechanism. In
   fixed-bed column tests, best performing conditions within the tested
   ranges (30 ml/min flow rate, 15\% CO2 concentration, 30 degrees C)
   yielded a CO2 uptake of 195.54 mg/g. This study demonstrates the

Abstract = {Our work concerned the optimization of inoculation of two agroforestry
   species of woody leguminous plants: Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia
   mangium with various strains of rhizobium. First, we showed that the
   physiological stage of the bacterial culture had no effect on nodulation
   and growth of the seedlings of Acacia mangium inoculated and cultivated
   in vitro for four months. For Leucaena leucocephala, the number of
   nodules was significantly higher when the seedlings were inoculated with
   a bacterial culture in stationary phase. On the other hand, whatever the
   species, no significant difference was noted with regards to the dry
   weight of the shoots. The effect of the size of inoculum on the
   nodulation and growth of the seedlings was studied in L. leucocephala
   after five months in a greenhouse. Our result show that an inoculation
   with bacterial cultures containing 10(9) to 10(10) bacteria per
   milliliter are the optimal conditions to have a maximum nodulation and
   growth of the seedlings. The two legume plant species showed significant
   differences with regard to the effect of the method of inoculation on
   nodulation and growth of the seedlings. For Acacia mangium, inoculation
   with a liquid culture one week after sowing was more favourable for the
   growth of the seedlings. On the other hand, for Leucaena leucocephala,
   this method of inoculation and the coating of seeds with a bacterial
   culture mixed with arabic gum improved significantly the growth of the
   seedlings. Results obtained in our study can be useful for the partners

Abstract = {Mimosine is a non-protein amino acid found in the forage legume Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, which is toxic to animals, has alellopathic
   effects and is an inhibitor of cell division with potential
   pharmacological applications. The regulation of mimosine accumulation in
   seedlings of L. leucocephala during early development, in different
   parts of seedlings and in response to various chemical and physical
   factors was examined. Mimosine was extracted in acid, purified by paper
   chromatography, and quantified spectro photometrically through the
   reaction with p-nitroaniline. The highest mimosine content was found in
   the shoots. In etiolated seedlings exposed to light, there was an
   initial promotion of mimosine accumulation, followed by a reduction of
   the amount of the amino acid. Seedlings grown under light and
   transferred to dark had relatively more stable contents of mimosine. The
   amount of mimosine was increased locally by mechanical damage applied to
   shoots. Salicylic acid in culture media stimulated mimosine accumulation
   in roots. During early germination and axillary bud activation for
   plantlet formation, there was a significant reduction in mimosine
   content. The overall results indicate that the accumulation of mimosine
   is regulated by ontogenesis and environmental factors. This suggests
   that mimosine has adaptive roles. such as an ecochemical agent and a
   nutritional reserve source. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All

   when goats had access to commercial concentrate or browsing leucaena as
   well as grass pasture compared with the control treatment. Daily milk
   yield in goats with access to leucaena was insignificantly different
   than goats on concentrate. Treatments did not affect milk composition.
   The daily growth rate of goats was significantly higher in concentrate
   (50.5 g) or leucaena (48.4 g) compared to grazing pasture (35.8 g). The
   results suggest that Leucaena leucocephala can supply an adequate amount
   of nutrients with similar value to commercial concentrate for growth and
   milk production without adverse effects on tropical grazing goats.},

Abstract = {An ion-exchange chromatography method was developed for the quantitative
   determination of mimosine in leaves of Leucaena Leucocephala. The sample
   treatment processor were optimized, as a result, the conditions of
   extract mimosine were confirmed as the concentration of HCl 0.5 mol.L-1,
   temperature 30 degrees C, 20 min. The chromatograph conditions were: the
   injection volume 20 mu L, detection wavelength 570 nm, the
   chromatography column the spherical ion-exchange column (\#2622SC,
   Japan), the mobile phase consisted of 5 species of (B-1-B-5) buffer
   solutions, derivation solution consisted of 3 species of ninhydrin and
   its buffer solutions (R-1-R-3). The gradient elution was adopted,
   B-2-B-5 were used with buffer changes after 3.1, 7.1, 14.9, 29.1 min. A
   flow-rate of B-1-B-5 of 0.400 mL. min(-1) and R-1-R-3 of 0.350 mL.
   min(-1) were maintained throughout the analysis. The linearity is
   favorable in the range of 0.478 ng.mu L-1 to 28.677 ng.mu L-1 with a
   correlation coefficient of 0.998. Under the optimal conditions, the
   method limit of detection (LOD) of mimosine was 0.478 mg/g. The recovery
   of mimosine was 84.47-92.52\% with the RSD (n= 4) of 1.36-3.20\% in the
   spiked levels 0, 6, 12, 18 mg/g. The method was found to be simple,
   sensitive and accurate, and it was suitable for the determination of
   mimosine and amino acid in Leaves of Leucaena leucocephala in same
   sequence under different sample treatment processor.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of an investigation to determine the
   potential of Leucaena leucocephala as a commercial energy crop for
   dendro-power generation plants. Dendro-power generation is the
   generation of electricity from wood fuels. Modern technology enables the
   efficient, clean and long-term use of wood in dendro power plants.
   Various tests and calculations have been carried out, such as moisture
   content, physical analysis and calorific value of tree species. The
   Leucaena leucocephala yield per unit area of the special plantation for
   the development of 10 MW dendro power plants was estimated. The
   development of a 10 MW dendro power plant provides for an annual
   electricity generation of 50 GWh, which can be used for self-consumption
   or sold to a power company. This study provides a quantitative approach
   to estimating the wood requirements for Dendro power generation which
   has not been done before. From the calculation, the annual fuel
   consumption of the Dendro power plant requires 48,880 tons/year.
   Therefore, the total area required for planting the energy plant
   Leucaena leucocephala is 815 hectares. The number of Leucaena
   leucocephala trees required to meet the annual fuel consumption of the
   Dendro power plant is 4,075,000 trees. The implementation of this
   project will also help the economic development of local communities,
   especially in rural areas.},

Abstract = {Heavy metal contamination in water is happening worldwide. Adsorption
   using activated carbon is a common choice for cleaning the wastewater.
   The drawback of activated carbon is the higher cost of production due to
   the need for high heat in the process. This work investigated on
   activated carbon produced from the abundantly available Leucaena
   leucocephala biomass in order to reduce the cost of raw material. The
   biomass was chemically activated at different activation temperatures.
   The produced activated carbon was characterized using SEM, FT-IR,
   surface analyzer, and TGA. Isothermic and thermodynamic studies were
   done to evaluate the adsorption properties of the activated carbon. It
   was found out that higher surface area can be obtained using the higher
   activation temperature. Higher NaOH to carbonized sample ratios also
   resulted in higher surface area for all activation temperatures, which
   are 662 m(2)g(-1) for 700 degrees C activation temperature, 735
   m(2)g(-1) for 750 degrees C, and 776 m(2)g(-1) for 800 degrees C.
   Isothermic studies showed that all of the activated carbon that is
   produced from Leucaena leucocephala biomass are fit to the Langmuir
   isotherm, regardless of any activation temperature. Lastly, the
   thermodynamic study found out the adsorption process is endothermic,
   reflected by the positive value of Delta H-o. It can be concluded that
   Leucaena leucocephala is a promising alternative material for producing
   activated carbon.},

Abstract = {River tamarind or scientifically Leucaena leucocephala, is one of the
   underutilized nanocellulose resources with the potential to be used in
   reinforcement materials. This work evaluated the use of the insoluble
   residual waste or marc obtained during the isolation of galactomannan
   from Leucaena leucocephala seed (LLS) as a feedstock of cellulose to
   obtain cellulose nanocrystals by a two-step acid hydrolysis followed by
   its characterization and morphological study. The first step involved
   acid hydrolyzation of the hemicellulose and lignin from LLS, while the
   second step dealt with the removal of the amorphous region to produce
   crystalline LLS nanocrystals (NLLS). The physicochemical properties of
   nanocrystals were characterized using the Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy
   (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), particle size analyzer
   (PSA), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA),
   and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The NLLS isolated showed a
   rod-like structure in the range of 709-0nm in diameter with a
   crystallinity index of 76\% and thermal stability at 264 degrees C. PSA
   indicates that 97.5\% of the size distribution of NLLS was below
   136.9nm. GPC analysis also revealed that the sulphuric acid
   hydrolyzation during the second step caused a reduction in the molecular
   weight due to the cleaving of glycosidic bonds in the structure. These
   results indicated that LLS waste is a potential feedstock for cellulose
   nanocrystals preparation. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by IASE.},

Abstract = {To address international food security concerns and sustain a growing
   global population, global agricultural output needs to increase by 70\%
   by the year 2050. Current agricultural techniques to increase crop
   yields, specifically the application of chemicals, have resulted in a
   wide range of negative impacts on the environment and human health. The
   maintenance of good quality soil organic matter, a key concern in
   tropical countries such as India, requires a steady input of organic
   residues to maintain soil fertility. A tree with many uses, Leucaena
   leucocephala, has attracted much attention over the past decades. As per
   our literature review, no research has been conducted examining Leucaena
   leucocephala leaves for their fungal decomposition and their use as
   green manure. A study of the fungal colonization of Leucaena
   leucocephala leaves at various stages of decomposition was conducted to
   get an insight into which fungi play a critical role in the
   decomposition process. In total, fifty-two different species of fungi
   were isolated. There was an increase in the percentage of fungus
   occurrences as the leaves senesced and then finally decomposed. Almost
   all decomposition stages were characterized by a higher percentage
   occurrence of Deuteromycetes (75.47\%) and by a lower rate of
   Ascomycetes (9.43\%). A gradual increase of basidiomycetes such as
   unidentified sclerotia and Rhizoctonia solani was seen as the leaves
   senesced and finally decomposed. In the moist chamber, Didymium nigripes
   was the only Myxomycete isolated from completely decomposed leaves. In
   the present study, on average, there were more fungi in wet seasons than
   in the dry seasons.},

Abstract = {The economical possibility of using legumes in pastures for cattle
   fattening was assessed in the Institute of Animal Science (ICA) in the
   grazing of a) natural pasture with Leucaena leucocephala in 30 and 100\%
   of the area and ground sugarcane-urea at 1\% (three treatments), and b)
   star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) with leucaena in 100 \% of the area and
   the inclusion or not of rumen activator supplement (two treatments). The
   cost components were determined for each system considering the fixed
   and variable costs involved in the fattening and the economic indicators
   (cost/kg of liveweight, cost/\$ invested, and the ratio benefit/cost)
   were calculated evaluating them statistically through simple
   classification models. The percent distribution of the direct expenses
   was analyzed, compared to the total expenses. The financial analysis
   included the calculation of the gross margin/ha and the economic
   profitability. The American dollar (USD) was used as monetary pattern.
   The beneficial effect of the use of leucaena on the feeding costs was
   proved by not surpassing 16 \% of the variables expenses in any of the
   systems and by the favorable performance of the economic indicators (P <
   0.01), although lower for the system supplemented with rumen activator.
   The study of the financial indicators corroborated the economic
   possibilities of this legume, mainly in 100\% of the area, with economic
   profitability higher than 50 \%, and disputed the viability of the use
   of the activator supplement in these conditions. The results indicate
   the economic feasibility of the use of Leucaena leucocephala in 100 \%
   of the grazing area in traditional growing-fattening systems with
   natural grasses or sugarcane-urea for the obtainment of liveweight gains
   between 600 and 800 g/d.},

   absolute and relative weights of testis and seminal vesicle but not of
   epididymis plus vas deferens. Significantly, mimosine at doses of 30,

   seminiferous atrophy and degeneration were obviously found in mimosine
   treated mice as compared to the control. In conclusion, consumption of
   Leucaena leucocephala edible parts containing mimosine could damage male
   reproductive organs which may cause acute male subfertility or

   medium containing different concentrations of N-6-benzyladenine (BA),
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and naphthaleneacetic acid

   concentrations of the growth regulators. Shoots were generated only from
   the friable calli formed from the cotyledon explants. The calli formed
   from the hypocotyl explants did not generate shoots and the root
   explants died without forming callus. Cotyledon explants from 3-4 day
   old seedlings showed maximum callus induction compared to those from
   older seedlings. In a second method involving direct organogenesis,
   excised cotyledons were cultured on 1/2 MS medium containing 10-35 mg
   l(-1) N-6-benzy-ladenine (BA) for 7-14 days. Transfer of the cotyledons
   to regeneration medium containing low BA resulted in callus formation
   and subsequent shoot regeneration from the base of the excised cotyledon
   explants, with up to 100\% frequency. Regenerated shoots rooted best on
   a basal medium containing no growth regulators.},

Abstract = {The present world faces critical issues such as global warming,
   sea-level rise, and drastic change in the climate pattern due to the
   emission of greenhouse gases. Large-scale use and disposal of hazardous
   plastics contribute significantly to the present scenario and it becomes
   essential to use naturally derived materials for making plastics.
   Natural fibers were found to possess the inherent characteristics
   required for reinforcing the polymer. In this work, one such novel
   cellulosic fiber derived from the bast of Leucaena leucocephala was
   identified and characterized using tests such as chemical, tensile,
   X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
   Thermogravimetric, Differential scanning calorimetry, Energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy, and Field emission scanning electron microscopy. The
   presence of high cellulose (59.03 wt.\%) with high crystallinity index
   (63.10\%) contributes to high tensile strength(415-693 MPa) and high
   tensile modulus (9.90-13.10 GPa) of the Leucaena leucocephala fiber
   (LLF). From thermogravimetric analysis, LLF was observed to be thermally
   stable up to 188.20 degrees C and activation energy of 64.22 kJ/mol. The
   morphological analysis of LLF revealed the existence of honeycombed
   porous surface characterized with serrations, and this facilitates
   better bonding characteristics with polymer. Lower density, mechanical
   properties, and better thermal stability make LLF a suitable alternate
   for synthetic fibers while making composites.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the potential pollinators, floral visitors and
   predators of the Leucaena leucocephala. Monitoring of the standardized
   number of flowers was done at specified time interval, and the number of
   predators was also counted at standardized time interval and the data
   collected were analyzed and tested using F-test. There was a positive
   relationship on the floral visitors and individual probing flowers
   (P<0.05) however the difference between visitation and probing rate was
   insignificant (P>0.05). The predation had positive correlation with
   probing while having negative relation with visitation. The relationship
   between the visitation and probing suggests that, there is a need to
   conserve the pollinators in integrated approach by considering other
   species. This will benefit not only Leucaena leucocephala but also other
   plant species in the restored sites. Further studies should be done to
   determine the impact of predators other than dragonflies on the
   pollination and seed setting.},

Abstract = {The world is facing serious threat due to global warming. Several
   measures have been proposed and the cost effective solution will be the
   ``Tree Plantation{''}. However, each tree has its own CO2 absorption
   rate and growth. Based on the literature review, Leucaena leucocephala
   plant has the highest CO2 absorption rate and higher rate of growth.
   Also it is a tropical tree which can be grown in waste land in rural
   areas. The tree has multiple benefits like its leaves being used as
   fodder and the stern as fire wood. In India 1,00,000 hectares of land
   has this plantation and it yields 12,000 MT of biomass per year. It has
   been found that 30\% oil yield can be obtained from the seeds. This oil
   has a calorific value of 39 MJ/kg which can replace the fossil fuel
   consumption. However, the present research work identified another route
   for bio-oil production from the seeds. The present work attempted to
   utilize the seeds of Leucaena leucocephala for bio-oil production.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the main clinical changes of natural and
   experimentally poisoning by Leucaena leucocephala in horses. Outbreaks
   of poisoning occurred in Sao Paulo and Goios States, where six horses
   after ingestion of bark and/or leaves of the plant showed alopecia
   mainly in mane and tail. The diagnosis was based on the observation of
   plant intake and clinical signs. In horses experimentally poisoned,
   clinical examination was performed and skin biopsies were taken from
   mane, back and tail regions, and triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine
   (T4) serum levels were assayed. Alopecia in mane and tail was the main
   clinical sign, accompanied by anorexia, weight loss and lethargy in all
   horses. T3 and total T4 showed significant decrease in serum levels (p
   <= 0.05) in the third week of leucaena intake compared with baseline
   levels. Marked telogenization of hair follicles at the end of the
   experiments were observed in skin biopsies. The clinical and
   pathological findings in poisoned horses are similar to those observed
   in ruminants. Experimental poisoning of horses by the plant highlights
   the marked decline in levels of thyroid hormones, suggesting goitrogenic
   effect of mimosine and its derived compounds, with transient
   hypothyroidism and alopecia due to accentuated reduction in follicular
   activity.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit is a fast-growing tree species often
   used as lead (shade) tree that can be cultivated in Malaysia. This
   species has potential as an alternative resource for the Malaysian
   furniture and panel board industries in the coming years because of a
   shortage of the current frequently used raw material (rubberwood). A
   study on growth performance and potential as particleboard resource
   material was done. In terms of growth performance, the preliminary study
   indicated that Leucaena trees grew at a rate of 44\% from the first
   month to the forth month and 43\% from 6 to 12 months. As for
   particleboard manufacturing, Leucaena: Rubberwood admixture bound with
   urea formaldehyde (8\%, 10 \% and 12\% resin content) to a density of
   700 kg/m(3), showed promise of usability when all boards pass the Type
   P2 board requirement of EN312:2010. In general, L. leucocephala wood is

   optimized using 2-factor, 3-level central composite experimental design.
   The optimized nanoparticles were characterized by FTIR, DSC, SEM, TEM
   and XRD studies. The results of in vitro release studies and ex vivo
   transcorneal permeation studies revealed sustained release and higher
   corneal permeation as compared to conventional formulation of DRZ. The
   optimized nanoparticles were found to reduce the intra ocular pressure

   dominated by glycoside hydrolases followed by carbohydrate esterase and
   other oxidative enzymes. EPS was further characterized by FTIR and GC-MS
   for functional group, monomer composition and linkage analysis and was
   identified as schizophyllan. The result indicated that LLW can be

Abstract = {The response of Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru to inoculation with
   native isolates of Rhizobium and commercial Rhizobium strains was
   studied under salt stress. The study was carried out under semi
   controlled conditions in greenhouse as well as under field conditions.
   The effect of three Rhizobium strains (JD 15, JD 16 and 4033) were
   compared to a control (without inoculation and without fertilization)
   and a mineral N fertilization treatment. Under semi controlled
   conditions, the best results for yields and nitrogen fixation parameters
   were found for the native strain of Rhizobium (JD15). In this treatment
   - together with the N fertilizer treatment - the highest root and shoot
   weights and N uptakes were found. Furthermore, the JD 15 treatment
   showed the highest K:Na ratio, the highest ureide contents, highest
   values of chlorophyll a and b in the shoot, and the best index of
   inoculation effectiveness. In the field experiment the development of
   Leucaena was poor. Nevertheless, the JD 15 treatment had positive
   effects fielding comparison to other treatment groups. It is suggested
   to study the effect of inoculations with other types of Leucaena adapted
   to salt stress under field conditions.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (LAM.) DE WIT. is a multi-purpose neotropical
   tree, with a long history of human use, which is now distributed
   pantropically. The level of genetic variability within and among 24
   populations of L. leucocephala has been assessed using isozyme analysis
   (324 plants; 12 populations) and restriction analyses (23 populations)
   of the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA). In a
   survey of three isozyme systems (AAT; PER; PGI) multi-enzyme phenotypes
   were encountered such that it was possible to identify the two
   subspecies of L. leucocephala and inter-population differentiation.
   Partitioning of phenotypic diversity within and among populations
   revealed that 76\% of the variation resided among L. leucocephala
   populations. Evidence of either multiple introductions or
   hybridisation/introgression was found in a Haitian collection. Seven
   restriction fragments showed cpDNA variation and Evidence for between 1
   and 5 rDNA repeats per population was encountered. These results are
   discussed in relation to the utilization of L. leucocephala as a
   multi-purpose tree crop.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this text is to provide a long-term record of occurrences
   of the species Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. in the Brazilian
   territory, in order to (i) determine if its introduction occurred before
   the earliest official record, (ii) identify points of occurrence in
   Brazil, and (iii) assess its status as a useful although invasive plant.
   The text is partly based on research done on the confirmed presence of
   this plant in the Brasilia National Park, located in Brazil's Federal
   District. Three databases available on the Internet containing
   information from several herbariums were accessed to obtain the location
   and the dates of the relevant records of the plant in Brazilian
   territory. We found that the species was rather widely present in the
   Brazilian territory before the official record of its earliest
   introduction. In addition, we found that the plant's current geographic
   distribution indicates that it continues to have a strong invasive
   potential in Brazil, especially because there are social and technical
   incentives to cultivate it in rural properties.},

Abstract = {Environmental contamination with Cadmium (Cd) is of great concern due to
   its hazardous effects on living organisms.Query In the present research,
   Leucaena leucocephala plants were exposed to Cd concentrations of 5, 10,
   and 15 mg/L to determine their potential use in Cd remediation.
   Different parameters including Cd uptake, macro/micronutrient content,
   chlorophyl, and catalase production were determined. Results indicated
   that Cd uptake by L. leucocephala roots did not show a significant
   difference between treatments. However, a significant increase in Cd
   content (Tukey ` s HSD) was observed in stems as Cd levels in the media
   augmented. The highest Cd content (830 +/- 20 mg/kg) was determined in
   stems of plants exposed to 15 mg/L Cd, and no Cd was detected in leaves.
   Data showed that as Cd concentration increased in the media, Ca, Mg, K,
   Zn, and Mn decreased. Moreover, while the presence of Cd reduced
   catalase activity in roots, chlorophyll production was not affected.},

Abstract = {The potential of Leucaena leucocephala as an erosion control plant was
   investigated in terms of its capacity of root reinforcement, root
   profile and root shear strength. The species studied exhibited
   extensive, dense rooting and depth of penetration. These aspects, to
   some extent, could provide surficial as well as deep-seated erosion
   control. A high water absorption capacity would increase suction, thus
   potentially extracting water at the greater depth. The soil-root matrix
   significantly affects cohesion factor but not the angle of friction. The
   effect varies with increasing depth and age of plant depending on the
   root length density. After 6 months of growth, the cohesion factor had
   tremendously increased by two- to five-fold (0.1-0.5 m soil depth). This
   range almost reached the values of those in the 12-month treatment,
   indicating a high contribution of the root system to soil-root
   reinforcement. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The fabrication of single patch antenna for proposed Leucaena
   Leucocephala ({''}Petai Belalang{''}) Wood Plastic Composite (WPC)
   substrate board and FR4 substrate board is presented in this paper. The
   experiment objective was to measure the performance of an antenna
   fabricated on the proposed board by comparing the performance in term of
   Dielectric Constant value, Tangent Loss value, Return Loss, Radiation
   Pattern and Gain with antenna fabricated onto FR4 material substrate
   board. The idea is to find the potential alternative board replacing
   conventional printed circuit board (PCB) using commercial FR4 material.
   The dielectric constant and tangent loss value for both proposed and FR4
   substrate board were analyzed with Agilent 85070E Dielectric Probe Kit
   method. The Fabricated proposed boards were studied in the frequency
   range of 2.2 to 3.3 GHz since this board will be used in ISM band
   application that occupied 2.45 GHz frequency spectrum. The parameter
   composition of proposed board on this paper was focused only on one
   density composition that is 70\% of polypropylene and 30\% of leucaena
   leucocephala filler wood with particle size maintained at 150 mu M and
   moisture content of the filler is less than 5\%. The indoor Practical
   Antenna Measurement method was used to prove the proposed antenna can be
   used as transmitting antenna and all result obtained were form as data
   and graph analysis.},

Abstract = {A Leucaena leucocephala variety was pulped with the soda anthraquinone
   process to obtain a liquid fraction for use as an energy source. To this

   fractions for energy production. This aim was accomplished by using a
   hydrolysis treatment before pulping. Both the pretreatment and the
   pulping process were optimized with a view to obtaining the best
   possible pulp properties and renewable energy from the black liquor, and
   the results were compared with those obtained in the absence of prior
   hydrolysis.
   Alkaline (soda anthraquinone) cooking of the hydrolysis solid residue
   provided cellulose pulp and energy from black liquor at least as
   efficiently as without autohydrolysis and with the added advantage of
   using milder delignification conditions. Up to 46.6\% of hemicellulose

   low concentration level (2\% w/w), can be used as a disintegrant in
   tablet dosage form containing water-insoluble drug. In contrast to maize
   starch, LSG swells rapidly when brought in the contact with water, while
   preventing the liquid uptake in cylindrical column of powder. This
   presumably suggests that initial swelling of LSG particles generates
   enough pressure to elicit disintegration action in the tablet before
   further liquid uptake results in formation of mucilaginous, gel like
   coherent mass, which hinders further movement of water into the tablet
   matrix.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala, an invasive toxic tree species, has threatened
   Due to the small-to-medium diameter, the utilization and processing of
   L. leucocephala is highly restricted, while its discarding accelerates
   carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere. Biochar, produced from the
   pyrolysis of biomass under an inert atmosphere, is considered an
   effective carbon sequestration technique with high stability, which is
   important for long-term carbon storage and soil improvement. L.
   leucocephala biomass and montmorillonite were co-pyrolyzed under inert
   conditions, aiming to investigate the effects of different pyrolysis
   temperatures and montmorillonite blending ratios on biochar yield and
   carbon retention. Results showed improved biochar yield and carbon
   retention with increasing montmorillonite addition. Thermogravimetric
   analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform
   infrared spectroscopy demonstrated enhanced stability of the modified
   biochars. The production of modified L. leucocephala biochar represents
   a promising technique for carbon dioxide sequestration and biochar
   stabilization, enabling the development of L. leucocephala utilization

Abstract = {Four Thai-rumen fistulated swamp buffaloes male (Bubalus bubalis), about
   3 years old with 360 +/- 18 kg liveweight were assigned according to a
   2x2 factorial arrangement in a 4x4 Latin square design to receive
   dietary treatments. The treatments were as follows: T1) level of
   concentrate at 0.1\% BW with Leucaena leucocephala Leaf Meal (LLLM) at
   300 g/hd/day; T2) concentrate at 0.2\% BW with LLLM at 300 g/hd/day; T3)
   concentrate at 0.1\% BW with heated Leucaena leucocephala Leaf Meal
   (HLLLM) at 300 g/hd/day and T4) concentrate at 0.2\% BW with HLLLM at
   300 g/hd/day. The results revealed a significant increase in roughage
   and total DM intake (p<0.05) by concentrate level at 0.2\% BW (T2 and
   T4) as compared with concentrate level at 0.1\% BW (T1 and T3).
   Digestion coefficient (\%) of DM, OM and CP were increased by level of
   concentrate at 0.2\% BW while NDF and ADF were similar among treatments.
   However, there was no effect of neither energy level nor HLLLM on
   ruminal pH and temperature (p>0.05). Concentration of ruminal NH3-N was
   decreased by HLLLM as compared with LLLM (p<0.05) while blood
   urea-nitrogen was not changed and was in normal range. Total bacterial
   direct counts were found significantly different (p<0.05) whereas fungi
   zoospores and protozoal populations were similar among treatments.
   Nevertheless, viable bacterial counts were found affected by both
   concentrate level and HLLLM. The treatments with HLLLM were lower than
   those in LLLM and concentrate level at 0.2\% BW were higher than those
   supplemented at 0.1\% (p<0.05). Based on this study, it could be
   concluded that HLLLM could be used as a protein source in terms of rumen
   undegradable protein while the combination of HLLLM and concentrate
   level at 0.2\% of BW could enhance the voluntary feed intake, nutrient
   digestibility, rumen fermentation and ecology in swamp buffalo fed

Abstract = {Optimization of oil extraction from Leucaena leucocephala seeds (LLS)
   using solvent method was studied. 2(k) factorial technique was employed
   for optimization of extraction process variables, which include particle

   Good agreements were achieved between the predicted and experimental
   values of oil extraction yield (R-2 = 0.9974 and Adj-R-2 = 0.9922).
   Optimization results showed that maximum oil extraction efficiency was
   achieved under the optimized factor combination of <= 0.6 mm particle
   size, 50 degrees C extraction temperature, 2 h extraction time and 10:1
   v/w solvent/solid ratio.},

   Dry matter yields were highest at the 75 and 100 cm cutting heights,
   especially at the longer, three-monthly, cutting interval.  They were
   significantly reduced by more frequent cutting, probably due to the
   increased number of recovery phases.
   Leaf nitrogen yields per tree for trees cut at three-monthly intervals
   were over twice as high as the total yields obtained from monthly

Journal = {MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {200},

Abstract = {Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala L.) is a leguminous species often
   referred to as the ``miracle tree,{''} it provides numerous ecosystem
   services and exhibits robust ecological characteristics. However, the
   infection caused by phytopathogenic fungi is poorly understood in
   Subabul. Therefore, this study provides comprehensive insights into the
   molecular and genomic characteristics of Fusarium falciforme, the causal
   agent of wilt disease in Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala). Pathogen
   isolation from infected samples, followed by morpho-molecular
   characterization through DNA sequencing of key markers (ITS, LSU, TEF1
   alpha) and phylogenetic analysis, confirmed the identity of F.
   falciforme. Host range analysis demonstrated the pathogen's ability to
   infect additional leguminous crops, including chickpea (Cicer arietinum)
   and soybean (Glycine max). A complete genome assembly revealed a genome
   size of 59.19 Mb, comprising 18,853 protein-coding genes. Comparative
   genomic analysis elucidated evolutionary relationships with other
   Fusarium species, while functional annotation identified critical
   virulence factors, such as polyketide synthases, ABC transporters, and
   secretory proteins, which facilitate host tissue invasion. These
   findings enhance the understanding of F. falciforme pathogenicity,
   enabling improved diagnostic tools and management strategies for
   controlling wilt disease in Subabul and related legumes.},

Abstract = {The effect of the fungicide, chlorothalonil, on vesicular-arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (VAM) symbiosis was studied in a greenhouse using Leucaena
   leucocephala as test plant.  Chlorothalonil was applied to soil at 0,
   50, 100 and 200-mu-g g-1.  The initial soil solution P levels were
   0.003-mu-g mL-1 (sub-optimal) and 0.026-mu-g mL-1 (optimal).  After 4
   weeks, the sub-optimal P level was raised to 0.6 mu-g mL-1 (high).  The
   soil was either uninoculated or inoculated with the VAM fungus, Glomus
   aggregatum.  The fungicide reduced mycorrhizal colonization of roots,
   development of mycorrhizal effectiveness, shoot P concentration and
   uptake and dry matter yields at all concentrations tested, although the
   highest inhibitory effect was noted as the concentration of the
   fungicide was increased from 50 to 100-mu-g g-1.  Phosphorus applied
   after four weeks tended to partially offset the deleterious effects of
   chlorothalonil in plants grown in the inoculated and uninoculated soil
   which suggests that the fungicide was interfering with plant P uptake. 
   The results suggest that the use of chlorothalonil should be restricted
   to levels below 50-mu-g g-1 if the benefits of mycorrhizal symbiosis are
   to be expected.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is a nitrogen-fixing tropical leguminous tree that

   flowers, pods, seeds, and roots, and it is one of the principal
   non-protein amino acids that occurs in all organs. Asparagine was the
   most abundant amino acid in flowers. The mimosine content varied from
   3.3 mu mol/g fresh weight (FW) in developing flowers to 171 mu mol/g FW
   in mature seeds. Trigonelline was also detected in leaves, flowers,
   pods, and seeds, but not roots. The trigonelline content was lower than
   that of mimosine in all organs. It varied from 0.12 mu mol/g FW in
   developing seeds to 2.6 mu mol/g FW in mature seeds. {[}2-C-14]Nicotinic
   acid supplied to the developing seeds was incorporated into trigonelline
   but not mimosine. This indicates that the pyridine and dihydroxypyridine

   at 50 mg / mL inhibited the eggs hatching of nematode (20\%) and at 6.25
   mg/mL killed 22\% of the larvae of nematodes (L3). The hydroalcoholic
   extract of LLP contains active metabolites that act in inhibition eggs
   hatching on field nematodes and on infective L3. The hydroalcoholic
   extract of LLP can be an unconventional alternative for the prevention

   A study was carried out on the population dynamics of this whitefly on

   peak (121.58 and 134.83 adults per two leaves) in September. The spatial
   distribution pattern revealed that it is always an aggregated dispersion
   (Taylor's Power Law) in all the strata but more aggregation in the
   middle leaves (b = 3.123). Linear association between population and
   weather factors revealed that maximum and minimum temperature had a
   significant positive correlation (r = 0.60, 0.54). The sex ratio in the
   field varied from 1: 1.9 to 1: 4.9 (male: female). The present
   observations indicate that incidence of B. tabaci on L. leucocephala, is
   an adaptation to a suitable host so as to survive during the winter

Abstract = {In this work, Leucaena leucocephala K366 was characterized chemical and
   energy terms, and assessed its potential as a lignocellulosic raw
   material and energetic and industrial crop specie, and its integral
   fractionation by autohydrolysis by evaluating its calorific value,
   holocellulose, glucan, xylan, arabinan, lignin and oligomers and
   monomers contents in autohydrolysis liquor and solid phase. Also, this
   paper will consider the influence of the temperature and time of
   autohydrolysis process from L. leucocephala K366 to obtain valuable
   liquor and a suitable solid phase to produce energy by combustion.
   Valuable liquor was obtained from the autohydrolysis of L. leucocephala
   by simultaneously using operating temperatures and times in the medium
   high ranges studied, namely: 172-184 degrees C and 15-30 min. The
   optimum processing conditions provided an acceptable yield (16-26\%),
   and high xylose and xylo-oligomer contents in the liquor (10.0 and
   58.6\%, respectively, of the amounts present in the starting raw
   material when operating at 184 C for 30 min) in comparison with other
   raw materials. The arabinan fraction was extracted virtually completely
   -only 8.3\% remained in the solid fraction, and the acetyl group
   fraction was recovered in full. In addition, these conditions reduced
   the glucose content of the liquor to 2.9\% of the amount present in the
   raw material while largely preserving the integrity of cellulose fibers.
   Klason lignin was scarcely dissolved under the operating conditions of
   the autohydrolysis process. This increased the calorific value of the
   solid phase by 9\% (under the most drastic operating conditions) with
   respect to the starting raw material. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Lectins are a specialized group of proteins with immense biological
   properties and applications. This study describes the purification and
   characterization of a lectin from Leucaena leucocephala seeds, a plant
   belonging to the Fabaceae family. Leucaena leucocephala lectin (LLL) was
   purified by a two-step purification method involving DEAE-cellulose
   anion exchange chromatography and Sephadex G-75 size exclusion
   chromatography. The isolated lectin displayed a high haemagglutination
   titre upon treatment with rabbit erythrocytes. SDS-PAGE and
   Reverse-Phase High performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis
   experimentally revealed the presence of three bands corresponding to 37,
   27 and 20 kDa indicating the presence of isolectins. Periodic Acid
   Schiff's (PAS) staining of LLL confirmed the presence of glycoprotein.
   Various biochemical parameters were analysed to study its effect on the
   haemagglutination activity. Sugar inhibition studies experimentally
   revealed that Glucose was the most potent inhibitor. Fluorescence
   spectrometric analysis of LLL and Glucose indicated a strong interaction
   with an association constant of 0.159 x 10(3) M-1. Circular Dichroism
   spectroscopy indicated a higher alpha helical content (25.27\%). LLL was
   observed to possess mitogenic activity against Peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMC). The present investigation reports the

Abstract = {The study assessed the value of Leucaena leucocephala bark in
   leucaena-grass hay diets fed to Thai goats. Thai goats in metabolism
   pens were fed diets containing leucaena leaf (55\%) + pangola grass hay
   (hay, 45\%); leucaena leaf (48\%) + leucaena bark (9\%) + hay (43\%);
   leucaena bark (57\%) + hay (43\%); and hay only. Feed percentages are
   expressed on a dry weight basis. The digestibilities of dry matter (DM)
   and crude protein (CP) were measured for the four diets. Leucaena bark
   had lower CP concentration than the leaf (11.7 vs. 25.9), and the
   leucaena bark + hay diet had lower DM and CP digestibility than the
   other diets. The calculated bark digestibilities of DM and CP of 44.1\%
   and 38.2\%, respectively, were much lower than the values for the
   leucaena leaf of 62.9\% and 89.1\%, respectively. The lower than
   expected CP digestibility was attributed to higher tannin levels in the
   bark compared to the leaves. Despite this, the bark was well accepted by
   the goats and was often preferred to the hay. Stripping of the bark by
   goats also results in stems that dry quicker and have higher calorific
   value as fuel. However, if leucaena branches are fed as a sole diet, the
   goats may consume up to 30\% of bark on a DM basis and this would reduce
   nutritive value and animal productivity.},

Abstract = {The performance of a particleboard seems to be related to the chemical
   constituents of the species and the size distribution the particles.
   Neolamarckia cadamba (NC) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL) are fast
   growing species and good potential resources for particleboard
   production. This study examined the chemical contents of both species,
   as well as the mechanical and physical performance of particleboard made
   with 100\% NC, 100\% LL, and their 50:50 admixtures. High moisture
   resistance boards were prepared using melamine urea formaldehyde (MUF)
   at a content of 10, 12, and 14 \%. The 30\% extra buffering of LL
   translated to its lower performance for both mechanical and physical
   properties. The 50:50 admixtures provided enticing results, as it
   counteracts the impact of lowered performance of 100\% LL. All boards
   passed the mechanical requirements of the BS EN 312 (2003) standard, but
   they did not meet the requirement for thickness swelling. The internal
   bond for cyclic test only failed for 100\% LL with 10\% resin added.
   With use of wax, the potential of improvement in swelling properties is
   possible.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala was introduced into Panxi, Sichuan, China, in the
   1980s and 1990s for afforestation and preventing water loss and soil
   erosion in this area. The co-introduction of rhizobial symbionts of
   introduced plants has drawn attention since they may influence local
   soil communities. We studied the phylogenetic position of the L.
   leucocephala isolates and assessed if the rhizobia were introduced
   together with the host to Panxi, Sichuan, China. The glnII and atpD
   genes of fifteen representative isolates were sequenced and analyzed,
   and applied multilocus sequence analyses in which the housekeeping genes
   recA, glnII and atpD were included. Furthermore, we estimated the within
   species diversity directly with 23S rDNA and IGS RFLP and indirectly
   through phenotypic analysis of forty L. leucocephala isolates. The
   isolates represented seven species and 38 diversified strains in the
   genera Ensifer, Mesorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium. The within
   species diversity of the Ensifer isolates was large, proposing a
   potential to occupy novel niches. There was not conclusive evidence to
   show that any of the strains would have been co-introduced with L.
   leucocephala. On the contrary, we came to a conclusion that the possible
   introduction should not be inferred from sequence data alone.},

Abstract = {LlMYB1 , a subgroup 4 R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene from
   Leucaena leucocephala appears to be a repressor of lignin biosynthesis
   pathway by regulating the transcription of general phenylpropanoid
   pathway genes.
   R2R3MYB transcription factors are known to play a wide role in
   regulating the phenylpropanoid pathway in plants. In this study, we
   report isolation, cloning and characterization of an R2R3MYB
   transcription factor gene (LlMYB1) from an economically important tree
   species, Leucaena leucocephala. LlMYB1 consists of 705 bp coding
   sequence corresponding to 235 amino acids. Sequence alignment revealed
   that the N-terminal (MYB) domain of the gene shares up to 95 \%
   similarity with subgroup 4 (Sg4) members of R2R3Myb gene family
   functionally known to be lignin repressors. Highly divergent C-terminal
   region of the gene carried an ERF-associated amphiphilic repression
   (EAR) motif, another characteristic of the Sg4. The gene was
   phylogenetically grouped closest with AmMYB308, a known repressor of
   monolignol biosynthetic pathway genes. Spatio-temporal expression
   studies at different ages of seedlings using quantitative real-time PCR
   (QRT-PCR) showed highest transcript level of the gene in 10 day old stem
   tissues. Over-expression of the gene in transgenic tobacco showed
   statistically significant decline in the transcript levels of the
   general phenylpropanoid pathway genes and reduction in lignin content.
   Our study suggests that LlMYB1 might be playing the role of a repressor
   of lignin biosynthesis in L. leucocephala.},

Abstract = {A study was made on the effects of landfill gas on ARA (acetylene
   reducing activity) of nodules of two woody legumes (Acacia confusa and
   Leucaena leucocephala) widespread on landfill sites in Hong Kong. The
   effects of the three main components of landfill gas, O-2, CO2 and CH4,
   were first measured separately over a I-hr period. Maximum ARA was found
   at 20\% O-2 (close to atmospheric partial pressure) and ARA decreased as
   the O-2 decreased in the range of 16-1\%. Acacia confusa nodular ARA was
   significantly inhibited at 30-50\% CO2, but not Leucaena leucocephala
   nodular ARA. CH4 had no significant effect on ARA of either species. As
   the landfill gas concentrations in the landfill topsoil were mostly >
   10\% O-2 and < 10\% CO2, root nodules should fix N-2 effectively over
   these ranges of gases. A four-week test was conducted to assess the
   long-term influence of landfill gas on seedlings of the two legumes.
   Landfill gas and elevated CO2 both suppressed their growth and their
   nodular ARA. Even under the influence of the gases, however, seedlings
   with nodules formed a higher biomass than seedlings lacking nodules. The
   growth of the two legumes under actual landfill conditions was
   investigated by transplanting non-inoculated and pre-inoculated
   seedlings to two landfill sites in Hong Kong: Junk Bay and Shuen Wan
   Landfill. After six months, most of the non-inoculated seedlings became
   infected: Acacia confusa 63 and 70\%, Leucaena leucocephala 17 and 89\%,
   respectively, at the test sites. The results indicate that there were
   free rhizobia at these landfill sites to infect the legumes and they had
   formed effective nodules to fix N-2 under landfill conditions.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is a Mimosoid legume tree indigenous to America
   that has spread to other continents, although it is not still present in
   some European countries such as Portugal. Nevertheless, we found that
   this legume can be nodulated in this country by slow-growing rhizobial
   strains which were identified as Bradyrhizobium canariense trough the
   analysis of the core genes recA and glnII. The analysis of the symbiotic
   gene nodC showed that these strains belong to the symbiovar genistearum,
   which commonly nodulates Genistoid legumes. Although two strains
   nodulating L. leucocephala in China and Brazil were classified within
   the genus Bradyrhizobium, they belong to undescribed species and to the
   symbiovars glycinearum and tropici, respectively. Therefore, we report
   here for the first time the ability of L. leucocephala to establish
   symbiosis with strains of B. canariense sv genistearum confirming the
   high promiscuity of L. leucocephala, that allows it to establish
   symbiosis with rhizobia native to different continents increasing its
   invasiveness potential. (C) 2019 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An experiment was carried out on a commercial farm in Zulia State,
   Venezuela, in a tropical dry forest region with the objective of
   studying the milk production (MP), body condition (BC) and calving
   interval-first service (ICFS) in 24 dual purpose cows supplemented with
   concentrate Panicum maximum and Leucaena leucocephala. The grazing
   treatments grazing evaluated were Panicum + 1 h/d leucaena (T1), Panicum
   + 1 h/d leucaena + 1 kg concentrate (T2) y Panicum + 1 h/d leucaena + 2
   kg concentrate (T3). The statistical design used was completely
   randomized with 8 replications. The results obtained showed
   significative effects (P<0.05) of supplementation on MP and BC, while,
   ICFS was not affected. The highest MP values were obtained with T2 and
   T3 (9.18 and 9.47 kg/cow/d, respectively) in relation to T1 (7.22
   kg/cow/d); while, the best BC was observed with T1 (3.01). ICFS showed
   no differences between treatments, with mean of 126.2 days.},

Title = {Removal of Congo red aqueous solution using Leucaena leucocephala seed's
   extract as natural coagulant},
Journal = {APPLIED WATER SCIENCE},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coagulation is a well-known technology applied in water and wastewater
   treatment. Inorganic salts, such as alum, ferrous sulfate, and
   polyaluminum chloride, are usually used. It is widely known that
   utilization of these inorganic coagulants poses several disadvantages,
   such as high coagulant cost and high sludge volume that increase water
   treatment expenses. The use of alum also poses health risk to human as
   it may cause degenerative diseases. In order to minimize these
   disadvantages, the use of various coagulants from natural resources has
   been recently proposed. In this research, study was performed on the
   extraction and use of a potential natural coagulant (Leucaena
   leucocephala) seed kernel as natural coagulant. Leucaena seed kernel was
   extracted at various NaCl concentrations (0-5molL(-1)). Extract with
   highest protein content obtained at NaCl concentration of 3molL(-1) was
   further used to treat a synthetic wastewater model substance (Congo red
   solution) at various pH (2-10) and dosage (2-40mLL(-1)). This natural
   coagulant successfully removed 99.9\% of the color at pH 3 and dosage
   10mLL(-1), with only half sludge volume discharged when compared to
   alum. The result suggests that leucaena is a promising natural coagulant
   for water and wastewater treatment.},

   possible to verify that, in terms of absolute, the biggest average
   gravimetric revenue, of 30,48\%, was introduced by the vegetable coal of
   the firewood of the pau-jacare (P. gonoacantha), pyrolysed to the
   temperature 400 degrees C and when pyrolysed to the temperatures of 400
   degrees C and 600 degrees C they introduced revenues in fixed lightly
   better carbon to the of the two other species. Considering itself that
   the revenue in fixed carbon is a variable that drift of qualitative and
   quantitative parameters of the coal, it can conclude that the pau-jacare

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {The experiment was conducted for five years in sowings of Leucaena
   leucocephala to define the space and time distribution of Heteropsylla
   cubana and its optimum number of samples in this legume under Cuban
   conditions. Random samplings were performed every 15 d. For the study of
   the seasonal dynamics, the samplings consisted of collecting randomly
   four sprouts in one of the five blocks, one per every cardinal point.
   For the time dynamics, a sample of 60 net sweeps/block was collected
   with a sweepnet. With the values obtained in each sampling, a matrix of
   data was created using them to make the multiple comparison analysis of
   the proportions according to the state of development/cardinal point and
   the total population/cardinal point. The indices of dispersion, size of
   the sample and trend of the population in time were calculated. The
   results showed significant differences between the populations of H.
   cubana in the different cardinal points. From September to January, the
   population kept similar populational peaks in the four cardinal points,
   with slight predominance in the west, where the highest densities were
   recorded and equivalent to 130 insects/sprout. The space distribution
   indicated that H. cubana tends to aggregation and the distribution in
   time. It had similar performance according to the development state,
   with increase in the first years in the amount of eggs/m(2), which
   surpassed 80 individuals. This evidenced a populational peak from
   October to December, with indices/m(2) of nymphs and adults of 55 and
   33, respectively. These populations descended in the forthcoming years
   to values lower than 27 individuals in all the development states. It is
   concluded that Heteropsylla cubana does not have marked preference to be
   located in certain cardinal point. Its space disposition is of the
   aggregate type. The populational fluctuations of the insect under Cuban
   conditions encompass as favorable period the ends of the rainy season
   and the beginnings of the dry season, with a populational peak from
   October to November. The optimum number of samples in one hectare of 20
   samples of sprouts and 25 samples of 60 net sweeps each, equally
   distributed in five blocks. It is recommended to further study the
   monitoring of H. cubana and its bioregulators in sowings of L.
   leucocephala with a monthly frequency from September to March. A
   stratified sampling was used following the sampling methodology proposed
   to keep the updating of the performance of its populational density in
   Cuban conditions.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. is native to Central America and
   Mexico, but now grows naturally in most tropical areas globally. It is a
   neglected and underutilized; medium to small sized tree of multiple
   values. It is commonly known as wild tamarind in English and subabul in
   Hindi. In recent years, Leucaena has gained a great attention for its
   utilization as raw material on large scale for pulp and paper industries
   and manufacturing of packaging material. Present paper deals with
   distribution, morphological description, current utilization, future
   prospective and propagation of this species. During the present study we
   have standardized macro-propagation technique for L. leucocephala. We
   used fly ash amended sand to develop rooting media for vegetative
   propagation of L. leucocephala and assess its potential as a rooting
   media. Root formation was significantly high (p < 0.05) in 10 \% FA
   amended sand in comparison to other used media. Rooted plants showed
   nutrient deficiency symptoms after 40-50 days in sand while in 10 \% FA
   amended sand they were healthy, greener and do not showed nutrient
   deficiency symptoms. On the basis of present study, it is concluded that
   10 \% fly ash amended sand is a suitable rooting media for vegetative
   propagation of L. leucocephala.},

Abstract = {Data on chemical composition of Leucaena leucocephala are presented. The
   nitrogen, sugar, starch and neutral detergent fibre contents were 32.4,
   42.8, 8.6 and 201.8 g kg-1 dry matter. Gross energy was 20.24 MJ/kg DM.
   Tannin content was 2.9\% while total trypsin concentration is also
   presented.
   In Experiment 1 the effect of different levels of inclusion of leucaena
   in rabbit broiler mash on performance of rabbits was studied. Treatment
   A was 100\% broiler mash while Treatments B and C were composed of 15\%
   and 30\% leucaena meal, the other portions being broiler mash. Growth
   rate, feed intake and feed conversion ratio and dressing percentage were
   not affected by level of inclusion.
   Experiment 2 with 40 female rabbits comprised five treatments: Treatment
   A was rabbit broiler mash while Treatments B, C, D and E were made up of
   40\% of either Leuneae cornuta, Leucaena leucocephala or Commelina
   benghalensis or equal proportions of the three species respectively, the
   other portions being broiler mash. Animals on Treatment A had relatively
   higher liveweights and dressing percentages but were not significantly
   different from those of Treatments B, C and E (P > 0.05). Rabbits on
   Treatment D had significantly (P < 0.05) lower growth rate and dressing

Abstract = {Simple Summary The objective of the experiment was to evaluate the
   effects of dietary supplementation of heifers with increasing levels of
   dried Leucaena leucocephala leaves (DLL) on nutrient digestibility,
   fermentation parameters, microbial rumen population, and production of
   enteric methane (CH4). Nutrient digestibility decreased with increasing
   levels of DLL in the ration. Inclusion of DLL did not have detrimental
   effects on rumen pH, rumen microbial community, and volatile fatty acids
   proportions. Enteric CH4 emissions in heifers were reduced with
   increasing levels of DLL in the ration. The effects of dietary inclusion
   of dried Leucaena leucocephala leaves (DLL) on nutrient digestibility,
   fermentation parameters, microbial rumen population, and production of
   enteric methane (CH4) in crossbred heifers were evaluated. Four heifers
   were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design consisting of four periods and
   four levels of inclusion of DLL: 0\%, 12\%, 24\%, and 36\% of dry matter
   (DM) intake. Results showed that DM intake (DMI), organic matter intake,
   and gross energy intake (GEI) were similar (p > 0.05) among treatments.
   Apparent digestibility of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and
   energy decreased with increasing levels of DLL in the ration (p < 0.05).
   In contrast, digestible crude protein (CP) was higher (p < 0.05) in
   treatments with 12\% and 24\% DM of DLL. The inclusion of DLL did not
   affect (p > 0.05) rumen pH and total volatile fatty acids. Rumen
   microbial community was not affected (p > 0.05) by treatment. There was
   a linear reduction (p < 0.05) in CH4 emissions as the levels of DLL in
   the ration were increased. Results of this study suggest that an
   inclusion of 12\% DM of ration as DLL enhances digestible CP and reduces
   daily production of enteric CH4 without adversely affecting DMI, rumen
   microbial population, and fermentation parameters.},

Abstract = {Water pollution, as a result of industrial development, has detrimental
   effects on aquatic organisms and human beings. In this research,
   Leucaena leucocephala biomass was modified using Fenton's reagent and
   sodium hydroxide, and the performances of the native, Fenton-treated,
   and NaOH-activated adsorbents for removal of Ni(II) from aqueous
   solution were evaluated under various experimental conditions such as
   initial pH, contact time, initial concentration of Ni(II), adsorbent
   dosage, and temperature. The adsorbents were characterized using Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy and pH of the point of zero charge.
   Kinetic and equilibrium adsorption data were well described by Elovich
   and Liu models, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities are
   50.66, 56.72, and 75.17 mg/g for the native, Fenton-treated, and
   NaOH-activated L. leucocephala adsorbents, respectively. Desorption of
   Ni(II) from the surface of the adsorbents was done effectively with 0.03
   mol/L of hydrochloric acid. Thermodynamic calculations show that the
   adsorption process was spontaneous, feasible, and favorable because the
   values of Delta G degrees were negative. Adsorption of Ni(II) onto the
   adsorbents was exothermic (Delta H degrees values were negative) and
   there was also a decrease in the randomness of the liquid-solid
   interface (Delta G degrees values were negative). Overall, the three
   adsorbents can be used for the treatment of water that is contaminated
   with Ni(II).},

Abstract = {This research investigated the effectiveness of leucaena leucocephala as
   a natural coagulant for chromium removal. Leucaena leucocephala is a
   permanent non-climbing shrub tree which is wild and abundant in Malaysia
   and commonly known as petai belalang. Coagulation experiment using jar
   test were performed where the effect of coagulant dosage and pH were
   examined. The parameters investigated were suspended solid (SS),
   chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), turbidity
   and chromium content. The optimum of leucaena leucocephala coagulant
   dosage for removal of suspended solid, turbidity, COD, BOD and Chromium
   is at range 400-600 mg/L which yielded 45, 31.4, 38.5, 27.5 and 4.05\%
   removal respectively. While the optimum pH is at pH 2-4 (acidic) which
   give 33.3, 26.8, 33.75, 31.4 and 14.06\% removal of suspended solid,
   COD, BOD, turbidity and chromium content respectively. It is concluded
   that the leucaena leucocephala showed tremendous potential for chromium

Abstract = {We selected 28 populations of Leucaena leucocephala from different

   We evaluated fiber length, optical density, wall thickness, vessel
   element length, vessel element diameter, specific gravity and lignin of
   these populations of L. leucocephala in different sites. Populations had
   significant variations for all growth, wood and paper parameters. Girth
   at breast height (GBH) and specific gravity were the most important
   parameters for heritability and genetic gain, respectively. The minimum
   heritability was reported for vessel element length and genetic gain for
   fiber length. The populations were grouped into six clusters, cluster II
   had maximum number of populations (14) and clusters IV and VI had one
   population each. GBH contributed maximum of 34.39 \% towards total
   divergence followed by specific gravity (14.02\%). An economic technique
   to produce quality seed by establishing seed orchards with genetically
   divergent parents was suggested. The hybridization among the populations
   selected from diverse clusters could produce greater heterosis needed
   for higher growth and suitable wood and paper manufacturing parameters.},

Abstract = {The present investigation reports a novel thermoalkalotolerant lipase
   producing Basidiomycetes, Schizophyllum commune ISTL04 for the first
   time. Abundantly available Leucaena leucocephala seeds were exploited as
   a cheap fermentable source for the feasible production of extracellular
   lipase. The isolate ISTL04 grew vigorously on Leucaena seeds in
   comparison to Soybean meal and Wheat bran exhibiting a lipase activity
   of 146.5 U/g. The S. commune ISTL04 (SCI) lipase was purified to 35.76
   folds with a specific activity of 238.13 U/mg and an estimated mass of
   60 kDa. The temperature and pH optima for lipolytic activity were 60
   degrees C and 11, respectively. The enzyme exhibited remarkable
   stability in the presence of non-polar and polar organic solvents (50\%,
   v/v), retaining more than 90\% and 40\% activity, respectively. The
   lipase activity increased significantly in the presence of Mg2+ (154\%),
   Ca2+ (109.7\%), Mn2+ (106\%) and Tween 80(240\%). The distinctive and
   broader operational properties of the SCI lipase make it a promising

Abstract = {Background: Free radicals generated during injury lead to the
   development of various diseases such as diabetes, myocardial infarction,
   cerebrovascular disease, and cancer. Antioxidants present in plants can
   prevent the deleterious effect of these free radicals. Among various
   plants, Leucaena leucocephala is a mimosoid, fast-growing,
   nitrogen-fixing small tree having pods with various medicinal
   properties. Objective: Hence, the present study was designed to
   determine the bioactive potential of ethanolic and methanolic extracts
   of L. leucocephala pod seeds. Materials and Methods: We have assessed
   the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the extract. In
   addition, the presence of various metabolites and other compounds was
   also evaluated though gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
   analysis. Results: The results indicated that the methanol extract had
   relatively higher antibacterial and antioxidant properties than ethanol
   extract. Furthermore, GC-MS data revealed the presence of various active
   constituents in the methanolic extract. Conclusion: Thus, the bioactive
   potential of various compounds present in methanol extracts of plant
   parts could be responsible for its antibacterial and antioxidant
   properties.},

Abstract = {A simple extract of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit leaf containing
   mimosine is proposed as a natural color reagent for the determination of
   iron. The extract exhibited the formation of Fe(III) with mimosine
   similarly to that of the commercially available mimosine. A linear
   calibration: A(460) = 6.8 x 10(-2) {[}Fe(III)] + 8.2 x 10(-2), R-2 =
   0.99 was obtained for 0-10 mg.L-1, with LOD (3 sigma), LOQ (10 sigma)
   and \%RSD being 0.2 mg.L-1, 0.7 mg.L-1 and less than 5, respectively.
   The proposed procedure was demonstrated for real samples of blood tonic.
   The results agreed with that of the FAAS method.},

Abstract = {Poisoning of a goat by Leucaena leucocephala (Leg. Mimosoideae) in the
   State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is described. Fresh leaves of the plant
   were ingested as the animal's main meal for at least 4 months before it
   developed total alopecia. At necropsy the thyroid was moderately
   enlarged. Histological examination revealed a decrease in the number of
   hair follicles (empty or in telogenic phase), vacuolation of
   keratinocytes of the epidermis and hair follicles, and superficial and
   follicular hyperkeratosis. Myxedema was found between skeletal and
   cardiac muscles fibers, in the kidneys, and in the submucosa/muscular
   layer of the digestive tract. The thyroid follicles were enlarged and
   filled with copious amounts of colloid (colloidal goiter). Although L.
   leucocephala is common in several tropical regions, natural poisoning by
   this plant in goats seems to be rare. It is the first report about
   spontaneous poisoning in goats by L. leucocephala in Brazil.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is a leguminous tree species accounting for
   one-fourth of raw material supplied to paper and pulp industry in India.
   Cinnamate 4-Hydroxylase (C4H, EC 1.14.13.11) is the second gene of
   phenylpropanoid pathway and a member of cytochrome P450 family. There is
   currently intense interest to alter or modify lignin content of L.
   leucocephala. Three highly similar C4H alleles of LlC4H1 gene were
   isolated and characterized. The alleles shared more than 98 \% sequence
   identity at amino acid level to each other. Binding of partial promoter
   of another C4H gene LlC4H2, to varying amounts of crude nuclear proteins
   isolated from leaf and stem tissues of L. leucocephala formed two loose
   and one strong complex, respectively, suggesting that the abundance of
   proteins that bind with the partial C4H promoter is higher in stem
   tissue than in leaf tissue. Quantitative Real Time PCR study suggested
   that among tissues of same age, root tissues had highest level of C4H
   transcripts. Maximum transcript level was observed in 30 day old root
   tissue. Among the tissues investigated, C4H activity was highest in 60
   day old root tissues. Tissue specific quantitative comparison of lignin
   from developing seedling stage to 1 year old tree stage indicated that
   Klason lignin increased in tissues with age.},

   did not differ from the others. In the dry season, the best
   weights/plant (leaves + green stems) (P < 0.001) were Peru-Cuba (470)

   from Playa Rosario, while in the dry season the weights per plant were
   lower (P < 0.001) in Playa Rosario (70) which did not differ from Pinar
   del Rio, 8 Vias and Campina grande.  The remaining ecotypes had a

Journal = {ABANICO VETERINARIO},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Haemonchus contortus (HC) is a gastrointestinal nematode of worldwide
   importance due to the economic losses it causes directly and indirectly
   in sheep production. Plant extracts rich in secondary metabolites have
   been proposed as an alternative method of gastrointestinal nematode
   control in sheep and goats, as they fulfill their biological function
   and a sustainable environmental accompaniment. The objective of the
   present experiment was to determine the effect of the hydroalcoholic
   extract of Leucaena leucocephala leaves (HELL) on the hatching of
   Haemonchus contortus in vitro. The extract was obtained by the
   maceration technique and was subjected to qualitative phytochemical
   characterization, in which instaurations, phenolic oxydryls, lactones,
   flavonols, floratanins, coumarins, saponins and aromatic compounds were
   identified. Concentrations of 100, 90, 80, 70, 60 and 50 mg/mL of the
   extract were evaluated on the inhibition of egg hatching (IEH) of HC.
   The hydroalcoholic extract of L. leucocephala showed 71\% IEH at 100
   mg/mL, an EC50 and EC90 of 52.22 and 302 mg/mL, respectively. The
   hydroalcoholic extract of L. leucocephala leaves contains bioactive
   compounds (phenolics, terpenes and flavonoids) that inhibit HC egg
   hatching with dose-dependent effect. Therefore, HELL could be considered
   as an alternative control on this nematode, however, it is necessary to
   determine the specific metabolite that confers the activity, determine
   its toxicity and perform in vivo trials.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (coffee bush) is a strictly tropical
   species that requires warm temperatures for optimal growth. It is
   drought-tolerant (even during establishment) and can withstand up to 7
   months of dry season. L leucocephala oil extracted from seeds was
   analyzed to determine it possible uses. The oil content of the seeds was
   5.44\% and mainly consisted of linoleic acid (51.65\%), oleic acid
   (21.40\%), palmitic acid (13.21\%) and stearic acid (5.92\%). This oil
   has high vitamin E activity because of its concentration of
   alpha-tocopherol (175.47 mg/100 g). The weak acid and peroxide values
   (0.6\% and 3.56 mequiv. O-2/kg oil, respectively) were indicators of the
   good quality of the oil. L. leucocephala showed high thermal stability
   (up to 255.47 degrees C) and some absorbance in the UV-B and UV-C
   ranges. The results showed that this new seed oil can be used as an
   ingredient in cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {A reversed high performance liquid chromatography method was developed
   for the quantitative determination of mimosine and 2,3-DHP in leaves of
   Leucaena Leucocephala. Mimosine and 2,3DHP were extracted using 0.1N
   HCI. The chromatograph conditions were investigated and optimized. The
   optimal HPLC conditions as follows: Agilent HC-C18 column ( 4.6x150mm,5
   mu m) was used at 30 degrees C. The method used a variable wavelength UV
   detector at 280nm, the mobile phase consisted of 0.2 \% (w/v)
   orthophosphoric acid and methanol, the gradient elution was adopted. The
   injection volume was 10 mu L. The linearity is favorable in the range of
   1.0 to 50 mu g m(L-1) with a correlation coefficient of 0.99998 for
   mimosine and 0.99902 for 2,3DHP. Under the optimal conditions, the
   method limit of detection (LOD) of mimosine and 2,3DHP were 0.40mg/kg
   and 0.55mg/kg respectively. The recovery of mimosine was 87.00-94.70\%
   with the RSD (n=5) of 2.75-3.81\% in the spiked levels 0,1, 5, 20mg/g.
   At the same time, the recovery of 2,3DHP was 88-95.4\% with the RSD
   (n=5) of 2.24-4.90\%. The method was found to be simple, sensitive, fast
   and accurate, and has been applied successfully for the quantitative
   detection of mimosine and 2,3-DHP in leaves of Leucaena Leucocephala,

   peanuts was reduced (P less than or equal to 0.05) as a result of fat
   extraction at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 12 h. Fat extraction of canola seed
   increased CP disappearance at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h (P less than or equal
   to 0.05). However, in the case of defatted canola seed, an increase in
   DM disappearance (P less than or equal to 0.05) was observed in the
   first 4 incubation times and a decrease (P less than or equal to 0.05)
   in the later times. Fat extraction increased (P less than or equal to
   0.05) DM disappearance of palm kernel at 0 and 48 h, but reduced it at
   4, 6 and 24 h. CP disappearance of palm kernel was improved by treatment
   (P less than or similar to 0.05) at 0, 4, 24 and 48 h and decreased at
   12 h. In the case of palm kernel the largest differences in DM and CP
   disappearance occurred between the 24 and 48 h incubation times.
   Degradability characteristics for DM and CP of full-fat soyabean, canola
   seed and peanut were comparable to those of the Full fat samples.
   Effective DM degradability of soyabean, canola seed and peanuts was 72.2
   and 71.9; 74.1 and 66.8; and 85.9 and 70.8 for full far and extracted
   feeds, respectively. Effective CP degradability was similar in all
   oilseeds with the exception of the extracted canola seed. Therefore, the
   incorporation of full-fat soyabean, canola seed and peanut into ruminant
   rations can be considered as a means of increasing the energy balance.
   Both palm kernel DM and CP degradabilities were characterized by slow
   rates of degradation by negative Values `'b''. This suggests the
   predominance of microbial colonization over disappearance during
   incubation. DM and CP disappearance of Leucaena leucocephala leaves
   originating from Cuba were lower than those from Nigeria. Degradability
   characteristics for CP and DM of Cuban leucaena leaves showed that the
   linear model resulted in a better fit than the exponential one.},

Abstract = {Heavy metal accumulation in reclaimed soils is increasing rapidly in
   developing countries where the use of saline waters for irrigation is a
   common practice, even though salinity-heavy metal interactions are not
   fully understood. An example for this development is the Banger area of
   Egypt where the application of contaminated amendments during the last
   30 years has increased the Cd and Zn concentrations in topsoils from
   0.08 to 0.76 mg . kg(-1) and from 17 to 73 mg . kg(-1) respectively.
   This work aimed at evaluating the uptake of Cd and Zn by Leucaena
   leucocephala, a leguminous tree cropped for fodder and green manure, as
   affected by the addition of 10 mM NaCl to irrigation water. During a 6
   month field experiment, salinized and control plots were compared with
   respect to soil solution composition and root development as well as the
   uptake of Cd and Zn and their translocation to the leaves.
   NaCl treatment raised the concentration of organic carbon, Cd and Zn in
   soil solution and enhanced the uptake of Cd and Zn significantly.
   Salinized plants showed shorter roots, reduced retention of Cd and Zn in
   roots and stems and considerable translocation of both elements to the
   leaves.
   This work demonstrates that NaCl salinity affects not only the
   bioavailability of soil Cd and Zn but also modifies plant functions
   related to their acquisition and translocation to the leaves. The
   results provide evidence that the risk of transfer of heavy metals to
   the food chain and their leachability to the ground water may be greater
   under saline conditions than generally assumed.},

Abstract = {A greenhouse experiment was conducted to assess the arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi inoculum potential for Leucaena leucocephala in a
   range of nutrient-depleted farm soils in western Kenya. Leucaena was
   grown in 12 uninoculated farm soils with pH 5,0-6.7, with or without
   rock P and farmyard manure. Root infection, nodulation, and shoot and
   root weight a ere determined 25, 46, and 69 days after planting. Spore
   concentrations in the farm soils at the start of the experiment ranged
   from 44 to 126 live spores per 100 g dry soil with 6-10 species per
   soil, principally Scutellospora spp. and Acaulospora spp. Nodulation was
   absent or poor in all soils, indicating the need for rhizobial
   inoculation of species belonging to the leucaena crossinoculation group
   in this agrosystem. Rock-P atone increased final shoot dr weight by a
   factor of 1.4. manure alone by 1.8, and rock P plus manure by 1.9,
   compared with no ameliorant. Root infection with AM fungi was detected
   in all soils 25 days after planting and increased linearly in the
   different farm soils to values of 33-65\% 69 days after planting. Soil
   pH and root infection 25 days after planting accounted for much of the
   variation in final shoot weight among soils with no amelioront (87\%).
   As early root infection increased from 20 to 40\% at soil FH 5.0, the
   predicted final shoot dry weight was doubled, and the response to
   ameliorants was reduced by two-thirds. The growth responses to increased
   infection became smaller as pH increased from 5.0 to 6.5.},

   with four nutrient treatments: receiving all nutrients; all nutrients

   compared to quantify the time course of the onset of N and P deficiency
   during 8 weeks. N deficiency became significant for leaf area and
   biomass growth after 11 and 16 days, respectively, whereas P deficiency
   became significant after 31 days for both leaf area and biomass growth.
   Thus, seed reserves alone could support the P demands of seedlings for
   more than twice as long as N demands. As nutrient deficiency developed,
   seedlings adjusted increased relative biomass allocation to roots,
   diluted organ N and P concentrations but conserved 100\% of the initial
   nutrient pool derived from the seed.},

Abstract = {The awareness of the environmental impact of CO2 emission from fossil

   challenges and potentials of production of biodiesel, bio-oil, ethanol,
   char, biogas, and activated carbon from the seeds, forages and leaves,
   bark, wood, and legumes of the Leucaena leucocephala. Also, the
   biorefinery concept was elucidated for the plausible generation of fine

Abstract = {Oral cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and metastasis
   is recognized as a major factor causing its low survival rate. The
   inhibition of metastasis progress and the improvement of the survival
   rate for oral cancer are critical research objectives. Leucaena
   leucocephala from the mimosa branch Leucaena genus is native to Central
   and South America and has been used as a traditional remedy for treating
   various disorders. Previous studies have demonstrated antioxidant,
   anti-inflammatory as well as anticancer properties of L. leucocephala
   plant materials. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the
   anticancer effect induced by L. leucocephala remains unclear. In this
   study, we investigated the effect of L. leucocephala extract (LLE) on
   SCC-9 and SAS oral cancer cells and examined the potential inhibitory
   mechanisms involved. The results indicated that LLE attenuated the
   migration and invasion abilities of both SCC-9 and SAS cells by reducing
   the activity and protein expression of matrix metalloproteinases-2
   (MMP-2). Regarding mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, the
   phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 exhibited a significant inhibitory
   effect in the presence of LLE. The application of ERK inhibitor and p38
   inhibitor confirmed that both signalling transduction pathways were
   involved in the inhibition of cell metastasis. These data indicate that
   L. leucocephala could be a potent therapeutic agent for the prevention
   and treatment of oral cancer and a prominent plant source for anticancer
   research in the future.},

Abstract = {A new cyclitol which is abundant in the late developmental stages of
   leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) seeds was identified by
   HPLC, NMR, and GC-MS as O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 --> 1)-3-
   O-methyl-D-chiro-inositol, a new galactopinitol. This galactopinitol was
   initially detected midway through seed development and increased to 10.2
   mg (g DW)(-1), but decreased in mature seeds to its about a half.
   Stachyose content increased greatly and remained the most abundant of
   the soluble sugars in mature seeds (25.6 mg (g DW)-1). Artificial drying
   at 73\% relative humidity of 70 DPA immature seeds induced the
   accumulation of raffinose, stachyose, galactopinitol and galactinol, but
   the total amounts of these sugars were only about half of those found in
   mature seeds. Seed germination decreased following an initial increase
   after 8 d artificial drying to a moisture content of 24\%, and this
   dehydration damage probably is because of underdevelopment of seed
   tissue. Galactopinitol changes in a similar fashion to the
   oligosaccharides during the late developmental stage and dehydration
   experiment, implying that galactopinitol may play a role in desiccation
   tolerance of leucaena seeds.},

Abstract = {Dietary strategies aiming at minimizing enteric methane (CH4) emission
   in ruminants are of practical interest from nutritional, economical, and

   supplementing Leucaena leucocephala leaves either alone or in

   and enteric CH4 emission in crossbred cattle fed wheat straw and
   concentrate-based diet under tropical conditions. Eighteen crossbred
   (Karan-Fries) calves were randomly allocated into 3 groups: G-I
   (control)-fed wheat (Triticum aestivum) straw and concentrate mixture in
   the ratio 50:50; G-II-fed wheat straw, concentrate mixture, and Leucaena
   leucocephala leaves in the ratio 45:45:10; and (3) G-III-fed similar
   diet like G-II with an additional supplementation of 1\% malic acid on
   dry matter intake basis. Experimental feeding spanning 90 days included
   a 7-day metabolism trial and CH4 quantification study by sulfur
   hexafluoride tracer technique. Results revealed no significant effect of
   dietary treatments on dry matter intake (DMI) and digestibility of
   nutrients, except neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility which was
   5.5\% higher (P < 0.05) in G-III as compared to control. Further,
   nitrogen (N) metabolism, rumen microbial protein synthesis, and growth
   performance remained similar among the treatments. No significant effect
   was also observed for enteric CH4 emission (expressed as g/day and g/kg
   DMI) in calves supplemented with Leucaena leucocephala leaves and malic
   acid. Therefore, the present findings depict modest improvement in fiber
   digestibility with no encouraging effect in mitigating enteric CH4 in
   growing cattle calves by supplementing Leucaena leucocephala leaves
   alone or with malic acid within the selected levels.},

Abstract = {The anthelmintic effect of chromatographic fractions of leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de wit seed extract was investigated to determine
   the relative efficacy of the seed components as anthelmintic against
   gastrointestinal sheep nematodes. The fractions were obtained by
   thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) fingerprinting of eluates from gradient
   vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) of the seed ethanol extract. These
   were evaluated for nematocidal activity by a larval development
   viability assay (LDVA) in vitro. The effect of the test extracts on the
   transformation of L-1 to L-3 and the survival rate of infective larvae
   (L-3), of strongyles of sheep, predominantly Haemonchus contortus
   (Rudolphi), was used to determine relative bioactivity. Best-fit LC50
   values were computed using global model of nonlinear regression
   curve-fitting. The composition of the fractions was identified by
   phytochemical screening. The extracts killed infective larvae of H.
   contortus of sheep in a concentration-dependent manner. Best-fit LC50
   values are 77.66, 65.56, 56.72, and 40.80 mu g/ml for fractions A, B, C,
   and D, respectively (95\% CI). The fractions are composed of alkaloids
   (A), alkaloids and tannins (B and C), and flavonoids and tannins (D).
   Fraction D was significantly more active than all the other fractions (p
   < 0.001, one-way ANOVA, Tukey's multiple comparison test). The most
   active fraction (D) contains polar polyphenols, thus providing a
   scientific justification for the use of aqueous extract in traditional
   practice. The polyphenol fraction of L. leucocephala seed could find
   application in anthelmintic therapy in veterinary practice.},

   glycosides, tannins, and saponins. The total phenol content of LLME was
   970 mg of GAE/g, and total flavonoid content was found to be 550 mg of
   QE/g. In DPPH and ABTS assay LLME showed good antioxidant activity
   (IC50: 11.21 +/- 0.2 and 11.87 +/- 0.05 mu g/mL) when compared to the
   standard dnig, ascorbic acid (IC50 :11.09 +/- 0.05 and 11.01 +/- 0.09 mu
   g/mL). Similarly, in alpha-ainvlase and alpha-glucosidase inhibition
   assay, acarbose revealed enzyme inhibition activity with an IC50 value
   of 12.02 +/- 0.02 and 12.11 +/- 0.02 mu g/mL while LLME showed an IC50
   value of 12.46 +/- 0.06 and 12.47 +/- 0.08 mu g/mL, respectively. The
   present study leads to the conclusion that L. leucocephala ethanol leaf
   extract is with tremendous antioxidant and antidiabetic properties.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit is a legume used as forage of high
   nutritive value and acceptability. Those characteristics make it an
   alternative for animal feeding and production. It is well known that
   Heteropsylla cubana Crawfort (Hompotera:Psylidae) is the most
   significant pest affecting this legurne. This study was aimed at
   increasing the knowledge on the behavior and distribution of this
   psyllid in leucaena crops. Thus, samplings were carried out for two
   years in a leucaena grassland. Data were collected to calculate the
   spatial localization in each month. Ninety-one percent of the months
   were classified as contagion and the rest as regular. The annual
   temporal localization was also determined and classified as contagion
   with an agglomeration of isolated psyllids and a binomial negative
   probability distribution of data. Finally, the optimum sample size (1433
   trappings/year) was calculated under similar conditions.},

Abstract = {The effect of exogenous ethephon and its combination with gibberellic
   acid (GA3), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and benzyl amino purine (BAP) on
   tension wood formation in the vertically growing shoots of Leucaena
   leucocephala has been studied using light and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). The application of exogenous ethephon induced tension
   wood formation. The percentage of tension wood severity in the shoots
   was directly proportional to the concentration of ethephon applied. SEM
   studies revealed the replacement of S2 and S3 fibre wall layers with the
   gelatinous layer (G-layer) in response to high concentration of
   ethephon. Ethephon exhibited synergistic interaction with GA3 and BAP in
   tension wood formation. Fibres and vessel elements in tension wood,
   induced by ethylene and its combination with other hormones showed
   increase or decrease in their dimensions irrespective of their
   concentration and combination. The density of rays increased in all the
   treatments except in the combination of ethephon and IAA. The anatomical
   data indicate that ethylene plays a major role in tension wood formation
   and it interacts synergistically with gibberellins and cytokinin. On the
   other hand, such synergistic interaction was not found between ethephon

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in plant-based diets,
   particularly legumes, as a sustainable and healthy dietary choice. This
   study breaks new ground by investigating the effects of simulated
   gastrointestinal digestion on green (Leucaena leucocephala) and
   pigmented (Leucaena esculenta) guaje proteins. We evaluated the
   antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties of ultrafiltered fractions
   resulting from digestion in a macrophage model. Both fractions showed
   promising potential as radical scavengers. The fraction <5 kDa from
   pigmented guaje, even at the lowest doses tested, significantly (p <
   0.05) inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and
   IL-6, and demonstrated an immunomodulatory effect by reducing the levels
   of ROS and NO. These findings suggest that green and pigmented guaje
   could be a valuable source of bioactive peptides, potentially used as a
   coadjutant for treating and preventing oxidative stress and
   inflammation-associated non-communicable diseases through the
   utilization of underutilized legumes.},

Title = {Jasmonate-Elicited Stress Induces Metabolic Change in the Leaves of
   Leucaena leucocephala},
Journal = {MOLECULES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The plant Leucaena leucocephala was exposed to four jasmonate elicitors,
   i.e., jasmonic acid (JA), methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA),
   jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) and 6-ethyl indanoyl glycine conjugate
   (2-{[}(6-ethyl-1-oxo-indane-4-carbonyl)-amino]-acetic acid methyl ester)
   (CGM). The treatment was to mimic the herbivores and wounding stresses.
   By using NMR spectroscopy along with chemometric analysis, including
   principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares
   discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), the changes of metabolites in the leaves
   of L. leucocephala were determined under the stress as induced by the
   four elicitors. The challenge of JA-Ile caused an accumulation of lactic
   acid (6), beta-glucose (10), alanine (12), threonine (13), steroids
   (18), 3,4-dihydroxypyridine (19) and an unidentified compound 20. The
   chemometric analysis of the PCA and PLS-DA models indicated that the
   alternation of metabolites triggered by JA, MeJA, and CGM treatments
   were very minimum. In contrast, the treatment by JA-Ile could induce the
   most significant metabolic changes in the leaves. Moreover, there was
   very minimal new metabolite being detected in responding to the
   jasmonate-induced stresses. The results showed some metabolite
   concentrations changed after application of the elicitors, which may be
   related to a high level of tolerance to stress conditions as well as the
   strong ecological suitability of L. leucocephala.},

Abstract = {Fifteen intact male goats of Jamunapari breeds, 12-15 months old
   weighing 22.0 kg were divided into three groups of five animals in each
   in a completely randomized design to determine the effect of feeding
   Leucaena leucocephala leaves and twigs (LLLT) on heat production (HP)
   and energy balance (EB). Animals in treatment I (Control) was supplied
   with a conventional ration consisting of a concentrate mixture and
   vegetative parts of Zea mays and in treatments II and III received
   similar rations except that LLLT provided about 0.40 and 0.50 parts
   crude protein (CP) of total protein in ration, respectively by replacing
   0.50 and 1.00 parts each of the solvent extracted groundnut cake and
   wheat bran in the concentrate mixture, respectively. The dry matter (DM)
   supplemented through LLLT was 0, 121 and 224 g in treatments I, II and
   III, respectively and it corresponds to 0, 0.19 and 0.34 parts of total
   DM intake. Supplementation of increasing amount of LLLT did not affect
   (P=0.303) DM intake but digestibility of DM decreased (P=0.002)
   linearly. The digestible energy (DE) intake was not affected (P=0.161)
   due to supplementation of LLLT. Urinary energy (UE) loss per kg
   metabolic body size per day and as proportion of gross energy (GE) or DE
   intake increased (P < 0.001) linearly with increased LLLT
   supplementation. Average methane production varied from 15.2 to 17.3
   L/d. Methane energy loss per kg metabolic body size per day decreased
   (P=0.024) linearly with increased supplementation of LLLT, however, as
   proportion of GE or DE did not show any effect of treatment.
   Metabolizable energy (ME) intake per kg metabolic body size per day was
   unaffected (P=0.113) by the treatments which corresponded to 1.63, 1.35
   and 1.38 times of maintenance in treatments I, II and III, respectively
   indicated that animals were in well-fed condition. Heat production (HP)
   and energy balance (EB) were not affected by the supplementation
   treatment. It is concluded that supplementation of 224 g of LLLT in the
   diet of goats, which provided DM at a proportion of 0.34 or CP at a
   proportion of 0.59, did not affect HP and EB. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

   obtainment of groups that were reordered according to their biological
   performance and, at the same tulle, the accessions were grouped
   according to their similarities. There were groups of good performance
   in which the total yield of seed per plant was Lip to 300 g. while., in
   other groups, it was never Superior to 20 g. The number of seeds/pods
   was LIP to 24. The weight of 1000 seeds was. sometimes. 50.5 g, while

Abstract = {Lead (Leucaena leucocephala) seed extract was prepared using distilled
   water as a medium. An extraction yield of 26.16 g/100 g of seed was
   obtained after extraction at room temperature for 12 h. Total phenolic
   and mimosine contents in the lead seed extract powder (LSEP) were 17.4g
   GAE/100 g and 8.8 g/100 g, respectively. LSEP at different
   concentrations (0.05\%, 0.1\%, 0.25\%, 0.5\%, and 1\%, w/v) showed
   inhibitory activity towards polyphenoloxidase (PPO) of Pacific white
   shrimp in a dose dependent manner. When the whole Pacific white shrimp
   were treated with 0.25\% and 0.5\% (w/v) LSEP, the shrimp treated with
   0.5\% LSEP had the lower melanosis score throughout the storage of 12
   days and showed a higher score for colour and odour, as well as overall
   likeness, compared with the control (without treatment) and 1.25\%
   sodium metabisulphite treated samples at day 12 (P < 0.05). Meat of
   shrimps treated with LSEP at both levels had the increase in mimosine
   content up to 8 days, suggesting the migration of mimosine into shrimp
   muscle during extended storage. Therefore, 0.5\% LSEP can be used as a
   novel melanosis inhibitor for Pacific white shrimp. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {A pot study was conducted to measure the extent of and determine the
   factors controlling fine root and nodule shedding following coppicing of
   Sesbania sesban and Leucaena leucocephala. Fine (< 2 mm) root biomass
   decreased below pre-cutting values, but the decreases were not
   statistically significant in either species. Living (white) nodule
   biomass decreased and dead (brown) nodule biomass increased
   significantly two weeks after cutting in both species. These changes
   were relatively greater in Sesbania than in Leucaena. In the uncut
   treatments of both species, fine root and nodule biomass were correlated
   with leaf biomass, and in the cut treatments, root and nodule biomass
   returned to near this apparent equilibrium by two weeks after cutting.
   Stem growth rate per unit leaf area was not different between cut and
   uncut treatments, nor was it correlated with root:leaf ratios in either
   species. Leucaena allocated a greater fraction of its total biomass
   below-ground, and a greater fraction of its below-ground biomass to
   coarse (> 2 mm) roots than Sesbania. These results are consistent with
   the hypothesis that relatively lower allocation to below-ground storage
   tissue is the cause for Sesbania's relatively greater sensitivity to

Abstract = {In this study, a chemical modification of the polysaccharides extract
   (E) derived from Leucaena leucocephala seeds was performed to prepare
   C-glycosidic 2-propanol derivative (PE), and its sulphated derivative
   (SPE). This study aimed to characterize immunomodulatory activities of
   the original extract and its derivatives by exploring their effects on
   Raw macrophage 264.7 functions and their antioxidant activity. Our
   results indicated that PE was an effective radical scavenger to
   hydroxyl, peroxyl, and superoxide anion radicals, and SPE was a peroxyl
   radical scavenger. PE and SPE were found to influence the macrophage
   functions. Both of PE and SPE enhanced the macrophage proliferation and
   phagocytosis of FITC-zymosan; PE inhibited nitric oxide (NO) generation
   and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a.) secretion in lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS)-stimulated Raw macrophage 264.7. In contrast, SPE over-induced NO
   generation and TNF-alpha secretion. Moreover, PE strongly inhibited the
   binding affinity of FITC-LPS to Raw 264.7, as indicated by flow
   cytometry analysis. These findings revealed that PE may act as a potent
   antiinflammatory agent; however SPE may act as an inducer of macrophage
   functions against pathogens. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   immersion in water at 80 degrees C for 3 min (hydrothermal); immersions
   for 12 h in 3) water at 24 degrees C; 4) ethylic alcohol of 70 degrees
   GL; 5) organic thinner diluent, and 6) hydrogen peroxide diluted to 2
   \%. The seeds were deposited in a clay loam soil substrate and remained
   exposed to the weather protected by shade mesh. Total germination was
   higher with hydrothermal scarification (55\%) with respect to the other
   treatments, except for immersion in water (p > 0.05), but with this
   treatment the germinative energy and viability was the lowest. Immersion
   in water presented the highest germinative energy (31.66 \%), thus it
   improved germination velocity of the guaje seeds without affecting their
   germination value and viability. The hydrothermal scarification
   stimulated total germination and germination value, but it reduced
   germination velocity with respect to the other treatments, which showed
   intermediate values of germinative energy. Scarification with organic
   diluent caused the lowest value of germination (4 \%) and total
   germination (31 \%), respectively. The present study makes it possible
   to conclude that in guaje seeds scarification by immersion in water at
   24 degrees C for 12 h and in water at 80 degrees C for 3 min favored
   total germination, but immersion in water increased germination
   velocity.},

Abstract = {This study was investigated the removal of Pb2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+ from
   single and multicomponent aqueous solutions by Leucaena leucocephala.
   The point of zero charge and the specific surface area of the bio-based
   adsorbent were determined, and the Fourier-transform infrared
   spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques were used to
   characterize the biosorbent. The elemental composition before and after
   the heavy metal adsorption by this material was found using energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The effects of various parameters such as
   contact time (30-1,440 min), pH (2-10), initial adsorbate concentration
   (10-500 mg L-1) and biosorbent dosage (1-10 mg L-1) were examined.
   Biosorption capacity was found to be dependent on all of the parameters
   studied. The amount of metal ions sorbed by L. leucocephala increased as
   the radius of the cations decreased. Kinetic studies show that maximum
   uptake of Pb2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+ was reached within 60 min of contact for
   single and multicomponent solutions of these metallic ions. However,
   metal removal by biosorbent using a single metal ion solution was higher
   than that obtained using multicomponent solutions. Furthermore, the
   biosorption process of the metal ions followed a well-defined
   pseudo-secondorder model. The data's for the single and simultaneous
   removal of Pb2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+ were analyzed according to Langmuir and
   Freundlich isotherm models. The equilibrium data fit well in Freundlich
   isotherm model. After the biosorption process, L. leucocephala was
   treated with nitric acid at different concentrations to evaluate
   reusability.},

Volume = {77},

Abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) levels in agricultural soils are increasing because of
   industrial expansion and pesticide discharge. There are few plants that
   tolerate heavy metals particularly Cd. NaHS as hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
   donor plays a significant role in Cd tolerance by plants reducing its
   toxicity. The present research was oriented to evaluate the effect of
   NaHS in Cd and macro-/micronutrient uptake, as well as some physical and
   chemical parameters in Leucaena leucocephala plants exposed to this
   metal. Seedlings were grown in a hydroponic system and exposed to 5 ppm
   of Cd and NaHS at 1, 10, and 100 mu M for 3 days. Inductively coupled
   plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP/OES) was used to quantify Cd
   content and macro-/ micronutrients in plant tissues. Results show a
   significant difference (Fisher's LSD) in radicle length and chlorophyll
   but did not show effect on carotenoids content. Addition of NaHS to the
   media shows a significant increase in Cd uptake by root as NaHS
   concentration in media increased. The maximum Cd uptake (7670 +/- 102
   mg/kg) was found in the roots of plants exposed to 100 mu M of NaHS. A
   significant reduction in catalase (CAT) activity was observed in the
   root system, which is due to Cd concentration inside tissues. Results
   suggested that NaHS helps to decrease the toxic effect of Cd on the
   growth and development of plants.},

Title = {Identification of drought-induced genes in giant leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala subsp glabrata)},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {A number of drought-induced genes have been identified from giant
   leucaena.
   Leucaena leucocephala subspecies glabrata (leucaena), which is also
   known as `giant leucaena', is a multipurpose tree legume that can be
   grown and maintained as a woody tree for wood and paper pulp production,
   or as a shrubby legume through repeated harvest of foliage for use as a
   fodder. Leucaena is naturally resistant to most biotic and abiotic
   stresses including drought. The objective of this research was to
   identify drought-responsive genes in leucaena seedlings through
   microarray and qRT-PCR analyses. Ten thousand cDNA sequences selected
   from a leucaena transcriptome were screened for higher expression in a 4
   x 180 k microarray using RNA isolated from drought-treated and untreated
   leucaena seedlings. Microarray analysis identified 73 and 39
   drought-responsive genes sequences that were upregulated in the root and
   shoot, respectively. qRT-PCR analyses confirmed the root- and
   shoot-specific upregulation of some of the most highly expressed gene
   sequences identified in the microarray analysis. The proteins encoded by
   these genes could be grouped into four classes: (1) receptors that sense
   osmotic and oxidative stresses, (2) transcription factors, (3)
   degradation pathway enzymes, and (4) biosynthetic enzymes and structural
   proteins. The functions of these four classes of proteins can be used to
   explain the drought response in leucaena. The NB-LRR class of
   disease-resistance proteins may serve as receptors for detecting osmotic
   and oxidative stresses induced by drought, leading to induction of
   transcription factors such as zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein
   and TCP14. As result, the genes for some degradative pathway enzymes,
   such as GDSL esterase/lipase, lipid acyl hydrolase patatin, and serine
   carboxypeptidase, were induced. Similarly, the expression of certain
   biosynthetic enzymes and structural proteins such as flavonoid
   3-O-galactosyl transferase, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase,
   9-cis-epoxy carotenoid dioxygenase, beta-amyrin synthase,
   pentatricopeptide-containing protein, GPI-anchored protein COBRA, and
   peroxin, were also induced. High expression of some of these
   drought-inducible genes in leucaena seedlings may be used as a selection
   criterion in future breeding programs for drought resistance in leucaena
   and other legumes.},

   It is one of the key issues in slope ecological restoration that how to

   resistance, shear strength of soil-fibrous root systems and tensile
   strength of root systems were tested to evaluate the effects of L.
   leucocephala seedlings on soil conservation and slope protection and its
   temporal variation within 12 months after being planted. The results
   showed that the average height and root biomass of L. leucocephala
   seedlings reached 208.1cm and 46.6g. The erosion resistance, scour
   resistance and shear strength of its soil-root system were increased by
   288.4 \%, 198.6\% and 226.4\% contrast with that of the control,
   respectively. The effects of its soil-root system on soil conservation
   and slope stabilization increased with the prolonging of plant growth
   time constantly, and during six month to seven, it grow the fastest.
   Correlation analysis indicated that the performance of soil root systems
   had significant positive correlation with root system biomass. It
   suggested that the differences in root system biomass caused the changes
   of root systems in soil conservation and slope stabilization. L.
   leucocephala seedlings over seven month old had very obvious effects on
   soil conservation and slope stabilization with good ability to
   establish, can be used practically for the ecological restoration of
   engineering slopes.},

Pages = {387-398},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a tropical tree-legume, known for
   its high level of tolerance to various stress conditions including
   drought and diseases. We hypothesised that leucaena contains a specific
   set of genes for tolerance to various abiotic and biotic stresses, which
   may be either absent or not expressed in other legumes that are
   susceptible to these stress conditions. Interspecies suppression
   subtractive hybridisation (iSSH) was used to identify some
   leucaena-specific genes using cDNAs from leucaena and Acacia confusa
   (acacia) as the tester and driver, respectively. Ninety-six leucaena
   genes showing homologies to various plant genes with known functions and
   46 other genes encoding hypothetical proteins (hyps) were identified.
   Twenty-two genes encoded various stress-related proteins including
   chitinase, PR-10 protein, type 2 metallothionein, thaumatin-like
   protein, germin-like protein (GLP), molybdenum cofactor sulfurase
   (MCSU), aldehyde dehydrogenase, cysteine proteinase and Kunitz trypsin
   inhibitor. Conserved domain (CD) and position-specific iterative
   (PSI)-BLAST analyses predicted the possible functions of 15 hyps. The
   possible functions of the remaining hyps were predicted on the basis of
   various linear motifs. Six stress-related genes and 22 hyps were
   identified that expressed at higher levels under drought conditions in
   leucaena. The stress-related genes of leucaena identified through iSSH
   provide a foundation for future studies of molecular bases of stress
   tolerance in leucaena. These genes may also serve as a useful source of
   stress-tolerant genes for crop improvement in the future.},

   seed powder. Maximum biosorption capacity for As (III) and As (V) was
   found to be 81.88 and 92.61 \%, respectively. Amino acid-arsenic
   interaction has been highlighted on the basis of shifting of FTIR bands
   of native LLSP. Morphological changes and reduction in pore area have
   been observed in modified LLSP. Modification on the native LLSP results
   into the increase in percentage sorption of As (III) and As (V) up to 85
   and 99 \%, respectively. Enhancement in the percentage sorption is due
   the increase in the stability of the biosorbent due to increase in the
   final decomposition temperature of the modified LLSP. The findings
   showed that L. leucocephala seed powder can easily be envisaged as a
   new, vibrant, low-cost biosorbent for arsenic clean-up operations.},

Title = {Porous hydrogel composite with whey protein isolate and galactomannans

Abstract = {The present study was aimed at curating a porous KCl crosslinked
   hydrogel with purified subabul galactomannans (SG) from the defatted
   seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) and kappa-carrageenan (kappa C)
   by inducing whey protein isolate (WPI). WPI showed 345\% foam overrun
   and minimal foam drainage (\%) at 70 degrees C when whipped for 5 min at
   pH 6.8 in the hydrogel prepared with 6.5\% w/v SG + 1\% w/v kappa C +
   0.63\% w/v KCl + 2\% w/v WPI. The SG and WPI incorporated porous
   hydrogel (SGWP) showed maximum G ` (3010 Pa) and frequency independence
   (>30 Hz) at 65 degrees C. NMR (H-1), scanning electron microscopy, and
   thermal characterization of SGWP showed a crosslinked microporous gel
   network formation. SGWP had high water uptake rate (Q) (432\%) at 45
   degrees C. The stability of SGWP at neutral pH and high temperature (65
   degrees C) added an impetus to this study as it could be used for a wide
   range of applications. Hence the protein-polysaccharide complexation
   improvised the functional properties of the porous hydrogels. The
   results suggested a possible valorization of galactomannans from
   subabul, a forest resource, into a porous hydrogel suitable as a matrix
   for delivery of bioactive(s) or an aerogel for multifarious industrial
   applications. Practical ApplicationA porous hydrogel is defined as a
   solid, or collection of solid bodies, with sufficient open space to
   enable a fluid to pass through or around them. Leucaena leucocephala
   seed (forest resource) galactomannans are non-starch polysaccharides
   having weak gelling capacity. Whey protein isolates (WPI) are a dairy
   industry byproduct having excellent foaming properties. Incorporation of
   WPI in the hydrogel prepared with subabul galactomannan and
   kappa-carrageenan using KCl as a crosslin could form a stable porous
   structure having high water uptake rate (Q) at neutral pH and elevated
   temperature. The hydrogel so developed could be a step toward circular
   economy.},

Abstract = {Angiospermic caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) conventionally
   catalyzes the methylation of caffeic acid as well as 5-hydroxy ferulic
   acid to ferulic acid and sinapic acid, respectively, using
   S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as methyl group donor. A cDNA of OMT from
   Leucaena leucocephala (LlOMT) was cloned, expressed and purified. The
   expressed protein was purified to homogeneity on Ni-NTA agarose column
   with specific activity of 450 nmol of ferulic acid formed/min/mg
   protein. Native molecular weight of the purified enzyme was found to be
   80 kDa and that of subunit molecular weight was found to be 40 kDa,
   suggesting the homodimeric nature of the enzyme. The optimum temperature
   and pH was found to be 37 degrees C and pH 8.0, respectively. Apparent
   K-m of enzyme for caffeic acid and SAM was found to be 220 mu M and 2.12
   mu M, respectively. In view of overlapping/metabolic grid concept of
   methylation of substrates in phenyl propanoid pathway, an in silk
   approach was used to look into it. Accordingly, the LlOMT protein was
   modeled and docked with 16 putative substrates (intermediates of phenyl
   propanoid/monolignol biosynthesis pathway). In silico analyses revealed
   that the Co-A ester substrates were most favored among those of
   substrates, analyzed. 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A sixteen-week study was conducted to investigate the effects of
   mimosine and tannin toxicity on rabbits (Orytolagus cunniculus) fed
   processed Leucaena leucocephala leaves (LLL). Thirty-six growing rabbits
   (mixed breed) of average weight of 625 g were used for the experiment.
   The rabbits were randomly allotted to nine experimental groups of four
   rabbits each in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement. LLL were either sun dried
   (SDLLL), hot water processed (HWLLL) or ensiled (ELLL) for six weeks and
   included in three diets at 0, 10 and 20\% levels respectively. Data were
   collected on feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio and other
   performance characteristics of the fed rabbits. The data collected were
   subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) while the significant means
   were separated using Duncan's multiple range test. The anti-nutritional
   analysis showed that SDLLL contained highest tannin (1.20\%) and
   mimosine (1.64\%) contents but HWLLL had the least tannin (0.77\%) and
   mimosine (1.25\%) respectively. The best feed conversion ratio (FCR) of
   4.41(b) and the highest (P < 0.05) weight gain were recorded by rabbits
   fed diets containing ELLL. The interaction effects showed that rabbits
   fed diets containing 20\% SDLLL had alopaecia, necrotic spots, liver
   congestion, edema and highest percentage mortality. It was concluded
   that diets containing more than 1\% of mimosine and tannin impaired the
   growth performance and had deleterious effects on liver of the rabbits.},

Abstract = {A cDNA encoding cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), catalyzing
   conversion of cinnamyl aldehydes to corresponding cinnamyl alcohols, was
   cloned from secondary xylem of Leucaena leucocephala. The cloned cDNA
   was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Temperature
   and Zn2+ ion played crucial role in expression and activity of enzyme,
   such that, at 18 degrees C and at 2 mM Zn2+. the CAD was maximally
   expressed as active enzyme in soluble fraction. The expressed protein
   was purified 14.78-folds to homogeneity on Ni-NTA agarose column with
   specific activity of 346 nkat/mg protein. The purified enzyme exhibited
   lowest Km with cinnamyl alcohol (12.2 mu M) followed by coniferyl (18.1
   mu M) and sinapyl alcohol (23.8 mu M). Enzyme exhibited high substrate
   inhibition with cinnamyl (beyond 20 mu M) and coniferyl (beyond 100 mu
   M) alcohols. The in silico analysis of CAD protein exhibited four
   characteristic consensus sequences, GHEXXGXXXXXGXXV: C-100, C-103,
   C-106, C-114: GXGXXG and C-47, S-49, H-60, L-95, C-163, I-300 involved
   in catalytic Zn2+ binding, structural Zn2+ binding, NADP(+) binding and
   substrate binding, respectively. Tertiary structure, generated using
   Modeller 9v5, exhibited a trilobed structure with bulged out structural
   Zn2+ binding domain. The catalytic Zn2+ binding, substrate binding and
   NADP(+) binding domains formed a pocket protected by two major lobes.
   The enzyme catalysis, sequence homology and 3-D model, all supported
   that the cloned CAD belongs to alcohol dehydrogenase family of plants.

Abstract = {Mature pods of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit were utilized as raw

   begins with L. leucocephala fiber's alkaline treatment with sodium

   was then conducted to obtain NCC, which was comprehensively
   characterized in terms of morphology, chemical functional groups,
   whiteness index, and crystallinity. Fourier-transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) and chemical composition results showed that alkali
   treatment (NaOH) and bleaching (3\%, 5\%, and 7\% of sodium
   hypochlorite, NaClO) were effective in the removal of lignin and
   hemicellulose. The variation of sodium hypochlorite concentration
   affected physical and structural characteristics of the NCC produced,
   which exhibited a rod-shaped structure with diameters ranging from 17 to
   49 nm. These observations provide insight into the potential utilization

Abstract = {Fine root is critical to restrain soil erosion and its distribution

   studied the fine root biomass (B (r) ) distribution of different aged
   Leucaena leucocephala (5, 10, 15 years) in debris flow source area in

   slowly by 38\% from 10 years to 15 years. The B (r) of 5 years was
   significantly asymmetric between uphill and alonghill directions, but
   there was little difference among directions for other ages, and a
   concentration trend appeared to exist in downhill and alonghill
   directions. Moreover, fine root (Da parts per thousand currency sign1
   mm) was significantly heavier than that of fine root (1mm < Da parts per
   thousand currency sign2 mm), playing a leading role in the vertical
   distribution of the whole fine root, with a logarithmic or an

   research farm on 24 West African dwarf goats of 2-3 years of age, each
   in the dry season (November 2001 to April 2002) and rainy season (March
   to September 2003). At the beginning, two bucks were introduced to the
   herd for 2 months and breeding allowed. The males were removed
   thereafter and the herd divided in two groups. One group was subjected
   to supplementary feeding with C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala leaves
   harvested in the morning, mixed in equal quantities by weight and
   distributed at the rate of 800 g per goat and per day. The other group
   not supplemented, thus served as control. Animals were weighed at the
   beginning of the supplementation, before kidding, after kidding and
   every 2 weeks until weaning. Supplementation reduced the incidence of
   abortion and increased the overall yield of kid per animal. During the 3
   months postpartum period, the body weight decreased as compared to that
   recorded at parturition but the supplemented goats continued to have
   11-15\% more body weight than their respective control during the dry
   season whereas during the rainy season the difference between
   supplemented and non-supplemented goats were not so elaborated. This
   indicates the effect of the scope and importance of the supplementation
   for those animals particularly during the dry season whereas during the
   rainy season the difference between supplemented and non-supplemented
   goats were not so elaborated. This indicates the effect of the scope and

   experimental group were fed sun-dried pelleted Leucaena leucocephala
   leaves and those in the control group were offered a conventional diet
   without Leucaena leaves as per Kearl (1982) recommendations for a period
   of 6 months. Daily dry matter intake DMI/100 kg BW was 3.13 +/- 0.04 kg

   and 66.10\%, respectively in the control. The nitrogen in the Leucaena
   group was not well utilized as compared to the control, though kids were
   in positive nitrogen balance in both the groups. The average daily 2.60
   g as against 42.09 +/- 3.24 g observed in the control. The mean DMI/kg
   LW gain was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the Leucaena group (14.70

Abstract = {The effect of pruning on the dynamics of N release in the root zone of
   Albizia lebbeck and Leucaena leucocephala was studied using potted soil
   and minilysimeters with presterilized sand-medium supplied with N-free
   nutrient solution. Plants were pruned twice at 11: and 13 months and
   leachates were collected weekly for 16 weeks starting from first
   pruning, and analysed for mineral N content. Removal of plant shoots
   reduced nodule and root biomass by some 30-38\% and halved nodule N
   yields, while total N yields did not differ between pruned and unpruned
   plants. The dynamics of N nutrient in: the rhizosphere was also affected
   by pruning, irrespective of the growth medium. In soil culture, unpruned
   plants of both species maintained greater levels of total N in their
   rhizosphere compared to those that were pruned. In sand culture,
   nitrate-N was by 66-84\% the predominant N form in soil leachate across
   the two sequential prunings, Over the 16 weeks following these prunings
   of A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala, cumulative mineral N in both forms
   was significantly higher in the root zone of unpruned plants, and was
   consistently greater under rhizobial inoculation, Less mineral N was
   released into the root zone of each species during the period after the
   second pruning than after the first one. L. leucocephala released
   significantly more N than A. lebbeck over the sampling period, but net N
   release beneath both species was lower than 1\%, indicating that tree
   legumes do not release sizeable proportions of their N into root zone,
   and that pruning reduces their N release still further.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae family) is one of the plants used in the
   traditional medicine for the treatment of many diseases. The objective
   of the present work was to evaluate phytochemically and biologically
   different extracts of L. leucocephala flowers, grown in Jordan. Total
   phenols and total flavonoid contents and antioxidant activities of the
   water, 70\% ethanol and n-butanol extracts of the fresh flowers were
   determined. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antimicrobial
   activity of the extracts was evaluated using the dilution method.
   Microculture tetrazolium assay (MTT) was used to measure the
   antiproliferative activity. The toxicity of the extracts was assessed
   using Brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA). The chemical composition of
   the n-butanol extract, the most potent extract, was determined by liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). LC-MS evaluation of the
   n-butanol extract revealed the presence of 23 compounds. It showed the
   highest phenolic content (gallic acid equivalent - 321.087 mg/g) and the
   highest flavonoid content (rutin equivalent - 210.388 mg/g). It
   exhibited highest antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus
   (MIC = 0.390 +/- 0.002 mg/mL) and highest antiproliferative activity
   against T47D (IC50 = 0.094 +/- 0.01 mg/mL). None of the tested extracts
   exhibited toxicity.},

Abstract = {A total of 157 New Zealand White rabbits were used in three separate
   experiments to determine the performance of growing rabbits which
   received leaves of the browse plants - Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena
   (leucocephala as green feeds. Feeding of gliricidia allowed for the
   daily consumption of 65.1 g of pelleted concentrates and this was
   significantly (P<0.05) higher than the pellet intake of 52.7 g for the
   leucaena-fed rabbits. On a dry matter basis rabbits consumed 7.17 g of
   leucaena leaves or 5.86 g of gliricidia leaves daily, suggesting that
   leucaena was more palatable. In all the studies the daily rates of gain
   ranged from 18.1 to 21.2 g for the gliricidia-fed rabbits and from 13.5
   to 14.3 g for the leucaena-fed rabbits. The differences were
   statistically significant (P<0.01). The feed/gain ratio of 3.07 for the
   gliricidia-fed rabbits was significantly (P<0.01) higher than the value
   of 3.91 for the leucaena-fed rabbits. Leucaena-fed rabbits produced
   reddish-brown urine and showed serious loss of hair. They also had very
   dark and tender liver which had a lower \% (2.72\%) of body weight when
   compared with 3.06\% for the gliricidia-fed rabbits and 2.94\% for the
   rabbits which received no green feed. Histological examination showed
   that kidneys and livers of rabbits which received no green feed had
   normal and well preserved architecture. Kidneys of leucaena-fed rabbits
   showed serious degenerative changes in the tubules while the
   gliricidia-fed rabbits had mild degenerative changes of the tubules. The
   livers of the leucaena-fed rabbits showed a dense chronic inflammatory
   reaction in the portal tracts. The livers of the gliricidia-fed rabbits
   had relatively well preserved architecture. The degenerative effects
   noted in the livers and kidneys of leucaena-fed rabbits as well as the
   poor performance of these rabbits may be attributed to mimosine. The
   results suggested that gliricidia is a better green feed than leucaena
   for rabbits. It is recommended that leucaena should not constitute more
   than 50\% of the green feed given to rabbits (or more than 7\% of the
   feed dry matter).},

   with textile effluent was collected from Erode (chithode) area. Various
   physico-chemical characterizations like N, P, and K and electrical
   conductivity were assessed on both control and dye contaminated soils
   before and after remediation. Sababul (L. leucocephala) powder used as
   plant biomass for remediation was a tool for textile dye removal using
   basic synthetic dyes by column packing and eluting. The concentration of
   the dye eluted was compared with its original concentration of dye and
   were analyzed by using UV-vis spectrophotometer. Sababul plant biomass
   was analyzed for its physico-chemical properties and active compounds
   were detected by GC-MS, HPTLC and FTIR. Plant growth was assessed with
   green gram on the textile contaminated soil and sababul had the
   potential of adsorbing the dye as the contaminated soil and also check

Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of feed
   restriction on intake of Moringa oleifera (MO) or Leucaena leucocephala
   (LL) and growth of rabbits. In experiment one, 45 rabbits (male and
   female) weighing 1.18 +/- 0.15 kg were used. They were randomly
   distributed to three feed restriction treatments (20, 30, and 40\%) with
   15 rabbits each (9 females and 6 males) and they were offered M.
   oleifera (MO) ad libitum. In experiment two, 45 growing male rabbits
   weighing 0.63 +/- 0.113 kg were used. They were randomly assigned to 0,
   20, and 30\% feed restriction diets, and they have free access to L.
   leucocephala (LL). Intake of MO increased (P < 0.05) conforming feed
   restriction increased (40.6, 52.9, and 55.2 g/day of MO for 20, 30, and
   40\%, respectively). Daily liveweight gain and feed conversion did not
   differ (P > 0.05), and economic efficiency was similar among treatments.
   Consumption of LL increased (P < 0.05) in rabbits under the 30\%
   restriction treatment in comparison to that of rabbits restricted 20\%
   (46.0 and 44.4 g/day, respectively). Total feed intake (LL + feed) was
   highest in 20\% restricted rabbits (108.0, 100.8, and 93.2 g/day for 20,

   improved twice in feed-restricted rabbits (2.0 and 2.3 for 20 and 30\%,

   results suggest that rabbits restricted up to 30\% and supplemented with

Abstract = {This experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of including

   as tropical feed resources at two levels (30 or 40 \%) on growth
   performance, carcass traits, and economical efficiency of growing

   and were allocated individually; the groups were control, 30 \% LLM, 40
   \% LLM, 30 \% MOLM, and 40 \% MOLM. The experimental period lasted from
   6 to 12 weeks of age. The results showed that rabbits fed control and 30
   \% MOLM diets had significantly the highest final body weight and daily
   weight gain being 2,040 and 2,000 g and 31.6 and 30.6 g/day,
   respectively. Similarly, the best feed conversion ratio was associated
   with 30 \% MOLM and control groups (3.2 and 3.4), while the worst value
   was for 40 \% LLM group (5.2). MOLM treatments recorded significantly
   the highest dressing percentage along with control group. The inclusion
   of MOLM by 30 and 40 \% improved the economical efficiency (2 and 1.5)

Abstract = {Structural and histochemical features of the hilar region in the seed of
   Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (De Wit) were investigated by bright-field
   and fluorescence light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In
   the dry seeds the lens appeared as an elliptical depression prevailing
   in size over the hilum and micropyle. In the imbibed seeds, both
   naturally softened seed and those requiring softening with boiling
   water, the lens rose gradually to form a cavity between the palisade
   layer and the mesophyll below. This apoplastic pathway was traced using
   Ruthenium Red dye. In place of the hour-glass cells, the hilar region
   contained abnormal cells, called `white cells' because they remained
   unstained by Toluidine Blue O at pH 4.4. The apparently opposing
   characteristics of the lens are discussed. It is hypothesized that the
   lens acts as a valve. By remaining closed it hinders the entry of water
   because of the presence of a high light-line rich in callose and in
   lipid-like substances and to the almost total lack of hydrophilic
   polysaccharide material. Under favourable conditions for germination,
   the lens opens, allowing water to enter, through a thin palisade layer
   and with the probable intervention of the `white cells'.

Abstract = {The study deals with phytoextraction of Zn and Cd by Leucaena

   increasing distance from the effluent drain. Plant nitrogen fixation
   potential and soil micro-biochemical attributes against metal stress
   were also assessed. Increasing soil metal content and plant growth
   enhanced metal accumulation. Relatively greater amount of Zn than Cd was
   accumulated by L. leucocephala, which exceeded in roots with that of
   other parts. Remediation factor for Cd was maximum (3.6\%) in S2 grown
   plant. Nodule numbers, their biomass, nitrogenase activity, and

Abstract = {Mimosine is a non-protein amino acid of Fabaceae, such as Leucaena spp.
   and Mimosa spp. Several relevant biological activities have been
   described for this molecule, including cell cycle blocker, anticancer,
   antifungal, antimicrobial, herbivore deterrent and allelopathic
   activities, raising increased economic interest in its production. In
   addition, information on mimosine dynamics in planta remains limited. In
   order to address this topic and propose strategies to increase mimosine
   production aiming at economic uses, the effects of several
   stress-related elicitors of secondary metabolism and UV acute exposure
   were examined on mimosine accumulation in growth room-cultivated
   seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala spp. glabrata. Mimosine concentration
   was not significantly affected by 10 ppm salicylic acid (SA) treatment,
   but increased in roots and shoots of seedlings treated with 84 ppm
   jasmonic acid (JA) and 10 ppm Ethephon (an ethylene-releasing compound),
   and in shoots treated with UV-C radiation. Quantification of mimosine
   amidohydrolase (mimosinase) gene expression showed that ethephon yielded
   variable effect over time, whereas JA and UV-C did not show significant
   impact. Considering the strong induction of mimosine accumulation by
   acute UV-C exposure, additional in situ ROS localization, as well as in
   vitro antioxidant assays were performed, suggesting that, akin to
   several secondary metabolites, mimosine may be involved in general
   oxidative stress modulation, acting as a hydrogen peroxide and
   superoxide anion quencher.},

Title = {Influence of exogenous ethylene on cambial activity, xylogenesis and ray
   initiation in young shoots of Leucaena leucocephala (lam.) de Wit},
Journal = {FLORA},

Volume = {208},
Number = {10-12},
Pages = {549-555},
Abstract = {The effect of exogenous ethephon on cambial activity, xylem production
   and ray population in young shoots of Leucaena leucocephala was
   investigated anatomically. The application of ethephon showed a diphasic
   effect on cambial activity and xylogenesis in a dose dependent manner.
   Lower concentration of ethephon enhanced cambial activity while high
   concentrations reduced cambial cell divisions and daughter-cell
   differentiation. High ethephon concentration also resulted in shorter
   vessel elements, thick walled fibers and phenolic accumulation in ray
   cells and vessel elements, whereas low concentration allowed elongation
   of fibers and vessel elements. The density of rays increased
   significantly with increase in ethylene concentration. The evaluation of
   longitudinal sections of cambial zone in ethephon treated plants showed
   high frequency of transformation of fusiform initials into ray initials
   through divisions and segmentation, resulting in high ray frequency in
   both xylem and phloem. The present study demonstrates that ethylene
   plays an important role in regulating secondary vascular tissue
   composition by reducing the population of fusiform initials in the
   cambium. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The MC (moisture content) and HHV (higher heating value) of Leucaena
   leucocephala pellets using NIR (near infrared) spectroscopy was
   investigated in this study. The MC of the pellets was adjusted by
   subjecting the samples to different relative humidity environments. The
   samples were scanned in diffuse reflection mode at wavenumbers of
   12,500-4000 cm(-1). Partial least squares regression models correlating
   the MC and HHV with the NIR spectra were developed and validated by full
   cross validation. The model for MC and HHV provided coefficients of
   determination (R-2) of 0.995 and 0.964, a root mean square error of
   cross validation (RMSECV) of 0.187\%wb and 79.2 J g(-1), bias of
   -0.0008\%wb and 1.29 J g(-1) and a RPD (ratio of prediction to
   deviation) of 13.9 and 530, respectively. The models had excellent
   accuracy. This rapid quality evaluation method may be used for trading
   of biomass pellets. An equation related MC and HHV was also developed.

Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Three to six-week old plants of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, cv
   K8, were grown hydroponically without root nodules. They showed much
   better growth response to nitrate than to ammonium. They were found to
   be tolerant to salinity of up to 50 mM NaCl. Effects of salinity in this
   range and moderate Na+ accumulation in young organs could be alleviated
   by supplying 10 mM nitrate to the medium. Na+ mainly accumulated in
   basal leaves and cotyledons as disposable organs. Distribution of Cl-
   was more uniform than of Na+, its exclusion from young organs by nitrate
   was less effective. K+ distribution in the plants was almost uniform and
   little affected by NaCl, while nitrate accumulated only in the roots and
   at high external concentrations. Nitrate uptake of N-starved plants
   initially showed higher rates, a minimum after 2 h and then increased
   during several hours suggesting a constitutive and an inducible
   transport component. Induction of nitrate assimilation was shown by
   nitrate reductase activity (EC 1.6.6.2). Nitrate uptake was not affected
   by 20 mM NaCl. In K+- and N-starved plants uptake rates of K+ roughly
   followed those of nitrate. In N-supplied plants nitrate reductase
   activity was found mainly in the roots, where in starved plants
   induction was also strongest. In the nutrient supplied culture salt
   treatment especially stimulated nitrate reductase activity in the roots.
   In general, counteraction of nitrate to salinity effects occurs in
   distribution of the ions within the plant but only at low salinity.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is an introduced species, which has been widely
   used in mountain ecological restoration in southwestern China. To
   investigate the allelopathic effects of decomposing L. leucocephala leaf
   litter, the photosynthetic physiology of seedlings of two recipient
   plants, Cynodon dactylon and Medicago sativa, were measured in this
   controlled study. As the amount of decomposing L. leucocephala leaf
   litter increased, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate
   (Tr), and stomatal conductance (Gs) decreased continuously, and the
   intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) increased continuously in both
   recipient plants. In M. sativa, all abovementioned indices differed
   significantly compared with the control group: Pn, Gs, and Tr decreased
   by 41.69, 59.35, and 48.02\%, respectively, and Ci increased by 28.53\%.
   In C. dactylon, Gs decreased significantly by 27.27\%. Analysis of the
   photosynthesis-light response curve indicated that the maximum net
   photosynthetic rate (Pn(max)) and dark respiration rate (Rd) of C.
   dactylon, as well as Pn(max) and light saturation point (Lsp) of M.
   sativa, decreased significantly as the amount of decomposing L.
   leucocephala leaf litter increased. These results indicated that the
   photosynthetic traits, light adaptation ability and physiological
   metabolism of recipient plants were affected by the treatment. The
   decreased photosynthesis was caused by the changes in pigments and
   soluble sugar contents induced by L. leucocephala leaf litter and is
   therefore considered to be associated with non-stomatal limitations. In
   addition, as the amount of decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter
   increased, M. sativa showed decreased chlorophyll (Chla) and carotenoid
   (Car) contents, while C. dactylon showed decreased Chla and Chl(a + b)
   contents. However, both recipient plants exhibited significantly
   increases in their soluble sugar content. Overall, M. sativa was more
   sensitive than C. dactylon to the allelopathic effects induced by
   decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter.},

Abstract = {The study was carried out to determine the chemical composition of
   composite pellets of Megathyrsus maximus containing Leucaena
   leucocephala seed meal at the varying level and growth responses, as
   well as haematological and serum biochemical of rabbits, fed the pellets

   leucocephala-100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30 and 60:40, respectively. Results
   revealed an increase (P < 0.05) in the proximate composition of the
   grass pellets with an increase in seed inclusion while there was a
   reduction (P < 0.05) in the NDF contents of the pellets. An increase in
   the tannin contents was recorded with an increase in seed inclusion to
   the grass pellets. Rabbits fed with 30 and 40\% inclusions of seed in
   the grass pellets had similar weight gain while the lowest feed
   conversion ratio was recorded in rabbits fed grass with 30\% seed
   inclusion. Packed cell volume, RBC and lymphocyte in rabbits were
   altered with feeding grass seed pellet (P < 0.05), although no
   particular pattern was followed. Total protein, globulin and urea
   contents were reduced in the rabbits as the contents of the seeds in the
   grass pellets increased. Albumin contents in pellets with 30\% of seeds
   were higher in the rabbits fed the pellets above other treatments. It
   can be concluded that increasing the seed meal level up to 30\% in grass
   pellets supported growth response without inflicting any side effects on
   the health indices of the rabbits.},

Abstract = {Invasive alien plants are considered as one of the major causes of loss
   of native biodiversity around the world. Remote sensing provides an
   opportunity to identify and map native and invasive species using
   accurate spectral information. The current study was aimed to evaluate
   PlanetScope (3 m) and Sentinel (10 m) datasets for mapping the
   distribution of native and invasive species in two protected areas in
   Pakistan, using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The multispectral data
   were analysed with the following four ML algorithms (classifiers)-random
   forest (RF), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN),
   and support vector machine (SVM)-to classify two invasive species,
   Lantana camara L. (common lantana) and Leucaena leucocephala L. The
   (Ipil-ipil) Dzetsaka plugin of QGIS was used to map these species using
   all ML algorithms. RF, GMM, and SVM algorithms were more accurate at
   detecting both invasive species when using PlanetScope imagery rather
   than Sentinel. Random forest produced the highest accuracy of 64\% using
   PlanetScope data. Lantana camara was the most dominating plant species
   with 23\% cover, represented in all thematic maps. Leucaena leucocpehala
   was represented by 7\% cover and was mainly distributed in the southern
   end of the Jindi Reserve Forest (Jhelum). It was not possible to
   discriminate native species Dodonea viscosa Jacq. (Snatha) using the SVM
   classifier for Sentinel data. Overall, the accuracy of PlanetScope was
   slightly better than Sentinel in term of species discrimination. These
   spectral findings provide a reliable estimation of the current
   distribution status of invasive species and would be helpful for land
   managers to prioritize invaded areas for their effective management.},

Abstract = {Due to the discriminate use of plant chemicals and their resultant
   negative impact on the environment, researchers are interested in
   monitoring plant behavior as modified by various nonchemical influences
   such as magnetic fields. A pot experiment was designed to assess the
   growth potential of Albizia procera Roxb. (Sufed Sirin) and Leucaena
   leucocephala Lam. (Ipil Ipil) seedlings, established from seeds exposed
   to a magnetic field (MF) of 75 millitesla for 3 different time
   intervals, 5 min, 10 min, and 15 min respectively. After the seeds were
   exposed to a MF of 75 mT for 15 min, A. procera plants showed 49\% more
   germination than in the control (41\%), whereas L. leucocephala plants
   gained 37\% more germination in the same treatment. A. procera had
   maximum plant height (13.1 cm) when seeds were exposed to a MF of 75 mT
   for 15 min, while the height gained by the control was only 7.1 cm.
   Similarly, L. leucocephala gained maximum plant height (17.8 cm) when
   seeds were treated with MF for 15 min, i.e. 137\% greater than the
   height gained from nontreated seeds (7.5 cm). Seed exposure to MFs also
   resulted in higher collar diameter in both plants. In high-MF-treated A.
   procera (18.6 cm) seedlings, root length was 3 times longer than in the
   control (6.5 cm); MF-treated L. leucocephala seedlings gained maximum
   (63\% longer) root length (18.9 cm), as well. A. procera had its maximum
   root-to-shoot ratio (R/S) (1.9) in the seedlings treated with low MF (5
   min), whereas L. leucocephala had its maximum R/S (1.6) in nontreated
   seeds. Seeds exposed to MF for 5 min resulted in minimum R/S (0.9). The
   results clearly suggested that by increasing the time intervals for seed
   exposure to the fixed MF of 75 mT, the sowed seeds of both species
   showed higher growth rate.},

Title = {Critical Insights Into the Ecological and Invasive Attributes of
   Leucaena leucocephala, a Tropical Agroforestry Species},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN AGRONOMY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAY 24},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (commonly known as leucaena) is a
   leguminous species of the family Fabaceae and a native of Mexico and
   Central America. It is often addressed as a ``miracle tree{''} for
   offering a wide variety of ecosystem services and possessing strong
   ecological attributes. The multiple uses of leucaena in agroforestry,
   livestock, and restoration practices led to the worldwide distribution
   of its ssp. glabrata and leucocephala. However, following its
   introduction into non-native regions, the commercial value of ssp.
   leucocephala was challenged by its large-scale spread outside the
   cultivation zone. It has assumed a status of an environmental weed and
   invasive plant in many regions across Africa (17 countries and Island
   nations), Asia (17), Europe (1), Oceania (23), North America (12), and
   South America (7). The plant is enlisted in the top five terrestrial
   invasive plant species with the greatest international presence. The
   species is now considered one of the 100 worst invaders in the world.
   The plant mainly invades roadsides, wastelands, cultivated lands,
   riverbanks, and forest edges, and suppresses the growth of other woody
   and herbaceous species. Its infestations alter the patterns of
   vegetation, plant succession, and community assembly in the introduced
   habitats. Propagation of ssp. leucocephala, without considering the
   environmental risks associated with it, may result in major
   repercussions and irreparable losses. Therefore, it is important to
   discuss its invasive propensities and the possible alternatives that may
   replace the weedy species without encumbering its economic benefits.
   This review aims to thoroughly evaluate the ecological and invasive
   attributes of leucaena, promote awareness about the ecological costs
   associated with its spread, and suggest suitable options for its
   management.},

Title = {Leucaena leucocephala leachate compromised membrane integrity,

Journal = {BOTANICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {54},
Abstract = {Background: Water hyacinth is an invasive aquatic weed in many regions
   of the world. In this study, the bioherbicidal potential of allelopathic
   plant Leucaena leucocephala against water hyacinth was investigated
   using a leaf disc assay.
   Results: L. leucocephala leachate enhanced electrolyte leakage from
   water hyacinth leaf discs in a concentration-dependent manner. Control
   experiments eliminated the possibilities that increased membrane
   permeability in the leachate-treated leaf discs was due to pH or osmotic
   effects of the leachate. Thus, the loss of membrane stability in the
   leachate-treated leaf discs was likely due to phytotoxins detected in
   the leachate, namely mimosine and phenolic constituents. Decline in
   tissue respiration was detected in leachate-treated water hyacinth leaf
   discs. This suggests that the L. leucocephala leachate may contain
   compounds which acted as respiratory inhibitors. Enhanced reactive
   oxygen species production coincided with inhibition of catalase and
   ascorbate peroxidase activities in the leachate-treated water hyacinth
   leaf tissues. The injurious effects of L. leucocephala leachate on water
   hyacinth leaf discs probably involved direct inhibition of antioxidant
   enzymes in addition to direct involvement of some allelochemicals in
   reactive oxygen species formation.
   Conclusion: In summary, the toxic effects of L. leucocephala leachate on
   water hyacinth leaf discs likely lay in its ability to effectively
   compromise the membrane integrity, tissue respiration and antioxidant
   defence of the latter.},

   fourth lactation were used to evalaute the effect of feeding 10
   kg/animal/day of cut, fresh Leucaena leucocephala forage (L), or 10
   kg/animal/day of wet brewers grains (C), and its combination (L+C) on
   milk yield and properties. All cows were fed a mixture of cut, fresh
   kinggrass (Pennisetum hybrid) and buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris). A
   change-over Latin Square experimental design was used, with two cows per
   treatment and three 4-week periods (March to June, 1994), each
   consisting of a 1-week adaptation period and a 3-week comparison period.
   Treatments only had direct effect on milk acidity, which was higher (P
   less than or equal to 0,05) for L+C (19 ml NaOH 0,1 N/100 ml) but within
   the normal range. No residual effects of treatments were detected (P >
   0,05) on any of the variables. Unadjusted means were: milk yield, 8,5
   kg/cow/day; fat and protein contents, 3,6 and 3,4\%, respectively, and
   density, 1,030. Milk odor and color at the end of comparison periods
   were not influenced by L. Changes in milk flavor with all treatments
   were small, not consistent and probably undetectable by consumers
   without proper training. When compared to C, L yielded economic profit
   due to lower costs, whereas the additional income obtained with L+C was
   outwheighed by its higher costs. Leucaena leucocephala was a
   satisfactory substitute for wet brewers grains, without affecting milk
   yield and properties.},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted in the western Himalayan mid hills for
   two consecutive years to study the hedgerow intercropping of Leucaena
   leucocephala with Ocimum basilicum. Leucaena hedgerows were spaced seven
   meters apart with three different plant spacing within the hedgerows and
   three different organic manures were applied to the intercrop. The
   results showed that closely spaced (0.50 m) Leucaena hedgerows
   negatively influenced various growth and yield attributes like plant
   height, number of inflorescence and economic yield of the associated
   herb as compared to its wider spacing (0.75 m and 1.50 m). The use of
   organic manures benefited the intercrop by improving the growth even in
   the presence of hedgerows as compared to control plots (without trees).
   Irrespective of the tree spacing the growth of O. basilicum was
   suppressed to a greater extent at a distance closer to the hedgerows in
   all the treatments.},

Abstract = {Removal of lignin is a major hurdle for obtaining good quality pulp.
   Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) is extensively used in paper industry in
   India; therefore, as a first step to generate transgenic plants with low
   lignin content, cDNA and genomic clones of CCR gene were isolated and
   characterized. The cDNA encoding CCR (EC 1.2.1.44) was designated as
   LI-CCR; the sequence analysis revealed an Open Reading Frame (ORF) of
   1005 bp. Phylogenetic analysis showed that LI-CCR sequence is highly
   homologous to CCRs from other dicot plants. The 2992 bp genomic clone of
   Leucaena CCR consists of 5 exons and 4 introns. The haploid genome of L
   leucocephala contains two copies as revealed by DNA blot hybridization.
   LI-CCR gene was over-expressed in Escherichia coli, which showed a
   molecular mass of approximately 38 kDa. Protein blot analysis revealed
   that LI-CCR protein is expressed at higher levels in root and in stem,
   but undetectable in leaf tissues. Expression of CCR gene in Leucaena
   increased up to 15 d in case of roots and stem as revealed by QRT-PcR
   studies in 0-15 d old seedlings. ELISA based studies of extractable CCR
   protein corroborated with QRT-PCR data. CCR protein was
   immuno-cytolocalized around xylem tissue. Lignin estimation and
   expression studies of 5,10 and 15 d old stem and root suggest that CCR
   expression correlates with quantity of lignin produced, which makes it a
   good target for antisense down regulation for producing designer species
   for paper industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia farnesiana are tree species used for
   several agricultural purposes in the Mediterranean region. The seeds of
   these species exhibit dormancy, causing delayed germination. Two
   experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of pre-sowing
   treatments (scarification, hot water, or soaking) on seed germination of
   L. leucocephala and A. farnesiana. In one experiment, seeds were exposed
   to three pre-sowing treatments: control, sandpaper scarification, or
   soaking in 70A degrees C water for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, or 24 min. In
   another experiment, seeds were soaked in 70A degrees C water for 20 min,
   and then soaked in water at room temperature for an additional 24, 48,
   or 72 h or blade scarified. In general, soaking the seeds of the two
   species in hot water was more effective in breaking seed dormancy than
   scarification. Sandpaper scarification was not effective for either
   species. Blade scarification increased A. farnesiana seed germination to
   56\%, indicating that seed dormancy was mainly a consequence of
   hardseededness. L. leucocephala seeds collected from Jordan University
   of Science and Technology (JUST) site and soaked in 70A degrees C water
   for 20 min and then soaked for 24, 48, or 72 h had germination rates
   above 97\%. Our results suggest that blade scarification of A.
   farnesiana seeds and soaking of L. leucocephala seeds in 70A degrees C
   water for 20 min are effective treatments to break seed dormancy and
   enhance seed germination of these vital species.},

   using 1,1-diphenyl 1-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and ferric
   reducing antioxidant powder methods. The LL-spl extract fraction with
   highest antioxidant capacity was used in animal treating. Male rats were
   divided into three groups (n=5); control and groups treated with LL-spl
   400 and 600 mg/Kg body weight for consecutive 40 days. The results
   showed that the LL-spl 40 min fraction possessed the highest antioxidant
   capacity. In addition, the LL-spl 400 and 600 groups showed no
   differences in weights of body, testis and epididymis, serum
   testosterone levels, and expression of testicular steroidogenic acute
   regulatory (StAR) protein. Significantly, LL-spl extract reduced the
   weight of seminal vesicle, sperm concentration, and seminiferous
   diameters compared with control. Moreover, LL-spl extract had adverse
   effect on testicular histology in inducing of seminiferous atrophy and
   degeneration including dilated blood vessels in interstitial tissue. It
   was concluded that although LL-spl extract possessing antioxidant
   capacity, in short term consumptions, it could be toxic to some male

   Four vegetable crops (Amaranthus cruentus L.; Celosia argentea L.; Okra,

   grown in control plots and in 4-m wide alleys between established

   Leucaena prunings yielded large dry biomass and nutrients during both
   seasons. Yield of four vegetable crops responded more to fertilizer in
   control than in alley cropped treatments. Better yield of vegetables in
   alley cropped plots was in part due to fallowing effect of the Leucaena
   hedgerows. Fertilizer application increased mean yields of Amaranthus,
   Celosia, okra and tomato by 325, 164, 47 and 94\% in control plots and

   Yield was least in control without fertilizer. Alley cropping with

   conjugate under acidic (pH 1.2) and alkaline conditions (pH 6.8). The
   treatment of prodrug with galactomannase (15 mg/mL) followed by esterase

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Composting is an environmental-friendly option for yard waste
   management, and produces products for improving soil quality. However,
   there is a weed dispersal risk if the compost contains many active weed
   seeds. This study assessed the potential of composting in minimizing the
   seed germination of a major tropical invasive weed, Leucaena
   leucocephala. The germination of the species was tested after two
   different sets of thermal treatments, i.e., (1) different constant
   temperatures (20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 50 degrees C, 60
   degrees C, and 70 degrees C) for 5 days, and (2) composting temperature
   (simulating the temperature profile of a typical composting process) for
   60 days. A three-month growth test was further conducted for the seeds
   treated with the composting temperature. The seeds were present either
   alone (N-seeds) or mixed with wood chips (W-seeds) when thermally
   treated. A constant temperature treatment of 70 degrees C suppressed the
   seed germination to a low rate. For the composting temperature
   treatment, the germination percentage of the N-seeds and W-seeds were
   reduced from around 60\% to 22.7\% and 12.7\%, respectively. This
   preliminary study suggested that the temperature should reach as high as
   70 degrees C in the composting process to guarantee the suppression of
   the germination of the seeds of L. leucocephala, particularly when the
   seeds are contained within seed pods during composting.},

Abstract = {Invasive legume Leucaena leucocephala nodulated with Ensifer strains
   harboring different combinations of core and sym gene.
   More than 200 root-nodule bacterial strains were isolated from Leucaena
   leucocephala growing at 42 sampling sites across 12 states and three
   union territories of India. Genetic diversity was observed among 114
   strains from various climatic zones; based on recA, these were
   identified as strains of Ensifer, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, and
   Bradyrhizobium. In multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) strains clustered
   into several novel clades and lineages. Ensifer were predominant
   nodulating genotype isolated from majority of alkaline soils, while
   Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium strains were isolated from a limited
   sampling in North-Eastern states with acidic soils. Positive nodulation
   assays of selected Ensifer representing different genetic combinations
   of housekeeping and sym genes suggested their broad host range within
   the closely related mimosoid genera Vachellia, Senegalia, Mimosa, and
   Prosopis. Leucaena selected diverse strains of Ensifer and Mesorhizobium
   as symbionts depending on available soil pH, climatic, and other edaphic
   conditions in India. Lateral gene transfer seems to play a major role in
   genetic diversification of Ensifer exhibited in terms of Old World vs.
   Neotropical genetic make-up and mixed populations at several sites.
   Although Neotropical Ensifer strains were most symbiotically effective
   on Leucaena, the native Ensifer are promiscuous and particularly
   well-adapted to a wide range of sampling sites with varied climates and
   edaphic factors.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to determine the mimosine level and examine the male
   reproductive toxicity effects of Leucaena leucocephala (LL) shoot tips
   plus young leaf extract. Mimosine level in LL extract was determined by
   thin layer chromatography before administration in animals. Male rats
   were divided into control and LL (1,500 mg/KgBW) groups (n = 6). After
   60 days of experiment, serum sex hormones, sperm quality, and testicular
   histopathology were assayed and observed. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level
   and expressions of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) and
   phosphorylated proteins in testicular lysate were examined by western
   blotting. Results showed that mimosine levels in LL extract was 17.35
   +/- 1.12 \% of dry weight. LL significantly decreased FSH \& LH levels,
   sperm qualities, and seminiferous tubule diameter compared to the
   control (p<0.05). Seminiferous tubular atrophies, germ cell sloughing,
   and degenerations were observed in LL group. In addition, testicular MDA
   level and StAR protein expression were significantly decreased in LL
   group. LL extract could increase the expression of a 50 kDa phohorylated
   protein in testicular lysate. In conclusion, LL extract has mimosine and
   reproductive toxicity effects on males.},

Abstract = {Extracts of brown lead (Leucaena leucocephala) seed prepared using
   different extraction solvents were determined for antioxidative
   activities using different assays. The highest yield (3.4-4.0\%) was
   obtained when water was used as an extraction solvent, compared with all
   ethanolic extracts used (1.2-2.0 \%) (P< 0.05). Much lower chlorophyll
   content was found in the water extract. When hot water was used, the
   resulting extract contained lower total phenolic and mimosine contents
   (P< 0.05). In general, 60-80 \% ethanolic extracts had higher
   2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH),
   2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical
   scavenging activities, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and
   metal chelating activity than water extracts (P< 0.05). When brown lead
   seed was dechlorophyllised prior to extraction, the water extract had
   slightly increased yield with lower chlorophyll content. Nevertheless,
   prior chlorophyll removal resulted in the increase in antioxidative
   activities but lower total phenolic and mimosine contents (P< 0.05).
   Generally, phenolic compounds and mimosine were more released when water
   was used as the extraction solvent, while the lower amount of
   chlorophyll was extracted. Oven-drying exhibited the negative effect on
   antioxidative activities and mimosine content. The higher antioxidative
   activities with concomitant higher total phenolic and mimosine contents
   were found in water extract dried by freeze drying. Thus, extraction
   solvent, dechlorophyllisation and drying methods directly influenced the
   yield and antioxidative activity of lead seed extract.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the structural features, antioxidant
   activity, tyrosinase inhibitory effect, and mechanism of
   proanthocyanidins from leaf and fruit of Leucaena
   leucocephala.MALDI-TOF-MS, thiolysis coupled with HPLC-ESI-MS, and
   C-13-NMR confirmed that these proanthocyanidins were complex mixtures of
   propelargonidins, procyanidins, and prodelphinidins. (Epi)catechin,
   (epi)gallocatechin, (epi)catechin gallate, and (epi)gallocatechin
   gallate were the main constitutive units. The findings obtained from
   enzyme analysis revealed that the proanthocyanidins had inhibitory
   effects on both monophenolase and diphenolase of tyrosinase. The IC50
   values of leaf and fruit proanthocyanidins were 73.5 +/- 2.7 and 52.3
   +/- 3.5 mu g/mL for monophenolase activity, and 27.2 +/- 1.4 and 16.1
   +/- 1.1 mu g/mL for diphenolase activity, respectively. The inhibition
   of diphenolase by proanthocyanidins were proved to be reversible and
   mixed type. In addition, it was also found from various antioxidant
   methods that the proanthocyanidins in leaf and fruit possessed potent
   DPPH radical scavenging activity with IC50 values of 103.4 +/- 0.8 and
   87.8 +/- 1.1 mu g/mL, ABTS radical scavenging activity with IC50 values

Abstract = {Phyllanthus niruri is widely used in Indonesia as immunostimulant. The
   morphology of Leucaena leucocephala leaves is similar to that of P.
   niruri leaves. L. leucocephala is easy to find and collect because it is
   widely distributed in the world. Therefore, it is likely P. niruri could
   be adulterated with L. leucocephala. Therefore, identification and
   authentication of P. niruri is important to ensure the raw materials
   used are original without any substitution or mixture with other similar
   plants causing inconsistencies in their efficacy. In this paper, we
   described feasibility used of UV-Vis spectral fingerprinting and
   chemometrics for rapid method for the identification and detection of P.
   niruri leaves adulterated with L. leucocephala leaves. UV-Vis spectra of
   samples measured in the interval of 200-800 nm and signal smoothing
   followed by standard normal variate were used for pre-processing the
   spectral data. Principal component analysis (PCA) with the absorbance
   data from the pre-processed UV-Vis spectra in the range of 250-700 nm as
   variables could distinguish P. niruri from L. leucocephala. PCA followed
   by discriminant analysis (DA) could successfully classified P. niruri
   mixed with 5, 25, and 50\% L. luecocephala into their respective groups
   (96.81\%). We also employed soft independent modelling of class analogy
   (SIMCA) for authentication of P. niruri and found that 88.3\% of the
   samples were also correctly classified into their respective groups. A
   combination of UV-Vis spectroscopy with chemometrics, such as PCA-DA and
   SIMCA, were used for the first time for the identification and detection
   of P. niruri adulterated with L. leucocephala.},

Abstract = {Field trials to study the growth and biomass production of Leucaena
   leucocephala and Vitex negundo in relation to their age and season of

   10 months (in February) to 18 months (in October) did not result in
   statistically significant increase in biomass production of Leucaena.
   The yield on per plant and unit area basis was higher in coppiced stands
   than original stands of Leucaena and Vitex. The highest increase in
   biomass production of Leucaena was recorded between 18 and 20 months
   harvesting age. Harvesting in December was found the best for Leucaena.
   Vitex registered rapid growth during the period from summer untill the
   rainy season. The post-harvest conditions for coppice development, the

Abstract = {This study focused on utilization of Leucaena leucocephala seeds'
   extract and iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) under magnetic field to
   provide effective coagulation process. Leucaena seeds' extract was
   obtained using 3 M NaCl solution as solvent at feed-to-solvent mass
   ratio of 1:20. IONPs were synthesized using co-precipitation method. The
   obtained IONPs were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray
   diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Based on analysis
   results, the obtained IONPs were the agglomerate of Fe3O4 phase with
   average particle diameter of 14.6 nm. The extract and IONPs were used as
   natural coagulant at various pHs (3-12), coagulant dosages (4-40 mL
   extract/L), and IONPs concentrations (0.5-3 mg/mL extract) under
   external magnetic field. It was obtained that pH 3 was the best pH
   because positively charged Leucaena protein at pH 3 acts to neutralize
   negatively charged Congo red molecules. The highest removal was obtained
   at coagulant dosage of 20 mL/L, and further increase in dosage was
   decreasing the removal due to colloid re-stabilization effect. The
   variation of IONPs concentration did not give any effect on the
   \%removal and sludge volume. However, further investigation using
   pseudo-second-order kinetic model showed that the increase in IONPs
   concentration gave increase to the kinetic constant, signifying faster
   settling kinetics. The best condition was obtained at pH 3, coagulant
   dosage 20 mL/L, and IONPs concentration of 3 mg/mL extract that gave
   90\% Congo red removal, 30 mL/L sludge volume, and 30 min settling time.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the role of
   1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase of symbionts in
   nodulation and growth of Leucaena leucocephala. The acdS genes encoding
   ACC deaminase were cloned from Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 and
   Sinorhizobium sp. BL3 in multicopy plasmids, and transferred to TAL1145.
   The BL3-acdS gene greatly enhanced ACC deaminase activity in TAL1145
   compared to the native acdS gene. The transconjugants of TAL1145
   containing the native or BL3 acdS gene could grow in minimal media
   containing 1.5 mM ACC, whereas BL3 could tolerate up to 3 mM ACC. The
   TAL1145 acdS gene was inducible by mimosine and not by ACC, while the
   BL3 acdS gene was highly inducible by ACC and not by mimosine. The
   transconjugants of TAL1145 containing the native- and BL3-acdS genes
   formed nodules with greater number and sizes, and produced higher root
   mass on L. leucocephala than by TAL1145. This study shows that the

Journal = {VETERINARY WORLD},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {18},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background and Aim: The inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal
   (LLM) in poultry feed is often limited due to its high crude fiber and
   mimosine content. This study investigates the potential of fermented LLM
   (FLM) to enhance nutrient intake, egg production, and egg quality in
   laying quails by reducing anti-nutritional factors through fermentation.
   Materials and Methods: Two hundred 42-day-old laying quails were
   assigned to five dietary treatments: T0 (control) = 100\% basal diet
   (BD), T1 = 98\% BD + 2\% FLM, T2 = 96\% BD + 4\% FLM, T3 = 94\% BD + 6\%
   FLM, and T4 = 92\% BD + 8\% FLM. Parameters including nutrient intake
   (energy, protein, fat, calcium, phosphorus), feed conversion ratio
   (FCR), egg production, egg weight, eggshell thickness, Haugh unit, and
   yolk color were measured over a 28-day trial. Data were analyzed using a
   one-way analysis of variance, followed by Duncan's test for significant
   differences (p <= 0.05). Results: FLM supplementation significantly
   improved energy, protein, fat, calcium, and phosphorus intake while
   reducing FCR. At 4\% FLM inclusion, significant enhancements in egg
   production, eggshell thickness, Haugh unit, and yolk color were
   observed. Conversely, fiber intake and overall feed intake remained
   unaffected across treatments. The highest egg production (56.43\%) and
   best yolk color (8.95) were observed in the 8\% FLM group. Conclusion:
   Incorporating FLM into the diets of laying quails effectively enhances
   nutrient utilization and improves egg production and quality without
   increasing feed intake. The optimal inclusion level for maximizing
   benefits appears to be 4-8\% FLM.},

Abstract = {Cassava peels (CaPe) were ensiled in mixtures with Gliricidia sepium and
   Leucaena leucocephala, and the utilization of the mixed silages by West
   African dwarf (WAD) goats was assessed. Five silages were composed,
   comprising of 100 \% ensiled CaPe (control), CaPe + G. sepium 2:1 (w/w;
   2CGS), CaPe + G. sepium 1:1 (w/w; CGS), CaPe + L. leucocephala 2:1 (w/w;
   2CLL) and CaPe + L. leucocephala 1:1 (w/w; CLL). All diets were
   supplemented with molasses (40 g/kg) before ensiling which lasted 3
   months. Fifteen WAD goats (8.01 +/- 0.12 kg body weight) were fed one of
   the experimental diets (50 g/kg body weight) for 8 weeks. The control
   had the lowest hydrocyanic acid content (0.05 mg/kg DM), while others
   ranged from 6.2 to 81.3 mg/kg. Condensed tannin concentration ranged
   from 1.7 to 8.4 mg/kg DM, while mimosine levels were 11.6 and 12.4 mg/kg
   DM in 2CLL and CLL, respectively. After fermentation, all silages showed
   low pH (< 4.5) and were different (P < 0.05) in the lactic, acetic and
   butyric acid concentrations. Ratio of foliage supplementation influenced
   DM intake (P < 0.05). Daily weight gains ranged from 17 (CLL) to 24

   fractions differed (P < 0.05) among diets. The values for packed cell
   volume, haemoglobin, red blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes and
   monocytes were also different (P < 0.05) across the dietary treatments.
   Ensiling CaPe with foliages of G. sepium and L. leucocephala can be
   recommended for feeding WAD goats especially during the dry spells when
   there is little or no available forage for the animals.},

Abstract = {With the soil degradation process, extensive areas of Rio Grande do Sul
   southwestern border are in sandification process. The native forest
   species use may be an alternative for revegetation of these areas. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the growth of Tabebuia chrysotricha
   and Leucaena leucocephala seedlings under different vermicompost doses
   in soil under sandification process in Rio Grande do Sul southwestern
   border. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial
   (2 x 3); two forest species (Tabebuia chrysotricha and Leucaena
   leucocephala), three levels of composed substrate with sandy soil and
   vermicompost (v:v) (0\% of vermicompost: 100\% of soil; 50\%
   vermicompost: 50\% of soil; and 25\% of vermicompost: 75\% of soil), and
   with 9 replications. The response to the vermicompostaddition was
   different between both species. The addition of 25\% of vermicompost to
   sandy soil provides greater growth in seedlings of both Tabebuia
   chrysotricha and Leucaena leucocephala; however, the Leucaena
   leucocephala plants had greater height, length and specific root surface
   area than the Tabebuia chrysotricha in the higher doses of vermicompost
   added to sandy soil.},

Title = {Alien invasive Leucaena leucocephala successfully acquires nutrients by
   investing in below-ground biomass compared to native Vachellia nilotica
   in nutrient-amended soils in South Africa},
Journal = {AOB PLANTS},

Abstract = {Soils in grasslands and savannas of southern Africa are acidic and
   nutrient-poor. Legume plants, such as Vachellia nilotica and alien
   invasive Leucaena leucocephala, are a major component of the vegetation
   there. Vachellia nilotica can establish in drought-prone environments,
   and is invasive in high rainfall areas. Leucaena leucocephala is an
   emerging invasive in South Africa and is ranked among the world's 100
   most invasive alien species. Alien plants can invade native habitats
   through their adaptability to low-resource soils, and thus can
   out-compete and displace native vegetation. We investigated the effects
   of phosphorus (P) deficiency and soil acidity on legume-microbe
   symbiosis, nitrogen (N) nutrition and carbon (C) growth costs of these
   two legumes in grassland soils. We used as inoculum and growth substrate
   soils collected from a long-term (>65 years) nutrient and lime-addition
   trial, the Veld Fertilizer Trial (VFT), located at Ukulinga Research
   Farm near Pietermaritzburg in South Africa. We used soils from three VFT
   treatments: soils fertilized with superphosphate (336 kg ha(-1)) applied
   once per year (+P), soils fertilized with superphosphate (336 kg ha(-1))
   applied once per year with dolomitic lime (2250 kg ha(-1)) applied once
   every 5 years (P+L) and soils with no superphosphate and no dolomitic
   lime applications (Control). Seeds of V. nilotica and L. leucocephala
   were germinated and grown independently in these soils in green house
   conditions and harvested after 125 days for measurement of growth,
   legume-microbe symbiosis, N nutrition and C growth costs. Results showed
   that the two legumes had different growth adaptations. Vachellia
   nilotica grown in control soils and +P soils nodulated with various
   Burkholderia spp., while L. leucocephala did not nodulate in all soil
   treatments. Both legumes utilized for growth both atmospheric- and
   soil-derived N across all treatments thereby decreasing C growth costs.
   Vachellia nilotica grown in +P soils accumulated the most biomass and N
   nutrition. Leucaena leucocephala maximized specific N assimilation rates
   by investing in below-ground biomass accumulation in control soils. This
   shows that L. leucocephala possesses traits that are successful in
   acquiring nutrients by investing in below-ground biomass and relying on
   utilization of N from both the soil and the atmosphere.
   Alien plants such as L. leucocephalacan invade native habitats through
   their adaptability to low-resource soils, and thus can out-compete and
   displace native vegetation. They do this by investing on their
   below-ground biomass, reliance in free-living N-fixing bacteria and
   altering N sources. Therefore, soil management practices that seek to
   address nutrient deficiency and soil acidity in nutrient-stressed
   ecosystems may affect the interaction between native and alien invasive
   woody plants in impacted ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Forty male pigs (43.4 +/- 6.2 kg of liveweight) housed in metabolism
   crates were used to evaluate the effect of Leucaena leucocephala leaf
   meal (LLM) treated with acetic acid (AA) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in
   pig diets, on coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD)
   of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral
   detergent fiber (NDF) and nitrogen balance (NB). The experimental diets
   included 200 g LLM kg(-1) which had been treated with four levels (0,
   30, 60 and 90 g kg(-1) DM) of AA or NaOH, respectively as chemical
   treatments. The experiment was conducted in two periods: 7 days for
   adaptation, and 7 days for total urine and faeces collection. There were
   no differences (P > 0.05) between treatments (AA and NaOH) on CTTAD of
   DM, OM and CP. However, CTTAD of NDF was higher (P < 0.05) in pigs fed
   diets with LLM treated with AA (0.49) than in pigs fed diets with LLM
   treated with NaOH (0.44). There were no differences (P > 0.05) on
   apparent digestibility between levels of treatments (0, 30, 60 and 90 g
   kg(-1)). Nitrogen retained was higher (P < 0.05) in pigs fed diets that
   included LLM treated with level 30 g kg(-1) of AA or NaOH (11.2 g per
   day) in comparison to pigs fed diets with LLM treated with 0, 60 and 90
   g kg(-1) (4.6, 7.3 and 6.7 g per day, respectively) as seen from the
   quadratic response. The results obtained in the current work suggest
   that treating LLM with 30 g kg(-1) of AA or NaOH increased nitrogen
   retention in growing pigs. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {In search of effective nitrogen-fixing strains for inoculating Leucaena
   leucocephala, we assessed the symbiotic efficiency of 41 rhizobial
   isolates from root nodules of L. leucocephala growing in the arid-hot
   river valley area in Panxi, China. The genetic diversity of the isolates
   was studied by analyzing the housekeeping genes 16S rRNA and recA, and
   the symbiotic genes nifH and nodC. In the nodulation and symbiotic
   efficiency assay, only 11 of the 41 isolates promoted the growth of L.
   leucocephala while the majority of the isolates were ineffective in
   symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Furthermore, one fourth of the isolates had
   a growth slowing effect on the host. According to the 16S rRNA and recA
   gene analyses, most of the isolates were Ensifer spp. The remaining
   isolates were assigned to Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium.
   The sequence analyses indicated that the L. leucocephala rhizobia had
   undergone gene recombination. In contrast to the promiscuity observed as
   a wide species distribution of the isolates, the results implied that L.
   leucocephala is preferentially nodulated by strains that share common
   symbiosis genes. The symbiotic efficiency was not connected to
   chromosomal background of the symbionts and isolates carrying a similar
   nifH or nodC showed totally different nitrogen fixation efficiency.},

Abstract = {Near infrared spectroscopy partial least squares (PLS) regression
   calibrations were developed for estimation of Klason lignin content in
   Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (commonly called Subabul in India)
   belonging to the family Fabaceae and sub-family Mimo-soideae with solid
   radial-longitudinal strip and milled samples for trees having diameter
   ranging from 3.5 to 34.1 cm and age between 4 and 20 years. Samples were
   conditioned to 10-12 \% moisture content. Two separate models were
   developed for milled samples having particle sizes of 250-400 mu m
   (screened-1) and 420-1,000 mu m (screened-2). Regression model using PLS
   regression with full cross validation were test validated on a separate
   set of samples. The three multisite calibrations gave RPD (ratio of
   performance to deviation) between 2.24 and 2.97 with lowest for solid
   radial strip samples (2.24) and highest for screened-1 powder (2.97).
   Screened-1 milled sample gave highest r(p)(2) of prediction (0.92) with
   four factors compared to four that were used for solid strips and eight
   for screened-2 samples. Model with solid strips gave lowest r(p)(2) of

   PLS models with higher RPD and less number of factors compared to
   screened-2 samples (2.48) and solid strips (2.24). Particle size played
   an important role in construction of the model. Lower RPD with solid
   strips could be due to variation of chemical constituents from pith to
   bark. The standard error of calibration (SEC), standard error of cross
   validation (SECV) and standard error of prediction (SEP) were less than
   1 \% for Screened-1 samples. For screened-2 samples SEC and SECV were
   less than 1 \% while SEP was 1 \%. In case of radial solid strip SEP was
   slightly above 1 \% (1.16) while SEC and SECV were less than 1 \%. For
   constructing models of high accuracy with radial solid strips separate
   models may be constructed for juvenile and mature wood.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary This article is mainly about the development of natural
   medicines against the zoonotic tapeworm (Hymenolepis nana), which is
   caused by tapeworm eggs in infected mice, through the isolation of the
   components of jumbay (Leucaena leucocephala). This study allowed for an
   understanding of the drug therapy through the testing of these isolated
   components in vitro and in vivo. The authors assessed the survival and
   motility, and they confirmed that the two components had good effects
   against tapeworm. One of these components has a promising therapeutic
   effect in tapeworm-infected mice in the response to egg production, worm
   numbers, and immune responses. This article highlights the
   immune-enhancing and therapeutic effects of
   13(2)-hydroxy-(13(2)-S)-pheophytin a against tapeworms in infected mice.
   Background/Purpose: Hymenolepis nana is globally distributed. Leucaena
   leucocephala has been studied as a treatment, including the nematodes
   and protozoa, but no research results are related to cestodes.
   Therefore, the aim of this study was to target H. nana. Methods: The
   natural components of L. leucocephala were isolated and added to H.
   nana, which was cultured in vitro, to observe changes in the mortality,
   motility, and morphology. BALB/c male mice infected with H. nana were
   treated with effective components of L. leucocephala for 10 days, and
   the changes were recorded. After the mice were sacrificed, the spleen
   weight was measured, and a primary culture was performed for the
   subsequent cytokine and chemokine testing. Results: The experiment found
   that 13(2)-hydroxy-(13(2)-S)-pheophytin a and aristophyll-C have clear
   cestocidal effects in vitro. 13(2)-hydroxy-(13(2)-S)-pheophytin a has
   been shown to be effective at reducing parasite populations and
   eliciting host immune responses in vivo. IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10,
   IL-13, IL-17, MCP-1, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, MIP-1 alpha, and GM-CSF in
   13(2)-hydroxy-(13(2)-S)-pheophytin a were significantly increased after
   stimulation, while IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-3, IL-12p70, and RANTES
   were unchanged. Conclusions: The investigation shows that components of
   L. leucocephala have actual cestocidal activity against H. nana.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Abstract = {Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) have been identified as the primary
   contaminants in soil, posing potential health threats. This study aimed
   to examine the effects of applying a nitrogen fertilizer and a fungal
   agent Trichoderma harzianum J2 (nitrogen alone, fungi alone, and
   combined use) on the phytoremediation of soils co -contaminated with Pb
   and Cd. The growth of Leucaena leucocephala was monitored in the
   seedling, differentiation, and maturity stages to fully comprehend the
   remediation mechanisms. In the maturity stage, the biomass of L.
   leucocephala significantly increased by 18\% and 29\% under nitrogen
   -alone (NCK + ) and fungal agent -alone treatments (J2), respectively,
   compared with the control in contaminated soil (CK + ). The remediation
   factors of Pb and Cd with NCK + treatment significantly increased by
   50\% and 125\%, respectively, while those with J2 treatment increased by
   73\% and 145\%, respectively. The partial least squares path model
   suggested that the nitrogen -related soil properties were prominent
   factors affecting phytoextraction compared with biotic factors
   (microbial diversity and plant growth). This model explained 2.56 of the
   variation in Cd concentration under J2 treatment, and 2.97 and 2.82 of
   the variation in Pb concentration under NCK + and J2 treatments,
   respectively. The redundancy analysis showed that the samples under NCK
   + and J2 treatments were clustered similarly in all growth stages. Also,
   Chytridiomycota , Mucoromucota , and Ciliophora were the key
   bioindicators for coping with heavy metals. Overall, a similar
   remediation mechanism allowed T. harzianum J2 to replace the nitrogen
   fertilizer to avoid secondary pollution. In addition, their combined use
   further increased the remediation efficiency.},

Abstract = {Cell wall architecture of tension wood fibres represents a suitable
   biological system to study the mechanism of growth and maintenance of
   posture of trees growing under various physical and physiological growth
   constraints. In the present study, we investigated the spatial
   distributions of beta-(1-4)-D-galactan, xyloglucan and xylans (both less
   and highly substituted) in the opposite and tension wood fibres of bent
   Leucaena leucocephala by immunolabelling with monoclonal antibodies LM5,
   CCRCM1, LM10 and LM11 specific to these carbohydrate epitopes. The
   presence of non-lignified, tertiary wall layer is the typical tension
   wood characteristic associated with the reaction xylem fibres in
   Leucaena. LM5 labelling of opposite fibres showed weak labelling in the
   cell walls indicating less concentration of beta-(1-4)-D-galactans while
   tension wood showed strong labelling in the tertiary wall layer
   suggesting the gelatinous layer (G-layer) has a strong cross linking
   with beta-(1-4)-D-galactans. Xyloglucan distribution was more in the
   compound middle lamellae and the primary wall-Si layer boundary of
   tension wood fibres as compared to that of opposite wood. A weak
   labelling was also evident near the boundary between the G-layer and the
   secondary wall of tension wood fibres. The secondary wall of opposite
   and tension wood fibres showed a strong distribution of both Is ACG Xs
   (LM10) and hs ACG Xs (LM11) while a weak labelling was noticed in the
   compound middle lamella. Tension wood fibres also showed strong xylan
   labelling mainly confined to the lignified secondary walls while the
   G-layer showed weak xylan labelling. In conclusion, our results suggest
   that beta-(1-4)-D-galactans and xyloglucans could be implicated in the
   tensile stress generation within the G-layer of tension wood fibres of
   Leucaena leucocephala.},

Abstract = {Bioactive compounds from ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala) seeds were
   isolated using solvent extraction and silica gel column chromatography.
   Antifeedant activities of the crude ethanolic extract, chromatographic
   fractions and crystalline isolate were tested on third instar larvae of
   the common cutworm (Spodoptera litura). Dual choice assay using 10 mu g
   cm(-2) applied on both adaxial and abaxial parts of castor (Ricinus
   communis) leaves showed that the crystalline isolate had the highest
   activity, with percentage relative feeding inhibition of 79.93 +/-
   1.00\%. The very high melting point, together with data from chemical
   and spectroscopic analyses, suggest that the isolate is a
   saponin-containing complex with molar mass of 662 g mol(-1) in the major
   component.},

Abstract = {The influence of four pruning frequencies on biomass, nodulation and N-2
   fixation was investigated on Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium and
   Leucaena leucocephala grown in the screenhouse for 16 months, using
   acetylene reduction and N-15 dilution methods. Frequent prunings at
   4-month intervals had no deleterious effect on symbiotic N-2 fixation,
   which increased in Gliricidia and Leucaena in particular. Nodulation and
   nitrogenase activity varied inconsistently within species, and were not
   influenced by pruning frequency. Cumulative assessment of pruning effect
   showed higher biomass, N yield and N-2-fixing capacity of the woody
   species than at last harvest, and appeared to have more practical
   relevance. Across species, cumulative total dry matter, N yields, and
   both percentage and absolute amount of N-2 derived from atmosphere
   increased with pruning frequency, except when trees were pruned 3 times.
   Of the three species, G. sepium had the lowest biomass production, N-2
   fixation and N accumulation.},

   Metal-Polluted Soils},

Abstract = {Metalliferous mine tailings have a negative impact on the soil
   environment near mining areas and render cultivable lands infertile.
   Phytoremediation involving the synergism of legume and rhizobia provides
   a useful technique in tackling this issue with cost-effective,
   environmentally friendly, and easy-to-use features under adverse soil
   conditions. Leucaena leucocephala has been found to build symbiotic
   relationships with native rhizobia in the iron-vanadium-titanium oxide
   (V-Ti magnetite) mine tailing soil. Rhizobia YH1, isolated from the root
   nodules of L. leucocephala, was classified as Sinorhizobium saheli
   according to similarity and phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA,
   housekeeping and nitrogen fixation genes. Besides nitrogen fixation, S.
   saheli YH1 also showed capabilities to produce indole-acetic acid (IAA)
   (166.77 +/- 2.03 mg l(-1)) and solubilize phosphate (104.41 +/- 7.48 mg
   l(-1)), Pot culture experiments showed that strain YH1 increased the
   biomass, plant height and root length of L. leucocephala by 67.2, 39.5
   and 27.2\% respectively. There was also an average increase in plant N
   (10.0\%), P (112.2\%) and K (25.0\%) contents compared to
   inoculation-free control. The inoculation of YH1 not only reduced the
   uptake of all metals by L. leucocephala in the mine tailings, but also
   resulted in decreased uptake of Cd by up to 79.9\% and Mn by up to
   67.6\% for plants grown in soils contaminated with Cd/Mn. It was
   concluded that S. saheli YH1 possessed multiple beneficial effects on L.
   leucocephala grown in metalliferous soils. Our findings highlight the
   role of S. saheli YH1 in improving plant health of L. leucocephala by
   reducing metal uptake by plants grown in heavy metal-polluted soils. We
   also suggest the idea of using L. leucocephala-S. saheli association for
   phytoremediation and revegetation of V-Ti mine tailings and soils
   polluted with Cd or Mn.},

   0.6, 1.2, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL. The larval exsheathment
   inhibition (LEI) results showed thatG. sepiumachieved the highest
   average inhibition of 91.2\%, compared with 44.6\% forP. dulceand 41.0\%
   forL. leucocephalaat a concentration of 40 mg/mL; the corresponding
   IC(50)values were 22.4, 41.7, and 43.3 mg/mL, respectively. The rates of
   egg hatching inhibition (EHI) at a concentration of 5 mg/mL were 99.5\%

Title = {Valorization of arabinoxylans from Linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) and

   hydrogels: Rheological, morphological and thermal characterization},
Journal = {INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {178},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The present investigation was aimed at preparing hydrogels from
   galactomannans extracted from the defatted seeds of Leucaena
   leucocephala (subabul) (SGM) and kappa-carrageenan (xC) in an aqueous
   phase (pH 6.8) using KCl as ionic crosslinker. The dynamic moduli (G'
   and G{''}) and Power law parameters (n' and n{''}) of the hydrogels were
   optimized through full factorial design (CCD). The optimized hydrogel
   was prepared with SGM (6.5\% w/v) and xC (1\% w/v) in the presence of
   KCl (0.63\% w/v) (GA1). A hybrid hydrogel using a combination of SGM and
   crude arabinoxylan from flaxseed (FX) was also optimized similarly as
   GA1. The optimized hybrid hydrogel was composed of FX (1\% w/w), SGM
   (5.5\% w/v), and xC (1.32\% w/v) crosslinked with 0.25\% w/v KCl (GAX).
   GAX showed higher dynamic moduli (G'-2871 Pa, G{''}-1711 Pa) than GA1
   (G'-2589 Pa and G{''}-1399 Pa) due to the formation of stable
   interpenetrating polymer network between the hydrogel components. The
   structural (NMR (1H), FTIR), morphological (SEM), rheological as well as
   thermal studies confirmed superior characteristics of GAX than GA1. This
   was also evident from high gel strength (2019 N) and increased firmness
   (1231 N.s) of GAX. GAX also exhibited 389\% water uptake ratio (q) at
   neutral pH and 45 degrees C, and did not show any syneresis for 72 h at
   4 degrees C. The synergistic amalgamation of a galactomannan from a
   forest resource and an arabinoxylan from flaxseed processing byproduct
   not only valorizes them but also enables the development of a
   self-stable hydrogel that can find far reaching applications in various
   industrial sectors.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) is native to Central America and has
   invaded many climatic regions of the tropics. In South Africa, the
   species is categorized as an emerging or incipient weed used as fodder,
   timber, firewood and in erosion control on degraded habitats. The
   species is common along the eastern subtropical regions of KwaZulu-Natal
   (KZN) Province, where it invades grasslands, savannas and edges of
   forests. Soils of these ecosystems are characterized as nutrient
   deficient and acidic. Using a pot trial, we determined the effects of
   the nutrient addition treatments on microbial symbiosis, N nutrition and
   biomass accumulation of L. leucocephala under greenhouse conditions.
   After 180 days of growth, plants were harvested, and their utilization
   of N derived from the atmosphere and from the soil was quantified
   through determination of delta N-15 values. L. leucocephala maintained
   growth and N nutrition by relying on both atmospheric- and soil-derived
   N across all soil treatments. The NDFA was significantly higher in high
   P (N1 + P, N2 + P and N3 + P) soils. L. leucocephala was able to
   nodulate with intermediate and fast-growing strains from the
   Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium genus in N2 + P grown plants. This shows
   that L. leucocephala possesses traits that are successful in acquiring
   nutrients, especially in nutrient limited conditions, by establishing
   plant symbiosis with multiple bacteria and relying on extracting N from
   the soil and from the atmosphere through the symbiosis.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of plant-based coagulant
   extracted from Leucaena leucocephala seeds compared with alum in
   removing solids from aquaculture wastewater. Water-extraction method was
   used to extract the active ingredients from the seeds by dissolving the
   seeds' powder in distilled water at 20 g/L concentration, whereas alum
   was dissolved directly at the same concentration. Operation parameters
   of jar test including dosage, rapid-mixing speed, and settling time were
   optimized for the water-extracted seed solution and alum to improve the
   removal efficiency. The optimum operation parameters for the
   water-extracted seed solution and alum were dosages of 240 and 320 mg/L
   respectively, rapid-mixing speed 150 rpm, and settling time 40 min. At
   the optimum operation parameters, water-extracted seed solution had
   removal efficiencies of 96.32\%, 92.85\%, and 86\%, whereas alum had
   removal efficiencies of 99.77\%, 99.92\%, and 99.92\% for turbidity,
   total suspended solids, and color, respectively. Despite the high
   efficiency of the water-extracted seed solution, dissolved contaminants
   such as NO3, PO4, COD, and true color increased owing to the presence of
   organic matter in the solution. With these results, L. leucocephala
   seeds had high potential to be used as alternative in removing solids
   from aquaculture wastewater. Further studies on the extraction of active
   ingredients should be conducted to increase the removal efficiency and
   avoid side effects on the contaminants dissolved in the effluent.},

   chains (alpha-chain, M-r 15 000, and beta-chain, M-r 5000), the sequence
   being determined by automatic Edman degradation and by mass
   spectroscopy. LITI is a 174 amino acid residue protein which shows high
   homology to plant Kunitz inhibitors, especially those double chain
   proteins purified from the Mimosoideae subfamily. LITI inhibits plasmin
   (K-i 3.2 X 10(-10) M), human plasma kallikrein (K-i 6.3 X 10(-10) M),
   trypsin (K-i 1.5 X 10(-8) M) and chymotrypsin (K-i 1.4 X 10(-8) M).
   Factor XIIa activity is inhibited but K-i was not determined, and factor
   Xa, tissue kallikrein and thrombin are not inhibited by LITI. The action
   of LITI on enzymes that participate in the blood clotting extrinsic
   pathway is confirmed by the prolongation of activated partial
   thromboplastin time, used as clotting time assay. The inhibition of the
   fibrinolytic activity of plasmin was confirmed on the hydrolysis of
   fibrin plates. LlTI inhibits kinin release from high molecular weight
   kininogen by human plasma kallikrein in vitro and, administered
   intravenously, causes a decrease in paw edema induced by carrageenin or
   heat in male Wistar rats. Is addition, lower concentrations of
   bradykinin were found in limb perfusion fluids of LlTI-treated rats, (C)

Abstract = {This study aims to valorize agricultural waste of Leucaena leucocephala
   pods (LP) as a low-cost precursor for synthesizing high-performance
   activated carbon (LP-AC) for the removal of methylene blue dye (MB).
   Phosphoric acid H3PO4 was employed as a chemical activator of the LP
   biomass with a mass ratio of phosphoric acid to the precursor (3/1)
   before being calcined at 500 degrees C for 55 min. Box Benken design was
   investigated to optimize the experimental parameters of initial
   concentration, adsorbent dose, and pH. Variable optimization indicated
   that the highest removal efficiency of MB dye, estimated as 99.99\%, was
   noticed at the initial concentration of 300.87 mg L-1, adsorbent dose of
   0.049 g, and solution pH of 10.07. Isotherm study revealed that Temkin
   model shows the best agreement with the experimental data with a
   correlation coefficient of (R-2 = 0.990). The adsorption capacity of MB
   dye was determined as 584.32 mg g(-1). The kinetic study suggested that
   the pseudo-second-order model is the best-correlated model for data
   fitting with (R-2 > 0.997). The thermodynamic analysis indicated an
   enthalpy change (Delta H) of - 18.50 kJ/mol, confirming that the
   adsorption of MB dye onto LP-AC material is an exothermic process. SEM
   characterization of the surface showed that the LP-AC exhibits a
   heterogeneous structure. The BET analysis revealed a remarkable surface
   area of 1367.30 m(2) g(-1) for the produced carbon, including a blend of
   mesoporous and microporous structures. Furthermore, complementary
   analyses including EDS, TGA, and FTIR confirmed the presence of crucial
   properties, underscoring its potential effectiveness as an adsorbent for
   removing MB dye.},

Abstract = {The performance of biol egulator populations in two areas of leucaena (3
   and 15 years of establishment) was studied for two years. Insect
   population was characterized and possible natural biological control
   agents of Heteropsylla cubana were studied to maintain the biological
   equilibrium within the agroecosystem. A monthly representative sample of
   60 catches was used. The tables of risks and comparison of proportions
   were used for the analysis. There was a higher incidence of the H.
   cubana psyllid in the leucaena area of 3 years of establishment, without
   economical damages for the plants. It increased at the end of the rainy
   season and at the beginning of the dry season with averages of 1242.5
   and 995.5 individuals in the areas of 3 and 15 years, respectively.
   October showed the maximum psyllid population in both areas. The study
   demonstrated that among the beneficial entomofauna the Chilocorus cacti
   coccinelidae had the highest incidence and stability reaching 84.6\%
   while the other biological agents remained at low proportions. It is
   concluded that under our conditions the active presence of bioregulators
   prevents the psyllid from causing economical damages to leucaena, among
   them: Chrysopa sp. Cycloneda sanguina and Zelus longipes. Further
   bioecological studies of these predators are needed for their mass
   production and release in leucaena areas. Also, it is necessary to
   define the Ch. cacti as a possible psyllid bioregulator, giving an
   alternative to a more efficient pest control under safe ecological
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala var. K-8 is a fast-growing, tropical leguminous
   tree that has multiple economic uses. This study was conducted to
   evaluate the effect(s) of varying NaCl concentrations on growth, N-2
   fixation, and percentage of total tissue nitrogen in different organs in
   L. leucocephala. Seeds were germinated and grown for 10 wk with a
   nitrogen-free fertilizer applied every 2 wk. At 10 wk, plants were
   treated for either 0, 7, 14, 21, or 28 wk with either deionized water
   (control), 0.00625 mol/L, 0.0125 mol/L, 0.025 mol/L, 0.05 mol/L, or 0.1
   mol/L NaCl in addition to the fertilizer every 2 wk. Growth was measured
   as plant height, nodule number and mass, and dry tissue mass. N-2
   fixation was measured by the acetylene reduction assay. Percentage of
   tissue nitrogen was determined using Kjeldahl analysis. In younger
   plants (7-wk treatment), major fluctuations in NaCl tolerance were
   observed in the different plant organs. As plants matured (14- and 21-wk
   treatment) NaCl concentrations of 0.025 mol/L and higher caused the
   greatest reduction in growth and tissue nitrogen. We conclude that NaCl
   concentrations of 0.025 mol/L and greater caused a major decrease in
   growth, N2 fixation, and percentage of tissue nitrogen in L.

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the nutrient digestibility of growing
   rabbits fed diets with different levels of either Leucaena leucocephala
   (LLM) or Moringa oleifera (MOLM) leaf meals and also to compare total
   collection and TiO2 marker methods for estimating digestibility. A total
   of 30 California growing rabbits (1.81 +/- 0.19 kg live weight on
   average) were randomly distributed into five experimental groups of six
   rabbits each and were housed in individual cages. The groups were
   control, 30\% LLM, 40\% LLM, 30\% MOLM, and 40\% MOLM. All groups
   received pelleted diets for two weeks; diets also contained 4 g/kg
   titanium dioxide as dietary marker. Daily feed intake was recorded
   during the whole experimental period and total feces were collected
   daily and weighed individually during four days. The results showed that
   there were no difference (p>0.05) in feed, dry matter (DM), organic
   matter (OM), crude protein (CP), digestible energy, and crude fiber (CF)
   intake between the control group and the other experimental groups. The
   apparent digestibility values of DM, OM, CP, CF, acid detergent fiber,
   and gross energy were the highest for control group (p = 0.001),
   meanwhile MOLM diets had generally higher nutrient digestibility
   coefficients than LLM diets. Increasing the inclusion level of leaf meal
   in the diet from 30\% to 40\% improved the digestibility of CF from
   45.02\% to 51.69\% for LLM and from 48.11\% to 55.89\% for MOLM. Similar
   results for apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients were obtained
   when either total collection or indigestible marker method was used. In
   conclusion, the digestibility of MOLM containing diets were better than
   LLM diets, furthermore TiO2 as an external marker could be used as a
   simple, practical and reliable method to estimate nutrients
   digestibility in rabbit diets.},

Abstract = {Four swamp buffaloes (Bubalus Bubalis) with average body weight of 238
   +/- 27 kg were randomly assigned to receive four dietary treatments
   according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. The treatments were
   supplemented with Leucaena leucocephala leaves (LLP) and were as
   follows: Treatment (T1) = LLP supplementation at 0 g/h/d (control); T2 =
   LLP supplementation at 150 g/h/d; T3= LLP supplementation at 300 g/h/d;
   T4= LLP supplementation at 450 g/ h /d. All animals were fed with
   concentrate (14.2 \% CP, 76 \% TDN) at 0.5\% BW and offered with rice
   straw ad libitum. It was found that dry matter intake and ruminal NH3-N
   (16.2 mg/dl) were increased at highest LLP supplementation, but no
   effect on rumen pH. Apparent digestibilities of DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF
   were significantly increased (P<0.05) when increasing LLP
   supplementation and was highest at 450 g/h/d. Ruminal NH3-N
   concentration was significantly different among treatments (P<0.05), and
   was highest when buffaloes were fed at 450 g/ h /d (16.2 mg/dl). Blood
   urea-nitrogen (BUN) concentrations were not significantly different
   (P>0.05) among treatments but tended to be increased with enhancing
   levels of LLP supplementation (9.0-11.6 mg/dl), respectively. Total
   volatile fatty acids (TVFA) and proportion of propionic acid (C-3) were
   differed among treatments and ranged from 88.6 to 100.8 mmol/l and 23.4
   to 27.7 mmol/l, respectively. The concentrations of acetic acid (C-2)
   and butyric acid (C-4) were found decreased when increasing level of LLP
   from 300 to 450 g/ h /d while the ratio of acetic acid to propionic acid
   were decreased when supplementation of LLP from 300-450 kg/ h /d. Based
   on this study, it could be concluded that supplementation of LLP at 450
   g/ h /d with rice straw can improve voluntary intake, digestibility and
   rumen fermentation parameters in swamp buffaloes.},

Title = {Anthelmintic Effect of Leucaena leucocephala Extract and Its
   Active Compound, Mimosine, on Vital Behavioral Activities in
   Caenorhabditis elegans},
Journal = {MOLECULES},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Helminth infections continue to be a neglected global threat in tropical
   regions, and there have been growing cases of anthelmintic resistance
   reported towards the existing anthelmintic drugs. Thus, the search for a
   novel anthelmintic agent has been increasing, especially those derived
   from plants. Leucaena leucocephala (LL) is a leguminous plant that is
   known to have several pharmacological activities, including anthelmintic
   activity. It is widely known to contain a toxic compound called
   mimosine, which we believed could be a potential lead candidate that
   could exert a potent anthelmintic effect. Hence, this study aimed to
   validate the presence of mimosine in LL extract and to investigate the
   anthelmintic effect of LL extract and mimosine on head thrashing,
   egg-laying, and pharyngeal pumping activities using the animal model
   Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Mimosine content in LL extract was
   confirmed through an HPLC analysis of spiking LL extract with different
   mimosine concentrations, whereby an increasing trend in peak heights was
   observed at a retention time of 0.9 min. LL extract and mimosine caused
   a significant dose-dependent increase in the percentage of worm
   mortality, which produced LC50s of 73 mg/mL and 6.39 mg/mL,
   respectively. Exposure of C. elegans to different concentrations of LL
   extract and mimosine significantly decreased the head thrashing,
   egg-laying, and mean pump amplitude of pharyngeal pumping activity. We
   speculated that these behavioral changes are due to the inhibitory
   effect of LL extract and mimosine on an L-type calcium channel called
   EGL-19. Our findings provide evidential support for the potential of LL
   extract and its active compound, mimosine, as novel anthelmintic
   candidates. However, the underlying mechanism of the anthelmintic action
   has yet to be elucidated.},

Abstract = {A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementing different
   levels of Leucaena leucocephala leaves on reproductive capacity and
   growth of male highland sheep (Arsi type) in Debre Zeit Research Centre.
   Animals were randomly allotted to one of five experimental rations. In
   treatment 1 (NS) animals were allowed to feed only on chickpea haulm.
   Treatments 2 (L100), 3 (L200) and 4 (L300) consisted of 100, 200 and 300
   g/head per day of sun dried leucaena leaf hay, while animals in
   treatment 5 (C300) received 300 g/head per day of concentrate mixture.
   The basal diet, chickpea haulm, was offered ad libitum to all groups.
   Leucaena supplementation significantly increased total DM intake without
   marked effect on intake of the basal diet. Live weight of sheep was
   found to have increased by 68, 88, 94 and 74\% as a result of
   supplementation of 100, 200 and 300 g/head per day of sun dried leucaena
   leaves and 300 g/head/day of concentrate mixture, respectively.
   Epididymal growth was retarded in animals maintained solely on chickpea
   haulm and improved with supplementation. Similar effects were noted in
   all the epididymal components of both the left and right testes. The
   scrotal circumference of non-supplemented sheep has been reduced by
   about 10\% while addition of leucaena to the diet increased testicular
   size by 20-24\%. The diameters of the left and right testes were also
   affected positive by supplementation. It was concluded that
   supplementation of up to 300 g/head per day of leucaena leaf hay
   improved body weight gain of sheep with concurrent increases in
   testicular and epididymal sizes without resulting in clinical symptoms
   of toxicity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   forest-savanna zone) and Fashola (savanna zone, 70 km north of Ibadan)
   in southwestern Nigeria as a result of low soil fertility and the
   presence of only a few native rhizobia capable of nodulating it.
   Inoculation with L. leucocephala at these two locations in 1982 resulted
   in striking responses with Rhizobium strains IRc 1045 and IRc 1050
   isolated from L. leucocephala grown in Nigeria. The persistence of
   inoculated effective Rhizobium strains after inoculation is desirable
   since it removes the need for reinoculation. Because of the perennial
   nature of L. leucocephala and its use in long-term alley farming
   experiments, we examined the persistence of inoculated rhizobial strains
   after inoculation, and their ability to sustain N2-fixation and biomass
   production at Ibadan. In 1992, ten years after Rhizobium introduction,
   uninoculated, L. leucocephala fixed about 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 or about 41
   \% of total plant N compared to 180 kg N ha-1 yr-1 or 43\% measured in
   1982. Serological typing of the nodules using the
   Enzyme-Linked-Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and intrinsic resistance to
   the streptomycin test revealed that most of the nodules (96\%) formed on
   L. leucocephala in 1992 were by Rhizobium strains IRc 1045 and IRc 1050,
   which were inoculated in 1982. Nodules were absent on uninoculated L.
   leucocephala grown on the adjacent field with no history of L.
   leucocephala cultivation. We conclude that the N, fixed by Rhizobilum
   strains IRc 1045 and IRc 1050 persisted for many years in the absence of
   L. leucocephala and sustained effectively fixed N, which growth and
   yield of L. leucocephala after several years, thus encouraging a
   possible low-input alley farming system by smallholder farmers in
   Nigeria.},

Abstract = {Yield, chemical composition, fatty acid profile, and sensory
   acceptability of Panela cheese produced from cows grazing in an
   intensive silvopastoral system (ISS) with Leucaena leucocephala and
   Cynodon nlemfuensis were evaluated and compared with Panela cheese from
   cows grazing a monoculture system (MS) of C. nlemfuensis only. The
   experiment lasted for 9 weeks in a tropical area in Mexico using ten
   crossbred cows (30-90 days of milking) assigned homogenously as five
   cows in each experimental group. No significant differences were found
   between the two systems for milk and cheese gross composition. Panela
   cheese from ISS showed lower content of the hypercholesterolemic fatty
   acids, accompanied with higher content of omega-3, omega-6 and
   polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, Panela cheese from ISS showed
   higher preference for the attributes of appearance, texture, flavor, and
   overall acceptability. It is concluded that Panela cheese from cows
   grazing in ISS has better acceptability and nutritional properties than
   that produced from MS with grass only.},

Abstract = {Laccase from a tree legume, Leucaena leucocephala, was purified to
   homogeneity using a quick two-step procedure: alginate bead entrapment
   and celite adsorption chromatography. Laccase was purified 110.6-fold
   with an overall recovery of 51.0\% and a specific activity of 58.5
   units/mg. The purified laccase was found to be a heterodimer (similar to
   220 kDa), containing two subunits of 100 and 120 kDa. The affinity of
   laccase was found to be highest for catechol and lowest for
   hydroquinone, however, highest K-cat and K-cat/K-m were obtained for
   hydroquinone. Purified laccase exhibited pH and temperature optima of
   7.0 and 80 degrees C, respectively. Mn2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Cu2+ and Na+
   activated laccase while Ca2+ treatment increased laccase activity up to
   3 mM, beyond which it inhibited laccase. Co2+, Hg2+, DTT, SDS and EDTA
   showed an inhibition of laccase activity. The Leucaena laccase was found
   to be fairly tolerant to organic solvents; upon exposure for I h
   individually to 50\% (v/v) each of ethanol, DMF, DMSO and benzene, more
   than 50\% of the activity was retained, while in the presence of 50\%
   (v/v) each of methanol, isopropanol and chloroform, a 40\% residual
   activity was observed. The purified laccase efficiently decolorized
   synthetic dyes such as indigocarmine and congo red in the absence of any
   redox mediator. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Glycosyl hydrolase family 1 beta-glucosidases are important enzymes that
   serve many diverse functions in plants including defense, whereby
   hydrolyzing the defensive compounds such as hydroxynitrile glucosides. A
   hydroxynitrile glucoside cleaving beta-glucosidase gene (Llbglu1) was
   isolated from Leucaena leucocephala, cloned into pET-28a (+) and
   expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The recombinant enzyme was
   purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The optimal temperature and
   pH for this beta-glucosidase were found to be 45 A degrees C and 4.8,
   respectively. The purified Llbglu1 enzyme hydrolyzed the synthetic
   glycosides, pNPGlucoside (pNPGlc) and pNPGalactoside (pNPGal). Also, the
   enzyme hydrolyzed amygdalin, a hydroxynitrile glycoside and a few of the
   tested flavonoid and isoflavonoid glucosides. The kinetic parameters K
   (m) and V (max) were found to be 38.59 mu M and 0.8237 mu M/mg/min for
   pNPGlc, whereas for pNPGal the values were observed as 1845 mu M and
   0.1037 mu M/mg/min. In the present study, a three dimensional (3D) model
   of the Llbglu1 was built by MODELLER software to find out the substrate
   binding sites and the quality of the model was examined using the

   residues are Glu 199, Glu 413, His 153, Asn 198, Val 270, Asn 340, and
   Trp 462. Docking of rhodiocyanoside A with the modeled Llbglu1 resulted
   in a binding with free energy change (Delta G) of -5.52 kcal/mol on
   which basis rhodiocyanoside A could be considered as a potential
   substrate.},

Abstract = {When roots of Leucaena leucocephala seedlings (White Popinac, a tropical
   legume tree belongs to the Family Mimosaceae) were fumigated with
   simulated landfill gas (CO2 above 10\% and O-2 from 10\% to atmospheric
   level), the stem elongation rate and stomatal conductance were inhibited
   at the absence of any apparent leaf water deficit. When compared with a
   treatment where root system was flooded, the effect of gas fumigation on
   the shoot physiology was relatively mild and appeared later. On the
   other hand, nodule activity (measured as rate of acetylene reduction
   activity, ARA) was much more severely inhibited by gas fumigation.
   Although nodule dry weight and carbohydrate storage in nodules were
   reduced, the inhibition was not likely a result of the shortage of
   carbohydrate reserve in the nodules. This was because the ARA of
   untreated fresh nodules was also inhibited immediately following
   exposure to the simulated landfill gas. In further experiments where CO2
   and O-2 were manipulated separately, although a reduction of O-2
   concentration to half of the atmospheric level might account for up to
   30\% loss of ARA with considerable variation, the high CO2 alone showed
   a much more severe inhibition. This CO2-induced inhibition was not
   reversible one hour after the high CO2 gas was removed. There was some
   recovery of activity 5 day after plants were fumigated, suggesting that
   the legume plant can maintain some nitrogen-fixation activity under the
   influence of landfill gas.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the potential for tolerance, absorption, and
   translocation of iron (Fe) by Leucaena leucocephala, as well as the
   response of the photosynthetic mechanism and the phytoremediation
   potential of L. leucocephala grown in soil with concentrations of Fe (0,
   100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg Fe/dm(3) of soil). The chlorophyll
   content and the photosynthetic apparatus showed a significant difference
   between treatments: the chlorophyll content, transpiration rate, and
   stomatal conductance were higher in the treatment 200 mg Fe/dm(3) of
   soil, while the photosynthetic rate was higher in the treatment 500 mg
   Fe/dm(3) of soil in relation to the control. From 300 mg Fe/dm(3) of
   soil onward, there was a significant reduction in the number of leaves,
   mass, and biomass of L. leucocephala. The species is tolerant to the Fe
   doses analyzed. Availability of Fe in the soil after the cultivation of
   L. leucocephala decreased, evidencing the plant capacity of Fe
   absorption, which accumulated mostly in the roots, and only \% of Fe was
   translocated to the shoots. The highest Fe accumulation per biomass was
   9.48 mg, at 200 mg Fe/dm(3) of soil. The amount of Fe translocated and
   accumulated in L. leucocephala is directly related to its biomass
   production thus the dose 200 mg Fe/dm(3) of soil allows the best
   performance of phytoremediation potential. Although plant growth is
   affected by treatments of 300, 400 and 500 mg Fe/dm(3) of soil and Fe
   accumulation is less, L. leucocephala is able to tolerate and
   phytostabilize soil Fe with potential for use in phytoremediation,
   mainly because it is a kind of phytostabilization of Fe. (C) 2021 SAAB.

Abstract = {PurposeThe carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations
   of leaves can reflect soil nutrient supply conditions and changes in
   soil. An understanding of species adaptability and nutrient use
   efficiency in extreme ecosystems can help land managers choose effective
   methods to improve management and community structure of introduced
   plants which may induce biological invasion and limit the regeneration
   of native species.Materials and methodsWe selected the Leucaena
   leucocephala forests in three ages (9, 15, and 26years old) in the
   Jiangjiagou Gully to study the relationships between (i) soil factors
   and forest age and (ii) leaf nutrient concentrations. Soil factors and
   leaf nutrients were measured in nine sampling quadrats of 10x10m of each
   plot. We used ANOVA to examine differences in leaf variables and soil
   factors at different ages of L. leucocephala forest. Pearson's
   correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were conducted to
   identify the relationships between soil factors and leaf variables.
   Then, we used analysis of covariance to examine combined effects of
   forest ages and soil factors on leaf variables.Results and
   discussionLeaf N was significantly correlated with available P, while
   leaf P was significantly correlated with both available P and available
   N. Leaf N and P had no significant relationship with soil total N and P.
   Leaf C:N:P stoichiometries had a higher significant correlation with
   total N, available N, and soil water content.ConclusionsOur findings
   illustrate that available N and available P are the main limitations for
   L. leucocephala, though available P imposed a stronger limitation than
   available N. Moreover, soil water content played an indispensable role
   on nutrient accumulation and the soil ecological environment. Our
   results provide useful information to improve L. leucocephala community
   structure and reduce soil degradation in a dry-hot valley.},

Abstract = {AimsTo evaluate the effects of condensed tannins (CTs) fractions of
   differing molecular weights (MWs) from a Leucaena leucocephala
   hybrid-Rendang on the rumen protozoal community invitro.
   Methods and ResultsThe effects of unfractionated CTs (F0) and CT
   fractions of different MWs (F1>F2>F3>F4>F5) on protozoal population and
   community were evaluated invitro using rumen microbes and ground guinea
   grass as the substrate. Higher-MW CT fractions F1 and F2 significantly
   (P<005) decrease the number of ciliate protozoa. The real-time PCR
   analysis showed that the total protozoa was significantly (P<005) lower
   in F0 and all CTs with fractions F1 and F2 having the lowest value.
   High-throughput sequencing of the partial 18S rRNA gene showed that the
   genus Entodinium significantly (P<005) decreased with increasing MWs of
   CT, whereas Anoplodinium-Diplodinium were significantly (P<005)
   increased. Inclusion of the highest MW CT fraction F1 decreased the
   relative abundance of the minor genera such as Eudiplodinium and
   Polyplastron compared to the control and CT fractions F2-F5.
   ConclusionCTs of differing MWs could reduce and alter the rumen protozoa
   population in vitro. This effect was more pronounced for higher-MW CTs.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThe high MW CTs should be considered
   as a feed supplement in the ruminant diet to reduce the protozoal
   population which are known to be associated with methanogens as a means
   to mitigate methane production in the rumen.},

Abstract = {Two trials are summarised in which the forage value of four browse
   species was evaluated as dried conserved dry season feed for dairying,
   either as an improved source of forage, or as a cheaper source of
   homegrown protein substituting for cottonseed meal. Cows were on a basic
   diet of maize silage and maize grain, plus/minus cottonseed meal. In one
   trial, 1.5 kg of sundried Acacia boliviana, Calliandra calothyrsus or
   Leucaena leucocephala replaced an equal mass of poor quality grass hay,
   and in the other about 5 kg sundried Acacia angustissima, Cajanus cajan,
   C. calothyrsus or Leucaena leucocephala was substituted for 3.3 kg
   cottonseed meal isonitrogenously. All trial forages were fed together
   with 2-3 g/kg polyethylene glycol (PEG) or Browse Plus (a commercial
   PEG-containing digestive modifier). Milk yields (kg/cow/d) in the first
   trial were: grass hay 11.36, Leucaena leucocephala 13.19, A. boliviana
   11.94 and C. calothyrsus 11.14 (P<0.001); and in the second trial:
   cottonseed meal 15.57, Leucaena leucocephala 14.36, C. cajan 12.79, A.
   angustissima 11.56 and C. calothyrsus 8.57 (P<0.01). Tree fodder
   polyphenolic characteristics were assessed in the first trial.
   Indications were that, despite the forages being fed together with PEG,
   anti-nutritional factors related to polyphenolic characteristics were
   still operative, particularly with A. angustissima/A. boliviana and C.
   calothyrsus. The potential for use of C. calothyrsus conserved as hay
   for dry season feed for dairying would appear to be limited and A.
   boliviana only moderate, whereas Leucaena leucocephala and C. cajan have
   good potential for this purpose with respect to forage value.},

Abstract = {Art experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of the foliage of
   Brosimum allicastrum and Leucaena leueocephala on the microbial
   population and the activity of the ruminal enzymes protease and
   cellulase. A completely randomized design with 3 x 7 factorial
   arrangement (three treatments and seven sampling hours) was used in
   vitro conditions. The treatments were: A) star grass (Cynodon
   nlemfuensis), B) star grass + Brosimum allicastrum and C) star grass +
   Leucaena leucocephala ev Peru. The technique of culture with mechanical
   agitation at 39 degreesC was applied. The samplings were carried out at
   0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after fermentation. The pH of the ruminal
   liquid was 7.02, 7.00 and 6.94 for A, B and C respectively. There was no
   effect on the concentration of short-chain, total and individual fatty
   acids, except butyric acid that was lower (P < 0.05) in the
   supplementation with B. allicastrum. The population of viable bacteria
   differed (P < 0.01) between treatments and decreased with the foliage of
   the two trees evaluated. Both B. allicastrum and L. leucocephala reduced
   the population of proteolytic bacteria (P < 0.01). The cellulolytic
   bacteria showed values of 2.69, 2.13 and 2.98 x 10(6) cfu x mL for the
   control, B. allicastrum and L. leucocephala, respectively. No effects
   were found in the activity of the ruminal microbial enzymes proteases
   kind cellulases. The concentration of protein in the ruminal liquid was
   higher in the treatments including the foliage of these trees. The
   protozoa population was of 6.92, 7.94 and 9.55 cell/ml for the
   treatments A, B and C, respectively. It is concluded that the inclusion
   of B. allicastrum or L. leucocephala reduces the population of
   proteolytic and total viable microorganisms. This suggests that there
   are factors in these plant species that act negatively on this ruminal
   microbial groups. Further studies are recommended to confirm these
   results.},

Abstract = {Raising tropical livestock is an important activity in southern Mexico.
   Leucaena leucocephala is a plant with great potential for utilization in
   these areas. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are renowned for their
   ability to improve the nutrition of plants.
   The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the growth response of
   Leucaena leucocephala to the inoculation with arbuscular endomycorrhizae
   and different doses of organic manure.
   The study was done under greenhouse conditions, in order to evaluate the
   effect of Arbuscular endomycorrihza and different quantities of cow
   manure on the development of growth and Leucaena leucocephala. The
   treatments had a completely randomized block design with factorial (7x2)
   arrangement with four replications. The application treatments resulted
   from the interaction of the following factors: fine pulverized cow
   manure (CM) in doses of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 12 t ha(-1) with and
   without Glomus intraradices(GI). The inoculation and application of CM
   was during the transplant, mixed with 10 g of sand with alfalfa roots
   colonized with (GI) and/or with the different doses of CM, in the six
   centimeters of topsoil. The variables were plant height (PH), stem
   diameter, (SD), number of leaves (NL), number of leaflets (N.L), root
   volume (RV), root dry weight (RDW), dry weight of biomass (DWB) and
   total percentage of endomycorrhiza colonization (PEC). The experiment
   lasted 180 days from planting until harvesting. The results show highly
   significant effects with Glomus intraradices for all variables. Cow
   manure was highly significant for all variables, except, stem diameter.
   The best response was obtained with 12 ton ha(-1) cow manure.},

   sprouts. Determination of antioxidant activity was carried out on
   ethanol extract of germinated seeds using beta-carotene bleaching assay.
   The results showed that the antioxidant activity of germinated seeds
   were affected by germination time. Germination for 4 days affected the
   greatest enhancement in antioxidant activity by 2.78 fold and caused a
   significant increment in total phenolic content by 7.29, beta-carotene
   by 3.27, ascorbic acid by 3.81 and alpha-tocopherol by 4.58 fold,
   respect to imbibed seeds. The total phenolics content was 53.42 +/- 0.22
   mg CAE/g dw, beta-carotene was 530.99 +/- 71.13 10(-3) mg/100 g,
   ascorbic acid was 152.37 +/- 2.06 mg/100 g, and alpha-tocopherol was
   59.27 +/- 0.10 mg/100 g sample. The findings suggested that the L.

Abstract = {The effect of feeding increasing levels of Leucaena leucocephala leaf
   hay on the potential fertility and feed intake of male highland sheep
   maintained on roughage diet was studied. In treatment 1 (NS), animals
   received only chickpea haulm. Treatments 2 (L100), 3 (L200) and 4 (L300)
   consisted of 100, 200 and 300 g per head per day of sun dried leucaena
   leaf hay while sheep under treatment 5 (C300) received 300 g per head
   per day of concentrate supplement. Chickpea haulm was offered ad-libitum
   to all groups and water and mineral licks were freely available.
   Addition of leucaena improved total dry matter (DM) and crude protein
   (CP) intake significantly without depressing the intake of the basal
   diet. Supplementation increased the percentage of motile cells (10 vs.
   76\% for L300) and mass activity/motility score (1.5 vs. 3.2 for L300)
   of spermatozoa while reducing the incidence of total morphologically
   defective sperm cells (34 vs. 5\% for L200). Volume of ejaculate (0.36
   vs. 1.1 ml for L200), sperm concentration (2.8 vs. 7.1 x 10(9) ml(-1)
   for L300), and total number of spermatozoa per ejaculate (1.96 vs. 5.92

Abstract = {Introduction: Leucaena leucocephala is a commonly used plant in the
   Ayurveda system of medicine to alleviate several ailments. Different
   parts of Leucaena leucocephala are used for the treatment of ailments
   such as diabetes, ascariasis, intestinal parasitism and trichinosis. It
   is also used as an emmenagogue, emollient and as nutritious forage for
   cattle. Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the plant
   extract's effect on memory and learning using in-vivo models and ex-vivo
   models. Methods: The plant extract was prepared by using the Soxhlet
   extraction procedure. The effect of the extract on nootropic activity
   was assessed against scopolamine-induced amnesia using different
   exteroceptive models such as Elevated plus maze, Y maze and Hebb
   William's maze. Acetylcholinesterase activity of the rat brain
   homogenate was estimated using Ellman's method. The activity of the
   extract was compared with the standard drug piracetam. Results: On
   pre-treatment with ethanolic extract of L. leucocephala, in-vivo studies
   showed significantly improved spatial learning and memory against
   scopolamine-induced amnesia in Wistar rat models in a dose-dependent
   manner. Ex-vivo studies of rat whole brain homogenate showed a
   significant decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity in extract-treated
   animals Conclusion: The ethanolic extract of the leaves of L.
   leucocephala showed significant nootropic potential against animals
   induced by amnesia using scopolamine.},

Abstract = {The abundant availability of Leucaena leucocephala (petai belalang) in
   Malaysia was one of the contributing factors of this research. The
   phytochemicals obtained from this plant will contribute towards many
   fields mainly medicine and it becomes more favorable as compared to the
   modern medicines used these days. Diseases such as cancer, high blood
   pressure and diabetes are very crucial, and it occurs frequently among
   all ages of citizens in Malaysia. Therefore, phytochemicals in this
   plant can be a great substitute of modern medicines. However, lignin is
   known to interfere with the cell wall polysaccharides digestion, and
   hence considered as an anti-quality component in forages. To improve
   phytochemicals extraction, an effective degradation method of lignin is
   in demand. Thus, the goal of the present study was to investigate the
   feasibility of using enzymatic hydrolysis by laccase from Trametes
   versicolor (LTV) to breakdown lignin using mild reaction condition. To
   clarify the effect of enzymatic hydrolysis, a preliminary study on the
   percentage of lignin removal was conducted that taking the effect of LTV
   concentration, incubation temperature and time into consideration. The
   results were then used to analyze total flavonoid contents (TFC) of
   L.leucocephala seed after the extraction by using microwave-assisted
   hydrodistillation (MAHD) method. In view of this, extraction temperature
   and time were varied. TFC was estimated by UVVIS spectrophotometer for
   quantification by using quercetin as standard. The result emerge from
   this study showed that the TFC was high in the extraction temperature of
   60 degrees C in 12 min with an average of 1639 mgQE/g.d.w and the lowest
   TFC was recorded at 30 degrees C with 677 mgQE/g.d.w. Further analysis
   showed that enzymatic hydrolysis has assisted the extraction of
   flavonoids, thus, provided scientific method to extract flavonoid as an
   alternative therapy for various diseases.},

Abstract = {Three bulls (Holstein x Zebu). eaullulated in the rumen with 415 +/- 22
   kg of liveweight (LW) were selected to study the in situ ruminal

   (N-ADF) and the enzymatic digestibility. of the nitrogen non-degraded in
   the rumen in Leucaena leucocephala ev CIAT-7929. Bags were introduced in
   the rumen for 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. The degradability was analyzed
   by non-lineal regression with the use of the model P = a +
   b{*}(1-e(-c{*}(t-to))). The values of degradability of the insoluble but
   degradable, fraction were 470.3, 417.5, 543.5, 602.1 and 24.6 g/kg of
   DM, when time was not a limitation. The Lag time of the different
   fractions was approximately 0.40, 5.6, 15.2, 1.0, 93 and 18.5 h for DM,
   NDF, ADF, Nt, N-NDF and N-ADF, respectively. The effective degradability
   (ED) of Nt, N-NDF and N-ADF ranged between 579-514, 265-172 aud 0.8-0.4
   g/kg of DM, respectively with different constants of ruminal re-change.
   For all the indicators, the dynamics of in situ ruminal degradability
   showed increase (P < 0.01) of the exponential type in time, except for
   N-ADF, where degradation was almost insignificant. In vitro
   digestibility of nitrogen non-degraded in the rumen reached values of
   480 g of digestible nitrogen/kg of non-degraded nitrogen, with 24 h of
   permanence of the samples in the rumen. The increase of the ruminal
   incubation time up to 48 h, increased the digestibility of the nitrogen
   of the diet. Aspects on the use of the different components of the fiber
   fractions of this legume in ruminants are discussed. The results
   demonstrated a high contribution of nitrogen from leucaena in the rumen.
   Also a characterization of the nitrogen bound to the different fractions
   aud of its degradation in bulls rumen was obtained.},

   had higher (P<0.05) net gas production and in vitro dry matter
   digestibility compared with other forages. Similarly, K. hospita had
   higher (P<0.05) concentration of total volatile fatty acid and propionic
   acid followed by L. leucocephala and G. sepium. The molar proportion of
   acetic and butyric acid did not differ among the forages. The outcome of
   this study present K. hospita as a good potential forage to be used in

Abstract = {Biosorbents (fiber, treated fiber, and charcoal) from the Leucaena
   leucocephala tree were prepared in this study. The potential of the
   biosorbents as metal capture (removal percentage \%R) for chromium (III)
   (Cr+3) from aqueous solution was examined. The concentrations of the
   Cr+3 solutions were measured before and after the adsorption to
   investigate the \%R using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS).
   Moreover, the specific surface area (A) of the biosorbent samples was
   evaluated after measuring the adsorbed acetic acid onto the samples.
   From the results, A and \%R were found in the order of charcoal >
   treated fiber > fiber. The highest values of A and \%R were about 423
   m(2)g(-1) and 97\%, respectively. This finding suggested the high
   potential of Leucaena charcoal usage as chromium ions capture compared
   to fibers and treated fibers.},

Abstract = {The biomass production from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (family
   Fabaceae) is a valuable source for chemical biorefinery. The bioactive
   molecules from the methanol extracts (MEs) from various parts of L.
   leucocephala grown in Egypt were evaluated. The antibacterial activity
   against the growth of Erwinia amylovora, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and
   Staphylococcus aureus was determined by the inhibition zones (IZs) and
   the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The antifungal activity
   against the growth of Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, and
   Alternaria solani was recorded by measuring the fungal growth inhibition
   (FGI \%) and MICs. The phytochemical compounds in the MEs were
   identified by HPLC-DAD, where the higher compounds identified (mg/kg ME)
   in seeds were benzoic acid (1520.44), myricetin (848.73), and rosmarinic
   acid (792.46); in roots, were benzoic acid (554.04), naringenin
   (419.99), and myricetin (205.51); in leaves were rosmarinic acid
   (4768.16), resveratrol (2983.99), quercetin (2052.43), myricetin
   (1432.63), and naringenin (1182.39); in branches, were rosmarinic acid
   (2230.26), resveratrol (1605.3), o-coumaric acid (691.16), and myricetin
   (681.93); in fruits were rosmarinic acid (431.43) and resveratrol
   (261.07); in stem-wood, were ellagic acid (1319.75), p-coumaric acid
   (1051.59), and ferulic acid (512.45); and in stem-bark, were resveratrol
   (1079.01), benzoic acid (1071.11), and catechol (305.51). The MEs at the
   concentration of 4000 mg/L from stem-wood, leaves, and stem-bark, the
   higher IZs against the growth of E. amylovora, A. tumefaciens, and S.
   aureus with values of 4.06 cm, 2.5 cm, and 2.63 cm, respectively, were
   found. The range of MICs values of MEs was 75-500 mg/L, 75-125 mg/L, and
   75-125 mg/L, against the growth of A. tumefaciens, E. amylovora, and S.
   aureus, respectively. MEs prepared from seeds, fruits (pod), and
   stem-bark at 4000 mg/L showed the higher FGI (100\%) against the growth
   of A. solani; MEs from seeds and branches observed the higher FGI values
   of 63.83\% and 63.6\%, respectively, against the growth of F. solani,
   and all MEs showed potent antifungal activity (FGI 100\%) against R.
   solani except for leaf ME (88.06\%). MICs were in the range of 250-500,
   250-500, and 500-1000 mg/L against A. solani, F. solani, and R. solani,
   respectively. At 500 mg/L, the roots ME showed the highest total
   antioxidant activity (94.30\%) compared to vitamin C (VC) (98.30\%) at
   100 mg/L. The EC50 values of the MEs from seeds, fruits, stem-bark,
   branches, stem-wood, leaves, and roots were 424.24 mg/L, 131.40 mg/L,
   341.78 mg/L, 380.50 mg/L, 153.59 mg/L, 153.59 mg/L, and 129.89 mg/L
   compared with VC (6.88 mg/L). In conclusion, the botanical parts of L.
   leucocephala have several bioactive compounds, which can act as
   promising antimicrobial and antioxidant properties.},

Abstract = {Lignin, a major constituent of plant call wall, is a phenolic
   heteropolymer. It plays a major role in the development of plants and
   their defense mechanism against pathogens. Therefore Lignin biosynthesis
   is one of the critical metabolic pathways. In lignin biosynthesis, the
   Cinnamoyl CoA reductase is a key enzyme which catalyzes the first step
   in the pathway. Cinnamoyl CoA reductase provides the substrates which
   represent the main transitional molecules of lignin biosynthesis
   pathway, exhibits a high in vitro kinetic preference for feruloyl CoA.
   In present study, the three-dimensional model of cinnamoyl CoA reductase
   was constructed based on the crystal structure of Grape Dihydroflavonol
   4-Reductase. Furthermore, the docking studies were performed to
   understand the substrate interactions to the active site of CCR. It
   showed that residues ARG51, ASN52, ASP54 and ASN58 were involved in
   substrate binding. We also suggest that residue ARG51 in CCR is the
   determinant residue in competitive inhibition of other substrates. This
   structural and docking information have prospective implications to
   understand the mechanism of CCR enzymatic reaction with feruloyl CoA,
   however the approach will be applicable in prediction of substrates and
   engineering 3D structures of other enzymes as well.},

Abstract = {Young Landim wethers were either free-range or tethered on 3-m ropes on
   native pasture in semi-arid Southern Mozambique. A leucaena leaf
   supplement at 2\% BW (DM basis) was given to half of the animals. The
   experiment took place over the dry season of 2 years with very different
   rainfall (327 mm and 723 mm). There was no interaction (P > 0.05)
   between physical restriction and supplementation for average daily gain
   (ADG) or carcass characteristics in either year. In the drier year
   restriction lowered ADGs to 18.6\% of the unrestricted animals' ADG (P =
   0.0018). In the wetter year this same effect resulted in ADGs in the
   tethered animals of 36.9\% of the free-range animals' ADG (P = 0.001).
   Goats supplemented with leucaena gained 184\% of the BW gained by the
   unsupplemented animals in the low-rainfall year (P = 0.0038) and 168\%
   in the high-rainfall year (P = 0.001). Carcass \% of BW as well as
   kidney, heart, carcass and liver masses were higher and digestive tract
   \% of BW were lower in free-range animals (P < 0.05) only in the
   high-rainfall year. Carcass and kidney weights were higher (P < 0.05) in
   the drier year and liver higher (P < 0.05) during both years for the
   supplemented animals. Tethering appeared to affect goat development
   negatively, especially in the dry year, whereas supplementation with
   leucaena was equally beneficial in dry and wet years.},

Abstract = {Background: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death affecting women
   in developing country. Several medicinal plants have recently increasing
   in the involvement of chemotherapeutic drugs development, including
   Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Dolichandrone serrulata (DS). Objectives:
   The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-proliferative and
   anti-migration effects of LL leaves and D. serrulata flowers ethanolic
   extracts against human cervical cancer cell line. Materials and Methods:
   The content of total phenolic and flavonoid and antioxidant activity of
   extracts collected from different fractions were determined. MTT assay,
   cell morphology, and wound healing assay were established to observe
   anti-proliferative and anti-migration effects in HeLa cell line.
   Results: Total phenolic contents of both medicinal plant extracts and
   flavonoids content of LL extract were observed highest in ethyl acetate
   fraction, while flavonoid content of D. serrulata extract was greatly
   observed in hexane fraction. LL extract in ethyl acetate fraction showed
   the most promising result in antioxidant activity assay using both
   2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and
   2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid with inhibition
   concentration for fifty percent of 4.917 +/- 0.955 and 11.005 +/- 1.491,
   respectively. In cytotoxicity test, both herbal extract at concentration
   of 250 mu g/ml were significantly reduced HeLa cell viability comparing
   with the control. The assay for wound healing showed that both LL and D.
   serrulata extract at concentration of 125 mu g/ml could significantly
   decrease the migration rate of HeLa cell comparing with the control and
   Trolox-treated groups. Conclusion: LL and D. serrulata ethanolic
   extracts (125-500 mu g/ml) have been proposed in this study of
   possessing antioxidant and anti-migration activity, as well as the
   ability in induce cancer cell death.},

Abstract = {Condensed tannins (CTs) form insoluble complexes with proteins and are
   able to protect them from degradation, which could lead to rumen bypass
   proteins. Depending on their degrees of polymerization (DP) and
   molecular weights, CT fractions vary in their capability to bind
   proteins. In this study, purified condensed tannins (CTs) from a
   Leucaena leucocephala hybrid were fractionated into five different
   molecular weight fractions. The structures of the CT fractions were
   investigated using C-13-NMR. The DP of the CT fractions were determined
   using a modified vanillin assay and their molecular weights were
   determined using Q-TOF LC-MS. The protein-binding affinities of the
   respective CT fractions were determined using a protein precipitation
   assay. The DP of the five CT fractions (fractions F1-F5) measured by the
   vanillin assay in acetic acid ranged from 4.86 to 1.56. The C-13-NMR
   results showed that the CT fractions possessed monomer unit structural
   heterogeneity. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of the
   different fractions were 1265.8, 1028.6, 652.2, 562.2, and 469.6 for
   fractions F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5, respectively. The b values
   representing the CT quantities needed to bind half of the maximum
   precipitable bovine serum albumin increased with decreasing molecular
   weight-from fraction F1 to fraction F5 with values of 0.216, 0.295,
   0.359, 0.425, and 0.460, respectively. This indicated that higher
   molecular weight fractions of CTs from L. leucocephala have higher
   protein-binding affinities than those with lower molecular weights.},

   indicated that L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) ethanolic leaves extracts
   growing in Ariana have the highest levels in phenolic and flavonoid
   contents and showed remarkable antioxidant activities. Furthermore, L.
   leucocephala (Lam de wit) oils extracted from seeds growing in two
   locations at different maturation stage were analyzed using GC-FID to
   determine fatty acids profiles and significant differences (p < 0.05)
   were observed between growing area and maturation stage. In addition,
   both oils and ethanolic extract of L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) were
   able to limit gram positive and gram negative bacteria, Candida species
   as well as the tested filamentous fungi species, and the examination of
   results prove that the diameter of zone inhibition was related to the
   tested microorganisms. The results credibly indicate that L.

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala has been widely used in the ecological restoration
   and protection of engineering slopes in Xiluodu hydropower project. The
   erosion resistance, scour resistance, shear strength of soil-fibrous
   root systems and tensile strength of fibrous roots in shallow soil layer
   were tested to evaluate the effects of L. leucocephala communities on
   soil conservation and slope protection. The results showed that
   soil-fibrous root system of L. leucocephala community had significant
   effects on soil conservation and slope stabilization in shallow soil
   layer. The average erosion resistance, scour resistance and shear
   strength were increased by 66.2\%, 183.3\% and 217.0\% contrast with
   that of the control, respectively. The strengthening effects increased
   with the increase of community age. Correlation analysis indicated that
   the performance of soil-fibrous root systems had significant positive
   correlation with root system biomass. It suggested that the differences
   in root system biomass caused the changes of fibrous root systems in
   soil conservation and slope stabilization. Further analysis indicated
   that the performance of L. leucocephala-Buxus microphylla community was
   better than that of pure L. leucocephala community in same age in soil
   conservation and slope protection. Appropriate intermediate thinning and
   species introduction should by carry out in L. leucocephala community to
   improve the effects of soil-root system on soil conservation and slope
   protection.},

   (0, 8.3, 16.7, and 33. g kg-1 soil), Dactyladenia barteri (syn. Acioa
   barteri; 0 and 16.7 g), and their mixtures was studied in the laboratory
   using the aerobic incubation-leaching method. N mineralization in
   untreated soils and in soils supplemented with 8.3 g leucaena leaves was
   41 - 53\% higher in the soil from Onne (pH 4.7) than in the soil from
   lbadan (pH 6.2), but the organic N content was similar with these
   treatments in the leachates of the soils from both locations. The
   application of 16.7 or 33.3 g of either or both type of leaves reduced
   the rate of mineral N production during the first 4 weeks, particularly
   in soils treated with dactyladenia leaves (C:N = 36). After this lag
   period, N mineralization proceeded at a faster rate in the soil from
   lbadan treated with 16.7 or 33.3 g of leucaena leaves (C:N = 12), even
   in the presence of dactyladenia leaves. In lbadan soil, after 12 weeks,
   mineral N apparently derived from leaves of both dactyladenia and
   leucaena averaged 6.3\% of the N applied, and organic N from leaves
   averaged 9.5\%. The addition of dactyladenia and leucaena leaves did not
   increases the mineral N content in the acid soil from Onne but leaching
   of soluble organic N with addition of 16.7 or 33.3 g of leaves
   contributed an N-mineralizable pool of 5.9\% of the N applied.},

Abstract = {Leucaena gum derived from seeds of Leucaena leucocephala was evaluated
   as an emulsifying agent. Liquid paraffin emulsions (o/w) containing 30
   per cent liquid paraffin in water were formulated using leucaena seed

   containing equivalent concentration of acacia were also prepared for
   comparison. All the emulsions prepared were stored at room temperature
   and studied for stability at various time intervals for 8 weeks. In
   assessing the emulsifying properties of leucaena seed gum the creaming
   rate, globule size analysis, and rate of coalescence were evaluated. The
   effects of centrifugation, pH, temperature changes, and electrolytes on
   the stability of emulsion were investigated. The result of these
   investigations show that leucaena seed gum possesses better emulsifying
   properties as compared to gum acacia and could be used to formulate

Abstract = {cDNA and genomic clones of cinnamoyl CoA reductase measuring 1011 and
   2992 bp were isolated from a leguminous pulpwood tree Leucaena
   leucocephala, named as LlCCR. The cDNA exhibited 80-85\% homology both
   at the nucleotide and amino acid levels with other known sequences. The
   genomic sequence contained five exons and four introns. Sense and
   antisense constructs of LlCCR were introduced in tobacco plants to up
   and down-regulate this key enzyme of lignification. The primary
   transformants showed a good correlation between CCR transcript levels
   and its activity. Most of the CCR down-regulated lines displayed stunted
   growth and development, wrinkled leaves and delayed senescence. These
   lines accumulated unusual phenolics like ferulic and sinapic acids in
   cell wall. Histochemical staining suggested reduction in aldehyde units
   and increased syringyl over guaiacyl (S/G) ratio of lignin. Anatomical
   studies showed thin walled, elongated xylem fibres, collapsed vessels
   with drastic reduction of secondary xylem. The transmission electron
   microscopic studies revealed modification of ultrastructure and
   topochemical distribution of wall polysaccharides and lignin in the
   xylem fibres. CCR down-regulated lines showed increased thickness of
   secondary wall layers and poor lignification of S2 and S3 wall layers.
   The severely down-regulated line AS17 exhibited 24.7\% reduction of
   Klason lignin with an increase of 15\% holocellulose content.
   Contrarily, the CCR up-regulated lines exhibited robust growth,
   development and significant increase in lignin content. The altered
   lignin profiles observed in transgenic tobacco lines support a role for
   CCR down-regulation in improving wood properties of L. leucocephala
   exclusively used in the pulp and paper industry of India.},

Abstract = {Legume is the best source of protein to ruminant Tannin content in
   legumes can provide protein by pass for ruminant. This study was
   conducted to determine the effect supplementation of legumes (Leucaena
   leucocephala) as substitute of concentrate on nutrient digestibility and
   microbial protein synthesis of the completed feed based on ammoniated
   rice straw. The study was conducted in an in vitro used a randomized
   block design where there were 3 treatments dan 5 replications. The
   treatments were A. 40\% ammoniated rice straw + 60\% concentrate, B.
   40\% ammoniated rice straw + 50\% concentrate + 10\% Leucaena
   leucocephala, C. 40\% ammoniated rice straw + 40\% concentrate +10, +
   20\% Leucaena leucocephala. The results showed that the addition of of
   Leucaena leucocephala had increased the digestibility of DM, OM, CP and
   microbial protein synthesis (p< 0.05). Increased doses of Leucaena
   leucocephala until 20\% decreased digestion of nutrition compared with
   dose 10\% but was still higher than control. In conclusion, the
   supplementation of Leucaena leucocephala on completed feed based on
   ammoniated rice straw in vitro can increase nutrient degradability.
   Supplementation of 10\% and 20\% Leucaena leucochepala were suitable to
   be used for further studies, therefore in vivo experiment is required to
   study the effects on animal production.},

Abstract = {The exploitation of wood energy purposes (firewood and charcoal) has
   caused reduction in native vegetation, added to this, problems are
   generated for fauna, flora and soil. The objective of the research was
   to evaluate the energy characteristics of charcoal Aroeira (Myracrodruon
   urundeuva Allemao) and Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) R. de
   Wit). Suppression of five specimens of urundeuva Myracrodruon and
   Leucaena leucocephala was performed, following quality, phenological and
   health criteria. Carbonization was performed in duplicate, using
   anhydrous wood. Also, it was carried out the coal chemical analysis and
   the determination of true and bulk densities. The gross calorific value
   was determined by adiabatic calorimeter. The experiment was arranged in
   a completely randomized design (DIC) and the values were submitted to
   analysis of variance by the test ``F{''} at 5\% of probability level.
   The Myracrodruon urundeuva wood and Leucaena leucocephala showed no
   statistical differences, with 41.22\% and 40.59\% of charcoal. The
   apparent density of charcoal Myracrodruon urundeuva (0.59 g / cm(3)) was
   higher than that of Leucaena leucocephala (0.39 g / cm(3)), but the
   species were similar to the true density of charcoal, with 1.21 g /
   cm(3) and 1.11 g / cm(3), respectively. Similarly, the gross calorific
   value of charcoal showed no difference between species the wood,
   Myracrodruon urundeuva (6869 kcal / kg) and Leucaena leucocephala (6977
   kcal / kg). The amount of released volatiles and ash produced was higher
   on the wood Myracrodruon urundeuva with 33.87\% and 3.79\%. The fixed
   carbon content was higher in Leucaena leucocephala (67.15\%). The
   species showed similar energy characteristics so the wood of Leucaena
   leucocephala can be used for the production and the use of charcoal when
   compared to the native species which are already known and are used for
   the same purposes.},

Abstract = {The nutritional attributes of Leucaena leucocephala and the factors
   limiting its use in poultry diets have been the subject of considerable
   research over the past 10 years. Recent data confirm the previous
   findings concerning the favourable proximate composition of Leucaena
   leaf meal (LLM), although the carotenoid content of this legume is now
   emerging as its major asset for the pigmentation of egg yolks and
   broiler carcasses. Toxicological evaluation continues to be a major
   feature of  research on Leucaena. Following recent innovative
   developments in analytical chemistry, there is now more reliable
   information pertaining to the concentration of mimosine in LLM and seeds
   and to the degradation of this amino acid to 3-hydroxy-4 (1H)-pyridone.
   Data on the concentrations of tannins, trypsin inhibitors, galactomannan
   gums, saponins and flavonols are also reviewed in this paper.
   Detoxification of Leucaena for poultry remains an outstanding problem,
   since there are limitations to conventional approaches such as plant
   breeding and the use of heat treatments. Considerable amelioration of
   the adverse effects of LLM may be obtained by the use of dietary
   additives such as ferric sulphate and polyethylene glycol. However,
   these improvements rely upon appropriate adjustments for the low
   apparent metabolisable energy (AME) value of LLM. Thus despite recent
   advances, the low AME of LLM remains a challenging issue for the future.},

   actions on female rat reproduction},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {211},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Leucaena feed has been reported to cause disruptive effects on livestock
   reproduction, such as low calving percentages in cows, abortion in
   female goats and pigs, dead fetuses and fetal resorption in pregnant
   rats. In this study, the effects of Leucaena on different female
   reproductive variables were analyzed in two different reproductive
   conditions: gonadally intact and ovariectomized (OVX) female rats.
   Leucaena (LEU) was administered to females in both experimental
   conditions for 30 consecutive days. The effects of the legume extract
   were compared with those of Daidzein (DAI), a phytoestrogen, and of the
   female hormone estradiol (E-2). In intact females, LEU disrupted the
   estrous cycle and female sexual behavior, decreased the number of
   follicles and corpora lutea, increased uterine and vaginal epithelium in
   proestrus and diestrus periods, increased uterine and vaginal relative
   weights during diestrus, and decreased serum progesterone during
   proestrus. All these effects were similar to those of DAI but lower than
   E-2-induced effects. In OVX females, LEU decreased body weight, induced
   lordosis, stimulated vaginal epithelium cornification, increased vaginal
   weight, and augmented vaginal epithelium thickness. Again, these effects
   were similar to the effects of DAI and lower than the effects observed
   with E-2. These results indicate that, in gonadally intact females, LEU
   can produce antiestrogenic effects in sexual behavior but estrogenic
   effects on uterine and vaginal weight and epithelia, without modifying
   serum levels of E-2. In OVX females, in total absence of endogenous E-2,
   LEU induced estrogenic effects on vaginal weight and epithelia, as well
   as on sexual behavior.},

Title = {EVALUATION OF IPIL-IPIL (Leucaena leucocephala) SEED GUM
   AS CO-ENCAPSULATING AGENT FOR TARGETED AND CONTROLLED DELIVERY OF
   POWDERED INSULIN PLANT (Chamaecostus cuspidatus)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY AND FOOD SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is the most common non-communicable
   disease in the Philippines, characterized by increased blood glucose
   levels brought by low insulin production or insulin resistance.
   Chamaecostus cuspidatus is a medicinal plant known for its
   glucose-lowering property. The controlled release of the C. cuspidatus
   leaves must be achieved to maximize its antidiabetic property. Leucaena
   leucocephala is an endemic tree in the Philippines, having its seed as a
   source of possible co-encapsulating material for drug delivery.
   Galactomannan, as the main component of the isolated seed gum, can be
   used as a substitute for an effective moderate drug release to its
   intended site. Thus, this study evaluates the drug release property and
   stability of seed gum as a co-encapsulating agent for targeted and
   controlled delivery of the C. cuspidatus leaves. The encapsulation
   process of the C. cuspidatus leaves was done through the extrusion
   method. The stability of the encapsulation was evaluated through in
   vitro gastrointestinal simulation analysis and was examined using
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared
   spectrometer (FTIR), and field emission scanning electron microscope
   (FE-SEM) to verify its surface morphology. The capsules were observed to
   fully disintegrate at the fed state (pH 5.4) of the simulated
   gastrointestinal conditions, which is the target site. The fingerprint
   on the FTIR spectra of the encapsulated drug presented indicates the
   successful incorporation of the powdered leaves inside the encapsulating
   material. Morphological micrographs have shown that the resulting
   capsules were fairly in spherical, having a size of approximately 3.8
   mm. Ridges and pores are also present on the surface of the capsules for
   their immediate disintegration and hydration. Therefore, the L.
   leucocephala seed gum can be a potential candidate as a co-encapsulating
   material suitable for effective, targeted, and controlled delivery of C.
   cuspidatus leaves for maximum antidiabetic benefits.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of replacing fish meal with Leucaena
   leucocephala leaf powder on survival, growth performance, digestive
   enzyme activities, biochemical body composition and muscle texture of
   the white -leg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931). Five different
   diets were examined, by replacing fish meal with L. leucocephala leaf
   powder at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20\%, in triplicates. Shrimps were stocked in
   0.5 m3 tanks @ 70 shrimps per tank and fed on the experimental diets for
   a period of 60 days. The results showed that the survival rate (\%),
   daily weight gain (g day-1), specific growth rate (\% day-1), feed
   intake (\% fish-1 day-1), feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency
   ratio, and protein retention were not significantly different (p>0,05)
   among the treatment groups. The values of alpha-amylase and pepsin in
   the stomach and chymotrypsin (mU min-1 mg protein-1) in the intestine
   were not significantly different among treatments. However, the value of
   alpha-amylase in the intestine was significantly higher in animals fed
   diets that replaced fish meal with L. leucocephala leaf powder at 0, 5
   and 10\% compared to other treatments. The biochemical constituents
   (except for lipid) and the texture (N) of shrimp meat were not
   significantly different among treatment groups. The results suggested
   that L. leucocephala leaf powder could replace fish meal up to 20\% in
   white-leg shrimp diets.},

Abstract = {Water soluble gums also known as hydrocolloids are increasingly finding
   applications in the pharmaceutical and food industry due to their
   versatile functional properties. They possess considerable use in food
   and pharmaceutical industries as emulsifying, thickening and gelling
   agents. In the present investigation a heteropolysaccharide
   galactomannan was extracted from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) seeds by
   an aqueous method, characterized for its compositional analysis
   (mannose: galactose ratio), physicochemical and functional properties
   (solubility), and mechanical properties. The extracted gum was
   derivatized to form its carboxymethyl derivative and the method of its
   derivatization was optimized by varying the reaction parameters. The
   native and derivatized gum was characterized by FTIR, XRD, DSC, NMR, SEM
   and elemental analysis, etc. The yield of Leucaena leucocephala
   galactomannan (LLG) was found to be 20\% (w/w). The optimized parameters
   for carboxymethylation reaction (degree of substitution 0.805) were
   found to be 6.0 g NaOH, 10.0 g MCA, at 60 degrees C for 4 h. The
   physicochemical and functional characteristics of native and derivatized

Abstract = {Heterologous expression of eukaryotic genes in bacterial system is an
   important method in synthetic biology to characterize proteins. It is a
   widely used method, which can be sometimes quite challenging, as a
   number of factors that act along the path of expression of a transgene
   to mRNA, and mRNA to protein, can potentially affect the expression of a
   transgene in a heterologous system. Here, we describe a method for
   successful cloning and expression of mimosinase-encoding gene from
   Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) in E. coli as the heterologous host.
   Mimosinase is an important enzyme especially in the context of metabolic
   engineering of plant secondary metabolite as it catalyzes the
   degradation of mimosine, which is a toxic secondary metabolite found in
   all Leucaena and Mimosa species. We also describe the methods used for
   characterization of the recombinant mimosinase.},

Abstract = {Serine proteinase inhibitors are widely distributed in nature and
   inhibit the activity of enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin. These
   proteins interfere with the physiological processes such as germination,
   maturation and form the first line of defense against the attack of seed
   predator. The most thoroughly examined plant serine proteinase
   inhibitors are found in the species of the families Leguminosae,
   Graminae, and Solanaceae. Leucaena leucocephala belongs to the family
   Leguminosae. It is widely used both as an ornamental tree as well as
   cattle food. We have constructed a three-dimensional model of a serine
   proteinase inhibitor from L. leucocephala seeds (LTI) complexed with
   trypsin. The model was built based on its comparative homology with
   soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) using the program, MODELLER6. The
   quality of the model was assessed stereochemically by PROCHECK. LTI
   shows structural features characteristic of the Kunitz type trypsin
   inhibitor and shows 39\% residue identity with STI. LTI consists of 172
   amino acid residues and is characterized by two disulfide bridges. The
   protein is a dimer with the two chains being linked by a disulfide
   bridge. Despite the high similarity in the overall tertiary structure,
   significant differences exist at the active site between STI and LTI.
   The present study aims at analyzing these interactions based on the
   available amino acid sequences and structural data. We have also studied
   some functional sites such as phosphorylation, myristoylation, which can
   influence the inhibitory activity or complexation with other molecules.
   Some of the differences observed at the active site and functional sites
   can explain the unique features of LTI. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDMolecular weights (MWs) and their chemical structures are the
   primary factors determining the influence of condensed tannins (CTs) on
   animal nutrition and methane (CH4) production in ruminants. In this
   study the MWs of five CT fractions from Leucaena leucocephala
   hybrid-Rendang (LLR) were determined and the CT fractions were
   investigated for their effects on CH4 production and rumen fermentation.
   RESULTSThe number-average molecular weight (M-n) of fraction F1 (1265.8
   Da), which was eluted first, was the highest, followed by those of
   fractions F2 (1028.6 Da), F3 (652.2 Da), F4 (562.2 Da) and F5 (469.6
   Da). The total gas (mL g(-1) dry matter (DM)) and CH4 production
   decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing MWs of the CT
   fractions, but there were no significant (P > 0.05) differences between
   the CT fractions and control on DM degradation. However, the in vitro N
   disappearance decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with the inclusion of
   CT fraction F1 (highest MW) compared with the control and other
   fractions (F2-F5). The inclusion of CT fraction F1 also significantly
   decreased (P < 0.05) total volatile fatty acid and acetic acid
   concentrations compared with the control. The acetic/propionic acid
   ratio was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) by fraction F1 but not by
   the control and other fractions (F2-F5).
   CONCLUSIONThe CT fractions of different MWs from LLR could affect rumen
   fermentation and CH4 production, and the impact was more pronounced for
   the CT fraction with a higher MW. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry},

Abstract = {Soils from seven sites on the island of Jamaica were assayed for the
   symbiotic diazotrophs Frankia and Rhizobium using serial dilutions. Most
   probable number and least squares regression methods were used to
   estimate each soil's capacity to nodulate native Myrica cerifera, exotic
   Leucaena leucocephala and exotic Casuarina cunninghamiana. The sample
   sites included a montane forest, a slash-and-burn agricultural site,
   reclaimed bauxite mining areas, abandoned sugar cane fields, and a
   garden plot. None of the host plants used in the bioassay were present
   on the sites samples except for scattered L. leucocephala on one site.
   Frankia capable of nodulating M. cerifera, which is native to Jamaican
   highlands, occurred at all sites sampled. No C. cunninghamiana-infective
   Frankia was detected in soils sampled. Only soils from one site on the
   tropical coastal plain harbored rhizobia able to nodulate L.
   leucocephala (37 nodulation units cm(-3) of soil). A subset of nodulated
   M. cerifera and L. leucocephala reduced acetylene to ethylene indicating
   nitrogenase activity. The slash-and-burn agricultural site, which was
   situated at an elevation of 200 m and possessed both high natural
   fertility and high soil moisture-supplying capacity, had significantly
   greater Myrica infectious capacity (1 000 nodulation units cm(-3) of
   soil) than the other sites (7-207 nodulation units cm(-3) of soil). A
   planned, paired comparison revealed that a recently cultivated sugar
   cane field and a recently reclaimed bauxite mining site together had
   significantly less Myrica-infective Frankia (4 nodulation units cm(-3)
   of soil) than a corresponding pair of sites consisting of a sugar cane
   field abandoned for 25 years and a bauxite mining site reclaimed 20
   years before sampling (118 nodulation units cm(-3) of soil). Results
   indicate that Myrica-infective Frankia units vary from site to site in
   accordance with soil type and soil history, that Jamaican sites sampled
   lack soil Frankia populations capable of nodulating a casuarina host,
   that rhizobial symbionts capable of nodulating L. leucocephala may be
   geographically restricted to lowlands in Jamaica, and that the
   occurrence of Frankia in these soils is independent of host plant
   presence.},

   Supplementation of the animals with browse resulted to (P<0.05) higher
   average daily weight gains (ADG) of 157.1 g day(-1) in T4 than the
   animals fed on T, (114.3 g day(-1)) and T3 (42.9 g day(-1)), and even to
   those fed on T, (control), which lost weight (-71.4 g day(-1)). Improved
   weight gains were mainly due to corrected feed nitrogen (N) or CP due to
   supplementation of the animals with browse fodder. Too low CP of the NPH
   would not meet the normal requirements of CP (80 g CP kg(-1) DM) for
   optimal rumen microbial function in ruminants. Higher ADG due to LLM
   (T4) and NLM (T2) supplementation suggest optimised weight gains due to
   browse supplementation (20\% of expected DMI); while lower weight gains
   from supplementation with PLM (T3) indicate the possible utilisation of
   A. polyacantha leaves to overcome weight losses especially during dry
   seasons. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Adult Jamunapari breed goats (n = 24) were randomly assigned to four
   iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric pelleted diets containing 97 thigh
   level; HL), 60 (medium level; ML), 20 (low level, LL) and O (control)
   percent sun-dried Leucaena lencocephala foliage and fed ad libitum for
   one year. L. leucocephala supplementation increased total DM intake, (g
   kg(-0.75)) from 70.4 +/- 2.3 in the control group to 94.1 +/- 6.9 in HL
   (P < 0.01). The digestibility of most of the nutrients was depressed (P
   < 0.05) with increasing dietary levels of Leucaena. All the goats were
   in positive nitrogen balance, but daily nitrogen retention decreased (P
   < 0.05) at medium and high Leucaena levels as a result of the poor
   utilization of the high protein content of the foliage. The nutritive
   value in terms of digestible crude protein (DCP) and total digestible
   nutrients (TDN) of Leucaena-supplemented diets was lower (P < 0.05) than
   the control. However, DCP and TDN intake was comparable among diets.
   None of the blood biochemical constituents (Haemoglobin, blood urea
   nitrogen) and activities of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase
   and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of
   experimental feeding varied significantly due to dietary treatment.
   Histopathological examination of the thyroid glands of the goats
   sacrificed at the end of the experiment did not reveal any sign of
   colloidal goiter associated with mimosine toxicity. However, mild to
   moderate hyperplasia and degenerative changes in focal area were
   observed. No significant pathological changes were observed in vital
   organs (lungs, liver, kidney, heart, testes and intestine) irrespective
   of dietary treatment. The apparent comparable performance observed in
   goats fed sun-dried pelleted Leucaena foliage suggests the possibility
   of its long-term use as a sole feed for the maintenance of stall fed
   goats without any significant deleterious effect. (C) 1998 Elsevier

   bp cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (LlCAD) genes were isolated from

   into tobacco via Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404. Histochemical
   observations of transgenic lines indicated tissue-specific expression of
   GUS in the vascular tissues of leaves, stems, and roots. These results
   demonstrate that GUS expression driven by either LlCCR or LlCAD
   promoters were involved in lignifying tissues, and more specifically in
   differentiating xylem cells. This observed tissue-specific expression
   driven by either LlCCR or LlCAD promoters is sufficient for reducing the

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit seeds, also known as river tamarind,
   contain sulfhydryl compounds that exhibit antioxidant effects. However,
   these seeds also possess a toxic effect from mimosine. In this study,
   the river tamarind seeds were extracted using a natural deep eutectic
   solvent (NADES) based UAE. Among six NADES compositions screened,
   choline chloride-glycerol (ChCl-Gly) and choline chloride-sucrose
   (ChCl-Suc) were selected to be further optimized using a Box-Behnken
   Design in the RSM. The optimization of total sulfhydryl content was
   performed in 17 runs using three variables, namely water content in
   NADES (39\%, 41\%, and 43\%), extraction time (5, 10, and 15 min), and
   the liquid-solid ratio (3, 5, and 7 mL/g). The highest concentration of
   sulfhydryls was obtained from ChCl-Gly-UAE (0.89 mg/g sample) under the
   conditions of a water content in NADES of 41\% (v/v) and a liquid-solid
   ratio of 3 mL/g for 15 min, followed by that of from ChCl-Suc-UAE
   extract under the conditions of water content in NADES of 43\% (v/v) and
   the liquid-solid ratio of 3 mL/g for 10 min with total sulfhydryl level
   was 0.67 mg/g sample. The maceration method using 30\% ethanol resulted
   in the lowest level of sulfhydryls with a value of 0.52 mg/g. The
   mimosine compounds obtained in the NADES-based UAE (ChCl-Suc and
   ChCl-Gly) extracts were 4.95 and 7.67 mg/g, respectively, while 12.56
   mg/g in the 30\% ethanol-maceration extract. The surface morphology of
   L. leucocephala seed before and after extraction was analyzed using
   scanning electron microscopy. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
   use of ChCl-Suc and ChCl-Gly in NADES-based UAE is more selective in
   attracting sulfhydryl compounds than that of 30\% ethanol-maceration
   extraction.},

Abstract = {Afforestation is an effective approach for restoring degraded ecological
   functions in the dry-hot valleys of southwest China. Afforestation can
   affect soil carbon and nitrogen storage; however, how it affects soil P
   fractions, and their driving factors. is poorly understood in this
   region. To address these questions, we conducted a field study of
   Leucaena leucocephala plantations at three different stand age sites (3,
   10, and 20 years) and an adjacent natural shrub-grass community control
   site to investigate changes in soil total phosphorus (Pt), Pi (inorganic
   phosphorus), Po (organic phosphorus), and phosphorus (P) fractions and
   their driving factors. Soil Pt, Po, labile P, and moderately labile P
   significantly increased in the Leucaena leucocephala plantation compared
   with the natural shrub grass site, and the Leucaena leucocephala
   plantation increased soil Pt content by significantly increasing soil
   Po. Soil Pt, Po, Pi, labile P, moderately labile P and non-labile P were
   not significantly different among the different stages of the Leucaena
   leucocephala plantation, and soil Pt and its fractions were all
   significantly higher in the middle-age forest stage of the Leucaena
   leucocephala plantation. These results indicate that Leucaena
   leucocephala plantations increased the soil P transformation ability,
   and soil Po played a critical role in sustaining soil P availability.
   The middle-age forest stage of Leucaena leucocephala plantations had the
   best conditions for P stocks and P conversion capacity. The abundance of
   actinomycetes and fungi showed significant positive relationships with
   soil Pi fractions (NaHCO3-Pi, NaOH-Pi, and NaOHu.s.-Pi); soil Pt and
   moderately labile P were significantly and directly influenced by fungal
   abundance. Soil organic carbon (SOC), NH4+-N, and NO3--N showed
   significant and positive relationships with the soil Pi fractions
   (NaHCO3-Pi, NaHCO3-Po, and HCl-Po). SOC and NO3--N were the key drivers
   of soil Pt, labile P, moderately labile P and non-labile fractions.
   These results indicate that abiotic and biotic factors differently
   affected the soil P fractions and Pt in Leucaena leucocephala
   plantations in the dry-hot valley.},

   mutants for forage plants in vitro. IBA (Indole butyric acid) is one
   type of auxin that can induce rooting and growth in plants. This study
   aimed to select the morphological characteristics of the acid-tolerant
   Leucaena leucocephala mutant to the addition of the hormone IBA in
   tissue culture. The design used in this study was a completely
   randomized design (CRD) with lamtoro plant explants as many as 11
   acid-tolerant mutant lines pH 3.4 resulting from 400 gy irradiation
   which had been treated on 300 ppm Al3 acid media, namely the K1-K11
   strain (mutant+MS+1ppm IBA) and 2 parent trees Leucaena leucocephala
   without gamma irradiation, namely PO as Leucaena leucocephala
   parent+MS+0ppm IBA, P1 as Leucaena leucocephala parent+MS+ 1 ppm IBA
   with 15 replicates. The treatment which had a significant effect was
   continued with the test Tukey. Variables observed were an increase in
   root length, plant vertical height, number of shoots, and percentage of
   rooted plants. The increase in root length and increase in plant
   vertical height showed the best results on the K10 mutant strain, the
   number of shoots showed the best results on the K9 and K11 mutant
   strains, and the highest percentage of rooted plants on the K3 and K11

Abstract = {An in vitro experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects on
   ruminal fermentation and crude protein (CP) degradation of a partial
   replacement of Vigna unguiculata (CIAT 391), a high quality, herbaceous
   legume, by tanniniferous shrub legumes of contrasting quality in
   combination with the tropical grass Brachiaria humidicola. All mixtures
   consisted of B. humidicola and legume foliage {[}1:1, on dry matter (DM)
   basis]. The legume part of the mixtures consisted either of V
   unguiculata alone or of mixtures (3:2) of this legume with Leucaena
   leucocephala, Flemingia macrophylla or Calliandra calothyrsus. Contents
   of total condensed tannins (g/kg DM) of L. leucocephala, F. macrophylla
   and C. calothyrsus were 51, 124 and 311, respectively. The experiment
   was conducted using a rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC) (n = 8). The
   partial replacement of V. unguiculata by any tanniniferous shrub
   decreased (P<0.05) ammonia concentration in the fermenter fluid and
   apparent fibre degradation. However, the decrease was more pronounced
   with C. calothyrsus and F. macrophylla than with L. leucocephala.
   Apparent degradation of organic matter and CP decreased (P<0.05) when V
   unguiculata was partially replaced by C. calothyrsus or F. macrophylla,
   but not (P>0.05) when L. leucocephata was included. These results
   indicate that V unguiculata may be partially replaced by L. leucocephala
   without seriously affecting the ruminal fermentation characteristics of
   the complete diet. In contrast, the same level of inclusion of F.
   macrophylla or C. calothyrsus, suppressed in vitro fermentation and
   nutrient degradation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala stem bark that was eleven years old was studied
   for its chemical composition and usage. The samples were subjected to
   chemical analyses based on ASTM standard procedures after being
   air-dried for several days. The results found that the bark of L.
   leucocephala has a pH value of 6.04 and that the solubility of the bark
   in 1\% NaOH alkali is the highest compared to the solubility in hot
   water (14.45\%) and cold water (14.36\%), while the chemical composition
   of the bark of L. leucocephala was ash (15.76\%); extractives (8.39\%);
   holocellulose (132.85\%); hemicellulose (103.66\%); cellulose (29.19\%)
   and lignin (38.24\%). Based on the findings, L. leucocephala bark was
   less acidic. When used as a source of carbohydrates, bark has a high
   solubility, and its chemical composition may have an impact on how
   quickly it burns when it is pyrolysed.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the nutritive value of different vegetative
   parts of Moringa oleifera (leaves, stems and plant debris) and Leucaena
   leucocephala (leaves and dried pods after seed harvesting). Nutrient
   composition, secondary metabolites and kinetics of gas production (GP)
   from in vitro rumen fermentation were measured to investigate the
   adequacy of these materials as feed resources for ruminants. Leaves of
   M. oleifera had the highest (p < .001) crude protein content (22.9\%),
   total polyphenols (336 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry matter {[}DM]),
   flavonoids (158 mg quercetin equivalent/g DM), condensed tannins (2.26
   mg catechin equivalents/g DM) and extraction yield (29.3\%). Debris of
   M. oleifera showed the highest (p < .001) antioxidant activity. The pods
   and leaves of L. leucocephala showed the highest organic matter (OM;
   94.5 and 92.7\%, respectively), neutral detergent fiber (63.1 and
   64.6\%, respectively), acid detergent fiber (48.5 and 45\%,
   respectively) and hemicellulose (14.6 and 19.6\%, respectively).
   However, the leaves and stems of M. oleifera showed the highest (p <
   .001) asymptotic GP (152 and 147 mL/g DM incubated) and fractional rate
   of fermentation (0.168 and 0.146 per h) compared to the leaves and pods
   of L. leucocephala. Additionally, the highest (p < .001) OM
   digestibility (59.8\%), metabolizable energy (8.32 MJ/kg DM), net energy
   (in terms of forage units for lactation or meat production) were
   observed with the leaves of M. oleifera. In conclusion, the
   concentration of nutrients differed between plants and within parts of
   the plant. Leaves of M. oleifera showed higher nutritive value than the
   stems and shed material. The pods of L. leucocephala showed higher
   nutritive value than its leaves.},

Abstract = {Forage production was measured for Leucaena leucocephala and L.
   pulverulenta at 2 sites over a 4-year period using a mechanized
   procedure for transplanting, cultivating, and harvesting. A silage
   harvester was modified to cut and chop 1-2 m long shoots and stems 50 cm
   above ground level. There were 3 harvests per year. Yields ranged from
   about 1.5 t/ha/yr to 9 t/ha/yr and t he crude protein ranged from 11.8\%
   to 23.9\%. The protein concentration was lower at higher yields. Yields
   of 3 t/ha were obtained in 90 days when temperatures were about
   30-degrees-C and when 175 mm of well distributed rainfall occurred.
   Protein contents were higher for L. leucocephala than L. pulverulenta
   from 1984 to 1987. There was better survival of the rootstocks of L.
   pulverulenta than L. leucocephala from - 7 and - 9-degrees-C freezes
   during the 1984-85 winter. This work demonstrates that leucaena can be
   planted, cultivated and harvested with commercially available equipment
   and that leucaena has sufficient cold tolerance to be useful in the
   subtropical United States as a source of high protein animal feed.},

Abstract = {One step green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from silver
   nitrate (AgNO3) using Leucaena leucocephala seeds extract as the
   reducing agent at room temperature was performed. The bioreduced NPs
   were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering
   (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectrophotometry,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. Qualitative information
   of major components in the seed extract was obtained through its
   phytochemical screening. The phytochemical data of L. leucocephala
   revealed the presence of terpenes, flavonoids, coumarins and sterols.
   The reaction was optimized for AgNO3, extract concentration and time
   duration for the reaction. The obtained NPs showed a characteristic UV
   peak of AgNPs at 420 nm. TEM and SEM images showed the spherical shaped
   NPs over which the extract coating was very prominent. The binding of L.
   leucocephala seeds extract onto NPs was tested using FTIR and TGA. The
   antifungal activity of the as-synthesized NPs against two fungal
   species, namely Phlebiopsis gigantea and Echinodontium taxodii, was
   studied. The antimicrobial effect of the as-synthesized NPs was
   ascertained against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The
   antioxidant potential of the AgNPs was tested with
   2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging. Also, the
   sensitivity of the NPs towards Fe3+ ions was tested in aqueous media.},

Abstract = {The intensity of seed predation the invasive tropical legume Leucaena
   leucocephala by the bruchid Acanthoscelides macropthalmus was
   investigated in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. The number of seeds
   damaged by A. macropthalmus as a proportion of total seeds available was
   found to increase the longer the pods remained on the tree. Seed
   predation ranged from a mean of 10.75\% of seeds on pods that remained
   on the plant for 1 month and increased to 53.54\% for pods that remained
   of the plant for 4 months. The low bruchid populations at high pod
   densities results in `predator satiation'. However, pods dehisce over
   time and the proportion of pods available over time to the bruchid
   correspondingly declines. By the time bruchid densities build up, most
   pods have dehisced and the seeds consequently escape predation. As a
   result the number of seeds lost to bruchid damage increases only
   marginally over time. Despite the levels of seed predation observed over
   the course of the study, the number of seeds in the soil seedbank almost
   doubled over time increasing from 8.5 seeds m(-3) to 15.5 seeds m(-3)
   over a 4-month period. Levels of seed predation and addition of seeds to
   the soil seedbank were not correlated. The taxonomic (subspecies) status
   and apparency of host plants as measured by plant and patch traits
   (average plant height, density of podding plants and patch size) did not
   influence levels of seed predation. Pre-dispersal seed predation studies
   need to take into account the pod/seed retention behaviour of the plant.
   The ability of the bruchid to regulate the invasiveness of Leucaena
   through influencing its demography is likely to be diminished if the
   insect populations cannot increase rapidly enough to use the seeds
   before pod dehiscence.},

Abstract = {Application of hedgerow prunings to the soil in alley cropping is

   Cumulative effects of 3.5 years of leucaena {[}Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) De Wit] hedgerow management on soil organic C and N and potential
   C and N mineralization were determined in an alley cropping experiment
   in Haiti. Treatments were combinations of pruning uses and pruning
   regimes in a 3 X 3 factorial with a no-tree control (rock walls) in a
   randomized complete block design with 3 replicates. A hedgerow +
   fertilizer treatment in an adjacent trial was included for comparison.
   Soil samples collected at 0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm depths were sealed in
   mason jars and incubated at 25degreesC for 30 days. Organic C and N and
   inorganic N were measured before the incubation. Inorganic N and

   and N dynamics were similar between pruning application methods. The
   two-cut regime with a longer regrowth period after cutting (0-40 DAP)
   had highest organic C in the 0-20 cm soil layer whereas two-cut with a
   shorter regrowth period (0-30 DAP) had highest C turnover. Within soil
   layers, pruning application had higher organic C and N and potential C

   prunings removed in the 0-5 cm layer whereas the latter treatments had
   similar C and N dynamics at all depths. Addition of N-P-K fertilizer in
   presence of fresh prunings did not increase soil organic C and N but
   enhanced N dynamics in the surface soil.},

   mechanism of the catalytic deoxygenation, in terms of reforming,
   water-gas shift and dehydration reactions, was proposed. To consider the

Abstract = {Sixty crossbred Anglo-Nubian goats (growing females), 18-24 mo of age,
   with a mean pre-experimental live weight of 20.9+/-0.44 kg were used to
   investigate voluntary dry matter intake (DMI) and digestibility of
   supplements of Leucaena leucocephala (LL) leaves to a basal diet of
   guinea grass, The experiment was a 3 forms of presentation: fresh,
   wilted and dryx4 levels of supplementation: 10, 20, 30 and 40\% of total
   forage allowance with LL leaves. The goats were assigned based on weight
   and age to one of the twelve diets in a randomized manner and each level
   had five animals (replicates) per diet for 56 days. The form of
   presentation of LL leaves had effects on dry matter (DM) and nutrient
   composition. DM and NDF were higher in the dry LL leaves (p<0.05), In
   the diets, CP increased as the level of supplementation with LL leaves
   increased (p<0.05). Mean CP was similar in the fresh (14.8+/-3.5\%),
   wilted (14.3+/-3.3\%) and dry forms (13.9+/-3.1\%). Neutral detergent
   fibre (NDF) decreased linearly (p<0.05) with increase in levels of
   supplementation. Organic matter (OM) followed the trend of CP
   concentration (p<0.05). Drying was observed to reduce the availability
   of CP at the different levels of supplementation and subsequently this
   affected the NDF of the diets. DM intake of the goats on the fresh and
   wilted LL leaves was significantly higher (p<0.05) than in those on the
   dry LL leaves. DM intake of the basal diet was observed to decrease as
   the level of supplementation (p<0.05) increased regardless of the form
   of presentation of LL. Growth rate was best (p<0.05) on the fresh form
   followed by wilted and the least in the dry form. Growth rate decreased
   linearly (p<0.05) with increase in the level of supplementation in the
   dry form. The form of presentation and level of supplementation
   influenced DM, CP and OM digestibility (p<0.05). Except for NDF, the
   digestibility of DM, CP and OM were better (p<0.05) in the goats on
   fresh LL leaves compared to the wilted and dry leaves. Based on the data
   on DMI, growth rate and apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients,
   the results suggest that LL leaves is best utilized when fed fresh or
   wilted to goats. In the dry form of presentation, the best level of
   supplementation without a reduction in voluntary DMI and growth rate is
   the 20\%. In the fresh and wilted form, LL leaves could be fed up to the
   40\% level with improved DMI, growth rate and nutrient utilization.},

Volume = {57},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background and aims: Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) has been
   considered one of the 100 most invasive species on a global scale.
   Despite its potential threat, its introduction is increasingly being
   promoted for agroforestry, ornamentation, shading and handicrafts in the
   warm and temperate forest regions of Argentina. The threat of Leucaena
   populations to biodiversity has been reported worldwide, where control
   was not effective. The aims of the present study were to update the
   record of naturalized populations in Argentina and provide information
   on the historical and current processes of naturalization and invasion.
   M\&M: The records were documented by collecting plant material in the
   field and examination of material housed in herbaria. Field observations
   were also made to observe current naturalization processes and
   interaction with dispersers/predators. Results: The invasive condition
   was confirmed in Argentina and two introduction pathways were
   recognized. Based on the general appearance of the groves and the
   microhabitat that is generated in the invaded environments, it is
   considered a transformer species in Argentina. The reproductive
   characteristics and their interaction with other strata of regional
   biodiversity related to the invasive process are indicated.
   Conclusions: The analysis of the herbarium labels allowed detecting that
   in 1921 this species was already naturalized in the country. The
   intervention of humans in its dispersal is discussed and future
   scenarios are proposed.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Sorghum is one of the major staple crops in Sub Saharan
   Africa but its production is mainly limited by moisture stress, frequent
   droughts and soil infertility, especially in the smallholder farming
   systems. This raises the need to develop climate smart options to
   improve sorghum production. The objective was to assess the effects of
   rainwater harvesting and use of different Leucaena leucocephala biomass
   rates on soil moisture content, rainwater use efficiency, and stover and
   grain yields in two sorghum varieties (Macia and SV1). The experiment
   was laid as a randomized complete block design in split-split plot
   arrangement from 2017/2018 to 2019/2020 season. RESULTS The results show
   that tied contour (TC) and infiltration pits (IPs) significantly (P <
   0.05) increased soil moisture content than standard contour (SC). Soil
   moisture content increased gradually with the increase in soil depth
   (20-40 cm > 0-20 cm), with 2018/2019 season having the maximum soil
   moisture content. Soil moisture content also increased with the increase
   in application rates of Leucaena biomass. Grain and stover yields were
   significantly (P < 0.05) increased by all Leucaena biomass application
   rates with higher yield observed in 2018/2019 season. SC had
   significantly lower grain and stover yields at all Leucaena biomass
   application rates. TC and IPs had comparable rainwater use efficiency
   compared to SC. Rainwater use efficiency increased with application
   rates of Leucaena biomass across all seasons and varieties. CONCLUSION
   TC and IPs are better adaptive mechanisms against drought spells in
   semi-arid areas and can be combined with 10 t ha(-1) of Leucaena biomass
   due to better yield increments realized. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical

Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {231},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {The use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is considered an important
   strategy to bioremediate contaminated soil by heavy metals. However, the
   mechanisms used by AMF to attenuate plant toxicity, caused by the higher
   manganese (Mn) concentrations in the soil, remain poorly understood. We
   analyzed the influence of Mn on Leucaena leucocephala development and
   tolerance inoculated with different AMF species (Claroideoglomus
   etunicatum, Acaulospora scrobiculata and native AMF). In a greenhouse
   experiment, we exposed the plant to increasing levels of Mn (0, 100,
   200, and 400 mg kg(-1)) in the soil, during 60 days. Higher Mn levels
   reduced shoot and root dry mass, AMF spore abundance in soil, and
   mycorrhizal colonization. However, the inoculated plants were lower
   affected by the Mn increases in the soil, evidencing phytoprotective
   effect promoted by the AMF. In addition to higher Mn contents in the
   roots and lower Mn contents in the shoots, inoculated plants with native
   AMF and C. etunicatum showed increase in P content in the shoots of
   34.4\% and 21.8\% and decrease in leaf toxicity of 65.15\% and 34.74\%,
   respectively, as compared with the control treatment. The scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)
   analysis allowed us in detecting Mn on the surface of the spores, which
   varied with AMF species, acting as a biological barrier to reduce
   phytotoxicity and increase plant tolerance to Mn. Together, our results
   suggest that AMF colonization in Leucaena leucocephala attenuates Mn
   toxicity symptoms and maximizes its development, increasing its
   tolerance to high concentrations of this element in the soil.},

Abstract = {A combination of recalcitrant and orthodox `desiccation-sensitive but
   liquid nitrogen-tolerant' phenomena was exhibited in Leucaena
   leucocephala seeds. The average seed moisture content was 18.5\% and
   germination was 26.1\% for the three seed lots tested. The seed was 7.45
   mm long, 4.60 mm wide and 1.87 mm thick with weight of 4.59 g on
   average. In this experiment, seeds were subjected to three dehydration
   treatments and non-dehydrated seeds were used as controls prior to
   storing in liquid nitrogen for 30 min. It was observed that seeds
   dehydrated for 24 h using silica gel resulted in 13.2\% moisture content
   with 27\% germination as compared to dehydration treatments in laminar
   air-flow and in 2.0 M sucrose which gave 9.8 and 10.4\% moisture
   contents and germination of 13.9 and 14.8\% respectively. However, the
   control non-dehydrated seeds with 18.5\% moisture content gave 30.8\%
   germination. Studies also indicated that when using slow freezing
   technique before direct plunging into liquid nitrogen, the dehydrated
   seeds, which were kept for 14 weeks, were able to give better viability
   and resulted in 29\% germination as compared to 18\% germination for
   untreated seeds. Regression analysis projected that seeds of L..
   leucocephala can either be stored for 36 weeks at room temperature (28 -
   32 degrees C) or cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for up to 9 years
   following rapid freezing and for 12 y after controlled slow freezing

Abstract = {The impacts of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) feeding systems on

   established in the tropical regions of Mexico, where most of the
   information for the current review was obtained. Incorporating leucaena
   in a grass pasture increases dry matter intake of grazing cattle and
   reduces the level of methane produced. This results in improved
   liveweight gains and milk yields as well as a reduction in the level of
   greenhouse gas released. Additional benefits are increases in soil
   carbon and nitrogen levels and less stress on animals as the leucaena
   plants provide shade and reduce environmental temperatures. While these
   benefits are substantial, the area developed to leucaena represents less
   than 0.1\% of the area which could potentially be developed. Strategies
   to increase adoption of these grass-legume systems by farmers need to be
   developed to make effective use of the systems for increasing beef and
   milk production while reducing the undesirable environmental outcomes
   normally associated with ruminant production.},

Abstract = {The above and below-ground biomass (AGB and BGB) relationship is often
   used to assess the impact of biotic and abiotic effects on the growth
   and development of individual plants. The AGB and BGB relationship of
   the same tree species in different habitats can change significantly
   because of environmental stress. To investigate how the tree size, the
   biomass allocation and BGB/AGB ratio of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit varied according to spacing and mixed plant patterns in a
   valley-type savanna of southwest China, we examined the growth of L.
   leucocephala, and sampled 23 individuals for biomass measurement in each
   of four treatments (close/wide spacing of Leucaena leucocephala
   monocultures, mixed plantation of Leucaena leucocephala and Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis, and mixed plantation of Leucaena leucocephala and
   Eucalyptus citriodora), and then determined the regression relationships
   between AGB and BGB of L. leucocephala in different plant stands. Our
   results indicated that mixed planting significantly reduced all growth
   metrics for the tree sizes of L. leucocephala and increased the value of
   BGB/AGB. Changing plant spacing in monocultures had a significant impact
   on AGB and TB (Total Biomass) of L. leucocephala, but it had no
   significant effect on the other metrics. Within mixed plant schemes, L.
   leucocephala significantly reduced the biomass allocation to leaves and
   small roots and increased the allocation to coarse root biomass. There
   were no significant differences in tree size and biomass allocation of
   L. leucocephala between different spacing regimes in monocultures or
   between different mixtures in mixed plant stands. The correlation
   between BGB and AGB of L. leucocephala in all plant stands was
   consistent with the model of allometric growth, and AGB can be used to
   accurately estimate BGB. Interestingly, the correlations were not
   exactly the same. BGB and AGB in monoculture showed isometric growth,
   and their values in mixed plant stands showed allometric growth. BGB
   also increased faster than AGB. The findings indicated that L.
   leucocephala allocated more biomass to the root system when it was
   planted with Eucalyptus.},

   with properties of its oriented strand board. Besides age, the effects
   of tree portions, namely, top, middle and bottom were also studied.
   Leucaena leucocephala wood was analysed for holocellulose, lignin, ash
   and ethanol-toluene, cold water, hot water and 1\% natrium hydroxide
   solubles. Oriented strand boards which were produced from the samples
   were evaluated for their mechanical and physical properties based on two
   resin levels (7 and 9\%), two target board densities (700 and 800 kg
   m's) and two strand sizes, namely, S1 (12.7-19.0 mm) and S2 (6.3-12.7
   mm). This study revealed that tree portion significantly affected cold
   and hot water solubles, the solubilities of alkali and alcohol toluene,
   and also the ash and holocellulose contents of L. leucocephala. Only the
   solubility of alcohol toluene and lignin and holocellulose contents were
   affected by age. Although the correlation of some chemical components
   was significant, the correlation coefficients were relatively small,
   thus, indicating the loose association between the factors and board
   properties. It could be deduced that board properties had less
   association with chemical components but were more dependent on the
   resin content, board density and strand size used in the study.
   Generally, 8-year-old wood was found to be a suitable raw material for
   the manufacture of oriented strand board.},

Abstract = {Four Thai - rumen fistulated male swamp buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis),
   about 3 years old with 360 +/- 18 kg liveweight, were randomly assigned
   according to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in a 4 x 4 Latin square
   design to receive four dietary treatments. The treatments were as
   follows: a cassava based supplement (CS) at 1 g/kg BW and Leucaena
   leucocephala leaf meal (LLM) at 300 g/d (T1): CS at 2 g/kg BW with LLM
   at 300 g/d (T2); CS at 1 g/kg BW and heat treated LLM (HLLM) at 300 g/d
   (T3); and CS at 2 g/kg BW and HLLM at 300 g/d. During the experiment,
   urea-calcium hydroxide treated rice straw was given on ad libitum basis.
   The results revealed an increase in roughage and total dry matter (DM)
   intake (P<0.05) by CS at 2 g/kg BW (T2 and T4) as compared with CS at 1
   g/kg BW (T1 and T3). Digestion coefficients of DM, organic matter (OM),
   and crude protein (CP) were increased by CS at 2 g/kg BW. while neutral
   detergent fiber (aNDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were similar among
   treatments. However, there was no effect of neither energy level nor
   HLLM on ruminal pH and temperature (P>0.05). Concentration of ruminal
   ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) was decreased by HLLM as compared with LLM
   (P<0.05), while blood urea-nitrogen was not altered. There was an
   increase (P<0.05) in total volatile fatty acid (TVFA). acetic acid (C2),
   propionic acid (C3), and butyric acid (C4) concentrations and the
   highest were found in CS at 2 g/kg BW with HLLM (T4), while the lowest
   was. in T1 and T3. However, no changes in C2-C3 ratio were found in this
   study. Total bacterial direct counts were found different (P<0.05),
   whereas fungal zoospores and protozoal populations were similar among
   treatments. Nevertheless, viable bacterial counts were found affected by
   both concentrate level and HLLM. The treatments with HLLM were lower
   than those in LLM and CS at 2 g/kg BW were higher than those
   supplemented at CS at 1 g/kg BW (P<0.05). In addition, efficiency of
   rumen microbial CP synthesis tended to be higher in treatment with
   higher level of energy and HLLM. Based on this study, it could be
   concluded that LLM could be used as a protein source, while the
   combination of HLLM and CS at 2 g/kg BW could enhance the voluntary feed
   intake, nutrient digestibility and rumen fermentation in swamp buffalo
   fed on treated rice straw (urea-calcium hydroxide treatment). (C) 2012

   3 and 2 animals/ha, respectively and a control with 30\% of the area
   with leucaena and 2 animals/ha. All animals had free access to the
   leucaena and the unassociated grass. No nitrogenous fertilizer was
   applied. A complete randomized design was used. Animals of each
   treatment rotated in 3 paddocks with 10 days of occupation and 20 days
   of rest. On finishing the fattening period, 50\% of the animals from
   each treatment were slaughtered for the histopathological and hepatic
   studies. Daily gain was of 431, 556 and 503 g/animal/day for treatments
   with 50\% leucaena with 3 and 2 animals/ha and 30\% leucaena with 2
   animals/ha, respectively and the final weight, in the same order, was of

Title = {Palatability and effect on dairy cow milk yield of dried fodder from the
   forage trees Acacia boliviana, Calliandra calothyrsus and
   Leucaena leucocephala},
Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {1999},

Abstract = {Four groups of three Holstein-Friesian cows were supplemented with 1.5
   kg of air-dried tree fodder of Acacia boliviana, Calliandra calothyrsus
   or Leucaena leucocephala, or 1.5 kg Rhodes grass hay as a control, mixed
   with 1.5 kg of a commercial polyethylene glycol (PEG)-containing
   digestive modifier (Browse Plus). Cows on all treatments were fed a
   basal diet of maize silage, cottonseed cake and crushed maize grain, and
   had ad lib access to Rhodes grass hay from noon, A 2-week adaptation
   period was followed by a 2-week response period, Refusals of C.
   calothyrsus and grass hay were initially 12\% and 32\%, respectively,
   but their intake improved with time, and at the start of the response
   period practically all of the 1.5 kg was consumed for all the fodders,
   The highest milk yield of 13.19 kg day(-1) was produced by cows
   receiving L. leucocephala (p < 0.001), Cows receiving A. boliviana
   produced 11.94 kg day(-1), 0.58 kg day(-1) more than with the grass hay
   control diet, but C. calothyrsus had no beneficial effect. Although L.
   leucocephala was judged not to be superior to the other tree fodders
   nutritionally with respect to protein and fibre content, its in vitro
   organic matter degradability (OMD) was higher, as was its 96 h gas
   production volume (p < 0.001). Despite being fed with PEG, it was
   concluded that anti-nutritional factors were operative with A.
   I,boliviana and C. calothyrsus. Amongst the tree forages, L,
   leucocephala had the lowest, and C, calothyrsus the highest, content of
   soluble polyphenolics and fibre-bound proanthocyanidins (PAs) (p <
   0.001), though the former was still substantial in L. leucocephala, with
   the reverse occurring for OMD (p < 0.001). Soluble PA content and
   protein precipitating capacity were highest in A. boliviana (p < 0.001).
   There were strong negative relationships for both OMD and milk yield
   with tree fodder soluble phenolic and fibre-bound PA contents (r-values:
   OMD -0.88{*}{*} and -0.96{*}{*}{*}, milk yield -0.96{*}{*}{*} and
   -0.99{*}{*}{*}, respectively). The potential for use of C. calothyrsus
   conserved as hay is very limited, for A. boliviana only moderate, while
   for L. leucocephala it is apparently good. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {In higher plants, multiple copies of the cysteine synthase gene are
   present for cysteine biosynthesis. Some of these genes also have the
   potential to produce various kinds of beta-substitute alanine. In the
   present study, we cloned a 1275-bp cDNA for cytosolic
   O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (cysteine synthase) (Cy-OASTL) from Leucaena
   leucocephala. The purified protein product showed a dual function of
   cysteine and mimosine synthesis. Kinetics studies showed pH optima of
   7.5 and 8.0, while temperature optima of 40 and 35 degrees C,
   respectively, for cysteine and mimosine synthesis. The kinetic
   parameters such as apparent K-m, k(cat) were determined for both
   cysteine and mimosine synthesis with substrates O-acetylserine (OAS) and
   Na2S or 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (3H4P). From the in vitro results with the
   common substrate OAS, the apparent k(cat) for Cys production is over
   sixfold higher than mimosine synthesis and the apparent K-m is 3.7 times
   lower, suggesting Cys synthesis is the favored pathway.},

   NaCl concentration was 50 mM or less. Sodium uptake decreased as  CaSO4
   concentration incrased. Calcium uptake was affected by NaCl
   concentration when substrate CaSO4 concentration was 0.5 mM. At this
   level, 100 mM NaCl caused a marked decrease in leaf calcium and a marked
   increase in leaf Cl. In all other treatments, Cl uptake was not affected
   by CaSO4 concentration. Potassium uptake was strongly depressed as NaCl
   concentration increased at low Ca concentration, but this effect was
   offset at high Ca. Magnesium uptake decreased as CaCO4 levels increased.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala has played a key role in the development of
   sustainable cattle ranching in Latin America. This species is the
   backbone of the so-called Intensive Silvopastoral Systems (ISPS) that
   combine high-density cultivation of leucaena as fodder shrubs
   (4,000-40,000 plants/ha) with grasses and trees. The layers of
   vegetation added by shrubs and trees increase the system's capacity for
   transforming solar energy into biomass and enhance habitat complexity.
   Although part of the biomass is transformed into livestock products, a
   significant amount is deposited as litter on the soil and, along with
   the nitrogen fixed by leucaena and other trees, has positive effects on
   soil properties and grass production. The increased complexity of the
   system has measurable effects on biodiversity. ISPS with leucaena
   support more species of birds, ants, dung beetles and woody plants than
   conventional pasture monocultures, contribute to landscape-scale
   connectivity and provide environmental services. They also enhance
   animal welfare through reduced heat stress and improved availability and
   quality of fodder resources. ISPS contribute to climate change
   mitigation by improving above- and below-ground carbon sequestration and
   by cutting down greenhouse gas emissions per units of dry matter
   consumed and cattle product. Although these systems have been
   successfully implemented in Colombia, Mexico and other countries, their
   adoption is still limited in relation to the area suitable for their
   introduction.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a multipurpose tropical tree-legume
   that is highly resistant to many biotic and abiotic stresses. Leucaena
   is used primarily as an animal fodder owing to its protein-rich foliage.
   However, leucaena foliage also contains mimosine, a toxic non-protein
   amino acid that can cause alopecia, goiter and other thyroid problems,
   infertility and fetal death. Considering its toxicity and abundance in
   leucaena, it is important to quantify the mimosine concentrations in
   leucaena under different environmental conditions. Mimosine was
   extracted from various types of leucaena tissue exposed to a range of
   environmental conditions and then quantified by HPLC. The mimosine
   concentrations in leucaena treated with NaCl increased after 6 days of
   treatment and remained relatively high when treatment continued for 18
   days. Interestingly, leucaena exposed to complete darkness for up to 5
   days had a higher mimosine concentration than control plants exposed to
   normal light/dark photoperiods. On the other hand, drying leucaena
   leaflets or macerating them in an alkaline buffer significantly lowered
   their mimosine concentration. Mature leaflets that had fallen off the
   plant and dried out also contained significantly less mimosine than
   fresh leaflets. The results of this study indicate that mimosine
   concentrations in leucaena are affected by environmental conditions and
   this knowledge can assist in managing to prevent toxicity.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of protein
   extracts obtained from the plant Leucaena leucocephala on the nematode
   parasite Haemonchus contortus. The seeds, shell and cotyledon of L.
   leucocephala were separated and their proteins extracted using a sodium
   phosphate buffer, and named as TE (total seed extract), SE (shell
   extract) and CE (cotyledon extract). Soluble protein content, protease,
   protease inhibitory and chitinase activity assays were performed.
   Exsheathment inhibition of H. contortus larvae were performed at
   concentrations of 0.6 mg mL(-1), and egg hatch assays were conducted at
   protein concentrations of 0.8, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 mg mL(-1). The
   effective concentration for 50\% hatching inhibition (EC50) was
   estimated by probit. Different proportions of soluble proteins, protease
   and chitinase were found in TE and CE. Protease inhibitory activity was
   detected in all extracts. The EC50 of the CE and TE extracts were 0.48
   and 0.33 mg mL(-1), respectively. No ovicidal effects on H. contortus
   were detected in SE extracts, and none of the protein extracts
   demonstrated larvicidal effects on H. contortus. We therefore conclude
   that protein extracts of L. leucocephala had a detrimental effect on
   nematode eggs, which can be correlated with the high protease and
   chitinase activity of these extracts.},

Abstract = {The invasion of exotic species of natural spaces constitutes a global
   conservation problem. In the Siboney- Jutic \& iacute; Ecological
   Reserve, Leucaena leucocephala is considered one of the main threats to
   the conservation of the semideciduous microphyll forest. The objective
   of this study is to characterize the richness and structure of the
   semideciduous microphyll forest in areas with different levels of
   Leucaena leucocephala coverage in that reserve. For the study, 15 plots
   of 400 m 2 were established at three levels of coverage of the invasive
   species: ABSMNI (undisturbed forests), ABSM-PI (40-60 \% coverage of
   Leucaena leucocephala) and ABSMTI (70 \% cover of Leucaena
   leucocephala). The number of individuals per species and their presence
   in each of the stratus were estimated, in addition, the height of the
   woody species was considered. For each of the levels studied, the
   specific richness, the relative abundance of the species and the
   floristic composition by stratus were determined; as well as the
   floristic similarities between each of the levels. In ABSM-NI, 55
   species were recorded, in ABSM-PI 51 and in ABSM-TI 43. At the three
   levels of cover, the strata (tree, shrub, herbaceous) and lianas were
   maintained. In ABSM-TI the epiphytes were not recorded. The greatest
   biological similarity was between ABSM-PI and ABSM-TI; some of the
   shared species are ruderal and colonize areas with some type of
   disturbance. The main transformation was in the composition and
   abundance of the species as the coverage of the invasive species
   increased. In ABSM-TI, the specific richness and abundance/cover of
   secondary vegetation species increased, to the detriment of other
   typical forest species. In the sites with the greatest coverage of the
   invasive species, a decrease in the specific composition and height of
   the tree stratus occurs. At this site, an increase in the specific
   composition of the shrub and herbaceous strata was also observed.
   Epiphytes were only recorded in ABSM-NI and ABSM-PI.},

Title = {Supplementation of Water Spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) on the utilization

Journal = {VETERINARY WORLD},

Volume = {16},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background and Aim: Ipomoea aquatica (Water Spinach) is the most
   potential for livestock growth performance, including chickens, pigs,
   cattle, and goats, especially in a tropical country like Cambodia. It is
   not only an alternative feed source but also one kind of supplemented
   feed for goat raising. Supplementation with Water Spinach in the
   utilization of low-quality tree foliage results in an increase in dry
   matter intake in goat production. This study aimed to identify the
   effectiveness of supplementation of Water Spinach in the utilization of
   Mimosa pigra and Leucaena leucocephala leaf in in vitro
   fermentation.Materials and Methods: The study was designed according to
   a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement in randomized design of seven treatments
   with different ratios consisted of different three types of dietary
   treatments, including M. pigra, L. leucocephala, and Water Spinach. The
   treatments were arranged according to a completely randomized design and
   were as follow: T1 = M. pigra leaf (100\%); T2 = L. leucocephala leaf
   (100\%); T3 = M. pigra leaf and L. leucocephala leaf (50\% and 50\%); T4
   = M. pigra leaf and Water Spinach (99.5\% and 0.5\%); T5 = L.
   leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach (99.5\% and 0.5\%); T6 = M. pigra
   leaf and Water Spinach (99\% and 1\%); and T7 = L. leucocephala leaf and
   Water Spinach (99\% and 1\%). A total of 200 mg (dry matter) of dietary
   treatments were prepared in a 60 mL syringe. Each treatment was
   replicated 3 time. Gas recording of each treatment lasted for 3 days. In
   vitro was performed for 72 h, was followed by Makkar method. Gas
   production was recorded at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h of
   incubation by using strict anaerobic technique. A mixture of rumen fluid
   and dietary treatments were carried out under continuous flushing with
   CO2 in sharking incubator at 39 degrees C. After incubating for 72 h,
   the ammonia concentration (NH3-N) was measured and recorded to identify
   pH, nutrient digestibility, and ammonia concentration (NH3-N).Results:
   Nutrient digestibility of the treatment with Water Spinach supplement in
   the utilization of L. leucocephala was obtained at a higher
   digestibility than treatment with M. pigra (p < 0.05). Gas production
   was different between groups (p < 0.05). Treatment with only M. pigra
   leaf had the highest gas production (A), while treatment with Water
   Spinach supplementation had the lowest gas production (A). At 0-24 h,
   the treatment with L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach 0.5\% had the
   highest gas production, but after 24 h, M. pigra leaf and Water Spinach
   1\% and L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach 0.5\% produced more gas
   compared to the other treatments (p < 0.05).Conclusion: The
   supplementation of Water Spinach 1\% in treatment with M. pigra and L.
   leucocephala leaf resulted in increased degradability, gas production,
   and NH3-N concentration without a change in the pH value rumen
   condition. Based on these results, it is recommended that the level of
   Water Spinach supplementation should be 1\% of dietary intake. Future
   studies should consider investigating the rumen ecology associated with
   Water Spinach supplementation. Feeding with Water Spinach remains a good
   supplement for ruminant performance; therefore, further studies should
   be conducted using Water Spinach in ruminant feeding in both metabolic
   and feeding trials.},

Abstract = {A field study was conducted for 4 years (1994-95 to 1997-98) to find out
   the effect of substitution of fertilizer nitrogen in bread wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori \& Paol.) through white leadtree or
   subabul {[}Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.] leaf biomass on growth,
   yield of wheat and residual effect on yield of subsequent crop of pearl
   millet {[}Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. emend. Stuntz], residual soil
   fertility and economic returns. Five treatments comprising 100 kg N/ha
   either applied all through urea fertilizer or Leucaena green biomass or
   combination of urea fertilizer and green biomass in ratio of 75:25 and
   50:50 and the control, were tried. Green Leucaena leaves containing 3\%
   N on dry weight basis, were incorporated into the soil 15 days before
   sowing of wheat crop. Wheat yield was at par in 100 kg N applied through
   urea fertilizer without Leucaena hedge rows (3 137 kg/ha) and 100 kg N
   through urea fertilizer with Leucaena hedge rows (3 047 kg/ha)
   indicating that well managed, pruned at the height of 75 cm above the
   ground, Leucaena trees in alley cropping did not show any suppressing
   effect on growth, grain and straw yields of wheat and pearl millet.
   Among substitution of fertilizer nitrogen treatments, 25\% substitution
   of N resulted in significantly higher grain yield (3 418 kg/ha) than
   50\% (2 937 kg/ha) and 100\% (2 529 kg/ha) substitution. The plant
   height and yield-contributory characters were also higher in 25\%
   substitution treatment compared to 50 and 100\% substitution. Residual
   effect of incorporation of Leucaena biomass to wheat crop was observed
   on pearl millet yield. Substitution of 100\% N through Leucaena leaves
   resulted in higher grain yield (2 055 kg/ha) than 25\% substitution (1
   987 kg/ha). Organic carbon (0.29\%), available N (164.6), P (23.4), K
   (17.2) kg/ha were increased with the application of 100\% substitution
   of fertilizer N through Leucaena biomass after 4 years. The highest net
   returns (Rs 16 172/ha) and benefit : cost ratio (1.98) were obtained
   with 25\% substitution of fertilizer nitrogen.},

   conformed to the pseudo-second order model while Langmuir isotherm model
   recorded the value of maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) of 222 mg/g.
   The major functional groups involved in the adsorption process were
   identified as hydroxyl, amino and ether as revealed by the FTIR
   analysis. The prepared adsorbent demonstrated a potential application
   for efficient removal of Pb(II) ions from industrial wastewater.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Petai Belalang) is a worldwide
   success as a long-lived and highly nutritious forage tree. The benefits
   of L. Leucaena was mainly used as food for both human and animal. This
   plant also was proposed for being applied in medical and cosmetic.
   However, there are still no commercial used, and no serious intention in
   discovering the scientific proof for the present of bioactive compound
   inside L. Leucocephala. Therefore, this work come out with the scope to
   analyze the antioxidants contains in seeds of L. Leucocephala.
   Phytochemical screening assay involved in this study is free radical
   diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, folin-ciocalteu method,
   colorimetric assay and a molybdenum blue method. Through all testing,
   the antioxidant activity, total phenolic content, total flavonoid
   content and total phosphorus content were been determined. Antioxidant
   activities are higher under extraction using methanol (dried sample)
   which is 593.09 mg/L, total phenolic content are higher under extraction
   using deionized water (dried sample) which is 5587.50 mg/L, total
   flavonoid content are higher under extraction using methanol (dried
   sample) which is 445.05 mg/L, and phosphorus analysis are higher under
   extraction using methanol (dried sample) which is 73.817 mg/L.},

Abstract = {Nine isonitrogenous (35\% crude protein approximately) and isocaloric
   (18.37 kJ g(-1)) experimental diets (RLL20-BCFL40) were formulated with
   either raw or treated (inoculated with fish intestinal bacteria)
   Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal at 20\%, 30\% and 40\% levels replacing
   other ingredients partially from a fish meal based reference diet (RD).
   Two specific strains of fish intestinal bacteria, Bacillus subtilis
   (isolated from Cyprinus carpio) and B. circulans (isolated from
   Oreochromis mossambicus) having extracellular cellulolytic and
   amylolytic activities, were used to inoculate Leucaena leaf meal for 15
   days at 37degreesC. The crude fibre, cellulose and hemicellulose
   contents and the antinutritional factors, tannin, phytic acid and
   mimosine in the leaf meal decreased due to inoculation. However, free
   amino acids and fatty acids increased in the treated leaf meal. The
   response of rohu, Labeo rohita, fingerlings fed the experimental diets
   for 80 days was compared with fish fed a RD. Both the inclusion level
   and type of Leucaena leaf meal in diets significantly affected the
   growth performance of rohu. Fish fed diets containing inoculated
   Leucaena leaf meal performed better in comparison with those with the
   RD. On the basis of growth response, feed conversion ratio, protein
   efficiency ratio and apparent net protein utilization, diet formulated
   with 30\%Leucaena leaf meal inoculated with B. circulans resulted in the
   best performance of rohu fingerlings followed by diet with 40\%B.

   digestibility (APD) was better in fish fed diets containing B. circulans
   inoculated leaf meal. An increasing level of raw Leucaena leaf meal was
   associated with a decrease in the carcass protein content of rohu
   fingerlings. The activity of alpha-amylase increased with the increasing
   level of treated leaf meal in diets. Cellulase activity increased with
   increasing level of inclusion of raw leaf meal, and was comparatively
   lower in fish fed diets with treated leaf meal. Activities of protease
   and lipase were higher in fish fed the RD. The results showed that it is
   possible to incorporate Leucaena leaf meal inoculated with
   enzyme-producing fish intestinal bacteria in carp diets up to 40\% level
   of inclusion.},

Abstract = {Callus was induced from various explants of Leucaena leucocephala, a

   from hypocotyl segments showed high morphogenetic potential.
   Caulogenesis was achieved on B-5 medium supplemented with 6-benzylamino
   purine. Presence of ac-naphthaleneacetic acid in the medium promoted
   6-benzylamino purine induced caulogenesis. Callus obtained from
   hypocotyl segments retained the capacity to produce shoots upon
   subculturing even after four months from induction. The shoots obtained
   from callus were transferred to auxin containing media for rooting. Good
   root induction was achieved in the presence of 10(-6)M 3-indolebutyric
   acid. Various morphologically distinct somaclonal variants were exposed
   to high concentrations of carbon dioxide. Somaclonal variants capable of
   growing well in the presence of high levels of carbon dioxide were
   selected. The majority of such variants were found to have high carbon
   dioxide assimilating capacity (as indicated by infra red gas analysis).
   Simultaneously methods were standardised for rapid multiplication of
   Leucaena leucocephala through apical bud and nodal cultures.
   Best apical bud and axillary bud sprouting was achieved on B-5 medium
   supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine. Subsequent to multiplication, the
   efficient carbon dioxide assimilating variants can be used for
   afforestation and reforestation purposes in barren lands. This is likely
   to be one of the best methods, that can be employed safely, for
   alleviating the problem of global warming.},

   value, which help to maximize animal production. The objective was to
   evaluate the productive behavior of the guaje (Leucaena leucocephala) at

   study was conducted in the rainy season (June to October 2017) at the
   Faculty of Veterinary Medicine No. 2 of the Autonomous University of
   Guerrero in Cuajinicuilapa, Guerrero, Mexico. The guaje (Leucaena
   leucocephala) was transplanted at a distance of 10 cm between plants and
   between rows of 1.5, 2 and 3 m, to obtain densities of 67, 50 and 33
   thousand plants ha(-1), respectively. 30 days before the beginning of

Abstract = {Cysteine biosynthesis is directed by the successive commitments of
   serine acetyltransferase, and O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OASTL)
   compounds, which subsequently frame the decameric cysteine synthase
   complex. The isoforms of OASTL are found in three compartments of the
   cell: the cytosol, plastid, and mitochondria. In this investigation, we
   first isolated putative chloroplastic OASTL (Ch-OASTL) from Leucaena
   leucocephala, and the Ch-OASTL was then expressed in BL21-competent
   Escherichia coli. The putative Ch-OASTL cDNA clone had 1,543 base pairs
   with 391 amino acids in its open reading frame and a molecular weight of
   41.54 kDa. The purified protein product exhibited cysteine synthesis
   ability, but not mimosine synthesis activity. However, they both make
   the common alpha-aminoacrylate intermediate in their first half reaction
   scheme with the conventional substrate O-acetyl serine (OAS). Hence, we
   considered putative Ch-OASTL a cysteine-specific enzyme. Kinetic studies
   demonstrated that the optimum pH for cysteine synthesis was 7.0, and the
   optimum temperature was 40 degrees C. In the cysteine synthesis assay,
   the K-m and k(cat) values were 838 +/- 26 mu M and 72.83 s(-1) for OAS,
   respectively, and 60 +/- 2 mu M and 2.43 s(-1) for Na2S, respectively.
   We can infer that putative Ch-OASTL regulatory role is considered a
   sensor for sulfur constraint conditions, and it acts as a forerunner of
   various metabolic compound molecules.},

Abstract = {Conformational transitions of cinnamoyl CoA reductase, a key regulatory

   were studied using fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The
   native protein possesses four trp residues exposed on the surface and
   66\% of helical structure, undergoes rapid structural transitions at and
   above 45 C and starts forming aggregates at 55 C. LI-CCRH1 was
   transformed into acid induced (pH 2.0) molten globule like structure,
   exhibiting altered secondary structure, diminished tertiary structure
   and exposed hydrophobic residues. The molten globule like structure was
   examined for the thermal and chemical stability. The altered secondary
   structure of Ll -CCRH1 at pH 2.0 was stable up to 90 C. Also, in
   presence of 0.25 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCI), it got transformed
   into different structure which was stable in the vicinity of 2 M GdnHCI
   (as compared to drastic loss of native structure in 2 M GdnHC1) as seen
   in far UV-CD spectra. The structural transition of LI-CCRH1 at pH 2.0
   followed another transition after readjusting the pH to 8.0, forming a

Abstract = {Five crops (sunflower, greengram, sesame, sorghum and cowpea) were
   intercropped with three tree species (Casuarina equisetifolia,
   Eucalyptus tereticornis, and Leucaena leucocephala) when the trees were
   24 and 30 months-old. Compared to monocrops, all intercrops suffered
   yield depression, with the exception of sesame and cowpea intercropped
   with C, equisetifolia at 24 months. L. leucocephala was most inhibitory
   and C. equisetifolia least so. The depression of crop yields is
   attributed to competition for light, water and nutrients. L,
   leucocephala had high root content and maximum light interception,
   implying intense subterranean and aerial competition. C. equisetifolia
   had least root content and highest soil moisture content, indicating its
   lesser level of below ground competition. Though light interception was
   least in E, tereticornis, its water extraction was high. Allelopathic
   effects on germination and seedling growth were also evident for all
   three tree species. The effects were greatest for E. tereticornis and
   least for C. equisetifolia.},

Abstract = {Agroforestry practices that include trees on grazing lands could enhance
   atmospheric CO2 sequestration and storage. However, carbon sequestration
   rates and storage capacity of intensively grazed agroforestry systems
   vary due to the diversity in species composition, stand structure,
   system age, and management practices. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate carbon stocks and accrual rates in Leucaena leucocephala +
   Cynadon plectostachyus, and Brachiaria decumbens grass silvopastoral
   systems and compare them with conventional open grazing lands. The study
   was carried out in Chiapas in southern Mexico, one of the hotspots of
   deforestation driven by the expansion of livestock farming. We measured
   above- and belowground carbon stocks in 18 silvopasture (SP) plots, with
   the plantation age ranging from 2 to 10 years. Nine plots of adjacent
   conventional full-sun grasslands (open pasturelands) grazed rotationally
   were sampled for comparison. The average tree biomass stock in SP was
   5.5 +/- 1.9 Mg C ha(-1) and differed with SP age. Mean annual biomass
   accrual rates ranged from 0.25 to 2.57 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), indicating
   that SP systems are CO2 sinks, excluding other sources of GHG such as
   methane emissions from enteric fermentation. The average soil organic
   carbon (SOC) sequestration rate of SP was 0.143 +/- 0.043 Mg C ha(-1)
   year(-1) to 50 cm depth. The SOC sequestration rates correlated
   positively with SP age at the beginning and decreased after about 8
   years. The results suggested that the age and lifespan of trees play a
   significant role in aboveground C sequestration through the Leucaena
   leucocephala SP, while SOC storage varied with soil properties. Further
   research on the relative response of active and stable SOC fractions
   along with soil CO2 fluxes could explain the results on the SOC storage
   potential of these agroforestry systems.},

Abstract = {One of the major obstacles for livestock productivity in the tropics is
   the low protein diets that animals consume. Leucaena leucocephala and
   cassava peels are respective cheap sources of protein and energy for
   West African dwarf goats (WAD), where conventional feed ingredients are
   scarce. The study examined the utilisation of a stepwise replacement of
   cassava peels (CSP) with Leucaena leucocephala (LL) as diets A (100\%
   CSP), B (85\% CSP + 15\% LL), C (70\% CSP + 30\% LL) and D (55\% CSP +
   45\% LL), to monitor feed intake, digestibility and weight gain of WAD
   goats. Results showed that there were significant differences (p<0.05)
   in feed DM intake (range 137.89-235.14 g/day), crude protein (CP) intake
   (range 2.58-6.19 g/d/kg W-0.75), weight gain (range -3.78-43.0 g/d),
   apparent digestibility of CP (range 65.80-86.51\%), dry matter
   digestibility (range 71.75-77.39\%), nitrogen balance (range 0.9-4.38
   g/d) and nitrogen retention (range 0.82-4.09 g/d). Goats fed with 55\%
   CSP + 45\% LL had highest feed intake and the least for those on sole
   CSP. Weight gain (43.0 g/d) of goats fed 45\% LL increased significantly
   while those fed on sole CSP lost weight. Apparent dry matter
   digestibility was highest (p<0.05) in goats for 45\% LL but lowest for
   that in 0\% LL. Dry matter digestibility of goats on 30\% LL was
   significantly higher than those for 0, 15 and 45\% LL. Nitrogen balance
   was apparently highest in goats consuming 45\% LL and the least for 0\%
   LL. The N retention of the goats on 45\% diet was significantly higher
   (p<0.05) than that for 0\% diet. It can be concluded that given sole
   cassava diets to goats seemed to be detrimental but when substituted
   with browse plants, a protein source such as Leucaena leucocephala up to
   45\% may be beneficial.},

   occur prior to the nectar secretion and the secretion was released
   following the rupture of the lifted cuticle.  The cells of the
   sub-secretory zone in a developing nectary developed massive
   accumulation of polyhedral crystals of calcium oxalate, which were
   infrequent in the secretory as well as post-secretory nectaries. 
   However, a few crystals could be observed in such nectaries, especially
   in the parenchymatous cells close to the xylem traces and probably

Abstract = {A phosphorous sorption isotherm was used to establish concentrations of

   of P concentration on the symbiotic interaction between the tropical
   tree legume Leucaena leucocephala and the vesicular-arbuscular
   mycrrohizal (VAM) fungus Glomus fasciculatum was evaluated in pot
   experiments. The level of mycorrhizal infection in Leucaena roots
   increased as the concentration of P was raised from 0.002 to 0.153
   .mu.g/ml. Higher levels of P depressed mycorrhizal infection, but the
   level of infection never declined below 50\%. Periodic monitoring of P
   contents of Leucaena subleaflets indicated that significant mycorrhizal
   activity was detected as early as 17 days after planting, with the
   activity peaking 12 to 16 days thereafter. The highest level of
   mycorrhizal activity was associated with a soil solution P level of
   0.021 .mu.g/ml. Even though the mycorrhizal inoculation effect
   diminished as the  concentration of P in the soil solution was
   increased, mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased P uptake and
   dry-matter yield of Leucaena at all levels of soils solution P examined.
   The concentration of P required by nonmycorrhizal L. leucocephala for
   maximum yield was 27 to 38 times higher than that required by
   mycorrhizal L. leucocephala. The results illustrate the very high
   dependence of L. leucocephala on VAM fungi and the significance of
   optimizing soil solution phosphorus for enhancing the benefits of the

Abstract = {Feeding of the shrimp, Penaeus monodon, with diets containing leaf meal
   of the leguminous shrub, Leucaena leucocephala, resulted in complete

   component of the nucleolus was decondensed in parallel, whereas the
   granular component remained intact. This unique combination of nuclear
   signs was accompanied by only moderate alterations of other cell
   organelles. Our findings therefore demonstrate an encouraging
   possibility to manipulate the chromatin organization in living cells.
   Furthermore, ultrastructural features obtained thus far only in isolated
   and chromatin-depleted nuclei could be verified. These are, for
   instance, filament bundles which attach the nucleolus to the nuclear
   periphery, or a filamentous skeleton of the nuclear pores. In addition,
   the attachment of chromatin to the inner membrane of the nuclear
   envelope was observed. Decondensation was probably caused by the major
   Leucaena ingredient mimosine and is obviously related to its copper
   chelating properties.},

Abstract = {Mlanding tempeh is made from Leucaena leucocephala seed fermentation by
   Rhizopus sp. The traditional process of making Mlanding tempeh consist
   of boiling the seed, crushing to separate the hull, soaking, boiling,
   and fermentation with Usar as inoculum. There are Rhizopus sp. and some
   microbial contaminants in Usar. The objective of the research was to
   study the change on microbial growth (lactic acid bacteria, mold, and
   yeast) during Mlanding tempeh over fermentation. The fresh tempeh was
   obtained from 36 hours fermentation and then continued with fermentation
   up to 120 hours. The results showed that the pH was increased up to 8.5
   at the end of fermentation. The total mold number increased at 36 hours
   fermentation then stable until 72 hours and decreased at the 84 hours
   fermentation and undetected at 108 hours fermentation. During 36 hours
   fermentation, the number of yeasts increased then until 72 hours the
   number of yeasts was stable. In 84 hours the number of yeast decreased
   and finally, the yeast undetected at the 96 hours fermentation. The
   number of lactic acid bacteria increased by 72 hours and then decreased
   until the end of fermentation.},

Title = {Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) Invasion: The Opposite Effects
   of Fire and Flood},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (hereafter L. leucocephala) is considered one of
   the 100 most invasive plant species in the world and has been found in
   areas subject to wildfire events and flooding. Its rapid L. leucocephala
   invasion capacity can lead to decrease in local diversity due to the
   exclusion of native plant species. In this way, the L. leucocephala
   proliferation has advanced across the Pantanal. Here, we assess the
   effects of the fire, flooding and distance to the source population on
   the invasion of L. leucocephala, and whether this dynamic negatively
   affects the richness of native plant species in the Brazilian Pantanal.
   Our results showed that fire recurrence and flood level were the
   opposite under L. leucocephala invasion. Areas with low flood level and
   greater fire occurrence tend to have more L. leucocephala regenerants
   while the distance of the source population had no effect. L.
   leucocephala and native plants occupy sites with different abiotic
   conditions. In an expected scenario for the Pantanal islonger droughts
   and more frequent wildfire, this could mean a pronounced increase in L.
   leucocephala invasion over time. Therefore, the use of fire as a
   management action for L. leucocephala control is not recommended, and it
   is necessary to find methods to extract or eliminate the seed banks.

Abstract = {Very few agroforestry species perform well in the Cuvelai Basin of
   north-central Namibia due to the harsh climatic and edaphic conditions.
   Leucaena leucocephala is one of these species and has many ecological
   and economic benefits but it tends to be invasive. To evaluate the
   suitability of this species for agroforestry in Namibia, two experiments
   were conducted at the Ogongo Campus of the University of Namibia. As
   indication of invasiveness, seed germination and survival of seedlings
   under different management were monitored for 44 weeks and growth rates
   of 33-month-old sprouts were used to estimate the potential wood biomass
   production. Watering and tilling the land gave the highest number of
   surviving seedlings. Death of seedlings was highest during the dry cold
   and dry hot months. Height growth rate of sprouts was 1.98 m year(-1)
   and sun dried wood production was 15.8 tonnes ha(-1) year(-1). Low
   temperature, soil surface hard pan and extreme lack of moisture could
   limit seedling survival and hence invasiveness. Biomass production
   compares favourably with productivity of L. leucocephala grown
   elsewhere. The likelihood of the species becoming invasive is viewed as
   high only in cultivated, irrigated areas. Leucaena leucocephala could be
   utilised as an agroforestry species under proper management to minimise
   chances of it becoming invasive.},

Abstract = {The decline in yield of plantain has partly been attributed to
   inadequate soil moisture and pests, particularly nematodes. The
   objectives of the study therefore were to determine the effect of mulch
   from Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia macrophylla (Willd.) Merr.
   grown as hedgerows on (i) soil moisture and temperature (ii) growth and
   yield of plantain and (iii) pathogenic nematode populations. The study
   was conducted from 1991 to 1994 in Kumasi, Ghana. Treatments comprised
   of leguminous plants, L. leucocephala and F. macrophylla, and a control
   (no leguminous plants), arranged in a randomised complete block design
   with four replications. The leguminous plants were planted in 1991 while
   the plantain was planted in 1992. Results indicated that the highest
   biomass yield was produced by F. macrophylla. Mulching with prunings of
   F. macrophylla resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) higher retention of
   soil moisture and lower soil temperatures than mulching with prunings of
   L. leucocephala. Growth of plantain determined by plant height, leaf
   production, pseudostem girth and yield were significantly greater in F.
   macrophylla mulched plots than L. leucocephala treatment and control
   plots where no mulch was applied. Plant parasitic nematodes isolated
   were Meloidogyne spp., Pratylenchus spp., Paratylenchus spp.,
   Helicotylenchus spp., and Rotylenchus spp. Three years after planting of
   hedgerows, significantly (P < 0.05) higher populations of Meloidogyne
   spp. (367 per 100 g soil), Paratylenchus spp. (92 per 100 g soil),
   Helicotylenchus spp. (8 per 100 g soil),and Rotylenchus spp. (308 per
   100 g soil) were associated with L. leucocephala hedgerow than with
   Flemingia macrophylla hedgerow (42.0, 83.0 per 100 g soil) and the
   control (74.50, 41.0 per 100 g soil). F. macrophylla has qualities that
   suppress nematode populations. The results clearly indicated the
   superiority of Flemingia macrophylla over Leucaena leucocephala as mulch
   for plantain production.},

Journal = {PLANT AND SOIL},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {140},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The residual effect of the fungicide chlorothalonil on the
   vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) symbiosis was evaluated in a
   greenhouse experiment.  The soil used was an oxisol (Tropeptic
   Eutrustox) treated with P to obtain target levels near-optimal for VAM
   activity or sufficient for nonmycorrhizal host growth.  In the
   uninoculated soil treated with the former P level, the fungicide reduced
   VAM colonization of roots and completely suppressed symbiotic
   effectiveness measured in terms of pinnule P content.  When this soil
   was inoculated with Glomus aggregatum, symbiotic effectiveness was
   significantly reduced but not eliminated by 50 mg of the fungicide kg-1.
   At higher chlorothalonil levels, VAM effectiveness but not VAM
   colonization was completely suppressed in the inoculated soil.  The
   pattern with which chlorothalonil influenced tissue P content and dry
   matter yield at the time of harvest closely paralleled its effect on VAM
   effectiveness.  In the soil treated with P level sufficient for
   nonmycorrhizal host growth, the adverse effect of the fungicide on the
   above variables was appreciably milder than when the host relied on VAM
   fungi for its P supply.  The toxic effect of the fungicide, therefore,
   was partly offset by P fertilization, suggesting that VAM fungi were
   more sensitive to chlorothalonil than the host.  Our results demonstrate
   that although the toxic effect of chlorothalonil declined as a function
   of time, a significant level of toxicity persisted 12.5 weeks after the
   chemical was applied to soil.},

Abstract = {(Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae): invader or ruderal?)
   Exotic species have not been recommended for degraded lands
   reforestation, since they are reported to invade natural ecosystems in
   the surrounding areas. Leucena leucocephala, a leguminous N fixing
   species, was introduced in Brazil and has been widely cultivated,
   especially to recover degraded soils. The potential of L. leucocephala
   to expand over the landscape and its persistence in the plant community
   in the long term was analyzed. A stand planted in 1983 was assessed,
   which was installed on a rocky soil, immerse in an agricultural matrix,
   where some native and planted forest patches exists. Over a 200 ha
   at-ea, eleven distinct patches were surveyed, where all individuals from
   arboreal species (minimum height 50 cm) were identified and measured
   (AN, to verify if the exotic species is expanding over areas where it
   has not been planted. In the stand where the species was planted, the
   community structure was assessed on the basis of relative density in
   size classes to verify if the proportion of the exotic species tends to
   increase with time, confirming persistence. Since, among the total of
   4,599 individuals surveyed, not even a single individual of the species
   was recorded beyond the limits of the planted stand, invasion of natural
   ecosystems by Le:feet:a leucocephala was refitted, the species being
   locally considered as ruderal. Even though a huge number of young
   individuals of L. leucocephala are regenerating under the planted trees,
   the relative density of the exotic species in the understorey tends to
   decrease with time. Apparently, some shade tolerant native species can
   slowly dominate the community in the future, taking advantage tinder
   light competition.},

   DIFFERENT LEVELS OF UREA TO RUMEN FERMENTATION, IN VITRO},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES D-ANIMAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The objectives of this work are to characterise the in vitro
   fermentation contribution of both soluble and insoluble fractions, and
   the effects of ensiling of acacia (Acacia saligna, AC) and leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala, LE) leaves with different levels of urea (U, 0,
   1, 3 or 5\%) on gas production, energy value and organic matter
   digestibility (OMD\%) of AC and LE. The acacia and leucaena were ensiled
   for 35 days. Ground samples (200 mg DM) of the ensiled materials from
   the eight treatments were incubated in glass syringes with rumen fluid
   obtained from fistulated sheep fed berseem hay and commercial
   concentrate mixture twice a day. Cumulative gas production was recorded
   at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h of incubation and the kinetics of
   gas production was described by using the equation: Gas (Y) = a + b
   (1-exp(-ct)). Ensiling of AC and LE leaves with U increased crude
   protein and ash, while the contents of tested samples of total phenol
   (TP), total tannins (TT) and condensed tannins (CT) were decreased.
   Also, ensiling of AC and LE leaves with U significantly (P<0.05)
   decreased gas production. All washed samples showed losses of soluble
   material. The gas production was, in general, significantly (P<0.05)
   higher for the unwashed substrates. Leucaena gave the highest values of
   gas production compared with acacia. The gas production volume was
   significantly (P<0.05) higher for ensiled AC and LE leaves without U
   than ensiled AC with 5\% U or ensiled LE with 3\% U. The maximum rate of
   gas production increased after ensiling AC and LE leaves with 5\% and
   3\% U, respectively. The calculated values of metabolizable energy (ME)
   and net energy (NE) were significantly (P<0.05) increased for ensiled AC
   with 3 and 5\% U, while ensiled LE with U was not significantly
   affected. The organic matter digestibility (OMD \%) and microbial
   protein production were significantly (P<0.05) higher for ensiled AC and
   LE with U, while short chain fatty acids (SCFA) were significantly
   (P<0.05) decreased. The concentrations of TP, TT and CT were strongly
   correlated (p<0.01). The TP, TT and CT were negatively related (p<0.01)
   with neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), but
   not with hemicelluloses (HEMI). The crude protein was strongly
   correlated (p<0.01) with NDF, ADF and CT and negatively related (p<0.01)
   with TF and TT, but not with HEMI. In conclusion, there were negative
   effects on the in vitro gas production occurring more consistently when
   AC and LE were ensiled with different levels of U, while OMD\% and
   microbial proteins were significantly (P<0.05) increased. The in vitro
   digestibility and gas production parameters were significantly
   correlated with chemical composition of shrubs. Finally, it is generally
   more appropriate to measure the degradation of organic matter as usual
   dry matter can give problems of interpretation of the significance of
   the soluble fraction.},

Abstract = {Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) fodder was supplemented in the ration of
   21 Barbari kids of uniform age and body weight to supply 0, 25, 50, 75
   and 100\% CP on the basis of their CP requirements for 16 months. After
   this period 5 kids exhibited signs of mandibular osteodystrophy fibrosa.
   Mild to severe changes were recorded in thyroid gland, hepatic
   parenchyma and mucosa of intestine in animals in groups 2 to 5 after
   over 2 years of uninterrupted feeding of subabul. Animals subsisting on
   higher proportion of subabul in the ration (75 and 100\%) exhibited
   decreased number of spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules,
   degenerative changes in the kidney, myofibrils and hyperplasia of spleen
   and lymphnode. On the basis of this study, 25-30\% incorporation of
   subabul which is generally considered safe, does not appear to be safe
   under a long-term feeding.},

Title = {Leucaena leucocephala Fruit Aqueous Extract Stimulates
   Adipogenesis, Lipolysis, and Glucose Uptake in Primary Rat Adipocytes},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala had been traditionally used to treat diabetes. The
   present studywas designed to evaluate in vitro ``insulin-like{''}
   activities of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) deWit. aqueous fruit extract
   on lipid and glucose metabolisms. The ability of the extract to
   stimulate adipogenesis, inhibit lipolysis, and activate radio-labeled
   glucose uptake was assessed using primary rat adipocytes. Quantitative
   Real-Time RT-PCR was performed to investigate effects of the extract on
   expression levels of genes (protein kinases B, AKT; glucose transporter
   4, GLUT4; hormone sensitive lipase, HSL; phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases,
   PI3KA; sterol regulatory element binding factor 1, Srebp1) involved in
   insulin-induced signaling pathways. L. leucocephala aqueous fruit
   extract stimulated moderate adipogenesis and glucose uptake into
   adipocytes when compared to insulin. Generally, the extract exerted a
   considerable level of lipolytic effect at lower concentration but
   decreased gradually at higher concentration. The findings concurred with
   RT-PCR analysis. The expressions of GLUT4 and HSL genes were upregulated
   by twofold and onefold, respectively, whereas AKT, PI3KA, and Srebp1
   genes were downregulated. The L. leucocephala aqueous fruit extract may
   be potentially used as an adjuvant in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes
   mellitus and weight management due to its enhanced glucose uptake and
   balanced adipogenesis and lipolysis properties.},

Abstract = {Among main ways to provide an environmentally friendly energy and
   platform chemicals are the lignocellulosic conversion processes. The
   proper execution of this way will depend on the correct selection of
   lignocellulosic materials. A compelling plant is Leucaena leucocephala
   because its great variety of uses, its high biomass production and its
   leguminous nature. In this study, acid hydrolysis (130-170 degrees C and
   0.5-2\% H2SO4, to extract valuable hemicelluloses) as pretreatment and
   pyrolysis of the solid residue (to get a gaseous fuel) as treatment have
   been used in its valorization. A laboratory-scale reactor was used for
   the pyrolysis experiments (550 degrees C, N-2) for both Leucaena
   leucocephala, as raw material, and the solid residues after hydrolysis
   process and raw material. The amounts of CO, CO2 and H-2 found in the
   raw material are similar to those found in the solids obtained after the
   different studied hydrolysis conditions. Moreover, the thermal behavior
   of studied solids has been studied by thermogravimetric analysis under
   nitrogen atmosphere at different heating rates (5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees
   C min(-1)). Activation energy for all samples has been obtained by the
   Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method. The optimum value, in which a high relationship
   between recoverable hemicelluloses fraction and H-2 concentration is
   found, under medium hydrolysis temperature (150 degrees C) has been
   obtained and was independent of the amount of acid added to the
   hydrolysis process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala leaves and Trigonella foenum-graecum seeds are
   reported to have antidiabetic activity. This research studied the
   interactions of chemical constituent molecules from Leucaena

   macromolecules targets namely dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), protein
   tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B), glucokinase, as well as
   alpha-glucosidase, and predicted the pharmacokinetics profiles of active
   predicted compounds. Molecular docking of all ligands was conducted
   using AutoDock Vina in PyRx and the results were presented as binding
   affinity values (kcal/mol) of ligand against protein. Program PyMol were
   used to visualize the 3D molecular of docked conformation and
   ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacokinetics profiles were predicted
   by SwissADME. The result showed that kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside contained
   in Leucaena leucocephala had best value of binding affinity on protein
   dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (-9.2 kcal/mol) and alpha-glucosidase (-8.8
   kcal/mol). While luteolin-7-glucoside on protein glucokinase (-9.5
   kcal/mol) and tyrosine phosphatase-1B (-9.5 kcal/mol).
   Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside and luteolin-7-glucoside were predicted to
   have low gastrointestinal absorption and cross the blood brain barrier.},

Abstract = {Fuelwood production from a high density leucaena-based fodder production
   experiment at Mtwapa, Coast Province, Kenya is reported.  Leucaena with
   and without other fodder crops namely, Cassava, Bana and Napier grass,
   formed the main-plot treatments while leucaena densities ranging from
   6,250 to 100,000 ha-1 planted in single- or double-line planting
   arrangements formed the sub-plot treatments of the split-plot design
   used.  Each treatment was replicated four times.  The experiment was
   established and maintained without the use of fertilizer, pesticides,
   irrigation.  Hand weeding was done only during the first year.
   After 2.7 years growth, height and diameter measurements were taken
   before cutting back the leucaena stems to 0.5 m above ground. 
   Utilizable fuelwood (twigs greater than 0.5 mm diameter) was then
   sun-dried for 3 months and dry weights taken.
   Fuelwood yields were significantly reduced by the fodder intercrops. 
   Yield from leucaena intercropped with fodder crops were, on average,
   30\% lower than yield from sole stands of leucaena.  Mean yields of the
   single-line plantings ranged from 13.7 to 21.2 tons ha-1.  Yield from
   the double-line plantings were lower (on average 10\%) than that of
   single-line plantings and were as well highly variable.  Unlike tree
   heights, diameters in the single-line planting arrangement were not
   affected significantly by the fodder intercrops.  In the single line
   plantings, yield of fuelwood from sole stand of leucaena was higher at
   all in-row spacings than the yield from intercropped leucaena.  Increase
   in in-row spacing of leucaena generally led to reduced yield of
   fuelwood.
   Fodder yields of intercropped Cassava, Bana and Napier grasses were near
   normal in the first year but zero or negligible in the remaining 1.7
   years.  Implications of the prolonged tree establishment period on
   fodder yields after opening of the canopy are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study examined the reproductive performance of dihydroxy pyridone
   (DHP)-inoculated South African indigenous (SAIG) female goats maintained
   on two dietary treatments: (i) Leucaena leucocephala/grass mixture and
   (ii) natural pasture prior to conception, and during gestation. Leucaena
   leucocephala/grass mixture was nutritionally superior (crude protein and
   mineral elements) than the natural pasture. The average daily gain,
   products of pregnancy and foetal development in gravid goats raised on
   leucaena/grass mixture were significantly (P < 0.03, P < 0.009 and P <
   0.005, respectively) higher than those raised on natural pasture.
   Conception I ate of goats fed natural pasture was higher than the band
   fed Leucaena leucocephala/grass mixture. Leucaena/grass mixture fed
   goats had kids that were heavier at birth than their counterparts on
   natural pasture. Pre-weaning kid mortality over the period of study was
   significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the Leucaena leucocephala/grass
   mixture treatment. Colostrum from kidded goats Fed leucaena was viscous
   and difficult to sample. The absence of mimosine toxicity symptoms
   suggests a possibility of safe use of leucaena as a feed resource to
   DHP-inoculated SAIG. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   accomplishing colon-specific release. In this study, we have explored
   the potential of polyelectrolyte complexes between a succinate
   derivative of Leucaena leucocephala galactomannan and cationic guar gum
   for colon delivery of synbiotic. The PECs were prepared using a
   polyelectrolyte complexation method and characterized. The PECs
   exhibited excellent stability, with high encapsulation efficiency for
   both probiotics (95.53 \%) and prebiotics (83.33 \%). In vitro studies
   demonstrated enhanced survivability and proliferation of the
   encapsulated probiotics in the presence of prebiotics (93.29 \%). The
   SEM images revealed a smooth and firm structure with reduced number of
   pores when both prebiotic and probiotic were encapsulated together. The
   treatment with synbiotic PECs in acetic acid induced IBD rats
   significantly relieves colitis symptoms as was evident from colon/body
   ratio, DAI score and histopathology studies. An increase in the protein
   and reduced glutathione levels and reduction in superoxide dismutase
   activity was observed in colitic rats that received synbiotic treatment
   as compared to colitic rats. Overall, this study highlights the
   potential of Leucaena leucocephala succinate-cationic guar gum PECs as a

Abstract = {Potentially toxic elements (PTE) in soil like copper (Cu) have been
   common in agricultural and mining areas worldwide. The sustainable
   remediation of these areas has been shown to have high
   socio-environmental relevance and phytoremediation is one of the green

   objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological response of
   Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and to determine the species
   tolerance and phytoremediation potential to concentrations of Cu in the
   soil (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/dm(3)). The photosynthetic rate was
   not affected, while the content of chlorophylls decreased as Cu
   concentrations increased. There was an increased in stomatal conductance
   and water use efficiency from the treatment of 300. The root biomass and
   the length were bigger than the shoots, in the treatments above 300. Cu
   accumulation was greater in the roots than in the shoot of the plants,
   thus, the Cu translocation index to the shoot was lower. The ability to
   absorb and accumulate, mainly, Cu in the roots, allowed the development
   and growth of plants, since the parameters of photosynthesis and biomass
   accumulation were not affected by the Cu excess. This accumulation in
   the roots is characterized as a strategy for the phytostabilization of
   Cu. Therefore, L. leucocephala is tolerant to the Cu concentrations
   evaluated and has a potential phytoremediation of Cu in the soil.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of the ingestive behavior in grazing animals is especially
   dependent on the variety and variability of forage in the pasture. The
   objective of this work was to determine the productive and feeding
   behavior in hair sheep grazing in silvopastoral systems with Leucaena
   leucocephala and Cynodon plectostachyus in the humid tropics in Yucatan,
   Mexico. The silvopastoral system was evaluated in the rainy season (June
   to September of 2014) and dry season (December to February of 2015). The
   ingestive behavior of sheep grazing by direct observation of 7 to 17
   hours, recording the time to grazing Cynodon plectostachyus (GCP),
   grazing of weeds (GW), browsing of Leucaena leucocephala (BLl), rumia
   standing (RS), rumination in the lying position (RL) and water
   consumption (WC). The grazing behavior of hair sheep was not affected by
   the time of year neither by the time of day (p>0.05). Similar behavior
   was observed (p>0.05) in the consumption of C. plectostachyus, L.
   leucocephala, weeds and the RS. Similarly, the time of day (morning or
   afternoon) did not affect the behavior of the sheep (p>0.05). However,
   most of the grazing time was devoted to the consumption of C.
   plectostachyus, weeds, RS, rest and water consumption at any time of the
   day in the two seasons evaluated. Was obtained DWG of 16.80 g and 28.35

   been studied as alternative source to fossil fuels. The aim of the
   current study is to physicochemical characterization of the biomass of
   Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) tree species in order to produce
   briquettes. Leucaena wood treated with three moisture levels -T1 (10\%),
   T2 (12\%) and T3 (15\%) -was used to produce briquettes. The study was
   divided in the following stages: analyzing the grinding material and the
   lignin and cellulose particle size distribution, chemical analysis,
   calorific value determination, briquetting and mechanical testing. The
   results were statistically analyzed through ANOVA and Tukey tests. The
   species showed satisfactory performance in the following assessed
   aspects: lignin content (22.61\%), ash content (2.15\%), and calorific
   value (4442.29 kcal. kg(-1)). As for the influence of the moisture
   content, the best results were found in treatment T2 (12\%), wherein the
   mean maximum force was 51.22 kgf, the maximum strain was 0.41 MPa, and
   friability was 4.07\%. It was shown that the moisture content briquettes
   stability and strength. The species showed satisfactory features
   regarding the purpose suggested for all treatments, as well as its
   potential to be used in bioenergy production.},

   between both ecotypes were found in CP in both seasons, while DM, ash,
   OM and OMD had variations. The indicators related to the lignocellulosic
   compounds showed a different performance (P < 0.001) between the
   ecotypes in each season. However, there were no differences in the
   secondary metabolites with values lower than 2.5, 4.5 and 1.5 \% for
   tannins, mimosine and DHP, respectively. The results demonstrate that
   the ecotypes studied have high quality in the seasons studied. However,
   from the chemical composition standpoint, the ecotypes differed
   statistically in some indicators. These differences in the chemical
   constituents may not have biological relevance in ruminant animals. For
   clarifying possible biological differences in the contribution of some
   of these ecotypes to ruminants, further studies on nutrient degradation

Abstract = {Plant species invasiveness is frequently associated with rapid
   proliferation and production of seeds that can persist in the soil for
   long periods of time. Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) is an alien and
   invasive species, for example in Brazilian forest and savannah
   ecosystems. This study quantified the invasive potential of this species
   by analysing its seed rain (using seed collectors), seed longevity in
   the soil (stored in buried bags) and the germination capacity of the
   soil seedbank (by collecting soil samples in the study area). Our
   results showed that seed rain occurred throughout the year, although
   more intensely from July to September, with about 5500 seeds
   m(-2)year(-1) being released. The numbers of seeds in the buried bags
   diminished over time and intact seeds showed low germinability
   (approximately 15\%), although their viability remained >80\% of the
   recovered seeds after two years of in situ storage. The germinability of
   seeds collected directly from the soil was approximately 40\%,
   indicating that more than half of the seeds of soil seedbank were
   dormant (physical dormancy). Leucaena leucocephala produces large
   numbers of seeds and is able to form a persistent short-lived seedbank
   (viability 1-5years). These factors may contribute significantly to its
   invasive potential, which makes it difficult to control this species
   once it becomes established. As control costs become higher over time,
   immediate public efforts are needed to counter this threat.},

Abstract = {Non-destructive and high performance analyses are highly desirable and
   important for assessing the quality of forest seeds. The aim of this
   study was to relate parameters obtained from semi-automated analysis of
   radiographs of Leucaena leucocephala seeds to their physiological

   lots collected from parent trees from the region of Vicosa, MG, Brazil,
   were used. The study was carried out through analysis of radiographic
   images of seeds, from which the percentage of damaged seeds (predation
   and fungi), and measurements of area, perimeter, circularity, relative
   density, and integrated density of the seeds were obtained. After the
   X-ray test, the seeds were tested for germination in order to assess
   variables related to seed physiological quality. Multivariate statistics
   were applied to the data generated, with use of principal component
   analysis (PCA). X-ray testing allowed visualization of details of the
   internal structure of seeds and differences regarding density of seed
   tissues. Semi-automated analysis of radiographic images of Leucaena
   leucocephala seeds provides information on seed physical characteristics
   and generates parameters related to seed physiological quality in a

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, locally known as ``petai
   belalang{''}, is widely used in Malaysia as livestock forage,
   reforestation material, as well as furniture and construction timber.
   This study investigated the properties of strand from L. leucocephala
   wood. Beside no study has been carried out on the strand properties of
   this species to date. Strand properties help to support the suitability
   and effective use of raw materials in wood composite. The main objective
   was to determine the strand properties of L. leucocephala as a raw
   material in the manufacturing of oriented strand board (OSB) under
   laboratory conditions. The study also aimed to determine the recovery
   and effect of age and strand size on bulk density, and to evaluate the
   effects of age and tree portion on strand properties of L. leucocephala
   from eight and sixteen-year-old trees. A total of 28 trees used in this
   study were randomly selected. Stranding process separated the fines and
   sorted the strands into 4 sizes; S0 (25 to 3.2 mm), S1 (19 to 12.7 mm),
   S2 (12.7 to 6.3 mm) and S3 (6.3 to 3.2 mm). Strand sizes of more than 25
   mm and below 3.2 mm were rejected. Results showed that the recovery of
   strands from eight and sixteen-year-old wood was approximately 75.01 and
   70.15\%, respectively. Age and strand size were found to affect bulk
   density significantly. Strand size of S3 from sixteen-year-old gave the
   highest bulk density (436 g/L) while the lowest bulk density (321 g/L)
   was shown by strand size of S1 from eight-year-old. The correlation
   analysis revealed that bulk density showed a positive correlation with
   increase in age (r = 0.69{*}). Bulk density also showed a positive
   correlation with decrease in strand size from S0 to S3 (r = 0.43{*}). On
   average, strands from eight-year-old wood (65.90 mm) are longer than
   that of sixteen-year-old wood (57.64 mm). The average strand thickness
   from eight and sixteen-year-old wood was 0.90 and 1.00 mm, respectively.
   The interaction effects of age and strand size also showed significant
   interaction in area, rectangularity, slenderness ratio and aspect ratio.},

Abstract = {Scarcity of freshwater resources for agricultural purposes is a crucial
   problem in arid and semi-arid regions. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the effects of Moringa seed powder on wastewater quality
   parameters and examine the responses of Leucaena leucocephala seedlings
   irrigated with Moringa-treated wastewater. Moringa seed powder was used
   for different wastewater types (gray, primary-, and tertiary-treated
   wastewater). Wastewaters were treated with Moringa seed powder using the
   following concentrations: 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/L. The analyses of
   wastewaters before and after treatment with Moringa seed powder were
   conducted, and its impact on seed germination and seedling growth of
   Leucaena leucocephala was investigated using Moringa-treated wastewater.
   Our results revealed that Moringa seed powder decreased pH and increased
   electrical conductivity, phosphate, nitrate, and ionic abundance of
   calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium in the treated wastewater as
   Moringa seed powder concentration increases. Both germination rate index
   and percentages were not significantly different for treated wastewater
   as compared to control. However, the treatment showed the highest
   percentage at 0.8 g (95\%) using M. oleifera compared to 0.2 g (86.3\%)
   with M. peregrina. On the other hand, seedling characteristics of
   Leucaena leucocephala improved for both treatments. Shoot heights and
   root lengths were the highest at concentrations 0.2 g (10.48 and 7.28
   cm, respectively) and 0.8 g (10.51 and 7.22 cm, respectively) for both
   M. peregrina and M. oleifera. Finally, Moringa seed powder improved the
   plant productivity using M. oleifera, while slight decline in plant
   height with M. peregrine was shown compared to control.},

   indicates the presence of 1 --> 3 linked rhamnose units. Trisaccharide
   and tetrasaccharide are linear oligomers containing 1 --> 3 and 1 --> 3,
   1 --> 6 linked galactose moieties respectively. However, hexasaccharide
   has a branched structure, and the side chain of arabinose is joined by 1
   --> 2 linkage to the 1 --> 6 linked galactose residue of otherwise 1 -->
   3 linked arabinose galactose main chain. Heptasaccharide has been found
   to have a linear chain frame work constituted of two units of arabinose
   and five units of galactose with 1 --> 3 linkage. Structures of the
   tetrasaccharide, hexasaccharide and heptasaccharide have not been

Abstract = {An intervarietal cross in Leucaena leucocephala between the contrasting
   varieties `'Bald Hills'' and `'Guatemala'' were studied in an experiment
   incorporating the 2 parental varieties, an F2 population, and 37 F3
   families. Characters examined were length of main stem and stem number.
   Phenotypic variances for the F2 population were low in relation to the
   estimated non-genetic variance. In length of main stem 3 months after
   planting, genetic variance accounted for 21.9\% of the total variance,
   and partition of variation showed the presence of strong non-genetic and
   additive genetic components, and absence of any non-additive genetic
   component. In length of main stem at the end of the season and in stem
   number, no genetic variance could be demonstrated. Polysomic inheritance
   is suggested as an explanation of this restricted segregation.
   Differences between F3 family means were highly significant in each of
   the characters measured. Length of main stem and stem number were highly
   correlated (r = 0.5 and 0.7), which suggests that these characters are
   not inherited independently but are both related to plant vigor.
   Applications to plant breeding are discussed.},

Abstract = {Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus) was intercropped for 3 seasons between
   hedgerows of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) spaced 3 or 5 m apart on
   an infertile soil at Mt. Cotton, south-easten Queensland. The leucaena
   was cut at a height of 25 or 50 cm, 2 or 4 times per season and the
   fresh material spread as a mulch between the rows of kenaf. The yield of
   kenaf from mulched plots was compared with that from plots fertilised
   with nitrogen as urea at 0, 50 or 100 kg N/ ha.year. In the third
   season, kenaf yield from the mulched plots was maintained at about 4.7t
   DM/ha, whereas that from the control and urea fertilised plots declined
   by about 30\%. However, phosphorus deficiency in the unmulched plots was
   suspected and this may have contributed to the lower yield. Leucaena row
   spacing had no significant effect on kenaf yield. Leucaena yield ranged
   from 2 to 4t DM/ha per season. Cutting height had no significant effect
   on leucaena yield, but less frequent pruning gave a higher yield in the
   second and third seasons. The results confirm the potential of alley
   cropping to sustain arable crop yield at a moderate level without high
   inputs of inorganic fertilisers.},

Abstract = {Conditioned taste aversions are a useful tool to reduce livestock
   consumption of toxic plants. The forage legume Leucaena leucocephala
   (leucaena) is both toxic and palatable. The objective of this study was
   to determine if goats could be aversively conditioned to avoid leucaena.
   Adult and juvenile female goats, naive to leucaena, were divided into
   control and averted groups. Animals were exposed to leucaena, and
   time(s) spent eating leucaena was measured. During initial conditioning
   with lithium chloride (LiCl), averted goats spent less time eating
   leucaena (P < 0.05) than did controls. The averted groups maintained
   their reduced consumption (P < 0.05) of leucaena compared to controls
   during open field tests when goats could chose between leucaena and
   sugar cane. In final tests (two tests per week), averted goats reduced
   (P < 0.05) the amount of time they spent eating leucaena compared to
   control animals, but the aversion eventually extinguished. Aversive
   conditioning was successful in greatly reducing, but not entirely
   eliminating goats' consumption of leucaena. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Effects and interactions of varying CaSO4 and NaCl levels on growth and
   nitrogen fixation of Leucaena leucocephala K8 were examined. Leucaena
   was grown in nutrient solution at four levels of CaSO4 (0.5, 1.0, 2.5
   and 5.0 mM) and NaCl (1, 25, 50 and 100 mM) in randomized blocks with
   five replications. While NaCl significantly reduced plant growth,
   additions of CaSO4 increased plant height, leaf number, and biomass of
   salt treated plants. For the nonsaline treatments, high CaSO4 levels 
   slightly depressed growth, which contradicts suggestions that Leucaena
   has a high calcium requirement. A significant calcium/sodium interaction
   was not seen for nodule number or weight. Nodule number was
   significantly depressed by 100 mM NaCl and nodule weight of the salt
   stressed plants significantly increased as CaSO4 concentration increased
   from 0.5 to 2.5 mM. Effects of NaCl and CaSO4 on nitrogen content of
   plant parts were inconclusive. The promotion of Leucaena salinity
   tolerance by  addition of CaSO4 may be attributed to the effect of
   calcium in maintaining the selective permeability of membranes.},

Abstract = {Bark from trees is considered a worthless raw material. However, this
   resource could be economically beneficial if utilized efficiently due to
   its rich chemical compounds. In this study, an ethanol toluene-soluble
   extractive, alpha-cellulose and lignin obtained from Leucaena
   leucocephala bark were characterized to determine their chemical
   functional groups. Based on FTIR spectral analysis, the results
   indicated that the bands of the functional groups of the extractive from
   the original bark remain unchanged; however, the absorbance intensity
   was found to be weaker in the group frequency and fingerprint regions.
   Removal of extractive, pectin, hemicellulose and lignin from the bark
   indirectly increased the strong absorbance intensity of cellulose. Broad
   peaks of OH stretching found in all spectra were assigned to the
   presence of phenolic OH and aliphatic structures for extractive and
   aromatic structures of lignin. It was revealed that aromatic functional
   groups were mainly found in the extractive, while water, carbonyl and
   ether were the dominant groups in cellulose, and methyl, methylene,
   carbonyl and carboxyl groups were enriched in lignin.

Abstract = {Fifteen intact male Jamunapari goats, average BW 22.0 kg, were divided
   into three groups to investigate the effects of longterm consumption of
   leucaena on fasting heat production and thyroid hormones. Animals were
   offered rations containing leucaena leaves and twigs to provide about
   0\%, 40\% and 50\% CP in L(1) (control),L(2) and L(3) groups,
   respectively, in Phase I (165 days). In the second phase (210 days) L(1)
   and L(3) were similar to the first phase whereas in L(2) the proportion
   of leucaena was reduced to provide 25\% CP. Basal roughage was Zea mays
   (maize), aerial part, in Phase I and Avena sativa (oat) hay in Phase II.
   Blood samples were collected at 100-day intervals. The mean value of
   triiodothyronine was 0.82 ng ml(-1), 1.00 ng ml(-1), 1.65 ng ml(-1);
   0.84 ng ml(-1), 0.91 ng ml(-1), 0.96 ng ml(-1) and 0.76 ng ml(-1), 0.66
   ng ml(-1) and 0.67 ng ml(-1) in L(1), L(2) and L(3) groups,
   respectively, on Day 135 (Stage I), Day 240 (Stage II) and Day 340
   (Stage III) of feeding. Triiodothyronine was higher (P less than or
   equal to 0.01) for the L(3) group in Stage I with no differences at
   later samplings. Thyroxine level was not affected in this study. Fasting
   heat production (FHP) was not affected by diet (269 +/- 9 kJ per kg
   W-0.79 day(-1)). It is concluded that feeding leucaena up to a level to
   provide 50\% CP in the rations to Jamunapari goats had no effect on FHP
   and serum thyroxine level.},

   For all soils, changes in the concentration of P in the Leucaena tops
   followed trends similar to the yield response curve, i.e., the
   concentration of P was highest at the soil pH at which maximum growth
   occurred. The  concentration of Al in plant tops increased on either
   side of the pH of maximum growth, but Al uptake by the whole plant (tops
   plus roots) declined steadily with increasing pH. Although complete
   major (except P) and minor nutrients were added regularly, there was
   variation in the uptake of nutrients with pH. Poor growth at low pH
   values was attributed to an Al-induced P deficiency within the plant and
   at high pH to a soil P deficiency and, to a smaller extent, to the
   increased concentration of Al in the plant tops.},

   the enhancement of soil N uptake. The best timing of LGM incorporation
   for obtaining more N derived from LGM, less soil N uptake, and greater

   contamination of two plots, one hectare was irrigated with residual
   water and the other with clean water. Later a greenhouse experiment with
   Leucaena leucocephala (guaje) to observe its growth with inoculation of
   Glomus intraradices with different amounts of vermicompost was
   esatblished. A factorial experiment 7x2 completely randomized design
   with five replications in the greenhouse was used. The variables
   measured were plant height, stem diameter, root volume dry weight of
   biomass, dry weight of roots. The experiment lasted 180 days from
   planting until harvesting. It is concluded that the inoculation with
   Glomus intraradices increased the efficiency of Leucaena leucocephala in
   nutrient adsorption. In soil the contamination of Cu, Cr and Ni are
   below the established limits for contaminants. Pb was not found. A
   comparison of soil irrigated with clean water or sewage water indicated
   that Cu is nearly twice as concentrated in soil irrigated by
   contaminated water; Ni is slightly greater; Cr is more abundant in soil

Abstract = {The nutritive value of Leucaena leucocephala, L. diversifolia and L.
   pallida foliage was assessed on the basis of chemical composition, in
   vitro gas production and in sacco dry matter (DM) degradability. L.
   leucocephala had the lowest fibre content, but L. pallida had the
   highest crude protein content, and the lowest extractable and total
   proanthocyanidins contents. L. diversifolia had a lower rate of gas
   production than the other two species (p < 0.05) and tended to produce
   relatively less volume of gas after 12 and 24 h of incubation. The other
   gas production constants and the potential gas production of the three
   species were not significantly different. L. leucocephala had higher (p
   < 0.05) DM degradability than L. diversifolia at 4, 8, 16 and 48 h of
   incubation and higher degradability than L. pallida at 8 and 16 h of
   incubation. However, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in
   overall DM degradation characteristics of the three species, except that
   L. pallida had a lower washing loss (p < 0.05) than L. diversifolia.},

Abstract = {An experiment was carried out in `'Palmichal S.C.'' Experimental
   station, located in El Hornito, at Miranda county of Zulia state,
   characterized as Very Dry Tropical Forest, with 445 mm of precipitation
   and average annual temperature of 29 degrees C in order to evaluate the
   effect of different levels of residual water on the growth of Leucaena
   leucocephala in nursery conditions. The levels of residual water
   evaluated were: 0\% 25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\%. The experimental design
   was completely at random with 20 replications. Results showed that
   height of plants stalk diameter at the base and branches were affected
   (P<0.01) by evaluation periods, observing an increase of this variable,
   with the plant's development The various levels of residual waters,
   influenced the variables under study, finding an increase in the height
   of the plant with concentrations between an increment in height 75\%
   50\% (26.28 cm) and 100\% (27.11 cm) and numbers of branches with levels
   of 25\% (42.80) and 50\% (41.29), while stalk diameter at the base
   decreased significantly (P<0.05) with levels of 75\% and 100\%, with
   4.64 and 4.95 mm respectively.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in order to determine the effect of different
   particle size and pretreatment temperature to the crystallinity of
   leucaena leucocephala. The leucaena was pretreated by ionic liquid
   {[}1-ethyl-3 methylimidazolium acetate {[}Emim]Ac. There were three
   different particle sizes that have been tested in this experiment; less
   than 0.3 mm, 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm. In the other hand, the pretreatment
   temperature tested were 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees C. The
   effect of particle size and pretreatment temperature to the
   crystallinity of leucaena was investigated by using X-Ray Diffraction
   (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The crystallinity index of
   the sample represents the percentage of crystalline materials. A lower
   in the cristallinity index indicated that the material has lower
   crystillinity, hence give more benefit to the cellulose hydrolysis. From
   XRD analysis, it shows that the cristallinity index of leucaena
   decreased with decreasing particle size and increasing pretreatment
   temperature. SEM analysis also shows that the structure of leucaena has
   more irregular, porous and destroyed structure with decreasing particle
   size and increasing pretreatment temperature. Thus, the result from this
   experiment shows that the smaller particle size and higher pretreatment
   temperature would provide a more accessible surface area to enhance the
   cellulose hydrolysis.},

Abstract = {The use of biopolymers in many industrial processes is on the increase.
   The different interactions of biopolymers and electrolytes either in
   aqueous solutions or in solid state provide different physico-chemical
   properties and a simple correlation cannot be established. In this
   study, in order to determine the properties of the complexes of
   galactomannan of Leucaena leucocephala (gal) with the metal ions Al3+
   and Pb2+, toxic elements and Cu2+, essential, the logs of the binding
   constants of the complexes formed in the aqueous solutions were
   calculated. Their rheological properties, their thermal behavior, the
   infrared characteristics and shape and form of the films formed by those
   complexes in solid state were also determined. The aqueous solutions
   properties have shown a better complexation between gal and Al3+. The
   species distribution diagrams have shown an existence of complex species
   going from acidic to basic pH values. Infrared spectra have proved the
   complexations as well as the viscosity studies. Thermal stabilities in
   general were smaller in the complexed species than in the native
   biopolymers and the films obtained from aqueous solutions showed for
   Cu2+ the most different morphology compared to the biopolymer itself. A
   use can be suggested of this biopolymer in environmental remediations
   besides its already stablished industrial uses. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {Deforestation and forest degradation are the biggest threats to our
   forests. Afforestation is one way to sustain life and combat global
   warming. Unfortunately, high cost and hazard factors in handling of tree
   saplings and initial care after planting affect the success rate of
   afforestation projects. Seed ball technique is effective for propagating
   plants from seeds because the seeds are protected from external stress
   and predation. The present experiment investigated the applicability of
   this technique in afforestation programmes at three different locations
   for the establishment of subabul (Leucaena leucocephala), a tree fodder,
   which is a major source of grazing for forest animals. Seed balls was
   prepared using red soil and vermicompost at a ratio of 2:1 and mixed
   with 230-250 mL of water per kg of medium. Seed balls protected the
   seeds from biotic and abiotic stresses and the vermicompost provided
   nutrients and growth hormones which greatly improved the establishment
   and survival rate of subabul. Seed ball technique is recommended for
   forest regeneration and re-greening the earth surface.},

   (Venezuela, Peru, CIAT-17218, CIAT-17222, CIAT-9904, CIAT-17489) in the

Abstract = {A survey was conducted in November, 1984 to quantify the level of
   adoption of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) in central
   and southeast Queensland and to determine reasons for the suspected low
   level of adoption. The survey was of 1208 farms from 14 shires in the
   statistical divisions of Fitzroy, Wide Bay-Burnett and Moreton. These
   comprised 30\% of the beef and dairy producers in these divisions. Valid
   responses were received from 451 producers. Results showed a low level
   of adoption in terms of area planted and number of growers using
   leucaena (6\% of respondents). Adoption was limited by a low level of
   awareness (only 60\% had heard of leucaena), a lack of information and a
   high failure rate (65\% of area originally planted). However, data
   indicated that by 1986 there would be a more than 10-fold increase in
   the area planted and a 3-fold increase in number of growers. Adoption
   was greatest in the Fitzroy Division and was greater for beef than for
   dairy producers.  Other factors influencing adoption of leucaena such as
   property characteristics, attitudes and experiences, and information
   levels and sources are discussed. The high failure rate of leucaena
   plantings was linked to low level of use of recommended cultural
   practices such as scarification and inoculation, and the many small
   plantings (71\% of areas < 4.1 ha) which were vulnerable to damage by
   feral animals.},

Abstract = {A greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the potential use of two

   growth on ameliorated lagoon ash with or without nitrogen (N-2)-fixing
   bacteria inoculation. Even though amendments of 30\% (w/w) vermiculite
   or with sewage sludge compost were added to improve the chemical and
   physical limitations of lagoon ash, significant suppressions in biomass
   and plant nutrient content were found with ameliorated lagoon ash in
   comparison to an agricultural soil. The high proportion of clay-sized (<
   53 mu m) ash particles limited root growth. In addition, heavy metal
   toxicity was a possible factor contributing to poor seedling growth.
   Higher plant productivity resulted from the sewage sludge
   compost-amended lagoon ash than with vermiculite due to a greater
   contribution of plant nutrients in the compost. Nodulation was inhibited
   in ameliorated lagoon ash but not in agricultural soil. High pH and
   electrical conductivity and elevated toxic metals may be important
   parameters that limit bacterial activity. Both species showed potential
   to establish on amended lagoon ash, with Acacia auriculiformis being the

   (B) sugar cane ad libitum + leucaena. Both treatments received 2,6 kg of
   DM of forage and king grass. Leucaena was supplied at a rate of 50\% of
   total DM consumption in only one meal daily. The population of
   cellulytic bacteria was increased (P < 0.01) when leucaena was included.
   The specific activity of the cellulase enzyme complex was of 20.03 and
   69.59 units of activity/mg of protein for treatments A and B,
   respectively. The inclusion of leucaena doubled the population of total
   viable bacteria and the cellulollytic fungi were increased by 5 times.
   There was no effect of leucaena on the final fermentation products. The
   ruminal fermentation pattern was acetic and the leucaena did not
   significantly modify the relative proportions of the different VFA.
   Total population of protozoa was not affected by leucaena inclusion. It
   is concluded that Leucaena leucocephala improves the composition in
   cellulollytic microorganisms, which enables a greater ruminal
   cellulolysis and makes available to the animals the amount of sugars
   necessary for their metabolism and there are bacteria capable of
   degrading the mimosine and the DHP in the rumen.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae), originating from Central
   America, was introduced into Cameroon in the 1960s as a shade tree and
   for soil improvement. The tree is strongly infested by Heteropsylla
   cubana (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), also native to Central America. The
   purpose of this study is to record the presence of the psyllid in
   Cameroon, and assess its infestation pattern in order to provide the
   necessary data for an integrated pest management strategy. Data were
   collected at two sites; Koutaba (Western Highlands) and Yaounde
   (Southern Plateau), respectively, with three plots (K1, K2, K3) at the
   former site and one (Y) at the latter. The relative abundance of
   psyllids varied significantly between the four plots (K = 97.6, d.f. =
   3, P < 0.0001). The Yaounde plot with a mean of 4013.71 individuals/100
   leaves was more infested than any of those in Koutaba (with 1888.10,
   314.60 and 2546.92 individuals/100 leaves, respectively). At both sites,
   the spatial distribution of psyllid populations globally followed an
   aggregated pattern with the dispersion index k ranging from 0.082 to
   5.32. The infestation rate observed was influenced by plot age rather
   than climatic factors. In fact, the Yaounde plot was younger than those
   in Koutaba.},

Abstract = {Catalysts are used to improve the properties of the bio-oil produced
   through biomass pyrolysis. In this study, natural minerals, such as
   natural zeolite and dolomite, were used for the catalytic upgrading of
   the pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala. Pyrolysis was performed using an
   in-house designed fluidized bed system wherein the catalyst beds can be
   placed in two locations. Dolomite and zeolite catalyst beds were placed
   in the primary fluidized bed and/or secondary hot filter reactors. Four
   catalyst configurations were utilized in this study. The effects of the
   type and location of the catalyst on the catalytic activity and product
   selectivity were investigated. The highest light bio-oil fraction was
   obtained using the dolomite catalyst situated at the primary and
   secondary reactors. On the other hand, the configuration in which the
   natural zeolite catalyst was placed in the two reactors produced heavy
   bio-oil that was mainly composed of hydrocarbons. The viscosity, flash
   point, and fly point of the bio-oil produced in this work fall within
   the standard values for fuel oils. In particular, the viscosity of the
   bio-oil produced using the catalysts was lower by 60\% of that of the
   product obtained through noncatalytic biomass pyrolysis. The pyrolysis
   system employed in this study is a promising technology for catalytic
   biomass pyrolysis processes.},

Abstract = {Chromium (Cr) is a heavy metal with risk to human health, and a
   contaminant found in agricultural soil and industrial sites.
   Phytoremediation, which relies on phytoextraction of Cr by biological
   organisms, is an important alternative to costly physical and chemical
   methods of treating contaminated sites. The ability of microorganisms
   like Rhizobium and arbuscular endomycorrhizal fungi (Glomus spp.) to
   enhance Cr uptake and plant tolerance was tested with the leguminous
   plant, Leucaena leucocephala, from southern Mexico and Guatemala, that
   grows in a wide diversity of soils. It is capable of surviving frosts.
   This study showed that the initial amount of Cr added to the soil in a
   pot decreased gradually. This tendency was similar at both
   concentrations evaluated (20 and 200 mg kg(?1)). The pots were watered
   with a slight excess, thus creating the possibility of a lixiviation of
   the metal. However, this was rather small, so the decrease of the metals
   in the soil could be attributed mainly to the plant uptake. in this case
   the mycorrhizal fungi Glomus sp. Zac-19, and Glomus intraradices, as
   well as Rhizobium strains, helped to partially alleviate Cr toxicity as
   indicated by greater plant growth. A considerable Cr accumulation was
   shown in non-colonized plants with 200 mg center dot kg(-1), total
   mycorrhizal colonization as well as its componentes, arbuscular, and
   vesicles were affected more than by 20 mg center dot kg(-1) or 0 mg
   center dot kg(-1) of Cr. In addition, the magnitude was reduced for N,
   P, K content, plant height, number of branches, stem diameter, number of
   leaves, number of leaflets, length of leaves, width of leaves, length of
   root, root volume, dry weight of roots, leaf area, dry weight of leaves,
   dry weight of stem, number of nodules, dry weight of nodules, total
   percentage of colonization (TC), and Cu and Cr contents in the leaf and
   stem. The results will help to design strategies for using Leucaena
   leucocephala associated with arbuscular endomycorrhiza and Rhizobium in
   bioremediation of Cr accumulation.},

Abstract = {The legume-rhizobium association is widely used around the world to
   improve crop production via nitrogen fixation (N-2-fixation).
   Inoculation with suitable strains is required in order to establish
   effective symbioses in soils. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria
   (PGPR) are of biotechnological interest since they can improve plant
   health and soil fertility. A collection of root-nodulating bacteria was
   isolated from Leucaena leucocephala in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.
   The isolates were characterized based on their phenotypic features
   including growth rate, acidification in culture media, utilization of
   carbon sources and salinity stress tolerance. The antibiotic resistance
   level of selected strains was tested against five different antibiotics
   and showed that most of the strains were sensitive to kanamycin (30 mu
   g) but resistant to ampicillin (10 mu g) and
   trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1.25/23.75 mu g). Isolates 40a and 74
   produced substantial amounts of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and other
   isolates produced siderophores. These isolates were used to verify their
   nodulation capacity on L. leucocephala. The 16S rRNA gene products were
   sequenced to determine the identity and phylogenetic diversity of the
   isolates, placing them in the genera Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium (syn.
   Ensifer). Based on this study, we propose that isolates Sinorhizobium
   (40a) and Rhizobium (74) are potential candidates to be used as
   inoculants to enhance symbioses and N-2-fixation using Leucaena
   leucocephala in karst soils.},

   45\% when fermented OFI was included in the ration in T4 (P<0.05).
   Ammonia-nitrogen, volatile fatty acids, gas production and
   acetate:propionate ratio were different among treatments. The maximum

   However, no changes were observed among T1, T2 and T3 (P>0.05). In
   addition, lag phase decreased in T2 (P<0.05). Furthermore, methane
   production was different among treatments (P<0.05); reductions of 26 and
   14\% were observed when including LL and OFI, respectively. Thus,

Abstract = {In a 3-year field study, the effects of substitution of nitrogen
   requirement of maize through Leucaena leaves were studied on runoff,
   soil loss, maize and wheat yield and economic returns. The treatments
   were (1) 80 kg N ha -1 all through Leucaena leaves (80 L), (2) 40 kg N
   through Leucaena leaves + 40 kg N ha-1 through fertilizer (40 L + 40 F),
   (3) 20 kg N through Leucaena leaves + 60 kg N ha-1 through fertilizer
   (20 L + 60 F), (4) 80 kg N ha-1 all through fertilizer (80 F), and (5)
   control (No fertilizer). Green Leucaena leaf biomass (containing 3.3\% N
   on dry basis) was incorporated every year in 15 cm top soil two weeks
   before sowing of summer maize.
   Other treatments being almost equal, runoff was reduced marginally in
   treatment 20 L + 60 F which was attributed to better crop growth in this
   treatment. Mean minimum soil loss (6.202 t ha-1) also occurred in
   treatment 20 L + 60 F. Soil loss in 80 L was 13\% less than in 80 F.
   Maize yield was at par in 80 L and 80 F. However, mean maximum yield of
   maize was obtained with 20 L + 60 F.
   Residual effect of incorporation of Leucaena leaves to maize crop was
   observed on wheat yield. The mean yield differences were statistically
   at par in all the treatments except control. The total mean net returns
   were statistically at par in 80 L and 80 F. However, significantly
   higher mean net returns (Rs 6811 ha-1; one US\$ = Rs30) were obtained
   with 20 L + 60 F. Substitution of N through Leucaena leaves even in
   small quantity may be helpful to small holders, particularly where

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted at Embu, in the central highlands of Kenya,
   to determine the optimum ratio for intercropping napier grass with
   Leucaena leucocephala and Calliandra calothyrsus, for fodder production.
   The treatments consisted of pure stands of napier, L. leucocephala and
   C. calothyrsus, together with intercrops of napier with each of the two
   shrub species at 1:1 and 4:1 ratios. The yield of napier grass in pure
   stands dropped dramatically over the four years of the study, and also
   when grown in combination with the tree legumes. The tree legume yields
   did not decrease over time, but were greatly reduced by the presence of
   napier, especially at the 4:1 combination. L. leucocephala appeared to
   have a lesser effect on the grass yields than C, calothyrsus, probably
   reflecting less competitive ability. Total grass yields when grown in
   combination with the legumes were similar to those of pure grass alone,
   but the I:1 combinations produced less grass but more legume than the
   4:1. The recommended napier-tree legume combination is different for the
   two species. For L. leucocephala, the best combination would be one or
   two rows of trees to one row of napier. For C. calothyrsus, this would
   be one raw of trees to two or three rows of napier, but the nutritive
   value of this species needs to be considered also.},

Abstract = {Agroforestry species Leucaena leucocephala (subabul), a multipurpose
   leguminous tree, is one of the most suitable species for silvipasture
   system. Its seeds, a good protein source to livestock, also have lot of
   industrial application. Subabul responds well to pollarding, a practice
   that helps growth of understory crops but reduces seed yield of main
   tree species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
   nutrient application on fruit and seed characters, seed yield,
   germination and vigour of pollarded subabul trees. The study was
   conducted on three important salvodar type subabul varieties (K8, K636
   and S24) with different fruit and seed characters. Three nutrient
   mixtures (SSP @ 150 kg/ha + ZnSO4 @ 20 kg/ha; CuSO4 @ 0.25 \% + Borax @
   0.15 \% + KNO3 @ 1 \% in 500 l spray volume per ha and KNO3 @ 4 kg/ha)
   were applied before anthesis. The nutrient treatments have enhanced
   fruit length and weight without affecting the fruit width. Similarly,
   seed characters responded positively to nutrient applications resulting
   in enhanced mean yield across varieties and years. The seed viability
   measured as germination percentage varied among varieties with maximum
   viability in small-seeded K 636. The application of nutrients enhanced
   the germination and vigour in all three varieties irrespective of the
   seed size. Among the nutrient mixtures, potassium nitrate @ 4 kg/ha has
   better effect on seed yield and its attributing characters as well as on
   seed quality across the varieties over the years.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) is an arboreal species of
   wide use in the world, mainly for feeding ruminants in semiarid climate
   regions. Given its relevance, the aim of this study was to evaluate the
   effects of water and thermal stress on the germination and vigor of L.
   leucocephala seeds. The experiment was installed in 3 x 4 factorial
   arrangement, considering the water potential (0.0, -0.3 and -0.6 MPa)
   and temperature (25, 30, 35 and 40 degrees C) factors on the seeds
   germination performance. The variables evaluated were: germination,
   abnormal seedlings, first germination count, germination speed index and
   seedling performance (length and dry mass weight of root and aerial
   part). The reduction of the water potential from -0.3 MPa reduced the
   germination and seed vigor, indicating that the tolerance of the species
   to water stress in the germination phase is low. The temperature range
   of 25-30 degrees C is ideal for germination and seedlings initial
   growth, but the seeds continue to germinate under a temperature
   elevation to 35 degrees C. The L. leucocephala seeds are poorly tolerant
   to water and thermal stresses and, consequently, the germinative
   capacity and vigor are reduced with decreasing water potential from -0.3
   MPa and temperatures above 30 degrees C.},

Abstract = {The effects of feeding Leucaena leucocephala on semen quality and
   fertility were examined using four dihydroxy pyridone (DHP)-adapted
   (21.0, 26.5, 27.0 and 31.0 kg) and four DHP-unadapted (28.0, 31.0, 40.0
   and 44.0 kg) South African indigenous Nguni bucks (mature male goats).
   The DHP-adapted bucks were assigned to air-dried Leucaena leucocephala
   forage (LL; Leucaena group) while the unadapted ones were maintained on
   a cereal-based concentrate diet (C; concentrate group) containing 122 g
   crude protein (CP)/kg over an 84-day period. Buck semen samples were
   collected on days 0 and 77 of the study. On the last day of the study
   (day 84), bucks in the Leucaena group were divided into two equal
   subgroups; a subgroup was assigned to Leucaena leucocephala-grass
   pasture (LGP) with ten does (mature female goats) while the second
   subgroup was assigned to natural pasture (NP) with nine does. Similarly,
   the two concentrate subgroups were separately assigned to mate nine and
   ten does on LGP and NP plots, respectively. The proportions of normal
   semen on both groups were not significantly different. However, semen
   quality on LL treatment increased significantly (P = 0.004) between days
   0 and 77 and probably explains the significant (P < 0.01) difference
   between the fertility rates of bucks on both treatments. There was no
   evidence that feeding LL was detrimental to semen quality and fertility
   of bucks and to conception among females mated by the bucks fed the
   forage; perhaps due to the fact that the bucks had adapted to DHP as a
   result of the DHP-degrading rumen bacteria (Synergistes jonesii) that
   were transferred to them by the does. Synergistes jonesii is known to be
   capable of detoxifying mimosine and its toxic metabolites to innocuous
   compounds.},

   Invasive Plant Species},
Journal = {PLANTS-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit is native to southern Mexico and
   Central America and is now naturalized in more than 130 countries. The
   spread of L. leucocephala is probably due to its multipurpose use such
   as fodder, timber, paper pulp, shade trees, and soil amendment. However,
   the species is listed in the world's 100 worst invasive alien species,
   and an aggressive colonizer. It forms dense monospecific stands and
   threatens native plant communities, especially in oceanic islands.
   Phytotoxic chemical interactions such as allelopathy have been reported
   to play an important role in the invasion of several invasive plant
   species. Possible evidence for allelopathy of L. leucocephala has also
   been accumulated in the literature over 30 years. The extracts,
   leachates, root exudates, litter, decomposing residues, and rhizosphere
   soil of L. leucocephala increased the mortality and suppressed the
   germination and growth of several plant species, including weeds and
   woody plants. Those observations suggest that L. leucocephala is
   allelopathic and contains certain allelochemicals. Those allelochemicals
   may release into the rhizosphere soil during decomposition process of
   the plant residues and root exudation. Several putative allelochemicals
   such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and mimosine were identified in L.
   leucocephala. The species produces a large amount of mimosine and
   accumulates it in almost all parts of the plants, including leaves,
   stems, seeds, flowers, roots, and root nodules. The concentrations of
   mimosine in these parts were 0.11 to 6.4\% of their dry weight. Mimosine
   showed growth inhibitory activity against several plant species,
   including some woody plants and invasive plants. Mimosine blocked cell
   division of protoplasts from Petunia hybrida hort. ex E. Vilm. between
   G(1) and S phases, and disturbed the enzyme activity such as peroxidase,
   catalase, and IAA oxidase. Some of those identified compounds in L.
   leucocephala may be involved in its allelopathy. Therefore, the
   allelopathic property of L. leucocephala may support its invasive
   potential and formation of dense monospecific stands. However, the
   concentrations of mimosine, phenolic acids, and flavonoids in the
   vicinity of L. leucocephala, including its rhizosphere soil, have not
   yet been reported.},

Title = {The soil response in experimental Leucaena leucocephala plots
   under manipulated rainfall regimes},
Journal = {TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 19},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala, a prominent invasive woody plant in India, is
   constantly recognised for its capacity to invade in various ecosystems.
   The chances of invasion by L. leucocephala are increasing due to
   rainfall variability, to which the plant has already adapted. However,
   the understanding of L. leucocephala, particularly its response to soil
   attributes and alterations in nutrient cycling processes under varying
   rainfall conditions, is currently inadequate. In response to the
   perceived threat of rainfall shift and invasion impacting native plant
   species through soil modification, the study was designed to investigate
   the interplay between L. leucocephala invasion and simulated rainfall
   conditions. The experimental setup included three rainout shelter plots
   receiving different precipitation levels (low, normal, and high) and
   subplots within each plot dedicated to pure stands of L. leucocephala.
   The study findings reveal significant variations in soil inorganic
   nitrogen and N-mineralization based on precipitation levels and seasons,
   with the highest values observed in the high rainfall plot and during
   the rainy season. In contrast, microbial biomass (carbon and nitrogen)
   peaked in the low rainfall plot and during the summer season, indicating
   a contrasting trend. The implications of the study suggest that, in
   addition to variable rainfall, L. leucocephala may play a significant
   role in altering nutrient cycling, particularly nitrogen cycling. The
   plant enhances soil properties related to nitrogen availability,
   creating opportunities for multiple invasions and potentially leading to
   a chance of ``Invasion Meltdown,{''} with a significant threat to native
   biodiversity. Overall, the research is emphasizing the need for a
   comprehensive understanding of these dynamics to formulate effective
   management strategies for preserving native ecosystems.},

   544 trees cultivated with and without organic compound were measured 19
   times during the period of 1990 - 2003. The models of Schumacher,
   Chapman-Richards, Silva-Bailey, Mitscherlich, Weibull and Clutter-Jones
   were tested and compared. To select the best equations, the Index of Fit
   (IF), standard error of estimate (S-yx \%), identity model test and the
   graphic of residuals distribution were used and results show that the
   model of Clutter-Jones provided a better IF for both treatments. The
   graphic of residual distribution did not show tendency among the models.
   The model identity test showed no differences among the models tested.
   As Schumacher's model has been used frequently in forestry and presented
   the smallest number of parameters, it deserves special focus in studies
   of site index.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala, one of the promising feed sources in aquaculture
   of tropical regions, induces drastic pathological alterations in the
   midgut gland (= hepatopancreas) cells of Penaeus monodon postlarvae.
   After 28 d feeding on a formulated diet containing Leucaena with natural
   mimosine content, the most severely affected cell type is the R-cell,
   followed by F-cells. B-cells are only rarely pathologically changed.
   Artificial reduction of mimosine content prior to diet formulation
   results in less severe signs of pathology. The course of cell injury
   suggests that the nucleus is one of the primary targets of Leucaena
   toxicity to midgut gland-cells. Pathology starts, in all cell types,
   with alterations in the fibrillar component of the nucleolus accompanied
   by fading of the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Thereafter, the
   heterochromatin of the cell nucleus is step-by-step decondensed.
   Obviously, structural components of the nucleolus organizer region are
   changed, thus leading to a cessation of rRNA synthesis and eventually of
   ribosome production. The simultaneous decondensation of the nuclear 
   heterochromatin may cause disturbances of cell function and finally lead
   to cell lysis. Prawns may die of septicemia when high numbers of midgut
   gland epithelium cells are destroyed. From the cytoplasmic organelles,
   only the mitochondria and F-cell dictyosomes display disorders in the
   early stages of pathology. These alterations are probably
   nucleus-independent. The darkening of the mitochondrial matrix may be
   caused by depletion of oxidative phosphorylation due to enzyme
   inhibition, whereas  the vacuolization of the Golgi-cisternae in F-cells
   is interpreted as cytoskeleton injury.},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {In the present study, a 0.47 kb OMT gene construct from aspen, encoding
   for an enzyme O-methyltransferase (OMT, EC 2.1.1.6), in antisense
   orientation was used to down-regulate lignin biosynthesis in Leucaena
   leucocephala. The plants were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens
   strain harboring the antisense gene, and the transformation was
   confirmed by PCR amplification of the npt II gene. The integration of a
   heterologous antisense OMT gene construct in transformed plants led to a
   maximum of 60\% reduction in OMT activity relative to control. The
   evaluation of total lignin content by the Klason method revealed a
   maximum of 28\% reduction. Histochemical analyses of stem sections
   depicted a reduction in lignin content and normal xylem development. The
   results also suggested a probable increase in aldehyde levels and a
   decrease in syringyl units. Lignin down-regulation was accompanied by an
   increase in methanol soluble phenolics to an extent that had no impact
   on wood discoloration, and the plants displayed a normal phenotype.
   Concomitantly, an increase of up to 9\% in cellulose content was also
   observed. Upon alkali extraction, modified lignin was more extractable
   as evident from reduced Klason lignin in saponified residue and
   increased alkali soluble phenolics. The results together suggested that
   the extent of down-regulation of OMT activity achieved may lead to
   quality amelioration of Leucaena with respect to its applicability in
   pulp and paper manufacture as well as nutritive and easily digestible
   forage production.},

Volume = {94},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is one of the 22 Leucaena species that
   originated in Central America. There are two major subspecies of
   leucaena, L. leucocephala subsp. glabrata (giant leucaena) and L.
   leucocephala subsp. leucocephala (common leucaena). Giant leucaena is a
   medium size fast-growing tree important for agroforestry while common
   leucaena is a small bushy shrub that is considered to be an invasive
   weed. Giant leucaena can be grown as a woody tree of up to similar to 20
   m in height or maintained as a bushy fodder legume by repeated harvest
   of its foliage several times a year. Giant leucaena grown for fodder can
   produce forage dry mater yield of up to 34 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). High
   forage yield together with high protein content makes leucaena an ideal
   fodder legume for the tropical and subtropical regions of the world.
   Although mimosine present in the leucaena foliage has toxicity, it
   should not be a big concern because ruminants can be successfully
   inoculated with the mimosine-metabolizing rumen bacterium Synergistis
   jonesii. Alternatively, mimosine present in the leucaena foliage can be
   removed easily and inexpensively through simple processing. Giant
   leucaena cultivars are generally free from diseases and are highly
   tolerant to drought. Although infestation by psyllids may be a problem,
   a number of psyllid-resistant cultivars of giant leucaena have been
   developed through interspecies hybridization. The wood of giant leucaena
   can be used for timber, paper pulp, or biofuel production. Leucaena
   foliage and wood may serve as raw materials for development of new
   industry for production of phytochemicals such as mimosine, tannins and
   anthocyanins, wood products, and high-protein animal feed for farm
   animals in the future.},

Abstract = {The effect of Leucaena leucocephala inclusion in sheep diets upon rumen
   function was evaluated. Nine Pelibuey sheep, 32.6 +/- 5.33 kg live
   weight (LW), fitted with rumen cannula were used. A complete randomized
   block design was employed. Two experimental periods of 60 days each,
   with 60-day intervals between them, were used. Experimental treatments
   were as follows (n = 6): T1 (control), 100 \% Pennisetum purpureum
   grass; T2, 20 \% L. leucocephala + 80 \% P. purpureum; T3, 40 \% L.
   leucocephala + 60 \% P. purpureum. In situ rumen neutral detergent fiber
   (aNDF) and crude protein (CP) degradation, dry matter intake (DMI),
   volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, estimated methane (CH4) yield,
   rumen pH, ammonia nitrogen (N-NH3), and protozoa counts were measured.
   The aNDF in situ rumen degradation of P. purpureum and leucaena was
   higher (P < 0.05) in T2 and T3. Leucaena CP degradation was higher in T2
   and T3 but for P. purpureum it was only significantly higher in T3.
   Leucaena aNDF and CP degradation rate (c) was 50 \% higher (P < 0.05) in
   T2 and T3, but only higher in T3 for P. purpureum. Voluntary intake and
   rumen (N-NH3) was higher in T2 and T3 (P = 0.0001, P = 0.005,
   respectively). Molar VFA proportions were similar for all treatments (P
   > 0.05). Protozoa counts and in vitro gas production (48 h) were lower
   in T2 and T3 (P < 0.05, P < 0.0001). Estimated methane yield (mol
   CH4/day) was higher in sheep fed leucaena (P < 0.0001). However, CH4
   yield relative to animal performance (mol CH4/g LW gain) was lower in T2
   and T3 (P < 0.0001). In summary, these results indicate that including
   L. leucocephala in sheep diets did not modify rumen fermentation pattern
   (same VFA ratios) nor reduce the amount of CH4 per unit of DMI (mol
   CH4/g DMI). However, leucaena inclusion does increase rumen N-NH3, aNDF
   and CP digestibility, and voluntary intake.},

   observed. Pot trials however, showed that soil incorporation of leucaena
   leaves was more effective than surface application in increasing plant
   dry weight. Leucaena leaves were not as effective as inorganic N in
   increasing maize grain yield (field trials) or dry matter production
   (pot trial). Unlike inorganic N, leucaena leaves had a significant
   residual effect on the succeeding maize crop. In decomposition studies,
   buried leucaena leaves decomposed more quickly than surface-applied
   leaves, and fresh leaves  decomposed more rapidly than dried leaves.},

Abstract = {Lignin is the second most abundant renewable biopolymer on earth after
   cellulose. It is being used in many industrial applications due to its
   abundance. In the present study, lignin was isolated from the stems of
   Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit., a high biomass yielding plant
   using acidic dioxane under N-2 atmosphere. Structural characterization
   of isolated dioxane lignin (DL) was performed by analytical techniques:
   UV, FT-IR, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR. Their monolignol content was determined
   by nitrobenzene oxidation followed by HPLC-MS/MS analysis. The data was
   compared with commercial alkali lignin (AL). The results showed that DL
   is of hardwood guaiacyl-syringyl (GS) type, whereas AL is softwood type
   with more guaiacyl units and trace amounts of p-hydroxyphenyl units (H).
   Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of DL showed two stage thermal
   degradation profile similar to AL. The DTG(max) for DL and AL were found
   in the second major loss event of second stage of TGA at 424 degrees C
   and 404 degrees C, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   study exhibited the glass transition temperatures (T-g) at 132 degrees C
   and 122 degrees C for DL and AL, respectively. The results from thermal
   stability studies suggest that dioxane lignin isolated from the
   ``miracle tree{''} (subabul) can be exploited in various thermoplastic
   industrial applications.},

   applied to 61 isolates from a large collection of strains isolated from
   bean plants inoculated with the same soil samples. Rhizobium tropici was
   present at all sites. The population of rhizobia isolated from bean
   plants was more heterogeneous than rhizobial population isolated from
   Leucaena. More than 90\% of Leucaena isolates could be typed as R.
   tropici. Strains typed as R. tropici hybridized with R. leguminosarum
   hup structural genes, but not with R. leguminosarum by. phaseoli ORF3,

Title = {A Multipurpose Leguminous Plant for the Mediterranean Countries:
   Leucaena leucocephala as an Alternative Protein Source: A Review},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The need to address the shortage of protein ingredients
   linked to both territoriality and growing demand pushes research to
   focus attention on alternative protein sources, both vegetable and
   animal (insects). This review describes the characteristics, uses,
   strengths, and weaknesses of Leucaena leucocephala, a legume that can be
   used in the zootechnical field as an alternative to traditional protein
   sources for feed formulation. In tropical and subtropical regions, as
   well as in the internal and/or marginal Mediterranean areas, one of the
   most important problems related to animal production is represented by
   the inadequate nutritional supplies. The low productivity of the
   animals, often connected to reduced annual growth, is, in fact, not
   infrequently attributable to the low nitrogen content and the high fiber
   content of the local plant species and crop residues that constitute the
   base ingredients of the rations commonly adopted by farmers. The use of
   the supplementation with arboreal and shrub fodder, although often
   containing anti-nutritional factors and toxins that limit its use, could
   be a profitable way to alleviate the nutritional deficiencies of the
   basic diets. Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit is native to Central
   America and widely naturalized in the majority of Latin American
   countries. It is a legume suitable for tropical and subtropical
   environments including the countries of the Mediterranean area.
   Moreover, its spread is desirable if we consider the multiple uses to
   which it is suitable, the considerable amount of biomass produced, and
   its role in preserving the environment. The aim of this work was to
   highlight the characteristics of Leucaena that can justify its wide
   diffusion. A structured analysis of strengths and weaknesses was
   performed accordingly. Being a good protein source for feeding
   livestock, it could be a species to be introduced in the inland areas of
   the Mediterranean countries as an alternative protein source; the limit
   represented by the presence of anti-nutritional factors could be
   overcome by feed processing and by launching targeted research programs.},

   cultivars in the non-alley field had higher root-knot nematode galling
   indices than those in the alley field in both the 2005 and 2006 trials.
   Fruit yields of okra cultivars were higher in the alley than the
   non-alley field. In the alley and non-alley fields, okra cv. 47-4
   recorded the highest fruit yield in both years of the trial. Soil
   population densities of four genera of plant-parasitic nematodes
   increased in both the alley and non-alley fields. However, there was a
   much greater increase in the non-alley field, suggesting that L.

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Information is lacking on the potential of leguminous fodder trees such
   as Leucaena leucocephala as a feed resource to supplement the native
   forages in traditional grazing management systems in the tropics. Two
   studies were conducted (1) to assess traditional fodder banks' forage
   nutritive potential on animal production, and (2) to investigate the
   effect of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM) supplementation on
   growth of steers grazing standing hay basal forages in the dry season.
   The traditional forages had low nutritive values indicated by low mean
   crude protein (CP) of 23 g kg(-1) dry matter (DM), and high fibre
   contents of 717, 546 and 153 g kg(-1) DM for neutral detergent fibre
   (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL),
   respectively. The forages were poorly degraded in sacco and had low
   metabolisable energy (ME) (4.2-4.6 MJ kg(-1) DM). Mean washing losses A,
   slowly degradable DM fraction, B, potential degradability, (A+B) and
   mean 48 h DM degradability (DMD) of grazing land forages were 70, 471,
   541 and 326 g kg(-1) DM, respectively. In the supplementation study, 16
   growing steers (160.8 +/- 0.24 kg) were randomly allocated into four
   groups, in a completely randomized design. Four LLM treatment diets (T1,
   T2, T3 and T4), with four levels: 0, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 kg DM for control,
   low, medium and high LLM levels, respectively, were randomly allocated
   to the animals in the four groups for 70 days (d). LLM supplementation
   (p < 0.05) improved mean weight gain from -0.30 to 0.26 kg steer(-1)
   d(-1), for T1 and T4, respectively. Steers on T4 gained (p < 0.05) more
   weight compared to the animals in T1 and T2, though there was no (p >
   0.05) difference in weight gains between animals on T3 and T4 (0.14 vs.
   0.26 kg steer(-1) d(-1), respectively). Standing hay basal forages alone
   could not sustain animal productivity during dry seasons unless
   corrected for protein. Higher levels of LLM supplementation prevented
   weight losses and improved the performance of grazing steers, a
   management practice thought appropriate to low income pastoralists in
   semiarid western Tanzania.},

Abstract = {Heavy metals are characterised by a relatively high density and cause
   genotoxic, cytotoxic and mutagenic effects on plants, animals and
   humans. Lead (Pb) is one of the heavy metals that causes toxicity to
   plants and animals. This experiment was conducted using a hydroponic
   technique to study the effects of Pb(NO3)(2) on physiological,
   biochemical and ultrastructural characteristics in Leucaena leucocephala
   seedlings. Plants were grown in a growth chamber for 21 days in
   Hoagland's solution supplemented with 0 (control), 25, 50, 100, 300, 500
   and 700 mu m Pb(NO3)(2). Shoot heights as well as root lengths decreased
   significantly in Pb-treated plants with 300, 500 and 700 mu m. In
   Pb-treated plants with high Pb concentrations, photosynthesis rate
   (P-N), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and transpiration rate (E) decreased.
   Total protein and carbohydrate content in Pb-treated plants with 300,
   500 and 700 mu m increased significantly in leaves. Moreover, in
   Pb-treated plants with 300, 500 and 700 mu m Pb(NO3)(2), mesophyll cells
   had enlarged chloroplasts with disrupted thylakoid membranes associated
   with large starch grains. In contrast, Pb treatments with 25, 50 mu m
   and 100 mu m were not toxic to the plants. Thick sections of roots of
   Pb-treated plants with 300, 500 and 700 mu m Pb showed distinct changes
   in structure of epidermal and cortical cells. Moreover, thin sections of
   roots of Pb-treated plants with 300, 500 and 700 mu m Pb had thickened
   walls of xylem cells. These results will shed more light in
   understanding the effects of heavy metal stress on plants.},

Abstract = {A rapid growth of the meat production industry is necessary to satisfy
   increased demand for this commodity, which might have negative impacts
   on the environment. The objective of this study was to assess enteric
   methane (CH4) emissions when a forage legume is introduced in the diet
   of animals consuming a tropical grass. Eight Lucerna heifers, 218 +/- 18
   kg live weight with an average age of 19 +/- 3 months were used in two
   experiments following a changeover design. The diets evaluated were
   100\% star grass (Cynodon plectostachyus, S) or 76\% star grass plus
   24\% leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala, S+L). Throughout the experiment,
   animals were housed in two chambers, in which the diet was offered four
   times daily. Each chamber had a small wind tunnel, which housed a fan
   set to a constant speed of extraction. Air samples were obtained every
   hour during 24 h both inside and outside (ambient) the tunnel. Methane
   concentration in these samples was determined by gas chromatography.
   Temperature and relative humidity both inside and outside the tunnel
   were recorded using a thermo-hygrometer. The S+L diet had greater
   protein content whereas the S diet had greater content of neutral
   detergent fiber. Average intake (kg/d) of fresh forage and dry matter
   (DM) was significantly greater (23.7 and 5.6) for the S+L than for the S
   diet (18.9 and 4.7), respectively (P < 0.05). The maximum recorded
   temperature and humidity inside the chamber was 35.5 degrees C and 99\%,
   respectively, but the minimum values were 19.1 degrees C and 38\%,
   respectively. Methane production (L/kg DMI) was 37.7 for the S+L
   treatment and 43. 6 for the S treatment. The energy loss in the form of
   methane emitted was 8.0\% for S+L and 9.4\% for the star grass based
   diet (P=0.32). These results suggest that while increasing animal
   productivity by increasing dry matter intake, the inclusion of leucaena
   does not increase methane emission per animal, thus significantly
   decreasing methane emissions per kg of meat or milk produced. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia nilotica are two arboreal legumes with
   several uses in agriculture, nutritious forage and livelihoods, fence
   posts, wood production, biofuel production, charcoal, firewood, shading,
   hedges, windbreaks, and improvement of soil fertility. The seed dormancy
   is common in Leucaena and Acacia species, and it creates difficulties in
   seed testing and planting. The aim of this study is to determine the
   effective methods of sulfuric acid and hot water due to overcoming
   dormancy in seeds of those species. Most pretreatmerits significantly (p
   < 0.05) reduced hard seed content and enhanced germination percentage
   when compared to nontreated seeds. Effectiveness of water and acid
   pretreatments increased when increasing in duration time from 3 to
   60min. The best recommended time pretreatment of sulfuric acid 60 min
   for A. nilotica, and 3 min of hot water for Leucaena. These treatments
   all reduced hard seeds to 0\% and did not cause damage to the seeds
   during the germination. Further, the lens and hilum both were identified
   as primary sites for water uptake into the seeds of Leucaena. Whereas,
   the lens was recognized as the original site of water intake in A.
   nilotica. In addition, the seed coat anatomy identified that the
   palisade epidermal layer was dense, and thickness tissue had been
   prevented imbibition of water in Leucaena and A. nilotica.},

Abstract = {Amino acid profiles of leaf, stem, and root tissues from nodulated and
   nonnodulated Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit plants were determined
   by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. High concentrations of mimosine
   and several other potentially toxic nonprotein amino acids, including
   pipecolic acid, and two isomers of hydroxypipecolic acid, were
   identified in the tissues. Five metabolites remain unidentified.  Of the
   foliar free amino acid nitrogen, 57-66\% was associated with the
   potentially toxic amino acids. Major constituents in the leaf tissues of
   nonnodulated plants were mimosine and hydroxypipecolic acid (isomer 1).
   Mimosine was recovered in both the neutral plus basic and acidic amino,
   acid fractions. Major differences between amino acid profiles of
   nodulated and nonnodulated roots were the low percentages of asparagine
   + aspartate (3.6\% of the total pool compared to 33\% in nodulated
   plants) and pipecolic acid in nonnodulated roots (1\% of the total
   compared to 12.5\% in nodulated plants). A novel plant betaine
   (dihydroxypipecolic acid betaine) was identified by
   fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry in leaf tissues, albeit at
   relatively low concentrations (< 1 mumol per gram fresh weight).
   Analyses of the xylem sap collected from nodulated plants confirmed that
   Leucaena is an asparagine transporter, as suggested by the high
   concentrations of asparagine and the low concentrations of ureides in
   its root nodules. Amino acid profiles of xylem sap from nonnodulated
   plants showed extremely low concentrations of asparagine + aspartate
   (0.12 mumol ml-1), whereas asparagine + aspartate was the major
   constituent (4.38 mumol ml-1) in the xylem sap of nodulated plants. Two
   nonprotein amino acids, pipecolic acid and hydroxypipecolic acid, were
   major constituents of the xylem sap of nodulated and nonnodulated
   plants, respectively. Three unidentified compounds detected in xylem sap
   samples from both modulated and nonnodulated plants did not correspond
   with any of the peaks characterized from tissue samples.},

   (mobile phase: 0.02M o-phosphoric acid) of enzyme assays determined
   optimal enzyme activity at pH 10.0, 55 degrees C and 200 mM KCl. In
   addition to thermophilic activity, giant leucaena SAM-synthetase remains
   highly active in solutions containing up to 4 M KCl and accepts Na+ to
   some extent as a substitute for K+, a known required cofactor for
   SAM-synthetases. The enzyme followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km =
   1.82 mM, Kcat = 1.17 s- 1, Vmax 243.9 mu M. min-1) and was not inhibited
   by spermidine, spermine or nicotianamine. Giant leucaena SAM-synthetase
   is a highly tolerant enzyme to extreme conditions, suggesting further
   studies on plant SAM-synthetases.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effect of alley cropping of Leucaena
   leucocephala and Faidherbia albida on wood biomass, maize grain yield
   and soil nitrogen status. The treatments were: trees planted alone at 1
   x 5 m spacing; trees intercropped with maize and a sole maize crop.
   Mulch biomass averaged 6.18 and 0.97 t ha(-1) for L. leucocephala and F.
   albida, respectively. Corresponding wood production was 1.71 and 1.11 t
   ha(-1). Both total N and inorganic N (NO3--N plus NH4+-N) were higher
   under F. albida and lowest under L. leucocephala. Similarly, foliar N
   concentration in maize was higher in plots intercropped with F. albida
   and least in L. leucocephala intercropping. Maize grain yield was little
   affected by the tree intercrop as competition for resources was reduced
   through periodic pruning and clean weeding. There was no gain in maize
   grain yield due to the presence of L. leucocephala and F. albida. These
   results suggest that alley cropping in Gario is justified for wood
   production but not for increasing maize grain yield.},

   depressed N fixation by 56\% as was expected from nodule mass data.
   N-fixation was delayed for about 8 weeks in the plots without N.
   Application of small amounts of N starter (20 ppm) proved to be
   beneficial to satisfy the plant need during the early stage of leucaena

   developed and used in this study. It was found that boiling removed
   mimosine from young leaves, pods and seeds of leucaena but it also
   reduced the amount of soluble protein significantly. Soaking in water
   for 24 h eliminated 97\% of mimosine from young leaves, pods and split
   seeds of leucaena, and up to 20\% of mimosine from the whole young seeds
   without significantly reducing the soluble protein content.},

Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {50},
Number = {10},
Pages = {961-975},
Abstract = {A series of fertiliser trials were conducted on leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala subsp. glabrata) pastures growing on a range of soil types
   in south-east and central Queensland. The primary objective was to
   determine the extent of phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) deficiencies in
   leucaena-grass pastures established on either virgin soils or previously
   cropped soils. Two experiments were conducted across nine sites and
   confirmed that, for many soils in Queensland, leucaena growth was
   restricted by P and S nutrient deficiencies, which limited plant growth
   directly and suppressed symbiotic N-2 fixation. The major factors
   contributing to the P and S deficiencies and thus affecting leucaena
   response were: (i) inherent low soil fertility, (ii) nutrient removal by
   cropping and grazing, (iii) shallow soils, (iv) soil acidity, and (v)
   grass competition for available water and nutrients. A secondary
   treatment, inter-row cultivation, had little effect on leucaena growth
   but significantly increased grass growth in some soils. In all these
   experiments, leaf S concentrations and N : S ratios in index tissue were
   inconsistent indicators of adequacy of S. Similarly, leaf P
   concentrations were not useful indicators of P deficiency due to
   inappropriate (drought) leaf sampling conditions experienced in these
   experiments. The experiments demonstrate that the productivity of
   leucaena-grass pastures, especially in older leucaena plantations, will
   be limited by nutrient deficiencies on many soils in Queensland. While
   leucaena yield was suppressed, no foliar symptoms of nutrient deficiency
   were observed. Growers need to monitor the nutrient status of their
   leucaena-grass pastures by leaf tissue analysis using a new sampling
   protocol. Strategic fertiliser application has the potential to increase
   rainfall use efficiency by 50\% with an expected parallel increase in
   cattle liveweight gain.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit is native to tropical
   America. The root system of the species is associated with
   microorganisms that improve nutrition and growth.
   Objective: To evaluate the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)
   collections on the phosphorus (P) content and growth of L. leucocephala
   in the nursery.
   Materials and methods: The seeds were sown and six treatments were
   applied: Rhizophagus intraradices (Schenck \& Sm.) Walker \& Schu ss ler
   (1), the collections ``Caracoles{''} (2), ``Rosario Izapa{''} (3), ``Te
   limon{''} (4) and ``San Rafael{''} (5), fertilization 15N-15P-15K (6)
   and a control. Morphological and physiological variables, root
   colonization and P content were recorded at 120 days. Data were
   subjected to an analysis of variance and Tukey's range test (P = 0.05).
   Results and discussion: AMF improved plant characteristics in comparison
   with the control and fertilization. Rhizophagus intraradices caused the
   highest growth values in the aerial part, mycorrhizal colonization and P
   content, and the lowest growth in the root system. The ``Caracoles{''}
   and `` Rosario Izapa{''} isolates promoted height, root biomass and P
   content higher than ``Te limon{''} and ``San Rafael{''}.
   Conclusion: AMF allow decreasing chemical fertilization without
   detriment to the growth of L. leucocephala.},

Abstract = {We integrated correlative (species distribution) and process-based
   (agent-based) modeling approaches-to predict future range expansion of
   an invasive plant (Leucaena leucocephala) in the lowland rainforest and
   tropical coastal forest ecosystems of the Hengchun peninsula, Taiwan. We
   simulated range expansion to the year 2027 using a spatially-explicit,
   agent-based model representing invasion rate as a function of habitat
   quality and propagule pressure. We developed an index of habitat quality
   by relating 1988 plant distribution data to geo-referenced data on
   climatic conditions, landscape features, and anthropogenic factors via
   logistic regression. We represented propagule pressure using a lognormal
   dispersal kernel. We evaluated model performance by simulating range
   expansion from 1988 to 2007 and comparing simulated distribution
   patterns to those observed in 2007. Results of logistic regression
   indicated that L. leucocephala is more likely to occur in warm, dry
   areas containing a higher percentage of natural landscape (forest or
   grassland), areas adjacent to the forest edge, and areas disturbed by
   human activities such as a main road or an abandoned sisal plantation.
   Model evaluation showed that the prediction performance is excellent
   with AUC > 0.9 and Mantel's r = 0.77. Our results indicated that L.
   leucocephala will continue from the western portion toward the southern
   and central portions of Checheng township, and throughout the southern
   portion of Hengchun and Manjhou townships, with about 2500 ha of new
   area invaded within the next 20 years. Our predictions should allow
   managers to develop proactive management plans for the areas most likely
   to be invaded.},

Abstract = {Leucaena {[}Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] is a perennial weed in
   more than 25 countries, including Australia. Knowledge regarding the
   seed biology of L. leucocephala could help in making weed management
   decisions. Experiments were conducted to study the effect of hot water
   (scarification), alternating temperatures, heat stress, salt stress,
   water stress, and burial depth on seed germination of two populations of
   L. leucocephala collected from Toowoomba and Gatton, Australia. The
   optimum duration of hot water treatment to break the hard seed coat
   dormancy was 2 min for both populations. The highest germination (92\%
   to 98\%) was recorded at 35/25 C for both populations, and similar
   germination occurred at 30/20 C. The Toowoomba population recorded
   greater germination at low temperature (15/5 to 25/15 C) than the Gatton
   population. Additionally, the Gatton population had higher germination
   than the Toowoomba population after 5 min of exposure to temperatures of
   up to 100 C, suggesting that the Gatton population may be more tolerant
   to heat stress. Germination was completely inhibited at pretreatment (5
   min) temperatures of 150 to 250 C. The Toowoomba population recorded
   17\% greater germination than the Gatton population at a high salt
   concentration (160 mM NaCl), indicating its greater salt tolerance. At
   low moisture stress (-0.1 and -0.2 MPa), higher germination was observed
   in the Toowoomba population than in the Gatton population, whereas
   germination was similar for both populations at higher water stress
   levels (-0.4 MPa or lower). Germination was similar for both populations
   at shallow depths (0 and 1 cm) but higher emergence was recorded for the
   Toowoomba population at 2 to 8 cm than the Gatton population.
   Differential germination behaviors of both populations suggest that they
   adapted differently in their respective local environments. Knowledge
   gained from this study will help in formulating integrated management
   practices for L. leucocephala.},

Abstract = {Plants on contaminated mining soils often show a reduced growth due to
   nutrient depletion as well as trace elements (TEs) toxicity. Since those
   conditions threat plant's survival, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria
   (PGPRs), such as rhizobia, might be of crucial importance for plant
   colonization on TE-contaminated soils. Native rhizobia from mining soils
   are promising candidates for bioaugmented phytoremediation of those
   soils as they are adapted to the specific conditions. In this work,
   rhizobia from Zn-and Cd-contaminated mining soils were in vitro screened
   for their PGP features {[}organic acids, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and
   siderophore (SID) production; 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)
   deaminase activity; and Ca-3(PO4)(2) solubilization] and Zn and Cd
   tolerance. In addition, some type and reference rhizobia strains were
   included in the study as well. The in vitro screening indicated that
   rhizobia and other native genera have great potential for
   phytoremediation purposes, by exerting, besides biological N-2 fixation,
   other plant growth-promoting traits. Leucaena leucocephala-Mesorhizobium
   sp. (UFLA 01-765) showed multielement tolerance and an efficient
   symbiosis on contaminated soil, decreasing the activities of
   antioxidative enzymes in shoots. This symbiosis is a promising
   combination for phytostabilization.},

Abstract = {The binding constants for the complexed species formed in aqueous
   solution between galactomannan of Leucaena leucocephala and the metal
   ions Co2+, Mn2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ were determined by potentiometric
   titrations. The calculated values showed Ni2+ as the best Lewis acid
   towards the Lewis base -OH groups of the sugar monomers, with Zn2+ being
   the poorest. For all systems, a higher percentage of the complexed
   species was present near pH=7.0, although complexed species existed over
   a wide range of acidic and basic pH values.
   The isolated solid complexes were studied by TG-DSC thermal analysis and
   by EPR spectroscopy. The thermal profiles obtained showed higher thermal
   resistance to final degradation than the biopolymer alone for the
   complexed species ML having the smallest log K values. The EPR spectra
   confirmed the complexation of the metal ionsvia the Lewis base
   deprotonated hydroxyl groups (-O) and showed that the distances between
   metal ions in the complexed biopolymer structure depend on the nature of
   the metal ion.
   The ability of galactomannans to complex a variety of metal ions in
   their web like structure and the resistance to high temperatures and a
   wide range of pH values of these complexes open new perspectives in
   possible industrial uses whenever these properties are required, such as
   in bioremediation of waste waters and in the application of slow-release

   (CIAT 7984 and CIAT 17223). The statistical design was a ramdomized
   split plot design with three replicates. The results obtained showed a
   higher (P<0.01) mineral content for ecotype CIAT-17223 in both
   fractions. N fertilization did not affect mineral level in the fine
   fraction, but Mg which decreased at 60 Kg N/ha. In the coarse fraction,
   K increased as N fertilization increased while Ca, Mg and Na content
   remained constant. P fertilization increased Mg, Mn and Zn levels in the
   fine fraction. Mineral content was increased (P<0.05) in the fine
   fraction when combining 0 Kg N/ha and 150 Kg P/ha as fertilization
   levels, however for the coarse fraction mineral content was increased
   for the 30 Kg N/ha and 75 Kg P/ha.. For both ecotypes, fine fraction
   presented the highest levels of mineral accumulation. These levels were
   greater than the critical levels recommended for grazing animals.},

Abstract = {The influence of reforestation was evaluated during two season periods
   (February and October) in sites planted with Corymbia citriodora and
   Leucaena-leucocephala through microorganism counts (bacteria, fungi,
   actinomycetes, and nitrite oxidizers) and microbial activity
   (respiratory and urease activities). An Atlantic forest and a bare soil
   site were used as controls. The general trends of the variables in the
   different soils were: Atlantic forest or L. leucocephala > C. citriodora
   > bare soil. The microbial populations in L. leucocephala and C.
   citriodora soils were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that found in
   the bare soil. Similar results were obtained for respiratory and urease
   activities. The microbiological variables of the soil under L.
   leucocephala were comparable or even superior to that found under
   Atlantic forest. An improvement in the microbiological soil variables
   was observed in the soil under C. citriodora when compared to the soil
   without vegetation. These results can be attributed to an increasing
   amount of total organic C of the soils under L. leucocephala and C.
   citriodora in relation to the soil without vegetation. Although most
   results obtained in February presented higher values than in October,
   the sampling period did not have a consistent controlling influence on

Abstract = {The feasibility of integrating Leucaena leucocephala and Calliandra
   calothyrsus into a maize production system for soil productivity
   enhancement was investigated in the sub-humid highlands of central Kenya
   for seven cropping seasons during the period 1993 to 1996. The
   experiment consisted of four hedgerow intercropping and six sole maize
   (Zea mays) crop treatments. In six of these treatments, fresh leaf
   prunings of tree species (L. leucocephala and C. calothyrsus) were
   applied, the prunings being obtained from hedgerows grown in situ
   (intercropped) or ex situ (cut and carry) from other sources. There were
   no significant differences in maize grain yield during the 1993 long and
   short rainy seasons. During the 1994 long rains, although there was an
   attack on maize seedlings by chaffer grubs (Cyclocephala spp.),
   fertilised treatments significantly (p < 0.05) out-yielded all other
   treatments in terms of maize grain yield. The decrease in yield in the
   non-fertiliser plots was attributed to low soil fertility status caused
   by greater nutrient removal than could be replenished via pruning
   applications due to low shrub biomass productivity. During subsequent
   seasons, when fertiliser P (triple superphospate) supplementation was
   carried out in all plots, mean yields averaged over four seasons showed
   that intercropped treatments with L. leucocephala produced higher yields
   than fertilised sole maize treatments without prunings application. C.
   calothyrsus was found to be more competitive than L. leucocephala with
   the maize crop.},

Abstract = {A method for efficient in vitro regeneration of Leucaena leucocephala
   cv. K636 was developed using immature zygotic embryos as the explant.
   Multiple shoot induction was achieved by culturing the explants on
   half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with
   thidiazuron (TDZ) (0.03 to 1.5 mu M). The maximum number of shoots per
   explants was achieved in 0.26 mu M TDZ-supplemented media. TDZ
   concentration significantly influenced the induction of multiple shoots
   as well as the shoot-length. TDZ at 0.35 mu M or higher concentrations
   resulted in abnormal stunted shoots. Full-strength MS media devoid of
   any plant growth regulator were used for shoot elongation. In vitro root
   induction was achieved in half-strength MS media supplemented either
   with 0.54 mu M 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or with 14.76 mu M
   indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) in combination with 0.23 mu M kinetin (Kn).
   Media supplemented with 14.76 mu M IBA in combination with 0.23 mu M Kn
   induced twofold-threefold more roots than media supplemented with 0.54
   mu M NAA. However, the average root length was lower in 14.76 mu M IBA
   in combination with 0.23 mu M Kn than in 0.54 mu M NAA. Regenerated
   plants were maintained under normal condition after hardening. Plants,

Abstract = {A laboratory study was used to compare the food consumption and survival
   of Oncideres pustulata LeConte adults that fed on huisache, Acacia
   farnesiana (L.) Willd., leucaena, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit,
   or both host plants. Longevity and food consumption differed
   significantly only among food plants, and no significant two- or
   three-way interactions were found. Longevity of O. pustulata was
   significantly greater on leucaena (77.6 days) than huisache (35.4 days).
   However, adults fed both host plants survived longer (90.3 days) than
   those that fed on either host plant alone. Total food consumption was
   more than two-fold greater in leucaena alone and leucaena + huisache
   than in huisache alone. However, daily consumption did not differ
   significantly among food regimes. When both huisache and leucaena were
   provided simultaneously, leucaena comprised an average of 67\% of the
   total food consumed. Adult size was positively associated with average
   daily consumption, but not with longevity. Greater survival of O.
   pustulata on leucaena was attributed to better nutritional value and
   greater energy content compared to huisache. The greater longevity of O.
   pustulata fed on both leucaena and huisache probably reflects
   complementarity among amino acids and minerals contained in each host

Abstract = {Corrosion inhibition analysis of Leucaena leucocephala leaves extract

   including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization and scanning electron
   microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). The
   result of FTIR identified both hydroxyl (-OH) and carbonyl (C=O) groups
   indicating the presence of phenolic compounds in the extract whereas the
   analysis obtained from UV-Vis showed a peak absorption spectrum at 268
   nm. The electrochemical analysis indicated an excellent inhibition
   efficiency up to 96.12\% for the immersed mild steel coated with 6\% of
   LLE coating. Furthermore, based on the study of polarization, a drastic
   decrease of corrosion rate at 0.2791 mm/year was observed for the same
   coating as compared to the uncoated substrate, which was 2.3991 mm/year.
   The study also confirmed that LLE acts as a mixed type inhibitor, as
   shown in the polarization curve. The morphological evaluation displayed
   a smooth and homogenous surface with less salt precipitation for 6\% of
   LLE coating as compared to other types of coating affirming it to be the
   optimum concentration for this evaluation study.},

Abstract = {Prediction of invasive species distributions from survey data is widely
   recognized as a significant component of forest management and
   conservation planning. Leucaena leucocephala is the most aggressive
   invasive shrub and tree in the Hengchun peninsula in southern Taiwan. We
   analyzed geo-referenced data to identify potential variables of invasion
   and to predict likelihood of further invasion using boosted regression
   trees. Our results, which classified 92\% of the cells correctly with
   regard to species presence and absence, indicated probability of
   invasion is correlated with climatic conditions (temperature and
   precipitation), landscape features (altitude; slope ratio and aspect;
   percentages of natural or secondary forest, agriculture land, developed
   area, and water bodies; and distances to the nearest forest edge and
   river), and anthropogenic factors (length of forest edge, and distances
   to the nearest road and agriculture land). The most influential
   variables are average annual temperature, altitude, piecipitation, and
   slope. Continued range expansion by L. leucocephala is most likely to
   proceed (1) from the eastern and western portions toward the central
   portion of Hengchun township and (2) throughout the southern and toward
   the eastern portions of Manjhou township. Our model should provide
   useful information to aid forest managers in the development of long
   term monitoring and control strategies for L. leucocephala, in the early
   detection and eradication of newly established invasions, and also a
   framework for the integration and analysis of new presence and absence
   field data as they become available.},

   DM and nutrient yield throughout the year, mainly due to advantages in
   tree size and morphology (higher ramification and proportion of leaves,
   and acceptable branch length). Quality and nutritive value results
   indicated that these Leucaena cultivars have a suitable potential as

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is widely used as raw material for the manufacture
   of paper and packaging material and in biomass based power plants in the
   state of Andhra Pradesh, Southern India. Experiments were conducted to
   study the affect of tree density on the growth, biomass partitioning and
   wood productivity. Six treatments 1 x 1 m, 1.3 x 1.3 m, 3 x 0.75 m, 3 x
   1 m, 5 x 0.8 m and 3 x 2 m corresponding to a tree density of 10,000,
   6666, 4444, 3333, 2500 and 1666 were evaluated with leucaena variety
   K636. At 51 months after planting, spacings significantly influenced
   tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), number of branches and
   biomass partitioning. Wider tree rows resulted in greater tree height
   and diameter growth resulting in higher per plant productivity. At
   harvest, 70\% of trees in 3 x 2 m attained a diameter of more than 7.5
   cm, while 35\% of the trees attained the same DBH in 1 x 1 m spacing.
   Increased spacing levels decreased the relative amount of growth
   allocated to the bole of the tree. Marketable biomass yield was highest
   with 1 x 1 m spacing. Spacing of 3 x 0.75 m produced marketable biomass
   comparable to that of 1 x 1 m and greater proportion of stems with more

Abstract = {Supplementary values of unconventional browse Tephrosia bracteolata (TB)
   and Tephrosia candida (TC) and commonly utilized browse plants
   Gliricidia sepium (GS) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL)) were studied in
   goats grazed on a rangeland in the dry season. Crude protein (g/Kg DM)
   content of TC (19.25) compared favourably to those of GS (19.78) and
   that of LL (19.91) while that of TB was low (14.25). Total cell wall
   content, neutral detergent fibre (NDF, g/Kg DM) was lower in both TB
   (56.03) and TC (59.11) than in GS (61.20) and LL (37.50). Dry matter
   intake (g/d) of TB (87.39) was significantly higher than that of TC
   (76.49) while similar values were recorded in GS (63.81) and LL (63.31).
   Improved daily weight gain (g/d) of 14.88, 17.86, 14.88 and 17.86 were
   obtained when goats were fed TB, TC, GS and LL browse supplements
   responsively compared to the daily gain of 11.90 from the unsuplemented
   goats. The digestibility of CP, NDF and ADF in both TB and TC compared
   favourably to those of GS and LL. The findings from this study have
   shown that Tephrosia bracteolata and Tephrosia candida can be used as
   alternative browse supplement for goats grazing on natural grassland in
   the dry season to achieve improved weight gain. This will translate to a
   reduction in the pressure on the commonly use browse like Gliricidia
   sepium and Leucaena leucocephala.},

Abstract = {Five Karan Swiss crossbred (Sahiwal x Brown Swiss) calves were abruptly
   switched over from a diet of concentrate and maize fodder to ad libitum
   air dried Leucaena leucocephala leaves plus twigs. After 17 days on the
   L. leucocephala diet, 3 of the calves were supplemented with copper
   sulphate (10 mg/kg DM L. leucocephala) for 12 days. Thereafter all the
   calves were taken off the L. leucocephala diet and returned to the
   pre-experimental concentrate and maize fodder diet.
   While on the L. leucocephala diet, the average DM intake/d of L.
   leucocephala declined to 497 g within 3 weeks and all calves lost
   weight. This weight loss was reversed in the 3 calves that received
   copper sulphate, and all calves gained weight when they resumed the
   concentrate and maize fodder diet.
   The toxic effects of L. leucocephala feeding for 24 days were
   characterised by poor growth, emaciation, alopecia, loss of hair from
   the tail switch, ear and eye lesions, ulceration of the mouth region,
   drooling viscid saliva and vomiting of thick green saliva in one of the
   calves. Mean levels of 3,4 dihydroxypyridone (DHP) (mg/100 ml) were
   30.35 +/- 13.52 and 55.57 +/- 13.77 on days 2 and 4 respectively in
   rumen liquor and up to 136.01 +/- 80.18 in urine. The mean ratios of
   mimosine: DHP of 3.14, 0.12 and 0.04 in feed, faces and urine
   respectively revealed extensive degradation of mimosine to DHP in the
   calves fed the L. leucocephala diet and it was concluded the calves were
   unable to tolerate a diet consisting solely of L. leucocephala.},

Abstract = {This work explored the activity of biomass pyrolyzed char on the
   pyrolysis and hydrogasification of Giant Leucaena (Leucaena

   or fast heating pyrolysis at three different temperatures (650, 750, or
   850 degrees C), on carbon conversion and gas product distribution was
   investigated. The presence of external hydrogen (H-2) had a minor effect
   on carbon conversion but a significant influence on the gas product
   distribution. The addition of H-2 without pyrolyzed char favored carbon
   monoxide hydrogenation, followed by water-gas shift reaction and
   resulted in higher levels of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). In
   the presence of pyrolyzed char, the addition of H-2 had a different
   effect on gas composition with an increased CH4 via the carbon-hydrogen
   reaction. Moreover, the slow heating pyrolysis at moderate temperature
   (similar to 750 degrees C) during char preparation provided the most
   reactive char resulting in tar reduction and increase in CH4 production.},

Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can increase the acquisition of
   silicon (Si) and, therefore, alleviate the problems caused by metallic
   toxicity in plants, but this effect remains poorly understood. The
   objective was to evaluate the influence of Si application on the growth
   of Leucaena leucocephala inoculated with AMF (Claroideoglomus
   etunicatum) in a soil contaminated by manganese (Mn). We exposed plants
   to increasing levels of Si (0, 100, 200 and 400 mg kg-1) in the soil for
   90 days. Intermediate levels of Si and AMF inoculation significantly
   increased shoot and root dry mass, the number of sheets, root system
   length and mycorrhizal colonization. The abundance of AMF spores
   decreased linearly with increasing levels of Si applied to the soil,
   suggesting a low correlation with mycorrhizal colonization. In addition
   to the higher Mn contents in the shoots and, mainly, in the roots, the
   combined application of Si and inoculation with AMF significantly
   reduced foliar toxicity by more than 40\%, when compared to the absence
   of Si and AMF inoculation. Our results demonstrated a synergistic effect
   of AMF and Si in improving the growth and tolerance of L. leucocephala

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted in areas of the Institute of Animal Science
   located in San Jose municipality, Havana province to evaluate the effect
   of some agrophysical, biological and productive indicators in two
   systems based on Guinea likoni. Both systems are located in red
   ferralitic soils and had the same exploitation time with the difference
   that the one with leucaena allowed the rehabilitation of guinea. Two
   representative paddocks, in which a trial pit was opened, were chosen in
   each one of them. Two samples were taken in the trial pit at depths from
   0 to 15 cm, from 16 to 30 cm, and more than 30 cm, in which the
   macrostructure and the soil texture were determined. Also, the botanical
   composition, the availability of biomass, the density and the frequency
   of appearance of the species were determined, as well as the macrofauna
   and the biological diversity of the soil fauna. The analysis of the data
   of the agrophysical indicators of the soil was performed according to
   random block design. For the soil mesofauna and the biomass
   availability, a completely randomized design with two replications was
   used. The results showed that in both systems the frequency of
   appearance of guinea grass is of 100\%, the density was higher in the
   system with leucaena (86\%) compared to that with only guinea grass
   (56\%) the botanical composition showed that the area with leucaena has
   greater presence of guinea likoni (95.5\%). The guinea grass rangeland
   has a higher diversity of plant species due to the presence of weeds.
   The system with leucaena had higher biomass production (2.24 t/ha). The
   soil macrostructure did not show significant differences between the
   systems and the particles with more than 5 mm of diameter predominated.
   The sampling depths evidenced significant differences in the size of the
   aggregates, which decreased according to the depth. The soil texture did
   not show differences between the systems and all the soils were
   classified as clayish. The soil fauna diversity was higher in the area
   with leucaena. It is concluded that the use of L. leucocephala seems to
   favour the biomass production, the development of the guinea likoni as
   basic pasture, besides regulating apparently the presence of weeds in
   the rangeland. It does not seem to affect the performance of the soil
   macrostructure and texture. The system with leucaena. had an increase of
   the soil fauna diversity and the total of individuals per surface unit.
   Further studies in time are recommended to monitor the performance of
   these systems.},

Abstract = {Desiccation tolerance (DT) is the ability to tolerate dehydration to
   levels below 0.1 g(H2O) g(-1)(dry mass) and subsequent rehydration
   without lethal damage. Here, it is proposed that Leucaena leucocephala,
   a tree species, has potential to be model tolerant species in seed
   research. Using flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy,
   cytological changes related to loss of DT in Leucaena primary roots were
   followed during germination. Leucaena seeds lost their DT at the end of
   germination and this coincided with an increase in cellular 4C DNA
   content. A negative correlation between the 8C DNA content and the
   capacity of germinating Leucaena seeds to tolerate desiccation was also
   observed. Apparently, the seeds of Leucaena underwent extra cycles of
   endoreduplication and accumulated a high content of DNA - an event not
   previously linked to DT. The ultrastructural damage imposed by drying
   overcame Leucaena primary root cell resilience and their ability to
   resume normal growth. Nuclear DNA content may be used as indicator of
   progress of germination and loss of DT in Leucaena.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to optimize the production of bio-oil from Leucaena
   leucocephala wood using a fluidized bed reactor. Response surface
   methodology was used to optimize the fast pyrolysis through three
   operational parameters: pyrolysis temperature, nitrogen flow rate, and
   temperature of the first condensation stage. The optimum conditions
   obtained for bio-oil production were 500 degrees C, 26.4 L min(-1), that
   is, about 3.3 times the minimum fluidization flow, and 80 degrees C,
   respectively. The bio-oil obtained under optimum conditions was of good
   quality and did not require further treatment. Physical properties of
   the bio-oil were analysed according to ASTM D7544-12. In addition, the
   chemical composition of the non-condensed gases and bio-oil were
   identified using GC-MS. The non-condensed gases were found to contain
   mainly ketones and lignin derivatives, while the bio-oil contained
   cyclic ketones, alcohol ethers, aromatic alcohols, and lignin
   derivatives. The study found that increasing the pyrolysis temperature
   did not significantly increase the yield of H-2 and CO for syngas
   production. Regarding the solid obtained, a large amount of unreacted
   material (66.7 wt.\%) is generated at 400 degrees C, and as the
   temperature is increased, a high-quality biochar is obtained.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Mlanding Tempeh is an Indonesian fermented food made from Lamtoro
   (Leucaena leucocephala), a tropical legume that contains complete
   nutrients. The legume has high productivity and adapts well to dry
   climates thus serving well as a plant-based protein source in arid areas
   to improve the local food security. This is especially true for
   Indonesian male adolescents who often suffer from undernutrition. This
   study aimed to introduce a process to further improve the nutritional
   value and potential acceptance of the Mlanding Tempeh by developing it
   into a snack bar. A complete food process development and nutrient
   analysis were performed. Analysis of anti-nutrient content found a
   reduction of tannins after 24h fermentation of Lamtoro, from 52.11 to
   4.20 (mg. tannic acid). Frying and oven-baked method was chosen for
   processing the Tempeh into the snack bar. Formulation with 60\% Mlanding
   Tempeh, 35\% red kidney beans, and 5\% puffed rice had the highest
   acceptance and preference score. The energy and nutrients such as
   protein, fat, and carbohydrates content in 100 g of snack bars were
   385.44 kcal, 17.62 g, 3.18 g, and 71.58 g, respectively. A 100 g of
   snack bar provided around 29\% of the daily protein and 22.27\% of iron
   needs for male adolescents. Hence, the Mlanding Tempeh snack bar can be
   considered a good source of protein and iron for this demography. In
   addition, it also has high dietary fibre.},

   Gliricidia septum, (gliricidia) and Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena),

   Zebu bulls were fitted with cannula in rumen for the analysis of
   degradability. They were fed ad libitum fresh star grass (Cynodon

   nylon bags with 5 g of sample were incubated in rumen and removed at 8,
   12, 24, 48, and 72 h post fermentation The foliages showed high
   potential of DM rumen degradation, higher than 80 \% in gliricidia and
   than 77 \% in leucaena. The soluble DM fraction, determined by washing
   the bags was of 19 49 and 22.33 \% for both foliages, respectively.
   There was breed x type of foliage interaction (P < 0 05) for the
   fraction potentially degradable in time (B), the rate of degradation
   (c), and the potential DM degradability (A+B) The A+B fraction of
   nitrogen in gliricidia was around 94 \% in buffaloes, whereas in the
   Zebu cattle, it was lower (P < 0 05) in 5 percent units. The results
   indicated that the in situ rumen degradability of the tree foliages is
   not necessarily similar in buffaloes as in cattle. Thus, care should be
   paid when extrapolating results from one species to the other. Both
   plants had high rumen degradability, thus, their use in ruminant feeding

   Following periodic labelling of trenched and untrenched plantation
   quadrats with N-15-enriched ammonium sulfate, analyses of foliar and
   whole-tree (weighted average) N-isotopic ratios and total biomass N were
   used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen derived from biological
   dinitrogen fixation (PNDFA) and total nitrogen derived from fixation
   (TNDFA) in C. equisetifolia and L. leucocephala. The N-15-enrichment
   technique yielded accurate estimates of dinitrogen fixation in maturing
   stands of these two tree species provided the reference species
   (Eucalyptus) was grown in close proximity to the N-fixing species in
   trenched, mixed-species plots. Changes in the N-15/N-14 ratio of
   soil-available nitrogen in single-species plots of the N-fixing and
   reference were found to yield inaccurate estimates of dinitrogen
   fixation in the single-species plots of C. equisetifolia and L.

   that foliar sampling is a useful nondestructive alternative to
   whole-tree biomass sampling for the N-15-enrichment protocol. Between
   1.0 and 3.5 years after plantation establishment, PNDFA in C.

   leucocephala was investigated, in order to use this species for
   revegetation of the area. Caatinga soils from both, natural (control)

   with Glomus etunicatum. The soil from the impacted area was diluted 0,
   25, 50, 75 and 100\% with soil from the control area. In general, the
   increase in the proportion of contaminated soil had a negative effect on
   plant growth. Inoculated plants presented greater height, leaf number

Abstract = {The natural N-15 abundance method was used to trace the sources of N in
   a stand of Leucaena leucocephala and its understorey species. Changes in
   the deltaN-15 of various above-ground parts of the L. leucocephala trees
   and understorey vegetation were monitored for 6 yr. The resulting data
   provide the first direct evidence of internal N cycling between a
   N2-fixing tree and non-N2-fixing understorey species within an
   agro-ecosystem. The deltaN-15 of all tree parts and understorey
   vegetation decreased with time. One year after the plantation was
   established, the non-N2-fixing understorey species exhibited a
   significant enrichment in N-15 relative to the L. leucocephala. At 4 and
   6 yr after planting, however, the deltaN-15 N value of the understorey
   vegetation had decreased significantly and was nearly identical to that
   of the L. leucocephala. The decline in deltaN-15 values of the
   understorey species was attributed to net N-mineralization of plant
   parts shed by L. leucocephala, and to root exudation and decay. That is,
   a portion of the N2 fixed during the early stages of tree growth was
   made available to the understorey species through the decomposition and
   subsequent incorporation into the available soil-N pool of the abscissed
   L. leucocephala parts. This indicates that there was a tight coupling
   between N2 fixation and the availability of net mineralized N. The
   natural N-15 abundance method appears to provide a suitable means by
   which the fate of fixed-N in a forest ecosystem can be monitored,
   provided the difference between the initial deltaN-15 value of the
   N2-fixing and non-N2-fixing (reference) species is of sufficient
   magnitude. The rate of change in the deltaN-15 value of the understorey
   species can provide valuable insights into the intensity of net
   N-mineralization and N-cycling.},

Abstract = {We characterized vine shoots, cotton stalks, Leucaena leucocephala and

   of these two types of raw material.
   The previous raw materials were pulped by using an ethyleneglycol
   concentration of 65\% at 180 degrees C for 75 min, followed by beating
   at 1500 revolutions in a PFI refiner. The paper sheets obtained were

   was used with three replications per treatment. Bags were incubated in
   the rumen during 6.81, 12.24.48 and 72 h. The effet of the PEG level oil
   the in vitro intestinal digestibility of nitrogen was determined. There
   were differences (P < 0.01) in the CT-F content. according to the PEG
   level, while the CT-P did not respond to the treatment with
   polyethyleneglycol, There were differences (P < 0.05) between the
   control and the treatment with 90 g in crude protein degradability
   (CPD). The degradability of DM, NDF and ADF varied more (P < 0.01) per
   treatment, independently of the constants of ruminal re-change (k). The
   dvnamics of ruminal degradation had a significant increase, ill regards
   to the incubation time established. This provoked the formation of
   asymptotes between the curves of each indicator in the last hours. There
   were significant differences between the control and the PEG
   concentrations in the in vitro intestinal digestibility of the
   nitrogen., although there were no differences between both treatments.
   Coefficients of determination R-2 > 0.64 were obtained in the linear
   regression equations for the ED of the NDF, ADF and TC-F, according to

Abstract = {The introduction of mimosine detoxifying microbes to the rumens of
   African livestock eliminates the need to restrict the levels of Leucaena
   leucocephala in their diet to avoid mimosine toxicity. The performance
   of weaned Beer goats, which were inoculated with mimosine-detoxifying
   microbes, browsing stands of both L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham and
   var. Spectra was studied over 2 seasons. Goats were stocked at 8.6, 15
   and 20 goats/ha for 120 days in 1994-95, and 11.5, 15, and 20 goats/ha
   for 140 days in 1995-96. No obvious signs of mimosine toxicity were
   visible during the trial. Weight gains were positive, except during the
   period immediately after the goats were introduced to the trial in 1994
   and after short periods off the trial in the mid-summer of both seasons,
   necessitated by drought- and hail-induced defoliation of the leucaena
   trees. The mean individual animal performance over both years and
   leucaena types was 87+/-6.4 g/d, with gains approaching 200 g/d at
   times. There were no differences (P>0.05) in gain per animal between
   leucaena types or stocking rates. Therefore, gain per hectare increased
   with increasing stocking rate, resulting in a significantly (P<0.05)
   greater gain per hectare at the high stocking rate than at the lowest
   rate in both seasons, for both leucaena types. In total, over the whole
   experimental period, the high stocking rate treatment produced 82 kg/ha
   more live mass than the low stocking rate treatment in 1994-95 (over 98
   days) and 85 kg/ha more live mass in 1995-96 (over 126 days). The
   productivity of Beer goats browsing leucaena could possibly be improved
   by providing a mineral supplement and a high energy base fodder (e.g.
   grass), as leucaena foliage is inherently low in phosphorus, sodium and
   digestible energy.},

Abstract = {Leticaena leitcocephala is the most productive and versatile
   multi-purpose legume tree in tropical agriculture and has several uses,
   thus called `miracle tree'. It is a popular choice for intercropping
   with annuals in hedgerow or alley cropping systems. Its allelopathic
   effects oil cereals, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, fodder crops, weeds,
   trees etc. have been reviewed in this paper. The foliage and pods of
   Leucaena contain the toxic amino acid mimosine
   {[}beta-N-(3-hydroxy-4-pyridone)-alpha-aminopropionic acid] and many
   other phytotoxic compounds. The toxic effects of mimosine oil plants and
   physiology of its action have been discussed. The future areas
   identified for research in Leucaena are: (a) studies on its allelopathic
   compatibility with different crops to identify sustainable agroforestry
   systems (b) investigations to overcome its adverse allelopathic effects
   and mimosine toxicity and (c) possibility of using the allelopathic

   wall layers in TW fibres. TW further contained less lignin that also had
   a lower syringyl-to-guaiacyl ratio. The lignin was also more condensed.
   The content of alpha-cellulose was high in TW. TW contains
   hemicelluloses and pectins composed of more galactose, and less xylose,
   mannose, 4-O-methylglucuronic acid and galacturonic acid compared to

   Stomatal density varied from 144 mm-2 in plants grown in high PPFD to 84

   Leaf area was largest when plants were grown under the intermediate

Abstract = {The legume Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) is widely used to supplement
   forage in silvopastoral livestock systems in Latin America. Little is
   known about its possible effects on the cow reproductive dynamic. The
   aim was to evaluate the effect of Leucaena foliage intake on
   re-establishment of ovarian activity and estrus behavior in early
   postpartum (7-90 days) cows. Twenty-four multiparous Bos taurus x Bos
   indicus cows were divided into two homogenous groups and assigned to one
   of two treatments: a silvopastoral system (SS, n = 12), consisting of an
   association of Cynodon nlemfuensis grass and L. leucocephala; and a
   control system (CS, n = 12), consisting of C. nlemfuensis alone. Intake
   of Leucaena in the SS ranged from 3.80 to 6.43 kg DM/cow/day. Plasma
   mimosine concentrations ranged from 1270 to 1530 mu g/mL, and those for
   2,3-dihydroxypyridine (DHP) from 147 to 729 mu g/mL. No 3,4-DHP was
   detected in plasma. No difference (P > 0.05) between treatments was
   observed for the number of cows exhibiting small, medium, or dominant
   follicles, or estrus behavior. The number of cows which re-established
   ovarian cyclicity (n = 6) was lower (P < 0.05) in the SS than in the CS
   (n = 9). Corpus luteum lifespan was longer (P < 0.05) in the SS than in
   the CS. Intake of Leucaena affected the number of cows exhibiting
   ovarian cyclicity and extended corpus luteum life, but did not affect
   follicular development and estrus behavior.},

Abstract = {In 1977 a fallow improvement program was initiated in Occidental
   Mindoro, Philippines using Leucaena leucocephala to shorten the fallow
   period in local shifting cultivation practices. Evaluation of the
   programme in 1989 suggests that the practice of planting leucaena as a
   fallow improvement crop has been adapted and widely adopted by farmers.
   Farmers using leucaena have successfully shortened fallow periods from
   over 6-8 years to 2-4 years with no reported reduction in crop yields.
   The leucaena psyllid has had little or no effect on farmer acceptance
   and use of the system. Soil properties under burned and unburned
   leucaena and natural bush fallows were analyzed. Exchangeable calcium
   was significantly lower at 50 cm soil depth under the natural bush
   fallow. Soil pH in the 0-10 cm horizon was significantly higher under
   the bush fallow, suggesting that Ca extraction and deposition at the
   soil surface was greater under the natural bush fallow. No significant
   difference between natural and leucaena fallows were found for other
   soil properties. Surface soils of burned leucaena fallows were
   significantly lower in organic mattern and Mg than unburned fallows.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {164},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The tree legume Leucaena leucocephala contains a large amount of a toxic
   nonprotein aromatic amino acid, mimosine, and also an enzyme,
   mimosinase, for mimosine degradation. In this study, we isolated a
   1,520-bp complementary DNA (cDNA) for mimosinase from L. leucocephala
   and characterized the encoded enzyme for mimosine-degrading activity.
   The deduced amino acid sequence of the coding region of the cDNA was
   predicted to have a chloroplast transit peptide. The nucleotide
   sequence, excluding the sequence for the chloroplast transit peptide,
   was codon optimized and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified
   recombinant enzyme was used in mimosine degradation assays, and the
   chromatogram of the major product was found to be identical to that of
   3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (3H4P), which was further verified by electrospray
   ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. The enzyme activity requires
   pyridoxal 5'-phosphate but not alpha-keto acid; therefore, the enzyme is
   not an aminotransferase. In addition to 3H4P, we also identified
   pyruvate and ammonia as other degradation products. The dependence of
   the enzyme on pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and the production of 3H4P with the
   release of ammonia indicate that it is a carbon-nitrogen lyase. It was
   found to be highly efficient and specific in catalyzing mimosine
   degradation, with apparent K-m and V-max values of 1.16 x 10 (4) M and
   5.05 x 10 (5) mol s (1) mg (1), respectively. The presence of other
   aromatic amino acids, including L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, and
   L-tryptophan, in the reaction did not show any competitive inhibition.
   The isolation of the mimosinase cDNA and the biochemical
   characterization of the recombinant enzyme will be useful in developing
   transgenic L. leucocephala with reduced mimosine content in the future.},

   were randomly divided into 2 groups of 3 animals each, viz., control
   (I-0) and iodine supplemented (I-100) The animals were fed on a
   concentrate supplement along with leucaena leaf-meal (LLM), the latter
   to meet 50\% of their CP requirements. Wheat straw was given ad lib. In
   addition, animals under group I-100 received 100 mug of supplemental
   iodine/head/day. Semen was collected and analysed at monthly intervals
   during the 3 months of experimental feeding. Plasma samples were
   analysed for testosterone at the begining and end of the experiment. The
   results revealed that animals under I-100) group maintained their libido
   throughout the experimental period in contrast to a progressive decline
   observed in the I-0 group. The concentration of spermatozoa (3.25+/-0.39
   vs 2.74+/-0.24 billion ml(-1)) and per cent live spermatozoa
   (76.67+/-1.82 vs 66.17+/-2.00) were significantly (P<0.01) higher in
   iodine supplemented than the non-supplemented bucks (I-100). Other semen
   characteristics, viz. semen volume, pH, number of spermatozoa per
   ejaculate and mass activity although similar (P>0.05), tended to be
   higher in group. The initial fructose content, similarly, tended to be
   higher in I-100. than 10 animals. Mean plasma testosterone level was
   significantly (P<0.05) higher in I-100 than I-0 (1.78+/-0.21 vs:
   1.14+/-0.46 ng ml(-1)). The study indicated that supplementation of
   iodine to leucaena based diet can improve the male reproductive
   performance of goats.},

Abstract = {Metal corrosion poses a substantial economic challenge in a
   technologically advanced world. In this study, novel environmentally
   friendly anticorrosive graphene oxide (GO)-doped organic-inorganic
   hybrid polyurethane (LFAOIH@GO-PU) nanocomposite coatings were developed
   from Leucaena leucocephala oil (LLO). The formulation was produced by
   the amidation reaction of LLO to form diol fatty amide followed by the
   reaction of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and a dispersion of GO(x) (X =
   0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 wt\%) along with the reaction of isophorane
   diisocyanate (IPDI) (25-40 wt\%) to form LFAOIH@GO(x)-PU35
   nanocomposites. The synthesized materials were characterized by Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); H-1, C-13, and Si-29 nuclear
   magnetic resonance; and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A detailed
   examination of LFAOIH@GO(0.5)-PU35 morphology was conducted using X-ray
   diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. These studies
   revealed distinctive surface roughness features along with a contact
   angle of around 88 G.U preserving their structural integrity at
   temperatures of up to 235 C-degrees with minimal loading of GO.
   Additionally, improved mechanical properties, including scratch hardness
   (3 kg), pencil hardness (5H), impact resistance, bending, gloss value
   (79), crosshatch adhesion, and thickness were evaluated with the
   dispersion of GO. Electrochemical corrosion studies, involving Nyquist,
   Bode, and Tafel plots, provided clear evidence of the outstanding
   anticorrosion performance of the coatings.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (LL), a legume tree native to Mexico,
   are traditionally harvested and utilized as food ingredients in regional
   dishes. In this study, the usefulness of LL biomass was investigated and
   processed in flours using the wholegrain seed (WS) and pods for
   polyphenols identification, whereas the cotyledon (CT) for protein
   concentrates functional characterization was used. The WS flour
   exhibited carbohydrates as the main macronutrient, followed by proteins
   (30.59\%). Water-extracted polyphenols from pods flour (544.29 mg/L)
   were higher compared to the WS flour (165.85 mg/L). The predominant
   polyphenols in all samples were flavonols, specifically catechins.
   Although, in comparison to the mixtures of methanol-water (315.14 mg/L)
   and ethanol-water (471.22 mg/L), pods had about threefold polyphenols
   content than WS flours extracts. Protein fractionation in CT was higher
   than in WS flour, with globulins being the most abundant fraction in
   both materials (44.73 and 55.2\%, respectively). Structural analyzes
   indicated a higher presence of structural elements in globulins, evident
   in FTIR spectra and SDS-PAGE analysis. Globulins displayed bands around
   50, 37, and 22 kDa, while glutelins exhibited a unique band at 50 kDa.
   Globulins also demonstrated a higher essential amino acid content. The
   functional properties of globulins and glutelins were pH-dependent.
   Globulins solubility (72.53\%), emulsifying (35.13\%), foaming
   (138.66\%), water holding (3.17 g/g), and oil absorption (1.20 g/g)
   capacities were higher compared to glutelins (62.42\%, 31.69\%, 66.70\%,
   2.86 g/g, and 0.52 g/g, respectively). These findings suggest that LL
   biomass holds potential as a sustainable source of natural ingredients
   for food development.},

Title = {Increasing the proportion of Leucaena leucocephala in hay-fed beef
   steers reduces methane yield},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {62},
Number = {7},
Pages = {622-632},
Abstract = {Context Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a leguminous shrub adapted
   to higher rainfall (>600 mm) in frost-free areas of Australia. It can be
   a source of high-quality forage for cattle grazing tropical grass-based
   pastures that are seasonally deficient in the nitrogen content required
   for adequate levels of performance. Leucaena contains bioactive
   compounds that may reduce methanogenesis in the rumen, helping to
   achieve Australia's goal to make red meat production carbon neutral by
   2030. Aim A study was undertaken to evaluate the response in animal
   performance and methane production to increasing percentages of leucaena
   in a hay-based diet. Methods Growing steers were fed diets containing
   0\%, 18\%, 36\% and 48\% leucaena. Intake, liveweight gain, methane
   production and yield were measured in a cross-over trial with two modern
   cultivars of leucaena (Redlands and Wondergraze). Methane was measured
   in open-circuit respiration chambers. Key results There were no effects
   of cultivar on most parameters. Increasing leucaena percentage in the
   diet increased dry matter intake, animal performance and methane
   production (g/day) but reduced methane yield (g/kg dry matter intake)
   according to the equation: methane yield = 19.8 - 0.09 x leucaena
   percentage in the diet. The inclusion of polyethylene glycol to nullify
   potential antimethanogenic activity of tannins restored methane yield by
   67\%, indicating that tannins were responsible for most of the observed
   reduction in methane yield. Conclusion The results demonstrate that
   leucaena can improve animal performance and reduce methane yield in
   steers fed low-quality grasses. Implications Leucaena can be included in
   diets of grazing cattle in areas agronomically suited to its production,
   as a means to reduce enteric methane emissions.},

   classifications using high spatial resolution aerial photographs or
   Formosat-2 satellite images (Center for Space and Remote Sensing
   Research, Taiwan). Dynamics of LELE by referring to 19881997 LELE
   spatial distributions were ingested into a logistic model to build
   transition rules for CA simulation. The results showed that the enhanced
   CA model can precisely (95\% overall accuracy by comparing with the 2007
   LELE distribution) model the population expansion of LELE. This study
   highlights the strength of this spatially explicit predictive model, and

Abstract = {Twenty Katahdin x Pelibuey crossbreed male lambs, 3 to 4 months of age
   and 24 +/- 0.3 kg of body weight, were used to study the anthelmintic
   effects of administering extracts of Salix babylonica L. (SB) and
   Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (LL). Lambs had not been treated with
   anthelmintics previously and were randomly allocated into four groups of
   five lambs each in a completely randomized design. Treatments were as
   follows: control (lambs fed on total mixed ration without extracts), SB
   (as control plus S. babylonica L. extract at 30 ml/day), LL (as control
   plus L. leucocephala Lam. extract at 30 ml/day), and SBLL (as control
   plus 30 ml/day of S. babylonica L. and L. leucocephala Lam. extracts in
   a 1:1 (v/v) mixture) for 63 days. Extracts were orally administered
   before the 8:00 a.m. feeding to each lamb. Rectal fecal samples were
   collected from each lamb at day 22 (P1), day 43 (P2), and day 63 (P3) of
   the experiment. Adult worm and egg counts were determined in each fecal
   sample immediately after collection. Plant secondary metabolites of
   total phenolics, saponins, and the aqueous fraction were 50 \% lower in
   the SB versus LL extracts. Overall, the oral administration of extracts
   has improved the egg and worm count reductions in lamb feces by 54, 47,
   and 40 \% for LL, SB, and SBLL, respectively, versus the control lambs.
   Reductions of worm egg counts in lamb feces were higher (P < 0.05) in P2
   and P3 versus P1. Extracts of SB and LL or possibly isolated bioactive
   compounds could be a promising alternative to conventional anthelmintics
   to treat gastrointestinal parasites of small ruminants. Such treatments
   could be used in control strategies against gastrointestinal nematodes

Abstract = {The present study describes the role of zinc oxide nanoparticles
   (ZnONPs) in reversing oxidative stress symptoms induced by heavy metal
   (Cd and Pb) exposure in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Seedling
   growth was significantly enhanced with the augmentation of ZnONPs
   following Cd and Pb exposure. Heavy metal accumulations were recorded as
   1253.1 mg Cd per kg DW and 1026.8 mg Pb per kg DW for the respective
   treatments. Results demonstrated that ZnONPs augmentation caused an
   increase in photosynthetic pigment and total soluble protein contents
   while a significant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA-lipid peroxidation)
   content in leaves. Antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase
   (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX) were, in turn, elevated in
   heavy metal-exposed leaves amended with ZnONPs. The ameliorating effect
   of ZnO nanoparticles on oxidative stress induced toxicity was also
   confirmed by the reduced MDA content and the elevated level of
   antioxidative enzyme activities in leaf tissues of L. leucocephala
   seedlings. Further, addition of ZnONPs in combination with Cd and Pb
   metals induced distinct genomic alterations such as presence of new DNA
   bands and/or absence of normal bands in the RAPD pattern of the exposed
   plants. This study uniquely suggests a potential role of zinc oxide
   nanoparticles in the remediation of heavy metal contaminated media. (C)

Abstract = {Twelve indigenous male goats, comprising of six intact and six castrated
   (2.5-3 years; 24.4 +/-0.62 kg) were assigned evenly into two dietary
   treatments, viz. I-0 and I-100 and were used to study the effect of
   supplementation of iodine on the nutrient utilization when their diet
   contained Leucaena leaf meal. They were offered a conventional
   concentrate mixture along with Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal, the
   latter to meet 50\% of their crude protein (CP) requirements, and
   supplemented with either no iodine (I-0) or 0.1 mg of iodine
   (I-100)/day/animal as potassium iodide for a period of 105 days. Wheat
   straw given ad libitum was the sole source of roughage. A metabolism
   trial of 8 days duration was conducted after 90 days of experimental
   feeding. It was observed that the overall dry matter (DM) intake during
   experimental period was higher (p<0.05) in I-100 group as compared to
   I-0 group (508.6 vs. 443.78 d(-1)). The intake of CP, digestible crude
   protein (DCP) and metabolisable energy (ME), although non-significant,
   tended to be higher in the iodine supplemented group, I-100.
   Digestibility of dry matter, organic matter (OM), CP, ether extract and
   crude fiber (CF) did not differ (p>0.05) between the treatments.
   However, nitrogen retention was higher (p<0.01) in I-100 than I-0 with
   the values being 2.63 and 1.70 g d(-1), respectively. No difference
   (p>0.05) was evident in the retention of calcium and phosphorus between
   the two groups. The castrated animal exhibited lower DM intake
   concurrent with higher digestibilty of DM and crude fibre (p<0.05), and
   organic matter and total carbohydrates (p<0.01) when compared to intact
   ones. It was concluded that supplementation of iodine to leucaena based

Abstract = {The adsorption method is widely used in water and wastewater treatment;
   however, most industrial adsorbents are expensive, limiting the use of
   the adsorption method in developing countries. Therefore, this study
   aims at developing a biosorbent from the wasted Leucaena leucocephala
   seed pods (LLSP) and apply it (as a cost-effective bio-adsorbent) to
   remove Janus Green B dye (JGBD) from solutions at different values of
   pH, agitation time, LLSP dose and JGBD concentration. Different
   techniques were used to characterize LLSP before and after JGBD removal,
   including pore size distribution, surface area (S-BET) analysis, FTIR,
   SEM, SPM and the point of zero charges (pH(pzc)) of the LLSP surface.
   The results proved that LLSP could remove up to 95\% of JGBD at pH, LLSP
   dose, JGBD concentration and agitation time of 9, 0.08 g/100 ml, 50 mg/l
   and 30 min, respectively. Langmuir and Freundlich were applied to fit
   the data of equilibrium biosorption, and it was noticed that the

   recommended dose alone. The grain yield of maize at recommended dose of
   fertilizer alone was on a par with that of 75\% N with green-manuring
   during the 3 years. The pod yield of groundnut differed significantly
   only during 1991-92. The pod yield at 50\% recommended dose of
   fertilizer with green-manuring was on a par with that of recommended
   dose of fertilizer alone. On an average, organic nitrogen added from
   subabul to different treatments ranged from 35.01 kg to 41.37 kg/ha.},

Abstract = {(Germination performance of the invader Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit. compared to Caesalpinia ferrea Mart. ex Tul. and C. pulcherrima
   (L.) Sw. (Fabaceae)). Success in establishing and colonizing new areas
   is directly related to germination behaviour of seeds under local
   environmental conditions. This work aimed to compare germination
   performance of the exotic invader Leucaena leucocephala to two legumes
   (Caesalpinia ferrea, native, and C. pulcherrima, exotic) which are not
   considered invasive. Non-scarified seeds were exposed to constant
   temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30,35 and 40 degrees C, within a photoperiod
   of 12 hours, for 100 days. Both final germination percentage and
   germination speed showed significant differences among the three
   species. C. ferrea had low germination percentage, with optimal
   germination temperature at 25 degrees C, reaching germination percentage
   of 59\% and germination speed of 0.68 seeds d(-1). In contrast, C.
   pulcherrima had high germination percentages at all temperatures tested,
   with highest germinability from 20 to 40 degrees C. Seeds of L.
   leucocephala had the lowest germination percentage and optimal
   germination temperature was 35 degrees C. The germination performance of
   this exotic is not outstanding, and factors such as propagule pressure,
   natural scarification and good performance in other life stages must
   contribute to its invasiveness.},

Abstract = {Two in vitro assays were accomplished to assess whether low or high
   mimosine naturally found in leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), contribute
   to methane (CH4) suppression. The first assay aimed to detect the
   effects of leucaena samples containing low or high mimosine levels on
   tannin bioactivity and ruminal CH4 production. Samples containing 43.9
   1.9 g condensed tannin (CT)/kg DM were divided into two groups based on
   their mimosine contents (n = 4/group): low (2.3 +/- 0.1) and high (11.1
   +/- 1.5) g mimosine/kg DM. Leucaena incubations were made with or
   without polyethylene glycol (PEG). In the second assay, two leucaena
   samples similar in CT content and chemical composition were selected
   from the first assay to examine the effect of level of mimosine
   naturally found in leucaena, as well as the direct effect of mimosine
   when added to Tifton (Tifton 85; Cynodon dactylon (L) and lucerne
   (Medicago sativa L) hays on ruminal fermentation and nutrient
   degradation. The results of the first assay showed that leucaena
   containing low mimosine with or without PEG decreased (P<0.01) gas
   production (GP), but presented higher values of the percent increase in
   gas (P=0.03) and CH4 (P < 0.01) production after PEG addition compared
   to leucaena containing high mimosine. The addition of PEG in the second
   in vitro assay enhanced GP (P=0.007) and CH4 (P<0.05) by both types of
   leucaena, while decreased (P=0.01) propionate, and increased (P=0.003)
   C2/C3 and NH3 -N (P = 0.02) concentrations by leucaena containing low
   mimosine compared with PEG non-supplemented leucaena. However, such an
   effect did not occur by leucaena containing high mimosine. L-mimosine
   recorded 27\% (P = 0.02) and 10\% (P=0.08) CH4 reduction when
   supplemented at a high level with Tifton and lucerne, respectively,
   while enhanced (P < 0.05) the true degradability of organic matter
   (TDOM), acetate and NH3 N, compared with zero mimosine supplementation.
   Forages without any supplementation also affected the ruminal
   fermentation; similar reduction (P < 0.05) of CH4 production was found
   for both leucaena samples compared to Tifton and lucerne.Leucaena
   containing high mimosine enhanced TDOM (P < 0.01), acetate (P = 0.01)
   and NH3 -N (P = 0.05). These results indicated that leucaena containing
   high mimosine modulated ruminal fermentation in a different way than did
   the leucaena containing low mimosine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is high-nutrient legume due to its crude protein
   rate (20-30\%). Unfortunately, its utilization needs to be restricted
   due to the presence of mimosine, a compound that exhibits negative
   effects on livestocks. This study aimed to compare the performance of
   adult male rabbits after given commercial feed supplemented with
   water-soaked and air-dried Leucaenaleaf meal (WSADL) with those given
   air-dried Leucaena leaf meal (ADL).Fifty local male rabbits, 6 months
   old and weighing around 2.0-2.3 kg, were used as samples. This study
   used a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with five treatment groups
   (n=10),consisting of one control group that were fed commercial feed
   (RO), three groups that were fed WSADL (15\%, 22.5\%, and 30\%) and one
   group that was fed 15\% of ADL. Those rabbits were fed for 60 days. The
   independent variables being observed were the dry matter intake, daily
   weight gain, and feed conversion ratio (FCR). The result showed that the
   supplementation of Leucaena leaf meal which was processed through
   water-soaking and air-dried as much as 30\% on rabbit feed did not
   reduce the dry matter intake, while it increased body weight gain and
   efficiency of feed usage.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is an invasive exotic tree plant, and because of
   these characteristics, it becomes an environmental problem. In this
   sense, the main objective of the present study was to evaluate the
   adsorption capacity of 5G blue dye, using dry L. leucocephala leaves
   under different temperatures. Drying kinetic, centesimal composition and
   micrographs after drying of the leaves were also evaluated. For drying,
   the Valcan model best described the process kinetics, presenting a
   correlation coefficient of 99.4\% and an average error of 1.41\%. For
   the centesimal composition, 3.9\% of moisture, 7.5\% of ash, 23.8\% of
   crude protein, 29.5\% of crude fiber, 3.9\% of ethereal stratum and
   31.4\% of soluble carbohydrate were obtained. In the evaluation of the
   adsorptive capacity, the temperature of 40 degrees C was the one that
   produced the largest adsorbed amount of dye mass/leaf mass, 9.4 mg
   g(-1). The qualitative results obtained agreed with the one observed in
   the micrographs, so that the leaves of L. leucocephala have, therefore,
   industrial application with biosorbent.},

   P, P utilization rate (PUR) and P utilization efficiency (PUE) of
   vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) and nonmyocorrhizal Leucaena
   leucocephala. Total P content, root length and total dry-matter yield of
   mycorrhizal plants were significantly higher than those of
   nonmycorrhizal plants beginning on 15, 25 and 25 days after planting,
   respectively. The  length of root colonized by Glomus aggregatum
   increased exponentially with time and leveled off 30 days after
   planting. In mycorrhizal plants, RGR of roots (based on total root
   length) was lower than those of RGR of infected roots till 30 days after
   planting, after which time the trend was reversed. Although, RGR based
   on dry-matter yield was higher in mycorrhizal plants than in
   nonmycorrhizal plants, the differences observed were not statistically
   significant. SAR of P was higher in  mycorrhizal plants than in

   contents and concentrations in mycorrhizal plants were higher than
   nonmycorrhizal plants, PUR and PUE were higher in nonmycorrhizal plants.
   These results indicate that, although VAM plants were very efficient in
   P absorption and accumulation, they were not superior to non-VAM plants
   in P utilization. However, plant species forming effective symbiosis
   with VAM fungi are likely to be successful  competitors of nutrient-poor

Abstract = {Rice straw is the predominant dry season feed for cattle, despite its
   low nutritive value. It is deficient in readily fermentable energy,
   nitrogen, minerals and vitamins, and cannot provide for optimum
   microbial growth in the rumen or tissue development of the host.
   Sacharomyces cerevisiae has been used to improve the nutritive value and
   utilization efficiency of low-quality roughages. Leucaena leucocephala
   characterized by its high digestibility and good bypass protein content,
   has great possibilities for use in animal feeding, both for ruminants
   and for monogastrics. The aim of this experiment was to study the effect
   of adding S. cerevisiae and leaf of L. leucocephala in diet rice
   straw-based of nutrients digestibility and body weight gain of cattle.
   The experiment was conducted in Ruminant Nutrition Laboratory of the
   Faculty of Animal Science Andalas University, Padang. Experimental
   design used is a Latin Square Design (LSD) with four treatments and four
   periods. This experiment used 175. +/- 10.53 kg male ongole crossbreed.
   The treatments were (A) grass + concentrates, (B) rice straw +
   concentrates, (C) was the treatment of B plus 0.5\% S. cerevisiae and
   (D) was the treatment C + 15\% L.leucocephala. The results showed that
   the dry matter digestibility of treatment B (61.03\%) were significantly
   lower than treatments A, C and D respectively (68.05, 63.01 and 68.15\%)
   and supplementation of S. cerevisiae was able to improve nutrient
   digestibility and body weight gain of cattle, but still low compared to
   control (A). Addition of L. leucocephala in treatment D (850.7 g / day)
   was able to provide digestibility and body weight gain similar to the
   control ration (775.7 g / day). It can be concluded that the use of rice
   straw as a substitute for grass would give the same results with the
   grass when added 0.5\% S. cerevisiae and 15\% L. leucocephala.},

Abstract = {A survey of the productivity and nutritional status of leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata) pastures of different ages was
   conducted in subtropical Queensland from 2006 to 2008. Four leucaena
   stands (aged 8, 20, 31 and 38 years) growing on the same Vertosol soil
   type at Brian Pastures Research Station were surveyed. In the higher
   rainfall season of 2007-2008, leucaena yields and rainfall-use
   efficiency were highest in 8-year-old stands {[}2128 kg total dry matter
   (DM)/ha or 4.0 kg DM/ha.mm] and lowest in 38-year-old stands (978 kg
   total DM/ha or 1.9 kg DM/ha.mm). The reduced productivity in the
   38-year-old leucaena pasture was associated with a decline in stem
   number/plant and leucaena plant density due to observed plant mortality.
   The reduced yield and vigour of aging leucaena was associated with
   nitrogen deficiency related to declining phosphorus and sulfur
   availability for adequate symbiotic N-2 fixation and leucaena plant
   growth. Nutrient deficiencies of phosphorus and sulfur in leaf tissue
   were related to low to medium initial soil fertility (7-27 mg/kg of
   bicarbonate extractable phosphorus in the top 20 cm), coupled with
   inherent subsoil constraints (shallow soils, sodicity and high pH), and
   exacerbated by both long-term removal of nutrients by grazing animals
   and a reduction in soil phosphorus and sulfur availability over time. To
   maintain the productivity of leucaena pastures, plant nutritional status
   needs to be monitored in order to determine strategic fertiliser
   application.},

Abstract = {Heavy metals are discharged to water and soils, creating a severe
   contamination which endangers the biota and man. Actions to preserve
   natural resources and rehabilitate soils are necessary. Microorganisms
   may have a tolerance to different metal concentrations. This enhances
   selection of resistant species, such as those like mycorrhizic fungi,
   Rhizobium and actinomicetes. The mechanisms of microorganisms that cause
   the immobilization of metals are complex. The bacterial reduction of
   sulfate to sulfur tends to immobilize metals like copper, cadmium, lead,
   chromium and mercury by changing them to sulphur compounds. There is a
   leguminous plant, L. leucocephala, from the south of Mexico and
   Guatemala that grows in a wide diversity of soils. This plant is capable
   of surviving frosts. The effects of double innoculation with Rhizobium
   and endomycorhiza in a Leucaena leucocephala host were studied. In this
   study the results obtained showed that the initial amount of Cr and Cu
   added to the soil in the pot decreased sharply. This tendency was
   similar at both concentrations evaluated (20 and 200 ppm). This means
   that the plant absorption for both metals was similar either at 20 or
   200 ppm. The pots were watered with a little excess, and thus there was
   possibly a lixiviation of the metals. However this was rather small, so
   the decrease of the metals in the soil could be attributed mainly to the
   plant uptake. In this case mycorrhizal fungi Glomus sp. Zac 19 and
   Glomus intraradix helped to partially alleviate Cr and Cu toxicity as
   indicated by greater plant growth. A considerable Cr and Cu accumulation
   was shown in non-colonized plants with 200 ppm. Mycorrhizal
   colonization, arbuscular, vesicles, and total colonization percentage
   were affected more by high doses of Cr and Cu; 200 ppm reduced the
   vegetative growth and negatively affected essential elements (N, P, K)
   in the aerial part. The results will help to design strategies for using
   Leucaena leucocephala associated with arbuscular endomycorrhiza and
   Rhizobium in bioremediation of Cr and Cu accumulation.},

Abstract = {A field study was conducted to investigate the effect of water deficit
   on the morphology, productivity, and quality of Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) De Wit. Five main irrigation levels were applied based on actual
   evapotranspiration (AET): 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, and 1.25 of the AET.
   Plant height, number of leaves and branches, and root length and
   diameter were measured. Fresh and dry weights were recorded at harvest,
   and crude protein was analyzed in leaves and roots. The results showed
   that morphological and yield characteristics were affected by the amount
   of water applied. The number of leaves remaining at the end of 21 weeks
   of growth was 65, 84, 93, 87 and 102 at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, and 1.25
   AET. Root length and diameter increased with increasing irrigation. The
   greatest root length (66.5 cm) at 1.00 AET did not differ significantly
   from that at 1.25 AET (58.8 cm). The dry yield at 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00
   AET showed an increased trend per plant in each treatment. Similarly,
   leaf crude protein showed a trend of increase with increasing irrigation
   although values were not significantly different between the levels of
   irrigation. The moisture content ranged from 60 to 63 \% in leaves and
   32-35 \% in branches across the five treatments. The analysis of water
   use efficiency showed that the 0.50 AET plants produced 2.6 kg ha(-1)
   mm(-1) of dry forage compared to 1.8 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) at 0.75 AET. The
   results showed that 0.50 or 0.75 AET represents the best irrigation
   level for L. leucocephala cultivation, producing a total dry yield of
   0.68 and 0.72 t ha(-1), respectively, in our study.},

Title = {Supplementation with Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala on
   voluntary food intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation and live weight

Abstract = {Twenty intact and five fistulated crossbred steers were used in two
   experiments to examine the effect of supplementing maize stover with
   Gliricidia sepium or Leucaena leucocephala forage on intake, rumen
   fermentation, microbial protein supply and live weight changes. The
   basal diet plus 1 kg maize bran was offered alone or supplemented with
   7.5, 15, 22.5 or 30 g DM/kg W-0.75 of gliricidia (experiment 1), and
   with either 15 or 30 g DM/kg W-0.75 of gliricidia or leucaena forage
   (experiment 2). Supplementation increased total dry matter intake (TDMI)
   (P < 0.001). DMI of stover was depressed (P < 0.001) in experiment 1
   from 2.1 to 1.3 kg/day, but increased at the lower levels of
   supplementation in experiment 2. Diet digestibility was only
   significantly increased in experiment 2. Supplementation increased the
   rumen ammonia from 53 to 106 mg/l and from 31 to 111 mg/l in experiment
   1 and 2 respectively, and tended to improve the degradation
   characteristics of the basal diet. The efficiency of microbial N supply
   ranged between 21.0 and 27.7 g N/kg DOMR. The live weight gains from
   supplementation were greater, and the responses to gliricidia and
   leucaena did not differ significantly. It is concluded that the
   supplementation improved dry matter intake and live-weight gains, and
   that Gliricidia sepium could be an alternative supplement to Leucaena
   leucocephala. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Antioxidant activity of brown lead (Leucaena leucocephala) seed extracts
   with and without prior chlorophyll removal was studied in comparison
   with mimosine. Both extracts showed similar hydroxyl radical (HO center
   dot) scavenging activity, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging activity,
   singlet oxygen inhibition and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) scavenging
   capacity (p>0.05). Nevertheless, the extract without prior chlorophyll
   removal had higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity than that with
   prior chlorophyll removal (p<0.05). Generally, lead seed extracts with
   and without prior chlorophyll removal possessed a lower antioxidant
   activity, compared with mimosine. When lead seed extract without prior
   chlorophyll removal (100 and 200ppm) was used in different lipid
   oxidation model systems, including -carotene-linoleic acid and lecithin
   liposome systems, the preventive effect toward lipid oxidation was
   dose-dependent. At the same level of use, mimosine exhibited a higher
   efficacy in prevention of lipid oxidation in both systems as indicated
   by the lower increases in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. A
   similar result was obtained in minced mackerel. Therefore, lead seed
   extract containing mimosine could act as a natural antioxidant to
   prevent lipid oxidation in foods.},

Abstract = {Various organs of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit were analyzed for
   their levels of total nitrogen and free amino acids as well as for
   changes in free amino acid pools from the time of germination through

   (transport product) in the nodules using 15N methodology. L.
   leucocephala organs showed total nitrogen levels similar to those of
   other legumes. Asparagine was the most prevalent amino acid in the
   nodules and roots followed by glutamate and mimosine. Asparagine was the
   second most common amino acid in the leaves and stems, with mimosine
   being the most abundant. Strong correlations were found between the
   total plant levels of aspartate and glutamate, asparagine and NH4+,
   acetylene reduction and glutamate, and asparagine and plantage.
   Asparagine amino- and amide-N accounted for over 75\% of the fixed 15N2

Abstract = {The ability of trees and shrubs to coppice vigorously after being cut or
   pruned is of great importance in the management of agroforestry systems.
   In a study conducted in the seasonally dry climate of Ibadan, Nigeria,
   frequent cutting progressively decreased concentrations of starch and
   total reserve carbohydrates in Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp. and
   Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit. In frequently cut trees, starch was
   severely reduced in the stumps of both species. In contrast, soluble
   sugar concentrations in roots and stems of both species were
   consistently maintained at or above the levels in uncut control trees,
   suggesting that sugar levels were maintained through the hydrolysis of
   starch reserves. No starch replenishment occurred during the six weeks
   after cutting. In trees that were cut and then allowed to grow
   undisturbed during the wet season, replenishment of stem starch began
   within three months after cutting. Shoot regrowth after cutting
   decreased starch levels first in stems and, only after additional cuts,
   in roots. Dry-season cuts had little effect on reserve carbohydrates in
   G. sepium but quickly reduced stem starch in L. leucocephala. Frequent
   cutting decreased dry matter production, and this decrease was
   correlated with reduced levels of reserve carbohydrates.},

Abstract = {The use of the tree-legume Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena), which
   contains high levels of proteins in its foliage, is limited due to the
   presence of the toxic free amino acid mimosine. The goal of this
   research was to develop transgenic leucaena with reduced mimosine
   content. Two genes, pydA and pydB, encoding a meta-cleavage dioxygenase
   (EC 1.13.11.2) and a pyruvate hydrolase (EC 3.7.1.6), respectively, from
   the mimosine-degrading leucaena symbiont Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145,
   were used to transform leucaena. These bacterial genes were
   sequence-optimized for expression in leucaena and cloned into the plant
   binary vector pCAMBIA3201 for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
   transformation. Using immature zygotic embryos as the start explant
   material, six pydA and three pydB transgenic lines were developed. The
   presence and expression of the bacterial genes in the transgenic lines
   were verified by PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR, and Southern analyses.
   HPLC analyses of the transgenic plants determined that the mimosine
   contents of the pydA-expressing lines were reduced up to 22.5\% in
   comparison to the wild-type. No significant reduction in mimosine
   content was observed in the pydB-expressing lines. This is the first
   example of using a gene from a bacterial symbiont to reduce the toxicity
   of a tree-legume. (c) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Three newly introduced cultivar/lines of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) de Wit.) from Australia (cultivar Tarramba) and Hawaii (lines
   KU19 and KU66) were compared with current leading cultivars Peru and
   Cunningham. In 2006-2008, leaf and woody stem production and plant
   chemical compounds were analyzed for forage and bioenergy utilization.
   The experiment was conducted at the Kasetsart University Farm, Pak
   Chong, Nakhon Ratchasima in central Thailand. The results indicated that
   newly introduced cultivar/lines have a greater dry matter yielding
   ability than the cultivars Peru and Cunningham. KU19 generated the
   highest levels of biomass, KU66 was second highest yielder, followed by
   Tarramba, Cunningham and Peru. Each of the new cultivar/lines produced a
   superior woody stem yield for biofuel production than Cunningham and
   Peru. Regarding plant chemical compositions, the new cultivar/lines were
   similar to Peru and Cunningham, exhibiting an energy value at 4.6-4.7
   kcal g-1. The cost benefits for farmers to grow Tarramba would result in
   an increased income and subsequent profit when compared with the current
   cultivar Peru following this 2-year study. We conclude that the new
   introduced cultivar/lines of Tarramba, KU19 and KU66 can be a more
   efficient and a productive energy supplying plant for gasification when
   compared with currently used cultivars Peru and Cunningham.},

   for the measurements of the stem diameter, the plant height, the number
   and area of leaves as well as the root, the stem and the leaf biomasses.
   Results indicated that there is a polynomial relationship of the fourth

Abstract = {Edible mushrooms are increasingly recognized to offer health,
   environmental and socio-economical benefits across the globe. However,
   long cultivation time and low nutritional value of harvested mushrooms
   have remained the limiting factors for taping the benefits and
   sustainable production in developing counties. There is therefore a need
   to seek for alternative substrate formulations that would shorten
   cultivation time, increase the nutritional value of mushrooms as well as
   ensure environmental sustainability. This study examined the potential
   of using nutrient and biomass rich Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit
   foliage in combination with the rice straw (traditional substrate) to
   bolster production and nutritional value of Pleurotus floridanus
   mushroom in Morogoro, Tanzania. Mushrooms were grown in 30 x 40 cm 1.6
   kg dry weight polythene bags in a randomized complete block design
   experiment with five treatments. The shortest cultivation period
   (average of 21 days) which stemmed largely from spawning to full mycelia
   colonization was attained when 5\% Leucaena foliage was mixed with the
   rice straw. There was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in protein
   content from 23.3 to a maximum of 29.8\%, when rice straw was
   supplemented with the 5\% Leucaena, while further increase in Leucaena
   supple-mentation caused a lowering of crude protein content. There were
   significant increases (P < 0.05) in the contents of copper and calcium
   minerals when 5\% of Leucaena foliage was incorporated into the growing
   substrate. Thus, to increase production cycle and contents of protein
   and essential minerals, addition of 5\% of L. leucocephala foliage is
   recommended during production of P. floridanus using rice straw, for
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {Biochar fuel (CH0.50O0.19N0.06) was prepared from Leucaena leucocephala
   bark (CH2.80O0.53N0.03) through the slow pyrolysis process adopting
   design of experiments technique. Modelling and optimization of the slow
   pyrolysis process was respectively carried out implementing five level
   central composite design and numerical technique under response surface
   methodology. Pyrolysis temperature and time were taken as independent
   parameters while biochar fuel yield, bulk density, higher heating value,
   energy density and energy yield were chosen as dependent parameters. The
   optimal pyrolysis temperature and time were estimated to be 367.47
   degrees C and 135.38 min respectively. These optimum values of
   temperature and time gave biochar yield 47.29\%, bulk density 319.73
   kg/m(3), higher heating value 23.30 MJ/kg, energy density 1.21, and
   energy yield 56.55\%. The developed quadratic models were checked using
   ANOVA (analysis of variance) technique for their validity and degree of
   fitness. The high values of `Adequate precision',R-2 and its negligible
   difference with `AdjustedR(2)' as well as `PredictedR(2)' for each model
   indicated that the fitted empirical models can be used for prediction
   with reasonable precision. The quadratic models revealed strong
   interaction between pyrolysis temperature and time towards preparation
   of biochar fuel. It was further observed that desirability of pyrolysis
   temperature (0.91) is more than pyrolysis time (0.63). Comparison of Van
   Krevelen diagram of present biochar fuel with several other biochar
   fuels and coals showed that prepared biochar has better fuel properties
   in comparison to raw bark. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Eco-Efficient Biosorbent Based on Leucaena leucocephala Residues
   for the Simultaneous Removal of Pb(II) and Cd(II) Ions from Water
   System: Sorption and Mechanism},
Journal = {BIOINORGANIC CHEMISTRY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is a potential source of polyphenols widely
   available in southern Mexico. This work highlights the extraction of
   polyphenols from Leucaena leucocephala leaves waste (LLEPs) and the
   evaluation of their efficiency to remove the single and multicomponent
   Pb(II) and Cd(II) metal ions from aqueous solutions. Batch test
   conditions were carried out to examine the effects of contact time,
   initial metal ion concentration, and adsorbent dosage on the biosorption
   process. The surface textures and the composition of the LLEP biosorbent
   was characterized using pH of point of zero charge (pH(PZC)), attenuated
   total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), and
   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF)
   mass spectrometry, respectively. Further analysis using ATR-FTIR after
   adsorption contact of biosorbent was also investigated. The highest
   Langmuir saturation monolayer adsorption capacity, q(m), for the removal
   of Pb(II) by LLEPs was obtained as 25.51 and 21.55mg/g in mono- and
   bimetal solutions, respectively. The pseudo-second-order model provided
   the best fit for the kinetic data obtained for the removal of Pb(II),
   Cd(II), and their mixture, and the k(2) values depend on the adsorbent
   mass. This implied that the chemisorption process might be the mechanism
   of the solute ions-LLEPs interaction in this study. Furthermore, nearly
   100\% removal of lead and cadmium individually and 95\% of their mixture
   was found using 0.9g of LLEPs.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit was inoculated with two elite
   strains of Rhizobium, IRc 1045 and 1050, at the International Institute
   of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and at Fashola, Southwestern Nigeria. At
   IITA, only inoculated plants nodulated but at Fashola, all the plants
   produced nodules. At both locations, inoculation with Rhizobium
   increased total N and dry matter of leucaena as compared to the
   uninoculated plants. This effect was statistically equal to the nitrogen
   treatment. The amount of N fixed annually was estimated at IITA by the
   difference method. In ranged between 448 and 598 kg N/ha and represented
   52 and 61\% of the total N in the plant. After 6 months, leucaena was
   cut at IITA, and maize TZESRW was grown in the same plots to assess the
   influence of previous inoculation treatments on N contribution of
   leucaena. Maize yield data indicated that nitrogen in leucaena prunings
   from inoculated plots was 87\% as efficient as 80 kg urea N/ha but
   prunings from  uninoculated plots gave a fertilizer equivalent of 38 kg
   urea N/ha. In plots where the prunings were removed, the leaf litter and
   decaying roots and nodules contributed N equivalent to 42 kg urea N/ha.
   N recovery studies and appropriate management studies are needed to
   maximize the benefits from leucaena in farming systems.},

Abstract = {In plants, the final step of cysteine formation is catalyzed by
   O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OAS-TL). The purpose of this study was to
   isolate and characterize an OAS-TL from the tree legume Leucaena
   leucocephala (leucaena). Leucaena contains a toxic, nonprotein amino
   acid, mimosine, which is also formed by an OAS-TL, and characterization
   of this enzyme is essential for developing a mimosine-free leucaena for
   its use as a protein-rich fodder. The cDNA for a cytosolic leucaena
   OAS-TL isoform was obtained through interspecies suppression subtractive
   hybridization. A 40-kDa recombinant protein was purified from
   Escherichia coli and used in enzyme activity assays where it was found
   to synthesize only cysteine. The enzyme followed Michaelis-Menten
   kinetics, and the K (m) was calculated to be 1,850 +/- 414 mu M sulfide
   and the V (max) was 200.6 +/- 19.92 mu M cysteine min(-1). The
   N-terminal affinity His-tag was cleaved from the recombinant OAS-TL to
   eliminate its possible interference in binding with the substrate,
   3-hydroxy-4-pyridone, for mimosine formation. The His-tag-cleaved OAS-TL
   was again observed to catalyze the formation of cysteine but not
   mimosine. Thus, the cytosolic OAS-TL from leucaena used in this study is
   specific for only cysteine synthesis and is different from previously
   reported OAS-TLs that also function as beta-substituted alanine
   synthases.},

   evaluations (measures of average height and counted the number of
   leaves, number of active nodes) and determination of total amino acids
   were performed. Data were subjected to analysis of variance with 95\%
   probability (Tukey 5\%). There was no difference in stem growth and leaf
   production among treatments. However, the number of nodules was higher
   in plants treated with distilled water. There was no difference in the
   content of free amino acids between treatments. We conclude that
   although the growth in acid soils is lower, this factor does not
   interfere with the content of amino acids and the formation of nodules.},

   density, and vetiver hedgerow had a bigger decline of 12 percent. (2) in
   plots with hedgerows, silt and clay enriched in the bottom and middle of
   slopes, and the increment of silt or clay of vetiver hedgerow plot was
   bigger that of leucaena leucocephala hedgerow plot. (3) on intercepting
   soil particles, the two hedgerows showed as sand>silt>clay. (4) the two
   hedgerows had a better conservation effect on total nitrogen and total
   potassium. (5) on total nitrogen, available phosphorus and total
   potassium, vetiver hedgerow's effects were stronger than leucaena
   leucocephala hedgerow's; on organic matter, alkalined-nitrogen, total
   phosphorus and available potassium, leucaena leucocephala hedgerow's
   effects were stronger than vetiver hedgerow's. (6) in plots with
   hedgerows, organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and
   available potassium showed an obvious enrichment in slope bottom and in
   the front of hedgerow. Therefore, increasing the amount of nitrogenous
   fertilizer and reducing the amount of potash fertilizer were important
   in this area. And strengthening soil fertilities of slope top and
   portions faraway from hedgerow were also important.},

Abstract = {This work aimed to evaluate the effect of inversion of Prosopis

   by sap displacement method. The Prosopis juliflora was collected in
   Brazilian Agricultural Research Company (EMBRAPA) and the Leucaena
   leucocephala at the Federal University of Campina Grande in Patos,
   Paraiba state, Brazil. Trees with DAP from 5.0 to 10.0 cm were employed.
   Disks of 2.0 cm of thickness were retired on the top and on the base of
   pieces. The external disks were then discarded and the intern ones were
   employed to determine the wood characteristics, being the round pieces
   with 2.0 m. A solution of 2\% of active ingredients of CCB was used to
   treated woods. A total of 10 pieces of each species were treated, and
   five of them remained in the solution for 8 days and the five ones had
   their tops inverted after the sixth day of treatment. The pieces were
   seasoned; disks of 2.0 cm of thickness were taken in 5 positions along
   of pieces and the analyses for determination of copper and boron
   penetration took place. The values of wood characteristics indicated
   that the pieces were homogeneous. The absorption of the solution was of
   19.9 liters (Prosopis juliflora) and of 17.0 liters (Leucaena
   leucocephala). The nominal retentions of CCB were 7.72 and 5.34 kg
   active ingredients (a.i.)/m(3), respectively. In general, the inversion
   of the pieces in the preservative solution is recommended, by providing
   a better distribution, penetration and retention of CCB on treated

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham was grown at 4 sites in the wet

   sprayed treatment. At 1 site in Indonesia, total yield was reduced by
   one third while while at the other, psyllids did not appear to affect
   yield. The large amount of damage possible in the first year suggests
   that psyllids could be a major factor in hindering establishment and
   reducing yield. Further work is needed to establish the factors
   responsible for variations in damage levels at different sites.},

Abstract = {The performance of numerous soil and pasture indicators was determined
   during three consecutive years in two types of silvopastoral grasslands
   based on Leucaena leucocephala-Panicum maximum to select those showing
   higher variability, detect the most useful ones, and know the degree of
   stability of the soil-pasture system for monitoring the management
   effect. The grasslands were: a) silvopastoral system on hydrated red
   ferrallitic soil with six years of exploitation, and b) silvopastoral
   system on lixiviated red ferrallitic soil with five years of
   exploitation. Three groups of indicators (vegetation, soil
   physicochemical and biological) were obtained through the analysis of
   principal components. Those with preponderance value higher than +/-
   0.78 and accounting for, at least, 65\% of the accumulated variance were
   chosen. In the vegetation, up to 50 indicators were studied, selecting 7
   and 9 out of them (for six and five years of exploitation,
   respectively). The plant cover, the bare soil, the density of the basic
   pasture, and the presence of native pastures coincided in them. Out of
   the 76 soil indicators, 15 and 19 were selected (for six and five years
   of exploitation, respectively). In them, the distribution of aggregates
   in humid and dry conditions, the structural stability, the value of n,
   the underground phytomass, the macrofauna, and the mesofauna were
   repeated to account for their variability. Both silvopastoral systems
   progressed in time by increasing the basic pasture population and its
   productive stability, as well as by improving their edaphic
   characteristics. The performance of the indicators permitted
   characterizing the status of the soil-plant system in each grassland,
   and showed that the management to which both grasslands were subject
   affected their ecological and productive improvement. Tables with ranges
   of confidence values were presented for the indicators, which could
   serve as useful, confident, and sensitive tools to discern the shifts
   occurring in each type of grassland, and that could be used in research,
   teaching, and production.},

Abstract = {Soil applicable biochar has been prepared from bark of Leucaena
   leucocephala wood which is a waste generated during its pulping and
   papermaking process. The slow pyrolysis process adopted for this purpose
   has been modelled and optimized employing central composite design and
   desirability function under response surface methodology taking
   temperature (308-592 degrees C) and time (35-205 min) as independent
   variable while yield, loss on ignition, stable organic matter,
   oxidisable carbon and carbon liability index as dependent variable. L.
   leucocephala bark was characterized in terms of proximate analysis
   (moisture 4.90\%, ash 7.20\%, fixed carbon 18.10\%, volatile matter
   69.80\%), elemental analysis (carbon 45.78\%, hydrogen 10.67\%, nitrogen
   1.77\%, oxygen 32.08\%, sulphur 0.09\%), lignocellulosic composition
   (holocellulose 45.86\%, hemicellulose 15.01\%, lignin 34.75\%) and
   compared with a wide range of feedstocks to find its suitability towards
   biochar production. The optimum pyrolysis temperature and residence time
   were found to be 350 degrees C and 60 min respectively which gave
   biochar yield 53.16\%, loss on ignition 88.17\%, oxidisable carbon
   28.82\%, stable organic matter 38.48\%, and carbon liability index 0.32.
   The biochar produced at optimum conditions were characterized by
   proximate analysis (moisture 0.65\%, ash 11.83\%, fixed carbon 40.2\%,
   volatile matter 47.57\%) and elemental analysis (carbon 62.91\%,
   hydrogen 3.12\%, nitrogen 2.65\%, oxygen 20.74\%, sulphur 0.05\%). The
   O/C ratio of 0.25 and H/C ratio of 0.60 confirmed its life between

Abstract = {Smallholder dairy farmers in Natural Region II, especially in Chikwaka
   Communal Area, adopted Acacia angustissima, Calliandra calothyrsus and
   Leucaena leucocephala in the 1995/96 season as alternatives for
   supplementing expensive commercial dairy feeds. Although several
   on-station trials have been done in the subhumid region of Zimbabwe,
   there have been no studies assessing on-farm yields of the introduced
   fodder species. This study evaluated productivity in a communal area
   under varying soil ( pH, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) and
   management conditions ( protection and tree density). Leaf productivity
   was high on farms with relatively higher soil P. Leaf yields ranged from
   0.4-3.3 t DM ha(-1) for A. angustissima, 0.8-5.6 t DM ha(-1) for C.
   calothyrsus and 0.2-0.7 t DM ha(-1) for L. leucocephala, with mean
   values of 2.2, 2.6 and 0.4 t DM ha(-1), respectively. The low yields of
   L. leucocephala were associated with psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana)
   infestation. Decrease in tree density ( low population) resulted in
   reduced yield. Poor performance was also attributed to uncontrolled
   browsing. Influence of soil characteristics could not be confirmed, but
   there were indications that low soil phosphorus may have adversely
   affected tree growth. The yields were generally lower than on-station,
   which implies that there is room for improving fodder tree yields in
   this subhumid region, through improving the availability of P, planting
   a high density of trees, and protecting them from uncontrolled browsing.},

   was significantly higher (p<0.01) in I-100 group as compared to I-0.
   Haemoglobin, packed cell volume and serum concentrations of total
   protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, inorganic phosphorus and alkaline
   phosphatase did not show significant differences as a result of iodine
   supplementation. Though the serum levels of triiodothyronine (T-3) were
   comparable between the two groups, that of thyroxine (T-4) increased
   significantly (p<0.001) in the I-100 group. The T-3:T-4 ratio was also
   similar between both the groups. The study indicated that the adverse
   effect of Leucaena feeding on thyroid gland could possibly be alleviated
   by provision of extra iodine. However, this needs further confirmation
   using long duration studies.},

Abstract = {The adsorptive removal of Cr(VI) was studied using activated carbon
   derived from Leucaena leucocephala (ACLL). The physico-chemical
   properties of ACLL were determined using proximate analysis and N-2 BET
   surface area analysis. The N-2 BET surface area of ACLL was determined
   to be 1131 m(2) g(-1). The point of zero charge (pH(pzc)) of 5.42
   indicated that ACLL surface was positively charged for pH below the
   pH(PZC), attracting anions. The effect of experimental operating
   parameters such as time of contact, ACLL dose, pH, initial concentration
   and temperature was investigated. The optimum values of parameters such
   as concentration of 100 mg L-1, 300 mg of ACLL dose, time of contact of
   60 min, pH of 4 indicated the maximum Cr(VI) uptake of 13.85 mg g(-1).
   The pseudo-second-order kinetic model best fitted with the Cr(VI)
   adsorption data. Adsorptive removal of Cr(VI) onto ACLL satisfactorily
   fitted in the order of Redlich-Peterson > Freundlich > Langmuir > Temkin
   adsorption isotherm model. The thermodynamic parameters showed the
   adsorption of Cr(VI) onto ACLL was an endothermic and spontaneously

   the accumulation of carbon and N in plant tissues. In early
   developmental stages, the number of nodules and nodule biomass were
   correlated with total plant biomass and N-15, and nodules and roots
   contributed 33\%-35\% of the seedling total N. Seedlings associated with
   R. tropici fixed more N and exhibited higher overall biomass compared
   with M. loti seedlings. Four and a half months after inoculation (140
   days after inoculation, DAI), a short (15-day) drought inhibited
   seedling growth and caused a decline in total plant N, with the smallest
   decline in R. tropici seedlings. After 15 days of drought, i.e., 155
   DAI, the nodules had accumulated proline, but the total amino acid
   concentration did not change. Our results indicate that N-fixation is
   independent of seedlings growth. In addition, R. tropici is a better
   choice than M. loti as a symbiont for Leucaena seedlings for forest
   restoration and agroforestry applications under increasingly drier

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the effect of
   supplementations of Leucaena leucocephala or Gliricidia sepium by goats
   fed old Panicum maximum basal diets on their dry matter and nutrient
   intake, digestibility, and N balance. The experiment used four goats
   weighing of around 12 kg fed four kinds of diet in Latin square design.
   The diets were 1 young guinea grass, 2 old guinea grass, 3 old guinea
   grass 60\% + Leucaena 40\%, 4 old guinea grass 60\% + Gliricidia 40\%.
   Results of the study revealed that dry matter and crude protein intake,
   dry matter, crude protein, and NDF digestibility were significantly
   higher when the goats fed young grass, Leucaena- or
   Gliricidia-supplemented old guinea grass than goats fed old guinea grass
   only. N retained as proportion of ingested N by the goats fed young
   guinea grass, and old guinea grass supplemented with Leucaena or
   Gliricidia were positive (63.95, 68.85, and 67.88\%, respectively),
   while the goats fed old guinea grass was negative (- 55.49\%). Intake of
   young grass resulted in greater N excreted via urine while
   supplementation with Leucaena or Gliricidia resulted in greater N
   excreted via feces. It can be concluded that supplementation of Leucaena
   or Gliricidia is very beneficial to increase dry matter and nutrients
   intake, digestibility, and N retention in goats fed Panicum maximum
   basal diets. An important finding of this work is that young forage
   consumed by goats allows to reach important performances and that
   supplementation is not essential.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata (leucaena)-grass pastures are
   productive, perennial and long-lived (>40 years). However, little is
   known about changes in the productivity of these pastures as they age
   even though they are grazed intensively and are rarely fertilised. A
   postal survey of beef cattle producers in Queensland who grow leucaena
   pastures was conducted. The questionnaire gathered information
   regarding: property location; extent and age of leucaena pastures; soil
   type; leucaena and grass establishment methodology; grazing and
   fertiliser management; and grazier perceptions of changes over time in
   leucaena productivity, grass growth and ground cover, prevalence of
   undesirable grasses and weeds, and livestock productivity. Graziers were
   asked to report on both young (<= 10 years old) and aging (>10 years
   old) pastures under their management. Eighty-eight graziers responded
   describing 124 leucaena paddocks covering 11 750 ha. The survey results
   described the typical physical and management characteristics of
   leucaena pastures in Queensland. Graziers reported a decline in leucaena
   productivity in 58\% of aging pastures, and declines in grass growth
   (32\%) and livestock productivity (42\%) associated with declining
   leucaena growth. Leucaena decline was greater in soil types of marginal
   initial fertility, particularly brigalow clay, soft wood scrub, downs
   and duplex soils. Maintenance fertiliser was not applied to most (98\%)
   leucaena pastures surveyed despite significant amounts of nutrient
   removal, particularly phosphorus and sulphur, occurring over prolonged
   periods of moderate to high grazing pressure. It is predicted that large
   areas of leucaena pasture will continue to suffer soil nutrient
   depletion under current management practices. Research is needed to
   develop ameliorative actions to reinvigorate pasture productivity.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is a fast-growing leguminous biomass with great
   energetical and valueadded chemical compounds potential (saccharides,
   biogas, bio-oil, etc.). Using the thermogravimetric and derivative
   thermogravimetric curves, the different trends followed by L.
   leucocephala during pyrolysis, 0.25 equivalence ratio (ER) of
   gasification, 0.50 equivalence ratio of gasification and combustion were
   analyzed, and the activation energies were obtained by Distributed
   Activation Energy Model (DAEM) method. Gas samples were collected
   through adsorption tubes during the gasification at 0.25 ER and 0.50 ER
   to observe the distribution of the main chemical products in this
   process by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and were compared with
   pyrolysis products. It was found that small amounts of oxygen have
   changes in the kinetics of the process, leading to significant decreases
   in the activation energy at the beginning of the degradation of
   components such as cellulose (from 170 to 135 kJ mol- 1 at 0.25
   conversion at 0.50 ER gasification). The activation energy of lignin
   disintegration was also reduced (342 kJ mol-1), assimilating the
   beginnings of gasification processes such as the Boudouard reaction.
   0.50 ER gasification is potentially an interesting process to obtain
   quality bio-oil, since a large amount of hexane is detected (44.96\%),
   and value-added oxygenated intermediates such as alcohols and glycols.
   Gasification at 0.25 ER, on the other hand, is much more similar to
   pyrolysis, obtaining a wide variety of short-chain compounds resulting
   from the disintegration of the main lignocellulosic components,
   especially ketones such as 1-hydroxypropan-2-one (19.48\%), and notable
   amount of furans and anhydrosugars like d-allose (5.50\%).},

Title = {Systemic effects of Leucaena leucocephala ingestion on ringtailed

Volume = {77},

Abstract = {Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) is a leguminous tree that is nutritious
   forage for domestic livestock when ingested in limited amounts.
   Unfortunately, leucaena contains mimosine, a plant amino acid, that can
   be toxic when ingested at higher concentrations. Reported toxic effects
   include alopecia (fur loss), poor body condition, infertility, low birth
   weight, thyroid gland dysfunction, and organ toxicity. Originally native
   to Mexico and Central America, leucaena has been introduced throughout
   the tropics, including Berenty Reserve, Madagascar where it was planted
   as supplemental browse for livestock. In Berenty, a seasonal syndrome of
   alopecia in ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta) is associated with eating
   leucaena. Although much is known about the toxic effects of leucaena and
   mimosine on domestic animals and humans, the systemic effects on
   wildlife had not been studied. In a comparison of lemurs that include
   leucaena in their diet and those that do not, we found that animals that
   ingest leucaena absorb mimosine but that ingestion does not affect body
   condition, cause kidney or liver toxicity, or affect the intestinal
   tract. Alopecia is due to mimosine's interference of the hair follicle
   cycle. Leucaena ingestion is associated with higher serum albumin,
   -tocopherol, and thyroxine concentrations, suggesting that leucaena may
   provide some nutritional benefit and that lemurs can detoxify and
   convert mimosine to a thyroid stimulating metabolite. The primary
   conservation consequence of leucaena ingestion at Berenty may be
   increased infant mortality due to the infants' inability cling to their
   alopecic mothers. The widespread introduction of leucaena throughout the
   tropics and its rapid spread in secondary forest conditions mean that
   many other leaf-eating mammals may be including this tree in their diet.
   Thus, exposure to leucaena should be considered when wildlife health is
   being evaluated, and the potential effects on wildlife health should be
   considered when contemplating leucaena introduction into or near
   wildlife habitat. Am. J. Primatol. 77:633-641, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {Twelve white Fulani x N'dama cross-bred calves weighing 83.79 +/- 1.16
   kg were used in an 84-day experiment to investigate the utilization of
   forage resources from natural grazing land. The experimental diets were
   sole grazing, grazing + hay, grazing + silage and grazing + Leucaena
   leucocephala leaves. The calves were divided into four groups of three
   animals each and were randomly assigned to the four experimental diets.
   Crude protein (CP) contents of the forages ranged from 59 to 171 g/kg
   dry matter (DM). Neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre
   (ADF) contents of the forages ranged from 560 to 705 g/kg DM and 363 to
   440 g/kg DM, respectively. Significantly (P < 0.05) higher values in
   mineral contents (Ca, K, P and Mg) were recorded for L. leucocephala
   leaves compared to other forage resources. Variations (P < 0.05) were
   observed in the average daily gain. Animals on grazing + L. leucocephala
   leaves diet had the highest (113 g/day) average daily gain, while those
   on sole grazing showed the least value (26.2 g/day). Packed cell volume
   (PCV), total serum protein, urea and calcium concentration showed
   significant differences (P < 0.05). Effective utilization of forage
   resources from the natural pasture by the calves was attained on
   supplementation with conserved forages and L. leucocephala leaves
   without any deleterious effects on the haematological and serum
   parameters.},

Abstract = {Many studies demonstrate the potential application of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for remediation purposes, but little is known on
   AMF potential to enhance plant tolerance to arsenic (As) and the
   mechanisms involved in this process. We carried anatomical and
   ultrastructural studies to examine this symbiotic association and the
   characteristics of shoots and roots of Leucaena leucocephala in
   As-amended soils (35 and 75 mg As dm(-3)). The experiment used 3 AMF
   isolates from uncontaminated soils: Acaulospora morrowiae, Glomus
   clarum, and Gigaspora albida; a mixed inoculum derived from combining
   these 3 isolates (named Mix AMF); and, 3 AMF isolates from
   As-contaminated areas: A. morrowiae, G. Clarum and Paraglomus occultum.
   Phytotoxicity symptoms due to arsenic contamination appeared during
   plant growth, especially in treatments without AMF application.
   Inoculation with G. clarum and the mixture of species (A. morrowiae, G.
   albida, and G. clarum) resulted in better growth of L. leucocephala in
   soils with high As concentrations, as well as significant As removal
   from the soil, showing a potential for using AMF in phytoextraction.
   Light microscopy (LS), transmission (TEM) and scanning electron
   microscopies (SEM) studies showed the colonization of the AMF in plant
   tissues and damage in all treatments, with ultrastructural changes being
   observed in leaves and roots of L. leucocephala, especially with the
   addition of 75 mg dm(-3) of As. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Aquaculture represents the fastest growing food-producing sector
   worldwide. However, the intensification of fish farms has led to
   environmental, health, and welfare challenges. The monogenean
   ectoparasite Gyrodactylus spp. has been considered one of the most
   pathogenic ectoparasites affecting fish, and no specific control
   strategies besides formalin baths have been established. The use of
   bioactive plants has been recently proposed as an alternative method to
   control gyrodactylid infections. Leucaena leucocephala is a tropical
   legume that has been found with anthelmintic activity against both
   internal and external parasites of cattle. Therefore, the objective of
   this study was to assess the anthelmintic-like activity of L.
   leucocephala aqueous extract against Gyrodactylus spp. in hybrid tilapia
   Oreochromis spp. fingerlings and its effect on host health through
   histopathological analysis. Five concentrations of L. leucocephala
   aqueous extract were employed (2.00, 1.00, 0.50, 0.25, and 0.125 mg/mL)
   to estimate the mean effective concentration (EC50). Distilled water and
   formalin (1:4,000) were used as negative and positive controls,
   respectively. The aqueous extract of L. leucocephala showed a
   dose-dependent behavior, with an EC50 of 0.228 mg/mL. Quercetin was
   identified as the main phytochemical present in the extract. Postmortem
   analysis of fingerlings exposed to the plant extract had no
   treatment-associated pathological findings, thus indicating that the use
   of L. leucocephala baths had no negative impact that could jeopardize
   the lives of treated animals. After the in vivo assessment, the aqueous
   extract of L. leucocephala appears to be a promising alternative to
   control gyrodactylid infection in tilapia.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the shoot biomass of
   gliricidia (Ghricidia sepium) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) in an
   alley cropping system and the addition effect of this biomass on the
   chemical and physical properties of a Yellow Latosol of a coastal

   cultivated in the alleys of these legumes was also evaluated. Gtiricidia
   was planted by cuttings in 1994, and leucaena was planted by seedlings
   in 1995, in rows of 3 m apart. At periods of three to five months, cuts
   were carried on and the shoot biomass was incorporated to the soil.
   Stems with diameter higher than I cm were not considered in the biomass
   weight. The dry matter obtained in these cuts was expressed in ton
   ha(-1) year(-1). In 1998, soil samples were taken to quantify some soil
   chemical and physical properties, Soil samples from a neighbor area were
   used as control. Leucaena and gliricidia. yield were, respectively, 4.87
   and 5.80 ton ha(-1) year(-1) of shoot dry matter. Gliricidia showed a
   lesser competition to cassava in the interrows. The incorporation of
   shoot biomass of both legumes to the soil caused an increment in the
   values of pH and Ca+Mg, but has not affected organic matter content and
   CEC. Decreases of the soil density and increases of the porosity were
   also observed in response to legume incorporation. These effects were
   most noticeable in the superficial layers.},

Abstract = {Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 nodulates Leucaena leucocephala and
   Phaseolus vulgaris, in addition to a wide range of tropical tree
   legumes. Six overlapping clones that complemented nodulation defects in
   leucaena and bean rhizobia were isolated and a 40-kb map of the
   symbiosis region was constructed. The common nod and nifA genes were
   situated approximately 17 kb apart, with the nodlJ genes in between.
   These clones enabled a derivative of TAL1145 carrying a partially
   deleted pSym to form ineffective nodules on both leucaena and bean, and
   a similar derivative of Rhizobium etli TAL182 to form ineffective
   nodules on bean. When two representative clones, pUHR9 and pUHR114, were
   each transferred to wild-type rhizobial strains, they allowed
   ineffective nodulation by Rhizobium meliloti on both leucaena and bean
   and by Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae on bean. Transconjugants of R.
   leguminosarum bv. trifolii formed effective nodules on leucaena and
   ineffective nodules on bean. Tn5 mutagenesis of the symbiosis region
   resulted in a variety of nodulation and fixation phenotypes on leucaena

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDNowadays, the Aedes aegypti mosquito represents a serious
   public health issue in view of the large outbreaks of the arboviral
   diseases zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. This holometabolous
   insect has midgut digestive enzymes that are trypsin- and
   chymotrypsin-like proteins. Protease inhibitors are able to bind to
   proteolytic enzymes and promote a blockage in digestion and nutrition,
   leading to death. Thus, we investigated the effect of trypsin inhibitor
   of Leucaena leucocephala (LTI) seeds on egg hatching, larval development
   and digestive midgut proteases.
   RESULTSLTI was obtained by trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed
   by a single chromatography step on anhydrous trypsin sepharose.
   Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl
   sulphate showed a single protein band with a molecular mass close to 20
   kDa. After exposure of Ae. aegypti eggs to LTI (0.3mg mL(-1)), egg
   hatching was reduced (50\%). LTI did not show acute toxicity on newly
   hatched larvae incubated under the same conditions, but after 10 days of
   exposure a high mortality rate (86\%) was observed and the surviving
   larvae had a 25\% delay in development. LTI was able to inhibit in vitro
   the midgut enzymatic activity (70\%), and when larvae were incubated
   with LTI solution we observed an inhibition of 56\%.

Abstract = {Dry season feeding has always posed a problem for ruminant nutrition in
   sub-Saharan Africa. The availability of browse plants or multi-purpose
   trees during this period has led to their incorporation in the farming
   systems. The need therefore to investigate the feeding value and
   fermentation profiles of WAD sheep fed grass hay with supplemental
   Leucaena leucocephala formed the objective of this study. Eight 18-24
   months old West African Dwarf (WAD) sheep (28.8 +/- 4.2 kg body weight)
   were used in the study. Four of the sheep were fistulated ruminally and
   rumen pH, ammonia and volatile fatty acid were measured. Dried leaves of
   L. leucocephala were offered at two levels (25 and 50\% of DMI, diets
   D25\% and D50\%, respectively) as supplement to a basal hay diet. The
   basal hay diet without supplement was the control diet. Diet D25\% had a
   higher (p < 0.05) ruminal ammonia concentration than the control, while
   diet D50\% had a higher (p < 0.05) total volatile fatty acid (VFA)
   concentration compared to both the control and D25\% diets,
   respectively. Diet D25\% had a marginal increase of 6.7\% N- retention
   over the control diet. Organic matter digestibility (OMD) decreased (p <
   0.05) with level of supplementation. Animals on D50\%, D25\% and the
   control diets lost 14, 7.3 and 5\%, respectively, of retained energy
   leading to a negative energy balance. Overall results suggest that a
   25\% level of supplementation with leucaena gave the best outcome even
   though a range of 25-50\% could be fed during periods of basal diet
   scarcity.},

   determined in plant tests and some strains were perhaps more
   symbiotically proficient at fixing nitrogen with L. leucocephala than
   were reference strains. The genetic diversity of these strains was
   determined by RFLP analysis of total DNAs using, as probes, six
   arbitrarily selected cosmid clones from a gene library of strain TAL
   1145, a well-characterized reference strain. There were four plasmid
   profile groups which did not correlate with either symbiotic competence
   or RFLP analysis. RFLP analysis, unlike plasmid profiles, permitted a
   determination that all 13 Egyptian strains were evidently homogeneous
   and quite distinct from previously studied Leucaena-nodulating Rhizobium

Abstract = {One of the reasons for the low rate of adoption of alley cropping in the
   humid tropics is the problem of establishing the desired hedgerow trees.
   A split plot experimental design trial was set up to investigate the
   effects of 4 levels of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (0, 30, 60, and 120 kg N
   ha(-1)) on the growth of leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in an
   intercrop with maize. Maize (Ekona 83TZ SR Y) was planted at 0, 25, 50,
   and 75 cm from Leucaena hedgerows planted on the same day. Leucaena
   plants were harvested at 3, 6, and 12 months after planting for biomass
   yield, N uptake, nodulation and mycorrhization. Results showed that at
   0, 25, and 50 cm Leucaena/maize intercrop, there was no effect of N on
   Leucaena biomass. Leucaena biomass yield at 75-cm spacing compared
   favorably with the biomass of Leucaena sole cropped that had received 0,
   30, and 60 kg N ha(-1). Application of 120 kg N ha(-1) to sole Leucaena
   increased biomass yield significantly above all the intercrop spacings.
   Measurement of the solar radiation in the system showed that there was a
   close relationship between the amount of solar radiation received by
   Leucaena and its biomass yield; Maize intercropped closer than 75 cm
   from Leucaena hedges reduced radiation received by Leucaena by 72\% at
   25 cm compared with 29\% at 75 cm. This effect reduced Leucaena biomass
   yield at 25-cm spacing by 50\%. This study showed that Leucaena can be
   established in intercrop with maize, but it requires about 75-cm
   intercrop spacing with crop and about 120 kg N ha(-1) for good
   establishment. Leucaena/maize intercrop at 75-cm spacing enables
   Leucaena to receive about 72\% solar radiation and larger area to forage
   for plant nutrients.},

Abstract = {The binding constants of Cu2+ and galactomannans composed of sugar units
   of mannose and galactose from the seeds of Cassia fastuosa and Leucaena
   leucocephala were determined by potentiometric titrations acid inspected
   by EPR spectroscopy. Two complexed species were found in both systems,
   one moiety being the metal ion (M) and the other moiety a sugar monomer
   of the polysaccharide (L), non-protonated, ML, and protonated, MHL. The
   values for the logarithms of the binding constants are in the range of
   15 units for ML for both employed galactomannans, and 8.0 for MHL for
   Man:Gal medium average ratio 4:1 galactomannan (C. fastuosa) and 6.8 for
   Man:Gal medium average ratio 2.6:1 one (L. leucocephala).
   The EPR spectra have shown one octahedral complex species linked through
   the oxygen atoms of the hydroxyl groups of the monomer with tetragonal
   deformation. The A and g obtained values were A(parallel to) = 178G,
   g(parallel to) = 2.260, and g(perpendicular to) = 2.050 and
   A(perpendicular to) = 30G for CU2+ with the galactomannans. This was
   assigned to be ML2 complex which was only detected in the solid state
   due to the formation of insoluble products in solution, above pH value
   of 7.0.
   The extension of formation of complexed species of galactomannans with
   Cu2+ is probably much more affected by the pH variation than by the
   degree of substitution of monomers of the chain of the biopolymers
   studied so far. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited, All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala generally produces pods with more than 7-9 seeds.
   This is regulated by the stigmatic inhibition of pollen grain
   germination when the pollen grains are less than a critical number in
   the stigma. This number-dependent inhibition of pollen grain germination
   is effected by a pH-dependent proteinaceous inhibitor active at the
   stigmatic pH. Only when the pollen grains in the stigma exceed the
   critical number, they inactivate the inhibitor by collectively raising
   the stigmatic  pH and thus overcoming the inhibition. The adaptive
   significane of such pre-fertilization mechanism for the female in
   inciting mate competition among the pollen grains is discussed. The
   evolution of en masse pollen grain dispersal units is explained as a
   sexual selection strategy by males in response to such stigmatic
   inhibition by females.},

Abstract = {From 1980 to 1983, a study was carried out to determine the effect of
   intercropped Leucaena leucocephala (at various spacings) with maize and
   beans on fodder and wood production and on crop yields. Fodder
   production initially was assessed at 14 months by pruning the lower
   halves of trees. The trees were clipped 1 m above the ground at 23
   months of age and subsequently at 3-monthly intervals. Crop yields were
   assessed for four cropping seasons. Mean per-tree wood volumes at 23
   months were 23 dm3 (clean-weeded), 18 dm3 (intercropped wiht beans) and
   15 dm3 intercropped with maize. In relation to spacements, mean per-tree
   wood volumes ranged from 15 dm3 (1 .times. 3 m) to 30 dm3(1 .times. 6
   m), representing an overall per-ha wood volume of 42.9 m3 ha-1. While
   management regimes did not have significant effects, the per-tree fodder
   yields increased with hedgerow spacing. On an area basis, yield was
   consistent at 3 t ha-1 year-1 (dry weight) representing a per-ha
   nutrient drain estiamted at 87 kg nitrogen, 42 kg potassium, 20 kg
   calcium, 8 kg magnesium and 5 kg phosphorus. Shading effects from trees
   depressed yields of food crops in the second season, but once 3-monthly
   hedgerow pruning began this problem was overcome and normal food yields
   resumed. The implication of these results for meeting fodder and wood
   needs and for long-term production schedules are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to evaluate the optimum inclusion levels of
   Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal on growth, haematology, and
   physiological performance of pigs. A total of 16 grower pigs comprising
   of 12 females and 4 castrated males weighing an average of 13.5 kg were
   assigned into a completely randomized experimental layout, subjected to
   4 inclusion levels of leaf meal (0, 50, 100, and 150 g/kg DM).
   Regression model and one-way ANOVA model were used to analyse the data.
   The total feed intake (TFI) and average weekly feed intake (AWFI) were
   significantly affected quadratically (P < 0.05) by increased inclusion
   levels, while tubular diameter (TD) and epithelial cell thickness (ECT)
   of the thyroid gland were not significantly (P > 0.05) affected
   quadratically. However, a significant difference due to inclusion levels
   on TD and ECT was established due to one-way ANOVA. Optimal inclusion
   levels of 70.5 g/kg for TFI and 70.0 g/kg for AWFI were significantly
   established with 99\% regression coefficient. This implies that the
   quantity of Leucaena leaf meal intake continued increasing up to 70.50
   g/kg inclusion levels before it started reducing; hence, the optimal
   inclusion levels of Leucaena for best feed intake is at 70.5 g/kg at
   which point all other parameters of growth, haematology, and
   physiological parameters were not significantly affected.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala, previously known as `miracle tree' because of its
   numerous agroforestry uses has become a serious invasive species in
   tropical regions. Despite the risks associated with the spread of L.
   leucocephala, changes in its distribution with respect to climate are
   poorly understood, particularly in Africa where it has been widely
   introduced in more than 30 countries. To provide first-line information
   for the management of L. leucocephala, we examined its potential
   distribution in Africa using ecological niche modelling. We identified
   bioclimatic variables that determine the global distribution of L.
   leucocephala, and calibrated niche models using MaxEnt and species
   occurrences recorded between 1973 and 2013. The potential distribution
   of this species was estimated from model projections in Africa based on
   current and future climatic conditions. We tested the hypothesis of
   niche conservatism for L. leucocephala by comparing its climatic niche
   in Africa to that of its native range. Under current conditions, L.
   leucocephala is constrained between 30 degrees S and 20 degrees N in
   Africa, with the broadest distribution in East Africa. High rainfall
   areas in Central Africa with no known records of this species hitherto,
   were found to be highly suitable for its establishment. We predicted a
   significant decrement in the extent of areas at risk of invasion by L.
   Leucocephala under changing climates in Africa. Our results revealed
   that the study species occupies a similar but non-identical climatic
   niche in Africa in relation to its native niche. Climate change is
   likely to impede the spread of L. leucocephala in Africa.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to examine the effect of Leucaena
   leucocephala-Morus alba-Azadirachta indica (2: 1: 1) based leaf meal
   mixture as nitrogen source to partially replace (50\%) soybean meal in
   conventional supplements on the performance of goats. Twelve
   non-descript female goats were divided into two equal groups in a
   completely randomized design to receive either the leaf meal mixture
   based supplement (LMAM) or soybean meal incorporated concentrate (SBM)
   and wheat straw for ad libitum intake for a two month period. The goats
   given LMAM and SBM concentrate had similar dry matter intake (50.2 +/-
   1.67 g/kg W-0.75) and nutrient digestibility. Nitrogen intake and its
   faecal and urinary excretion were similar irrespective of diets. The
   balance of nitrogen was positive and comparable (1.63 +/- 0.08 g/d) in
   both dietary treatments. The plane of nutrition on both diets was
   comparable and the digestible crude protein and total digestible
   nutrients values of the composite diets offered did not differ
   significantly between the dietary supplements. The serum concentration
   of enzymes alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were
   statistically similar in both the groups, while haemoglobin and serum
   urea levels were significantly (p<0.05) higher in LMAM and SBM
   treatments, respectively. It was concluded that the leaf meal mixture of
   Leucaena leucocephala-Morus alba-Azadirachta indica could be used as a
   vegetable protein supplement to wheat straw based diet of goats.},

Abstract = {Seed hydration memory is an adaptive strategy for plants in semiarid
   environments where water availability is irregular and unpredictable.
   Species native to these environments that have memory benefit from
   discontinuous hydration during their germination process and acquire
   tolerance to environmental stresses. The guiding question of this study
   is ``does an alien species that invades a semiarid ecosystem also have
   seed hydration memory and benefit from discontinuous hydration?{''} To
   answer this question, we collected seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.)
   de Wit, an alien species that invades a Brazilian Tropical Dry Forest.
   We subjected the seeds to 0, 1, 2 and 3 hydration/dehydration cycles (HD
   cycles) at three different time intervals and, subsequently, to water,
   saline and thermal stresses. In addition, we used modeling to define the
   osmotic and thermal limits for occurrence of L. leucocephala and
   evaluated whether these limits increase after discontinuous hydration of
   seeds. The cycles of HD positively influenced the germination of seeds
   submitted to all stresses evaluated, increasing seed tolerance to
   treatments of water, saline, and thermal stresses. Discontinuous
   hydration increased the osmotic limits of salinity and thermal
   tolerance, although not increasing the osmotic limit of water deficit.
   Our results show that HD cycles also change the patterns of germinative
   responses of an invasive species to the environmental stresses of the
   invaded ecosystem.},

Abstract = {For the estimation of genetic diversity and population structure, 23
   accessions of Leucaena leucocephala were characterized using
   morphological and molecular markers. A medium to high degree of genetic
   variability was calculated among these accessions based on eight
   quantitative traits. Furthermore, a cluster analysis based on
   morphological characteristics grouped the 23 Leucaena accessions into
   five groups based on their similarities. Furthermore, the principal
   component analysis revealed that eight quantitative traits contributed
   for 82.57\% of the total variability. Eleven simple sequence repeats
   (SSR) markers showed a high degree of polymorphism among the 23 L.
   leucocephala accessions. The polymorphic information contents (PIC) for
   these 11 markers were estimated and revealed that SSR723 had higher PIC
   value (0.90). Also, the dendrogram generated based on 11 markers
   distinctively demarcated most of the L. leucocephala accessions into
   different clusters indicating its vast genetic diversity in the
   population. A population structure study of these 23 L. leucocephala
   accessions showed the existence of two gene pools. Also, analysis of
   molecular variance showed that there was 13\% variability between
   populations, while there was 87\% variability within the population. The
   first and second coordinates of principal coordinate analysis
   unconditionally distributed these accessions into four coordinates based
   on their similarity. Overall, the high degree of genetic variability
   described by morphological and molecular markers in L. leucocephala can
   be used as a basic tool for assessing genetic diversity and linkage
   mapping in Leucaena genetic improvement programs.},

   established. The biochemical analysis of different cell wall components
   in the mature wood of the main trunk revealed high holocellulose and

   syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio was less than for the mature wood. As
   compared to the branch xylem, concentration of cell wall polysaccharides
   and lignin content was higher in both juvenile and mature wood collected
   from the main trunk. Thioacidolysis and GC-MS analysis of wood lignin
   from juvenile and mature wood showed that an increased concentration in
   lignin content in mature wood is associated with a corresponding
   increase in S/G ratio. The structural information of the acetylated
   lignin was investigated by H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Our results indicate
   that the mature wood from the main trunk is superior in pulp yielding

   with higher carrying capacity (2.93 +/- 0.43 AU ha(-1) year(-1)). Yield
   fluctuated over time (p < 0.0001) with greater biomass (p < 0.05) during
   the rainy (up to 3722 +/- 121 kg DM ha(-1)), than in the transition
   (1800 +/- 121 kg DM ha(-1)) and dry seasons (511 +/- 121 kg DM ha(-1)).
   Between 59 and 65\% of the biomass was grass during the transitional and
   rainy seasons, while during the dry season, 100\% of the biomass was
   from the trees and crude protein was greater in trees (24\%) than in
   grass (10\%) biomass. Rest periods for the paddocks varied according to
   grazing season (from 31 to 120 days). Higher tree density increased
   forage biomass and yield in the silvopastoral system, which was
   maintained throughout the year even with seasonal precipitation because
   the trees sustained growth for an extended period during the year.},

Abstract = {Expansion of leucaena into temperate regions of the world will require
   additional tolerance to freezing stress. Leucaena leucocephala may be
   the most widely tested woody legume in the last 15 years. Leucaena
   pulverulenta and Leucaena retusa are two species with more cold
   tolerance than L. leucocephala. A screening trial with 38 accessions of
   L. pulverulenta, 26 of L. leucocephala, and 1 of L. retusa was begun in
   1983 at Kingsville, Texas {[}USA] where freezing temperatures may  occur
   every year. A biomass production trial using L. leucocephala (K-8) was
   planted in 1982 to evaluate the biomass production of this widely used
   strain under semi-arid conditions with minimum fertilizer inputs and no
   irrigation. Biomass estimations were made with regression equations that
   predicted weight from log10 basal stem diameter measurements. The trees
   in both trials were harvested after a -12.degree. C freeze in December
   1983 killed all trees except L. retusa to ground level. Less  severe
   freezes in 1984-85 of -7.degree. and -9.degree. C killed all L.
   leucocephala to ground level whereas less than 2\% of the L.
   pulverulenta were killed to ground level, thus demonstrating the
   difference in cold tolerance between these two species. Dry wood
   production in the screening trial of the L. leucocephala after 10
   months'' coppice growth ranged from 654 to 3602 g dry biomass per tree
   and that of the L. pulverulenta during the same period ranged from 437
   to 2505 g dry biomass per tree. Dry wood productivity of L. leucocephala
   (K-8) 1-year coppice growth ranged from 1.4 t ha-1 on a poorly drained
   soil to 10 t ha-1 on a moderately drained soil.},

Abstract = {Studies conducted using cattle (experiment I) and goats (experiment 2)
   to evaluate the effects of Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) forage on
   intake, digestion and animal performance are reported. In experiment 1,
   20 crossbred steers were used to describe the responses when
   supplementing napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) with 0, 7.5, 15, 22.5
   or 30.0 g DM/kgW(0.75) leucaena forage. Supplementation increased the
   total dry matter intake, but not that of napier grass. Diet
   digestibility was lowest in the control group, and the average live
   weight gains were increased significantly by supplementation. In
   experiment 2, six dairy goats were fed leucaena and Gliricidia sepium in
   compounded rations, in contrast to commercial concentrate. Voluntary
   food intake, milk yield and composition were measured. There was no
   significant effect of the supplements on voluntary food intake or milk
   yield, but the commercial concentrate produced the highest level of
   crude protein and lactose. It is concluded that L. leucocephala improves
   intake and animal performance and that it can replace expensive
   commercial protein sources in a diet for ruminants.},

   Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay (control) and the hay supplemented
   with either Acacia or Leucaena seedpod meal. In Experiment 2, maasai
   lovegrass (Eragrostis superba) hay (control) was offered alone or with a
   supplement of Leucaena seedpod meal. In Experiment 1, calves
   supplemented with Leucaena meal had higher gain (486 g d(-1)) than the
   control (239 g d(-1)) or those receiving Acacia pod meal (250 g d(-1)).
   In Experiment 2, calves on Leucaena meal had higher gains (559 g d(-1))
   than the control (276 g d(-1)) confirming the results obtained in
   Experiment 1. Seedpods of A. brevispica contained only 65\% of their
   seeds, resulting in a lower digestible energy concentration than
   Leucaena seedpods. These data confirm that cattle productivity can be
   increased if pods of L. leucocephala are collected during periods of
   abundance, stored and used as supplements for growing calves.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The effects of temperature and holding times on the torrefaction of
   Leucaena Leucocephala (Leucaena) were elucidated via a novel isothermal
   decomposition approach. The torrefaction was performed in a fixed-bed
   reactor at temperature ranged from 200 to 300 degrees C for 20, 40 and
   60 min. The effects of both torrefaction temperature and holding time
   were studied quantitatively and qualitatively by evaluating the
   distribution product yields and surface morphological changes.
   Quantitatively, the mass yield decreased with increasing temperature for
   all tested holding times, while the liquid and gas yields increased
   steadily due to the release of volatiles from the biomass decomposition.
   Qualitatively, significant morphological changes on Leucaena due to
   torrefaction were evidently captured via SEM imaging analysis. For
   torrefaction temperatures from 200 to 260 degrees C, the raw and
   torrefied Leucaena showed that pore evolution process had become
   evident. However, for torrefaction temperatures from 280 to 300 degrees
   C, the torrefied Leucaena revealed that the internal structure of
   torrefied Leucaena underwent pore development process. The pore
   development was noticeably observed for all temperatures. The values of
   activation energy (E-a) and pre-exponential factor (ln A) for the
   torrefaction were calculated based on the Coats-Redfern method for first
   order reaction. The values of E-a and ln A for 20, 40 and 60 min were
   found to be 39.75, 40.10 and 42.31 kJ/mol, and 3.92, 4.14 and 4.67. As a
   conclusion, the torrefaction of Leucaena from 200 to 300 degrees C for
   20 min holding time is more reactive as compared to that at higher
   holding time.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS},
Year = {1990},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {37-42},
Abstract = {We studied the effect of three successive cuttings on N uptake and
   fixation and N distribution in Leucaena leucocephala. Two isolines,
   uninoculated or inoculated with three different Rhizobium strains, were
   grown for 36 weeks and cut every 12 weeks. The soil was labelled with 50
   ppm KNO3 enriched with 10 atom \% 15N excess soon after the first
   cutting. Except for the atom \% 15N excess in branches of K28 at the
   second cutting, both the L. leucocephala isolines showed similar
   patterns of total in different parts of the plant at each cutting. The
   Rhizobium strain did not influence the partitioning of 15N among the
   different plant parts. Significant differences in 15N enrichment
   occurred in different parts. Live nodules of both isolines showed the
   lowest atom \% 15N excess values (0.087), followed by leaves (0.492),
   branches (0.552), stems (0.591), and roots (0.857). The roots contained
   about 60\% of the total plant N and about 70\% of the total N derived
   from fertilizer over the successive cuttings. The total N2 fixed in the
   roots was about 60\% of that fixed in the whole plant, while the shoots
   contained only 20\% of the fixed N2. We conclude that reserves in roots
   and nodules constitutes another N source that must be taken into account
   when estimating fixed N2 or the N balance after pruning or cutting
   plants. 15N enrichment declined up to about fivefold in the reference
   and the N2-fixing plants over 24 weeks following the 15N application.
   The proportion and the amounts of N derived from N2 fixation increased
   with time although its proportion remained constant.},

Abstract = {Thirty Angora (16+/-2 kg initial body weight) and 20 Spanish doelings
   (19+/-2 kg initial body weight), approximately 8 months of age, were
   used in an 10 week experiment to evaluate effects of dietary level of
   Leucaena leucocephala on body weight (BW) gain and fiber growth. The
   control diet (CS) included 9\% dry matter (DM) of formaldehyde-treated
   casein; other diets consisted of 15, 30, 45 or 60\% DM of leucaena leaf
   meal (0.75\% mimosine; 15, 30, 45 and 601, respectively). Diets were
   formulated to be 2.13 Meal metabolizable energy/kg DM, and ranged in
   crude protein from 10 to 14\% of DM. DM intake was greater (P<0.05) for
   451 than for CS and 151 (710, 648, 815, 899 and 811 g per day fas CS,
   15, 30, 45 and 601, respectively) and similar (P>0.05) between Angora
   and Spanish doelings. BW gain was similar (P>0.05) among diets (48, 28,
   38, 34 and 26 g per day for CS, 15, 30, 45 and 601, respectively) and
   between breeds. Mohair growth rate was lower (P<0.05) for 60 and 301
   than for CS (1.34, 1.18, 0.94, 1.16 and 0.88 mg cm(-2) per day, and
   mohair diameter was greatest (P<0.05) for CS and lowest (P<0.05) for 601
   (27.7, 25.9, 25.1, 25.0 and 23.8 mu m for CS, 15, 30, 45 and 601,
   respectively). Cashmere growth rate and fiber diameter for Spanish goats
   were similar among diets, and primary and secondary follicle activities
   for both Angora and Spanish goats were not affected by dietary
   treatments (P>0.05). Diet affected (P<0.05) plasma concentrations of
   urea, threonine, arginine, valine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine
   and lysine, with concentrations increasing as dietary level of leucaena
   increased. In conclusion, diets of moderate to high levels (e.g., 45\%)
   of leucaena with 0.75\% mimosine can be fed to goats without adverse
   effects on BW gain or fiber growth. However, further study of the
   composition of leucaena-based diets appears necessary to achieve most
   efficient utilization. (C) 2000:Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) is widely used to
   regenerate degraded landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions and
   serves as a protein source for animals in agrosilvopastoral systems.
   Thus, our objective was to assess the spatial distribution of insects on
   the tree crown (vertical: upper, middle, and basal canopy; horizontal:
   north, south, east, and west) and leaf surfaces (adaxial and abaxial) of
   L. leucocephala. Phytophagous insects, natural enemies, and pollinators
   were quantified fortnightly in 20 trees for 2 yr. North-facing tree
   branches had the greatest numbers of phytophagous insects, natural
   enemies, and pollinators. Branches facing west had the most species-rich
   and biodiverse phytophagous and pollinator assemblages, whereas for
   natural enemies, species richness and biodiversity were greatest on
   branches facing north or south. The greatest numbers of individuals and
   highest levels of species richness of phytophagous insects, natural
   enemies, and pollinators were observed in the upper and middle parts of
   the L. leucocephala canopy. The most individuals and highest levels of
   species richness and biodiversity for phytophagous insects, natural
   enemies, and pollinators were observed on the abaxial face of L.
   leucocephala leaves. The species with the highest abundance and
   k-dominance (common or constant species) on L. leucocephala trees were
   the phytophagous insects Trigona spinipes F. (Hymenoptera: Apidae:
   Meliponinae) and Tropidacris collaris Stoll (Orthoptera: Romaleidae) and
   the natural enemies Camponotus sp. 2 (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and
   Brachymyrmex sp. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). These results can inform
   strategies related to pest control and maintenance of natural enemies
   and pollinators in L. leucocephala plantations. Biopesticide
   application, for example, may be more effective at eliminating target
   organisms if directly applied on their preferred sites, and a targeted
   application can minimize negative effects for non-target organisms.},

Abstract = {Many introduced species can co-exist within the same ecosystem and
   sometimes interact with each other. Under such situations, eradication
   of one species may cause unexpected negative effects. Nakoudo-jima in
   the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands is an oceanic island that had feral goats
   that were introduced in the 1880s, but eradicated in 1999. Following
   their eradication, the alien invasive shrub Leucaena leucocephala
   (Fabaceae) was predicted to increase drastically. In this study, we
   tested the hypothesis that the eradication of feral goats enhanced the
   expansion of L.leucocephala using four time-series aerial photographs
   and validation work based on current field surveys of Nakoudo-jima. Our
   results showed that following feral goat elimination, bare ground areas
   decreased and forest cover increased. This was particularly true of
   areas dominated by L.leucocephala. Thus, feral goats appear to have
   limited the expansion of L.leucocephala on Nakoudo-jima. Grassland cover
   also increased following feral goat elimination, but this may have
   occurred prior to L.leucocephala expansion. These results suggest that
   L.leucocephala-dominated forest might invade grassland areas and that
   grasslands may have mediated the expansion of L.leucocephala after feral
   goat elimination. Future management of L.leucocephala should target the
   species in the high-risk expansion zones adjacent to grasslands.},

Abstract = {Goats fed Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) at an experimental site in
   Thailand were shown to be excreting DHP in their urine. This was
   unexpected as earlier results from another site had shown that goats and
   cattle fed leucaena did not excrete DHP and so possessed DHP-degrading
   bacteria. Goats sampled near the earlier sample site excreted no DHP in
   their urine. Rumen fluid taken from these goats was successfully used to
   transfer DHP-degrading ability to the goats at the Experimental site
   some 350 km away that did not show the presence of DHP-degrading
   bacteria. Degradation of mimosine in-vitro and excretion of DHP in the
   urine ceased 72 hr after addition of rumen fluid and infusion with rumen
   fluid from protected goats, respectively. The situation in Thailand may
   not be unique. Countries where leucaena is fed should check that animals
   are protected. Fortunately, the ferric chloride urine test is simple to
   use and effective in detecting the problem and also the recovery after
   transfer of rumen fluid from protected animals.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) was introduced to
   Ethiopia in the early 1980s. Even though this plant is not yet
   problematic, nor categorized as an invasive species in the country,
   there are several reports that place leucaena as an extremely damaging
   weed elsewhere, raising warning signs regarding the potential impacts of
   the plant in Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to make a
   preliminary assessment of the impact of a pre-dispersal seed feeding
   bruchid associated with L. leucocephala and determine its impacts on
   seed germination in Ethiopia. The study demonstrated that the bruchid
   Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae) was present
   at all sites surveyed and damaged up to 44 \% of seeds of L.
   leucocephala at the study sites. Damaged seeds showed reduced
   germination performance resulting in seedlings with weak, yellow and
   fragile root systems compared to healthy seeds. This is the first report
   on the presence of A. macrophthalmus in Ethiopia. Therefore, future
   studies need to focus on the level of infestations of the plant and the
   impacts of the plant across the country.},

Abstract = {Three cattle fattening systems were assessed with experimental data of

   intensive rotational grazing (24 paddocks) in 3.89 ha of grasses; b)
   rotational grazing (24 paddocks) in 3.84 ha of grasses and 2.4 ha of
   Leucaena leucocephala; c) traditional rotational grazing (4 paddocks)
   with 6.2 ha of grass and free access to 2.66 ha of leucaena. Each system
   had only one group of 20, 19 and 27 animals (3/4 Holstein x 1/4 Zebu),
   respectively with an initial liveweight of 157 kg. For each system,
   total expenses,value of production, profit, cost/animal and per ha and
   the benefit cost ratio, were estimated. Costs of each kg of liveweight
   were statistically assessed through a simple classification method.
   There were significant differences(P < 0.05) between systems. System c)
   showed the best monetary indices with profits higher than 4 000 Cuban
   pesos and the lowest cost/kg of liveweight and per animal (1.25 and
   500.49, respectively) and a benefit cost ratio of 1.36. There were
   monetary advantages of the 4 paddock system compared to the rotational
   system with 24 paddocks, because of lower exploitation expenses and
   better animal performance. Further long-term studies must be carried to
   reduce paddock coals in the systems using intensive rotational grazing
   without affecting animal performance.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala. (Lam.) de Wit, a traditional medicinal plant, has
   been reported among the ethnic communities of Mexico, Indonesia, China,
   and India for the treatment of diabetes, obesity, and related
   complications. This study investigates the antihyperglycemic activity of
   the plant and its isolated active compound quercetin-3-glucoside.
   Further, bioactivity guided marker assisted development of an enriched
   bioactive fraction toward enhancing insulin sensitization was carried
   out. The enriched fraction was also found to contain 397.96 mg/g of
   quercetin-3-glucoside along with three other marker compounds, which
   were also isolated and identified. Quercetin-3-glucoside, out of the
   four isolated marker compounds from the plant, showed the most
   significant bioactivity when tested in palmitate-induced
   insulin-resistant C2C12 myotubes. The compound also showed significant
   upregulation of sirtuin1 (SIRT1) followed by enhancement of
   insulin-dependent signaling molecules SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1-alpha and GLUT4
   translocation. Molecular dynamics studies showed the compound having
   stable interactions with the SIRT1 protein. SIRT1 upregulation has been
   associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle,
   increasing the glucose uptake by muscle cells. The prepared enriched
   fraction also modulated the SIRT1/AMPK/GLUT4 pathway. The findings of
   the present study may find future application toward the development of
   botanical or phytopharmaceutical drugs from the traditionally important
   plant L. leucocephala against type II diabetes.},

Abstract = {A considerable portion of the former dry and dry-transition-to-moist
   forests of Puerto Rico dominated by Bucida buceras L. was transformed by
   land clearing and periodic fires to tall grasslands dominated by
   Urochloa maximum Jacq. and savannas with scattered small trees and
   shrubs. These communities, maintained by fires, are relatively stable
   and difficult to reforest. A study was carried out to test whether
   natural recolonization of forest species might be accelerated by
   excluding grazing livestock or by planting trees to facilitate natural
   succession. Experimental treatments included grazing exclusion and
   planting of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (giant variety) at 2 x 2
   m and 4 x 4 m, as well as an unprotected control. Tree growth,
   herbaceous aboveground biomass, and floristic diversity were monitored
   in experimental plots for 6 years. Floristic diversity (principally
   weedy species) increased during the first 3 years in grazed plots but
   decreased thereafter; biodiversity in grazing-protected plots decreased
   steadily over time. Herbaceous biomass remained fairly constant in
   grazed plots, increased gradually in protected plots, and decreased
   precipitously in planted plots after tree basal area surpassed 8
   m(2)/ha. The results of this study suggest that while the suppression of
   dominant grasses, either by controlled grazing or shading by planted
   trees can facilitate regeneration of native dry forest plant species,
   this process is both slow and uncertain on highly degraded sites, and
   likely to require decades before natural succession processes result in
   vegetation structure and species composition resembling that of native
   dry forest stands.},

Abstract = {Giant leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata) is an arboreal
   tree legume, which is widely grown as a source of high-protein fodder
   for animals. The goal of this research was to identify genes that are
   highly expressed in the foliage so that the yield and nutritional value
   of the foliage can be further enhanced in giant leucaena grown for
   fodder. Through microarray analysis of 10,000 cDNA, based on a
   transcriptome library of giant leucaena, 138 gene sequences were
   identified to be expressed highly in the foliage compared with the root.
   Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis validated the
   expression of 13 genes selected from the most highly expressed sequences
   in the foliage. These genes encoded proteins involved in the metabolism
   of starch, lipids, cell wall components and secondary metabolites such
   as beta -amyrin and mimosine. Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase and
   mimosinase are two of the most highly expressed genes in the foliage.
   Mimosinase is involved in recycling mimosine, which may be a storage
   molecule that is degraded to produce substrates for synthesis of amino
   acids and other metabolites. Some of the highly expressed genes
   identified in this study can be used in future breeding programs for
   enhancing fodder yield and quality of giant leucaena.},

Abstract = {Increasing the biodiversity of Leucaena leucocephala (hereafter
   leucaena) stands without losing the benefits provided by the forest
   structure is a challenge for adaptive management. Here, we report the
   survival and growth (height, stem, and canopy diameter) of five Atlantic
   Forest tree species planted underneath a pure stand of the exotic
   leucaena, which was broadcast sown 35 years before in a 0.6 ha area. Two
   treatments were compared: thinning (cutting all leucaena trees in 4-m
   wide rows, where seedlings were planted) and control (seedlings planted
   under leucaena canopy), with four replicates each (20 seedlings per
   plot, four per species, 2-m spaced). The five species selected were
   long-lived emergent trees from seasonal forests, with broad canopy,
   evergreen, and shade-tolerant. These traits were expected to allow their
   survival and growth, and, later on, to shade out the leucaena trees.
   Seven years after planting, survival was high for all species (around
   80\%), not differing between treatments or species. On average, stem
   diameter, height, and crown diameter were, respectively, 69, 44, and
   36\% higher in thinned than in control plots. Response to thinning
   differed between species in growth, with Gallesia integrifolia and
   Luehea divaricata standing out. Our results demonstrate that the species
   used for enrichment planting, selected by their suitable functional
   traits, can successfully survive under leucaena stands. Reducing
   competition by thinning, however, is crucial to enhance their growth.
   Despite the benefits from thinning, enrichment success strongly depends,
   therefore, on the abilities of the species selected to face the
   ecological filters acting on the target ecosystem.},

   females were crossbred Anglonubian the race, whose behavior in grazing
   was observed every ten minutes, from 8h to 17h. During the activities of
   the animals as rumination, idle, movement and grazing, was identified
   which the food supply if leucaena or herbaceous. Every two hours were
   measured bite rate, taking into account the time spent by the animals to
   carry out 20 arrests. For the evaluation of consumption was carried out
   grazing test in three days of paddock occupation. The grazing time was
   the most activity performed by animals with 7,34h and did not differ
   significantly (P>0.05) between the ages of regrowth, followed by travel
   times (1,36h), rumination (0,51h) and leisure (0,39h). There was no

Abstract = {High nitrogen (N2)-fixing potential is a desirable characteristic for
   any candidate hedgerow tree. Thus a study was conducted to evaluate
   Albizia lebbeck as a N2-fixing tree in comparison to Gliricidia sepium
   and Leucaena leucocephala currently used in alley cropping. Nitrogen
   fixation and utilization were assessed in a screenhouse at four months
   after planting by the N-15 dilution technique using Senna siamea as the
   non N2-fixing reference. A. lebbeck accumulated significantly more N
   than L. leucocephala, but G. sepium was intermediate. This superiority
   in N yield was mainly due to its abundant nodule dry weight production
   which accounted for up to 10.8\% of its total N. This was equivalent to
   2.5 and 6 fold that of Gliricidia and Leucaena nodules, respectively. A.
   lebbeck had bigger but significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05)
   lower number of nodules per plant than G. sepium, but it did not differ
   from Leucaena. Albizia was the best N2 fixer with 44\% Ndfa equivalent
   to 533 mg N per plant. G. sepium followed with 28\% Ndfa and L.
   leucocephala with 18\% Ndfa corresponding to 321 and 191 mg N fixed,
   respectively. However, the relatively higher N2 fixation in Albizia was
   not translated into higher N or dry matter yields. As A. lebbeck fixed
   more N, it depended less on soil N (49.8\%) than did Leucaena (72.5\%
   Ndfs) and Gliricidia (63.9\% Ndfs) and less on fertilizer N as well.
   Thus A. lebbeck appears to be a potential hedgerow species for alley
   cropping purpose.},

Abstract = {Sixteen accessions of Leucaena leucocephala, L. pallida and L.

   lines, L. diversifolia (K156) and its hybrid with L. Leucocephala (K8)
   exhibited moderate-high psyllid resistance, fast seedling growth, high
   dry matter production and cool tolerance. However, their forage quality,
   as indicated by in vitro dry matter digestibility and chemical
   composition, was inferior to that of L. leucocephala. Condensed tannin
   concentration, in particular, was higher in the non-L, leucocephala
   lines and this was associated with lower IVDMD and higher psyllid
   resistance. The implications for development of these lesser-known
   Leucaena species for forage use are discussed.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is a tropical forage legume suggested as an
   alternative method to control gastrointestinal parasitism in ruminants.
   This study: (1) performed a bio-guided fractionation of an aqueous
   extract of L. leucocephala using the egg hatch assay (EHA) to identify
   the anthelmintic (AH)-like phytochemicals present in fresh leaves, and
   (2) assessed the ultrastructural damage to eggs of Cooperia spp. after
   incubation with the final fraction. Phytochemicals were isolated using
   silica gel columns and identified using high performance liquid
   chromatography and standards for comparison. The final fraction was
   evaluated using EHA at 0.06, 0.125, 0.250, 0.500 and 1.1 mg ml(-1). The
   lethal concentration to inhibit 50\% of Cooperia spp. egg hatching
   (LC50) was calculated using a Probit analysis. Scanning and transmission
   electron microscopy revealed the ultrastructural changes present in
   Cooperia spp. eggs. Bio-guided isolation procedures led to the
   recognition of an active fraction (LlC1F3) mainly composed of quercetin
   (82.21\%) and caffeic acid (13.42\%) which inhibited 90.49 +/- 2.8\% of
   Cooperia spp. egg hatching (P < 0.05), and an LC50 of 0.06 +/- 0.14 mg
   ml(-1). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed eggs exposed to the
   active fraction had an irregular external layer with small projections
   and ruptures of lateral eggshell walls. Transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM) showed changes to Cooperia spp. eggs in electro-density, including
   the thickness of the eggshell layers and fractures after incubation with
   the final fraction (LIC1F3).
   Changes in bioactivity after purification suggest synergistic
   interactions between quercetin and caffeic acid. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), a leguminous shrub promising to cope
   with feed scarcity in the tropics, may help in mitigating ruminal
   methane (CH4) emission in the tropics as well. Two experiments were
   conducted to evaluate the effect of Leucaena and major secondary
   compounds of this plant in ruminants. At first, effects of Leucaena
   tannins and mimosine on ruminal CH4 and nutrient degradability were
   tested in vitro. Incubations were made with Leucaena without or with
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) to exclude the tannins effects, as well as
   with Bermuda grass (Tifton) and lucerne hays, both either untreated or
   supplemented with mimosine at the same concentration that has been
   provided by the tested Leucaena (6.52mg/g DM). Furthermore, in an in
   vivo experiment a control diet (perkg DM 700g Tifton hay) and Leucaena
   diets (perkg DM 350g Tifton hay and 350g Leucaena), either with or
   without 20g PEG/d per head, were evaluated in six Santa Ines sheep
   following a double Latin square design. In vitro, Leucaena resulted in
   the lowest (p<0.05) gas and CH4 production and the highest (p<0.05)
   partitioning factor, a measure for microbial efficiency, whereas the
   amount of truly degraded organic matter (TDOM) was lowest (p<0.05) with
   Tifton among the experimental forage plants. Mimosine addition to
   lucerne and Tifton as well as PEG addition to Leucaena had no effect on
   ruminal CH4 and TDOM. In vivo Leucaena, compared to the Tifton diet,
   enhanced (p<0.05) intake, faecal nitrogen excretion, body nitrogen
   retention and the excretion of urinary purine derivatives as an
   indicator for microbial protein synthesis and availability. This was
   independent of PEG addition. Leucaena also decreased (p<0.001) CH4
   emission per unit of digested organic matter by 14.1\% and 10.8\%,
   without and with PEG, respectively. No significant diet differences were
   observed in total-tract nutrient digestibility. The study demonstrated
   efficiency of Leucaena to mitigate in vivo methane emission of sheep,
   but did not reveal which constituent of Leucaena was primarily
   responsible for that since no clear efficiency of either tannins or
   mimosine could be demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Dried leaves of Leucaena leucocephala locally called subabool was mixed
   @ 20 and 40\% with dried fodder of Phaseolus aconitifolius, locally
   called moth chara. Two feeding trials were conducted on camel calves of
   Bikaneri breed (1 to 3 years old) for 4 and 6 months, respectively,
   under 20 and 40\% subabool in ration. The growth performance and thyroid
   status of the calves were compared with the controls maintained only on
   moth chara.
   Subabool fodder after initial rejection was readily consumed within 6-7
   days. The dry-matter consumption was 1.99 +/- 00.13 kg and 2.03 +/- 0.04
   kg per 100 kg live weight per day and average daily weight gain of 330.6
   +/- 24.67 and 258.3 +/- 27.57 g under 20\% and 40\% subabool ration,
   respectively, the feed conversion efficiency decreased with increasing
   level of subabool in ration Incorporation of 409\% subabool with moth
   chara increased CP, EE, CF and ash content but slightly decreased NFE
   and TDN. The intake of dry matter, digestible crude protein, total
   digestible nutrients and metabolizable energy were 21.6, 84.6, 11.4 and
   14.5\% higher, respectively, as compared to control. There was
   improvement in the digestibility coefficients of crude protein and crude
   fibre and depression in dry matter digestibility and NFE.
   The levels of T3 and T4 in the serum of calves were, respectively, 2.2
   +/- 0.09 and 83.6 +/- 3.41 (ng/ml) in controls and 2.3 +/- 0.09 and 77.8
   +/- 5.55 (ng/ml) under 40\% subabool ration. In general the ratio of T4
   and T3 was wider in the control calves.
   Subabool up to 40\% in the camel ration depressed feed conversion
   efficiency, and apparently did not exhibit any adverse influence on
   palatability, growth performance, thyroid status, hair and general
   health of camel calves.},

   or in association with G. sepium (G), L. leucocephala (L) or M.
   esculenta (M) given as pellets at 44\% of the daily ration. Daily

   emission was 47.1, 44.9, 33.3 and 33.5g/kg digestible organic matter
   intake for C, G, L and M, respectively, and was significantly lower
   (p<0.05) for L and M than for G and C. Our results confirm the potential
   of some TRP to reduce methane production. The strong decrease in methane

Abstract = {The present study was aimed at investigating the metabolic effects of

   was also higher (P = 0.082) in the EXP group. The net loss of bodyweight
   in the CON group (-1.21 kg) was reversed in EXP goats, which showed a
   net gain (+1.79 kg). The serum metabolic profile reflected a positive
   influence of iodine supplementation, which also induced greater (P <

   response was higher (P < 0.05) in the EXP group, whereas humoral

Abstract = {Fast growing, multi-purpose exotic trees are being introduced at a very
   rapid pace to meet an ever increasing demand for fuelwood and fodder.
   The possible interaction between the exotic species and the already
   existing naturalised species or natives needs to be quantified before
   the establishment of massive plantations takes place. This set of
   mixture trials involved evaluation of intra- and interspecific
   competition between and within fast growing Leucaena leucocephala
   (exotic) with the relatively slow growing Acacia nilotica (indigenous).
   An even aged mixed plantation in a hexagonal arrangement with varying
   proportions of the two species around an indicator or test tree was
   raised. Periodical observations revealed the quantitative changes in
   tree growth brought about by the serial manipulation of the neighbours
   of the indicator tree. In all the combinations, Leucaena exhibited
   profuse height growth, steady diameter increase, dense canopy and a high
   wood volume. Acacia, with a slow height growth, lesser diameter increase
   and bushy habit, exhibited suppressed growth, this effect increasing in
   combinations with an increased number of Leucaena. Such an intensively
   competitive combination of a fast growing exotic with a slow growing
   native would enhance the biomass production potential of the area but
   may eventually result in the elimination of the native trees. This
   warrants immediate attention, thoughtful selection and careful planning
   of exotics for large-scale introduction in afforestation programmes.},

   leucocephala (leucaena) either with or without urea or sucrose was fed
   for four periods of 15 days. During the last five days, digestibility
   was determined by total collection. There was no effect of
   supplementation on hay intake or total intake. Nitrogen digestibility
   was improved by supplementation with leucaena and urea. However, N
   balance was improved by leucaena supplementation, and addition of urea
   further improved this parameter. In contrast, supplementation with
   leucaena plus sucrose depressed the digestibility of NDF compared to the
   control and leucaena supplemented diet.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the simple and
   combined inoculation with three local rhizobia isolates (R1, R2 and R3)
   and two species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomus cubense
   -AMF1-and Claroideoglomus claroideum-AMF2-) on mycorrhizal colonization,
   nodulation, growth and biomass production of Leucaena leucocephala in a
   substrate with a close to neutral pH under greenhouse conditions.
   Thirteen treatments were evaluated in a completely randomized design
   with five replications. The inoculation and co-inoculation promoted
   greater plant growth with respect to the control without inoculation and
   to the fertilization treatment. Within the inoculation and
   co-inoculation treatments, one rhizobium isolate (R2) stood out for
   producing the highest plant height and leaflet production, while the R3
   + AMF1 and R3 + AMF2 combinations promoted the highest plant height, and
   also promoted higher biomass together with R1 + AMF1. In addition, the
   R3 + AMF2 combination stood out for presenting a high number of AMF
   spores, frequency and intensity by AMF colonization, and nodule
   activity. It is concluded that inoculation with local rhizobia isolates
   and their combination with AMF favors the development of mycorrhizal
   structures, nodulation, growth and biomass production of L. leucocephala
   grown in a substrate with neutral pH. Isolate R2 and the combination R3
   + AMF2 were identified as effective inoculants to increase plant growth.},

Year = {2002},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {90-96},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) was grown with 3 grasses: ruzi
   (Brachiaria ruziziensis), and dwarf napier and Taiwan A25 (both
   Pennisetum purpureum) under rainfed conditions in Thailand. The pastures
   were cut at 20, 30 and 40-day intervals for 840 days. Dwarf napier
   produced more total and leaf dry matter than Taiwan A25 and ruzi (P <
   0.05). Yield of all grass species increased with increasing cutting
   intervals. Leucaena yield was generally unaffected by cutting interval.
   However, at 40-day cutting intervals, leucaena dry matter yield was
   lower in the dwarf napier plots than in the ruzi and Taiwan A25 plots,
   which produced similar legume yields (P > 0.05). Growing leucaena with
   dwarf napier gave the lowest total legume dry matter yield (P > 0.05).
   Less frequent cutting increased total dry matter yields in all
   combinations through increases in grass yield. Maximum dry matter yield
   (41.5 t/ha) was produced by leucaena-dwarf napier.
   Dwarf napier produced herbage of higher quality than the other grass
   species in terms of crude protein concentration in both stems and leaves
   and had a higher leaf: stem ratio. Leucaena produced higher crude
   protein levels than grasses. The crude protein concentration in stems
   and leaves of all species decreased with increasing cutting intervals.
   Phosphorus concentrations in leucaena and associate grasses were similar
   and declined little with age. Leucaena was lower in potassium but higher
   in calcium concentration than the associated grasses.
   The results of this study are discussed in relation to the management of
   leucaena in mixed pastures for dairy production in Thailand.},

Abstract = {In agroforestry systems, loppings from trees and shrubs are commonly
   used, often as mulch, as sources of nutrients for interplanted crops.
   Therefore, it is important to understand the rates of mulch
   decomposition. This paper reports the results of a study on the
   decomposition and nitrogen (N)-mineralization patterns of the leaves,
   small twigs, and mulch (leaves plus twigs) of Leucaena leucocephala and
   Cassia siamea in a field experiment in an Alfisol in semiarid Kenya.
   Plant materials contained in 5mm nylon bags were placed below or on the
   soil surface in an alleycropping system involving the two tree species,
   with maize (Zea mays L.) as the intercrop. For plant materials of both
   species (except Leucaena leaves), there were two phases of
   decompositions: an initial rapid phase and a slower second one; Leucaena
   leaves had only a single phase. When placed below the soil surface, the
   decomposition rates of both Leucaena and Cassia mulch were similar
   (about 12\% week(-1) in the first phase and 1\% week(-1) in the second
   phase). When placed on the soil surface, Leucaena mulch decomposed 1.3
   times more rapidly than Cassia mulch in the first phase. The patterns of
   N release from the mulch of both species were similar to those of mass
   loss. In general, mulch-decomposition and N-release rates of both
   species were related more to their C:N ratios than to polyphenol
   contents; while C:N ratio predicted the rate of first (rapid) phase, the
   rate of the second (slow) phase appeared to be regulated by lignin and
   polyphenol contents.},

   imposed on fertilized and unfertilized plants after inoculation with

   stress lowered leaf water potential in all seedlings after 14 days of
   treatment. In inoculated seedlings, fertilized plants were more
   sensitive to water stress than unfertilized plants, as shown by a higher
   leaf water potential in plants of the latter treatment, Uninoculated and
   fertilized seedlings were most affected by water stress. This indicates
   that Rhizobium might increase stress tolerance in unfertilized seedlings
   at moderate water stress levels. The combined effects of water stress
   and applied fertilizers resulted in cessation of nitrogen fixation.
   Nitrogen fixation came to a complete stop after 22 days of water stress
   in fertilized seedlings. The different treatments were accompanied by
   anatomical changes of nodule structure, It is hypothesised that the leaf

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the inclusion of
   Leucaena leucocephala on dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility,
   nitrogen (N) balance and energy utilization in cattle fed a basal ration
   of Pennisetum purpureum and housed in metabolic crates. Five crossbred
   (Bos taurus x Bos indicus) heifers (SW: 295 +/- 6 kg) were fed chopped
   P. purpureum grass and five increasing levels of L. leucocephala (0, 20,
   40, 60 and 80\% of DM) in a 5 x 5 Latin square design. The intake of DM
   was similar (P > 0.05) among treatments, with an average of 7.03 kg of
   DM/day. While the crude protein intake (CPI) linearly increased (P <
   0.001) with the inclusion of L. leucocephala, the DM digestibility
   (average 492.3 g/kg DM) and OM digestibility (average 501.6 g/kg OM)
   were not affected (P > 0.05) by the incorporation of L. leucocephala
   into the ration. The N intake and excretion in the urine increased
   linearly (P = 0.0001, 0.0001) as the level of L. leucocephala in the
   ration increased. In addition, methane energy loss as a percentage of
   that in the control ration, was of only 61\% (P = 0.0005) with 80\%
   incorporation of L. leucocephala in the ration. We concluded that the
   inclusion of L. leucocephala has the capacity to reduce energy losses in
   the form of methane emissions. Nevertheless, the energy losses in the
   urine increased with the addition of L. leucocephala to the ration, with
   the optimal levels of incorporation in the ration fluctuating between 20
   and 40\% of the ration DM, which had no effects on the dry matter intake

Abstract = {The rhizobium-legume symbiosis is a model system for studying
   mutualistic interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes. Sinorhizobium
   sp. NGR234 is distinguished by its ability to form either indeterminate
   nodules or determinate nodules with diverse legumes. Here, we presented
   a high-resolution RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of NGR234 bacteroids
   in indeterminate nodules of Leucaena leucocephala and determinate
   nodules of Vigna unguiculata. In contrast to exponentially growing
   free-living bacteria, non-growing bacteroids from both legumes recruited
   several common cellular functions such as cbb3 oxidase, thiamine
   biosynthesis, nitrate reduction pathway (NO-producing), succinate
   metabolism, PHB (poly-3-hydroxybutyrate) biosynthesis and
   phosphate/phosphonate transporters. However, different transcription
   profiles between bacteroids from two legumes were also uncovered for
   genes involved in the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides,
   lipopolysaccharides, T3SS (type three secretion system) and effector
   proteins, cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase, PQQ (pyrroloquinoline
   quinone), cytochrome c550, pseudoazurin, biotin, phasins and glycolate
   oxidase, and in the metabolism of glutamate and phenylalanine.
   Noteworthy were the distinct expression patterns of genes encoding
   phasins, which are thought to be involved in regulating the
   surface/volume ratio of PHB granules. These patterns are in good
   agreement with the observed granule size difference between bacteroids
   from L. leucocephala and V. unguiculata.},

Abstract = {The productivity of leucaena, grown as a winter supplement to native
   pastures, was assessed over 6 growing seasons on a range of adjacent
   soil and topographic sites in subcoastal, south-east Queensland. Mean
   edible leucaena yield measured at the end of autumn reached a maximum of
   800 kg dm/ha after 3 growing seasons and did not change substantially
   over the following 3 seasons. Leucaena plant height increased
   progressively each year to a mean of 190 cm after 6 seasons. Highest
   yields were obtained on the alluvial and colluvial soils with potential
   rooting depths of 110-120 cm. Frosting was severe on these soils, but
   the leucaena still produced twice the edible yield of the leucaena on
   shallow basaltic and andestic soils where frosts were absent or
   infrequent. Leaf fall of leucaea during the summer/autumn growing
   seasons was equivalent to 30 to 40\% of the annual production. Most of
   the remaining leaf was lost during winter if frosts ocurred, or if
   winter rainfall was below average in the absence of frosting. These
   results indicate that rooting depth, incidence of frost and winter
   rainfall strongly influence the productivity of leucaena grown as a
   winter grazing supplement in south-east Queensland. It is recommended
   that, where possible, leucaena should be planted on deep, fertile soils
   in frost free locations.},

   Nitrogen accumulation and cycling in leucaena-signal grass pastures were

   Nitrogen pools in the grass, leucaena, soil, cattle liveweight, faeces

   The podzolic soil (pH 4.8-5.9) was found to be deficient in P, Ca and K.
   Leucaena leaf tissues contained deficient levels of N, P and Ca. Grass
   tissues were deficient in N and P.
   Grazing was found to cycle 65\% of N on offer in pasture herbage.
   However, due to the effect of the plant nutrient imbalances described
   above, biological N fixation by leucaena contributed only 15 kg/ha N to
   the pasture system over the 9-month regrowth period, of which 13 kg/ha N

Title = {Improving greenhouse gas emissions intensities of subtropical and

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {136},
Pages = {138-146},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a perennial legume shrub of
   subtropical regions that has forage characteristics favourable for
   livestock production, often delivering ruminant liveweight gains that
   are superior to most other forage systems. Recent work suggests that
   leucaena mitigates ruminant enteric methane emissions, implying that the
   shrub may also reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the whole farm
   level. However, the high crude protein content of leucaena relative to
   endemic grasses can increase livestock urine nitrogen concentration and
   may increase soil nitrous oxide emissions, potentially offsetting
   benefits of enteric methane mitigation.
   Here we examine the effects of leucaena on emissions, production and
   profitability at the whole farm level by modelling a property in
   northern Australia, assuming enterprises that specialise in cattle
   breeding and finishing. To contrast leucaena with a baseline property
   with Rhodes grass, we modelled three equivalent leucaena scenarios by
   matching (1) annual average stocking rate, (2) total liveweight
   production or (3) net farm emissions with that of the baseline, assuming
   all animals had access to leucaena.
   To maintain average annual stocking rate or liveweight production,
   scenarios 1 and 2 carried 5\% and 12\% less cattle than the baseline
   because animals on leucaena grew faster and had greater liveweight. In
   contrast, the number of animals carried and liveweight production in
   scenario 3 increased by 15\% and 31\% relative to the baseline,
   respectively, due to enteric methane abatement and greater liveweight
   gains. Grazing of leucaena increased soil nitrous oxide emissions by
   more than 38\% in all scenarios, but this did not substantially offset
   net emissions abatement because nitrous oxide constituted a far smaller
   proportion of emissions than did methane (<10\% and >90\%,
   respectively). In all scenarios, emissions intensity (net farm emissions
   per unit liveweight sold) caused by grazing leucaena was reduced by more
   than 23\% relative to baseline emissions intensities.
   This work shows that whilst income from carbon offsets associated with
   grazing leucaena is small, leucaena has significant potential to
   increase both animal production and gross margin, whilst reducing
   emissions intensity. Provided net farm emissions are maintained or
   reduced, these results suggest that leucaena is conducive to sustainable

Abstract = {Aboitic stress such as drought and salinity are class of major threats,
   which plants undergo through their lifetime. Lignin deposition is one of
   the responses to such abiotic stresses. The gene encoding Cinnamoyl CoA
   Reductase (CCR) is a key gene for lignin biosynthesis, which has been
   shown to be over-expressed under stress conditions. In the present
   study, developing seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala (Vernacular name:
   Subabul, White popinac) were treated with 1 \% mannitol and 200 mM NaCl
   to mimic drought and salinity stress conditions, respectively. Enzyme
   linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) based expression pattern of CCR
   protein was monitored coupled with Phlorogucinol/HCl activity staining
   of lignin in transverse sections of developing L. leucocephala seedlings
   under stress. Our result suggests a differential lignification pattern
   in developing root and stem under stress conditions. Increase in
   lignification was observed in mannitol treated stems and corresponding
   CCR protein accumulation was also higher than control and salt stress
   treated samples. On the contrary CCR protein was lower in NaCl treated
   stems and corresponding lignin deposition was also low. Developing root
   tissue showed a high level of CCR content and lignin deposition than
   stem samples under all conditions tested. Overall result suggested that
   lignin accumulation was not affected much in case of developing root
   however developing stems were significantly affected under drought and
   salinity stress condition.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of
   supplementation with fodder tree leaves on the utilization of teff
   straw. This was aimed at testing the hypothesis that forage supplements
   (e.g. sesbania) that disappear faster from the rumen compared with those
   that disappear slowly (eg. leucaena) may elicit higher intakes of the
   basal diet. Experiment 1 investigated the effect of level (i.e. 0, 200,
   300 and 400 g/kg dry matter (DM) intake) of leaves of Sesbania sesban or
   Leucaena leucocephala on the utilization of teff straw fed ad libitum.
   Seven sheep were given the seven diets in four periods following a
   partially balanced (7 x 4) cross-over design. In experiment 2, teff
   straw alone or supplemented with graded levels of sesbania (250, 350 and
   450 g/kg DM intake), were fed to 16 sheep in a completely randomized
   block design. Intake, degradability, nitrogen (N) utilization,
   particulate and liquid passage rates were estimated.
   In experiment 1, protein source X protein level interaction was not
   significant. Supplementation increased intakes of total DM (P < 0.05),
   organic matter (P < 0.01) and N retention (P < 0.01) but had no effect
   on the intake of teff straw. Supplementation with sesbania, but not with
   leucaena, increased (P < 0.05) the apparent digestibility of DM. Both
   supplements increased (P < 0.05) the fractional rate of passage from the
   rumen. In experiment 2, graded levels of sesbania increased DM intake (P
   < 0.05), fractional rate of liquid outflow (P < 0.05) and tended to
   increase the rate of degradation. It was concluded that the effect of
   fodder tree leaves on roughage intake is a function of their
   disappearance rate from the rumen.},

Abstract = {Green manures are an adequate alternative for improving the availability
   of nitrogen and phosphorus for crop nutrition, within a global context
   of decreasing soil fertility and the urgent need to care for the
   environment. Mixteca region, covers a wide area of central Mexico,
   characterized by a semi-arid climate, eroded calcareous soil, and rural
   poverty. With the aim of proposing technologies for improving soil
   quality and increasing the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus, an
   experiment was conducted using green manures: Canavalia ensiformis,
   Dolichos lablab, Leucaena leucocephala and Avena strigosa and Phaseolus
   vulgaris, that would ensure a balance between N and P release and the
   requirements of maize cultivation. The rate of enriched soil
   mineralization with green manures was determined through incubation,
   controlled for 15 days with CO2 emissions using an OxiTop OC110((R)) kit
   as an indicator of decomposition. CO2 emissions were greatest in the
   soil established with Leucaena leucocephala and least in the soil with
   no fertilizer, with emissions descending in the following order:
   Leucaena leucocephala > Canavalia ensiformis > Avena strigosa +Phaseolus
   vulgaris > Dolichos lablab > soil without green manure. It is assumed
   that a greater flow of CO2 is accompanied by greater mineralization and
   release of nutrients. The N-total in the soil treated with green manures
   was similar and greater than that of the soil without fertilizer. Soil
   treated with Avena strigosa+Phaseolus vulgaris contained the highest
   values of N-mineral (N-ammonium + N-nitrate). P-Olsen content in soils
   with green manures was double that of the soil without fertilizer.
   Incubation provided the opportunity of identifying those green manures
   with higher agronomic potential in the area under study. The biomass
   comprising Leucaena leucocephala leaves and tender stems constitute an
   alternative for improving soil by providing OM. However, when
   considering the availability of N and P, the Avena strigosa+Phaseolus
   vulgaris combination is a superior alternative for meeting the needs of
   maize cultivation.},

Abstract = {The AgNPs were synthesized using water-soluble polysaccharides extracted
   from the Leucaena leucocephala seeds. The UV-visible spectrum of the
   AgNPs showed a sharp absorption peak at 448 nm. The XRD analysis showed
   four major peaks of the crystalline AgNPs with planes of a face-centered
   cubic lattice of silver. The EDS spectrum showed a strong signal peak at
   \~{}3 keV. TEM and SEM observations showed the spherical shape of AgNPs
   with no particle agglomeration, and the size ranged from 8 to 20 nm.
   AgNPs were highly stable at -14.2 mV by zeta potential measurement.
   AgNPs showed significant anticancer activity against the cell lines of
   breast cancer, liver carcinoma, and colon carcinoma with the IC50 value
   of 22.5, 12.3, and 8.9 mu g mL(-1), respectively. AgNPs at 900 mu g
   mL(-1) exhibited considerable antifungal activity against ten fungal
   pathogens. Water-soluble polysaccharide has the ability to synthesize
   AgNPs keeping strong antitumor, antifungal activities. The AgNPs can
   slow down spoilage of composite milk samples at different temperatures.
   In addition, the accuracy of milk-IR-analyses was not affected by
   different concentrations of AgNPs.},

Abstract = {We show here that seed reserves in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.
   and Zea mays L. (maize) are important for mycorrhizal formation and
   seedling growth. Seed reserve removal reduced mycorrhizal formation
   markedly in Leucaena but not in maize, except at 15 and 45 days after
   seed reserve removal. Partial or total removal of seed reserves
   decreased plant growth and tissue nutrient concentrations in both hosts.
   Nodule number in Leucaena, which was related positively to plant biomass
   and mycorrhizal infection levels, was reduced when one or both
   cotyledons were severed. Leucaena seedlings without or with partial seed
   reserves had higher nutrient use efficiencies throughout seedling
   growth. But such an effect was observed only initially in maize. Seed
   reserve removal increased the specific absorption rates of nutrients in
   both hosts. Phosphorus absorption rate was significantly and positively
   related to root infection levels in both Leucaena and maize. Though the
   growth rates of plants without seed reserves were low initially, these
   plants had higher growth rates during later stages. We conclude that
   seed reserves are not only important for seedling growth, but also for
   mycorrhizal formation and nodulation.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) was evaluated as a feed for ruminants
   in the northern part of Nigeria. Thirty Yankasa rams were fed diets
   based on fresh Hyparrhenia rufa (hyparrhenia grass) with leucaena
   incorporated at 0 (control), 10, 20, 30 or 40\% (DM basis) of the total
   diet, and feed intake, liveweight change and feed efficiency were
   measured. Rams fed the control diet had the lowest feed intakes, when
   expressed per unit of metabolic live weight (63.5 g/kg LWT(0.75)/d), and
   lost weight (-2.4 g/d). Leucaena diets improved (P < 0.001) total feed
   intakes (68.6, 69.9, 71.8 and 75.5 g/kg LWT(0.75)/d; s.e.d. = 1.73) and

   daily liveweight gain (r = 0.90).
   One ram (fed 40\% leucaena) showed slight hair loss, but liveweight gain
   and feed intake were not depressed. It was concluded that inclusion of
   leucaena up to 40\% of the diet (DM basis) of Yankasa rams for 70 days
   will increase their performance without causing any significant clinical
   toxicity. The effect of inoculating with DHP-degrading rumen microflora

Abstract = {Growth and wood traits of Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata were
   compared with India's most widely grown pulpwood, Eucalyptus. Three
   Leucaena seedlots and sixty-four Leucaena clones selected in plantations
   established from two Indian land races and a Hawaiian seed source were
   tested together with five commercial E. camaldulensis clones at two
   contrasting sites in southern India. At the wetter, irrigated site, the
   three sources of Leucaena clones had significantly greater 4-year height
   and similar mean stem diameter to the Eucalyptus clones, while the
   Leucaena seedlots were slower-growing. At the semi-arid, rainfed site,
   Eucalyptus grew faster and had better survival than the three sources of
   Leucaena clones, which again were similar in their performance and
   superior to the Leucaena seedlots. Basic densities, determined from
   breast-height wood cores, of 4-year-old Leucaena and Eucalyptus were
   quite similar (568 and 534 kg m-3 respectively) at the irrigated site,
   but at the rainfed site Eucalyptus wood density was higher (590 kg m-3),
   while that of Leucaena was lower (508 kg m-3). The kraft pulp yield
   (KPY) of Leucaena clones was about 1.5 \% higher than Eucalyptus at both
   sites; KPYs of both species were 1.8 \% lower at the rainfed than the
   irrigated site. Leucaena fibres were 31 \% and 39 \% longer and 65 \%
   and 58 \% wider than Eucalyptus, at the irrigated and rainfed sites
   respectively, and had lower cell wall proportions. Differences among
   Leucaena clones were significant for growth traits and for most wood and
   fibre traits, indicating the potential for selecting fast-growing
   Leucaena clones with improved wood properties. Clonal Leucaena
   plantations can serve as a productive and complementary pulpwood crop to
   Eucalyptus in southern India, increasing the yield and strength of

Abstract = {Allelopathy has been considered a key mechanism to explain the
   invasiveness of some species. It is well known that invasive plants can
   affect native plants by producing novel allelochemicals but some exotic
   plant species may be also sensitive to allelochemicals released by
   native species, providing a tool to reduce growth and impacts of
   invasive exotic species. Here, using growth chamber experiments we
   tested the mutual potential allelopathic effects of Sesbania virgata (a
   native dominant species) and the alien Leucaena leucocephala seeds. S.
   virgata was unaffected by seed leachates of L. leucocephala, indicating
   that, under lab conditions, this legume presents resistance to the
   phytotoxic compounds produced by seeds of this alien species. In
   contrast, germination and seedling growth of L. leucocephala were
   strongly affected by the phytochemicals produced by seeds of S. virgata.
   A delay in endospermic mobilization of storage carbohydrates
   (raffinose-family oligosaccharides and galactomannan) was observed in
   the alien species. These potential allelopathic effects could not be
   attributed sole to the presence neither of the phytoxic catechin nor of
   ABA in seed leachates of S. virgata. Our findings indicate that the in
   vitro behavior of S. virgata is consistent with its aggressiveness in
   natural environment and suggest sesbanimide as a potential candidate as
   implicated in the noxious effects of S. virgata on the alien species.},

Abstract = {The nitrogen-fixing mimosid Leucaena leucocephala continues to be used
   for afforestation in degraded tropical forests. Yet, fast-growth and
   high drought stress tolerance enables L. leucocephala to outperform
   native species and L. leucocephala has been identified as one of the 100
   most invasive species globally. This warrants development of effective
   control measures, including bio-controls, to prevent the spread of this
   species particularly across tropical islands. Here, we compare
   differences in key functional traits between L. leucocephala and eight
   dominant native species (Bridelia tomentosa, Radermachera frondosa,
   Lepisanthes rubiginosa, Rhaphiolepis indica, Pterospermum heterophyllum,
   Fissistigma oldhamii, Psychotria rubra and Cudrania cochinchinensis) in
   L. leucocephala invaded tropical forests of Hainan Island, China.
   Functional traits related to growth (photosynthesis rate, stomatal
   conductance and transpiration rate) and drought stress tolerance (leaf
   turgor loss point) were measured in wet and dry seasons to investigate
   whether these functional traits differed between L. leucocephala and the
   eight dominant native species. Our results demonstrate that L.
   leucocephala has significantly increased growth rates (at least
   two-fold) in both wet and dry seasons. Additionally, L. leucocephala
   shows significantly higher drought stress tolerance (lower TLP) in the
   dry season. These results indicate that L. leucocephala would almost
   certainly outperform the eight dominant native species and might
   successfully invade Hainan tropical forests. There is an urgent need to
   identify native species that have similar growth and drought stress
   tolerance traits to enable the development of effective strategies to
   control L. leucocephala on Hainan Island.},

   were artificially wounded, and after 6, 12, 24 and 48h, the leaves were
   collected for protein extraction. Quantitative and qualitative analyses
   of the proteins were performed. The protein content and peroxidase and
   protease activities increased 12h after wounding, and the acaricidal
   activity of this protein extract was evaluated using engorged R. (B.)
   microplus females. The protein extract obtained after wounding reduced
   egg production (8.5\%) compared to those without wounding. Furthermore,
   the extract reduced egg hatching by 47.7\% and showed an overall
   efficacy of 56.3\% at 0.1 mgP/mL of the protein. We demonstrated that L.

   Invaders', the plant in South Africa is an incipient or `emerging weed',
   with infestations mostly occurring in the eastern subtropical regions of
   the country. Deliberate biological control efforts have been confined to
   South Africa, although these have been opportunistic, unfunded and,
   given the plant's propensity for prolific seed production, have focused
   exclusively on the seed beetle, Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus
   (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae). Following confirmation of host
   specificity, and after several low-intensity releases, the beetle has
   become widely established in KwaZulu-Natal, where releases were mostly
   made, but also in Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the North West provinces. A
   sap-sucking psyllid, Heteropsylla cubana Crawford (Psyllidae), was
   inadvertently introduced into South Africa, but has not had any impact
   on weed infestations. The biological control programme against L.
   leucocephala in South Africa is reviewed, including: (i) aspects of the
   target plant that are pertinent to its invasiveness and management; (ii)
   details pertaining to the two natural enemies that have featured so far;
   (iii) progress that has been achieved; and (iv) the direction of future
   research efforts.},

Abstract = {The study was carried out between July and October 2022 at the
   sub-station of the Faculty of Agriculture Research and Teaching farm to
   assess the reproductive performance of Archachatina marginata fed the
   leguminous Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal as feed additive. 208 adult
   snails were randomly partitioned into 4 treatments and 4 repetitions of
   13 comparable snails (weight and size). The treatment T0 0 (control)
   received only the experimental diet as described while three other
   treatments received not only diet but, L. leucocephala leaf meal at
   0.25\%, 0.5\% and 0.75\% for a period of 12 weeks. In each treatment,
   every morning, the substrate of each breeding bucket was stirred
   entirely and minutely to collect the eggs to determine the laying and
   morphometric characteristics of the eggs. The eggs were then placed 10
   cm deep in loose soil substrates until hatching to evaluate the
   characteristics of the fecundity. The unhatched eggs were opened, and
   the state of embryonic development observed to determine early embryonic
   mortality rate and late embryonic mortality. At the end of the
   experiment, animals of each replicate were sacrificed; the hemolymph was
   collected determine the total cholesterol and protein. The results
   showed that the characteristics of reproduction were affected with
   graded level of L. leucocephala. . The highest number of eggs laid
   (17.29 +/- 13.44) and the number of clutches (268.91) was recorded in
   animals receiving 0.5\% and 0.75\% L. leucocephala in the diet
   respectively while the highest value of fecundation rate (95.50 +/-
   8.80), hatch rate (94.55 +/- 9.36), and hatchability (98.99 +/- 3.15)
   was registered in the treatment that received 0.75\%. The highest value
   of total protein and cholesterol was recorded in the same treatment. In
   conclusion 0.75\% of L. leucocephala can be added in the diet of adult
   snail to increase its reproductive performance.},

Abstract = {A 56-day feeding trial was conducted to evaluate forage legumes
   (Medicago saliva, Dolichos lablab, Leucaena leucocephala and Desmanthus
   bicornutus) as protein supplements to a sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor)
   diet based on growth and feed performance of growing goats. Twenty-four
   castrated kids were used in the experiment with an average initial age
   of 135 days and body weight of 18.7 kg. Kids were Boer x Spanish
   crossbreds. Four dietary treatments were composed of sudangrass (60\% of
   diet offered) supplemented with one of four forage legumes (40\% of diet
   offered) and corn (0.2 kg/day). A split-plot design was employed with
   diet as the main plot, pens as experimental units (consisting of three
   pens per diet as replicates) and goats as samples (two goats per pen).
   Fixed effects of breed type, litter size born, parity of dam and initial
   age of kid as a linear covariate were added to the model for growth
   traits. All forage legumes had over 20\% crude protein (CP). Final body
   weight was not affected by diet (P > 0.05). Average daily gain (ADG)
   tended (P < 0.10) to be more rapid for goats fed leucaena compared to
   desmanthus (least squares means of 93.9 and 60.9 g/day, respectively).
   Voluntary daily feed intakes of sudangrass and alfalfa were higher by 22
   and 33 g (P < 0.01 and < 0.001) per goat for pens receiving alfalfa with
   sudangrass compared to combined mean intakes of pens fed experimental
   forage legumes. Intake of leucaena compared to desmanthus forage was
   higher by 97 g/day (P < 0.001), demonstrating relatively poorer
   acceptability of desmanthus. Also, goats fed leucaena had better (P <
   0.05) gain efficiency (ADG/total feed intake) compared to goats fed
   desmanthus. Experimental results suggest that L. leucocephala had more
   potential for feeding growing goats in tropical regions compared to the
   other forage legumes evaluated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The effect of supplementation with three levels of Leucaena leucocephala
   leaf meal (LLM) added to a diet composed of cotton seed hulls (CSH) and
   maize bran (MB) on milk yield, milk composition and body weight changes
   of grazing lactating cows was studied in a completely randomised design.
   Marginal product analysis for the different levels of LLM as a
   substitute to cotton seed cake (CSC) was also calculated. The following
   treatment diets were used in the experiment: Diet 1, (control) composed
   of 1.8 kg DM CSH and 1.8 kg DM MB. Diet 2, 3 and 4 had an addition of
   1.2, 2.0 and 2.6 kg DM of LLM respectively. Diet 5 was composed of 1.8
   kg DM of CSC and 1.8 kg DM of MB. Treatments, number of lactations, farm
   and initial milk yields significantly (P < 0.01) influenced milk
   production. LLM supplementation to grazing cows significantly increased
   milk production, weight gain and milk composition (P > 0.05). Cows on
   treatment 1 achieved no significant (P < 0.05) increase in milk yield
   compared to cows on treatment 2, 3, 4 and 5 which attained net milk
   increase of 3.6, 4.1, 6.7 and 4.4 litres/cow/day respectively. There was
   no significant (P > 0.05) difference in net milk produced by cows on
   treatment 2, 3 and 5 compared to treatment 1. LLM supplementation
   significantly (P < 0.05) increased total solids (TS) in milk compared to
   that of cows under control, but there was no significant (P > 0.05)
   influence on milk crude protein (CP), butter fat (BF), solids not fat
   (SNF) and ash in all the diets. Body weight was significantly (P < 0.05)
   increased by LLM supplementation. Degradation coefficients of the
   treatment diets were high and varied significantly (P < 0.01) and had an
   influence on the metabolizable energy value of the treatment diets. Cows
   on diet 2 to 4 had a weight gain of 190.9, 101.8 and 80.9 g/cow/day
   respectively and cows on diet 5 attained the highest weight gain (234.5
   g/cow/day). Diet 4 had the highest marginal productivity of 4.3 followed
   by diets 2, 3 and 1 with marginal productivities of 2.8, 0.6 and 0
   respectively. It was therefore, concluded that the optimal
   supplementation level using LLM as a substitute for the more expensive
   CSC was diet 4.},

   (DMI), and on in vivo digestibility of the dry matter (DMD), neutral
   detergent fiber (NDFD), crude protein (CPD) and acid detergent fiber
   (ADFD). Dry matter and nutrient digestibility was measured with the
   total collection technique using lambs in individual pens. Dry matter
   intake was greater (P < 0.05) as the proportion of legume In the diets
   increased (1.00, 1.30 and 1.46\% kg/d at 10, 20 and 40\% of legume,
   respectively). Between the two legume species evaluated, DMI was greater
   in animals fed with Stylosanthes guianensis (1.30 kg/d) than in animals
   fed with Leucaena leucocephala (1.16 kg/d). There were significant
   differences between the legume species in digestibility of the main feed
   components except crude protein. The mean values obtained for the diets
   with Leucaena leucocephala and Stylosanthes guianensis were DMD, 61.88

   constituted 40\% of the dry matter, there was an increase in DMD
   (63.8\%), NDFD (63.5\%) and ADFD (48 6\%), but not in CPD (71.1\%). It
   is concluded that the utilization of legume species, as a complement to

Abstract = {Multifunctional leguminous trees like Gliricidia sepium Jacq. (Steud.)
   and Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (de Wit) are ideal for sustainable
   agro-ecological farming systems. They are commonly used in alley
   cropping to provide a sustainable source of nitrogen to cultivated crops
   or in silvopastoral systems where the leaves are used as livestock feed.
   However, these plants produce fruits that are not widely used. This
   study evaluated the nutritive value of mature fruits from G. sepium and
   L. leucocephala plants to determine their potential as supplemental
   feedstuffs for ruminants. Mature fruits were collected from 15 plants of
   each species and evaluated for crude protein (CP), total digestible
   nutrients (TDN), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber
   (ADF), lignin, non-fiber carbohydrates, total digestible nutrients,
   minerals, phytochemicals, in-vitro ruminal dry matter degradability
   (IVDMD) and 48-h (h) in-vitro ruminal organic matter digestibility
   (IVOMD). The concentration of CP (242 g/kg DM) was approximately 28\%
   higher in G. sepium fruits. The TDN (552 g/kg DM), NDF (560.1 g/kg DM)
   and 48-h IVOMD (590 g/kg) were superior in L. leucocephala fruits.
   Similarly, L. leucocephala fruits had significantly higher minerals
   (i.e., calcium, magnesium, potassium, among others). However, G. sepium
   fruits had lower concentrations of soluble and insoluble condensed
   tannins and mimosine. The immediately degradable fraction (265.9 g/kg
   DM), potential degradability (621.6 g/kg DM), and effective
   degradability (438.9 g/kg DM) values were higher in L. leucocephala
   fruits. We concluded that mature fruits of G. sepium plant may be a
   better protein supplement for poor quality grass forages than L.
   leucocephala because of higher CP and lower phytochemicals contents.},

Abstract = {yy The introduction of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), apart from
   increasing animal production, improves soil fertility through biological
   nitrogen (N) fixation and its deep-rooted system. There is limited
   information on carbon and N dynamics in hedgerow silvopastoral systems,
   particularly in the subsoil profile. The concentrations and vertical
   distribution of organic carbon (OC) and total N, and their fractions
   (particulate and associate forms) in the profile (0-100 cm) of a
   4-year-old leucaena stand in a Urochloa brizantha-Chloris gayana pasture
   were compared with those in the adjacent pure tropical grass (U.
   brizantha) pasture. Leucaena introduction increased the OC concentration
   in the subsoil (20-100 cm) by 45\%, particularly the stable form
   (associate OC) in the deepest horizon (50-100 cm). This was attributed
   to a greater abundance of leucaena roots deeper in the profile than for
   grass. Leucaena also enhanced by 7.6\% the N concentration (from 0.131
   to 0.141\%) in the topsoil (0-20 cm) associated with an increment in the
   labile form (particulate organic N), due to leaf deposition, recycling
   of animal feces and nodule-N turnover from N fixation. Leucaena
   establishment has the potential to improve soil fertility and hence
   availability of N to companion grass growth, and can be utilized as a
   greenhouse gas mitigation strategy.},

Abstract = {We investigated the influence of seed-feeding beetles (Chrysomelidae,
   Bruchinae) and their parasitoids on the germination performance of two
   Fabaceae, Leucaena leucocephala and Senna multijuga. We collected 150
   fruits per species in forest fragments in the city of Lavras, Minas
   Gerais, Brazil, between July and August 2020. Seeds were examined and
   separated into predated and non-predated categories. The predated
   category was divided into two subcategories: predated by Coleoptera
   (Bruchinae) (PCO) and predated in the presence of Coleoptera parasitoids
   (PARCO). The non-predated category was divided into artificially injured
   (AI), intact seeds without insect infestation (IS), and intact seeds
   with insect infestation (SIF). Seeds of S. multijuga and L. leucocephala
   germinated to 40\% and 30\%, respectively. PCO and PARCO seeds not only
   had a negative and restricting influence on S. multijuga germination (no
   germination) but also contributed to a large proportion of non-viable
   predated seeds (38\%). PCO (7\%) and PARCO (23\%), on the other hand,
   improved L. leucocephala germination. This work represents one of the
   first attempt to evaluate the parasitoid effect on seeds germination.
   Our results contribute to a better understanding of the effect of
   herbivore predation and the presence of parasitoids on host plant seed
   germination, which can be critical to mother plant fitness depending on
   plant species. Further studies are necessary to determine the extend
   seed consumption by beetles and the presence of their parasitoids may
   facilitate or impair seed germination, and consequently plant fitness in
   other systems.},

   sunflower, and cottonseed. No significant differences were revealed in
   body condition score, bodyweight change, milk yield and milk
   composition, such as milk fat (\%), milk lactose (\%), somatic cell
   count (x 10(3) cells/mL) and milk protein (\%) during the entire
   lactation period. In contrast, goats fed the TMR with Leucaena hay had a
   lower milk urea nitrogen (mg nitrogen/dL) level than those fed the
   control diet (with OSCM). It was concluded that replacing a proportion
   of oilseed cake meal with Leucaena in Saanen milk goats fed TMR does not
   negatively influence milk production and composition.},

Abstract = {The consumption of legume seeds has benefits for human nutrition and
   health. Seeds of Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena esculenta are
   fast-growing legumes that are used for a variety of purposes. In
   general, they are used to preserve/restore the soil; the foliage can be
   used as fodder for livestock and the seeds for human consumption in
   rural populations. Leucaena seeds are a source of nutrition, since they
   contain proteins, carbohydrates and lipids (including omega 3, 6 and 9
   unsaturated acids). The protein fraction has shown pharmaceutical
   effects of interest (analgesic, lipolytic, emollient, anticancer,
   anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant and anti-diabetic) and some
   techno-functional properties for the food industry. However, the main
   limitation to the human consumption of leucaena seeds is the presence of
   mimosine, an antinutrient that produces side effects such as alopecia,
   growth retardation, cataracts and infertility in animals. In this sense,
   some technological processes that could contribute to its decrease. This
   work was carried out at the Nutraceuticals Department of the
   Interdisciplinary Research Center for Integral Regional Development,
   Oaxaca Unit, Mexico. A comprehensive and integrative review of research
   work carried out in different parts of the world was conducted. The
   bibliographic search was carried out from January 2020 to January 2022.
   Several databases such as Scopus, Latindex, Dialnet, Redalyc.org, FAO
   and Academic Google were explored. A total of 81 documents were used to
   prepare this review document. This review integrates aspects related to
   the potential use of leucaena seeds in human nutrition: nutritional
   composition, pharmacological, techno-functional properties, the
   processes to improve digestibility and reduce toxicity.},

Title = {Performance, Rumen Microbial Community and Immune Status of Goat Kids
   Fed Leucaena leucocephala Post-weaning as Affected by Prenatal
   and Early Life Nutritional Interventions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala represents a local protein source in tropical
   ruminant diets. However, its full exploitation is impaired by mimosine,
   unless it is degraded by the rumen microbial community. Recently, the
   ruminal bacterial communities of newborns were persistently modified
   through prenatal or postnatal dietary interventions. Such early-life
   interventions might enhance adaptation of ruminants to Leucaena
   leucocephala, which was investigated using a 2 x 2 factorial design
   trial that tested both supplementation of L. leucocephala in the late
   pregnancy diet of goat does, and supplementation of live yeast to their
   newborns. The composition of ruminal bacteria, immune status, as well as
   organic matter digestibility (OMD) and performance of kids were studied
   during and after the intervention. Ten pregnant goats were divided into
   two groups: the D+ and D- groups, which either received or did not
   receive 30 g of L. leucocephala forage meal during the last 7 +/- 0.5
   weeks of gestation. Twins from each goat were divided into the K+ and K-
   group (supplemented with or without 0.2 g/d of live yeast from day 3
   until weaning at 8 weeks). Rumen samples were collected from 4-, 8-,
   14-, and 20-weeks old kids to assess the bacterial community, while
   immune parameters (white blood cells, immunoglobulin M and G, and
   chitotriosidase activity) were measured in blood and saliva sampled at
   4-, 8-, and 20-weeks. We found a stimulatory effect of the prenatal
   exposure on the post-weaning dry matter intake of the L. leucocephala
   supplemented diet, resulting in a higher daily gain and final body
   weight at 20 weeks in the D+ vs. D- group (406 vs. 370 g DM/d, 85.4 vs.
   78.6 g/d, and 15.2 vs. 13.8 kg, respectively). Moreover, Ruminococcus
   represented a greater proportion of the rumen bacterial community of the
   D+ vs. D- kids (5.1 vs. 1.6\%). Differences in the immune status were
   relatively small and not thought to be a driving factor of differences
   in animal performance. Furthermore, postnatal supplementation of live
   yeast favored maturation of the rumen bacterial community (i.e., greater
   abundance of Bacteroidetes, in particular Prevotella, and reduced
   abundance of Firmicutes) and protozoa colonization. Concomitantly, OMD
   was enhanced post-weaning, suggesting effects of the early-life
   intervention persisted and could have affected animal performance.},

Abstract = {The nutritive value of the leaves of three leguminous browse species

   with rumen fluid, including the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on

   gas production with G. sepium producing the highest volume of gas. The
   addition of PEG caused a significant increase in the volume of gas
   produced by all three browse species (P<0.01), indicating that they all
   contain phenolic compounds which could have anti-nutritive properties.
   Measurements of in sacco DM degradability showed that 24 h rumen DM
   degradability for G. sepium, L. leucocephala and C. cajan is 62.86,
   55.25 and 55.63\%, respectively. G. sepium had statistically higher DM

Abstract = {The performance of Leucaena leucocephala protein banks associated with
   Panicum maximum was studied for two years (cycles I and II) without
   fertilization and irrigation. The treatments were: protein banks with
   free access to 50\% of the grassland sown with an association of
   Leucaena and guinea grass and stocking rates of 2 and 3 animals/ha and
   with free access to protein banks, but with 30\% of the grassland sown
   with leucaena and guinea grass and 2 animals/ha. A random block design
   with 2 replications with used. The system of 3 animals/ha with 50\% of
   the area covered by leucaena showed lower availability (P < 0.01), while
   the most uniform system was with 2 animals/ha and a similar proportion
   of the association sown. In the dry period the treatment with 30\% of
   legumes caused a longer permanence of the animals in the part of the
   paddock and affected the grass availability of the associated area. The
   animals dedicated 11\% of their time grazing leucaena, 53\% to the
   associated grass and 36\% to the non-associated grass. The protein bank
   with 50\% of the area covered and a stocking rate of 3 animals/ha showed
   a lower protein production and higher when only 2 animals/ha were
   introduced to the same area. It is concluded that the protein bank
   system with free access and 50\% of the area of leucaena associated with
   guinea grass and 2 animals/ha is more uniform for grassland indices and
   animal production and constitutes an alternative for those zones under
   non-irrigated conditions and no N fertilization in grasses without
   legumes. Further studies should be carried out on grazing management of
   tropical regions and these systems.},

Abstract = {An efficient in vitro plant regeneration system in subabul (Leucaena
   leucocephala), a leguminous pulp wood tree species, was established. The
   induction of shoots was achieved from selected elite clones of subabul
   K-8, K-636 and also wild type on MS medium supplemented with 2\% sucrose
   and different concentrations (0.88 to 24.6 mu M) of plant growth
   regulators (BA, Kn, 2iP \& TDZ). The best medium for shoot regeneration
   was MS with 22.2 mu M BA (5 shoots per explant), followed by 22.7 mu M
   TDZ (4.6 shoots per explant). Addition of putriscine (9.3 mu M) to MS
   medium containing 22.2 mu M BA enhanced the number of multiple shoots to
   7-8 but not the frequency of response. Shoot initials (measuring 1 cm)
   when separated and transferred on to MS medium containing 1.4 mu M GA(3)
   elongated to 2-5 cm in 15.20 d with 80\% frequency. The per cent
   frequency of shoot differentiation was almost identical in the genotypes
   K-8 and K-636 but it differed significantly from the wild type. Leaf
   yellowing and abscission in all the genotypes was curtailed by
   supplementing the medium with 685 mu M glutamine or 540 mu M adenine.
   The excised shoots were transferred to root regeneration media
   containing 2.46 and 4.98 mu M IBA or 2.6 and 5.3 mu M NAA. Root
   regeneration was noticed with 100\% frequency in all the three genotypes
   in presence of IBA or NAA. Plantlets were transferred successfully to
   the pots with 70\% survival rate with no visible morphological
   variations. The protocol can be utilized for mass propagation and
   genetic transformation studies of this important pulpwood species.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess the effect of four energy supplements
   (two highly fermentable; two starch-based carbohydrates) on blood urea
   nitrogen (BUN), urinary urea excretion, and milk yield, in dual-purpose
   cows fed foliage of Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena). Five Holstein-Zebu
   cows with 450 kg body weight in their second third of lactation were
   used in a 5 x 5 Latin square design. Cows were fed (dry basis) a mixture
   of 45\% Leucaena and 55\% Pennisetum purpureum grass. Treatments were
   supplementation with (i) sugarcane molasses (Mo), (ii) sorghum grain
   (So), (iii) fresh citrus pulp (CitP) or (iv) rice polishing (RP), all of
   them incorporated into the diet at 25 MJ of ME/cow/day. There was a
   control group (Cont) without energy supplementation. The study comprised
   five periods of 20 days (15 days adaptation, 5 days measurements). Dry
   matter intake (kg/day) was lower (P < 0.05) for Cont (9.4) compared with
   Mo (12.1), So (12.0), CitP (11.9) and RP (11.9) but no difference was
   observed among energy supplements (P > 0.05). Milk yield (kg/day) was
   higher (P < 0.05) in cows supplemented with starch supplements (4.7 for
   So; 4.9 for RP) compared with Cont (3.3). Milk yield from highly
   fermentable supplements (Mo and CitP) did not differ (P > 0.05) from
   Cont or other treatments. Milk protein, fat and lactose were not
   different among treatments (P > 0.05). Blood urea nitrogen and urinary
   urea excretion were both reduced (P < 0.05) by energy supplementation.
   Urinary urea excretion was not different (P > 0.05) among cows fed
   different sources of energy. It is concluded that in dual-purpose cows
   fed Leucaena foliage, supplementation with sugarcane molasses, citrus
   pulp or rice polishing reduced blood urea nitrogen and urinary urea
   excretion. Milk yield was increased by sorghum and rice polishing
   whereas energy supplementation did not affect milk composition.},

Abstract = {Understanding belowground morphological mechanisms of trees and grasses
   is a complicated task but can help in the design and management of
   silvopastoral systems. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the
   harvest intervals (i.e. 30 and 50 days) of aboveground biomass on the
   fine root density and vertical distribution in two silvopastoral systems
   (SPS): one comprising Leucaena leucocephala (legume tree) and Cynodon
   plectostachyus (grass) and the other L. leucocephala and Panicum
   maximum. We used a completely randomized design with four repetitions.
   We sampled fine roots by using a metal cylinder (8 cm diameter and 50 cm
   length) 7 days after each harvest. We washed the samples with
   pressurized water to separate them from the soil. The roots were
   digitalized at a resolution of 600 dpi to determine the diameter and
   specific root length by using IJ Rhizo (R) software. Samples were
   subsequently dried to quantify fine root mass. We found that the greater
   percentages of fine roots were between 0.4 and 0.8 mm for the legume and
   between 0.2 and 0.4 mm for grasses. The fine root length and mass
   density of P. maximum was higher (P < 0.001) compared to C.
   plectostachyus in both harvest intervals. However, the fine root density
   of L. leucocephala did not vary between SPS (P > 0.05). The effect of
   harvest interval was significant only in some soil layers in both SPS (P
   > 0.05). Most of the pasture roots were found in the upper soil layer
   (0-20 cm), while L. leucocephala roots were present to deeper soil
   layers. We conclude that P. maximum has a greater rooting capacity and a
   more rapid recovery than C. plectostachyus, which has greater diameters
   and lower root density. However, L. leucocephala presented deeper and
   thicker fine roots in both SPS, which is a good indication of its
   belowground recovery capacity to aboveground disturbances.},

   (Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru)-guinea grass (Panicum maximum cv
   Likoni). A random block design was used with 5 replicates. The
   treatments consisted of leucaena-guinea grass interdopped with corn at
   15 and 40 d after the emergence of leucaena-guinea grass and
   leucaena-guinea without intercropping. The work was developed on a red
   ferralic soil. The sowing of leucaena and guinea grass was performed in
   the rainy season. The first was carried out in doble furrows 0.7 in
   apart and at a distance of 3 in and at 0.5 m between plants. The grass
   was spread on the plot with a seed dosage of 0.5 kg/ha of PGS.
   Throughout the experiment, the weed development was controlled. The
   measurements were: population, plant height, yield of the species, and
   weed presence. The leucaena population was lower (P < 0.05) when
   intercropped with corn at 15 d after the germination of leucaena-gumea
   grass. The same situation occurred for the plant height. The population
   of guinea grass was lower (P < 0.01) with the intercropping at 40 d,
   whereas the plant height was better with no intercropping. The leucaena
   yield was lower (P < 0.01) for the intercropping at 15 d, while in
   guinea grass, this happened (P < 0.01) in the treatment with corn
   intercropping at 40 d. The joint analysis for the yield of
   leucaena-guinea grass-weed indicated a better result (P < 0.05) by not
   intercropping. The best grain production of grains and forages of the
   system was attained by intercropping corn at 15 d of germination of both
   components. It is recommended to encourage the silvopastoral systems
   using corn intercropping at 15 d after the germination of
   feucaena-guinea grass at the beginning of the rainy season.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala plantations in Kaoshu, southern Taiwan, exhibit,
   after several years of growth, a unique of pattern of weed exclusion
   beneath Leucaena canopy. The pattern has been observed in many Leucaena
   plantations in Taiwan and is particularly pronounced in the area where a
   substantial amount of Leucaena litter has accumulated on the ground.
   Field data showed that the phenomenon was primarily not due to physical
   competition involving light, soil moisture, pH, and nutrients. Instead,
   aqueous extracts of Leucaena fresh leaves, litter, soil, and seed
   exudate showed significantly phytotoxic effects on many test species,
   including rice, lettuce, Acacia confusa, Alnus formosana, Casuarina
   glauca, Liquidambar formosana, and Mimosa pudica. However, the extracts
   were not toxic to the growth of Leucaena seedlings. The decomposing
   leaves of Leucaena also suppressed the growth of the aforementioned
   plants grown in pots but did not inhibit that of Leucaena plants. By
   means of paper and thin-layer chromatography, UV-visible
   spectrophotometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography, 10
   phytotoxins were identified. They included mimosine, quercetin, and
   gallic, protocatechuic, p-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxyphenylacetic,
   vanillic, ferulic, caffeic, and p-coumaric acids. The mature leaves of
   Leucaena possess about 5\% dry weight of mimosine, the amount varying
   with varieties. The seed germination and radicle growth of lettuce,
   rice, and rye grass were significantly inhibited by aqueous mimosine
   solution at a concentration of 20 ppm, while that of the forest species
   mentioned was suppressed by the mimosine solution at 50 ppm or above.
   However, the growth of Miscanthus floridulus and Pinus taiwanensis was
   not suppressed by the mimosine solution at 200 ppm. The seedlings of
   Ageratum conyzoides died in mimosine solution at 50 ppm within seven
   days and wilted at 300 ppm within three days. It was concluded that the
   exclusion of understory plants was evidently due to the allopathic
   effect of compounds produced by Leucaena. The allelopathic pattern was
   clearly shown in the area with a heavy accumulation of Leuceana leaf
   litter, which was a result of drought and heavy wind influence.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the nutritional value of
   three leguminous trees heavily selected by goats in a xerophilous
   shrubland. Chemical composition and in vitro dry matter disappearance
   (IVDMD) of leaves and pods from leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala),
   mesquite (Prosopis laevigata), and huisache (Acacia farnesiana) is
   presented. Crude protein (CP) ranged from 17.3\% for leaves of huisache
   to 21.9\% for leucaena. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content ranged
   from 39.0 to 40.3 with no difference among fodder threes. Across tree
   species, mean IVDMD was 61.6\% for pods and 52.2\% for leaves. IVDMD for
   leaves was highest (p < 0.01) for leucaena (54.9\%) and lowest for
   huisache (47.3\%). Condensed tannins in an acetonic extract were highest
   for leaves of huisache (45.3 mg CE/g DM) and lowest for mesquite (25.9
   mg CE/g DM). Pods and leaves of huisache presented the highest number of
   secondary metabolites, mainly related to hydroxybenzoic acid and
   flavonols; leucaena and mesquite presented mainly flavonols and
   anthocyanins. It was concluded that leaves and pods of leucaena,
   mesquite, and huisache constitute valuable forages for ruminant
   livestock due to their low fiber, high CP levels, moderate in vitro
   fermentation characteristics and high mineral content.},

Abstract = {This research aimed to add evidence on the effect of white leadtree seed
   extract (Leucaena leucocephala) on postprandial blood glucose level on
   white male alloxan induced diabetic rats. This research was an
   experiment with pretest-posttest control group design. The subjects of
   this research were 25 white male rats, Wistar strain was divided into 5
   groups. Group I was the positive control, which was treated with
   Acarbose, group II was the negative control, and group III, group IV,
   and group V were treatment groups and were given white leadtree seed
   extract of 1.5 g/kg of BW, 3.5 g/kg of BW, and 7.8 g/kg of BW
   respectively. Blood glucose level was checked before and two hours after
   treatment. The statistical analysis used one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni
   post hoc test. The result showed that there were no significant
   differences between group III, group IV, and group V and the positive
   control group (p<0.05). The best result of inhibition of the increase in
   blood glucose level was found in 7.8 g/kg of BW (group V) dosage group
   with average difference of 186.4 mg/dl. In conclusion, white leadtree
   seed extract could decrease two hour postprandial blood glucose level in
   white male alloxan-induced diabetic rats and a dosage of 7.8 g/kg of BW
   was shown to be the most effective.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the establishment of the symbiosis between
   Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) under
   contaminated systems with naphtalene (NAF) and phenanthrene (FEN), as
   well as the physiological plants responses such as total content of
   phenolic compounds (CFT), total antioxidant activity (AAT) and the
   content of chlorophylls (CloroT) and carotenoids (CaT). After 31 days,
   NAF had more significant negative effects on nodulation by delaying the
   formation of nodules until the day 25 at 100 mg/L. In the presence of 20
   mg FEN/L, L. leucocephala plants did not show significant differences on
   the number of nodules when compared to the control, while nodulation
   decreased 52 \% at 60 and 100 mg FEN/L. Inoculation with R. tropici
   resulted in significant increases of PST (>150 \%) in comparison to
   non-inoculated plants. The foliar content of CFT was significantly
   greater at non-inoculated treatments in respect to those with R.
   tropici, and significantly higher in plants exposed to FEN than NAF. For
   both hydrocarbons, the concentration of 100 mg/L resulted in greater CFT
   and AAT when compared to 20 or 60 mg/L. For roots, treatments without
   contamination and R. tropici had more content of CFT and AAT. The AAT in
   nodules significantly increased due to NAF, while a significant
   reduction was observed in FEN treatments. Either NAF or FEN did not
   significantly affect the content of CloroT, although this content was
   significantly greater in plants with R. tropici than non-inoculated
   plants. The CaT content significantly increased at non-inoculated plants
   exposed to NAF and/or FEN.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Volume = {412},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {A novel micro-mesoporous activated carbon (SBL AC-700) is synthesized
   from subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) sawdust waste by direct
   single-stage physical activation at 700 degrees C for 1 h for carbon
   capture applications. The synthesized AC is characterized to explore
   various physiochemical properties like elemental composition, surface
   morphology and crystallinity, presence of functional groups, surface
   area, pore size, and pore volume. Additionally, emphasis is given to
   exploring the thermophysical aspects of the novel AC, the literature
   regarding which is scarce in the open domain. The CO2 adsorption study
   is carried out for a 0-1 bar pressure for temperatures ranging from 0 to
   75 degrees C. The analysis revealed that the AC possesses a surface area
   of 590 m2/g and pore volume and width of 0.27 cm3/g and 1.85 nm,
   corresponding to a 70\% microporosity with a well-developed porous
   structure. At 25 degrees C and 1 bar, a CO2 uptake of 40.54 cm3/g is
   achieved, corresponding to an increment of 6-202\% compared to other
   commercials, chemically and physically activated carbons. Moreover, SBL
   AC-700 has a thermal conductivity of 0.095 W/m K, 8-131\% higher than
   other benchmarks ACs and much lower specific heat of 0.82 kJ/kg K
   corresponding to lesser regeneration energy requirements. Experimental
   data are fitted with various isotherm models, i.e., Langmuir,
   Freundlich, Sips, R-P, and Toth, out of which R-P and Toth models
   exhibit the best fit. In continuation, adsorption kinetics is studied to
   explore the dynamic performance of the SBL AC-700 by using
   Pseudo-first-order, Pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle
   diffusion kinetic models.},

Abstract = {The woody legume Leucaena leucocephala (K-8) is useful for fuel and
   forage production in the sub-tropics and tropics. When planted on
   favorable sites L. leucocephala (K-8) has produced 22 Mg dry biomass
   ha-1. However, many investigators have observed that leucaena
   productivity is site-specific, growing best on well-drained and fertile
   soils. L. leucocephala (K-8) was planted on calcareous soils in 1982 at
   a site in Kingsville, TX. Biomass productivity ranged from 1.4 to 10 Mg
   ha-1 which was attributed to soil variability. Foliar macro- and
   micronutrient analyses were conducted for ten elements and soil
   phosphorus and pH were measured. Leaf P was found to be positively
   correlated with biomass production (r = 0.71, p = 0.002) as was leaf Mg
   (r = 0.57, p = 0.022). Leaf Ca (r = 0.55, p = 0.028) and Fe (r = 0.56, p
   = 0.024) were negatively correlated with biomass. The soil pH at 15-30
   cm (r = 0.60, p = 0.013) and 30-60 cm (r = 0.88, p = 0.0001) depths was
   negatively correlated with  biomass. Sodium bicarbonate-extractable P
   was not correlated with the leaf P or any other variables while 1:10
   water-extractable P was positively correlated with Fe and soil pH at
   30-60 cm. We postulate that the lack of correlation between sodium
   bicarbonate-extractable P and leaf P may be due to iron-calcium
   co-precipitation of soil P.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to carry out long-term monitoring of
   protein banks (PB) established under the real-low-input-farm conditions
   of Burkina Faso, characterized by a Sudano-Sahelian climate type with
   wide variations in rainfall. The PBs, planted in 2016-2017 with Leucaena
   leucocephala (LL) and Morus alba (MA) at a high density (20,000
   plants/ha), were monitored from 2016/2017 to 2021 for their biomass
   (fodder) production, chemical composition and nutritional value of the
   edible fodder, and their impacts on soil carbon content. The average
   annual fodder production of LL for the 6 PBs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) was
   11.4 +/- 2.12 t DM/ha/year, while that of MA was 3.8 +/- 1.2 t
   DM/ha/year for the 3 PB (1, 2, and 3). Such differences are related to
   higher adaptive capacity for LL in such climatic conditions. Crude
   protein was higher in LL (19\% versus 17\%), but dry matter
   digestibility (65\% versus 77\%) was superior in MA. Soil carbon
   increased during the five monitored years, an exciting result for these
   poor, low-fertility soil conditions. Our results demonstrate the
   technical and environmental feasibility of establishing this low-input
   agroforestry technology in these conditions and inspire the potential of
   sustainable agriculture as an agroecological alternative to overcoming
   feed shortages for local livestock farming. However, the successful
   management of a PB relies on selecting the right suitable species,
   protecting them, and managing them during the establishment and fodder
   production periods with suitable cutting frequency and appropriate
   post-harvest management.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala) and Banana flour (Musa cavendishii) on
   performance of laying hens. Fifty laying hens (3 months of age) were
   randomly distributed into five experimental groups, each consisting of
   10 laying hens. The groups were control (10 laying hens); L-6 (Leucaena,
   6 g/day (10 laying hens)); L-8 (Leucaena, 8.0 g/day (10 laying hens));
   L-10 (Leucaena, 10 g/day (10 laying hens)); and L-12 (Leucaena, 12 g/day
   (10 laying hens)), in addition, five levels of Banana flour control (10
   laying hens); 25\% (10 laying hens); 50\%, (10 laying hens); 75\% (10
   laying hens); and 100\% (10 laying hens), were assessed respectively.
   The experimental period lasted from 4 to 8 weeks. The results of this
   study showed that there were no significant differences between of
   treatments L-6, L-8, L-10, and L-12 for body weight during the first 30
   days compared with the control, whereas for weight gain, statistically
   significant differences were observed between the control compared with
   the treatments L-6, L-8, L-10, and L-12 for days 10, 20 and 30 (p<0.05).
   Additionally, statistically significant differences were found between
   different levels of Banana flour for weight gain (g) between the control
   with the levels 25, 50 75, 100\%, respectively for days 20 and 30. In
   the case of feed intake (g) statistically significant differences were
   found during day 30 between the control and 100\%, also between the
   control and levels 25, and 75\%, respectively. From the results, it can
   be concluded that the inclusion of Leucaena and banana flour have
   effects on weight gain, body weight and feed intake of laying hens.},

   Cunningham (5,000 trees ha(-1)) and Megathyrsus maximus cv. Tanzania was
   assessed in a silvopastoral system in a tropical hot sub-humid climate

   2014 (rainy) and March-April 2015 (dry). The treatments were harvests at
   20-, 30-, 40- and 50-d intervals in both seasons, randomly assigned to
   twelve (24 m(2)) paddocks. The grass accounted for most of the total
   available forage in the silvopastoral system (80 vs 20 \%). In both
   seasons, the association yielded more forage at the 50-d interval (5,300
   kg DM ha(-1) in the rainy season and 1,620 kg DM ha(-1) in the dry
   season) (P<0.05). During the rainy season, crude protein (CP) in the
   tree forage was higher at the 50-d interval (22 \%; P<0.05), but did not
   change over the intervals during the dry season (28 \%; P>0.05); neutral
   detergent fiber (NDF) did not change over time (44 \%; P>0.05) and acid
   detergent fiber (ADF) increased in the 50-d interval (25 \%, P<0.05) but

Journal = {CROP \& PASTURE SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3},
Pages = {248-260},
Abstract = {Plant analysis is an important tool for predicting plant nutrient
   imbalances associated with variable soil fertility and it is usually
   based on analysis of index plant parts such as the youngest fully
   expanded leaf (YFEL). Recent use of the YFEL to diagnose plant nutrient
   status of Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata (leucaena) pastures has
   given unreliable results. Two field trials, one irrigated and one
   dryland, were conducted in subtropical Queensland to investigate the
   effect of index leaf selection, plant phenology and environmental
   factors (ambient temperature and water stress) on leaf nutrient
   concentrations. The YFEL was identified as the best plant part to sample
   because it was readily identifiable and had consistent concentrations of
   most nutrients compared to older and younger leaves provided specific
   conditions were met when sampling. At both sites there was significant
   (P < 0.05) seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations in leucaena
   YFEL, which was poorly correlated with ambient temperature but strongly
   correlated with rainfall in the preceding 28 days and chronological age
   of YFEL. Advancing plant phenological stage of development increased the
   chronological age of YFEL from 12 to 73 days under irrigation since no
   new leaves were produced for prolonged periods during pod filling and
   maturation. Similarly, YFEL could be 146 days old on plants in
   vegetative stages of growth under prolonged drought in dryland
   conditions. YFEL of similar to 21 days of age or less were found to be
   optimal for analysis. Furthermore, as the calcium (Ca) concentration of
   YFEL was strongly correlated with leaf chronological age, this parameter
   could be used to determine the age of the leaves sampled. YFEL with Ca
   concentrations >0.75\% DM were likely to be > 21 days in age and should
   not be used for the diagnosis of plant nutrient status. It was concluded
   that leaf analysis could be used to confidently assess leucaena plant
   nutrient status provided the YFEL were sampled from actively growing
   plants in vegetative development that had received rainfall/irrigation
   in the preceding 28 days and were <21 days of age.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the allelopathic effect of
   aqueous extracts of leaves of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) R. de Wit.
   and Hovenia dulcis Thunb. on germination and early development of Mimosa
   bimucronata DC Kuntze and Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.). Extracts were
   prepared in dilution of 2.5\%; 5\%; 7.5\% and 10\% (w/v) and compared to
   the control. Both extracts revealed allelopathic potential on seed
   germination and initial growth of M. bimucronata. No negative
   interference of extracts from the donor species was observed on the
   germination of P. dubium. However, seedlings subjected to L.
   leucocephala extract suffered interference in the initial development,
   resulting in the elongation of the radicle to be more sensitive to the
   effects of the extracts. Thus, the results showed that aqueous extracts
   of the leaves of L. leucocephala and H. dulcis have inhibitory
   properties on germination and early development of M. bimucronata, as
   well as and early development of P. dubium.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to prepare a highly efficient adsorbent
   from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit via pyrolysis and chemical
   activation (H3PO4) with a modification (MnO4- and Fe3+) process for
   HAsO42- removal from aqueous solution. It has been found that the
   activated carbon prepared by pyrolysis activation at a temperature of
   500 degrees C for 2h (502) exhibited the best performance for the
   adsorption of the I-2 number (505.69mgg(-1)) and Fe3+ (28.18mgg(-1)).
   After carbonized carbon (CC) and 502 were modified by using MnO4- and
   Fe3+, the HAsO42- adsorption capacity was increased up to 100 times when
   compared with CC and 502 without chemical modification. The pH range of
   about 6-7 was appropriate for Fe3+ and the HAsO42- adsorption. For the
   regeneration of adsorbent, the Fe3+ and HAsO42- could be successfully
   desorbed from the CC surface by using 1.0molL(-1) HNO3 solution. The
   adsorption data were well described by the Langmuir and
   pseudo-second-order kinetic models, which could be confirmed by R-2
   close to 1. Moreover, the adsorption behaviors were physisorption,
   spontaneous and endothermic, confirmed by Themkin and
   Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms as well as thermodynamic studies. This
   research was expected to help to understand the adsorption behavior of
   As(V) and to provide a suitable process with high adsorption capacity.

   addition, whereas M KCl-extractable Al decreased to undetectable levels.
   The solution composition of soils treated with millmud showed a
   pronounced increase in all of the major and minor nutrients
   investigated, whereas lime addition only caused an increase in Ca. 
   Plant growth was very low in the unamended soil, even in the presence of
   added P.  However, addition of millmud caused a marked increase in yield
   which was 3-4 times higher than with the soils treated with lime only. 
   Because many of the soils in Fiji are strongly weathered, acidic and
   have a low nutrient status, the result obtained suggests that an
   appropriate use of millmud would prove beneficial to farmers.},

Abstract = {An endophagous seed predator, Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus
   (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae), utilizes Neotropical Leucaena
   (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae). One of its hosts, Leucaena leucocephala, is a
   fast-growing nitrogen-fixing tree that serves as a multipurpose
   beneficial plant but eventually becomes an aggressive invader where it
   was introduced. Herein, we report A. macrophthalmus invasion of the Far
   East, South Asian tropics and subtropics (Japanese Pacific Islands,
   Taiwan, Southern China, Northern Thailand and Southern India). Of other
   field-collected mimosoid legumes, an introduced tree, Falcataria
   moluccana, in Taiwan Was found to be used by the seed predator.
   Conversely, our published work review revealed that the seed predator
   had retained high host specificity to Leucaena species in its native and
   introduced regions. Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus was able to utilize
   aphagously postharvest mature seeds for oviposition and larval
   development, which is a trait of post-dispersal seed predators. We
   confirmed that A. macrophthalmus that was reared on L. leucocephala was
   able to utilize F moluccana as well. Although the relatively high host
   specificity of the oligophagous beetle is Suitable for controlling the
   weedy, L. leucocephala, the potential host range expansion confirmed by
   this study must be cautioned.},

Abstract = {The utilization of protein feed by animals are influenced by the process
   of its degradation in the rumen and its digestion in the intestine. The
   extent of its degradation and digestion are influenced by the form of
   protein and the present of secondary compound in the plant. The aim of
   the study was to determine the amont of protein in the three leguminouse
   shrubs utilized by the animals. The study on the utilization of protein
   from leguminouse shrub was undertaken by investigate the nitrogen
   kinetic in 24 head of growing sheep (BW 23kg) consuming Leucaena
   leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra callothyrsus leaves and
   Rhodes grass hay. The diets were fed every two hours starting at 07: 00
   am. The animals were divided into four groups of dietary treatment
   namely LL, GS, CC and CG groups which were fed by Leucaena, Gliricidia,
   Calliandra dan Rhodes grass leaves, respectively. The Rhode grass, as
   control diet, was mixed with 1.4\% of urea to increase the nitrogen
   offered to the animals up to 150 g/day. Thus all the four diets were
   offered the same amount of nitrogen/day. Measurements were undertaken on
   feed utilization and nitrogen kinetics in experimental animals. The
   amount of nitrogen consumed then undegraded in the rumen as well as
   undigested in the intestine was significant higher in CC group (P <
   0.01) then those in LL, GS and CG groups. The value was 67\% for CC
   group then followed by 35\% for LL group and 33\% for GS group. The
   amount of nitrogen degraded in the rumen thus lost in urine was
   significantly higher in animals fed GS and LL leaves compared to those
   in animals fed CC diet (P < 0.01). The values were 46\% for GS and LL
   group and only 16\% for CC group. The amount of nitrogen retained by the
   animals was similar among the three groups being 17-21\% (P > 0.05). The
   Plasma urea concentration, urea entry rate and urea in urine animals
   were similar in LL and GS groups but higher than those in CC group. The
   values were 0.86; 0.8; 0.46 mg/ml (P < 0.01) and 79; 78; 50 g/d (P <
   0.01) and 26.7; 24.5; 7.3 g/d (P < 0.01) for LL, GS and CC groups,
   respectively. The conclusion is most of nitrogen from Calliandra was
   un-degraded and un-digested in the rumen and intestine thus excreted
   through feces, while most of the protein in Leucaena and Gliricidia was
   degraded in the rumen thus excreted through urine.},

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted on a commercial farm located in the western
   part of Venezuela (10.5 degrees N and 72 degrees W; mean annual rainfall
   of 1000 mm; mean annual temperature of 28 degrees C; sandy-loam Alfisol
   with pH of 5.5). The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the in
   vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), crude protein (CP) content
   and mineral composition of four Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit
   accessions under rotational grazing by heifers over a 6-month period
   covering dry and rainy seasons, using a split-plot experimental design
   with two replications. Neither accessions nor the accession x season
   interaction affected (P>0.05) any of the variables. The mean IVOMD was
   68.6\%, whereas CP content during the rainy season (26.5\%) was higher
   (P<0.05) than in the dry season (24.3\%). Average mineral content of the
   accessions were adequate in relation to grazing ruminant requirements
   with the exception of phosphorus {[}(P) 0.13\%], sodium {[}(Na)
   0.038\%], copper {[}(Cu) 6.9 ppm], and zinc {[}(Zn) 19.7 ppm]. Forage P
   concentration may have been influenced by the low soil P content of the
   experimental site. The mean forage Ca:P ratio (11.3:1) was considerably
   wider than desirable. During the dry season, ash content increased
   (P<0.05), Na, iron (Fe), and cobalt (eo) decreased (P<0.05), but Fe and
   Co still remained above the critical levels. Mean concentrations of
   other elements were not affected (P>0.05) by season. Forage molybdenum
   (Mo) concentrations were low and, therefore, would not result in
   conditioned Cu deficiency. The four L. leucocephala accessions had
   similar feeding value for grazing ruminants and their quality was not
   markedly reduced in the dry season. Mineral supplementation of ruminants
   grazing this legume may be needed to correct specific deficiencies and
   imbalances.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of the experiment was to assess the effect of
   increasing amounts of Leucaena leucocephala forage on dry matter intake
   (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI), enteric methane production, rumen
   fermentation pattern and protozoa population in cattle fed Pennisetum
   purpureum and housed in respiration chambers.
   Methods: Five crossbred heifers (Bos taurusxBos indicus) (BW: 295 +/- 6
   kg) were fed chopped P. purpureum grass and increasing levels of L.
   leucocephala (0\%, 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, and 80\% of dry matter {[}DM]) in a
   5x5 Latin square design.
   Results: The voluntary intake and methane production were measured for
   23 h per day in respiration chambers; molar proportions of volatile
   fatty acids (VFAs) were determined at 6 h postprandial period. Molar
   concentration of VFAs in rumen liquor were similar (p>0.05) between
   treatments. However, methane production decreased linearly (p<0.005),
   recording a maximum reduction of up to similar to 61\% with 80\% of DM
   incorporation of L. leucocephala in the ration and no changes (p>0.05)
   in rumen protozoa population were found.
   Conclusion: Inclusion of 80\% of L. leucocephala in the diet of heifers
   fed low-quality tropical forages has the capacity to reduce up to 61.3\%
   enteric methane emission without affecting DMI, OMI, and protozoa

Abstract = {Biological invasions are among the main threats to biodiversity, yet
   invasive species may also have positive impacts on native taxa, such as
   supplementing the diet of native species when other food items are less
   available. Herein, we assess whether the invasive River Tamarind
   Leucaena leucocephala, a small Fabaceae tree, is an important food item
   for a genetically distinct, threatened population of the Southern Mealy
   Amazon Amazona farinosa in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We surveyed
   citizen science platforms and published articles for feeding records of
   Southern Mealy Amazon to quantify the occurrence of River Tamarind seeds
   in its diet throughout the year, and assess if seed consumption differed
   between seasons. Our results showed that, although the density of
   records of fruit consumption is relatively constant throughout the year,
   consumption of River Tamarind seeds occurs almost exclusively during the
   dry season. Furthermore, seed prevalence in feeding events was also
   significantly higher during that time of the year. Our findings indicate
   that L. leucocephala represents an important source of nutrition for
   Atlantic Forest A. farinosa during the dry season. We highlight how
   citizen science may help to elucidate potentially positive interactions

Abstract = {Tree resistance to overturning is crucial in forestry hazard
   applications and management. Tree anchorage varies considerably with
   species, tree age, and site conditions. We investigate the relationship
   between the root characteristics of the overturning slip surface and the
   role of roots (regarding different diameters in overturning). Four
   Leucaena leucocephala were fully excavated by a quadrate monolith to
   establish root distribution characteristics, and 19 L. leucocephala were
   uprooted until the trees completely overturned to measure the anchoring
   resistance to overturning. A model was developed to improve the
   descriptions of root characteristics in the mechanical processes for
   tree overturning. The results show that the distribution characteristics
   of the root system were well described by the model. For the root-soil
   plate radius, the thickest root diameter and the root biomass of
   different diameters at the overturning slip surface increased with the
   diameter at the breast height. The root biomass affected the strength of
   the overturning slip surface; the root density may be a key factor in
   identifying the location of the overturning slip surface. The model
   could predict the overturning moment of most overturned trees; although
   it overestimated the overturning moment for small diameters at breast
   height trees, the results will be useful for understanding the influence
   of root distribution characteristics in overturning.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is economically an important plant. Seeds
   collected from two different populations of L. leucocephala responded

   that Cd was more toxic than Pb on all measured variables. With
   increasing concentrations of Pb and Cd, the rate of seed germination was
   reduced for seeds collected from the polluted area. Cd treatment at 100
   mu g(-cm3) caused a significant reduction in root growth for seeds
   collected from the polluted area. At combined treatments, the seed
   germination and seedling growth decreased than individual treatments of
   Pb and Cd. The seeds of L. leucocephala collected from the polluted area
   caused significant (p<0.05) reduction in shoot length at combined

   splendida in tree legume-grass mixtures using the N-15 isotope dilution
   method. A non-N-2-fixing tree legume, Senna siamea was used as the
   reference plant. Gliricidia, leucaena and senna were monocropped or
   mixcropped with grass (50:50 replacement density) in April 1992. Percent
   N derived from fixation (\%Ndfa) in gliricidia and leucaena was measured
   during 4 periods of regrowth during August 1992-May 1993. Percent N
   derived from transfer (\%Ndft) in grass grown with gliricidia and
   leucaena was calculated using the N-15 enrichment of grass grown with
   senna as the reference. Nitrogen yield was higher (P < 0.05) in
   gliricidia than in leucaena and senna (which had similar N)
   monocultures. Mix-cropped tree legumes produced similar N yields. In 3
   tree legume species, a major percentage of the total N was in
   above-ground plant parts with roots accounting for around 22\% at the
   final harvest. The N-15 enrichments were significantly higher (P <
   0.001) in senna than in gliricidia and leucaena at all harvests. Within
   a species, the N-15 enrichments in different plant parts were not
   significantly different. \%Ndfa varied little in monoculture gliricidia
   and leucaena, ranging from 61-72\% in different regrowth periods. This
   increased to an average of 81\% in mix-cropped gliricidia and leucaena
   at the last 2 harvests. In both species, \%Ndfa values calculated for
   different plant parts were not significantly different from the \%Ndfa
   based on the weighted average N-15 enrichment for the whole plant. N
   yield of grass grown with gliricidia and leucaena was 16\% higher than
   that of grass monoculture. The N-15 enrichments were significantly lower
   (P < 0.05) in grass grown with gliricidia and leucaena than in grass
   grown with senna and grass monoculture at the last 2 harvests. On
   average, up to 21\% of N in grass growing with gliricidia and leucaena
   could be derived from transfer of biologically fixed nitrogen.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted on a cattle farm in Yucatan, Mexico. The
   objective was to assess the effect of energy supplementation on milk
   yield and composition, and on the efficiency of use of dietary N in cows
   fed Leucaena leucocephala foliage (30\% of total diet) and grass
   Pennisetum purpureum. Four multiparous crossbred Bos indicus x B. taurus
   cows in the first third of lactation were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square
   design. Treatments consisted of two energy sources: sugar cane molasses
   and rice polishing, offered individually or mixed, and a control group
   (Ctrl) without energy supplementation. The supplements were iso-proteic
   and iso-energetic and were formulated to provide 25\% of the daily
   energy requirement. Supplementation increased dry matter intake (3
   kg/cow/d). Milk yield was 13\% higher (P = 0.048) in the supplemented
   treatments (7.86 kg/cow/d) than in the Ctrl group (6.97 kg/cow/d). Milk
   yield did not differ (P > 0.05) among supplemented treatments. Milk fat
   was higher for the Ctrl treatment compared with molasses and rice
   polishing. Concentrations of protein, lactose and solids non-fat in milk
   were not significantly affected by energy supplementation. The lower
   concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) found in the treatments with
   supplementation (9.77 mg/dl) compared with Ctrl (15.61 mg/dl) indicates
   greater efficiency in capturing N by rumen microorganisms. No
   differences in BUN were found among supplemented groups. It is concluded
   that energy supplementation with rice polishing alone or in combination
   with molasses, can improve the efficiency of use of dietary N, and milk
   yield, in cows fed 30\% L. leucocephala foliage.},

Abstract = {Deliberately introduced for agroforestry, the invasive tree Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) is naturalized in several
   countries worldwide, including parts of South Africa. The seed beetle
   Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae)
   was inadvertently introduced to several countries via contaminated seed,
   but was released as a biological control agent in South Africa. Although
   widely established in South Africa, its efficacy may be curtailed
   because damage is reputed to be confined to canopy-held seeds, with
   dehisced seeds escaping damage on the ground. To clarify the beetle's
   potential, we investigated: (i) its selection of oviposition sites when
   presented with pods bearing seeds, loose seeds and empty pods in
   different locations (canopy- versus ground-held); and (ii) the effect of
   seed location on egg mortality. The beetles oviposited on pods bearing
   seeds, loose seeds and empty pods in both locations but showed
   significant preferences for pods bearing seeds, regardless of location.
   Egg mortality was high (66 \% overall) and caused largely by predation,
   but did not differ between canopy- and ground-held seeds. Dehisced seeds
   are thus more likely to escape damage due to the beetle's greater
   association with pods bearing seeds, which occur mostly in the canopy.
   While not affected by seed location, egg predation could affect beetle
   population densities. Although oviposition patterns and egg predation
   may constrain the efficacy of A. macrophthalmus, seed damage in relation
   to seed availability still needs to be quantified in the field.},

Abstract = {An experiment was undertaken for determining the noxiousness coefficient
   of the psyllid Heteropsylla cubana in Leucaena leucocephala. In the
   experiment, two insectariums of 12 m(3) were used and six plants of
   leucaena were transplanted in both. In the first. an apparently healthy
   population of 50 psyllids of Heteropsylla cubana/m(2). collected in the
   field.. was released. The second.. without insects, was the control. In
   the first month, weekly observations were made and, starting from the
   second, they were monthly, to determine the visible lesions in the
   plants. For this reason, the proportions corresponding to the
   quantification of the population and its damages were used. The
   demographic variables of the population and the noxiousness coefficient
   were determined. The plants were pruned at one meter of height and the
   leaf yield was calculated in fresh basis at 28, 66 and 122 d. The
   observations in the insectariums proved that the population released
   attained to survive and multiply itself under the-conditions of the
   study. At three months, a generalized defoliation was produced in all
   the plants compared to the control, in which there were no damages. It
   was evidenced that H cubana multiplied its initial population in 87
   times. The values of the net reproduction rate (R-o), finite increase
   rate (lambda) and the intrinsic increase rate (r(d)) varied in the
   different stages, r(d) ranged from 0.008 to 0.037. The leaf yield in
   fresh basis decreased up to seven times when compared to the control and
   the growth of the plants affected. This leads to a noxiousness
   coefficient of 85.7 \%. It is concluded that Heteropsylla cubana, when
   having no natural enemies, is able to provoke the total defoliation of
   Leucaena leucocephala and, consequently, affects the yield of the plant,
   delays its growth and decreases the capacity of regrowth. The result of
   the noxiousness coefficient is recommended to be used as previous basis
   for the calculation of the damages threshold in Cuban conditions.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess milk yields, estimate the intake of
   crude protein (CP) and determine the concentrations of blood urea
   nitrogen (BUN) in early post-partum crossbred cows grazing irrigated
   Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) in a silvopastoral system relative to
   those in an irrigated grass monoculture. Twenty-four multiparous cows
   were randomly allotted at calving on the basis of previous milk yields
   to 2 grazing treatments: grass monoculture system (MS) of Cynodon
   nlemfuensis (n=12); and an intensive silvopastoral system (ISS) composed
   of leucaena and C. nlemfuensis (n=12). Cows were supplemented with
   sorghum grain (ISS) or a conventional concentrate (MS) during milking to
   ensure availability of metabolizable energy (ME) and CP required for
   milk production. Mean estimated intake of leucaena was 5.1 +/- 1.3 kg
   DM/d and estimated CP intakes were 1,479 +/- 3.3 and 1,258 +/- 3.3 g/d
   for ISS and MS, respectively (P>0.05), while estimated intakes of ME
   were 161 +/- 1.3 and 131 +/- 1.4 MJ/d for ISS and MS, respectively
   (P<0.05). Milk yields were 13.5 and 14.5 kg/cow/d for cows on ISS and
   MS, respectively (P>0.05). Concentrations of BUN were 19.1 mg/dL for
   cows in ISS and 15.3 mg/dL for cows in MS (P<0.05). We conclude that
   intake of leucaena and sorghum grain in an irrigated silvopastoral
   system was sufficient to substitute for expensive concentrate in the
   diets of lactating cows grazing irrigated grass monoculture. However,
   the higher levels of BUN found in ISS suggest a lower efficiency of N
   utilization in this treatment. Restricting consumption of leucaena might
   be a means of improving efficiency of its use and this warrants
   investigation.},

   2-year female Nguni x Boer goats and three 3-year female Damara sheep
   were randomly allocated to grass-Lespedeza cuneata (grass-Lc) and
   grass-Leucaena leucocephala (grass-Ll) pastures. Times spent on
   browsing, grazing and idling were recorded from 0700 to 1600 h every 2
   minutes for 3 consecutive days. Ingestive behaviour of each animal was
   observed for 10 minutes at 1000, 1200 and 1400 h for 6 days. Bite count
   and bite weight were used to determine intake rates during browsing.
   Goats spent 3.24 and 3.93 times longer than sheep in browsing, while
   sheep spent 2.75 and 2.27 times longer in grazing than goats on grass-Lc
   than grass-Ll pastures, respectively. Goats idled for longer periods
   than sheep on both pastures. Sheep had faster bite rates than goats,
   while Lespedeza cuneata elicited lower bite rates than L. leucocephala.
   Fastest feeding and bite rates were observed at mid day (1200 h) and
   lowest during the afternoon (1400 h). Intake rates of fresh herbage are
   higher at mid day than in the morning and afternoon. In conclusion,
   based on time spent browsing, L. leucocephala is better preferred as a
   forage browse compared to L. cuneata.},

   hull, soaking, boiling, and fermentation. The best concentration
   inoculum in lamtoro tempeh processing was determined by hedonic test.
   Fermentation was carried out in 36 hours and every 6 hours mimosine,
   tannin, and phitic acid content was analyzed. From hedonic test,
   inoculum concentration of 1\% was used in lamtoro tempeh processing.
   During 36 hours fermentation, phytic acid content and mimosine content
   was decreased significantly, from 0.0558 \% to 0.0453 \% and from
   0.00393 \% to 0.00173 \% respectively. Whereas tannin content was
   increased signifacantly, from 0.0822 \% to 0.00173 \%.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen fixed in 13 provenances of Acacia albida and 11 isolines of
   Leucaena leucocephala inoculated with effective Rhizobium strains was
   measured by 15N techniques and the total N difference method. In the
   test soil, on the average, L. leucocephala derived about 65\% of its
   total N from atmospheric N2 fixation compared to about 20\% by A.
   albida. Significant differences in the percentage of N derived from
   atmospheric N2 (\% Ndfa) occurred, between provenances or isolines
   within species. The \% Ndfa ranged from 37 to 74\% within L.
   leucocephala and from 6 to 37 within A. albida; (equivalent to 20-50 mg
   N plant-1 and 4-37 mg N plant-1 for the two species over three months,
   respectively) and was correlated with the nodule mass (r = 0.91). The
   time course of N2 fixation of three selected provenances (low,
   intermediate and good fixers) was followed at 12 weekly intervals over a
   36 week period. The \% Ndfa of all provenances and isolines increased
   with time; and except for one of the L. leucocephala provenances, \%
   Ndfa was similar within species at the 36 weeks harvest. There was a
   significant correlation between \% Ndfa and the amount of N2 fixed (r =
   0.96). Significant interactions occurred between provenances and N
   treatments and often growth of uninoculated but N fertilized plants was
   less variable than for inoculated unfertilized plants.},

   macrophthalmus. Horismenus abnormicaulis has been added to the list of
   A. macrophthalmus parasitoids, and its occurrence has been expanded to
   the state of Minas Gerais. This discovery expands our knowledge of H.

Abstract = {Nitrogen metabolism and the production of primary and secondary
   metabolites vary according to biotic and abiotic factors such as trace
   elements (TE) stress, and can, therefore, be considered biomarkers. The
   present study evaluated the effect of copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) TE,
   separately, on the metabolism of nitrogen compounds and biomass
   production, partitioned into shoot and roots of Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) de Wit., and identified possible defense mechanisms linked to
   nitrogen metabolism. At 120 days of cultivation, the biomass production
   of L. leucocephala was higher when exposed to excess Fe than Cu.
   Nonetheless, the biomass gain (\%) of plants exposed to Cu was higher,
   especially the biomass gains in roots. The tolerance and biomass
   production of L. leucocephala is related to the regulation of nitrogen
   metabolism and production of secondary metabolites. The biochemistry of
   plant metabolism against the excess of Cu and Fe TE manifested
   similarly, but with some spe-cifics regarding the chemical nature of
   each metal. There was a reduction in the content of ureides and proteins
   and an increase in amino acids in the roots in relation to the increase
   in Cu and Fe concentrations. There was low accumulation of proline in
   the roots in treatments 400 and 500 mg/dm3 compared to the control for
   both TE. On the other hand, the total phenolic compounds in the roots
   increased. Our results indicate that the increased synthesis of amino
   acids and the accumulation of phenolic compounds is involved in the
   tolerance of L. leucocephala to Cu and Fe.},

Abstract = {Pot experiments were conducted in the greenhouse to determine the
   combined effects of lime, nitrogen and phosphorus and the relative
   importance of each of these nutrients in establishing nodulated and

   subjected to simulated erosion. Leucaena was grown in the soil

   nutrient (basal) consisting of K, Mg, S, Zn, Cu, and B plus lime, N, and
   P (complete) or one of the latter three supplements.
   The extent of mycorrhizal colonization of roots as well as mycorrhizal
   effectiveness, as measured by pinnule P content increased when the
   eroded soil was amended with combinations of all the nutrients and
   inoculated with G. aggregatum. Similar trends were observed when
   symbiotic effectiveness was measured in terms of shoot P, Cu, and Zn
   status and dry matter yield. Nodule dry matter was also responsive to
   amendment of the soil with the complete nutrients and to
   vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation. Phosphorus was found to be
   the most important nutrient limiting mycorrhizal effectiveness in the
   eroded soil, followed by N and lime. It is concluded that lost

   established successfully on highly weathered eroded soils inoculated

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the potential of
   atmospheric carbon storage by Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena
   leucocephala, through the quantification of biomass production and
   carbon content in stem, branches and foliage. This was done to estimate
   the potential it has to be included in the program whose central axis
   are silvopastoral systems and supply of environmental services in the
   study region. This was done -by using allometric equations- to estimate
   the potential of being included in a local technology innovation
   program, whose centerpiece is the silvopastoral systems and supply of
   environmental services in the region of study. The destructive sampling
   methodology included 30 trees of two forage-potentially species in
   central Chiapas, by integrating information on the diameter at breast
   height (DBH), total tree height and weights independent of stem,
   branches and foliage. We estimated the dry matter of each of the samples
   by drying them with forced air for 48 hours at 60 C in a drying oven. We
   also determined the carbon content with the analizer CHN. With the
   obtained data, a series of exponential and logarithmic models were
   adjusted by using statistical software. In the case of L. leucocephala
   best-fit model was In (ba) = -1,46 + 1,69 In (DBH) and G. sepium model
   ba = 3,27e0,075 (DAP). The results indicate that L. leucocephala has a
   higher above-ground biomass production and consequently greater
   potential to store atmospheric carbon than Gliricidia sepium. This
   choice favors the establishment of silvopastoral practices and future
   research aimed at technological innovation to address sustainable

Abstract = {Plant growth regulators play a key role in cell wall structure and
   chemistry of woody plants. Understanding of these regulatory signals is
   important in advanced research on wood quality improvement in trees. The
   present study is aimed to investigate the influence of exogenous
   application of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) and brassinosteroid inhibitor,
   brassinazole (BRZ) on wood formation and spatial distribution of cell
   wall polymers in the xylem tissue of Leucaena leucocephala using light
   and immuno electron microscopy methods. Brassinazole caused a decrease
   in cambial activity, xylem differentiation, length and width of fibres,
   vessel element width and radial extent of xylem suggesting
   brassinosteroid inhibition has a concomitant impact on cell elongation,
   expansion and secondary wall deposition. Histochemical studies of
   24-epibrassinolide treated plants showed an increase in syringyl lignin
   content in the xylem cell walls. Fluorescence microscopy and
   transmission electron microscopy studies revealed the inhomogenous
   pattern of lignin distribution in the cell corners and middle lamellae
   region of BRZ treated plants. Immunolocalization studies using LM10 and
   LM 11 antibodies have shown a drastic change in the micro-distribution
   pattern of less substituted and highly substituted xylans in the xylem
   fibres of plants treated with EBR and BRZ. In conclusion, present study
   demonstrates an important role of brassinosteroid in plant development

Title = {Predicting potential invasion risks of Leucaena leucocephala

Abstract = {The presence of invasive plant species poses a substantial ecological
   impact, thus comprehensive evaluation of their potential range and risk
   under the influence of climate change is necessary. This study uses
   maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling to forecast the likelihood of Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit invasion in Saudi Arabia under present and
   future climate change scenarios. Utilizing the MaxEnt modeling, we
   integrated climatic and soil data to predict habitat suitability for the
   invasive species. We conducted a detailed analysis of the distribution
   patterns of the species, using climate variables and ecological factors.
   We focused on the important influence of temperature seasonality,
   temperature annual range, and precipitation seasonality. The
   distribution modeling used robust measures of area under the curve (AUC)
   and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves, to map the invasion
   extent, which has a high level of accuracy in identifying appropriate
   habitats. The complex interaction that influenced the invasion of L.
   leucocephala was highlighted by the environmental parameters using
   Jackknife test. Presently, the actual geographic area where L.
   leucocephala was found in Saudi Arabia was considerably smaller than the
   theoretical maximum range, suggesting that it had the capacity to expand
   further. The MaxEnt model exhibited excellent prediction accuracy and
   produced reliable results based on the data from the ROC curve.
   Precipitation and temperature were the primary factors influencing the
   potential distribution of L. leucocephala. Currently, an estimated area
   of 216,342 km(2) in Saudi Arabia was at a high probability of invasion
   by L. leucocephala. We investigated the potential for increased invasion
   hazards in the future due to climate change scenarios (Shared
   Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 245 and 585). The analysis of key climatic
   variables, including temperature seasonality and annual range, along
   with soil properties such as clay composition and nitrogen content,
   unveiled their substantial influence on the distribution dynamic of L.
   leucocephala. Our findings indicated a significant expansion of high
   risk zones. High-risk zones for L. leucocephala invasion in the current
   climate conditions had notable expansions projected under future climate
   scenarios, particularly evident in southern Makkah, Al Bahah, Madina,
   and Asir areas. The results, backed by thorough spatial studies,
   emphasize the need to reduce the possible ecological impacts of climate
   change on the spread of L. leucocephala. Moreover, the study provides
   valuable strategic insights for the management of invasion, highlighting
   the intricate relationship between climate change, habitat
   appropriateness, and the risks associated with invasive species.
   Proactive techniques are suggested to avoid and manage the spread of L.
   leucocephala, considering its high potential for future spread. This
   study enhances the overall comprehension of the dynamics of invasive
   species by combining modeling techniques with ecological knowledge. It
   also provides valuable information for decision-making to implement
   efficient conservation and management strategies in response to changing
   environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {In two experiments with Gliricidia sepium (G) and G combined with
   Leucaena leucocephala (GL), 14 West African Dwarf goats were offered
   seven feed levels varying from 60 to 120 g DM kg(-0.75) d(-1), With
   increments of 10 g, in Expt. I, and from 40 to 130 g DM kg(-0.75) d(-1)
   With increments of 15 g in Expt. 2. Maximum DMI for the G and GL were,
   in Expt. 1: 72.5 +/- 2.6 and 90.7 +/- 27.2, in Expt. 2: 55.5 +/- 3.7 and
   63.4 +/- 5.3 g kg(-0.75) d(-1) respectively. In both experiments GL
   rations were more digestible than G rations, the difference in the
   second experiment being larger (10.3 vs. 3.6 percentage units), mainly
   due to a lower digestibility of G. A marked effect of refusal rate on
   intake was found and the relationship between refusal rate and DMI
   differed per diet. Animal production per unit of forage offered was
   maximal at offer levels ranging from 79.4 (Expt. 1, G) to 106.6 g DM
   kg(-0.75) d(-1) (Expt 1, GL). Corresponding weight gains were estimated
   to range from 2.0 (G2) to 8.2 g kg(-0.75) d(-1) (GL1). Refusal rates at
   maximum production levels varied from 13.4\% (G1) to 41.6\% (G2).
   Estimated maintenance levels were attained at refusal rates varying from
   0.7\% (G1) to 20.3\% (G2). It was concluded that a wide range of offer
   levels is required to obtain a reliable estimate of the relationship
   between feed offer and intake. Feeding at a fixed refusal rate to
   determine the quality of feeds may lead to misjudgment as feeds do not
   attain maximum intake at the same refusal rate. If a feed is
   heterogenous and thus offers opportunity for selection, high offer
   levels and accompanying high refusal rates may have to be accepted if
   the objective is to maximise animal production per unit of available
   feed.},

Abstract = {Macaria mirthae Vargas et al (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) is a geometrid
   moth native to the northern Atacama Desert of Chile. Its oligophagous
   larvae are associated with native hosts of the plant family Fabaceae,
   the most important of which is Acacia macracantha. The invasive tree
   Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) was recently recorded as a host plant
   for M. mirthae based on morphology. The taxonomic status of larvae
   collected on A. macracantha and L. leucocephala was assessed using
   sequences of the DNA barcode fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I (COI) gene. Genetic divergence between samples from the host
   plants was found to be 0\%-0.8\% (Kimura 2-parameter model).
   Neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood analyses were also performed,
   including additional barcode sequences of Neotropical geometrid moths
   from GenBank and BOLD databases. Sequences of the larvae from both host
   plants clustered in a single clade with high statistical support in both
   analyses. Based on these results, it is concluded that M. mirthae has
   effectively expanded its host range and its larvae are currently feeding
   on the exotic tree L. leucocephala. Additionally, the importance of this
   new host association in a highly disturbed habitat is briefly discussed
   in terms of the field biology of this native geometrid moth.},

   four, eight and 16 weeks for each season (rainy and dry). At the end of
   the experiment, it was apparent that the decomposition process was
   faster in the rainy season. Weight loss and N and OM release were faster
   in M. oleifera in monoculture and L. leucocephala and M. oleifera mixed.
   The decomposition patterns of all species followed the simple
   exponential model, with more than 80 \% of the initial mass incorporated

Abstract = {Measurement of pulpwood traits from a standing tree has considerable
   advantage when screening large populations for tree selection. It
   reduces time and also eliminates requirements of transport, powdering,
   and storing the sample. This study describes estimation of Kraft pulp
   yield (KPY) in Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. urophylla, Leucaena
   leucocephala, and Casuarina junghuhniana by portable NIR spectroscopy of
   standing trees. Calibration models were developed for KPY estimation
   using portable NIR spectroscopy for the four species, along with a
   calibration model for syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio in E. camaldulensis.
   The calibration models for KPY showed R-2 values ranging from 0.93 (E.
   camaldulensis) to 0.83 (L leucocephala), and 0.95 for S/G ratio. The
   developed calibration models for E. camaldulensis and L. leucocephala
   were compared with laboratory NIR models, and a variation of <+/- 2.0\%
   was found between both methods. The models were validated by both
   external and cross validation which showed <2.0\% RMSEP (root mean
   square error of prediction) and <2.0\% RMECV (root mean square error of
   cross validation) in external and cross validations, respectively.},

Abstract = {Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit subsp. glabrata (Rose)
   Zarate) in combination with grass pasture is one of the most persistent,
   productive and sustainable grazing systems used in Queensland,
   Australia. Nevertheless, a better understanding of the competitive
   interactions that determine the proportions of leucaena and grass
   components is needed to optimise the design and management of the
   hedgerow pasture system. In a water-limited environment, belowground
   interactions between species are especially influential. Accordingly,
   the aim of this study was to determine the effect of leucaena plant
   density and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Kunth) competition on root
   distribution, evapotranspiration, patterns of soil-water use and the
   resulting water-use efficiency (WUE) of the leucaena and grass
   components. Results showed that although leucaena had deeper roots than
   Rhodes grass, the majority of fine roots of both leucaena and Rhodes
   grass were in the upper 1.5m of the soil profile suggesting a high level
   of competition for water resources. A major factor favouring Rhodes
   grass was that its root abundance was 8-10 times greater than leucaena,
   allowing it to compete more effectively for water resources and limit
   the lateral spread of leucaena roots. Higher cumulative
   evapotranspiration values were recorded from leucaena grown with Rhodes
   grass than from leucaena grown in absence of grass. However, this
   difference was negligible at the highest leucaena density owing to the
   reduced yield of grass caused by shading and increased water uptake of
   leucaena. The findings of this study also confirmed the hypothesis that
   at low tree densities, leucaena-grass pasture will have higher WUE
   (13.8kg DM mm(-1)) than sole leucaena, but this difference was reduced
   with increments of leucaena density. Highest WUE (65.9kg DM mm(-1))
   occurred at highest leucaena density with or without grass.},

Abstract = {A study was conducted to find out the performance and carcass
   characteristics of sheep fed diet in which biscuits waste (BWM) and
   Leucaena leucocephala leaf hay (L/h) mixture were used to replace maize
   and wheat offal mixture at zero (control), 25, 50, 70 and 100\%
   replacement levels. In a completely randomize design, the experimental
   diet where designated B(0), B(1), B(2), B(3), B(4), respectively. The 20
   growing Yankasa rams aged between 9 to 11 months with an initial average
   life weight of 12.17 +/- 0.33 kg were randomly assign to the 5 dietary
   treatment with four rams per treatment. Data were collected to estimate
   dry matter intake (g/d /W (0.7) kg), daily mean life weight gain (g/d),
   feed efficiency and carcass indices. Dietary replacement of maize and
   wheat offal mixture with biscuit waste meal and L. leucocelphala leaf
   hay mixture significantly (P< 0.05) influenced the entire variable
   measured. However, animal on diet B(1) and B(2) in which biscuits waste
   and L. leucocephala leaf mixture replaced 25 and 50\% maize and wheat
   offal mixture, were better when compared to the control (B(0)) and other
   test diet in terms of performance and carcass characteristics. This was
   evident by higher DMI (77.18 and 76.84 g/d /W (0.75) kg), ADWG (134.40
   and 129.52 g/d), feed efficiency (0.199 and 0.195), live shrunk weight

   and 1.78\%) and rib eye area (6.06 and 8.29) which were obtained from
   the animal on these two diets. Broadly, the result in the present study
   indicated that 25 and 75\% replacement level of maize and wheat offal
   mixture with biscuits waste and L. leucocephala leaf hay mixture are
   ideal for ruminant animal production because it improve both the
   performance and carcass characteristics of rams.},

Abstract = {Rhizobium species strain NGR234 nodulates at least 35 diverse genera of
   legumes as well as the nonlegume Parasponia andersonii. Most nodulation
   genes are located on the 500-kilobase pair symbiotic plasmid, pNGR234a.
   Previously, three plasmid-borne host range determinants (HsnI, HsnII,
   and HsnIII) were identifed by their ability to extend the nodulation
   capacity of heterologous rhizobia to include Vigna unguiculata. In this
   study, we show that HsnII contains two new nod-box linked hsn  genes,
   nodS and nodU. nodS controls nodulation of the tropical tree Leucaena
   leucocephala, while the nodSU genes regulate nodulation of the pasture
   legume Desmodium intortum and the grain legume V. unguiculata.
   Regulation of the nod-box upstream of nodSU by the flavonoid naringenin
   was shown using a fusion with a promoterless lacZ gene. Determination of
   the nucleotide sequence of the nodS gene did not reveal homology with
   any gene in the EMBL library, although Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110
   contains both nodS and nodU (M. Gottfert, S. Hitz, and H. Hennecke,
   Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions 3:308-316, 1990). We suggest that
   broad host range in NGR234 is controlled in part by a nodD gene which
   interacts with a wide range of flavonoids, and in part by host-specific
   nod genes such as nodS.},

Abstract = {A modified two stage in vitro digestion method was used to study the
   effects of rate of PEG addition (0-1100 mg/g DM) on dry matter (IVDMD)
   and nitrogen digestibility (IVND) of freeze dried leaf material from
   actively growing shoots of Calliandra calothyrsus (Calliandra) and
   Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham (Leucaena). For both species, IVDMD
   and IVND increased asymptotically with PEG rate; the IVND response being
   markedly greater for Calliandra. There was a three-fold greater amount
   of PEG bound to the residue after Stage 1 (rumen fluid/buffer) digestion
   with Calliandra than with Leucaena (105 versus 33 mg/g DM). The presence
   of PEG in the residue, which was not reduced after Stage 2 (acid-pepsin)
   digestion, resulted in a higher residue weight and therefore an
   underestimated IVDMD. Quantification of the PEG in the residue enabled a
   corrected IVDMD (CIVDMD) to be estimated. PEG did not bias estimates of
   nitrogen digestibility in the same way. In a second experiment,
   estimates of CIVDMD and IVND were made after Stage 1 and after Stage 2
   in the presence and absence of PEG at 160 mg/g sample. For Leucaena,
   there were small, but significant, effects of PEG, whereas with
   Calliandra there were large responses to PEG and to timing of addition.
   When measured after Stage 1, IVND in the absence of PEG was not
   significantly different to zero (compared with 57\% for Leucaena),
   whereas with PEG, IVND was 75\% (compared with 68\% for Leucaena). The
   low IVND for Calliandra was associated with low NH4 N levels in the
   rumen fluid/buffer after Stage 1.
   In summary, about 160 mg PEG/g sample is appropriate for most studies
   with tropical tanniniferous shrub legumes to estimate any deleterious
   tannin effect. The use of PEG to estimate this effect on IVDMD is not
   valid without accounting for the PEG bound to the residue. For
   estimation of the adverse effect of tannins on IVND the use of PEG may
   be more appropriate. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {The potential impact of the soil seed bank of a given species and
   subsequent population persistence will depend on the robustness of the
   seeds against depletion. Invasiveness is frequently linked to this
   behavior and successful control of invasive species depends on reducing
   the size of their seed banks. We propose a hybrid model that simulates
   the seed bank dynamics in association with their physical dormancy (PD)
   based on experimental data on seed bank depletion of a Leucaena
   leucocephala population during the dispersal phase. The hybrid model
   uses cellular automata (CA) and Monte Carlo techniques. The sensitivity
   analysis revealed that the model delivers reproducible and reliable
   results. Then, we discuss the ability of the hybrid model to predict the
   effect of seasonal climate change. A 2.0 degrees C increase in
   temperature was enough to cause a considerable impact in the seed
   depletion curve, and after 1 year, similar to 75\% of the seeds had
   already disappeared from the seed bank. The proposed hybrid CA model can
   be used to study soil-stored seed banks with physical dormancy, and
   could be applied to other Fabaceae species with similar seed traits. We
   believe that this computational model contributes to a better
   understanding of seed bank dynamics and will aid in the control of
   invasive species and for testing different scenarios to reduce or
   eliminate seed banks that have already been formed.},

Abstract = {Silvopastoral systems with the tree legume leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) and grass pastures are widely used for
   ruminant feeding in subtropical and tropical regions. Different
   densities and planting configurations of leucaena will influence
   relative yields of both species because of intra-and interspecific
   competition. With the aim to describe the effects of competition between
   leucaena and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Kunth), a Nelder Wheel trial
   with 10 different leucaena tree densities (100-80 000 trees ha(-1))
   growing with and without Rhodes grass was established in a subtropical
   environment at Gatton, south-east Queensland, in November 2013. From
   2014 to 2016, the biomass of leucaena (six harvests) and Rhodes grass
   (seven harvests) was measured by using allometric equations and the
   BOTANAL sampling procedure over 742 and 721 days, respectively. No
   complementary or facilitative aboveground interactions were observed
   between the leucaena and Rhodes grass components of the pasture system.
   Increasing leucaena tree density resulted in greater aboveground intra-
   and interspecific competition.
   Average maximum individual tree yield (38.9 kg DM tree(-1) year(-1)) was
   reached at 100 trees ha(-1) without grass competition and was reduced by
   60\% with grass competition. Rhodes grass biomass yield was negatively
   affected by shading from the leucaena canopy, with negligible grass
   yield at tree densities >= 8618 trees ha(-1). Therefore, there was
   effectively no grass competition on individual tree yield at higher
   leucaena densities. Accordingly, edible leucaena biomass per unit area
   was positively related to log(10) leucaena density (R-2 = 0.99)
   regardless of grass competition, reaching 21.7 t DM ha(-1) year(-1)
   (2014-15) and 27 t DM ha(-1) year(-1) (2015-16) at the highest leucaena
   density of 80 000 trees ha(-1). By contrast, the yield of Rhodes grass
   was linearly and inversely correlated with log(10) tree density (R-2 =
   0.99). Practical implications for the design and management of
   commercial leucaena-grass pastures are discussed.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabales: Fabaceae; leucaena) is an
   exceptionally invasive weed in South-East Asia (due to its long
   flowering period and excessive seed output) causing considerable
   economic losses in Taiwan. A seed predator originating from Central
   America and inadvertently introduced to South-East Asia, Acanthoscelides
   macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae), is
   considered to be a potential augmentative biocontrol agent to check the
   spread of leucaena. To evaluate the feasibility of using A.
   macrophthalmus for biological control we investigated its development
   under six constant temperatures (15-35 degrees C). The relationship
   between temperature and developmental rate was evaluated using three
   developmental models of which the Briere model was the best fit for the
   empirical data. The lower developmental threshold (T-o), estimated by
   linear regression, was 12.8 degrees C. The thermal constant was 632.8
   degree-days (DD) for total development (egg to adult emergence). The
   proportion of females was highest and lowest at the extreme
   temperatures, 15 degrees C (100\%) and 31 degrees C (36.4\%),
   respectively. Given the compatibility between its bionomic parameters
   (the optimal temperature for development and highest proportion of
   females) and the local daily average temperatures in Taiwan,
   augmentative annual releases of beetles to restrict the spread of L.
   leucocephala appear to be a promising solution. Given the finding that
   the adult of A. macrophthalmus can effectively elongate its life span
   and increase its population densities by feeding on nutrient supplements
   in the field (e.g., saccharose), we infer that A. macrophthalmus can be
   used effectively for restricting the expansion of L. leucocephala in an
   integrated control program. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of the physical and chemical
   recovery of the substrates of waste dumps of different ages undergoing
   natural regeneration, in a calcary mining in Salto de Pirapora - SF
   Brazil. Characterization of the vegetation, vegetation and physical and
   chemical cover of the substrates of the abandoned waste dumps since 1994
   and 2013 and the soil of a native forest fragment adjacent to the mining
   was carried out. Twelve plots of 10 x 10m were allocated in each
   environment. It was verified that the soil cover rate with herbaceous,
   grassy, regenerating and litter of the sterile stacks are similar to the
   native forest fragment. The same was observed for the physical
   characterization of soil resistance to penetration, soil moisture
   content and relative light index. For the chemical characteristics, in
   all areas sampled there is aluminum deficiency which, consequently,
   presented low potential acidity and alkaline pH. The CEC of the
   substrates of the waste dumps presented values similar to the CEC of the
   native forest fragment, with abundance in some essential nutrients,
   indicating the possibility of vegetation development in the sterile
   stacks and the contribution of the natural regeneration to the
   substrates. Thus, the plant-soil relationship via natural regeneration
   in the sterile piles contributed to the improvement of the edaphic
   quality of the substrates over time, being a potential form of recovery
   in calcary mining. Thereby, the Fabaceae predominated on the waste
   dumps, especially Leucaena leucocephala, which, despite being an exotic
   species, is relevant for the current recovery stage of the substrates.},

   occurred at the early stages of infection (30 d) with T. versicolor. In
   contrast, middle lamellae remained intact in wood inoculated with T.

   of the secondary wall and degradation of the middle lamellae observed
   only in severely decayed wood at late stages. Confocal microscopy

   grass (Digitaria eriantha cv. Steudel) pastures in the Ord River
   Irrigation Area in north- west Western Australia, sometimes exhibit
   higher liveweight gains in the dry season when temperature and humidity

   difference: the combined effect of the temperature and humidity, and the
   effect of the muddy conditions in the field associated with rainfall in
   the wet summer season.
   An experiment over 81 days, from August to October 1995, was conducted
   to evaluate the effect of muddy conditions on the liveweight gain of
   cattle grazing a leucaena- pangola grass pasture. Replicated paddocks
   were grazed in a normal irrigated system during this dry season whereas
   other paddocks were flood irrigated twice weekly to create muddy
   conditions. Cattle grazing themuddypaddocks had a liveweight gain of
   0.29 kg/steer. day, which was lower (P < 0.001) than the animals in the
   dry paddocks (0.57 kg/steer. day). These cattle spent less time grazing
   (41.9 v. 67.6\% of animals grazing at three observation times, 0600,
   1100 and 1500 hours, on each day over the whole 81 days; P <= 0.001). It
   was suggested that themuddycondition of the paddock was the primary
   factor causing this difference in liveweight gain and grazing behaviour.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to determine the apparent digestibility
   and nutrient composition of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM)
   inclusion in Black Australorp and Potchefstroom Koekoek diets. Tender
   and mature leaves were separately harvested from 10 individual trees and
   stored separately for chemical analyses. The leaves were air-dried in a
   well-ventilated laboratory to constant weight and milled to pass through
   a 1-mm sieve. A mixture of tender and mature leaves was also collected
   to produce a bulk leaf meal. The four iso-nitrogenous dietary treatments
   were 0 (control), 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5\% of LLM, respectively. The apparent
   digestibility of two chicken breeds was also evaluated. The dry matter
   (DM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), ether extract (EE), cellulose and
   hemicellulose of the samples did not differ between tender and mature
   leaves. Tender leaves had higher (P < 0.05) calcium, potassium,
   magnesium and sodium concentration than mature leaves. Crude protein and
   mimosine content were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in tender than in
   mature leaves. The inclusion levels of L. leucocephala leaf meal affect
   (P < 0.05) acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and
   crude protein (CP) digestibility. Crude protein digestibility decreases
   as the inclusion levels of L. leucocephala increase. Both tender and
   mature L. leucocephala leaves have a potential nutritional value that
   can be used in feedstuff and can be used as a protein supplement for
   Black Australorp and Potchefstroom Koekoek chicken breeds.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit is a plant widely distributed in
   India and other Tropical countries widely as a source of nutrition to
   cattle and Humans. Literature review indicates varied medicinal property
   of L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit plant. However before further exploring
   its therapeutic potential, evaluation of in vitro embryotoxicity and
   teratogenic effect of the leaf extract of this plant are required to be
   performed in zebrafish model. The current study aimed to assess the
   toxicity of chloroform extract of L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit on
   Zebrafish (Danio Rerio). Successive soxhlation was carried out for
   extraction with solvent having variable polarity. Embryotoxicity and
   teratogenicity are studied by exposing twenty completely fertilized
   embryos to the extracts with varying concentrations. The zebrafish
   embryos were exposed to varying plant extract concentrations in a 0.1\%
   DMSO solution, used as control. Toxicity, teratogenicity and some
   deformities in embryos was observed at a concentration of 600 mu g/ml.
   Mortality was observed at higher concentration, whereas reduced hatching
   rate was observed with increasing concentration. Different physical
   deformities like kink tail, bent trunk, and enlarged yolk sac edema were
   attributed to the teratogenic effect of the extract observed at higher
   concentrations. Finally, LC50 value was determined to be significant
   with a p value < 0.0001. Teratogenic Index based on development of
   deformities was also significant (p value<0.0001) and claimed the
   nonteratogenic effect of the extract. The study divulges that plants
   with therapeutic efficacy could also develop some side effects when
   consumed at higher doses specially on the embryos. Detailed toxicity
   study should be carried out on medicinal plants to identify their safety
   and teratogenic effect on the embryos.},

   physiological and biochemical responses in Leucaena. The results provide
   evidence that Leucaena exhibited greater sensitivity to O-3 during
   initial exposure (up to 12 months) but showed moderate tolerance by the
   end of the 2nd year. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The study investigated the physical, chemical and combustion properties
   of wood pellets from forest residues. Wood shavings from mixed
   Dipterocarpaceae species and branch wood of Gmelina arborea and Leucaena
   leucocephala were used as feedstock. Ultimate, proximate, elemental and
   combustion analyses were performed to assess pellet quality in
   accordance with DIN 51731 (1996) for compressed solid fuel. In general,
   forest biomass used in this study formed pellets that were homogenous
   with uniform size and shape. Moisture content, particle density, bulk
   density and abrasion resistance were all within guiding values of the
   standard. Pellet samples used in this study showed relatively low levels
   of ash forming elements and heavy metals with calorific values suitable
   for industrial and residential heating applications. Combustion analyses
   of pellets from shavings and branch wood also showed that these
   materials burned freely and continuously while maintaining their
   integrity during the burning cycle. Low levels of pollutant emissions
   were detected when pellets were burned from biomass samples used in this
   study.},

Abstract = {The study evaluates the cause of the high pre-weaning kid mortality rate
   in South African Nguni goat (SANG) kids maintained on Leucaena
   leucocephala-grass pasture (LGP) as feed sources during gestation via
   reproductive performance, colostrum and milk constituents of
   mimosine-adapted South African Nguni dams. Does grazing LGP plots gained
   2.9 (P < 0.05) and 5.2 kg (P < 0.01) more in body weight between
   gestation and kidding and were 4.7 (P < 0.05) and 5.2 kg (P < 0.01)
   heavier than does on natural pasture (NP) plots during the first and
   second trials, respectively. Conception rate in the LGP treatment group
   during Year 1 trial was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in the NP
   treatment. The proportion of multiple births (>= 2 kids) on NP treatment
   was 56.2\% (100\% versus 43.8\%; P < 0.05) higher than that of the LGP
   treatment in Year 1. In Year 2, the proportion of multiple births on LGP
   treatment was 36.5\% (76.5\% versus 40\%; P < 0.05) more than the NP
   treatment. Kidding rates and prolificacy on the LGP treatment were
   better than on the NP treatment for both trials. Pre-weaning kid
   mortalities for the NP treatment group was 30.6\% higher (55.6\% versus
   25.0\%) than kid mortality recorded in the LGP treatment group in Year 1
   trial. The differences between colostrum constituents of does in both
   treatments were not significant. However, the milk total solids (TS) (P
   < 0.05), solids-not-fat (SNF) (P < 0.01) and lactose (P < 0.05) contents
   in the normal milk, and return to oestrus (P < 0.01) were significantly
   influenced by the pastures. Pre-weaning kid survival improved markedly
   in Year 2 when lactating does were offered additional nutrients during
   lactation and kids assisted to nurse colostrum-an indication that
   adequate nutrition and management practices are vital to pre-weaning kid
   survival. The higher productivity and reproductive performance of SANG
   on LGP relative to those on NP were indications that Leucaena was not
   detrimental to goats that are mimosine-adapted via the transfer of the
   bacteria Synergistes jonesii. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary In tropical livestock production, forage availability and
   quality are a serious constraint for milk and meat production. There is
   an urgent need to reduce the environmental impact of animal production
   while increasing productivity. The use of legume trees or shrubs
   associated with grasses effectively increased milk production and
   decreased the need to use nitrogen fertilizers by taking advantage of
   atmospheric nitrogen fixation.
   Abstract The objective was to evaluate milk production, N-2-fixation and
   N transfer, forage yield and composition (under two cutting intervals)
   in a silvopastoral system (SPS) with Leucaena leucocephala-Megathyrsus
   maximus and M. maximus-monoculture (MMM) with crossbred cows in a
   completely randomized design. Forage yield in the SPS was 6490 and 6907
   kg DM ha(-1) for cutting intervals (CI) of 35 and 50 days. Forage yield
   for the MMM was 7284 and 10,843 kg DM ha(-1), and forage crude protein
   (CP) was 29.0\% and 26.1\% for L. leucocephala, harvested at 35 and 50
   days, respectively. CP for the associated M. maximus was 9.9\% and 7.8\%
   for CI 35 and 50 days, respectively, and for MMM was 7.4\% and 8.4\%,
   harvested at 35 and 50 days. Milk production was 4.7 kg cow(-1) day(-1)
   for cows grazing MMM and 7.4 kg cow(-1) day(-1) under SPS. Nitrogen
   fixation in L. leucocephala (\%Ndfa) was estimated to be 89\% and 95\%,
   at 35 and 50 days, with an N-2 transfer to the associated grass of
   34.3\% and 52.9\%. SPS has the potential to fix and transfer important
   amounts of N-2 to the associated grass, and increase forage CP content
   and milk production.},

Abstract = {In order to test L. leucocephala's ability and uncover the physiological
   mechanism to adapt to draught, the paper investigated the physiological
   responses of L. leucocephala seedlings in leaf water content,
   chlorophyll content and photosynthetic capacity to drought stress.
   Results showed that the seedlings had a good ability to keep water as
   its LWC, and did not decrease significantly until 12d draught. The
   chlorophyll content increased significantly meanwhile the Chlorophyll
   (a/b) ratio decreased; The Pn, Tr and stomatal Gs of leaves
   significantly decreased, but the WUE increased; These results showed
   that L. leucocephala seedlings could maintain a reasonable physiological
   activity by keeping LWC, increasing chlorophyll content and reducing
   photosynthetic activity when subjected to drought stress. Therefore, it
   displays considerable tolerance to draught stress and could be selected
   as a suitable pioneer species for the ecological restoration of degraded
   ecosystem in Southwest China. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Cultivating maize under systems of alley cropping results in

   Studies using ground cover from tree shoots produce similar results. The

   from the tree species: neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss), gliricidia
   {[}Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp.], leucaena {[}Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.] and sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth.).
   Two treatment groups (cultivars and weed control) were evaluated. The
   cultivars AG 1041 and AL Bandeirantes were subjected to the following
   treatments: no hoeing, double hoeing, and ground a cover of branches of
   the above species when sowing the maize. A randomised block design was
   used with split lots (cultivars in the lots) and ten replications. The
   cultivars did not differ for green ear or grain yield. Double hoeing was
   more effective than ground cover at reducing the growth of weeds.
   However, both weeding and ground cover resulted in similar yields for
   green ears and grain, which were greater than those obtained with the
   unweeded maize.},

Abstract = {In tropical areas of Mexico, Leucaena leucocephala is widely used in
   silvopastoral systems. However, little information exists on other
   native woody species of high forage potential, such as Guazuma
   ulmifolia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the components of
   biomass, forage yield and quality, and availability of N in fodder banks
   of L. leucocephala, G. ulmifolia, and a mixture of both species during
   dry and rainy seasons, under sub-humid tropical conditions. The
   experimental unit was a 5 x 10 m plot, containing three rows with 2 m
   between rows; each row had 20 plant positions with 0.50 m between
   plants. Within each plant position there was either a single plant, in
   the case of pure-crop, or two plants, in the case of mixed of both
   species. A complete randomized block design with three repetitions was
   used. In both seasons, there were a significantly greater proportion of
   leaves in the G. ulmifolia fodder banks (71 \%) and in mixed fodder
   banks (69 \%) than in L. leucocephala fodder banks (64 \%).
   Consequently, these systems had leaf-to-stem ratios of 2.4, 2.2 and 1.9,
   respectively. The forage yield of fodder banks was not influenced by
   season. The mixed fodder bank had greater forage yield (5.1 t DM ha(-1))
   than the L. leucocephala fodder bank (3.4 t DM ha(-1)) in each season.
   Additionally, the mixed fodder bank accumulated more forage yield during
   the experimental period (10.2 t DM ha(-1) year(-1)) than G. ulmifolia
   (9.0 t DM ha(-1) year(-1)) or L. leucocephala (6.9 t DM ha(-1)
   year(-1)). The concentrations of CP, C and C:N were not influenced by
   season. Forage NDF and ADF concentrations were greater in the rainy
   season (476 g kg(-1) DM) compared with the dry season (325 g kg(-1) DM).
   Mixed fodder banks had the greatest N yield (185.9 kg ha(-1)) and
   consequently the greatest availability of N (371.8 kg N ha(-1)
   year(-1)). We conclude that mixed fodder banks of L. leucocephala and G.
   ulmifolia are a better option for improving productivity and forage
   quality in comparison with pure fodder banks in Yucatan, Mexico.},

Abstract = {Soaking fresh ipil-ipil, Leucaena leucocephala, leaves in tap water
   (1:1, v/v; or 50 g in 500 ml) for 30-48 hours with a water change after
   24 hours extracts at least 90\% of its mimosine, a toxic lysine
   derivative. This extraction procedure is more economical and practical
   for fish farmers than the use of dry or moist heat or iron compounds.
   Soaked or unsoaked leaves of Peruvian or Hawaiian ipil-ipil formed 1/3
   of trial diets fed to Penaeus monodon juveniles (1-2 g). Other protein
   sources consisted of fish and shrimp-head meals. A diet without
   ipil-ipil leaves (FS) served as the control.
   After 8 weeks, the mass weight of shrimp fed the FS and soaked Hawaiian
   leaf diets (HLS) was significantly (alpha=0.05) higher than soaked (PLS)
   and unsoaked (PLU) Peruvian leaves. The HLS group had a significantly
   higher survival rate than the PLS and PLU groups but not the FS-fed
   shrimps; survival among shrimp fed unsoaked Hawaiian leaves (HLU) was
   zero.
   It was found that the Hawaiian variety of ipil-ipil leaves when soaked
   for 24 hours can be incorporated in the P. monodon juvenile diet with
   good survival (87\%) under laboratory conditions. However, the optimum
   amount of leaves to be included in a low cost and efficient diet has yet

   IB, and screw withdrawal) of particleboard (density = 660 kg/m(3)) made
   of Leucaena leucocephala, rubberwood, and mixed tropical trees with
   different species ratios. The wood species ratios for the particleboards
   were 100\% Leucaena, 50\% Leucaena and 50\% rubberwood, and 50\%
   rubberwood and 50\% mixed tropical wood. Boards with the dimensions 3680
   mm x 2465 mm x 25 mm were produced. The results showed that all of the
   species ratios passed the minimum requirements for commercial use. The
   performance of the Leucaena particleboard was 17.40 MPa (MOR), 2654 MPa

   conventional protein source whereas the other two groups (LL and LLI)
   were fed a concentrate containing leucaena leaf meal so as to supply 0
   center dot 5 of the net crude protein (CP) requirements. Additionally,
   animals in group LLI were given supplemental iodine (as potassium iodide
   solution) at 0 center dot 25 mg/head/day. Wheat straw was provided ad
   libitum as the sole source of roughage during the 120 days of the
   experimental period. A metabolism trial, conducted at the end of the
   feeding trial, revealed no variation in the dry matter intake (DMI)
   among the groups. A significant (P<0 center dot 01) decline was evident
   in digestibility of CP in both the leucaena-fed groups (0 center dot 463
   and 0 center dot 482 versus 0 center dot 586) whilst that of the other
   organic components remained unaffected. Animals on the LL diet exhibited
   lower (P<0-01) nitrogen retention and average daily gain (ADG) in live
   weight (LW). Blood collected periodically was analysed for the thyroid
   hormones triiodothyronine (TO and thyroxine (T-4) as well as other
   biochemical parameters. At the end of the experimental feeding, the
   cell-mediated immune (CMI) response of the goats was assessed by
   intra-dermal inoculation of phytohaemagglutinin-P and measuring the
   change in skin thickness at various postinoculation hours. The results
   revealed that the serum concentration of glucose was significantly (P<0
   center dot 05) higher in the LLI group of animals fed leucaena with
   iodine. The concentration of cholesterol in serum of LL animals
   increased significantly (P<0 center dot 05) compared to the CON and LLI
   groups. No variation due to dietary interventions was evident in other
   indices of metabolic profile. While the concentration of circulating T-3
   remained unaffected due to dietary intervention, that of T4 reduced
   significantly (P<0 center dot 05) in the LL group. Moreover, the T4
   concentration in the LLI group remained similar to that of control
   indicative of positive impact of iodine supplementation. The immune
   response revealed that the skin thickness of animals in the LL group was
   lower (P < 0 center dot 05) as compared to the control, indicating a
   compromise of CMI response due to feeding of leucaena leaf meal.
   Supplementation of iodine appeared to be partially effective in
   potentiating the response. In conclusion, iodine supplementation could
   be adopted as a strategic management strategy to ameliorate the negative
   impacts of feeding leucaena leaf meal in growing kids.},

Title = {Subtropical dry forest regeneration in grass-invaded areas of Puerto
   Rico: Understanding why Leucaena leucocephala dominates and
   native species fail},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {267},
Pages = {253-261},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Throughout the tropics, non-native grasses invade, dominate, and persist
   in areas where subtropical and tropical dry forests have been highly
   degraded. In Central America and the Caribbean Islands, forests that
   regenerate in grass-invaded areas are generally composed of one to a few
   tree species, usually of the Fabaceae family and often non-native. We
   investigated the ecological factors that drive these successional
   patterns in southwestern Puerto Rico, where African grasses dominate
   extensive areas that are maintained by fires. The non-native legume tree
   Leucaena leucocephala commonly establishes in these areas and forms
   persistent, mono-dominant stands. We planted 455 saplings of 13 native
   tree species and Leucaena in native forest understory and in
   grass-invaded areas that were either subjected to or protected from
   prescribed fires 4 months later. We measured growth and survival to test
   the following hypotheses: (1) saplings of native species are suppressed
   in grass-invaded areas compared to the forest understory, (2) Leucaena
   saplings outperform native species in grass-invaded areas, but not in
   the forest understory, and (3) Leucaena saplings are less susceptible to
   wildfires than native species. After 20 months, 50\%, 40\%, and 3\% of
   native saplings survived in the forest, unburned-grass, and burned-grass
   treatments, respectively. Over the same period, 90\%, 80\%, and 25\% of
   Leucaena survived in the same treatments. The fires immediately killed
   65\% of native saplings and 50\% of Leucaena saplings. The majority of
   unburned native saplings died during a seasonal drought, when high
   irradiance and reduced soil organic matter content likely led to higher
   mortality in grass-invaded areas than in forest understory. Native
   species' growth was low in all treatments, yet diameter growth was
   slightly higher in the unburned grass than the forest understory.
   Leucaena saplings grew faster than the native saplings in all three
   treatments, especially in the unburned grass. Slow growth and high
   mortality of native saplings in grass-invaded areas contribute to the
   dominance of Leucaena in forests that regenerate on these sites and
   suggest that Leucaena may play a beneficial role in dry forest
   restoration in the Caribbean. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate daily weight gain (DWG), total dry
   matter (DM) intake, rumen degradability of forage, and urinary excretion
   of mimosine metabolites by hair sheep in a silvopastoral system with
   high densities of Leucaena leucocephala. A completely randomized design
   was carried out with two treatments: treatment 1 (T1) silvopastoral
   system with leucaena at a density of 35,000 plants/ha and treatment 2
   (T2), leucaena at a density of 55,000 plants/ha. Leucaena was associated
   with tropical grasses Panicum maximum and Cynodon nlemfluensis.
   Twenty-four male Pelibuey lambs of 23.2 +/- 3.4 kg live weight (LW) were
   used (12 lambs per treatment). Results showed differences (P < 0.05) in
   DWG of T1 (106.41 +/- 11.66 g(-1) sheep(-1)) with respect to that of T2
   (81.33 +/- 11.81 g(-1) sheep). Voluntary intake was higher in lambs from
   T1 (83.81 +/- 04.07 g DM/kg LW0.75) with respect to that from T2 (71.67
   +/- 8.12 g DM/kg LW0.75). There was a difference in color of urine
   between sheep of T1 and T2, the latter giving positive results for the
   presence of metabolites derived from mimosine (3-4 dihydroxypyridine and
   2-3 dihydroxy pyridone). Rumen degradability of DM of L. leucocephala
   was higher (P < 0.05) compared to that of P. maximum and C. nlemfluensis
   (72.94 +/- 0.40 vs. 67.06 +/- 1.50 and 63.25 +/- 1.51 \%, respectively).
   It is concluded that grazing at high densities of L. leucocephala
   affects daily weight gain of hair sheep, possibly due to ingestion of
   high amounts of mimosine which may exert an adverse effect on voluntary
   intake.},

Abstract = {The leguminous shrub Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is widely used as

   Glomus aggregatum in a highly, weathered soil for its effectiveness to
   enhance P uptake and growth of L. leucocephala. Phosphorus status of L.
   leucocephala pinnules monitored as a function of time revealed that

   Mortierella sp. increased the P content of mycorrhizal plants by, 13\%

   phosphate. Shoot dry, weight measurements showed that Mortierella sp.
   stimulated growth of nonmycorrhizal by 22\%, while it stimulated the
   growth of mycorrhizal plants by 29\%, regardless of P fertilization. The
   results suggest the existence Of synergistic interaction between P

   kg(-1) of CP and NDF, respectively. Four treatments (4 lambs/treatment)
   were Control (no extract added), SB (SB extract at 30 ml d(-1)), LL (LL
   extract at 30 ml d(-1)) and SBLL (mixture of SB at 15 ml d(-l) +LL at 15
   ml d(-1)). Extracts were administered orally to each lamb before the
   morning meal daily. Measurements were on days 22 (P1), 43 (P2) and 63
   (P3) of the experiment. Ruminal pH increased (P=0.014) with SBLL extract
   and decreased with SB. The ratio of acetate to propionate was higher
   (P=0.042) with SBLL compared to the control. Ruminal NH3-N concentration
   was not affected by extract administration (P=0.309) or experimental
   period (P=0.087). Protozoal counts were not affected (P=0.489) by
   extract addition but decreased (P < 0.001) in P3 compared with P1 and
   P2. Uric acid concentration increased (P < 0.001) with individual
   extracts of SB and LL compared with the control or SBLL. Excretion of
   other purine derivatives (allantoin, xanthine, and hypoxanthine),
   creatinine and microbial protein synthesis were not changed (P > 0.05)
   by extracts administration. Overall, oral administration of S.
   babylonica and L leucocephala extracts, or their 1:1 mixture, to lambs
   for 63 d had only minor effects on ruminal fermentation, urinary purine
   derivative excretion and microbial protein synthesis. Published by

Abstract = {The recovery of a single application of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala)
   leaf N (78 kg N ha(-1)) in a maize crop, the hedgerow and the top 10 cm
   soil of a leucaena alley cropping system was measured for 236 d through
   the use of N-15 labeled residues. The leucaena-derived-N (LDN) was
   followed in the surface litter and the soil-litter - separated by a
   flotation method on water - during the same period.
   At 45 and 129 d after the residue application (DAA), only 4.2 and 10.0\%
   of the added leucaena N was recovered in the maize crop while the
   aboveground hedgerow incorporated 9.6 and 9.4\% in its first and second
   canopy regrowth. At 45 and 129 DAA, 19.7 and 13.2\% remained in the
   surface litter and soil. Total recoveries were 33.5 and 42.2\% on the
   respective dates. The C and N content of the coarse (larger than 2 mm)
   and fine (between 2 and 0.25 mm) soil-litter fraction of the top 5 cm
   layer strongly increased after residue application. Soil total C in the
   total soil-litter decreased from 22\% at 45 DAA to 8\% at 236 DAA. A
   significant positive relationship (1\% level) was found between the
   microbial biomass C and the total soil-litter C. The LDN release rate
   from the combined surface litter-coarse soil-litter was 0.0477 d(-1),
   while the fine soil-litter had a LDN release rate of 0.0083 d(-1). Only
   8.6\% of the released surface litter-coarse soil-litter LDN entered the
   fine soil-litter pool. These turnover rates lead to a poor
   synchronization of the LDN released from all litter pools with the maize
   LDN uptake during the first 45 d of maize growth, while between day 45
   and 129, all released LDN was recovered either in the soil, maize or
   hedgerow. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd},

   corresponded to the maximal reflectance from the psyllids' preferred
   site of alightment, the young expanded leaves of the leguminous tree,
   Leucaena leucocephala (Lamarck) de Wit. The high reflectance intensity
   (RI) of super yellow cards compared to the lower RIs of less preferred
   yellow cards suggest that both wavelength and intensity of relected
   light influence responses of H. cubana to its host tree. The relatively
   low trap catches compared to the population in the held, and the
   pronounced orientation observed in previous experiments to the odor of
   visually-obscured L. leucocephala seedlings, suggests that olfaction is
   more important than vision in host selection by H. cubana.},

Abstract = {Invasive species threaten crops and ecosystems worldwide. Therefore, we
   sought to understand the relationship between the geographic
   distribution of species populations and the characteristics of seeds
   using new techniques such as seed image analysis, multivariate analysis,
   and machine learning. This study aimed to characterize Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. seeds from spatially dispersed populations
   using digital images and analyzed their implications for genetic
   studies. Seed size and shape descriptors were obtained using image
   analysis of the five populations. Several analyses were performed
   including descriptive statistics, principal components, Euclidean
   distance, Mantel correlation test, and supervised machine learning. This
   image analysis technique proved to be efficient in detecting biometric
   differences in L. leucocephala seeds from spatially dispersed
   populations. This method revealed that spatially dispersed L.
   leucocephala populations had different biometric seed patterns that can
   be used in studies of population genetic divergence. We observed that it
   is possible to identify the origin of the seeds from the biometric
   characters with 80.4\% accuracy (Kappa statistic 0.755) when we applied
   the decision tree algorithm. Digital imaging analysis associated with
   machine learning is promising for discriminating forest tree
   populations, supporting management activities, and studying population
   genetic divergence. This technique contributes to the understanding of
   genotype-environment interactions and consequently identifies the
   ability of an invasive species to spread in a new area, making it
   possible to track and monitor the flow of seeds between populations and

Title = {Effect of Leucaena leucocephala and corn oil on ruminal
   fermentation, methane production and fatty acid profile: an in
   vitro study},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {61},
Number = {5},
Pages = {459-469},
Abstract = {Aims
   This in vitro study aimed to examine the effect of proportions of
   Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) to Napier grass
   (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach) or levels of corn oil (CO) and their
   interaction on ruminal fermentation, methane (CH4) production and fatty
   acid profile.
   Methods
   The experiment was conducted as a 4 x 3 factorial arrangement following
   a completely randomised design with two factors. The treatments were
   according to the proportion of Leucaena and Napier grass (in g/kg DM,
   Treatment (T)1 = 0 : 750 (control), T2 = 250 : 500, T3 = 500 : 250, T4 =
   750 : 0). Three levels of CO (in mg rumen fluid, CO1 = 0, CO2 = 10, CO3
   = 20 respectively) were added to each of the diet, giving a total 12
   dietary treatments.
   Key results
   Replacing Napier grass with Leucaena at 500 g/kg (T3) and 750 g/kg (T4)
   levels increased the molar volatile fatty acid concentration, microbial
   protein synthesis (P < 0.001) and ammonia nitrogen concentration (P =
   0.003), whereas ruminal protozoa concomitantly decreased (P < 0.05). The
   addition of CO at 10 mg also reduced the number of ruminal protozoa
   compared with the control (P < 0.001). A significant Leucaena x CO
   interaction was observed on the increase of ammonia nitrogen and
   microbial protein synthesis, and CH4 production was simultaneously
   suppressed (P < 0.001). There was also a significant Leucaena x CO
   interaction on increasing concentration of C18:1 cis-9, C18:2 cis-10
   cis-12 and alpha-linolenic acid, which thus contributed to the increase
   of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulation in the culture (P <
   0.001). However, the concentration of C18:0 was not influenced by the
   treatments (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion
   This study demonstrated that the inclusion of Leucaena into a Napier
   grass-based diet at 500 g/kg and 750 g/kg DM positively affected rumen
   fermentation, reduced CH4 formation and increased beneficial fatty acids
   in the rumen. Although CO had similar positive effects on CH4 production
   and targeted beneficial fatty acids, it reduced the microbial protein
   synthesis at inclusion of 20 mg/mL DM. Overall, there were synergistic
   interactions between Leucaena and CO in reducing CH4 production and
   improving the fatty acid profile in the rumen.
   Implications
   It is possible to improve animal productivity while reducing the
   environmental impact of livestock production through inclusion of
   tannin-containing Leucaena and CO in ruminant diets in tropical regions
   where C4 grasses typically have low nutritive value.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Condensed tannin (CT) fractions of different molecular
   weights (MWs) may affect rumen microbial metabolism by altering
   bacterial diversity. In this study the effects of unfractionated CTs
   (F0) and five CT fractions (F1-F5) of different MWs (F1, 1265.8 Da; F2,
   1028.6 Da; F3, 652.2 Da; F4, 562.2 Da; F5, 469.6 Da) from Leucaena
   leucocephala hybrid-Rendang (LLR) on the structure and diversity of the
   rumen bacterial community were investigated in vitro.
   RESULTS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay showed that the total
   bacterial population was not significantly (P > 0.05) different among
   the dietary treatments. Inclusion of higher-MW CT fractions F1 and F2
   significantly (P <0.05) increased the Fibrobacter succinogenes
   population compared with FO and CT fractions F3-F5. Although inclusion
   of FO and CT fractions (F1- F5) significantly (P <0.05) decreased the
   Ruminococcus flavefaciens population, there was no effect on the
   Ruminococcus albus population when compared with the control (without
   CTs). High-throughput sequencing of the V3 region of 16S rRNA showed
   that the relative abundance of genera Prevotella and unclassified
   Clostridiales was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased, corresponding with
   increasing MW of CT fractions, whereas cellulolytic bacteria of the
   genus Fibrobacter were significantly (P < 0.05) increased. Inclusion of
   higher-MW CT fractions Fl and/or F2 decreased the relative abundance of
   minor genera such as Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, Clostridium XIVa and
   Anaeroplasma but increased the relative abundance of Acinetobacter,
   Treponema, Selenomonas, Succiniclasticum and unclassified Spirochaetales
   compared with the control and lower-MW CT fractions.
   CONCLUSION: This study indicates that CT fractions of different MWs may
   play an important role in altering the structure and diversity of the
   rumen bacterial community in vitro, and the impact was more pronounced
   for CT fractions with higher MW. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry},

Abstract = {The effects of soils collected from Khan Towel, Tanveer Garment, One
   Tech Rubber and One Tech Ply Board factories in the vicinity of Korangi
   and Landhi industrial areas were studied on the growth of Leucaena
   leucocephala under natural environmental conditions in a greenhouse.
   Plants of L. leucocephala which were grown in soils of Tanveer Garment
   factory showed reductions in many of the growth variables like root
   length, shoot length, seedling length, plant cover, number of leaflets.
   leaf area and dry weights of root, shoot and leaf and total plant dry
   weight (which included root, shoot and leaf dry weights) as compared to
   plants grown in soil of a control area (Karachi University Campus soil).
   Khan Towel and One Tech Rubber factory soils caused decrease in the
   growth parameters such as number of leaflets and dry weights of root,
   shoot and leaf and total plant dry weight of L. leucocephala as compared
   to plants in control area soil whereas root/shoot ratio was reduced in
   plants which were grown in One Tech Ply Board factory soil over the
   control soil. Growth of L. leucocephala was mostly increased in soil of
   a control area when compared to soil of Tanveer Garment factory. The
   amount of total Soluble salts and available Sulfate in all of the
   industrial areas soils were higher relative to a control area soil of
   Karachi University Campus. Total soluble salts and copper were found in
   highest extent in the soil of Khan Towel factory as compared to a
   control area soil. Tanveer Garment factory soil had lowest organic
   matter and highest amount of zinc than control soil. In the case of one
   Tech Rubber factory, the amount of coarse sand and concentration of
   Calcium carbonate was mostly increased over the control soil whereas
   level of chromium was hi.-her in One Tech Rubber factory soil than a
   control soil. Soil of One Tech Ply Board factory had highest magnitude
   of available sulfate relative to the control soil.
   The research demonstrated that the growth of L. leucocephala was greatly
   reduced in plants which were grown in soil of Tanveer Garment factory
   than a control area soil of Karachi University Campus. Khan Towel and
   One Tech Rubber factory soils showed reductions in various growth
   variables of L. leucocephala. This showed that the soil of industrial
   areas of Korangi and Landhi, particularly of Tanveer Garment factory
   followed by Khan Towel factory and One Tech Rubber factory is
   contaminated by the existing pollution in the area.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the development and
   appropriate techniques for the production of Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) de Wit., seedlings. Already established techniques to break the
   seed's dormant state were tested. Then the most effective techniques
   were used to test the influence of organic substrates. The studied plant
   was chosen because of its use as an excellent source of protein and good
   quality forage for animals. Thirteen different treatments were used to
   break dormancy: group without treatment; immersion in water at room
   temperature for 12, 24, and 36 h, immersion in hot water at 80 degrees C
   for 5, 10, and 15 min, thermal shock at 100 degrees C; immersion in
   sulfuric acid for 6 and 10 seconds; immersion in caustic soda for 6 and
   10 seconds; and scarification with a metal file. The two best treatments
   to break dormancy of the seedings, which were the immersion in hot water
   at 80 degrees C for 5 min and scarification with the metal file, were
   tested in four different substrates: control group, group 2 - sheep
   manure, group 3 - poultry manure, and group 4 - cattle manure. The most
   effective organic fertilizer was the the substrate with poultry manure.},

Abstract = {The effects of different levels of Leucaena leucocephala and Manihot
   esculenta leaves' supplementation on in vitro gas production, rumen

   (PD) were investigated. Seven treatment groups -T1:C/rice straw (RS)
   (40:60) (Control); T2:C/RS/leucaena leaves (40:45:15); T3:C/RS/leucaena
   leaves (40:30:30); T4:C/RS/leucaena leaves (40:15:45); T5:C/RS/cassava

   acetate, propionate, butyrate and total VFA were found to increase
   significantly in T7. No significant difference was observed in in vitro
   gas production except the control diet although in vitro dry matter
   digestibility (IVDMD) was recorded significantly decreased.
   Determination of urinary PD, rumen fermentation and microbial population
   were done using 21 local Boer goats. Rumen NH3-N, acetic and total VFA
   production were found to improve (P < .05) in all supplemented group.
   Significant (P < .05) reduction was noted in the urinary allantoin
   production and total PD at T7. The populations of total protozoa and
   Ruminococcus flavefacien had significantly increased (P < .05) while
   Ruminococcus albus, and Fibrobacter succinogenes were significantly
   reduced (P < .05) in supplemented group. In conclusion, the result from
   the present study suggested that 25\% of L. leucocephala leaves diet and
   50\% of M. esculenta leaves diet can be incorporated in the goat diet so
   as to improve the nutritive value of poor quality diet.},

Abstract = {A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of
   applying elemental sulphur inoculated with Thiobacillus or gypsum, on
   dry matter production and nitrogen fixation of Leucaena leucocephala and
   Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia grown in a soil with high sodium content and

   The treatments consisted of the addition of elemental sulphur at two
   levels (0.3 or 0.6 t/ha), and gypsum at two levels (0.6 or 1.2 t/ha).
   Plants were irrigated with saline water (containing NaHCO3, NaCl, MgCl2,

Abstract = {Twenty-three provenances of Gliricidia sepium and eleven isolines of
   Leucaena leucocephala were examined at a low and at high phosphate
   levels (20 and 80 mg P kg-1 soil) for growth, phosphate (P) uptake and
   use efficiency.  Large differences in growth at the low P level, and in
   growth response to the higher P rate occurred among L. leucocephala
   isolines and G. sepium provenances.  Shoot dry weight at low P varied
   from 1.30 to 3.01 g plant-1 for L. leucocephala and from 1.44 to 3.07 g
   plant-1 for G. sepium.
   Leucaena isolines had only half the root weight of G. sepium provenances
   yet produced approximately 90\% of the shoot weight of the corresponding
   G. sepium treatments, i.e. more than a 2-fold difference in root/shoot
   ratios.  Total P in shoots of G. sepium was some 85\% greater than of
   the respective L. leucocephala isolines in corresponding treatments. 
   Physiological phosphate use efficiency (g shoot/mg P in shoots) (PPUE)
   was not a simple reciprocal relation, being markedly lower at higher
   shoot \% P and content.  However, for the same shoot P both species
   produced the same shoot weight.  Nevertheless, there were apparent
   genotypic differences within species in the root development, shoot P
   and PPUE.
   In another study, the numbers of rhizobia in the rhizosphere of L.
   leucocephala, nodulation, N2 fixation at five different levels of P were
   determined.  The numbers of rhizobia in the rhizosphere of inoculated L.
   leucocephala during the first two weeks were lower when P was added but
   later became similar to those without added P. Nodules formed earlier
   than inoculated plants fertilized with P and in greater numbers (4- to
   5-fold) and dry weights than in those without P.  However, the
   percentage of N2 derived from fixation did not change with increasing
   levels of P application.  These results suggest that the observed P
   effect did not operate via stimulated growth of rhizobia in the
   rhizosphere, nor through increased N2 fixation rate.  The major effect
   appeared to be due to effects via plant growth.},

Abstract = {This study examined the nutritional and reproductive performance of
   female goats (12) maintained on a basal diet of wheat straw supplemented
   either with a concentrate based on soybean meal (SBM) or Leucaena
   leucocephala-Morus alba-Azadirachta indica (2:1:1) leaf meal mixture
   (LMAM) prior to conception, and during gestation (8) in a completely
   randomized design. The LMAM and SBM supplements were nutritionally
   similar in terms of dry matter intake (DMI) (66.55 vs. 63.60 g/kg
   W-0.75), digestibility of major nutrients and pattern of nitrogen
   retention. The nutritive value of composite diets and plane of nutrition
   of gravid does were similar irrespective of dietary treatments to
   maintain desired net body weight gain and foetall growth rate.
   Similarly, average daily gain of gravid does (43.47 vs. 45.87 g), foetal
   growth rate (32.13 vs. 29.96 g per day) and birth weight of kids (1.92
   vs. 2.03 kg) were comparable between the SBM and LMAM treatments. The
   concentration of blood constituents (haemoglobin, packed cell volume,
   glucose, serum urea), major fractions of serum protein (total protein,
   albumin and globulin ratio, A:G ratio) and activity of various serum
   enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate
   aminotransferase) were within the normal range in does irrespective of
   dietary treatment or stage of pregnancy. Apparently, the supplementation
   of wheat straw either with LMAM or commercial type concentrate
   containing SBM resulted in similar performance of does; and that the
   LMAM could contribute up to 0.36 of the total DMI in gravid does without
   any adverse effect on their general health and reproductive performance.

Abstract = {Thirty two Katandin x Pelibuey crossbreed male lambs 3-4 months of age
   and 24 +/- 0.3 kg body weight (BW) were used to study effects of
   administration of extracts rich in secondary compounds from Salix
   babylonica (SB) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL) on feed intake, nutrient
   digestibility and growth. After 2 weeks of adaptation consuming a total
   mixed ration (TMR; 219 and 141 g/kg of crude protein (CP) and neutral
   detergent fibre (NDFom), respectively), lambs were weighed and
   distributed by BW into 4 pens of 8 lambs/pen in a completely randomized
   design with: Control group TMR; SB group TMR (as Control plus S.
   babylonica extract at 30 ml/d); LL group TMR (as Control plus L
   leucocephala extract at 30 ml/d); SBLL group TMR (as Control plus 30
   ml/d of S. babylonica and L leucocephala extracts in a (1:1, v:v)
   mixture) for a 63 days experiment. Weekly stock volumes (21 each) of the
   individual extracts as well as their 1:1 mixture were prepared for daily
   administration. Extracts were orally administered before the 08:00 h
   feeding to each lamb. Feed intake was recorded daily and BW was recorded
   at d 22 (P1), d 43 (P2) and d 63 (P3) of the experiment. Each
   experimental period ended with a digestibility measurement. Average
   daily gain (ADG), metabolizable protein (MP) intake and metabolizable
   energy (ME) intake were calculated. Plant secondary metabolites of total
   phenolics, saponins and the aqueous fraction were 50\% lower in SB
   versus LL extracts. An extract x experimental period interaction
   occurred for intake of all nutrients (SB > LL = Control > SBLL, P<0.05).
   Intake of DM, OM, CP and ADFom were lowest in P3 than other periods,
   whereas the highest nutrients intake were in P2 and P1 (P<0.05).
   Individual extracts improved (SB > LL, P=0.05) the digestible DM, OM, EE
   and CP more than their 1:1 mixture compared with control or SBLL.
   Digestible DM was improved (P=0.03) by 5 and 3\% with SB and LL extracts
   respectively, compared to control, whereas digestible CP was improved
   (P=0.005) by 7 and 5\%, respectively, compared to control. Digestible
   ADFom was drastically lower in P1 and increased steadily in periods P2
   and P3 (P<0.001). Feed intake was not affected by extract addition
   although it was reduced from P1 and P2 to P3. Relative to control,
   addition of extracts increased (P=0.024) ADG while the other performance
   parameters (i.e., MP intake, ME intake) had a tendency (P=0.05) to
   improve with extract addition. ADG was improved by about 22 and 21\%
   with SB and LL extracts respectively, while their mixture (i.e., SBLL)
   was 2\% compared to control (i.e., SB = LL > Control = SBLL, P=0.024).
   MP and ME intakes were decreased (P<0.0001) from P1 and P2 to P3.
   Results show that daily administration of individual extracts of S.
   babylonica and L leucocephala improved lamb performance by 22 and 21\%,
   but that a mixture of both had a much lower benefit. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {In tropical cropping systems with few external inputs, efficient
   management of mineral N derived from added organic residues is essential
   for the proper functioning of the system. We studied the dynamics of
   mineral nitrogen (N) in the top 100 cm of soil with a system of
   tensiometers and suction cups after applying N-15-labelled Leucaena
   leucocephala and Dactyladenia barteri residues to bare and cropped
   microplots installed in the respective alley cropping systems, and
   followed the fate of the N for two maize-cowpea rotations (1992 and
   1993).
   Fifty days after applying the residues (DAA), 20\% of the added residue
   N was found in the soil profile of the bare Leucaena treatment, and 5\%
   under Dactyladenia, compared with 5\% and 1\%, respectively, where
   cropped. All values decreased to about 1\% after 505 days. In the
   cropped soil, no mineral N derived from the residues was lost by
   leaching during the first 6 weeks.
   As the maize grew, the soil profile was gradually depleted of nitrate to
   near zero in the Dactyladenia treatment, whereas during the cowpea
   season the amount of nitrate N increased to 36 kg N ha(-1) for the
   Leucaena treatment, and 26 kg N ha(-1) for the Dactyladenia treatment.
   The soil of the bare microplots contained substantially more nitrate N
   (98 and 47 kg N ha(-1) during the first year on average, under Leucaena
   and Dactyladenia, respectively) than that of the cropped microplots,
   except during the 1993 cowpea season. Nitrate residing in the subsoil
   (80-100 cm) in the bare treatments was not readily leached to deeper
   soil. The risk of losses of native mineral N was greatest during the
   first 50 DAA and to a lesser extent during the cowpea seasons. Improved
   management of the hedgerows could increase the potential of the hedgerow
   trees to recycle mineral N.},

Abstract = {A shortage in the rubberwood supply is becoming a reality in Malaysia.
   To find alternative raw materials for Malaysian wood-based industries,
   fast-growing species have been identified and need to be analyzed in
   particleboard manufacturing. This study evaluated the properties of
   particleboard made with a 50: 50 ratio of Neolamarckia cadamba and
   Leucaena leucocephala with melamine urea formaldehyde as the resin at
   different contents (10\%, 12\%, and 14\%) and particle sizes (1.0 mm,
   2.0 mm, and unscreened particles). The particleboards were tested
   according to EN 312 (2003). The results showed that the particleboard

Abstract = {Bioactive constituents from natural sources are of great interest as
   alternatives to synthetic compounds for the treatment of various
   diseases, including diabetes mellitus. In the present study,
   phytochemicals present in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit leaves
   were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and further
   examined by qualitative and quantitative methods. a-Amylase enzyme
   activity assays were performed and revealed that L. leucocephala (Lam.)
   De Wit leaf extract inhibited enzyme activity in a dose-dependent
   manner, with efficacy similar to that of the standard a-amylase
   inhibitor acarbose. To determine which phytochemicals were involved in
   a-amylase enzyme inhibition, in silico virtual screening of the
   absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties
   was performed and pharmacophore dynamics were assessed. We identified
   hexadecenoic acid and oleic acid ((Z)-octadec-9-enoic acid) as a-amylase
   inhibitors. The binding stability of a-amylase to those two fatty acids
   was confirmed in silico by molecular docking and a molecular dynamics
   simulation performed for 100 ns. Together, our findings indicate that L.
   leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit-derived hexadecanoic acid and oleic acid are
   natural product-based antidiabetic compounds that can potentially be
   used to manage diabetes mellitus.},

   adopted. Growing goats were used; the control group being fed only on
   pasture, and the other groups supplemented with ground maize at 0.5, 0.9
   and 1.3\% of live weight. Supplementation reduced grazing time and
   increased rumination and idle time; although the goats spent
   approximately 85\% of the time grazing on grasses, indicating a
   preference for this forage. Energy supplementation increased the weight
   gain per animal per unit area. Under a silvopastoral system of leucaena
   and tropical grasses, goats prefer the grasses, however, grazing on the
   legume results in a protein intake that justifies additional energy
   input. The supplementation of goats under a silvopastoral system of
   tropical grasses and leucaena, with maize as an energy source at a rate
   of up to 1.3\% of live weight, influences feeding behaviour, having a
   favourable effect on animal performance.},

Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi inoculation is considered a potential
   biotechnological tool for an ecofriendly remediation of hazardous
   contaminants. However, the mechanisms explaining how AM fungi attenuate
   the phytotoxicity of metal(oid)s, in particular arsenic (As), are still
   not fully understood. The influence of As on plant growth and the
   antioxidant system was studied in Leucaena leucocephala plants
   inoculated with different isolates of AM fungi and exposed to increasing
   concentrations of As (0, 35, and 75 mg dm(-3)) in a Typic
   Quartzipsamment soil. The study was conducted under greenhouse
   conditions using isolates of AM fungi selected from uncontaminated soils
   (Acaulospora morrowiae, Rhizophagus clams, Gigaspora albida; and a mixed
   inoculum derived from combining these isolates, named AMF Mix) as well
   as a mix of three isolates from an As-contaminated soil (A. morrowiae,
   R. clams, and Paraglomus occultum). After 21 weeks, the activities of
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX),
   and glutathione reductase (GR) were determined in the shoots in addition
   to measuring plant height and mineral contents. In general, AM fungi
   have shown multiple beneficial effects on L. leucocephala growth.
   Although the activity of most of the stress-related enzymes increased in
   plants associated with AM fungi, the percentage increase caused by
   adding As to the soil was even greater for non-mycorrhizal plants when
   compared to AM-fungi inoculated ones, which highlights the
   phytoprotective effect provided by the AM symbiosis. The highest P/As
   ratio observed in AM-fungi plants, compared to non-mycorrhizal ones, can
   be considered a good indicator that the AM fungi alter the pattern of
   As(V) uptake from As-contaminated soil. Our results underline the role
   of AM fungi in increasing the tolerance of L. leucocephala to As stress
   and emphasize the potential of the symbiosis L. leucocephala-R. clams
   for As-phytostabilization at moderately As-contaminated soils. (C) 2017

   limed with 0, 1 and 2 times the equivalent amounts of exchangeable A1.
   In contrast to the control, without lime in the surface soil, the limed
   surface-soil treatments allowed plant-root systems to develop through
   acid soil layers as thick as 90 cm. In other experiments, PVC
   {[}polyvinyl chloride] bottomless pots (tubes), 12 cm diameter .times.
   30 cm high, were filled with the Ultisol or Oxisol and limited according
   to the criteria used in the tube experiments; P, K, micronutrients and
   rhizobium were added. After development of the plants for 1 mo., the PVC

   leucaena trees may be established in acid soils if all leucaena
   requirements are satisfied in the 30 cm surface layer of soil. Thus, the
   costly process of liming the entire land surface may be avoided.
   Long-term development of leucaena plants under these conditions remains

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of Leucaena leucocephala-Morus
   alba-Tectona grandis (2:1:1) based leaf meal mixture as a protein
   supplement to partially (50\%) replace conventional supplements on the
   performance of female goats. Local female goats (12) were divided into
   three groups in a completely randomized design to receive either a leaf
   meal mixture (LMTM) based supplement, or groundnut cake (GNC) or soybean
   meal (SBM) incorporated concentrate, and wheat straw as basal diet for a
   period of about 4 months. Blood enzymes and immunological profile were
   monitored in all goats at 0, 30, 60 and 90 days of feeding. While dry
   matter intake (DMI) (g kg(-0.75) BW) of goats given LMTM was higher (P <
   0.05) than SBM, it was comparable to their counterparts fed GNC.
   Digestibility of nutrients, except for depressed crude protein
   digestibility (P < 0.05) in SBM group, was comparable among dietary
   treatments. Nitrogen intake and fecal excretions were similar
   irrespective of supplements, the urinary excretion of N in goats given
   GNC was significantly higher than comparable excretion in goats on LMTM
   and SBM. Balance of N (g per day) remained positive in all goats,
   however it was significantly higher in animals on LMTM as compared to
   GNC. The DCP, TDN and ME values of the composite diets were comparable
   among dietary treatments. Intake of DCP, TDN and ME was close to
   stipulated NRC requirements. Blood enzymes (alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
   alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) and
   serum protein electrophoresis pattern (albumin, alpha-globulin,
   beta-globulin and gamma-globulin) did not differ significantly due to
   the replacement of 50\% dietary protein by LMTM throughout the
   experiment. It may be concluded that leaf meal mixture could be used
   inexpensively as a vegetable protein supplement to wheat straw based
   diets for goats without any adverse effect on voluntary intake, nutrient
   utilization, serum enzymes and immune status. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {A change over design was used to study in two experiments the effect of
   inclusion of a Cuban natural zeolite (5\%) in a soybean/grain meal
   formulated to contain 20\% leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit)
   meal. Responses criteria were apparent ileal and rectal digestibility
   and N balance indices in 6 Yorkshire x Landrace castrate male pigs each
   weighing on average 50 kg of initial live weight. In experiment 1,
   inclusion of 5\% zeolite in the diet, determined a decrease in rectal
   digestibility of organic matter from 83.3-77.4\% (p<0.10) and from
   78.3-72.4\% (p<0.05), respectively. In experiment 2, ileal digestibility
   of energy and N increased (p<0.05) respectively when 5\% zeolite was
   added to the diet. Faecal concentration of total short chain fatty acids
   and ammonia were significantly (p<0.05) higher in pigs fed tire diet
   containing zeolite (103 and 30 mmol/100 g DM) than when the animals were
   given the control feed (85 and 20 mmol/100 g DM) indicating a net
   capture of these metabolites by zeolite. In intact animals, a trend for
   retention of N to be higher in the diet with zeolite than in the other
   with no zeolite (48.4 and 47.0\% of N intake) was noted. It is suggested
   that the inclusion of 5\% of a Cuban natural zeolite in the diet is
   beneficial for digestive processes in the pig when this animal species
   is fed tree foliage as leucaena leaves. The incorporation of zeolite to
   this type of diet could influence pig digestive processes in a positive
   manner, probably in N economy. Other trials could be conducted to fix
   the optimal level of inclusion of zeolite in this type of diets.},

Abstract = {Symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a complex process that
   involves rhizobia, a diverse group of alpha and beta-proteobacteria
   bacteria, and legume species. Benefits provided by BNF associated with
   legume trees in tropical environments include improvements to efficiency
   of nitrogen (N) use, increase of soil carbon sequestration,
   stabilization of soil organic matter, decrease of soil penetration
   resistance, and improvement of soil fertility. All these benefits make
   BNF a crucial ecosystem service to the sustainability of tropical
   agriculture. Due to the importance of this ecological process and the
   high diversity of rhizobia, these bacteria have been extensively
   characterized worldwide. Currently, over 400 species of rhizobia are
   known, distributed into seven families. In the humid tropics, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Acacia mangium, Gliricidia sepium, and Clitoria
   fairchildiana are four of the most common species used by family farmers
   to create sustainable agricultural systems. These four legumes perform
   symbiosis with different groups of rhizobia. Exploring BNF could help to
   enable sustainable intensification of agriculture in the humid tropics,
   mainly because it can increase N use efficiency in an environment where
   N is a limiting factor to plant growth.},

Abstract = {Natural materials have a high potential to be used as
   coagulant/flocculant owing to the problems of inorganic materials. Petai
   belalang (Leucaena leucocephala) is a widely abundant plant in Malaysia
   and very efficient as a plant-based coagulant in previous research. This
   research investigated the effectiveness of seeds of L. leucocephala in
   removing turbidity from synthetic wastewater and the effect of operation
   parameters of jar test on treatment performance through optimization of
   dosage, pH, rapid mixing speed and time, slow mixing speed and time, and
   settling time. The water extraction method was used to extract the
   active ingredients from the seeds by drying and pulverizing the seeds
   and then dissolving them in distilled water at a concentration of 20
   g/L. The extraction solution of the seeds gives removal efficiency of
   turbidity of 93.05\% at the optimum operation parameters dosage, pH,
   rapid mixing speed and time, slow mixing speed and time, and settling
   time of 120 mg/L, 6.5, 260 rpm for 11 min, 30 rpm for 15 min, and 30
   min, respectively. It is expected that bridging was the possible
   mechanism given that the flocs are formed under the same negative zeta
   potential condition. With this high performance of L. leucocephala, it
   has high potential to be used as a coagulant in wastewater treatment at
   specific operation parameters with further exploration to determine the
   optimum extraction method of the active ingredients.},

Abstract = {Helicoverpa armigera, a highly polyphagous pest, has a broad host
   spectrum, causes significant levels of yield loss in many agriculturally
   important crops. Serine primarily responsible for most of the
   proteolytic activity in the larval gut of lepidopteron insects. Neonate
   larvae were reared on artificial diet and chickpea seeds smeared with
   Subabul Trypsin Inhibitor. Larvae fed with artificial diet showed
   reduction in larval weight up to 21\% (HSTI) and 43\% (LSTI). However,
   larvae fed on seeds showed significant reduction in weight, 52.4\%
   (HSTI) and 60.3\% (LSTI), suggesting that the diet also plays a vital
   role on the effectiveness of the inhibitors on larval growth and
   development. HSTI and LSTI inhibited the gut proteinases from larvae fed
   on artificial diet significantly (41.40\% and 64.36\%) compared to the
   gut proteinases (27.80\% and 38.90\%) from larvae fed on chickpea seeds.
   Seeds smeared with 10,000 TIU resulted in complete mortality of larvae
   while there was no mortality observed in artificial diet. The results
   reveal that LSTI is a stronger inhibitor of insect gut proteinases and
   for larvae fed with poor nutrition in the natural ecosystems, low level
   expression of inhibitor would be enough to affect the growth and
   development.},

Abstract = {Increasing concentrations of ground-level ozone (O-3) exert significant
   impacts on the plants, but there is limited data for belowground
   processes. We studied the effects of long-term exposure of elevated O-3
   (EO3) on plant growth parameters (plant height and biomass) and
   biochemical parameters (nutrients, microbial biomass and enzymatic
   activities) of rhizospheric soil of leguminous tree species Leucaena
   leucocephala. L. leucocephala seedlings were grown under ambient O-3
   (AO(3)) and EO3 (+20 ppb above ambient) under Free Air Ozone
   Concentration Enrichment (O-3-FACE) facility and changes in plant growth
   and their rhizospheric soil properties were studied during 6, 12, 18 and
   24 months of EO3 exposure. L. leucocephala showed significant reductions
   in shoot length, root biomass, shoot biomass, leaf biomass and total
   biomass during 12, 18 and 24 months of exposure to EO3. Total nutrients
   in rhizospheric soil like carbon and phosphorus were significantly
   reduced after 24 months of EO3 exposure. Most of the available nutrients
   showed significant reduction after 6, 12 and 24 months of EO3 exposure.
   A significant decrease was apparent in microbial biomass carbon,
   nitrogen and phosphorus after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of EO3 treatment.
   Significant reductions were observed in extracellular enzymatic
   activities (dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glycosidase,
   fluorescein diacetate, arylsulfatase, cellulase and protease) of soil
   after 6, 12 and 24 months of EO3 exposure. These results suggest that
   increasing O-3 concentrations will directly impact L. leucocephala
   growth as well as have indirect impact on the nutrient contents (C, N,
   and P), microbial biomass and extracellular enzymatic activities of
   rhizospheric soil of L. leucocephala. Our results suggest that
   continuous increase in O-3 concentrations will have serious implications
   for aboveground plant growth and belowground soil fertility in this
   region considered as O-3 hotspot.},

Title = {Factors affecting the early growth of Leucaena leucocephala .1. Effects
   of nitrogen, phosphorus, lime and irrigation at three sites in
   south-east Queensland},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {27-34},
Abstract = {Slow establishment has been identified as a major limitation to the more
   widespread adoption of the fodder tree Leucaena leucocephala in
   Queensland. Field experiments were conducted at Mt Cotton, Gayndah and
   Theodore in south-east Queensland during the 1987-88 summer to identify
   the major factors limiting first year yield of leucaena. Treatments at
   each site included irrigation (applied at sowing only, or at intervals
   throughout the trial), and rates of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and
   lime. Attack by psyllid insects, weed competition and defoliation by
   wildlife were noted and minimised where possible.
   Soil moisture appeared to be the major limitation to plant growth at the
   inland sites of Theodore and Gayndah where post-establishment irrigation
   increased final dry weight by 250\%. Waterlogging reduced plant height
   increase at the low lying Mt Cotton site following higher than normal
   rainfall. Increase in plant height at the other sites stopped when night
   temperatures fell below 15 degrees C.
   Application of P at 75-1200 kg/ha tripled final dry weight of leucaena
   at Mt Cotton (5 mg/kg bicarbonate-extractable P) but had no effect at
   Theodore (10 mg P/kg) or Gayndah (35 mg P/kg). Larger than normal
   responses to P during early growth may be due to slow colonisation of
   the roots by arbuscular mycorrhiza. Application of N (200 kg N/ha)
   increased dry weight of Rhizobium-inoculated leucaena by 27\% at
   Theodore but had little or no effect at the other sites. Application of
   lime had no significant effects on plant height or dry weight of
   leucaena at Mt Cotton despite the soil being slightly acidic (pH 5.9 in
   1 : 5 H2O suspension).
   Further work on the role of colonisation by arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi
   in determining uptake of P by leucaena is warranted in view of the large
   response to very high rates of P in young seedlings at Mt Cotton.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to evaluate the productive and reproductive
   performance of dual-purpose (DP) cows with a restricted concentrate
   allowance and access to a forage association of Leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala) and Stargrass (Cynodon nlemfuensis). Twenty-four
   multiparous Holstein x Zebu cows were used during the first 98 days
   postpartum. Treatments were control (CT): nightly grazing of Stargrass +
   commercial concentrate (3.97 kg dry matter {[}DM]/d), and Leucaena (LT):
   nightly grazing of Stargrass + commercial concentrate (1.97 kg DM/d) + 4
   h grazing on an association of Leucaena/Stargrass. The actual time spent
   browsing Leucaena represented 38\% of the total time of consumption. The
   bite rate of Leucaena was 22 5 bites/min with a bite size of 0.541 +/-
   0.08 g DM. The estimated intake of Leucaena per cow was 503 +/- 228 g
   DM/d. Milk yield per cow was similar (P > 0.05) between treatments (CT =
   12.28 +/- 0.6 kg/d, LT = 11.97 +/- 0.6, TL = 11.9 0.6) with a similar
   composition (P > 0.05). There were no differences (P > 0.05) between
   treatments for changes in live weight (CT -29.6 kg, LT -33.3 kg) and
   body condition (CT -1.3, LT -1.4, in a 1-9 scale). Population of ovarian
   follicles per cow was similar between treatments throughout the
   experiment. Pregnancy rate was 33\% for CT and 25\% for LT, with no
   significant differences (P > 0.05). Grazing an association of Leucaena
   and Stargrass can replace part of the concentrate without detrimental
   effects on production and reproduction in DP cows.},

Abstract = {A greenhouse investigation was conducted to determine the effect of
   arbuscular mycorrhiza and drought on the growth of two tropical hedgerow
   legume trees (Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala) under
   simulated eroded soil conditions. It was a factorial design with two
   levels of watering regime (adequate watering and drought), inoculation
   with Glomus deserticola (with and without), and two soil types (0-30 cm
   topsoil and 30-60 cm subsoil). Each treatment was replicated 3 times.
   After ten drought cycles, the growth of Gliricidia sepium in the subsoil
   was enhanced by mycorrhizal inoculation under both watering regimes
   whereas there was no significant contribution of mycorrhizal inoculation
   to the growth of L. leucocephala in both soil types under the two
   watering regimes. Drought stress significantly reduced most growth
   parameters for the two tree species in both soils with or without fungal
   inoculation. The N-fixing activity of Gliricidia sepium benefited from
   Glomus deserticola inoculation while that of L. leucocephala was not
   significantly affected in the top-soil. Mycorrhizal colonization was
   reduced for both tree species in the subsoil compared to the topsoil
   while it was significantly increased for both species in the subsoil
   when compared to the uninoculated subsoil counterpart. In the subsoil,
   inoculation of Gliricidia sepium with the mycorrhizal fungus increased
   root colonization by 89\% and 73\% under adequate watering and drought,
   respectively, whereas L. leucocephala had only a 38\% and 42\% increase
   in root colonization under comparative conditions in the subsoil. Thus
   Glomus deserticola inoculation may be beneficial to the growth of
   Gliricidia sepium in a badly eroded site where topsoil is missing.},

Abstract = {Twelve males and twelve females weaner goats with mean initial body

   stover treated with urea (30 g urea in 600 mi of water kg(-1) dry matter
   (DM) maize stover) and a protein supplement containing 30\%, 67\% and
   3\% of cotton seed cake (CSC), maize bran (MB) and a mineral mixture,
   respectively, were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments. These
   consisted in the replacement of 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3 of CSC and proportional
   amounts of maize bran by dry Leucaena leucocephala (DLL) to achieve
   isoprotein diets. Feed intake and growth performance were recorded for
   90 days. Nutrients digestibility and nitrogen utilization was also
   performed on the 12 male goats allocated to treatments. The DM, crude
   protein (CP) and metabolizable energy (ME) intakes were not
   significantly (P>0.05) different between treatments and mean daily gains
   were not significantly (P>0.05) affected by dietary treatment.
   Digestibility coefficients of DM, organic matter (OM) and CP decreased
   with increasing levels of leucaena in the diets, but the differences
   between diets were small. Digestibility coefficients of neutral
   detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) were significantly
   (P<0.05) reduced when CSC was wholly replaced with DLL. The highest
   efficiency of N utilization (68.97+/-5.14\%) was shown by goats on
   treatment 3 (T3). It can be concluded that DLL can substitute up to 2/3
   of CSC as a protein supplement to ::oat weaners without reduction in

   interaction of pruning quality and method of pruning application on N
   recovery and maize grain yield. For most MPT species used, incorporated
   prunings gave high nitrogen recovery compared to surface applied
   prunings. In order to achieve synchrony between N supply from prunings
   and N demand by a maize crop, relatively large amounts of N should be
   released into the soil before peak N demand by the maize crop. This
   could be achieved by incorporating adequate quantities of high quality

Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, a possible virus and nematodes have
   been recorded on Leucaena leucocephala and at least seven other Leucaena
   species throughout the tropics.  Most diseases are caused by fungi and
   include leaf spots, gummosis, pod rots, root and collar rots, stem
   cankers, anthracnoses, damping-off, rusts and shoot and twig blights. 
   The most important diseases are considered to be Camptomeris leaf spot
   (CLS) (Camptomeris leucaenae), gummosis and various root and pod rots. 
   Although not a lethal disease, CLS can cause serious forage dry matter
   and quality losses.  Gummosis is regarded as the most important disease
   of L. leucocephala in India and Sri Lanka, but further work is urgently
   required on its pathology and economic importance.  Root rots caused by
   Ganoderma species, Fusarium species, Pseudolagar-obasidium leguminicola
   and Pirex subvinosum kill L. leucocephala trees throughout Asia and
   Australia.  Pod rots caused by Fusarium species are of major concern not
   only because of their direct effects in reducing seed production but
   also due to their seed-borne nature.  Control strategies based on
   resistance and cultural management through cutting and grazing are
   considered the most practical and economic methods.  Treatments to
   control seed-borne pathogens are essential to reduce establishment
   problems and for low-risk germplasm movement.  This review is intended
   to be of use for pasture and forestry researchers as well as quarantine
   officers in developing countries.},

   diets. In the lactation trial, 15 does in mid-lactation were allocated
   to three dietary treatments in a 3 X 3 Latin square design with five
   square replications. In the digestion trial, six intact yearling male
   goats were assigned to the same treatments in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin
   square design. Diets were based on kinggrass and supplemented with
   either a commercial concentrate feed, gliricidia or leucaena. In the
   control diet, 60\% of the total dietary N was supplied by the
   concentrate. In the legume-supplemented diets, gliricidia or leucaena
   replaced approximately 50\% of the N supplied by the concentrate. Dried
   banana fruit (Musa x paradisiaca) was used in the legume-supplemented
   diets to equal the energy content of the control diet. Diets contained
   approximately 2.2\% N and 73\% total digestible nutrients. Legumes were
   greater in total N concentration than kinggrass, with leucaena
   containing more N than gliricidia (P<0.05). Size and degradation rate of

Abstract = {The presence of the toxic amino acid mimosine in Leucaena leucocephala
   restricts its use as a protein source for ruminants. Rumen bacteria
   degrade mimosine to 3,4- and 2,3-dihydroxypyridine (DHP), which remain
   toxic. Synergistes jonesii is believed to be the main bacterium
   responsible for degradation of these toxic compounds but other bacteria
   may also be involved. In this study, a commercial inoculum provided by
   the Queensland's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry was
   screened for isolation and characterization of mimosine, 3,4- and
   2,3-DHP degrading bacterial strains. A new medium for screening of
   2,3-DHP degrading bacteria was developed. Molecular and biochemical
   approaches used in this study revealed four bacterial isolates -
   Streptococcus lutetiensis, Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacillus
   vitulinus, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens - to be able to completely
   degrade mimosine within 7 days of incubation. It was also observed that
   C. butyricum and L. vitulinus were able to partially degrade 2,3-DHP
   within 12 days of incubation, while S. lutetiensis, was able to fully
   degrade both 3,4 and 2,3 DHP. Collectively, we concluded that S. jonesii
   is not the sole bacterium responsible for detoxification of Leucaena.
   Comprehensive screening of rumen fluid of cattle grazing on Leucaena
   pastures is needed to identify additional mimosine-detoxifying bacteria
   and contribute to development of more effective inoculums to be used by
   farmers against Leucaena toxicity.},

   of dietary supplements to meet the nutritional needs of sheep. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementation
   with high-protein feed on mutton sheep performance and yield in Massai
   grass pastures during the dry season. The treatments corresponded to
   four supplements, namely Leucaena leucocephala leaf hay, Gliricidia
   sepium leaf hay, soybean meal, and a treatment that received only
   multiple mixture (protein salt) ad libitum. The pasture was evaluated
   for canopy height, forage supply, and chemical composition of leaf
   blade, stem and dead material. Average daily gain, weight gain per area,
   and the stocking rate were also evaluated. There were four grazing
   cycles because the grazing method was rotational stocking with seven
   days of occupation and 35 days of rest. The interaction between
   supplements and grazing cycles was not significant, and no effects of
   the supplements were found for any of the variables. The highest forage
   and leaf blade offerings were observed in the first grazing cycle. The
   highest levels of crude protein and lower neutral detergent fibre and
   lignin of pasture components were observed in cycles 3 and 4. The
   highest average daily gains per animal and per area were observed in
   cycles 1 and 2. Protein supplementation of sheep in Massai grass
   pastures promotes satisfactory gains during the dry season, and Leucaena
   and Gliricidia hays can be used as protein sources instead of soybean
   meal.},

Abstract = {Introduced into several countries worldwide for agroforestry, Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit is a typical conflict species' that invades
   several riparian, forested and disturbed habitats in South Africa. The
   seed beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae:
   Bruchinae) was subsequently deployed as a seed-reducing agent to offset
   its excessive seed output. However, exploratory egg-exposure trials, in
   which native Acacia s.l. trees were used as surrogate host plants',
   suggested that high egg mortality is reducing the beetle's impact. The
   aims of this study were to (1) verify this suspicion by comparing the
   mortality of eggs exposed in L. leucocephala and Acacia nilotica (L.)
   Willd ex Del. stands and (2) determine whether height of exposure in the
   canopy (i.e. oviposition site selection) influences the different
   mortality factors. Although lower than in the exploratory trials, egg
   mortality was considerable, ranging from 30 to 50\% in most instances.
   While unaffected by height of exposure, the overall egg mortality (i.e.
   all factors) was significantly lower in seeds exposed on L.
   leucocephala. Mortality was not only mostly attributed to parasitism
   (51\% of mortality), but also predation (30\%) and unknown factors
   (19\%). While unexplained mortality and predation were not influenced by
   tree species or height of exposure, parasitism increased significantly
   with height above ground and was significantly lower in seeds exposed on
   L. leucocephala. Egg mortality is thus one of several factors that
   appears to be limiting the efficacy of A. macrophthalmus in South
   Africa.},

Abstract = {Propagule supply and habitat suitability strongly influence the success
   of invasive alien plants. Thus, an invaded area is likely to have an
   adequate propagule supply, a suitable habitat, or both for species
   persistence. Based on this idea, we classified invaded areas into four
   categories as follows but with establishment still occurring in some
   cases: Class 1, adequate propagule supply and habitat suitability; Class
   2, adequate propagule supply but limited habitat suitability; Class 3,
   limited propagule supply and adequate habitat suitability; and Class 4,
   mid- to low-level propagule supply and habitat suitability. We propose a
   framework for the classification of invaded areas into these four
   classes and present a case study in which this framework was applied.
   Classifying target areas in this manner could facilitate more efficient
   and practical management planning, thereby saving time and resources. We
   selected the alien shrub Leucaena leucocephala L. (Fabaceae) as a model
   species, which has invaded the Nakodo-jima Island in the Ogasawara
   Archipelago of Japan. We developed a species distribution model by
   incorporating proxy variables for propagule supply and habitat
   suitability as well as submodels for propagule supply or habitat
   suitability. Using these submodels, we estimated the levels of propagule
   supply and habitat suitability in each, and classified the current
   distribution range appropriately. Using these classifications, land
   managers could set priorities to concentrate their efforts to
   efficiently control target species.},

Abstract = {Bruchine beetles are highly host-specific seed feeders during the larval
   stage. Although some specific parasitoid families have been recorded
   attacking bruchine beetles, most studies have been done at small spatial

   geographic distribution of parasitoid species parasitizing bruchines is
   scarce, especially at a wide geographic area that extends over large
   distances through a latitudinal cline (i.e. large-scale spatial
   structure). The present study determined the species richness and
   evenness of parasitoids attacking the bruchine beetle Acanthoscelides
   macrophthalmus feeding on Leucaena leucocephala seeds, examined their
   geographic distribution, and characterized the large-scale spatial
   structure in parasitoid species composition. A total of 1420 parasitoids
   (all Hymenoptera) belonging to four families, five subfamilies and eight
   species were collected (genera: Horismenus, Paracrias, Urosigalphus,
   Stenocorse, Chryseida, Eupelmus). Most parasitoid species showed wide
   spatial distribution, high evenness in species abundance and the species
   richness estimators were close to stabilization (approximately eight
   species). Overall, greater similarity was observed in the species
   composition of plant populations near to each other than those farther
   apart, revealing a large-scale spatial structure in parasitoid species

Abstract = {Subabul (Leucaena Leucocephala) leaves although highly palatable and
   rich in protein has a limitation as a fodder due to the toxic mimosine
   content, which generally causes hypothyroidism and alopecia in animals.
   Studies on the reproductive performance of female goats were carried out
   by feeding green subabul leaves as a sole feed or at 50\% level of
   roughage or 100\% crude protein requirements over a period of 4 weeks to
   14 months. The studies showed that out of 35.5\% of pregnant goats,
   44.5\% aborted at different stages of gestation. Feeding of 50\% subabul
   roughage for 3 to 8 months showed that 3 out of 5 (60\%) animals had
   conceived and I animal aborted, while at 100\% crude protein levels, the
   conception rate was 80\% and no abortions took place indicating that the
   reproductive failures and abortions were proportional to the daily
   ingestion of subabul leaves and mimosine. Thyroid glands of all the
   experimental groups were enlarged weighing 1.78 to 5.75g and exhibited
   colloidal and hyperplastic goitrogenic changes. Thyroid glands of the
   aborted fetus and the kids born to the subabul fed animals were also
   enlarged weighing 0.526 to 3.5g; showed parenchymatous and colloidal
   goiter indicating that subabul feeding not only caused hypothyroidism
   and reproductive failures in the female goats but also caused congenital
   goiter in the progeny. These finding suggested that subabul feeding
   would adversely affect the reproductive performance of the female
   animals and is hazardous.},

   species, but the initial growth of plant height showed the best results
   with floating seeds when compared to no protection for the species L.

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is a shrub rich in proteins and mimosine. This
   high-density crop is cultivated to increase protein intake in cattle
   production systems. Mimosine is an antimitotic and its effect on the
   endometrium is still unknown. It is presumed that it could accumulate in
   the endometrial tissue, inhibiting the development of the endometrial
   glands, which are in charge of nurturing the embryo. The objective of
   this study was to determine mimosine accumulation in the endometrial
   tissue as a result of the consumption of L. leucocephala and to observe
   its effect in the development of the endometrial glands of early
   postpartum cows in a silvopastoral system. Twenty-four Bos indicus. Bos
   taurus cows were divided in two treatments: grazing in a silvopastoral
   system (SSP, n = 12), formed by the association of Cynodon nlemfuensis
   and L. leucocephala, var. Cunningham; and grazing in a monoculture
   system (SM, n = 12) of C. nlemfuensis. Mimosine consumption per kilogram
   of live weight was estimated based on the daily consumption of mimosine
   per cow. Mimosine concentration in the uterine tissue was determined
   using HPLC. A Student's t test (p <= 0.05) was applied to contrast the
   differences between the mimosine concentration in the endometrial tissue
   of functional and non-functional glands. Mimosine accumulated in the
   endometrial tissue of SSP cows. Its concentration ranged from 51.02 to
   63.45 mu g g(-1) of endometrial tissue (TE). The endometrial glands had
   a normal development, with <= 53.73 mu g g(-1) mimosine concentration in
   TE. By contrast, with 60.81 mu g g(-1), or higher, TE concentrations,
   endometrial glands showed signs of atrophy. Daily mimosine consumption
   in the SSP was 0.019 g kg(-1) live weight. Mimosine from L. leucocephala
   consumption accumulates in the endometrial tissue and can cause
   endometrial glands atrophy in early postpartum cows.},

Journal = {SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Aim of study: To investigate the effect of feeding foliage of leguminous
   trees on growth rate, semen characteristics, and sexual behavior of
   bucks.
   Area of study: Northeastern Mexico.
   Material and methods: Twenty-two young goat bucks were randomly
   allocated to one of four treatment groups: 33\% alfalfa hay (dry matter
   basis), 33\%; Acacia farnesiana; Leucaena leucocephala; or Prosopis
   laevigata foliage (n=4 for alfalfa; n=6 for the rest of groups).
   Main results: Average daily gain (ADG) did not differ between bucks fed
   alfalfa, A. farnesiana, or L. leucocephala (120 +/- 26, 134 +/- 37, and
   103 +/- 29 g/d, respectively), but ADG of bucks offered P. laevigata was
   the lowest (72 +/- 8 g; p<0.05). Bucks fed alfalfa had the highest feed
   efficiency (6.59 +/- 1.25 kg of feed consumed/kg of gain; p<0.05) and
   bucks offered leguminous trees had the lowest (average 9.85 +/- 2.3).
   Bucks offered alfalfa, and A. farnesiana had increased (p<0.05) scrotal
   circumference (26.6 +/- 0.4 and 25.8 +/- 1.5 cm) than bucks fed L.
   leucocephala, or P. laevigata (24.3 +/- 1.2 and 24.1 +/- 2.0 cm). Mean
   ejaculate volume was two-fold higher in alfalfa-fed bucks than all other
   dietary treatments. Sexual behavior did not differ among bucks fed the
   different legumes.
   Research highlights: Foliage of both A. farnesiana and L. leucocephala
   could totally replace alfalfa hay for rearing growing goat bucks in
   confinement without affecting daily weight gain, most semen
   characteristics, and copulation ability. P. laevigata reduced body
   weight and reproductive function.},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted during 1992-93 to 1998-99 on sandy-loam
   soil (Typic Ustochrept) in semi-arid conditions, to evaluate the
   production potential of rice (Oryza saliva L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum
   L. emend. Fiori \& Paol.) system in sole and alley cropping with subabul
   (Leucaena leucocephala) under integrated nitrogen supply system. In
   alley cropped rice-wheat system, loppings of L. leucocephala
   incorporated @ 6 tonnes/ha/year in the soil as green manure before rice
   and wheat planting added approximately 80 kg organic nitrogen/ha/year to
   system which replaced 25\% mineral fertilizer N. Increasing levels of
   nitrogen enhanced grain yield of rice and wheat significantly up to 90
   kg N/ha, beyond which increase was marginal and non-significant.
   Further, association of L. leucocephala reduced grain yield of rice and
   wheat by 9.9 and 5.5\% compared to sole cropping of rice and wheat
   respectively. In addition to this, L. leucocephala also provided 6-7
   tonnes/ha/year green fodder and 5-6 tonnes/ha/year fuel wood and
   resulted in net saving of Rs 6,539/ha/year at 90 kg N/ha. Green manuring
   of L. leucocephala decreased the pH of soil from 8.74 to 8.43 and bulk
   density from 1.70 to 1.50 g/cc and soil organic carbon by 39.10,
   nitrogen content by 24.10, available P2O5 by 13.40, available K2O by
   18.40 and infiltration rate by 38.20\% under alley cropping, but a
   slight change in these soil characteristics was also observed under sole
   cropping of rice-wheat system.},

Pages = {17-26},

Abstract = {The use of agroforestry systems in which pruning from trees is used to
   mulch the companion crops is an important area of research in the
   tropics. However, previous studies mostly evaluated the contribution of
   mulch to soil improvement and rarely examined the effect of mulch on
   weeds. Field experiments were conducted during the 1995 and 1996 growing
   seasons to investigate the effects of mulch from three woody fallow
   species on weed composition, biomass and maize grain yield. Treatments
   consisted of mulch from Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, and
   Senna siamea applied at rates of five and three tons dry matter ha(-1)
   at planting and three weeks after planting (WAP), respectively, an
   unmulched treatment that received 90 kg N ha(-1) of inorganic
   fertiliser, and an unmulched control plot that received no fertiliser.
   In both years and sampling dates, plots mulched with G. sepium and S.
   siamea had significantly lower weed density and biomass than the control
   plot in each of the sampling times and year of study. There was no
   significant difference in either weed density or biomass between the
   plot mulched with L. leucocephala and the unmulched plots. Mulches from
   G. sepium and S. siamea reduced weed density and weed biomass, while L.
   leucocephala was less effective in reducing weed biomass and weed
   density. Weed reduction by the mulches was in the order G. sepium
   greater than or equal to S. siamea > L. leucocephala. Sedges were the
   dominant species in all the treatments except in G. sepium plots, where
   Talinum triangulare and other broadleaved species were dominant.},

Abstract = {To develop silvicultural methods for dipterocarp species in degraded
   lands in a tropical monsoon climate, we examined uneven-aged forest
   management, in which dipterocarp trees were planted under nurse trees,
   by monitoring their growth for 20 years. In 1989, seedlings of four
   dipterocarp species (Dipterocarpus alatus, D. turbinatus, Hopea odorata
   and Shorea henryana) were planted beneath a 3-year-old Leucaena
   leucocephala plantation and in an open site in Sakaerat, north-east
   Thailand. The survival rate and tree size of the dipterocarp seedlings
   were monitored at both sites until 1995. Surand svival rates of the
   dipterocarp trees were significantly better under the Leucaena
   plantation. However, no apparent difference was observed in basal area
   between both sites, since saw vigorous growth of the surviving seedlings
   compensated for the loss of dead seedlings at the open site. Our results
   showed that D. alatus and H. odorata could be planted in an open site
   due to the vigorous growth of the seedlings, but that it was preferable
   to plant D. turbinatus beneath nurse trees. The Leucaena plantation was
   partially thinned to 50, 75 and 100\% (clear-cut) in 1993, and the
   survival rate and growth of the dipterocarps was monitored until 2009.
   Thinning had no apparent effect on the survival rates of the dipterocarp
   seedlings. Although relative growth rates (RGR) of the dipterocarps
   reduced after thinning, thinning rates did not affect the growth of the
   dipterocarps. After thinning, dipterocarp trees overtook Leucaena in
   height at all thinning rates, possibly from 1999. An uneven-aged system
   combining Leucaena and dipterocarp trees is likely to be applicable to
   several dipterocarp species.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of magnitude and timing of weed seedling flushes is crucial in
   managing weeds adequately. Such knowledge is especially important for
   small-scale farmers in West Africa who spend a greater percentage of
   family labour in controlling weeds. This study assessed the composition,
   pattern and magnitude of seedling emergence of weed communities of a
   maize/cassava association in three types of fallow and four landuse
   intensities (continuous cropping or zero-fallow, 1 year of cropping
   followed by 1, 2, and 3 years fallow) over a 6-year period in Ibadan,
   Nigeria, West Africa. The study was carried out on a sandy loam (oxic
   paleustaff and psammentic ustorthent), <2\% organic matter, and pH 6.2.
   Rainfall pattern at the study site is bimodal with average annual
   precipitation of 1250 mm. Weed seedling composition in the bush fallow
   treatment differed with year (e.g. seedling composition increased from
   30 species in 1990 to 41 species in 1995) and was different from
   Leucaena leucocephala and Pueraria phaseoloides fallow treatments where
   volunteer seedlings of the respective fallow types were also present. At
   the initiation of the study, 1990, the seedling community was dominated
   by perennial weeds (60\%). After 6 years, 84\% of the weed seedlings
   were broadleaf (53\% annuals and 31\% perennials). Weed seedling
   emergence differed with type of fallow, landuse intensity and year
   (P<0.01). Weed seedlings emerged throughout the sampling period of 3-15
   weeks after planting (WAP) crops. The highest number of weed seedlings
   emerged early in the season (3-5 WAP) followed by a second but smaller
   peak flush at 8-9 WAP and a decline over the rest of the sampling period
   in all types of fallow, landuse intensity, and years except in 1994.
   Natural bush and L leucocephala fallow had more weed seedlings than R
   phaseoloides fallow in all years except 1993 and 1995. Continuously
   cropped plots and plots cropped every other year had more emerged weed
   seedlings than plots that were cropped once followed by 2-3 years of
   uncropped fallow. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Introduced from Central America for agroforestry, Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) De Wit (Fabaceae) has become invasive in several tropical and
   subtropical regions worldwide. The seed beetle Acanthoscelides
   macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was
   released in South Africa in 1999 to curb the plant's high seed
   production. Monthly sampling was conducted during 2011/2012 at four
   sites in KwaZulu-Natal Province to determine the reproductive phenology
   of L. leucocephala populations, the levels of seed damage inflicted by
   A. macrophthalmus, and the extent to which the beetle has recruited
   native parasitoids. There were typically two podding cycles annually,
   with variations in peak pod production between sites and periods of very
   low seed availability. The levels of pre-dispersal seed damage on
   canopy-held pods were erratic, fluctuating greatly between months and
   sites, and seldom exceeding 50\%. Levels of post-dispersal damage on
   soil-surface seeds were substantially lower, seldom exceeding 5\%.
   Parasitism of the larval/pupal stages of A. macrophthalmus also varied
   between months and sites, reaching a maximum of 45\%. There was a
   moderate but significant negative correlation between percentage seed
   damage and seed availability, indicating higher damage during periods of
   seed scarcity. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between
   percentage parasitism and seed infestation by A. macrophthalmus. These
   trends suggest that neither A. macrophthalmus nor its recruited
   parasitoids are tracking resource availability, ensuring a negligible
   impact on seedling recruitment. Additional seed-reducing agents,
   particularly insects that exploit green pods, are required to regulate
   L. leucocephala populations in South Africa.},

Abstract = {Different cattle production interventions have been proposed to reduce
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase animal productivity, but few
   studies have identified their real potential under grazing conditions
   and at the whole system level. The aim of this study was to determine
   the effect of silvopastoral systems (SPS) with Leucaena leucocephala on
   total GHG emissions, emission intensity, GHG balance and cattle
   productivity in a series of production scenarios in northern Colombia. A
   life cycle analysis (LCA) approach was used to evaluate one baseline
   system (BL) based on pastures and four SPS intervention scenarios. For
   this analysis, the emissions from enteric fermentation and manure were
   determined in situ. Methane emissions from enteric fermentation were
   9.7\% lower in the SPS with leucaena than in BL systems (p = 0.0369).
   Emission factors for manure were higher in the BL systems (p < 0.05) as
   were emission intensities to produce one kg of fat and protein corrected
   milk (FPCM) and one kg of live weight gain (LWG). For animal production
   and GHG balance, it was found that the inclusion of leucaena increased
   animal production up to four times compared to the BL system and
   mitigated GHG emissions per hectare up to 86\% due to carbon
   sequestration. In conclusion, leucaena SPSs are an alternative to
   mitigate climate change under grazing conditions, as they reduce GHG
   emissions and increase animal productivity.},

   nitrogen balance was estimated in the range of 55-1560 for crops and
   22-2400 USD ha(-1) yr(-1) for pastures, the latter showing positive

Abstract = {Objective. To determine the effectiveness of mycorrhizal-arbuscular
   fungi (AMF) of soils with different agricultural uses, in the middle

   experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions, where Leucaena
   leucocephala was used as the indicator plant, which was planted in
   masons with an Andisol soil (horizon B) used as a substrate. This
   substrate was inoculated separately with samples from seven soils (Ap
   horizon), as a source of AMF, from the Turipana Research Center in
   Agrosavia. As controls we included inoculation with HMA Glomus
   fasciculatum and one non-inoculated one. The effect of mycorrhizal
   inoculation was evaluated by monitoring the foliar P content in L.
   leucocephala plants, as a function of time to 64 days, when the dry mass
   of its aerial part and mycorrhizal colonization was determined. Results.
   The growth of L. leucocephala and the foliar P content was significantly
   higher when the soil was inoculated with G. fasciculatum, in comparison
   to that observed with the other treatments. Likewise, mycorrhizal
   colonization was very high in the roots of L. leucocephala that grew in
   the soil inoculated with G. fasciculatum and lower in the other
   treatments. Conclusions. The results indicate that the native AMF of
   soils with different uses, from Turipana, exhibited low potential to
   develop mycorrhizal symbiosis, which limited the growth and
   concentration of leaf P in the host plant.},

   on native mimosoid Fabaceae that are closely related to L leucocephala A
   preliminary field assessment of the beetle s susceptibility to native
   parasitoids was also undertaken The beetle s life cycle includes several
   attributes (e g rapid reproductive maturation, high rates of
   oviposition) that favour high population densities in the field Although
   adults oviposited on the seeds of all test plant species during no
   choice tests, oviposition was significantly higher on L leucocephala
   While several hatching larvae survived to adulthood on L leucocephala,
   single adult individuals were reared from the seeds of each of three non
   target species Also, during multichoice tests the beetles displayed
   strong oviposition preferences for L leucocephala Two hymenopteran
   parasitoid species were reared from seeds containing larvae which were
   exposed in the field, but overall levels of parasitism were low These
   results confirm that the host range of A macrophthalmus is largely
   restricted to the genus Leucaena that native mimosoid Fabaceae are
   unlikely to be at risk and that the decision taken in 1999 to release
   the beetle was justified},

   fed GBC than CC (1385 vs 1331 g/d). The DM intake for LBC (1343 g/d) was
   similar to CC (1331 gld). The DM intake of hay was also higher (p<0.05)
   in goats fed GBC (834 g/d) than those receiving LBC or CC (789, 782 g/d,
   respectively). Animals supplemented with GBC recorded positive (11 g/d)
   weight gain while the other groups lost weight (13, 14 g/d) for LBC and
   CC respectively, although these differences were not statistically
   significant (p>0.05). The composition of milk were: butterfat 58, 49 and
   55 g/kg; crude protein 37.0, 35.4 and 36.1 g/kg; lactose 33, 29 and 30
   g/kg; Ash 8.5, 8.5 and 7.9 g/kg and total solids 136.5, 121.9 and 129.0
   g/kg, for goats fed LBC, GBC and CC respectively. There were no
   differences in the composition of milk due to these dietary treatments.
   At the end of performance trial, a digestibility trial was conducted
   using 6 female goats allocated to the three treatments (LBC, GBC and CC)
   in an incomplete randomized block design and each goat received a
   different supplement in each of two successive periods. There were no
   differences in nutrient digestibility except for DM, which was higher
   (p<0.05) in CC compared to the other treatments (615, 622, 720 g/kg for
   LBC, GBC and CC, respectively). Economic analysis showed that CC diet
   was more expensive (0.20 US\$/kg) and had a lower margin over
   supplementation (0.11 US\$) compared to LBC and GBC (0.13 vs 0.12
   US\$/kg and 01.5 vs 0.12 US\$, respectively). It is concluded that the
   Leucaena and Gliricidia could contribute as nitrogen sources in
   compounded diet supplements without any detrimental effects on
   production in dairy goats.},

Abstract = {The tree legume Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a high quality
   ruminant feed, vitally important for livestock production in the
   tropics, despite the presence of mimosine in the leaves. This toxic
   non-protein amino acid has the potential to limit productivity and
   adversely affect the health of animals. In the 1980s, the ruminal
   bacterium Synergistes jonesii was discovered and subsequently
   distributed in Australia as an oral inoculum to overcome these toxic
   effects. However, in recent times, a number of factors, including:
   surveys of the status of toxicity worldwide; improved understanding of
   the chemistry and mode of action of the toxins; new techniques for
   molecular sequencing; and concerns about the efficacy of the in vitro
   inoculum; have cast doubt on some past understanding of leucaena
   toxicity and provide new insights into the geographical spread of S.
   jonesii. There is also confusion and ignorance regarding the occurrence
   and significance of toxicity in many countries worldwide. Ongoing
   research into the taxonomy and ecology of the Synergistetes phylum,
   improved methods of inoculation, and improved management solutions,
   along with awareness-raising extension activities, are vital for the
   future success of leucaena feeding systems.},

Abstract = {Flavonol glycosides found in the leaves of L. leucocephala comprised the
   3-arabinosides, 3-rhamnosides and 3-glucuronides of quercetin and
   myricetin, and quercetin-3-rhamnosylglucoside, at a total concentration
   of 3-4\%. In cultivars of high productivity (Peru, El Salvador (K28) and
   Cunningham) all 7 compounds occurred with a largely constant pattern of
   relative concentrations. However, in the cosmopolitan form naturalized
   throughout the tropics the 3-arabinosides were invariably absent. The
   same feature which was conspicuous on the high performance liquid
   chromatography trace, occurred with a low frequency (.apprx. 10\%) in
   `'Peru'' and `'Cunningham''. The pattern provides a quick method for
   identifying the provenance of commercial leucaena leaf meal, and also
   for detecting blending or adulteration with other leaf meals. The
   flavonol glycoside distribution of those species associated with
   leucaena leaf meal (Acacia villosa, Calliandra calothyrsus, Manihot
   utilissima and Sesbania grandiflora) is very different, and all have
   fewer compounds. All compounds occur in the apical tissue of young
   leucaena seedlings, enabling identification of cultivar from seed in 10
   days. Comparison of leaf flavonol patterns for L. leucocephala, L.
   pulverulenta their known F1 hybrid, and an entity known locally in Java
   as L. glabrata strongly suggest a hybrid for the latter.},

   progression of vermicompost maturity. The pressmud and green manure
   substrates promoted more biomass of E. eugeniae, while cow dung with

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {In southern Benin, West Africa, two alley cropping systems were studied
   from 1986 to 1992. Yield development was followed in a maize and cassava
   crop rotation vs. intercropping system, with alleys of Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. vs. a no-tree
   control, with and without NPK fertiliser. Without alleys, NPK
   fertilisation maintained high yield levels of 2-3 t maize dry grain plus
   4-6 t ha(-1) cassava root DM in intercropping, 3-4 t ha(-1) maize and
   6-10 t ha(-1) cassava in solecropping. Without NPK, final yields seemed
   to stabilise at about 1 t maize plus 2 t cassava in intercropping and
   twice as much in each solecrop. Alley cropping induced significant yield
   increases by about 50\% with both tree species in unfertilised,
   intercropped maize, and with Cajanus in fertilised, solecropped cassava.
   In monetary terms, the NPK-fertiliser response of stabilised yields was
   significant for all treatments except the solecropped Leucaena alleys.
   It is concluded that on Ultisols with low nutrient status in the upper
   rooting zone, alley cropping with low-competitive tree species may
   improve food crop yields but the greatest monetary output is achieved by
   intercropping with mineral fertiliser independent of the presence or
   absence of an agroforestry component.},

Abstract = {The effects of stage of seed development, seed treatment and storage on
   the germination percentage of Leucaena seeds were studied with the main
   aims of economising and improving existing seed treatment methods.
   Freshly harvested mature green, light brown and dark brown seeds showed
   high germination percentages of 73, 98 and 97 respectively, while dry
   seeds showed low a germination percentage of less than 20. Mechanical
   scarification improved the germination of dry seeds to 98\%. The
   germination percentage of dry seeds was improved by hot water and
   sulphuric acid treatments and by mechanical scarification. Hot water
   (initial temperature of 100.degree.C) treatment at a ratio of one seed
   to two of water, increased the germination percentage. Sulphuric acid
   treatment was effective only with concentrated (98\%) acid.
   Effectiveness of acid treatment depended on seed: acid (w/v) ratio and
   treatment time. The highest germination percentage (95\%) was obtained
   with excess sulphuric acid treatment for 30 minutes. A one to one seed:
   acid ratio and 10 minutes treatment gave the same result as a 10 to one
   seed: acid ratio with 60 minutes treatment. These treatments increased
   germination to over 80\%. A higher seed to acid ratio would economise
   the use of acid. Seed storage in a refrigerator (2.degree.C) or in a

Abstract = {Further studies of mimosine toxicity in broiler chicks were done to
   clarify a possibility of osteopathy.
   The mineral content and density of femur and the strength, ductility,
   and toughness for the index of mechanical properties significantly
   decreased in the 1\% mimosine group, compared with those in the control
   and restricted groups. The stiffness had a decreasing tendency in the
   1\% mimosine group. Consequently, it was concluded that chicks fed ad
   libitum a 1\% mimosine diet for 12 days developed osteopathy.
   The bone mineral density and the strength of the restricted group were
   lower than those of the control group, and those of the 1\% mimosine
   group were till lower than those of the restricted group. Contents of
   pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline in the excrement were significantly
   higher in the restricted group than those in the control group, but the
   contents in the 1\% mimosine group were significantly lowest among the
   groups. Osteopathy in chicks fed mimosine, therefore, seemed to be done
   by loss of appetite and changing to a low turnover of bone caused by
   mimosine.},

   Under non-coppiced neem trees in the parkland, the sorghum yield at 0-3
   m distance from the tree (under the tree canopy) was 82\% of open field
   yields at 6-9 m distance, but the difference was not significant (p =
   0.07). Close to trees (0-3 m distance) which had been coppiced before
   planting, the sorghum yield was 148\% of open field yields. In alley
   farming, early coppicing was superior; sorghum yields were highest close
   to trees coppiced early and lowest close to trees coppiced late.},

Abstract = {Leucaena species are leguminous plants native to Mexico. Using two L.
   leucocephala cultivars grown in different soils, we obtained 150
   isolates from the nodules. Twelve rDNA types were identified which
   clustered into groups corresponding to Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, and
   Sinorhizobium by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of
   amplified 16S rRNA genes. Types 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12 were distinct
   from all the defined species. Others had patterns indistinguishable from
   some recognized species. Most of the isolates corresponded to
   Sinorhizobium 12. Forty-one electrophoretic types (ETs) were identified
   among the isolates based on the different combinations of
   electrophoretic patterns of 13 metabolic enzymes. ETs were clustered
   into groups in general agreement with the rDNA types. Diverse plasmid
   patterns were obtained among the isolates, but common plasmids were
   observed among most isolates within rDNA types 5, 10, and 11. The
   symbiotic plasmids were identified among most of the isolates, except
   for the Mesorhizobium isolates. The affinities of host cultivars for
   different rhizobial groups and the impact of sail cultivation an the
   soil populations of rhizobia were analysed from the estimation of
   isolation frequencies and diversity. The results showed differences in
   rhizobial populations in cultivated and uncultivated soils and also
   differences in rhizobia trapped by L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham or

Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of Leucaena
   leucocephala (leucaena) and Gliricidia sepium (gliricidia)
   supplementation on intake, digestion, outflow rates, microbial protein
   yield and live-weight changes in sheep fed with ammoniated rice straw
   (ARS). In experiment 1, three rumen cannulated Japanese Corriedale
   wether (mean body weight of 35.6 kg) in 3x3 Latin Square Design were
   used. Animals were fed ad libitum ARS alone, or supplemented with 200 g
   of either leucaena or gliricidia. In experiment 2, twenty-four growing
   native Philippine sheep with average body weight of 13.5+/-0.25 kg were
   used in a completely randomized design (CRD) and offered similar diets
   to those of experiment 1. Supplementation increased total dry matter
   intake and nutrient digestibility except for fiber (p<0.05) without
   affecting ARS consumption. Nitrogen balance revealed that absorbed and
   retained N was significantly higher in leucaena and gliricidia. The
   significant improvement in N utilization and more digestible OM intake
   brought about by the inclusion of leucaena and gliricidia to ARS
   resulted in increased (p<0.05) microbial N yield. Efficiency of
   microbial N supply in supplemented group was not significantly
   different, but higher (p<0.05) than the 24.92 g N/kg DOMR for ARS group.
   Liquid outflow rate was 7.8 and 6.8 \%/h, while the solid phase of rumen
   digesta was 4.4 and 3.8 \%/h for the leucaena and gliricidia group
   respectively, which were significantly higher than 5.30 and 2.50 \%/h in
   the control diet. The increase in total DMI resulted to higher (p<0.01)
   growth performance and efficient feed utilization. Average daily gain
   (ADG) was 19.3, 34.6 and 33.9 g/d for the ARS, leucaena and gliricidia
   respectively. It is therefore concluded that addition of leucaena and
   gliricidia to ARS in could increase nutrient intake and digestibility,
   subsequently improving N utilization and livestock performance.},

Abstract = {A fast-growing mimosoid tree, Leucaena leucocepphala has been promoted
   as an energy crops in Thailand. Its woody biomass contained 2wt\% ash
   and had a lower heating value (LHV) of 17 MJ/kg. It was fast pyrolysed
   in a bench-scale circulating fluidised bed (CFB) reactor at 450-550
   degrees C. The effect of reaction temperature on product yields and
   properties was investigated. The pyrolysis products are bio-oil, char
   and gas. The bio-oil yields were monitored by two means (1) heavy and
   light fractions and (2) organic and reactor water. The bio-oil
   properties tested included water content, pH, viscosity and higher
   heating value. The results show that almost 69 wt\% of total bio-oil was
   produced at a controlled pyrolysis temperature of 500 degrees C. This
   bio-oil yield can be separated into 55 wt\% heavy and 14 wt\% light
   fractions or 46 wt\% organics and 23 wt\% reaction water. According to
   the bio-oil analysis, it was found that the heavy bio-oils contained low
   water content (12-20 wt\%), whereas the light ones contained
   significantly higher water content (76-89 wt\%). The pH values of heavy
   and light bio-oils were slightly different in the range of 2.6-3.3. The
   heavy bio-oil had a viscosity measured at 40 degrees C of 27-56 cSt and
   the higher heating value (HHV) of 20-23 MJ/kg (wet basis), 24-26 MJ/kg
   (dry basis). Statistical analysis shows that the pyrolysis temperature
   led to the reduction of char yield, the increase of gas yield as well as
   the increase of the HHV and viscosity of the heavy bio-oil.},

   modified soils in Guam's limestone forests, reducing storage pools of
   carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Background and Objectives: Invasive
   plants may engineer negative changes in ecosystem properties. This study
   was conducted to determine changes in soil chemistry following
   infestations of three problematic tree species on Guam. Materials and
   Methods: Minerals, metals, and mineralization dynamics were measured in
   invaded sites and paired sites with biodiverse native tree cover.
   Results: Most soil properties were significantly changed by long-term
   infestations of the invasive tree species. The soils within invaded
   sites exhibited total carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus
   that were less than native sites. In contrast, the carbon/nitrogen ratio
   increased for every species-site combination. The other chemical
   properties were idiosyncratic among the sites and species. Conclusions:
   Mitigation and restoration activities that include the removal of these
   trees from project sites may require many years for the below-ground
   ecosystems to return to their native state. These three invasive trees
   decrease the ability of Guam soils to sequester recalcitrant forms of
   carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus.},

Abstract = {Time of pruning application and mixing prunings of varying qualities
   could be important management options to increase the rate of nitrogen
   recovery from multipurpose-tree prunings that are used as a source of
   nitrogen to crops. A field experiment was conducted in the semiarid zone
   of Zimbabwe to test this hypothesis, using prunings of calliandra
   (Calliandra calothyrsus) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), alone and
   in mixtures, and maize (Zea mays) as the test crop. Time of pruning
   application significantly improved N uptake, N recovery, and grain yield
   of maize. Applying prunings of calliandra at maize planting was
   significantly better in terms of N uptake, N recovery, and grain yield
   than applying them four weeks after planting. However, with leucaena,
   time of prunings application had no significant effects on;N recovery.

   tools for arsenic speciation. As (III) is electrochemically stable in
   the presence of ascorbic acid as supporting electrolyte, while As (V) is
   electrochemically inactive at the electrode surface. The present piece
   of work is an attempt to measure the two arsenic species in the elution
   of arsenic sorbed Leucaena leucocephala seed powder (LLSP), using square
   wave anodic stripping voltammetry. The strategy employed in this work is
   based on the determination of As (III) directly, while determining As
   (V) after reduction with sodium thiosulfate into As (III). The removal
   percentage of As (III) and As (V) using LLSP biomaterial was 83.18 and

Abstract = {Slope exposure is one of the environmental factors that influences
   vegetation characteristics. Although there are studies on this aspect in
   various types of vegetation, up to now submontane shrublands have not
   been extensively studied. In this work, the effect of slope exposure on
   the structure and composition of plant species in a state park in
   northeastern Mexico where the dominant vegetation is submontane scrub
   was evaluated. Ten 10 x 10 m exposure sites were sampled: northeast,
   southwest and northwest. Total height (h), basal diameter (d0.10) and
   crown diameter (k) were measured for each individual. Our hypotheses
   were: 1) the northwestern exposure community will have greater basal
   area, canopy cover, volume, absolute abundance, and specific richness
   due to higher humidity, 2) each slope will present dissimilarity in
   species composition. As results, nine families, 17 genera and 17 species
   of vascular plants were recorded. Fabaceae was the best represented
   family with six species. The species with the highest importance value
   index were the endemic shrub Neopringlea integrifolia in the northeast
   exposure (21.52 \%) and the exotic tree Leucaena leucocephala in the
   southwest (16.17 \%) and northwest (27.16 \%) exposures. It is concluded
   that the plant community of the northwest exposure has a greater basal
   area, crown cover, volume, absolute abundance and specific richness.
   However, there was no real difference in the species composition of the
   three exposures.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The availability of clean water is one of the biggest global problems,
   especially in developing countries. The simplest way to treat turbid
   water is by using coagulation. However, the utilization of chemical
   coagulants such as alum and ferrum has several drawbacks, including a
   high sludge volume and negative health impact when the water is
   consumed. Natural coagulants offer a better option, especially because
   of their availability, low price, lower sludge volume, and effectiveness
   comparable with chemical coagulants. In this study we utilize Moringa
   oleifera, Carica papaya and Leucaena leucocephala seeds, which are
   indigenous plants in Indonesia, as natural coagulants. An FTIR study was
   conducted to qualitatively identify the possible active coagulant agent
   in the seeds. The coagulant performance in removing turbidity of
   synthetic kaolin water was studied using jar test apparatus at various
   levels of coagulant dosage and pH. Functional groups of -OH, N-H, C=O,
   and primary, secondary and tertiary amides were identified in all the
   seeds. Neither the dosage nor the pH had an effect on turbidity removal
   when M. oleifera was used as the natural coagulant, but did have some
   effect on papaya and leucaena. The turbidity removal obtained in this
   study was comparable with other reported results, therefore it can be
   concluded that these seeds have the potential to be used as natural
   coagulants.},

   . Nodule number and nitrogen content was measured in seedlings of
   herbaceous and woody legume species after inoculation with rhizobial
   strains isolated from tropical soils, to establish symbiotic
   effectiveness groups for rhizobial strains and their hosts.
   . Specificity for nodulation and N(2) fixation varied greatly among the
   legumes. Symbionts of all four legumes exhibited a wide range of
   promiscuity and symbiotic effectiveness with isolates of S. sesban
   having the narrowest host range. N(2) fixation varied greatly; although
   some strains fixed large amounts of N(2) with more than one host, none
   was effective with all hosts. Rhizobial isolates of C, calothyrsus, G,
   sepium and L, leucocephala were able to effectively cross-nodulate each
   others' hosts as well as a number of other species.
   . The complex nature of cross-nodulation relationships between diverse
   rhizobial strains and legume hosts is highlighted. Host plants
   inoculated with effective rhizobial strains showed better nitrogen use
   efficiency than plants supplied solely with mineral nitrogen.},

Abstract = {Thirty-six indigenous goats were used to determine the potential of
   sun-dried leaves of the shrub legumes Acacia angustissima, Calliandra
   calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala as supplements to native pasture
   hay (NPH). The dried leaves were included at the rates of 80, 160 and
   320 g/head/ day. Cottonseed meal fed at the same levels, and NPH fed
   alone were included as controls. Among the browses, C. calothyrsus had
   the lowest N content of 19.0 g/kg dry matter (DM) and A. angustissima
   the highest of 35.0 g/kg DM. The leaves from the legumes had
   significantly less N and higher cell wall, neutral detergent insoluble N
   (NDIN) and acid detergent insoluble N (ADIN) contents than cottonseed
   meal. The values of NDIN as a fraction of total N were 19, 456, 526 and
   816 g/kg for cottonseed meal, L. leucocephala, A. angustissima and C.
   calothyrsus, respectively.
   Proanthocyanidin contents were 33, 196 and 134 g/kg DM for A.
   angustissima, C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala, respectively. Type of
   supplement did not affect (P > 0.05) NPH, total and digestible DM
   intakes although NPH intake was depressed (P < 0.05) at the highest
   level of supplementation compared to the first two levels. Animals fed
   legumes excreted significantly more (P < 0.001) faecal N (g/kg N intake)
   than animals consuming cottonseed meal. The reverse was observed for
   urine N. Among the legumes, C. calothyrsus had significantly higher (P <
   0.001) N in faeces (958 g/kg N intake) than A. angustissima (630) and L.
   leucocephala (615). Significant (P < 0.05) correlation coefficients were
   obtained between proanthocyanidins (PAs) intake and faecal N, NDIN and
   ADIN (0.535, 0.501 and 0.786, respectively). Regressing digestible N on
   N intake indicated that A. augustissima and C. calothyrsus tannins had
   significant effects on the digestion of dietary N. The animal responses
   were discussed in relation to PAs content. It was concluded that both
   the type and level of PAs were important determinants of the animal
   responses. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {A Study on the incidence and damage of insects during the establishment
   of two Leucaena leucocephala plantations intercropped with maize and
   vigna, respectively was carried out at the Institute of Animal Science.
   Visual samplings in prefixed furrows were carried out by random
   observation of 60 plants of each crop for each area with a fortnightly
   frequency. In the case of the vignas, 30 days after sowing, 9 samples of
   20 catches were taken using an entomological net. There was a greater
   insect-pest incidence in the leucaena intercropped with vigna with
   severe damage to this seasonal species. However, leucaena was not
   largely affected in this study. The bioregulators showed a similar
   performance in both areas. Heteropsylla cubans was the predominating
   insect in leucaena with populations of 5 individuals/m(2). In maize it
   was Spodoptera frugiperda with 1.2 larvae/m(2) and in vignas,
   homopterous of the Empoasca genus with 23 insects/m(2) and diverse
   Chrisomelidae that caused defoliation to the crop. It is concluded that
   leucaena during its establishment does not suffer physiological or plant
   health disorders when seasonal crops such as maize or vignas are
   intercropped. Maize intercropping is premisory. However, it does not
   seem advisable to intercrop vignas in view of phytophagous damage, which
   must be periodically studied.},

Abstract = {Twenty-four multiparous female South African indigenous goats were used.
   Once a week during the 2nd (weeks 8, 11 and 14) and 3rd (weeks 18, 19
   and 20) trimesters, between 0800 and 1500 h, four females per treatment
   were randomly selected and observed every 1 min for time spent grazing,
   browsing, ruminating and idling. Blood samples were taken once a week
   during the 2nd (weeks 8, 11 and 14) and 3rd (weeks 18, 19, 20 and 21)
   trimesters for measurements of some mineral elements and protein
   metabolites. Goats on natural pasture (NP) grazed 54.8 min (P < 0.001)
   more and browsed 53 min (P < 0.001) less than goats on Leucaena
   leucocephala-grass pasture (LGP) during the 2nd trimester. During the
   3rd trimester, goats on NP treatments grazed and idled more (24.7 min, P
   = 0004; 15.8 min, P = 0044, respectively) but ruminated less (-24.1 min,
   P < 0.001) than LGP goats. Time allotted to each field activity by the
   goats on both treatments within trimester seemed to be dependent on
   forage species composition while activity between trimesters was
   possibly influenced by seasons, plant type, herbage quantity,
   environment and quality, and changes in stage of gestation of the goats.
   Blood Mg level on NP was higher (P = 0051) than on LGP during the 2nd
   trimester while blood Cu and albumin contents on LGP were significantly
   higher (P = 0029 and 0022, respectively) than on NP during the 3rd
   trimester. Furthermore, blood concentrations of the haematological
   parameters (except serum protein) on both treatments were within the
   normal range for goats in the tropics and subtropics and perhaps explain
   the absence of mineral and nutrient deficiency symptoms. The absence of
   visible symptoms of mineral deficiency and mimosine toxicity in LGP
   goats can be attributed to the transfer of DHP-degrading rumen bacteria.
   The bacteria effectively detoxified mimosine and its metabolites,
   thereby overcoming chelating tendency of mimosine and its metabolites.
   Mimosine-susceptible pregnant SAIG can be safely grazed on LGP once
   their rumen is completely colonized by the DHP-degrading rumen bacteria
   (Synergistes jonesii).},

Abstract = {The effect of feeding graded levels of detoxified Leucaena leucocephala
   meal (LLM) basal diet on carcass and meat quality attributes of broiler
   chickens was investigated. Seven isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets
   were formulated both for starter and finisher phases, designated TI, T2,
   T3, T4, T5, T6 and T7. The control diet no Leucaena meal (T1) was
   maize-soybean based diet, while 5\% soaked Leucaena meal (T2), 10\%
   soaked Leucaena meal (T3), 5\% boiled Leucaena meal (T4), 10\% bolied
   Leucaena meal (T5), 5\% raw Leucaena meal (T6) and 10\% raw Leucaena
   meal (T7) were incorporated into the diets and were supplemented with
   0.3\% methionine. 140 day old broiler chicks (Marshall Strain) purchased
   from Obasanjo Farm (Ota in Nigeria) were used for this study. Completely
   randomized design (CRD) with statistical model Yij=mu+Ti + random error
   was employed. At the end of 8 weeks of feeding trial, 56 birds (8 birds
   from each group) were randomly selected, slaughtered and processed.
   Carcass cut - up parts were weighed and their percentages calculated,
   meat quality was measured through physical variables and sensory
   evaluation using a taste panel and the scores were analysed with a
   9-point hedonic scale where 1 = dislike extremely and 9 = like
   extremely. The results showed that T5 had higher life (1787 +/- 0.59g),
   eviscerated (943.67 +/- 1.00g), thigh (71.98 +/- 1.00g) and back (189.92
   +/- 1.00g) weights as well as carcass (63.43 +/- 0.10), thigh (7.55 +/-
   0.10), back (19.92 +/- 0.58) and wing (6.65 +/- 0.08) dressing
   percentages. Meat cooking loss (46.54 +/- 1.00) and thermal shortening
   (63.59 +/- 1.00) were higher in meat from T6, but meat from T4 had
   higher cooking yield (68.08 +/- 1.00) and water holding capacity (51.33
   +/- 1.00). Meat samples from T1 (5.23 +/- 1.00), T3 (5.25 +/- 1.00), T6
   (5.29 +/- 0.52) and T7 (5.36 +/- 1.00) Shear force values while meat
   samples from T4 had higher colour (5.90 +/- 0.06), flavour (5.73 +/-
   0.10) and overall acceptability(5.77 +/- 1.00) scores, however, T4 and
   T5 elicited higher tenderness (5.40 +/- 1.00), (5.20 +/- 1.00) juiciness
   (5.60 +/- 0.11), and texture (5.50 +/- 0.11), (5.43 +/- 0.11) scores.
   Feeding broiler chicken with boiled L. leucocephala in meal was
   recommended since it furnished high carcass and meat attribute of
   broiler chicken in this study.},

   de Wit leaves on feed intake, live weight gain, nutrient digestibility,
   and nitrogen balance of highland sheep in Tigray Region in northern
   Ethiopia. Twenty intact yearling male highland sheep weighing16.9 +/-
   1.62 kg were used in a randomized complete block design and included the
   following four treatments: T1 (control, wheat straw ad libitum + 200 g
   noug seed cake (NSC) + 150 g wheat bran (WB)); T2 (wheat straw ad
   libitum + 170 g NSC + 44.3 g dried L. leucocephala (DLL) + 150 g WB); T3
   (wheat straw ad libitum + 140 g NSC + 87.3 g DLL + 150 g WB); and T4
   (wheat straw ad libitum + 110 g NSC + 130.2 g DLL + 150 g WB). Sheep fed
   on T4 diet consumed higher total dry matter (658 g/head/day) and
   recorded the highest average daily weight gain (59 g/head/day). Sheep
   fed on T4 diet had higher dry matter (61 \%), organic matter (63 \%),
   and crude protein (75 \%) digestibility values than the other
   treatments. Sheep fed on T3 diet demonstrated higher feed conversion
   ratio (11.93) than sheep kept on the other treatments. All sheep
   exhibited positive nitrogen balance, with the highest nitrogen retention
   being measured in T4 (12 g/head/day). It is concluded that partially
   replacing NSC by DLL can improve total dry matter intake, digestibility
   of nutrients, and body weight gain in highland sheep fed on wheat straw

   was conducted in the green area of Suranaree University of Technology (

   Leucaena abundance and native plant species (tree and climber)
   diversity. Species data of the entire line transects were ranked
   according to Importance Value Index ( IVI) to describe overall species
   distribution within fragments for trees, saplings, and seedlings
   separately. Random 80 m segments of nine line transects were selected
   within 9 selected forest fragments to record species diversity and
   abundance in a standardized manner. Generalized linear mixed model
   (GLMM) comparisons among the Shannon diversity index and species
   richness (as native species diversity variables) were modeled dependent
   upon Leucaena stem density and propagule pressure (as Leucaena abundance
   variables). The cluster diagram of similarity between species abundance
   and comparison of Sorenson similarity index (beta diversity among
   fragments) did not reveal a significant relationship between native
   species diversity and Leucaena abundance based on fragments. Rank
   abundance curves showed establishment of secondary native species under
   the Leucaena dominant canopy. As the result of IVI ranking, same six
   native species were at the top in tree, sapling, and seedling stages.
   Thus, at SUT Leucaena may be acting as nurse crop ( or even a pioneer
   species) in severely disturbed mixed deciduous forest fragments.},

   Eucalyptus robusta, and Leucaena leucocephala in Puerto
   Rico},

Abstract = {Tree growth, biomass productivity, litterfall mass and nutrient content,
   changes in soil chemical properties and understory forest succession
   were evaluated over a 8.5-year period in single- and mixed-species (50 :
   50) plantations of two N-2-fixing species, Casuarina equisetifolia and
   Leucaena leucocephala, and a non-fixing species, Eucalyptus robusta. At
   the optimal harvest age for maximum biomass production (4 years), total
   aboveground biomass ranged from 63 Mg ha(-1) in the Eucalyptus
   monoculture to 124 Mg ha(-1) in the Casuarina/Leucaena mixture, and was
   generally greater in the mixed-species than in single-species treatments
   due to increased productivity of the N-fixing species in the mixed
   stands. Total litterfall varied from 5.3 to 10.0 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)
   among treatments, or between 5.9\% and 13.2\% of net primary production.
   Litterfall production and rates of nutrient return for N, P, K, Ca and
   Mg were generally highest for Leucaena, intermediate for Casuarina and
   lowest for Eucalyptus. These rates were usually higher in the
   mixed-species than in monospecific stands due to differences in biomass
   productivity, but varied considerably depending on their species
   composition. Total system carbon and nutrient pools (in biomass plus
   soils to 40-cm depth) for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn at four years were
   consistently greater in the plantation treatments than in the unplanted
   control plots. Relative to the single-species plantations, these system
   pools were generally larger in the mixed-species plantations for C
   (-10\% to +10\%), N (+17\% to +50\%), P (-1\% to +63\%), K (-19\% to
   +46\%), Ca (-10\% to +48\%), Mg (+5\% to +57\%) and Mn (+19\% to +86\%).
   Whole-tree harvests at four years would result in substantial system
   carbon and nutrient losses, although these estimated losses would not
   exceed the estimated gains realized during the four-year period of tree
   growth at this site. At 7.5 years, soil organic matter and effective
   cation exchange capacity were reduced in all plantation treatments
   relative to the control. Changes in soil nutrient content from 0 to 7.5
   years were highly variable and not significantly different among
   treatments, although stands containing Leucaena generally showed higher
   rates of nitrogen and phosphorus accretion in soils than those with
   Eucalyptus and/or Casuarina. Natural regeneration of secondary forest
   tree and shrub species increased over time in all plantation treatments.
   A total of 24 native or naturalized forest species were recorded in the
   plantations at 8.5 years. Woody species abundance at this age was
   significantly greater beneath Casuarina than either Eucalyptus or the
   Eucalyptus/Leucaena mixed stands. Species richness and diversity,
   however, were greatest beneath stands containing Eucalyptus and/or
   Leucaena than in stands with Casuarina. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {Planting trees to stabilize metalliferous mine tailings is a widely used
   form of land reclamation although substantial soil amendment is
   invariably required, both to improve the physico-chemical status of the
   tailings and to ameliorate toxicity prior to planting. Here, we report a
   glasshouse study of the combined effects of burrowing earthworms
   (Pheretima guillelmi) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomus spp.,
   AMF) on establishment of a naturally invasive, woody, nitrogen-fixing
   legume, Leucaena leucocephala, on topsoil-amended Pb/Zn mine tailings.
   AMF provided the most effective preliminary inoculant, improving N, P
   and K uptake, but earthworms had more influence improving N nutrition.
   In most cases, the combined effects of AMF and earthworms were additive
   and proved to be beneficial to plant growth, plant nutrition and for
   protection against uptake of toxic metals. AMF influenced metal uptake
   more than earthworms, but together they reduced mobility of Pb and Zn in
   soil by as much as 25\%. Some minor but significant negative
   interactions were also evident; for example, earthworms enhanced soil
   microbial activity but inhibited the beneficial effects of AMF on
   N-2-fixation. We argue that increased attention to ecological
   interactions in soil could reduce costs and improve the efficacy of
   restoring a vegetation cover to land impacted by contaminated spoils.

   Cunningham was studied at 3 levels of shading (100, 57 and 35\% relative
   photosynthetic quantum flux) in a glasshouse. An additional treatment
   investigated the response of unshaded plants to N fertilizer applied
   twice weekly. Shading reduced total plant weight (3.83, 3.20, 2.46 g),
   increased the shoot/root ratio, increased internode length and plant
   height. However, with increasing shade there was a linear increase in
   leaf area, and relative growth rate (RGR) of shoots was affected little.
   RGR of the roots declined sharply from 0.62 to 0.51 g g-1 wk-1 with
   shading. Only at the lowest illuminance was the dry matter percent of
   shoots decreased (32\% to 28\%). Leaves were larger and thinner in the
   shaded treatments but rate of leaf appearance was unaffected. Added N
   (.tbd. 225 kg N ha-1) increased uptake of N (by 68\%), N concentration
   (59\%) and leaf wt (24\%) but had no significant effect on plant height,
   number of leaves, RGR, or dry matter percent of shoots. The poor
   seedling performance of leucaena in competition with other species
   apparently is not due to a failure to tolerate shade. In this respect it
   is apparently better than some other tropical pasture legumes.},

Title = {When a seed-feeding beetle is a predator and also increases the speed of
   seed germination: an intriguing interaction with an invasive plant},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Bruchine beetles are usually considered seed predators, particularly
   because these beetles consume the seed embryo and kill the seeds.
   Previous studies suggest that under certain conditions, these insects do
   not kill the embryo. In this study, we asked whether the germination
   speed of seeds of the invasive tree Leucaena leucocephala is enhanced by
   the seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Coleoptera:
   Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae). We also tested whether differences in
   germination between attacked and intact seeds could be related to seed
   size. We finally examined whether the number of larvae per seed affected
   seed germination and whether seedling emergence patterns were similar to
   those exhibited by germination. We found that compared to intact seeds,
   proportionally faster germination occurred in seeds attacked by A.
   macrophthalmus in 14 of the 26 populations studied. In addition, those
   populations that presented greater germination speed in the attacked
   seeds during the evaluation time also had the largest seeds. Similar to
   the germination experiments, seedling emergence was faster in the
   attacked compared to the intact seeds. Our findings show that the
   germination speed of L. leucocephala seeds can be enhanced by A.
   macrophthalmus. However, this effect is much more intense when a single
   larva develops inside the seed. In evolutionary terms, it is possible
   that the selection for larger seeds is favoured, increasing the speed of
   seed germination and contributing to predator satiation at the seed
   level. However, this effect could be minimized by the production of many
   seeds by L. leucocephala plants, causing predator satiation by masting
   effects, which would favour the selection for higher seed numbers.},

Abstract = {The objective was to evaluate the effect of three energy concentrates on
   dietary nitrogen utilisation efficiency, milk production and milk
   composition. Twelve dual-purpose cows fed in a silvopastoral (SSP)
   system with Leucaena leucocephala and Digitaria swazilandensis were fed
   four treatments, supplemented with 25 MJ/cow/day of sorghum, molasses
   and gluconeogenic precursors, plus the control treatment, using a 4x4
   Latin square experimental design with three replicates and experimental
   periods of 14 days and a total duration of 56 days. No significant
   differences were found for milk yield, milk chemical composition and
   milk urea nitrogen (MUN). No significant differences were found for cow
   live weight and dry matter intake. Forage analysis showed significant
   difference for crude protein (CP) concentration. There was no
   significant difference for average values of dry matter (DM) yield,
   neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), lignin and in
   vitro DM matter. For Leucaena, a significant difference was found only
   in DM yield, with period 4 being the highest yielding period compared to
   periods 1, 2 and 3. There was no significant difference for CP, NDF,
   ADF, lignin and in vitro DM digestibility. This work allows to
   understand the interaction of CP metabolism with DM. It is concluded
   that SSP provides sufficient dietary energy to cows in production for
   dual-purpose cows ranching.},

Abstract = {Green leaf manuring with prunings of Leucaena leucocephala is regarded
   as a useful source of N to plants but the actual substitution of N
   fertilizer, release and recovery of N as well as effects on soil
   fertility are not adequately studied. The present studies investigated
   the effect of sole and combined use of Leucaena prunings and urea N
   fertilizer in different proportions on productivity, profitability, N
   uptake and balance in maize (Zea mays)-wheat (Triticum aestivum)
   cropping system at New Delhi during 2002-2003 and 2003-2004. Varying
   quantities of Leucaena green leaf biomass containing 3.83-4.25\% N
   (18.2-20.5 C:N ratio) were applied to provide 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100\% of
   recommended N (120 kg ha(-1)) to both maize and wheat before sowing. In
   general, direct application of urea N increased the productivity of both
   crops more than Leucaena green leaf manure, but the reverse was true for
   the residual effect of these sources. The productivity of maize
   increased progressively with increasing proportions of N through urea
   fertilizer and was 2.41-2.52 t ha(-1) with 60 kg N ha(-1) each applied
   through Leucaena and urea, which was at par with that obtained with 120
   kg N ha(-1) through urea alone (2.56-2.74 t ha(-1)). Similarly, wheat
   yield was also near maximum (4.46-5.11 t ha(-1)) when equal amounts of N
   were substituted through Leucaena and urea. Residual effects were
   obtained on the following crops and were significant when greater
   quantity of N (> 50\%) was substituted through Leucaena. Nitrogen uptake
   and recovery were also maximum with urea N alone, and N recovery was
   higher in maize (33.4-42.1\%) than in wheat (27.3-29.8\%). However,
   recovery of residual N in the following crop was more from Leucaena N
   alone (8.5-10.3\%) than from urea fertilizer (1.7-3.8\%). Residual soil
   fertility in terms of organic C and KMnO4 oxidizable N showed
   improvement with addition of Leucaena prunings, which led to a positive
   N balance at the end of second cropping cycle. Net returns were
   considerably higher with wheat than with maize, and were comparatively
   lower with greater proportion of Leucaena because of its higher cost.
   Nonetheless, it was beneficial to apply Leucaena and urea on equal N
   basis for higher productivity and sustainability of this cereal-based
   cropping system.},

   nitrogen supply and live-weight changes in cattle. In each experiment,
   20 intact and five fistulated crossbred steers (Bos taurusxBos indicus)

   of molasses (1.25, 2.50, 3.75, 5.00 kg molasses/head.day, as fed or

   (0.75, 1.50 kg/head.day, as fed or fresh weight basis). Seventy Bos
   indicus cross heifers {[}similar to 12 months of age, mean initial
   weight 252 +/- 3.8 (s.e.) kg] were allocated to the seven treatments and
   two replicates of each treatment (five cattle per replicate plus five
   additional similar heifers) with the stocking rate set at 6.25 head/ha.
   The experiment was conducted over 106 days of the dry season
   (August-November). Each replicate paddock of 0.4 ha was rotationally
   grazed with 10 animals with a 7-day grazing period and a 21-day regrowth
   period for each rotation. The mean herbage mass, residual herbage mass
   and herbage allowance for the experiment were 3.78 t DM/ha, 3.07 t DM/ha
   and 7.32 kg DM/100 kg liveweight, respectively. Pangola contributed a
   mean of 0.79 of the herbage mass. There was a significant quadratic
   response of liveweight gain to level of molasses supplement (P < 0.0087)
   with an optimum liveweight gain of 1.08 kg/head.day at a supplement
   level of 2.65 kg molasses/head.day or 8.9 g/kg LW.day derived from the

   significant response to level of maize supplement. There were no
   significant differences between treatments in the concentration of rumen
   ammonia N or volatile fatty acids or in the molar proportion of volatile
   fatty acids. It was concluded that molasses can be used effectively to
   increase the liveweight gain of cattle grazing leucaena/pangola pasture

Abstract = {Samples obtained from two planting experiments with tropical shrub
   legumes rich in condensed tannins (CT) (Calliandra calothyrsus,
   Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala) were analysed in detail
   for CT concentration, composition and properties, as well as for in
   vitro degradability. The factors evaluated included cultivation site
   (fertile mollisol with pH 7.8 and bimodal rainfall vs. infertile oxisol
   with pH 5.0, high Al saturation and unimodal rainfall) and different
   levels of mineral fertilisation. In vitro ruminal degradability, CT
   concentration and properties were affected by cultivation site or
   fertiliser application or both. In Calliandra and Flemingia, the CT
   concentration showed a trend (P<0.1) to be higher at the site with the
   infertile soil. This was consistent with the increased (P<0.001)
   astringency of CT extracts found in Calliandra when plants were
   cultivated at this site. In Flemingia, however, astringency was reduced
   (P<0.001) on the infertile soil. There were certain effects of the
   cultivation site on the anthocyanidin profile of CT from Calliandra and
   Flemingia, but these were relatively small and could not explain the
   differences in astringency observed between sites. Fertilisation did not
   affect (P>0.05) total CT concentration in Calliandra and Flemingia but
   clearly increased (P<0.01) astringency of the CT extracts. This suggests
   that not only CT concentration but also properties of CT may be affected
   by cultivation site and fertilisation. Leucaena did not grow on the
   infertile soil and site effects could therefore not be evaluated in this
   species. Fertilisation did not affect (P>0.05) CT concentration and
   astringency of CT extracts of Leucaena but reduced (P<0.05) the cyanidin
   proportion in CT. Cultivation site affected several variables describing
   fermentation dynamics. Foliage of the legumes grown on the infertile
   soil exhibited lower (P<0.05) gas production rates. Dry (C) 2010

Abstract = {Water is considered an important factor in the arid and semi-arid areas
   because water shortage affects the agricultural production. The current
   study aimed to investigate the influence of water application level on
   the dry matter yield, water use efficiency (WUE), and plant water status
   in Leucaena leucocephala. The treatments consisted of five levels of
   water applications based on actual evapotranspiration (AET): 0.25, 0.50,
   0.75, 1.00 and 1.25 AET respectively. The production was increased from
   306.4, 676.3, 724.1, 838.5, to 1172.7 kg/ha as the water application
   levels increased. The estimated WUE was 2.32, 2.57, 1.83, 1.59 and 1.78
   kg/ha/mm for 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25 AET, respectively.
   Increasing the water application level did not increase the WUE. Using
   the irrigation level at 0.50 AET can be used to irrigate Leucaena crop
   without leaving any significant change in dry matter yield compared with
   0.75 and 1.00 AET, respectively. There was no significant effect of
   water application level on each of the leaf water potential (psi(W)) and
   leaf relative water content (LRWC). The means of psi(W) was -2.3, -2.1,
   -2.2, -2.3, -2.2 MPa at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25 AET,
   respectively. The means of leaf relative water content were 75, 74, 77,
   77 and 78\% at the water treatment levels, respectively. Under different
   water application levels, a poor correlation between the psi(W) and LRWC
   existed. It is recommended to use 50\% of AET as the best irrigation
   water management treatment for Leucaena production.},

Title = {Does the size of the seeds and seed pods of the invasive tree
   Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) affect their utilization by the
   biological control agent Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus
   (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae)?},

Abstract = {The Neotropical tree Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae),
   which was introduced worldwide for agroforestry, has become invasive in
   several countries. In an attempt to reduce its invasiveness in South
   Africa, the seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus
   (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was released in 1999 as a
   biological control agent. The beetle oviposits on seed pods and on loose
   seeds of its host. Hatching larvae burrow into the seeds to consume the
   contents, emerging as adults. Since L. leucocephala seeds and seed pods
   display considerable variation in size (i.e. resource quality) in the
   field, a laboratory study was conducted to determine whether size
   affects utilization by A. macrophthalmus. A seed-switching trial was
   also carried out to determine whether seed pod or seed size was the most
   consistent oviposition cue. The beetles displayed strong oviposition
   preferences for larger resources, with significantly higher egg loads on
   the largest seeds and seed pods. The seed-switching trials suggested
   that seed pod size was a more important oviposition cue than seed size.
   These results were verified by field surveys which revealed significant
   positive relationships between egg loads and seed pod size at two of the
   three sites surveyed. Since seed size is positively correlated with
   germination success and seedling fitness in leguminous plants, these
   oviposition patterns suggest that, in situations where dehisced seeds
   are utilized, A. macrophthalmus may be targeting the fittest seeds in L.
   leucocephala populations. This may have positive, albeit subtle,
   implications for biological control.},

Abstract = {Environmental pollution by textile dye-based wastewater raises a vital
   call for consideration to industrialists and scientists due to its
   influence on the ecosystem. In this study, zinc oxide (ZnO), copper
   oxide (CuO), Manganese dioxide (MnO2), and Magnesium Oxide (MgO)
   nanoparticles were successfully synthesized from Leucaena leucocephala
   leaves for the removal of Reactive Golden Yellow-145 (RY-145) and Direct
   Red-31 (DR-31) dyes. The nanoparticles were characterized by scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
   (FTIR). Optimization of various operating parameters like initial dye
   concentration, pH, temperature, contact time, and dose of nanoparticles
   was investigated. The results showed that Leucaena leucocephala
   leaf-mediated ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and MgO nanoparticles presented the
   highest adsorption capacities for RY-145 of 47.50 (mg/g), 65.53(mg/g),
   53.62 (mg/g), and 58.72 (mg/g) respectively, with optimized parameter
   values of pH solution, contact time, adsorbent dose, initial dye
   concentration, and temperature were 3, 75 min, 0.05 g/50 mL, 100 mg/L
   and 25 degrees C on 124 rpm, correspondingly. DR-31 presented the
   highest adsorption capacities of 57.08 (mg/g), 83.47(mg/g), 67.36
   (mg/g), and 72.53 (mg/g) respectively at optimized parameter values of
   pH solution, contact time, adsorbent dose, initial dye concentration and
   temperature were 2 and 3, 60min, 0.05 g/ 50 mL, 100 mg/L and 25 degrees
   C on 124 rpm. The surfactants and electrolytes effects were also
   scrutinized on dyes' adsorption. The surfactants and electrolytes'
   existence in the aqueous media reduced the adsorption of dye because of
   the competition for limited binding sites. The RY-145 and DR-31
   adsorbents adsorption efficiencies were found in following order; MgO
   (65.52\% and 83.47\%) > MnO2 (58.72\% and 72.53\%) > CuO (53.62\% and
   67.36\%) > ZnO (47.50\% and 57.08\%). The adsorption-based dye data were
   scrutinized using various isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics
   models. The studies presented that the adsorption processes were well
   fitted to pseudo-second-order kinetics since correlation coefficient
   (R2) values ranged from 0.994 to 0.999 and Intraparticle diffusion
   models correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.88 to 0.97, their
   values were relatively near the experimental values signify the
   adsorption kinetics in both dyes. Both dyes adsorption on green
   nanoadsorbents followed a Langmuir isotherm due to decent correlation
   coefficient values of 0.999 with value of 59.17 (mg/g), 66.22 (mg/g),
   72.99 (mg/g), and 81.30 (mg/g) respectively for DR-31 and 47.62 (mg/g),
   53.763 (mg/g), 58.48 (mg/g), and 64.93 (mg/g) for RY-145 with monolayer
   coverage. RY-145 also followed Temkin and Doubinin Radushkevich's
   isotherm. The thermodynamics investigations revealed spontaneous dyes
   adsorption onto MgO and MnO2, ZnO is non-spontaneous in both dyes while
   CuO is spontaneous in DR-31 and nonspontaneous in RY-145. The maximum
   desorption of 78-86\% was attained using the 0.2 N and 0.4 N NaOH for
   adsorbed RY-145 and DR-31 dye respectively. The desorption data was
   favorable as the Leucaena leucocephala leaf-mediated ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and
   MgO nanoparticles adsorbents were utilized several cycles and have
   stability This experimental study also determines the potential efficacy
   of green nano-adsorbents for the removal of dye from the real textile
   effluent. In addition, a phytotoxicity investigation of used green
   nano-adsorbents is carried out on the pea seeds, to demonstrate their
   sustainability from a real environmental point of view.
   Thus, Because of their promising efficiency, green ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and
   MgO nanoparticles have the potential to apply for dye adsorption from
   textile wastewater.},

Abstract = {Tethering goats on marginal lands is a common practice in many countries
   but may result in BW loss during the dry season. To test an alternative
   system, groups of six young male Landim X French Alpine goats (12 kg BW
   average) were tethered daily for 6 h on native pasture or free-ranged
   for 24 h on a cultivated pasture which incorporated herbaceous grasses
   and legumes as well as Leucaena leucocephala rows. The trial started
   late in the wet season and ended early in the wet season of the
   following year, and was repeated during a second year with the addition
   of a tethered treatment receiving supplementation of L. leucocephala
   leaves at 2\% BW (dry matter basis). Average daily gains were higher (P
   < 0.05) on cultivated pasture, (70 g day(-1) and 51 g day(-1) in Years 1
   and 2) compared with tethered animals (31 g day(-1) and 24 g day(-1) in
   Years 1 and 2). Gains in the second year for tethered/supplemented
   animals were intermediate (38 g day(-1); P < 0.05). Carcass, as percent
   BW at slaughter, was highest (P < 0.05) for cultivated pastures, 47.4\%,
   versus 40.2\% for tethered animals and 40.7\% for tethered/supplemented
   animals the second year. It was concluded that free-ranging, 24 h
   grazing on a cultivated pasture can be a sustainable, low-input
   alternative which can avoid animal BW loss during the dry season.},

Abstract = {Silages were prepared from the tropical grasses, pangola grass
   (Digitaria decumbens) and setaria (Setaria sphacelata), with the
   addition of molasses (4\% w/w) and/or leaves (33\%) from the leguminous
   trees leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and gliricidia (Gliricidia
   sepium). All forages were grown at the University of Queensland farm in
   south eastern Queensland during 1985. These silages, together with hays
   made from these grasses and sorghum silage (13 diets) were fed to sheep
   to assess their nutritive value. All silages were well preserved, as
   indicated by low pH (3.5-4.4), low ammonia N (26-57 g/kg total N) and
   high lactic acid (73-95\% total acids) contents. The addition of legumes
   increased both the dry matter (DM) and total N (TN) contents of silages
   to the same extent as the addition of both legumes and molasses at
   ensiling. Sheep given silages prepared from pangola grass and legumes
   (+/- molasses) consumed similar DM intakes (22.9-25.4 g/kg0.75 per day)
   as sheep given pangola grass hay (23.9 g/kg0.75 per day). Silage made
   from pangola grass + molasses was of low palatability (16.1 g/kg0.75 per
   day). The digestibilities of silage DM (DMD) and its fibrous components
   were significantly (P < 0.05) lower (DMD 53.3-60.6\%) than that of
   pangola hay (DMD 64.7\%). Silages and hay made from setaria, and sorghum
   silage, were of lower nutritive value than those from pangola grass. The
   addition of leucaena and molasses increased silage DM intakes (21.1
   g/kg0.75 per day) above those for setaria hay and setaria + molasses
   silage (16.7 and 19.0 g/kg0.75 per day respectively). The intakes of
   silages made from gliricidia (17.1 g/kg0.75 per day) were significantly
   (P < 0.05) improved when molasses was included at ensiling (21.8
   g/kg0.75 per day). The digestibilities of silage DM were significantly
   (P < 0.05) higher (DMD 53.6-60.4\%) than that of setaria hay (DMD 40.6).
   Liveweight change in sheep was significantly (P < 0-05) correlated with
   intakes of digestible DM (r2 = 0.74) and with N intake (r2 = 0.82). The
   inclusion of legumes in the silages increased N retention and, for
   setaria silages, also increased rumen ammonia concentration. It was
   concluded that tropical grasses can be effectively ensiled by the
   addition of legumes alone and, with the exception of setaria/gliricidia
   silages, the resultant silages were of sufficiently high quality to
   merit their use in tropical animal production systems.},

Abstract = {An investigation was undertaken to test the hypothesis that amending
   peat to increase its P buffer capacity and optimizing the P
   concentration of the amended medium for mycorrhizal activity will
   enhance its usefulness for raising mycorrhizal seedlings of tree
   species. The approaches entailed mixing a small quantity of soil of high
   P adsorbing capacity with peat and constructing a P sorption isotherm
   for the medium in order to establish solution P concentration
   near-optimal to optimal for mycorrhization of seedlings. A P sorption
   isotherm based on incubating the medium with graded amounts of P at 50\%
   of available water-holding capacity was developed. Target solution P
   concentrations established using the approach enabled us to identify the
   optimal solution P concentration for mycorrhizal development on roots of
   our indicator plant Leucaena leucocephala grown in the medium.
   Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization, host growth, and P status of L.
   leucocephala pinnules measured at target solution P concentrations
   ranging from 0.12 to 1.0 mg L-1 revealed that AM fungal activity and
   symbiotic effectiveness was maximum at solution P concentration of 0.2
   mg P L-1. Medium solution P concentrations in excess of 0.2 mg L-1
   tended to depress AM fungal colonization, but colonization level did not
   decline below 43\%.},

Abstract = {Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 catabolizes mimosine, which is a toxic
   non-protein amino acid present in Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena). The
   objective of this investigation was to study the biochemical and
   catalytic properties of the enzyme encoded by midD, one of the TAL1145
   genes involved in mimosine degradation. The midD-encoded enzyme, MidD,
   was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and used for biochemical and
   catalytic studies using mimosine as the substrate. The reaction products
   in the enzyme assay were analyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. MidD
   has a molecular mass of similar to 45 kDa and its catalytic activity was
   found to be optimal at 37 A degrees C and pH 8.5. The major product
   formed in the reaction had the same retention time as that of synthetic
   3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (3H4P). It was confirmed to be 3H4P by MS/MS
   analysis of the HPLC-purified product. The K (m), V (max) and K (cat) of
   MidD were 1.27 x 10(-4) mol, 4.96 x 10(-5) mol s(-1) mg(-1), and
   2,256.05 s(-1), respectively. Although MidD has sequence similarities
   with aminotransferases, it is not an aminotransferase because it does
   not require a keto acid as the co-substrate in the degradation reaction.
   It is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme and the addition
   of 50 mu M hydroxylamine completely inhibited the reaction. However, the
   supplementation of the reaction with 0.1 mu M PLP restored the catalytic
   activity of MidD in the reaction containing 50 mu M hydroxylamine. The
   catalytic activity of MidD was found to be specific to mimosine, and the
   presence of its structural analogs including l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan
   and l-phenylalanine did not show any competitive inhibition. In addition
   to 3H4P, we also identified pyruvate and ammonia as other degradation
   products in equimolar quantities of the substrate used. The degradation
   of mimosine into a ring compound, 3H4P with the release of ammonia
   indicates that MidD of Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 is a C-N lyase.},

   Prevotella ruminicola and total bacteria on 15 sampling day (p < 0.001).
   Animals receiving diets with the dietary inclusion of Leucaena and
   Tithonia had daily N intakes of 228 and 113.5g N intake d(-1), of which
   they excreted 42\% and 61\%, respectively. Inclusion of both protein
   forages increased daily urinary volume (9\% and 7\% d(-1)), with respect

Abstract = {The research paper covered the 3 by 3 odd orientation array antenna
   (OOAA) design and fabrication by using Leucaena leucochephala
   bio-composite substrate material. The objective of the paper was to
   utilize and design off centered orientation feed array antenna with
   circular BalUn and dual matching stub to control the impedance mismatch
   issue onto the bio-composite substrate with the mixture of 70\% stem
   wood Leucaena leucochephala at 40 mesh and 30\% of polypropylene polymer
   act as laminator and noted as PB7030 substrate. The PB7030 reported
   constant on all dielectric constant (epsilon r = 3.02) and loss Tangent
   (Tan delta = 0.0082) value for the WLAN 2.4GHz applications. The overall
   result show some good agreement between simulation and fabricated result
   (Gain = 7.15dBi, VSWR=1.01, Sl1=-34.34dB and Bandwidth = 0.201Gz). All
   comparison result between simulation and fabricated antenna analyzed and
   displayed in the form of data and graph.},
