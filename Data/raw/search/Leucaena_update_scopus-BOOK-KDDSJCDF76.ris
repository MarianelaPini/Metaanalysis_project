AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (hereafter L. leucocephala) is considered one of the 100 most invasive plant species in the world and has been found in areas subject to wildfire events and flooding. Its rapid L. leucocephala invasion capacity can lead to decrease in local diversity due to the exclusion of native plant species. In this way, the L. leucocephala proliferation has advanced across the Pantanal. Here, we assess the effects of the fire, flooding and distance to the source population on the invasion of L. leucocephala, and whether this dynamic negatively affects the richness of native plant species in the Brazilian Pantanal. Our results showed that fire recurrence and flood level were the opposite under L. leucocephala invasion. Areas with low flood level and greater fire occurrence tend to have more L. leucocephala regenerants while the distance of the source population had no effect. L. leucocephala and native plants occupy sites with different abiotic conditions. In an expected scenario for the Pantanal islonger droughts and more frequent wildfire, this could mean a pronounced increase in L. leucocephala invasion over time. Therefore, the use of fire as a management action for L. leucocephala control is not recommended, and it is necessary to find methods to extract or eliminate the seed banks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists 2024.

AB  - Renewable biomass is a potent, CO2 neutral substitute to fossil coal and coke in iron making. However, there has been relatively little work on the utilization of biomass for the production of directly reduced iron (DRI). The aim of the present work is to characterize Acacia nilotica (W1), Albizia lebbeck (W2), and Leucaena leucocephala (W3) biomass and to reduce iron ore pellets primarily with the volatile matter from the wood at high temperature, yielding charcoal simultaneously as a co-product. The chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the three biomass species were investigated. Effect of different biomasses and reduction parameters like C/O ratio, reduction temperature, and time on %Reduction (%R) was studied. DRI was characterized using %Metallization (%M), XRD, and SEM. Up to 89% reduction was achieved in the simultaneous carbonization of biomass and the reduction of iron ore pellets at a temperature of 1000 °C. The pellets cooled in the furnace after reduction resulted in lower %R (e.g., W1:57%, W2:54%, and W3:63%) than the respective air-cooled pellets (e.g., W1:88%, W2:83%, and W3:86%). Oxidation was the cause for lower %R in furnace cooled (slow cooling) reduction experiments than in the air cooled. Co-produced wood charcoal after the reduction of iron ore contained approximately 76–81% carbon which competes well with a typical value for coal of 70%. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.

AB  - Prosopis juliflora and Leucaena leucocephala are notable examples of invasive woody plants that can spread throughout similar habitats in India. However, little is known about how these two species may interact with one another if future rainfall pattern shifts, which is particularly concerning. Recognizing the pivotal role of eco-physiological parameters in deciphering the dynamics of interspecific competition, a study was devised to elucidate the interplay between L. leucocephala and P. juliflora under simulated rainfall conditions. At Botanical Garden, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, UP, India, three fixed rainout shelter plots were established, each receiving distinct precipitation levels: low rainfall (LR), normal rainfall (NR), and high rainfall (HR). Within each plot, three replicate subplots were dedicated to pure stands of L. leucocephala (L), pure stands of P. juliflora (P), and mixed stands of the two species (LP). The findings of the study underscore significant variations in soil Inorganic N, N-mineralization, based on precipitation levels, with maximum values observed in HR plot and L. Similarly, biomass, photosynthetic rate, and transpiration rate exhibited significant variability in response to precipitation treatment, reaching their highest values in HR plot and L. Conversely, root length, root-shoot ratio, and water use efficiency peaked in LR plot and P, presenting a contrasting trend. This study suggests that L. leucocephala may facilitate the growth of P. juliflora by improving the soil's nitrogen availability and, consequently, the eco-physiological characteristics of the plant in mixed plant stands. Furthermore, L. leucocephala is providing P. juliflora with favourable conditions for robust growth under water stress—a scenario indicative of Facilitative approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Synthetic dyes are persistent organic environmental pollutants that can cause extensive damage to living beings and to the ecosystem as a whole. Cost-effective, sustainable, and efficient strategies to deal with this type of pollution are necessary as it commonly resists conventional water treatment methods. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using the aqueous extract from the leaves, stem, and fruits of Leucaena leucocephala (Leucena) were produced and characterized through UV–vis, TEM, EDS, SDL, XPS, XRD, and zeta potential, and they proved to be able to promote adsorption to remediate methylene blue and tartrazine pollution in water. The nanoremediation was performed and did not require direct exposure to sunlight or any special lamp or a specific reduction agent. The AgNPs produced using the extract from the leaves exhibited the best performance in nanoremediation and also presented antioxidant activity that surpassed the one from butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Consequently, it is an interesting nanotool to use in dye nanoremediation and/or as an antioxidant nanostructure. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The Caesalpinioideae subfamily contains many well-known trees that are important for economic sustainability and human health, but a lack of genomic resources has hindered their breeding and utilization. Here, we present chromosome-level reference genomes for the two food and industrial trees Gleditsia sinensis (921 Mb) and Biancaea sappan (872 Mb), the three shade and ornamental trees Albizia julibrissin (705 Mb), Delonix regia (580 Mb), and Acacia confusa (566 Mb), and the two pioneer and hedgerow trees Leucaena leucocephala (1338 Mb) and Mimosa bimucronata (641 Mb). Phylogenetic inference shows that the mimosoid clade has a much higher evolutionary rate than the other clades of Caesalpinioideae. Macrosynteny comparison suggests that the fusion and breakage of an unstable chromosome are responsible for the difference in basic chromosome number (13 or 14) for Caesalpinioideae. After an ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) shared by all Caesalpinioideae species (CWGD, ∼72.0 million years ago [MYA]), there were two recent successive WGD events, LWGD-1 (16.2–19.5 MYA) and LWGD-2 (7.1–9.5 MYA), in L. leucocephala. Thereafter, ∼40% gene loss and genome-size contraction have occurred during the diploidization process in L. leucocephala. To investigate secondary metabolites, we identified all gene copies involved in mimosine metabolism in these species and found that the abundance of mimosine biosynthesis genes in L. leucocephala largely explains its high mimosine production. We also identified the set of all potential genes involved in triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis in G. sinensis, which is more complete than that based on previous transcriptome-derived unigenes. Our results and genomic resources will facilitate biological studies of Caesalpinioideae and promote the utilization of valuable secondary metabolites. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Urban trees contribute to decarbonisation. However, the removal of trees may release the stored carbon within them. In Hong Kong, Acacia confusa and Leucaena leucocephala are being removed, but with unknown carbon impacts. This industry-academia-government collaborative research aimed to: (1) report the amount of carbon stored inside Acacia confusa and Leucaena leucocephala harvested from slopes; (2) estimate the carbon storage of a tree using dendrometric measurements; and (3) explain the variation in carbon content percentage of urban trees with respect to tree species, part of the tree, and position within the part. 10 Acacia confusa and 10 Leucaena leucocephala were harvested during March- September, 2023. Each tree was weighed for carbon storage estimation. Results showed that Acacia confusa had higher mean wood volume, biomass and carbon storage than Leucaena leucocephala. The mean carbon content of the analysed samples (45.53-52.58%) were mostly significantly different from 50%. But the difference may become insignificant depending on how volatile carbon loss was controlled. Diameter at breast height (mm) was a significant predictor of carbon storage (kg) for both Acacia. confusa (β = 0.9574) and Leucaena leucocephala (β = 0.3909). Significant interaction between tree species and tree part on carbon content percentage was confirmed. This research demonstrated the impacts of past arboricultural decisions on present decarbonisation plans. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2024.

AB  - Wild edible vegetables (WEVs) are integral for sustained nutrition and livelihood of forest-dwelling tribal communities. Shelf-life enhancement of WEVs is crucial to overcome their perishability and ensure availability. Chemical preservatives are detrimental to their commercial ‘organic’ status, and modern processing technologies are often challenging to be implemented by the marginalized farmers. In this study, four nutritionally important WEVs popularly cultivated, consumed and marketed in the hilly, forest-covered state of Mizoram, India, namely, Solanum aethiopicum (ST), Solanum torvum (TP), Solanum anguivi (TT) and Leucaena leucocephala (JZ), were subjected to brining and drying to enhance their shelf-lives. The drying method was standardized using response surface methodology at 80 °C and 540 minutes, obtaining the lowest moisture content with the highest total phenolic content (TPC) and DPPH radical scavenging activity (DRSA). A strong positive correlation was obtained between TPC and DRSA values of ST (R = 0.738), TP (R = 0.760), TT (R = 0.977) and JZ (R = 0.935). Both brined bottled and dried vacuum-packaged samples were studied over 35 days of storage. Packaged dried samples were stored at room temperature (RT) and under refrigeration (RF). Brined WEVs showed a decrease in moisture and carbohydrate contents. Microbial conversion of sugars to lactic acid was evidenced by lowering pH to below 3.0. Bacterial activity also markedly enhanced TPC, flavonoids and DRSA values by causing free phenolics release and their structural transformation. However, overall microbial population in terms of aerobic coliform bacteria and fungal species were efficiently retarded up to more than 65% by the two treatments. Vacuum-packaged RF samples exhibited lowered microbial metabolism. Pigment degeneration and tissue structure changes were indicated by changed color and hardness. Dried tissue brittleness enhanced the extractability of bioactive compounds. Vacuum-packaging improved antioxidant retention in the processed WEVs. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Leucaena leucocephala (hereafter L. leucocephala) is considered one of the 100 most invasive plant species in the world and has been found in areas subject to wildfire events and flooding. The rapid L. leucocephala invasion capacity can lead to decrease in local diversity due to the exclusion of native plant species. In this way, the L. leucocephala proliferation has advanced across the Pantanal. Here, we assess the effects of the fire, flooding and distance to the source population on the invasion of L. leucocephala, and whether this dynamic negatively affects the richness of native plant species in the Brazilian Pantanal. Our results showed that at intermediate fire frequencies (areas burnt twice) and average flood levels, there is a decrease in L. leucocephala and an increase in native species. The effect of fire is limited to the medium flood level, where the occurrence of two burns reduces L. leucocephala compared to one and four burns. When the area is burned twice, the flood gradient reduces L. leucocephala invasion from the least to the most flooded area. In both high (four times) and low (once) fire frequencies the L. leucocephala regenerants only decrease when the flood level is high. In an expected scenario for the Pantanal is longer droughts this could mean a pronounced increase in L. leucocephala invasion over time. Therefore, reducing the flood period by climate changes or hydric enterprise projects that affect flood pulse may increase alien species invasion. Finally, it is necessary to find management methods that prevent the growth and spread of L. leucocephala without harming the native seed bank. Leucaena leucocephala (doravante L. leucocephala) é considerada uma das 100 espécies de plantas mais invasivas do mundo e tem sido encontrada em zonas sujeitas a incêndios florestais e inundações. A rápida capacidade de invasão da L. leucocephala pode levar à diminuição da diversidade local devido à exclusão das plantas nativas. Dessa forma, a proliferação da L. leucocephala tem avançado pelo Pantanal. Aqui, avaliamos os efeitos do fogo, inundação e distância da população fonte na invasão da L. leucocephala, e se essa dinâmica afeta negativamente a riqueza de espécies de plantas nativas no Pantanal brasileiro. Nossos resultados mostraram que a recorrência de fogo e o nível de inundação tiveram efeito oposto sobre a invasão de L. leucocephala. Áreas com baixo nível de inundação e maior ocorrência de fogo tendem a ter mais regenerantes de L. leucocephala, enquanto a distância da população de origem não teve efeito. L. leucocephala e plantas nativas ocupam locais com condições abióticas diferentes. Em um cenário esperado para o Pantanal de secas mais longas e incêndios mais frequentes, isso pode significar um aumento pronunciado na invasão de L. leucocephala ao longo do tempo. Portanto, o uso do fogo como ação de manejo para o controle da L. leucocephala não é recomendado, sendo necessário encontrar métodos para extrair ou eliminar o banco de sementes.

Aqui, avaliamos os efeitos do fogo, inundação e distância da população fonte na invasão da L. leucocephala, e se essa dinâmica afeta negativamente a riqueza de espécies de plantas nativas no Pantanal brasileiro. Os nossos resultados mostram que frequência intermédia de fogo (áreas queimadas duas vezes) e nível médio de inundação, há uma diminuição de L. leucocephala e um aumento de plantas nativas. O efeito do fogo é limitado ao nível médio de inundação, onde a ocorrência de duas queimadas reduz L. leucocephala em comparação com áreas queimadas uma ou quatro queimadas. Quando a área é queimada duas vezes, o gradiente de inundação reduz a invasão de L. leucocephala da área menos para a mais inundada. Em ambas as frequências de fogo, alta (quatro vezes) e baixa (uma vez), os regenerantes de L. leucocephala só diminuem quando o nível de inundação é alto. Em um cenário esperado para o Pantanal de secas mais longas isso pode significar um aumento pronunciado na invasão de L. leucocephala ao longo do tempo. Portanto, a redução do período de inundação por mudanças climáticas ou projetos de empreendimentos hídricos que afetam o pulso de inundação podem aumentar a invasão de espécies exóticas. Por fim, é necessário encontrar métodos de manejo que impeçam o crescimento e a disseminação de L. leucocephala sem prejudicar o banco de sementes nativas. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists 2025.

AB  - This study explores the development of urea-functionalized hydrochar from Leucaena leucocephala wood (LW) for CO2 capture. Hydrochar was produced via hydrothermal carbonization at 170 °C for 90 min and subsequently functionalized with urea. The effects of urea: hydrochar ratio (1:1 to 3:1), activation temperature (400–800 °C), and heating rate (5–15 °C/min) on CO2 adsorption capacity were investigated. Optimal conditions (2:1 urea: hydrochar ratio, 600 °C activation temperature, 5° C/min heating rate) increased CO2 adsorption capacity from 13.09 mg/g to 76.20 mg/g. The modified adsorbent demonstrated high affinity towards CO2 over N2, CH4, and O2, and maintained performance over 11 adsorption–desorption cycles. Kinetic studies revealed physisorption as the primary adsorption mechanism. In fixed-bed column tests, best performing conditions within the tested ranges (30 ml/min flow rate, 15% CO2 concentration, 30 °C) yielded a CO2 uptake of 195.54 mg/g. This study demonstrates the potential of urea-functionalized hydrochar from Leucaena leucocephala as an efficient, sustainable adsorbent for CO2 capture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Natural materials have a high potential to be used as coagulant/flocculant owing to the problems of inorganic materials. Petai belalang (Leucaena leucocephala) is a widely abundant plant in Malaysia and very efficient as a plant-based coagulant in previous research. This research investigated the effectiveness of seeds of L. leucocephala in removing turbidity from synthetic wastewater and the effect of operation parameters of jar test on treatment performance through optimization of dosage, pH, rapid mixing speed and time, slow mixing speed and time, and settling time. The water extraction method was used to extract the active ingredients from the seeds by drying and pulverizing the seeds and then dissolving them in distilled water at a concentration of 20 g/L. The extraction solution of the seeds gives removal efficiency of turbidity of 93.05% at the optimum operation parameters dosage, pH, rapid mixing speed and time, slow mixing speed and time, and settling time of 120 mg/L, 6.5, 260 rpm for 11 min, 30 rpm for 15 min, and 30 min, respectively. It is expected that bridging was the possible mechanism given that the flocs are formed under the same negative zeta potential condition. With this high performance of L. leucocephala, it has high potential to be used as a coagulant in wastewater treatment at specific operation parameters with further exploration to determine the optimum extraction method of the active ingredients. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.

AB  - Maize is one of the important cereal crops grown in rainfed regions of northwestern Himalayas, however, persistent use of chemical fertilizers coupled with poor soil nutrients and water holding capacity due to coarse textured soils poses serious threat to sustaining maize yield and soil health. To address these bottlenecks, a long-term experiment with application of organic manures and mineral fertilizer provides insights to quantify changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), crop yield and rain water use efficiency (RWUE) in rainfed area having low water use efficiency. A twelve years field experiment was conducted under dry sub-humid Inceptisols in northern India to study the potential impacts of organic and mineral fertilization on maize (Zea mays L.) productivity, water use efficiency and soil quality. Ten treatments were assessed, involving different nitrogen levels (20, 30, and 40 kg N ha⁻¹) combined with 10 tha⁻¹ year⁻¹ of farmyard manure (FYM), in-situ green manure from sunhemp, and the incorporation of Leucaena leucocephala leaves at 5 tha⁻¹ year⁻¹, including an unfertilized control. Maize yield increased linearly with increasing nitrogen application rates. The combination of FYM @ 10t ha−1 and 40 kg N ha−1(T4) yielded the highest maize production. Manure addition improved soil organic carbon (SOC) and major soil nutrients (N, P and K) while unfertilized control showed decline in soil nutrients compared to their initial values. Compared with control, incorporation of 10 t ha−1 FYM increased SOC by 1.3, 1.41, 1.44 times at application rate of 20, 30, 40 kg N ha−1, respectively. Application of N@40 kg ha−1 + 10t FYM ha−1 showed highest rain water use efficiency (RWUE) and relative production efficiency index (RPEI) (2.74 kg ha−1 mm−1 and 82, respectively) and the lowest rank sum of 6. Highly significant positive relationship existed between RPEI and RWUE, RPEI and sustainability yield index (SYI), RWUE and SYI indicated the superiority of FYM in combination with mineral fertilizer. Regression models, correlating yield with monthly rainfall and crop growing periods, indicated that the integration of FYM (10 tha⁻¹) with 40 kg N ha⁻¹ was most effective in achieving the highest relative soil quality index (RSQI) of 76 and the greatest sustainability yield index (SYI) of 49.3%. Based on results, we recommend balanced fertilization (N@40 kg ha−1 +10t FYM ha−1) which is easily manageable by farmers as the optimal strategy for improving soil quality and achieving sustainable maize productivity in nutrient depleted Inceptisols of northern India. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The rhizosphere is an important interface for soil–plant interaction and a significant zone for the uptake and removal of heavy metals from soils. This study assesses the level of heavy metals contamination in the rhizosphere of plants growing at a decommissioned tailings dam in Ghana. Concentrations of heavy metals [Arsenic, Cadmium, Copper, Iron, Manganese and Zinc] and physicochemical parameters [pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, phosphate, nitrate, sulfate] of rhizospheric soils were determined. The assessment of the extent of rhizospheric contamination was conducted using the enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (Igeo), and pollution load index (PLI). Factor analysis unveiled the most relevant heavy metal contributors to rhizosphere contamination. Results indicate moderate to significant enrichment of Cd (1.72 – 8.28) and Mn (1.70 – 8.32) in the rhizosphere. The PLI showed that rhizospheres are heavily polluted (18.8 – 29.6) and thus require remediation. Principal component analysis revealed significant Cd, As, and Fe contamination in the rhizosphere accrues from anthropogenic or mining activities. The levels of heavy metal ions in the rhizosphere suggest that Mimosa pudica, Centrosema pubescens, Leucaena leucocephala, Pueraria phaseoloides, and Tridax procumbens could be investigated as candidates for phytostabilization of mine tailings. This study emphasizes the importance of effective remediation and continual tailing dam monitoring before and after decommissioning to avert the spread of heavy metal contaminants. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Water contamination that caused by heavy metals is a very common phenomenon in the industrial age. One of the popular way to treat metal contaminated water is by adsorption process using activated carbon as the adsorbent. This paper works on producing activated carbon by chemical means with impregnation ratios of NaOH:char (w/w) was predetermined at 1:1 (ACT1-1), 2:1 (ACT2-1) and 3:1 (ACT3-1) under activation temperature of 700 °C. In other to reduce cost of production, cheap raw material which is the Leucaena leucocephala was used as the precursor. The properties of these activated carbons and its potential for cadmium removal from aqueus solution was analyzed. It was found that the highest surface area was recorded at 662.76 m²/g. Four parameters were studied which are contact time, the effect of pH, initial concentration of adsorbate and temperature. The equilibrium time was achieved in 40 min treatment at initial concentrations of 30 mg/l. The adsorbent exhibited good sorption potential for cadmium at pH 8.0 and equilibrium temperature of 30 °C. Based on the results, this study had proved that activated carbon from Leucaena leucocephala biomass have the good potential to be used for removal of cadmium from wastewater. © 2024 Author(s).

AB  - This study aims to synthesize and characterize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from Leucaena leucocephala leaf extract and evaluate their effectiveness in photo-catalytically degrading indigo carmine (IC) dye in an aqueous solution. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized using UV-visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) was employed to optimize the conditions for the photocatalytic degradation of IC dye under solar light. The results show that 97.52% of the maximum photodegradation of IC dye was achieved using a dye concentration, catalyst volume, and reaction time of 19.7 mgL-1, 4.47 mL, and 97 min, respectively. RSM results revealed optimal conditions for IC dye degradation under solar irradiation. Moreover, the kinetics study of IC dye showed a good correlation with the pseudo-first order kinetic model. © 2024, Faculty of Engineering, Khon Kaen University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, a prominent invasive woody plant in India, is constantly recognised for its capacity to invade in various ecosystems. The chances of invasion by L. leucocephala are increasing due to rainfall variability, to which the plant has already adapted. However, the understanding of L. leucocephala, particularly its response to soil attributes and alterations in nutrient cycling processes under varying rainfall conditions, is currently inadequate. In response to the perceived threat of rainfall shift and invasion impacting native plant species through soil modification, the study was designed to investigate the interplay between L. leucocephala invasion and simulated rainfall conditions. The experimental setup included three rainout shelter plots receiving different precipitation levels (low, normal, and high) and subplots within each plot dedicated to pure stands of L. leucocephala. The study findings reveal significant variations in soil inorganic nitrogen and N-mineralization based on precipitation levels and seasons, with the highest values observed in the high rainfall plot and during the rainy season. In contrast, microbial biomass (carbon and nitrogen) peaked in the low rainfall plot and during the summer season, indicating a contrasting trend. The implications of the study suggest that, in addition to variable rainfall, L. leucocephala may play a significant role in altering nutrient cycling, particularly nitrogen cycling. The plant enhances soil properties related to nitrogen availability, creating opportunities for multiple invasions and potentially leading to a chance of “Invasion Meltdown,” with a significant threat to native biodiversity. Overall, the research is emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics to formulate effective management strategies for preserving native ecosystems. © International Society for Tropical Ecology 2025.

AB  - Polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) formed by the interaction between oppositely charged polymers have emerged as promising carriers for accomplishing colon-specific release. In this study, we have explored the potential of polyelectrolyte complexes between a succinate derivative of Leucaena leucocephala galactomannan and cationic guar gum for colon delivery of synbiotic. The PECs were prepared using a polyelectrolyte complexation method and characterized. The PECs exhibited excellent stability, with high encapsulation efficiency for both probiotics (95.53 %) and prebiotics (83.33 %). In vitro studies demonstrated enhanced survivability and proliferation of the encapsulated probiotics in the presence of prebiotics (93.29 %). The SEM images revealed a smooth and firm structure with reduced number of pores when both prebiotic and probiotic were encapsulated together. The treatment with synbiotic PECs in acetic acid induced IBD rats significantly relieves colitis symptoms as was evident from colon/body ratio, DAI score and histopathology studies. An increase in the protein and reduced glutathione levels and reduction in superoxide dismutase activity was observed in colitic rats that received synbiotic treatment as compared to colitic rats. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Leucaena leucocephala succinate-cationic guar gum PECs as a promising system for colon-specific synbiotic delivery, with implications for improved gut health and the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Multifunctional leguminous trees like Gliricidia sepium Jacq. (Steud.) and Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (de Wit) are ideal for sustainable agro-ecological farming systems. They are commonly used in alley cropping to provide a sustainable source of nitrogen to cultivated crops or in silvopastoral systems where the leaves are used as livestock feed. However, these plants produce fruits that are not widely used. This study evaluated the nutritive value of mature fruits from G. sepium and L. leucocephala plants to determine their potential as supplemental feedstuffs for ruminants. Mature fruits were collected from 15 plants of each species and evaluated for crude protein (CP), total digestible nutrients (TDN), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), lignin, non-fiber carbohydrates, total digestible nutrients, minerals, phytochemicals, in-vitro ruminal dry matter degradability (IVDMD) and 48-h (h) in-vitro ruminal organic matter digestibility (IVOMD). The concentration of CP (242 g/kg DM) was approximately 28% higher in G. sepium fruits. The TDN (552 g/kg DM), NDF (560.1 g/kg DM) and 48-h IVOMD (590 g/kg) were superior in L. leucocephala fruits. Similarly, L. leucocephala fruits had significantly higher minerals (i.e., calcium, magnesium, potassium, among others). However, G. sepium fruits had lower concentrations of soluble and insoluble condensed tannins and mimosine. The immediately degradable fraction (265.9 g/kg DM), potential degradability (621.6 g/kg DM), and effective degradability (438.9 g/kg DM) values were higher in L. leucocephala fruits. We concluded that mature fruits of G. sepium plant may be a better protein supplement for poor quality grass forages than L. leucocephala because of higher CP and lower phytochemicals contents. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Using cooking oil at high temperatures can increase oil damage due to the formation of free fatty acids, which can be reduced by adsorption. Adsorption of Free Fatty Acids in Low Levels can still be improved using lamtoro char converted into activated carbon. Determining the equilibrium and thermodynamics of Lamtoro carbon as an adsorbent for frying tofu cooking oil is targeted in the research. Lamtoro activated carbon assistant ratio of 1:1.5 (Carbon:KOH). Furthermore, the mixture of materials is heated using a furnace at a temperature of 800 oC. The activated carbon is then washed and neutralized, sieved with a grain size of 400 mesh, and then granulated to a sieve size of 8-16 mesh. The adsorption process was carried out for 6 hours with a ratio of 1% (w/w) adsorbent to the weight of the used cooking oil. The characterization test was on the O-H hydrogen bonding ability between activated carbon and cooking oil. The Freundlich isotherm best describes the adsorption equilibrium (R2>0.93). Thermodynamic parameters, including enthalpy change, free energy, and entropy, were evaluated at 32-40 °C. Adsorption is endothermic and involves physical adsorption, indicating a spontaneous adsorption process. It can be recommended for processing used cooking oil in household kitchens. © 2024 Author(s).

AB  - Context: The planting and use of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) to fatten cattle is both practical and profitable for smallholder farmers in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Currently smallholder farmers feed leucaena as the primary component of a cattle fattening diet. However, the high protein content in leucaena could be more effectively used if combined with a fermentable energy source, such as cassava (Manihot utilissima). Aim: An experiment was conducted to determine the ratio of leucaena to cassava corresponding to largest average daily gain and most efficient feed conversion for gain. Methods: Thirty growing male Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) 18 months of age with an initial live weight of 164 ± 1.8 kg (mean ± s.e.) were allocated to one of six experimental treatments in a randomised block design. Bulls were held in individual stalls and had access to experimental diets and water ad libitum. The diets were 20% rice straw + 80% leucaena hay (A), 20% rice straw + 65% leucaena hay + 15% cassava meal (B), 20% rice straw + 50% leucaena hay + 30% cassava meal (C), 20% rice straw + 35% leucaena hay + 45% cassava meal (D), 20% rice straw + 20% leucaena hay + 60% cassava meal (E) and 20% rice straw + 5% leucaena hay + 75% cassava meal (F). A mineral mix was provided at 1% DM of total diet and urea was added to the cassava meal at 2% DM. In consideration of animal welfare concerns, the trial was concluded on Day 77 due to observations indicating that bulls receiving the highest level of cassava (F) were experiencing significant weight loss. Key results: The optimum level of inclusion of cassava was 29.5% (based on the quadratic response curve) but there was little difference in average daily gain up to 45% inclusion. Feeding a high level of cassava meal (more than 45% of diet) reduced feed intake, average daily gain and income over feed cost. Conclusion: Cassava meal can be successfully and profitably incorporated into leucaena-based rations of Bali bulls for fattening. Implications: Formulating rations with cassava meal and leucaena can be economically beneficial in cattle fattening systems.  © 2024 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - The presence of invasive plant species poses a substantial ecological impact, thus comprehensive evaluation of their potential range and risk under the influence of climate change is necessary. This study uses maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling to forecast the likelihood of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit invasion in Saudi Arabia under present and future climate change scenarios. Utilizing the MaxEnt modeling, we integrated climatic and soil data to predict habitat suitability for the invasive species. We conducted a detailed analysis of the distribution patterns of the species, using climate variables and ecological factors. We focused on the important influence of temperature seasonality, temperature annual range, and precipitation seasonality. The distribution modeling used robust measures of area under the curve (AUC) and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves, to map the invasion extent, which has a high level of accuracy in identifying appropriate habitats. The complex interaction that influenced the invasion of L. leucocephala was highlighted by the environmental parameters using Jackknife test. Presently, the actual geographic area where L. leucocephala was found in Saudi Arabia was considerably smaller than the theoretical maximum range, suggesting that it had the capacity to expand further. The MaxEnt model exhibited excellent prediction accuracy and produced reliable results based on the data from the ROC curve. Precipitation and temperature were the primary factors influencing the potential distribution of L. leucocephala. Currently, an estimated area of 216,342 km2 in Saudi Arabia was at a high probability of invasion by L. leucocephala. We investigated the potential for increased invasion hazards in the future due to climate change scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 245 and 585). The analysis of key climatic variables, including temperature seasonality and annual range, along with soil properties such as clay composition and nitrogen content, unveiled their substantial influence on the distribution dynamic of L. leucocephala. Our findings indicated a significant expansion of high risk zones. High-risk zones for L. leucocephala invasion in the current climate conditions had notable expansions projected under future climate scenarios, particularly evident in southern Makkah, Al Bahah, Madina, and Asir areas. The results, backed by thorough spatial studies, emphasize the need to reduce the possible ecological impacts of climate change on the spread of L. leucocephala. Moreover, the study provides valuable strategic insights for the management of invasion, highlighting the intricate relationship between climate change, habitat appropriateness, and the risks associated with invasive species. Proactive techniques are suggested to avoid and manage the spread of L. leucocephala, considering its high potential for future spread. This study enhances the overall comprehension of the dynamics of invasive species by combining modeling techniques with ecological knowledge. It also provides valuable information for decision-making to implement efficient conservation and management strategies in response to changing environmental conditions. © Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of inoculation and co-inoculation of rhizobia and Azospirillum brasilense combined with humic substances (HS) in growth promotion of Phaseolus lunatus (lima bean) and Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena). For this, experiments in a greenhouse with the cultivation of each plant species were carried out. A randomized complete block experimental design with five repetitions was followed. Plant seeds were sown and then inoculated with rhizobia and co-inoculated with A. brasilense. Subsequently, HS were added at the dose recommended by the manufacturer. In the experiments with both plants, control treatments with the addition of nitrogen (N) with or without HS were used. After 45 days, the shoot dry mass (SDM), root dry mass (RDM), shoot-accumulated N (Nac) and relative efficiency index (REI) were determined. In addition, the mass of dry nodules (MDN) in the lima bean plants and the number of nodules (NN) in leucaena plants were determined. The results showed that in the lima bean and leucaena plants there was a greater increase in SDM, RDM and Nac in treatments that received HS and co-inoculation with rhizobia and A. brasilense than in treatments that were inoculated only with rhizobia and HS and in treatments that received N and HS compared to addition of N and isolated inoculation of rhizobia. The combined application of HS and rhizobia in co-inoculation with A. brasilense had a greater effect on the increase of MDN in lima bean and NN in leucaena, than in treatments where only rhizobia with HS were added. These results indicate the existence of potential interaction of the use of HS with the co-inoculation of rhizobia and A. brasilense, showing promise for the production of sustainable agricultural crops. © 2024, Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia.

AB  - The medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) industries generate a substantial amount of waste and residues during the production of many important and useful products. If not effectively managed, these wastes can lead to environmental pollution and economic challenges. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on the use of these waste materials to create value-added products. One such method is vermicomposting which converts MAP wastes into vermicompost and offers numerous benefits for agricultural applications. Vermicompost serves as an organic fertilizer that improves soil health and fertility while reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. This comprehensive review explores the management of residual waste released from the MAPs industries, focusing on their conversion into vermicompost and their subsequent application in the agriculture sector. The waste generated during the extraction of essential oils from MAPs is also discussed along with the importance of implementing eco-friendly waste management solutions. Overall, this review sheds light on the production of MAP wastes, problems generated and the possible solutions for their environmental friendly management. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Slope exposure is one of the environmental factors that influences vegetation characteristics. Although there are studies on this aspect in various types of vegetation, up to now submontane shrublands have not been extensively studied. In this work, the effect of slope exposure on the structure and composition of plant species in a state park in northeastern Mexico where the dominant vegetation is submontane scrub was evaluated. Ten 10 x 10 m exposure sites were sampled: northeast, southwest and northwest. Total height (h), basal diameter (d0.10) and crown diameter (k) were measured for each individual. Our hypotheses were: 1) the northwestern exposure community will have greater basal area, canopy cover, volume, absolute abundance, and specific richness due to higher humidity, 2) each slope will present dissimilarity in species composition. As results, nine families, 17 genera and 17 species of vascular plants were recorded. Fabaceae was the best represented family with six species. The species with the highest importance value index were the endemic shrub Neopringlea integrifolia in the northeast exposure (21.52 %) and the exotic tree Leucaena leucocephala in the southwest (16.17 %) and northwest (27.16 %) exposures. It is concluded that the plant community of the northwest exposure has a greater basal area, crown cover, volume, absolute abundance and specific richness. However, there was no real difference in the species composition of the three exposures. © 2024 The author(s). Gayana Botánica and 2024 Universidad de Concepción.

AB  - Currently, empty fruit bunch (EFB) is the main biomass source to fuel biomass power plant and as co-firing fuel with coal at the existing coal-fired power plants in Malaysia. However, these power plants frequently face insufficient EFB supply, which may contribute to load losses. Energy crops a new source of biomass, are introduced to replace or substitute the shortage of biomass supply. Planting energy crops worldwide ensures a sufficient and cleaner fuel supply for power generation. Positive characteristics of the energy crop are including calorific value, carbon contents and density. Higher value of these parameters indicating the good quality of the energy crop. While, the negative characteristics of energy crop are including moisture content and ash content. Higher value of these two parameters indicating lower quality of energy crop. One of the studied energy crops was Leucaena leucocephala (Petai Belalang), which showed better quality than EFB, based on calorific value, moisture content, ash content and density. It is naturally grown, typically near rivers in Peninsular Malaysia. Furthermore, it can be easily planted and matures in about six months for harvesting. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - L’élevage de ruminants en Afrique subsaharienne (ASS) est pratiqué dans divers systèmes de production: systèmes mixtes agriculture-élevage, pastoraux, agropastoraux, intensifs des petits exploitants, et commerciaux intensifs de production de lait ou de viande (Vall et al., 2014). Les races locales de ruminants sont favorisées dans ces systèmes en raison de leur capacité à s’adapter aux conditions climatiques, alimentaires et sanitaires en contexte tropical. L’alimentation des ruminants en ASS se base principalement sur une diversité de ressources fourragères: les fourrages naturels herbacés et ligneux (Zornia glochidiata, Pennisetum pedicellatum, Combretum glutinosum, Sclerocarya birrea), les fourrages cultivés d’espèces herbacées et ligneuses (Panicummaximum, Brachiaria ruziziensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium) et les coproduits agricoles (pailles, tourteaux, sons). Les gaz à effet de serre (GES) émis pendant la production de ressources alimentaires sont essentiellement le CO2 et le N2O (Gerber et al., 2013) tandis que l’utilisation de ces ressources par l’animal est à l’origine d’émissions de méthane entérique (eCH4) essentiellement, de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O issus de la dégradation des déjections. Le secteur agricole (agriculture et élevage) de l’ASS contribue à 12 % des émissions mondiales de méthane (CH4) dont 71 % de eCH4 (Climatewatch, 2020). Selon la FAO (2023), l’élevage de ruminants dans cette région engendre une émission de eCH4 élevée lorsqu’elle est rapportée à la quantité de produits, due à la faible efficience alimentaire des animaux. Les intensités d’émissions de eCH4 sont par exemple de 58 g/kg lait en Afrique contre 24 g/kg lait en Asie et 17 g/kg lait en Europe de l’Ouest (GIEC, 2019).; Several methods have been proposed for in vivo measurement, prediction and mitigation of ruminant enteric methane (eCH4) emissions. Most of these methods are expensive, technically complex and not adapted to the specificities of livestock systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This review aims to analyze the different individual measurement techniques according to farming conditions in SSA. In vivo measurement techniques include the respiratory chamber, the ventilated hood, the GreenFeed system (C-Lock) and sulfur hexafluoride as a tracer. They are discussed and classified according to their field of application. The eCH4’s indirect measurement approaches rely on proxies (or predictors) derived from different biological matrices. In SSA, the proxies likely to be used in the various rearing conditions are the characteristics of intake (quantity, composition), milk (quantity, global composition estimated by MIR spectra), faeces (archeols, global composition estimated by SPIR spectra) or exhaled gases. Furthermore, potential eCH4 mitigation strategies adapted to SSA include 1) the use of tree legumes, by-product-based concentrates, crop co-products and residues, and preserved forages; 2) grazing improvement; 3) replacement of unproductive animals; 4) maintaining of animal good health; and 5) reducing of females first calving age. © 2024 INRAE Clermont-Ferrand - Auvergne - Rhone-Alpes.

AB  - Litterfall, decomposition, and nutrient release to the soil are important biogeochemical cycling processes in agroecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of decomposition and nutrient release of the leaves of four tree legumes with agroforestry potential: Piscidia piscipula, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Lysiloma latisiliquum, common in the areas with natural regeneration after the abandonment of agriculture in south-eastern Mexico. We employed 112 litterbags with 40 g of dry leaf litter on ground surface for decomposition and recollected seven bags per species at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. The initial and recollected samples were oven-dried, and weighed to determine the remaining dry mass (DM), organic matter (OM), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) content, and the C:N ratio. The initial OM and N contents of L. leucocephala leaves were greater, compared to the rest of the legumes. P. piscidia and G. sepium showed the highest C content. P. piscidia, G. sepium, and L. latisiliquum had the highest C:N ratio, compared to L. leucocephala. The relative decomposition rate k values of DM, OM, C, and N were greater for L. leucocephala. The remaining DM, OM, C, and N were affected by the interaction between species and decomposition time. G. sepium and L. latisiliquum showed greater remaining mass from 30 to 60 days of decomposition. However, after 60 days L. latisiliquum showed the greatest remaining DM and OM until the end of the incubation period (120 days). We conclude that L. leucocephala had the highest rate of decomposition and the fastest release of nitrogen, however, the asynchronous pattern of litter decomposition among the tree legumes showed the potential to supply OM and nutrients to the soil for a prolonged period if planted in combination in agroforestry systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Different studies have shown that leguminous forage species have a high impact and value in silvopastoral systems in terms of the contribution they represent for livestock feeding, based on the increase in both the potential of soils and the production of meat for livestock. The objective was to determine the productive potential in terms of dry matter in two contrasting seasons, dry and wet, for the leguminous species Albizia guachapele (Kunth) Dugand, Albizia niopoides (Benth.) Burkart, Albizia saman (Jacq.) Merr., and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. This study was conducted at the Nataima Research Center of the Colombian Agricultural Research Corporation, located in the municipality of Espinal-Tolima, Colombia, between March and August 2018. A design of repeated measures over time and arrangement of randomized complete blocks, four treatments, and two evaluation periods were used, and eight interactions between the species and rainy season factors were worked on. The species A. guachapele presented the best productive potential compared to the others; there were statistical differences for cutting times in the species evaluated, and a high variability effect was observed due to the time factor. A. saman was the least productive species, while production stabilization was demonstrated for all those evaluated over time. There was no significant bidirectional interaction for the season factor, and the best performance corresponded to those carried out in the dry season. This allowed a greater expression of the productive potential as a food alternative for low rainfall areas. © 2024, Rev. Mex. Cienc. Agricolas. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) is a leguminous tree widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions due to its strong environmental suitability for abiotic stresses, especially drought. However, the molecular mechanisms and key pathways involved in Leucaena's drought response require further elucidation. Here, we comparatively analyzed the physiological and early transcriptional responses of Leucaena leaves and roots under drought stress simulated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments. Drought stress induced physiological changes in Leucaena seedlings, including decreases in relative water content (RWC) and increases in relative electrolyte leakage (REL), malondialdehyde (MDA), proline contents as well as antioxidant enzyme activities. In response to drought stress, 6461 and 8295 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the leaves and roots, respectively. In both tissues, the signaling transduction pathway of plant hormones was notably the most enriched. Specifically, abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and signaling related genes (NCED, PP2C, SnRK2 and ABF) were strongly upregulated particularly in leaves. The circadian rhythm, DNA replication, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and secondary metabolites biosynthesis related pathways were repressed in leaves, while the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis processes were promoted in roots. Furthermore, heterologous overexpression of Leucaena drought-inducible genes (PYL5, PP2CA, bHLH130, HSP70 and AUX22D) individually in yeast increased the tolerance to drought and heat stresses. Overall, these results deepen our understanding of the tissue-specific mechanisms of Leucaena in response to drought and provide target genes for future drought-tolerance breeding engineering in crops. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Researchers have always been interested in polysaccharide degradation because of the increased biological activity and usability following degradation. In this work, low molecular weight galactomannan (LMW-GM) was produced through the degradation of galactomannan by H2O2 and oxalic acid (OA). The optimal reaction conditions were found by conducting the response surface optimization experiment based on single-factor experiment and kinetics analysis. Under these conditions, the LMW-GM yield was 69.48 ± 1.02 %. Ultimately, an analysis of the degradation process revealed that OA attacked GM indiscriminately, and H2O2 has a stronger effect on the removal of branched chains while degrading GM. Hence, the degradation steps were rearranged as H2O2 was added 20 min before OA at a constant total time. The LMW-GM yield was successfully increased to 76.49 ± 1.27 %. The goal of this work is hopefully to give a theoretical foundation for the low-cost preparation and industrial production of the degradation of galactomannan. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The historical and geographical properties of the archipelagos allow a detailed study of species diversification, and phenotypic traits can indicate the extent of such processes. Eupelmus pulchriceps (Cameron, 1904) is an exotic species to the Galapagos archipelago, and generalist parasitoid that attacks a beetle species that consumes the seeds of the invasive shrub Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Despite extensive sampling, the wasp is recorded only in Santa Cruz and San Cristobal islands of the Galapagos archipelago. Thus, using 112 female wasps, we compare body size, proportion, and allometric differentiations within and between the two islands. There were no body size differences between islands. A PerMANOVA indicates differences between the islands and a single differentiation between two localities of one island. Allometric differences between islands were not the same for all structures. These results are consistent with the greater distance between islands than between localities and suggest a differentiation process. The variables with allometric differentiation are associated with wings and ovipositor, possibly responding to different ecological pressures. It is interesting that this parasitoid, recently arrived at the archipelago, is already showing differentiation. Also, it is essential to monitor the behavior of these wasps in the archipelago, given their potential to access other species affecting the trophic interactions of the local biota. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (White leadtree) legume seed is promoted in several countries of Southeast Asia. The young pods are edible and occasionally eaten by Indonesians because of their unique combination taste of savory, sweet and slightly bitter. This study investigated the processing effects of steam blanching on the protein profile (total amino acids) and the taste components of L. leucocephala seed flour. A 5-minute steam blanching on seeds increased the soluble sugar components from 10.59±1.091 to 14.78±1.590 mg/g (dry basis) and free amino acids content from 39.25±2.260 to 49.66±2.070 mg/g on the seed flour. On the other hand, steam blanching could decrease the content of the organic acid (167.78±4.800 mg/g to 149.29±10.420 mg/g) and the value of total amino acids from 23.86±1.293 (%w/w) to 24.43±1.411 (%w/w). Leucaena leucocephala seed flour had an essential amino acids ratio (E/T) value of 37.09±2.340– 37.94± 1.130, predicted protein efficiency ratio (P-PER) of 0.27±0.002–0.30±1.668. In addition to the umami taste contributor component, a nucleotide compound was detected in fresh and steamed seed flour namely inosine-monophosphate (IMP). Equivalent umami concentration (EUC) showed that L. leucocephala seed flour contains high MSG-like components (425.92±4.76 to 540.12±13.05 mg MSG/100 g). Glutamic acid and aspartic acid, in line with Inosine Monophosphate (IMP), are MSG-like components providing a savory taste, known as ‘umami’ by receptors in humans. Steam blanching for five minutes prevented the degradation of sweet and savory compounds. Thus, the seed flour of L. leucocephala is notably marked to be utilized as an alternative to functional food with an umami taste. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The study examines how varying harvesting intervals and processing methods affect the physicochemical and nutritional properties of Cogon grass (Imperata cylindrica Linn) silage. Its goal is to determine optimal practices for improving silage quality and nutritional value to support sustainable livestock feeding in tropical regions. A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used, with four treatments based on harvesting intervals (20, 25, 30, and 35 days) and three replications per treatment. Cogon grass silages were enhanced with 2.1% urea molasses, 5.12% maize bran, and 8.9% Ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf meal to improve fermentation and nutrition. The 20-day interval (T1) had the highest dry matter (DM, 39.1%) and crude protein (CP, 9.25%), while the 35-day interval (T4) had the lowest (30.2% DM, 5.66% CP). Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was highest in T1 (78.0%) and lowest in T3 (76.8%). Gross energy ranged from 4606 to 4832 cal/g, with no significant differences. Silage pH decreased with longer harvest intervals, with T4 recording the lowest pH (4.64), indicating better fermentation. Total soluble solids (TSS) were highest in T1 (0.80 °Brix) and lowest in T4 (0.12 °Brix). Sensory evaluations showed silages harvested at 20 and 25 days (T1 and T2) were most acceptable in color, odor, and moisture. Harvesting Cogon grass at 20–25 days and supplementing with urea molasses, maize bran, and Ipil-ipil leaf meal produced high-quality silage with enhanced nutrition and fermentation, offering a sustainable feeding strategy for tropical livestock. © 2024 University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines.

AB  - The biomass production from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (family Fabaceae) is a valuable source for chemical biorefinery. The bioactive molecules from the methanol extracts (MEs) from various parts of L. leucocephala grown in Egypt were evaluated. The antibacterial activity against the growth of Erwinia amylovora, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined by the inhibition zones (IZs) and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The antifungal activity against the growth of Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, and Alternaria solani was recorded by measuring the fungal growth inhibition (FGI %) and MICs. The phytochemical compounds in the MEs were identified by HPLC–DAD, where the higher compounds identified (mg/kg ME) in seeds were benzoic acid (1520.44), myricetin (848.73), and rosmarinic acid (792.46); in roots, were benzoic acid (554.04), naringenin (419.99), and myricetin (205.51); in leaves were rosmarinic acid (4768.16), resveratrol (2983.99), quercetin (2052.43), myricetin (1432.63), and naringenin (1182.39); in branches, were rosmarinic acid (2230.26), resveratrol (1605.3), o-coumaric acid (691.16), and myricetin (681.93); in fruits were rosmarinic acid (431.43) and resveratrol (261.07); in stem-wood, were ellagic acid (1319.75), p-coumaric acid (1051.59), and ferulic acid (512.45); and in stem-bark, were resveratrol (1079.01), benzoic acid (1071.11), and catechol (305.51). The MEs at the concentration of 4000 mg/L from stem-wood, leaves, and stem-bark, the higher IZs against the growth of E. amylovora, A. tumefaciens, and S. aureus with values of 4.06 cm, 2.5 cm, and 2.63 cm, respectively, were found. The range of MICs values of MEs was 75–500 mg/L, 75–125 mg/L, and 75–125 mg/L, against the growth of A. tumefaciens, E. amylovora, and S. aureus, respectively. MEs prepared from seeds, fruits (pod), and stem-bark at 4000 mg/L showed the higher FGI (100%) against the growth of A. solani; MEs from seeds and branches observed the higher FGI values of 63.83% and 63.6%, respectively, against the growth of F. solani, and all MEs showed potent antifungal activity (FGI 100%) against R. solani except for leaf ME (88.06%). MICs were in the range of 250–500, 250–500, and 500–1000 mg/L against A. solani, F. solani, and R. solani, respectively. At 500 mg/L, the roots ME showed the highest total antioxidant activity (94.30%) compared to vitamin C (VC) (98.30%) at 100 mg/L. The EC50 values of the MEs from seeds, fruits, stem-bark, branches, stem-wood, leaves, and roots were 424.24 mg/L, 131.40 mg/L, 341.78 mg/L, 380.50 mg/L, 153.59 mg/L, 153.59 mg/L, and 129.89 mg/L compared with VC (6.88 mg/L). In conclusion, the botanical parts of L. leucocephala have several bioactive compounds, which can act as promising antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background and Aim: The inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM) in poultry feed is often limited due to its high crude fiber and mimosine content. This study investigates the potential of fermented LLM (FLM) to enhance nutrient intake, egg production, and egg quality in laying quails by reducing anti-nutritional factors through fermentation. Materials and Methods: Two hundred 42-day-old laying quails were assigned to five dietary treatments: T0 (control) = 100% basal diet (BD), T1 = 98% BD + 2% FLM, T2 = 96% BD + 4% FLM, T3 = 94% BD + 6% FLM, and T4 = 92% BD + 8% FLM. Parameters including nutrient intake (energy, protein, fat, calcium, phosphorus), feed conversion ratio (FCR), egg production, egg weight, eggshell thickness, Haugh unit, and yolk color were measured over a 28-day trial. Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance, followed by Duncan’s test for significant differences (p ≤ 0.05). Results: FLM supplementation significantly improved energy, protein, fat, calcium, and phosphorus intake while reducing FCR. At 4% FLM inclusion, significant enhancements in egg production, eggshell thickness, Haugh unit, and yolk color were observed. Conversely, fiber intake and overall feed intake remained unaffected across treatments. The highest egg production (56.43%) and best yolk color (8,95) were observed in the 8% FLM group. Conclusion: Incorporating FLM into the diets of laying quails effectively enhances nutrient utilization and improves egg production and quality without increasing feed intake. The optimal inclusion level for maximizing benefits appears to be 4-8% FLM. Copyright: Utami and Akbar.

AB  - Growth and wood traits of Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata were compared with India's most widely grown pulpwood, Eucalyptus. Three Leucaena seedlots and sixty-four Leucaena clones selected in plantations established from two Indian land races and a Hawaiian seed source were tested together with five commercial E. camaldulensis clones at two contrasting sites in southern India. At the wetter, irrigated site, the three sources of Leucaena clones had significantly greater 4-year height and similar mean stem diameter to the Eucalyptus clones, while the Leucaena seedlots were slower-growing. At the semi-arid, rainfed site, Eucalyptus grew faster and had better survival than the three sources of Leucaena clones, which again were similar in their performance and superior to the Leucaena seedlots. Basic densities, determined from breast-height wood cores, of 4-year-old Leucaena and Eucalyptus were quite similar (568 and 534 kg m-3 respectively) at the irrigated site, but at the rainfed site Eucalyptus wood density was higher (590 kg m-3), while that of Leucaena was lower (508 kg m-3). The kraft pulp yield (KPY) of Leucaena clones was about 1.5 % higher than Eucalyptus at both sites; KPYs of both species were 1.8 % lower at the rainfed than the irrigated site. Leucaena fibres were 31 % and 39 % longer and 65 % and 58 % wider than Eucalyptus, at the irrigated and rainfed sites respectively, and had lower cell wall proportions. Differences among Leucaena clones were significant for growth traits and for most wood and fibre traits, indicating the potential for selecting fast-growing Leucaena clones with improved wood properties. Clonal Leucaena plantations can serve as a productive and complementary pulpwood crop to Eucalyptus in southern India, increasing the yield and strength of blended pulps. © 2023

AB  - Shifting from chemical-intensive practices to organic-based farming within the rice-wheat rotation (RWR) is crucial for its long-term sustainability. This highly productive system holds a significant carbon (C) sequestration potential if managed efficiently. The dynamics of soil organic-C profoundly impacts the global climate change and crops’ productivity, necessitating the continuous monitoring of organic carbon to ensure soil vitality. Hence, we have evaluated the long-term (twenty-one years) impact of organic amendments on yields of the RWR, soil properties and C-dynamics. After 21 years, we observed that organic-based amendments increased the rice and wheat grain yields by 33.4–52.5% and 20–42.8%, respectively, over the control (no organics). On an average, in top 0.0–0.15 m soil layer, the organic-manured plots had 21.6%, 21.3% and 23.4% greater available nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) over the control plot, respectively. Furthermore, such organic-manured plots recorded 32.9–50.8% and 6.04–32.3% greater microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) over the control. Also, the use of organic amendments had a significant (p≤0.05) and positive impact on the soil carbon dynamics (0.0–0.45 m). In 0.0–0.45 m soil depth, the organic-manured treatments registered a 25.9–44.2% greater total organic carbon (TOC) than the control. These treatments improved the active (labile, very labile) and recalcitrant (less labile, non-labile)-C pools especially in upper soil layers. In summary, the synergistic use of Sesbania green manure, Leucaena leucocephala leaf manuring, farmyard manure, and biofertilizers (blue-green algae/Azotobacter etc.) proves effective in restoring soil health and enhancing crop productivity by increasing soil organic carbon and ensuring nutrients availability. Thus, these organic amendment treatments can be advocated to farmers to sustain the productivity of the rice-wheat ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To determine whether Multipurpose Tree (MPT) species are suitable as a source of nutrients for growing crops, residual leaf material needs to be analyzed for its decomposition rate and patterns. A detailed study of the nutrients released in soil by the amendment of decomposing leaf litter of Leucaena leucocephala and its influence on rhizosphere mycoflora, fertility, and yield parameters of the plant was conducted. The effect of leaf litter amendment on soil in terms of soil structure was assessed by analyzing soil for its pH, nutrient content, and organic matter at different stages of crop growth. Increased soil fertility in agricultural production was estimated by various growth and yield characteristics of Trigonella foenum-graecum. The estimation of rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere fungus populations both from amended and control soils were made and the readings were expressed as percent frequency of occurrence. The amendment of soil with litter resulted in an increase in the number of fungi (18,000/g soil) as compared to the control soil (7200/g soil). The addition of the organic mulch favored the mycorrhizal colonization of roots. At 90 days of plant growth, the percent colonization was more than two times of those growing in control soil and 90% of roots showed colonization with mycorrhiza. By amending the soil with litter, both organic carbon and organic matter increased. The highest amount of phosphorus observed in the soil of the control plot (32.27 mg/g) was still lesser than the highest amount of phosphorus observed in the experimental plot (38.79 mg/g). Compared to control soil, amended soil had higher yields. Thus, Leucaena leucocephala, widely used for reforestation in semi-arid and arid regions, contributes significantly to the soil's fertility through its fallen and decomposing leaves. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Society for Plant Research 2023.

AB  - In Benin, livestock breeders frequently use medicinal plants to treat gastrointestinal diseases in small ruminants. The aim of this review is to list the plants traditionally used in this context and to present the scientific findings on the efficacy of these plants. An extensive search was carried out using PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Biomed Central and Google Scholar databases to collect data, with combinations of relevant french and english keywords such as “ethnobotanical survey”, “anthelmintic properties”, “medicinal plants”, “gastrointestinal parasites”, “digestive strongyles”, “Haemonchus”, “Trichostrongylus”, “small ruminants”, “sheep”, “goats” and “Benin”. A total of 45 published articles met the eligibility criteria. This review listed 123 plants used by breeders to treat gastrointestinal ailments in small ruminants. The most commonly used parts are leaves and barks, and the most common forms are decoction, maceration and powder. Scientific studies have demonstrated the anthelmintic properties of 18 plants, including Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides, Newbouldia laevis, Mitragyna inermis and Combretum glutinosum. The powders or leaf extracts of these plants showed in vivo significant reductions of over 50% in egg excretion, larval establishment, viability and fertility of gastrointestinal strongyles in small ruminants. Extracts of these plants also revealed in vitro inhibitory activity of over 50% on egg hatching, larval migration and motility of gastrointestinal strongyles. This manuscript highlights the traditional use of anthelmintic plants in small ruminants in Benin and provides scientific results supporting the efficacy of these plants. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biological invasions are complex scale-dependent processes. Metacommunity ecology provides the means to understand the effects of invasive species (IS) because it explicitly considers how local and regional processes interact to drive the three main components of biodiversity: alpha, beta, and gamma. White-popinac (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) is a widely distributed IS in regenerating forests in the Atlantic Forest (Brazil). White-popinac establishment results in a particular spatial occupancy as the species forms dense and homogeneous patches, instead of spreading individuals throughout invaded areas. Here we took advantage of this unique spatial configuration formed by fragments of native forest and their respective regenerating areas, partially occupied by patches of white-popinac, to investigate how local and regional dynamics of plant metacommunities and communities under natural regeneration are affected by white-popinac. We conducted replicated multi-strata surveys in 131 communities distributed among 29 metacommunities of regenerating forests that had different ages of white-popinac invasion. We found (i) Mirrored responses among local and regional scales: at both scales, native species richness decreased with the increase of invasion age, whereas IS richness increased; and (ii) β-diversity of native species decreased with the increase of invasion age, showing that time-advance of invasion led to a homogenizing effect. We also found evidence that the advance of white-popinac patches towards regenerating forests increases with time and proximity to the forest fragment, which likely had indirect effects on regenerating communities by reducing the size of the regenerating area. Our results indicate that the effects of white-popinac invasions on regenerating forests can be so vigorous that they propagate from the local to the regional scale, via a decrease in β-diversity. We reinforce the importance of considering multiscale approaches on assessing effects of white-popinac invasions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of Leucaena leaves (Leucaena laucochepala) supplementation on the digestibility of Ettawa Crossbred goats. Twelve Ettawa Crossbred goats during the lactation period divided into six groups were allocated in a group randomized design with two treatments and six replicates (two goats per replicate). Treatments consisted of T1 in the form of 100% Leucaena leaves and T2 in the form of 50% Leucaena leaves and 50% concentrate. This study began with the preliminary stage, adaptation stage, data collection and analysis. Data from this study were tabulated using Microsoft Excel program, then analyzed using double T-test analysis with Randomized Group Design. The results showed that the Crude Fiber Digestibility value had a significantly different effect (P<0.05), Leucaena leaves high Crude Protein content can affect digestibility to be higher than T1 which is composed of 50% Leucaena leaves + 50% concentrate. ADF digestibility value showed no significant difference (P>0.05). NDF digestibility showed no significant difference (P>0.05). Hemicellulose digestibility showed no significant difference (P>0.05). The digestibility of organic matter showed no significant difference (P<0.05). Dry matter digestibility showed significantly different effects (P<0.05). The digestibility value of crude protein showed a significantly different effect (P<0.05). The results of the study can be concluded that Leucaena leaves supplementation can increase the feed digestibility value. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - The utilization of chemically derived herbicides has caused many negative impacts, it is essential to investigate some biosynthetic products, being an alternative for inhibiting weeds. The inhibition of Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit. extract on plant germination and growth is reported. Many components belonging to the allelochemical group were found in distinctive parts’ extract of L. leucocephala, mostly detected in leaves with flavonoid 292.7 mg QE/g extract and phenolic 397.6 mg GA/g extract. The findings proved that the extract inhibited the plant germination and growth in various test concentrations, being the highest point at the concentration of 20 mg/mL extract. In this condition, the inhibitory effects regarding each parameter were 70% (seed germination), 91.46% (root length), 69.89% (stem length), 78.73% (fresh weight), and 49.53% (dry weight). Furthermore, this study also revealed the inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) of the extract on germination, starting the inhibition at 17.40 mg/mL. The content of photosynthetic pigments and water uptake decreased gradually after 7-day treatment, suggesting that the ethanol extract from L. leucocephala influenced these biological processes which directly caused the plant growth inhibition. © 2024 Association of Agricultural Technology in Southeast Asia.

AB  - The Grey Francolin, a Phasianidae species native to India and Pakistan, was introduced to Reunion Island in the XVIIIth century for hunting. One of its populations resides in the Rivière des Pluies riverbed, in the island's north, a secondary vegetation area surrounded by an industrial zone. The study aimed to determine the minimum daily movements, home range size, and macro-habitat use of individuals during the breeding season, as well as the species used for roosting at night. Six individuals from four different pairs were fitted with GPS. Home ranges ranged from 2.4 to 5.8 ha (MCP 100) and from 2.1 to 8.3 ha (Kernel 95), with averages of 4.5 ± 1.2 (MCP 100) and 5.0 ± 3.0 (Kernel 95). Minimum daily movements varied from 252 to 513 m, averaging 402 ± 147 m per day. GPS points were found in three macro-habitats: wooded areas with Pithecellobium dulce and Leucaena leucocephala (62%), pebble riverbed (23%), herbaceous vegetation (13%), but never in the urban zone. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The use of manure, organic mulch, and legume-based fertilizers can increase soil fertility in semiarid regions. However, the effects of such practices on soils prone to desertification are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate soil fertility and herbaceous stratum yield on soils amended with different organic inputs in the desertification hotspot of Irauçuba, Ceará state, Brazil. The experiments were performed in two areas with different soils (Planosol and Cambisol), in randomized blocks with a 2 × 2 × 3 + 1 factorial design. The factors consisted of (i) mulch (presence or absence of Copernicia prunifera [carnauba palm] straw), (ii) manure (sheep or cattle), and (iii) legume-based fertilizer (Mimosa tenuiflora [jurema], Mimosa caesalpiniifolia [sabiá], and Leucaena leucocephala [leucena]), in addition to an untreated control, with three replicates. Soil chemical attributes and herbaceous stratum yield were assessed in the two areas. Positive effects of the combined use of carnauba palm straw, manures, and legume-based fertilizers on soil fertility were more evident for Planosol than for Cambisol. The combination of sheep manure with sabiá-based fertilizer in Planosol, and cattle manure and leucena-based fertilizer in Cambisol increased herbaceous stratum yield. Herbaceous stratum yield in Planosol is more responsive to the input of great amounts of soil nutrients (especially P) and it increases soil organic matter levels, while in Cambisol, herbaceous stratum yield is more associated with the ability of inputs to make nutrients readily available. The use of organic amendments can reverse, in the short-term, degradation and desertification processes of soils in the Brazilian semiarid region. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Identifying the carbon–water relationship of plants helps to understand their adaptive water use strategies. The relationship between WUE and the water source remains uncertain in the hot-dry valleys with reservoirs. The leaf δ13C and soil and xylem water isotopes (δ2H and δ18O) were determined to identify the WUE and water source contributions, respectively, in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit communities. We propose a source contributing score (SCS), calculated as a value for the contribution of water from different soil layers (a higher SCS value indicates plants use deeper water sources). The positive relationship between leaf δ13C and SCS (R2 = 0.16, P = 0.022) and the negative relationship between leaf δ13C and topsoil contribution (R2 = 0.21, P = 0.009) confirmed the close association of larger WUE with less reliance on shallow soil water. The redundancy analysis suggested a stronger connection between leaf δ13C and d-excess than leaf δ13C and topsoil moisture content, which emphasized the key role of soil moisture d-excess. Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) suggested soil properties and microclimate explain more than 89.8 % of the variations in tree water use. VPA also suggested different roles of microclimate and soil properties in explaining tree water use strategies. Findings broadened the understanding of the relationship between WUE and water sources and emphasized the key role of soil moisture d-excess in hot-dry valleys with reservoirs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this work was to develop a liver tissue function index during the transition period of dairy cows managed in low-tropic conditions. In two farms, twenty crossbred and synthetic native cows during the peripartum period were selected, and blood samples were taken on days −30 and −15 prepartum, the calving day, and 7, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80 and 105 days postpartum for serum metabolic tests. On each measurement day, body condition scores (BCS) and parameters on nitrogen metabolism (total protein—TP, albumin—ALB, globulin—GLOB, urea), adipose tissue metabolism (cholesterol—COL, non-esterified fatty acids—NEFA) and two transaminases (alanine aminotransferase—ALT and aspartate aminotransferase—AST) were evaluated. Data analysis included the Spearman correlation, principal components, multiple linear regression and cluster analysis. Results showed that regarding the days after calving and BCS, a liver tissue function index can be constructed using the TP, urea, COL, ALT and NEFA. The estimated index generated three groupings, both by days after calving and BCS. In the former, the index discriminated the metabolic behavior in the prepartum, parturition and postpartum periods, while in the latter, the index discriminated between extreme (2.25, 2.50 and 4.25), slightly low (2.75 and 3.0) and slightly high (3.25 to 4) conditions. The results allow us to conclude that it is feasible to construct mathematical function indexes for liver function to monitor metabolic changes during highly demanding productive phases in dairy cows under tropical conditions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Rubberwood sawdust is one of the most common materials used as mushroom material in Malaysia, one of the South East Asia countries and its depletion is becoming one of the challenges in mushroom cultivation. A quest for alternative resources was rigorously conducted by using various biomass such as paddy straw, spent mushroom compost, paper boxes, and river tamarind wood (Leucaena leucocephala). A conventional determination method for alternative materials amount is based on yield analysis at different mixing compositions. This method took too much time for investment and experiment with. Thus, the goal of this study is to find out the effectiveness of using the Pearson Square method for mushroom material preparation with the desired nutrient level based on calculation. To begin, the carbon and nitrogen content of all materials used was determined by dry combustion and the Kjeldahl method respectively. Next, the desired carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C: N) was formulated based on the C: N of the conventional formulation that consists of rubberwood sawdust, rice bran and calcium carbonate (limestone) at 100:10:1 ratio which acts as a reference. Four different material combinations with similar C: N were calculated by the Pearson Square method and prepared. These combinations including control were inoculated by the spawn of grey oyster mushroom (Pleurotus pulmonarius). Parameters of spawn running rate, height of stipe, diameter of pileus and biological efficiency (BE) were measured and analyzed. The mushroom yield obtained shows that there is no significant difference between the material combinations according to standard deviation and one-way ANOVA, indicating all material combinations have similar nutrient content and the application of the Pearson Square method is verified. In summary, the Pearson Square method was proven can be applied in preparing mushroom material from different resources with the desired nutrient level. © 2025 Author(s).

AB  - Cities are the primary distribution areas of most invasive plant species and the important starting point of invasion for many invasive plant species. As one of the important issues in urban ecosystems, the composition of urban invasive plant species and their impacts on plant diversity have received increasing attention. With the built-up area of Shenzhen as a case study, we analyzed the species composition of urban invasive plants and their impact on plant diversity using data from 600 urban plant plots (100 m × 100 m). A total of 214 invasive plant species in 55 families and 153 genera were investigated, with herbaceous plants as the leading life type. Tree species Leucaena leucocephala, shrub species Lantana camara and Mimosa bimucronata, and herb species Mimosa bimucronata, Mimosa bimucronata, and Mikania micrantha were the most widespread invasive species. For herb quadrats with different invasive levels, Simpson dominance index, Shannon diversity index, Margalef richness index, and Pielou evenness index all exhibited the same order as severe invasion < moderate invasion < mild invasion. This study revealed the significant effect of mild invasion on urban herb diversity and the evident pattern of herb diversity decreasing trend with increasing invasion level. Our results and methods provide a reference for studying urban invasive plants and preventing urban alien plant invasions. © 2024 Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.

AB  - Invasive species threaten crops and ecosystems worldwide. Therefore, we sought to understand the relationship between the geographic distribution of species populations and the characteristics of seeds using new techniques such as seed image analysis, multivariate analysis, and machine learning. This study aimed to characterize Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. seeds from spatially dispersed populations using digital images and analyzed their implications for genetic studies. Seed size and shape descriptors were obtained using image analysis of the five populations. Several analyses were performed including descriptive statistics, principal components, Euclidean distance, Mantel correlation test, and supervised machine learning. This image analysis technique proved to be efficient in detecting biometric differences in L. leucocephala seeds from spatially dispersed populations. This method revealed that spatially dispersed L. leucocephala populations had different biometric seed patterns that can be used in studies of population genetic divergence. We observed that it is possible to identify the origin of the seeds from the biometric characters with 80.4% accuracy (Kappa statistic 0.755) when we applied the decision tree algorithm. Digital imaging analysis associated with machine learning is promising for discriminating forest tree populations, supporting management activities, and studying population genetic divergence. This technique contributes to the understanding of genotype-environment interactions and consequently identifies the ability of an invasive species to spread in a new area, making it possible to track and monitor the flow of seeds between populations and other sites. © 2024, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - Wild edible trees (WETs) play an important role in the diet of many rural communities. Therefore, research on their use and management is important to support both food sovereignty and local conservation of biocultural resources. We evaluated the different uses of WETs by the community of Zacualpan, Colima, in western Mexico, through 32 semi-structured interviews registering the species richness, plant parts consumed, and non-food uses. Additional information was collected on their management, availability, and forms of preparation. We used a cultural salience index to determine the food importance of the WETs mentioned. We registered 33 edible tree species (26 wild, 3 native crops, and 4 exotic crops) that were most commonly consumed as fruits or seeds. WETs were also used for fuel, live fences, timber, handicrafts, medicine, shade, fodder, poles, utensils, construction, tanning, soap, and paper. Pithecellobium dulce had the highest food salience, followed by Spondias purpurea, Leucaena esculenta, Leucaena leucocephala, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Jacaratia mexicana. Salient wild trees were collected in the wild and promoted in agroforestry systems. These trees provided food during the dry season and also had the highest number of additional uses. Promoting the biocultural value of WETs and their sustainable use can favor ecosystem conservation and local food sovereignty. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The productivity of goats in small-scale farming is largely influenced by the availability and affordability of high-quality forages all year round. Grasses commonly used for pastures in tropical regions tend to have low protein levels, which may not be sufficient for optimal production in ruminant animals. Despite potential concerns such as anti-nutritional elements and toxins, the addition of legumes to goat diets could be a beneficial way to address nutritional deficiencies in the diet of goats. This review discussed the beneficial impact of some legumes supplementation (Gliricidia sepium, Sesbania grandiflora, and Leucaena leucocephala) on nutrient intake, digestibility, growth and reproductive performance of goats. Studies have shown that G. sepium supplementation can improve nutrient intake, nutrient digestibility, N retention, and body weight of goats. S. grandiflora supplementation had a beneficial impact on nutrient intake and digestibility, semen quality, and body weight. L. leucocephala supplementation to the goat diets have been reported to improve production of volatile fatty acid and urinary purine derivatives, growth performance, dressing percentage, and overall yield of kid per animal, as well as reduce the incidence of abortion. This suggests that supplementation with high-quality foliage is very beneficial to increase nutrient intake, digestibility, growth and reproductive performance of goats fed low quality grass. © 2011-2025 Journal of Advanced Veterinary Research.

AB  - L-Mimosine is the main active component of the plant Leucaena leucocephala. Due to its metal-chelating mechanism, it interacts with various metabolic pathways in living organisms, making it a potential pharmacological target, although it also leads to toxicity. The present study aimed to investigate the transplacental passage of L-mimosine and its effects on embryofetal development. Pregnant Wistar rats were divided into control groups (CO2; n = 8 or CO3; n = 6, according to experimental design 2 or 3) that received only the vehicle, and groups that received doses of 60 (n = 9), 100 (n = 8), 140 (n = 9), and 240 (n = 7) mg/kg of L-mimosine from gestational day (GD) 6–19. For the transplacental analysis, five rats were used: two as controls and three treated with a dose of 140 mg/kg L-mimosine from GD12 to 14. All the animals received food and water ad libitum. The parameters analyzed were body weight gain; water and food consumption; serum biochemistry; blood cell counts; reproductive indices; and histopathological, visceral and skeletal analyses of the fetuses. In the groups that received doses of 60, 100, and 140 mg/kg, alterations (P < 0.05) in the skeletal development of the fetuses were observed. In the 240 mg/kg group, a decrease (P < 0.05) in total food consumption; a decrease (P < 0.05) in absolute leukocyte and neutrophil counts; alterations (P < 0.05) in the levels of ALT, GGT, and creatinine enzymes; a decrease (P < 0.05) in the relative weight of the thymus along with a loss of the corticomedullary distinction; coalescence of lymphoid follicles in the spleen; and skeletal and visceral alterations and alopecia were observed. L-Mimosine was detected in the amniotic fluid of the rats. These results demonstrate the complex action of L-mimosine, leading to toxic effects on both dams and fetuses, highlighting the risk of exposure to this substance during the perinatal period, which negatively impacts embryo/fetal and neonatal growth and development. © 2024

AB  - Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) conventionally involve highly concentrated sulphuric acid, which typically resulted in the formation of undesirable by-products. Although less corrosive mineral acids have been explored as alternatives, high concentrations are still required. In this study, CNC was successfully isolated from Leucaena leucocephala wood using mild sulphuric acid with acetic acid as protic solvent, and it was further studied with the addition of Lewis acids in the form of multivalent transition metal salts as co-catalyst. Selected divalent and trivalent transition metal salts including (Cr(NO3)3, Fe(NO3)3, Co(NO3)2, and Ni(NO3)2) were investigated. The morphology, chemical structure, particle size, and physicochemical properties of the CNCs were determined. Controlled depolymerization of cellulose was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Rod-like morphology for all CNCs was obtained during the hydrolysis process with the smallest CNC particles found at an average length of 278.1 ± 35.1 nm and a diameter of 13.4 ± 3.0 nm. The results showed that higher valence state metal ions resulted in better cellulose hydrolysis efficiency. In addition, the use of transition metal salt as a co-catalyst improved production efficiency and minimised carbonization of CNC while maintaining desired crystallinity and thermal properties. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Alien species pose a potential threat to biodiversity, necessitating vigilant monitoring to inform effective control strategies and prevent their invasiveness. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of alien species on the richness, horizontal structure, and diversity of the tree–shrub layer within a Cerrado-Pantanal transition region fragment. A floristic census was conducted across a fragment of approximately 3.0 ha, measuring all individuals with an aboveground diameter (DAG) ≥ 5.0 cm. The study assessed the statistical significance of diversity variation in the presence and absence of alien species using the Hutcheson t-test and examined the correlation between the proportion of alien species and various community parameters through Pearson’s correlation. The findings revealed a total of 84 species belonging to 34 families, with a total of 2218 recorded individuals. Notably, eight species (9.52%) were identified as alien, distributed across five families. Among the alien species, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit exhibited the highest importance value. However, the analysis indicated that the presence of alien species did not yield a significant variation in diversity, as demonstrated by the applied test with a 5.0% probability level, at both the plot and community levels. Moreover, the correlation analysis indicated that the community variables exhibited a low association with the proportion of individuals belonging to alien species. Specifically, the correlation decreased in the following order: Shannon–Weaver Diversity Index, density of native species, basal area of native species, and richness of native species. The observed low correlation coefficients (r) and nonsignificant p-values (p < 0.05) suggested that the presence of alien species did not exert a significant influence on the richness, structure, and diversity of the tree–shrub layer within the studied fragment. This outcome was likely facilitated by the absence of dominant populations of alien species. Thus, the study concludes that, at least within this specific context, alien species do not exert a significant influence on the assessed community parameters. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Botanical Society of Sao Paulo 2024.

The research compares the biomass yield and economic feasibility of growing Leucaena as a sole crop versus intercropping it with Para rubber trees. Sole cropping Leucaena produces higher biomass yields and is more economically viable. The wood stem of Leucaena is competitive with other biomass fuels used in local power plants, while its leaves, with over 14 % protein content, meet local animal feed market standards. Additionally, branches, which constitute 15.15 %–30.58 % of the total biomass, are usually left as residue but can be used for hydrochar production. The study examines the effects of temperature (235 °C and 265 °C) and retention time (1, 2, and 3 h) on hydrochar properties. Optimal condition (265 °C for 1 h) produces hydrochar with high heating value and energy yield. Using these branches for hydrochar can significantly boost total revenue, with hydrochar contributing 54.9 % to overall revenue (4522.00 USD/ha). Integrating Leucaena cultivation with hydrothermal carbonization offers a sustainable solution, enhancing revenue, supporting local energy and feed needs, and promoting environmental sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala L.) is a leguminous species often referred to as the “miracle tree,” it provides numerous ecosystem services and exhibits robust ecological characteristics. However, the infection caused by phytopathogenic fungi is poorly understood in Subabul. Therefore, this study provides comprehensive insights into the molecular and genomic characteristics of Fusarium falciforme, the causal agent of wilt disease in Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala). Pathogen isolation from infected samples, followed by morpho-molecular characterization through DNA sequencing of key markers (ITS, LSU, TEF1α) and phylogenetic analysis, confirmed the identity of F. falciforme. Host range analysis demonstrated the pathogen's ability to infect additional leguminous crops, including chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and soybean (Glycine max). A complete genome assembly revealed a genome size of 59.19 Mb, comprising 18,853 protein-coding genes. Comparative genomic analysis elucidated evolutionary relationships with other Fusarium species, while functional annotation identified critical virulence factors, such as polyketide synthases, ABC transporters, and secretory proteins, which facilitate host tissue invasion. These findings enhance the understanding of F. falciforme pathogenicity, enabling improved diagnostic tools and management strategies for controlling wilt disease in Subabul and related legumes. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In a preliminary in vitro study, leaves of Acacia nilotica, Prosopis juliflora, Cajanus cajan, Leucaena leucocephala and seed kernel of Mangifera indica were identified as potential candidates in mitigating ruminal methane (CH4) production. The objective of the current study was to investigate the combination efficiency of these unconventional feeds with concentrate mix (CM) or Chloris gayana grass in CH4 reduction. Two feed combinations in different proportions were incubated in vitro with buffered rumen fluid at Hohenheim Gas test. In combination 1, C. gayana and CM were included as basal substrates, while in combination 2, A. nilotica, P. juliflora, C. cajan, L. leucocephala or M. indica seed kernel were included as CH4 reducing supplements at different proportions. The CH4 reducing potentials of feed combinations were presented as the ratio of CH4 to net gas production and expressed as percentage (pCH4). The pCH4 for CM and C. gayana was 16.7% and 16.9%, respectively, while it ranged from 3.18% in A. nilotica to 13.1% in C. cajan. The pCH4 was reduced (p < 0.05) from 14.6% to 9.39% when A. nilotica was combined with CM. In combination of L. leucocephala or C. cajan with CM, the pCH4 (p < 0.05) was reduced from 16.5% and 16.6% with the lowest proportion to 15.1% and 15.2% with the highest inclusion rate respectively. The combination of C. gayana with L. leucocephala or C. cajan reduced (p < 0.05) the pCH4 from 16.3% and 16.4% to 15.1% and 14.9% respectively. The pCH4 was reduced (p < 0.05) from 13.4% to 7.60% when A. nilotica was combined with C. gayana. Estimated digestible organic matter (dOM) and metabolizable energy (ME) increased (p < 0.05) with increasing proportions of M. indica seed kernel with CM or C. gayana. In conclusion, the combination of the basal substrates with unconventional supplements resulted in CH4 reduction without affecting the dOM and ME at lower inclusion rates. Animal-based experiments await to validate in vitro findings. © 2024 The Author(s). Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Cultivation of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) is a viable option for sustaining the increasing demand for herbal medicines but also for preventing the genetic erosion of MAPs in natural habitats. The increasing demand is an opportunity to encourage the cultivation of MAPs. Since, agroforestry is one of the most potential ways for the cultivation of MAPs. And there have been sporadic reports on the impact of MAPs cultivated in agroforestry. Thus, our main objectives were to uncover the status of MAPs and their cultivation via. agroforestry systems in India and also to highlight the impact on yield-related attributes and phytochemical properties of MAPs when cultivated in agroforestry systems. Despite the studies so far, there is need to comprehend the variation in the yield and chemical constituent of the MAPs grown under agroforestry. It is often reiterated that institutionalised efforts can upscale MAPs cultivation and thus we have attempted to examine the implication of government and institutional imperatives in MAPs cultivation in India. Finally, we have indicated the way forward for MAPs cultivation under agroforestry. © 2024, Indian journals. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hot arid zones represent vital reservoirs of unique species and ecosystems, holding significant importance for biodiversity. This study aimed to explore the plant diversity associated with tree plantations in urban ecosystems under hyper-arid climatic conditions in the Sahara Desert of Algeria. In May 2022, 30 quadrats measuring 1 m2 each were established at the base of Phoenix dactylifera, Leucaena leucocephala, and Tamarix aphylla, corresponding to the dominant tree species in each of three plantations. In each quadrat, the plant quantitative inventory was conducted to measure plant diversity and similarity among the studied plantations. Based on this, we assessed the plant functional traits and rarity/abundance status of the flora. The findings revealed a diverse flora associated with the studied plantations, comprising 29 plant species grouped into 27 genera and 12 families. Notably, Poaceae (accounting for 30.8% of the flora), Asteraceae (25.0%), and Zygophyllaceae (21.6%) were well-represented. With an overall density of approximately 555 individuals/m2, Zygophyllum album (120 individuals/m2) and Polypogon monspeliensis (87 individuals/m2) emerged as the most abundant species. Functional trait analysis underscored the pivotal role of therophytes (constituting over 50.0% of the flora) and anemochorous species (33.0%–62.5%). Phytogeographic analysis emphasized the prevalence of the Saharo-Arabic element (constituting over 31.0% of the flora) and the Mediterranean Saharo-Arabic element (9.5%–21.5%). The Cosmopolitan element thrived under disturbance factors, recording percentages from 13.0% to 20.0% of the plant community. The rarity/abundance status of the flora emphasized the significance of rare, common, and very common species in the studied plantations. These findings could provide fundamental data for the effective control and management of biodiversity in hot hyper-arid urban ecosystems. © Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Afforestation is an effective approach for restoring degraded ecological functions in the dry-hot valleys of southwest China. Afforestation can affect soil carbon and nitrogen storage; however, how it affects soil P fractions, and their driving factors. is poorly understood in this region. To address these questions, we conducted a field study of Leucaena leucocephala plantations at three different stand age sites (3, 10, and 20 years) and an adjacent natural shrub-grass community control site to investigate changes in soil total phosphorus (Pt), Pi (inorganic phosphorus), Po (organic phosphorus), and phosphorus (P) fractions and their driving factors. Soil Pt, Po, labile P, and moderately labile P significantly increased in the Leucaena leucocephala plantation compared with the natural shrub grass site, and the Leucaena leucocephala plantation increased soil Pt content by significantly increasing soil Po. Soil Pt, Po, Pi, labile P, moderately labile P and non-labile P were not significantly different among the different stages of the Leucaena leucocephala plantation, and soil Pt and its fractions were all significantly higher in the middle-age forest stage of the Leucaena leucocephala plantation. These results indicate that Leucaena leucocephala plantations increased the soil P transformation ability, and soil Po played a critical role in sustaining soil P availability. The middle-age forest stage of Leucaena leucocephala plantations had the best conditions for P stocks and P conversion capacity. The abundance of actinomycetes and fungi showed significant positive relationships with soil Pi fractions (NaHCO3-Pi, NaOH-Pi, and NaOHu.s.-Pi); soil Pt and moderately labile P were significantly and directly influenced by fungal abundance. Soil organic carbon (SOC), NH4+-N, and NO3−-N showed significant and positive relationships with the soil Pi fractions (NaHCO3-Pi, NaHCO3-Po, and HCl-Po). SOC and NO3−-N were the key drivers of soil Pt, labile P, moderately labile P and non-labile fractions. These results indicate that abiotic and biotic factors differently affected the soil P fractions and Pt in Leucaena leucocephala plantations in the dry-hot valley. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Serpentine soils are characterized by high concentrations of heavy metals (HMs) and limited essential nutrients with remarkable endemic plant diversity, yet the mechanisms enabling plant adaptation to thrive in such harsh environments remain largely unknown. Full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, coupled with physiological and functional assays, was used to explore root-associated bacterial community composition and their metabolic and ecological functions. The results revealed that serpentine plant species exhibited significantly higher metal transfer factor values compared to non-serpentine plant species, particularly evident in Bidens pilosa, Miscanthus floridulus, and Leucaena leucocephala. The serpentine root-associated microbes showed a higher utilization of carboxylic acid, whereas carbohydrate utilization was higher in the non-serpentine site. Zymomonas mobilis and Flavabacterium sp. exhibited high resistance to heavy metal concentrations, showing greater adaptability, while, Staphylococcus carnosus showed sensitivity to HMs, showing limited adaptability. Moreover, Ni, Cr, and Co resistance genes were found, while nitrogen and phosphorous metabolism genes were less abundant in the serpentine site compared to the non-serpentine site. Furthermore, Flavobacterium sp. had a strong positive relationship with Cd and Cu, Zymomonas mobilis with Ni, and Cr, Streptomyces sp. with Co, and Staphylococcus carnosus with N and P cycling. These findings underscore critical role of root-associated bacterial communities and distinctive soil conditions of serpentine habitats in fostering ecological adaptation of native plant species to the challenges posed by HMs and nutrient deficiencies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Different cattle production interventions have been proposed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase animal productivity, but few studies have identified their real potential under grazing conditions and at the whole system level. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of silvopastoral systems (SPS) with Leucaena leucocephala on total GHG emissions, emission intensity, GHG balance and cattle productivity in a series of production scenarios in northern Colombia. A life cycle analysis (LCA) approach was used to evaluate one baseline system (BL) based on pastures and four SPS intervention scenarios. For this analysis, the emissions from enteric fermentation and manure were determined in situ. Methane emissions from enteric fermentation were 9.7% lower in the SPS with leucaena than in BL systems (p = 0.0369). Emission factors for manure were higher in the BL systems (p < 0.05) as were emission intensities to produce one kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) and one kg of live weight gain (LWG). For animal production and GHG balance, it was found that the inclusion of leucaena increased animal production up to four times compared to the BL system and mitigated GHG emissions per hectare up to 86% due to carbon sequestration. In conclusion, leucaena SPSs are an alternative to mitigate climate change under grazing conditions, as they reduce GHG emissions and increase animal productivity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Transformation of some oxygenated compounds in bio-oil derived from biomass pyrolysis via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) generally improves its quality and potentially produces bio-based chemicals. Although alumina (Al₂O₃) supported catalysts are normally applied for HDO, they have certain limitations, such as acidity and high susceptibility to water, which need to be improved. In this research, an Al2O3-incorporated zirconia (ZrO2) composite (AZ) was prepared as a support of nickel (Ni)-molybdenum (Mo) catalysts used for HDO of guaiacol (GUA) and real bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala trunks to produce phenols. In the absence of water, the NiMo catalyst supported on AZ at 1/1 Al2O3/ZrO2 molar ratio [NiMo/AZ(1/1)] having higher reducibility with a greater number of weak-medium acid sites provided >98% GUA conversion with 87% selectivity to phenols. In the presence of water, the NiMo/AZ(1/1) catalyst maintained its catalytic activity, whereas NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst showed its deactivation to obtain the lowering GUA conversion (27.1% reduction). The FESEM and 27Al-NMR analyses revealed that the addition of ZrO2 improved the water tolerance of the catalyst by protecting the Al2O3 structure and preventing the transformation of Lewis acid-related tetrahedral Al to octahedral Al. Moreover, the NiMo/AZ(1/1) catalyst exhibited the highest HDO activity for real bio-oil without solvents, achieving a maximum oil yield of 25.2 wt% with 75.6% selectivity to phenols and the lowest coke formation. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The coffee berry borer (CBB), a primary pest in Indonesia, causes significant damage to coffee fruits and beans, necessitating effective control measures. This study evaluated the efficacy of a synthetic bioethanol-methanol mixture trap for capturing beetles and mitigating their impact. The experiment was conducted in two plots: Plot A, with a Leucaena leucocephala shade density of 19.5%, and Plot B, with a shade density of 13.5%. The attractant mixture used in the traps was prepared in a 1:2 ratio of bioethanol to methanol. Attractant traps were hung on coffee trees at a height of 1.2 to 1.5 meters above the ground, and beetle populations were collected weekly over a nine-week period. Damage to coffee fruits and seeds was assessed in the first, fourth, and eighth weeks. The extent of seed damage was categorized into two groups: ≤50% damage and >50% damage. Plot A, with denser shade, exhibited a significantly higher beetle capture rate of 83.26%, compared to 16.74% in Plot B. Beetle population dynamics fluctuated, peaking during the sixth week of trapping and declining thereafter until the ninth week. The higher shade density and denser coffee canopy in Plot A were associated with an increased beetle population. The use of the bioethanol-methanol attractant traps significantly reduced seed damage in both damage categories (≤50% and >50%). The results demonstrate that the bioethanol-methanol mixture is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling CBB populations, thereby minimizing fruit and seed damage. © 2024 EScience Press.

AB  - Some problems in producing good quality clove seeds were the seed's slow growth and the absence of technology to accelerate its growth. Therefore, we performed the research to get one natural Plant Growth Regulator and its concentration potential to enhance clove seed growth. The study was arranged in a completely randomized design, with two factors and four replications. The first factor was five kinds of natural plant growth regulators (PGRs): (1) Leucaena leucocephala leaf extract (auxin source) + coconut water (Cytokinin), (2) Leucaena leucocephala seedling extract (auxin source) + coconut water, (3) gliricidia shoot extract + coconut water and (4) sprouted onion bulb extract (Eleutherine bulbosa) + coconut water. The second factor was the concentration of PGRs: (1) control (no PGRs), (2) 2.5 ml l−1, (3) 5.0 ml l−1, (4) 10 ml l−1, and (5) 20 ml l−1. Parameters observed were plant growth (plant height, leaf number, leaf length, leaf width, and stem diameter), the chlorophyll content of leaves, and the auxin and cytokinin content of each extract. Clove seedlings' growth was observed until four months old. PGRs from the extract of sprouted onion (Eleutherine bulbosa) and Gliricidia shoots could be developed due to their high auxin content, which can boost clove seed growth at the concentration of 10 ml l−1. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India 2024.

AB  - Alpha-cellulose, a unique, natural, and essential polymer for the fiber industry, was isolated in an ecofriendly manner using eleven novel systems comprising recycling, defibrillation, and delignification of prosenchyma cells (vessels and fibers) of ten lignocellulosic resources. Seven hardwood species were selected, namely Conocorpus erectus, Leucaena leucocephala, Simmondsia chinensis, Azadirachta indica, Moringa perigrina, Calotropis procera, and Ceiba pentandra. Moreover, three recycled cellulosic wastes were chosen due to their high levels of accumulation annually in the fibrous wastes of Saudi Arabia, namely recycled writing papers (RWPs), recycled newspapers (RNPs), and recycled cardboard (RC). Each of the parent samples and the resultant alpha-cellulose was characterized physically, chemically, and anatomically. The properties examined differed significantly among the ten resources studied, and their mean values lies within the cited ranges. Among the seven tree species, L. leucocephala was the best cellulosic precursor due to its higher fiber yield (55.46%) and holocellulose content (70.82%) with the lowest content of Klasson lignin (18.86%). Moreover, RWP was the best α-cellulose precursor, exhibiting the highest holocellulose (87%) and the lowest lignin (2%) content. Despite the high content of ash and other additives accompanied with the three lignocellulosic wastes that were added upon fabrication to enhance their quality (10%, 11%, and 14.52% for RWP, RNP, and RC, respectively), they can be considered as an inexhaustible treasure source for cellulose production due to the ease and efficiency of discarding their ash minerals using the novel CaCO3-elimination process along with the other innovative techniques. Besides its main role for adjusting the pH of the delignification process, citric acid serves as an effective and environmentally friendly additive enhancing lignin breakdown while preserving cellulose integrity. Comparing the thermal behavior of the ten cellulosic resources, C. procera and C. pentandra exhibited the highest moisture content and void volume as well as having the lowest specific gravity, crystallinity index, and holocellulose content and were found to yield the highest mass loss during their thermal degradation based on thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis in an inert atmosphere. However, the other resources used were found to yield lower mass losses. The obtained results indicate that using the innovative procedures of recycling, defibrillation, and delignification did not alter or distort either the yield or structure of the isolated α-cellulose. This is a clear indicator of their high efficiency for isolating cellulose from lignocellulosic precursors. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - The seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (LL), a legume tree native to Mexico, are traditionally harvested and utilized as food ingredients in regional dishes. In this study, the usefulness of LL biomass was investigated and processed in flours using the wholegrain seed (WS) and pods for polyphenols identification, whereas the cotyledon (CT) for protein concentrates functional characterization was used. The WS flour exhibited carbohydrates as the main macronutrient, followed by proteins (30.59%). Water-extracted polyphenols from pods flour (544.29 mg/L) were higher compared to the WS flour (165.85 mg/L). The predominant polyphenols in all samples were flavonols, specifically catechins. Although, in comparison to the mixtures of methanol–water (315.14 mg/L) and ethanol–water (471.22 mg/L), pods had about threefold polyphenols content than WS flours extracts. Protein fractionation in CT was higher than in WS flour, with globulins being the most abundant fraction in both materials (44.73 and 55.2%, respectively). Structural analyzes indicated a higher presence of structural elements in globulins, evident in FTIR spectra and SDS-PAGE analysis. Globulins displayed bands around 50, 37, and 22 kDa, while glutelins exhibited a unique band at 50 kDa. Globulins also demonstrated a higher essential amino acid content. The functional properties of globulins and glutelins were pH-dependent. Globulins solubility (72.53%), emulsifying (35.13%), foaming (138.66%), water holding (3.17 g/g), and oil absorption (1.20 g/g) capacities were higher compared to glutelins (62.42%, 31.69%, 66.70%, 2.86 g/g, and 0.52 g/g, respectively). These findings suggest that LL biomass holds potential as a sustainable source of natural ingredients for food development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences 2024.

AB  - This study examines the spatio-temporal dynamics of Acacia auriculiformis in Lubumbashi city, southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the context of rapid urbanization following the liberalization of the mining sector. The city has experienced significant demographic growth and unplanned spatial expansion, resulting in a decrease in vegetation cover. The introduction and proliferation of A. auriculiformis, an exotic tree species, have occurred without strategic planning or monitoring. Utilizing digitized remote sensing imagery from 2006, 2014, and 2021, we quantified the expansion of A. auriculiformis along the urban–rural gradient. Additionally, a floristic inventory conducted in 2021 provided insights into tree diversity within A. auriculiformis plantations. Our findings indicate a substantial increase in the number and area of A. auriculiformis patches, predominantly in urban zones. However, the patch values, highest in 2006, were shown to decline by 2021, especially in urban areas. The floristic inventory identified 39 tree species within A. auriculiformis plantations, including predominant species such as Albizia lebbeck, Albizia alba, and Leucaena leucocephala. Notably, 20 of these species are exotic, with half being invasive. In contrast, the 19 indigenous species were primarily found in peri-urban areas. While a greater number of tree species were observed in urban zones, larger average diameters were recorded in peri-urban zones. The persistence and expansion of A. auriculiformis in a landscape characterized by declining tree cover suggest its potential sustainability in this setting. However, A. auriculiformis plantations have facilitated the establishment of predominantly exotic and potentially invasive species. These findings highlight the need for the strategic management of A. auriculiformis and associated exotic flora to mitigate their spread and to consider their role in the restoration of degraded lands. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This article presents an energy-efficient biochar kiln that produces biochar from agricultural crop residues. The kiln is designed to be easy to operate and has minimal requirements for special operations. It works by heating biomass in a combustion chamber using recirculated pyrogas. The study optimized the process parameters and economics of producing biochar from wheat straw using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Central Composite Design (CCD). The sustainable pyrolyzer had a thermal efficiency of 43.69%, with steady-state operation at 517.68 ± 98.18 °C. It produced an average of 54.57 ± 1.86 kg of biochar per batch, using 36.96 ± 3.66 kg of subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) as fuel and 179.61 ± 2.87 kg of wheat straw as feedstock. Subabul is chosen as a fuel due to its rapid growth, high calorific value, low moisture content, efficient combustion, and minimal smoke emission. The thermogravimetric index (TGI) and calorific value of WSB were 7.14 and 25.91 ± 0.74 MJ/kg, respectively. The benefit–cost ratio and payback period were 2.27 ± 0.16 and 4.92 ± 0.44 months, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) have been identified as the primary contaminants in soil, posing potential health threats. This study aimed to examine the effects of applying a nitrogen fertilizer and a fungal agent Trichoderma harzianum J2 (nitrogen alone, fungi alone, and combined use) on the phytoremediation of soils co-contaminated with Pb and Cd. The growth of Leucaena leucocephala was monitored in the seedling, differentiation, and maturity stages to fully comprehend the remediation mechanisms. In the maturity stage, the biomass of L. leucocephala significantly increased by 18% and 29% under nitrogen-alone (NCK+) and fungal agent-alone treatments (J2), respectively, compared with the control in contaminated soil (CK+). The remediation factors of Pb and Cd with NCK+ treatment significantly increased by 50% and 125%, respectively, while those with J2 treatment increased by 73% and 145%, respectively. The partial least squares path model suggested that the nitrogen-related soil properties were prominent factors affecting phytoextraction compared with biotic factors (microbial diversity and plant growth). This model explained 2.56 of the variation in Cd concentration under J2 treatment, and 2.97 and 2.82 of the variation in Pb concentration under NCK+ and J2 treatments, respectively. The redundancy analysis showed that the samples under NCK+ and J2 treatments were clustered similarly in all growth stages. Also, Chytridiomycota, Mucoromucota, and Ciliophora were the key bioindicators for coping with heavy metals. Overall, a similar remediation mechanism allowed T. harzianum J2 to replace the nitrogen fertilizer to avoid secondary pollution. In addition, their combined use further increased the remediation efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) represent a global problem for biodiversity conservation, and a growing concern involving IAS is related to their impacts on ecosystem services. However, their effects on ecosystem services in insular ecosystems are poorly known, which are particularly relevant and concerning due to the fragility and limited resources in these areas for several organisms, including humans. Therefore, the present study aimed to inventory ecosystem services and assess the impact of IAS on these services and the terrestrial ecosystems of the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, Brazil, which is a tropical protected area. The approach was applied to four IAS: black rat (Rattus rattus), domestic cat (Felis catus), tegu lizard (Salvator merianae), and lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala). A worksheet for ecosystem services was created, using the subdivisions defined in the zoning of the protected areas of Fernando de Noronha as management units, namely Urban Area, Beach Area, Green Area, Primitive Area, and Secondary Island. Additionally, two quantitative approaches were combined: the INvasive Species Effects Assessment Tool (INSEAT) to assess the positive and negative effects of IAS on ecosystem services, based on a questionnaire applied to experts; and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software to estimate the risk of impacts from IAS. In total, 21 ecosystem services, 41 benefits, and 10 groups of benefitting social actors were identified in Fernando de Noronha. In general, all IAS presented risks to the ecosystem services of Fernando de Noronha, especially F. catus and R. rattus. According to the impact index, the IAS caused negative effects to most ecosystem services considered, but the effects were more pronounced on the provisioning and cultural ecosystem service groups. On the other hand, a positive effect was found for L. leucocephala on regulating and maintenance services, although with a low impact index. With the exception of the Urban Area, all management units showed a high risk of being impacted by IAS, especially the Primitive Area. The main social actors impacted by the IAS were the local community, the floating population, and the Administration. The present study is the first to combine these quantitative techniques (INSEAT and InVEST) and represents a set of guidelines for ecosystem-based management to mitigate the impact of IAS, aiming at the maintenance and improvement of ecosystem services within protected areas in insular environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Botryococcus braunii is recognized as one of the most important microalgae species due to its high lipid content that may reach 75% of its dry weight. This amount is relatively higher than that in other microalgae species, thus potentially exploitable for biofuel production. Culture media support the growth of this microalga to sustain its culture production. Leucaena leaves supernatant (LLS) has potential as natural growth culture supplement. The present study aims to analyse the best concentration of LLS with optimum light intensity as supplement for microalgae growth by using an experimental method. This study consisted of four treatments with three replications during 14 days of experiment or one cycle of growth phase of B. braunii. The concentrations of LLS on the treatment were 2.5, 7.5 and 12.5%. The determination of light intensity for cultivation was based on the preliminary test, with 2500, 5000 and 7500 Lux. The best growth-producing light intensity was used in the main experiment. The initial density of microalgae was 100,000 cells/mL under environmental conditions of 26 °C, pH of 7.85, salinity of 30 ppt and photoperiod of 12/12 h light/dark cycle. The lipid test was carried out using Soxhlet method. The results of the study showed that LLS at 12.5% produced the highest lipid content (41.39%), while lower lipid content was found at 7.5, 2.5 and 0% of LLS (control) (37.23, 30.61 and 23.73%, respectively). © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University 2024.

AB  - Background: This study compares seed germination and seedling growth parameters of native Senegalia catechu with its closely related invasive Leucaena leucocephala in Nepal. For the comparison of seed germination percentage (GP), mean germination time (MGT), and Timson’s index (TI), the seeds of both species were incubated under different light (photoperiod and dark), temperatures (30/20ºC and 25/15ºC) and water stress conditions (−0.1, −0.25, −0.5, −0.75, and −1 MPa). The seedling emergence from different soil depths was also evaluated. The relative growth rate (RGR), root mass fraction (RMF), stem mass fraction, leaf mass fraction (LMF), and root-to-shoot ratio (RSR) of seedlings were also measured. Results: The seed length and mass of invasive L. leucocephala were higher than that of native S. catechu. The GP of S. catechu was higher at high temperature and photoperiod comparing to L. leucocephala. There was no difference in GP between two species under other light and temperature conditions. The MGT of S. catechu was shorter than that of L. leucocephala at both temperatures. Senegalia catechu exhibited higher TI than L. leucocephala, particularly at high temperatures. Water stress above −0.5 MPa reduced the GP and TI of both species and it was more pronounced in S. catechu than L. leucocephala. The seedling emergence percentage of L. leucocephala was higher than that of S. catechu. Both species exhibited comparable RGR and biomass allocations (RMF, LMF, and RSR). However, L. leucocephala had always greater values of shoot height, root length, leaf number and seedling biomass compared to S. catechu. Conclusions: Larger seeds may not always lead to higher seed GP. Some, but not all, seed germination and seedling growth traits can be useful to characterize invasive alien plant species. Invasiveness of L. leucocephala could be attributed to relatively high tolerance of seed germination to water stress, capacity to germinate from deeper soil, and larger seedling size compared to the confamilial native species. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in plant-based diets, particularly legumes, as a sustainable and healthy dietary choice. This study breaks new ground by investigating the effects of simulated gastrointestinal digestion on green (Leucaena leucocephala) and pigmented (Leucaena esculenta) guaje proteins. We evaluated the antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties of ultrafiltered fractions resulting from digestion in a macrophage model. Both fractions showed promising potential as radical scavengers. The fraction <5 kDa from pigmented guaje, even at the lowest doses tested, significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, and demonstrated an immunomodulatory effect by reducing the levels of ROS and NO. These findings suggest that green and pigmented guaje could be a valuable source of bioactive peptides, potentially used as a coadjutant for treating and preventing oxidative stress and inflammation-associated non-communicable diseases through the utilization of underutilized legumes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tropical grassland soils, especially those with alkaline properties, often exhibit limited phosphorus availability due to its precipitation in insoluble forms. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and rhizobia have demonstrated their potential to enhance the availability of this nutrient and promote the growth of forage legumes. This study, conducted under controlled conditions in a mesh house, evaluated the effect of co-inoculation with PSB, including Micrococcus sp. Sfcm-14-01, Agrobacterium sp. Sfl-043-09, and Enterobacter sp. Sfcm-014-02 and Sfcm-054-06, along with rhizobia (Ensifer terangae R1-012-02 and Bradyrhizobium glycinis Rcm-025-01), under different levels of phosphorus fertilization on the legumes Leucaena leucocephala and Centrosema macrocarpum. The results indicate significant increases in various growth parameters, such as chlorophyll levels (SPAD), biomass (dry weight of roots and aerial parts) (mg), the foliar phosphorus concentration (ppm), and the concentration of available phosphorus in the soil, particularly under low-phosphorus fertilization conditions. The highest level of available phosphorus in the soil was achieved with 75% of the recommended fertilization dose, resulting in concentrations of 13.73 ppm for L. leucocephala and 7.69 ppm for C. macrocarpum, representing increases in phosphorus availability of 170.81% and 240.27%, respectively, compared with no fertilization or inoculation. These findings suggest that the co-inoculation of PSB and native rhizobia is a promising strategy to enhance the biomass productivity and mineral content of forage in tropical grazing systems, especially under phosphorus-limited conditions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Global demand for milk is increasing with population growth, but industry ethics are a concern due to profit-driven practices. In this work, a surface-active electrode composite was synthesized using a surface-modified Corning glass electrode (TiO2-LL@AgNps) coated with phytofabricated silver nanoparticles from Leucaena leucocephala leaf extracts. To investigate the structural properties of the phytofabricated silver nanoparticles, various characterization techniques were used, including scanning and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-visible, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The findings revealed the synthesis of crystalline, spherical silver nanoparticles with an average size of 11.93 nm and a maximum absorption of 436 nm. This surface-modified electrode was made from synthesized silver nanoparticles and used for the electrochemical detection of urea in both artificial samples and real milk. The detection was based on the measurement of the induced potential resulting from the surface interaction between urea and the developed electrode. The composite was successfully used for urea detection. The sensing parameters, including the sensing range (5.0×10-6 M to 25.0×10-6 M), sensitivity (5.0 mV μM-1 cm-2), and detection limit (2.48× 10-6 M). The developed electrode exhibited a response time of 5 min and maintained stability for 28 days. This environmentally friendly sensor is comparable to the spectroscopic approach and shows minimal interference from other substances present in milk. © 2024 Author(s).

AB  - Live yeast cultures have been a popular additive in ruminant feeds to improve fermentation efficiency, rumen, and intestinal health. However, very little is known about inactive yeast culture and hydrolysable yeast cells on nutrient digestibility in ruminants. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effects of a combined yeast culture and enzymatically hydrolysed yeast (YC+EHY) on in vitro dry matter and nutrient digestibility. Seven chemically contrasting substrates, including the leaves and petiole of forage plants (Trichanthera gigantea, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Brachiaria arrecta), agriculture by-products (soybean meal and rice hulls), and a commercial concentrate feed, were incubated in vitro with and without YC+EHY to determine dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), and acid detergent fibre (ADF) digestibility after 24 and 48 h of incubation. A second experiment evaluated in vitro CP degradability by incubating substrates for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h with and without YC+EHY. Incubation with YC+EHY reduced 24 h DM and CP digestibility in soybean meal and G. sepium by 16.2% and 38.5%, respectively. Conversely, the ADF digestibility of B. arrecta incubated with YC+EHY increased by 32%. In vitro ruminal DM and nutrient digestibility were unaffected by YC+EHY after 48 h of incubation. The rate of CP degradability in the commercial concentrate and rice hull inoculated with YC+EHY increased sharply between 16 and 24 h post-incubation and generally plateaued afterwards. Similarly, YC+EHY significantly increased CP degradability in L. leucocephala after 8 and 16 h of incubation. The 16 h CP degradation in T. gigantea without YC+EHY was significantly higher. It was therefore concluded that YC+EHY has potential to improve ruminal ADF digestibility and modify ruminal CP degradation dependent on the type of substrate. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - One of the major challenges in preventing glaucoma progression is patient compliance with medication regimens. Since conventional ophthalmic dosage forms have numerous limitations, researchers have been intensively working on developing polymers-based delivery systems for glaucoma drugs. Specifically, research and development efforts have increased using polysaccharide polymers such as sodium alginate, cellulose, β-cyclodextrin, hyaluronic acid, chitosan, pectin, gellan gum, galactomannans for sustained release to the eye to overcome treatment challenges, showing promise in improving drug release and delivery, patient experience, and treatment compliance. In the recent past, multiple research groups have successfully designed sustained drug delivery systems, promoting the efficacy as well as the feasibility of glaucoma drugs with single/combinations of polysaccharides to eliminate the drawbacks associated with the glaucoma treatment. Naturally available polysaccharides, when used as drug vehicles can increase the retention time of eye drops on the ocular surface, leading to improved drug absorption and bioavailability. Additionally, some polysaccharides can form gels or matrices that can release drugs slowly over time, providing sustained drug delivery and reducing the need for frequent dosing. Thus, this review aims to provide an overview of the pre-clinical and clinical studies of polysaccharide polymers applied for glaucoma treatment along with their therapeutic outcomes. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli is a serious threat to human and animal health, with antimicrobial drug resistance contributing to the problem. Alternative mechanisms of prevention and treatment of E. coli-induced diarrhoea include those targeting biofilm production and quorum sensing, properties that have been associated with some investigated plant extracts. Plants were selected from various genera, including Vachellia, Senegalia, Morus, Leucaena, Salix, Grewia, Ziziphus, Searsia, Dichrostachys and Ceratonia, based on their known antimicrobial activity. The antibacterial effects of leaf extracts against multidrug-resistant E. coli O157:H7 were investigated using a broth microdilution method, and cytotoxicity to normal mammalian cell lines was studied using a tetrazolium colorimetric assay. Subsequently, antibiofilm activity and inhibition of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production by plant extracts against E. coli O157:H7 was investigated using crystal violet as a staining dye after 0 and 24 h incubation and carbohydrate estimation 5 % phenol-sulfuric assay. The biosensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472 was used to study the anti-quorum sensing potential of the selected plant extracts. Cell motility, cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH), and aggregation were also investigated. All plant extracts had weak antibacterial activity (MIC > 0.62 mg/ml) with relatively low cytotoxicity. The acetone extracts of Salix babylonica and Leucaena leucocephala prevented bacterial cell attachment (0 h) by 81.21 % and 89.36 %, respectively. Approximately 28 % of plant extracts eradicated established biofilms by more than 50 %, however, they were unable to inhibit EPS production above 30 %. The half-maximal concentration of extracts generally inhibited violacein production (ranging from 0.01 to 0.02 mg/ml), with V. erioloba acetone extract being the most effective at quorum quenching. Some plant extracts exhibited a significant difference (p<0.05) in motility, aggregation and hydrophobicity compared to untreated cells. This study highlights the potential of selected plant extracts to act via different mechanisms of action to decrease virulence of enteric E. coli, motivating further investigation of the bioactive compounds in the leaves. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Seed hydration memory is an adaptive strategy for plants in semiarid environments where water availability is irregular and unpredictable. Species native to these environments that have memory benefit from discontinuous hydration during their germination process and acquire tolerance to environmental stresses. The guiding question of this study is “does an alien species that invades a semiarid ecosystem also have seed hydration memory and benefit from discontinuous hydration?” To answer this question, we collected seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, an alien species that invades a Brazilian Tropical Dry Forest. We subjected the seeds to 0, 1, 2 and 3 hydration/dehydration cycles (HD cycles) at three different time intervals and, subsequently, to water, saline and thermal stresses. In addition, we used modeling to define the osmotic and thermal limits for occurrence of L. leucocephala and evaluated whether these limits increase after discontinuous hydration of seeds. The cycles of HD positively influenced the germination of seeds submitted to all stresses evaluated, increasing seed tolerance to treatments of water, saline, and thermal stresses. Discontinuous hydration increased the osmotic limits of salinity and thermal tolerance, although not increasing the osmotic limit of water deficit. Our results show that HD cycles also change the patterns of germinative responses of an invasive species to the environmental stresses of the invaded ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Industrialization and population growth are the important factors for the deterioration of air quality in the current scenario. Air pollution monitoring using plants as bioindicators is the best and cheapest way. Oxidative stress induced on plants due to air pollution can be studied using antioxidant peroxidase enzyme activity. The present study aims at the comparative assessment of peroxidase activity of twelve plant species from the Chembur industrial area and less polluted zone of similar ecological conditions for two years. The peroxidase activity was determined using the spectrophotometric method. The observations based on the current investigation revealed a rise in the peroxidase activity of twelve plant species of the industrial zone as compared to the less polluted zone. It may indicate an increase in the resistant capacity of all experimental samples toward the oxidative stress caused due to air pollution. Plant species like Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth, Ricinus communis L., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit., Albizia saman (Jacq.) Merr, Thespesia populnea (L.) Sol. ex. Correa, Polyalthia longifolia (Sonn.) Thwaites, Prosopis juliflora (SW.) DC., Terminalia catappa L. showed higher peroxidase activity values and hence may be used as bioindicators. Thespesia populnea (L.) Sol. ex. Correa, Polyalthia longifolia (Sonn.) Thwaites and Terminalia catappa L. being evergreen plants may be planted in good numbers in the Chembur industrial area. It may act as a primary step to ameliorate the industrial air pollution in the Chembur industrial zone by enhancing the green zone. This kind of investigation with other factors may help us to sustain our mother nature for future generations. © 2024, Rasayan Journal of Chemistry, c/o Dr. Pratima Sharma. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a key nutrient in silvicultural ecosystems, where its cycling influences both primary productivity and ecosystem development. Different trees affect P availability in distinct ways. Analyzing impact of various trees on soil P fractions and the its adsorption-desorption behavior helps better understand soil P availability in these ecosystems. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of silviculture systems (SCSs) on depth distribution of P fractions, the P adsorption-desorption pattern, and P availability in eco-restored land. Three distinct silviculture systems, namely Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Hardwickia binata (HB), and Azadirachta indica (AI) SCSs were compared with degraded fallow (F) to assess their influence on soil properties and P dynamics in a Typic Haplustepts of semi-arid ecosystem. Soil samples were collected from three different depths 0–15 cm, 15–30 cm, and 30–45 cm of these SCSs. The LL, HB and AI showed 2.50, 2.01 and 1.39 times increase in available P over fallow, respectively. Microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) content increased in LL by 99, 97, and 53 % at 0–15, 15–30, and 30–45 cm, respectively, over fallow. For acid phosphatase activity, LL, HB, and AI exhibited 3.15, 2.43, and 1.56 folds increase over fallow. The distribution of different phosphorus fractions followed the order: Fe-P (39.9–36.7 %)> Organic P (25.7–24.4 %) > Al-P (24.8–19.1 %)> Ca-P (8.64–4.05 %)> Res-P (8.61–7.37 %)> Saloid P (0.63–0.50 %). Additionally, P adsorption-desorption revealed that SCSs could lower the adsorption capacity and P desorption than fallow. Thus, different silviculture systems exhibit the potential to enhance the P-supplying capacity of soil and restore degraded soils in semi-arid regions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current study evaluated the effects of air pollution on selected street trees in the National Capital Territory during the pre- and post-monsoon seasons to identify the optimally suitable tree for green belt development in Delhi. The identification was performed by measuring the air pollution tolerance index (APTI), anticipated performance index (API), dust-capturing capacity (DCC) and proline content on the trees. The APTI of street trees of Delhi varied significantly among different tree species (F11,88.91 = 47.18, p < 0.05), experimental sites (F3,12.52 = 6.65, p < 0.001) and between seasons (F1,31.12 = 16.51, p < 0.001), emphasizing the relationships between trees and other types of variables such as the climate and level of pollution, among other factors. This variability emphasizes the need to choose trees to use for urban greening in the improvement of air quality in different environments within cities. Ascorbic acid (AA) concentration and relative water content (RWC) had a strong influence on APTI with an extremely significant moderate positive correlation between AA concentration and APTI (r = 0.65, p < 0.001) along with RWC and APTI (r = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that higher levels of AA concentration and RWC are linked to increased air pollution tolerance. The PCA bi-plot indicates AA has poor positive loading coefficients with PC1 explaining 29.49% of the total variance in the dataset. The highest APTI was recorded in Azadirachta indica (22.01), Leucaena leucocephala (20.65), Morus alba (20.62), Ficus religiosa (20.61) and Ficus benghalensis (19.61), irrespective of sites and seasons. Similarly, based on API grading, F. religiosa and F. benghalensis were identified as excellent API grade 6 (81–90%), A. indica and Alstonia scholaris as very good API grade 5 (71–80%), M. alba, Pongamia pinnata and Monoon longifolium as good API grade 4 (61–70%) and Plumeria alba as moderate API grade 3 (51–60%) in different streets of Delhi. As these plants are indigenous to the region and hold significant socio-economic and aesthetic significance in Indian societies, they are advisable for avenue plantations as part of various government initiatives to support environmental sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Background: There is an increased need for intercropping practice in drylands to increase land-use efficiency. Canopy cover is a great tool to assess agricultural yield, as it is an indicator of plant health and productivity. Methods: The smartphone-based application Canopeo was used to measure the canopy cover (CC) of Clitoria under mixed intercropping with Leucaena and with four (4) fertilization levels (Control, 200 kg, 300 kg and 400 kg of NPK). Forage yield and (CC) were measured during six (6) consecutive harvests. Moreover, forage quality (NPK and protein) was analyzed. Result: The results revealed a high positive correlation between (CC) with crop yield and quality. Also, the application of fertilizers produced higher (CC) associated with higher yield and forage quality. The relatively low correlation of (CC) with yield in intercropping may be due to the high competition of the Leucaena tree. However, the whole intercropping system was positive (with an LER of 2.4), indicating better land-use efficiency. The results concluded that intercropping in drylands would result in better land use. While the application of NPK fertilizers will increase crop (CC), which in turn will reflect in higher forage yield and quality. © (2024), (Agricultural Research Communication Centre).

AB  - Increasing global fuel demand has created challenges in sourcing raw materials, making agro-waste biomass utilization for energy production a critical alternative. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the production of charcoal briquettes using different base materials such as coconut shells (TC1), Leucaena leucocephala wood (TC2), and assorted wood charcoal residues (TC3), along with binders derived from cassava industry by-products—namely, tapioca starch (TB1), cassava peel (TB2), and cassava tubers (TB3) at binder content (BC) ratios of 5, 10, 15, and 20 by volume. Initially, assessing the physical properties, including proximate and ultimate analyses, was crucial for predicting effective charcoal production. The TC2 briquettes, using TB2 and TB3 binders at a BC20 concentration, were found to be optimal, displaying a high production capacity and low specific energy consumption. Using cassava peel and tubers as binders not only efficiently uses agricultural by-products, thereby reducing costs and avoiding competition with food resources (TC1) but also results in high-quality briquettes. In scenarios of raw material shortages, TC3 and TC2 can effectively replace TC1. Mechanically, TC3 and TC2 briquettes exhibited superior characteristics. Although BC20 enhances the mechanical properties and facilitates handling, it may compromise heat release. Thermally, a higher BC decreases the charcoal proportion, leading to increased ignition time, reduced calorific value, and heating effectiveness. In conclusion, the successful production of charcoal briquettes from agro-industrial waste using cassava industrial binders presents a viable pathway towards more sustainable energy practices, improves waste management, and adds value to agricultural waste. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The aimed of the research was to evaluate the physical-chemical, anatomical and energy characteristics of the wood of the Prosopis juliflora and Leucaena leucocephala species, with a view to using it as an energy source. To do this, five trees per species were selected and 5 cm thick disks were removed at 0 (base), 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the commercial height of the trunk, considering a minimum diameter of 5.0 cm. These disks were divided into four wedge-shaped parts, with two wedges used to determine basic density, bark content and heartwood: sapwood ratio and the others used for chemical and energy analysis and charcoal production. The Prosopis juliflora species had the highest dry mass (77.92 kg), basic density (779.31 kg.m-3) and C:A ratio (1.00). On the other hand, Leucaena leucocephala had a higher insoluble lignin content (28.17%), while Prosopis juliflora had higher percentages of extractives (9.75%) and ash in the wood (2.20%). The energy density of the wood was higher for Prosopis juliflora (3.73 Gcal.m-3). There was no significant difference between the species for the results of upper and lower calorific value, fixed carbon content and volatile materials. In terms of gravimetric yield and charcoal productivity, Prosopis juliflora showed the highest results, with average values of 42.33% and 329.77 kg.m-3, respectively. Overall, both species showed satisfactory characteristics for energy use, with better results for Prosopis juliflora wood. © 2024 University Center of Maringa. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agroforestry practices that include trees on grazing lands could enhance atmospheric CO2 sequestration and storage. However, carbon sequestration rates and storage capacity of intensively grazed agroforestry systems vary due to the diversity in species composition, stand structure, system age, and management practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate carbon stocks and accrual rates in Leucaena leucocephala + Cynadon plectostachyus, and Brachiaria decumbens grass silvopastoral systems and compare them with conventional open grazing lands. The study was carried out in Chiapas in southern Mexico, one of the hotspots of deforestation driven by the expansion of livestock farming. We measured above- and belowground carbon stocks in 18 silvopasture (SP) plots, with the plantation age ranging from 2 to 10 years. Nine plots of adjacent conventional full-sun grasslands (open pasturelands) grazed rotationally were sampled for comparison. The average tree biomass stock in SP was 5.5 ± 1.9 Mg C ha−1 and differed with SP age. Mean annual biomass accrual rates ranged from 0.25 to 2.57 Mg C ha−1 year−1, indicating that SP systems are CO2 sinks, excluding other sources of GHG such as methane emissions from enteric fermentation. The average soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rate of SP was 0.143 ± 0.043 Mg C ha−1 year−1 to 50 cm depth. The SOC sequestration rates correlated positively with SP age at the beginning and decreased after about 8 years. The results suggested that the age and lifespan of trees play a significant role in aboveground C sequestration through the Leucaena leucocephala SP, while SOC storage varied with soil properties. Further research on the relative response of active and stable SOC fractions along with soil CO2 fluxes could explain the results on the SOC storage potential of these agroforestry systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - This study aims to valorize agricultural waste of Leucaena leucocephala pods (LP) as a low-cost precursor for synthesizing high-performance activated carbon (LP-AC) for the removal of methylene blue dye (MB). Phosphoric acid H3PO4 was employed as a chemical activator of the LP biomass with a mass ratio of phosphoric acid to the precursor (3/1) before being calcined at 500 °C for 55 min. Box Benken design was investigated to optimize the experimental parameters of initial concentration, adsorbent dose, and pH. Variable optimization indicated that the highest removal efficiency of MB dye, estimated as 99.99%, was noticed at the initial concentration of 300.87 mg L−1, adsorbent dose of 0.049 g, and solution pH of 10.07. Isotherm study revealed that Temkin model shows the best agreement with the experimental data with a correlation coefficient of (R2 = 0.990). The adsorption capacity of MB dye was determined as 584.32 mg g−1. The kinetic study suggested that the pseudo-second-order model is the best-correlated model for data fitting with (R2 > 0.997). The thermodynamic analysis indicated an enthalpy change (ΔH) of − 18.50 kJ/mol, confirming that the adsorption of MB dye onto LP-AC material is an exothermic process. SEM characterization of the surface showed that the LP-AC exhibits a heterogeneous structure. The BET analysis revealed a remarkable surface area of 1367.30 m2 g−1 for the produced carbon, including a blend of mesoporous and microporous structures. Furthermore, complementary analyses including EDS, TGA, and FTIR confirmed the presence of crucial properties, underscoring its potential effectiveness as an adsorbent for removing MB dye. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2024.

AB  - The rapid dietary changes experienced by indigenous people worldwide threaten the use of traditional foods, which are often undervalued. This study focused on evaluating the antioxidant and antibacterial efficacy of five vegetables typically consumed by the Manipuri ethnic groups in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh: Yongchak seed (Parkia speciosa), Telikadam seed (Leucaena leucocephala), Phakphai leaf (Persicaria odorata), Sheuli leaf (Nyctanthes arbor-tristis), and bamboo shoot (Bambusa spp.). The samples were dried and powdered to assess the antioxidant activity through total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total tannin content (TTC), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. Antibacterial efficacy was determined by measuring the zone of inhibition (ZOI), minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Leafy vegetables exhibited higher TPC, TFC, and TTC than seeds and shoots, with N. arbor-tristis leaf showing the highest TPC (99.16 ± 2.07 mg GAE/g DW) and P. odorata leaf exhibiting the highest TFC (9.19 ± 0.7 mg QE/g) and TTC (3.59 ± 0.26 mg TAE/g). However, Bambusa spp. shoot extract showed the highest antioxidant potential (IC50: 1.66 ± 0.05 mg/mL). All samples exhibited higher ZOI against gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp.), ranging from 10 ± 2.65 to 19.33 ± 2.08 mm. L. leucocephala seed extract showed the highest antibacterial activity against both the tested gram-positive bacteria with a MIC of 15.6 mg/mL. Conversely, the P. odorata leaf extract exerted the strongest antibacterial effect against gram-negative bacteria, with the lowest MIC values for Klebsiella spp. (31.25 mg/mL) and Escheria coli (62.5 mg/mL). The findings of this investigation suggest that the selected indigenous vegetables could be valuable sources of phytochemicals with potential antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Incorporating and promoting these traditional foods into the diet may improve food security, dietary diversity, and public health in Bangladesh. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The mining industry in the copper belt region of Africa was initiated in the early 1900s, with copper being the main ore extracted to date. The main objectives of the present study are (1) to characterize the microbial structure, abundance, and diversity in different ecological conditions in the cupriferous city of Lubumbashi and (2) to assess the metal phytoextraction potential of Leucaena leucocephala, a main plant species used in tailing. Four ecologically different sites were selected. They include a residential area (site 1), an agricultural dry field (site 2), and an agricultural wetland (site 3), all located within the vicinity of a copper/cobalt mining plant. A remediated tailing was also added as a highly stressed area (site 4). As expected, the highest levels of copper and cobalt among the sites studied were found at the remediated tailing, with 9447 mg/kg and 2228 mg/kg for copper and cobalt, respectively. The levels of these metals at the other sites were low, varying from 41 mg/kg to 579 mg/kg for copper and from 4 mg/kg to 110 mg/kg for cobalt. Interestingly, this study revealed that the Leucaena leucocephala grown on the remediated sites is a copper/cobalt excluder species as it accumulates soil bioavailable metals from the rhizosphere in its roots. Amplicon sequence analysis showed significant differences among the sites in bacterial and fungal composition and abundance. Site-specific genera were identified. Acidibacter was the most abundant bacterial genus in the residential and remediated tailing sites, with 11.1% and 4.4%, respectively. Bacillus was predominant in both dry (19.3%) and wet agricultural lands (4.8%). For fungi, Fusarium exhibited the highest proportion of the fungal genera at all the sites, with a relative abundance ranging from 15.6% to 20.3%. Shannon diversity entropy indices were high and similar, ranging from 8.3 to 9 for bacteria and 7.0 and 7.4 for fungi. Β diversity analysis confirmed the closeness of the four sites regardless of the environmental conditions. This lack of differences in the microbial community diversity and structures among the sites suggests microbial resilience and physiological adaptations. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the association of Opuntia stricta (OS) or Nopalea cochenillifera (NC) with Moringa hay (MY) or Leucaena hay (LY) on nutrient intake, ingestive behavior, serum biochemistry, and milk production and composition of dairy goat. Eight multiparous Saanen goats were used, with an average of 68 ± 8 days in milk and 48.5 ± 6 kg of initial weight, fed with the following treatment diets: OS + MY; OS + LY; NC + MY, and NC + LY. The treatments were distributed in a double Latin square, in a 2 × 2 factorial scheme (two varieties of cactus and two of hay). Goats fed with NC had higher (P < 0.05) intakes of dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and non-fibrous carbohydrates. There was no influence (P > 0.05) on milk production, but goats fed with OS produced milk with higher (P < 0.05) fat content and presented higher (P < 0.05) feed efficiency. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of the hay type on the nutrient intake and milk production and composition of goats, but the animals fed with MY had higher (P < 0.05) serum cholesterol levels and greater efficiency of NDF rumination. Goats fed with OS showed greater feeding and rumination efficiency. Our results indicated that both cactus species could be successfully included in the diet of low yielding dairy goats fed 18.4% concentrate. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala poisoning is reported in horses in different Brazilian regions. The poisoning occurred one month after the horses were introduced into paddocks invaded by the plant or after 10 days of consuming cut Leucaena administered as the only food. Affected horses showed moderate to severe hair loss on the mane and tail, orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with marked follicular telogenization, and hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells. Mimosin concentration in leaves (5.5 mg/g) was determined by a new HLPC-UV method which is also reported. © 2024

AB  - Background: Green post-harvest sugarcane residues (Saccharum officinarum) present low rates of decomposition and N release in the short term when integrated into the production system. Combining S. officinarum residues with the foliage of local plants rich in nitrogen could be an alternative to accelerate the decomposition process of residues with a positive impact on soil conservation. Objective: To evaluate and compare the decomposition patterns and potential release of N to the soil of the residues of S. officinarum variety MEX 69-290, with the addition of different foliage such as Clitoria ternatea, Leucaena leucocephala and Tithonia diversifolia, in southern Quintana Roo. Methodology: The treatments evaluated were the following: Clitoria + MEX 69-290, Leucaena + MEX 69-290, Tithonia + MEX 69-290, and MEX 69-290 (control). The materials were placed in decomposition bags and incubated on the ground in four periods (15, 30, 60 and 120 days), in a completely randomized design. The contents of dry matter, nitrogen and lignin were determined for the initial and remaining material in each period. Results: With the integration of local plants, a significant increase in the percentage of decomposition and release of N was obtained. After 120 days of evaluation, the decomposition values were 71.3, 50.4, 48.1 and 33.5%, for the Tithonia + MEX 69-290, Clitoria + MEX 69-290, Leucaena + MEX 69-290, and MEX 69-290 control, respectively. Likewise, the potential N release values were 98.2, 95.3, 92.9 and 58.7%, for Tithonia + MEX 69-290, Leucaena + MEX 69-290, Clitoria + MEX 69-290, and MEX 69-290 control. The Tithonia + MEX 69-290 treatment had the highest relative decomposition rate (0.009 g g-1 day-1) and a high potential N release rate (0.053 g g-1 day-1), compared to the other treatments. Implications: The integration of N-rich plants can increase the decomposition and release of N from sugarcane residues, with potential in plant assimilation from the first crop cycle, reduce the application of nitrogen fertilizer and increase sugarcane yields. in the region. Conclusion: The combination of S. officinarum residues with foliage of local plants, particularly T. diversifolia, could be considered a viable strategy to accelerate the decomposition process and release of N in residues on the edaphoclimatic conditions of southern Quintana Roo. © 2024 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

AB  - To evaluate the potential of compost based on municipal solid waste (MSW) and 20% legume pruning under a pyrolysis process, generated products, including solids (biochar), liquids (bio-oil), and gases (non-condensable gases), through experimentation in a pilot plant with a fluidized bed reactor at 450°C and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry have been analysed. In addition, the compost kinetic behaviour by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), using the Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) method, has been investigated. Four different reaction zones, associated with lignocellulosic materials (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin) with a first step for water evaporation, in TGA curve have been observed. A biochar with low stability and aromaticity, considering high and low O/C and H/C ratios, respectively, has been obtained. The obtained pyrolytic liquids contain a high concentration of phenolic compounds because of a significant presence of lignins and other high molecular weight compounds in the original material. Moreover, the generated non-condensable gases consist mainly of short-chain compounds, such as alcohols, aldehydes, and alkenes produced from hemicellulose, cellulose, and proteins. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of adding fibrolytic enzyme cocktail, which was derived from dried tomato pomace treated with Aspergillus niger, to Leucaena silage on total gas production by using in vitro gas techniques. In addition, the effect of these enzymes on voluntary feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and rumen fermentation were determined using 8 male, crossbred Anglo Nubian x Native goats. The experiment was designed as a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square. The experimental treatments were randomly assigned to each sequence of feeding of the 4 experimental treatments, i.e., 0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.8% (dry matter) of enzyme cocktail supplemented to Leucaena silage. The addition of 0.4% enzyme cocktail increased total gas production at 96 h, which was not different from the addition of commercial cellulase. Gas production from the insoluble fraction (b) was improved by increasing the enzyme cocktail levels (P = 0.039). The voluntary intake of Leucaena silage increased with an increase in the addition of enzyme level (P = 0.025). The dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, NDF and ADF digestibility's were also increased by increasing the addition of enzyme cocktail level. The addition of enzyme cocktail increased the Prevotella_1 in rumen fluid compared with the untreated group. In conclusion, at 0.4%, the fibrolytic enzyme cocktail derived from A. niger increased feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and ruminal fibrolytic bacteria community in goats. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current research was performed in the Morni Hills, a part of the outer Himalayas. Floristic assessment is critical for a plant community, reflecting both the gene pool and adaptability of the community. For this, different parameters like density, frequency, basal area, IVI, and various diversity indices were calculated by dividing the area into two altitudinal ranges, i.e. 400-600 m AMSL (AR_1) and 600-800 m AMSL (AR_2). The vegetation sampling was done by randomly selecting 30 plots in the selected area. The study showed that AR_2 (118 plant species: 31 trees, 17 shrubs, 58 herbs, and 12 climbers) had a higher number of plant species in comparison to AR_1 (106 plant species: 26 trees, 14 shrubs, 54 herbs, and 12 climbers) with Poaceae being the family with the greatest number of species. The area was seen to be dominated by Acacia nilotica (L.) willd. Ex Delile, Cassia fistula L., and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in AR_1 while by Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre, Cassia fistula, and Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz in AR_2. The upper range, i.e. AR_2 was also more diverse than AR_1 because of a high Shannon Wiener Diversity Index value and a lower Simpson Index value. Whereas the population structure study demonstrated that girth class D (CBH=61-90 cm) had the highest number of tree species in both altitudinal ranges, followed by girth class C (CBH=31-60 cm). Moreover, the forest was also observed to be occupied by various invasive plant species as well as under anthropogenic pressure, hence in immediate need of proper management and conservation.  © 2024 Himanshi Dhiman et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - A study was conducted to observe the nodulation status and measure nitrogenase activity of some important legume tree species in nursery. Of the thirteen species surveyed eight belong to Mimoceae, two Papilionaceae and three Caesalpiniaceae. All the species in Mimoceae and Papilionaceae were found nodulated whereas all the members of Caesalpiniaceae were non-nodulated. Among nodulated seedlings, highest number of nodules per seedling was recorded in Leucaena leucocephala (82) followed by Acacia auriculiformis (55), Acacia mangium (52), Albizia lebbeck (46), A. procera (41), Dalbergia sissoo (32) and Acacia catechu (29). Nitrogenase activity was highest in L. leucocephla (4913.59 nmole C2H4 h-1) followed by Albizia procera (2080 nmole C2H4 h-1). Seedling height, nodule fresh weight, root fresh weight and nitrogenase activity (per nodule per h, per gram nodule fresh weight per h, per gram root fresh weight per h and per gram root dry weight per h) were also highest in L. leucocephala. © © 2000 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB  - The objective of this work was to carry out long-term monitoring of protein banks (PB) established under the real-low-input-farm conditions of Burkina Faso, characterized by a Sudano-Sahelian climate type with wide variations in rainfall. The PBs, planted in 2016–2017 with Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Morus alba (MA) at a high density (20,000 plants/ha), were monitored from 2016/2017 to 2021 for their biomass (fodder) production, chemical composition and nutritional value of the edible fodder, and their impacts on soil carbon content. The average annual fodder production of LL for the 6 PBs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) was 11.4 ± 2.12 t DM/ha/year, while that of MA was 3.8 ± 1.2 t DM/ha/year for the 3 PB (1, 2, and 3). Such differences are related to higher adaptive capacity for LL in such climatic conditions. Crude protein was higher in LL (19% versus 17%), but dry matter digestibility (65% versus 77%) was superior in MA. Soil carbon increased during the five monitored years, an exciting result for these poor, low-fertility soil conditions. Our results demonstrate the technical and environmental feasibility of establishing this low-input agroforestry technology in these conditions and inspire the potential of sustainable agriculture as an agroecological alternative to overcoming feed shortages for local livestock farming. However, the successful management of a PB relies on selecting the right suitable species, protecting them, and managing them during the establishment and fodder production periods with suitable cutting frequency and appropriate post-harvest management. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - The data presented here is the characteristics of biopellets and its raw materials. The raw materials of lignocellulosic waste (coffee skin, corncob, patchouli waste) and shrubs (Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium) were collected from certain districts in Indonesia which provided quite abundant stocks of these raw materials. The raw material preparation and pelletization at room temperature (25 °C) using a manual press machine were carried out at Hasanuddin University, Makassar, Indonesia. Meanwhile, pelletization at high temperatures (225 °C) was carried out at The Integrated Laboratory of Forest Research and Development, Bogor, Indonesia. The evaluation of density, moisture content, volatile matter content, ash content, and amount of fixed carbon were also carried out at the laboratory. Meanwhile, evaluation of mineral content (sulfur, Na2O, K2O, Cl) and calorivic value was carried out at the Livestock Research Institute, Bogor, Indonesia. The results show that pelletization at high temperature produces better quality biopellets compared to pelletization at room temperature. Pelletization of L. leucocephala at high temperature produces the best quality biopellets with the highest density (1.17 g/cm3) and calorific value (4726 kcal/kg) and the lowest moisture content (4.87 %) and mineral content (0.01 % of S, 0.0014 % of Na2O, 1.53 % of K2O, and 0.17 % of Cl) among the other raw materials tested. This dataset is expected to be a primary source in comparing and determining the proper type of raw material for biopellet production as an alternative renewable energy source, especially those originating from shrubs and similar lignocellulosic waste. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Alley cropping systems can change the weed community composition and reduce common weed species. However, it is unclear how different woody species intercalated with corn can affect weed abundance and community structure and corn yield in the tropics. The present study examined weed species diversity and community composition in alley cropping systems with three woody species associated with corn: Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Guazuma ulmifolia Lam., and Moringa oleifera Lam. independently, and corn monoculture, as a control. The tree most dominant weed species were Ruellia nudiflora (Engelm. & A. Gray) Urb., Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., and Portulaca pilosa L. Our results showed that the alley cropping system compared with corn monoculture reduced the densities of common abundant weed species, changed weed community composition, maintained or increased plant diversity, but did not affect grain yield (t/h). Based on the sample completeness profile we found that Leucaena associated with corn had a higher weed diversity of order q = 1 and 2 (Shannon and Simpson index) and showed higher evenness compared with corn monoculture, which showed the lowest evenness of all treatments. We found nine weed species that only grow in alley cropping systems and Waltheria americana L., Momordica charantia L. and Porophyllum punctatum (Mill) S.F. Blake. with higher densities. Our findings support the hypothesis that alley cropping systems not only changes weed community composition, but also favours biodiversity conservation without reducing corn yield. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Leucaena species (Leucaena trichodes and Leucaena leucocephala) offer significant potential for sustainable agriculture due to their ability to improve soil health and increase organic matter content. This study aimed to explore the benefits of composting Leucaena mixed with poultry manure and examine the effects of mimosine, an allelopathic compound found in Leucaena, on microbial activity during the composting process. Compost piles of 100 kg were prepared in various proportions (A: 80–20, B: 70–30, G: 0–100) and monitored for pH, temperature, and nutrient content. The pH levels ranged from 6.226 to 6.909, while temperatures varied between 24.66 and 32.85°C. Mimosine levels were quantified using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), showing concentrations of up to 5.5% in leaves and 5.2% in seeds. The presence of mimosine inhibited microbial oxidation, limiting biological activity during composting. Despite these challenges, the resulting earthworm humus contained high levels of nitrogen (up to 3.21%), phosphorus (P2 O5, 4.08%), and potassium (K2O, 2.32%), making it a nutrient-rich fertiliser ideal for nursery plants. These findings suggest that while mimosine affects composting, Leucaena-based humus can still be a valuable resource in sustainable agriculture, provided appropriate composting techniques are used to mitigate its effects. © 2024, Scibulcom Ltd..

AB  - Rainfed areas are the home of millions of resource poor farmers whose livelihood is under continuous threat due to frequent droughts. Assuring double cropping and imparting livelihood resilience to rainfed smallholders is a challenge. A study was planned in this direction during 2013–2021 for livelihood resilience and sustainable intensification of rainfed smallholder farming systems through rain water harvesting and agroforestry based interventions. The one hectare rainfed farming system model comprising of rain water harvesting farm pond (25 m × 20 m × 2.5 m), less water requiring food crops (groundnut–barley and sorghum–chickpea), agrihorticulture [Ziziphus mauritiana + (Sesamum indicum–Cicer arietinum)], silvipasture (Leucaena leucocephala + Tri-species hybrid grass + Stylosanthes hamata) and boundary plantation (Leucaena leucocephala and Opuntia ficus-indica) was evaluated at on-station as well as promoted on-farm. The goat rearing potential of the above model was also estimated under intensive and semi-intensive systems. The on-station rainfed farming system module produced 4979 kg ha−1 barley equivalent yield consisting of multiple products like barley, chickpea, groundnut, Indian jujube fruits, sesame, fodder (sorghum, TSH, Stylosanthes, Leucaena dried leaf meal and spine-less fodder cactus cladodes) and Grewia fruits and resulted in 655 US$ year−1 net returns with a benefit cost ratio of 2.1. The carrying capacity of the above model was found to be 9 and 35 goat year−1 under intensive and semi-intensive rearing systems, respectively. The net returns increased by 36 and 226% with the inclusion of goat under intensive (US$ 892) and semi-intensive rearing system (US$ 2136), respectively in the rainfed farming system model. It was evident from the study that inclusion of goat, agroforestry and farm pond for rain water harvesting in the rainfed farming have resulted in higher profitability and resilience to less rainfall and its aberrations. Contrarily, the on-farm observations revealed that farmers could not take winter season crops without rain water harvesting. The rain water harvesting proved to be the key for reducing chances of crop failures due to droughts, ensuring double cropping (cropping intensity up to 200%) and sustainable intensification in rainfed areas. It can be concluded from the present study that intervention of water harvesting, agroforestry and goat in rainfed farming systems could enhance the farm productivity and profitability and impart resilience to the livelihood of rainfed farmers in semi-arid tropics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - B ackground: Rhizobial bacteria is an important species among the soil bacteria that inter a relationship with leguminous plant and fix nitrogen symbiotically. Importance of this relation not only for soil as soil fertilizer but also to keep our environment without pollution. Methods: Survey was conducted to collect different strains of rhizobial from different area in Nineveh Governate in Iraq. Isolation and biochemical tests were done under laboratory conditions. Determination of exopolysaccharide and tolerance of heavy metal was conducted also. Data obtained was recorded after cultivation and incubation of rhizobial strains. Results: The rhizobial bacteria were isolated from the following leguminous plants: Vigna unguiculata L., Trifolium alexandrinum, Trigonella foenum-graecum L., Leucaena leucocephala L., Medicago sativa L., Phaseolus vulgaris L., Tribulus terrestris L. and Vicia faba L. Maximum exopolysaccharide production were reached to 3.70 gm/L by the isolate R. leguminosarum bv. Viciae RM25,after two days of incubation. The maximum cell dry weight was 2.90 gm/L. by the isolate E. meliloti RM14, after two days of incubation. Maximum reduction in pH were 4.30 by strain E. meliloti RM5, after two days incubation. All the local isolated rhizobia were tolerated to nickel chloride for the studied concentrations: 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 µg/ ml. Also were tolerance to 100 and 500 µg/ ml of zinc sulfate and copper sulfate. 1000 µg/ ml concentration of zinc sulfate were also tolerated by all rhizobial isolates. Conclusion: Rhizobium bacteria possess several mechanisms that allow them to tolerate heavy metal exposure. These mechanisms include the expression of efflux pumps, the presence of metal-resistance plasmids, the production of EPS, and the ability to adapt to environmental factors. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind the heavy metal tolerance in Rhizobium and to explore the potential applications of these bacteria in bioremediation of heavy metal polluted soils. © 2023, The Running Line.

The objective of this study was to isolate and identify the actinomycetes associated with the rhizosphere of plants in the karst ecosystem. This study was descriptive-quantitative. Soil sampling was conducted at three locations of the karst ecosystem of Gorontalo, i.e., Bangga Hills at Bangga Bubaa Coastal area of Gorontalo District, Hills around Lake Limboto of Gorontalo District, and Oluhuta Beach Hills at Bone Bolango District. Rhizosphere-soil sample was collected from 15-30 cm of soil depth. Isolation of actinomycetes was performed using the plate method. The screening of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria was based on the ability to solubilize phosphates indicated by the clear zone on the Pikovskaya medium. Identification of actinomycetes bacteria based on morphology and molecular characters. The morphology character included the color of aerial and substrate mycelium. Molecular characteristics based on the sequence of 16S rRNA gene compared to sequence data on the gene bank of NCBI. The phylogenetic tree reconstruction was based on the Neighbor-joining algorithm. The results successfully found six isolates, including three actinomycetes isolates, two non-actinomycetes bacteria, and one yeast. They were isolated from the rhizosphere of Malastoma malabathrum, Chromolaena odorata, Cycas rumphii, Leucaena leucocephala, and Jatropha curcas. The actinomycetes isolate showed plant-growth-promoting potential indicated by solubilizing phosphate and Indole 3-Acetic Acid production activities. Based on the molecular analysis, actinomycetes were closely related to Streptomyces aegyptia (MT505707.1:42-1426), Streptomyces sp. GGCR-6 (MH718844.1:5-1391), and Streptomyces carpaticus strain PES-A23 (MH712039). © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, experiments have been performed in modifying grass and legume to uncover their genetic variability. Such irradiation method could discover the hidden genetic potential of Leucaena leucocephala cv. Tarramba considering its nutritional content, high protein content, and good palatability. This study is a preliminary study of Leucaena leucocephala cv. Tarramba mutant (Ml). This study aims to identify the germination growth of Ml induced by gamma irradiation. The irradiation was performed in the National Nuclear Energy Agency of Indonesia. The germination experiments were conducted for one month in Green House, Central of Excellence (COE), Agriculture Faculty, Hasanuddin University. This study employed a completely randomized design (CRD) with nine treatments and eight replicates. The treatment included gamma irradiation at different doses that consisted of control treatment (without gamma induction); 50Gy; 150Gy; 250Gy; 350Gy; 450Gy; 550Gy; 650Gy; and 750Gy. The observed parameters in this study encompassed plumule length, radicule length, seedling length. Data obtained from observation were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT) at 5% margin error. The results indicated that gamma irradiation significantly affected the germination growth performance, i.e., plumule length, radicule length, and seedling, where the coefficient of variance <20%. Although fluctuation of germination performance value occurred, the plumule length performance tended to increase at the control and re-increase at the dose of 650Gy to 750Gy. Whereas the radicule and seedling length performance relatively increase at the dose of 550Gy to 750Gy. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the dose of 650Gy to 750Gy increases germination growth of Mutant (Ml) Leucaena leucocephala cv. Tarramba. Further research concerning the lethal dose for the forages, DNA genetic analysis and ensuring no toxic effect on livestock would be important to perform. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

AB  - In Mexico, pasture degradation is associated with extensive pastures; additionally, under these conditions, livestock activities contribute considerably to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Among the options to improve grazing systems and reduce GHG emissions, silvopastoral systems (SPS) have been recommended. The objectives of this work were to quantify the N outflow in a soil–plant–animal interface, as well as the CH4 emissions and milk production in an SPS with woody legumes (Leucaena leucocephala) that is associated with stargrass (Cynodon nlemfuensis). This was then compared with stargrass in a monoculture system (MS) in the seasons (dry and rainy period) over a two-year period. Dung was collected from the animals of each of the grazing systems and applied fresh to the land plots. Fresh dung and urine were collected from the cows of each grazing system and were applied to the experimental plots. In addition, the soil CH4 and N2O contents were measured to quantify the emissions. Average milk yield by seasons was similar: MS (7.1 kg per animal unit (AU)/day−1) and SPS (6.31 kg per AU/day−1). Cows in the MS had a mean N intake of 171.9 g/UA day−1 without seasonal variation, while the SPS animals’ mean N intake was 215.7 g/UA day−1 for both seasons. For the urine applied to soil, the N2O outflow was higher in the MS (peak value = 1623.9 μg N-N2O m−2 h−1). The peak value for the SPS was 755.9 μg of N-N2O m−2 h−1. The N2O emissions were higher in the rainy season (which promotes denitrification). The values for the feces treatment were 0.05% (MS) and 0.01% (SPS). The urine treatment values were 0.52% (MS) and 0.17% (SPS). The emissions of CH4 showed that the feces of the SPS systems resulted in a higher accumulation of gas in the rainy season (29.8 g C ha−1), followed by the feces of the MS system in the dry season (26.0 g C ha−1). Legumes in the SPS helped to maintain milk production, and the N2O emissions were lower than those produced by the MS (where the pastures were fertilized with N). © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - N2O has a global warming potential of 300 times greater than CO2, and in silvopastoral systems, urine is a source of N2O emission. The objective of the research was to evaluate the effect of the diet for bovines based on Leucaena leucocephala on N2O emissions in a simulated urine patch in a silvopastoral system. A Cynodon plectostachyus meadow was used, and 13 samplings were carried out during March-April 2021. The treatments were, A: 20 kg of urea/ha from bovine urine fed with 100% C. plectostachyus hay + 0% L leucocephala, B: 36 kg of urea/ha from the urine of bovines fed with 16% of L. leucocephala + 84% of C. plectostachyus and C: 79 kg of urea/ha from the urine of bovines fed with 33% L. leucocephala + 67% C. plectostachyus. A completely randomized design with four replicates was used. Static closed stainless-steel chambers were used to obtain gas samples at 0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes. Environmental temperature, pH, humidity, nitrate and ammonium contents in the soil were recorded. Data were analyzed with the statistical program SAS 9.0. The N2O emission flux (μg/m2/h) between treatments did not present significant differences. The emission peak was observed on the fourth day of sampling in the treatments (A: 17.49, B: 23.71 and C: 22.88 μg N2O N m2/h). In addition, there was a positive correlation between the N2O flux and soil moisture. The increase in the amount of L. leucocephala in the diet of the animals did not influence the emission of N2O, due to the concentration of urea in the urine. However, a positive correlation with soil moisture was observed. © 2023, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cattle production in Colombia has an important social and economic role but causes considerable environmental impacts, such as deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions by ruminants, particularly methane. Thus, technological innovations aimed at reducing these impacts must focus on both economic and environmental sustainability. Silvo-pastoral systems (SPS) offer productivity increases while generating environmental benefits and ecosystem services and are therefore at the center of debate around sustainable production alternatives. The objective of this article is to evaluate the economic-environmental performance of two proposed SPS for a cattle fattening system for the Colombian context: (i) Urochloa brizantha cv. Toledo and (ii) Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman, both in association with Leucaena leucocephala trees for browsing and shade provision. They are compared with the respective base scenarios of only using the grasses in monocultures. The study consists of a financial analysis, which estimates potential profitability increases in beef production in the SPS, and an environmental evaluation, which estimates the monetary values of microclimatic regulation and reduction of methane emissions. The value of methane emission reductions is then integrated into a combined economic-environmental evaluation. Results show that both SPS improve the profitability indicators of the production system and reduce the probability of economic loss. Likewise, the reduction of methane emissions in the SPS is estimated at US$6.12 per cattle, and the economic value of microclimatic regulation at US$2,026 per hectare. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Potentially toxic elements (PTE) in soil like copper (Cu) have been common in agricultural and mining areas worldwide. The sustainable remediation of these areas has been shown to have high socio-environmental relevance and phytoremediation is one of the green technologies to be considered. The challenge is to identify species that are tolerant to PTE, and to assess their phytoremediation potential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological response of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and to determine the species tolerance and phytoremediation potential to concentrations of Cu in the soil (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/dm3). The photosynthetic rate was not affected, while the content of chlorophylls decreased as Cu concentrations increased. There was an increased in stomatal conductance and water use efficiency from the treatment of 300. The root biomass and the length were bigger than the shoots, in the treatments above 300. Cu accumulation was greater in the roots than in the shoot of the plants, thus, the Cu translocation index to the shoot was lower. The ability to absorb and accumulate, mainly, Cu in the roots, allowed the development and growth of plants, since the parameters of photosynthesis and biomass accumulation were not affected by the Cu excess. This accumulation in the roots is characterized as a strategy for the phytostabilization of Cu. Therefore, L. leucocephala is tolerant to the Cu concentrations evaluated and has a potential phytoremediation of Cu in the soil. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Re-vegetation or natural succession of plant species is an important factor of soil development in postmining overburden dumps. As the parent material (sedimentary rocks and regolith) is more or less uniform in the dump, the topographic position and vegetation are the major factors that affects the mine soil quality. Accordingly, this study was designed for a relative evaluation of the influence of dump topographical position (crest, backslope, toeslope) and tree species (Azadirachta indica, Cassia siamea, and Leucaena leucocephala) on soil quality. Trees growing on the toeslope of the dump were significantly taller with larger diameter at breast height than those at backslope or crest. Soil moisture, pH, total S, available P, and Fe content were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by topographical position of the dump. All these properties were higher in the toeslope, except S in the crest. Tree species affected all the soil properties, except electrical conductivity and Mn. Organic carbon content was significantly lower for the nitrogen fixer L. leucocephala (2.03 %) than A. indica (3.30 %) or C. siamea (3.39 %). Soil dehydrogenase activity (39.79 mg TPF/24hr/kg) and microbial biomass carbon (286 µg/g) was higher under L. leucocephala, and C. siamea, respectively. Based on redundancy analysis (RDA), 87.5 % of the data variation is explained by the tree species, whereas, only 12.5 % by the topography. Principal component analysis revealed that C. siamea contributes significantly for the variation in soil properties of the dump. Re-vegetated plant species are a dominant factor of soil development in post mining dump than the topographical position. C siamea and the toeslope are closely associated with soil microbial biomass carbon. It is recommended to plant C. siamea with relatively higher planting density in crest and backslope than toeslope of the dump. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Gayo coffee has been the main commodity of the Gayo tribe, including the Mude Nosar, as local farmers. One of the ways to cultivate Gayo coffee is through an agroforestry system. However, limited reports on the tree species composition and its management in Gayo coffee-based agroforestry need to be explored. This study aims i) to identify the tree species composition and structure, as well as 2) to analyze the management of Gayo coffee-based agroforestry system in Mude Nosar Village. The method used plot establishment for vegetation analysis and interviewed the Gayo coffee farmers. The results showed that the number of tree species at all growth stages was 26 species. The highest Important Value Index (IVI) at the understory and sapling level in order was rumput kerbau (Paspalum conjugatum) and Gayo coffee (Coffea arabica), while at the seedling, pole, and tree levels were dominated by lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala). The local farmers often use lamtoro as a shade tree for Gayo coffee in the agroforestry system. The species diversity index (H') showed low values at all tree growth levels. The horizontal structure of the tree stand showed an inverted J curve, meaning that the regeneration rate was normal. The vertical structure of the tree stand belongs to strata C and D. The local farmers have applied good Gayo coffee management practices through an agroforestry system, including land and seed preparation, planting, maintenance, and harvesting techniques. The management of Gayo coffee using an agroforestry system impacts the ecological, economic, and social aspects. © 2023, Pusat Penelitian Lingkungan Hidup - Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat Institut Pertanian Bogor (PPLH-LPPM IPB).

AB  - Background: Leucaena leucocephala is a useful multipurpose tree species for agroforestry systems, but traditional seeded cultivars often become weedy and invasive. A seedless hybrid cultivar, ‘KX4-Hawaii’, offers a potential solution to this problem. However, relevant agronomic information and information on the performance of ‘KX4-Hawaii’ under varying growth conditions is required. The goal of this research was to evaluate ‘KX4-Hawaii’ as a source of agricultural biomass in Barbados, a small island developing state with limited arable land. Methods: ‘KX4-Hawaii’ air layers were imported into Barbados to create stock trees. Air layering was used to create propagation material and a field study was established with a ‘KX4-Hawaii’ hedgerow planted as a field border. Three plant spacings (50, 75, and 100 cm) were evaluated and data on the growth and biomass yields of the trees were collected at 4-month intervals. Precipitation data were used to investigate climatic effects on ‘KX4-Hawaii’ productivity. Results: ‘KX4-Hawaii’ was successfully propagated via air layers and could be planted directly in the field with irrigation. All recorded growth and biomass yields were correlated with precipitation. However, the woody (lignified stems and branches) biomass was more responsive to precipitation than the green (leaves and green tender stems) biomass and made up a large fraction of the total biomass produced. ‘KX4-Hawaii’ was productive even under drought conditions and biomass yields per meter of hedgerow increased with closer spacings. Of the tested spacing treatments, 75 cm was optimum for a 4-month pruning interval under the conditions seen in Barbados as it produced similar yields to the 50 cm spacing treatment but would require less propagation material.

AB  - Lignin extraction from bark can maximize the utilization of biomass waste, offer cost-effectiveness, and promote environmental friendliness when employed as an adhesive material in bark particleboard production. Particles of fine (0.2 to 1.0 mm), medium (1.0 to 2.5 mm), and coarse (2.5 to 12.0 mm) sizes, derived from the bark of Leucaena leucocephala, were hot-pressed using a heating plate at 175°C for 7 min to create single-layer particleboards measuring 320 mm × 320 mm × 10 mm, targeting a density of 700 kg/m3. Subsequently, the samples were trimmed and conditioned at 20°C and 65% relative humidity. In this study, we compared bark particleboard bonded with urea formaldehyde (UF) adhesive to fine-sized particleboard bonded with demethylated lignin adhesive. The results indicated that bark particleboards utilizing demethylated lignin and UF adhesives exhibited similar qualities. Coarse particleboard showed differences in modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), while medium-sized particles exhibited significant variations in moisture content (MC) and water absorption (WA). Furthermore, the thickness swelling of coarse and medium-sized particles under wet and oven-dried conditions exhibited notable distinctions. Overall, the demethylated lignin adhesive extracted from L. leucocephala bark demonstrated similar quality to UF adhesive, with particle size correlating inversely to the strength of the bark particleboard. © 2024, Tech Science Press.

AB  - Plant-derived phenylpropanoids, in particular phenylpropenes, have diverse industrial applications ranging from flavors and fragrances to polymers and pharmaceuticals. Heterologous biosynthesis of these products has the potential to address low, seasonally dependent yields hindering ease of widespread manufacturing. However, previous efforts have been hindered by the inherent pathway promiscuity and the microbial toxicity of key pathway intermediates. Here, in this study, we establish the propensity of a tripartite microbial co-culture to overcome these limitations and demonstrate to our knowledge the first reported de novo phenylpropene production from simple sugar starting materials. After initially designing the system to accumulate eugenol, the platform modularity and downstream enzyme promiscuity was leveraged to quickly create avenues for hydroxychavicol and chavicol production. The consortia was found to be compatible with Engineered Living Material production platforms that allow for reusable, cold-chain-independent distributed manufacturing. This work lays the foundation for further deployment of modular microbial approaches to produce plant secondary metabolites. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - This research is an alternative technology to support a green economy for environmental sustainability. This paper was performed to reveal the relation between seed briquettes inoculated with the fungi of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in direct seeding of C. pentandra and L. leucocephala seedlings on marginal land in Parungpanjang, Bogor, Indonesia. A randomized block design was used in this research with three blocks and found that seed briquettes with AMF and DSE inoculated have significantly influenced the survival of seedlings of both species 12 months after planting. Direct sowing with seed briquette inoculated with AMF (48%) produced the highest seedling survival in C. pentandra, followed by seed briquette injected with Dendrothyrium sp. CPP1.1.4 (44.5%) in L. leucocephala. In C. pentandra and L. leucocephala, seed briquettes increased seedling survival compared to direct sowing without briquettes. Seedling growth was considerably impacted by AMF and DSE inoculations in L. leucocephala but not in C. pentandra. AMF and DSE can improve the height and diameter of direct-seeded L. leucocephala seedlings. Our research found that using seed briquettes and applying DSE has a high potential for increasing the success of direct seeding in assisting various reforestation programs in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background. Allergic respiratory diseases are prevalent in the Philippines, with allergic rhinitis and asthma occurring at 20% and 8.7% of the population, respectively. The diagnosis of respiratory allergies is achieved by a combination of patient history and different screening tools, especially for the identification of the allergic triggers such as allergy skin prick test (SPT) and serum-specific IgE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (sIgE ELISA). The Philippines, being a tropical country, have a wide variety of plant species with potential to produce allergenic pollen grains. Knowledge of the sensitization profiles of Filipino allergic patients to our local pollen allergens is currently limited. Objectives. The aim of this study is to determine the sensitization profile of patients with respiratory allergies (allergic rhinitis and/or asthma) through the allergy skin prick test (SPT) using allergenic local pollen extracts. It also aimed to determine if there is a positive agreement between the SPT and sIgE ELISA positivity rate and whether the results have relationship with the pollen purity and the protein content of the extracts. Methods. Pollen allergens were extracted from Amaranthus spinosus (pigweed), Mimosa pudica (makahiya), Tridax procumbens (wild daisy), Imperata cylindrica (cogon), Oryza sativa (rice), Pennisetum polystachion (foxtail grass), Sorghum halepense (Johnson grass), Albizia saman (acacia), Cocos nucifera (coconut), Leucaena leucocephala (ipil-ipil), and Mangifera indica (mango). SPT was performed at the Allergy Clinic of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital on patients with allergic rhinitis and/or bronchial asthma. Blood samples were collected from patients who developed wheal diameters of 3 mm or more than the negative control. Sera were tested against the same pollen extracts using ELISA. Results. Of the one hundred sixty-five (165) patients who submitted for skin prick test, 129 showed positive SPT results to the pollen extracts. Weeds were the most sensitizing (51.9%-58.1%). Blood samples were collected from these patients and tested for sIgE ELISA and among them, 71 were positive in the sIgE ELISA. Highest sensitization rates in sIgE ELISA were found in coconut, pigweed, Johnson grass, and rice. The highest positive agreements or the proportion of patients with positive sIgE ELISA among those with positive SPT were in coconut, followed by Johnson grass, pigweed, and rice. Most of the pollen sensitized patients on SPT are polysensitized. Conclusion. SPT is a safe, simple, and rapid method for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy. The lower number of positive patients in sIgE ELISA may be attributed to the low serum IgE levels and low quantities of effectual allergen components in extracts. Results of both SPT and ELISA must be correlated with a patient's clinical history, particularly the patient’s exposures, and physical examination. Copyright: © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, an invasive toxic tree species, has threatened the survival of native plants in the Hengchun Peninsula, southern Taiwan. Due to the small-to-medium diameter, the utilization and processing of L. leucocephala is highly restricted, while its discarding accelerates carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere. Biochar, produced from the pyrolysis of biomass under an inert atmosphere, is considered an effective carbon sequestration technique with high stability, which is important for long-term carbon storage and soil improvement. L. leucocephala biomass and montmorillonite were co-pyrolyzed under inert conditions, aiming to investigate the effects of different pyrolysis temperatures and montmorillonite blending ratios on biochar yield and carbon retention. Results showed improved biochar yield and carbon retention with increasing montmorillonite addition. Thermogravimetric analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated enhanced stability of the modified biochars. The production of modified L. leucocephala biochar represents a promising technique for carbon dioxide sequestration and biochar stabilization, enabling the development of L. leucocephala utilization approaches. © 2024, North Carolina State University.

AB  - In this study, four experimental treatments were evaluated: (T1) alfalfa hay + concentrate, (50:50%, DM); (T2) alfalfa hay + Leucaena leucocephala + concentrate, (30:20:50%, DM); (T3) alfalfa hay + prickly pear + concentrate, (30:20:50%, DM); and (T4) alfalfa hay + Leucaena leucocephala + prickly pear + concentrate, (30:10:10:50%, DM). NH3-N concentrations in T2 and T4 decreased when replaced with alfalfa hay in 20 and 10%, respectively. Treatments did not affect the concentration of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) between T3 and T4 (p > 0.05), while the concentrations among T1 and T2 were different (p < 0.05). T2 showed a reduction of 25.5% in the methane production when compared to T1 (p < 0.05). The lowest concentrations of protozoa were observed in T2 and T4, which contained Leucaena leucocephala (T2) and Leucaena leucocephala + prickly pear (T4) (p < 0.05). The highest concentration of total methanogens was recorded in T1 and was different in T2, T3, and T4 (p < 0.05). Leucaena leucocephala, at an inclusion percentage of 20%, decreased the methane when compared to T1, whereas prickly pear increased methane production in relation to T1. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most challenging noncommunicable diseases, as it causes significant costs for medical treatment as well as high morbidity and mortality rates. Dietary plants with antidiabetic properties have been explored as an alternative to synthetic medicines to treat DM because of their safety and nutrition. Hence, the objective of the present study was to determine the inhibitory activities of twenty commonly consumed Thai culinary vegetables against α-glucosidase and α-amylase. All vegetables were extracted using deionized water, ethanol, and hexane at 150 rpm and 30°C for 24 hours. The enzyme inhibitory activities were performed using a colorimetric assay. Diverse results for α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities were found for all vegetable extracts. The most potent anti-α-glucosidase activity was obtained from the ethanolic extract of Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 13.39 ± 0.14 μg/mL, followed by the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Polygonum odoratum Lour with IC50 of 25.60 ± 0.42 and 49.03 ± 0.72 μg/mL, respectively. All the samples exhibited mixed, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibition. It can be concluded that the α-glucosidase and α-amylose inhibitory effects of the investigated extracts may be an indicator of antidiabetic potency, and these extracts might potentially be beneficial as functional components for postprandial hyperglycemia treatment.  © 2024 Khakhanang Ratananikom et al.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from Ethiopian agriculture are significantly increasing, with the largest share is from enteric fermentation and manure left on pasture. An investigation was conducted to evaluate the anti-nutrient composition and effect of commonly used medicinal plant extracts on enteric methane emission from fibrous feeds using maize stover as substrate feed. Total phenols, flavonoid, tannin and essential oil contents were analyzed using established standards. Effects of leaf extracts of Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, three varieties of Cymbopogon citratus (Cymbopogon citratus-I, Cymbopogon citratus java and Cymbopogon citratus upper awash), Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa stenopetala, three varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosmarinus officinalis I, Rosmarinus officinalis II and Rosmarinus officinalis III) and Thyme schimperi, seed of three Coriandrum sativum varieties (Coriandrum sativum Batu, Coriandrum sativum Tulu and Coriandrum sativum Waltai) and root of Echinops kebericho on total gas production, digestibility and methane production of maize stover were investigated at different doses using the standard procedures. The results indicated that leaf extracts of Acacia nilotica had the highest (P < 0.001) total phenolic and total tannin contents. Compared to other evaluated plant species, all varieties of Cymbopogon citratus had the highest (P < 0.001) flavonoid content. Significantly high (P < 0.001) essential oil content was observed in Rosmarinus officinalis II than other varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis and other plant species. Significant reduction (P < 0.001) of methane production was observed with extracts of Cymbopoon citratus java (22.5 % less methane than the control) and thyme schimperi (16.7 % less methane than the control) at dose of 50 mg/kg DM. There was also significant (P < 0.001) interaction effect between plant species and dose rates at 50 mg/kg DM for both plant species. It can be concluded that the use of 50 mg/kg DM of Cymbopoon citratus java and Thyme schimperi extract to maize stover reduced methane production without negatively affecting feed digestibility. Further studies are necessary to examine the storability of the extracts in different time durations and evaluate their effects in vivo with animals. © 2023

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematodes, including Haemonchus (H.) contortus, have a notable impact in terms of impaired production, high fatalities, and substantial economic losses, affecting small ruminants in tropical countries, including Pakistan. The irrational use of synthetic chemicals has fueled anthelmintic resistance, particularly in H. contortus, as a formidable challenge, prompting a search for alternative treatment strategies. This study evaluated the anthelmintic potential of leaf extracts of three forage plants, including Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa oleifera, and Acacia ampliceps, against various developmental stages of H. contortus. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of secondary metabolites in the extracts. In vitro assays were performed to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of the extracts on the inhibition of egg hatching, larval paralysis, and adult worm motility following the guidelines of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology, while Albendazole was used as a positive control and PBS as a negative control. The highest concentrations of tannins and flavonoids in Acacia ampliceps and phenolic compounds in Leucaena leucocephala were detected in the extracts as major secondary metabolites. All the tested extracts showed significant time- and dose-dependent responses to various stages of H. contortus. The ED50 values showed that the lowest dose of Leucaena leucocephala (0.285), Moringa oliefera (0.81), and Acacia ampliceps (0.245) inhibited egg hatching and larval and adult motility, respectively. Extracts of Leucaena leucocephala exhibited significant inhibition of egg hatching (70.3%), whereas Moringa oliefera showed maximum percent inhibition (66.6) of larval motility. These findings suggest that these plants, traditionally used by local healers in Pakistan, may possess antiparasitic properties, encouraging further studies on the relationship between phytochemicals, extraction methods, and in vivo trials to explore their anthelmintic efficacy. © 2024 University of Agriculture.

AB  - Substances produced by plants have huge importance regulating multiple functions as germination, development promoter/ enhancer, yield increaser and activator of plant defense system against diseases and pests. Due to diversity, each plant species produces different compounds and in different concentrations. This research evaluated the role of 20 plants extracts obtained from different plant species or plant tissues on seed germination and seedlings establishment of maize and lettuce, in concentration of 5%, 10% or 20%. For this, two experiments were carried out, the first analyzing 20 plant extracts and the effects on germination percentage and root and shoot length based on the germination test for the two species. The second was carried out in a greenhouse, in a completely randomized design with three and ten repetitions for maize and lettuce, respectively, using only the three extracts with the best results from the first experiment. Seedling height and seedling dry matter were evaluated. To germination test most of extracts showed negative or no effects in both species. Only Conyza bonariensis at 5% and Richardia brasiliensis at 5% and 20% had positive effects on early seedling growth, increasing the seedlings length for maize seedlings. To seedlings establishment, Conyza bonariensis, Leucaena leucocephala and Richardia brasiliensis extracts did not show statistical difference to shoots height but increased the dry mass of shoots and roots. The results demonstrated that these plants extract have potential as growth promoters and can be a good option to a better seedling growth and establishment, collaborating to a more effective agriculture. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Introduction: Sandalwood (Santalum album L.) is categorized as vulnerable in the IUCN Red list and is also an industrially important tree species valued for its heartwood and aromatic oil. Sandalwood is a semi-root parasite tree that relies on its host plants for its water and nutrient requirements. Therefore, there is need to understand the growth and physiological interactions between sandalwood and its hosts. Methods: Sandalwood were planted with ten different host species viz., Syzygium cumini, Punica granatum, Phyllanthus emblica, Melia dubia, Leucaena leucocephala, Dalbergia sissoo, Casuarina equisetifolia, Citrus aurantium, Azadirachta indica and Acacia ampliceps to assess the interactive effect on the change in growth and physiology of both sandalwood and host tree species. Results: The findings revealed that sandalwood grown with hosts D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia showed higher growth performance, while among hosts, S. cumini, followed by C. aurantium and L. leucocephala, showed better growth and physiobiochemical traits. The stepwise regression analysis and trait modeling indicated that the six traits, namely, plant height, photosynthetic rate, relative water content, water potential, intercellular CO2 concentration, and total soluble protein, contributed greater growth in the sandalwood, while four traits, namely, water potential, osmotic potential, leaf area, and total soluble protein, contributed greater growth in the host species. The traits modeling study predicted greater growth of sandalwood with the hosts D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia, whereas among host species, prediction revealed greater growth of S. cumini and C. aurantium. Discussion: The study concluded that host–parasite interaction modulated the growth and physiological processes in both sandalwood and hosts and sandalwood plantations can be successfully developed with the hosts D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia.

AB  - Legume tree One of the crops that may function as a viable source of animal feed and be utilized for land reclamation on former mining sites. Ex-tin mining land, which is widely spread in Indonesia, has the potential to transform to productive agricultural land, as long as the land is given sufficient inputs through land rehabilitation. The legume tree has drought resistance, hence limiting its potential for development on many types of land, including post-tin mining areas in the Bangka Tengah District of Bangka Island. The objective of this research is to assess the adaptation of two legume tree species in post-tin mining environments. The research was completed throughout the period from 2017 to 2020. Experiments using Randomized block design (RBD) with two different species of treatments, were repeated a total of five times. Two species tested were (1) Leucaena leucocephala cv Taramba, and (2) Indigofera zollingeriana. Data growth and yield components are harvested every three months and yield is subjected to analysis using the Duncan test at a significance level of 5 %. The research result indicated that all of the tested two species of legume tree were well-adapted to post-tin mining in Bangka Tengah District, Bangka Island. The fresh yield of L.leucocephala cv Taramba was higher (9.1 %) than I.zollingeriana but the quality was similar, so the two species can be developed on post-tin mining areas as forage material for an animal in Central Bangka District, Bangka Island. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Diabetes management through dietary intervention has gained significant interest, particularly in the use of natural plant-based inhibitors of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion. The objective of this study was to assess the inhibitory effects of ten Thai culinary vegetables on α-glucosidase and α-amylase, including Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum), holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum), star gooseberry (Phyllanthus acidus), galangal (Alpinia galanga), bamboo grass (Tiliacora triandra), Turkey berry (Solanum torvum), cassod tree (Senna siamea), dill (Anethum graveolens L.), noni (Morinda citrifolia), and pearl wattle (Leucaena leucocephala). All vegetables were extracted using deionized water at a 1: 10 ratio in an ultrasonic bath operating at 350 W and a frequency of 50 Hz for 30 minutes. The α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the vegetable extracts ranged from 13.42 ± 0.23% to 79.84 ± 0.47%, while the inhibitory activities against α-amylase were relatively modest, ranging from 4.82 ± 3.32% to 27.49 ± 1.67%. Cassod tree exhibited the highest α-glucosidase inhibition with the lowest IC50 at 126.38 ± 0.98 μg/mL, followed by galangal (203.17 ± 1.05 μg/mL) and holy basil (1,240 ± 20.31 μg/mL), respectively. These results may hold promise for encouraging the consumption of vegetables as a strategy for diabetes management through the targeting of key enzyme inhibition.  © 2024 Khakhanang Ratananikom et al.

AB  - There are no recommended methods for obtaining rumen degradable protein (RDP) values of tropical foliage to meet ruminant feed quality standards. Different methods have produced different RDP values, prompting this study to compare and adjust values of RDP in tropical foliage obtained using both in situ and in vitro methods. Nine types of tropical foliages (Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Calliandra calothyrsus, Indigofera zollingeriana, Moringa oleifera, Calopogonium mucunoides, Arachis hypogaea, Sesbania grandiflora, and Arachis pintoi) were analyzed for their chemical composition (ash, crude protein (CP), crude fiber (CF), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) using proximate analysis, Van Soest's fiber fraction, and Cornell protein fraction. The samples were then evaluated for their degradation characteristics, including dry matter degradation (DMD), organic matter degradation (OMD), and RDP in rumen using 1) conventional or first-stage in vitro rumen fermentation technique, 2) modification of the first-stage in vitro method, and 3) in situ method. The evaluation was performed in three consecutive runs using a completely randomized design for chemical analysis and a randomized complete block design for degradation study. The result shows that I. zollingeriana, M. oleifera, L. leucocephala, and G. sepium are among the best tropical foliage for ruminants due to their higher CP, DMD, OMD, and RDP values resulting from lower CF, NDF and ADF values. C. calothyrsus, with its high CP and low fiber, resulted in DMD, OMD and RDP values but its high tannin content in the foliage may be a limiting factor. Conventional and in situ produced similar degradation characteristics, significantly higher than in vitro modification. It is recommended to cultivate I. zollingeriana, M. oleifera, L. leucocephala, and G. sepium for ruminant protein supplements, and it is suggested to use standard in vitro to obtain a precise RDP value of tropical foliages. © 2023, Unique Scientific Publishers.

AB  - A novel micro-mesoporous activated carbon (SBL AC-700) is synthesized from subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) sawdust waste by direct single-stage physical activation at 700 °C for 1 h for carbon capture applications. The synthesized AC is characterized to explore various physiochemical properties like elemental composition, surface morphology and crystallinity, presence of functional groups, surface area, pore size, and pore volume. Additionally, emphasis is given to exploring the thermophysical aspects of the novel AC, the literature regarding which is scarce in the open domain. The CO2 adsorption study is carried out for a 0–1 bar pressure for temperatures ranging from 0 to 75 °C. The analysis revealed that the AC possesses a surface area of 590 m2/g and pore volume and width of 0.27 cm3/g and 1.85 nm, corresponding to a 70% microporosity with a well-developed porous structure. At 25 °C and 1 bar, a CO2 uptake of 40.54 cm3/g is achieved, corresponding to an increment of 6–202% compared to other commercials, chemically and physically activated carbons. Moreover, SBL AC-700 has a thermal conductivity of 0.095 W/m K, 8–131% higher than other benchmarks ACs and much lower specific heat of 0.82 kJ/kg K corresponding to lesser regeneration energy requirements. Experimental data are fitted with various isotherm models, i.e., Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips, R–P, and Toth, out of which R–P and Toth models exhibit the best fit. In continuation, adsorption kinetics is studied to explore the dynamic performance of the SBL AC-700 by using Pseudo-first-order, Pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The in vitro anthelmintic effect of the extracts on Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) of three forage species in the tropical dry forest is known; however, there is no information about the effects of the extract partitions, nor their chemical composition. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the in vitro ovicidal activity of H. contortus in extract partitions of the species Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Pithecellobium dulce, and to identify the compounds present in the extract partitions with the highest activity by employing ultra HPLC Quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry. Four extract partitions, hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and hydroethanolic from the three forage species were assessed in an inhibition of egg hatching (IEH) assay. The extract partitions with the highest anthelmintic activity (AA) were subjected to analysis, from which the tentative identification of the compounds was established. The extract partitions, including dichloromethane from Gliricidia sepium, ethyl acetate from Leucaena leucocephala, and hydroethanolic from Pithecellobium dulce showed a greater anthelmintic effect, with IC50 values of 0.39, 0.86, and 0.27 mg/mL for the IEH, respectively. Metabolites with in vitro AA potential included flavonoids, fatty acid esters, hydroxycinnamic acids, organic oxygenated compounds of the benzene class and substituted derivatives, phenolic glycosides, and phenols. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Understanding interactive effect of agroecology explained by rainfall, temperature, elevation, and biochemical composition of residues on soil microbial abundance and functions is crucial for unraveling soil ecological processes. This study aimed to investigate how agroecology and residue quality influence enzymatic activities, gene abundance, and metabolic quotient (qCO2). A field experiment was conducted using Leucaena leucocephala (LL) (high-quality residue) and Acacia decurrens (AD) (low-quality residue) in soils of highland and midland agroecologies. These residues differed in decomposability, characterized by a ratio of (lignin + polyphenol)/N of 5.0 for high-quality residue versus 21.0 for low-quality residue. Two experimental setups were employed: soil with litter mixture in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes and residues buried in the surface soil using litterbags. Soil samples were collected after 30, 120, and 270 days of incubation and analyzed for biochemical properties, enzyme activities, and the abundance of nitrifying and total archaea and bacteria. Soil respiration was also measured at different intervals in the field. qCO2 was calculated using microbial biomass (MBC) and daily respiration (DCO2). Linear mixed model (P<0.05) revealed that combined factors of agroecologies and residue qualities affected enzymatic activities, microbial abundance, soil properties, and qCO2. Agroecological differences exerted a greater influence than residue qualities. Positive and negative significant correlations (P<0.05, r = 0.27 to 0.67) were found between different C and N pools as well as enzymatic activities. Positive correlations (P<0.05) were observed between the abundance of total bacteria, total archaea, and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria versus leucine-aminopeptidases. qCO2 was influenced more by β-xylosidase, leucine-aminopeptidases, and thermolysin-like neutral metalloproteases (TLP) than by β-D-glucosidase and β-D-cellobiohydrolase. Leucine-aminopeptidases and TLP were identified as rate-limiting factors for protein and peptide decomposition, while β-xylosidase controlled hemicellulose degradation. In summary, this study provides insights into the intricate relationships between agroecology, residue quality, enzymatic activities, and microbial communities, shedding light on key processes governing soil ecological functions.  © 2024 Birhanu Agumas et al.

AB  - Dengue fever (DF) occurs worldwide and is a global health threat due to high mortality and morbidity, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. The World Health Organization is very concerned about this disease as it affects a large part of the population. About 2.5 billion people are at risk of contracting the dengue virus (DENV). DENV affects over 100 countries, including Europe and the US. Dengue fever is the most common viral disease. There are four different DENV serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), but DENV-5 serotypes have now also been found. DENV is transmitted from person to person by the bites of infected female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Unfortunately, there is no effective approved treatment for dengue and no vaccine to treat the viral infection. Researchers have turned to medicinal plants in search of natural compounds that can be used as a treatment for dengue fever. Therefore, focus is on medicinal plant extracts, which may be more effective, safer, and less toxic than synthetic drugs. Current research indicates that natural foods represent a rich potential source of novel compounds against dengue fever. From 1997 to 2012, 31 species from 24 families such as Cryptonemia crenulata, Flagellaria indica, Hippophae rhamnoides, Cladosiphon okamuranus, Castanospermum austral, Quercus lusitanica, Rhizo, Euphorbia hirta, Kaempferia parviflora, Leucaena leucocephala, Chondrus crispus, Gigartinaceae Lambda, Andrographis paniculata, Azadirachta indica, Mimosa scabrella, Momordica charantia, Andropogon citratus, Carica papaya, Cladogynos orientalis, Curcuma longa, Cymbopogon citratus, Lippia alba, Meristiella gelidium, Piper retrofractum, Psidium guajava, Ocimum Saintum, Phyllanthus urinaria, known to be active against dengue fever, were described in 61 studies. From these 11 species, about ten phytochemicals have been isolated, among which there are compounds Andrographolide, 4hydroxypanduratin A, panduratin A, Turmerone, Castanospermine, Lambda, carrageenans, Galactomanan, Kappa carrageenan, and so on that could potentially be used to treat dengue fever. Flaviviruses were found to be resistant to crude extracts and essential oils derived from 31 different species. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the nematocidal effect of four hydroalcoholic extracts (HAE) of Brosimum alicastrum (HAE-Ba), Guazuma ulmifolia (HAE-Gu), Erythrina americana (HAE-Ea) and Leucaena leucocephala (HAE-Ll) against Haemonchus contortus. The tests of egg hatching inhibition (EHI) and larval (infective larvae) mortality were used. The treatments were HAEs at concentrations of 6.25-50 mg/mL for EHI and 25-100 mg/mL for larval mortality, ivermectin (5 mg/mL, positive control) and distilled water (negative control). Data were analyzed using an ANOVA and treatments with a concentration-dependent effect were subjected to a regression analysis to determine lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90). In addition, a phytochemical analysis was performed on the extracts to identify the presence of the main secondary metabolites. The best ovicidal and larvicidal activity was observed in HAE-Gu with 96.78 % EHI at 6.25 mg/mL and 57.2 % larval mortality at 75 mg/mL. Followed by HAE-Ba showing 90 % EHI at 6.25 mg/mL and 58.0 % larval mortality at 75 mg/mL. The LC50 and LC90 of HAE-Gu on EHI were 2.7 and 4.4 mg/mL, respectively. While the LCs of this same extract on larvae were LC50= 64 and LC90= 125 mg/mL. The phytochemical analysis indicates that all extracts contain tannins, coumarins, flavonoids and terpenes. The fodder species G. ulmifolia and E. americana could be candidate plants for the control of H. contortus. © 2023 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria. All rights reserved.

AB  - In addition to chemical composition, modern formulations of ruminant rations also require data on nutrient degradation of feed ingredients in the rumen. It is related to the synchronization of nutrient requirements for rumen microbial protein synthesis and nutrient bypass for livestock production. This study aimed to determine the chemical composition and nutrient degradation kinetics from several tropical tree legume leaves using in situ method. This study was arranged based on a Completely Randomised Design with five treatments (different types of legume leaves) and six replications. Five types of local tree legume leaves were tested, namely Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Sesbania grandiflora (SG), Bauhinia purpurea (BP), Acacia mangium (AM), and Samanea saman (SS). Approximately 5 g of dried ground samples that passed through a 3 mm screen size were put into nylon bags. The bags were subsequently incubated in the rumen of two fistulated male Ongole crossbred cattle for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Parameters observed in this study were the actual degradation of dry matter (DDM), organic matter (DOM), crude protein (DCP) and their kinetic degradation profiles and effective degradation. The results showed that the chemical composition and characteristics in situ varied. S. saman had the highest crude protein content, followed by L. leucocephala, S. grandiflora, B. purpurea, and A. mangium with the values of 26.9%, 26.3%, 24.9%, 17.9%, and 14.3% (dry matter basis), respectively. Sesbania grandiflora had the lowest fiber content (neutral detergent fiber) compared to other samples with a value of 31.35%, then increased in LL SS, BP and AM samples with sequential values of 34.16%, 45.61%, 46.04% (in dry matter basis), respectively. Sesabania grandiflora had the highest effective values of degradation of dry matter, organic matter and crude protein compared to other samples, with values of 60.04%, 61.93% and 64.58%, respectively. It was concluded that each leaf of the tropical tree legume varied in chemical composition and in situ nutrient degradation characteristics. Sesbania grandiflora has the highest effective degradability value of the dry matter, organic matter and crude protein compared to other legume leaves. © 2023 Author(s).

AB  - The present study investigated the use of a biosorbent produced from Leucaena leucocephala pods for the removal of metformin from aqueous solutions. The pods were subjected to chemical and thermal treatments and were referred to as L. leucocephala modified, which was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The parameters investigated in the sorption process were temperature, contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH, and initial metformin concentration. The experimental data were in accordance with the Langmuir isothermal model. The maximum adsorption capacity reached was 56.18 mg g−1 at 313 K. In the kinetic study, stability was achieved in 300 min, with 53.24% removal, and the pseudo-first-order model agreed well with the experimental data. The thermodynamic parameters indicated a spontaneous, favorable, and exothermic reaction. The presence of NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 negatively affected metformin adsorption. Thus, the importance of the study was that a developed material showed promising results in the removal of metformin, particularly because it is an innovative material, and there are no studies in the literature on drug removal using L. leucocephala. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) levels in agricultural soils are increasing because of industrial expansion and pesticide discharge. There are few plants that tolerate heavy metals particularly Cd. NaHS as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor plays a significant role in Cd tolerance by plants reducing its toxicity. The present research was oriented to evaluate the effect of NaHS in Cd and macro-/micronutrient uptake, as well as some physical and chemical parameters in Leucaena leucocephala plants exposed to this metal. Seedlings were grown in a hydroponic system and exposed to 5 ppm of Cd and NaHS at 1, 10, and 100 μM for 3 days. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP/OES) was used to quantify Cd content and macro-/micronutrients in plant tissues. Results show a significant difference (Fisher’s LSD) in radicle length and chlorophyll but did not show effect on carotenoids content. Addition of NaHS to the media shows a significant increase in Cd uptake by root as NaHS concentration in media increased. The maximum Cd uptake (7670 ± 102 mg/kg) was found in the roots of plants exposed to 100 μM of NaHS. A significant reduction in catalase (CAT) activity was observed in the root system, which is due to Cd concentration inside tissues. Results suggested that NaHS helps to decrease the toxic effect of Cd on the growth and development of plants.

AB  - We describe the diverse community of insect herbivores and parasitoids associated with the seeds and fruits of three sympatric Fabaceae species in Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil: Inga vera, Senna multijuga and Leucaena leucocephala. A total of 5353 individual insects, representing 77 different species, were identified via morphology and DNA barcoding. The non-native L. leucocephala had the least diverse natural enemy community (N = 17 species), while two native species, I. vera and S. multijuga, were more diverse (N = 40 and N = 24 species, respectively). Individuals from the insect order Hymenoptera, a group dominated by parasitoid wasps, were the most diverse recovered from our samples in all hosts. Additionally, individual herbivore and parasitoid species were more likely to be found on a single host, with only four out of the 77 species found in more than one plant species. This includes the generalist agricultural pest herbivore, Lasioderma serricorne, found in two species, and three parasitoids connecting native S. multijuga and non-native L. leucocephala communities, hinting at recent host shifts. Furthermore, different host plant traits had complex effects on the herbivore and parasitoid communities, where seed number per fruit promoted a propagating effect on the abundance and richness at both higher trophic levels, whereas seed and fruit weight did not. We highlight the importance of including parasitoids in insect community studies because they are highly diverse and provide important ecosystem services. Additional study of the biology, behaviour and distributions of parasitoids would be advantageous to inform conservation and biological control. © 2023 Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the association of Leucaena leucocephala, and its co-inoculation with a strain of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Claroideoglomus claroideum and a local isolate of rhizobium, on the performance of associated grasses (Bouteloua gracilis, Bouteloua curtipendula and Setaria macrostachya). The mycorrhizal structures and nodulation were also studied. Three independent experiments, one for each grass species, were grown in association with L. leucocephala co-inoculated and non-inoculated, or alone (control treatment). Grasses associated with co-inoculated L. leucocephala produced a greater number of stems than those associated with non- inoculated L. leucocephala. B. gracilis and B. curtipendula grown with co-inoculated L. leucocephala accumulated higher biomass. The concentration of chlorophylls a, b and total chlorophylls in S. macrostachya were favored by the association with L. leucocephala; whereas in B. gracilis such effect was only observed for chlorophyll b. Co-inoculation promoted the development of mycorrhizal structures in the rhizosphere and the number of nodules in roots of L. leucocephala, although the percentage of effective nodules did not reflect differences due to treatments. In conclusion, the association of grasses with L. leucocephala and its inoculation with AMF and local rhizobium isolates not only promotes the development of mycorrhizal structures and nodulation, but also increases growth and the content of photosynthetic pigments in the associated grasses. © 2024 Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales una revista de acceso abierto publicada por el Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit seeds, also known as river tamarind, contain sulfhydryl compounds that exhibit antioxidant effects. However, these seeds also possess a toxic effect from mimosine. In this study, the river tamarind seeds were extracted using a natural deep eutectic solvent (NADES) based UAE. Among six NADES compositions screened, choline chloride-glycerol (ChCl-Gly) and choline chloride-sucrose (ChCl-Suc) were selected to be further optimized using a Box-Behnken Design in the RSM. The optimization of total sulfhydryl content was performed in 17 runs using three variables, namely water content in NADES (39%, 41%, and 43%), extraction time (5, 10, and 15 min), and the liquid-solid ratio (3, 5, and 7 mL/g). The highest concentration of sulfhydryls was obtained from ChCl-Gly-UAE (0.89 mg/g sample) under the conditions of a water content in NADES of 41% (v/v) and a liquid-solid ratio of 3 mL/g for 15 min, followed by that of from ChCl-Suc-UAE extract under the conditions of water content in NADES of 43% (v/v) and the liquid-solid ratio of 3 mL/g for 10 min with total sulfhydryl level was 0.67 mg/g sample. The maceration method using 30% ethanol resulted in the lowest level of sulfhydryls with a value of 0.52 mg/g. The mimosine compounds obtained in the NADES-based UAE (ChCl-Suc and ChCl-Gly) extracts were 4.95 and 7.67 mg/g, respectively, while 12.56 mg/g in the 30% ethanol-maceration extract. The surface morphology of L. leucocephala seed before and after extraction was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of ChCl-Suc and ChCl-Gly in NADES-based UAE is more selective in attracting sulfhydryl compounds than that of 30% ethanol-maceration extraction. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of plant-based coagulant extracted from Leucaena leucocephala seeds compared with alum in removing solids from aquaculture wastewater. Water-extraction method was used to extract the active ingredients from the seeds by dissolving the seeds’ powder in distilled water at 20 g/L concentration, whereas alum was dissolved directly at the same concentration. Operation parameters of jar test including dosage, rapid-mixing speed, and settling time were optimized for the water-extracted seed solution and alum to improve the removal efficiency. The optimum operation parameters for the water-extracted seed solution and alum were dosages of 240 and 320 mg/L respectively, rapid-mixing speed 150 rpm, and settling time 40 min. At the optimum operation parameters, water-extracted seed solution had removal efficiencies of 96.32%, 92.85%, and 86%, whereas alum had removal efficiencies of 99.77%, 99.92%, and 99.92% for turbidity, total suspended solids, and color, respectively. Despite the high efficiency of the water-extracted seed solution, dissolved contaminants such as NO3, PO4, COD, and true color increased owing to the presence of organic matter in the solution. With these results, L. leucocephala seeds had high potential to be used as alternative in removing solids from aquaculture wastewater. Further studies on the extraction of active ingredients should be conducted to increase the removal efficiency and avoid side effects on the contaminants dissolved in the effluent. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.

AB  - Studies have shown that fruits of plants from the Fabaceae family harbour a diverse community of herbivorous insects and their natural enemies. Despite this observation, we still lack information on the specific interactions within these multi-trophic communities. Herein, we describe the food web of insects associated with fruits and seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae), an invasive plant in Brazil, and their relationship with plant traits including seed biomass. We found 17 species of insects distributed across three trophic levels. The main herbivore species sampled was Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae), which was responsible for most of the seed predation and associated with the highest parasitoid biodiversity (N = 10 species). Four other herbivorous species were lower in abundance, including a previously unreported Lepidopteran species with two parasitoids and one hyperparasitoid associated with it. Seeds with more mass promoted an increase in insect abundance, insect species richness, and the number of links and connectivity. We observed two native parasitoid species, Paracrias pluteus and Stenocorse suldamericanos, shift from herbivores on native plants to herbivores on the invasive L. leucocephala, consistent with a potential host shift. However, more investigation is required to ascertain the effects of recent shifts of native insect communities (on native plants) to non-native ones and their consequences on plant fitness. Our study contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of communities and food webs in unknown systems, specifically in fruits of an invasive plant, and provides information about the influence of different plant traits on these communities. © 2023 Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - The ultrafunctional potential of zinc oxide (ZnO) and copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) has generated a great interest in using such metal oxides as remarkable and electroactive nanocomposites in the studies on potentiometry and sensors. These nano-oxides were prepared from the extract of Leucaena leucocephala seeds as an environmentally friendly process. The development of a ZnO/CuO “core-shell mcmninnm-iticocmoconan” coated copper wire film sensor was proposed as a new method for potentiometric determination of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (PSD) in pure and pharmaceutical dosage forms. With the existence of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a polymer with high molecular weight and “o-nitrophenyl octyl ether (o-NPOE) as a solvent mediator”, PSD was combined with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) to produce pseudoephedrine hydrochloride-phosphotungstate (PSD-PT) as a sensing substance. The improved sensor showed a very high sensitivity and selectivity for determining and quantifying the PSD with a linear relationship of 1.0×10-8-1.0×10-2 mol L-1. It was estimated that the regression equation was represented by the EmV = (-58.143) log [PSD] + 526.71. With the proposed sensors, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride could be effectively determined in pure and commercial product forms. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Leaf tissue analysis is a measurement of the levels of elements contained in plant leaves. In this case, the leaves can describe the amount of absorption of a nutrient because most of the assimilation results are collected in them. The nutrients that can be absorbed by plant roots are the amount of nutrients available in the soil. The use of shade trees with different types of sunlight absorption intensity causes the conditions for leaf nutrient absorption in plants to also vary. This research was needed to determine the effect of shade type on the nutrient concentration of nitrogen, (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in the leaves of Arabica coffee plants. This research was carried out at the Koperasi Ribang Gayo Musara, Pantan Musara Village, Pegasing Subdistrict, Central Aceh District, Aceh, and the Agricultural Instrument Standardization Agency (BSIP) Aceh. This research used a non-factorial Randomized Block Design with five treatments where each treatment 4 replications. Treatments consisted of types of shade plants on coffee plants, namely, control/no shade, small lamtoro shade (Leucaena leucocephala ssp. leucocephala), big lamtoro shade (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata), banana shade (Musa paradisiaca L.), avocado shade (Persea americana Mill.). The results showed that shade tree type significantly affect potassium (K) nutrient levels in coffee plant leaves. Coffee plant shaded by big lamtoro had better N, P and K nutrient levels compared to small lamtoro, banana, avocado, and control. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Mlanding tempeh is an indigenous fermented food from lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) seed that uses usar as the inoculum in its production. Lamtoro seed contains antinutritional compounds namely phytic acid and tannin, and toxin compounds namely mimosine. Antinutritional compounds decrease the quality of nutrients in mlanding tempeh. The purpose of the research was to investigate the changes in nutritional compounds, antinutritional and toxin compounds, total phenols, antioxidants activity, dietary fiber and dynamics population of microorganisms in pre-fermentation treatment in lamtoro seed during mlanding tempeh’s production. The analysis was carried out at the pre-fermentation stage, namely before the inoculation process. The result showed the change of nutrient compounds, antinutritional and toxin compounds, total phenols, antioxidants activity, dietary fiber, and dynamics population of microorganisms in pre-fermentation treatment in lamtoro seed during mlanding tempeh’s production. Moisture, protein, and fat content increased, whereas ash, carbohydrate, phytic acid, tannin, and mimosine decreased. The total phenols content, antioxidant activity, and dietary fiber content of lamtoro seed also decreased. Meanwhile, the population of microorganisms (yeast and lactic acid bacteria) increased in pre-fermentation treatment in lamtoro seed during mlanding tempeh’s production. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, previously known as ‘miracle tree’ because of its numerous agroforestry uses has become a serious invasive species in tropical regions. Despite the risks associated with the spread of L. leucocephala, changes in its distribution with respect to climate are poorly understood, particularly in Africa where it has been widely introduced in more than 30 countries. To provide first-line information for the management of L. leucocephala, we examined its potential distribution in Africa using ecological niche modelling. We identified bioclimatic variables that determine the global distribution of L. leucocephala, and calibrated niche models using MaxEnt and species occurrences recorded between 1973 and 2013. The potential distribution of this species was estimated from model projections in Africa based on current and future climatic conditions. We tested the hypothesis of niche conservatism for L. leucocephala by comparing its climatic niche in Africa to that of its native range. Under current conditions, L. leucocephala is constrained between 30° S and 20° N in Africa, with the broadest distribution in East Africa. High rainfall areas in Central Africa with no known records of this species hitherto, were found to be highly suitable for its establishment. We predicted a significant decrement in the extent of areas at risk of invasion by L. Leucocephala under changing climates in Africa. Our results revealed that the study species occupies a similar but non-identical climatic niche in Africa in relation to its native niche. Climate change is likely to impede the spread of L. leucocephala in Africa. © 2023, International Society for Tropical Ecology.

AB  - Salinity is one of the most detrimental abiotic stresses to the productivity of crops. Saline lands can be easily transformed into commercial forest plantations by growing high value tree species. Therefore, present investigation was undertaken to assess the effect of saline irrigation (ECiw ~ 9), including control, and ten different host species (Melia dubia, Dalbergia sissoo, Azadirachta indica, Casuarina equisetifolia, Acacia ampliceps, Citrus aurantium, Punica granatum, Syzygium cumini, Phyllanthus emblica, and Leucaena leucocephala) on growth, physiological processes and salinity tolerance of sandalwood (Santalum album L.). Results revealed that hosts D. sissoo, A. indica, and M. dubia maintained high (p < 0.05) K+ /Na+ ratio and resulted in higher growth of sandalwood under salinity stress. The plant growth traits of sandalwood showed variable trends of decline with different hosts under the same conditions. The biomass of sandalwood decreased by 41–75% under salinity stress; resulting in the substantial differences for salinity tolerance varying from 25 to 59.8%. Sandalwood grown with D. sissoo produced maximum (p < 0.05) biomass under salinity stress as well as depicted higher salinity tolerance. The growth parameters (collar diameter, height, and biomass) of sandalwood exhibited a highly negative (p < 0.05) correlation with Na+ ion under salinity stress. Hosts M. dubia, D. sissoo, and A. indica showed only a slight decline in growth and biomass of sandalwood under salinity stress. Results suggested that sandalwood growth is modulated mainly by host species under both control and salinity stress, and thus have immense potential for cultivation with suitable host in the degraded saline soils. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an environment-friendly technique that uses plants to extract contaminants like metals from soil. This has found application in waste management and possibly in future mining through phytomining. This studywanted to evaluate the metal accumulation of plants, thriving in a nickel laterite mine for Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn anddetermine their potential for phytoremediation or phytomining. The metal accumulation in crops is also highlighted fortheir possible harmful effects to humans. Samples of soil, roots, stems, leaves, and fruits were gathered. The plants wereevaluated based on their metal accumulation in the above-ground part, leaf-to-root ratio, bioaccumulation coefficient(BAC), and translocation factor (TF). The plant Leucaena leucocephala, Pennisetum polystachion, Casuarinacunning hamiana, and Mimosa pudica shows significant accumulation. The crops showed substantial amounts of metalwhich can be harmful to humans. The planting of hyper accumulator plants is recommended for future phytomining application but planting crops is highly discouraged due to possible accumulation of metals which can be harmful for humans. © 2024, IEICES/Kyushu University.

AB  - Elephant grass is the most widely cultivated type of grass by livestock farmers in Indonesia. However, the livestock performance of the elephant grass-feeding system is still low due to the amount of protein lost during the degradation process in the rumen. Provision of plants containing high protein and tannin can reduce protein wastage and increase the digestibility and protein consumption in cattle-fed elephant grass. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of Leucaena leucocephala, Lannea coromondalica, and Gliricidia sepium as substitute leaves on dry matter consumption (DMC) and dry matter digestibility (DMD) of elephant grass basal rations. Four female Kacang goats (12 months old) were arranged in a Latin Square Design with 4 treatments and 4 replications (10 days for adjustment period and 7 consecutive days for data collection). The treatments applied were the levels of three leaves as substitutes for elephant grass basal ration, i.e., R1=Elephant grass 100% (as a control), R2=Elephant grass 60%+Gliricidia sepium 40%; R3=Elephant grass 60%+Leucaena leucocephala 40%; and R4=Elephant grass 60%+ Lannea coromondalica 40%, respectively. The results showed that the substitution leaves of Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, and Lannea cromondalica in the elephant grass feed had a significant effect (P<0.05) on DMC and DMD, respectively. The average of as follows DMC (R1=0.19; R2=0.28; R3=0.29; and R4 0.26 kg/head/day, respectively and DMD was R1=0.91%; R2= 0.89%; R3=0.86%; and R4=0.88% respectively. The substitute of the tannin-containing plants in the elephant grass basal goat rations, on the one hand, could increase the dry matter consumption but lower the digestibility of feed on the other hand. There is a tendency of better value on the digestibility of the inclusion of 40% Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) leaves in basal rations of Elephant grass. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

AB  - The industry of Nyamplung/tamanu (Calophyllum inophyllum) crude oil is developed massively in Indonesia. The by product of this crude oil is called nyamplung kernel cake (NKC). This study was conducted to investigate the chemical compositions, plant secondary metabolites, and in vitro digestibility of NKC as new alternative feed. In chemical compositions, the NKC contained 90.2% dry matter, 7.92% organic matter, 20.1% crude protein, 15.3% ether extract, 53.3% neutral detergent fiber, 38.2% acid detergent fiber, and 15.1% hemicellulose. In plant secondary metabolites, the NKC contained 6.47% total phenol, 1.70% total flavonoid, and 0.90% saponin. The total tannin of NKC was 0.93% consisting of condense tannin at 0.45% and hydrolysable tannin at 0.48%. The chemical compositions of NKC were similar to palm kernel cake (PKC), copra cake (CC), tamarind (Leucaena leucocephala) leaves meal (TLM), gliricida (Glircidia sepium) leaves meal (GLM), and malapari (Pongamia pinnata) kernel cake (MKC). Thus, those feedstuffs were incubated in rumen buffer for 48 h. During ruminal incubation, NKC produced the lowest methane emission without any negative effects on rumen fermentation indices. Moreover, NKC still had a similar digestibility to PKC, CC, and GLM. This study concluded that the NKC can substitute the use of PKC, CC, TLM, GLM, and MKC in the ruminant diet, which can also help to reduce methane emission through in vitro study. © 2023 Fundacion CIPAV.

Unveiling the prevalence of invasive alien plant species in multiple-use zone of Initao-Libertad Protected Landscape and Seascape, Misamis Oriental, Philippines. Biodiversitas 25: 3286-3294. Invasive Alien Plant Species (IAPS) threaten Protected Areas (PAs) globally, causing habitat degradation, biodiversity reduction, and ecosystem disruption. In the Philippines, data on invasive species in PAs is limited. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, abundance, and diversity of IAPS in multiple-use zone of Initao-Libertad Protected Landscape and Seascape (ILPLS), Misamis Oriental, Philippines. Using belt-transect method, a total of 15 nested plots (20×20 m for trees, 5×5 m for herbs and shrubs, and 1×1 m for grasses and lianas) were established. Twenty-nine plant species from 18 families were identified, comprising 18 Native Species (NS), seven Non-Invasive Alien Species (NIAS), and four IAPS. The IAPS identified were Gmelina arborea, Leucaena leucocephala, Lantana camara, and Swietenia macrophylla which had the highest relative abundance of 96.83%. The Shannon-Weiner diversity indices showed very low to low diversity of 0.30 to 2.17, and an unbalanced to semi-balanced species evenness of 0.17 to 0.70. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a significant difference in relative abundance between NS and IAPS (p = 0.01576). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicated significant differences in species diversity and evenness of p = 0.03359 and 0.03343, respectively. These findings are crucial for developing IAPS control strategies in the ILPLS in the future. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil biota have strong effects on plants, but we have a poor understanding of how plant chemistry might modify these effects. We examined the effect of soil biota associated with an exotic invasive tree, Prosopis juliflora, versus that associated with native species, from seven sites across India on conspecifics and two other plant species. We then measured changes in species-specific soil biota effects (identified as plant–soil feedbacks, PSFs) when leaf leachate from P. juliflora or from native plant species was added to soil containing respective live and sterile soil inoculum. We quantified the amino acid L-tryptophan from leaf leachate of P. juliflora, Leucaena leucocephala (another invader), and two native species. We also tested effects of P. juliflora or native species soil inoculum amendment of tryptophan on P. juliflora, P. cineraria and L. leucocephala across seven sites. We then quantified the microbially metabolized derivatives of tryptophan, phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and intermediates after adding tryptophan into P. juliflora and native soils. Soil biota associated with P. juliflora generated positive effects on conspecifics and L. leucocephala, but negative effects on the native congener P. cineraria. When P. juliflora leaf leachate was added to soil with live P. juliflora inoculum, PSFs became more positive for P. juliflora and other species, compared to leaf leachate amended with sterile soil inoculum. Native leaf leachate interacted weakly with soil biota to impact biomass of conspecifics and heterospecifics. There was roughly 10× more tryptophan in the leaf leachate of P. juliflora than in the leaf leachate of other species. Tryptophan generally increased positive PSFs associated with P. juliflora relative to soil biota associated with other plant species. When tryptophan was added to live P. juliflora soil, IAA and its intermediates were produced at five of seven sites, and at four of these sites soil biota from P. juliflora had positive PSFs. Synthesis. These results provide the first experimental evidence that a chemical leached from the leaves of an invader regulates PSFs. Our results indicate that canopy effects and PSFs, which are usually studied independently, can interact in ways that strongly affect conspecifics and neighbouring species. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The current study aimed to explore the traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous communities in Bahawalpur and adjacent regions, Pakistan, to treat a variety of diseases with a particular focus on the usage of ethnomedicinal wild plants. The objective of the study was to collect and evaluate local and indigenous knowledge regarding the quantity, variety, use and management of resources by the people. Data were gathered using Rapid Appraisal Approach (RAA), which involved in-person interviews. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics methods as well as common ethnobotanical analytical techniques viz. use value (UV), relative frequency of citation (RFC), informant consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL), relative importance (RI), frequency index (FI), family use value (FUV), family importance value (FIV), popular therapeutic use value (POPUT), plant part value (PPV), preference ranking (PR), cultural significance index (CSI), rank order priority (ROP) and Jaccard index (JI). A total of 158 plant species from 49 families were identified. The perennial herbs made up 72% of the documented species of therapeutic plants. There were 21 different species in each of the two major plant families i.e., Fabaceae and Poaceae. The maximum ICF were calculated for gonorrhea and paralysis (1.0) and maximum POPUT was calculated for skin disorders (0.088) and cough (0.077), respectively. The maximum UV was found for Rumex crispus (0.57) and RI for Leucaena leucocephala (4.38). Heliotropium crispum had the highest FL value (83%) and is used to treat kidney diseases. Alhagi maurorum had the greatest RFC (0.009) and FI (0.93). Arecaceae (0.45) and Fabaceae (13.39%) had the greatest FUV while Poaceae and Fabaceae had the highest FIV (13.29 for each). Leaves were the most frequently used plant part (35%). Alhagi maurorum (4.0) and Rumex crispus (32.57) had the highest CSI and ROP, respectively. The maximum JI (28.31) was calculated for Cholistan desert. These results showed the local population’s reliance on herbal remedies to treat prevalent illnesses. To demonstrate the viability of species, it′s crucial to emphasize both the use and conservation of these species. Adopting innovative applications, enhancing their value, and prioritizing the protection of multipurpose wild plants in inhabited environments is vital. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This study aimed to enhance nutrient intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation, and blood metabolites in Kacang goats by substituting grass silage with hydroponic maize fodder enriched with fermented compost tea. The compost tea, prepared by fermenting organic compost with sugared water + 40 mL EM4 for 3 days, was used to grow maize fodder hydroponically. Four male Kacang goats (13.05 ± 1.32 kg) were assigned to four dietary treatments in a 4x4 latin square design over four 15-day periods (10 days for adaption, 5 days for data collection). The treatments were: 60% grass silage + 10% Leucaena leucocephala + 30% concentrate (control, FCG0); 30% grass silage + 30% hydroponic maize fodder + 10% L. leucocephala + 30% concentrate (FCG1); 15% grass silage + 45% hydroponic maize fodder + 10% L. leucocephala + 30% concentrate (FCG2); and 60% hydroponic maize fodder + 10% L. leucocephala + 30% concentrate (FCG3). Goats on FCG3 had lower (p<0.05) dry matter intake (152.48 g/day) compared to FCG0 (226.83 g/day). Nutrient digestibility, including organic matter and crude fiber, improved (p<0.05) in FCG3 (77.21% and 66.12%) compared to FCG0 (76.62% and 52.27%). Total volatile fatty acids (VFA) increased in FCG3 (131.54 mM) compared to FCG0 (111.73 mM). However, no significant differences were observed in ruminal ammonia (NH3-N), ruminal pH, or blood metabolites. In conclusion, substituting grass silage with hydroponic maize fodder enriched with fermented compost tea up to 75% of the diet improved digestibility and rumen fermentation without negatively affecting intake, digestibility, or blood metabolites in Kacang goats, suggesting its potential as an alternative feed. However, complete substitution (100%) reduced intake, indicating challenges at higher substitution levels. Copyright © 2024 by Authors, published by Tropical Animal Science Journal.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a fast-growing leguminous biomass with great energetical and value-added chemical compounds potential (saccharides, biogas, bio-oil, etc.). Using the thermogravimetric and derivative thermogravimetric curves, the different trends followed by L. leucocephala during pyrolysis, 0.25 equivalence ratio (ER) of gasification, 0.50 equivalence ratio of gasification and combustion were analyzed, and the activation energies were obtained by Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM) method. Gas samples were collected through adsorption tubes during the gasification at 0.25 ER and 0.50 ER to observe the distribution of the main chemical products in this process by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and were compared with pyrolysis products. It was found that small amounts of oxygen have changes in the kinetics of the process, leading to significant decreases in the activation energy at the beginning of the degradation of components such as cellulose (from 170 to 135 kJ mol−1 at 0.25 conversion at 0.50 ER gasification). The activation energy of lignin disintegration was also reduced (342 kJ mol−1), assimilating the beginnings of gasification processes such as the Boudouard reaction. 0.50 ER gasification is potentially an interesting process to obtain quality bio-oil, since a large amount of hexane is detected (44.96%), and value-added oxygenated intermediates such as alcohols and glycols. Gasification at 0.25 ER, on the other hand, is much more similar to pyrolysis, obtaining a wide variety of short-chain compounds resulting from the disintegration of the main lignocellulosic components, especially ketones such as 1-hydroxypropan-2-one (19.48%), and notable amount of furans and anhydrosugars like d-allose (5.50%). © 2023

AB  - The study was carried out between July and October 2022 at the sub-station of the Faculty of Agriculture Research and Teaching farm to assess the reproductive performance of Archachatina marginata fed the leguminous Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal as feed additive. 208 adult snails were randomly partitioned into 4 treatments and 4 repetitions of 13 comparable snails (weight and size). The treatment T0 (control) received only the experimental diet as described while three other treatments received not only diet but, L. leucocephala leaf meal at 0.25%,0.5% and 0.75% for a period of 12 weeks. In each treatment, every morning, the substrate of each breeding bucket was stirred entirely and minutely to collect the eggs to determine the laying and morphometric characteristics of the eggs. The eggs were then placed 10 cm deep in loose soil substrates until hatching to evaluate the characteristics of the fecundity. The unhatched eggs were opened, and the state of embryonic development observed to determine early embryonic mortality rate and late embryonic mortality. At the end of the experiment, animals of each replicate were sacrificed; the hemolymph was collected determine the total cholesterol and protein. The results showed that the characteristics of reproduction were affected with graded level of L. leucocephala. The highest number of eggs laid (17.29 ± 13.44) and the number of clutches (268.91) was recorded in animals receiving 0.5% and 0.75% L. leucocephala in the diet respectively while the highest value of fecundation rate (95.50 ± 8.80), hatch rate (94.55 ± 9.36), and hatchability (98.99 ± 3.15) was registered in the treatment that received 0.75%. The highest value of total protein and cholesterol was recorded in the same treatment. In conclusion 0.75% of L. leucocephala can be added in the diet of adult snail to increase its reproductive performance. © (2024), (Universidad del Zulia). All rights reserved.

AB  - Our hypothesis is that the total replacement of ground corn grain (GCG) by cactus pear (CP) in association with 70% of leucaena hay (LH) increases dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility and nitrogen metabolism and maintains the feeding behavior of cattle. The objective was to evaluate the effects of inclusion of these feeds on the nutritional parameters and nitrogen metabolism of cattle. Eight steers, average age of 12 months, weight of 267.5 ± 15 kg, were distributed into two simultaneous 4 × 4 Latin squares according to a 2 × 2 factorial scheme, in which the first factor evaluated was different proportions of inclusion of LH (50 or 70% DM basis), and the second factor was the total replacement of GCG with CP. There was lower DM intake in animals fed with 70% LH. There was an interaction between the factors for DM digestibility, in which the animals fed CP did not differ regardless of the inclusion of LH, but for animals without CP, the greater inclusion of LH decreases DM digestibility. The inclusion of CP decreased free water intake. There was an interaction for total water intake (WI), in which the animals fed without CP presented similarity for this, while in the inclusion of CP, the animals fed 70% of LH presented higher WI. Also, lower values of chewing were observed for animals fed with CP. The replacement of GCG with CP improves the efficiency of nitrogen utilization in the rumen. The inclusion of 70% LH depresses intake. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The objective of the present experiment was to determine fatty acids composition of Albizia falcataria (AF), Calliandra calothyrsus (CC), Leucaena leucocephala (LL), and Sesbania grandiflora (SG), both in the leaves and in the in vitro rumen fermentation system. Ground leaf samples of AF, CC, LL and SG were determined for their fatty acid (FA) profiles. The samples (200 mg DM each) were incubated in vitro in a rumen:buffer solution (1:2 v/v ratio) at 39°C for 24 h, either with or without the addition of linseed oil, conducted in four replicates. Following the incubation, the fermentation medium was subjected to fatty acid determination. Results revealed that the order of PUFA contents in the leaves from highest to lowest were CC>LL>SG>AF. Proportion of MUFA was particularly high in CC. Notably, the α-linolenic acid (ALA) concentration within the rumen after the in vitro incubation exhibited in the CC legume compared to the other observed legumes (P<0.05). Additionally, the in vitro incubation of CC resulted in the lowest concentration of stearic acid. The findings lead to the conclusion that CC exhibits more favorable FA profiles in the rumen when compared to the tropical forage tree-legumes in the present experiment. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - This chapter presents the main results of the research carried out in Cuba with Leucaena leucocephala and Tithonia diversifolia, and the main recommendations for their use in the livestock sector. The technology developed for Leucaena leucocephala during the 1980s and part of the 1990s for the use of this arboreal legume was transferred to producers since the mid-1990s. In that decade, a National Program was developed for the introduction of silvopastoral systems with Leucaena leucocephala in the livestock sector. Studies with Tithonia diversifolia began in 2006 and are still being developed based on materials (ecotypes) collected in the country. As a result of this process new technologies are available for its use in grazing or cut and carry systems both for ruminants and monogastrics. Starting in 2015, a National Program has been running in the productive sector for the use of protein plants in animal feeding, including Tithonia diversifolia. This review details the establishment, nutritional quality and management practices to optimize plant and animal production with this shrub and describes its impact on the environment and animal health. Finally, the factors that limited the adoption of these plants and expectations for the future are described. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Secondary growth is the most dynamic developmental aspect during the terrestrialization of plants. The development of secondary xylem tissue composed of thick-walled cells with characteristic changes in its structure and chemistry facilitates the growth and development of woody plants. In the present study, the chemical composition of the secondary xylem of juvenile and mature wood from the branch and main trunk of Leucaena leucocephala, has been investigated and the differences established. The biochemical analysis of different cell wall components in the mature wood of the main trunk revealed high holocellulose and α-cellulose and less lignin content in the juvenile wood while its syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio was less than for the mature wood. As compared to the branch xylem, concentration of cell wall polysaccharides and lignin content was higher in both juvenile and mature wood collected from the main trunk. Thioacidolysis and GC-MS analysis of wood lignin from juvenile and mature wood showed that an increased concentration in lignin content in mature wood is associated with a corresponding increase in S/G ratio. The structural information of the acetylated lignin was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Our results indicate that the mature wood from the main trunk is superior in pulp yielding and lignin degradability as compared to the juvenile wood of the branch and trunk. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Consumption of wild edible plants has played a significant role in supplying food and nutritional requirements and increasing the health status of underprivileged communities in many rural parts of the world. The present investigation was to evaluate the nutritive value, mineral content, vitamin content, and toxicological status of ten wild edible plants viz. Phlogocanthus thrysiflorus, Lasia spinosa, Eriosema chinense, Polygonum microcephalum, Nasturtium indicum, Spinacia oleracea, Malva parviflora, Leucaena leucocephala, Elsholtzia blanda, and Sonchus oleraceus, consumed by the tribal people of Meghalaya State in India, as their nourishment. All investigated plants were collected from different areas of Meghalaya state, and their nutraceutical potential was evaluated following the standard food analysis methods described in the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. Protein contents were very high in several species, especially in N. indicum (24.75%). Carbohydrate content ranged from 5.86% (S. oleracea) to 21.28% (E. chinense). All plants contained significant amounts of minerals (Na, K, Ca, Fe, Zn, Mg), and water soluble vitamins such as vitamin C (0.24–5.79 mg/100 g of dry plant material), B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B9. Antinutrients such as oxalate, phytate, saponin and heavy metal (Pb, Cr, Cd, Hg) levels in all plants were estimated below fatal levels. The consequences of haemolytic toxicity, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of water extracts of wild edible plants ensure safety for human consumption. Therefore, this study focuses on the utilization of wild edible plants as a source of dietary supplements, which may result in the commercialization of the produce; hence, it assesses consumer perceptions towards wild edible plants in India. © 2023 SAAB

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the fermentative profile, fermentative losses, microbial populations, aerobic stability, chemical composition, and in situ degradability of total mixed ration silages based on forage cactus associated with xerophytic legumes. The treatments consisted of four total mixed ration silages based on forage cactus and concentrate (TMRC), associated with legumes such as Gliricidia sepium (TMRG), Leucaena (TMRL), and Senna obtusifolia (TMRS). There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) among the evaluated treatments for the pH and NH3-N (% of total N) variables. The pH values remained within the ideal range, from 4.2 to 4.4, and the NH3-N content ranged from 2.21 to 0.85%. The dry matter recovery for the evaluated treatments averaged 89%. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts ranged from 5.0 to 6.3 log CFU/g among the evaluated silages, with TMRC presenting the lowest count at 5 log CFU/g in comparison with the total mixed ration silages associated with legume plants. All of the total mixed ration silages associated with legumes presented an average mold count of 3.3 log CFU/g. Yeast populations were observed only for TMRG at 5 log CFU/g. A higher aerobic stability was observed for TMRC, followed by TMRG and then TMRS. In conclusion, the total mixed ration silages associated with G. sepium and S. obtusifolia can be recommended based on their fermentation and nutritional value. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The consumption of legume seeds has benefits for human nutrition and health. Seeds of Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena esculenta are fast-growing legumes that are used for a variety of purposes. In general, they are used to preserve/restore the soil; the foliage can be used as fodder for livestock and the seeds for human consumption in rural populations. Leucaena seeds are a source of nutrition, since they contain proteins, carbohydrates and lipids (including omega 3, 6 and 9 unsaturated acids). The protein fraction has shown pharmaceutical effects of interest (analgesic, lipolytic, emollient, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant and anti-diabetic) and some techno-functional properties for the food industry. However, the main limitation to the human consumption of leucaena seeds is the presence of mimosine, an antinutrient that produces side effects such as alopecia, growth retardation, cataracts and infertility in animals. In this sense, some technological processes that could contribute to its decrease. This work was carried out at the Nutraceuticals Department of the Interdisciplinary Research Center for Integral Regional Development, Oaxaca Unit, Mexico. A comprehensive and integrative review of research work carried out in different parts of the world was conducted. The bibliographic search was carried out from January 2020 to January 2022. Several databases such as Scopus, Latindex, Dialnet, Redalyc.org, FAO and Academic Google were explored. A total of 81 documents were used to prepare this review document. This review integrates aspects related to the potential use of leucaena seeds in human nutrition: nutritional composition, pharmacological, techno-functional properties, the processes to improve digestibility and reduce toxicity. © 2023, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

AB  - Green chemistry methods are now an intriguing field of study in agriculture, particularly in pest management. For this reason, novel approaches for the more efficient manufacturing of nanoparticles with improved biological characteristics have been developed. Because nanoparticle production is faster, this method is more eco-friendly and less toxic than old methods. The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Leucaena leucocephala, Mentha aquatica, and Zingiber officinale extracts and their antibacterial activity against Pectobacterium cartovorum, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Xanthomonas axonopodis. The results showed that spectroscopic and microscopic methods, such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealed absorption peaks for Ll-AgNPs at 415 nm, 420 nm for Ma-AgNPs, and 430 nm for Zo-AgNPs, indicating the silver nature of the prepared colloidal samples. The TEM images revealed the quasi-spherical morphology of NPs with an average size of 12.51, 10.63, and 10.26 nm for Ll-AgNPs, Ma-AgNPs, and Zo-AgNPs. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure with crystallite. While distinctive peaks in an investigation using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy showed that several biomolecules were attached to AgNPs, antibacterial activity was evaluated by an inhibitory zone test, which showed high efficiency against P. cartovorum, A. tumefaciens, and X. axonopodis, with an antibacterial function comparable to L. leucocephala, M. aquatica, and Z. officinale extract. The green production of silver nanoparticles has the potential to be a useful tool in pest management strategies against phytopathogenic bacteria. © 2024, Trans Tech Publications Ltd.

AB  - Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L. Moench) is a beneficial vegetable and oil crop that has found valuable use as food, paper, medicine, and oil. However, because of climate change, a lack of better okra cultivars that can resist drought has hampered okra production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and across the world. This study aimed to investigate the economic production of this vegetable in a forest setting. The okra (A. esculentus L.) experiment was conducted underneath three forest trees (i.e. Albizia lebbeck, Melia azedarach, and Leucaena leucocephala) in the agroforestry area. A single-factor Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications was utilised. The sample was then separated into three groups: okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry, okra-M. azedarach agroforestry, and okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry. The findings of the study revealed that okra production had differed significantly in three agroforestry practices. The fresh okra yield was highest (10.20 ton/ha) in the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry. The okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry (9.10 ton/ha) came in second, while the lowest yield was in the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry (8.90 ton/ha). Moreover, the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry recorded the maximum benefit–cost ratio (3.97) for economic performance. This ratio was 21% and 14% higher compared to the respective performance of the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry and okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry. However, the highest amount of carbon sequestration (238.90 ton/ha/yr) was measured in the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry as well as (229.80 ton/ha/yr) in the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry practice. Finally, the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry practice would significantly increase production, touching financial benefit and ensuring sound environmental quality using the vacant woodlot space. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Human encroachment and rapid usage of antibiotics, and toxic chemicals have given rise to fatal waterborne diseases and drinking water crises. This work focuses on the phytofabrication of silver nanoparticle-doped polyurethane membranes (PUM) for wastewater treatment via amoxicillin degradation and its antimutagenic potential. Fresh leaf extracts of Acokanthera oppositifolia and Leucaena leucocephala were utilized for the reduction and capping of silver ions. The structural properties of nanoparticles were studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive analysis (EDAX), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The ability of a polyurethane membrane embedded with silver nanoparticles to remove amoxicillin and residual antimicrobial in treated water was also tested. Additionally, antimutagenic activity against Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA 98 and 100) with 2-aminofluorene and sodium azide mutagens was investigated in filtered water. The effectiveness of the developed membrane was assessed in a sewage sample using the catalase test and plating on an agar plate to estimate the reduction in the microbial population. The finding reveals that the membranes doped with nanoparticles of Leucaena leucocephala demonstrated the highest amoxicillin degradation (94%) and antimutagenic (99.0%) with pseudo-first-order kinetics R2 of 0.96. The microbial population was reduced from 1.13×105 to 3.04×102 and 2.16×102 CFU/mL after filtration by PUM-doped nanoparticles of Acokanthera oppositifolia and Leucaena leucocephala, respectively. The results conclude that polyurethane membranes doped with silver nanoparticles are very effective in wastewater treatment and hold great promise for wastewater remediation applications.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The textile industry is one of the industries that produces wastewater with complex contents and has the potential to pollute the environment. Consequently, wastewater treatment is required to prevent this problem. The utilization of natural coagulants to treat dye wastewater has been carried out by various researchers. However, most of the research only uses a single dye as the wastewater model, despite the complex nature of the real wastewater. Therefore, in this study crude extract of Leucaena leucocephala seed was used to coagulate single and binary dye mixtures with Congo red and Tartrazine as the model substance. The coagulation was carried out by varying the initial pH (3-9), dose of coagulant (50-1150 mg eq BSA/L) and the initial dye concentration (50-100 mg/L). It was found that Leucaena crude extract has successfully removed 99.54% of the Congo red (pH 3; dose 650 mg eq BSA/L) and 53.2% (pH 3; dose 1150 mg eq BSA/L) of Tartrazine at 50 mg/L single dye wastewater. The removal of 50 mg/L binary mixture was 94.4 and 54.6% for Congo red and Tartrazine, respectively, at pH 3 and coagulant dose 1050 mg eq BSA/L. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - Rhizospheric microbial communities improve the effectiveness of hyperaccumulators in the phytoremediation of heavy metals. However, limited access to tailing dams and inadequate assessment of plants’ phytoremediation potential limit the characterization of native accumulators, hindering the effectiveness of local remediation efforts. This study evaluates the heavy metal sequestration potentials of Pennisetum purpureum, Leucaena leucocephala, and Pteris vittata and their associated rhizospheric microbial communities at the Marlu and Pompora tailing dams in Ghana. The results indicate shoot hyperaccumulation of Cd (334.5 ± 6.3 mg/kg) and Fe (10,647.0 ± 12.6 mg/kg) in P. purpureum and L. leucocephala, respectively. Analysis of rhizospheric bacterial communities revealed the impact of heavy metal contamination on bacterial community composition, associating Fe and Cd hyperaccumulation with Bacillus, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas species. This study reports the hyperaccumulation potentials of L. leucocephala and P. purpureum enhanced by associated rhizosphere bacterial communities, suggesting their potential application as an environmentally friendly remediation process of heavy metals contaminated lands. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background and Objective: Interest in improving the agronomic traits of Leucaena tarramba has relatively increased to select productive varieties by plant breeding through gamma irradiation. Therefore, assessing the study of genetic diversity in Leucaena tarramba using RAPD markers is an important initial step to understand the genetic makeup of this species and its potential for improvement. Materials and Methods: In this study, RAPD markers was used to assess the genetic variability of some individuals based on the dose of gamma radiation treatment. By 10 primers used, four primers have successfully amplified the bands, consisting of OPA-05, OPA-09, OPD-03 and OPA-18 primers. Results: The informative band average of 3.25 NPB, 1.25 number of NMB and polymorphism of 21.32%. The genetic profiles such as, PIC, MI and EMR averaged 0.35, 17.60 and 44.50 per primer, respectively. Analysis of RAPD markers with dendrogram clustering revealed no significant genetic differences between Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena tarramba. Irradiation dosages ranging from 250-750 Gy are closely linked, while a dose of 500 Gy shows the highest genetic distance. Conclusion: The informative band indicating a high level of effectiveness and reliability of the markers applied where 500 Gy is the most distant genetic relationship compared to other treatments. Furthermore, primer selection including OPA-05, OPA-09, OPD-03 and OPA-18, serves as a valuable information in biomolecular analysis of mutant Leucaena tarramba. © 2024 Purnama Isti Khaerani et al.

AB  - Translocation of endangered plant species and facilitating in situ regeneration require knowledge of the factors that define suitable habitat characteristics. Four approaches were employed to define how antecedent and contemporary plant identity influenced Cycas seedling growth and survival in Guam, Yap, and the Philippines. Cycas micronesica K.D. Hill or Cycas nitida K.D. Hill & A. Lindstr. seedlings growing beneath the canopy of the maternal parent tree reached 100% mortality in 4 to 8 year. Cycas micronesica seedlings planted beneath a conspecific male adult tree reached 68% mortality in two years while seedlings planted away from a conspecific individual exhibited 100% survival. Cycas micronesica seedlings planted beneath monostands of invasive Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit or Vitex parviflora Juss. reached 40% mortality in two years while seedlings planted in adjacent native forest cover exhibited 100% survival. Cycas micronesica seedlings planted in soil conditioned for 9 months by conspecifics, heterospecific native species, Carica papaya L., L. leucocephala, or V. parviflora exhibited the greatest growth in the soils conditioned by heterospecific natives and the least growth in the soils conditioned by the three invasive species. The seedlings growing in soil conditioned by conspecifics exhibited the most coralloid roots and the greatest shoot:root ratio. These studies confirmed that the identity of antecedent and competitive plants strongly influenced the longevity and growth of Cycas seedlings. Conservationists may improve outcomes by avoiding degraded forests that have experienced invasive plant species when positioning translocation projects. Planting Cycas seedlings in biodiverse native forest but away from a conspecific individual may lead to the greatest success in population recovery. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems have been promoted as part of a strategy to improve livestock productivity and ecosystem services in the Cesar River Valley, Colombia. Between 2014 and 2017, patterns of diversity, structure, and composition of the vegetation (> 2.5 cm DBH) were studied in 35 plots of 1000 m2 located in silvopastoral systems, conventional pastures, and forests in cattle farms of the region. A total of 1852 individuals were registered, distributed in 281 morphospecies, 109 genera, and 44 families. The most abundant families were Fabaceae (35%), Bignoniaceae (7.5%), and Myrtaceae (6.7%). Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Eucalyptus cf. tereticornis Sm., and Roseodendron chryseum (S.F. Blake) Miranda were the most abundant species. Forest fragments and riparian forests presented the highest values for plant density, canopy cover, leaf index, the total volume of vegetation, and species richness, followed by paddocks with scattered trees and mixed fodder banks. The largest trees were found in the relicts of forests and paddocks with scattered trees (Peltogyne purpurea Pitter., Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Jacq.) Griseb., Anacardium excelsum (Bertero & Balb.) Skeels., Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn., and Albizia saman (Jacq.) Merr.). Silvopastoral arrangements contribute to landscape connectivity and complement the role of forest fragments to conserve 14.2 % of the tree species in the Cesar River Valley. However, restoring this landscape requires conserving and connecting existing forest fragments, scaling up livestock systems with trees and shrubs, and integrating a greater diversity of native species across all land uses. © 2023, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - A review synthesizing the research on the quality and use of Cratylia argentea forage to create incentives for its use in animal production systems in the tropics is presented. The species has been extensively evaluated, mainly in tropical America, to develop it as a shrub legume for infertile, acid soils as an alternative to Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium that are not adapted to these soils. This review includes a synthesis and discussion of research findings with C. argentea forage on (1) nutritive value, including secondary compounds, (2) alternative uses in animal production systems, and (3) live weight gain and milk production. The strength of the species is its drought tolerance and high protein content that results in increased milk yield and liveweight gain when grazed in association with grasses, particularly in the dry season. Supplementation of fresh or ensiled cratylia to grazing animals usually results in increased carrying capacity of the pasture and milk yield for cows of medium to high genetic potential. Its deficiency is the low acceptability of fresh forage by animals with no previous experience and high demand for labor when used in cut and carry systems. The issue of low adoption is addressed and suggestions for future research are presented. © 2024 Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales is an open-access journal published by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT).

AB  - Using foliage of woody species as soil cover (SC) in agroforestry systems is an agroecological technique which may help to confront great challenges to food production, including conservation of soil moisture, provision of nutrients to the soil, and weed control. This study evaluated the effect of adding foliage of Leucaena leucocephala and Guazuma ulmifolia as SC on diversity, abundance, biomass, and potential for suppression of weeds. Eight treatments were established based on addition or not of foliage of woody species as SC to maize crop between alleys of the woody species. Richness, density, diversity, and production of weed biomass at 35, 65, and 95 days after germination of maize were recorded, and the potential for weed suppression was calculated. The study identified 47 weed species belonging to 18 families; no significant effect of addition of foliage on diversity and density of weeds was found. Production of biomass was significantly greater in the control treatment without woody species or SC than in the other treatments, while the greatest potential for suppression (40%) was found for the treatment with SC of foliage of both woody species. It was concluded that addition of foliage of L. leucocephala and G. ulmifolia as SC reduces weed biomass, increasing potential for weed suppression. Therefore, use of foliage of these species in alley cropping agroforestry systems contributes to weed control. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to optimize the production of bio-oil from Leucaena leucocephala wood using a fluidized bed reactor. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the fast pyrolysis through three operational parameters: pyrolysis temperature, nitrogen flow rate, and temperature of the first condensation stage. The optimum conditions obtained for bio-oil production were 500 °C, 26.4 L min–1, that is, about 3.3 times the minimum fluidization flow, and 80 °C, respectively. The bio-oil obtained under optimum conditions was of good quality and did not require further treatment. Physical properties of the bio-oil were analysed according to ASTM D7544-12. In addition, the chemical composition of the non-condensed gases and bio-oil were identified using GC–MS. The non-condensed gases were found to contain mainly ketones and lignin derivatives, while the bio-oil contained cyclic ketones, alcohol ethers, aromatic alcohols, and lignin derivatives. The study found that increasing the pyrolysis temperature did not significantly increase the yield of H2 and CO for syngas production. Regarding the solid obtained, a large amount of unreacted material (66.7 wt.%) is generated at 400 °C, and as the temperature is increased, a high-quality biochar is obtained. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Soil anti-erodibility is closely related to soil physical and chemical properties. Erodibility studies can reveal trends in the changes in soil properties during ecological restoration and promote soil erosion control and prevention. The soils of six typical vegetation types in debris flow fans of Jiangjiagou Valley in Dongchuan District, Kunming City, were selected as research objects. To evaluate soil anti-erodibility, a comprehensive analysis of soil anti-erodibility indicators was performed using principal component analysis through field sampling at the study site and laboratory data processing. The results revealed the following facts: (1) Compared with the other five vegetation types, soil total porosity, water content, water-holding capacity, organic matter, and total nitrogen content of bare land were the lowest among all six types, whereas unit weight was the highest, indicating that the soil structure and quality of bare land were relatively poor. (2) The comprehensive soil antierodibility indices of different vegetation types in the debris flow fans of Jiangjiagou Valley followed the order of: Eucalyptus robusta forest > cornland > Heteropogon contortus grassland > Leucaena leucocephala forest > Desmodium racemosum shrub > bare land. (3) The 12 indicators characterizing soil anti-erodibility at the study site can be simplified into six indicators: total porosity, soil water content, soil unit weight, capillary water-holding capacity, organic matter content, and anti-erodibility index. The optimal linear model was obtained by regression fitting with a comprehensive index of soil anti-erodibility: Y = 0.181X1 + 0.058X4 - 1.342X5 + 0.213X7 + 0.115X9 + 0.082X12+ 2.191. Overall, vegetation restoration of debris flow fans in Jiangjiagou Valley improved soil anti-erodibility, and the improvement effect of Eucalyptus robusta forest, cornland, and Heteropogon contortus grassland was significantly greater than that of Leucaena leucocephala forest and Desmodium racemosum shrub. These results provide basic data and theoretical support for vegetation restoration, soil improvement, and the ecological reconstruction of debris flow fans in dry-hot valleys. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - Bio-oil upgrading to produce biofuels and chemicals has become an attractive topic over the past decade. However, the design of cost- and performance-effective catalysts for commercial-scale production remains a challenge. Herein, commercial titania (TiO2) was used as the support of cobalt (Co)-based catalysts (Co/TiO2) due to its low cost, high availability, and practicability for commercialization in the future. The Co/TiO2 catalysts were made with two different forms of TiO2 (anatase [TiO2–A] and rutile [TiO2–R]) and comparatively evaluated in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 4-propylguaicol (4PG), a lignin-derived model compound. Both Co/TiO2 catalysts promoted the HDO of 4PG following a similar pathway, but the Co/TiO2–R catalyst exhibited a higher activity in the early stages of the reaction due to the formation of abundant Ti3+ species, as detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and hydrogen–temperature programed reduction (H2–TPR) analyses. On the other hand, the Co/TiO2–A catalyst possessed a higher acidity that enhanced propylcyclohexane production at prolonged reaction times. In terms of reusability, the Co/TiO2–A catalyst showed a higher stability (less Co leaching) and reusability compared to Co/TiO2–R, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses. The HDO of the real bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala revealed that the Co/TiO2–A catalyst could convert high oxygenated aromatics (methoxyphenols, dimethoxyphenols, and benzenediols) to phenols and enhanced the phenols content, hinting at its potential to produce green chemicals from bio-feedstock. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Coffee is a group of plants that require partial light (C3), whose cultivation combines the use of shade trees and cultivated plants with the aim of increasing production and maintaining the microclimate around the cultivated plants. The shade provided by shade trees will have a significant effect on soil temperature and water content. The growth and development of a cultivated plant is strongly influenced by water content, on the other hand, water content also affects soil temperature. The optimal air temperature needed by Arabica coffee plants is 18-21°C, while the soil temperature suitable for Arabica coffee plants is 21°C. The research was needed to determine the effect of shade tree type on the soil temperature of Arabica coffee plants. This research was at the Koperasi Ribang Gayo Musara, Pantan Musara Village, Pegasing Subdistrict, Central Aceh District, Aceh Province. This research used a non-factorial randomized block design with five treatments and four replications. Treatments consisted of shade tree type on coffee plants were control/no shade, small lamtoro shade (Leucaena leucocephala ssp. leucocephala), big lamtoro shade (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata), banana shade (Musa paradisiaca L.), avocado shade (Persea americana Mill.). The results showed that the shade tree type had a significant effect on soil temperature at a depth of 0, 10, and 20 cm. Coffee plants that were shaded by avocado trees have better temperatures for coffee plants and can reduce soil temperature until they reach optimal temperatures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae family) is one of the plants used in the traditional medicine for the treatment of many diseases. The objective of the present work was to evaluate phytochemically and biologically different extracts of L. leucocephala flowers, grown in Jordan. Total phenols and total flavonoid contents and antioxidant activities of the water, 70% ethanol and n-butanol extracts of the fresh flowers were determined. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evaluated using the dilution method. Microculture tetrazolium assay (MTT) was used to measure the antiproliferative activity. The toxicity of the extracts was assessed using Brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA). The chemical composition of the n-butanol extract, the most potent extract, was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). LC-MS evaluation of the n-butanol extract revealed the presence of 23 compounds. It showed the highest phenolic content (gallic acid equivalent-321.087 mg/g) and the highest flavonoid content (rutin equivalent-210.388 mg/g). It exhibited highest antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus (MIC = 0.390 ± 0.002 mg/mL) and highest antiproliferative activity against T47D (IC50 = 0.094 ± 0.01 mg/mL). None of the tested extracts exhibited toxicity. © 2024, Romanian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study deals with emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from some common plant species found in the Western Ghats of India using branchenclosure experiments. A custom-made dynamic chamber system was deployed to collect samples from seven different plant species. Analysis of speciated BVOCs was performed using C2-C6 and C6-C12 VOC analysers to determine the emission composition and relative concentration. Isoprene was the most abundant compound, followed by ethene, propene, a-pinene and ft-pinene. Among the plant species, Tectona grandis, Bambusa vulgaris and Psidium guajava showed high fractions of isoprene emission, Saraca asoca showed moderate emission, and Manilkara zapota and Leucaena leucocephala showed the lowest emission. However, M. zapota and L. leucocephala showed higher emission of both ethene and propene compared to isoprene. This study emphasizes the importance of emission flux measurements of major plant species in different forest regions of India, which is necessary to make emission inventories of important BVOCs. © (2024), (Indian Academy of Sciences).

AB  - The urban fringe area is a transitional area between urban and rural areas which supports urban ecological functioning. Vegetation is an element of biodiversity that is important for the sustainability of urban life. The balance of the ecosystem is maintained with the help of the biodiversity of the urban fringe area where environmental functions and services will be able to run optimally. The important value index (IVI) in the vegetation structure is a quantitative measurement used to assess the health of vegetation in an area. Vegetation in the urban fringe region of Surakarta is dominated by types of Tectona grandis, Senna siamea, Mangifera indica, Switenia macrophylla and Leucaena leucocephala. Tectona grandis (220.02%), Falctaria moluccana (164.63%) and Pterocarpus indicus (142.55%) have the highest IVI vegetation in Karanganyar District. In Sukoharjo Regency, variations for the highest IVI were diverse with the highest IVI being Falcataria mollucana (171.49%), Tectona grandis (97.46%) and Gluta rengas (89.54%). Tectona grandis (230.99%) and Mangifera indica (145.53%) are the species with the highest IVI in Boyolali District. The high importance of Tectona grandis is based on the IVI count. The dominance of vegetation species in urban fringe is considered to be of high economic value for the community. © 2023 IIETA.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the nutritive value of different vegetative parts of Moringa oleifera (leaves, stems and plant debris) and Leucaena leucocephala (leaves and dried pods after seed harvesting). Nutrient composition, secondary metabolites and kinetics of gas production (GP) from in vitro rumen fermentation were measured to investigate the adequacy of these materials as feed resources for ruminants. Leaves of M. oleifera had the highest (p <.001) crude protein content (22.9%), total polyphenols (336 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry matter [DM]), flavonoids (158 mg quercetin equivalent/g DM), condensed tannins (2.26 mg catechin equivalents/g DM) and extraction yield (29.3%). Debris of M. oleifera showed the highest (p <.001) antioxidant activity. The pods and leaves of L. leucocephala showed the highest organic matter (OM; 94.5 and 92.7%, respectively), neutral detergent fiber (63.1 and 64.6%, respectively), acid detergent fiber (48.5 and 45%, respectively) and hemicellulose (14.6 and 19.6%, respectively). However, the leaves and stems of M. oleifera showed the highest (p <.001) asymptotic GP (152 and 147 mL/g DM incubated) and fractional rate of fermentation (0.168 and 0.146 per h) compared to the leaves and pods of L. leucocephala. Additionally, the highest (p <.001) OM digestibility (59.8%), metabolizable energy (8.32 MJ/kg DM), net energy (in terms of forage units for lactation or meat production) were observed with the leaves of M. oleifera. In conclusion, the concentration of nutrients differed between plants and within parts of the plant. Leaves of M. oleifera showed higher nutritive value than the stems and shed material. The pods of L. leucocephala showed higher nutritive value than its leaves. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Wild Edible Plants (WEPs) grow naturally in the environment without human assistance and have parts that humans or animals can consume. The declining interest of local communities in consumable wild plant species, especially among the younger generation, resulted in the loss of public knowledge on the utilization of wild natural resources and the extinction of various types of wild species in nature. This study aims to determine wild edible plants used by local communities in three districts along the Bengawan Solo River, Central Java, Indonesia. This research used qualitative and quantitative data obtained by conducting open, semi-structured, and structured interviews with 90 respondents aged 20-80 years old. Quantitative data was analyzed to produce Use Values (UV) and Informant Consensus Factor (ICF). The study found that the community consumes approximately 49 species from 32 families of WEPs and the most consumed species were Leucaena leucocephala, Carica papaya, Dendrocalamus asper, Muntingia calabura, Peperomia pellucida, Gnetum gnemon, Moringa oleifera, and Portulaca oleracea. Consumable wild plants along the Bengawan Solo River have an ICF value ranging from 0.645 to 1. The WEPs were used for carbohydrates, vegetables, fruits, seeds, and medicine. The study highlights the diverse uses of plant parts, emphasizing the community's holistic approach to incorporating wild plants into their diet and medicine. The research emphasizes the need to preserve and comprehend the multifaceted roles of WEPs, which are crucial for sustaining cultural traditions and community well-being. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Following the control of an invasive tree species, native forest ecosystem restoration can be prevented by a secondary invasion by another invasive species that inhibits the reestablishment of native trees. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the invasive shrub Leucaena leucocephala on the initial growth of planted seedlings of four native tree species (Pandanus boninensis, Rhaphiolepis indica, Schima mertensiana, and Terminalia catappa) after eradication of the invasive tree Casuarina equisetifolia in the Ogasawara Islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. In a 24-month field experiment, we compared the sizes of planted seedlings (diameter at ground level, height, and leaf number) among four treatments in a 2 × 2 design of initial seedling size (large vs. small) × L. leucocephala invasion (sowing L. leucocephala seeds vs. control). More than 75% of the seedlings (excluding S. mertensiana) survived regardless of the treatments. For all four species, initially large seedlings tended to become larger plants at the end of the experiment than initially small seedlings. We detected significant effects of L. leucocephala invasion on one or more plant size parameters in all four species. Seedlings grown in L. leucocephala invasion quadrats were smaller than those in control quadrats at the end of the experiment. We detected significant interactions between initial seedling sizes and L. leucocephala invasion for three species. Together, these results indicate that secondary invasion by L. leucocephala after controlling C. equisetifolia inhibits the initial growth of native tree seedlings, depending on their size at the time of invasion. © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Increasing the biodiversity of Leucaena leucocephala (hereafter leucaena) stands without losing the benefits provided by the forest structure is a challenge for adaptive management. Here, we report the survival and growth (height, stem, and canopy diameter) of five Atlantic Forest tree species planted underneath a pure stand of the exotic leucaena, which was broadcast sown 35 years before in a 0.6 ha area. Two treatments were compared: thinning (cutting all leucaena trees in 4-m wide rows, where seedlings were planted) and control (seedlings planted under leucaena canopy), with four replicates each (20 seedlings per plot, four per species, 2-m spaced). The five species selected were long-lived emergent trees from seasonal forests, with broad canopy, evergreen, and shade-tolerant. These traits were expected to allow their survival and growth, and, later on, to shade out the leucaena trees. Seven years after planting, survival was high for all species (around 80%), not differing between treatments or species. On average, stem diameter, height, and crown diameter were, respectively, 69, 44, and 36% higher in thinned than in control plots. Response to thinning differed between species in growth, with Gallesia integrifolia and Luehea divaricata standing out. Our results demonstrate that the species used for enrichment planting, selected by their suitable functional traits, can successfully survive under leucaena stands. Reducing competition by thinning, however, is crucial to enhance their growth. Despite the benefits from thinning, enrichment success strongly depends, therefore, on the abilities of the species selected to face the ecological filters acting on the target ecosystem. © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Giant leucaena is a multipurpose tree-legume found throughout the tropics and sub-tropics. Its foliage is used as animal fodder due to high protein and fiber. Giant leucaena has several other advantageous traits such as fast-growth, high yields and strong tolerance to environmental stresses. Despite having these desirable qualities, leucaena tissues contain an undesirable attribute, a toxic non-protein amino acid, mimosine, found in all parts of the plant including the foliage. The goal of this research was to determine mimosine concentrations in various tissues and life stages of giant leucaena plants to inform use of leucaena foliage as a fodder. Mimosine was extracted from different parts of giant leucaena at different ages and quantified using HPLC analysis. qRT-PCR was used to determine the relative expression of mimosine synthase in leucaena tissues. Mimosine was present in all parts of the leaf, stem and root of giant leucaena, and concentrations changed depending on the age of the plant. Green seeds had the highest expression level of mimosine synthase. Mimosine is ubiquitous and abundant in leucaena tissues with younger and immature plants and tissues containing more mimosine than older mature plants and tissues. © 2024 Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales is an open-access journal published by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), in association with the Tropical Crops Genetic Resources Institute of the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (TCGRI-CATAS).

AB  - The global agricultural system has recently suffered from unfavourable climatic factors that impacts plant morphology, physiology, biochemistry, growth, and yield. One of the main barriers to agricultural production and food security is abiotic stress in plants. Therefore, in order to feed the population, the development of novel strategies is required to solve these issues and achieve sustainability. Undoubtedly, different types of nanoparticles are extensively used in the agriculture sector for the crop improvement. Keeping this in mind, this review focuses on the role of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) in particular for combating different abiotic stresses. Though the majority of investigations, however, centred on the general effect of ZnO NPs on the plant physiology, morphology, anatomy, and biochemical processes under stress conditions, this article will present in detail the effect of differently synthesised ZnO nanoparticles in mitigating abiotic stresses such as heavy metal stress, temperature extremes, drought, and salinity stress. The article will focus how ZnO nanoparticles affect plant biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, and gene expression level to combat abiotic stress. The elucidation of the mechanisms behind ZnO NP-mediated stress tolerance in plants and future prospective of this emerging technology has also been discussed. Overall, ZnO nanoparticles provide an eco-friendly, cost-effective approach to plant stress management, and these findings open up new avenues for the application of nanotechnology in sustainable agriculture, allowing for the cultivation of stress-tolerant crops and ensuring global food security in the face of changing climatic conditions.

AB  - This review examines the current state of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of different dietary ruminant enteric methane mitigation strategies and their modes of action together with the issues discussed regarding the potential harms/risks and applicability of such strategies. By investigating these strategies, we can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which they influence methane production and identify promising approaches for sustainable mitigation of methane emissions. Out of all nutritional strategies, the use of 3-nitrooxypropanol, red seaweed, tannins, saponins, essential oils, nitrates, and sulfates demonstrates the potential to reduce emissions and receives a lot of attention from the scientific community. The use of certain additives as pure compounds is challenging under certain conditions, such as pasture-based systems, so the potential use of forages with sufficient amounts of plant secondary metabolites is also explored. Additionally, improved forage quality (maturity and nutrient composition) might help to further reduce emissions. Red seaweed, although proven to be very effective in reducing emissions, raises some questions regarding the volatility of the main active compound, bromoform, and challenges regarding the cultivation of the seaweed. Other relatively new methods of mitigation, such as the use of cyanogenic glycosides, are also discussed in this article. Together with nitrates, cyanogenic glycosides pose serious risks to animal health, but research has proven their efficacy and safety when control measures are taken. Furthermore, the risks of nitrate use can be minimized by using probiotics. Some of the discussed strategies, namely monensin or halogenated hydrocarbons (as pure compounds), demonstrate efficacy but are unlikely to be implemented widely because of legal restrictions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Ruminant production in the Philippines is often hindered by limited access to high-quality feed, leading to suboptimal animal growth and productivity. To address these challenges, this study evaluated the locally made multi-nutrient lick block (MNLB) containing ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala), a legume known for its nutritional value. A 30-day palatability test was conducted to assess the acceptability of the developed MNLB, using 5 male buffaloes with an average weight of 245 ± 5 kg. Additionally, a 90-day-feeding trial was carried out using 15 growing buffaloes (average age: 13.5 months, weight: 243.83 ± 5 kg), randomly assigned to three treatment groups: T1 or control (non-supplemented), T2 or commercial mineral block, and T3 or MNLB, to evaluate the growth performance, nutrient utilization, and economic viability of the legume-based MNLB. Results demonstrated that the MNLB was palatable to the animals, with an average daily consumption of 192.10 g/animal/day, providing adequate nutritional value to meet the buffaloes’ daily requirements. Moreover, MNLB supplementation significantly enhanced dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) intake compared to control and commercial mineral block groups. The average DM intake for T3 was 9.88 kg, and the average CP intake was 1006 g, compared to T1 (9.56 kg DM intake and 983 g CP intake) and T2 (9.59 kg DM intake and 984 g CP intake). While the commercial mineral block showed positive results, the MNLB outperformed in terms of nutritional value. In terms of cost-effectiveness, the MNLB can serve as an alternative feed supplement for small- scale farmers, offering a lower- cost option compared to commercial feed supplements. The study concluded that the MNLB has potential as a practical solution to address the nutritional challenges faced by ruminant producers in resource-limited environments. By providing a nutrient-rich and safe feed supplement, the MNLB can contribute to improved animal health, productivity, and overall farm profitability. © The Author(s) 2024

AB  - A comprehensive review, based on about 170 references, synthesizing research and development about Cratylia argentea, is presented to expand interest in its dissemination and use in animal production systems. The species has been widely evaluated, mainly in tropical America, with the objective to develop it as a shrub legume and an alternative to the fertility-demanding species, Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium. The review on cratylia is presented in 2 separate parts covering biology and agronomy and quality and utilization. This paper focuses on the (1) description of the species, (2) biogeography and information on germplasm collections and genetic diversity, synthesis, (3) discussion of results from agronomic research, reproductive biology, seed production and (4) multipurpose uses of cratylia. Some strengths of the species as a forage shrub are adaptation to the acid, infertile soils that prevail in the tropics and drought tolerance in subhumid climates with a pronounced dry season. Major shortcomings are slow establishment and rapidly declining seed quality. Research resulted in the release of a blend of 2 germplasm accessions (CIAT 18516 and CIAT 18668) as a commercial forage legume cultivar in Costa Rica and Colombia. Finally, recommendations for future research are proposed. © 2024 Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales is an open-access journal published by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by increased joint pain and stiffness, particularly in the morning, which requires medication for treatment. Our research described here was aimed to develop, evaluate, and optimize coated naproxen pellets for colon-specific delivery using the carboxymethyl Leucaena leucocephala gum for the chronotherapy of RA. The extrusion-spheronization process was used for the preparation of the pellets followed by coating in a fluidized bed processor with materials such as Eudragit® S 100 and L 100. An 11-run, 2-factor, 3-level, randomized full factorial design was used to analyze the impact on the responses by varying the levels of independent factors to obtain the optimized formulation. The drug release of all the formulation batches at the 4th hour varied from 1.24 to 17.22% in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract; while the release of the drug at the 10th hour varied from 76.87 to 98.39% at the colonic pH. Furthermore, it was observed that the optimized formulation exhibited an increased release of naproxen in the presence of cecal matter collected from rats. We suggest that the prepared optimized formulation of the coated pellets of naproxen shows promise for the chronotherapeutic treatment of early morning symptoms associated with RA. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The following paper is a continuation of the previous experiment on the wet season forage production of Leucaena leucocephala cv Tarramba already published. In the recent continuing experiment, measurements were conducted on two 4 months cutting intervals during the 2021 dry season and some additional data were also included from the measurements of biomass production of 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months plant stands to provide more complete information on edible forage and wood production. Data recorded included: leaf production, stem skin (bark) production, stem production, stem diameter, and plant height. With the current model (6,264 plants), the 1 year (2021) edible biomass can support 5 bulls at the first 2 months interval (January to February), and 2 bulls at the second two months interval (March to April), during the wet season. While at the first 4 months interval in 2021 during the dry season (May to August) the model can support 1.8 bulls, and about 2.5 bulls during the second 4 months cutting interval (September to December 2021). If the density is applied to 1 ha with 20.000 plants it may support 6-16 fattening bulls according to the season at biomass production. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Pantelleria is a volcanic island located in the Sicily Channel (Italy), between Sicily and Tunisia. The island, designated a National Park in 2016, hosts an interesting vascular flora of over 600 species including 9 narrow endemics. The island’s incredible biodiversity is, however, at risk due to anthropogenic influences, climate change, and, recently, the presence and spread of alien plant species. The Pantelleria alien flora has never been thoroughly investigated, probably because many non-native species were not yet present or so widespread on the island. Now, however, with the increased general awareness of the risks associated with invasive alien species, documentation of the presence of non-native species has been steadily increasing. In this study, field and literature research was carried out to investigate the alien flora of the island. Here, we report the status of a number of non-native plants with known invasive potential. Cenchrus setaceus (=Pennisetum setaceum) is reported for the first time as naturalized in the island with clear invasive behaviour, while, particularly remarkable for their invasive potential are other studied plants such as: Acacia saligna, Ailanthus altissima, Boheravia coccinea, Carpobrotus edulis, Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata, Malephora crocea, Melia azedarach, Nicotiana glauca, Opuntia ficus-indica, Parkinsonia aculeata, Washingtonia robusta and a few others less important at the moment, but to be monitored. Although most taxa showed a relatively limited distribution, the trend is to observe an increased invasiveness, which indicates that they can potentially become invasive in Pantelleria as well in the next years or decades. Their limited current distribution suggests that these species are in the early stages of the general invasion curve, when intervention is feasible and most likely to succeed. Therefore, it is most prudent to prioritize management for as many potentially problematic nonnatives as possible, which will contribute greatly to the conservation of native species and ecosystems of Pantelleria. Prevention and management of invasive non-native species—both future arrivals and those already present—are necessary to preserve the peculiar volcanic landscape of Pantelleria, which was shaped by man over the last millennia. © Minissale et al.

AB  - A water-absorbent hybrid hydrogel was prepared using arabinoxylans from flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) (FX) and galactomannans from subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) (SG) in the presence of kappa-carrageenan (κC) with variable concentration of potassium chloride as crosslinker (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.3 M), and evaluated on the basis of their swelling rate (%). The optimized hydrogel (GAXH) from a blend of SG, κC, FX and KCl at 5.5% w/v, 1.32% w/v, 1% w/v and 0.3M, respectively, showed 300% swelling in water at room temperature and pH 7.4 with 100% retention of water for 30 days at 10 °C. Blending 50% w/w GAXH in the soil could retain 140% water for 30 days, acting as a water reservoir in the soil system at 35 °C and pH 7.4 which reached 100% evaporation after 60 days. Incorporation of 50% w/w GAXH in sandy, loamy soil was used for the potted cultivation of cherry tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme) and observed for growth and composition of the tomatoes. GAXH enhanced the physiological growth of both the plant as well as cherry tomatoes by controlling the release of KCl into the soil and maintaining soil moisture when 3 day intermittent watering schedule was used. An additional advantage was an improved water use efficiency and reduction in water footprint from 3.23 cm3/g to 9.32 cm3/g and 19.87 mL/fruit to 8.56 mL/fruit, respectively. The fully ripened tomatoes grown on GAXH-incorporated soil showed higher contents of lycopene, total carotenoids, and total polyphenols from 166 to 257 μg/g fresh weight, 99–107 mg β-carotene equivalent/100g fresh weight, 223–241 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g fresh weight, respectively, than control cherry tomatoes grown in soil with no added GAXH. This was also reflected in enhanced antioxidant activity of cherry tomatoes grown in GAXH-incorporated soil. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Metal corrosion poses a substantial economic challenge in a technologically advanced world. In this study, novel environmentally friendly anticorrosive graphene oxide (GO)-doped organic-inorganic hybrid polyurethane (LFAOIH@GO-PU) nanocomposite coatings were developed from Leucaena leucocephala oil (LLO). The formulation was produced by the amidation reaction of LLO to form diol fatty amide followed by the reaction of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and a dispersion of GOx (X = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 wt%) along with the reaction of isophorane diisocyanate (IPDI) (25–40 wt%) to form LFAOIH@GOx-PU35 nanocomposites. The synthesized materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); 1H, 13C, and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance; and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A detailed examination of LFAOIH@GO0.5-PU35 morphology was conducted using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. These studies revealed distinctive surface roughness features along with a contact angle of around 88 G.U preserving their structural integrity at temperatures of up to 235 °C with minimal loading of GO. Additionally, improved mechanical properties, including scratch hardness (3 kg), pencil hardness (5H), impact resistance, bending, gloss value (79), crosshatch adhesion, and thickness were evaluated with the dispersion of GO. Electrochemical corrosion studies, involving Nyquist, Bode, and Tafel plots, provided clear evidence of the outstanding anticorrosion performance of the coatings. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Post-dispersal seed removal is crucial for maintaining plant recruitment by influencing secondary dispersal and the mortality of seeds. However, data on seed removal in the northern savanna of Ghana is scarce. In this study, we applied a rapid assessment method to examine the effect of three habitat types (conventional farmland, agroforestry parkland, and woodland) and two seed species (Leucaena leucocephala and Faidherbia albida) on seed removal by invertebrates and vertebrates in an agricultural landscape using selective exclosures in Nyankpala, a town located in the northern savanna of Ghana. The exclosures, closed and open, were designed to impose restrictions that allow either invertebrates or both invertebrates and vertebrates access to seeds. Using a generalized linear mixed modelling approach, we showed that habitat type and seed species significantly influenced the rate of seed removal, with the woodland habitat and F. albida seeds recording the highest removal rates. Our results suggest that invertebrates often dominated seed removal events compared to vertebrates, possibly due to differences in allometry and morphological traits and their effect on seed preference. This study adds to the growing evidence that savanna habitats and fauna play a critical role in maintaining plant population dynamics through seed predation and dispersal events. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Abstract: Biomass is a sustainable renewable energy source that can solve energy demand and environmental pollution. In this present study, four non-edible biomass that are fast growing in wasteland and forest regions were chosen to check their feasibility as biofuels for the different thermochemical conversion processes. Senna auriculata seeds, Albizia lebbeck seed with shell, Leucaena leucocephala seed, and Acacia nilotica seed were selected. Characterizations such as thermogravimetric analysis, proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, calorific value, bulk density, and functional groups via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis were performed. The proximate analysis confirmed the minimum level of moisture content (4.98 to 6.75%) and significant volatile matter content (53.75 to 72.48%) in these feedstocks. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the maximum devolatilization takes place in the temperature range of 200 to 500°C. The maximum value of solid residue was found in Leucaena leucocephala (31.76 wt %) and the minimum was found in Senna auriculata seeds (8.83 wt %). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the highest peaks were in the range of 3200 to 3323 cm–1, as related to the existence of O–H stretching of carboxylic acid, alcohol, and amine groups. The calorific value of these non-edible biomass materials was in the range of 17.19 to 23.28 MJ/kg. The physio-chemical analysis results confirmed that these feedstocks are more suitable for the thermochemical conversion processes. Also, the processing of this non-edible biomass is more appropriate for future energy development and improves employment opportunities in rural and forest areas. © 2023, Allerton Press, Inc.

AB  - Three bacterial strains, 1AS11T, 1AS12 and 1AS13, members of the new symbiovar salignae and isolated from root nodules of Acacia saligna grown in Tunisia, were characterized using a polyphasic approach. All three strains were assigned to the Rhizobium leguminosarum complex on the basis of rrs gene analysis. Phylogenetic analysis based on 1734 nucleotides of four concatenated housekeeping genes (recA, atpD, glnII and gyrB) showed that the three strains were distinct from known rhizobia species of the R. leguminosarum complex and clustered as a separate clade within this complex. Phylogenomic analysis of 92 up-to-date bacterial core genes confirmed the unique clade. The digital DNA–DNA hybridization and blast-based average nucleotide identity values for the three strains and phylogenetically related Rhizobium species ranged from 35.9 to 60.0% and 87.16 to 94.58%, which were lower than the 70 and 96% species delineation thresholds, respectively. The G+C contents of the strains were 60.82–60.92mol% and the major fatty acids (>4%) were summed feature 8 (57.81%; C18:1 ω7c) and C18:1 ω7c 11-methyl (13.24%). Strains 1AS11T, 1AS12 and 1AS13 could also be differentiated from their closest described species (Rhizobium indicum, Rhizobium laguerreae and Rhizobium changzhiense) by phenotypic and physiological properties as well as fatty acid content. Based on the phylogenetic, genomic, physiological, genotypic and chemotaxonomic data presented in this study, strains 1AS11T, 1AS12 and 1AS13 represent a new species within the genus Rhizobium and we propose the name Rhizobium acaciae sp. nov. The type strain is 1AS11T (=DSM 113913T=ACCC 62388T). © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam de wit) is a valuable source of bioactive metabolites with high preventive and therapeutic effectiveness. Here, and taking into account the effect of geographical location and maturation stage, we aimed to investigate the chemical composition of phenolic, fatty acid profiles (GC-FID) and biological activities from L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) seed oil and leave extracts. The results indicated that L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) ethanolic leaves extracts growing in Ariana have the highest levels in phenolic and flavonoid contents and showed remarkable antioxidant activities. Furthermore, L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) oils extracted from seeds growing in two locations at different maturation stage were analyzed using GC-FID to determine fatty acids profiles and significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between growing area and maturation stage. In addition, both oils and ethanolic extract of L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) were able to limit gram positive and gram negative bacteria, Candida species as well as the tested filamentous fungi species, and the examination of results prove that the diameter of zone inhibition was related to the tested microorganisms. The results credibly indicate that L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) leaves and seeds are nutrient-rich and can contribute effectively to the daily nutrient requirements alongside its therapeutic properties. © 2022, The Tunisian Chemical Society and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Fodder tree leaves (FTL) are limitless nutrient resources that provide high-quality feed, particularly during the dry season, improving animal diets, and reducing the use of concentrates in ruminant livestock farming. In order to determine the benefits of FTL, two experiments were conducted to measure the voluntary feed intake, growth performance, and nitrogen utilization of forest-type (FT) sheep fed rice straw (RS) and supplemented with either Leucaena leucocephala (LEU) or Samanea saman (SAM) or their equal combination (LS). For the growth trial (Experiment 1), 12 male FT sheep with mean initial body weight (BW) of 17.0 ± 1.0 kg (mean ± SD) were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments in a Completely Randomized Design. The diets were Urea-treated RS (UTS) (Control), RS + L (LEU), RS + S (SAM), and RS + 50% L + 50% S (LS). After 14 d of adjustment period, feed intakes and refusals were recorded daily, whereas BW was recorded bi-weekly for 12 wk. Four rams weighing 17.0 ± 1.0 kg BW were randomly assigned to the four treatments over a four period in a repeated (4 × 4) Latin square design to estimate the nitrogen (N) balance study (Experiment 2). Treatment diets were the same as that of Experiment 1. Dry matter intake of straw was highest (P = 0.0001) for sheep fed UTS. However, combining L with S increased (P = 0.0001) straw DM intake compared to feeding L or S alone. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in total feed intake between sheep offered UTS and LS, but both were significantly higher (P = 0.0001) than those offered LEU and SAM. Body weight gain (3.70 kg) and growth rate (196.15 g/d) were highest (P = 0.0001) for sheep offered LS compared to the other treatment groups. Values for N balance differed (P = 0.0001) among treatment diets. N balance for LUE and LS supplemented diets were higher than that of SAM but all were higher (P = 0.0001) than those offered UTS. Leucaena and Samanea leaves could, therefore, be utilized as supplement to poor-quality straws to improve the productivity of small ruminants especially during the long dry seasons in the tropics. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Giant leucaena is a tropical tree-legume that thrives in alkaline and calcareous soils. It contains large amounts of mimosine, the physiological role of which is not well understood. The goals of this study were to determine i) if mimosine is released by giant leucaena into the rhizosphere ii) if mimosine enhances solubility of Fe present in various forms in alkaline soil, and iii) if mimosine enhances transition metal uptake in giant leucaena. Methods: Mimosine in the extracts of rhizosphere soil and root exudates was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to determine if it is released by giant leucaena. Iron concentration in tissue and aqueous samples was determined by ICP-OES analysis. Results: Mimosine was detected in both the rhizosphere eluates and root exudates. Mimosine added to samples of goethite, hematite and FeCl3 increased Fe solubility in water. Giant leucaena plants grown in alkaline soils and supplied with mimosine had higher levels of chlorophyll, Fe and Mn than the control plants. Conclusion: Mimosine is released by giant leucaena roots into the rhizosphere, where it interacts with Fe. Mimosine enhances solubility of insoluble Fe-oxides and prevents conversion of ferric Fe to insoluble oxides at an alkaline pH. Mimosine enhances Fe and Mn uptake in plants growing in alkaline soil conditions. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Soil infertility is one of the constraints contributing to poor sorghum production in semi-arid areas across Africa. To increase sorghum production, there is need to address soil fertility issues. Therefore, the objective was to assess the effects of Leucaena/cattle manure combination on grain and stover yields, harvest index and net return of two sorghum varieties (Macia and SV1) under rainwater harvesting techniques. The field experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design over three cropping seasons in a split-split plot arrangement. Results show significant (P < 0.05) increase in sorghum grain yield with increased applications of Leucaena/cattle manure combination. Macia variety had statistically greater (P < 0.05) grain yield than SV1 variety. Tied contour show considerably higher yield for both varieties across all seasons. Stover yield show significant differences (P < 0.05) as affected by Leucaena/cattle manure and rainwater harvesting techniques. Rainwater harvesting techniques significantly influence (P < 0.05) harvest index, with tied contour and infiltration pits having comparably higher harvest index than standard contour. Application of Leucaena/cattle manure combination show significant increases in harvest index with increased application rates. However, no significant effect was observed at 20 and 30 t ha−1 from SV1 variety across all seasons. Leucaena/cattle manure combination significantly influenced (P < 0.05) sorghum net return across all seasons except at 5 t ha−1 where no significant effect was observed. Macia variety had higher net return than SV1. To increase grain yield and net return, farmers can adopt Macia variety, tied contour and 10 t ha−1 Leucaena/cattle manure combination due to higher incremental yield per tonne. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This investigation was carried out in three different locations to examine the impact of legume forage as a protein source on lipi d regulation and growth. This study used 120 rams, consisting of 40 rams in each location (Garut, Cianjur, Sukabumi) spread along the South Coast of West Java. Physical environmental conditions were recorded during the study. Ram lambs at each location were divided into four groups; one group only received a basal diet (Setaria/Setaria sphacelata), and the other three groups were each given additional legumes (calliandra/Calliandra calothyrsus, lamtoro/Leucaena leucocephala, and moringa/Moringa oleifera). Blood samples were collected every two weeks during the 16 weeks experiment. The blood sampling was handled based on standard procedures to prevent sample damage, and the body weight was measured every two weeks. Sample analysis related to lipid regulation and creatine kinase activity was measured using spectrophotometric techniques according to the instructions of the Kit Randox protocol and analysis of blood plasma fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography. The research results show that legumes as a protein source can regulate through molecular signaling to decrease lipid levels, saturated fatty acids, and lipid transport in the extracellular fluid, but increase unsaturated fatty acid and the growth rate of ram lambs. Based on the results of the current study, it can be a strong basis for the development of nutrigenomic aspects of protein for small ruminants, accompanied by studies of the ages of different ruminant samples. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Leguminous trees and saltbushes provide potential alternatives to conventional feeds to overcome feed deficiency in arid and semi-arid countries. However, these plants are rich in antinutritional factors that have adverse effects on rumen microbiota and the host- animal. Some rumen microbiota detoxifies plants' secondary metabolites; thus, understanding plant-microbe interaction in the rumen could improve the plants' utilization. This study investigated the bacterial colonization and degradation of non-extracted and extracted tanniniferous plants: Atriplex halimus, Acacia saligna, and Leucaena leucocephala, in the rumen of three fistulated camels at 6 and 12 hours. The results showed that these plants have high nutritional value and tannins contents. The rumen degradation and microbial diversity of plant-attached bacteria varied according to plant type and phenols' extraction. Atriplex and leucaena showed higher microbial diversity at 6 and 12h, respectively. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the main bacterial phyla, and the main genera were Prevotella, RC9_gut_group, Butyrivibrio that overrepresented in non-extracted plants (P<0.05). Fibrobacteres and Anaerovibrio showed sensitivity to plant toxins and Ruminococcus attached to plants with lower tannins. Several bacterial genera in the camel rumen have the potential to resist antinutritional factors in fodder plants, which could be used to improve the performance of grazing animals. © 2023 Rabee et al.

AB  - Non-typhoidal invasive Salmonella (NTiS) diseases are one of the most important zoonoses in the world. This study explored the antipathogenic potential of twenty-four plants used in Benin folk medicine against NTiS diseases. The in vitro antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of ethanolic plant extracts were screened against clinical resistant isolates and ATCC reference strains of Salmonella. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-infected rat model was used to examine the in vivo antibacterial potential of plant extracts. Of the 24 plants, 18 plants exhibited antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.156 to 1.25 mg/mL. Anacardium occidentale, Artemisia afra, Detarium microcarpum, Detarium senegalense, and Leucaena leucocephala were the most active plant species. Extracts from A. afra, D. microcarpum, and D. senegalense showed biofilm inhibition greater than 50% against Salmonella clinical isolates. In the rat model of infection, A. afra and D. senegalense extracts were found to have an effective dose of less than 100 mg/kg and to stop the salmonellosis after 10 days of treatment. Additionally, these extracts did not produce any toxic effects in the treated animals. These results indicate clear evidence supporting the anti-Salmonella activity of A. afra and D. senegalense. Further studies are now needed to isolate bioactive compounds and to ensure the safety of these plant species. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Predicting the direction and magnitude of change in soil dynamics caused by invasive plant species has proven to be difficult because these changes are often reported to be species- and habitat-specific. This study was conducted to determine changes in three soil properties, eight soil ions, and seven soil microelements under established stands of four invasive plants, Prosopis juliflora, Ipomoea carnea, Leucaena leucocephala, and Opuntia ficus-indica. Soil properties, ions, and microelements were measured in sites invaded by these four species in southwest Saudi Arabia, and these values were compared to the results for the same 18 parameters from adjacent sites with native vegetation. Because this study was conducted in an arid ecosystem, we predict that these four invasive plants will significantly alter the soil properties, ions, and microelements in the areas they invaded. While the soils of sites with the four invasive plant species generally had higher values for soil properties and ions compared to sites with native vegetation, in most instances these differences were not statistically significant. However, the soils within sites invaded by I. carnea, L. leucocephala, and P. juliflora had statistically significant differences for some soil parameters. For sites invaded by O. puntia ficus-indica, no soil properties, ions, or microelements were significantly different compared to adjacent sites with native vegetation. Sites invaded by the four plant species generally exhibited differences in the 11 soil properties, but in no instance were these differences statistically significant. All three soil properties and one soil ion (Ca) were significantly different across the four stands of native vegetation. For the seven soil microelements, significantly different values were detected for Co and Ni, but only among stands of the four invasive plant species. These results indicate that the four invasive plant species altered soil properties, ions, and microelements, but for most of the parameters we assessed, not significantly. Our results do not support our initial prediction, but are in general agreement with previous published findings, which indicate that the effects of invasive plants on soil dynamics vary idiosyncratically among invasive species and among invaded habitats. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Edible mushrooms are increasingly recognized to offer health, environmental and socio-economical benefits across the globe. However, long cultivation time and low nutritional value of harvested mushrooms have remained the limiting factors for taping the benefits and sustainable production in developing counties. There is therefore a need to seek for alternative substrate formulations that would shorten cultivation time, increase the nutritional value of mushrooms as well as ensure environmental sustainability. This study examined the potential of using nutrient and biomass rich Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit foliage in combination with the rice straw (traditional substrate) to bolster production and nutritional value of Pleurotus floridanus mushroom in Morogoro, Tanzania. Mushrooms were grown in 30 × 40 cm 1.6 kg dry weight polythene bags in a randomized complete block design experiment with five treatments. The shortest cultivation period (average of 21 days) which stemmed largely from spawning to full mycelia colonization was attained when 5% Leucaena foliage was mixed with the rice straw. There was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in protein content from 23.3 to a maximum of 29.8%, when rice straw was supplemented with the 5% Leucaena, while further increase in Leucaena supplementation caused a lowering of crude protein content. There were significant increases (P < 0.05) in the contents of copper and calcium minerals when 5% of Leucaena foliage was incorporated into the growing substrate. Thus, to increase production cycle and contents of protein and essential minerals, addition of 5% of L. leucocephala foliage is recommended during production of P. floridanus using rice straw, for sustainability. © 2022 The Author

AB  - The purpose of this research is to know the influence of additional fermented fertilizer to the growth of plantlet Gracilaria sp. during acclimatization stage. The comparison of composition fermented fertilizer from Leucaena leucocephala leaves : Moringa oleifera leaves which used were 75%:25%, 50%:50%, 25%:75% and control without additional fermented fertilizer. The best plantlet growth after seven weeks testing, found in comparison 25%:75% with enhancement plantlet growth up till 32,4%, followed with comparison 50%:50% with enhancement plantlet growth up till 27,1%, the last with comparison 75%:25% and control which both show enhancement plantlet growth up till 13,5%. Based on this result, we carried out further testing with comparison 20%:80%, 15%:85%, 10%:90% and 5%:95% but the plantlet growth result only as much 12,67%; 26,67%; 24,67% and -0,09% so we recommend to use combination fermented fertilizer from Leucaena leucocephala leaves : Moringa oleifera leaves with comparison 25%:75% in acclimatization step since it's not only increase the weight but also the length and number of shoots. However, it's necessary to do further testing using other fertilizer raws to get better plantlet growth result. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background and Aim: Ipomoea aquatica (Water Spinach) is the most potential for livestock growth performance, including chickens, pigs, cattle, and goats, especially in a tropical country like Cambodia. It is not only an alternative feed source but also one kind of supplemented feed for goat raising. Supplementation with Water Spinach in the utilization of low-quality tree foliage results in an increase in dry matter intake in goat production. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of supplementation of Water Spinach in the utilization of Mimosa pigra and Leucaena leucocephala leaf in in vitro fermentation. Materials and Methods: The study was designed according to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement in randomized design of seven treatments with different ratios consisted of different three types of dietary treatments, including M. pigra, L. leucocephala, and Water Spinach. The treatments were arranged according to a completely randomized design and were as follow: T1 = M. pigra leaf (100%); T2 = L. leucocephala leaf (100%); T3 = M. pigra leaf and L. leucocephala leaf (50% and 50%); T4 = M. pigra leaf and Water Spinach (99.5% and 0.5%); T5 = L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach (99.5% and 0.5%); T6 = M. pigra leaf and Water Spinach (99% and 1%); and T7 = L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach (99% and 1%). A total of 200 mg (dry matter) of dietary treatments were prepared in a 60 mL syringe. Each treatment was replicated 3 time. Gas recording of each treatment lasted for 3 days. In vitro was performed for 72 h, was followed by Makkar method. Gas production was recorded at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h of incubation by using strict anaerobic technique. A mixture of rumen fluid and dietary treatments were carried out under continuous flushing with CO2 in sharking incubator at 39°C. After incubating for 72 h, the ammonia concentration (NH3-N) was measured and recorded to identify pH, nutrient digestibility, and ammonia concentration (NH3-N). Results: Nutrient digestibility of the treatment with Water Spinach supplement in the utilization of L. leucocephala was obtained at a higher digestibility than treatment with M. pigra (p < 0.05). Gas production was different between groups (p < 0.05). Treatment with only M. pigra leaf had the highest gas production (A), while treatment with Water Spinach supplementation had the lowest gas production (A). At 0–24 h, the treatment with L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach 0.5% had the highest gas production, but after 24 h, M. pigra leaf and Water Spinach 1% and L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach 0.5% produced more gas compared to the other treatments (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The supplementation of Water Spinach 1% in treatment with M. pigra and L. leucocephala leaf resulted in increased degradability, gas production, and NH3–N concentration without a change in the pH value rumen condition. Based on these results, it is recommended that the level of Water Spinach supplementation should be 1% of dietary intake. Future studies should consider investigating the rumen ecology associated with Water Spinach supplementation. Feeding with Water Spinach remains a good supplement for ruminant performance; therefore, further studies should be conducted using Water Spinach in ruminant feeding in both metabolic and feeding trials. © 2023 Authors.

AB  - Allelopathy is seen as one of the possible factors that favor the invasion of exotic plants in the environment, as these species, by releasing allelochemicals, can negatively interfere with the establishment of native plants, facilitating the growth and dissemination of invasive exotic plants. This study aimed to verify the possible allelopathic effects of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (leucaena) on native tree species Pterogyne nitens Tul. and Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Taub., via laboratory bioassays. We used Petri dishes containing seeds of native species and aqueous extract of leucaena leaves with 2, 4, 8, 10 and 20% concentrations (m/v) for germination tests and estimated the percentage, mean time, and germination speed index at the end of the germination period. For initial growth, we kept the Petri dishes containing aqueous leucaena extract and germinated seeds of native species in a germination chamber at 25 °C, and after 48 hours we obtained the length of the primary root, hypocotyl, and fresh and dry biomass of the seedlings. We obtained the a, b, and total chlorophyll and carotenoid content of seedling leaves kept in the aqueous extract at different concentrations. We verified the content of total phenolic compounds in mg/L from the aqueous leucaena extracts. Both native species showed a reduction in the percentage and germination speed index when in contact with the aqueous leucaena extracts at the highest concentrations. The initial growth of native species was also negatively affected, and P. nitens showed a reduction of all growth parameters analyzed in all concentrations of the aqueous extract. P. dubium showed a reduction in growth, especially at the highest concentrations. The effects can be associated with phenolic compounds present in leucaena extracts, and we found the highest total phenolic content in the extract with the highest concentration. The results show the allelopathic potential of leucaena, which may contribute to this plant ability to settle in natural areas. © 2023, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasing the availability of feed ingredients is important for the sustainability of livestock rearing. The use of agricultural waste as animal feed will not only improve food security but also contributes to the alleviation of environmental problems associated with waste management. This study aims to evaluate the growth performance of local sheep fed with agricultural waste in the form of silage and wafers. The study consisted of five treatments and four groups using 20 local male sheep. The results showed that feeding local sheep with agricultural waste in the form of silage and wafers had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on the dry matter, crude protein, and crude fat intake and was able to increase final body weights and feed efficiency compared to sheep fed with conventional feed. Processing of agricultural waste into silage and wafers can improve the performance of local sheep so that agricultural waste has great potential to be used as animal feed. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The relative palatability of woody perennials' fodder has been proposed as the selection criteria for species to be integrated in livestock systems. For that purpose, 20 species with different nutritional characteristics, that grow in the tropical dry forest of Colombia, were evaluated. The woody perennials were managed under pruning, in plots established at the Agrosavia's Nataima Research Center. Fodder of those species was offered to five mature Blanco Orejinegro (BON) cattle for a total of 19 days, using a cafeteria method with each species exposed to animals for only 3 minutes. The assignment of species was in pairs, with a total of 190 pairs, resulting from the combinations of 20 species taking two at the same time, without replication. The results of the palatability trials identified nine species with very high and high palatability, which ordered in a descending manner were: Albizia niopoides, Leucaena leucocephala, Erythrina fusca, Guazuma ulmifolia, Gliricidia sepium, Tithonia diversifolia, Clitoria fairchildiana, Spondias purpurea and Spondias mombin. The pair of species that showed the highest palatability was A. niopoides-L. leucocephala; and the species frequently present in combinations with high intake was A. niopoides. It is concluded that there are several native species with high relative palatability, whose forage potential is unknown by technicians and ranchers, and the high palatability of some species already known was confirmed. © Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales es una revista de acceso abierto publicada por el Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT), en asociación con el Instituto de Recursos Genéticos de Cultivos Tropicales de la Academia China de Ciencias Agrícolas Tropicales (TCGRI-CATAS).

AB  - Major regional gaps exist in the reporting and accessibility of naturalized plant species distribution data, especially within Southeast Asia. Here, we present the Malesian Naturalized Alien Flora database (MalNAF), the first standardized island-group level checklist of naturalized vascular plant species for the Malesian phytogeographical region. We used MalNAF to investigate the composition, origins, and habitat preferences of the naturalized flora. The naturalized vascular flora of Malesia consists of at least 1177 species. Richness is highest in the Philippines (539 spp.) and lowest in the Maluku Islands (87 spp.). But, the Lesser Sunda Islands had the highest naturalized species richness relative to native richness and Singapore has a higher naturalized plant species richness than would be expected given its size. When comparing the data for Malesia with a global dataset, we found that naturalized richness increased with area for islands but not for continental regions. Across the archipelago, 31 species are widespread, occurring in every island group, but the majority have a limited distribution of 2.4 ± 2.3 (mean ± SD) island groups per naturalized species. The naturalized plant species are representatives of 150 families, twenty of which are newly introduced to the region. Families richest in naturalized plant species in Malesia were Fabaceae (= Leguminosae) (160 spp.), Poaceae (= Gramineae) (138 spp.), and Asteraceae (= Compositae) (96 spp.). Most of these have a native range that includes tropical Asia, closely followed by those from Southern America (inclusive of the Caribbean, Central and South America), although at the island-group level, most have a higher proportion with a Southern American native range. Most naturalized species occur in anthropogenic habitats, but many are present in “natural” habitats with fewer species, such as Leucaena leucocephala, reported from specialized habitats like drylands. MalNAF provides a baseline for future studies of naturalized plant species distributions in the region. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Slope erosion and shallow failures occur in developed areas in Malaysia as a result of the natural vegetation removal, resulting in soil disturbance and greater exposure of bare ground. The use of bioengineering techniques through vegetation is a preferred solution to these problems by providing cover from rainfall and reinforcing the soil through root systems. Considering the potential of bioengineering in slope management, the current study aims to (i) review slope bioengineering techniques that uses vegetation to stabilise slope in Malaysia and (ii) highlight research gaps. Findings were discussed from 17 original studies published between 2000 and 2020, which were selected from the output of four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar), several grey literature works, and local scientific publications. The studies on bioengineering using vegetation recorded that several slope species with superior performance in terms of beneficial traits, such as root length density and transpiration rate, were more prominent in Melastoma malabathricum and Leucaena leucocephala. Moreover, previous studies identified biomaterials that protected slopes, including empty fruit bunch and geotextiles, despite the currently critical limitations in the applicability of these techniques. This study highlighted the research gaps that may lead to the progress of the bioengineering techniques, such as beneficial traits and techniques, the exploration of mix-culture systems, and the utilisation of modelling techniques. This review serves as a structured and current overview of bioengineering knowledge for shallow slope instability and erosion management in Malaysia. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the effect of three energy concentrates on dietary nitrogen utilisation efficiency, milk production and milk composition. Twelve dual-purpose cows fed in a silvopastoral (SSP) system with Leucaena leucocephala and Digitaria swazilandensis were fed four treatments, supplemented with 25 MJ/cow/day of sorghum, molasses and gluconeogenic precursors, plus the control treatment, using a 4×4 Latin square experimental design with three replicates and experimental periods of 14 days and a total duration of 56 days. No significant differences were found for milk yield, milk chemical composition and milk urea nitrogen (MUN). No significant differences were found for cow live weight and dry matter intake. Forage analysis showed significant difference for crude protein (CP) concentration. There was no significant difference for average values of dry matter (DM) yield, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), lignin and in vitro DM matter. For Leucaena, a significant difference was found only in DM yield, with period 4 being the highest yielding period compared to periods 1, 2 and 3. There was no significant difference for CP, NDF, ADF, lignin and in vitro DM digestibility. This work allows to understand the interaction of CP metabolism with DM. It is concluded that SSP provides sufficient dietary energy to cows in production for dual-purpose cows ranching. © 2023 Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of replacing fish meal with Leucaena leucocephala leaf powder on survival, growth performance, digestive enzyme activities, biochemical body composition and muscle texture of the white-leg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931). Five different diets were examined, by replacing fish meal with L. leucocephala leaf powder at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20%, in triplicates. Shrimps were stocked in 0.5 m3 tanks @ 70 shrimps per tank and fed on the experimental diets for a period of 60 days. The results showed that the survival rate (%), daily weight gain (g day-1), specific growth rate (% day-1), feed intake (% fish-1 day-1), feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, and protein retention were not significantly different (p>0,05) among the treatment groups. The values of α-amylase and pepsin in the stomach and chymotrypsin (mU min-1 mg protein-1) in the intestine were not significantly different among treatments. However, the value of α-amylase in the intestine was significantly higher in animals fed diets that replaced fish meal with L. leucocephala leaf powder at 0, 5 and 10% compared to other treatments. The biochemical constituents (except for lipid) and the texture (N) of shrimp meat were not significantly different among treatment groups. The results suggested that L. leucocephala leaf powder could replace fish meal up to 20% in white-leg shrimp diets. © 2023, Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the key targets and potential mechanisms of action of C. alba and C. glabra in the treatment of C. neoformans through bioinformatics, network pharmacology and molecular docking, and to elucidate the main targets and signaling pathways that produce therapeutic effects. METHODS: The dataset GSE164805 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the limma R package was used to search for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal patient samples and COVID-19 patient samples, and the DEGs were subjected to gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway enrichment. The DEGs were analyzed, and the DEGs were combined with drug targets and imported into the Gene/Protein Interaction Search Tool String database to form a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The PPI network was screened for functional modules using Cytoscope software, and the genes with the top 5 Degree values were defined as core genes. Subsequently, immune cell infiltration analysis was performed on the disease dataset to explore immune cell infiltration in COVID-19 patients. Finally, MOE software was applied to complete molecular docking. RESULTS: Based on the dataset GSE164805, 4651 differentially expressed genes were obtained from the screening, and Luteinum vulgare contained 20 active components and 13 active components of Chuanbeimu, which corresponded to 652 targets, and 103 potential targets of action. protein interaction network analysis showed that SRC, PTGS2, NFKBIA, CDC42, and IGF1R were the core targets, and drug-target-constituent-disease network analysis showed Luteanin, Berberine, (S)-Canadine as core compounds. Immune cell infiltration results showed that Plasma cells, T cells and other immune cells were highly expressed in COVID-19 patient samples, and T cells CD8 and other places. The molecular docking results showed that the core protein showed good binding ability (binding energy <-5.5 kcal-mol-1) with the core compounds. CONCLUSION: The active ingredient targets and pathways of action in C. alba and C. kawakawa showed significant enrichment in counteracting inflammatory responses and reversing airway remodeling, which is consistent with the mechanism of action for the treatment of neocoronary pneumonia, and has a promising prospect for development in the prevention and treatment of neocoronary pneumonia.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - We investigated the influence of seed-feeding beetles (Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae) and their parasitoids on the germination performance of two Fabaceae, Leucaena leucocephala and Senna multijuga. We collected 150 fruits per species in forest fragments in the city of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil, between July and August 2020. Seeds were examined and separated into predated and non-predated categories. The predated category was divided into two subcategories: predated by Coleoptera (Bruchinae) (PCO) and predated in the presence of Coleoptera parasitoids (PARCO). The non-predated category was divided into artificially injured (AI), intact seeds without insect infestation (IS), and intact seeds with insect infestation (SIF). Seeds of S. multijuga and L. leucocephala germinated to 40% and 30%, respectively. PCO and PARCO seeds not only had a negative and restricting influence on S. multijuga germination (no germination) but also contributed to a large proportion of non-viable predated seeds (38%). PCO (7%) and PARCO (23%), on the other hand, improved L. leucocephala germination. This work represents one of the first attempt to evaluate the parasitoid effect on seeds germination. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the effect of herbivore predation and the presence of parasitoids on host plant seed germination, which can be critical to mother plant fitness depending on plant species. Further studies are necessary to determine the extend seed consumption by beetles and the presence of their parasitoids may facilitate or impair seed germination, and consequently plant fitness in other systems. © 2022

AB  - Climate change, land degradation, and desertification lead to the loss of carbon present in the soil and plants. The carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere has reached 412 ppm. This is a rise of 47% since the start of the industrial period, when the concentration was close to 280 ppm. Therefore, the sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere to earth is the need of the hour. Many scientists have suggested agroforestry as a potent instrument for climate change mitigation as well as to fetch lucrative benefits. The Indian government is also promulgating tree-based systems for increasing tree cover up to 33% of the total geographical area to mitigate climate change. Therefore, the expansion of the commercial agroforestry system of fast-growing tree species producing higher biomass could be a sustainable and ecologically benign technique to sequester carbon, increase green cover, and improve the financial status of farmers. This review highlights the commercial agroforestry systems, biomass and carbon sequestration potential, and case studies of poplar and eucalyptus. The species such as poplar (Populus deltoides), nilgiri (Eucalyptus spp.), subabul (Leucaena leucocephala), tree of heaven (Ailanthus excelsa), willow (Salix spp.), malabar neem (Melia dubia), cadamba (Neolamarckia cadamba), and white teak (Gmelina arborea) are the suitable tree species for carbon sequestration under agroforestry. Among these species, poplar and eucalyptus are major agroforestry tree species that have been adopted by millions of farmers in India since the 1990s. Indo-Gangetic plains are considered the birthplace of commercial or industrial agroforestry, as poplar and eucalyptus are widely planted. This review reports that poplar and eucalyptus have the potential to sequester carbon stock of 212.7 Mg C ha−1 and 237.2 Mg C ha−1, respectively. Further, the net carbon sequestration rate in poplar and eucalyptus was 10.3 and 12.7 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, respectively. In conclusion, the commercial agroforestry system was very successful in the Indo-Gangetic regions of the country but needs further expansion with suitable compatible crops in different parts of the country. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is the most common non-communicable disease in the Philippines, characterized by increased blood glucose levels brought by low insulin production or insulin resistance. Chamaecostus cuspidatus is a medicinal plant known for its glucose-lowering property. The controlled release of the C. cuspidatus leaves must be achieved to maximize its antidiabetic property. Leucaena leucocephala is an endemic tree in the Philippines, having its seed as a source of possible co-encapsulating material for drug delivery. Galactomannan, as the main component of the isolated seed gum, can be used as a substitute for an effective moderate drug release to its intended site. Thus, this study evaluates the drug release property and stability of seed gum as a co-encapsulating agent for targeted and controlled delivery of the C. cuspidatus leaves. The encapsulation process of the C. cuspidatus leaves was done through the extrusion method. The stability of the encapsulation was evaluated through in vitro gastrointestinal simulation analysis and was examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) to verify its surface morphology. The capsules were observed to fully disintegrate at the fed state (pH 5.4) of the simulated gastrointestinal conditions, which is the target site. The fingerprint on the FTIR spectra of the encapsulated drug presented indicates the successful incorporation of the powdered leaves inside the encapsulating material. Morphological micrographs have shown that the resulting capsules were fairly in spherical, having a size of approximately 3.8 mm. Ridges and pores are also present on the surface of the capsules for their immediate disintegration and hydration. Therefore, the L. leucocephala seed gum can be a potential candidate as a co-encapsulating material suitable for effective, targeted, and controlled delivery of C. cuspidatus leaves for maximum antidiabetic benefits. © 2023,Journal of Microbiology, Biotechnology and Food Sciences.

AB  - This study aimed to prepare activated carbon obtained from biomass waste of lamtoro fruit peel, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) (LAC), and analyze its physical as well as electrochemical properties. The preparation process used a simple, uncomplicated, and cost-effective technique that does not require additional adhesive to increase the use value of biomass waste. Furthermore, impregnation with low ZnCl2concentrations at 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 M was performed to maximize the potential of LAC to produce the best conditions from the electrode with the highest specific capacitance. The results showed that the LAC-0.3 sample had the best physical and electrochemical properties with the carbon content reaching 93.05 % and the availability of 6.89 % oxygen heteroatom doping. Besides, the large number of irregular porous lumps in the sample can increase the electrochemical performance of the carbon electrode from 74F/g to 176F/g, with an optimum energy density of 26.81 Wh kg-1and a power density of 96.6 W kg-1obtained using the GCD method. Electrochemical testing for LAC samples was carried out at a low potential of 0-1 V with a scan rate of 1 mV s-1and an aqueous electrolyte of 1 M H2SO4. These findings showed the extraordinary potential of lamtoro fruit peel waste as a basic material for making activated carbon electrodes for supercapacitor with competitive capacitance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In traditional poultry farming, the consumption of fresh plants is an important part of the diet and a fundamental component of the indigenous poultry raising technique. Therefore, the objective is to know the studies that have included some quelites for feeding domestic birds. Quelite is a term used to refer to edible tender plants which are used as a whole plant, sprouts, branches, leaves, petioles, stems or flowers. The present review will consider the quelites Amaranth (Amarantus sp.), Chepil (Crotalaria longirostrada), Epazote (Dysphania ambrosioides), Blackberry (Solanum americanum), Holy grass (Piper autitum), Guaje (Leucaena leucocephala), Huazontle (Chenopodium berlandieri subsp. nuttalliae) and Purslane (Portuca olerecea). Nutritional and nutraceutical characteristics of these chelites are presented. In tests of egg and meat production, both in hens and in native turkeys, the main results of these studies are presented. The use of quelites in poultry farming has begun to be tested in order to reduce production costs, without af fecting the productive variables or the quality of eggs or meat. Although contradictory information has been reported, there is enough evidence to continue this line of study. It is proven that quelites have dif ferent nutritional and nutraceutical properties, which are intended to be used in favor of producers and consumers; however, much research is lacking. © 2023 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

AB  - Nitrogen metabolism and the production of primary and secondary metabolites vary according to biotic and abiotic factors such as trace elements (TE) stress, and can, therefore, be considered biomarkers. The present study evaluated the effect of copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) TE, separately, on the metabolism of nitrogen compounds and biomass production, partitioned into shoot and roots of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit., and identified possible defense mechanisms linked to nitrogen metabolism. At 120 days of cultivation, the biomass production of L. leucocephala was higher when exposed to excess Fe than Cu. Nonetheless, the biomass gain (%) of plants exposed to Cu was higher, especially the biomass gains in roots. The tolerance and biomass production of L. leucocephala is related to the regulation of nitrogen metabolism and production of secondary metabolites. The biochemistry of plant metabolism against the excess of Cu and Fe TE manifested similarly, but with some specifics regarding the chemical nature of each metal. There was a reduction in the content of ureides and proteins and an increase in amino acids in the roots in relation to the increase in Cu and Fe concentrations. There was low accumulation of proline in the roots in treatments 400 and 500 mg/dm3 compared to the control for both TE. On the other hand, the total phenolic compounds in the roots increased. Our results indicate that the increased synthesis of amino acids and the accumulation of phenolic compounds is involved in the tolerance of L. leucocephala to Cu and Fe. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - The main of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementation of tropical tree foliage in ruminant diets on the in vitro fermentation, bacterial population, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and enteric CH4 production. Seven experimental diets were evaluated: a control treatment of Pennisetum purpureum (T7) and six treatments of P. purpureum supplemented (30%) with the foliage of Neomillspaughia emargiata (T1), Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia (T2), Caesalpinia gaumeri (T3), Piscidia piscipula (T4), Leucaena leucocephala (T5), and Havardia albicans (T6). The T2, T7, and T5 treatments had the highest (p < 0.05) digestibility of dry matter. Overall, supplementation increased (p < 0.05) the concentrations of propionic and butyric acid and decreased acetic acid. Methanogenic bacteria decreased (p < 0.05) in T1, T2, T5, and T6. Ruminococcus albus decreased in T1, T2, T3, and T5 and Selenomonas ruminiantum increased in T3. Fibrobacter succinogenes increased, except in T5. Methane production decreased (p < 0.05) in T1, T4, T5, and T6. The supplementation with Leucaena leucocephala, Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia, Neomillspaughia emargiata, Piscidia piscipula, Havardia albicans, and Caesalpinia gaumeri is a potential alternative nutritional strategy for ruminants that results in positive changes in VFAs profile, a decrease on CH4 production and methanogenic bacteria, and changes on fibrolytic and non-fibrolytic bacteria composition.HIGHLIGHTS Tropical tree foliage supplementation increased propionic and butyric acid and decreased acetic acid concentrations. Fibrolytic, non-fibrolytic, and Methanogenic bacteria were selectively modulated with the supplementation of tropical tree foliage. The enteric methane (CH4) production decreased with the supplementation of tree foliage. The supplementation of Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia and Leucaena leucocephala had the highest digestibility and is a potential alternative nutritional strategy for ruminants. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The application of coffee agroforestry has several advantages, such as increasing the cycle of nutrients and soil organic matter as well as improving soil physical properties. However, there is st ill an information gap related to the interaction between coffee plants and shade plant roots. This study aimed to evaluate coffee agroforestry on available water capacity (AWC) and root length density (RLD). The research was carried out at the smallholder coffee plantation in Dampit District in four shade types (coffee-open, shaded with Leucaena leucocephala and shaded with L. leucochepala). Soil and root samples were taken at three depths (0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and 40-60 cm) and at two distances (near the coffee stems and between the coffee shade). The variables observed were AWC, RLD, soil organic C, soil aggregate stability, and soil penetration resistance. The result was coffee plants with shade trees increased AWC value and root density compared to coffee-open. The type of shade significantly affected RLD, where shaded with Gliricidia sepium, and shaded with L. leucochepala were better than coffee-open. This indicates that there was no root competition between coffee plants and shade trees. However, shaded with Musa sp. had lower RLD than coffee-open. Soil depth had a significant effect on the AWC value and root length density of coffee plants, where the most AWC values and coffee root distribution were higher at a depth of 0-20 cm. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - This experiment investigated the effect of dried Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and cassava (Manihot esculenta) leaves on feed intake, milk production, and milk composition of Holstein Friesian x Ankole crossbred cows. Three cows in early lactation, with initial milk production of 4 ± 1.20 kg/day and 359 ± 24 kg average live body weight, were randomly assigned to the experimental diet in a 3x3 Latin square design. Three 15-day experimental periods were adopted (1 to 10-day: diet adaptation and 11 to 15-day: data collection). Cows were fed on freshly chopped Guatemala grass diet supplemented with 1.25 kg DM of brewers’ spent grain (control). The experimental diets were similar to the control diet differing in the presence of dried Leucaena or cassava leaves, both at the inclusion rate of 20% of the basal diet intake. Total dry matter intake, nutrient intake, milk production, and milk composition showed significant variation among treatments. Cows supplemented with dried cassava leaves had higher total dry matter intake and organic matter intake. Leucaena significantly increased (p<0.001) daily milk production by 15% compared to cassava (3%). Leucaena had a higher milk fat content (38.44 g), while cassava and the control diet had higher milk protein (38.53 and 38.43 g), lactose (56.79 g and 56.111 g), and not-fat solids (102.41 g and 101.27 g). These results indicate that dried Leucaena and cassava leaves can be used as protein supplements for Guatemala grass basal diet for crossbred cows to improve milk production and quality. © 2023, Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - Fodder shrubs are important dry season feed sources for livestock in semi-arid environments. It has been proposed that a mixture of leguminous with non-leguminous shrubs may increase rates of N cycling and improve biomass and fodder quality. The objective of the present study was to assess the biomass productivity and fodder quality of leguminous shrubs growing a mixture with non-leguminous shrubs. Three shrub species—the legume Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) and the non-legumes Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) and Moringa oleifera (Lam.)—were grown as legume/non-legume mixtures and as monocultures. Total fodder production and quality were estimated over five harvests at three-month intervals. The Leucaena–Guazuma mixture had the largest fodder production (9045 kg ha−1 year−1), followed by the Leucaena monocrop (7750 kg ha−1 year−1). Total nitrogen accumulation in the foliage was also high in the Leucaena–Guazuma mixture, reaching 282 kg ha−1 year−1; the Leucaena monocrop accumulated 244 kg N, while the Moringa monocrop took up only 46 kg N ha−1. The concentration of polyphenols was high in Leucaena and Guazuma, while Moringa had the lowest value. The high survival and excellent growth rates, as well as the high foliage production observed in Leucaena and Guazuma, suggest that they have the potential to provide high-quality fodder for livestock. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Decomposition and N release pattern from the leaves of three shrubs species were studied under field conditions. Leaves of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.), Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) and Moringa oleifera (Lam.) and two mixtures, Leucaena + Moringa and Leucaena + Guazuma, in a complete randomized block design, were studied during the dry and wet seasons. Litterbags were randomly distributed in each experimental block and placed on the soil surface, and residues were recovered after 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks. Double exponential model decay was better fitted to describe the pattern of the decay of the release of various leaf constituents. Litter dry weight loss and N release were faster from Moringa, followed by the Leucaena + Moringa mixture, while the Guazuma leaf litter decomposed much slower. In the wet period, a rapid N release was observed for Moringa (60%) and Leucaena + Moringa (43%) in the first two weeks. In contrast, Guazuma and the Leucaena + Guazuma mixture released about 46% of N in 16 weeks. In the dry period, leaves released most of their N during the first 8 to 16 weeks. Moringa and Leucaena + Moringa ranked first, having lost 81 and 75% of its initial N, respectively. The ratios of condensed tannin and polyphenols to N were significantly correlated with the N released. It was concluded that the initial mass loss from the leaf litter was high and rapid in the rainy period in comparison to the dry period. The residue disappearance pattern of Moringa, Leucaena and Leucaena + Moringa followed an asymptotic model, with more than 80% of the original residue released during the 16-week study period. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The level of sediment deposited in the Lake Ziway is increasing through time as a result of soil erosion, and eventually the depth of the lake has decreased. Therefore, the objective of the study was to assess farmers' perception of soil erosion and the conservation measures to the surrounding areas of Lake Ziway in the central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. The survey was made using purposive sampling techniques. The survey has considered the 14 Kebeles from the 3 districts adjacent to the lake. From each Kebele, 10 respondents were selected randomly. Totally, 140 respondents were selected from the community. The descriptive statistic was used to compare the dependent variables. The majority of respondents (92.2%) have observed the presence of soil erosion in the study area. The hillsides and slope areas are the major sources of soil erosion, according to 80% of the respondents. The respondents that have identified the most and least susceptible soils to erosion by their textural classes are sand soil (Biyyo Chirecha) (57.1%) and soft clay soil (Biyyo Bole) (1.4%), respectively. The soil erosion is increasing in their cultivated land and surrounding areas. The study has found that most of the respondents (86.5%) are participating in soil and water conservation activities. Leucaena leucocephala, Faidherbia albida, Azadirachta indica, and Schinus molle are the dominant tree species planted in the study area for soil and water conservation purposes. In conclusion, there is heavy soil loss due to erosion on cultivated land from the upland which directly deposited to Lake Ziway as sediment which decreases the lake depth. The study recommends that appropriate soil and water conservation measures and land management should be implemented on erosion prone areas in the Lake Ziway watershed with full participation of all stakeholders including the local farmers. © 2023 Daniel Jaleta Negasa.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effect of leaf meals on the mik production of Friesian Holstein (FH) dairy cows. The 15 FH dairy cows were 5–6 years old and 3–5 months in lactation with a range in milk production of 9–12 kg/d. The leaf meal supplements used as feed comprised elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum), leaf meal of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and Mulberry (Morus alba), partially replacing rice bran, coconut cakel, fish meal, maize epidermis, molasses, and minerals. This study used a completely randomized design with five replications for each of the three treatments: feed concentrate without leaf meal (control, CTL), feed concentrate wit 25% leaf meal (LM25) and feed concentrate with 50% leaf meal (LM50). Feeding the leaf meal to FH dairy cows had no effect on total dry matter intake. However, there was a linear increase in milk yield, and a depression in milk fat, as the level of leaf meal in the diet was increased. © 2023 Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.

AB  - Infections caused by pathogenic bacteria are a recurrent problem in the livestock sector, generating important economic losses in the livestock industry. One of the main strategies includes antibiotic therapy; however, its use is limited since pathogenic bacteria present resistance to these drugs, which makes treatment against microbial infections difficult. Therefore, the hypothesis proposed was that ethanolic extracts of native plants from the state of Sonora, Mexico, can inhibit the growth of Gram (+) and Gram (-) pathogenic bacteria related to common infections in the livestock industry. The objective was to evaluate the phytochemical and antimicrobial profile of native plants from the state of Sonora, Mexico. In this study, 17 ethanolic extracts were obtained from native plants of Sonora, and the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the agar diffusion method and by the microdilution technique using reference bacteria from the ATCC collection. The phytochemical profile was evaluated by spectrophotometry and the experimental design used was completely randomized with three replicates per treatment at 95 % confidence. The results showed that extracts of Prosopis velutina, Ibervillea sonorae, Populus alba, Ambrosia ambrosioides, Krameria sonorae, and Leucaena leucocephala were effective in eliminating Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (p ≤ 0.05). In addition, these extracts presented the highest concentration of total polysaccharides, flavones and flavonols, flavanones and dihydroflavonols, tannins and total chlorogenic acid (p ≤ 0.05). Therefore, plant extracts from Sonora, Mexico, represent a natural alternative for the control of Gram (+) and Gram (-) pathogens of importance to the livestock industry. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 4.0 International license.

AB  - Environmental pollution by textile dye-based wastewater raises a vital call for consideration to industrialists and scientists due to its influence on the ecosystem. In this study, zinc oxide (ZnO), copper oxide (CuO), Manganese dioxide (MnO2), and Magnesium Oxide (MgO) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized from Leucaena leucocephala leaves for the removal of Reactive Golden Yellow-145 (RY-145) and Direct Red-31 (DR-31) dyes. The nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Optimization of various operating parameters like initial dye concentration, pH, temperature, contact time, and dose of nanoparticles was investigated. The results showed that Leucaena leucocephala leaf-mediated ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and MgO nanoparticles presented the highest adsorption capacities for RY-145 of 47.50 (mg/g), 65.53(mg/g), 53.62 (mg/g), and 58.72 (mg/g) respectively, with optimized parameter values of pH solution, contact time, adsorbent dose, initial dye concentration, and temperature were 3, 75 min, 0.05 g/50 mL, 100 mg/L and 25°C on 124 rpm, correspondingly. DR-31 presented the highest adsorption capacities of 57.08 (mg/g), 83.47(mg/g), 67.36 (mg/g), and 72.53 (mg/g) respectively at optimized parameter values of pH solution, contact time, adsorbent dose, initial dye concentration and temperature were 2 and 3, 60min, 0.05 g/50 mL, 100 mg/L and 25°C on 124 rpm. The surfactants and electrolytes effects were also scrutinized on dyes' adsorption. The surfactants and electrolytes' existence in the aqueous media reduced the adsorption of dye because of the competition for limited binding sites. The RY-145 and DR-31 adsorbents adsorption efficiencies were found in following order; MgO (65.52% and 83.47%) > MnO2 (58.72% and 72.53%) > CuO (53.62% and 67.36%) > ZnO (47.50% and 57.08%). The adsorption-based dye data were scrutinized using various isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics models. The studies presented that the adsorption processes were well fitted to pseudo-second-order kinetics since correlation coefficient (R2) values ranged from 0.994 to 0.999 and Intraparticle diffusion models correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.88 to 0.97, their values were relatively near the experimental values signify the adsorption kinetics in both dyes. Both dyes adsorption on green nano-adsorbents followed a Langmuir isotherm due to decent correlation coefficient values of 0.999 with value of 59.17 (mg/g), 66.22 (mg/g), 72.99 (mg/g), and 81.30 (mg/g) respectively for DR-31 and 47.62 (mg/g), 53.763 (mg/g), 58.48 (mg/g), and 64.93 (mg/g) for RY-145 with monolayer coverage. RY-145 also followed Temkin and Doubinin Radushkevich's isotherm. The thermodynamics investigations revealed spontaneous dyes adsorption onto MgO and MnO2, ZnO is non-spontaneous in both dyes while CuO is spontaneous in DR-31 and non-spontaneous in RY-145. The maximum desorption of 78–86% was attained using the 0.2 N and 0.4 N NaOH for adsorbed RY-145 and DR-31 dye respectively. The desorption data was favorable as the Leucaena leucocephala leaf-mediated ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and MgO nanoparticles adsorbents were utilized several cycles and have stability This experimental study also determines the potential efficacy of green nano-adsorbents for the removal of dye from the real textile effluent. In addition, a phytotoxicity investigation of used green nano-adsorbents is carried out on the pea seeds, to demonstrate their sustainability from a real environmental point of view. Thus, Because of their promising efficiency, green ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and MgO nanoparticles have the potential to apply for dye adsorption from textile wastewater. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was the investigation of how adsorbents made from Leucaena leucocephala (L. Leu) leaf and bark materials were effective in treating wastewater containing methyl red dye (MeReD). The functional groups in the phytochemical elements from the bark and leaves of L.Leu offer active surface sites and enable the adsorption mechanism. The investigations were done in batch mode. Contact time, adsorbent dose concentration, temperature, pH, and initial MeReD concentration were all examined as significant parameters impacting the sorption process. The study found that significant MeReD removal efficiency was achieved after 90 min of contact time, pH 4.0 units, 1.2 gm/L adsorbent dose concentration, 100 ppm initial MeReD quantity, and 30oC temperature. The developed adsorbents were applied to samples gathered from dye companies in Hyderabad and Guntur. The extraction of MeReD (81.2% to 90.0%) from untreated wastewater contaminated with MeReD using developed adsorbents was very efficient. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

AB  - The huge areas of land and wide range of vegetation of Bangladesh provide highly diverse habitats for wild mushrooms that are utilized as food, medicine, nutritional supplements, and minerals for humans. Although mushroom research and production have increased in the country, several different challenges still exist concerning the identification, preservation, and cultivation of wild mushrooms. In this chapter, we describe and evaluate the currently known Bangladeshi diversity of wild mushrooms, their distribution, ecology, and utilization. The sampling regions were tropical moist deciduous forest (TMDF), tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen (TESF), mangrove forest (MF), Gajni forest (GF), and social forest (SF) regions, as well as parks, gardens, and the National Zoo of Dhaka city (PGZD). The mushrooms associated with these jungle territories were photographed, collected, preserved, and analyzed both morphologically and anatomically. A total of 632 wild mushroom samples were collected from 79 sampling sites and a total of 68 wild mushroom genera are identified from Bangladesh. The most predominant genus was Ganoderma with a frequency of 27.20% and a density of 31.20%. Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia saman, Swietenia mahagoni, Terminalia arjuna, and Dalbergia sissoo are common hosts for most of the wild mushrooms in Bangladesh. The most frequent family recorded was the Ganodermataceae, which made up 26.79% of all samples. A total of 16 Bangladeshi wild mushroom genera are edible, 16 are inedible, 25 are medicinal, and 11 are toxic. Documentation and subsequent utilization of diverse elements present in wild mushroom species are needed to fulfill the future food and health security challenge of the unstabilizing hunger of the world. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Abstract: The present study was aimed at curating a porous KCl crosslinked hydrogel with purified subabul galactomannans (SG) from the defatted seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) and κ-carrageenan (κC) by inducing whey protein isolate (WPI). WPI showed 345% foam overrun and minimal foam drainage (%) at 70°C when whipped for 5 min at pH 6.8 in the hydrogel prepared with 6.5% w/v SG + 1% w/v κC + 0.63% w/v KCl + 2% w/v WPI. The SG and WPI incorporated porous hydrogel (SGWP) showed maximum G′ (3010 Pa) and frequency independence (>30 Hz) at 65°C. NMR (1H), scanning electron microscopy, and thermal characterization of SGWP showed a crosslinked microporous gel network formation. SGWP had high water uptake rate (Q) (432%) at 45°C. The stability of SGWP at neutral pH and high temperature (65°C) added an impetus to this study as it could be used for a wide range of applications. Hence the protein–polysaccharide complexation improvised the functional properties of the porous hydrogels. The results suggested a possible valorization of galactomannans from subabul, a forest resource, into a porous hydrogel suitable as a matrix for delivery of bioactive(s) or an aerogel for multifarious industrial applications. Practical Application: A porous hydrogel is defined as a solid, or collection of solid bodies, with sufficient open space to enable a fluid to pass through or around them. Leucaena leucocephala seed (forest resource) galactomannans are non-starch polysaccharides having weak gelling capacity. Whey protein isolates (WPI) are a dairy industry byproduct having excellent foaming properties. Incorporation of WPI in the hydrogel prepared with subabul galactomannan and κ-carrageenan using KCl as a crosslin could form a stable porous structure having high water uptake rate (Q) at neutral pH and elevated temperature. The hydrogel so developed could be a step toward circular economy. © 2023 Institute of Food Technologists.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a plant that is used as animal and human food worldwide. This plant contains the toxic compound namely L-mimosine. The main mechanism of action of this compound involves its ability to chelate metal ions, which may interfere with the proliferative activity of cells and being studied for the treatment of cancer. However, little is known about the effect of L-mimosine on immune responses. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of L-mimosine on immune responses in Wistar rats. Different doses of L-mimosine (25, 40 and 60 mg/kg body weight/day) were administered orally by gavage to adult rats for 28 days. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed in animals, but a decrease in the T-dependent response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in animals treated with 60 mg/kg L-mimosine and an increase in the intensity of S. aureus phagocytosis by macrophages in animals treated with 40 or 60 mg/kg L-mimosine were observed. Therefore, these findings suggest that L-mimosine did not compromise macrophage activity and inhibited T-dependent clonal expansion during the immune response. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental pollution caused by organic pollutants, radionuclides, and potentially toxic elements (PTEs) affects the quality of the biosphere (water, air, and soil). Rapid industrial growth, mining, agricultural inputs, sewage water, and industrial effluents application in soil all contribute to contamination. Remediation of these valuable resources, as well as prevention of new pollutants, have long been required to avoid negative health effects. Several remediation strategies have been applied for environmental pollutants. Phytoremediation is potentially a viable and promising approach which uses green plants to remove, detoxify, or degrade toxic PTEs from the environment. In this review, the application of phytotechnology for pollutants removal and their underlying mechanisms (phytoextraction/phytoaccumulation, phytotransformation, phytostimulation, phytovolatilization, phytorhizodegration, and phytostabilization) were studied. The current study pointed out that the efficiency of phytoremediation can be affected by various factors such as treatment time, temperature, pH, EC, OM, plant density, electric field, and chelating agents. In the end, this review systematically summarized existing knowledge, merits/demerits, prospects, and future aspects of the phytoremediation for remediating polluted soil and water bodies.

AB  - Annual crops and pastures in monoculture frequently have negative effects on ecosystem services due to soil and biodiversity losses. Silvopastoral systems (SSP) have been proposed as an alternative for livestock production systems; however, there are few studies that demonstrate their benefits on soil health. For that reason, this study was established to evaluate the effect of different land uses on soil health measured through chemical indicators. For this purpose, the following land uses managed for at least 19 years were evaluated: (i) intensive maize (Zea mays) production, (ii) a guinea (Megathyrsus maximus) and angleton (Dichantium aristatum) mixed pasture, (iii) SSP with grasses and shrubs of totumo (Cresentia cujete) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), (iv) a multistrata SSP with the same grasses and shrubs plus tree fodder species: (Cassia grandis, Albizia saman and Guazuma ulmifolia); and (v) a secondary forest used as a reference. The evaluations were made in contrasting seasons (dry and rainy), in soils of the Middle Sinú river valley (Colombia), with a drainage gradient. In general, the soils of the SPS presented the highest values for MOS, total N, Mg, B, N-NO3 and CICE, the grass alone pasture presented the highest values in micronutrients: Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn and S and NH4, and lower values for pH, P and NOx, and the highest for Al; whereas, intermediate values for all chemical indicators were obtained in the secondary forest. In contrast, soils cultivated with corn presented the poorest chemical indicators. It is concluded that SSP improve the chemical indicators of soil health as compared to the grass alone pasture and corn monoculture. © 2023,Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales una revista de acceso abierto publicada por el Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT), en asociación con el Instituto de Recursos Genéticos de Cultivos Tropicales de la Academia China de Ciencias Agrícolas Tropicales (TCGRI-CATAS).

AB  - Gayo coffee is one of the leading commodities originating from the Gayo Highlands, one of which is Bener Meriah Regency. The Gayo coffee commodity cultivated by farmers is Arabica coffee, consisting of Gayo 1, Gayo 2, and Gayo 3 clones. Arabica coffee has been developed by the Gayo community for many years with a continuous cultivation system throughout the year. This coffee farming business is relatively advanced, various introductions have been made, which are based on experience gained from generation to generation (location specific) so that it can affect the performance of the coffee farming business being cultivated. The use of cultivated land for years with a coffee cultivation system causes a decrease in land fertility, resulting in a decrease in coffee production. This study aims to determine the location-specific cultivation techniques for Arabica coffee in Bener Meriah Regency that have been carried out by farmers from generation to generation. The method used is descriptive quantitative analysis using survey methods. The survey method was conducted by conducting direct interviews with respondents, namely farmers who cultivate Arabica coffee. Respondents were determined through Stratified Random Sampling. The results showed were generally farmers using mixed varieties in one garden (59.34%), the spacing varied generally 2.5 meters x 2.5 meters (59.34 %), 82.42% used organic and inorganic fertilizers, only 5.49% used organic fertilizers and 12.09% used inorganic fertilizers. Organic fertilizers are sourced from composted coffee husks. Soil and water conservation measures carried out in coffee plantations are only vegetative methods, the type of shade is generally Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) plants. Generally, herbicides were used for weed control (83.52%) and only 12.09% famers used pesticides to control plant pest organisms. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Forage availability is a problem in developing sustainable livestock farming for ruminants in Indonesia. The availability of forage is influenced by several factors, one of which is the availability of land for fodder crop cultivation. The study aimed to test the physicochemistry of Leucaena leucocephala pellets using various types of adhesives originating from local raw materials in the form of tapioca flour, corn flour, sago flour, and commercial adhesives which were carried out for 1 month, namely August 2022 at the Animal Feed Analysis Unit Laboratory, Unit Laboratory Feed Manufacturing, and Transportation Engineering System Laboratory, Halu Oleo University. The results of the study showed that the use of various types of adhesives on the physical and chemical qualities of Leucaena leucocephala forage pellets had a significant effect on the value of pellet durability index, specific gravity, crude protein, dry matter, and organic matter. In contrast, the density value did not show a significant effect. The best results were found using a 3% sago flour adhesive with a Pellet durability index value of 86.71% and a specific gravity of 1.27 g/ml. The adhesive that can improve the chemical quality of Leucaena leucocephala pellets uses 3% corn flour adhesive, which produces a crude protein content of 24.92%. The highest dry material and organic ingredients values are obtained using 3% Tapioca flour adhesive with values of 95.73% and 88.04%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Secondary lignocellulosic biomass has proved to be useful as an energy source through its oxidation by means of combustion processes. In accordance with the above, in this paper, we wanted to study the ash from urban pruning residues that are generated in cities in the Neotropics. Species such as Licania tomentosa, Azadirachta indica, Ficus benjamina, Terminalia catappa, Leucaena leucocephala, Prosopis juliflora and Pithecellobium dulce were selected because they have been previously studied and showed potential for thermal energy generation. These materials were calcined in an oxidizing atmosphere and characterized by X-ray diffraction and fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy with microchemistry, BET surface area, thermal gravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. The pH and apparent density were also established. The results show high basicity materials (average pH 10), a behavior associated with the presence of chemical elements such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, chlorine, phosphorus, and sulfur. Structurally, these materials have a very significant amorphous fraction (between 49% and 74.5%), the dominant crystalline phases are calcite, arcanite, sylvite, and hydroxyapatite. These ashes have low surface area and do not exceed 13 m2/g. Two characteristic morphological aspects were observed in these ashes: a morphology of rounded grains where silicon content is highlighted, and lamellar morphologies where the presence of chlorine is highlighted. Thermally, these ashes show four significant mass loss events (400°C, 430°C, 680°C, and 920°C), causing mass losses that vary between 25% and 40%. Through this study, it was possible to establish that, from a chemical point of view, these ashes are less dangerous in comparison with those of a mineral coal that was used as a reference. However, they require additional treatments for their disposal due to their high basicity. Because of their composition, these ashes have the potential to be used in the ceramic and cement industries, and in the manufacture of fertilizers. © 2023, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lignin provides support to plants by filling the gaps in cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin components but it is an undesired ingredient of pulp as it imparts black to brown colour to the pulp during paper making process. To remove lignin a lot of chemicals and bleaching agents are used which contribute to major fraction of environmental pollution as well as cost determination of paper making process. In India majorly Leucaena leucocephala is employed for obtaining pulp raw material owing to its properties suited for paper production such as vessel percentage, felting power, runkel ratio, tensile strength etc which is better than other commonly employed sources for paper pulp as raw material. In this review paper we focused on recent advances in the use of 4CL enzyme as target gene towards achieving model designer Leucaena leucocephala trees which can be a possible solution to this problem significantly minimizing the environmental pollution and cost of production. It is known from previous studies that better S/G lignin monomer ratio favours easy extractability of lignin from pulp. Different isoforms with different substrate specificities are known in different plants and knowledge of this differential substrate specificity in conjunction with regulation of expression of these isoforms can help in attaining desired S/G lignin monomer ratio. Thus, these model designer plants would be capable of naturally producing easily amenable lignin towards delignification by altering the S/G lignin ratio and can significantly cut the environmental pollution and cost determining factors for paper production. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study was carried out to determine the chemical composition of composite pellets of Megathyrsus maximus containing Leucaena leucocephala seed meal at the varying level and growth responses, as well as haematological and serum biochemical of rabbits, fed the pellets for 60 days. The treatment consists of M. maximus and L. leucocephala—100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30 and 60:40, respectively. Results revealed an increase (P < 0.05) in the proximate composition of the grass pellets with an increase in seed inclusion while there was a reduction (P < 0.05) in the NDF contents of the pellets. An increase in the tannin contents was recorded with an increase in seed inclusion to the grass pellets. Rabbits fed with 30 and 40% inclusions of seed in the grass pellets had similar weight gain while the lowest feed conversion ratio was recorded in rabbits fed grass with 30% seed inclusion. Packed cell volume, RBC and lymphocyte in rabbits were altered with feeding grass seed pellet (P < 0.05), although no particular pattern was followed. Total protein, globulin and urea contents were reduced in the rabbits as the contents of the seeds in the grass pellets increased. Albumin contents in pellets with 30% of seeds were higher in the rabbits fed the pellets above other treatments. It can be concluded that increasing the seed meal level up to 30% in grass pellets supported growth response without inflicting any side effects on the health indices of the rabbits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background. MetS are common throughout the world, including Ethiopia. These have traditionally been treated using medicinal plants, particularly in rural areas where they are freely accessible. This systematic review tried to investigate the treatment of MetS with Ethiopian medicinal herbs and made recommendations for more validation research. A careful analysis of the literature was also conducted on the therapeutic effects of these and other Ethiopian medicinal plants with hepatoprotective and antihypertensive activities. Methods. The relevant keywords "Ethnomedicinal + hypertension,""Ethnopharmacological + hypertension,""Ethnomedicinal + hepatitis, jaundices, and liver disease,""Ethnopharmacological + hepatic disorder,"and "Ethnomedicinal + weight loss"were used to search for relevant articles in the major electronic scientific databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search strategy included all articles with descriptions that were accessible until April 30, 2022. The study's subjects, methods, or year of publication were no restrictions in the search. The outcomes were compiled using descriptive statistics. Results. Fifty-four (54) studies were examined in the review that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the treatment of MetS in Ethiopia. The most often used ethnobotanical plant species for the treatment of hypertension and hepatic disorders were Moringa stenopetala and Croton macrostachyus. Both hepatic and hypertensive disorders were treated more frequently with leaves (52% and 39%, respectively) than with roots (20% and 13%, respectively). Some intriguing studies came from an ethnobotanical investigation into medicinal herbs' hepatoprotective and antihypertensive properties. The most often investigated medicinal plant for its antihypertensive effects is Moringa stenopetala. Conclusion. The study revealed that Ethiopians often use anti-MetS herbal remedies. We advocate the experimental validation of the commonly used medicinal plants with the identification of active compounds and the development of effective alternative drugs for the treatment of MetS.  © 2023 Mekdes Alemu Tola et al.

AB  - In order to support livelihoods, enhance food security, restore ecosystem services, and reduce pressure on forests, degraded land can be restored by utilising alternative land-use systems (ALUS), such as silviculture, silvipasture, and hortipasture techniques. ALUS significantly modify the dynamics of soil nutrients in both the surface and subsurface layers. Soils from the 0–15, 15–30, and 30–45 cm layers of Leucaena leucocephala (S)-, Hardwickia binata (H)-, Emblica officinalis (A)-, and Azadiracta indica (N)-based silviculture systems, Acacia nilotica-based silvipasture systems (SPS), natural grassland (NT), and fallow land (F) were sampled in order to better understand the nutrient dynamics of ALUS. Soils under S, H, and SPS had ~203%, 195%, and 129% higher organic carbon (SOC), respectively, than fallow land in the 0–15 cm soil layer. In the subsequent soil layer, those land-use systems had ~199%, 82%, and 110% higher SOC, respectively, than fallow land. Similarly, in the deeper layer, those land uses had ~232%, 23%, and 105% higher SOC, respectively, than fallow land. SPS and NT also improved the SOC concentration significantly over fallow land. Plots under S, H, and SPS had ~198%, 190%, and 125% higher available N, respectively, than fallow land in 0–15 cm soil layer. In the 15–30 cm soil layer, those land-use systems had ~19%9, 82%, and 110% higher available N, respectively, than fallow land. These systems also improved the P and K contents in subsurface soil. Micronutrient concentrations were also improved in soils under S, H, and SPS. Hence, ALUS’ adoption in degraded areas with trees provides a chance for C storage and improves the nutrient dynamics on degraded land. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Plantation tree species have an immense potential for significantly reducing the atmospheric carbon dioxide and hence regulating climate change. The present study assessed the role of tree species to store carbon and soil enrichment in the eastern plateau and hill region of India. The species investigated were Leucaena leucophala, Gmelina arborea, Cassia siamea, and Eucalyptus tereticornis. The plantation of trees was found to have higher levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) (0.53–0.62%), nitrogen (239.12–253.01 kg ha−1), phosphorus (37.02–38.79 kg ha−1), and potassium (175.47–237.22 kg ha−1) over the non-forested land (control) but was lower in the levels of pH (5.28–5.95) and bulk density (1.32–1.52 g cm−3). However, as soil depth increased, the nutritional status of both plantation and non-forested land soil decreased. The per cent SOC was the highest in surface layers, while the bulk density was the highest in sub-surface layers under different forest plantations. The maximum SOC (0.62%) and bulk density (1.52 g cm−3) were present in Gmelina arborea and Eucalyptus tereticornis plantation, respectively. Among the studied tree species, the soil carbon density and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) were found to be maximum (13.56 t ha−1 and 1.28 t ha−1 year−1) in Gmelina arborea followed by Eucalyptus tereticornis, Cassia siamea, and Leucaena leucocephala, respectively, depicting that these tree species have a stronger capacity to sequester and store carbon, making them suitable as atmospheric carbon reducers. The study also demonstrated that forest plantation enhanced the SOC, nutrient stock, and other crucial soil fertility indicators compared to non-forested site. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The study examined the effect of protein-energy synchronization (PES) index-based rations on the rumen fermentation profile. The material used was the Jawa Randu goat's rumen fluid, collected soon after the goat was slaughtered. The treatment ration consisted of elephant grass, lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala), coconut meal, tofu waste, bran, cassava waste, and mineral mix arranged based on the PES index of each feed ingredient. The research was conducted in vitro using a completely randomized design (CRD). The treatment consisted of 4 PES indexes, namely 0.55 (R1); 0.6 (R2); 0.65 (R3); 0.7 (R4), and each had 5 replications. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and orthogonal polynomials (OP). The results of the ANOVA showed that the PES index did not affect the production of acetate (C2) and butyrate (C4) but had a highly significant effect on dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), pH, a total of volatile fatty acids (VFA), propionate (C3), C2:C3 ratio, methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and microbial protein synthesis (MPS). The analysis of OP showed a quadratic effect on all variables with the equation Y=-81.601X2+375.04X–310.78 (DMD), Y=-433.69X2+522.69X–128.75 (OMD), Y=-44X2+54.04X– .9 (pH), Y=-2160X2+2576.8X–604.2 (VFA Total), Y=-481.8X2+585.01X–143.45 (C3), Y = 50.93X2–60.177X+21.067 (C2:C3), Y = 202.45X2–223.18X+103.41 (CH4), Y= 436X2 – 552.28X+181.08 (NH3), dan Y=-1012X2+1260X–311.64 (MPS). Protein-energy synchronization (PES) index of 0.6 achieved the best rumen fermentability. The formulation of the PES index-based ration of 0.6 had the most effective compared to other indexes based on the high of propionate, the lowest methane, the lowest NH3, and the best microbial protein synthesis. The ration with an index of 0.6 is composed of 30% elephant grass, 30% Leucaena leucocephala, 10% coconut meal, 10% tofu waste, 10% rice brand, 9% cassava waste, and 1% mineral mix. © 2023, Indonesian Center for Animal Research and Development.

AB  - Livestock is one of the most important activities, however, it contributes to global warming, becoming one of the major sources of methane emissions. It should be taken into account that diet manipulation is one of the efficient alternatives that allows modifying ruminal fermentation, improving nutrient assimilation and, therefore, reducing methane. Therefore, in this systematic review, the efficacy of nutritional strategies for the reduction of methane gas emissions in cattle was determined by compiling research journals, undergraduate and doctoral theses published in scientific databases in the last 10 years. The databases consulted were Scopus, Dialnet, Redalyc, Science Direct and thesis repositories in Spanish, English and Portuguese. As a result, it was obtained that the variation of methane emissions is related to the amount of feed ingested and the quality, defined by digestibility and fiber content. It is concluded that sunflower oil, linseed oil, starch oil and Leucaena leucocephala present an efficiency of 21.5%, 38%, 12.8% and 61% respectively in reducing enteric CH4 emission. © 2023 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

AB  - In the arboretum of Universidad Nacional de Colombia sede Medellín, Cassia fistula (Golden Shower Tree) and Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) exhibited early defoliation. Erysiphe quercicola and Telimena canafistulae, associated with powdery mildew and tar spot, respectively, on C. fistula, were identified using morphological and molecular techniques, both representing new records of fungi for Colombia. Similarly, Phyllactinia leucaenae was proposed as a new combination for Ovulariopsis leucaenae and was associated with powdery mildew on L. leucocephala, which to the best of our knowledge is another new record for Colombia. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Conventional pretreatment methods such as alkaline and acid pretreatment which were used in biorefineries to dissolve lignin and hemicellulose faces many drawbacks. These pretreatment methods were considered as toxic not only to the environment, but also to the biomass as further treatment using these solvents will lead to the production of hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural, which can inhibit the production of ethanol. Recently, deep eutectic solvents (DES) have grown in popularity as an alternative solvent to substitute conventional pretreatment solvents. DES have a great number of advantages such as biodegradability, non-toxic, low volatility and low cost. Furthermore, DES also is a powerful solvent to dissolve lignin, thus this makes DES a superior solvent to be used in biorefineries compared to alkaline and acid pretreatment. In this study, Leucaena leucocephala seeds and pods were treated with choline chloride – glycerol (ChCl – Gly) based DES at 1:2 molar ratio, and the performance subjected to sugar released and ethanol production were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The values were then compared with the conventional pretreatment methods as the controls. The results suggested that DES pretreatment released slightly higher total sugar, 29.28 g/L compared to alkaline and acidic pretreatment at 28.77 and 24.94 g/L, respectively. On the other hand, the yield of ethanol after fermentation in DES treatment were among the highest, which was 0.287 g ethanol/g glucose with 56.27% conversion compared to theoretical yield. The purpose of this report is to offer further information in the interest of making DES as a good replacement for the conventional pretreatment method. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an investigation to determine the potential of Leucaena leucocephala as a commercial energy crop for dendro-power generation plants. Dendro-power generation is the generation of electricity from wood fuels. Modern technology enables the efficient, clean and long-term use of wood in dendro power plants. Various tests and calculations have been carried out, such as moisture content, physical analysis and calorific value of tree species. The Leucaena leucocephala yield per unit area of the special plantation for the development of 10 MW dendro power plants was estimated. The development of a 10 MW dendro power plant provides for an annual electricity generation of 50 GWh, which can be used for self-consumption or sold to a power company. This study provides a quantitative approach to estimating the wood requirements for Dendro power generation which has not been done before. From the calculation, the annual fuel consumption of the Dendro power plant requires 48,880 tons/year. Therefore, the total area required for planting the energy plant Leucaena leucocephala is 815 hectares. The number of Leucaena leucocephala trees required to meet the annual fuel consumption of the Dendro power plant is 4,075,000 trees. The implementation of this project will also help the economic development of local communities, especially in rural areas.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Invasive alien plants are considered as one of the major causes of loss of native biodiversity around the world. Remote sensing provides an opportunity to identify and map native and invasive species using accurate spectral information. The current study was aimed to evaluate PlanetScope (3 m) and Sentinel (10 m) datasets for mapping the distribution of native and invasive species in two protected areas in Pakistan, using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The multispectral data were analysed with the following four ML algorithms (classifiers)—random forest (RF), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM)—to classify two invasive species, Lantana camara L. (common lantana) and Leucaena leucocephala L. The (Ipil-ipil) Dzetsaka plugin of QGIS was used to map these species using all ML algorithms. RF, GMM, and SVM algorithms were more accurate at detecting both invasive species when using PlanetScope imagery rather than Sentinel. Random forest produced the highest accuracy of 64% using PlanetScope data. Lantana camara was the most dominating plant species with 23% cover, represented in all thematic maps. Leucaena leucocpehala was represented by 7% cover and was mainly distributed in the southern end of the Jindi Reserve Forest (Jhelum). It was not possible to discriminate native species Dodonea viscosa Jacq. (Snatha) using the SVM classifier for Sentinel data. Overall, the accuracy of PlanetScope was slightly better than Sentinel in term of species discrimination. These spectral findings provide a reliable estimation of the current distribution status of invasive species and would be helpful for land managers to prioritize invaded areas for their effective management. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Catalysts are used to improve the properties of the bio-oil produced through biomass pyrolysis. In this study, natural minerals, such as natural zeolite and dolomite, were used for the catalytic upgrading of the pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala. Pyrolysis was performed using an in-house designed fluidized bed system wherein the catalyst beds can be placed in two locations. Dolomite and zeolite catalyst beds were placed in the primary fluidized bed and/or secondary hot filter reactors. Four catalyst configurations were utilized in this study. The effects of the type and location of the catalyst on the catalytic activity and product selectivity were investigated. The highest light bio-oil fraction was obtained using the dolomite catalyst situated at the primary and secondary reactors. On the other hand, the configuration in which the natural zeolite catalyst was placed in the two reactors produced heavy bio-oil that was mainly composed of hydrocarbons. The viscosity, flash point, and fly point of the bio-oil produced in this work fall within the standard values for fuel oils. In particular, the viscosity of the bio-oil produced using the catalysts was lower by 60% of that of the product obtained through noncatalytic biomass pyrolysis. The pyrolysis system employed in this study is a promising technology for catalytic biomass pyrolysis processes. © 2022 Energy Institute

AB  - Background and Aim: Swamp buffaloes play an important role in the rural economy of Indonesia. They consume various forages during their grazing time, including those with anti-parasitic potential. However, the information about the type and quality of forages and their potential as a natural anthelmintic for swamp buffalo is very limited. This study aimed to identify the diversity, quality, and anthelmintic potency of forages consumed by swamp buffaloes reared in Bantarkawung Subdistrict, Brebes District, Central Java Province, Indonesia. Materials and Methods: Samples of forages were obtained during three observation periods of the study, with a 12-week interval between each period. Forage diversity was evaluated by identifying its consumption by swamp buffaloes during their grazing activity in the field and feeding time in their shed. The quality of forages was analyzed using proximate analysis to measure their dry matter (DM), crude fiber (CF), crude protein (CP), crude fat (CFat), and ash contents. This is followed by the calculation of their total digestible nutrient based on the proximate analysis results. Botanical composition analysis was then conducted to measure the predominance of forages consumed by the livestock during their grazing activity. Literature reviews were carried out to explore forage's anthelmintic activity. Results: The results showed that swamp buffaloes consume nine species of forage in the shed and 47 in the grazing area, including nine legumes, 18 grass, and 20 others. Swamp buffaloes consumed forages of lower quality, which contained high CF contents and varying levels of other nutrients below their daily nutritional needs. The grazing activity allowed swamp buffaloes to consume a higher variety of forages with better nutritional quality, thereby enabling them to meet their nutritional needs. Legumes and other forages served as the major protein sources, providing CP of 20.03% DM and 11.53% DM, and CF levels of 17.01% DM and 20.35% DM, respectively. The results also showed that the consumption of these forages increased during the rainy season. The predominant species of legumes consumed were Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia spp., while Alternanthera sessilis and Merremia umbellata were the predominant species of other forages. A total of 13 of the 47 species could potentially be used as natural anthelmintic due to their secondary metabolites, namely, tannin, flavonoid, saponin, terpenoid, diterpenoid, and mimosine. These compounds exert anthelmintic effects by inhibiting egg-hatching and larval development, as well as damaging the surface structure of both larvae and adult worms, ultimately leading to the death of the parasites. Conclusion: Overall, swamp buffaloes consumed more variety of forages during grazing compared to when they were kept in sheds. While the low-variety and low-quality forages provisioned for swamp buffaloes in their shed resulted in a low nutrient intake below their daily requirement. Furthermore, daily grazing activities allowed swamp buffaloes to fulfill and supplement their need by consuming a variety of grasses, legumes, and other forages in their respective grazing areas. Some of these forages also have the potential to become natural anthelmintic because they contain secondary metabolites, such as tannins, flavonoids, saponins, terpenoids, diterpenoids, and mimosine. © 2023 Veterinary World.

AB  - This paper describes the outcomes of a five-year (2011-2016) partnership project between the Indonesian Government and the Australian Centre for international Agricultural Research. The objective was to promote the use of Leucaena leucocephala for fattening cattle in the Provinces of West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) and East Nusa Tenggara (NTT). Detailed biophysical and socio-economic measurements demonstrated that it was possible to double productivity of smallholder cattle by improving their nutrition based on feeding leucaena, thus improving the livelihoods of farming families. The results highlighted an opportunity to similarly enhance productivity of other smallholder cattle enterprises in Indonesia and in other tropical developing countries.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Aims: This study focused on new fish feed additives that could supply a nutritional value and inhibit or eliminate mycotoxins. Four novel feed additives, including Albizia lebbeck (L.), Leucaena leucocephala leaf extracts, Serendipita indica and Bacillus megaterium were applied to contaminated fish feed; besides investigating the toxicity of these new fish feed additives.Methodology and results: Our data exhibited that the different tested feed additives were not toxic for brine shrimp larvae or fish. Albizia lebbeck extract at a concentration 0.5% was highly effective in detoxifying mycotoxins with efficacy ratios of 88.01%, 93.89% and 92.89% for aflaB1, aflaG1 and CPA, respectively and L. leucocephala at 0.5% had efficacy ratios of 93.52% and 100% for aflaG1 and CPA, respectively. The addition of S. indica with a concentration of 0.75% was highly effective for the usage of good feed approximately free of mycotoxins, with efficacy ratios of 85.65%, 90.81% and 100% for aflaB1, aflaG1 and CPA, respectively. Moreover, B. megaterium, with a concentration of 0.75% was recommended for detoxification.Conclusion, significance and impact of study: Studied new feed additives as feed additives in fish diets to eliminate mycotoxin with the potential of providing antioxidant activity. Results suggest that mycotoxins degradation can happen in vitro and in vivo by applying new fish feed additives in the fish diet. © (2023), (Universiti Sains Malaysia). All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Hedgerow or alley cropping is being advocated for sustainable land productivity and improved soil health in the developing world. The suitable food-fodder species grown on bed and furrow system with soil moisture conservation practices need to be adopted for the success of alley cropping under rainfed semi-arid region. A field experiment was conducted during 2013–2016 to assess different food-fodder based alley cropping systems with resource conservation practices (RCP) for enhancing productivity, economic returns and energetics. The perennial Pennisetum tri-specific hybrid (TSH) grass and legume shrubs were planted on a raised bed of 1.5 m wide. One row of shrub was planted in the middle of the bed along with two rows of TSH grass on both side of the shrub row. The seasonal crops were grown in furrow (2.2 m) placed between two beds (1.5 m). In RCP, one supplement irrigation treatments to crops were given i.e. one pre-sowing irrigation (rabi) + other irrigation as per theoretical calculation i.e. 30% of total rainfall—ET losses. In-situ moisture conservation practices include residue retention (stubble height 15 cm + mulching (green weed biomass + litterfall) in furrows. The result indicates that among woody perennials, Sesbania sesban as a hedgerow was superior to Desmanthus virgatus but found at par with Leucaena leucocephala in terms of DM production. Furthermore, TSH grass grown on the side of woody legumes produced about 15–20 Mg DM ha−1 across the treatment per year. The grain yield of the annual crops was in the order of barley > chickpea > pigeonpea across the years and not significantly influenced by perennial components. The highest system productivity (112.2 Mg ha−1) was found under TSH + S. sesban + (sorghum + cowpea–barley) cropping systems leading to higher net monetary returns (US$ 1430 ha−1). While alley cropping with sorghum + pigeonpea was the lowest yielder. Among resource conservation practices, one supplement irrigation and in-situ soil moisture conservation treatments were comparable and produced about 12–14% higher yield than control. The TSH + S. sesban + (sorghum + cowpea–barley) cropping system accumulated highest bio-energy (497 GJ ha−1) but maximum value of energy use efficiency was computed in TSH + Sesbania + (sorghum + pigeonpea). The soil organic carbon was enhanced substantially under 4 years of hedgerow systems over antecedent level. Findings of this study suggest that TSH + S. sesban hedgerow system grown in bed with seasonal crops (sorghum + cowpea–chickpea) in furrow could improve food and fodder production, ensure green fodder availability during dry season and sustain natural resources in rainfed semi-arid agro-ecologies. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The material associated with tree pruning in a city in the Colombian neotropics was characterized in order to determine its energy potential. The species studied for their relevance in the territory were Prosopis juliflora, Lica-nia tomentosa, Terminalia catappa, Azadirachta indica, Pithecellobium dulce, Ficus benjamina and Leucaena leu-cocephala. Moisture content, bulk density, hygroscopic response, elemental chemical analysis, proximal analysis, calorific value, ease of ignition and combustion, thermogravimetric and heat flow analysis, steam generation capa-city, and qualitative analysis of gases (mass spectrometry) were determined. The results that were obtained show high initial moisture contents that vary between 37% and 67% and a variable density (when dry) between 0.21 and 0.41 g/cm3. Chemically, it was shown that all residues have lower carbon and sulfur content compared to a refer-ence mineral coal. However, the residues of some species have higher nitrogen contents compared to the same coal. All biomasses are characterized by their high content of volatile fractions and by having a lower content of inorganic matter compared to carbon. The lower calorific values of these residues are between 14170 and 16928 kJ/kg, which are not negligible compared to other biomasses. This characteristic would be related to the high presence of hemicellulose in the residues. Flue gas monitoring revealed that there are different airflow needs in order to ensure complete combustion. Steam generation tests showed that the calorific value should not be the most relevant criterion to establish the potential use of the waste, since leucaena leucocephala, despite having the highest calorific value, was the material with the lowest performance in steam generation. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

AB  - Background: Seeking cures for chronic inflammation-associated diseases and infectious diseases caused by critical human pathogens is challenging and time-consuming. Even as the research community searches for novel bioactive agents, consuming a healthy diet with functional ability might be an effective way to delay and prevent the progression of severe health conditions. Many plant ingredients in Thai food are considered medicinal, and these vegetables, herbs, and spices collectively possess multiple biological and pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antipyretic, anticancer, hepatoprotective, and cardioprotective effects. Methodology: In this review, the selected edible plants are unspecific to Thai food, but our unique blend of recipes and preparation techniques make traditional Thai food healthy and functional. We searched three electronic databases: PUBMED, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, using the specific keywords “Plant name” followed by “Anti-inflammatory” or “Antibacterial” or “Antiviral” and focusing on articles published between 2017 and 2021. Results: Our selection of 69 edible and medicinal plant species (33 families) is the most comprehensive compilation of Thai food sources demonstrating biological activities to date. Focusing on articles published between 2017 and 2021, we identified a total of 245 scientific articles that have reported main compounds, traditional uses, and pharmacological and biological activities from plant parts of the selected species. Conclusions: Evidence indicates that the selected plants contain bioactive compounds responsible for anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties, suggesting these plants as potential sources for bioactive agents and suitable for consumption for health benefits.

AB  - Context: Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a leguminous shrub used for beef grazing in low-rainfall regions (<600-700 mm). Newer cultivars have the potential to extend adoption of the species to higher rainfall (>600-700 mm), frost-free areas of Australia. Aim: We compared productivity, nutritional value and animal performance of two leucaena cultivars, new psyllid-resistant Redlands and the 2010-released Wondergraze, under continuous grazing management in a higher rainfall environment. Methods: Growing steers were allocated to replicated established stands of Wondergraze or Redlands with inter-row mixed grass-legume pasture from January to July 2021. Pasture and leucaena were characterised for biomass and nutritive characteristics. Botanical composition was measured. Liveweight gain, rumen fermentation, and leucaena mimosine breakdown products were measured in grazing steers. Key results: At the beginning of the study, leucaena edible biomass was similar for both cultivars (P > 0.05), but at subsequent samplings, biomass of Redlands was lower than of Wondergraze (P < 0.01). Biomass of both cultivars declined rapidly over the grazing period. Pasture biomass increased between February and July and was significantly higher in Wondergraze paddocks (P < 0.05). Animal performance was not significantly different between cultivar treatments, averaging 0.8 kg/day, but declined over time. Patterns of mimosine conversion to DHP isomers and their conjugation were similar for the two cultivars, suggesting that effectiveness of detoxification did not differ between them. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that leucaena can sustain high levels of animal performance when included in tropical grass pastures in a higher rainfall environment if present in a sufficient quantity (>2 t leucaena edible dry matter/ha established leucaena). Implications: Grazing leucaena-grass pastures is an effective means of increasing animal productivity in parts of subtropical Australia. However, managing grass and/or leucaena growth to match animal requirements can be challenging. © 2023 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - The present world faces critical issues such as global warming, sea-level rise, and drastic change in the climate pattern due to the emission of greenhouse gases. Large-scale use and disposal of hazardous plastics contribute significantly to the present scenario and it becomes essential to use naturally derived materials for making plastics. Natural fibers were found to possess the inherent characteristics required for reinforcing the polymer. In this work, one such novel cellulosic fiber derived from the bast of Leucaena leucocephala was identified and characterized using tests such as chemical, tensile, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric, Differential scanning calorimetry, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Field emission scanning electron microscopy. The presence of high cellulose (59.03 wt.%) with high crystallinity index (63.10%) contributes to high tensile strength(415–693 MPa) and high tensile modulus (9.90–13.10 GPa) of the Leucaena leucocephala fiber (LLF). From thermogravimetric analysis, LLF was observed to be thermally stable up to 188.20°C and activation energy of 64.22 kJ/mol. The morphological analysis of LLF revealed the existence of honeycombed porous surface characterized with serrations, and this facilitates better bonding characteristics with polymer. Lower density, mechanical properties, and better thermal stability make LLF a suitable alternate for synthetic fibers while making composites. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Simulation models represent a low-cost approach to evaluating agricultural systems. In the current study, the precision and accuracy of the RUMINANT model to predict dry matter intake (DMI) and methane emissions from beef cattle fed tropical diets (characteristic of Colombia) was assessed. Feed intake (DMI) and methane emissions were measured in Brahman steers housed in polytunnels and fed six forage diets. In addition, DMI and methane emissions were predicted by the RUMINANT model. The model’s predictive capability was measured on the basis of precision: coefficients of variation (CV%) and determination (R2, percentage of variance accounted for by the model), and model efficiency (ME) and accuracy: the simulated/observed ratio (S/O ratio) and slope and mean bias (MB%). In addition, combined measurements of accuracy and precision were carried out by means of mean square prediction error (MSPE) and correlation correspondence coefficient (CCC) and their components. The predictive capability of the RUMINANT model to simulate DMI resulted as valuable for mean S/O ratio (1.07), MB% (2.23%), CV% (17%), R2 (0.886), ME (0.809), CCC (0.869). However, for methane emission simulations, the model substantially underestimated methane emissions (mean S/O ratio = 0.697, MB% = −30.5%), and ME and CCC were −0.431 and 0.485, respectively. In addition, a subset of data corresponding to diets with Leucaena was not observed to have a linear relationship between the observed and simulated values. It is suggested that this may be related to anti-methanogenic factors characteristic of Leucaena, which were not accounted for by the model. This study contributes to improving national inventories of greenhouse gases from the livestock of tropical countries. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala stem bark that was eleven years old was studied for its chemical composition and usage. The samples were subjected to chemical analyses based on ASTM standard procedures after being air-dried for several days. The results found that the bark of L. leucocephala has a pH value of 6.04 and that the solubility of the bark in 1% NaOH alkali is the highest compared to the solubility in hot water (14.45%) and cold water (14.36%), while the chemical composition of the bark of L. leucocephala was ash (15.76%); extractives (8.39%); holocellulose (132.85%); hemicellulose (103.66%); cellulose (29.19%) and lignin (38.24%). Based on the findings, L. leucocephala bark was less acidic. When used as a source of carbohydrates, bark has a high solubility, and its chemical composition may have an impact on how quickly it burns when it is pyrolysed. © 2023 Statny Drevarsky Vyskumny Ustav.

AB  - Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a highly polyphagous insect pest, which inflicts serious economic damage on many agricultural and horticultural crops globally. During our recent surveillance surveys, an unusual defoliation was noticed by a caterpillar pest on cocoa saplings at ICAR - Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Regional Station, Vittal farm, Karnataka, India. Morphological identification and molecular characterization using mitochondrial cytochrome-c-oxidase (COI) gene confirmed the collected insect samples as S. litura. Hitherto, this species was only known to infest Leucaena leucocephala (CABI), a shade tree of cocoa plantations in Indonesia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of infestation by tobacco cut worm on cocoa in India. Consequently, solarization of rooting medium has been suggested for the destruction of the quiescent pupal stage. © 2023 Lepidopterists' Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several tree legume species’ (Caesalpinia pulcherrima, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Leucaena leucocephala, Pithecellobium dulce, Samanea saman, Sesbania grandiflora and Tamarindus indica) mature seeds were investigated for their lipophilic fraction profile. The oil yield ranged 2.1–14.9%. Linoleic acid was generally dominant (31.86–62.28%), followed by oleic (14.95–33.84%) and palmitic (7.21–17.54%) acid. Total tocochromanol content ranged 41.7–326.0 mg 100 g−1 oil. Tocopherols (Ts), especially α-T (23.0–197.8 mg 100 g−1 oil) and γ-T (7.3–264.0 mg 100 g−1 oil), dominated, and the seeds either did not contain tocotrienols or the content was negligible. Total carotenoid content ranged 2.1–11.8 mg 100 g−1 oil. Only C. pulcherrima and P. dulce contained squalene. The total sterol content ranged 94–1810 mg 100 g−1 oil, and the seeds contained mostly β-sitosterol, Δ5-stigmasterol, campesterol and cycloartenol. Although the oil yield is too low for commercial oil production, some of the studied species (C. pulcherrima, L. leucocephala and T. indica) could be considered as bioactive compound-rich oil sources. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a fermented substrate containing various proportions of fodder tree leaf mix meal at 0% (LM0), 10% (LM1), 20% (LM2), 30% (LM3) and 40% (LM4) on the body dimensions and nutrient content of black soldier fly (BSF) larvae (maggots). The fodder tree were Leucaena leucocephala and Moringa oleifera in a fixed ratio of 1:1. Completely randomized design was deployed to test those five levels of the legume mix meal. Each experimental unit consisted of 2 kgs of substrate, which was placed randomly in an open-air hut for oviposition by wild BSF. Maggots were harvested 10th days after substrate placement. Variables measured were maggot’s fresh and dry weight, length, crude protein, and lipid content. Analysis of variance was used in analysis of the data. Results showed that levels of fodder tree leaf meal improved maggots protein and lipid content at a quadratic fashion. However, larval weight (0.13-0.18 g), length (15.7-18.2 mm), and DM content (41.0-45.7%) were not effected. It can be concluded that the levels of leucaena-moringa leaf meal in the growth substrate can increase the protein and lipid content of black soldier fly maggots but not the larva’s weight and length. © 2023 Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - The paper reports Boron (B) uptake using Leucaena leucocephala seed pods (LLSP) as a pre-treatment for reverse osmosis seawater desalination. The process increases the quality of the membrane-entering nutrient water. The research investigated a new, low-cost biosorption technique for boron from Gaza shore on the Mediterranean Sea at a distance of 300 m from shore and 1 m deep. The maximum adsorption efficiency reached 85.7% at pH 12, 30 min contact time, and adsorbent dosage of 2 g/100 ml seawater. The initial and final concentration of boron was measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP). The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were applied to the adsorption data. The kinetic data for removal processes were fitted with the pseudo-second-order model. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The air pollution tolerance index (APTI) is one of the modern tools for assessing the impacts of air pollutants on plant physiology. The value of APTI is different for different plant species. Plants with higher values of APTI are tolerant and act as a sink due to their bioaccumulation ability for air pollutants. Hence, they can be planted to establish green belts in areas with severe air pollution, especially in industrial zones. The present investigation was carried out to assess the APTI values of top twenty urban tree species of the Bikaner city of North-Western Rajasthan. The leaf samples were taken from selected roadside trees distributed in the residential, commercial and industrial zones of the city. On the basis of APTI values, it was observed that Leucaena leucocephala (23.41), Eucalyptus camaldulensis (21.87) and Cassia siamea (21.39) had an APTI value above 20 and they are therefore classified as tolerant species. Similarly, Pongamia pinnata (9.48) showed APTI under 10, therefore it falls into the sensitive category. 80 % of the total species in the studied area are categorized as a moderately sensitive category. There were no plant species in very sensitive (APTI < 1) and very tolerant (APTI > 30) category. © 2023, Association for Promotion of Holistic Approach to Environment. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fodder tree leaves (FTLs) contain high levels of protein, vitamins, and minerals that play a major role in enhancing roughage intake by ruminants, thus improving low-quality roughage utilization. The study sought to measure the rumen degradation characteristics, pH, and ammonia N concentration of sheep fed rice straw (RS) and supplemented with FTLs. Four forest-type rumen-fistulated rams of an average weight of 19.0±1.2 kg were randomly assigned to one of four treatments in a 4 × 4 Latin Square design. Treatment diets consisted of urea-ammoniated straw (UAS; control), RS+100% Leucaena leucocephala (L), RS+100% Samanea saman (S), and RS+50% L+50% S (LS). Data obtained were subjected to the Glimmix procedure of SAS (2016) and significant means were separated using Tukey’s test at (P<0.05). Treatments differed significantly (P<0.001) in the quantity of readily soluble materials (a), rate of degradation (c), and a potentially degradable fraction (P) with LS recording the highest a, c, and P among the treatments. Ruminal pH and ammonia concentrations differed significantly (P<0.0001) among the treatments. Overall mean rumen pH values obtained ranged from 6.44 in UAS to 6.72 in the S-supplemented diet whereas mean rumen ammonia values ranged from 4.59 mg/100 ml in sheep fed UAS diet to 9.15 mg/L in sheep fed L diet. The pH values obtained imply that the experimental diets could improve rumen fermentation and, hence, serve as good sources of feed for ruminants. The rumen DM degradation values indicated that sufficient amounts of DM would be degraded over a period of time, thus releasing substantial quantities into the small intestines for digestion to provide essential nutrients needed for better animal performance. The rumen ammonia values obtained were higher than the minimum values recommended for optimal microbial activity for animals fed lignocellulosic materials. This indicated that such FTLs could be utilized for moderate animal performance, especially during the dry seasons when natural pastures are qualitatively and quantitatively poor. © (2023), (Scienceline Publication).

AB  - This article describes the synthesis of polyesteramide (PEA) resin from Leucaena leucocephala oil (LLO) obtained from seeds of L. leucocephala tree, locally grown in King Saud University Campus. LLO was transformed into amide diol by based catalyzed amidation reaction, followed by esterification reaction with malic acid (MA), that resulted in LLO-based PEA (LPEA). The synthesis was performed without using any solvent or catalyst. Fourier-transformation infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the formation of LPEA by the introduction of amide and ester moieties. LPEA was further reinforced with nano graphene oxide (GO) and fabricated into nanocomposite corrosion protective coatings (LPEA/GO). LPEA/GO coatings obtained were tough, flexibility retentive and showed good corrosion resistance performance toward 3.5 w/w% NaCl medium. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed good thermal stability of coatings with safe usage up to 200°C. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

AB  - The effect of green organic mulches (Sesbania aculeata and Leucaena leucocephala) and nitrogen (N) levels on growth, yield, quality and nutrient uptake of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar “Pusa Basmati 1509” was investigated in aerobic rice (AR) and transplanted rice (TPR). The levels of N were control (N0), 75% recommended dose of N (RDN); and 100% RDN) applied through Chemical fertilizer and Azotobacter chroococcum a liquid biofertilizer. A Field experiment was conducted in split plot design with four main-plot and 5 sub-plot treatments. The main plot consisted of bare soil, Sesbania mulch (10 Mg ha−1, fresh weight-FW), Leucaena mulch (10 Mg ha−1 FW), and TPR; and sub-plot consisted N0; 75% RDN, 100% RDN; 75% RDN+Azotobacter, and 100% RDN+Azotobacter. The highest grain, straw and biological yields (3.84, 6.74 and 11.6 Mg ha−1, respectively) and nutrient uptake were recorded with TPR followed by AR with Leucaena and Sesbania mulch. Grain, straw and biological yield of TPR over bare soil were increased by 31.9, 26.6 and 28.3%, respectively. Uptake of Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu by rice under TPR were 52, 33, 36 and 33% higher, respectively than AR under bare soil. The highest grain, straw, and biological yields (3.86, 7.79 and 11.7 Mg ha−1, respectively) of AR were obtained in 100% RDN + Azotobacter compared to the rest of the treatments. Therefore, the cultivation of AR with Leucaena/Sesbania mulch along with 100% RDN and Azotobacter biofertilizer can be most productive in the study area. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The Leucaena leucocephala trypsin inhibitor (LTI) + Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protoxins mix has been proposed as a novel larvicide agent in order to control the vector mosquito of dengue virus, Aedes aegypti, in their aquatic breeding sites. However, use of this insecticide formulation has raised concerns about its impacts on aquatic biota. In this context, this work aimed to assess the effects of LTI and Bt protoxins, separately or in combination, in zebrafish, in regard to the evaluation of toxicity at early life stages and to the presence of LTI inhibitory effects on intestinal proteases of this fish. Results showed that LTI and Bt concentrations (250 mg/L, and 0.13 mg/L, respectively), and LTI + Bt mix (250 mg/L + 0.13 mg/L) - 10 times superior to those with insecticidal action – did not cause death nor did it induce morphological changes during embryonic and larval development (3 to 144 h post-fertilization) of zebrafish. Molecular docking analyses highlighted a possible interaction between LTI and zebrafish trypsin, especially through hydrophobic interactions. In concentrations near to those with larvicidal action, LTI (0.1 mg/mL) was able to inhibit in vitro intestinal extracts of trypsin in female and male fish by 83 % and 85 %, respectively, while LTI + Bt mix promoted trypsin inhibition of 69 % in female and 65 % in male ones. These data show that the larvicidal mix can potentially promote deleterious effects to nutrition and survival in non-target aquatic organisms, especially those with trypsin-like dependent protein digestion. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The unintended impact of natural summer fire on soil is complicated and rather less studied than its above-ground impact. Recognising the impact of a fire on silvopastoral soils and their resilience can aid in improving the management of silvopastoral systems. We studied the immediate (after 1 week (W)) and short-term (after 3 months (M)) recovery of different soil biological and chemical properties after the natural fire, with specific emphasis on phosphorus (P) dynamics. Soil samples were collected from four different layers (0–15, 15–30, 30–45, and 45–60 cm) of Morus alba, Leucaena leucocephala, and Ficus infectoria based silvopastoral systems. In the 0–15 cm soil layer, soil organic carbon (SOC) declined by ∼37, 42, and 30% after the fire in Morus-, Leucaena-, and Ficus-based systems, respectively within 1W of fire. However, after 3M of fire, Morus and Leucaena regained ∼6 and 11.5% SOC as compared to their status after 1W in the 0–15 cm soil layer. After 1W of the fire, soil nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and potassium availability declined significantly at 0–15 cm soil layer in all systems. Iron and manganese availability improved significantly after 1W of the fire. Saloid bound P and aluminium bound P declined significantly immediately after the fire, increasing availability in all systems. However, calcium bound P did not change significantly after the fire. Dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activity declined significantly after the fire, however, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activity were unaltered. Resiliencies of these soil properties were significantly impacted by soil depth and time. Path analysis indicated microbial activity and cationic micronutrients majorly governed the resilience of soil P fractions and P availability. Pasture yield was not significantly improved after the fire, so natural summer fire must be prevented to avoid loss of SOC, N, and S. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A baseline survey was carried out to determine the iodine status of goats and its relationship with the levels of soil, water, and fodder samples collected from different agro-climatic zones (sub-tropical, lower, and upper-intermediate) of the Jammu division. A total of 74 blood and 60 milk samples from goats, as well as soil (50), water (50), and fodder (56) samples, were collected. Plasma inorganic iodine (PII), milk inorganic iodine (MII), iodide ion (I-), and thyroid hormone (T3and T4) levels were measured along with biochemical parameters. The average PII, I-, and MII concentrations of goats from unorganized farms were 55.99±4.56 ng/ml, 1.37±0.11 ppm, and 47.3±5.68 ng/ml compared 74.68±8.40 ng/ml, 1.43±0.11 ppm and 62.01±8.55 ng/ml, respectively from the organized farm. Based on PII level, 71.62% of goats had moderate deficiency (level 50-100 ng/ml) and 28.37% had severe deficiency (level <50 ng/ml). The average levels of iodine in soil and water were 0.24 ppm and 0.06 ppm, respectively. Rabi and kharif fodders showed average iodine levels of 1.25 ppm and 0.37 ppm, respectively. Significant changes were recorded in glucose, HDL and T4levels. Pearson correlation performed between PII (ng/ml) and biochemical parameters established correlation with T4(r = -0.465), glucose (r = 0.510), HDL (r = -0.355) and cholesterol (r = 0.271). The study concluded that iodine deficiency is prevalent in the goat population due to lower levels in the environment implying an urgent need for regular supplementation in the diet. © 2023 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

AB  - RNA viruses have been the most destructive due to their transmissibility and lack of control measures. Developments of vaccines for RNA viruses are very tough or almost impossible as viruses are highly mutable. For the last few decades, most of the epidemic and pandemic viral diseases have wreaked huge devastation with innumerable fatalities. To combat this threat to mankind, plant-derived novel antiviral products may contribute as reliable alternatives. They are assumed to be nontoxic, less hazardous, and safe compounds that have been in uses in the beginning of human civilization. In this growing COVID-19 pandemic, the present review amalgamates and depicts the role of various plant products in curing viral diseases in humans.  © 2023 Anamika Paul et al.
