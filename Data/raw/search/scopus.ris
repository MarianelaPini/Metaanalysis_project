AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (hereafter L. leucocephala) is considered one of the 100 most invasive plant species in the world and has been found in areas subject to wildfire events and flooding. Its rapid L. leucocephala invasion capacity can lead to decrease in local diversity due to the exclusion of native plant species. In this way, the L. leucocephala proliferation has advanced across the Pantanal. Here, we assess the effects of the fire, flooding and distance to the source population on the invasion of L. leucocephala, and whether this dynamic negatively affects the richness of native plant species in the Brazilian Pantanal. Our results showed that fire recurrence and flood level were the opposite under L. leucocephala invasion. Areas with low flood level and greater fire occurrence tend to have more L. leucocephala regenerants while the distance of the source population had no effect. L. leucocephala and native plants occupy sites with different abiotic conditions. In an expected scenario for the Pantanal islonger droughts and more frequent wildfire, this could mean a pronounced increase in L. leucocephala invasion over time. Therefore, the use of fire as a management action for L. leucocephala control is not recommended, and it is necessary to find methods to extract or eliminate the seed banks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists 2024.

TI  - Reduction behaviour of iron ore pellets using hardwood biomasses as a reductant for sustainable ironmaking
PY  - 2024

AB  - Renewable biomass is a potent, CO2 neutral substitute to fossil coal and coke in iron making. However, there has been relatively little work on the utilization of biomass for the production of directly reduced iron (DRI). The aim of the present work is to characterize Acacia nilotica (W1), Albizia lebbeck (W2), and Leucaena leucocephala (W3) biomass and to reduce iron ore pellets primarily with the volatile matter from the wood at high temperature, yielding charcoal simultaneously as a co-product. The chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the three biomass species were investigated. Effect of different biomasses and reduction parameters like C/O ratio, reduction temperature, and time on %Reduction (%R) was studied. DRI was characterized using %Metallization (%M), XRD, and SEM. Up to 89% reduction was achieved in the simultaneous carbonization of biomass and the reduction of iron ore pellets at a temperature of 1000 °C. The pellets cooled in the furnace after reduction resulted in lower %R (e.g., W1:57%, W2:54%, and W3:63%) than the respective air-cooled pellets (e.g., W1:88%, W2:83%, and W3:86%). Oxidation was the cause for lower %R in furnace cooled (slow cooling) reduction experiments than in the air cooled. Co-produced wood charcoal after the reduction of iron ore contained approximately 76–81% carbon which competes well with a typical value for coal of 70%. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.

TI  - Understanding competition between two invasive woody plants of India under an altered rainfall regime
PY  - 2025
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207023496&doi=10.1007%2fs11258-024-01470-1&partnerID=40&md5=ddf6e6b03877563886f8107806bd25d6
AB  - Prosopis juliflora and Leucaena leucocephala are notable examples of invasive woody plants that can spread throughout similar habitats in India. However, little is known about how these two species may interact with one another if future rainfall pattern shifts, which is particularly concerning. Recognizing the pivotal role of eco-physiological parameters in deciphering the dynamics of interspecific competition, a study was devised to elucidate the interplay between L. leucocephala and P. juliflora under simulated rainfall conditions. At Botanical Garden, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, UP, India, three fixed rainout shelter plots were established, each receiving distinct precipitation levels: low rainfall (LR), normal rainfall (NR), and high rainfall (HR). Within each plot, three replicate subplots were dedicated to pure stands of L. leucocephala (L), pure stands of P. juliflora (P), and mixed stands of the two species (LP). The findings of the study underscore significant variations in soil Inorganic N, N-mineralization, based on precipitation levels, with maximum values observed in HR plot and L. Similarly, biomass, photosynthetic rate, and transpiration rate exhibited significant variability in response to precipitation treatment, reaching their highest values in HR plot and L. Conversely, root length, root-shoot ratio, and water use efficiency peaked in LR plot and P, presenting a contrasting trend. This study suggests that L. leucocephala may facilitate the growth of P. juliflora by improving the soil's nitrogen availability and, consequently, the eco-physiological characteristics of the plant in mixed plant stands. Furthermore, L. leucocephala is providing P. juliflora with favourable conditions for robust growth under water stress—a scenario indicative of Facilitative approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

TI  - Nanoremediation and Antioxidant Potential of Biogenic Silver Nanoparticles Synthesized Using Leucena’s Leaves, Stem, and Fruits
PY  - 2024

AB  - Synthetic dyes are persistent organic environmental pollutants that can cause extensive damage to living beings and to the ecosystem as a whole. Cost-effective, sustainable, and efficient strategies to deal with this type of pollution are necessary as it commonly resists conventional water treatment methods. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using the aqueous extract from the leaves, stem, and fruits of Leucaena leucocephala (Leucena) were produced and characterized through UV–vis, TEM, EDS, SDL, XPS, XRD, and zeta potential, and they proved to be able to promote adsorption to remediate methylene blue and tartrazine pollution in water. The nanoremediation was performed and did not require direct exposure to sunlight or any special lamp or a specific reduction agent. The AgNPs produced using the extract from the leaves exhibited the best performance in nanoremediation and also presented antioxidant activity that surpassed the one from butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Consequently, it is an interesting nanotool to use in dye nanoremediation and/or as an antioxidant nanostructure. © 2024 by the authors.

TI  - The genomes of seven economic Caesalpinioideae trees provide insights into polyploidization history and secondary metabolite biosynthesis
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196630558&doi=10.1016%2fj.xplc.2024.100944&partnerID=40&md5=11d234f38388b685ba0da698c70fed64
AB  - The Caesalpinioideae subfamily contains many well-known trees that are important for economic sustainability and human health, but a lack of genomic resources has hindered their breeding and utilization. Here, we present chromosome-level reference genomes for the two food and industrial trees Gleditsia sinensis (921 Mb) and Biancaea sappan (872 Mb), the three shade and ornamental trees Albizia julibrissin (705 Mb), Delonix regia (580 Mb), and Acacia confusa (566 Mb), and the two pioneer and hedgerow trees Leucaena leucocephala (1338 Mb) and Mimosa bimucronata (641 Mb). Phylogenetic inference shows that the mimosoid clade has a much higher evolutionary rate than the other clades of Caesalpinioideae. Macrosynteny comparison suggests that the fusion and breakage of an unstable chromosome are responsible for the difference in basic chromosome number (13 or 14) for Caesalpinioideae. After an ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) shared by all Caesalpinioideae species (CWGD, ∼72.0 million years ago [MYA]), there were two recent successive WGD events, LWGD-1 (16.2–19.5 MYA) and LWGD-2 (7.1–9.5 MYA), in L. leucocephala. Thereafter, ∼40% gene loss and genome-size contraction have occurred during the diploidization process in L. leucocephala. To investigate secondary metabolites, we identified all gene copies involved in mimosine metabolism in these species and found that the abundance of mimosine biosynthesis genes in L. leucocephala largely explains its high mimosine production. We also identified the set of all potential genes involved in triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis in G. sinensis, which is more complete than that based on previous transcriptome-derived unigenes. Our results and genomic resources will facilitate biological studies of Caesalpinioideae and promote the utilization of valuable secondary metabolites. © 2024 The Authors

TI  - Empirical Determination of the Carbon Impacts of Urban Forest Management in Hong Kong: Removal of Acacia confusa and Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2024

AB  - Urban trees contribute to decarbonisation. However, the removal of trees may release the stored carbon within them. In Hong Kong, Acacia confusa and Leucaena leucocephala are being removed, but with unknown carbon impacts. This industry-academia-government collaborative research aimed to: (1) report the amount of carbon stored inside Acacia confusa and Leucaena leucocephala harvested from slopes; (2) estimate the carbon storage of a tree using dendrometric measurements; and (3) explain the variation in carbon content percentage of urban trees with respect to tree species, part of the tree, and position within the part. 10 Acacia confusa and 10 Leucaena leucocephala were harvested during March- September, 2023. Each tree was weighed for carbon storage estimation. Results showed that Acacia confusa had higher mean wood volume, biomass and carbon storage than Leucaena leucocephala. The mean carbon content of the analysed samples (45.53-52.58%) were mostly significantly different from 50%. But the difference may become insignificant depending on how volatile carbon loss was controlled. Diameter at breast height (mm) was a significant predictor of carbon storage (kg) for both Acacia. confusa (β = 0.9574) and Leucaena leucocephala (β = 0.3909). Significant interaction between tree species and tree part on carbon content percentage was confirmed. This research demonstrated the impacts of past arboricultural decisions on present decarbonisation plans. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2024.

TI  - Effects of brining and standardized drying on the composition, shelf stability, microbial safety and antioxidant status of four wild edible vegetables
PY  - 2024

AB  - Wild edible vegetables (WEVs) are integral for sustained nutrition and livelihood of forest-dwelling tribal communities. Shelf-life enhancement of WEVs is crucial to overcome their perishability and ensure availability. Chemical preservatives are detrimental to their commercial ‘organic’ status, and modern processing technologies are often challenging to be implemented by the marginalized farmers. In this study, four nutritionally important WEVs popularly cultivated, consumed and marketed in the hilly, forest-covered state of Mizoram, India, namely, Solanum aethiopicum (ST), Solanum torvum (TP), Solanum anguivi (TT) and Leucaena leucocephala (JZ), were subjected to brining and drying to enhance their shelf-lives. The drying method was standardized using response surface methodology at 80 °C and 540 minutes, obtaining the lowest moisture content with the highest total phenolic content (TPC) and DPPH radical scavenging activity (DRSA). A strong positive correlation was obtained between TPC and DRSA values of ST (R = 0.738), TP (R = 0.760), TT (R = 0.977) and JZ (R = 0.935). Both brined bottled and dried vacuum-packaged samples were studied over 35 days of storage. Packaged dried samples were stored at room temperature (RT) and under refrigeration (RF). Brined WEVs showed a decrease in moisture and carbohydrate contents. Microbial conversion of sugars to lactic acid was evidenced by lowering pH to below 3.0. Bacterial activity also markedly enhanced TPC, flavonoids and DRSA values by causing free phenolics release and their structural transformation. However, overall microbial population in terms of aerobic coliform bacteria and fungal species were efficiently retarded up to more than 65% by the two treatments. Vacuum-packaged RF samples exhibited lowered microbial metabolism. Pigment degeneration and tissue structure changes were indicated by changed color and hardness. Dried tissue brittleness enhanced the extractability of bioactive compounds. Vacuum-packaging improved antioxidant retention in the processed WEVs. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Published title: Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) invasion: The opposite effects of fire and flood Erratum title: Dryer Pantanal wetlands may increase Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) invasion Leucaena leucocephala (hereafter L. leucocephala) is considered one of the 100 most invasive plant species in the world and has been found in areas subject to wildfire events and flooding.

In this way, the L. leucocephala proliferation has advanced across the Pantanal. Here, we assess the effects of the fire, flooding and distance to the source population on the invasion of L. leucocephala, and whether this dynamic negatively affects the richness of native plant species in the Brazilian Pantanal. Our results showed that at intermediate fire frequencies (areas burnt twice) and average flood levels, there is a decrease in L. leucocephala and an increase in native species. The effect of fire is limited to the medium flood level, where the occurrence of two burns reduces L. leucocephala compared to one and four burns. When the area is burned twice, the flood gradient reduces L. leucocephala invasion from the least to the most flooded area. In both high (four times) and low (once) fire frequencies the L. leucocephala regenerants only decrease when the flood level is high. In an expected scenario for the Pantanal is longer droughts this could mean a pronounced increase in L. leucocephala invasion over time. Therefore, reducing the flood period by climate changes or hydric enterprise projects that affect flood pulse may increase alien species invasion. Finally, it is necessary to find management methods that prevent the growth and spread of L. leucocephala without harming the native seed bank. Leucaena leucocephala (doravante L. leucocephala) é considerada uma das 100 espécies de plantas mais invasivas do mundo e tem sido encontrada em zonas sujeitas a incêndios florestais e inundações. A rápida capacidade de invasão da L. leucocephala pode levar à diminuição da diversidade local devido à exclusão das plantas nativas. Dessa forma, a proliferação da L. leucocephala tem avançado pelo Pantanal. Aqui, avaliamos os efeitos do fogo, inundação e distância da população fonte na invasão da L. leucocephala, e se essa dinâmica afeta negativamente a riqueza de espécies de plantas nativas no Pantanal brasileiro. Nossos resultados mostraram que a recorrência de fogo e o nível de inundação tiveram efeito oposto sobre a invasão de L. leucocephala. Áreas com baixo nível de inundação e maior ocorrência de fogo tendem a ter mais regenerantes de L. leucocephala, enquanto a distância da população de origem não teve efeito. L. leucocephala e plantas nativas ocupam locais com condições abióticas diferentes. Em um cenário esperado para o Pantanal de secas mais longas e incêndios mais frequentes, isso pode significar um aumento pronunciado na invasão de L. leucocephala ao longo do tempo. Portanto, o uso do fogo como ação de manejo para o controle da L. leucocephala não é recomendado, sendo necessário encontrar métodos para extrair ou eliminar o banco de sementes.

Aqui, avaliamos os efeitos do fogo, inundação e distância da população fonte na invasão da L. leucocephala, e se essa dinâmica afeta negativamente a riqueza de espécies de plantas nativas no Pantanal brasileiro. Os nossos resultados mostram que frequência intermédia de fogo (áreas queimadas duas vezes) e nível médio de inundação, há uma diminuição de L. leucocephala e um aumento de plantas nativas. O efeito do fogo é limitado ao nível médio de inundação, onde a ocorrência de duas queimadas reduz L. leucocephala em comparação com áreas queimadas uma ou quatro queimadas. Quando a área é queimada duas vezes, o gradiente de inundação reduz a invasão de L. leucocephala da área menos para a mais inundada. Em ambas as frequências de fogo, alta (quatro vezes) e baixa (uma vez), os regenerantes de L. leucocephala só diminuem quando o nível de inundação é alto. Em um cenário esperado para o Pantanal de secas mais longas isso pode significar um aumento pronunciado na invasão de L. leucocephala ao longo do tempo. Portanto, a redução do período de inundação por mudanças climáticas ou projetos de empreendimentos hídricos que afetam o pulso de inundação podem aumentar a invasão de espécies exóticas. Por fim, é necessário encontrar métodos de manejo que impeçam o crescimento e a disseminação de L. leucocephala sem prejudicar o banco de sementes nativas. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists 2025.

AB  - This study explores the development of urea-functionalized hydrochar from Leucaena leucocephala wood (LW) for CO2 capture. Hydrochar was produced via hydrothermal carbonization at 170 °C for 90 min and subsequently functionalized with urea. The effects of urea: hydrochar ratio (1:1 to 3:1), activation temperature (400–800 °C), and heating rate (5–15 °C/min) on CO2 adsorption capacity were investigated. Optimal conditions (2:1 urea: hydrochar ratio, 600 °C activation temperature, 5° C/min heating rate) increased CO2 adsorption capacity from 13.09 mg/g to 76.20 mg/g. The modified adsorbent demonstrated high affinity towards CO2 over N2, CH4, and O2, and maintained performance over 11 adsorption–desorption cycles. Kinetic studies revealed physisorption as the primary adsorption mechanism. In fixed-bed column tests, best performing conditions within the tested ranges (30 ml/min flow rate, 15% CO2 concentration, 30 °C) yielded a CO2 uptake of 195.54 mg/g. This study demonstrates the potential of urea-functionalized hydrochar from Leucaena leucocephala as an efficient, sustainable adsorbent for CO2 capture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Natural materials have a high potential to be used as coagulant/flocculant owing to the problems of inorganic materials. Petai belalang (Leucaena leucocephala) is a widely abundant plant in Malaysia and very efficient as a plant-based coagulant in previous research. This research investigated the effectiveness of seeds of L. leucocephala in removing turbidity from synthetic wastewater and the effect of operation parameters of jar test on treatment performance through optimization of dosage, pH, rapid mixing speed and time, slow mixing speed and time, and settling time. The water extraction method was used to extract the active ingredients from the seeds by drying and pulverizing the seeds and then dissolving them in distilled water at a concentration of 20 g/L. The extraction solution of the seeds gives removal efficiency of turbidity of 93.05% at the optimum operation parameters dosage, pH, rapid mixing speed and time, slow mixing speed and time, and settling time of 120 mg/L, 6.5, 260 rpm for 11 min, 30 rpm for 15 min, and 30 min, respectively. It is expected that bridging was the possible mechanism given that the flocs are formed under the same negative zeta potential condition. With this high performance of L. leucocephala, it has high potential to be used as a coagulant in wastewater treatment at specific operation parameters with further exploration to determine the optimum extraction method of the active ingredients. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.

TI  - Integrated organic and mineral fertilizer strategies for achieving sustainable maize yield and soil quality in dry sub-humid inceptisols
PY  - 2024

AB  - Maize is one of the important cereal crops grown in rainfed regions of northwestern Himalayas, however, persistent use of chemical fertilizers coupled with poor soil nutrients and water holding capacity due to coarse textured soils poses serious threat to sustaining maize yield and soil health. To address these bottlenecks, a long-term experiment with application of organic manures and mineral fertilizer provides insights to quantify changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), crop yield and rain water use efficiency (RWUE) in rainfed area having low water use efficiency. A twelve years field experiment was conducted under dry sub-humid Inceptisols in northern India to study the potential impacts of organic and mineral fertilization on maize (Zea mays L.) productivity, water use efficiency and soil quality. Ten treatments were assessed, involving different nitrogen levels (20, 30, and 40 kg N ha⁻¹) combined with 10 tha⁻¹ year⁻¹ of farmyard manure (FYM), in-situ green manure from sunhemp, and the incorporation of Leucaena leucocephala leaves at 5 tha⁻¹ year⁻¹, including an unfertilized control. Maize yield increased linearly with increasing nitrogen application rates. The combination of FYM @ 10t ha−1 and 40 kg N ha−1(T4) yielded the highest maize production. Manure addition improved soil organic carbon (SOC) and major soil nutrients (N, P and K) while unfertilized control showed decline in soil nutrients compared to their initial values. Compared with control, incorporation of 10 t ha−1 FYM increased SOC by 1.3, 1.41, 1.44 times at application rate of 20, 30, 40 kg N ha−1, respectively. Application of N@40 kg ha−1 + 10t FYM ha−1 showed highest rain water use efficiency (RWUE) and relative production efficiency index (RPEI) (2.74 kg ha−1 mm−1 and 82, respectively) and the lowest rank sum of 6. Highly significant positive relationship existed between RPEI and RWUE, RPEI and sustainability yield index (SYI), RWUE and SYI indicated the superiority of FYM in combination with mineral fertilizer. Regression models, correlating yield with monthly rainfall and crop growing periods, indicated that the integration of FYM (10 tha⁻¹) with 40 kg N ha⁻¹ was most effective in achieving the highest relative soil quality index (RSQI) of 76 and the greatest sustainability yield index (SYI) of 49.3%. Based on results, we recommend balanced fertilization (N@40 kg ha−1 +10t FYM ha−1) which is easily manageable by farmers as the optimal strategy for improving soil quality and achieving sustainable maize productivity in nutrient depleted Inceptisols of northern India. © The Author(s) 2024.

TI  - Heavy Metal Contamination in Rhizosphere of Plants at a Decommissioned Gold Mine Tailings Dam
PY  - 2024

AB  - The rhizosphere is an important interface for soil–plant interaction and a significant zone for the uptake and removal of heavy metals from soils. This study assesses the level of heavy metals contamination in the rhizosphere of plants growing at a decommissioned tailings dam in Ghana. Concentrations of heavy metals [Arsenic, Cadmium, Copper, Iron, Manganese and Zinc] and physicochemical parameters [pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, phosphate, nitrate, sulfate] of rhizospheric soils were determined. The assessment of the extent of rhizospheric contamination was conducted using the enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (Igeo), and pollution load index (PLI). Factor analysis unveiled the most relevant heavy metal contributors to rhizosphere contamination. Results indicate moderate to significant enrichment of Cd (1.72 – 8.28) and Mn (1.70 – 8.32) in the rhizosphere. The PLI showed that rhizospheres are heavily polluted (18.8 – 29.6) and thus require remediation. Principal component analysis revealed significant Cd, As, and Fe contamination in the rhizosphere accrues from anthropogenic or mining activities. The levels of heavy metal ions in the rhizosphere suggest that Mimosa pudica, Centrosema pubescens, Leucaena leucocephala, Pueraria phaseoloides, and Tridax procumbens could be investigated as candidates for phytostabilization of mine tailings. This study emphasizes the importance of effective remediation and continual tailing dam monitoring before and after decommissioning to avert the spread of heavy metal contaminants. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Water contamination that caused by heavy metals is a very common phenomenon in the industrial age. One of the popular way to treat metal contaminated water is by adsorption process using activated carbon as the adsorbent. This paper works on producing activated carbon by chemical means with impregnation ratios of NaOH:char (w/w) was predetermined at 1:1 (ACT1-1), 2:1 (ACT2-1) and 3:1 (ACT3-1) under activation temperature of 700 °C. In other to reduce cost of production, cheap raw material which is the Leucaena leucocephala was used as the precursor. The properties of these activated carbons and its potential for cadmium removal from aqueus solution was analyzed. It was found that the highest surface area was recorded at 662.76 m²/g. Four parameters were studied which are contact time, the effect of pH, initial concentration of adsorbate and temperature. The equilibrium time was achieved in 40 min treatment at initial concentrations of 30 mg/l. The adsorbent exhibited good sorption potential for cadmium at pH 8.0 and equilibrium temperature of 30 °C. Based on the results, this study had proved that activated carbon from Leucaena leucocephala biomass have the good potential to be used for removal of cadmium from wastewater. © 2024 Author(s).

AB  - This study aims to synthesize and characterize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from Leucaena leucocephala leaf extract and evaluate their effectiveness in photo-catalytically degrading indigo carmine (IC) dye in an aqueous solution. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized using UV-visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) was employed to optimize the conditions for the photocatalytic degradation of IC dye under solar light. The results show that 97.52% of the maximum photodegradation of IC dye was achieved using a dye concentration, catalyst volume, and reaction time of 19.7 mgL-1, 4.47 mL, and 97 min, respectively. RSM results revealed optimal conditions for IC dye degradation under solar irradiation. Moreover, the kinetics study of IC dye showed a good correlation with the pseudo-first order kinetic model. © 2024, Faculty of Engineering, Khon Kaen University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, a prominent invasive woody plant in India, is constantly recognised for its capacity to invade in various ecosystems. The chances of invasion by L. leucocephala are increasing due to rainfall variability, to which the plant has already adapted. However, the understanding of L. leucocephala, particularly its response to soil attributes and alterations in nutrient cycling processes under varying rainfall conditions, is currently inadequate. In response to the perceived threat of rainfall shift and invasion impacting native plant species through soil modification, the study was designed to investigate the interplay between L. leucocephala invasion and simulated rainfall conditions. The experimental setup included three rainout shelter plots receiving different precipitation levels (low, normal, and high) and subplots within each plot dedicated to pure stands of L. leucocephala. The study findings reveal significant variations in soil inorganic nitrogen and N-mineralization based on precipitation levels and seasons, with the highest values observed in the high rainfall plot and during the rainy season. In contrast, microbial biomass (carbon and nitrogen) peaked in the low rainfall plot and during the summer season, indicating a contrasting trend. The implications of the study suggest that, in addition to variable rainfall, L. leucocephala may play a significant role in altering nutrient cycling, particularly nitrogen cycling. The plant enhances soil properties related to nitrogen availability, creating opportunities for multiple invasions and potentially leading to a chance of “Invasion Meltdown,” with a significant threat to native biodiversity. Overall, the research is emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of these dynamics to formulate effective management strategies for preserving native ecosystems. © International Society for Tropical Ecology 2025.

AB  - Polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) formed by the interaction between oppositely charged polymers have emerged as promising carriers for accomplishing colon-specific release. In this study, we have explored the potential of polyelectrolyte complexes between a succinate derivative of Leucaena leucocephala galactomannan and cationic guar gum for colon delivery of synbiotic. The PECs were prepared using a polyelectrolyte complexation method and characterized. The PECs exhibited excellent stability, with high encapsulation efficiency for both probiotics (95.53 %) and prebiotics (83.33 %). In vitro studies demonstrated enhanced survivability and proliferation of the encapsulated probiotics in the presence of prebiotics (93.29 %). The SEM images revealed a smooth and firm structure with reduced number of pores when both prebiotic and probiotic were encapsulated together. The treatment with synbiotic PECs in acetic acid induced IBD rats significantly relieves colitis symptoms as was evident from colon/body ratio, DAI score and histopathology studies. An increase in the protein and reduced glutathione levels and reduction in superoxide dismutase activity was observed in colitic rats that received synbiotic treatment as compared to colitic rats. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Leucaena leucocephala succinate-cationic guar gum PECs as a promising system for colon-specific synbiotic delivery, with implications for improved gut health and the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders. © 2024 The Authors

TI  - Mature fruits of Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala plants have potential as inexpensive protein and mineral supplements for ruminants
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204625981&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-024-01066-8&partnerID=40&md5=2e7fd0ba43aab352ed7204d6bc415b97
AB  - Multifunctional leguminous trees like Gliricidia sepium Jacq. (Steud.) and Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (de Wit) are ideal for sustainable agro-ecological farming systems. They are commonly used in alley cropping to provide a sustainable source of nitrogen to cultivated crops or in silvopastoral systems where the leaves are used as livestock feed. However, these plants produce fruits that are not widely used. This study evaluated the nutritive value of mature fruits from G. sepium and L. leucocephala plants to determine their potential as supplemental feedstuffs for ruminants. Mature fruits were collected from 15 plants of each species and evaluated for crude protein (CP), total digestible nutrients (TDN), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), lignin, non-fiber carbohydrates, total digestible nutrients, minerals, phytochemicals, in-vitro ruminal dry matter degradability (IVDMD) and 48-h (h) in-vitro ruminal organic matter digestibility (IVOMD). The concentration of CP (242 g/kg DM) was approximately 28% higher in G. sepium fruits. The TDN (552 g/kg DM), NDF (560.1 g/kg DM) and 48-h IVOMD (590 g/kg) were superior in L. leucocephala fruits. Similarly, L. leucocephala fruits had significantly higher minerals (i.e., calcium, magnesium, potassium, among others). However, G. sepium fruits had lower concentrations of soluble and insoluble condensed tannins and mimosine. The immediately degradable fraction (265.9 g/kg DM), potential degradability (621.6 g/kg DM), and effective degradability (438.9 g/kg DM) values were higher in L. leucocephala fruits. We concluded that mature fruits of G. sepium plant may be a better protein supplement for poor quality grass forages than L. leucocephala because of higher CP and lower phytochemicals contents. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Using cooking oil at high temperatures can increase oil damage due to the formation of free fatty acids, which can be reduced by adsorption. Adsorption of Free Fatty Acids in Low Levels can still be improved using lamtoro char converted into activated carbon. Determining the equilibrium and thermodynamics of Lamtoro carbon as an adsorbent for frying tofu cooking oil is targeted in the research. Lamtoro activated carbon assistant ratio of 1:1.5 (Carbon:KOH). Furthermore, the mixture of materials is heated using a furnace at a temperature of 800 oC. The activated carbon is then washed and neutralized, sieved with a grain size of 400 mesh, and then granulated to a sieve size of 8-16 mesh. The adsorption process was carried out for 6 hours with a ratio of 1% (w/w) adsorbent to the weight of the used cooking oil. The characterization test was on the O-H hydrogen bonding ability between activated carbon and cooking oil. The Freundlich isotherm best describes the adsorption equilibrium (R2>0.93). Thermodynamic parameters, including enthalpy change, free energy, and entropy, were evaluated at 32-40 °C. Adsorption is endothermic and involves physical adsorption, indicating a spontaneous adsorption process. It can be recommended for processing used cooking oil in household kitchens. © 2024 Author(s).

TI  - Growth rate of male Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) fed leucaena and rice straw diets with increasing levels of cassava
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201667269&doi=10.1071%2fAN24070&partnerID=40&md5=6e3b4467f7fae11b47f7ab6331993dd9
AB  - Context: The planting and use of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) to fatten cattle is both practical and profitable for smallholder farmers in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Currently smallholder farmers feed leucaena as the primary component of a cattle fattening diet. However, the high protein content in leucaena could be more effectively used if combined with a fermentable energy source, such as cassava (Manihot utilissima). Aim: An experiment was conducted to determine the ratio of leucaena to cassava corresponding to largest average daily gain and most efficient feed conversion for gain. Methods: Thirty growing male Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) 18 months of age with an initial live weight of 164 ± 1.8 kg (mean ± s.e.) were allocated to one of six experimental treatments in a randomised block design. Bulls were held in individual stalls and had access to experimental diets and water ad libitum. The diets were 20% rice straw + 80% leucaena hay (A), 20% rice straw + 65% leucaena hay + 15% cassava meal (B), 20% rice straw + 50% leucaena hay + 30% cassava meal (C), 20% rice straw + 35% leucaena hay + 45% cassava meal (D), 20% rice straw + 20% leucaena hay + 60% cassava meal (E) and 20% rice straw + 5% leucaena hay + 75% cassava meal (F). A mineral mix was provided at 1% DM of total diet and urea was added to the cassava meal at 2% DM. In consideration of animal welfare concerns, the trial was concluded on Day 77 due to observations indicating that bulls receiving the highest level of cassava (F) were experiencing significant weight loss. Key results: The optimum level of inclusion of cassava was 29.5% (based on the quadratic response curve) but there was little difference in average daily gain up to 45% inclusion. Feeding a high level of cassava meal (more than 45% of diet) reduced feed intake, average daily gain and income over feed cost. Conclusion: Cassava meal can be successfully and profitably incorporated into leucaena-based rations of Bali bulls for fattening. Implications: Formulating rations with cassava meal and leucaena can be economically beneficial in cattle fattening systems.  © 2024 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - The presence of invasive plant species poses a substantial ecological impact, thus comprehensive evaluation of their potential range and risk under the influence of climate change is necessary. This study uses maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling to forecast the likelihood of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit invasion in Saudi Arabia under present and future climate change scenarios. Utilizing the MaxEnt modeling, we integrated climatic and soil data to predict habitat suitability for the invasive species. We conducted a detailed analysis of the distribution patterns of the species, using climate variables and ecological factors. We focused on the important influence of temperature seasonality, temperature annual range, and precipitation seasonality. The distribution modeling used robust measures of area under the curve (AUC) and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves, to map the invasion extent, which has a high level of accuracy in identifying appropriate habitats. The complex interaction that influenced the invasion of L. leucocephala was highlighted by the environmental parameters using Jackknife test. Presently, the actual geographic area where L. leucocephala was found in Saudi Arabia was considerably smaller than the theoretical maximum range, suggesting that it had the capacity to expand further. The MaxEnt model exhibited excellent prediction accuracy and produced reliable results based on the data from the ROC curve. Precipitation and temperature were the primary factors influencing the potential distribution of L. leucocephala. Currently, an estimated area of 216,342 km2 in Saudi Arabia was at a high probability of invasion by L. leucocephala. We investigated the potential for increased invasion hazards in the future due to climate change scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 245 and 585). The analysis of key climatic variables, including temperature seasonality and annual range, along with soil properties such as clay composition and nitrogen content, unveiled their substantial influence on the distribution dynamic of L. leucocephala. Our findings indicated a significant expansion of high risk zones. High-risk zones for L. leucocephala invasion in the current climate conditions had notable expansions projected under future climate scenarios, particularly evident in southern Makkah, Al Bahah, Madina, and Asir areas. The results, backed by thorough spatial studies, emphasize the need to reduce the possible ecological impacts of climate change on the spread of L. leucocephala. Moreover, the study provides valuable strategic insights for the management of invasion, highlighting the intricate relationship between climate change, habitat appropriateness, and the risks associated with invasive species. Proactive techniques are suggested to avoid and manage the spread of L. leucocephala, considering its high potential for future spread. This study enhances the overall comprehension of the dynamics of invasive species by combining modeling techniques with ecological knowledge. It also provides valuable information for decision-making to implement efficient conservation and management strategies in response to changing environmental conditions. © Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of inoculation and co-inoculation of rhizobia and Azospirillum brasilense combined with humic substances (HS) in growth promotion of Phaseolus lunatus (lima bean) and Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena). For this, experiments in a greenhouse with the cultivation of each plant species were carried out. A randomized complete block experimental design with five repetitions was followed. Plant seeds were sown and then inoculated with rhizobia and co-inoculated with A. brasilense. Subsequently, HS were added at the dose recommended by the manufacturer. In the experiments with both plants, control treatments with the addition of nitrogen (N) with or without HS were used. After 45 days, the shoot dry mass (SDM), root dry mass (RDM), shoot-accumulated N (Nac) and relative efficiency index (REI) were determined. In addition, the mass of dry nodules (MDN) in the lima bean plants and the number of nodules (NN) in leucaena plants were determined. The results showed that in the lima bean and leucaena plants there was a greater increase in SDM, RDM and Nac in treatments that received HS and co-inoculation with rhizobia and A. brasilense than in treatments that were inoculated only with rhizobia and HS and in treatments that received N and HS compared to addition of N and isolated inoculation of rhizobia. The combined application of HS and rhizobia in co-inoculation with A. brasilense had a greater effect on the increase of MDN in lima bean and NN in leucaena, than in treatments where only rhizobia with HS were added. These results indicate the existence of potential interaction of the use of HS with the co-inoculation of rhizobia and A. brasilense, showing promise for the production of sustainable agricultural crops. © 2024, Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia.

AB  - The medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) industries generate a substantial amount of waste and residues during the production of many important and useful products. If not effectively managed, these wastes can lead to environmental pollution and economic challenges. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on the use of these waste materials to create value-added products. One such method is vermicomposting which converts MAP wastes into vermicompost and offers numerous benefits for agricultural applications. Vermicompost serves as an organic fertilizer that improves soil health and fertility while reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. This comprehensive review explores the management of residual waste released from the MAPs industries, focusing on their conversion into vermicompost and their subsequent application in the agriculture sector. The waste generated during the extraction of essential oils from MAPs is also discussed along with the importance of implementing eco-friendly waste management solutions. Overall, this review sheds light on the production of MAP wastes, problems generated and the possible solutions for their environmental friendly management. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Slope exposure is one of the environmental factors that influences vegetation characteristics. Although there are studies on this aspect in various types of vegetation, up to now submontane shrublands have not been extensively studied. In this work, the effect of slope exposure on the structure and composition of plant species in a state park in northeastern Mexico where the dominant vegetation is submontane scrub was evaluated. Ten 10 x 10 m exposure sites were sampled: northeast, southwest and northwest. Total height (h), basal diameter (d0.10) and crown diameter (k) were measured for each individual. Our hypotheses were: 1) the northwestern exposure community will have greater basal area, canopy cover, volume, absolute abundance, and specific richness due to higher humidity, 2) each slope will present dissimilarity in species composition. As results, nine families, 17 genera and 17 species of vascular plants were recorded. Fabaceae was the best represented family with six species. The species with the highest importance value index were the endemic shrub Neopringlea integrifolia in the northeast exposure (21.52 %) and the exotic tree Leucaena leucocephala in the southwest (16.17 %) and northwest (27.16 %) exposures. It is concluded that the plant community of the northwest exposure has a greater basal area, crown cover, volume, absolute abundance and specific richness. However, there was no real difference in the species composition of the three exposures. © 2024 The author(s). Gayana Botánica and 2024 Universidad de Concepción.

AB  - Currently, empty fruit bunch (EFB) is the main biomass source to fuel biomass power plant and as co-firing fuel with coal at the existing coal-fired power plants in Malaysia. However, these power plants frequently face insufficient EFB supply, which may contribute to load losses. Energy crops a new source of biomass, are introduced to replace or substitute the shortage of biomass supply. Planting energy crops worldwide ensures a sufficient and cleaner fuel supply for power generation. Positive characteristics of the energy crop are including calorific value, carbon contents and density. Higher value of these parameters indicating the good quality of the energy crop. While, the negative characteristics of energy crop are including moisture content and ash content. Higher value of these two parameters indicating lower quality of energy crop. One of the studied energy crops was Leucaena leucocephala (Petai Belalang), which showed better quality than EFB, based on calorific value, moisture content, ash content and density. It is naturally grown, typically near rivers in Peninsular Malaysia. Furthermore, it can be easily planted and matures in about six months for harvesting. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - L’élevage de ruminants en Afrique subsaharienne (ASS) est pratiqué dans divers systèmes de production: systèmes mixtes agriculture-élevage, pastoraux, agropastoraux, intensifs des petits exploitants, et commerciaux intensifs de production de lait ou de viande (Vall et al., 2014). Les races locales de ruminants sont favorisées dans ces systèmes en raison de leur capacité à s’adapter aux conditions climatiques, alimentaires et sanitaires en contexte tropical. L’alimentation des ruminants en ASS se base principalement sur une diversité de ressources fourragères: les fourrages naturels herbacés et ligneux (Zornia glochidiata, Pennisetum pedicellatum, Combretum glutinosum, Sclerocarya birrea), les fourrages cultivés d’espèces herbacées et ligneuses (Panicummaximum, Brachiaria ruziziensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium) et les coproduits agricoles (pailles, tourteaux, sons). Les gaz à effet de serre (GES) émis pendant la production de ressources alimentaires sont essentiellement le CO2 et le N2O (Gerber et al., 2013) tandis que l’utilisation de ces ressources par l’animal est à l’origine d’émissions de méthane entérique (eCH4) essentiellement, de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O issus de la dégradation des déjections. Le secteur agricole (agriculture et élevage) de l’ASS contribue à 12 % des émissions mondiales de méthane (CH4) dont 71 % de eCH4 (Climatewatch, 2020). Selon la FAO (2023), l’élevage de ruminants dans cette région engendre une émission de eCH4 élevée lorsqu’elle est rapportée à la quantité de produits, due à la faible efficience alimentaire des animaux. Les intensités d’émissions de eCH4 sont par exemple de 58 g/kg lait en Afrique contre 24 g/kg lait en Asie et 17 g/kg lait en Europe de l’Ouest (GIEC, 2019).; Several methods have been proposed for in vivo measurement, prediction and mitigation of ruminant enteric methane (eCH4) emissions. Most of these methods are expensive, technically complex and not adapted to the specificities of livestock systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This review aims to analyze the different individual measurement techniques according to farming conditions in SSA. In vivo measurement techniques include the respiratory chamber, the ventilated hood, the GreenFeed system (C-Lock) and sulfur hexafluoride as a tracer. They are discussed and classified according to their field of application. The eCH4’s indirect measurement approaches rely on proxies (or predictors) derived from different biological matrices. In SSA, the proxies likely to be used in the various rearing conditions are the characteristics of intake (quantity, composition), milk (quantity, global composition estimated by MIR spectra), faeces (archeols, global composition estimated by SPIR spectra) or exhaled gases. Furthermore, potential eCH4 mitigation strategies adapted to SSA include 1) the use of tree legumes, by-product-based concentrates, crop co-products and residues, and preserved forages; 2) grazing improvement; 3) replacement of unproductive animals; 4) maintaining of animal good health; and 5) reducing of females first calving age. © 2024 INRAE Clermont-Ferrand - Auvergne - Rhone-Alpes.

AB  - Litterfall, decomposition, and nutrient release to the soil are important biogeochemical cycling processes in agroecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of decomposition and nutrient release of the leaves of four tree legumes with agroforestry potential: Piscidia piscipula, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Lysiloma latisiliquum, common in the areas with natural regeneration after the abandonment of agriculture in south-eastern Mexico. We employed 112 litterbags with 40 g of dry leaf litter on ground surface for decomposition and recollected seven bags per species at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. The initial and recollected samples were oven-dried, and weighed to determine the remaining dry mass (DM), organic matter (OM), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) content, and the C:N ratio. The initial OM and N contents of L. leucocephala leaves were greater, compared to the rest of the legumes. P. piscidia and G. sepium showed the highest C content. P. piscidia, G. sepium, and L. latisiliquum had the highest C:N ratio, compared to L. leucocephala. The relative decomposition rate k values of DM, OM, C, and N were greater for L. leucocephala. The remaining DM, OM, C, and N were affected by the interaction between species and decomposition time. G. sepium and L. latisiliquum showed greater remaining mass from 30 to 60 days of decomposition. However, after 60 days L. latisiliquum showed the greatest remaining DM and OM until the end of the incubation period (120 days). We conclude that L. leucocephala had the highest rate of decomposition and the fastest release of nitrogen, however, the asynchronous pattern of litter decomposition among the tree legumes showed the potential to supply OM and nutrients to the soil for a prolonged period if planted in combination in agroforestry systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Different studies have shown that leguminous forage species have a high impact and value in silvopastoral systems in terms of the contribution they represent for livestock feeding, based on the increase in both the potential of soils and the production of meat for livestock. The objective was to determine the productive potential in terms of dry matter in two contrasting seasons, dry and wet, for the leguminous species Albizia guachapele (Kunth) Dugand, Albizia niopoides (Benth.) Burkart, Albizia saman (Jacq.) Merr., and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. This study was conducted at the Nataima Research Center of the Colombian Agricultural Research Corporation, located in the municipality of Espinal-Tolima, Colombia, between March and August 2018. A design of repeated measures over time and arrangement of randomized complete blocks, four treatments, and two evaluation periods were used, and eight interactions between the species and rainy season factors were worked on. The species A. guachapele presented the best productive potential compared to the others; there were statistical differences for cutting times in the species evaluated, and a high variability effect was observed due to the time factor. A. saman was the least productive species, while production stabilization was demonstrated for all those evaluated over time. There was no significant bidirectional interaction for the season factor, and the best performance corresponded to those carried out in the dry season. This allowed a greater expression of the productive potential as a food alternative for low rainfall areas. © 2024, Rev. Mex. Cienc. Agricolas. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) is a leguminous tree widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions due to its strong environmental suitability for abiotic stresses, especially drought. However, the molecular mechanisms and key pathways involved in Leucaena's drought response require further elucidation. Here, we comparatively analyzed the physiological and early transcriptional responses of Leucaena leaves and roots under drought stress simulated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments. Drought stress induced physiological changes in Leucaena seedlings, including decreases in relative water content (RWC) and increases in relative electrolyte leakage (REL), malondialdehyde (MDA), proline contents as well as antioxidant enzyme activities. In response to drought stress, 6461 and 8295 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the leaves and roots, respectively. In both tissues, the signaling transduction pathway of plant hormones was notably the most enriched. Specifically, abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and signaling related genes (NCED, PP2C, SnRK2 and ABF) were strongly upregulated particularly in leaves. The circadian rhythm, DNA replication, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and secondary metabolites biosynthesis related pathways were repressed in leaves, while the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis processes were promoted in roots. Furthermore, heterologous overexpression of Leucaena drought-inducible genes (PYL5, PP2CA, bHLH130, HSP70 and AUX22D) individually in yeast increased the tolerance to drought and heat stresses. Overall, these results deepen our understanding of the tissue-specific mechanisms of Leucaena in response to drought and provide target genes for future drought-tolerance breeding engineering in crops.

AB  - Wood is an abundant and renewable resource with considerable potential for upcycling into high-value products such as biochar, thereby facilitating the conversion of waste into useful materials. The structural and compositional diversity among wood species significantly influences the properties of the resulting biochar. This study aimed to investigate the properties of biochar derived from five distinct hardwood species, all sourced from the same tropical region and produced under standardized pyrolysis conditions using a patented furnace. The hardwood species examined were Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit.), paper flower climber (Getonia floribunda (Roxb.) Lam.), rain tree (Samanea saman (Jacq.) Merr.), climbing wattle (Albizia myriophylla Benth.), and Siamese blachia (Blachia siamensis Gagnep.). The investigation focused on fundamental properties of the biochar, including morphology, elemental composition (C, H, N, O), water-holding capacity, aromaticity (H/C ratio), polarity (O/C and (O+N)/C ratios), and the C/N ratio. Results indicated that all five biochar types were of high quality, with carbon contents ranging from 66.64% to 84.76%, a high degree of aromaticity (H/C < 0.7), low polarity, and enhanced stability. The biochars exhibited a range of pore structures from macropores to mesopores, with pore volumes of 0.010–0.074 cm³/g and specific surface areas ranging from 2.92 m²/g to 144.59 m²/g. These structural attributes influence their water-holding capacities; however, the relationships among polarity, pore volume, pore size, and water-holding capacity remain unresolved. The findings highlighted substantial variability in the properties and morphology of the biochars, despite their production under identical conditions. This variability underscores the need for further in-depth studies to elucidate the factors governing biochar properties and to enable the tailoring of biochar for specific applications. © 2025, Ital Publication.

TI  - High efficient preparation of low molecular weight galactomannan from Leucaena leucocephala galactomannan through the combination of hydrogen peroxide and oxalic acid

AB  - Researchers have always been interested in polysaccharide degradation because of the increased biological activity and usability following degradation. In this work, low molecular weight galactomannan (LMW-GM) was produced through the degradation of galactomannan by H2O2 and oxalic acid (OA). The optimal reaction conditions were found by conducting the response surface optimization experiment based on single-factor experiment and kinetics analysis. Under these conditions, the LMW-GM yield was 69.48 ± 1.02 %. Ultimately, an analysis of the degradation process revealed that OA attacked GM indiscriminately, and H2O2 has a stronger effect on the removal of branched chains while degrading GM. Hence, the degradation steps were rearranged as H2O2 was added 20 min before OA at a constant total time. The LMW-GM yield was successfully increased to 76.49 ± 1.27 %. The goal of this work is hopefully to give a theoretical foundation for the low-cost preparation and industrial production of the degradation of galactomannan. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Potential of Leucaena leucocephala (white leadtree) seed flour as a functional food with umami taste
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204969981&doi=10.26656%2ffr.2017.8%284%29.318&partnerID=40&md5=39f8aff04c3c653a540f6bc3b33e741d
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (White leadtree) legume seed is promoted in several countries of Southeast Asia. The young pods are edible and occasionally eaten by Indonesians because of their unique combination taste of savory, sweet and slightly bitter. This study investigated the processing effects of steam blanching on the protein profile (total amino acids) and the taste components of L. leucocephala seed flour. A 5-minute steam blanching on seeds increased the soluble sugar components from 10.59±1.091 to 14.78±1.590 mg/g (dry basis) and free amino acids content from 39.25±2.260 to 49.66±2.070 mg/g on the seed flour. On the other hand, steam blanching could decrease the content of the organic acid (167.78±4.800 mg/g to 149.29±10.420 mg/g) and the value of total amino acids from 23.86±1.293 (%w/w) to 24.43±1.411 (%w/w). Leucaena leucocephala seed flour had an essential amino acids ratio (E/T) value of 37.09±2.340– 37.94± 1.130, predicted protein efficiency ratio (P-PER) of 0.27±0.002–0.30±1.668. In addition to the umami taste contributor component, a nucleotide compound was detected in fresh and steamed seed flour namely inosine-monophosphate (IMP). Equivalent umami concentration (EUC) showed that L. leucocephala seed flour contains high MSG-like components (425.92±4.76 to 540.12±13.05 mg MSG/100 g). Glutamic acid and aspartic acid, in line with Inosine Monophosphate (IMP), are MSG-like components providing a savory taste, known as ‘umami’ by receptors in humans. Steam blanching for five minutes prevented the degradation of sweet and savory compounds. Thus, the seed flour of L. leucocephala is notably marked to be utilized as an alternative to functional food with an umami taste. © 2024 The Authors.

TI  - Effects of Urea-Molasses, Maize Bran, and Ipil-ipil Leaf Meal on the Quality of Cogon Grass Silage at Different Harvesting Intervals
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214350404&doi=10.61310%2fmjst.v22i2.2183&partnerID=40&md5=db642075e58793a98fffdb8ed33a0bc7
AB  - The study examines how varying harvesting intervals and processing methods affect the physicochemical and nutritional properties of Cogon grass (Imperata cylindrica Linn) silage. Its goal is to determine optimal practices for improving silage quality and nutritional value to support sustainable livestock feeding in tropical regions. A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used, with four treatments based on harvesting intervals (20, 25, 30, and 35 days) and three replications per treatment. Cogon grass silages were enhanced with 2.1% urea molasses, 5.12% maize bran, and 8.9% Ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf meal to improve fermentation and nutrition. The 20-day interval (T1) had the highest dry matter (DM, 39.1%) and crude protein (CP, 9.25%), while the 35-day interval (T4) had the lowest (30.2% DM, 5.66% CP). Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was highest in T1 (78.0%) and lowest in T3 (76.8%). Gross energy ranged from 4606 to 4832 cal/g, with no significant differences. Silage pH decreased with longer harvest intervals, with T4 recording the lowest pH (4.64), indicating better fermentation. Total soluble solids (TSS) were highest in T1 (0.80 °Brix) and lowest in T4 (0.12 °Brix). Sensory evaluations showed silages harvested at 20 and 25 days (T1 and T2) were most acceptable in color, odor, and moisture. Harvesting Cogon grass at 20–25 days and supplementing with urea molasses, maize bran, and Ipil-ipil leaf meal produced high-quality silage with enhanced nutrition and fermentation, offering a sustainable feeding strategy for tropical livestock. © 2024 University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines.

TI  - Phytochemicals derived from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) biomass and their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities: HPLC analysis of extracts
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141191798&doi=10.1007%2fs13399-022-03420-1&partnerID=40&md5=5f3fc1033f13f88b776fe28ac0b8aa57
AB  - The biomass production from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (family Fabaceae) is a valuable source for chemical biorefinery. The bioactive molecules from the methanol extracts (MEs) from various parts of L. leucocephala grown in Egypt were evaluated. The antibacterial activity against the growth of Erwinia amylovora, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined by the inhibition zones (IZs) and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The antifungal activity against the growth of Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, and Alternaria solani was recorded by measuring the fungal growth inhibition (FGI %) and MICs. The phytochemical compounds in the MEs were identified by HPLC–DAD, where the higher compounds identified (mg/kg ME) in seeds were benzoic acid (1520.44), myricetin (848.73), and rosmarinic acid (792.46); in roots, were benzoic acid (554.04), naringenin (419.99), and myricetin (205.51); in leaves were rosmarinic acid (4768.16), resveratrol (2983.99), quercetin (2052.43), myricetin (1432.63), and naringenin (1182.39); in branches, were rosmarinic acid (2230.26), resveratrol (1605.3), o-coumaric acid (691.16), and myricetin (681.93); in fruits were rosmarinic acid (431.43) and resveratrol (261.07); in stem-wood, were ellagic acid (1319.75), p-coumaric acid (1051.59), and ferulic acid (512.45); and in stem-bark, were resveratrol (1079.01), benzoic acid (1071.11), and catechol (305.51). The MEs at the concentration of 4000 mg/L from stem-wood, leaves, and stem-bark, the higher IZs against the growth of E. amylovora, A. tumefaciens, and S. aureus with values of 4.06 cm, 2.5 cm, and 2.63 cm, respectively, were found. The range of MICs values of MEs was 75–500 mg/L, 75–125 mg/L, and 75–125 mg/L, against the growth of A. tumefaciens, E. amylovora, and S. aureus, respectively. MEs prepared from seeds, fruits (pod), and stem-bark at 4000 mg/L showed the higher FGI (100%) against the growth of A. solani; MEs from seeds and branches observed the higher FGI values of 63.83% and 63.6%, respectively, against the growth of F. solani, and all MEs showed potent antifungal activity (FGI 100%) against R. solani except for leaf ME (88.06%). MICs were in the range of 250–500, 250–500, and 500–1000 mg/L against A. solani, F. solani, and R. solani, respectively. At 500 mg/L, the roots ME showed the highest total antioxidant activity (94.30%) compared to vitamin C (VC) (98.30%) at 100 mg/L. The EC50 values of the MEs from seeds, fruits, stem-bark, branches, stem-wood, leaves, and roots were 424.24 mg/L, 131.40 mg/L, 341.78 mg/L, 380.50 mg/L, 153.59 mg/L, 153.59 mg/L, and 129.89 mg/L compared with VC (6.88 mg/L). In conclusion, the botanical parts of L. leucocephala have several bioactive compounds, which can act as promising antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. © The Author(s) 2022.

TI  - Enhancing nutrient intake, egg production, and egg quality by fermented Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal in a diet of laying quail
PY  - 2025
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217147884&doi=10.14202%2fvetworld.2025.133-140&partnerID=40&md5=79bc65bc64b8ed921af5b0c8d540f714
AB  - Background and Aim: The inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM) in poultry feed is often limited due to its high crude fiber and mimosine content. This study investigates the potential of fermented LLM (FLM) to enhance nutrient intake, egg production, and egg quality in laying quails by reducing anti-nutritional factors through fermentation. Materials and Methods: Two hundred 42-day-old laying quails were assigned to five dietary treatments: T0 (control) = 100% basal diet (BD), T1 = 98% BD + 2% FLM, T2 = 96% BD + 4% FLM, T3 = 94% BD + 6% FLM, and T4 = 92% BD + 8% FLM. Parameters including nutrient intake (energy, protein, fat, calcium, phosphorus), feed conversion ratio (FCR), egg production, egg weight, eggshell thickness, Haugh unit, and yolk color were measured over a 28-day trial. Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance, followed by Duncan’s test for significant differences (p ≤ 0.05). Results: FLM supplementation significantly improved energy, protein, fat, calcium, and phosphorus intake while reducing FCR. At 4% FLM inclusion, significant enhancements in egg production, eggshell thickness, Haugh unit, and yolk color were observed. Conversely, fiber intake and overall feed intake remained unaffected across treatments. The highest egg production (56.43%) and best yolk color (8,95) were observed in the 8% FLM group. Conclusion: Incorporating FLM into the diets of laying quails effectively enhances nutrient utilization and improves egg production and quality without increasing feed intake. The optimal inclusion level for maximizing benefits appears to be 4-8% FLM. Copyright: Utami and Akbar.

TI  - Growth and pulpwood traits of Leucaena leucocephala and Eucalyptus camaldulensis at rainfed and irrigated sites in southern India
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181102940&doi=10.1016%2fj.tfp.2023.100482&partnerID=40&md5=12a4e60e0ce7ee1c39ff209035924616
AB  - Growth and wood traits of Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata were compared with India's most widely grown pulpwood, Eucalyptus. Three Leucaena seedlots and sixty-four Leucaena clones selected in plantations established from two Indian land races and a Hawaiian seed source were tested together with five commercial E. camaldulensis clones at two contrasting sites in southern India. At the wetter, irrigated site, the three sources of Leucaena clones had significantly greater 4-year height and similar mean stem diameter to the Eucalyptus clones, while the Leucaena seedlots were slower-growing. At the semi-arid, rainfed site, Eucalyptus grew faster and had better survival than the three sources of Leucaena clones, which again were similar in their performance and superior to the Leucaena seedlots. Basic densities, determined from breast-height wood cores, of 4-year-old Leucaena and Eucalyptus were quite similar (568 and 534 kg m-3 respectively) at the irrigated site, but at the rainfed site Eucalyptus wood density was higher (590 kg m-3), while that of Leucaena was lower (508 kg m-3). The kraft pulp yield (KPY) of Leucaena clones was about 1.5 % higher than Eucalyptus at both sites; KPYs of both species were 1.8 % lower at the rainfed than the irrigated site. Leucaena fibres were 31 % and 39 % longer and 65 % and 58 % wider than Eucalyptus, at the irrigated and rainfed sites respectively, and had lower cell wall proportions. Differences among Leucaena clones were significant for growth traits and for most wood and fibre traits, indicating the potential for selecting fast-growing Leucaena clones with improved wood properties. Clonal Leucaena plantations can serve as a productive and complementary pulpwood crop to Eucalyptus in southern India, increasing the yield and strength of blended pulps. © 2023

TI  - Twenty-one years’ impact of using organic amendments on the productivity of rice-wheat rotation and soil properties
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187125238&doi=10.1016%2fj.fcr.2024.109311&partnerID=40&md5=0628494e062c549b7b03921149a69dc4
AB  - Shifting from chemical-intensive practices to organic-based farming within the rice-wheat rotation (RWR) is crucial for its long-term sustainability. This highly productive system holds a significant carbon (C) sequestration potential if managed efficiently. The dynamics of soil organic-C profoundly impacts the global climate change and crops’ productivity, necessitating the continuous monitoring of organic carbon to ensure soil vitality. Hence, we have evaluated the long-term (twenty-one years) impact of organic amendments on yields of the RWR, soil properties and C-dynamics. After 21 years, we observed that organic-based amendments increased the rice and wheat grain yields by 33.4–52.5% and 20–42.8%, respectively, over the control (no organics). On an average, in top 0.0–0.15 m soil layer, the organic-manured plots had 21.6%, 21.3% and 23.4% greater available nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) over the control plot, respectively. Furthermore, such organic-manured plots recorded 32.9–50.8% and 6.04–32.3% greater microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) over the control. Also, the use of organic amendments had a significant (p≤0.05) and positive impact on the soil carbon dynamics (0.0–0.45 m). In 0.0–0.45 m soil depth, the organic-manured treatments registered a 25.9–44.2% greater total organic carbon (TOC) than the control. These treatments improved the active (labile, very labile) and recalcitrant (less labile, non-labile)-C pools especially in upper soil layers. In summary, the synergistic use of Sesbania green manure, Leucaena leucocephala leaf manuring, farmyard manure, and biofertilizers (blue-green algae/Azotobacter etc.) proves effective in restoring soil health and enhancing crop productivity by increasing soil organic carbon and ensuring nutrients availability. Thus, these organic amendment treatments can be advocated to farmers to sustain the productivity of the rice-wheat ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Potential of decomposing leaf litter of Leucaena leucocephala in influencing mycoflora of the soil and its role in increasing soil fertility
PY  - 2024

AB  - To determine whether Multipurpose Tree (MPT) species are suitable as a source of nutrients for growing crops, residual leaf material needs to be analyzed for its decomposition rate and patterns. A detailed study of the nutrients released in soil by the amendment of decomposing leaf litter of Leucaena leucocephala and its influence on rhizosphere mycoflora, fertility, and yield parameters of the plant was conducted. The effect of leaf litter amendment on soil in terms of soil structure was assessed by analyzing soil for its pH, nutrient content, and organic matter at different stages of crop growth. Increased soil fertility in agricultural production was estimated by various growth and yield characteristics of Trigonella foenum-graecum. The estimation of rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere fungus populations both from amended and control soils were made and the readings were expressed as percent frequency of occurrence. The amendment of soil with litter resulted in an increase in the number of fungi (18,000/g soil) as compared to the control soil (7200/g soil). The addition of the organic mulch favored the mycorrhizal colonization of roots. At 90 days of plant growth, the percent colonization was more than two times of those growing in control soil and 90% of roots showed colonization with mycorrhiza. By amending the soil with litter, both organic carbon and organic matter increased. The highest amount of phosphorus observed in the soil of the control plot (32.27 mg/g) was still lesser than the highest amount of phosphorus observed in the experimental plot (38.79 mg/g). Compared to control soil, amended soil had higher yields. Thus, Leucaena leucocephala, widely used for reforestation in semi-arid and arid regions, contributes significantly to the soil's fertility through its fallen and decomposing leaves. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Society for Plant Research 2023.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the diversity of insects, including stingless bees (Heterotrigona) in the mangrove ecosystem of Beras Basah Village, Langkat Regency, North Sumatra, Indonesia. The mangrove plantation in Beras Basah Village contained 11 species, including Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora. stylosa, Avicennia marina, Sonneratia alba, Bruguiera gymnorhizza, Xylocarpus granatum, Excoecaria agallocha, Scyphiphora hydrophyllacea, Lumnitzera racemosa, and Nypa fruticans. Additionally, five flowering plant species were identified in the vicinity: Antigonon leptopus, Asclepias curassavica, Helianthus annuus, Calliandra grandiflora, Portulaca grandiflora. Other plant species recorded in the area included Cocos nucifera, Pandanus amaryllifolius, Leucaena leucocephala, Ziziphus mauritiana, Albizia chinensis, and Terminalia catappa. Insect identification from four observations using sweep nets, yellow sticky traps, and blue pan traps resulted in the collection of 1,525 individual insects belonging to eight orders, 17 families, and 19 genera. These insects included ten predators and pests, comprising five Odonata species (Neurothemis terminata, Orthetrum sabina, Orthetrum testaceum, Potamarcha congener, Zyxomma obtusum) and five ant species (Camponotus spp., Crematogaster spp., Nylanderia spp., Odontoponera denticulate, Pheidole spp.). The insect functional status within the mangrove area was determined to include seven species of scavengers, 12 species of herbivores, two species of pollinators, 19 species of predators, one species of parasitoid, and four species of insect disease vectors. This study provides valuable insights into the insect diversity and ecological roles within the mangrove ecosystem of Beras Basah Village, contributing to a better understanding of the conservation and management of this important habitat. © 2025, IPB University Department of Agronomy and Horticulture.

AB  - In Benin, livestock breeders frequently use medicinal plants to treat gastrointestinal diseases in small ruminants. The aim of this review is to list the plants traditionally used in this context and to present the scientific findings on the efficacy of these plants. An extensive search was carried out using PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Biomed Central and Google Scholar databases to collect data, with combinations of relevant french and english keywords such as “ethnobotanical survey”, “anthelmintic properties”, “medicinal plants”, “gastrointestinal parasites”, “digestive strongyles”, “Haemonchus”, “Trichostrongylus”, “small ruminants”, “sheep”, “goats” and “Benin”. A total of 45 published articles met the eligibility criteria. This review listed 123 plants used by breeders to treat gastrointestinal ailments in small ruminants. The most commonly used parts are leaves and barks, and the most common forms are decoction, maceration and powder. Scientific studies have demonstrated the anthelmintic properties of 18 plants, including Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides, Newbouldia laevis, Mitragyna inermis and Combretum glutinosum. The powders or leaf extracts of these plants showed in vivo significant reductions of over 50% in egg excretion, larval establishment, viability and fertility of gastrointestinal strongyles in small ruminants. Extracts of these plants also revealed in vitro inhibitory activity of over 50% on egg hatching, larval migration and motility of gastrointestinal strongyles. This manuscript highlights the traditional use of anthelmintic plants in small ruminants in Benin and provides scientific results supporting the efficacy of these plants. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The effects of white-popinac on regenerating seasonal semideciduous forests propagate across spatial scales
PY  - 2024

AB  - Biological invasions are complex scale-dependent processes. Metacommunity ecology provides the means to understand the effects of invasive species (IS) because it explicitly considers how local and regional processes interact to drive the three main components of biodiversity: alpha, beta, and gamma. White-popinac (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) is a widely distributed IS in regenerating forests in the Atlantic Forest (Brazil). White-popinac establishment results in a particular spatial occupancy as the species forms dense and homogeneous patches, instead of spreading individuals throughout invaded areas. Here we took advantage of this unique spatial configuration formed by fragments of native forest and their respective regenerating areas, partially occupied by patches of white-popinac, to investigate how local and regional dynamics of plant metacommunities and communities under natural regeneration are affected by white-popinac. We conducted replicated multi-strata surveys in 131 communities distributed among 29 metacommunities of regenerating forests that had different ages of white-popinac invasion. We found (i) Mirrored responses among local and regional scales: at both scales, native species richness decreased with the increase of invasion age, whereas IS richness increased; and (ii) β-diversity of native species decreased with the increase of invasion age, showing that time-advance of invasion led to a homogenizing effect. We also found evidence that the advance of white-popinac patches towards regenerating forests increases with time and proximity to the forest fragment, which likely had indirect effects on regenerating communities by reducing the size of the regenerating area. Our results indicate that the effects of white-popinac invasions on regenerating forests can be so vigorous that they propagate from the local to the regional scale, via a decrease in β-diversity. We reinforce the importance of considering multiscale approaches on assessing effects of white-popinac invasions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The utilization of chemically derived herbicides has caused many negative impacts, it is essential to investigate some biosynthetic products, being an alternative for inhibiting weeds. The inhibition of Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit. extract on plant germination and growth is reported. Many components belonging to the allelochemical group were found in distinctive parts’ extract of L. leucocephala, mostly detected in leaves with flavonoid 292.7 mg QE/g extract and phenolic 397.6 mg GA/g extract. The findings proved that the extract inhibited the plant germination and growth in various test concentrations, being the highest point at the concentration of 20 mg/mL extract. In this condition, the inhibitory effects regarding each parameter were 70% (seed germination), 91.46% (root length), 69.89% (stem length), 78.73% (fresh weight), and 49.53% (dry weight). Furthermore, this study also revealed the inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) of the extract on germination, starting the inhibition at 17.40 mg/mL. The content of photosynthetic pigments and water uptake decreased gradually after 7-day treatment, suggesting that the ethanol extract from L. leucocephala influenced these biological processes which directly caused the plant growth inhibition. © 2024 Association of Agricultural Technology in Southeast Asia.

AB  - The Grey Francolin, a Phasianidae species native to India and Pakistan, was introduced to Reunion Island in the XVIIIth century for hunting. One of its populations resides in the Rivière des Pluies riverbed, in the island's north, a secondary vegetation area surrounded by an industrial zone. The study aimed to determine the minimum daily movements, home range size, and macro-habitat use of individuals during the breeding season, as well as the species used for roosting at night. Six individuals from four different pairs were fitted with GPS. Home ranges ranged from 2.4 to 5.8 ha (MCP 100) and from 2.1 to 8.3 ha (Kernel 95), with averages of 4.5 ± 1.2 (MCP 100) and 5.0 ± 3.0 (Kernel 95). Minimum daily movements varied from 252 to 513 m, averaging 402 ± 147 m per day. GPS points were found in three macro-habitats: wooded areas with Pithecellobium dulce and Leucaena leucocephala (62%), pebble riverbed (23%), herbaceous vegetation (13%), but never in the urban zone. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to identify suitable plants for remediating metal pollution in copper tailing soil and supporting ecological reclamation in Dongchuan, Yunnan, focusing on three major mining regions: Tangdan, Yinmin, and Lanniping. Methods: The Nemerow comprehensive pollution index was employed to evaluate the metal contamination levels, and the enrichment and transfer capacities of the dominant plants for Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn were analyzed to identify remediation candidates. Results: The findings revealed severe pollution in the copper tailing soil, with Cu as the primary pollutant, and with a pollution rate of 77.778%. A total of 96 plant species from 42 families and 87 genera were recorded, including 29 dominant species across 17 families and 26 genera, with herbs comprising 62.068% of the dominant types. Among the tested plants, Leucaena leucocephala, Rumex acetosa, Festuca rubra, and Salix balfouriana exhibited significantly higher metal enrichment and transfer capacities, rendering them for ecological restoration. Salix balfouriana with the highest comprehensive membership function score of 5.298 was identified as the preferred species for ecological restoration in the Dongchuan Cu tailing area. Correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between the metal content in underground plant parts and both the total metal content and organic matter (OM) in the rhizosphere soil, whereas a negative correlation was observed with soil pH. Discussion: The soil in the Dongchuan Cu tailing area is severely contaminated by metals, mainly Cu. Among the identified plants, S. balfouriana emerged as the most suitable candidate for metal accumulation. This study establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for the application and promotion of phytoremediation technology in the Dongchuan copper tailings area.

TI  - Larger water use efficiency associated with greater dependence on deep water sources in hot-dry valleys with reservoirs

AB  - Identifying the carbon–water relationship of plants helps to understand their adaptive water use strategies. The relationship between WUE and the water source remains uncertain in the hot-dry valleys with reservoirs. The leaf δ13C and soil and xylem water isotopes (δ2H and δ18O) were determined to identify the WUE and water source contributions, respectively, in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit communities. We propose a source contributing score (SCS), calculated as a value for the contribution of water from different soil layers (a higher SCS value indicates plants use deeper water sources). The positive relationship between leaf δ13C and SCS (R2 = 0.16, P = 0.022) and the negative relationship between leaf δ13C and topsoil contribution (R2 = 0.21, P = 0.009) confirmed the close association of larger WUE with less reliance on shallow soil water. The redundancy analysis suggested a stronger connection between leaf δ13C and d-excess than leaf δ13C and topsoil moisture content, which emphasized the key role of soil moisture d-excess. Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) suggested soil properties and microclimate explain more than 89.8 % of the variations in tree water use. VPA also suggested different roles of microclimate and soil properties in explaining tree water use strategies. Findings broadened the understanding of the relationship between WUE and water sources and emphasized the key role of soil moisture d-excess in hot-dry valleys with reservoirs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Index Development to Comprehensive Assess Liver Function during the Dairy Cows’ Transition Period in Low-Tropic Conditions
PY  - 2024

AB  - The aim of this work was to develop a liver tissue function index during the transition period of dairy cows managed in low-tropic conditions. In two farms, twenty crossbred and synthetic native cows during the peripartum period were selected, and blood samples were taken on days −30 and −15 prepartum, the calving day, and 7, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80 and 105 days postpartum for serum metabolic tests. On each measurement day, body condition scores (BCS) and parameters on nitrogen metabolism (total protein—TP, albumin—ALB, globulin—GLOB, urea), adipose tissue metabolism (cholesterol—COL, non-esterified fatty acids—NEFA) and two transaminases (alanine aminotransferase—ALT and aspartate aminotransferase—AST) were evaluated. Data analysis included the Spearman correlation, principal components, multiple linear regression and cluster analysis. Results showed that regarding the days after calving and BCS, a liver tissue function index can be constructed using the TP, urea, COL, ALT and NEFA. The estimated index generated three groupings, both by days after calving and BCS. In the former, the index discriminated the metabolic behavior in the prepartum, parturition and postpartum periods, while in the latter, the index discriminated between extreme (2.25, 2.50 and 4.25), slightly low (2.75 and 3.0) and slightly high (3.25 to 4) conditions. The results allow us to conclude that it is feasible to construct mathematical function indexes for liver function to monitor metabolic changes during highly demanding productive phases in dairy cows under tropical conditions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Rubberwood sawdust is one of the most common materials used as mushroom material in Malaysia, one of the South East Asia countries and its depletion is becoming one of the challenges in mushroom cultivation. A quest for alternative resources was rigorously conducted by using various biomass such as paddy straw, spent mushroom compost, paper boxes, and river tamarind wood (Leucaena leucocephala). A conventional determination method for alternative materials amount is based on yield analysis at different mixing compositions. This method took too much time for investment and experiment with. Thus, the goal of this study is to find out the effectiveness of using the Pearson Square method for mushroom material preparation with the desired nutrient level based on calculation. To begin, the carbon and nitrogen content of all materials used was determined by dry combustion and the Kjeldahl method respectively. Next, the desired carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C: N) was formulated based on the C: N of the conventional formulation that consists of rubberwood sawdust, rice bran and calcium carbonate (limestone) at 100:10:1 ratio which acts as a reference. Four different material combinations with similar C: N were calculated by the Pearson Square method and prepared. These combinations including control were inoculated by the spawn of grey oyster mushroom (Pleurotus pulmonarius). Parameters of spawn running rate, height of stipe, diameter of pileus and biological efficiency (BE) were measured and analyzed. The mushroom yield obtained shows that there is no significant difference between the material combinations according to standard deviation and one-way ANOVA, indicating all material combinations have similar nutrient content and the application of the Pearson Square method is verified. In summary, the Pearson Square method was proven can be applied in preparing mushroom material from different resources with the desired nutrient level. © 2025 Author(s).

AB  - Cities are the primary distribution areas of most invasive plant species and the important starting point of invasion for many invasive plant species. As one of the important issues in urban ecosystems, the composition of urban invasive plant species and their impacts on plant diversity have received increasing attention. With the built-up area of Shenzhen as a case study, we analyzed the species composition of urban invasive plants and their impact on plant diversity using data from 600 urban plant plots (100 m × 100 m). A total of 214 invasive plant species in 55 families and 153 genera were investigated, with herbaceous plants as the leading life type. Tree species Leucaena leucocephala, shrub species Lantana camara and Mimosa bimucronata, and herb species Mimosa bimucronata, Mimosa bimucronata, and Mikania micrantha were the most widespread invasive species. For herb quadrats with different invasive levels, Simpson dominance index, Shannon diversity index, Margalef richness index, and Pielou evenness index all exhibited the same order as severe invasion < moderate invasion < mild invasion. This study revealed the significant effect of mild invasion on urban herb diversity and the evident pattern of herb diversity decreasing trend with increasing invasion level.

AB  - Invasive species threaten crops and ecosystems worldwide. Therefore, we sought to understand the relationship between the geographic distribution of species populations and the characteristics of seeds using new techniques such as seed image analysis, multivariate analysis, and machine learning. This study aimed to characterize Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. seeds from spatially dispersed populations using digital images and analyzed their implications for genetic studies. Seed size and shape descriptors were obtained using image analysis of the five populations. Several analyses were performed including descriptive statistics, principal components, Euclidean distance, Mantel correlation test, and supervised machine learning. This image analysis technique proved to be efficient in detecting biometric differences in L. leucocephala seeds from spatially dispersed populations. This method revealed that spatially dispersed L. leucocephala populations had different biometric seed patterns that can be used in studies of population genetic divergence. We observed that it is possible to identify the origin of the seeds from the biometric characters with 80.4% accuracy (Kappa statistic 0.755) when we applied the decision tree algorithm. Digital imaging analysis associated with machine learning is promising for discriminating forest tree populations, supporting management activities, and studying population genetic divergence. This technique contributes to the understanding of genotype-environment interactions and consequently identifies the ability of an invasive species to spread in a new area, making it possible to track and monitor the flow of seeds between populations and other sites. © 2024, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - Wild edible trees (WETs) play an important role in the diet of many rural communities. Therefore, research on their use and management is important to support both food sovereignty and local conservation of biocultural resources. We evaluated the different uses of WETs by the community of Zacualpan, Colima, in western Mexico, through 32 semi-structured interviews registering the species richness, plant parts consumed, and non-food uses. Additional information was collected on their management, availability, and forms of preparation. We used a cultural salience index to determine the food importance of the WETs mentioned. We registered 33 edible tree species (26 wild, 3 native crops, and 4 exotic crops) that were most commonly consumed as fruits or seeds. WETs were also used for fuel, live fences, timber, handicrafts, medicine, shade, fodder, poles, utensils, construction, tanning, soap, and paper. Pithecellobium dulce had the highest food salience, followed by Spondias purpurea, Leucaena esculenta, Leucaena leucocephala, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Jacaratia mexicana. Salient wild trees were collected in the wild and promoted in agroforestry systems. These trees provided food during the dry season and also had the highest number of additional uses. Promoting the biocultural value of WETs and their sustainable use can favor ecosystem conservation and local food sovereignty. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The productivity of goats in small-scale farming is largely influenced by the availability and affordability of high-quality forages all year round. Grasses commonly used for pastures in tropical regions tend to have low protein levels, which may not be sufficient for optimal production in ruminant animals. Despite potential concerns such as anti-nutritional elements and toxins, the addition of legumes to goat diets could be a beneficial way to address nutritional deficiencies in the diet of goats. This review discussed the beneficial impact of some legumes supplementation (Gliricidia sepium, Sesbania grandiflora, and Leucaena leucocephala) on nutrient intake, digestibility, growth and reproductive performance of goats. Studies have shown that G. sepium supplementation can improve nutrient intake, nutrient digestibility, N retention, and body weight of goats. S. grandiflora supplementation had a beneficial impact on nutrient intake and digestibility, semen quality, and body weight. L. leucocephala supplementation to the goat diets have been reported to improve production of volatile fatty acid and urinary purine derivatives, growth performance, dressing percentage, and overall yield of kid per animal, as well as reduce the incidence of abortion. This suggests that supplementation with high-quality foliage is very beneficial to increase nutrient intake, digestibility, growth and reproductive performance of goats fed low quality grass. © 2011-2025 Journal of Advanced Veterinary Research.

AB  - L-Mimosine is the main active component of the plant Leucaena leucocephala. Due to its metal-chelating mechanism, it interacts with various metabolic pathways in living organisms, making it a potential pharmacological target, although it also leads to toxicity. The present study aimed to investigate the transplacental passage of L-mimosine and its effects on embryofetal development. Pregnant Wistar rats were divided into control groups (CO2; n = 8 or CO3; n = 6, according to experimental design 2 or 3) that received only the vehicle, and groups that received doses of 60 (n = 9), 100 (n = 8), 140 (n = 9), and 240 (n = 7) mg/kg of L-mimosine from gestational day (GD) 6–19. For the transplacental analysis, five rats were used: two as controls and three treated with a dose of 140 mg/kg L-mimosine from GD12 to 14. All the animals received food and water ad libitum. The parameters analyzed were body weight gain; water and food consumption; serum biochemistry; blood cell counts; reproductive indices; and histopathological, visceral and skeletal analyses of the fetuses. In the groups that received doses of 60, 100, and 140 mg/kg, alterations (P < 0.05) in the skeletal development of the fetuses were observed. In the 240 mg/kg group, a decrease (P < 0.05) in total food consumption; a decrease (P < 0.05) in absolute leukocyte and neutrophil counts; alterations (P < 0.05) in the levels of ALT, GGT, and creatinine enzymes; a decrease (P < 0.05) in the relative weight of the thymus along with a loss of the corticomedullary distinction; coalescence of lymphoid follicles in the spleen; and skeletal and visceral alterations and alopecia were observed. L-Mimosine was detected in the amniotic fluid of the rats. These results demonstrate the complex action of L-mimosine, leading to toxic effects on both dams and fetuses, highlighting the risk of exposure to this substance during the perinatal period, which negatively impacts embryo/fetal and neonatal growth and development. © 2024

AB  - Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) conventionally involve highly concentrated sulphuric acid, which typically resulted in the formation of undesirable by-products. Although less corrosive mineral acids have been explored as alternatives, high concentrations are still required. In this study, CNC was successfully isolated from Leucaena leucocephala wood using mild sulphuric acid with acetic acid as protic solvent, and it was further studied with the addition of Lewis acids in the form of multivalent transition metal salts as co-catalyst. Selected divalent and trivalent transition metal salts including (Cr(NO3)3, Fe(NO3)3, Co(NO3)2, and Ni(NO3)2) were investigated. The morphology, chemical structure, particle size, and physicochemical properties of the CNCs were determined. Controlled depolymerization of cellulose was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Rod-like morphology for all CNCs was obtained during the hydrolysis process with the smallest CNC particles found at an average length of 278.1 ± 35.1 nm and a diameter of 13.4 ± 3.0 nm. The results showed that higher valence state metal ions resulted in better cellulose hydrolysis efficiency. In addition, the use of transition metal salt as a co-catalyst improved production efficiency and minimised carbonization of CNC while maintaining desired crystallinity and thermal properties. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Alien species pose a potential threat to biodiversity, necessitating vigilant monitoring to inform effective control strategies and prevent their invasiveness. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of alien species on the richness, horizontal structure, and diversity of the tree–shrub layer within a Cerrado-Pantanal transition region fragment. A floristic census was conducted across a fragment of approximately 3.0 ha, measuring all individuals with an aboveground diameter (DAG) ≥ 5.0 cm. The study assessed the statistical significance of diversity variation in the presence and absence of alien species using the Hutcheson t-test and examined the correlation between the proportion of alien species and various community parameters through Pearson’s correlation. The findings revealed a total of 84 species belonging to 34 families, with a total of 2218 recorded individuals. Notably, eight species (9.52%) were identified as alien, distributed across five families. Among the alien species, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit exhibited the highest importance value. However, the analysis indicated that the presence of alien species did not yield a significant variation in diversity, as demonstrated by the applied test with a 5.0% probability level, at both the plot and community levels. Moreover, the correlation analysis indicated that the community variables exhibited a low association with the proportion of individuals belonging to alien species. Specifically, the correlation decreased in the following order: Shannon–Weaver Diversity Index, density of native species, basal area of native species, and richness of native species. The observed low correlation coefficients (r) and nonsignificant p-values (p < 0.05) suggested that the presence of alien species did not exert a significant influence on the richness, structure, and diversity of the tree–shrub layer within the studied fragment. This outcome was likely facilitated by the absence of dominant populations of alien species. Thus, the study concludes that, at least within this specific context, alien species do not exert a significant influence on the assessed community parameters. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Botanical Society of Sao Paulo 2024.

TI  - Enhancing bioenergy and feed production in Southern Thailand: An approach through Leucaena cultivation and hydrothermal carbonization
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207279829&doi=10.1016%2fj.renene.2024.121673&partnerID=40&md5=7da7ff7ddf2ee752145ef7a6cf51d4e9
AB  - This study addresses sustainability challenges in Southern Thailand, particularly the scarcity of biomass fuel and animal feed. It investigates the integration of Leucaena leucocephala cultivation with hydrothermal carbonization. The research compares the biomass yield and economic feasibility of growing Leucaena as a sole crop versus intercropping it with Para rubber trees. Sole cropping Leucaena produces higher biomass yields and is more economically viable. The wood stem of Leucaena is competitive with other biomass fuels used in local power plants, while its leaves, with over 14 % protein content, meet local animal feed market standards. Additionally, branches, which constitute 15.15 %–30.58 % of the total biomass, are usually left as residue but can be used for hydrochar production. The study examines the effects of temperature (235 °C and 265 °C) and retention time (1, 2, and 3 h) on hydrochar properties. Optimal condition (265 °C for 1 h) produces hydrochar with high heating value and energy yield. Using these branches for hydrochar can significantly boost total revenue, with hydrochar contributing 54.9 % to overall revenue (4522.00 USD/ha). Integrating Leucaena cultivation with hydrothermal carbonization offers a sustainable solution, enhancing revenue, supporting local energy and feed needs, and promoting environmental sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala L.) is a leguminous species often referred to as the “miracle tree,” it provides numerous ecosystem services and exhibits robust ecological characteristics. However, the infection caused by phytopathogenic fungi is poorly understood in Subabul. Therefore, this study provides comprehensive insights into the molecular and genomic characteristics of Fusarium falciforme, the causal agent of wilt disease in Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala). Pathogen isolation from infected samples, followed by morpho-molecular characterization through DNA sequencing of key markers (ITS, LSU, TEF1α) and phylogenetic analysis, confirmed the identity of F. falciforme. Host range analysis demonstrated the pathogen's ability to infect additional leguminous crops, including chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and soybean (Glycine max). A complete genome assembly revealed a genome size of 59.19 Mb, comprising 18,853 protein-coding genes. Comparative genomic analysis elucidated evolutionary relationships with other Fusarium species, while functional annotation identified critical virulence factors, such as polyketide synthases, ABC transporters, and secretory proteins, which facilitate host tissue invasion. These findings enhance the understanding of F. falciforme pathogenicity, enabling improved diagnostic tools and management strategies for controlling wilt disease in Subabul and related legumes. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In a preliminary in vitro study, leaves of Acacia nilotica, Prosopis juliflora, Cajanus cajan, Leucaena leucocephala and seed kernel of Mangifera indica were identified as potential candidates in mitigating ruminal methane (CH4) production. The objective of the current study was to investigate the combination efficiency of these unconventional feeds with concentrate mix (CM) or Chloris gayana grass in CH4 reduction. Two feed combinations in different proportions were incubated in vitro with buffered rumen fluid at Hohenheim Gas test. In combination 1, C. gayana and CM were included as basal substrates, while in combination 2, A. nilotica, P. juliflora, C. cajan, L. leucocephala or M. indica seed kernel were included as CH4 reducing supplements at different proportions. The CH4 reducing potentials of feed combinations were presented as the ratio of CH4 to net gas production and expressed as percentage (pCH4). The pCH4 for CM and C. gayana was 16.7% and 16.9%, respectively, while it ranged from 3.18% in A. nilotica to 13.1% in C. cajan. The pCH4 was reduced (p < 0.05) from 14.6% to 9.39% when A. nilotica was combined with CM. In combination of L. leucocephala or C. cajan with CM, the pCH4 (p < 0.05) was reduced from 16.5% and 16.6% with the lowest proportion to 15.1% and 15.2% with the highest inclusion rate respectively. The combination of C. gayana with L. leucocephala or C. cajan reduced (p < 0.05) the pCH4 from 16.3% and 16.4% to 15.1% and 14.9% respectively. The pCH4 was reduced (p < 0.05) from 13.4% to 7.60% when A. nilotica was combined with C. gayana. Estimated digestible organic matter (dOM) and metabolizable energy (ME) increased (p < 0.05) with increasing proportions of M. indica seed kernel with CM or C. gayana. In conclusion, the combination of the basal substrates with unconventional supplements resulted in CH4 reduction without affecting the dOM and ME at lower inclusion rates. Animal-based experiments await to validate in vitro findings. © 2024 The Author(s). Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Cultivation of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) is a viable option for sustaining the increasing demand for herbal medicines but also for preventing the genetic erosion of MAPs in natural habitats. The increasing demand is an opportunity to encourage the cultivation of MAPs. Since, agroforestry is one of the most potential ways for the cultivation of MAPs. And there have been sporadic reports on the impact of MAPs cultivated in agroforestry. Thus, our main objectives were to uncover the status of MAPs and their cultivation via. agroforestry systems in India and also to highlight the impact on yield-related attributes and phytochemical properties of MAPs when cultivated in agroforestry systems. Despite the studies so far, there is need to comprehend the variation in the yield and chemical constituent of the MAPs grown under agroforestry. It is often reiterated that institutionalised efforts can upscale MAPs cultivation and thus we have attempted to examine the implication of government and institutional imperatives in MAPs cultivation in India. Finally, we have indicated the way forward for MAPs cultivation under agroforestry. © 2024, Indian journals. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hot arid zones represent vital reservoirs of unique species and ecosystems, holding significant importance for biodiversity. This study aimed to explore the plant diversity associated with tree plantations in urban ecosystems under hyper-arid climatic conditions in the Sahara Desert of Algeria. In May 2022, 30 quadrats measuring 1 m2 each were established at the base of Phoenix dactylifera, Leucaena leucocephala, and Tamarix aphylla, corresponding to the dominant tree species in each of three plantations. In each quadrat, the plant quantitative inventory was conducted to measure plant diversity and similarity among the studied plantations. Based on this, we assessed the plant functional traits and rarity/abundance status of the flora. The findings revealed a diverse flora associated with the studied plantations, comprising 29 plant species grouped into 27 genera and 12 families. Notably, Poaceae (accounting for 30.8% of the flora), Asteraceae (25.0%), and Zygophyllaceae (21.6%) were well-represented. With an overall density of approximately 555 individuals/m2, Zygophyllum album (120 individuals/m2) and Polypogon monspeliensis (87 individuals/m2) emerged as the most abundant species. Functional trait analysis underscored the pivotal role of therophytes (constituting over 50.0% of the flora) and anemochorous species (33.0%–62.5%). Phytogeographic analysis emphasized the prevalence of the Saharo-Arabic element (constituting over 31.0% of the flora) and the Mediterranean Saharo-Arabic element (9.5%–21.5%). The Cosmopolitan element thrived under disturbance factors, recording percentages from 13.0% to 20.0% of the plant community. The rarity/abundance status of the flora emphasized the significance of rare, common, and very common species in the studied plantations. These findings could provide fundamental data for the effective control and management of biodiversity in hot hyper-arid urban ecosystems. © Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Afforestation is an effective approach for restoring degraded ecological functions in the dry-hot valleys of southwest China. Afforestation can affect soil carbon and nitrogen storage; however, how it affects soil P fractions, and their driving factors. is poorly understood in this region. To address these questions, we conducted a field study of Leucaena leucocephala plantations at three different stand age sites (3, 10, and 20 years) and an adjacent natural shrub-grass community control site to investigate changes in soil total phosphorus (Pt), Pi (inorganic phosphorus), Po (organic phosphorus), and phosphorus (P) fractions and their driving factors. Soil Pt, Po, labile P, and moderately labile P significantly increased in the Leucaena leucocephala plantation compared with the natural shrub grass site, and the Leucaena leucocephala plantation increased soil Pt content by significantly increasing soil Po. Soil Pt, Po, Pi, labile P, moderately labile P and non-labile P were not significantly different among the different stages of the Leucaena leucocephala plantation, and soil Pt and its fractions were all significantly higher in the middle-age forest stage of the Leucaena leucocephala plantation. These results indicate that Leucaena leucocephala plantations increased the soil P transformation ability, and soil Po played a critical role in sustaining soil P availability. The middle-age forest stage of Leucaena leucocephala plantations had the best conditions for P stocks and P conversion capacity. The abundance of actinomycetes and fungi showed significant positive relationships with soil Pi fractions (NaHCO3-Pi, NaOH-Pi, and NaOHu.s.-Pi); soil Pt and moderately labile P were significantly and directly influenced by fungal abundance. Soil organic carbon (SOC), NH4+-N, and NO3−-N showed significant and positive relationships with the soil Pi fractions (NaHCO3-Pi, NaHCO3-Po, and HCl-Po). SOC and NO3−-N were the key drivers of soil Pt, labile P, moderately labile P and non-labile fractions. These results indicate that abiotic and biotic factors differently affected the soil P fractions and Pt in Leucaena leucocephala plantations in the dry-hot valley. © 2024 by the authors.

TI  - Root-associated functional microbiome endemism facilitates heavy metal resilience and nutrient poor adaptation in native plants under serpentine driven edaphic challenges
PY  - 2025

AB  - Serpentine soils are characterized by high concentrations of heavy metals (HMs) and limited essential nutrients with remarkable endemic plant diversity, yet the mechanisms enabling plant adaptation to thrive in such harsh environments remain largely unknown. Full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, coupled with physiological and functional assays, was used to explore root-associated bacterial community composition and their metabolic and ecological functions. The results revealed that serpentine plant species exhibited significantly higher metal transfer factor values compared to non-serpentine plant species, particularly evident in Bidens pilosa, Miscanthus floridulus, and Leucaena leucocephala. The serpentine root-associated microbes showed a higher utilization of carboxylic acid, whereas carbohydrate utilization was higher in the non-serpentine site. Zymomonas mobilis and Flavabacterium sp. exhibited high resistance to heavy metal concentrations, showing greater adaptability, while, Staphylococcus carnosus showed sensitivity to HMs, showing limited adaptability. Moreover, Ni, Cr, and Co resistance genes were found, while nitrogen and phosphorous metabolism genes were less abundant in the serpentine site compared to the non-serpentine site. Furthermore, Flavobacterium sp. had a strong positive relationship with Cd and Cu, Zymomonas mobilis with Ni, and Cr, Streptomyces sp. with Co, and Staphylococcus carnosus with N and P cycling. These findings underscore critical role of root-associated bacterial communities and distinctive soil conditions of serpentine habitats in fostering ecological adaptation of native plant species to the challenges posed by HMs and nutrient deficiencies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Cattle intensification based on silvopastoral systems with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit as a strategy to increase production and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the Caribbean region of Colombia

AB  - Different cattle production interventions have been proposed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase animal productivity, but few studies have identified their real potential under grazing conditions and at the whole system level. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of silvopastoral systems (SPS) with Leucaena leucocephala on total GHG emissions, emission intensity, GHG balance and cattle productivity in a series of production scenarios in northern Colombia. A life cycle analysis (LCA) approach was used to evaluate one baseline system (BL) based on pastures and four SPS intervention scenarios. For this analysis, the emissions from enteric fermentation and manure were determined in situ. Methane emissions from enteric fermentation were 9.7% lower in the SPS with leucaena than in BL systems (p = 0.0369). Emission factors for manure were higher in the BL systems (p < 0.05) as were emission intensities to produce one kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) and one kg of live weight gain (LWG). For animal production and GHG balance, it was found that the inclusion of leucaena increased animal production up to four times compared to the BL system and mitigated GHG emissions per hectare up to 86% due to carbon sequestration. In conclusion, leucaena SPSs are an alternative to mitigate climate change under grazing conditions, as they reduce GHG emissions and increase animal productivity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

TI  - Bio-phenols production via hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived guaiacol and bio-oil over high water-tolerant NiMo/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalysts
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211238047&doi=10.1016%2fj.clet.2024.100858&partnerID=40&md5=b360287306d8ede16d85bdd3e669d2af
AB  - Transformation of some oxygenated compounds in bio-oil derived from biomass pyrolysis via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) generally improves its quality and potentially produces bio-based chemicals. Although alumina (Al₂O₃) supported catalysts are normally applied for HDO, they have certain limitations, such as acidity and high susceptibility to water, which need to be improved. In this research, an Al2O3-incorporated zirconia (ZrO2) composite (AZ) was prepared as a support of nickel (Ni)-molybdenum (Mo) catalysts used for HDO of guaiacol (GUA) and real bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala trunks to produce phenols. In the absence of water, the NiMo catalyst supported on AZ at 1/1 Al2O3/ZrO2 molar ratio [NiMo/AZ(1/1)] having higher reducibility with a greater number of weak-medium acid sites provided >98% GUA conversion with 87% selectivity to phenols. In the presence of water, the NiMo/AZ(1/1) catalyst maintained its catalytic activity, whereas NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst showed its deactivation to obtain the lowering GUA conversion (27.1% reduction). The FESEM and 27Al-NMR analyses revealed that the addition of ZrO2 improved the water tolerance of the catalyst by protecting the Al2O3 structure and preventing the transformation of Lewis acid-related tetrahedral Al to octahedral Al. Moreover, the NiMo/AZ(1/1) catalyst exhibited the highest HDO activity for real bio-oil without solvents, achieving a maximum oil yield of 25.2 wt% with 75.6% selectivity to phenols and the lowest coke formation. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Some problems in producing good quality clove seeds were the seed's slow growth and the absence of technology to accelerate its growth. Therefore, we performed the research to get one natural Plant Growth Regulator and its concentration potential to enhance clove seed growth. The study was arranged in a completely randomized design, with two factors and four replications. The first factor was five kinds of natural plant growth regulators (PGRs): (1) Leucaena leucocephala leaf extract (auxin source) + coconut water (Cytokinin), (2) Leucaena leucocephala seedling extract (auxin source) + coconut water, (3) gliricidia shoot extract + coconut water and (4) sprouted onion bulb extract (Eleutherine bulbosa) + coconut water. The second factor was the concentration of PGRs: (1) control (no PGRs), (2) 2.5 ml l−1, (3) 5.0 ml l−1, (4) 10 ml l−1, and (5) 20 ml l−1. Parameters observed were plant growth (plant height, leaf number, leaf length, leaf width, and stem diameter), the chlorophyll content of leaves, and the auxin and cytokinin content of each extract. Clove seedlings' growth was observed until four months old. PGRs from the extract of sprouted onion (Eleutherine bulbosa) and Gliricidia shoots could be developed due to their high auxin content, which can boost clove seed growth at the concentration of 10 ml l−1. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India 2024.

TI  - Novel Recycling, Defibrillation, and Delignification Methods for Isolating α-Cellulose from Different Lignocellulosic Precursors for the Eco-Friendly Fiber Industry
PY  - 2024

AB  - Alpha-cellulose, a unique, natural, and essential polymer for the fiber industry, was isolated in an ecofriendly manner using eleven novel systems comprising recycling, defibrillation, and delignification of prosenchyma cells (vessels and fibers) of ten lignocellulosic resources. Seven hardwood species were selected, namely Conocorpus erectus, Leucaena leucocephala, Simmondsia chinensis, Azadirachta indica, Moringa perigrina, Calotropis procera, and Ceiba pentandra. Moreover, three recycled cellulosic wastes were chosen due to their high levels of accumulation annually in the fibrous wastes of Saudi Arabia, namely recycled writing papers (RWPs), recycled newspapers (RNPs), and recycled cardboard (RC). Each of the parent samples and the resultant alpha-cellulose was characterized physically, chemically, and anatomically. The properties examined differed significantly among the ten resources studied, and their mean values lies within the cited ranges. Among the seven tree species, L. leucocephala was the best cellulosic precursor due to its higher fiber yield (55.46%) and holocellulose content (70.82%) with the lowest content of Klasson lignin (18.86%). Moreover, RWP was the best α-cellulose precursor, exhibiting the highest holocellulose (87%) and the lowest lignin (2%) content. Despite the high content of ash and other additives accompanied with the three lignocellulosic wastes that were added upon fabrication to enhance their quality (10%, 11%, and 14.52% for RWP, RNP, and RC, respectively), they can be considered as an inexhaustible treasure source for cellulose production due to the ease and efficiency of discarding their ash minerals using the novel CaCO3-elimination process along with the other innovative techniques. Besides its main role for adjusting the pH of the delignification process, citric acid serves as an effective and environmentally friendly additive enhancing lignin breakdown while preserving cellulose integrity. Comparing the thermal behavior of the ten cellulosic resources, C. procera and C. pentandra exhibited the highest moisture content and void volume as well as having the lowest specific gravity, crystallinity index, and holocellulose content and were found to yield the highest mass loss during their thermal degradation based on thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis in an inert atmosphere. However, the other resources used were found to yield lower mass losses. The obtained results indicate that using the innovative procedures of recycling, defibrillation, and delignification did not alter or distort either the yield or structure of the isolated α-cellulose. This is a clear indicator of their high efficiency for isolating cellulose from lignocellulosic precursors. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - The seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (LL), a legume tree native to Mexico, are traditionally harvested and utilized as food ingredients in regional dishes. In this study, the usefulness of LL biomass was investigated and processed in flours using the wholegrain seed (WS) and pods for polyphenols identification, whereas the cotyledon (CT) for protein concentrates functional characterization was used. The WS flour exhibited carbohydrates as the main macronutrient, followed by proteins (30.59%). Water-extracted polyphenols from pods flour (544.29 mg/L) were higher compared to the WS flour (165.85 mg/L). The predominant polyphenols in all samples were flavonols, specifically catechins. Although, in comparison to the mixtures of methanol–water (315.14 mg/L) and ethanol–water (471.22 mg/L), pods had about threefold polyphenols content than WS flours extracts. Protein fractionation in CT was higher than in WS flour, with globulins being the most abundant fraction in both materials (44.73 and 55.2%, respectively). Structural analyzes indicated a higher presence of structural elements in globulins, evident in FTIR spectra and SDS-PAGE analysis. Globulins displayed bands around 50, 37, and 22 kDa, while glutelins exhibited a unique band at 50 kDa. Globulins also demonstrated a higher essential amino acid content. The functional properties of globulins and glutelins were pH-dependent. Globulins solubility (72.53%), emulsifying (35.13%), foaming (138.66%), water holding (3.17 g/g), and oil absorption (1.20 g/g) capacities were higher compared to glutelins (62.42%, 31.69%, 66.70%, 2.86 g/g, and 0.52 g/g, respectively). These findings suggest that LL biomass holds potential as a sustainable source of natural ingredients for food development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences 2024.

TI  - The Restoration of Degraded Landscapes along the Urban–Rural Gradient of Lubumbashi City (Democratic Republic of the Congo) by Acacia auriculiformis Plantations: Their Spatial Dynamics and Impact on Plant Diversity
PY  - 2024

AB  - This study examines the spatio-temporal dynamics of Acacia auriculiformis in Lubumbashi city, southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the context of rapid urbanization following the liberalization of the mining sector. The city has experienced significant demographic growth and unplanned spatial expansion, resulting in a decrease in vegetation cover. The introduction and proliferation of A. auriculiformis, an exotic tree species, have occurred without strategic planning or monitoring. Utilizing digitized remote sensing imagery from 2006, 2014, and 2021, we quantified the expansion of A. auriculiformis along the urban–rural gradient. Additionally, a floristic inventory conducted in 2021 provided insights into tree diversity within A. auriculiformis plantations. Our findings indicate a substantial increase in the number and area of A. auriculiformis patches, predominantly in urban zones. However, the patch values, highest in 2006, were shown to decline by 2021, especially in urban areas. The floristic inventory identified 39 tree species within A. auriculiformis plantations, including predominant species such as Albizia lebbeck, Albizia alba, and Leucaena leucocephala. Notably, 20 of these species are exotic, with half being invasive. In contrast, the 19 indigenous species were primarily found in peri-urban areas. While a greater number of tree species were observed in urban zones, larger average diameters were recorded in peri-urban zones. The persistence and expansion of A. auriculiformis in a landscape characterized by declining tree cover suggest its potential sustainability in this setting. However, A. auriculiformis plantations have facilitated the establishment of predominantly exotic and potentially invasive species. These findings highlight the need for the strategic management of A. auriculiformis and associated exotic flora to mitigate their spread and to consider their role in the restoration of degraded lands. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This article presents an energy-efficient biochar kiln that produces biochar from agricultural crop residues. The kiln is designed to be easy to operate and has minimal requirements for special operations. It works by heating biomass in a combustion chamber using recirculated pyrogas. The study optimized the process parameters and economics of producing biochar from wheat straw using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Central Composite Design (CCD). The sustainable pyrolyzer had a thermal efficiency of 43.69%, with steady-state operation at 517.68 ± 98.18 °C. It produced an average of 54.57 ± 1.86 kg of biochar per batch, using 36.96 ± 3.66 kg of subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) as fuel and 179.61 ± 2.87 kg of wheat straw as feedstock. Subabul is chosen as a fuel due to its rapid growth, high calorific value, low moisture content, efficient combustion, and minimal smoke emission. The thermogravimetric index (TGI) and calorific value of WSB were 7.14 and 25.91 ± 0.74 MJ/kg, respectively. The benefit–cost ratio and payback period were 2.27 ± 0.16 and 4.92 ± 0.44 months, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) have been identified as the primary contaminants in soil, posing potential health threats. This study aimed to examine the effects of applying a nitrogen fertilizer and a fungal agent Trichoderma harzianum J2 (nitrogen alone, fungi alone, and combined use) on the phytoremediation of soils co-contaminated with Pb and Cd. The growth of Leucaena leucocephala was monitored in the seedling, differentiation, and maturity stages to fully comprehend the remediation mechanisms. In the maturity stage, the biomass of L. leucocephala significantly increased by 18% and 29% under nitrogen-alone (NCK+) and fungal agent-alone treatments (J2), respectively, compared with the control in contaminated soil (CK+). The remediation factors of Pb and Cd with NCK+ treatment significantly increased by 50% and 125%, respectively, while those with J2 treatment increased by 73% and 145%, respectively. The partial least squares path model suggested that the nitrogen-related soil properties were prominent factors affecting phytoextraction compared with biotic factors (microbial diversity and plant growth). This model explained 2.56 of the variation in Cd concentration under J2 treatment, and 2.97 and 2.82 of the variation in Pb concentration under NCK+ and J2 treatments, respectively. The redundancy analysis showed that the samples under NCK+ and J2 treatments were clustered similarly in all growth stages. Also, Chytridiomycota, Mucoromucota, and Ciliophora were the key bioindicators for coping with heavy metals. Overall, a similar remediation mechanism allowed T. harzianum J2 to replace the nitrogen fertilizer to avoid secondary pollution. In addition, their combined use further increased the remediation efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Effects of invasive species on the ecosystem services of a tropical insular protected area in Brazil
PY  - 2025
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217138288&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoser.2025.101703&partnerID=40&md5=489e7daacc90bbbff807bf0f00f5cc40
AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) represent a global problem for biodiversity conservation, and a growing concern involving IAS is related to their impacts on ecosystem services. However, their effects on ecosystem services in insular ecosystems are poorly known, which are particularly relevant and concerning due to the fragility and limited resources in these areas for several organisms, including humans. Therefore, the present study aimed to inventory ecosystem services and assess the impact of IAS on these services and the terrestrial ecosystems of the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, Brazil, which is a tropical protected area. The approach was applied to four IAS: black rat (Rattus rattus), domestic cat (Felis catus), tegu lizard (Salvator merianae), and lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala). A worksheet for ecosystem services was created, using the subdivisions defined in the zoning of the protected areas of Fernando de Noronha as management units, namely Urban Area, Beach Area, Green Area, Primitive Area, and Secondary Island. Additionally, two quantitative approaches were combined: the INvasive Species Effects Assessment Tool (INSEAT) to assess the positive and negative effects of IAS on ecosystem services, based on a questionnaire applied to experts; and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software to estimate the risk of impacts from IAS. In total, 21 ecosystem services, 41 benefits, and 10 groups of benefitting social actors were identified in Fernando de Noronha. In general, all IAS presented risks to the ecosystem services of Fernando de Noronha, especially F. catus and R. rattus. According to the impact index, the IAS caused negative effects to most ecosystem services considered, but the effects were more pronounced on the provisioning and cultural ecosystem service groups. On the other hand, a positive effect was found for L. leucocephala on regulating and maintenance services, although with a low impact index. With the exception of the Urban Area, all management units showed a high risk of being impacted by IAS, especially the Primitive Area. The main social actors impacted by the IAS were the local community, the floating population, and the Administration. The present study is the first to combine these quantitative techniques (INSEAT and InVEST) and represents a set of guidelines for ecosystem-based management to mitigate the impact of IAS, aiming at the maintenance and improvement of ecosystem services within protected areas in insular environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Preliminary investigation on the effect of Leucaena leucocephala leaves supernatant on the microalgae lipid content Botryococcus braunii
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184249466&doi=10.1007%2fs13762-023-05385-8&partnerID=40&md5=cc4b9dce32016d0b481538dfcb6ec1d7
AB  - Botryococcus braunii is recognized as one of the most important microalgae species due to its high lipid content that may reach 75% of its dry weight. This amount is relatively higher than that in other microalgae species, thus potentially exploitable for biofuel production. Culture media support the growth of this microalga to sustain its culture production. Leucaena leaves supernatant (LLS) has potential as natural growth culture supplement. The present study aims to analyse the best concentration of LLS with optimum light intensity as supplement for microalgae growth by using an experimental method. This study consisted of four treatments with three replications during 14 days of experiment or one cycle of growth phase of B. braunii. The concentrations of LLS on the treatment were 2.5, 7.5 and 12.5%. The determination of light intensity for cultivation was based on the preliminary test, with 2500, 5000 and 7500 Lux. The best growth-producing light intensity was used in the main experiment. The initial density of microalgae was 100,000 cells/mL under environmental conditions of 26 °C, pH of 7.85, salinity of 30 ppt and photoperiod of 12/12 h light/dark cycle. The lipid test was carried out using Soxhlet method. The results of the study showed that LLS at 12.5% produced the highest lipid content (41.39%), while lower lipid content was found at 7.5, 2.5 and 0% of LLS (control) (37.23, 30.61 and 23.73%, respectively). © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University 2024.

TI  - Chemical composition, in vitro rumen profile and methane emission of fermented and non-fermented grass-legume mixtures
PY  - 2025

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the impact of several grass-legume mixtures, either fermented or non-fermented, on chemical composition, in vitro rumen fermentation profiles, and gas and methane production kinetics. Seven tropical leguminous plants were investigated, i.e., Indigofera zollingeriana, Calliandra calothyrsus, Clitoria ternatea, Centrosema pubescens, Leucaena leucocephala, Bauhinia purpurea, and Arachis pintoi. Each legume was combined with Pennisetum purpureum (elephant grass) in a 50:50 ratio, prepared in both fresh (non-fermented) and fermented (silage) forms. A completely randomized factorial design was employed, with legume type as the primary factor and fermentation status (non-fermented vs fermented) as the secondary factor (N = 5 replicates per treatment). Results revealed that legume type significantly influenced (P<0.05) In Vitro Dry Matter Digestibility (IVDMD) and In Vitro Organic Matter Digestibility (IVOMD), with I. zollingeriana demonstrating the highest digestibility values. A significant interaction between fermentation and legume type was observed in reducing methane gas production (P<0.05). Both legume inclusion and fermentation effectively lowered methane emissions (P<0.05), with the lowest levels recorded for C. calothyrsus and B. purpurea. The study concluded that incorporating tropical legumes, in both fermented and non-fermented forms, into elephant grass can improve digestibility and mitigate methane emissions, with Indigofera and Calliandra showing the most promising results, respectively. © 2025, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Background: This study compares seed germination and seedling growth parameters of native Senegalia catechu with its closely related invasive Leucaena leucocephala in Nepal. For the comparison of seed germination percentage (GP), mean germination time (MGT), and Timson’s index (TI), the seeds of both species were incubated under different light (photoperiod and dark), temperatures (30/20ºC and 25/15ºC) and water stress conditions (−0.1, −0.25, −0.5, −0.75, and −1 MPa). The seedling emergence from different soil depths was also evaluated. The relative growth rate (RGR), root mass fraction (RMF), stem mass fraction, leaf mass fraction (LMF), and root-to-shoot ratio (RSR) of seedlings were also measured. Results: The seed length and mass of invasive L. leucocephala were higher than that of native S. catechu. The GP of S. catechu was higher at high temperature and photoperiod comparing to L. leucocephala. There was no difference in GP between two species under other light and temperature conditions. The MGT of S. catechu was shorter than that of L. leucocephala at both temperatures. Senegalia catechu exhibited higher TI than L. leucocephala, particularly at high temperatures. Water stress above −0.5 MPa reduced the GP and TI of both species and it was more pronounced in S. catechu than L. leucocephala. The seedling emergence percentage of L. leucocephala was higher than that of S. catechu. Both species exhibited comparable RGR and biomass allocations (RMF, LMF, and RSR). However, L. leucocephala had always greater values of shoot height, root length, leaf number and seedling biomass compared to S. catechu. Conclusions: Larger seeds may not always lead to higher seed GP. Some, but not all, seed germination and seedling growth traits can be useful to characterize invasive alien plant species. Invasiveness of L. leucocephala could be attributed to relatively high tolerance of seed germination to water stress, capacity to germinate from deeper soil, and larger seedling size compared to the confamilial native species. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in plant-based diets, particularly legumes, as a sustainable and healthy dietary choice. This study breaks new ground by investigating the effects of simulated gastrointestinal digestion on green (Leucaena leucocephala) and pigmented (Leucaena esculenta) guaje proteins. We evaluated the antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties of ultrafiltered fractions resulting from digestion in a macrophage model. Both fractions showed promising potential as radical scavengers. The fraction <5 kDa from pigmented guaje, even at the lowest doses tested, significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, and demonstrated an immunomodulatory effect by reducing the levels of ROS and NO. These findings suggest that green and pigmented guaje could be a valuable source of bioactive peptides, potentially used as a coadjutant for treating and preventing oxidative stress and inflammation-associated non-communicable diseases through the utilization of underutilized legumes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Co-Inoculation of Phosphate-Solubilizing Bacteria and Rhizobia Increases Phosphorus Availability and Promotes the Development of Forage Legumes
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210288286&doi=10.3390%2fagronomy14112493&partnerID=40&md5=0be61e45a39e14931da8ce772eb53d6c
AB  - Tropical grassland soils, especially those with alkaline properties, often exhibit limited phosphorus availability due to its precipitation in insoluble forms. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and rhizobia have demonstrated their potential to enhance the availability of this nutrient and promote the growth of forage legumes. This study, conducted under controlled conditions in a mesh house, evaluated the effect of co-inoculation with PSB, including Micrococcus sp. Sfcm-14-01, Agrobacterium sp. Sfl-043-09, and Enterobacter sp. Sfcm-014-02 and Sfcm-054-06, along with rhizobia (Ensifer terangae R1-012-02 and Bradyrhizobium glycinis Rcm-025-01), under different levels of phosphorus fertilization on the legumes Leucaena leucocephala and Centrosema macrocarpum. The results indicate significant increases in various growth parameters, such as chlorophyll levels (SPAD), biomass (dry weight of roots and aerial parts) (mg), the foliar phosphorus concentration (ppm), and the concentration of available phosphorus in the soil, particularly under low-phosphorus fertilization conditions. The highest level of available phosphorus in the soil was achieved with 75% of the recommended fertilization dose, resulting in concentrations of 13.73 ppm for L. leucocephala and 7.69 ppm for C. macrocarpum, representing increases in phosphorus availability of 170.81% and 240.27%, respectively, compared with no fertilization or inoculation. These findings suggest that the co-inoculation of PSB and native rhizobia is a promising strategy to enhance the biomass productivity and mineral content of forage in tropical grazing systems, especially under phosphorus-limited conditions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background and Objective: Endophytic Streptomyces globisporus LL096, a bacterial strain isolated from the roots of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, has been the subject of limited research, highlighting a significant knowledge gap regarding its potential applications in secondary metabolite production. The primary objectives of this study were to isolate and characterize the major bioactive compounds produced by S. globisporus LL096 and to evaluate their antibacterial and anticancer activities. Materials and Methods: The bioactive compounds produced by S. globisporus LL096 were isolated and purified using a combination of chromatographic techniques, including column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The chemical structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). The purified compounds were identified as soyasapogenol A (compound 1) and soyasapogenol B (compound 2). Subsequently, the antibacterial and anticancer activities of soyasapogenol A and soyasapogenol B were evaluated. Treatment effects were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, considering p<0.05 as statistically significant. Results: Soyasapogenol A and B exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus TISTR885, Staphylococcus epidermidis TISTR518, Bacillus cereus TISTR687 and Bacillus subtilis TISTR008. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds against these bacterial strains ranged from 128 to 256 µg/mL. The compounds demonstrated significant cytotoxicity against these cancer cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 321.90 to 369.90 µg/mL for HeLa, 434.03 to 475.42 µg/mL for HepG2 and 282.96 to 362.17 µg/mL for MDA-MB-231 cells. However, moderate cytotoxicity against the non-cancerous Vero cell line was also observed, with IC50 values ranging from 729.81 to 811.14 µg/mL. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that Streptomyces globisporus strain LL096 produces bioactive compounds, including soyasapogenol A and B, which exhibit antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and demonstrate cytotoxic effects against various human cancer cell lines. © 2025 Thongchai Taechowisan et al.

AB  - Global demand for milk is increasing with population growth, but industry ethics are a concern due to profit-driven practices. In this work, a surface-active electrode composite was synthesized using a surface-modified Corning glass electrode (TiO2-LL@AgNps) coated with phytofabricated silver nanoparticles from Leucaena leucocephala leaf extracts. To investigate the structural properties of the phytofabricated silver nanoparticles, various characterization techniques were used, including scanning and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-visible, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The findings revealed the synthesis of crystalline, spherical silver nanoparticles with an average size of 11.93 nm and a maximum absorption of 436 nm. This surface-modified electrode was made from synthesized silver nanoparticles and used for the electrochemical detection of urea in both artificial samples and real milk. The detection was based on the measurement of the induced potential resulting from the surface interaction between urea and the developed electrode. The composite was successfully used for urea detection. The sensing parameters, including the sensing range (5.0×10-6 M to 25.0×10-6 M), sensitivity (5.0 mV μM-1 cm-2), and detection limit (2.48× 10-6 M). The developed electrode exhibited a response time of 5 min and maintained stability for 28 days. This environmentally friendly sensor is comparable to the spectroscopic approach and shows minimal interference from other substances present in milk. © 2024 Author(s).

AB  - Live yeast cultures have been a popular additive in ruminant feeds to improve fermentation efficiency, rumen, and intestinal health. However, very little is known about inactive yeast culture and hydrolysable yeast cells on nutrient digestibility in ruminants. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effects of a combined yeast culture and enzymatically hydrolysed yeast (YC+EHY) on in vitro dry matter and nutrient digestibility. Seven chemically contrasting substrates, including the leaves and petiole of forage plants (Trichanthera gigantea, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Brachiaria arrecta), agriculture by-products (soybean meal and rice hulls), and a commercial concentrate feed, were incubated in vitro with and without YC+EHY to determine dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), and acid detergent fibre (ADF) digestibility after 24 and 48 h of incubation. A second experiment evaluated in vitro CP degradability by incubating substrates for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h with and without YC+EHY. Incubation with YC+EHY reduced 24 h DM and CP digestibility in soybean meal and G. sepium by 16.2% and 38.5%, respectively. Conversely, the ADF digestibility of B. arrecta incubated with YC+EHY increased by 32%. In vitro ruminal DM and nutrient digestibility were unaffected by YC+EHY after 48 h of incubation. The rate of CP degradability in the commercial concentrate and rice hull inoculated with YC+EHY increased sharply between 16 and 24 h post-incubation and generally plateaued afterwards. Similarly, YC+EHY significantly increased CP degradability in L. leucocephala after 8 and 16 h of incubation. The 16 h CP degradation in T. gigantea without YC+EHY was significantly higher. It was therefore concluded that YC+EHY has potential to improve ruminal ADF digestibility and modify ruminal CP degradation dependent on the type of substrate. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - One of the major challenges in preventing glaucoma progression is patient compliance with medication regimens. Since conventional ophthalmic dosage forms have numerous limitations, researchers have been intensively working on developing polymers-based delivery systems for glaucoma drugs. Specifically, research and development efforts have increased using polysaccharide polymers such as sodium alginate, cellulose, β-cyclodextrin, hyaluronic acid, chitosan, pectin, gellan gum, galactomannans for sustained release to the eye to overcome treatment challenges, showing promise in improving drug release and delivery, patient experience, and treatment compliance. In the recent past, multiple research groups have successfully designed sustained drug delivery systems, promoting the efficacy as well as the feasibility of glaucoma drugs with single/combinations of polysaccharides to eliminate the drawbacks associated with the glaucoma treatment. Naturally available polysaccharides, when used as drug vehicles can increase the retention time of eye drops on the ocular surface, leading to improved drug absorption and bioavailability. Additionally, some polysaccharides can form gels or matrices that can release drugs slowly over time, providing sustained drug delivery and reducing the need for frequent dosing. Thus, this review aims to provide an overview of the pre-clinical and clinical studies of polysaccharide polymers applied for glaucoma treatment along with their therapeutic outcomes. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli is a serious threat to human and animal health, with antimicrobial drug resistance contributing to the problem. Alternative mechanisms of prevention and treatment of E. coli-induced diarrhoea include those targeting biofilm production and quorum sensing, properties that have been associated with some investigated plant extracts. Plants were selected from various genera, including Vachellia, Senegalia, Morus, Leucaena, Salix, Grewia, Ziziphus, Searsia, Dichrostachys and Ceratonia, based on their known antimicrobial activity. The antibacterial effects of leaf extracts against multidrug-resistant E. coli O157:H7 were investigated using a broth microdilution method, and cytotoxicity to normal mammalian cell lines was studied using a tetrazolium colorimetric assay. Subsequently, antibiofilm activity and inhibition of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production by plant extracts against E. coli O157:H7 was investigated using crystal violet as a staining dye after 0 and 24 h incubation and carbohydrate estimation 5 % phenol-sulfuric assay. The biosensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472 was used to study the anti-quorum sensing potential of the selected plant extracts. Cell motility, cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH), and aggregation were also investigated. All plant extracts had weak antibacterial activity (MIC > 0.62 mg/ml) with relatively low cytotoxicity. The acetone extracts of Salix babylonica and Leucaena leucocephala prevented bacterial cell attachment (0 h) by 81.21 % and 89.36 %, respectively. Approximately 28 % of plant extracts eradicated established biofilms by more than 50 %, however, they were unable to inhibit EPS production above 30 %. The half-maximal concentration of extracts generally inhibited violacein production (ranging from 0.01 to 0.02 mg/ml), with V. erioloba acetone extract being the most effective at quorum quenching. Some plant extracts exhibited a significant difference (p<0.05) in motility, aggregation and hydrophobicity compared to untreated cells. This study highlights the potential of selected plant extracts to act via different mechanisms of action to decrease virulence of enteric E. coli, motivating further investigation of the bioactive compounds in the leaves. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Seed hydration memory is an adaptive strategy for plants in semiarid environments where water availability is irregular and unpredictable. Species native to these environments that have memory benefit from discontinuous hydration during their germination process and acquire tolerance to environmental stresses. The guiding question of this study is “does an alien species that invades a semiarid ecosystem also have seed hydration memory and benefit from discontinuous hydration?” To answer this question, we collected seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, an alien species that invades a Brazilian Tropical Dry Forest. We subjected the seeds to 0, 1, 2 and 3 hydration/dehydration cycles (HD cycles) at three different time intervals and, subsequently, to water, saline and thermal stresses. In addition, we used modeling to define the osmotic and thermal limits for occurrence of L. leucocephala and evaluated whether these limits increase after discontinuous hydration of seeds. The cycles of HD positively influenced the germination of seeds submitted to all stresses evaluated, increasing seed tolerance to treatments of water, saline, and thermal stresses. Discontinuous hydration increased the osmotic limits of salinity and thermal tolerance, although not increasing the osmotic limit of water deficit. Our results show that HD cycles also change the patterns of germinative responses of an invasive species to the environmental stresses of the invaded ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - SELECTION OF BIOINDICATORS FOR AIR POLLUTION BASED ON PEROXIDASE ACTIVITY OF PLANT SPECIES FOUND IN THE CHEMBUR INDUSTRIAL AREA OF MUMBAI, INDIA-A PRIMARY STEP TO GREEN ZONE ENRICHMENT
PY  - 2024

AB  - Industrialization and population growth are the important factors for the deterioration of air quality in the current scenario. Air pollution monitoring using plants as bioindicators is the best and cheapest way. Oxidative stress induced on plants due to air pollution can be studied using antioxidant peroxidase enzyme activity. The present study aims at the comparative assessment of peroxidase activity of twelve plant species from the Chembur industrial area and less polluted zone of similar ecological conditions for two years. The peroxidase activity was determined using the spectrophotometric method. The observations based on the current investigation revealed a rise in the peroxidase activity of twelve plant species of the industrial zone as compared to the less polluted zone. It may indicate an increase in the resistant capacity of all experimental samples toward the oxidative stress caused due to air pollution. Plant species like Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth, Ricinus communis L., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit., Albizia saman (Jacq.) Merr, Thespesia populnea (L.) Sol. ex. Correa, Polyalthia longifolia (Sonn.) Thwaites, Prosopis juliflora (SW.) DC., Terminalia catappa L. showed higher peroxidase activity values and hence may be used as bioindicators. Thespesia populnea (L.) Sol. ex. Correa, Polyalthia longifolia (Sonn.) Thwaites and Terminalia catappa L. being evergreen plants may be planted in good numbers in the Chembur industrial area. It may act as a primary step to ameliorate the industrial air pollution in the Chembur industrial zone by enhancing the green zone. This kind of investigation with other factors may help us to sustain our mother nature for future generations. © 2024, Rasayan Journal of Chemistry, c/o Dr. Pratima Sharma. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-term impact of silviculture systems on phosphorus transformation and adsorption behaviour in semi-arid restored lands
PY  - 2025
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212928850&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2024.109449&partnerID=40&md5=61eea61d50b4710ec20de2ca88a435ad
AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a key nutrient in silvicultural ecosystems, where its cycling influences both primary productivity and ecosystem development. Different trees affect P availability in distinct ways. Analyzing impact of various trees on soil P fractions and the its adsorption-desorption behavior helps better understand soil P availability in these ecosystems. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of silviculture systems (SCSs) on depth distribution of P fractions, the P adsorption-desorption pattern, and P availability in eco-restored land. Three distinct silviculture systems, namely Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Hardwickia binata (HB), and Azadirachta indica (AI) SCSs were compared with degraded fallow (F) to assess their influence on soil properties and P dynamics in a Typic Haplustepts of semi-arid ecosystem. Soil samples were collected from three different depths 0–15 cm, 15–30 cm, and 30–45 cm of these SCSs. The LL, HB and AI showed 2.50, 2.01 and 1.39 times increase in available P over fallow, respectively. Microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) content increased in LL by 99, 97, and 53 % at 0–15, 15–30, and 30–45 cm, respectively, over fallow. For acid phosphatase activity, LL, HB, and AI exhibited 3.15, 2.43, and 1.56 folds increase over fallow. The distribution of different phosphorus fractions followed the order: Fe-P (39.9–36.7 %)> Organic P (25.7–24.4 %) > Al-P (24.8–19.1 %)> Ca-P (8.64–4.05 %)> Res-P (8.61–7.37 %)> Saloid P (0.63–0.50 %). Additionally, P adsorption-desorption revealed that SCSs could lower the adsorption capacity and P desorption than fallow. Thus, different silviculture systems exhibit the potential to enhance the P-supplying capacity of soil and restore degraded soils in semi-arid regions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current study evaluated the effects of air pollution on selected street trees in the National Capital Territory during the pre- and post-monsoon seasons to identify the optimally suitable tree for green belt development in Delhi. The identification was performed by measuring the air pollution tolerance index (APTI), anticipated performance index (API), dust-capturing capacity (DCC) and proline content on the trees. The APTI of street trees of Delhi varied significantly among different tree species (F11,88.91 = 47.18, p < 0.05), experimental sites (F3,12.52 = 6.65, p < 0.001) and between seasons (F1,31.12 = 16.51, p < 0.001), emphasizing the relationships between trees and other types of variables such as the climate and level of pollution, among other factors. This variability emphasizes the need to choose trees to use for urban greening in the improvement of air quality in different environments within cities. Ascorbic acid (AA) concentration and relative water content (RWC) had a strong influence on APTI with an extremely significant moderate positive correlation between AA concentration and APTI (r = 0.65, p < 0.001) along with RWC and APTI (r = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that higher levels of AA concentration and RWC are linked to increased air pollution tolerance. The PCA bi-plot indicates AA has poor positive loading coefficients with PC1 explaining 29.49% of the total variance in the dataset. The highest APTI was recorded in Azadirachta indica (22.01), Leucaena leucocephala (20.65), Morus alba (20.62), Ficus religiosa (20.61) and Ficus benghalensis (19.61), irrespective of sites and seasons. Similarly, based on API grading, F. religiosa and F. benghalensis were identified as excellent API grade 6 (81–90%), A. indica and Alstonia scholaris as very good API grade 5 (71–80%), M. alba, Pongamia pinnata and Monoon longifolium as good API grade 4 (61–70%) and Plumeria alba as moderate API grade 3 (51–60%) in different streets of Delhi. As these plants are indigenous to the region and hold significant socio-economic and aesthetic significance in Indian societies, they are advisable for avenue plantations as part of various government initiatives to support environmental sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Increasing global fuel demand has created challenges in sourcing raw materials, making agro-waste biomass utilization for energy production a critical alternative. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the production of charcoal briquettes using different base materials such as coconut shells (TC1), Leucaena leucocephala wood (TC2), and assorted wood charcoal residues (TC3), along with binders derived from cassava industry by-products—namely, tapioca starch (TB1), cassava peel (TB2), and cassava tubers (TB3) at binder content (BC) ratios of 5, 10, 15, and 20 by volume. Initially, assessing the physical properties, including proximate and ultimate analyses, was crucial for predicting effective charcoal production. The TC2 briquettes, using TB2 and TB3 binders at a BC20 concentration, were found to be optimal, displaying a high production capacity and low specific energy consumption. Using cassava peel and tubers as binders not only efficiently uses agricultural by-products, thereby reducing costs and avoiding competition with food resources (TC1) but also results in high-quality briquettes. In scenarios of raw material shortages, TC3 and TC2 can effectively replace TC1. Mechanically, TC3 and TC2 briquettes exhibited superior characteristics. Although BC20 enhances the mechanical properties and facilitates handling, it may compromise heat release. Thermally, a higher BC decreases the charcoal proportion, leading to increased ignition time, reduced calorific value, and heating effectiveness. In conclusion, the successful production of charcoal briquettes from agro-industrial waste using cassava industrial binders presents a viable pathway towards more sustainable energy practices, improves waste management, and adds value to agricultural waste. © 2024 The Authors

TI  - Carbon storage and sequestration rates in Leucaena leucocephala-based silvopasture in Southern Mexico
PY  - 2024

AB  - Agroforestry practices that include trees on grazing lands could enhance atmospheric CO2 sequestration and storage. However, carbon sequestration rates and storage capacity of intensively grazed agroforestry systems vary due to the diversity in species composition, stand structure, system age, and management practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate carbon stocks and accrual rates in Leucaena leucocephala + Cynadon plectostachyus, and Brachiaria decumbens grass silvopastoral systems and compare them with conventional open grazing lands. The study was carried out in Chiapas in southern Mexico, one of the hotspots of deforestation driven by the expansion of livestock farming. We measured above- and belowground carbon stocks in 18 silvopasture (SP) plots, with the plantation age ranging from 2 to 10 years. Nine plots of adjacent conventional full-sun grasslands (open pasturelands) grazed rotationally were sampled for comparison. The average tree biomass stock in SP was 5.5 ± 1.9 Mg C ha−1 and differed with SP age. Mean annual biomass accrual rates ranged from 0.25 to 2.57 Mg C ha−1 year−1, indicating that SP systems are CO2 sinks, excluding other sources of GHG such as methane emissions from enteric fermentation. The average soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rate of SP was 0.143 ± 0.043 Mg C ha−1 year−1 to 50 cm depth. The SOC sequestration rates correlated positively with SP age at the beginning and decreased after about 8 years. The results suggested that the age and lifespan of trees play a significant role in aboveground C sequestration through the Leucaena leucocephala SP, while SOC storage varied with soil properties. Further research on the relative response of active and stable SOC fractions along with soil CO2 fluxes could explain the results on the SOC storage potential of these agroforestry systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - This study aims to valorize agricultural waste of Leucaena leucocephala pods (LP) as a low-cost precursor for synthesizing high-performance activated carbon (LP-AC) for the removal of methylene blue dye (MB). Phosphoric acid H3PO4 was employed as a chemical activator of the LP biomass with a mass ratio of phosphoric acid to the precursor (3/1) before being calcined at 500 °C for 55 min. Box Benken design was investigated to optimize the experimental parameters of initial concentration, adsorbent dose, and pH. Variable optimization indicated that the highest removal efficiency of MB dye, estimated as 99.99%, was noticed at the initial concentration of 300.87 mg L−1, adsorbent dose of 0.049 g, and solution pH of 10.07. Isotherm study revealed that Temkin model shows the best agreement with the experimental data with a correlation coefficient of (R2 = 0.990). The adsorption capacity of MB dye was determined as 584.32 mg g−1. The kinetic study suggested that the pseudo-second-order model is the best-correlated model for data fitting with (R2 > 0.997). The thermodynamic analysis indicated an enthalpy change (ΔH) of − 18.50 kJ/mol, confirming that the adsorption of MB dye onto LP-AC material is an exothermic process. SEM characterization of the surface showed that the LP-AC exhibits a heterogeneous structure. The BET analysis revealed a remarkable surface area of 1367.30 m2 g−1 for the produced carbon, including a blend of mesoporous and microporous structures. Furthermore, complementary analyses including EDS, TGA, and FTIR confirmed the presence of crucial properties, underscoring its potential effectiveness as an adsorbent for removing MB dye. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2024.

TI  - Assessment of antioxidant and antibacterial efficacy of some indigenous vegetables consumed by the Manipuri community in Sylhet, Bangladesh
PY  - 2024

AB  - The rapid dietary changes experienced by indigenous people worldwide threaten the use of traditional foods, which are often undervalued. This study focused on evaluating the antioxidant and antibacterial efficacy of five vegetables typically consumed by the Manipuri ethnic groups in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh: Yongchak seed (Parkia speciosa), Telikadam seed (Leucaena leucocephala), Phakphai leaf (Persicaria odorata), Sheuli leaf (Nyctanthes arbor-tristis), and bamboo shoot (Bambusa spp.). The samples were dried and powdered to assess the antioxidant activity through total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total tannin content (TTC), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. Antibacterial efficacy was determined by measuring the zone of inhibition (ZOI), minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Leafy vegetables exhibited higher TPC, TFC, and TTC than seeds and shoots, with N. arbor-tristis leaf showing the highest TPC (99.16 ± 2.07 mg GAE/g DW) and P. odorata leaf exhibiting the highest TFC (9.19 ± 0.7 mg QE/g) and TTC (3.59 ± 0.26 mg TAE/g). However, Bambusa spp. shoot extract showed the highest antioxidant potential (IC50: 1.66 ± 0.05 mg/mL). All samples exhibited higher ZOI against gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp.), ranging from 10 ± 2.65 to 19.33 ± 2.08 mm. L. leucocephala seed extract showed the highest antibacterial activity against both the tested gram-positive bacteria with a MIC of 15.6 mg/mL. Conversely, the P. odorata leaf extract exerted the strongest antibacterial effect against gram-negative bacteria, with the lowest MIC values for Klebsiella spp. (31.25 mg/mL) and Escheria coli (62.5 mg/mL). The findings of this investigation suggest that the selected indigenous vegetables could be valuable sources of phytochemicals with potential antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Incorporating and promoting these traditional foods into the diet may improve food security, dietary diversity, and public health in Bangladesh. © 2024 The Authors

TI  - Soil Microbial Responses to Varying Environmental Conditions in a Copper Belt Region of Africa: Phytoremediation Perspectives
PY  - 2025
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216081817&doi=10.3390%2fmicroorganisms13010031&partnerID=40&md5=5e9e57f075bb38f6e3f2cbb867541e88
AB  - The mining industry in the copper belt region of Africa was initiated in the early 1900s, with copper being the main ore extracted to date. The main objectives of the present study are (1) to characterize the microbial structure, abundance, and diversity in different ecological conditions in the cupriferous city of Lubumbashi and (2) to assess the metal phytoextraction potential of Leucaena leucocephala, a main plant species used in tailing. Four ecologically different sites were selected. They include a residential area (site 1), an agricultural dry field (site 2), and an agricultural wetland (site 3), all located within the vicinity of a copper/cobalt mining plant. A remediated tailing was also added as a highly stressed area (site 4). As expected, the highest levels of copper and cobalt among the sites studied were found at the remediated tailing, with 9447 mg/kg and 2228 mg/kg for copper and cobalt, respectively. The levels of these metals at the other sites were low, varying from 41 mg/kg to 579 mg/kg for copper and from 4 mg/kg to 110 mg/kg for cobalt. Interestingly, this study revealed that the Leucaena leucocephala grown on the remediated sites is a copper/cobalt excluder species as it accumulates soil bioavailable metals from the rhizosphere in its roots. Amplicon sequence analysis showed significant differences among the sites in bacterial and fungal composition and abundance. Site-specific genera were identified. Acidibacter was the most abundant bacterial genus in the residential and remediated tailing sites, with 11.1% and 4.4%, respectively. Bacillus was predominant in both dry (19.3%) and wet agricultural lands (4.8%). For fungi, Fusarium exhibited the highest proportion of the fungal genera at all the sites, with a relative abundance ranging from 15.6% to 20.3%. Shannon diversity entropy indices were high and similar, ranging from 8.3 to 9 for bacteria and 7.0 and 7.4 for fungi. Β diversity analysis confirmed the closeness of the four sites regardless of the environmental conditions. This lack of differences in the microbial community diversity and structures among the sites suggests microbial resilience and physiological adaptations. © 2024 by the authors.

TI  - Cactus species and tree forage hay in the diet of dairy goats
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185506541&doi=10.1007%2fs11250-024-03928-w&partnerID=40&md5=707beac39f1b6f8258cbf6267deb5764
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the association of Opuntia stricta (OS) or Nopalea cochenillifera (NC) with Moringa hay (MY) or Leucaena hay (LY) on nutrient intake, ingestive behavior, serum biochemistry, and milk production and composition of dairy goat. Eight multiparous Saanen goats were used, with an average of 68 ± 8 days in milk and 48.5 ± 6 kg of initial weight, fed with the following treatment diets: OS + MY; OS + LY; NC + MY, and NC + LY. The treatments were distributed in a double Latin square, in a 2 × 2 factorial scheme (two varieties of cactus and two of hay). Goats fed with NC had higher (P < 0.05) intakes of dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and non-fibrous carbohydrates. There was no influence (P > 0.05) on milk production, but goats fed with OS produced milk with higher (P < 0.05) fat content and presented higher (P < 0.05) feed efficiency. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of the hay type on the nutrient intake and milk production and composition of goats, but the animals fed with MY had higher (P < 0.05) serum cholesterol levels and greater efficiency of NDF rumination. Goats fed with OS showed greater feeding and rumination efficiency. Our results indicated that both cactus species could be successfully included in the diet of low yielding dairy goats fed 18.4% concentrate. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala poisoning is reported in horses in different Brazilian regions. The poisoning occurred one month after the horses were introduced into paddocks invaded by the plant or after 10 days of consuming cut Leucaena administered as the only food. Affected horses showed moderate to severe hair loss on the mane and tail, orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with marked follicular telogenization, and hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells. Mimosin concentration in leaves (5.5 mg/g) was determined by a new HLPC-UV method which is also reported. © 2024

AB  - The increase in cases of various cancers, the number of cancer patients, and the serious side effects of current chemical treatments have encouraged researchers to discover novel and more effective drugs from plant sources. In this review, PubMed and Scopus were searched for English-language peer-reviewed articles published since 1994, using the keywords: Medicinal plants, Egypt, and Cancer. The inclusion criteria for this systematic review were English peer-reviewed original research articles. A total of 286 studies were included. Studies have shown that the active compounds in certain plants can have anticancer activities by various mechanisms, such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and antioxidant effects. Additionally, it is evident that medicinal plants can act as inhibitors of cancer cells. Plants can also act as immune checkpoint inhibitors, which inhibit proteins such as PD-L1 on tumor cells, PD-1 and CTLA-4 on T cells, and help to regulate immune responses. This review also discusses the efficacy of nanoparticles of these plants against cancer cells. The findings indicate the high potential of investigating the bioactive anticancer components of Egyptian medicinal plants for advancing novel treatments that are more effective in combating cancer. The extracts and active compounds of the medicinal plants detailed in this review could provide the foundation for further clinical trials to be conducted, to develop new anticancer drugs. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Green post-harvest sugarcane residues (Saccharum officinarum) present low rates of decomposition and N release in the short term when integrated into the production system. Combining S. officinarum residues with the foliage of local plants rich in nitrogen could be an alternative to accelerate the decomposition process of residues with a positive impact on soil conservation. Objective: To evaluate and compare the decomposition patterns and potential release of N to the soil of the residues of S. officinarum variety MEX 69-290, with the addition of different foliage such as Clitoria ternatea, Leucaena leucocephala and Tithonia diversifolia, in southern Quintana Roo. Methodology: The treatments evaluated were the following: Clitoria + MEX 69-290, Leucaena + MEX 69-290, Tithonia + MEX 69-290, and MEX 69-290 (control). The materials were placed in decomposition bags and incubated on the ground in four periods (15, 30, 60 and 120 days), in a completely randomized design. The contents of dry matter, nitrogen and lignin were determined for the initial and remaining material in each period. Results: With the integration of local plants, a significant increase in the percentage of decomposition and release of N was obtained. After 120 days of evaluation, the decomposition values were 71.3, 50.4, 48.1 and 33.5%, for the Tithonia + MEX 69-290, Clitoria + MEX 69-290, Leucaena + MEX 69-290, and MEX 69-290 control, respectively. Likewise, the potential N release values were 98.2, 95.3, 92.9 and 58.7%, for Tithonia + MEX 69-290, Leucaena + MEX 69-290, Clitoria + MEX 69-290, and MEX 69-290 control. The Tithonia + MEX 69-290 treatment had the highest relative decomposition rate (0.009 g g-1 day-1) and a high potential N release rate (0.053 g g-1 day-1), compared to the other treatments. Implications: The integration of N-rich plants can increase the decomposition and release of N from sugarcane residues, with potential in plant assimilation from the first crop cycle, reduce the application of nitrogen fertilizer and increase sugarcane yields. in the region. Conclusion: The combination of S. officinarum residues with foliage of local plants, particularly T. diversifolia, could be considered a viable strategy to accelerate the decomposition process and release of N in residues on the edaphoclimatic conditions of southern Quintana Roo. © 2024 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

AB  - To evaluate the potential of compost based on municipal solid waste (MSW) and 20% legume pruning under a pyrolysis process, generated products, including solids (biochar), liquids (bio-oil), and gases (non-condensable gases), through experimentation in a pilot plant with a fluidized bed reactor at 450°C and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry have been analysed. In addition, the compost kinetic behaviour by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), using the Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) method, has been investigated. Four different reaction zones, associated with lignocellulosic materials (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin) with a first step for water evaporation, in TGA curve have been observed. A biochar with low stability and aromaticity, considering high and low O/C and H/C ratios, respectively, has been obtained. The obtained pyrolytic liquids contain a high concentration of phenolic compounds because of a significant presence of lignins and other high molecular weight compounds in the original material. Moreover, the generated non-condensable gases consist mainly of short-chain compounds, such as alcohols, aldehydes, and alkenes produced from hemicellulose, cellulose, and proteins. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of adding fibrolytic enzyme cocktail, which was derived from dried tomato pomace treated with Aspergillus niger, to Leucaena silage on total gas production by using in vitro gas techniques. In addition, the effect of these enzymes on voluntary feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and rumen fermentation were determined using 8 male, crossbred Anglo Nubian x Native goats. The experiment was designed as a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square. The experimental treatments were randomly assigned to each sequence of feeding of the 4 experimental treatments, i.e., 0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.8% (dry matter) of enzyme cocktail supplemented to Leucaena silage. The addition of 0.4% enzyme cocktail increased total gas production at 96 h, which was not different from the addition of commercial cellulase. Gas production from the insoluble fraction (b) was improved by increasing the enzyme cocktail levels (P = 0.039). The voluntary intake of Leucaena silage increased with an increase in the addition of enzyme level (P = 0.025). The dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, NDF and ADF digestibility's were also increased by increasing the addition of enzyme cocktail level. The addition of enzyme cocktail increased the Prevotella_1 in rumen fluid compared with the untreated group. In conclusion, at 0.4%, the fibrolytic enzyme cocktail derived from A. niger increased feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and ruminal fibrolytic bacteria community in goats. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current research was performed in the Morni Hills, a part of the outer Himalayas. Floristic assessment is critical for a plant community, reflecting both the gene pool and adaptability of the community. For this, different parameters like density, frequency, basal area, IVI, and various diversity indices were calculated by dividing the area into two altitudinal ranges, i.e. 400-600 m AMSL (AR_1) and 600-800 m AMSL (AR_2). The vegetation sampling was done by randomly selecting 30 plots in the selected area. The study showed that AR_2 (118 plant species: 31 trees, 17 shrubs, 58 herbs, and 12 climbers) had a higher number of plant species in comparison to AR_1 (106 plant species: 26 trees, 14 shrubs, 54 herbs, and 12 climbers) with Poaceae being the family with the greatest number of species. The area was seen to be dominated by Acacia nilotica (L.) willd. Ex Delile, Cassia fistula L., and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in AR_1 while by Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre, Cassia fistula, and Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz in AR_2. The upper range, i.e. AR_2 was also more diverse than AR_1 because of a high Shannon Wiener Diversity Index value and a lower Simpson Index value. Whereas the population structure study demonstrated that girth class D (CBH=61-90 cm) had the highest number of tree species in both altitudinal ranges, followed by girth class C (CBH=31-60 cm). Moreover, the forest was also observed to be occupied by various invasive plant species as well as under anthropogenic pressure, hence in immediate need of proper management and conservation.  © 2024 Himanshi Dhiman et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - A study was conducted to observe the nodulation status and measure nitrogenase activity of some important legume tree species in nursery. Of the thirteen species surveyed eight belong to Mimoceae, two Papilionaceae and three Caesalpiniaceae. All the species in Mimoceae and Papilionaceae were found nodulated whereas all the members of Caesalpiniaceae were non-nodulated. Among nodulated seedlings, highest number of nodules per seedling was recorded in Leucaena leucocephala (82) followed by Acacia auriculiformis (55), Acacia mangium (52), Albizia lebbeck (46), A. procera (41), Dalbergia sissoo (32) and Acacia catechu (29). Nitrogenase activity was highest in L. leucocephla (4913.59 nmole C2H4 h-1) followed by Albizia procera (2080 nmole C2H4 h-1). Seedling height, nodule fresh weight, root fresh weight and nitrogenase activity (per nodule per h, per gram nodule fresh weight per h, per gram root fresh weight per h and per gram root dry weight per h) were also highest in L. leucocephala. © © 2000 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

TI  - Overall performances of Leucaena leucocephala and Morus alba in high-density protein banks at maturity in western Burkina Faso
PY  - 2025
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212986753&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-024-01111-6&partnerID=40&md5=ddbfd930ff98723d0a56153314538f62
AB  - The objective of this work was to carry out long-term monitoring of protein banks (PB) established under the real-low-input-farm conditions of Burkina Faso, characterized by a Sudano-Sahelian climate type with wide variations in rainfall. The PBs, planted in 2016–2017 with Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Morus alba (MA) at a high density (20,000 plants/ha), were monitored from 2016/2017 to 2021 for their biomass (fodder) production, chemical composition and nutritional value of the edible fodder, and their impacts on soil carbon content. The average annual fodder production of LL for the 6 PBs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) was 11.4 ± 2.12 t DM/ha/year, while that of MA was 3.8 ± 1.2 t DM/ha/year for the 3 PB (1, 2, and 3). Such differences are related to higher adaptive capacity for LL in such climatic conditions. Crude protein was higher in LL (19% versus 17%), but dry matter digestibility (65% versus 77%) was superior in MA. Soil carbon increased during the five monitored years, an exciting result for these poor, low-fertility soil conditions. Our results demonstrate the technical and environmental feasibility of establishing this low-input agroforestry technology in these conditions and inspire the potential of sustainable agriculture as an agroecological alternative to overcoming feed shortages for local livestock farming. However, the successful management of a PB relies on selecting the right suitable species, protecting them, and managing them during the establishment and fodder production periods with suitable cutting frequency and appropriate post-harvest management. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

TI  - Dataset of biopellet characteristics from various lignocellulosic agricultural waste and shrubs produced using different method
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203130412&doi=10.1016%2fj.dib.2024.110879&partnerID=40&md5=fc4abb4075bb8a975020331a8ba2c55f
AB  - The data presented here is the characteristics of biopellets and its raw materials. The raw materials of lignocellulosic waste (coffee skin, corncob, patchouli waste) and shrubs (Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium) were collected from certain districts in Indonesia which provided quite abundant stocks of these raw materials. The raw material preparation and pelletization at room temperature (25 °C) using a manual press machine were carried out at Hasanuddin University, Makassar, Indonesia. Meanwhile, pelletization at high temperatures (225 °C) was carried out at The Integrated Laboratory of Forest Research and Development, Bogor, Indonesia. The evaluation of density, moisture content, volatile matter content, ash content, and amount of fixed carbon were also carried out at the laboratory. Meanwhile, evaluation of mineral content (sulfur, Na2O, K2O, Cl) and calorivic value was carried out at the Livestock Research Institute, Bogor, Indonesia. The results show that pelletization at high temperature produces better quality biopellets compared to pelletization at room temperature. Pelletization of L. leucocephala at high temperature produces the best quality biopellets with the highest density (1.17 g/cm3) and calorific value (4726 kcal/kg) and the lowest moisture content (4.87 %) and mineral content (0.01 % of S, 0.0014 % of Na2O, 1.53 % of K2O, and 0.17 % of Cl) among the other raw materials tested. This dataset is expected to be a primary source in comparing and determining the proper type of raw material for biopellet production as an alternative renewable energy source, especially those originating from shrubs and similar lignocellulosic waste. © 2024 The Author(s)

TI  - Alley cropping agroforestry systems change weed community composition and reduce dominant weed species associated with corn in southern Mexico
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150233370&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2023.108471&partnerID=40&md5=c8c7ace986bbc7667cdef0f89b5ad829
AB  - Alley cropping systems can change the weed community composition and reduce common weed species. However, it is unclear how different woody species intercalated with corn can affect weed abundance and community structure and corn yield in the tropics. The present study examined weed species diversity and community composition in alley cropping systems with three woody species associated with corn: Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Guazuma ulmifolia Lam., and Moringa oleifera Lam. independently, and corn monoculture, as a control. The tree most dominant weed species were Ruellia nudiflora (Engelm. & A. Gray) Urb., Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., and Portulaca pilosa L. Our results showed that the alley cropping system compared with corn monoculture reduced the densities of common abundant weed species, changed weed community composition, maintained or increased plant diversity, but did not affect grain yield (t/h). Based on the sample completeness profile we found that Leucaena associated with corn had a higher weed diversity of order q = 1 and 2 (Shannon and Simpson index) and showed higher evenness compared with corn monoculture, which showed the lowest evenness of all treatments. We found nine weed species that only grow in alley cropping systems and Waltheria americana L., Momordica charantia L. and Porophyllum punctatum (Mill) S.F. Blake. with higher densities. Our findings support the hypothesis that alley cropping systems not only changes weed community composition, but also favours biodiversity conservation without reducing corn yield. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - BENEFITS OF Leucaena FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE ARE A MYSTERY IN OBTAINING COMPOST AND VIRTUES UNTAPPED

AB  - Leucaena species (Leucaena trichodes and Leucaena leucocephala) offer significant potential for sustainable agriculture due to their ability to improve soil health and increase organic matter content. This study aimed to explore the benefits of composting Leucaena mixed with poultry manure and examine the effects of mimosine, an allelopathic compound found in Leucaena, on microbial activity during the composting process. Compost piles of 100 kg were prepared in various proportions (A: 80–20, B: 70–30, G: 0–100) and monitored for pH, temperature, and nutrient content. The pH levels ranged from 6.226 to 6.909, while temperatures varied between 24.66 and 32.85°C. Mimosine levels were quantified using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), showing concentrations of up to 5.5% in leaves and 5.2% in seeds. The presence of mimosine inhibited microbial oxidation, limiting biological activity during composting. Despite these challenges, the resulting earthworm humus contained high levels of nitrogen (up to 3.21%), phosphorus (P2 O5, 4.08%), and potassium (K2O, 2.32%), making it a nutrient-rich fertiliser ideal for nursery plants. These findings suggest that while mimosine affects composting, Leucaena-based humus can still be a valuable resource in sustainable agriculture, provided appropriate composting techniques are used to mitigate its effects. © 2024, Scibulcom Ltd..

TI  - Rain water harvesting, agroforestry and goat based intensification for livelihood resilience in drought prone rainfed smallholder farming system: a case for semi-arid tropics
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162906142&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-023-00863-x&partnerID=40&md5=d283836f527c0b2a3aab594942b9377c
AB  - Rainfed areas are the home of millions of resource poor farmers whose livelihood is under continuous threat due to frequent droughts. Assuring double cropping and imparting livelihood resilience to rainfed smallholders is a challenge. A study was planned in this direction during 2013–2021 for livelihood resilience and sustainable intensification of rainfed smallholder farming systems through rain water harvesting and agroforestry based interventions. The one hectare rainfed farming system model comprising of rain water harvesting farm pond (25 m × 20 m × 2.5 m), less water requiring food crops (groundnut–barley and sorghum–chickpea), agrihorticulture [Ziziphus mauritiana + (Sesamum indicum–Cicer arietinum)], silvipasture (Leucaena leucocephala + Tri-species hybrid grass + Stylosanthes hamata) and boundary plantation (Leucaena leucocephala and Opuntia ficus-indica) was evaluated at on-station as well as promoted on-farm. The goat rearing potential of the above model was also estimated under intensive and semi-intensive systems. The on-station rainfed farming system module produced 4979 kg ha−1 barley equivalent yield consisting of multiple products like barley, chickpea, groundnut, Indian jujube fruits, sesame, fodder (sorghum, TSH, Stylosanthes, Leucaena dried leaf meal and spine-less fodder cactus cladodes) and Grewia fruits and resulted in 655 US$ year−1 net returns with a benefit cost ratio of 2.1. The carrying capacity of the above model was found to be 9 and 35 goat year−1 under intensive and semi-intensive rearing systems, respectively. The net returns increased by 36 and 226% with the inclusion of goat under intensive (US$ 892) and semi-intensive rearing system (US$ 2136), respectively in the rainfed farming system model. It was evident from the study that inclusion of goat, agroforestry and farm pond for rain water harvesting in the rainfed farming have resulted in higher profitability and resilience to less rainfall and its aberrations. Contrarily, the on-farm observations revealed that farmers could not take winter season crops without rain water harvesting. The rain water harvesting proved to be the key for reducing chances of crop failures due to droughts, ensuring double cropping (cropping intensity up to 200%) and sustainable intensification in rainfed areas. It can be concluded from the present study that intervention of water harvesting, agroforestry and goat in rainfed farming systems could enhance the farm productivity and profitability and impart resilience to the livelihood of rainfed farmers in semi-arid tropics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - B ackground: Rhizobial bacteria is an important species among the soil bacteria that inter a relationship with leguminous plant and fix nitrogen symbiotically. Importance of this relation not only for soil as soil fertilizer but also to keep our environment without pollution. Methods: Survey was conducted to collect different strains of rhizobial from different area in Nineveh Governate in Iraq. Isolation and biochemical tests were done under laboratory conditions. Determination of exopolysaccharide and tolerance of heavy metal was conducted also. Data obtained was recorded after cultivation and incubation of rhizobial strains. Results: The rhizobial bacteria were isolated from the following leguminous plants: Vigna unguiculata L., Trifolium alexandrinum, Trigonella foenum-graecum L., Leucaena leucocephala L., Medicago sativa L., Phaseolus vulgaris L., Tribulus terrestris L. and Vicia faba L. Maximum exopolysaccharide production were reached to 3.70 gm/L by the isolate R. leguminosarum bv. Viciae RM25,after two days of incubation. The maximum cell dry weight was 2.90 gm/L. by the isolate E. meliloti RM14, after two days of incubation. Maximum reduction in pH were 4.30 by strain E. meliloti RM5, after two days incubation. All the local isolated rhizobia were tolerated to nickel chloride for the studied concentrations: 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 µg/ ml. Also were tolerance to 100 and 500 µg/ ml of zinc sulfate and copper sulfate. 1000 µg/ ml concentration of zinc sulfate were also tolerated by all rhizobial isolates. Conclusion: Rhizobium bacteria possess several mechanisms that allow them to tolerate heavy metal exposure. These mechanisms include the expression of efflux pumps, the presence of metal-resistance plasmids, the production of EPS, and the ability to adapt to environmental factors. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind the heavy metal tolerance in Rhizobium and to explore the potential applications of these bacteria in bioremediation of heavy metal polluted soils. © 2023, The Running Line.

The objective of this study was to isolate and identify the actinomycetes associated with the rhizosphere of plants in the karst ecosystem. This study was descriptive-quantitative. Soil sampling was conducted at three locations of the karst ecosystem of Gorontalo, i.e., Bangga Hills at Bangga Bubaa Coastal area of Gorontalo District, Hills around Lake Limboto of Gorontalo District, and Oluhuta Beach Hills at Bone Bolango District. Rhizosphere-soil sample was collected from 15-30 cm of soil depth. Isolation of actinomycetes was performed using the plate method. The screening of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria was based on the ability to solubilize phosphates indicated by the clear zone on the Pikovskaya medium. Identification of actinomycetes bacteria based on morphology and molecular characters. The morphology character included the color of aerial and substrate mycelium. Molecular characteristics based on the sequence of 16S rRNA gene compared to sequence data on the gene bank of NCBI. The phylogenetic tree reconstruction was based on the Neighbor-joining algorithm. The results successfully found six isolates, including three actinomycetes isolates, two non-actinomycetes bacteria, and one yeast. They were isolated from the rhizosphere of Malastoma malabathrum, Chromolaena odorata, Cycas rumphii, Leucaena leucocephala, and Jatropha curcas. The actinomycetes isolate showed plant-growth-promoting potential indicated by solubilizing phosphate and Indole 3-Acetic Acid production activities. Based on the molecular analysis, actinomycetes were closely related to Streptomyces aegyptia (MT505707.1:42-1426), Streptomyces sp. GGCR-6 (MH718844.1:5-1391), and Streptomyces carpaticus strain PES-A23 (MH712039). © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cattle production in Colombia has an important social and economic role but causes considerable environmental impacts, such as deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions by ruminants, particularly methane. Thus, technological innovations aimed at reducing these impacts must focus on both economic and environmental sustainability. Silvo-pastoral systems (SPS) offer productivity increases while generating environmental benefits and ecosystem services and are therefore at the center of debate around sustainable production alternatives. The objective of this article is to evaluate the economic-environmental performance of two proposed SPS for a cattle fattening system for the Colombian context: (i) Urochloa brizantha cv. Toledo and (ii) Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman, both in association with Leucaena leucocephala trees for browsing and shade provision. They are compared with the respective base scenarios of only using the grasses in monocultures. The study consists of a financial analysis, which estimates potential profitability increases in beef production in the SPS, and an environmental evaluation, which estimates the monetary values of microclimatic regulation and reduction of methane emissions. The value of methane emission reductions is then integrated into a combined economic-environmental evaluation. Results show that both SPS improve the profitability indicators of the production system and reduce the probability of economic loss. Likewise, the reduction of methane emissions in the SPS is estimated at US$6.12 per cattle, and the economic value of microclimatic regulation at US$2,026 per hectare. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Potentially toxic elements (PTE) in soil like copper (Cu) have been common in agricultural and mining areas worldwide. The sustainable remediation of these areas has been shown to have high socio-environmental relevance and phytoremediation is one of the green technologies to be considered. The challenge is to identify species that are tolerant to PTE, and to assess their phytoremediation potential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological response of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and to determine the species tolerance and phytoremediation potential to concentrations of Cu in the soil (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/dm3). The photosynthetic rate was not affected, while the content of chlorophylls decreased as Cu concentrations increased. There was an increased in stomatal conductance and water use efficiency from the treatment of 300. The root biomass and the length were bigger than the shoots, in the treatments above 300. Cu accumulation was greater in the roots than in the shoot of the plants, thus, the Cu translocation index to the shoot was lower. The ability to absorb and accumulate, mainly, Cu in the roots, allowed the development and growth of plants, since the parameters of photosynthesis and biomass accumulation were not affected by the Cu excess. This accumulation in the roots is characterized as a strategy for the phytostabilization of Cu. Therefore, L. leucocephala is tolerant to the Cu concentrations evaluated and has a potential phytoremediation of Cu in the soil. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Mine soil properties as influenced by tree species and topography of the re-vegetated coal mine overburden dump
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170435178&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2023.107500&partnerID=40&md5=d970928209cb3a6d13d4455d90c0ea6b
AB  - Re-vegetation or natural succession of plant species is an important factor of soil development in postmining overburden dumps. As the parent material (sedimentary rocks and regolith) is more or less uniform in the dump, the topographic position and vegetation are the major factors that affects the mine soil quality. Accordingly, this study was designed for a relative evaluation of the influence of dump topographical position (crest, backslope, toeslope) and tree species (Azadirachta indica, Cassia siamea, and Leucaena leucocephala) on soil quality. Trees growing on the toeslope of the dump were significantly taller with larger diameter at breast height than those at backslope or crest. Soil moisture, pH, total S, available P, and Fe content were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by topographical position of the dump. All these properties were higher in the toeslope, except S in the crest. Tree species affected all the soil properties, except electrical conductivity and Mn. Organic carbon content was significantly lower for the nitrogen fixer L. leucocephala (2.03 %) than A. indica (3.30 %) or C. siamea (3.39 %). Soil dehydrogenase activity (39.79 mg TPF/24hr/kg) and microbial biomass carbon (286 µg/g) was higher under L. leucocephala, and C. siamea, respectively. Based on redundancy analysis (RDA), 87.5 % of the data variation is explained by the tree species, whereas, only 12.5 % by the topography. Principal component analysis revealed that C. siamea contributes significantly for the variation in soil properties of the dump. Re-vegetated plant species are a dominant factor of soil development in post mining dump than the topographical position. C siamea and the toeslope are closely associated with soil microbial biomass carbon. It is recommended to plant C. siamea with relatively higher planting density in crest and backslope than toeslope of the dump. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Gayo coffee has been the main commodity of the Gayo tribe, including the Mude Nosar, as local farmers. One of the ways to cultivate Gayo coffee is through an agroforestry system. However, limited reports on the tree species composition and its management in Gayo coffee-based agroforestry need to be explored. This study aims i) to identify the tree species composition and structure, as well as 2) to analyze the management of Gayo coffee-based agroforestry system in Mude Nosar Village. The method used plot establishment for vegetation analysis and interviewed the Gayo coffee farmers. The results showed that the number of tree species at all growth stages was 26 species. The highest Important Value Index (IVI) at the understory and sapling level in order was rumput kerbau (Paspalum conjugatum) and Gayo coffee (Coffea arabica), while at the seedling, pole, and tree levels were dominated by lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala). The local farmers often use lamtoro as a shade tree for Gayo coffee in the agroforestry system. The species diversity index (H') showed low values at all tree growth levels. The horizontal structure of the tree stand showed an inverted J curve, meaning that the regeneration rate was normal. The vertical structure of the tree stand belongs to strata C and D. The local farmers have applied good Gayo coffee management practices through an agroforestry system, including land and seed preparation, planting, maintenance, and harvesting techniques. The management of Gayo coffee using an agroforestry system impacts the ecological, economic, and social aspects. © 2023, Pusat Penelitian Lingkungan Hidup - Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat Institut Pertanian Bogor (PPLH-LPPM IPB).

TI  - Leucaena interspecific hybrid ‘KX4-Hawaii’ as a source of agricultural biomass in a water-scarce small island developing state
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204943874&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.18201&partnerID=40&md5=114c8c323272bbd0108da3f268ba7bc6
AB  - Background: Leucaena leucocephala is a useful multipurpose tree species for agroforestry systems, but traditional seeded cultivars often become weedy and invasive. A seedless hybrid cultivar, ‘KX4-Hawaii’, offers a potential solution to this problem. However, relevant agronomic information and information on the performance of ‘KX4-Hawaii’ under varying growth conditions is required. The goal of this research was to evaluate ‘KX4-Hawaii’ as a source of agricultural biomass in Barbados, a small island developing state with limited arable land. Methods: ‘KX4-Hawaii’ air layers were imported into Barbados to create stock trees. Air layering was used to create propagation material and a field study was established with a ‘KX4-Hawaii’ hedgerow planted as a field border. Three plant spacings (50, 75, and 100 cm) were evaluated and data on the growth and biomass yields of the trees were collected at 4-month intervals. Precipitation data were used to investigate climatic effects on ‘KX4-Hawaii’ productivity. Results: ‘KX4-Hawaii’ was successfully propagated via air layers and could be planted directly in the field with irrigation. All recorded growth and biomass yields were correlated with precipitation. However, the woody (lignified stems and branches) biomass was more responsive to precipitation than the green (leaves and green tender stems) biomass and made up a large fraction of the total biomass produced. ‘KX4-Hawaii’ was productive even under drought conditions and biomass yields per meter of hedgerow increased with closer spacings. Of the tested spacing treatments, 75 cm was optimum for a 4-month pruning interval under the conditions seen in Barbados as it produced similar yields to the 50 cm spacing treatment but would require less propagation material.

TI  - Properties of Bark Particleboard Bonded with Demethylated Lignin Adhesives Derived from Leucaena leucocephala Bark
PY  - 2024

AB  - Lignin extraction from bark can maximize the utilization of biomass waste, offer cost-effectiveness, and promote environmental friendliness when employed as an adhesive material in bark particleboard production. Particles of fine (0.2 to 1.0 mm), medium (1.0 to 2.5 mm), and coarse (2.5 to 12.0 mm) sizes, derived from the bark of Leucaena leucocephala, were hot-pressed using a heating plate at 175°C for 7 min to create single-layer particleboards measuring 320 mm × 320 mm × 10 mm, targeting a density of 700 kg/m3. Subsequently, the samples were trimmed and conditioned at 20°C and 65% relative humidity. In this study, we compared bark particleboard bonded with urea formaldehyde (UF) adhesive to fine-sized particleboard bonded with demethylated lignin adhesive. The results indicated that bark particleboards utilizing demethylated lignin and UF adhesives exhibited similar qualities. Coarse particleboard showed differences in modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), while medium-sized particles exhibited significant variations in moisture content (MC) and water absorption (WA). Furthermore, the thickness swelling of coarse and medium-sized particles under wet and oven-dried conditions exhibited notable distinctions. Overall, the demethylated lignin adhesive extracted from L. leucocephala bark demonstrated similar quality to UF adhesive, with particle size correlating inversely to the strength of the bark particleboard. © 2024, Tech Science Press.

TI  - A tripartite microbial co-culture system for de novo biosynthesis of diverse plant phenylpropanoids

AB  - Plant-derived phenylpropanoids, in particular phenylpropenes, have diverse industrial applications ranging from flavors and fragrances to polymers and pharmaceuticals. Heterologous biosynthesis of these products has the potential to address low, seasonally dependent yields hindering ease of widespread manufacturing. However, previous efforts have been hindered by the inherent pathway promiscuity and the microbial toxicity of key pathway intermediates. Here, in this study, we establish the propensity of a tripartite microbial co-culture to overcome these limitations and demonstrate to our knowledge the first reported de novo phenylpropene production from simple sugar starting materials. After initially designing the system to accumulate eugenol, the platform modularity and downstream enzyme promiscuity was leveraged to quickly create avenues for hydroxychavicol and chavicol production. The consortia was found to be compatible with Engineered Living Material production platforms that allow for reusable, cold-chain-independent distributed manufacturing. This work lays the foundation for further deployment of modular microbial approaches to produce plant secondary metabolites. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - This research is an alternative technology to support a green economy for environmental sustainability. This paper was performed to reveal the relation between seed briquettes inoculated with the fungi of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in direct seeding of C. pentandra and L. leucocephala seedlings on marginal land in Parungpanjang, Bogor, Indonesia. A randomized block design was used in this research with three blocks and found that seed briquettes with AMF and DSE inoculated have significantly influenced the survival of seedlings of both species 12 months after planting. Direct sowing with seed briquette inoculated with AMF (48%) produced the highest seedling survival in C. pentandra, followed by seed briquette injected with Dendrothyrium sp. CPP1.1.4 (44.5%) in L. leucocephala. In C. pentandra and L. leucocephala, seed briquettes increased seedling survival compared to direct sowing without briquettes. Seedling growth was considerably impacted by AMF and DSE inoculations in L. leucocephala but not in C. pentandra. AMF and DSE can improve the height and diameter of direct-seeded L. leucocephala seedlings. Our research found that using seed briquettes and applying DSE has a high potential for increasing the success of direct seeding in assisting various reforestation programs in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background. Allergic respiratory diseases are prevalent in the Philippines, with allergic rhinitis and asthma occurring at 20% and 8.7% of the population, respectively. The diagnosis of respiratory allergies is achieved by a combination of patient history and different screening tools, especially for the identification of the allergic triggers such as allergy skin prick test (SPT) and serum-specific IgE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (sIgE ELISA). The Philippines, being a tropical country, have a wide variety of plant species with potential to produce allergenic pollen grains. Knowledge of the sensitization profiles of Filipino allergic patients to our local pollen allergens is currently limited. Objectives. The aim of this study is to determine the sensitization profile of patients with respiratory allergies (allergic rhinitis and/or asthma) through the allergy skin prick test (SPT) using allergenic local pollen extracts. It also aimed to determine if there is a positive agreement between the SPT and sIgE ELISA positivity rate and whether the results have relationship with the pollen purity and the protein content of the extracts. Methods. Pollen allergens were extracted from Amaranthus spinosus (pigweed), Mimosa pudica (makahiya), Tridax procumbens (wild daisy), Imperata cylindrica (cogon), Oryza sativa (rice), Pennisetum polystachion (foxtail grass), Sorghum halepense (Johnson grass), Albizia saman (acacia), Cocos nucifera (coconut), Leucaena leucocephala (ipil-ipil), and Mangifera indica (mango). SPT was performed at the Allergy Clinic of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital on patients with allergic rhinitis and/or bronchial asthma. Blood samples were collected from patients who developed wheal diameters of 3 mm or more than the negative control. Sera were tested against the same pollen extracts using ELISA. Results. Of the one hundred sixty-five (165) patients who submitted for skin prick test, 129 showed positive SPT results to the pollen extracts. Weeds were the most sensitizing (51.9%-58.1%). Blood samples were collected from these patients and tested for sIgE ELISA and among them, 71 were positive in the sIgE ELISA. Highest sensitization rates in sIgE ELISA were found in coconut, pigweed, Johnson grass, and rice. The highest positive agreements or the proportion of patients with positive sIgE ELISA among those with positive SPT were in coconut, followed by Johnson grass, pigweed, and rice. Most of the pollen sensitized patients on SPT are polysensitized. Conclusion. SPT is a safe, simple, and rapid method for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy. The lower number of positive patients in sIgE ELISA may be attributed to the low serum IgE levels and low quantities of effectual allergen components in extracts. Results of both SPT and ELISA must be correlated with a patient's clinical history, particularly the patient’s exposures, and physical examination. Copyright: © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, an invasive toxic tree species, has threatened the survival of native plants in the Hengchun Peninsula, southern Taiwan. Due to the small-to-medium diameter, the utilization and processing of L. leucocephala is highly restricted, while its discarding accelerates carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere. Biochar, produced from the pyrolysis of biomass under an inert atmosphere, is considered an effective carbon sequestration technique with high stability, which is important for long-term carbon storage and soil improvement. L. leucocephala biomass and montmorillonite were co-pyrolyzed under inert conditions, aiming to investigate the effects of different pyrolysis temperatures and montmorillonite blending ratios on biochar yield and carbon retention. Results showed improved biochar yield and carbon retention with increasing montmorillonite addition. Thermogravimetric analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated enhanced stability of the modified biochars. The production of modified L. leucocephala biochar represents a promising technique for carbon dioxide sequestration and biochar stabilization, enabling the development of L. leucocephala utilization approaches. © 2024, North Carolina State University.

AB  - In this study, four experimental treatments were evaluated: (T1) alfalfa hay + concentrate, (50:50%, DM); (T2) alfalfa hay + Leucaena leucocephala + concentrate, (30:20:50%, DM); (T3) alfalfa hay + prickly pear + concentrate, (30:20:50%, DM); and (T4) alfalfa hay + Leucaena leucocephala + prickly pear + concentrate, (30:10:10:50%, DM). NH3-N concentrations in T2 and T4 decreased when replaced with alfalfa hay in 20 and 10%, respectively. Treatments did not affect the concentration of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) between T3 and T4 (p > 0.05), while the concentrations among T1 and T2 were different (p < 0.05). T2 showed a reduction of 25.5% in the methane production when compared to T1 (p < 0.05). The lowest concentrations of protozoa were observed in T2 and T4, which contained Leucaena leucocephala (T2) and Leucaena leucocephala + prickly pear (T4) (p < 0.05). The highest concentration of total methanogens was recorded in T1 and was different in T2, T3, and T4 (p < 0.05). Leucaena leucocephala, at an inclusion percentage of 20%, decreased the methane when compared to T1, whereas prickly pear increased methane production in relation to T1. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most challenging noncommunicable diseases, as it causes significant costs for medical treatment as well as high morbidity and mortality rates. Dietary plants with antidiabetic properties have been explored as an alternative to synthetic medicines to treat DM because of their safety and nutrition. Hence, the objective of the present study was to determine the inhibitory activities of twenty commonly consumed Thai culinary vegetables against α-glucosidase and α-amylase. All vegetables were extracted using deionized water, ethanol, and hexane at 150 rpm and 30°C for 24 hours. The enzyme inhibitory activities were performed using a colorimetric assay. Diverse results for α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities were found for all vegetable extracts. The most potent anti-α-glucosidase activity was obtained from the ethanolic extract of Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 13.39 ± 0.14 μg/mL, followed by the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Polygonum odoratum Lour with IC50 of 25.60 ± 0.42 and 49.03 ± 0.72 μg/mL, respectively. All the samples exhibited mixed, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibition. It can be concluded that the α-glucosidase and α-amylose inhibitory effects of the investigated extracts may be an indicator of antidiabetic potency, and these extracts might potentially be beneficial as functional components for postprandial hyperglycemia treatment.  © 2024 Khakhanang Ratananikom et al.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from Ethiopian agriculture are significantly increasing, with the largest share is from enteric fermentation and manure left on pasture. An investigation was conducted to evaluate the anti-nutrient composition and effect of commonly used medicinal plant extracts on enteric methane emission from fibrous feeds using maize stover as substrate feed. Total phenols, flavonoid, tannin and essential oil contents were analyzed using established standards. Effects of leaf extracts of Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, three varieties of Cymbopogon citratus (Cymbopogon citratus-I, Cymbopogon citratus java and Cymbopogon citratus upper awash), Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa stenopetala, three varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosmarinus officinalis I, Rosmarinus officinalis II and Rosmarinus officinalis III) and Thyme schimperi, seed of three Coriandrum sativum varieties (Coriandrum sativum Batu, Coriandrum sativum Tulu and Coriandrum sativum Waltai) and root of Echinops kebericho on total gas production, digestibility and methane production of maize stover were investigated at different doses using the standard procedures. The results indicated that leaf extracts of Acacia nilotica had the highest (P < 0.001) total phenolic and total tannin contents. Compared to other evaluated plant species, all varieties of Cymbopogon citratus had the highest (P < 0.001) flavonoid content. Significantly high (P < 0.001) essential oil content was observed in Rosmarinus officinalis II than other varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis and other plant species. Significant reduction (P < 0.001) of methane production was observed with extracts of Cymbopoon citratus java (22.5 % less methane than the control) and thyme schimperi (16.7 % less methane than the control) at dose of 50 mg/kg DM. There was also significant (P < 0.001) interaction effect between plant species and dose rates at 50 mg/kg DM for both plant species. It can be concluded that the use of 50 mg/kg DM of Cymbopoon citratus java and Thyme schimperi extract to maize stover reduced methane production without negatively affecting feed digestibility. Further studies are necessary to examine the storability of the extracts in different time durations and evaluate their effects in vivo with animals. © 2023

TI  - In vitro Anthelmintic Efficacy of Three Plant Extracts against Various Developmental Stages of Haemonchus contortus
PY  - 2024

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematodes, including Haemonchus (H.) contortus, have a notable impact in terms of impaired production, high fatalities, and substantial economic losses, affecting small ruminants in tropical countries, including Pakistan. The irrational use of synthetic chemicals has fueled anthelmintic resistance, particularly in H. contortus, as a formidable challenge, prompting a search for alternative treatment strategies. This study evaluated the anthelmintic potential of leaf extracts of three forage plants, including Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa oleifera, and Acacia ampliceps, against various developmental stages of H. contortus. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of secondary metabolites in the extracts. In vitro assays were performed to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of the extracts on the inhibition of egg hatching, larval paralysis, and adult worm motility following the guidelines of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology, while Albendazole was used as a positive control and PBS as a negative control. The highest concentrations of tannins and flavonoids in Acacia ampliceps and phenolic compounds in Leucaena leucocephala were detected in the extracts as major secondary metabolites. All the tested extracts showed significant time- and dose-dependent responses to various stages of H. contortus. The ED50 values showed that the lowest dose of Leucaena leucocephala (0.285), Moringa oliefera (0.81), and Acacia ampliceps (0.245) inhibited egg hatching and larval and adult motility, respectively. Extracts of Leucaena leucocephala exhibited significant inhibition of egg hatching (70.3%), whereas Moringa oliefera showed maximum percent inhibition (66.6) of larval motility. These findings suggest that these plants, traditionally used by local healers in Pakistan, may possess antiparasitic properties, encouraging further studies on the relationship between phytochemicals, extraction methods, and in vivo trials to explore their anthelmintic efficacy. © 2024 University of Agriculture.

AB  - Substances produced by plants have huge importance regulating multiple functions as germination, development promoter/ enhancer, yield increaser and activator of plant defense system against diseases and pests. Due to diversity, each plant species produces different compounds and in different concentrations. This research evaluated the role of 20 plants extracts obtained from different plant species or plant tissues on seed germination and seedlings establishment of maize and lettuce, in concentration of 5%, 10% or 20%. For this, two experiments were carried out, the first analyzing 20 plant extracts and the effects on germination percentage and root and shoot length based on the germination test for the two species. The second was carried out in a greenhouse, in a completely randomized design with three and ten repetitions for maize and lettuce, respectively, using only the three extracts with the best results from the first experiment. Seedling height and seedling dry matter were evaluated. To germination test most of extracts showed negative or no effects in both species. Only Conyza bonariensis at 5% and Richardia brasiliensis at 5% and 20% had positive effects on early seedling growth, increasing the seedlings length for maize seedlings. To seedlings establishment, Conyza bonariensis, Leucaena leucocephala and Richardia brasiliensis extracts did not show statistical difference to shoots height but increased the dry mass of shoots and roots. The results demonstrated that these plants extract have potential as growth promoters and can be a good option to a better seedling growth and establishment, collaborating to a more effective agriculture. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Introduction: Sandalwood (Santalum album L.) is categorized as vulnerable in the IUCN Red list and is also an industrially important tree species valued for its heartwood and aromatic oil. Sandalwood is a semi-root parasite tree that relies on its host plants for its water and nutrient requirements. Therefore, there is need to understand the growth and physiological interactions between sandalwood and its hosts. Methods: Sandalwood were planted with ten different host species viz., Syzygium cumini, Punica granatum, Phyllanthus emblica, Melia dubia, Leucaena leucocephala, Dalbergia sissoo, Casuarina equisetifolia, Citrus aurantium, Azadirachta indica and Acacia ampliceps to assess the interactive effect on the change in growth and physiology of both sandalwood and host tree species. Results: The findings revealed that sandalwood grown with hosts D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia showed higher growth performance, while among hosts, S. cumini, followed by C. aurantium and L. leucocephala, showed better growth and physiobiochemical traits. The stepwise regression analysis and trait modeling indicated that the six traits, namely, plant height, photosynthetic rate, relative water content, water potential, intercellular CO2 concentration, and total soluble protein, contributed greater growth in the sandalwood, while four traits, namely, water potential, osmotic potential, leaf area, and total soluble protein, contributed greater growth in the host species. The traits modeling study predicted greater growth of sandalwood with the hosts D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia, whereas among host species, prediction revealed greater growth of S. cumini and C. aurantium. Discussion: The study concluded that host–parasite interaction modulated the growth and physiological processes in both sandalwood and hosts and sandalwood plantations can be successfully developed with the hosts D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia.

AB  - Legume tree One of the crops that may function as a viable source of animal feed and be utilized for land reclamation on former mining sites. Ex-tin mining land, which is widely spread in Indonesia, has the potential to transform to productive agricultural land, as long as the land is given sufficient inputs through land rehabilitation. The legume tree has drought resistance, hence limiting its potential for development on many types of land, including post-tin mining areas in the Bangka Tengah District of Bangka Island. The objective of this research is to assess the adaptation of two legume tree species in post-tin mining environments. The research was completed throughout the period from 2017 to 2020. Experiments using Randomized block design (RBD) with two different species of treatments, were repeated a total of five times. Two species tested were (1) Leucaena leucocephala cv Taramba, and (2) Indigofera zollingeriana. Data growth and yield components are harvested every three months and yield is subjected to analysis using the Duncan test at a significance level of 5 %. The research result indicated that all of the tested two species of legume tree were well-adapted to post-tin mining in Bangka Tengah District, Bangka Island. The fresh yield of L.leucocephala cv Taramba was higher (9.1 %) than I.zollingeriana but the quality was similar, so the two species can be developed on post-tin mining areas as forage material for an animal in Central Bangka District, Bangka Island. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Diabetes management through dietary intervention has gained significant interest, particularly in the use of natural plant-based inhibitors of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion. The objective of this study was to assess the inhibitory effects of ten Thai culinary vegetables on α-glucosidase and α-amylase, including Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum), holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum), star gooseberry (Phyllanthus acidus), galangal (Alpinia galanga), bamboo grass (Tiliacora triandra), Turkey berry (Solanum torvum), cassod tree (Senna siamea), dill (Anethum graveolens L.), noni (Morinda citrifolia), and pearl wattle (Leucaena leucocephala). All vegetables were extracted using deionized water at a 1: 10 ratio in an ultrasonic bath operating at 350 W and a frequency of 50 Hz for 30 minutes. The α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the vegetable extracts ranged from 13.42 ± 0.23% to 79.84 ± 0.47%, while the inhibitory activities against α-amylase were relatively modest, ranging from 4.82 ± 3.32% to 27.49 ± 1.67%. Cassod tree exhibited the highest α-glucosidase inhibition with the lowest IC50 at 126.38 ± 0.98 μg/mL, followed by galangal (203.17 ± 1.05 μg/mL) and holy basil (1,240 ± 20.31 μg/mL), respectively. These results may hold promise for encouraging the consumption of vegetables as a strategy for diabetes management through the targeting of key enzyme inhibition.  © 2024 Khakhanang Ratananikom et al.

TI  - Evaluation of Rumen Degradable Protein Values from Various Tropical Foliages Using in Vitro and in Situ Methods

AB  - There are no recommended methods for obtaining rumen degradable protein (RDP) values of tropical foliage to meet ruminant feed quality standards. Different methods have produced different RDP values, prompting this study to compare and adjust values of RDP in tropical foliage obtained using both in situ and in vitro methods. Nine types of tropical foliages (Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Calliandra calothyrsus, Indigofera zollingeriana, Moringa oleifera, Calopogonium mucunoides, Arachis hypogaea, Sesbania grandiflora, and Arachis pintoi) were analyzed for their chemical composition (ash, crude protein (CP), crude fiber (CF), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) using proximate analysis, Van Soest's fiber fraction, and Cornell protein fraction. The samples were then evaluated for their degradation characteristics, including dry matter degradation (DMD), organic matter degradation (OMD), and RDP in rumen using 1) conventional or first-stage in vitro rumen fermentation technique, 2) modification of the first-stage in vitro method, and 3) in situ method. The evaluation was performed in three consecutive runs using a completely randomized design for chemical analysis and a randomized complete block design for degradation study. The result shows that I. zollingeriana, M. oleifera, L. leucocephala, and G. sepium are among the best tropical foliage for ruminants due to their higher CP, DMD, OMD, and RDP values resulting from lower CF, NDF and ADF values. C. calothyrsus, with its high CP and low fiber, resulted in DMD, OMD and RDP values but its high tannin content in the foliage may be a limiting factor. Conventional and in situ produced similar degradation characteristics, significantly higher than in vitro modification. It is recommended to cultivate I. zollingeriana, M. oleifera, L. leucocephala, and G. sepium for ruminant protein supplements, and it is suggested to use standard in vitro to obtain a precise RDP value of tropical foliages. © 2023, Unique Scientific Publishers.

AB  - A novel micro-mesoporous activated carbon (SBL AC-700) is synthesized from subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) sawdust waste by direct single-stage physical activation at 700 °C for 1 h for carbon capture applications. The synthesized AC is characterized to explore various physiochemical properties like elemental composition, surface morphology and crystallinity, presence of functional groups, surface area, pore size, and pore volume. Additionally, emphasis is given to exploring the thermophysical aspects of the novel AC, the literature regarding which is scarce in the open domain. The CO2 adsorption study is carried out for a 0–1 bar pressure for temperatures ranging from 0 to 75 °C. The analysis revealed that the AC possesses a surface area of 590 m2/g and pore volume and width of 0.27 cm3/g and 1.85 nm, corresponding to a 70% microporosity with a well-developed porous structure. At 25 °C and 1 bar, a CO2 uptake of 40.54 cm3/g is achieved, corresponding to an increment of 6–202% compared to other commercials, chemically and physically activated carbons. Moreover, SBL AC-700 has a thermal conductivity of 0.095 W/m K, 8–131% higher than other benchmarks ACs and much lower specific heat of 0.82 kJ/kg K corresponding to lesser regeneration energy requirements.

TI  - Morphologic Differentiation of the Exotic Parasitoid Eupelmus pulchriceps (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae) in the Galapagos Archipelago
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180183686&doi=10.1007%2fs13744-023-01097-3&partnerID=40&md5=eceaa6c046f3a8ed89a24d42f4e2f871
AB  - The historical and geographical properties of the archipelagos allow a detailed study of species diversification, and phenotypic traits can indicate the extent of such processes. Eupelmus pulchriceps (Cameron, 1904) is an exotic species to the Galapagos archipelago, and generalist parasitoid that attacks a beetle species that consumes the seeds of the invasive shrub Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Despite extensive sampling, the wasp is recorded only in Santa Cruz and San Cristobal islands of the Galapagos archipelago. Thus, using 112 female wasps, we compare body size, proportion, and allometric differentiations within and between the two islands. There were no body size differences between islands. A PerMANOVA indicates differences between the islands and a single differentiation between two localities of one island. Allometric differences between islands were not the same for all structures. These results are consistent with the greater distance between islands than between localities and suggest a differentiation process. The variables with allometric differentiation are associated with wings and ovipositor, possibly responding to different ecological pressures. It is interesting that this parasitoid, recently arrived at the archipelago, is already showing differentiation. Also, it is essential to monitor the behavior of these wasps in the archipelago, given their potential to access other species affecting the trophic interactions of the local biota. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - Interactive Effect of Residue Quality and Agroecologies Modulate Soil C- and N-Cycling Enzyme Activities, Microbial Gene Abundance, and Metabolic Quotient
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199367953&doi=10.1155%2f2024%2f8498801&partnerID=40&md5=436f9bbdd2686d3cd2349d60887d8137
AB  - Understanding interactive effect of agroecology explained by rainfall, temperature, elevation, and biochemical composition of residues on soil microbial abundance and functions is crucial for unraveling soil ecological processes. This study aimed to investigate how agroecology and residue quality influence enzymatic activities, gene abundance, and metabolic quotient (qCO2). A field experiment was conducted using Leucaena leucocephala (LL) (high-quality residue) and Acacia decurrens (AD) (low-quality residue) in soils of highland and midland agroecologies. These residues differed in decomposability, characterized by a ratio of (lignin + polyphenol)/N of 5.0 for high-quality residue versus 21.0 for low-quality residue. Two experimental setups were employed: soil with litter mixture in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes and residues buried in the surface soil using litterbags. Soil samples were collected after 30, 120, and 270 days of incubation and analyzed for biochemical properties, enzyme activities, and the abundance of nitrifying and total archaea and bacteria. Soil respiration was also measured at different intervals in the field. qCO2 was calculated using microbial biomass (MBC) and daily respiration (DCO2). Linear mixed model (P<0.05) revealed that combined factors of agroecologies and residue qualities affected enzymatic activities, microbial abundance, soil properties, and qCO2. Agroecological differences exerted a greater influence than residue qualities. Positive and negative significant correlations (P<0.05, r = 0.27 to 0.67) were found between different C and N pools as well as enzymatic activities. Positive correlations (P<0.05) were observed between the abundance of total bacteria, total archaea, and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria versus leucine-aminopeptidases. qCO2 was influenced more by β-xylosidase, leucine-aminopeptidases, and thermolysin-like neutral metalloproteases (TLP) than by β-D-glucosidase and β-D-cellobiohydrolase. Leucine-aminopeptidases and TLP were identified as rate-limiting factors for protein and peptide decomposition, while β-xylosidase controlled hemicellulose degradation. In summary, this study provides insights into the intricate relationships between agroecology, residue quality, enzymatic activities, and microbial communities, shedding light on key processes governing soil ecological functions.  © 2024 Birhanu Agumas et al.

AB  - Dengue fever (DF) occurs worldwide and is a global health threat due to high mortality and morbidity, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. The World Health Organization is very concerned about this disease as it affects a large part of the population. About 2.5 billion people are at risk of contracting the dengue virus (DENV). DENV affects over 100 countries, including Europe and the US. Dengue fever is the most common viral disease. There are four different DENV serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), but DENV-5 serotypes have now also been found. DENV is transmitted from person to person by the bites of infected female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Unfortunately, there is no effective approved treatment for dengue and no vaccine to treat the viral infection. Researchers have turned to medicinal plants in search of natural compounds that can be used as a treatment for dengue fever. Therefore, focus is on medicinal plant extracts, which may be more effective, safer, and less toxic than synthetic drugs. Current research indicates that natural foods represent a rich potential source of novel compounds against dengue fever. From 1997 to 2012, 31 species from 24 families such as Cryptonemia crenulata, Flagellaria indica, Hippophae rhamnoides, Cladosiphon okamuranus, Castanospermum austral, Quercus lusitanica, Rhizo, Euphorbia hirta, Kaempferia parviflora, Leucaena leucocephala, Chondrus crispus, Gigartinaceae Lambda, Andrographis paniculata, Azadirachta indica, Mimosa scabrella, Momordica charantia, Andropogon citratus, Carica papaya, Cladogynos orientalis, Curcuma longa, Cymbopogon citratus, Lippia alba, Meristiella gelidium, Piper retrofractum, Psidium guajava, Ocimum Saintum, Phyllanthus urinaria, known to be active against dengue fever, were described in 61 studies. From these 11 species, about ten phytochemicals have been isolated, among which there are compounds Andrographolide, 4hydroxypanduratin A, panduratin A, Turmerone, Castanospermine, Lambda, carrageenans, Galactomanan, Kappa carrageenan, and so on that could potentially be used to treat dengue fever. Flaviviruses were found to be resistant to crude extracts and essential oils derived from 31 different species. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the nematocidal effect of four hydroalcoholic extracts (HAE) of Brosimum alicastrum (HAE-Ba), Guazuma ulmifolia (HAE-Gu), Erythrina americana (HAE-Ea) and Leucaena leucocephala (HAE-Ll) against Haemonchus contortus. The tests of egg hatching inhibition (EHI) and larval (infective larvae) mortality were used. The treatments were HAEs at concentrations of 6.25-50 mg/mL for EHI and 25-100 mg/mL for larval mortality, ivermectin (5 mg/mL, positive control) and distilled water (negative control). Data were analyzed using an ANOVA and treatments with a concentration-dependent effect were subjected to a regression analysis to determine lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90). In addition, a phytochemical analysis was performed on the extracts to identify the presence of the main secondary metabolites. The best ovicidal and larvicidal activity was observed in HAE-Gu with 96.78 % EHI at 6.25 mg/mL and 57.2 % larval mortality at 75 mg/mL. Followed by HAE-Ba showing 90 % EHI at 6.25 mg/mL and 58.0 % larval mortality at 75 mg/mL. The LC50 and LC90 of HAE-Gu on EHI were 2.7 and 4.4 mg/mL, respectively. While the LCs of this same extract on larvae were LC50= 64 and LC90= 125 mg/mL. The phytochemical analysis indicates that all extracts contain tannins, coumarins, flavonoids and terpenes. The fodder species G. ulmifolia and E. americana could be candidate plants for the control of H. contortus. © 2023 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria. All rights reserved.

AB  - In addition to chemical composition, modern formulations of ruminant rations also require data on nutrient degradation of feed ingredients in the rumen. It is related to the synchronization of nutrient requirements for rumen microbial protein synthesis and nutrient bypass for livestock production. This study aimed to determine the chemical composition and nutrient degradation kinetics from several tropical tree legume leaves using in situ method. This study was arranged based on a Completely Randomised Design with five treatments (different types of legume leaves) and six replications. Five types of local tree legume leaves were tested, namely Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Sesbania grandiflora (SG), Bauhinia purpurea (BP), Acacia mangium (AM), and Samanea saman (SS). Approximately 5 g of dried ground samples that passed through a 3 mm screen size were put into nylon bags. The bags were subsequently incubated in the rumen of two fistulated male Ongole crossbred cattle for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Parameters observed in this study were the actual degradation of dry matter (DDM), organic matter (DOM), crude protein (DCP) and their kinetic degradation profiles and effective degradation. The results showed that the chemical composition and characteristics in situ varied. S. saman had the highest crude protein content, followed by L. leucocephala, S. grandiflora, B. purpurea, and A. mangium with the values of 26.9%, 26.3%, 24.9%, 17.9%, and 14.3% (dry matter basis), respectively. Sesbania grandiflora had the lowest fiber content (neutral detergent fiber) compared to other samples with a value of 31.35%, then increased in LL SS, BP and AM samples with sequential values of 34.16%, 45.61%, 46.04% (in dry matter basis), respectively. Sesabania grandiflora had the highest effective values of degradation of dry matter, organic matter and crude protein compared to other samples, with values of 60.04%, 61.93% and 64.58%, respectively. It was concluded that each leaf of the tropical tree legume varied in chemical composition and in situ nutrient degradation characteristics. Sesbania grandiflora has the highest effective degradability value of the dry matter, organic matter and crude protein compared to other legume leaves. © 2023 Author(s).

AB  - The present study investigated the use of a biosorbent produced from Leucaena leucocephala pods for the removal of metformin from aqueous solutions. The pods were subjected to chemical and thermal treatments and were referred to as L. leucocephala modified, which was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The parameters investigated in the sorption process were temperature, contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH, and initial metformin concentration. The experimental data were in accordance with the Langmuir isothermal model. The maximum adsorption capacity reached was 56.18 mg g−1 at 313 K. In the kinetic study, stability was achieved in 300 min, with 53.24% removal, and the pseudo-first-order model agreed well with the experimental data. The thermodynamic parameters indicated a spontaneous, favorable, and exothermic reaction. The presence of NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 negatively affected metformin adsorption. Thus, the importance of the study was that a developed material showed promising results in the removal of metformin, particularly because it is an innovative material, and there are no studies in the literature on drug removal using L. leucocephala. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) levels in agricultural soils are increasing because of industrial expansion and pesticide discharge. There are few plants that tolerate heavy metals particularly Cd. NaHS as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor plays a significant role in Cd tolerance by plants reducing its toxicity. The present research was oriented to evaluate the effect of NaHS in Cd and macro-/micronutrient uptake, as well as some physical and chemical parameters in Leucaena leucocephala plants exposed to this metal. Seedlings were grown in a hydroponic system and exposed to 5 ppm of Cd and NaHS at 1, 10, and 100 μM for 3 days. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP/OES) was used to quantify Cd content and macro-/micronutrients in plant tissues. Results show a significant difference (Fisher’s LSD) in radicle length and chlorophyll but did not show effect on carotenoids content. Addition of NaHS to the media shows a significant increase in Cd uptake by root as NaHS concentration in media increased. The maximum Cd uptake (7670 ± 102 mg/kg) was found in the roots of plants exposed to 100 μM of NaHS. A significant reduction in catalase (CAT) activity was observed in the root system, which is due to Cd concentration inside tissues. Results suggested that NaHS helps to decrease the toxic effect of Cd on the growth and development of plants.

AB  - We describe the diverse community of insect herbivores and parasitoids associated with the seeds and fruits of three sympatric Fabaceae species in Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil: Inga vera, Senna multijuga and Leucaena leucocephala. A total of 5353 individual insects, representing 77 different species, were identified via morphology and DNA barcoding. The non-native L. leucocephala had the least diverse natural enemy community (N = 17 species), while two native species, I. vera and S. multijuga, were more diverse (N = 40 and N = 24 species, respectively). Individuals from the insect order Hymenoptera, a group dominated by parasitoid wasps, were the most diverse recovered from our samples in all hosts. Additionally, individual herbivore and parasitoid species were more likely to be found on a single host, with only four out of the 77 species found in more than one plant species. This includes the generalist agricultural pest herbivore, Lasioderma serricorne, found in two species, and three parasitoids connecting native S. multijuga and non-native L. leucocephala communities, hinting at recent host shifts. Furthermore, different host plant traits had complex effects on the herbivore and parasitoid communities, where seed number per fruit promoted a propagating effect on the abundance and richness at both higher trophic levels, whereas seed and fruit weight did not. We highlight the importance of including parasitoids in insect community studies because they are highly diverse and provide important ecosystem services. Additional study of the biology, behaviour and distributions of parasitoids would be advantageous to inform conservation and biological control. © 2023 Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the association of Leucaena leucocephala, and its co-inoculation with a strain of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Claroideoglomus claroideum and a local isolate of rhizobium, on the performance of associated grasses (Bouteloua gracilis, Bouteloua curtipendula and Setaria macrostachya). The mycorrhizal structures and nodulation were also studied. Three independent experiments, one for each grass species, were grown in association with L. leucocephala co-inoculated and non-inoculated, or alone (control treatment). Grasses associated with co-inoculated L. leucocephala produced a greater number of stems than those associated with non- inoculated L. leucocephala. B. gracilis and B. curtipendula grown with co-inoculated L. leucocephala accumulated higher biomass. The concentration of chlorophylls a, b and total chlorophylls in S. macrostachya were favored by the association with L. leucocephala; whereas in B. gracilis such effect was only observed for chlorophyll b. Co-inoculation promoted the development of mycorrhizal structures in the rhizosphere and the number of nodules in roots of L. leucocephala, although the percentage of effective nodules did not reflect differences due to treatments. In conclusion, the association of grasses with L. leucocephala and its inoculation with AMF and local rhizobium isolates not only promotes the development of mycorrhizal structures and nodulation, but also increases growth and the content of photosynthetic pigments in the associated grasses. © 2024 Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales una revista de acceso abierto publicada por el Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

TI  - Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent based Ultrasound-assisted extraction: A green approach for extraction of sulfhydryl and mimosine from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit seeds
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173141699&doi=10.1016%2fj.heliyon.2023.e20480&partnerID=40&md5=ffc338dd9f3fa8173083de5a4015423c
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit seeds, also known as river tamarind, contain sulfhydryl compounds that exhibit antioxidant effects. However, these seeds also possess a toxic effect from mimosine. In this study, the river tamarind seeds were extracted using a natural deep eutectic solvent (NADES) based UAE. Among six NADES compositions screened, choline chloride-glycerol (ChCl-Gly) and choline chloride-sucrose (ChCl-Suc) were selected to be further optimized using a Box-Behnken Design in the RSM. The optimization of total sulfhydryl content was performed in 17 runs using three variables, namely water content in NADES (39%, 41%, and 43%), extraction time (5, 10, and 15 min), and the liquid-solid ratio (3, 5, and 7 mL/g). The highest concentration of sulfhydryls was obtained from ChCl-Gly-UAE (0.89 mg/g sample) under the conditions of a water content in NADES of 41% (v/v) and a liquid-solid ratio of 3 mL/g for 15 min, followed by that of from ChCl-Suc-UAE extract under the conditions of water content in NADES of 43% (v/v) and the liquid-solid ratio of 3 mL/g for 10 min with total sulfhydryl level was 0.67 mg/g sample. The maceration method using 30% ethanol resulted in the lowest level of sulfhydryls with a value of 0.52 mg/g. The mimosine compounds obtained in the NADES-based UAE (ChCl-Suc and ChCl-Gly) extracts were 4.95 and 7.67 mg/g, respectively, while 12.56 mg/g in the 30% ethanol-maceration extract. The surface morphology of L. leucocephala seed before and after extraction was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of ChCl-Suc and ChCl-Gly in NADES-based UAE is more selective in attracting sulfhydryl compounds than that of 30% ethanol-maceration extraction. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of plant-based coagulant extracted from Leucaena leucocephala seeds compared with alum in removing solids from aquaculture wastewater. Water-extraction method was used to extract the active ingredients from the seeds by dissolving the seeds’ powder in distilled water at 20 g/L concentration, whereas alum was dissolved directly at the same concentration. Operation parameters of jar test including dosage, rapid-mixing speed, and settling time were optimized for the water-extracted seed solution and alum to improve the removal efficiency. The optimum operation parameters for the water-extracted seed solution and alum were dosages of 240 and 320 mg/L respectively, rapid-mixing speed 150 rpm, and settling time 40 min. At the optimum operation parameters, water-extracted seed solution had removal efficiencies of 96.32%, 92.85%, and 86%, whereas alum had removal efficiencies of 99.77%, 99.92%, and 99.92% for turbidity, total suspended solids, and color, respectively. Despite the high efficiency of the water-extracted seed solution, dissolved contaminants such as NO3, PO4, COD, and true color increased owing to the presence of organic matter in the solution. With these results, L. leucocephala seeds had high potential to be used as alternative in removing solids from aquaculture wastewater. Further studies on the extraction of active ingredients should be conducted to increase the removal efficiency and avoid side effects on the contaminants dissolved in the effluent. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.

AB  - Studies have shown that fruits of plants from the Fabaceae family harbour a diverse community of herbivorous insects and their natural enemies. Despite this observation, we still lack information on the specific interactions within these multi-trophic communities. Herein, we describe the food web of insects associated with fruits and seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae), an invasive plant in Brazil, and their relationship with plant traits including seed biomass. We found 17 species of insects distributed across three trophic levels. The main herbivore species sampled was Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae), which was responsible for most of the seed predation and associated with the highest parasitoid biodiversity (N = 10 species). Four other herbivorous species were lower in abundance, including a previously unreported Lepidopteran species with two parasitoids and one hyperparasitoid associated with it. Seeds with more mass promoted an increase in insect abundance, insect species richness, and the number of links and connectivity. We observed two native parasitoid species, Paracrias pluteus and Stenocorse suldamericanos, shift from herbivores on native plants to herbivores on the invasive L. leucocephala, consistent with a potential host shift. However, more investigation is required to ascertain the effects of recent shifts of native insect communities (on native plants) to non-native ones and their consequences on plant fitness. Our study contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of communities and food webs in unknown systems, specifically in fruits of an invasive plant, and provides information about the influence of different plant traits on these communities. © 2023 Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of Leucaena leaves (Leucaena laucochepala) supplementation on the digestibility of Ettawa Crossbred goats. Twelve Ettawa Crossbred goats during the lactation period divided into six groups were allocated in a group randomized design with two treatments and six replicates (two goats per replicate). Treatments consisted of T1 in the form of 100% Leucaena leaves and T2 in the form of 50% Leucaena leaves and 50% concentrate. This study began with the preliminary stage, adaptation stage, data collection and analysis. Data from this study were tabulated using Microsoft Excel program, then analyzed using double T-test analysis with Randomized Group Design. The results showed that the Crude Fiber Digestibility value had a significantly different effect (P<0.05), Leucaena leaves high Crude Protein content can affect digestibility to be higher than T1 which is composed of 50% Leucaena leaves + 50% concentrate. ADF digestibility value showed no significant difference (P>0.05). NDF digestibility showed no significant difference (P>0.05). Hemicellulose digestibility showed no significant difference (P>0.05). The digestibility of organic matter showed no significant difference (P<0.05). Dry matter digestibility showed significantly different effects (P<0.05). The digestibility value of crude protein showed a significantly different effect (P<0.05). The results of the study can be concluded that Leucaena leaves supplementation can increase the feed digestibility value. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - The ultrafunctional potential of zinc oxide (ZnO) and copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) has generated a great interest in using such metal oxides as remarkable and electroactive nanocomposites in the studies on potentiometry and sensors. These nano-oxides were prepared from the extract of Leucaena leucocephala seeds as an environmentally friendly process. The development of a ZnO/CuO “core-shell mcmninnm-iticocmoconan” coated copper wire film sensor was proposed as a new method for potentiometric determination of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (PSD) in pure and pharmaceutical dosage forms. With the existence of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a polymer with high molecular weight and “o-nitrophenyl octyl ether (o-NPOE) as a solvent mediator”, PSD was combined with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) to produce pseudoephedrine hydrochloride-phosphotungstate (PSD-PT) as a sensing substance. The improved sensor showed a very high sensitivity and selectivity for determining and quantifying the PSD with a linear relationship of 1.0×10-8-1.0×10-2 mol L-1. It was estimated that the regression equation was represented by the EmV = (-58.143) log [PSD] + 526.71. With the proposed sensors, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride could be effectively determined in pure and commercial product forms. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Leaf tissue analysis is a measurement of the levels of elements contained in plant leaves. In this case, the leaves can describe the amount of absorption of a nutrient because most of the assimilation results are collected in them. The nutrients that can be absorbed by plant roots are the amount of nutrients available in the soil. The use of shade trees with different types of sunlight absorption intensity causes the conditions for leaf nutrient absorption in plants to also vary. This research was needed to determine the effect of shade type on the nutrient concentration of nitrogen, (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in the leaves of Arabica coffee plants. This research was carried out at the Koperasi Ribang Gayo Musara, Pantan Musara Village, Pegasing Subdistrict, Central Aceh District, Aceh, and the Agricultural Instrument Standardization Agency (BSIP) Aceh. This research used a non-factorial Randomized Block Design with five treatments where each treatment 4 replications. Treatments consisted of types of shade plants on coffee plants, namely, control/no shade, small lamtoro shade (Leucaena leucocephala ssp. leucocephala), big lamtoro shade (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata), banana shade (Musa paradisiaca L.), avocado shade (Persea americana Mill.). The results showed that shade tree type significantly affect potassium (K) nutrient levels in coffee plant leaves. Coffee plant shaded by big lamtoro had better N, P and K nutrient levels compared to small lamtoro, banana, avocado, and control. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Mlanding tempeh is an indigenous fermented food from lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) seed that uses usar as the inoculum in its production. Lamtoro seed contains antinutritional compounds namely phytic acid and tannin, and toxin compounds namely mimosine. Antinutritional compounds decrease the quality of nutrients in mlanding tempeh. The purpose of the research was to investigate the changes in nutritional compounds, antinutritional and toxin compounds, total phenols, antioxidants activity, dietary fiber and dynamics population of microorganisms in pre-fermentation treatment in lamtoro seed during mlanding tempeh’s production. The analysis was carried out at the pre-fermentation stage, namely before the inoculation process. The result showed the change of nutrient compounds, antinutritional and toxin compounds, total phenols, antioxidants activity, dietary fiber, and dynamics population of microorganisms in pre-fermentation treatment in lamtoro seed during mlanding tempeh’s production. Moisture, protein, and fat content increased, whereas ash, carbohydrate, phytic acid, tannin, and mimosine decreased. The total phenols content, antioxidant activity, and dietary fiber content of lamtoro seed also decreased. Meanwhile, the population of microorganisms (yeast and lactic acid bacteria) increased in pre-fermentation treatment in lamtoro seed during mlanding tempeh’s production. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The use of manure, organic mulch, and legume-based fertilizers can increase soil fertility in semiarid regions. However, the effects of such practices on soils prone to desertification are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate soil fertility and herbaceous stratum yield on soils amended with different organic inputs in the desertification hotspot of Irauçuba, Ceará state, Brazil. The experiments were performed in two areas with different soils (Planosol and Cambisol), in randomized blocks with a 2 × 2 × 3 + 1 factorial design. The factors consisted of (i) mulch (presence or absence of Copernicia prunifera [carnauba palm] straw), (ii) manure (sheep or cattle), and (iii) legume-based fertilizer (Mimosa tenuiflora [jurema], Mimosa caesalpiniifolia [sabiá], and Leucaena leucocephala [leucena]), in addition to an untreated control, with three replicates. Soil chemical attributes and herbaceous stratum yield were assessed in the two areas. Positive effects of the combined use of carnauba palm straw, manures, and legume-based fertilizers on soil fertility were more evident for Planosol than for Cambisol. The combination of sheep manure with sabiá-based fertilizer in Planosol, and cattle manure and leucena-based fertilizer in Cambisol increased herbaceous stratum yield. Herbaceous stratum yield in Planosol is more responsive to the input of great amounts of soil nutrients (especially P) and it increases soil organic matter levels, while in Cambisol, herbaceous stratum yield is more associated with the ability of inputs to make nutrients readily available. The use of organic amendments can reverse, in the short-term, degradation and desertification processes of soils in the Brazilian semiarid region. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, previously known as ‘miracle tree’ because of its numerous agroforestry uses has become a serious invasive species in tropical regions. Despite the risks associated with the spread of L. leucocephala, changes in its distribution with respect to climate are poorly understood, particularly in Africa where it has been widely introduced in more than 30 countries. To provide first-line information for the management of L. leucocephala, we examined its potential distribution in Africa using ecological niche modelling. We identified bioclimatic variables that determine the global distribution of L. leucocephala, and calibrated niche models using MaxEnt and species occurrences recorded between 1973 and 2013. The potential distribution of this species was estimated from model projections in Africa based on current and future climatic conditions. We tested the hypothesis of niche conservatism for L. leucocephala by comparing its climatic niche in Africa to that of its native range. Under current conditions, L. leucocephala is constrained between 30° S and 20° N in Africa, with the broadest distribution in East Africa. High rainfall areas in Central Africa with no known records of this species hitherto, were found to be highly suitable for its establishment. We predicted a significant decrement in the extent of areas at risk of invasion by L. Leucocephala under changing climates in Africa. Our results revealed that the study species occupies a similar but non-identical climatic niche in Africa in relation to its native niche. Climate change is likely to impede the spread of L. leucocephala in Africa. © 2023, International Society for Tropical Ecology.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an environment-friendly technique that uses plants to extract contaminants like metals from soil. This has found application in waste management and possibly in future mining through phytomining. This studywanted to evaluate the metal accumulation of plants, thriving in a nickel laterite mine for Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn anddetermine their potential for phytoremediation or phytomining. The metal accumulation in crops is also highlighted fortheir possible harmful effects to humans. Samples of soil, roots, stems, leaves, and fruits were gathered. The plants wereevaluated based on their metal accumulation in the above-ground part, leaf-to-root ratio, bioaccumulation coefficient(BAC), and translocation factor (TF). The plant Leucaena leucocephala, Pennisetum polystachion, Casuarinacunning hamiana, and Mimosa pudica shows significant accumulation. The crops showed substantial amounts of metalwhich can be harmful to humans. The planting of hyper accumulator plants is recommended for future phytomining application but planting crops is highly discouraged due to possible accumulation of metals which can be harmful for humans. © 2024, IEICES/Kyushu University.

TI  - Study of nyamplung (Calophyllum inophyllum) kernel cake as an alternative protein source for ruminant feed and its effect on methane emission through in vitro
PY  - 2023

AB  - The industry of Nyamplung/tamanu (Calophyllum inophyllum) crude oil is developed massively in Indonesia. The by product of this crude oil is called nyamplung kernel cake (NKC). This study was conducted to investigate the chemical compositions, plant secondary metabolites, and in vitro digestibility of NKC as new alternative feed. In chemical compositions, the NKC contained 90.2% dry matter, 7.92% organic matter, 20.1% crude protein, 15.3% ether extract, 53.3% neutral detergent fiber, 38.2% acid detergent fiber, and 15.1% hemicellulose. In plant secondary metabolites, the NKC contained 6.47% total phenol, 1.70% total flavonoid, and 0.90% saponin. The total tannin of NKC was 0.93% consisting of condense tannin at 0.45% and hydrolysable tannin at 0.48%. The chemical compositions of NKC were similar to palm kernel cake (PKC), copra cake (CC), tamarind (Leucaena leucocephala) leaves meal (TLM), gliricida (Glircidia sepium) leaves meal (GLM), and malapari (Pongamia pinnata) kernel cake (MKC). Thus, those feedstuffs were incubated in rumen buffer for 48 h. During ruminal incubation, NKC produced the lowest methane emission without any negative effects on rumen fermentation indices. Moreover, NKC still had a similar digestibility to PKC, CC, and GLM. This study concluded that the NKC can substitute the use of PKC, CC, TLM, GLM, and MKC in the ruminant diet, which can also help to reduce methane emission through in vitro study. © 2023 Fundacion CIPAV.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, abundance, and diversity of IAPS in multiple-use zone of Initao-Libertad Protected Landscape and Seascape (ILPLS), Misamis Oriental, Philippines. Using belt-transect method, a total of 15 nested plots (20×20 m for trees, 5×5 m for herbs and shrubs, and 1×1 m for grasses and lianas) were established. Twenty-nine plant species from 18 families were identified, comprising 18 Native Species (NS), seven Non-Invasive Alien Species (NIAS), and four IAPS. The IAPS identified were Gmelina arborea, Leucaena leucocephala, Lantana camara, and Swietenia macrophylla which had the highest relative abundance of 96.83%. The Shannon-Weiner diversity indices showed very low to low diversity of 0.30 to 2.17, and an unbalanced to semi-balanced species evenness of 0.17 to 0.70. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a significant difference in relative abundance between NS and IAPS (p = 0.01576). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicated significant differences in species diversity and evenness of p = 0.03359 and 0.03343, respectively. These findings are crucial for developing IAPS control strategies in the ILPLS in the future. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil biota have strong effects on plants, but we have a poor understanding of how plant chemistry might modify these effects. We examined the effect of soil biota associated with an exotic invasive tree, Prosopis juliflora, versus that associated with native species, from seven sites across India on conspecifics and two other plant species. We then measured changes in species-specific soil biota effects (identified as plant–soil feedbacks, PSFs) when leaf leachate from P. juliflora or from native plant species was added to soil containing respective live and sterile soil inoculum. We quantified the amino acid L-tryptophan from leaf leachate of P. juliflora, Leucaena leucocephala (another invader), and two native species. We also tested effects of P. juliflora or native species soil inoculum amendment of tryptophan on P. juliflora, P. cineraria and L. leucocephala across seven sites. We then quantified the microbially metabolized derivatives of tryptophan, phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and intermediates after adding tryptophan into P. juliflora and native soils. Soil biota associated with P. juliflora generated positive effects on conspecifics and L. leucocephala, but negative effects on the native congener P. cineraria. When P. juliflora leaf leachate was added to soil with live P. juliflora inoculum, PSFs became more positive for P. juliflora and other species, compared to leaf leachate amended with sterile soil inoculum. Native leaf leachate interacted weakly with soil biota to impact biomass of conspecifics and heterospecifics. There was roughly 10× more tryptophan in the leaf leachate of P. juliflora than in the leaf leachate of other species. Tryptophan generally increased positive PSFs associated with P. juliflora relative to soil biota associated with other plant species. When tryptophan was added to live P. juliflora soil, IAA and its intermediates were produced at five of seven sites, and at four of these sites soil biota from P. juliflora had positive PSFs. Synthesis. These results provide the first experimental evidence that a chemical leached from the leaves of an invader regulates PSFs. Our results indicate that canopy effects and PSFs, which are usually studied independently, can interact in ways that strongly affect conspecifics and neighbouring species. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The current study aimed to explore the traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous communities in Bahawalpur and adjacent regions, Pakistan, to treat a variety of diseases with a particular focus on the usage of ethnomedicinal wild plants. The objective of the study was to collect and evaluate local and indigenous knowledge regarding the quantity, variety, use and management of resources by the people. Data were gathered using Rapid Appraisal Approach (RAA), which involved in-person interviews. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics methods as well as common ethnobotanical analytical techniques viz. use value (UV), relative frequency of citation (RFC), informant consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL), relative importance (RI), frequency index (FI), family use value (FUV), family importance value (FIV), popular therapeutic use value (POPUT), plant part value (PPV), preference ranking (PR), cultural significance index (CSI), rank order priority (ROP) and Jaccard index (JI). A total of 158 plant species from 49 families were identified. The perennial herbs made up 72% of the documented species of therapeutic plants. There were 21 different species in each of the two major plant families i.e., Fabaceae and Poaceae. The maximum ICF were calculated for gonorrhea and paralysis (1.0) and maximum POPUT was calculated for skin disorders (0.088) and cough (0.077), respectively. The maximum UV was found for Rumex crispus (0.57) and RI for Leucaena leucocephala (4.38). Heliotropium crispum had the highest FL value (83%) and is used to treat kidney diseases. Alhagi maurorum had the greatest RFC (0.009) and FI (0.93). Arecaceae (0.45) and Fabaceae (13.39%) had the greatest FUV while Poaceae and Fabaceae had the highest FIV (13.29 for each). Leaves were the most frequently used plant part (35%). Alhagi maurorum (4.0) and Rumex crispus (32.57) had the highest CSI and ROP, respectively. The maximum JI (28.31) was calculated for Cholistan desert. These results showed the local population’s reliance on herbal remedies to treat prevalent illnesses. To demonstrate the viability of species, it′s crucial to emphasize both the use and conservation of these species. Adopting innovative applications, enhancing their value, and prioritizing the protection of multipurpose wild plants in inhabited environments is vital. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Enhancing Nutrient Intake, Digestibility, Rumen Fermentation, and Blood Metabolites in Kacang Goats Using Compost-Enriched Hydroponic Maize Fodder
PY  - 2024
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212795777&doi=10.5398%2fTASJ.2024.47.4.475&partnerID=40&md5=933d2d9c3f7aeced683357e1c6e7f9ad
AB  - This study aimed to enhance nutrient intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation, and blood metabolites in Kacang goats by substituting grass silage with hydroponic maize fodder enriched with fermented compost tea. The compost tea, prepared by fermenting organic compost with sugared water + 40 mL EM4 for 3 days, was used to grow maize fodder hydroponically. Four male Kacang goats (13.05 ± 1.32 kg) were assigned to four dietary treatments in a 4x4 latin square design over four 15-day periods (10 days for adaption, 5 days for data collection). The treatments were: 60% grass silage + 10% Leucaena leucocephala + 30% concentrate (control, FCG0); 30% grass silage + 30% hydroponic maize fodder + 10% L. leucocephala + 30% concentrate (FCG1); 15% grass silage + 45% hydroponic maize fodder + 10% L. leucocephala + 30% concentrate (FCG2); and 60% hydroponic maize fodder + 10% L. leucocephala + 30% concentrate (FCG3). Goats on FCG3 had lower (p<0.05) dry matter intake (152.48 g/day) compared to FCG0 (226.83 g/day). Nutrient digestibility, including organic matter and crude fiber, improved (p<0.05) in FCG3 (77.21% and 66.12%) compared to FCG0 (76.62% and 52.27%). Total volatile fatty acids (VFA) increased in FCG3 (131.54 mM) compared to FCG0 (111.73 mM). However, no significant differences were observed in ruminal ammonia (NH3-N), ruminal pH, or blood metabolites. In conclusion, substituting grass silage with hydroponic maize fodder enriched with fermented compost tea up to 75% of the diet improved digestibility and rumen fermentation without negatively affecting intake, digestibility, or blood metabolites in Kacang goats, suggesting its potential as an alternative feed. However, complete substitution (100%) reduced intake, indicating challenges at higher substitution levels. Copyright © 2024 by Authors, published by Tropical Animal Science Journal.

AB  - In 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis program collected forest and tree measurements from 37 plots among three forest communities on the islands of Rota, Saipan, and Tinian in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). A total of 36 tree species and 132 dominant vascular plant species were recorded, including 28 invasive species. Invasive plant species covered most of the forest area, and 9 of the top 20 most dominant nontree plant species were invasive. The small tree Leucaena leucocephala (tångantångan), comprising by far the largest invasive component in CNMI, made up a substantial percentage of damaged trees and was the only tree species removed by people between inventories (2004–2015). Tree damages from coconut rhinoceros beetles and forest disturbance from wild pigs were not observed. Rota had the least disturbed forests among inventoried islands, with the most native forest—about two-thirds of the total forest area was undisturbed. About 60 percent of the forest area on Saipan and 100 percent of the forest area on Tinian were disturbed. Tree disease was the most prevalent disturbance and damage type in 2015. Vegetation suppression due to vines occurred in about one-third of the total forest area. Disturbance from live-stock affected about 10 percent of the total forest area (mostly on Tinian). This was roughly the same situation as in the 2004 inventory. In both inventories, tree stem density was about 1,400 stems per acre, and forests were dominated by small trees less than 3 inches in diameter at breast height (DBH). About 11 percent of these trees grew into the 3.0–4.9-inch DBH size class between inventories, and although the mean DBH, tree height, and stem density did not change significantly between 2004 and 2015 in CNMI forests, there was a significant increase in mean basal area per acre. © 2024, USDA Forest Service.

TI  - Comparative study of the combustion, pyrolysis and gasification processes of Leucaena leucocephala: Kinetics and gases obtained
PY  - 2023

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a fast-growing leguminous biomass with great energetical and value-added chemical compounds potential (saccharides, biogas, bio-oil, etc.). Using the thermogravimetric and derivative thermogravimetric curves, the different trends followed by L. leucocephala during pyrolysis, 0.25 equivalence ratio (ER) of gasification, 0.50 equivalence ratio of gasification and combustion were analyzed, and the activation energies were obtained by Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM) method. Gas samples were collected through adsorption tubes during the gasification at 0.25 ER and 0.50 ER to observe the distribution of the main chemical products in this process by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and were compared with pyrolysis products. It was found that small amounts of oxygen have changes in the kinetics of the process, leading to significant decreases in the activation energy at the beginning of the degradation of components such as cellulose (from 170 to 135 kJ mol−1 at 0.25 conversion at 0.50 ER gasification). The activation energy of lignin disintegration was also reduced (342 kJ mol−1), assimilating the beginnings of gasification processes such as the Boudouard reaction. 0.50 ER gasification is potentially an interesting process to obtain quality bio-oil, since a large amount of hexane is detected (44.96%), and value-added oxygenated intermediates such as alcohols and glycols. Gasification at 0.25 ER, on the other hand, is much more similar to pyrolysis, obtaining a wide variety of short-chain compounds resulting from the disintegration of the main lignocellulosic components, especially ketones such as 1-hydroxypropan-2-one (19.48%), and notable amount of furans and anhydrosugars like d-allose (5.50%). © 2023

AB  - The study was carried out between July and October 2022 at the sub-station of the Faculty of Agriculture Research and Teaching farm to assess the reproductive performance of Archachatina marginata fed the leguminous Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal as feed additive. 208 adult snails were randomly partitioned into 4 treatments and 4 repetitions of 13 comparable snails (weight and size). The treatment T0 (control) received only the experimental diet as described while three other treatments received not only diet but, L. leucocephala leaf meal at 0.25%,0.5% and 0.75% for a period of 12 weeks. In each treatment, every morning, the substrate of each breeding bucket was stirred entirely and minutely to collect the eggs to determine the laying and morphometric characteristics of the eggs. The eggs were then placed 10 cm deep in loose soil substrates until hatching to evaluate the characteristics of the fecundity. The unhatched eggs were opened, and the state of embryonic development observed to determine early embryonic mortality rate and late embryonic mortality. At the end of the experiment, animals of each replicate were sacrificed; the hemolymph was collected determine the total cholesterol and protein. The results showed that the characteristics of reproduction were affected with graded level of L. leucocephala. The highest number of eggs laid (17.29 ± 13.44) and the number of clutches (268.91) was recorded in animals receiving 0.5% and 0.75% L. leucocephala in the diet respectively while the highest value of fecundation rate (95.50 ± 8.80), hatch rate (94.55 ± 9.36), and hatchability (98.99 ± 3.15) was registered in the treatment that received 0.75%. The highest value of total protein and cholesterol was recorded in the same treatment. In conclusion 0.75% of L. leucocephala can be added in the diet of adult snail to increase its reproductive performance. © (2024), (Universidad del Zulia). All rights reserved.

AB  - Our hypothesis is that the total replacement of ground corn grain (GCG) by cactus pear (CP) in association with 70% of leucaena hay (LH) increases dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility and nitrogen metabolism and maintains the feeding behavior of cattle. The objective was to evaluate the effects of inclusion of these feeds on the nutritional parameters and nitrogen metabolism of cattle. Eight steers, average age of 12 months, weight of 267.5 ± 15 kg, were distributed into two simultaneous 4 × 4 Latin squares according to a 2 × 2 factorial scheme, in which the first factor evaluated was different proportions of inclusion of LH (50 or 70% DM basis), and the second factor was the total replacement of GCG with CP. There was lower DM intake in animals fed with 70% LH. There was an interaction between the factors for DM digestibility, in which the animals fed CP did not differ regardless of the inclusion of LH, but for animals without CP, the greater inclusion of LH decreases DM digestibility. The inclusion of CP decreased free water intake. There was an interaction for total water intake (WI), in which the animals fed without CP presented similarity for this, while in the inclusion of CP, the animals fed 70% of LH presented higher WI. Also, lower values of chewing were observed for animals fed with CP. The replacement of GCG with CP improves the efficiency of nitrogen utilization in the rumen. The inclusion of 70% LH depresses intake. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The objective of the present experiment was to determine fatty acids composition of Albizia falcataria (AF), Calliandra calothyrsus (CC), Leucaena leucocephala (LL), and Sesbania grandiflora (SG), both in the leaves and in the in vitro rumen fermentation system. Ground leaf samples of AF, CC, LL and SG were determined for their fatty acid (FA) profiles. The samples (200 mg DM each) were incubated in vitro in a rumen:buffer solution (1:2 v/v ratio) at 39°C for 24 h, either with or without the addition of linseed oil, conducted in four replicates. Following the incubation, the fermentation medium was subjected to fatty acid determination. Results revealed that the order of PUFA contents in the leaves from highest to lowest were CC>LL>SG>AF. Proportion of MUFA was particularly high in CC. Notably, the α-linolenic acid (ALA) concentration within the rumen after the in vitro incubation exhibited in the CC legume compared to the other observed legumes (P<0.05). Additionally, the in vitro incubation of CC resulted in the lowest concentration of stearic acid. The findings lead to the conclusion that CC exhibits more favorable FA profiles in the rumen when compared to the tropical forage tree-legumes in the present experiment. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - This chapter presents the main results of the research carried out in Cuba with Leucaena leucocephala and Tithonia diversifolia, and the main recommendations for their use in the livestock sector. The technology developed for Leucaena leucocephala during the 1980s and part of the 1990s for the use of this arboreal legume was transferred to producers since the mid-1990s. In that decade, a National Program was developed for the introduction of silvopastoral systems with Leucaena leucocephala in the livestock sector. Studies with Tithonia diversifolia began in 2006 and are still being developed based on materials (ecotypes) collected in the country. As a result of this process new technologies are available for its use in grazing or cut and carry systems both for ruminants and monogastrics. Starting in 2015, a National Program has been running in the productive sector for the use of protein plants in animal feeding, including Tithonia diversifolia. This review details the establishment, nutritional quality and management practices to optimize plant and animal production with this shrub and describes its impact on the environment and animal health. Finally, the factors that limited the adoption of these plants and expectations for the future are described. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Secondary growth is the most dynamic developmental aspect during the terrestrialization of plants. The development of secondary xylem tissue composed of thick-walled cells with characteristic changes in its structure and chemistry facilitates the growth and development of woody plants. In the present study, the chemical composition of the secondary xylem of juvenile and mature wood from the branch and main trunk of Leucaena leucocephala, has been investigated and the differences established. The biochemical analysis of different cell wall components in the mature wood of the main trunk revealed high holocellulose and α-cellulose and less lignin content in the juvenile wood while its syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio was less than for the mature wood. As compared to the branch xylem, concentration of cell wall polysaccharides and lignin content was higher in both juvenile and mature wood collected from the main trunk. Thioacidolysis and GC-MS analysis of wood lignin from juvenile and mature wood showed that an increased concentration in lignin content in mature wood is associated with a corresponding increase in S/G ratio. The structural information of the acetylated lignin was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Our results indicate that the mature wood from the main trunk is superior in pulp yielding and lignin degradability as compared to the juvenile wood of the branch and trunk. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Consumption of wild edible plants has played a significant role in supplying food and nutritional requirements and increasing the health status of underprivileged communities in many rural parts of the world. The present investigation was to evaluate the nutritive value, mineral content, vitamin content, and toxicological status of ten wild edible plants viz. Phlogocanthus thrysiflorus, Lasia spinosa, Eriosema chinense, Polygonum microcephalum, Nasturtium indicum, Spinacia oleracea, Malva parviflora, Leucaena leucocephala, Elsholtzia blanda, and Sonchus oleraceus, consumed by the tribal people of Meghalaya State in India, as their nourishment. All investigated plants were collected from different areas of Meghalaya state, and their nutraceutical potential was evaluated following the standard food analysis methods described in the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. Protein contents were very high in several species, especially in N. indicum (24.75%). Carbohydrate content ranged from 5.86% (S. oleracea) to 21.28% (E. chinense). All plants contained significant amounts of minerals (Na, K, Ca, Fe, Zn, Mg), and water soluble vitamins such as vitamin C (0.24–5.79 mg/100 g of dry plant material), B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B9. Antinutrients such as oxalate, phytate, saponin and heavy metal (Pb, Cr, Cd, Hg) levels in all plants were estimated below fatal levels. The consequences of haemolytic toxicity, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of water extracts of wild edible plants ensure safety for human consumption. Therefore, this study focuses on the utilization of wild edible plants as a source of dietary supplements, which may result in the commercialization of the produce; hence, it assesses consumer perceptions towards wild edible plants in India. © 2023 SAAB

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the fermentative profile, fermentative losses, microbial populations, aerobic stability, chemical composition, and in situ degradability of total mixed ration silages based on forage cactus associated with xerophytic legumes. The treatments consisted of four total mixed ration silages based on forage cactus and concentrate (TMRC), associated with legumes such as Gliricidia sepium (TMRG), Leucaena (TMRL), and Senna obtusifolia (TMRS). There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) among the evaluated treatments for the pH and NH3-N (% of total N) variables. The pH values remained within the ideal range, from 4.2 to 4.4, and the NH3-N content ranged from 2.21 to 0.85%. The dry matter recovery for the evaluated treatments averaged 89%. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts ranged from 5.0 to 6.3 log CFU/g among the evaluated silages, with TMRC presenting the lowest count at 5 log CFU/g in comparison with the total mixed ration silages associated with legume plants. All of the total mixed ration silages associated with legumes presented an average mold count of 3.3 log CFU/g. Yeast populations were observed only for TMRG at 5 log CFU/g. A higher aerobic stability was observed for TMRC, followed by TMRG and then TMRS. In conclusion, the total mixed ration silages associated with G. sepium and S. obtusifolia can be recommended based on their fermentation and nutritional value. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The consumption of legume seeds has benefits for human nutrition and health. Seeds of Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena esculenta are fast-growing legumes that are used for a variety of purposes. In general, they are used to preserve/restore the soil; the foliage can be used as fodder for livestock and the seeds for human consumption in rural populations. Leucaena seeds are a source of nutrition, since they contain proteins, carbohydrates and lipids (including omega 3, 6 and 9 unsaturated acids). The protein fraction has shown pharmaceutical effects of interest (analgesic, lipolytic, emollient, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant and anti-diabetic) and some techno-functional properties for the food industry. However, the main limitation to the human consumption of leucaena seeds is the presence of mimosine, an antinutrient that produces side effects such as alopecia, growth retardation, cataracts and infertility in animals. In this sense, some technological processes that could contribute to its decrease. This work was carried out at the Nutraceuticals Department of the Interdisciplinary Research Center for Integral Regional Development, Oaxaca Unit, Mexico. A comprehensive and integrative review of research work carried out in different parts of the world was conducted. The bibliographic search was carried out from January 2020 to January 2022. Several databases such as Scopus, Latindex, Dialnet, Redalyc.org, FAO and Academic Google were explored. A total of 81 documents were used to prepare this review document. This review integrates aspects related to the potential use of leucaena seeds in human nutrition: nutritional composition, pharmacological, techno-functional properties, the processes to improve digestibility and reduce toxicity. © 2023, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

AB  - Green chemistry methods are now an intriguing field of study in agriculture, particularly in pest management. For this reason, novel approaches for the more efficient manufacturing of nanoparticles with improved biological characteristics have been developed. Because nanoparticle production is faster, this method is more eco-friendly and less toxic than old methods. The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Leucaena leucocephala, Mentha aquatica, and Zingiber officinale extracts and their antibacterial activity against Pectobacterium cartovorum, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Xanthomonas axonopodis. The results showed that spectroscopic and microscopic methods, such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealed absorption peaks for Ll-AgNPs at 415 nm, 420 nm for Ma-AgNPs, and 430 nm for Zo-AgNPs, indicating the silver nature of the prepared colloidal samples. The TEM images revealed the quasi-spherical morphology of NPs with an average size of 12.51, 10.63, and 10.26 nm for Ll-AgNPs, Ma-AgNPs, and Zo-AgNPs. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure with crystallite. While distinctive peaks in an investigation using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy showed that several biomolecules were attached to AgNPs, antibacterial activity was evaluated by an inhibitory zone test, which showed high efficiency against P. cartovorum, A. tumefaciens, and X. axonopodis, with an antibacterial function comparable to L. leucocephala, M. aquatica, and Z. officinale extract. The green production of silver nanoparticles has the potential to be a useful tool in pest management strategies against phytopathogenic bacteria. © 2024, Trans Tech Publications Ltd.

AB  - Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L. Moench) is a beneficial vegetable and oil crop that has found valuable use as food, paper, medicine, and oil. However, because of climate change, a lack of better okra cultivars that can resist drought has hampered okra production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and across the world. This study aimed to investigate the economic production of this vegetable in a forest setting. The okra (A. esculentus L.) experiment was conducted underneath three forest trees (i.e. Albizia lebbeck, Melia azedarach, and Leucaena leucocephala) in the agroforestry area. A single-factor Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications was utilised. The sample was then separated into three groups: okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry, okra-M. azedarach agroforestry, and okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry. The findings of the study revealed that okra production had differed significantly in three agroforestry practices. The fresh okra yield was highest (10.20 ton/ha) in the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry. The okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry (9.10 ton/ha) came in second, while the lowest yield was in the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry (8.90 ton/ha). Moreover, the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry recorded the maximum benefit–cost ratio (3.97) for economic performance. This ratio was 21% and 14% higher compared to the respective performance of the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry and okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry. However, the highest amount of carbon sequestration (238.90 ton/ha/yr) was measured in the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry as well as (229.80 ton/ha/yr) in the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry practice. Finally, the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry practice would significantly increase production, touching financial benefit and ensuring sound environmental quality using the vacant woodlot space. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Human encroachment and rapid usage of antibiotics, and toxic chemicals have given rise to fatal waterborne diseases and drinking water crises. This work focuses on the phytofabrication of silver nanoparticle-doped polyurethane membranes (PUM) for wastewater treatment via amoxicillin degradation and its antimutagenic potential. Fresh leaf extracts of Acokanthera oppositifolia and Leucaena leucocephala were utilized for the reduction and capping of silver ions. The structural properties of nanoparticles were studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive analysis (EDAX), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The ability of a polyurethane membrane embedded with silver nanoparticles to remove amoxicillin and residual antimicrobial in treated water was also tested. Additionally, antimutagenic activity against Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA 98 and 100) with 2-aminofluorene and sodium azide mutagens was investigated in filtered water. The effectiveness of the developed membrane was assessed in a sewage sample using the catalase test and plating on an agar plate to estimate the reduction in the microbial population. The finding reveals that the membranes doped with nanoparticles of Leucaena leucocephala demonstrated the highest amoxicillin degradation (94%) and antimutagenic (99.0%) with pseudo-first-order kinetics R2 of 0.96. The microbial population was reduced from 1.13×105 to 3.04×102 and 2.16×102 CFU/mL after filtration by PUM-doped nanoparticles of Acokanthera oppositifolia and Leucaena leucocephala, respectively. The results conclude that polyurethane membranes doped with silver nanoparticles are very effective in wastewater treatment and hold great promise for wastewater remediation applications.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The coffee berry borer (CBB), a primary pest in Indonesia, causes significant damage to coffee fruits and beans, necessitating effective control measures. This study evaluated the efficacy of a synthetic bioethanol-methanol mixture trap for capturing beetles and mitigating their impact. The experiment was conducted in two plots: Plot A, with a Leucaena leucocephala shade density of 19.5%, and Plot B, with a shade density of 13.5%. The attractant mixture used in the traps was prepared in a 1:2 ratio of bioethanol to methanol. Attractant traps were hung on coffee trees at a height of 1.2 to 1.5 meters above the ground, and beetle populations were collected weekly over a nine-week period. Damage to coffee fruits and seeds was assessed in the first, fourth, and eighth weeks. The extent of seed damage was categorized into two groups: ≤50% damage and >50% damage. Plot A, with denser shade, exhibited a significantly higher beetle capture rate of 83.26%, compared to 16.74% in Plot B. Beetle population dynamics fluctuated, peaking during the sixth week of trapping and declining thereafter until the ninth week. The higher shade density and denser coffee canopy in Plot A were associated with an increased beetle population. The use of the bioethanol-methanol attractant traps significantly reduced seed damage in both damage categories (≤50% and >50%). The results demonstrate that the bioethanol-methanol mixture is an effective tool for monitoring and controlling CBB populations, thereby minimizing fruit and seed damage. © 2024 EScience Press.

AB  - The textile industry is one of the industries that produces wastewater with complex contents and has the potential to pollute the environment. Consequently, wastewater treatment is required to prevent this problem. The utilization of natural coagulants to treat dye wastewater has been carried out by various researchers. However, most of the research only uses a single dye as the wastewater model, despite the complex nature of the real wastewater. Therefore, in this study crude extract of Leucaena leucocephala seed was used to coagulate single and binary dye mixtures with Congo red and Tartrazine as the model substance. The coagulation was carried out by varying the initial pH (3-9), dose of coagulant (50-1150 mg eq BSA/L) and the initial dye concentration (50-100 mg/L). It was found that Leucaena crude extract has successfully removed 99.54% of the Congo red (pH 3; dose 650 mg eq BSA/L) and 53.2% (pH 3; dose 1150 mg eq BSA/L) of Tartrazine at 50 mg/L single dye wastewater. The removal of 50 mg/L binary mixture was 94.4 and 54.6% for Congo red and Tartrazine, respectively, at pH 3 and coagulant dose 1050 mg eq BSA/L. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - Rhizospheric microbial communities improve the effectiveness of hyperaccumulators in the phytoremediation of heavy metals. However, limited access to tailing dams and inadequate assessment of plants’ phytoremediation potential limit the characterization of native accumulators, hindering the effectiveness of local remediation efforts. This study evaluates the heavy metal sequestration potentials of Pennisetum purpureum, Leucaena leucocephala, and Pteris vittata and their associated rhizospheric microbial communities at the Marlu and Pompora tailing dams in Ghana. The results indicate shoot hyperaccumulation of Cd (334.5 ± 6.3 mg/kg) and Fe (10,647.0 ± 12.6 mg/kg) in P. purpureum and L. leucocephala, respectively. Analysis of rhizospheric bacterial communities revealed the impact of heavy metal contamination on bacterial community composition, associating Fe and Cd hyperaccumulation with Bacillus, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas species. This study reports the hyperaccumulation potentials of L. leucocephala and P. purpureum enhanced by associated rhizosphere bacterial communities, suggesting their potential application as an environmentally friendly remediation process of heavy metals contaminated lands. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background and Objective: Interest in improving the agronomic traits of Leucaena tarramba has relatively increased to select productive varieties by plant breeding through gamma irradiation. Therefore, assessing the study of genetic diversity in Leucaena tarramba using RAPD markers is an important initial step to understand the genetic makeup of this species and its potential for improvement. Materials and Methods: In this study, RAPD markers was used to assess the genetic variability of some individuals based on the dose of gamma radiation treatment. By 10 primers used, four primers have successfully amplified the bands, consisting of OPA-05, OPA-09, OPD-03 and OPA-18 primers. Results: The informative band average of 3.25 NPB, 1.25 number of NMB and polymorphism of 21.32%. The genetic profiles such as, PIC, MI and EMR averaged 0.35, 17.60 and 44.50 per primer, respectively. Analysis of RAPD markers with dendrogram clustering revealed no significant genetic differences between Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena tarramba. Irradiation dosages ranging from 250-750 Gy are closely linked, while a dose of 500 Gy shows the highest genetic distance. Conclusion: The informative band indicating a high level of effectiveness and reliability of the markers applied where 500 Gy is the most distant genetic relationship compared to other treatments. Furthermore, primer selection including OPA-05, OPA-09, OPD-03 and OPA-18, serves as a valuable information in biomolecular analysis of mutant Leucaena tarramba. © 2024 Purnama Isti Khaerani et al.

AB  - Translocation of endangered plant species and facilitating in situ regeneration require knowledge of the factors that define suitable habitat characteristics. Four approaches were employed to define how antecedent and contemporary plant identity influenced Cycas seedling growth and survival in Guam, Yap, and the Philippines. Cycas micronesica K.D. Hill or Cycas nitida K.D. Hill & A. Lindstr. seedlings growing beneath the canopy of the maternal parent tree reached 100% mortality in 4 to 8 year. Cycas micronesica seedlings planted beneath a conspecific male adult tree reached 68% mortality in two years while seedlings planted away from a conspecific individual exhibited 100% survival. Cycas micronesica seedlings planted beneath monostands of invasive Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit or Vitex parviflora Juss. reached 40% mortality in two years while seedlings planted in adjacent native forest cover exhibited 100% survival. Cycas micronesica seedlings planted in soil conditioned for 9 months by conspecifics, heterospecific native species, Carica papaya L., L. leucocephala, or V. parviflora exhibited the greatest growth in the soils conditioned by heterospecific natives and the least growth in the soils conditioned by the three invasive species. The seedlings growing in soil conditioned by conspecifics exhibited the most coralloid roots and the greatest shoot:root ratio. These studies confirmed that the identity of antecedent and competitive plants strongly influenced the longevity and growth of Cycas seedlings. Conservationists may improve outcomes by avoiding degraded forests that have experienced invasive plant species when positioning translocation projects. Planting Cycas seedlings in biodiverse native forest but away from a conspecific individual may lead to the greatest success in population recovery. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems have been promoted as part of a strategy to improve livestock productivity and ecosystem services in the Cesar River Valley, Colombia. Between 2014 and 2017, patterns of diversity, structure, and composition of the vegetation (> 2.5 cm DBH) were studied in 35 plots of 1000 m2 located in silvopastoral systems, conventional pastures, and forests in cattle farms of the region. A total of 1852 individuals were registered, distributed in 281 morphospecies, 109 genera, and 44 families. The most abundant families were Fabaceae (35%), Bignoniaceae (7.5%), and Myrtaceae (6.7%). Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Eucalyptus cf. tereticornis Sm., and Roseodendron chryseum (S.F. Blake) Miranda were the most abundant species. Forest fragments and riparian forests presented the highest values for plant density, canopy cover, leaf index, the total volume of vegetation, and species richness, followed by paddocks with scattered trees and mixed fodder banks. The largest trees were found in the relicts of forests and paddocks with scattered trees (Peltogyne purpurea Pitter., Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Jacq.) Griseb., Anacardium excelsum (Bertero & Balb.) Skeels., Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn., and Albizia saman (Jacq.) Merr.). Silvopastoral arrangements contribute to landscape connectivity and complement the role of forest fragments to conserve 14.2 % of the tree species in the Cesar River Valley. However, restoring this landscape requires conserving and connecting existing forest fragments, scaling up livestock systems with trees and shrubs, and integrating a greater diversity of native species across all land uses. © 2023, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - A review synthesizing the research on the quality and use of Cratylia argentea forage to create incentives for its use in animal production systems in the tropics is presented. The species has been extensively evaluated, mainly in tropical America, to develop it as a shrub legume for infertile, acid soils as an alternative to Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium that are not adapted to these soils. This review includes a synthesis and discussion of research findings with C. argentea forage on (1) nutritive value, including secondary compounds, (2) alternative uses in animal production systems, and (3) live weight gain and milk production. The strength of the species is its drought tolerance and high protein content that results in increased milk yield and liveweight gain when grazed in association with grasses, particularly in the dry season. Supplementation of fresh or ensiled cratylia to grazing animals usually results in increased carrying capacity of the pasture and milk yield for cows of medium to high genetic potential. Its deficiency is the low acceptability of fresh forage by animals with no previous experience and high demand for labor when used in cut and carry systems. The issue of low adoption is addressed and suggestions for future research are presented. © 2024 Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales is an open-access journal published by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT).

AB  - Using foliage of woody species as soil cover (SC) in agroforestry systems is an agroecological technique which may help to confront great challenges to food production, including conservation of soil moisture, provision of nutrients to the soil, and weed control. This study evaluated the effect of adding foliage of Leucaena leucocephala and Guazuma ulmifolia as SC on diversity, abundance, biomass, and potential for suppression of weeds. Eight treatments were established based on addition or not of foliage of woody species as SC to maize crop between alleys of the woody species. Richness, density, diversity, and production of weed biomass at 35, 65, and 95 days after germination of maize were recorded, and the potential for weed suppression was calculated. The study identified 47 weed species belonging to 18 families; no significant effect of addition of foliage on diversity and density of weeds was found. Production of biomass was significantly greater in the control treatment without woody species or SC than in the other treatments, while the greatest potential for suppression (40%) was found for the treatment with SC of foliage of both woody species. It was concluded that addition of foliage of L. leucocephala and G. ulmifolia as SC reduces weed biomass, increasing potential for weed suppression. Therefore, use of foliage of these species in alley cropping agroforestry systems contributes to weed control. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to optimize the production of bio-oil from Leucaena leucocephala wood using a fluidized bed reactor. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the fast pyrolysis through three operational parameters: pyrolysis temperature, nitrogen flow rate, and temperature of the first condensation stage. The optimum conditions obtained for bio-oil production were 500 °C, 26.4 L min–1, that is, about 3.3 times the minimum fluidization flow, and 80 °C, respectively. The bio-oil obtained under optimum conditions was of good quality and did not require further treatment. Physical properties of the bio-oil were analysed according to ASTM D7544-12. In addition, the chemical composition of the non-condensed gases and bio-oil were identified using GC–MS. The non-condensed gases were found to contain mainly ketones and lignin derivatives, while the bio-oil contained cyclic ketones, alcohol ethers, aromatic alcohols, and lignin derivatives. The study found that increasing the pyrolysis temperature did not significantly increase the yield of H2 and CO for syngas production. Regarding the solid obtained, a large amount of unreacted material (66.7 wt.%) is generated at 400 °C, and as the temperature is increased, a high-quality biochar is obtained. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Soil anti-erodibility is closely related to soil physical and chemical properties. Erodibility studies can reveal trends in the changes in soil properties during ecological restoration and promote soil erosion control and prevention. The soils of six typical vegetation types in debris flow fans of Jiangjiagou Valley in Dongchuan District, Kunming City, were selected as research objects. To evaluate soil anti-erodibility, a comprehensive analysis of soil anti-erodibility indicators was performed using principal component analysis through field sampling at the study site and laboratory data processing. The results revealed the following facts: (1) Compared with the other five vegetation types, soil total porosity, water content, water-holding capacity, organic matter, and total nitrogen content of bare land were the lowest among all six types, whereas unit weight was the highest, indicating that the soil structure and quality of bare land were relatively poor. (2) The comprehensive soil antierodibility indices of different vegetation types in the debris flow fans of Jiangjiagou Valley followed the order of: Eucalyptus robusta forest > cornland > Heteropogon contortus grassland > Leucaena leucocephala forest > Desmodium racemosum shrub > bare land. (3) The 12 indicators characterizing soil anti-erodibility at the study site can be simplified into six indicators: total porosity, soil water content, soil unit weight, capillary water-holding capacity, organic matter content, and anti-erodibility index. The optimal linear model was obtained by regression fitting with a comprehensive index of soil anti-erodibility: Y = 0.181X1 + 0.058X4 - 1.342X5 + 0.213X7 + 0.115X9 + 0.082X12+ 2.191. Overall, vegetation restoration of debris flow fans in Jiangjiagou Valley improved soil anti-erodibility, and the improvement effect of Eucalyptus robusta forest, cornland, and Heteropogon contortus grassland was significantly greater than that of Leucaena leucocephala forest and Desmodium racemosum shrub. These results provide basic data and theoretical support for vegetation restoration, soil improvement, and the ecological reconstruction of debris flow fans in dry-hot valleys. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - Bio-oil upgrading to produce biofuels and chemicals has become an attractive topic over the past decade. However, the design of cost- and performance-effective catalysts for commercial-scale production remains a challenge. Herein, commercial titania (TiO2) was used as the support of cobalt (Co)-based catalysts (Co/TiO2) due to its low cost, high availability, and practicability for commercialization in the future. The Co/TiO2 catalysts were made with two different forms of TiO2 (anatase [TiO2–A] and rutile [TiO2–R]) and comparatively evaluated in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 4-propylguaicol (4PG), a lignin-derived model compound. Both Co/TiO2 catalysts promoted the HDO of 4PG following a similar pathway, but the Co/TiO2–R catalyst exhibited a higher activity in the early stages of the reaction due to the formation of abundant Ti3+ species, as detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and hydrogen–temperature programed reduction (H2–TPR) analyses. On the other hand, the Co/TiO2–A catalyst possessed a higher acidity that enhanced propylcyclohexane production at prolonged reaction times. In terms of reusability, the Co/TiO2–A catalyst showed a higher stability (less Co leaching) and reusability compared to Co/TiO2–R, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses. The HDO of the real bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala revealed that the Co/TiO2–A catalyst could convert high oxygenated aromatics (methoxyphenols, dimethoxyphenols, and benzenediols) to phenols and enhanced the phenols content, hinting at its potential to produce green chemicals from bio-feedstock. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Coffee is a group of plants that require partial light (C3), whose cultivation combines the use of shade trees and cultivated plants with the aim of increasing production and maintaining the microclimate around the cultivated plants. The shade provided by shade trees will have a significant effect on soil temperature and water content. The growth and development of a cultivated plant is strongly influenced by water content, on the other hand, water content also affects soil temperature. The optimal air temperature needed by Arabica coffee plants is 18-21°C, while the soil temperature suitable for Arabica coffee plants is 21°C. The research was needed to determine the effect of shade tree type on the soil temperature of Arabica coffee plants. This research was at the Koperasi Ribang Gayo Musara, Pantan Musara Village, Pegasing Subdistrict, Central Aceh District, Aceh Province. This research used a non-factorial randomized block design with five treatments and four replications. Treatments consisted of shade tree type on coffee plants were control/no shade, small lamtoro shade (Leucaena leucocephala ssp. leucocephala), big lamtoro shade (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata), banana shade (Musa paradisiaca L.), avocado shade (Persea americana Mill.). The results showed that the shade tree type had a significant effect on soil temperature at a depth of 0, 10, and 20 cm. Coffee plants that were shaded by avocado trees have better temperatures for coffee plants and can reduce soil temperature until they reach optimal temperatures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae family) is one of the plants used in the traditional medicine for the treatment of many diseases. The objective of the present work was to evaluate phytochemically and biologically different extracts of L. leucocephala flowers, grown in Jordan. Total phenols and total flavonoid contents and antioxidant activities of the water, 70% ethanol and n-butanol extracts of the fresh flowers were determined. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evaluated using the dilution method. Microculture tetrazolium assay (MTT) was used to measure the antiproliferative activity. The toxicity of the extracts was assessed using Brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA). The chemical composition of the n-butanol extract, the most potent extract, was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). LC-MS evaluation of the n-butanol extract revealed the presence of 23 compounds. It showed the highest phenolic content (gallic acid equivalent-321.087 mg/g) and the highest flavonoid content (rutin equivalent-210.388 mg/g). It exhibited highest antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus (MIC = 0.390 ± 0.002 mg/mL) and highest antiproliferative activity against T47D (IC50 = 0.094 ± 0.01 mg/mL). None of the tested extracts exhibited toxicity. © 2024, Romanian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study deals with emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from some common plant species found in the Western Ghats of India using branchenclosure experiments. A custom-made dynamic chamber system was deployed to collect samples from seven different plant species. Analysis of speciated BVOCs was performed using C2-C6 and C6-C12 VOC analysers to determine the emission composition and relative concentration. Isoprene was the most abundant compound, followed by ethene, propene, a-pinene and ft-pinene. Among the plant species, Tectona grandis, Bambusa vulgaris and Psidium guajava showed high fractions of isoprene emission, Saraca asoca showed moderate emission, and Manilkara zapota and Leucaena leucocephala showed the lowest emission. However, M. zapota and L. leucocephala showed higher emission of both ethene and propene compared to isoprene. This study emphasizes the importance of emission flux measurements of major plant species in different forest regions of India, which is necessary to make emission inventories of important BVOCs. © (2024), (Indian Academy of Sciences).

AB  - The urban fringe area is a transitional area between urban and rural areas which supports urban ecological functioning. Vegetation is an element of biodiversity that is important for the sustainability of urban life. The balance of the ecosystem is maintained with the help of the biodiversity of the urban fringe area where environmental functions and services will be able to run optimally. The important value index (IVI) in the vegetation structure is a quantitative measurement used to assess the health of vegetation in an area. Vegetation in the urban fringe region of Surakarta is dominated by types of Tectona grandis, Senna siamea, Mangifera indica, Switenia macrophylla and Leucaena leucocephala. Tectona grandis (220.02%), Falctaria moluccana (164.63%) and Pterocarpus indicus (142.55%) have the highest IVI vegetation in Karanganyar District. In Sukoharjo Regency, variations for the highest IVI were diverse with the highest IVI being Falcataria mollucana (171.49%), Tectona grandis (97.46%) and Gluta rengas (89.54%). Tectona grandis (230.99%) and Mangifera indica (145.53%) are the species with the highest IVI in Boyolali District. The high importance of Tectona grandis is based on the IVI count. The dominance of vegetation species in urban fringe is considered to be of high economic value for the community. © 2023 IIETA.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the nutritive value of different vegetative parts of Moringa oleifera (leaves, stems and plant debris) and Leucaena leucocephala (leaves and dried pods after seed harvesting). Nutrient composition, secondary metabolites and kinetics of gas production (GP) from in vitro rumen fermentation were measured to investigate the adequacy of these materials as feed resources for ruminants. Leaves of M. oleifera had the highest (p <.001) crude protein content (22.9%), total polyphenols (336 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry matter [DM]), flavonoids (158 mg quercetin equivalent/g DM), condensed tannins (2.26 mg catechin equivalents/g DM) and extraction yield (29.3%). Debris of M. oleifera showed the highest (p <.001) antioxidant activity. The pods and leaves of L. leucocephala showed the highest organic matter (OM; 94.5 and 92.7%, respectively), neutral detergent fiber (63.1 and 64.6%, respectively), acid detergent fiber (48.5 and 45%, respectively) and hemicellulose (14.6 and 19.6%, respectively). However, the leaves and stems of M. oleifera showed the highest (p <.001) asymptotic GP (152 and 147 mL/g DM incubated) and fractional rate of fermentation (0.168 and 0.146 per h) compared to the leaves and pods of L. leucocephala. Additionally, the highest (p <.001) OM digestibility (59.8%), metabolizable energy (8.32 MJ/kg DM), net energy (in terms of forage units for lactation or meat production) were observed with the leaves of M. oleifera. In conclusion, the concentration of nutrients differed between plants and within parts of the plant. Leaves of M. oleifera showed higher nutritive value than the stems and shed material. The pods of L. leucocephala showed higher nutritive value than its leaves. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Wild Edible Plants (WEPs) grow naturally in the environment without human assistance and have parts that humans or animals can consume. The declining interest of local communities in consumable wild plant species, especially among the younger generation, resulted in the loss of public knowledge on the utilization of wild natural resources and the extinction of various types of wild species in nature. This study aims to determine wild edible plants used by local communities in three districts along the Bengawan Solo River, Central Java, Indonesia. This research used qualitative and quantitative data obtained by conducting open, semi-structured, and structured interviews with 90 respondents aged 20-80 years old. Quantitative data was analyzed to produce Use Values (UV) and Informant Consensus Factor (ICF). The study found that the community consumes approximately 49 species from 32 families of WEPs and the most consumed species were Leucaena leucocephala, Carica papaya, Dendrocalamus asper, Muntingia calabura, Peperomia pellucida, Gnetum gnemon, Moringa oleifera, and Portulaca oleracea. Consumable wild plants along the Bengawan Solo River have an ICF value ranging from 0.645 to 1. The WEPs were used for carbohydrates, vegetables, fruits, seeds, and medicine. The study highlights the diverse uses of plant parts, emphasizing the community's holistic approach to incorporating wild plants into their diet and medicine. The research emphasizes the need to preserve and comprehend the multifaceted roles of WEPs, which are crucial for sustaining cultural traditions and community well-being. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Following the control of an invasive tree species, native forest ecosystem restoration can be prevented by a secondary invasion by another invasive species that inhibits the reestablishment of native trees. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the invasive shrub Leucaena leucocephala on the initial growth of planted seedlings of four native tree species (Pandanus boninensis, Rhaphiolepis indica, Schima mertensiana, and Terminalia catappa) after eradication of the invasive tree Casuarina equisetifolia in the Ogasawara Islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. In a 24-month field experiment, we compared the sizes of planted seedlings (diameter at ground level, height, and leaf number) among four treatments in a 2 × 2 design of initial seedling size (large vs. small) × L. leucocephala invasion (sowing L. leucocephala seeds vs. control). More than 75% of the seedlings (excluding S. mertensiana) survived regardless of the treatments. For all four species, initially large seedlings tended to become larger plants at the end of the experiment than initially small seedlings. We detected significant effects of L. leucocephala invasion on one or more plant size parameters in all four species. Seedlings grown in L. leucocephala invasion quadrats were smaller than those in control quadrats at the end of the experiment. We detected significant interactions between initial seedling sizes and L. leucocephala invasion for three species. Together, these results indicate that secondary invasion by L. leucocephala after controlling C. equisetifolia inhibits the initial growth of native tree seedlings, depending on their size at the time of invasion. © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.

TI  - Thinning enhances success of enrichment planting with selected tree species under a pure stand of Leucaena leucocephala

AB  - Increasing the biodiversity of Leucaena leucocephala (hereafter leucaena) stands without losing the benefits provided by the forest structure is a challenge for adaptive management. Here, we report the survival and growth (height, stem, and canopy diameter) of five Atlantic Forest tree species planted underneath a pure stand of the exotic leucaena, which was broadcast sown 35 years before in a 0.6 ha area. Two treatments were compared: thinning (cutting all leucaena trees in 4-m wide rows, where seedlings were planted) and control (seedlings planted under leucaena canopy), with four replicates each (20 seedlings per plot, four per species, 2-m spaced). The five species selected were long-lived emergent trees from seasonal forests, with broad canopy, evergreen, and shade-tolerant. These traits were expected to allow their survival and growth, and, later on, to shade out the leucaena trees. Seven years after planting, survival was high for all species (around 80%), not differing between treatments or species. On average, stem diameter, height, and crown diameter were, respectively, 69, 44, and 36% higher in thinned than in control plots. Response to thinning differed between species in growth, with Gallesia integrifolia and Luehea divaricata standing out. Our results demonstrate that the species used for enrichment planting, selected by their suitable functional traits, can successfully survive under leucaena stands. Reducing competition by thinning, however, is crucial to enhance their growth. Despite the benefits from thinning, enrichment success strongly depends, therefore, on the abilities of the species selected to face the ecological filters acting on the target ecosystem. © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Giant leucaena is a multipurpose tree-legume found throughout the tropics and sub-tropics. Its foliage is used as animal fodder due to high protein and fiber. Giant leucaena has several other advantageous traits such as fast-growth, high yields and strong tolerance to environmental stresses. Despite having these desirable qualities, leucaena tissues contain an undesirable attribute, a toxic non-protein amino acid, mimosine, found in all parts of the plant including the foliage. The goal of this research was to determine mimosine concentrations in various tissues and life stages of giant leucaena plants to inform use of leucaena foliage as a fodder. Mimosine was extracted from different parts of giant leucaena at different ages and quantified using HPLC analysis. qRT-PCR was used to determine the relative expression of mimosine synthase in leucaena tissues. Mimosine was present in all parts of the leaf, stem and root of giant leucaena, and concentrations changed depending on the age of the plant. Green seeds had the highest expression level of mimosine synthase. Mimosine is ubiquitous and abundant in leucaena tissues with younger and immature plants and tissues containing more mimosine than older mature plants and tissues. © 2024 Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales is an open-access journal published by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), in association with the Tropical Crops Genetic Resources Institute of the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (TCGRI-CATAS).

AB  - Background: There is an increased need for intercropping practice in drylands to increase land-use efficiency. Canopy cover is a great tool to assess agricultural yield, as it is an indicator of plant health and productivity. Methods: The smartphone-based application Canopeo was used to measure the canopy cover (CC) of Clitoria under mixed intercropping with Leucaena and with four (4) fertilization levels (Control, 200 kg, 300 kg and 400 kg of NPK). Forage yield and (CC) were measured during six (6) consecutive harvests. Moreover, forage quality (NPK and protein) was analyzed. Result: The results revealed a high positive correlation between (CC) with crop yield and quality. Also, the application of fertilizers produced higher (CC) associated with higher yield and forage quality. The relatively low correlation of (CC) with yield in intercropping may be due to the high competition of the Leucaena tree. However, the whole intercropping system was positive (with an LER of 2.4), indicating better land-use efficiency. The results concluded that intercropping in drylands would result in better land use. While the application of NPK fertilizers will increase crop (CC), which in turn will reflect in higher forage yield and quality. © (2024), (Agricultural Research Communication Centre).

AB  - The aimed of the research was to evaluate the physical-chemical, anatomical and energy characteristics of the wood of the Prosopis juliflora and Leucaena leucocephala species, with a view to using it as an energy source. To do this, five trees per species were selected and 5 cm thick disks were removed at 0 (base), 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the commercial height of the trunk, considering a minimum diameter of 5.0 cm. These disks were divided into four wedge-shaped parts, with two wedges used to determine basic density, bark content and heartwood: sapwood ratio and the others used for chemical and energy analysis and charcoal production. The Prosopis juliflora species had the highest dry mass (77.92 kg), basic density (779.31 kg.m-3) and C:A ratio (1.00). On the other hand, Leucaena leucocephala had a higher insoluble lignin content (28.17%), while Prosopis juliflora had higher percentages of extractives (9.75%) and ash in the wood (2.20%). The energy density of the wood was higher for Prosopis juliflora (3.73 Gcal.m-3). There was no significant difference between the species for the results of upper and lower calorific value, fixed carbon content and volatile materials. In terms of gravimetric yield and charcoal productivity, Prosopis juliflora showed the highest results, with average values of 42.33% and 329.77 kg.m-3, respectively. Overall, both species showed satisfactory characteristics for energy use, with better results for Prosopis juliflora wood. © 2024 University Center of Maringa. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mechanistic Aspect of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles in Alleviating Abiotic Stress in Plants — A Sustainable Agriculture Approach
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170107503&doi=10.1007%2fs12668-023-01192-0&partnerID=40&md5=91bde47991503a78b09044f3404d91ce
AB  - The global agricultural system has recently suffered from unfavourable climatic factors that impacts plant morphology, physiology, biochemistry, growth, and yield. One of the main barriers to agricultural production and food security is abiotic stress in plants. Therefore, in order to feed the population, the development of novel strategies is required to solve these issues and achieve sustainability. Undoubtedly, different types of nanoparticles are extensively used in the agriculture sector for the crop improvement. Keeping this in mind, this review focuses on the role of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) in particular for combating different abiotic stresses. Though the majority of investigations, however, centred on the general effect of ZnO NPs on the plant physiology, morphology, anatomy, and biochemical processes under stress conditions, this article will present in detail the effect of differently synthesised ZnO nanoparticles in mitigating abiotic stresses such as heavy metal stress, temperature extremes, drought, and salinity stress. The article will focus how ZnO nanoparticles affect plant biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, and gene expression level to combat abiotic stress. The elucidation of the mechanisms behind ZnO NP-mediated stress tolerance in plants and future prospective of this emerging technology has also been discussed. Overall, ZnO nanoparticles provide an eco-friendly, cost-effective approach to plant stress management, and these findings open up new avenues for the application of nanotechnology in sustainable agriculture, allowing for the cultivation of stress-tolerant crops and ensuring global food security in the face of changing climatic conditions.

AB  - This review examines the current state of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of different dietary ruminant enteric methane mitigation strategies and their modes of action together with the issues discussed regarding the potential harms/risks and applicability of such strategies. By investigating these strategies, we can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which they influence methane production and identify promising approaches for sustainable mitigation of methane emissions. Out of all nutritional strategies, the use of 3-nitrooxypropanol, red seaweed, tannins, saponins, essential oils, nitrates, and sulfates demonstrates the potential to reduce emissions and receives a lot of attention from the scientific community. The use of certain additives as pure compounds is challenging under certain conditions, such as pasture-based systems, so the potential use of forages with sufficient amounts of plant secondary metabolites is also explored. Additionally, improved forage quality (maturity and nutrient composition) might help to further reduce emissions. Red seaweed, although proven to be very effective in reducing emissions, raises some questions regarding the volatility of the main active compound, bromoform, and challenges regarding the cultivation of the seaweed. Other relatively new methods of mitigation, such as the use of cyanogenic glycosides, are also discussed in this article. Together with nitrates, cyanogenic glycosides pose serious risks to animal health, but research has proven their efficacy and safety when control measures are taken. Furthermore, the risks of nitrate use can be minimized by using probiotics. Some of the discussed strategies, namely monensin or halogenated hydrocarbons (as pure compounds), demonstrate efficacy but are unlikely to be implemented widely because of legal restrictions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Ruminant production in the Philippines is often hindered by limited access to high-quality feed, leading to suboptimal animal growth and productivity. To address these challenges, this study evaluated the locally made multi-nutrient lick block (MNLB) containing ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala), a legume known for its nutritional value. A 30-day palatability test was conducted to assess the acceptability of the developed MNLB, using 5 male buffaloes with an average weight of 245 ± 5 kg. Additionally, a 90-day-feeding trial was carried out using 15 growing buffaloes (average age: 13.5 months, weight: 243.83 ± 5 kg), randomly assigned to three treatment groups: T1 or control (non-supplemented), T2 or commercial mineral block, and T3 or MNLB, to evaluate the growth performance, nutrient utilization, and economic viability of the legume-based MNLB. Results demonstrated that the MNLB was palatable to the animals, with an average daily consumption of 192.10 g/animal/day, providing adequate nutritional value to meet the buffaloes’ daily requirements. Moreover, MNLB supplementation significantly enhanced dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) intake compared to control and commercial mineral block groups. The average DM intake for T3 was 9.88 kg, and the average CP intake was 1006 g, compared to T1 (9.56 kg DM intake and 983 g CP intake) and T2 (9.59 kg DM intake and 984 g CP intake). While the commercial mineral block showed positive results, the MNLB outperformed in terms of nutritional value. In terms of cost-effectiveness, the MNLB can serve as an alternative feed supplement for small- scale farmers, offering a lower- cost option compared to commercial feed supplements. The study concluded that the MNLB has potential as a practical solution to address the nutritional challenges faced by ruminant producers in resource-limited environments. By providing a nutrient-rich and safe feed supplement, the MNLB can contribute to improved animal health, productivity, and overall farm profitability. © The Author(s) 2024

AB  - A comprehensive review, based on about 170 references, synthesizing research and development about Cratylia argentea, is presented to expand interest in its dissemination and use in animal production systems. The species has been widely evaluated, mainly in tropical America, with the objective to develop it as a shrub legume and an alternative to the fertility-demanding species, Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium. The review on cratylia is presented in 2 separate parts covering biology and agronomy and quality and utilization. This paper focuses on the (1) description of the species, (2) biogeography and information on germplasm collections and genetic diversity, synthesis, (3) discussion of results from agronomic research, reproductive biology, seed production and (4) multipurpose uses of cratylia. Some strengths of the species as a forage shrub are adaptation to the acid, infertile soils that prevail in the tropics and drought tolerance in subhumid climates with a pronounced dry season. Major shortcomings are slow establishment and rapidly declining seed quality. Research resulted in the release of a blend of 2 germplasm accessions (CIAT 18516 and CIAT 18668) as a commercial forage legume cultivar in Costa Rica and Colombia. Finally, recommendations for future research are proposed. © 2024 Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales is an open-access journal published by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by increased joint pain and stiffness, particularly in the morning, which requires medication for treatment. Our research described here was aimed to develop, evaluate, and optimize coated naproxen pellets for colon-specific delivery using the carboxymethyl Leucaena leucocephala gum for the chronotherapy of RA. The extrusion-spheronization process was used for the preparation of the pellets followed by coating in a fluidized bed processor with materials such as Eudragit® S 100 and L 100. An 11-run, 2-factor, 3-level, randomized full factorial design was used to analyze the impact on the responses by varying the levels of independent factors to obtain the optimized formulation. The drug release of all the formulation batches at the 4th hour varied from 1.24 to 17.22% in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract; while the release of the drug at the 10th hour varied from 76.87 to 98.39% at the colonic pH. Furthermore, it was observed that the optimized formulation exhibited an increased release of naproxen in the presence of cecal matter collected from rats. We suggest that the prepared optimized formulation of the coated pellets of naproxen shows promise for the chronotherapeutic treatment of early morning symptoms associated with RA. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The following paper is a continuation of the previous experiment on the wet season forage production of Leucaena leucocephala cv Tarramba already published. In the recent continuing experiment, measurements were conducted on two 4 months cutting intervals during the 2021 dry season and some additional data were also included from the measurements of biomass production of 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months plant stands to provide more complete information on edible forage and wood production. Data recorded included: leaf production, stem skin (bark) production, stem production, stem diameter, and plant height. With the current model (6,264 plants), the 1 year (2021) edible biomass can support 5 bulls at the first 2 months interval (January to February), and 2 bulls at the second two months interval (March to April), during the wet season. While at the first 4 months interval in 2021 during the dry season (May to August) the model can support 1.8 bulls, and about 2.5 bulls during the second 4 months cutting interval (September to December 2021). If the density is applied to 1 ha with 20.000 plants it may support 6-16 fattening bulls according to the season at biomass production. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The alien vascular flora of the Pantelleria Island National Park (Sicily Channel, Italy): new insights into the distribution of some potentially invasive species
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175075485&doi=10.3391%2fbir.2023.12.4.01&partnerID=40&md5=b9a3959149d122d129aa7ead4a409779
AB  - Pantelleria is a volcanic island located in the Sicily Channel (Italy), between Sicily and Tunisia. The island, designated a National Park in 2016, hosts an interesting vascular flora of over 600 species including 9 narrow endemics. The island’s incredible biodiversity is, however, at risk due to anthropogenic influences, climate change, and, recently, the presence and spread of alien plant species. The Pantelleria alien flora has never been thoroughly investigated, probably because many non-native species were not yet present or so widespread on the island. Now, however, with the increased general awareness of the risks associated with invasive alien species, documentation of the presence of non-native species has been steadily increasing. In this study, field and literature research was carried out to investigate the alien flora of the island. Here, we report the status of a number of non-native plants with known invasive potential. Cenchrus setaceus (=Pennisetum setaceum) is reported for the first time as naturalized in the island with clear invasive behaviour, while, particularly remarkable for their invasive potential are other studied plants such as: Acacia saligna, Ailanthus altissima, Boheravia coccinea, Carpobrotus edulis, Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata, Malephora crocea, Melia azedarach, Nicotiana glauca, Opuntia ficus-indica, Parkinsonia aculeata, Washingtonia robusta and a few others less important at the moment, but to be monitored. Although most taxa showed a relatively limited distribution, the trend is to observe an increased invasiveness, which indicates that they can potentially become invasive in Pantelleria as well in the next years or decades. Their limited current distribution suggests that these species are in the early stages of the general invasion curve, when intervention is feasible and most likely to succeed. Therefore, it is most prudent to prioritize management for as many potentially problematic nonnatives as possible, which will contribute greatly to the conservation of native species and ecosystems of Pantelleria. Prevention and management of invasive non-native species—both future arrivals and those already present—are necessary to preserve the peculiar volcanic landscape of Pantelleria, which was shaped by man over the last millennia. © Minissale et al.

AB  - A water-absorbent hybrid hydrogel was prepared using arabinoxylans from flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) (FX) and galactomannans from subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) (SG) in the presence of kappa-carrageenan (κC) with variable concentration of potassium chloride as crosslinker (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.3 M), and evaluated on the basis of their swelling rate (%). The optimized hydrogel (GAXH) from a blend of SG, κC, FX and KCl at 5.5% w/v, 1.32% w/v, 1% w/v and 0.3M, respectively, showed 300% swelling in water at room temperature and pH 7.4 with 100% retention of water for 30 days at 10 °C. Blending 50% w/w GAXH in the soil could retain 140% water for 30 days, acting as a water reservoir in the soil system at 35 °C and pH 7.4 which reached 100% evaporation after 60 days. Incorporation of 50% w/w GAXH in sandy, loamy soil was used for the potted cultivation of cherry tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme) and observed for growth and composition of the tomatoes. GAXH enhanced the physiological growth of both the plant as well as cherry tomatoes by controlling the release of KCl into the soil and maintaining soil moisture when 3 day intermittent watering schedule was used. An additional advantage was an improved water use efficiency and reduction in water footprint from 3.23 cm3/g to 9.32 cm3/g and 19.87 mL/fruit to 8.56 mL/fruit, respectively. The fully ripened tomatoes grown on GAXH-incorporated soil showed higher contents of lycopene, total carotenoids, and total polyphenols from 166 to 257 μg/g fresh weight, 99–107 mg β-carotene equivalent/100g fresh weight, 223–241 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g fresh weight, respectively, than control cherry tomatoes grown in soil with no added GAXH. This was also reflected in enhanced antioxidant activity of cherry tomatoes grown in GAXH-incorporated soil. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Metal corrosion poses a substantial economic challenge in a technologically advanced world. In this study, novel environmentally friendly anticorrosive graphene oxide (GO)-doped organic-inorganic hybrid polyurethane (LFAOIH@GO-PU) nanocomposite coatings were developed from Leucaena leucocephala oil (LLO). The formulation was produced by the amidation reaction of LLO to form diol fatty amide followed by the reaction of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and a dispersion of GOx (X = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 wt%) along with the reaction of isophorane diisocyanate (IPDI) (25–40 wt%) to form LFAOIH@GOx-PU35 nanocomposites. The synthesized materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); 1H, 13C, and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance; and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A detailed examination of LFAOIH@GO0.5-PU35 morphology was conducted using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. These studies revealed distinctive surface roughness features along with a contact angle of around 88 G.U preserving their structural integrity at temperatures of up to 235 °C with minimal loading of GO. Additionally, improved mechanical properties, including scratch hardness (3 kg), pencil hardness (5H), impact resistance, bending, gloss value (79), crosshatch adhesion, and thickness were evaluated with the dispersion of GO. Electrochemical corrosion studies, involving Nyquist, Bode, and Tafel plots, provided clear evidence of the outstanding anticorrosion performance of the coatings. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Post-dispersal seed removal is crucial for maintaining plant recruitment by influencing secondary dispersal and the mortality of seeds. However, data on seed removal in the northern savanna of Ghana is scarce. In this study, we applied a rapid assessment method to examine the effect of three habitat types (conventional farmland, agroforestry parkland, and woodland) and two seed species (Leucaena leucocephala and Faidherbia albida) on seed removal by invertebrates and vertebrates in an agricultural landscape using selective exclosures in Nyankpala, a town located in the northern savanna of Ghana. The exclosures, closed and open, were designed to impose restrictions that allow either invertebrates or both invertebrates and vertebrates access to seeds. Using a generalized linear mixed modelling approach, we showed that habitat type and seed species significantly influenced the rate of seed removal, with the woodland habitat and F. albida seeds recording the highest removal rates. Our results suggest that invertebrates often dominated seed removal events compared to vertebrates, possibly due to differences in allometry and morphological traits and their effect on seed preference. This study adds to the growing evidence that savanna habitats and fauna play a critical role in maintaining plant population dynamics through seed predation and dispersal events. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Abstract: Biomass is a sustainable renewable energy source that can solve energy demand and environmental pollution. In this present study, four non-edible biomass that are fast growing in wasteland and forest regions were chosen to check their feasibility as biofuels for the different thermochemical conversion processes. Senna auriculata seeds, Albizia lebbeck seed with shell, Leucaena leucocephala seed, and Acacia nilotica seed were selected. Characterizations such as thermogravimetric analysis, proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, calorific value, bulk density, and functional groups via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis were performed. The proximate analysis confirmed the minimum level of moisture content (4.98 to 6.75%) and significant volatile matter content (53.75 to 72.48%) in these feedstocks. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the maximum devolatilization takes place in the temperature range of 200 to 500°C. The maximum value of solid residue was found in Leucaena leucocephala (31.76 wt %) and the minimum was found in Senna auriculata seeds (8.83 wt %). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the highest peaks were in the range of 3200 to 3323 cm–1, as related to the existence of O–H stretching of carboxylic acid, alcohol, and amine groups. The calorific value of these non-edible biomass materials was in the range of 17.19 to 23.28 MJ/kg. The physio-chemical analysis results confirmed that these feedstocks are more suitable for the thermochemical conversion processes. Also, the processing of this non-edible biomass is more appropriate for future energy development and improves employment opportunities in rural and forest areas. © 2023, Allerton Press, Inc.

TI  - Rhizobium acaciae sp. nov., a new nitrogen-fixing symbiovar isolated from root nodules of Acacia saligna in Tunisia

AB  - Three bacterial strains, 1AS11T, 1AS12 and 1AS13, members of the new symbiovar salignae and isolated from root nodules of Acacia saligna grown in Tunisia, were characterized using a polyphasic approach. All three strains were assigned to the Rhizobium leguminosarum complex on the basis of rrs gene analysis. Phylogenetic analysis based on 1734 nucleotides of four concatenated housekeeping genes (recA, atpD, glnII and gyrB) showed that the three strains were distinct from known rhizobia species of the R. leguminosarum complex and clustered as a separate clade within this complex. Phylogenomic analysis of 92 up-to-date bacterial core genes confirmed the unique clade. The digital DNA–DNA hybridization and blast-based average nucleotide identity values for the three strains and phylogenetically related Rhizobium species ranged from 35.9 to 60.0% and 87.16 to 94.58%, which were lower than the 70 and 96% species delineation thresholds, respectively. The G+C contents of the strains were 60.82–60.92mol% and the major fatty acids (>4%) were summed feature 8 (57.81%; C18:1 ω7c) and C18:1 ω7c 11-methyl (13.24%). Strains 1AS11T, 1AS12 and 1AS13 could also be differentiated from their closest described species (Rhizobium indicum, Rhizobium laguerreae and Rhizobium changzhiense) by phenotypic and physiological properties as well as fatty acid content. Based on the phylogenetic, genomic, physiological, genotypic and chemotaxonomic data presented in this study, strains 1AS11T, 1AS12 and 1AS13 represent a new species within the genus Rhizobium and we propose the name Rhizobium acaciae sp. nov. The type strain is 1AS11T (=DSM 113913T=ACCC 62388T). © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Soil infertility is one of the constraints contributing to poor sorghum production in semi-arid areas across Africa. To increase sorghum production, there is need to address soil fertility issues. Therefore, the objective was to assess the effects of Leucaena/cattle manure combination on grain and stover yields, harvest index and net return of two sorghum varieties (Macia and SV1) under rainwater harvesting techniques. The field experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design over three cropping seasons in a split-split plot arrangement. Results show significant (P < 0.05) increase in sorghum grain yield with increased applications of Leucaena/cattle manure combination. Macia variety had statistically greater (P < 0.05) grain yield than SV1 variety. Tied contour show considerably higher yield for both varieties across all seasons. Stover yield show significant differences (P < 0.05) as affected by Leucaena/cattle manure and rainwater harvesting techniques. Rainwater harvesting techniques significantly influence (P < 0.05) harvest index, with tied contour and infiltration pits having comparably higher harvest index than standard contour. Application of Leucaena/cattle manure combination show significant increases in harvest index with increased application rates. However, no significant effect was observed at 20 and 30 t ha−1 from SV1 variety across all seasons. Leucaena/cattle manure combination significantly influenced (P < 0.05) sorghum net return across all seasons except at 5 t ha−1 where no significant effect was observed. Macia variety had higher net return than SV1. To increase grain yield and net return, farmers can adopt Macia variety, tied contour and 10 t ha−1 Leucaena/cattle manure combination due to higher incremental yield per tonne. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Leguminous trees and saltbushes provide potential alternatives to conventional feeds to overcome feed deficiency in arid and semi-arid countries. However, these plants are rich in antinutritional factors that have adverse effects on rumen microbiota and the host- animal. Some rumen microbiota detoxifies plants' secondary metabolites; thus, understanding plant-microbe interaction in the rumen could improve the plants' utilization. This study investigated the bacterial colonization and degradation of non-extracted and extracted tanniniferous plants: Atriplex halimus, Acacia saligna, and Leucaena leucocephala, in the rumen of three fistulated camels at 6 and 12 hours. The results showed that these plants have high nutritional value and tannins contents. The rumen degradation and microbial diversity of plant-attached bacteria varied according to plant type and phenols' extraction. Atriplex and leucaena showed higher microbial diversity at 6 and 12h, respectively. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the main bacterial phyla, and the main genera were Prevotella, RC9_gut_group, Butyrivibrio that overrepresented in non-extracted plants (P<0.05). Fibrobacteres and Anaerovibrio showed sensitivity to plant toxins and Ruminococcus attached to plants with lower tannins. Several bacterial genera in the camel rumen have the potential to resist antinutritional factors in fodder plants, which could be used to improve the performance of grazing animals. © 2023 Rabee et al.

AB  - Currently, experiments have been performed in modifying grass and legume to uncover their genetic variability. Such irradiation method could discover the hidden genetic potential of Leucaena leucocephala cv. Tarramba considering its nutritional content, high protein content, and good palatability. This study is a preliminary study of Leucaena leucocephala cv. Tarramba mutant (Ml). This study aims to identify the germination growth of Ml induced by gamma irradiation. The irradiation was performed in the National Nuclear Energy Agency of Indonesia. The germination experiments were conducted for one month in Green House, Central of Excellence (COE), Agriculture Faculty, Hasanuddin University. This study employed a completely randomized design (CRD) with nine treatments and eight replicates. The treatment included gamma irradiation at different doses that consisted of control treatment (without gamma induction); 50Gy; 150Gy; 250Gy; 350Gy; 450Gy; 550Gy; 650Gy; and 750Gy. The observed parameters in this study encompassed plumule length, radicule length, seedling length. Data obtained from observation were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT) at 5% margin error. The results indicated that gamma irradiation significantly affected the germination growth performance, i.e., plumule length, radicule length, and seedling, where the coefficient of variance <20%. Although fluctuation of germination performance value occurred, the plumule length performance tended to increase at the control and re-increase at the dose of 650Gy to 750Gy. Whereas the radicule and seedling length performance relatively increase at the dose of 550Gy to 750Gy. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the dose of 650Gy to 750Gy increases germination growth of Mutant (Ml) Leucaena leucocephala cv. Tarramba. Further research concerning the lethal dose for the forages, DNA genetic analysis and ensuring no toxic effect on livestock would be important to perform. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

AB  - The purpose of this research is to know the influence of additional fermented fertilizer to the growth of plantlet Gracilaria sp. during acclimatization stage. The comparison of composition fermented fertilizer from Leucaena leucocephala leaves : Moringa oleifera leaves which used were 75%:25%, 50%:50%, 25%:75% and control without additional fermented fertilizer. The best plantlet growth after seven weeks testing, found in comparison 25%:75% with enhancement plantlet growth up till 32,4%, followed with comparison 50%:50% with enhancement plantlet growth up till 27,1%, the last with comparison 75%:25% and control which both show enhancement plantlet growth up till 13,5%. Based on this result, we carried out further testing with comparison 20%:80%, 15%:85%, 10%:90% and 5%:95% but the plantlet growth result only as much 12,67%; 26,67%; 24,67% and -0,09% so we recommend to use combination fermented fertilizer from Leucaena leucocephala leaves : Moringa oleifera leaves with comparison 25%:75% in acclimatization step since it's not only increase the weight but also the length and number of shoots. However, it's necessary to do further testing using other fertilizer raws to get better plantlet growth result. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Crossbred Cow Milk Production in a Silvopastoral System in Tropical Mexico
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163799451&doi=10.3390%2fani13121941&partnerID=40&md5=c644415a332bba55eb548d79ff6ff9a6
AB  - In Mexico, pasture degradation is associated with extensive pastures; additionally, under these conditions, livestock activities contribute considerably to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Among the options to improve grazing systems and reduce GHG emissions, silvopastoral systems (SPS) have been recommended. The objectives of this work were to quantify the N outflow in a soil–plant–animal interface, as well as the CH4 emissions and milk production in an SPS with woody legumes (Leucaena leucocephala) that is associated with stargrass (Cynodon nlemfuensis). This was then compared with stargrass in a monoculture system (MS) in the seasons (dry and rainy period) over a two-year period. Dung was collected from the animals of each of the grazing systems and applied fresh to the land plots. Fresh dung and urine were collected from the cows of each grazing system and were applied to the experimental plots. In addition, the soil CH4 and N2O contents were measured to quantify the emissions. Average milk yield by seasons was similar: MS (7.1 kg per animal unit (AU)/day−1) and SPS (6.31 kg per AU/day−1). Cows in the MS had a mean N intake of 171.9 g/UA day−1 without seasonal variation, while the SPS animals’ mean N intake was 215.7 g/UA day−1 for both seasons. For the urine applied to soil, the N2O outflow was higher in the MS (peak value = 1623.9 μg N-N2O m−2 h−1). The peak value for the SPS was 755.9 μg of N-N2O m−2 h−1. The N2O emissions were higher in the rainy season (which promotes denitrification). The values for the feces treatment were 0.05% (MS) and 0.01% (SPS). The urine treatment values were 0.52% (MS) and 0.17% (SPS). The emissions of CH4 showed that the feces of the SPS systems resulted in a higher accumulation of gas in the rainy season (29.8 g C ha−1), followed by the feces of the MS system in the dry season (26.0 g C ha−1). Legumes in the SPS helped to maintain milk production, and the N2O emissions were lower than those produced by the MS (where the pastures were fertilized with N). © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - N2O has a global warming potential of 300 times greater than CO2, and in silvopastoral systems, urine is a source of N2O emission. The objective of the research was to evaluate the effect of the diet for bovines based on Leucaena leucocephala on N2O emissions in a simulated urine patch in a silvopastoral system. A Cynodon plectostachyus meadow was used, and 13 samplings were carried out during March-April 2021. The treatments were, A: 20 kg of urea/ha from bovine urine fed with 100% C. plectostachyus hay + 0% L leucocephala, B: 36 kg of urea/ha from the urine of bovines fed with 16% of L. leucocephala + 84% of C. plectostachyus and C: 79 kg of urea/ha from the urine of bovines fed with 33% L. leucocephala + 67% C. plectostachyus. A completely randomized design with four replicates was used. Static closed stainless-steel chambers were used to obtain gas samples at 0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes. Environmental temperature, pH, humidity, nitrate and ammonium contents in the soil were recorded. Data were analyzed with the statistical program SAS 9.0. The N2O emission flux (μg/m2/h) between treatments did not present significant differences. The emission peak was observed on the fourth day of sampling in the treatments (A: 17.49, B: 23.71 and C: 22.88 μg N2O N m2/h). In addition, there was a positive correlation between the N2O flux and soil moisture. The increase in the amount of L. leucocephala in the diet of the animals did not influence the emission of N2O, due to the concentration of urea in the urine. However, a positive correlation with soil moisture was observed. © 2023, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM. All rights reserved.

TI  - Supplementation of Water Spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) on the utilization of Mimosa pigra and Leucaena leucocephala leaf for in vitro fermentation
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147832716&doi=10.14202%2fvetworld.2023.215-221&partnerID=40&md5=072c7c722b4499e0321283c89b402d21
AB  - Background and Aim: Ipomoea aquatica (Water Spinach) is the most potential for livestock growth performance, including chickens, pigs, cattle, and goats, especially in a tropical country like Cambodia. It is not only an alternative feed source but also one kind of supplemented feed for goat raising. Supplementation with Water Spinach in the utilization of low-quality tree foliage results in an increase in dry matter intake in goat production. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of supplementation of Water Spinach in the utilization of Mimosa pigra and Leucaena leucocephala leaf in in vitro fermentation. Materials and Methods: The study was designed according to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement in randomized design of seven treatments with different ratios consisted of different three types of dietary treatments, including M. pigra, L. leucocephala, and Water Spinach. The treatments were arranged according to a completely randomized design and were as follow: T1 = M. pigra leaf (100%); T2 = L. leucocephala leaf (100%); T3 = M. pigra leaf and L. leucocephala leaf (50% and 50%); T4 = M. pigra leaf and Water Spinach (99.5% and 0.5%); T5 = L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach (99.5% and 0.5%); T6 = M. pigra leaf and Water Spinach (99% and 1%); and T7 = L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach (99% and 1%). A total of 200 mg (dry matter) of dietary treatments were prepared in a 60 mL syringe. Each treatment was replicated 3 time. Gas recording of each treatment lasted for 3 days. In vitro was performed for 72 h, was followed by Makkar method. Gas production was recorded at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h of incubation by using strict anaerobic technique. A mixture of rumen fluid and dietary treatments were carried out under continuous flushing with CO2 in sharking incubator at 39°C. After incubating for 72 h, the ammonia concentration (NH3-N) was measured and recorded to identify pH, nutrient digestibility, and ammonia concentration (NH3-N). Results: Nutrient digestibility of the treatment with Water Spinach supplement in the utilization of L. leucocephala was obtained at a higher digestibility than treatment with M. pigra (p < 0.05). Gas production was different between groups (p < 0.05). Treatment with only M. pigra leaf had the highest gas production (A), while treatment with Water Spinach supplementation had the lowest gas production (A). At 0–24 h, the treatment with L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach 0.5% had the highest gas production, but after 24 h, M. pigra leaf and Water Spinach 1% and L. leucocephala leaf and Water Spinach 0.5% produced more gas compared to the other treatments (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The supplementation of Water Spinach 1% in treatment with M. pigra and L. leucocephala leaf resulted in increased degradability, gas production, and NH3–N concentration without a change in the pH value rumen condition. Based on these results, it is recommended that the level of Water Spinach supplementation should be 1% of dietary intake. Future studies should consider investigating the rumen ecology associated with Water Spinach supplementation. Feeding with Water Spinach remains a good supplement for ruminant performance; therefore, further studies should be conducted using Water Spinach in ruminant feeding in both metabolic and feeding trials. © 2023 Authors.

AB  - Allelopathy is seen as one of the possible factors that favor the invasion of exotic plants in the environment, as these species, by releasing allelochemicals, can negatively interfere with the establishment of native plants, facilitating the growth and dissemination of invasive exotic plants. This study aimed to verify the possible allelopathic effects of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (leucaena) on native tree species Pterogyne nitens Tul. and Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Taub., via laboratory bioassays. We used Petri dishes containing seeds of native species and aqueous extract of leucaena leaves with 2, 4, 8, 10 and 20% concentrations (m/v) for germination tests and estimated the percentage, mean time, and germination speed index at the end of the germination period. For initial growth, we kept the Petri dishes containing aqueous leucaena extract and germinated seeds of native species in a germination chamber at 25 °C, and after 48 hours we obtained the length of the primary root, hypocotyl, and fresh and dry biomass of the seedlings. We obtained the a, b, and total chlorophyll and carotenoid content of seedling leaves kept in the aqueous extract at different concentrations. We verified the content of total phenolic compounds in mg/L from the aqueous leucaena extracts. Both native species showed a reduction in the percentage and germination speed index when in contact with the aqueous leucaena extracts at the highest concentrations. The initial growth of native species was also negatively affected, and P. nitens showed a reduction of all growth parameters analyzed in all concentrations of the aqueous extract. P. dubium showed a reduction in growth, especially at the highest concentrations. The effects can be associated with phenolic compounds present in leucaena extracts, and we found the highest total phenolic content in the extract with the highest concentration. The results show the allelopathic potential of leucaena, which may contribute to this plant ability to settle in natural areas. © 2023, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relative palatability of woody perennials' fodder has been proposed as the selection criteria for species to be integrated in livestock systems. For that purpose, 20 species with different nutritional characteristics, that grow in the tropical dry forest of Colombia, were evaluated. The woody perennials were managed under pruning, in plots established at the Agrosavia's Nataima Research Center. Fodder of those species was offered to five mature Blanco Orejinegro (BON) cattle for a total of 19 days, using a cafeteria method with each species exposed to animals for only 3 minutes. The assignment of species was in pairs, with a total of 190 pairs, resulting from the combinations of 20 species taking two at the same time, without replication. The results of the palatability trials identified nine species with very high and high palatability, which ordered in a descending manner were: Albizia niopoides, Leucaena leucocephala, Erythrina fusca, Guazuma ulmifolia, Gliricidia sepium, Tithonia diversifolia, Clitoria fairchildiana, Spondias purpurea and Spondias mombin. The pair of species that showed the highest palatability was A. niopoides-L. leucocephala; and the species frequently present in combinations with high intake was A. niopoides. It is concluded that there are several native species with high relative palatability, whose forage potential is unknown by technicians and ranchers, and the high palatability of some species already known was confirmed. © Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales es una revista de acceso abierto publicada por el Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT), en asociación con el Instituto de Recursos Genéticos de Cultivos Tropicales de la Academia China de Ciencias Agrícolas Tropicales (TCGRI-CATAS).

AB  - Major regional gaps exist in the reporting and accessibility of naturalized plant species distribution data, especially within Southeast Asia. Here, we present the Malesian Naturalized Alien Flora database (MalNAF), the first standardized island-group level checklist of naturalized vascular plant species for the Malesian phytogeographical region. We used MalNAF to investigate the composition, origins, and habitat preferences of the naturalized flora. The naturalized vascular flora of Malesia consists of at least 1177 species. Richness is highest in the Philippines (539 spp.) and lowest in the Maluku Islands (87 spp.). But, the Lesser Sunda Islands had the highest naturalized species richness relative to native richness and Singapore has a higher naturalized plant species richness than would be expected given its size. When comparing the data for Malesia with a global dataset, we found that naturalized richness increased with area for islands but not for continental regions. Across the archipelago, 31 species are widespread, occurring in every island group, but the majority have a limited distribution of 2.4 ± 2.3 (mean ± SD) island groups per naturalized species. The naturalized plant species are representatives of 150 families, twenty of which are newly introduced to the region. Families richest in naturalized plant species in Malesia were Fabaceae (= Leguminosae) (160 spp.), Poaceae (= Gramineae) (138 spp.), and Asteraceae (= Compositae) (96 spp.). Most of these have a native range that includes tropical Asia, closely followed by those from Southern America (inclusive of the Caribbean, Central and South America), although at the island-group level, most have a higher proportion with a Southern American native range. Most naturalized species occur in anthropogenic habitats, but many are present in “natural” habitats with fewer species, such as Leucaena leucocephala, reported from specialized habitats like drylands. MalNAF provides a baseline for future studies of naturalized plant species distributions in the region. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Prosopis juliflora is an invasive plant species rapidly expanding in the Asian and African continents. The invasion of P. juliflora in Bundala Ramsar Wetland (BRW) in Sri Lanka has created several biodiversity conservation issues. This study was conducted to assess the possibility of utilizing invasive P. juliflora as an alternative energy source. P. juliflora performed better than L. leucocephala for most evaluated fuelwood properties. Ash content was comparatively higher in P. juliflora than L. leucocephala. However, biomass to ash ratio of P. juliflora was significantly lower (<0.05) and the Fuel Value Index (FVI) of P. juliflora (3,276) was slightly lower than that of L. leucocephala (3,336), a non-significant difference. P. juliflora and L. leucocephala reached Fiber Saturation Point within 24 and 27 days of drying, respectively. Results show that 1 kg of P. juliflora would produce an estimated energy equivalent to 0.5 L of diesel and furnace oil and 5 kWh of electricity. As such, we recommend further study on harvesting and commercialization of P. juliflora as a potential wood energy source. © 2022

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the effect of three energy concentrates on dietary nitrogen utilisation efficiency, milk production and milk composition. Twelve dual-purpose cows fed in a silvopastoral (SSP) system with Leucaena leucocephala and Digitaria swazilandensis were fed four treatments, supplemented with 25 MJ/cow/day of sorghum, molasses and gluconeogenic precursors, plus the control treatment, using a 4×4 Latin square experimental design with three replicates and experimental periods of 14 days and a total duration of 56 days. No significant differences were found for milk yield, milk chemical composition and milk urea nitrogen (MUN). No significant differences were found for cow live weight and dry matter intake. Forage analysis showed significant difference for crude protein (CP) concentration. There was no significant difference for average values of dry matter (DM) yield, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), lignin and in vitro DM matter. For Leucaena, a significant difference was found only in DM yield, with period 4 being the highest yielding period compared to periods 1, 2 and 3. There was no significant difference for CP, NDF, ADF, lignin and in vitro DM digestibility. This work allows to understand the interaction of CP metabolism with DM. It is concluded that SSP provides sufficient dietary energy to cows in production for dual-purpose cows ranching. © 2023 Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of replacing fish meal with Leucaena leucocephala leaf powder on survival, growth performance, digestive enzyme activities, biochemical body composition and muscle texture of the white-leg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931). Five different diets were examined, by replacing fish meal with L. leucocephala leaf powder at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20%, in triplicates. Shrimps were stocked in 0.5 m3 tanks @ 70 shrimps per tank and fed on the experimental diets for a period of 60 days. The results showed that the survival rate (%), daily weight gain (g day-1), specific growth rate (% day-1), feed intake (% fish-1 day-1), feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, and protein retention were not significantly different (p>0,05) among the treatment groups. The values of α-amylase and pepsin in the stomach and chymotrypsin (mU min-1 mg protein-1) in the intestine were not significantly different among treatments. However, the value of α-amylase in the intestine was significantly higher in animals fed diets that replaced fish meal with L. leucocephala leaf powder at 0, 5 and 10% compared to other treatments. The biochemical constituents (except for lipid) and the texture (N) of shrimp meat were not significantly different among treatment groups. The results suggested that L. leucocephala leaf powder could replace fish meal up to 20% in white-leg shrimp diets. © 2023, Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the key targets and potential mechanisms of action of C. alba and C. glabra in the treatment of C. neoformans through bioinformatics, network pharmacology and molecular docking, and to elucidate the main targets and signaling pathways that produce therapeutic effects. METHODS: The dataset GSE164805 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the limma R package was used to search for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal patient samples and COVID-19 patient samples, and the DEGs were subjected to gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway enrichment. The DEGs were analyzed, and the DEGs were combined with drug targets and imported into the Gene/Protein Interaction Search Tool String database to form a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The PPI network was screened for functional modules using Cytoscope software, and the genes with the top 5 Degree values were defined as core genes. Subsequently, immune cell infiltration analysis was performed on the disease dataset to explore immune cell infiltration in COVID-19 patients. Finally, MOE software was applied to complete molecular docking. RESULTS: Based on the dataset GSE164805, 4651 differentially expressed genes were obtained from the screening, and Luteinum vulgare contained 20 active components and 13 active components of Chuanbeimu, which corresponded to 652 targets, and 103 potential targets of action. protein interaction network analysis showed that SRC, PTGS2, NFKBIA, CDC42, and IGF1R were the core targets, and drug-target-constituent-disease network analysis showed Luteanin, Berberine, (S)-Canadine as core compounds. Immune cell infiltration results showed that Plasma cells, T cells and other immune cells were highly expressed in COVID-19 patient samples, and T cells CD8 and other places. The molecular docking results showed that the core protein showed good binding ability (binding energy <-5.5 kcal-mol-1) with the core compounds. CONCLUSION: The active ingredient targets and pathways of action in C. alba and C. kawakawa showed significant enrichment in counteracting inflammatory responses and reversing airway remodeling, which is consistent with the mechanism of action for the treatment of neocoronary pneumonia, and has a promising prospect for development in the prevention and treatment of neocoronary pneumonia.  © 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Impacts of seed-feeding beetles and their parasitoids on seed germination of Leucaena leucocephala and Senna multijuga (Fabaceae) in Brazil
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145587064&doi=10.1016%2fj.actao.2022.103886&partnerID=40&md5=eb7a72d10d1dcdb4469204bab7525a06
AB  - We investigated the influence of seed-feeding beetles (Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae) and their parasitoids on the germination performance of two Fabaceae, Leucaena leucocephala and Senna multijuga. We collected 150 fruits per species in forest fragments in the city of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil, between July and August 2020. Seeds were examined and separated into predated and non-predated categories. The predated category was divided into two subcategories: predated by Coleoptera (Bruchinae) (PCO) and predated in the presence of Coleoptera parasitoids (PARCO). The non-predated category was divided into artificially injured (AI), intact seeds without insect infestation (IS), and intact seeds with insect infestation (SIF). Seeds of S. multijuga and L. leucocephala germinated to 40% and 30%, respectively. PCO and PARCO seeds not only had a negative and restricting influence on S. multijuga germination (no germination) but also contributed to a large proportion of non-viable predated seeds (38%). PCO (7%) and PARCO (23%), on the other hand, improved L. leucocephala germination. This work represents one of the first attempt to evaluate the parasitoid effect on seeds germination. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the effect of herbivore predation and the presence of parasitoids on host plant seed germination, which can be critical to mother plant fitness depending on plant species. Further studies are necessary to determine the extend seed consumption by beetles and the presence of their parasitoids may facilitate or impair seed germination, and consequently plant fitness in other systems. © 2022

TI  - Carbon Sequestration Potential of Commercial Agroforestry Systems in Indo-Gangetic Plains of India: Poplar and Eucalyptus-Based Agroforestry Systems
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151614065&doi=10.3390%2ff14030559&partnerID=40&md5=3ff91ea7412ba3b15a35302a8139db51
AB  - Climate change, land degradation, and desertification lead to the loss of carbon present in the soil and plants. The carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere has reached 412 ppm. This is a rise of 47% since the start of the industrial period, when the concentration was close to 280 ppm. Therefore, the sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere to earth is the need of the hour. Many scientists have suggested agroforestry as a potent instrument for climate change mitigation as well as to fetch lucrative benefits. The Indian government is also promulgating tree-based systems for increasing tree cover up to 33% of the total geographical area to mitigate climate change. Therefore, the expansion of the commercial agroforestry system of fast-growing tree species producing higher biomass could be a sustainable and ecologically benign technique to sequester carbon, increase green cover, and improve the financial status of farmers. This review highlights the commercial agroforestry systems, biomass and carbon sequestration potential, and case studies of poplar and eucalyptus. The species such as poplar (Populus deltoides), nilgiri (Eucalyptus spp.), subabul (Leucaena leucocephala), tree of heaven (Ailanthus excelsa), willow (Salix spp.), malabar neem (Melia dubia), cadamba (Neolamarckia cadamba), and white teak (Gmelina arborea) are the suitable tree species for carbon sequestration under agroforestry. Among these species, poplar and eucalyptus are major agroforestry tree species that have been adopted by millions of farmers in India since the 1990s. Indo-Gangetic plains are considered the birthplace of commercial or industrial agroforestry, as poplar and eucalyptus are widely planted. This review reports that poplar and eucalyptus have the potential to sequester carbon stock of 212.7 Mg C ha−1 and 237.2 Mg C ha−1, respectively. Further, the net carbon sequestration rate in poplar and eucalyptus was 10.3 and 12.7 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, respectively. In conclusion, the commercial agroforestry system was very successful in the Indo-Gangetic regions of the country but needs further expansion with suitable compatible crops in different parts of the country. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This study aimed to prepare activated carbon obtained from biomass waste of lamtoro fruit peel, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) (LAC), and analyze its physical as well as electrochemical properties. The preparation process used a simple, uncomplicated, and cost-effective technique that does not require additional adhesive to increase the use value of biomass waste. Furthermore, impregnation with low ZnCl2concentrations at 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 M was performed to maximize the potential of LAC to produce the best conditions from the electrode with the highest specific capacitance. The results showed that the LAC-0.3 sample had the best physical and electrochemical properties with the carbon content reaching 93.05 % and the availability of 6.89 % oxygen heteroatom doping. Besides, the large number of irregular porous lumps in the sample can increase the electrochemical performance of the carbon electrode from 74F/g to 176F/g, with an optimum energy density of 26.81 Wh kg-1and a power density of 96.6 W kg-1obtained using the GCD method. Electrochemical testing for LAC samples was carried out at a low potential of 0-1 V with a scan rate of 1 mV s-1and an aqueous electrolyte of 1 M H2SO4. These findings showed the extraordinary potential of lamtoro fruit peel waste as a basic material for making activated carbon electrodes for supercapacitor with competitive capacitance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In traditional poultry farming, the consumption of fresh plants is an important part of the diet and a fundamental component of the indigenous poultry raising technique. Therefore, the objective is to know the studies that have included some quelites for feeding domestic birds. Quelite is a term used to refer to edible tender plants which are used as a whole plant, sprouts, branches, leaves, petioles, stems or flowers. The present review will consider the quelites Amaranth (Amarantus sp.), Chepil (Crotalaria longirostrada), Epazote (Dysphania ambrosioides), Blackberry (Solanum americanum), Holy grass (Piper autitum), Guaje (Leucaena leucocephala), Huazontle (Chenopodium berlandieri subsp. nuttalliae) and Purslane (Portuca olerecea). Nutritional and nutraceutical characteristics of these chelites are presented. In tests of egg and meat production, both in hens and in native turkeys, the main results of these studies are presented. The use of quelites in poultry farming has begun to be tested in order to reduce production costs, without af fecting the productive variables or the quality of eggs or meat. Although contradictory information has been reported, there is enough evidence to continue this line of study. It is proven that quelites have dif ferent nutritional and nutraceutical properties, which are intended to be used in favor of producers and consumers; however, much research is lacking. © 2023 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

AB  - The main of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementation of tropical tree foliage in ruminant diets on the in vitro fermentation, bacterial population, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and enteric CH4 production. Seven experimental diets were evaluated: a control treatment of Pennisetum purpureum (T7) and six treatments of P. purpureum supplemented (30%) with the foliage of Neomillspaughia emargiata (T1), Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia (T2), Caesalpinia gaumeri (T3), Piscidia piscipula (T4), Leucaena leucocephala (T5), and Havardia albicans (T6). The T2, T7, and T5 treatments had the highest (p < 0.05) digestibility of dry matter. Overall, supplementation increased (p < 0.05) the concentrations of propionic and butyric acid and decreased acetic acid. Methanogenic bacteria decreased (p < 0.05) in T1, T2, T5, and T6. Ruminococcus albus decreased in T1, T2, T3, and T5 and Selenomonas ruminiantum increased in T3. Fibrobacter succinogenes increased, except in T5. Methane production decreased (p < 0.05) in T1, T4, T5, and T6. The supplementation with Leucaena leucocephala, Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia, Neomillspaughia emargiata, Piscidia piscipula, Havardia albicans, and Caesalpinia gaumeri is a potential alternative nutritional strategy for ruminants that results in positive changes in VFAs profile, a decrease on CH4 production and methanogenic bacteria, and changes on fibrolytic and non-fibrolytic bacteria composition.HIGHLIGHTS Tropical tree foliage supplementation increased propionic and butyric acid and decreased acetic acid concentrations. Fibrolytic, non-fibrolytic, and Methanogenic bacteria were selectively modulated with the supplementation of tropical tree foliage. The enteric methane (CH4) production decreased with the supplementation of tree foliage. The supplementation of Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia and Leucaena leucocephala had the highest digestibility and is a potential alternative nutritional strategy for ruminants. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The application of coffee agroforestry has several advantages, such as increasing the cycle of nutrients and soil organic matter as well as improving soil physical properties. However, there is st ill an information gap related to the interaction between coffee plants and shade plant roots. This study aimed to evaluate coffee agroforestry on available water capacity (AWC) and root length density (RLD). The research was carried out at the smallholder coffee plantation in Dampit District in four shade types (coffee-open, shaded with Leucaena leucocephala and shaded with L. leucochepala). Soil and root samples were taken at three depths (0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and 40-60 cm) and at two distances (near the coffee stems and between the coffee shade). The variables observed were AWC, RLD, soil organic C, soil aggregate stability, and soil penetration resistance. The result was coffee plants with shade trees increased AWC value and root density compared to coffee-open. The type of shade significantly affected RLD, where shaded with Gliricidia sepium, and shaded with L. leucochepala were better than coffee-open. This indicates that there was no root competition between coffee plants and shade trees. However, shaded with Musa sp. had lower RLD than coffee-open. Soil depth had a significant effect on the AWC value and root length density of coffee plants, where the most AWC values and coffee root distribution were higher at a depth of 0-20 cm. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - This experiment investigated the effect of dried Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and cassava (Manihot esculenta) leaves on feed intake, milk production, and milk composition of Holstein Friesian x Ankole crossbred cows. Three cows in early lactation, with initial milk production of 4 ± 1.20 kg/day and 359 ± 24 kg average live body weight, were randomly assigned to the experimental diet in a 3x3 Latin square design. Three 15-day experimental periods were adopted (1 to 10-day: diet adaptation and 11 to 15-day: data collection). Cows were fed on freshly chopped Guatemala grass diet supplemented with 1.25 kg DM of brewers’ spent grain (control). The experimental diets were similar to the control diet differing in the presence of dried Leucaena or cassava leaves, both at the inclusion rate of 20% of the basal diet intake. Total dry matter intake, nutrient intake, milk production, and milk composition showed significant variation among treatments. Cows supplemented with dried cassava leaves had higher total dry matter intake and organic matter intake. Leucaena significantly increased (p<0.001) daily milk production by 15% compared to cassava (3%). Leucaena had a higher milk fat content (38.44 g), while cassava and the control diet had higher milk protein (38.53 and 38.43 g), lactose (56.79 g and 56.111 g), and not-fat solids (102.41 g and 101.27 g). These results indicate that dried Leucaena and cassava leaves can be used as protein supplements for Guatemala grass basal diet for crossbred cows to improve milk production and quality. © 2023, Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - Fodder shrubs are important dry season feed sources for livestock in semi-arid environments. It has been proposed that a mixture of leguminous with non-leguminous shrubs may increase rates of N cycling and improve biomass and fodder quality. The objective of the present study was to assess the biomass productivity and fodder quality of leguminous shrubs growing a mixture with non-leguminous shrubs. Three shrub species—the legume Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) and the non-legumes Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) and Moringa oleifera (Lam.)—were grown as legume/non-legume mixtures and as monocultures. Total fodder production and quality were estimated over five harvests at three-month intervals. The Leucaena–Guazuma mixture had the largest fodder production (9045 kg ha−1 year−1), followed by the Leucaena monocrop (7750 kg ha−1 year−1). Total nitrogen accumulation in the foliage was also high in the Leucaena–Guazuma mixture, reaching 282 kg ha−1 year−1; the Leucaena monocrop accumulated 244 kg N, while the Moringa monocrop took up only 46 kg N ha−1. The concentration of polyphenols was high in Leucaena and Guazuma, while Moringa had the lowest value. The high survival and excellent growth rates, as well as the high foliage production observed in Leucaena and Guazuma, suggest that they have the potential to provide high-quality fodder for livestock. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - The Perception of Farmers on Soil Erosion and Conservation Measures in the Surrounding Areas of Lake Ziway, Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160606077&doi=10.1155%2f2023%2f6288288&partnerID=40&md5=645e5ef0f2d91e9dbbb9b08dc7d34e15
AB  - The level of sediment deposited in the Lake Ziway is increasing through time as a result of soil erosion, and eventually the depth of the lake has decreased. Therefore, the objective of the study was to assess farmers' perception of soil erosion and the conservation measures to the surrounding areas of Lake Ziway in the central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. The survey was made using purposive sampling techniques. The survey has considered the 14 Kebeles from the 3 districts adjacent to the lake. From each Kebele, 10 respondents were selected randomly. Totally, 140 respondents were selected from the community. The descriptive statistic was used to compare the dependent variables. The majority of respondents (92.2%) have observed the presence of soil erosion in the study area. The hillsides and slope areas are the major sources of soil erosion, according to 80% of the respondents. The respondents that have identified the most and least susceptible soils to erosion by their textural classes are sand soil (Biyyo Chirecha) (57.1%) and soft clay soil (Biyyo Bole) (1.4%), respectively. The soil erosion is increasing in their cultivated land and surrounding areas. The study has found that most of the respondents (86.5%) are participating in soil and water conservation activities. Leucaena leucocephala, Faidherbia albida, Azadirachta indica, and Schinus molle are the dominant tree species planted in the study area for soil and water conservation purposes. In conclusion, there is heavy soil loss due to erosion on cultivated land from the upland which directly deposited to Lake Ziway as sediment which decreases the lake depth. The study recommends that appropriate soil and water conservation measures and land management should be implemented on erosion prone areas in the Lake Ziway watershed with full participation of all stakeholders including the local farmers. © 2023 Daniel Jaleta Negasa.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effect of leaf meals on the mik production of Friesian Holstein (FH) dairy cows. The 15 FH dairy cows were 5–6 years old and 3–5 months in lactation with a range in milk production of 9–12 kg/d. The leaf meal supplements used as feed comprised elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum), leaf meal of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and Mulberry (Morus alba), partially replacing rice bran, coconut cakel, fish meal, maize epidermis, molasses, and minerals. This study used a completely randomized design with five replications for each of the three treatments: feed concentrate without leaf meal (control, CTL), feed concentrate wit 25% leaf meal (LM25) and feed concentrate with 50% leaf meal (LM50). Feeding the leaf meal to FH dairy cows had no effect on total dry matter intake. However, there was a linear increase in milk yield, and a depression in milk fat, as the level of leaf meal in the diet was increased. © 2023 Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.

TI  - PHYTOCHEMICAL PROFILE AND ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF PLANT EXTRACTS AGAINST PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS OF IMPORTANCE TO THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165014745&doi=10.47163%2fagrociencia.v57i4.2496&partnerID=40&md5=0af689c6b27ed74f3b2e0acbbf74ff32
AB  - Infections caused by pathogenic bacteria are a recurrent problem in the livestock sector, generating important economic losses in the livestock industry. One of the main strategies includes antibiotic therapy; however, its use is limited since pathogenic bacteria present resistance to these drugs, which makes treatment against microbial infections difficult. Therefore, the hypothesis proposed was that ethanolic extracts of native plants from the state of Sonora, Mexico, can inhibit the growth of Gram (+) and Gram (-) pathogenic bacteria related to common infections in the livestock industry. The objective was to evaluate the phytochemical and antimicrobial profile of native plants from the state of Sonora, Mexico. In this study, 17 ethanolic extracts were obtained from native plants of Sonora, and the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the agar diffusion method and by the microdilution technique using reference bacteria from the ATCC collection. The phytochemical profile was evaluated by spectrophotometry and the experimental design used was completely randomized with three replicates per treatment at 95 % confidence. The results showed that extracts of Prosopis velutina, Ibervillea sonorae, Populus alba, Ambrosia ambrosioides, Krameria sonorae, and Leucaena leucocephala were effective in eliminating Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (p ≤ 0.05). In addition, these extracts presented the highest concentration of total polysaccharides, flavones and flavonols, flavanones and dihydroflavonols, tannins and total chlorogenic acid (p ≤ 0.05). Therefore, plant extracts from Sonora, Mexico, represent a natural alternative for the control of Gram (+) and Gram (-) pathogens of importance to the livestock industry. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 4.0 International license.

AB  - The aim of this study was the investigation of how adsorbents made from Leucaena leucocephala (L. Leu) leaf and bark materials were effective in treating wastewater containing methyl red dye (MeReD). The functional groups in the phytochemical elements from the bark and leaves of L.Leu offer active surface sites and enable the adsorption mechanism. The investigations were done in batch mode. Contact time, adsorbent dose concentration, temperature, pH, and initial MeReD concentration were all examined as significant parameters impacting the sorption process. The study found that significant MeReD removal efficiency was achieved after 90 min of contact time, pH 4.0 units, 1.2 gm/L adsorbent dose concentration, 100 ppm initial MeReD quantity, and 30oC temperature. The developed adsorbents were applied to samples gathered from dye companies in Hyderabad and Guntur. The extraction of MeReD (81.2% to 90.0%) from untreated wastewater contaminated with MeReD using developed adsorbents was very efficient. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

TI  - Diversity, Distribution, Ecology, and Utilization of Wild Mushrooms in Bangladesh
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166164526&doi=10.1201%2fb23190-11&partnerID=40&md5=de136da61a4ba8375e45c59e32fa9a7e
AB  - The huge areas of land and wide range of vegetation of Bangladesh provide highly diverse habitats for wild mushrooms that are utilized as food, medicine, nutritional supplements, and minerals for humans. Although mushroom research and production have increased in the country, several different challenges still exist concerning the identification, preservation, and cultivation of wild mushrooms. In this chapter, we describe and evaluate the currently known Bangladeshi diversity of wild mushrooms, their distribution, ecology, and utilization. The sampling regions were tropical moist deciduous forest (TMDF), tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen (TESF), mangrove forest (MF), Gajni forest (GF), and social forest (SF) regions, as well as parks, gardens, and the National Zoo of Dhaka city (PGZD). The mushrooms associated with these jungle territories were photographed, collected, preserved, and analyzed both morphologically and anatomically. A total of 632 wild mushroom samples were collected from 79 sampling sites and a total of 68 wild mushroom genera are identified from Bangladesh. The most predominant genus was Ganoderma with a frequency of 27.20% and a density of 31.20%. Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia saman, Swietenia mahagoni, Terminalia arjuna, and Dalbergia sissoo are common hosts for most of the wild mushrooms in Bangladesh. The most frequent family recorded was the Ganodermataceae, which made up 26.79% of all samples. A total of 16 Bangladeshi wild mushroom genera are edible, 16 are inedible, 25 are medicinal, and 11 are toxic. Documentation and subsequent utilization of diverse elements present in wild mushroom species are needed to fulfill the future food and health security challenge of the unstabilizing hunger of the world. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Gayo coffee is one of the leading commodities originating from the Gayo Highlands, one of which is Bener Meriah Regency. The Gayo coffee commodity cultivated by farmers is Arabica coffee, consisting of Gayo 1, Gayo 2, and Gayo 3 clones. Arabica coffee has been developed by the Gayo community for many years with a continuous cultivation system throughout the year. This coffee farming business is relatively advanced, various introductions have been made, which are based on experience gained from generation to generation (location specific) so that it can affect the performance of the coffee farming business being cultivated. The use of cultivated land for years with a coffee cultivation system causes a decrease in land fertility, resulting in a decrease in coffee production. This study aims to determine the location-specific cultivation techniques for Arabica coffee in Bener Meriah Regency that have been carried out by farmers from generation to generation. The method used is descriptive quantitative analysis using survey methods. The survey method was conducted by conducting direct interviews with respondents, namely farmers who cultivate Arabica coffee. Respondents were determined through Stratified Random Sampling. The results showed were generally farmers using mixed varieties in one garden (59.34%), the spacing varied generally 2.5 meters x 2.5 meters (59.34 %), 82.42% used organic and inorganic fertilizers, only 5.49% used organic fertilizers and 12.09% used inorganic fertilizers. Organic fertilizers are sourced from composted coffee husks. Soil and water conservation measures carried out in coffee plantations are only vegetative methods, the type of shade is generally Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) plants. Generally, herbicides were used for weed control (83.52%) and only 12.09% famers used pesticides to control plant pest organisms. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The study was carried out to determine the chemical composition of composite pellets of Megathyrsus maximus containing Leucaena leucocephala seed meal at the varying level and growth responses, as well as haematological and serum biochemical of rabbits, fed the pellets for 60 days. The treatment consists of M. maximus and L. leucocephala—100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30 and 60:40, respectively. Results revealed an increase (P < 0.05) in the proximate composition of the grass pellets with an increase in seed inclusion while there was a reduction (P < 0.05) in the NDF contents of the pellets. An increase in the tannin contents was recorded with an increase in seed inclusion to the grass pellets. Rabbits fed with 30 and 40% inclusions of seed in the grass pellets had similar weight gain while the lowest feed conversion ratio was recorded in rabbits fed grass with 30% seed inclusion. Packed cell volume, RBC and lymphocyte in rabbits were altered with feeding grass seed pellet (P < 0.05), although no particular pattern was followed. Total protein, globulin and urea contents were reduced in the rabbits as the contents of the seeds in the grass pellets increased. Albumin contents in pellets with 30% of seeds were higher in the rabbits fed the pellets above other treatments. It can be concluded that increasing the seed meal level up to 30% in grass pellets supported growth response without inflicting any side effects on the health indices of the rabbits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Traditional Herbal Remedies in the Management of Metabolic Disorders in Ethiopia: A Systematic Review of Ethnobotanical Studies and Pharmacological Activities
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146678797&doi=10.1155%2f2023%2f1413038&partnerID=40&md5=4ef8101f7f626dae994e1cb8bb57fb8d
AB  - Background. MetS are common throughout the world, including Ethiopia. These have traditionally been treated using medicinal plants, particularly in rural areas where they are freely accessible. This systematic review tried to investigate the treatment of MetS with Ethiopian medicinal herbs and made recommendations for more validation research. A careful analysis of the literature was also conducted on the therapeutic effects of these and other Ethiopian medicinal plants with hepatoprotective and antihypertensive activities. Methods. The relevant keywords "Ethnomedicinal + hypertension,""Ethnopharmacological + hypertension,""Ethnomedicinal + hepatitis, jaundices, and liver disease,""Ethnopharmacological + hepatic disorder,"and "Ethnomedicinal + weight loss"were used to search for relevant articles in the major electronic scientific databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search strategy included all articles with descriptions that were accessible until April 30, 2022. The study's subjects, methods, or year of publication were no restrictions in the search. The outcomes were compiled using descriptive statistics. Results. Fifty-four (54) studies were examined in the review that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the treatment of MetS in Ethiopia. The most often used ethnobotanical plant species for the treatment of hypertension and hepatic disorders were Moringa stenopetala and Croton macrostachyus. Both hepatic and hypertensive disorders were treated more frequently with leaves (52% and 39%, respectively) than with roots (20% and 13%, respectively). Some intriguing studies came from an ethnobotanical investigation into medicinal herbs' hepatoprotective and antihypertensive properties. The most often investigated medicinal plant for its antihypertensive effects is Moringa stenopetala. Conclusion. The study revealed that Ethiopians often use anti-MetS herbal remedies. We advocate the experimental validation of the commonly used medicinal plants with the identification of active compounds and the development of effective alternative drugs for the treatment of MetS.  © 2023 Mekdes Alemu Tola et al.

AB  - In order to support livelihoods, enhance food security, restore ecosystem services, and reduce pressure on forests, degraded land can be restored by utilising alternative land-use systems (ALUS), such as silviculture, silvipasture, and hortipasture techniques. ALUS significantly modify the dynamics of soil nutrients in both the surface and subsurface layers. Soils from the 0–15, 15–30, and 30–45 cm layers of Leucaena leucocephala (S)-, Hardwickia binata (H)-, Emblica officinalis (A)-, and Azadiracta indica (N)-based silviculture systems, Acacia nilotica-based silvipasture systems (SPS), natural grassland (NT), and fallow land (F) were sampled in order to better understand the nutrient dynamics of ALUS. Soils under S, H, and SPS had ~203%, 195%, and 129% higher organic carbon (SOC), respectively, than fallow land in the 0–15 cm soil layer. In the subsequent soil layer, those land-use systems had ~199%, 82%, and 110% higher SOC, respectively, than fallow land. Similarly, in the deeper layer, those land uses had ~232%, 23%, and 105% higher SOC, respectively, than fallow land. SPS and NT also improved the SOC concentration significantly over fallow land. Plots under S, H, and SPS had ~198%, 190%, and 125% higher available N, respectively, than fallow land in 0–15 cm soil layer. In the 15–30 cm soil layer, those land-use systems had ~19%9, 82%, and 110% higher available N, respectively, than fallow land. These systems also improved the P and K contents in subsurface soil. Micronutrient concentrations were also improved in soils under S, H, and SPS. Hence, ALUS’ adoption in degraded areas with trees provides a chance for C storage and improves the nutrient dynamics on degraded land. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Ovicidal Effect on Haemonchus contortus of Extract Partitions Shrubby Plants of the Tropical Dry Forest and Potentially Active Compounds Identification by UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap/MS/MS
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164018468&doi=10.3390%2fapp13127147&partnerID=40&md5=b475f8c1f95dcc0cd3a01af4d082c9b2
AB  - The in vitro anthelmintic effect of the extracts on Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) of three forage species in the tropical dry forest is known; however, there is no information about the effects of the extract partitions, nor their chemical composition. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the in vitro ovicidal activity of H. contortus in extract partitions of the species Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Pithecellobium dulce, and to identify the compounds present in the extract partitions with the highest activity by employing ultra HPLC Quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry. Four extract partitions, hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and hydroethanolic from the three forage species were assessed in an inhibition of egg hatching (IEH) assay. The extract partitions with the highest anthelmintic activity (AA) were subjected to analysis, from which the tentative identification of the compounds was established. The extract partitions, including dichloromethane from Gliricidia sepium, ethyl acetate from Leucaena leucocephala, and hydroethanolic from Pithecellobium dulce showed a greater anthelmintic effect, with IC50 values of 0.39, 0.86, and 0.27 mg/mL for the IEH, respectively. Metabolites with in vitro AA potential included flavonoids, fatty acid esters, hydroxycinnamic acids, organic oxygenated compounds of the benzene class and substituted derivatives, phenolic glycosides, and phenols. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Livestock is one of the most important activities, however, it contributes to global warming, becoming one of the major sources of methane emissions. It should be taken into account that diet manipulation is one of the efficient alternatives that allows modifying ruminal fermentation, improving nutrient assimilation and, therefore, reducing methane. Therefore, in this systematic review, the efficacy of nutritional strategies for the reduction of methane gas emissions in cattle was determined by compiling research journals, undergraduate and doctoral theses published in scientific databases in the last 10 years. The databases consulted were Scopus, Dialnet, Redalyc, Science Direct and thesis repositories in Spanish, English and Portuguese. As a result, it was obtained that the variation of methane emissions is related to the amount of feed ingested and the quality, defined by digestibility and fiber content. It is concluded that sunflower oil, linseed oil, starch oil and Leucaena leucocephala present an efficiency of 21.5%, 38%, 12.8% and 61% respectively in reducing enteric CH4 emission. © 2023 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

TI  - Pretreatment of Leucaena Leucocephala Using Deep Eutectic Solvent for Ethanol Production by Kluyveromyces Marxianus UniMAP 1–1
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172239244&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-99-1695-5_6&partnerID=40&md5=2096507d80c5f2102e94e8c0b7255f60
AB  - Conventional pretreatment methods such as alkaline and acid pretreatment which were used in biorefineries to dissolve lignin and hemicellulose faces many drawbacks. These pretreatment methods were considered as toxic not only to the environment, but also to the biomass as further treatment using these solvents will lead to the production of hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural, which can inhibit the production of ethanol. Recently, deep eutectic solvents (DES) have grown in popularity as an alternative solvent to substitute conventional pretreatment solvents. DES have a great number of advantages such as biodegradability, non-toxic, low volatility and low cost. Furthermore, DES also is a powerful solvent to dissolve lignin, thus this makes DES a superior solvent to be used in biorefineries compared to alkaline and acid pretreatment. In this study, Leucaena leucocephala seeds and pods were treated with choline chloride – glycerol (ChCl – Gly) based DES at 1:2 molar ratio, and the performance subjected to sugar released and ethanol production were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The values were then compared with the conventional pretreatment methods as the controls. The results suggested that DES pretreatment released slightly higher total sugar, 29.28 g/L compared to alkaline and acidic pretreatment at 28.77 and 24.94 g/L, respectively. On the other hand, the yield of ethanol after fermentation in DES treatment were among the highest, which was 0.287 g ethanol/g glucose with 56.27% conversion compared to theoretical yield. The purpose of this report is to offer further information in the interest of making DES as a good replacement for the conventional pretreatment method. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an investigation to determine the potential of Leucaena leucocephala as a commercial energy crop for dendro-power generation plants. Dendro-power generation is the generation of electricity from wood fuels. Modern technology enables the efficient, clean and long-term use of wood in dendro power plants. Various tests and calculations have been carried out, such as moisture content, physical analysis and calorific value of tree species. The Leucaena leucocephala yield per unit area of the special plantation for the development of 10 MW dendro power plants was estimated. The development of a 10 MW dendro power plant provides for an annual electricity generation of 50 GWh, which can be used for self-consumption or sold to a power company. This study provides a quantitative approach to estimating the wood requirements for Dendro power generation which has not been done before. From the calculation, the annual fuel consumption of the Dendro power plant requires 48,880 tons/year. Therefore, the total area required for planting the energy plant Leucaena leucocephala is 815 hectares. The number of Leucaena leucocephala trees required to meet the annual fuel consumption of the Dendro power plant is 4,075,000 trees. The implementation of this project will also help the economic development of local communities, especially in rural areas.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Invasive alien plants are considered as one of the major causes of loss of native biodiversity around the world. Remote sensing provides an opportunity to identify and map native and invasive species using accurate spectral information. The current study was aimed to evaluate PlanetScope (3 m) and Sentinel (10 m) datasets for mapping the distribution of native and invasive species in two protected areas in Pakistan, using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The multispectral data were analysed with the following four ML algorithms (classifiers)—random forest (RF), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM)—to classify two invasive species, Lantana camara L. (common lantana) and Leucaena leucocephala L. The (Ipil-ipil) Dzetsaka plugin of QGIS was used to map these species using all ML algorithms. RF, GMM, and SVM algorithms were more accurate at detecting both invasive species when using PlanetScope imagery rather than Sentinel. Random forest produced the highest accuracy of 64% using PlanetScope data. Lantana camara was the most dominating plant species with 23% cover, represented in all thematic maps. Leucaena leucocpehala was represented by 7% cover and was mainly distributed in the southern end of the Jindi Reserve Forest (Jhelum). It was not possible to discriminate native species Dodonea viscosa Jacq. (Snatha) using the SVM classifier for Sentinel data. Overall, the accuracy of PlanetScope was slightly better than Sentinel in term of species discrimination. These spectral findings provide a reliable estimation of the current distribution status of invasive species and would be helpful for land managers to prioritize invaded areas for their effective management. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Plant ingredients in Thai food: a well-rounded diet for natural bioactive associated with medicinal properties
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151013615&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.14568&partnerID=40&md5=142e9d56bd9b33770afa9626a086490f
AB  - Background: Seeking cures for chronic inflammation-associated diseases and infectious diseases caused by critical human pathogens is challenging and time-consuming. Even as the research community searches for novel bioactive agents, consuming a healthy diet with functional ability might be an effective way to delay and prevent the progression of severe health conditions. Many plant ingredients in Thai food are considered medicinal, and these vegetables, herbs, and spices collectively possess multiple biological and pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antipyretic, anticancer, hepatoprotective, and cardioprotective effects. Methodology: In this review, the selected edible plants are unspecific to Thai food, but our unique blend of recipes and preparation techniques make traditional Thai food healthy and functional. We searched three electronic databases: PUBMED, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, using the specific keywords “Plant name” followed by “Anti-inflammatory” or “Antibacterial” or “Antiviral” and focusing on articles published between 2017 and 2021. Results: Our selection of 69 edible and medicinal plant species (33 families) is the most comprehensive compilation of Thai food sources demonstrating biological activities to date. Focusing on articles published between 2017 and 2021, we identified a total of 245 scientific articles that have reported main compounds, traditional uses, and pharmacological and biological activities from plant parts of the selected species. Conclusions: Evidence indicates that the selected plants contain bioactive compounds responsible for anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties, suggesting these plants as potential sources for bioactive agents and suitable for consumption for health benefits.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala stem bark that was eleven years old was studied for its chemical composition and usage. The samples were subjected to chemical analyses based on ASTM standard procedures after being air-dried for several days. The results found that the bark of L. leucocephala has a pH value of 6.04 and that the solubility of the bark in 1% NaOH alkali is the highest compared to the solubility in hot water (14.45%) and cold water (14.36%), while the chemical composition of the bark of L. leucocephala was ash (15.76%); extractives (8.39%); holocellulose (132.85%); hemicellulose (103.66%); cellulose (29.19%) and lignin (38.24%). Based on the findings, L. leucocephala bark was less acidic. When used as a source of carbohydrates, bark has a high solubility, and its chemical composition may have an impact on how quickly it burns when it is pyrolysed. © 2023 Statny Drevarsky Vyskumny Ustav.

AB  - Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a highly polyphagous insect pest, which inflicts serious economic damage on many agricultural and horticultural crops globally. During our recent surveillance surveys, an unusual defoliation was noticed by a caterpillar pest on cocoa saplings at ICAR - Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Regional Station, Vittal farm, Karnataka, India. Morphological identification and molecular characterization using mitochondrial cytochrome-c-oxidase (COI) gene confirmed the collected insect samples as S. litura. Hitherto, this species was only known to infest Leucaena leucocephala (CABI), a shade tree of cocoa plantations in Indonesia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of infestation by tobacco cut worm on cocoa in India. Consequently, solarization of rooting medium has been suggested for the destruction of the quiescent pupal stage. © 2023 Lepidopterists' Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several tree legume species’ (Caesalpinia pulcherrima, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Leucaena leucocephala, Pithecellobium dulce, Samanea saman, Sesbania grandiflora and Tamarindus indica) mature seeds were investigated for their lipophilic fraction profile. The oil yield ranged 2.1–14.9%. Linoleic acid was generally dominant (31.86–62.28%), followed by oleic (14.95–33.84%) and palmitic (7.21–17.54%) acid. Total tocochromanol content ranged 41.7–326.0 mg 100 g−1 oil. Tocopherols (Ts), especially α-T (23.0–197.8 mg 100 g−1 oil) and γ-T (7.3–264.0 mg 100 g−1 oil), dominated, and the seeds either did not contain tocotrienols or the content was negligible. Total carotenoid content ranged 2.1–11.8 mg 100 g−1 oil. Only C. pulcherrima and P. dulce contained squalene. The total sterol content ranged 94–1810 mg 100 g−1 oil, and the seeds contained mostly β-sitosterol, Δ5-stigmasterol, campesterol and cycloartenol. Although the oil yield is too low for commercial oil production, some of the studied species (C. pulcherrima, L. leucocephala and T. indica) could be considered as bioactive compound-rich oil sources. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The paper reports Boron (B) uptake using Leucaena leucocephala seed pods (LLSP) as a pre-treatment for reverse osmosis seawater desalination. The process increases the quality of the membrane-entering nutrient water. The research investigated a new, low-cost biosorption technique for boron from Gaza shore on the Mediterranean Sea at a distance of 300 m from shore and 1 m deep. The maximum adsorption efficiency reached 85.7% at pH 12, 30 min contact time, and adsorbent dosage of 2 g/100 ml seawater. The initial and final concentration of boron was measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP). The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were applied to the adsorption data. The kinetic data for removal processes were fitted with the pseudo-second-order model. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a legume forage plant that has a high protein content. Tissue culture is a technique that can be used to select mutants for forage plants in vitro. IBA (Indole butyric acid) is one type of auxin that can induce rooting and growth in plants. This study aimed to select the morphological characteristics of the acid-tolerant Leucaena leucocephala mutant to the addition of the hormone IBA in tissue culture. The design used in this study was a completely randomized design (CRD) with lamtoro plant explants as many as 11 acid-tolerant mutant lines pH 3.4 resulting from 400 gy irradiation which had been treated on 300 ppm Al3+ acid media, namely the K1-K11 strain (mutant+MS+1ppm IBA) and 2 parent trees Leucaena leucocephala without gamma irradiation, namely P0 as Leucaena leucocephala parent+MS+0ppm IBA, P1 as Leucaena leucocephala parent + MS + 1 ppm IBA with 15 replicates. The treatment which had a significant effect was continued with the test Tukey. Variables observed were an increase in root length, plant vertical height, number of shoots, and percentage of rooted plants. The increase in root length and increase in plant vertical height showed the best results on the K10 mutant strain, the number of shoots showed the best results on the K9 and K11 mutant strains, and the highest percentage of rooted plants on the K3 and K11 mutant strains. The addition of IBA can increase the morphological characteristics of the Leucaena leucocephala mutant. © 2022, Indonesian Center for Animal Research and Development. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salinity is one of the most detrimental abiotic stresses to the productivity of crops. Saline lands can be easily transformed into commercial forest plantations by growing high value tree species. Therefore, present investigation was undertaken to assess the effect of saline irrigation (ECiw ~ 9), including control, and ten different host species (Melia dubia, Dalbergia sissoo, Azadirachta indica, Casuarina equisetifolia, Acacia ampliceps, Citrus aurantium, Punica granatum, Syzygium cumini, Phyllanthus emblica, and Leucaena leucocephala) on growth, physiological processes and salinity tolerance of sandalwood (Santalum album L.). Results revealed that hosts D. sissoo, A. indica, and M. dubia maintained high (p < 0.05) K+ /Na+ ratio and resulted in higher growth of sandalwood under salinity stress. The plant growth traits of sandalwood showed variable trends of decline with different hosts under the same conditions. The biomass of sandalwood decreased by 41–75% under salinity stress; resulting in the substantial differences for salinity tolerance varying from 25 to 59.8%. Sandalwood grown with D. sissoo produced maximum (p < 0.05) biomass under salinity stress as well as depicted higher salinity tolerance. The growth parameters (collar diameter, height, and biomass) of sandalwood exhibited a highly negative (p < 0.05) correlation with Na+ ion under salinity stress. Hosts M. dubia, D. sissoo, and A. indica showed only a slight decline in growth and biomass of sandalwood under salinity stress. Results suggested that sandalwood growth is modulated mainly by host species under both control and salinity stress, and thus have immense potential for cultivation with suitable host in the degraded saline soils. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article describes the synthesis of polyesteramide (PEA) resin from Leucaena leucocephala oil (LLO) obtained from seeds of L. leucocephala tree, locally grown in King Saud University Campus. LLO was transformed into amide diol by based catalyzed amidation reaction, followed by esterification reaction with malic acid (MA), that resulted in LLO-based PEA (LPEA). The synthesis was performed without using any solvent or catalyst. Fourier-transformation infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the formation of LPEA by the introduction of amide and ester moieties. LPEA was further reinforced with nano graphene oxide (GO) and fabricated into nanocomposite corrosion protective coatings (LPEA/GO). LPEA/GO coatings obtained were tough, flexibility retentive and showed good corrosion resistance performance toward 3.5 w/w% NaCl medium. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed good thermal stability of coatings with safe usage up to 200°C. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

TI  - Study of Substitution Leaves (Leucaena leucocephala, Lannea coromondalica and Gliricidia sepium) in Elephant Grass Basal Ration
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163279201&doi=10.1063%2f5.0144002&partnerID=40&md5=abf5510dd8da7d49268460262f458488
AB  - Elephant grass is the most widely cultivated type of grass by livestock farmers in Indonesia. However, the livestock performance of the elephant grass-feeding system is still low due to the amount of protein lost during the degradation process in the rumen. Provision of plants containing high protein and tannin can reduce protein wastage and increase the digestibility and protein consumption in cattle-fed elephant grass. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of Leucaena leucocephala, Lannea coromondalica, and Gliricidia sepium as substitute leaves on dry matter consumption (DMC) and dry matter digestibility (DMD) of elephant grass basal rations. Four female Kacang goats (12 months old) were arranged in a Latin Square Design with 4 treatments and 4 replications (10 days for adjustment period and 7 consecutive days for data collection). The treatments applied were the levels of three leaves as substitutes for elephant grass basal ration, i.e., R1=Elephant grass 100% (as a control), R2=Elephant grass 60%+Gliricidia sepium 40%; R3=Elephant grass 60%+Leucaena leucocephala 40%; and R4=Elephant grass 60%+ Lannea coromondalica 40%, respectively. The results showed that the substitution leaves of Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, and Lannea cromondalica in the elephant grass feed had a significant effect (P<0.05) on DMC and DMD, respectively. The average of as follows DMC (R1=0.19; R2=0.28; R3=0.29; and R4 0.26 kg/head/day, respectively and DMD was R1=0.91%; R2= 0.89%; R3=0.86%; and R4=0.88% respectively. The substitute of the tannin-containing plants in the elephant grass basal goat rations, on the one hand, could increase the dry matter consumption but lower the digestibility of feed on the other hand. There is a tendency of better value on the digestibility of the inclusion of 40% Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) leaves in basal rations of Elephant grass. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

TI  - An innovative insecticidal approach based on plant protease inhibitor and Bt protoxins inhibits trypsin-like activity in zebrafish

AB  - The Leucaena leucocephala trypsin inhibitor (LTI) + Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protoxins mix has been proposed as a novel larvicide agent in order to control the vector mosquito of dengue virus, Aedes aegypti, in their aquatic breeding sites. However, use of this insecticide formulation has raised concerns about its impacts on aquatic biota. In this context, this work aimed to assess the effects of LTI and Bt protoxins, separately or in combination, in zebrafish, in regard to the evaluation of toxicity at early life stages and to the presence of LTI inhibitory effects on intestinal proteases of this fish. Results showed that LTI and Bt concentrations (250 mg/L, and 0.13 mg/L, respectively), and LTI + Bt mix (250 mg/L + 0.13 mg/L) - 10 times superior to those with insecticidal action – did not cause death nor did it induce morphological changes during embryonic and larval development (3 to 144 h post-fertilization) of zebrafish. Molecular docking analyses highlighted a possible interaction between LTI and zebrafish trypsin, especially through hydrophobic interactions. In concentrations near to those with larvicidal action, LTI (0.1 mg/mL) was able to inhibit in vitro intestinal extracts of trypsin in female and male fish by 83 % and 85 %, respectively, while LTI + Bt mix promoted trypsin inhibition of 69 % in female and 65 % in male ones. These data show that the larvicidal mix can potentially promote deleterious effects to nutrition and survival in non-target aquatic organisms, especially those with trypsin-like dependent protein digestion. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Resiliencies of soil phosphorus fractions after natural summer fire are governed by microbial activity and cation availability in a semi-arid Inceptisol
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140342279&doi=10.1016%2fj.envres.2022.114583&partnerID=40&md5=3f4d70aed8bc0d681eb19423c45affe0
AB  - The unintended impact of natural summer fire on soil is complicated and rather less studied than its above-ground impact. Recognising the impact of a fire on silvopastoral soils and their resilience can aid in improving the management of silvopastoral systems. We studied the immediate (after 1 week (W)) and short-term (after 3 months (M)) recovery of different soil biological and chemical properties after the natural fire, with specific emphasis on phosphorus (P) dynamics. Soil samples were collected from four different layers (0–15, 15–30, 30–45, and 45–60 cm) of Morus alba, Leucaena leucocephala, and Ficus infectoria based silvopastoral systems. In the 0–15 cm soil layer, soil organic carbon (SOC) declined by ∼37, 42, and 30% after the fire in Morus-, Leucaena-, and Ficus-based systems, respectively within 1W of fire. However, after 3M of fire, Morus and Leucaena regained ∼6 and 11.5% SOC as compared to their status after 1W in the 0–15 cm soil layer. After 1W of the fire, soil nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and potassium availability declined significantly at 0–15 cm soil layer in all systems. Iron and manganese availability improved significantly after 1W of the fire. Saloid bound P and aluminium bound P declined significantly immediately after the fire, increasing availability in all systems. However, calcium bound P did not change significantly after the fire. Dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activity declined significantly after the fire, however, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activity were unaltered. Resiliencies of these soil properties were significantly impacted by soil depth and time. Path analysis indicated microbial activity and cationic micronutrients majorly governed the resilience of soil P fractions and P availability. Pasture yield was not significantly improved after the fire, so natural summer fire must be prevented to avoid loss of SOC, N, and S. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - RNA viruses have been the most destructive due to their transmissibility and lack of control measures. Developments of vaccines for RNA viruses are very tough or almost impossible as viruses are highly mutable. For the last few decades, most of the epidemic and pandemic viral diseases have wreaked huge devastation with innumerable fatalities. To combat this threat to mankind, plant-derived novel antiviral products may contribute as reliable alternatives. They are assumed to be nontoxic, less hazardous, and safe compounds that have been in uses in the beginning of human civilization. In this growing COVID-19 pandemic, the present review amalgamates and depicts the role of various plant products in curing viral diseases in humans.  © 2023 Anamika Paul et al.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam de wit) is a valuable source of bioactive metabolites with high preventive and therapeutic effectiveness. Here, and taking into account the effect of geographical location and maturation stage, we aimed to investigate the chemical composition of phenolic, fatty acid profiles (GC-FID) and biological activities from L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) seed oil and leave extracts. The results indicated that L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) ethanolic leaves extracts growing in Ariana have the highest levels in phenolic and flavonoid contents and showed remarkable antioxidant activities. Furthermore, L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) oils extracted from seeds growing in two locations at different maturation stage were analyzed using GC-FID to determine fatty acids profiles and significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between growing area and maturation stage. In addition, both oils and ethanolic extract of L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) were able to limit gram positive and gram negative bacteria, Candida species as well as the tested filamentous fungi species, and the examination of results prove that the diameter of zone inhibition was related to the tested microorganisms. The results credibly indicate that L. leucocephala (Lam de wit) leaves and seeds are nutrient-rich and can contribute effectively to the daily nutrient requirements alongside its therapeutic properties. © 2022, The Tunisian Chemical Society and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Effects of supplementing rice straw with two fodder tree leaves and their combinations on voluntary feed intake, growth, and nitrogen utilization in sheep
PY  - 2023

AB  - Fodder tree leaves (FTL) are limitless nutrient resources that provide high-quality feed, particularly during the dry season, improving animal diets, and reducing the use of concentrates in ruminant livestock farming. In order to determine the benefits of FTL, two experiments were conducted to measure the voluntary feed intake, growth performance, and nitrogen utilization of forest-type (FT) sheep fed rice straw (RS) and supplemented with either Leucaena leucocephala (LEU) or Samanea saman (SAM) or their equal combination (LS). For the growth trial (Experiment 1), 12 male FT sheep with mean initial body weight (BW) of 17.0 ± 1.0 kg (mean ± SD) were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments in a Completely Randomized Design. The diets were Urea-treated RS (UTS) (Control), RS + L (LEU), RS + S (SAM), and RS + 50% L + 50% S (LS). After 14 d of adjustment period, feed intakes and refusals were recorded daily, whereas BW was recorded bi-weekly for 12 wk. Four rams weighing 17.0 ± 1.0 kg BW were randomly assigned to the four treatments over a four period in a repeated (4 × 4) Latin square design to estimate the nitrogen (N) balance study (Experiment 2). Treatment diets were the same as that of Experiment 1. Dry matter intake of straw was highest (P = 0.0001) for sheep fed UTS. However, combining L with S increased (P = 0.0001) straw DM intake compared to feeding L or S alone. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in total feed intake between sheep offered UTS and LS, but both were significantly higher (P = 0.0001) than those offered LEU and SAM. Body weight gain (3.70 kg) and growth rate (196.15 g/d) were highest (P = 0.0001) for sheep offered LS compared to the other treatment groups. Values for N balance differed (P = 0.0001) among treatment diets. N balance for LUE and LS supplemented diets were higher than that of SAM but all were higher (P = 0.0001) than those offered UTS. Leucaena and Samanea leaves could, therefore, be utilized as supplement to poor-quality straws to improve the productivity of small ruminants especially during the long dry seasons in the tropics. © 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Mimosine facilitates Fe uptake by Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata in alkaline soils by solubilizing Fe-oxides
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142018188&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-022-05789-4&partnerID=40&md5=e425505a05f4450a6c9775d66102915a
AB  - Purpose: Giant leucaena is a tropical tree-legume that thrives in alkaline and calcareous soils. It contains large amounts of mimosine, the physiological role of which is not well understood. The goals of this study were to determine i) if mimosine is released by giant leucaena into the rhizosphere ii) if mimosine enhances solubility of Fe present in various forms in alkaline soil, and iii) if mimosine enhances transition metal uptake in giant leucaena. Methods: Mimosine in the extracts of rhizosphere soil and root exudates was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to determine if it is released by giant leucaena. Iron concentration in tissue and aqueous samples was determined by ICP-OES analysis. Results: Mimosine was detected in both the rhizosphere eluates and root exudates. Mimosine added to samples of goethite, hematite and FeCl3 increased Fe solubility in water. Giant leucaena plants grown in alkaline soils and supplied with mimosine had higher levels of chlorophyll, Fe and Mn than the control plants. Conclusion: Mimosine is released by giant leucaena roots into the rhizosphere, where it interacts with Fe. Mimosine enhances solubility of insoluble Fe-oxides and prevents conversion of ferric Fe to insoluble oxides at an alkaline pH. Mimosine enhances Fe and Mn uptake in plants growing in alkaline soil conditions. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Iron nanoparticle (INP) is one of metal nanoparticles that have a wide application such as adsorbent, catalyst, drug delivery, indicator in health analysis, etc. Usually, INP is synthesized by physical or chemical means. Both methods have their respective advantages and disadvantages. However, with the increased awareness of green chemistry and technology, green synthesis of INP, using various plant extracts, has become a huge interest. In this study, we utilized crude extract of leucaena seed (Leucaena leucocephala) as green solvent to synthesize INP. The synthesis was done by mixing leucaena crude extract with 0.1 M FeCl3 with volume ratio 1:1. The mixture turned to a dark violet color, indicating a complex formation between Fe3+ ions and organic compounds in the extract. After pH adjustment to 6, iron precipitate was separated, dried, and calcined at 500°C for 3h. The obtained INP was characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy - Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). It was found that the INP was in form of agglomerate, and after calcination smaller agglomerate was observed without any presence of organic compounds. The calcination also changed the phase of INP to be more crystalline with hematite phase as dominant structure. Further application as Fenton-like catalyst showed increase of methylene blue degradation kinetics to 5 times compared with one without catalyst. A 32% methylene blue removal was obtained with initial methylene blue concentration of 10 ppm, INP concentration 40 mg/L after 180 min reaction. © 2022 Author(s).

AB  - This investigation was carried out in three different locations to examine the impact of legume forage as a protein source on lipi d regulation and growth. This study used 120 rams, consisting of 40 rams in each location (Garut, Cianjur, Sukabumi) spread along the South Coast of West Java. Physical environmental conditions were recorded during the study. Ram lambs at each location were divided into four groups; one group only received a basal diet (Setaria/Setaria sphacelata), and the other three groups were each given additional legumes (calliandra/Calliandra calothyrsus, lamtoro/Leucaena leucocephala, and moringa/Moringa oleifera). Blood samples were collected every two weeks during the 16 weeks experiment. The blood sampling was handled based on standard procedures to prevent sample damage, and the body weight was measured every two weeks. Sample analysis related to lipid regulation and creatine kinase activity was measured using spectrophotometric techniques according to the instructions of the Kit Randox protocol and analysis of blood plasma fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography. The research results show that legumes as a protein source can regulate through molecular signaling to decrease lipid levels, saturated fatty acids, and lipid transport in the extracellular fluid, but increase unsaturated fatty acid and the growth rate of ram lambs. Based on the results of the current study, it can be a strong basis for the development of nutrigenomic aspects of protein for small ruminants, accompanied by studies of the ages of different ruminant samples. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Non-typhoidal invasive Salmonella (NTiS) diseases are one of the most important zoonoses in the world. This study explored the antipathogenic potential of twenty-four plants used in Benin folk medicine against NTiS diseases. The in vitro antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of ethanolic plant extracts were screened against clinical resistant isolates and ATCC reference strains of Salmonella. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-infected rat model was used to examine the in vivo antibacterial potential of plant extracts. Of the 24 plants, 18 plants exhibited antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.156 to 1.25 mg/mL. Anacardium occidentale, Artemisia afra, Detarium microcarpum, Detarium senegalense, and Leucaena leucocephala were the most active plant species. Extracts from A. afra, D. microcarpum, and D. senegalense showed biofilm inhibition greater than 50% against Salmonella clinical isolates. In the rat model of infection, A. afra and D. senegalense extracts were found to have an effective dose of less than 100 mg/kg and to stop the salmonellosis after 10 days of treatment. Additionally, these extracts did not produce any toxic effects in the treated animals. These results indicate clear evidence supporting the anti-Salmonella activity of A. afra and D. senegalense. Further studies are now needed to isolate bioactive compounds and to ensure the safety of these plant species. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Four Invasive Plant Species in Southwest Saudi Arabia Have Variable Effects on Soil Dynamics
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151486492&doi=10.3390%2fplants12061231&partnerID=40&md5=23c0813a4dcef3f783ba3fccf2afe786
AB  - Predicting the direction and magnitude of change in soil dynamics caused by invasive plant species has proven to be difficult because these changes are often reported to be species- and habitat-specific. This study was conducted to determine changes in three soil properties, eight soil ions, and seven soil microelements under established stands of four invasive plants, Prosopis juliflora, Ipomoea carnea, Leucaena leucocephala, and Opuntia ficus-indica. Soil properties, ions, and microelements were measured in sites invaded by these four species in southwest Saudi Arabia, and these values were compared to the results for the same 18 parameters from adjacent sites with native vegetation. Because this study was conducted in an arid ecosystem, we predict that these four invasive plants will significantly alter the soil properties, ions, and microelements in the areas they invaded. While the soils of sites with the four invasive plant species generally had higher values for soil properties and ions compared to sites with native vegetation, in most instances these differences were not statistically significant. However, the soils within sites invaded by I. carnea, L. leucocephala, and P. juliflora had statistically significant differences for some soil parameters. For sites invaded by O. puntia ficus-indica, no soil properties, ions, or microelements were significantly different compared to adjacent sites with native vegetation. Sites invaded by the four plant species generally exhibited differences in the 11 soil properties, but in no instance were these differences statistically significant. All three soil properties and one soil ion (Ca) were significantly different across the four stands of native vegetation. For the seven soil microelements, significantly different values were detected for Co and Ni, but only among stands of the four invasive plant species. These results indicate that the four invasive plant species altered soil properties, ions, and microelements, but for most of the parameters we assessed, not significantly. Our results do not support our initial prediction, but are in general agreement with previous published findings, which indicate that the effects of invasive plants on soil dynamics vary idiosyncratically among invasive species and among invaded habitats. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Edible mushrooms are increasingly recognized to offer health, environmental and socio-economical benefits across the globe. However, long cultivation time and low nutritional value of harvested mushrooms have remained the limiting factors for taping the benefits and sustainable production in developing counties. There is therefore a need to seek for alternative substrate formulations that would shorten cultivation time, increase the nutritional value of mushrooms as well as ensure environmental sustainability. This study examined the potential of using nutrient and biomass rich Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit foliage in combination with the rice straw (traditional substrate) to bolster production and nutritional value of Pleurotus floridanus mushroom in Morogoro, Tanzania. Mushrooms were grown in 30 × 40 cm 1.6 kg dry weight polythene bags in a randomized complete block design experiment with five treatments. The shortest cultivation period (average of 21 days) which stemmed largely from spawning to full mycelia colonization was attained when 5% Leucaena foliage was mixed with the rice straw. There was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in protein content from 23.3 to a maximum of 29.8%, when rice straw was supplemented with the 5% Leucaena, while further increase in Leucaena supplementation caused a lowering of crude protein content. There were significant increases (P < 0.05) in the contents of copper and calcium minerals when 5% of Leucaena foliage was incorporated into the growing substrate. Thus, to increase production cycle and contents of protein and essential minerals, addition of 5% of L. leucocephala foliage is recommended during production of P. floridanus using rice straw, for sustainability. © 2022 The Author

AB  - The Fitzroy Basin in central Queensland has the largest cattle herd of any natural resource management region in Australia, and legumes have been widely used to boost fertility of rundown soil and improve cattle liveweight gains. However, there is a paucity of information on the effect of leguminous pastures on hydrology and water quality. This study investigated runoff water quality over eight hydrological years from virgin brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) woodland and three improved pastures, namely, buffel grass (Pennisetum ciliare), butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). Runoff event mean concentrations and loads of total and dissolved nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon in addition to total suspended solids are reported. Brigalow woodland had the greatest loss of sediment and nitrogen attributed to the inherently fertile Vertosols (clay soil), but the low occurrence and amount of runoff meant that it had a low risk to water quality. Despite a similar number of runoff events from the improved pastures, leucaena pasture had less total runoff and a lower maximum peak runoff rate in addition to lower nitrogen and carbon in runoff. Total suspended solids and carbon in runoff were greater from grass pasture than from the leguminous pastures, whereas nitrogen and phosphorus were greatest from the butterfly pea pasture, especially in the first 2 years post-planting. Greater exports of phosphorus from the improved pastures were concerning, given the potential for downstream impacts. © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s))

AB  - Increasing the availability of feed ingredients is important for the sustainability of livestock rearing. The use of agricultural waste as animal feed will not only improve food security but also contributes to the alleviation of environmental problems associated with waste management. This study aims to evaluate the growth performance of local sheep fed with agricultural waste in the form of silage and wafers. The study consisted of five treatments and four groups using 20 local male sheep. The results showed that feeding local sheep with agricultural waste in the form of silage and wafers had a significant (P < 0.05) effect on the dry matter, crude protein, and crude fat intake and was able to increase final body weights and feed efficiency compared to sheep fed with conventional feed. Processing of agricultural waste into silage and wafers can improve the performance of local sheep so that agricultural waste has great potential to be used as animal feed. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of soil contamination by nickel and lead on some enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in addition to the nitrate reductase (NR) enzyme activity for Gleditsia triacanthos, Leucaena leucocephala, and Robinia pseudoacacia plant species. The results of this study show a significant increase in peroxidase enzyme activity and a significant decrease in catalase enzyme activity, proline, total carotenoids, and total carbohydrate content of leaves of the three species with increasing the concentration of Ni and Pb except for the total carbohydrate, which increased only for L. leucocephala species. Each NR enzyme activity and ascorbic acid content are increased significantly with increasing the concentration of Ni and Pb for G. triacanthos, L. leucocephala, and on the contrary, they decreased significantly for R. pseudoacacia species. From the result, we can conclude a general increase or decrease in leaves content of some antioxidants content for all the species, whereas there is some peculiarity according to the plant species regarding other contents, which in turn reflects different mechanisms of these species to tolerant heavy metal stress. © 2022 Sargul A.

AB  - Slope erosion and shallow failures occur in developed areas in Malaysia as a result of the natural vegetation removal, resulting in soil disturbance and greater exposure of bare ground. The use of bioengineering techniques through vegetation is a preferred solution to these problems by providing cover from rainfall and reinforcing the soil through root systems. Considering the potential of bioengineering in slope management, the current study aims to (i) review slope bioengineering techniques that uses vegetation to stabilise slope in Malaysia and (ii) highlight research gaps. Findings were discussed from 17 original studies published between 2000 and 2020, which were selected from the output of four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar), several grey literature works, and local scientific publications. The studies on bioengineering using vegetation recorded that several slope species with superior performance in terms of beneficial traits, such as root length density and transpiration rate, were more prominent in Melastoma malabathricum and Leucaena leucocephala. Moreover, previous studies identified biomaterials that protected slopes, including empty fruit bunch and geotextiles, despite the currently critical limitations in the applicability of these techniques. This study highlighted the research gaps that may lead to the progress of the bioengineering techniques, such as beneficial traits and techniques, the exploration of mix-culture systems, and the utilisation of modelling techniques. This review serves as a structured and current overview of bioengineering knowledge for shallow slope instability and erosion management in Malaysia. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.

TI  - EVALUATION OF IPIL-IPIL (Leucaena leucocephala) SEED GUM AS CO-ENCAPSULATING AGENT FOR TARGETED AND CONTROLLED DELIVERY OF POWDERED INSULIN PLANT (Chamaecostus cuspidatus)
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147771794&doi=10.55251%2fjmbfs.6149&partnerID=40&md5=9f0d810d4c4c1c1fe5017a233e6ac545
AB  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is the most common non-communicable disease in the Philippines, characterized by increased blood glucose levels brought by low insulin production or insulin resistance. Chamaecostus cuspidatus is a medicinal plant known for its glucose-lowering property. The controlled release of the C. cuspidatus leaves must be achieved to maximize its antidiabetic property. Leucaena leucocephala is an endemic tree in the Philippines, having its seed as a source of possible co-encapsulating material for drug delivery. Galactomannan, as the main component of the isolated seed gum, can be used as a substitute for an effective moderate drug release to its intended site. Thus, this study evaluates the drug release property and stability of seed gum as a co-encapsulating agent for targeted and controlled delivery of the C. cuspidatus leaves. The encapsulation process of the C. cuspidatus leaves was done through the extrusion method. The stability of the encapsulation was evaluated through in vitro gastrointestinal simulation analysis and was examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) to verify its surface morphology. The capsules were observed to fully disintegrate at the fed state (pH 5.4) of the simulated gastrointestinal conditions, which is the target site. The fingerprint on the FTIR spectra of the encapsulated drug presented indicates the successful incorporation of the powdered leaves inside the encapsulating material. Morphological micrographs have shown that the resulting capsules were fairly in spherical, having a size of approximately 3.8 mm. Ridges and pores are also present on the surface of the capsules for their immediate disintegration and hydration. Therefore, the L. leucocephala seed gum can be a potential candidate as a co-encapsulating material suitable for effective, targeted, and controlled delivery of C. cuspidatus leaves for maximum antidiabetic benefits. © 2023,Journal of Microbiology, Biotechnology and Food Sciences.

AB  - What should we change in the future? As a consequence of the one health, one welfare and one biology concepts, for most of our decisions we should be less human-centred if we want our species and other species to survive. Humans are less special than many people think. People consider that we have moral obligations to the animals that we use and to the sustainability of systems. A system or procedure is sustainable if it is acceptable now and if its expected future effects are acceptable, in particular in relation to resource availability, the consequences of functioning and morality of action. Consumers may refuse to buy unacceptable products and pressurise retail companies and governments to ensure that they are not sold. Poor welfare of people, poor welfare of other animals, genetic modification, or harmful environmental effects may make systems unsustainable. Most of the public now think of farm and companion animals as sentient beings and have concerns about their welfare. There are many components of sustainability and all should be evaluated and scored. Examples of attempts to do this are life cycle analysis and evaluation of externalities for agricultural or other products. Some topics considered include: straw use; which animals to keep as pets; stray dogs; free-roaming cats; feedlots; silvopastoral systems; free-range cattle; preserving land for hunting; land-sparing or land-sharing; zoos and conservation; and cell-culture of meat. © 2022, University of Zagreb, Facultty of Veterinary Medicine.

AB  - Nitrogen metabolism and the production of primary and secondary metabolites vary according to biotic and abiotic factors such as trace elements (TE) stress, and can, therefore, be considered biomarkers. The present study evaluated the effect of copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) TE, separately, on the metabolism of nitrogen compounds and biomass production, partitioned into shoot and roots of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit., and identified possible defense mechanisms linked to nitrogen metabolism. At 120 days of cultivation, the biomass production of L. leucocephala was higher when exposed to excess Fe than Cu. Nonetheless, the biomass gain (%) of plants exposed to Cu was higher, especially the biomass gains in roots. The tolerance and biomass production of L. leucocephala is related to the regulation of nitrogen metabolism and production of secondary metabolites. The biochemistry of plant metabolism against the excess of Cu and Fe TE manifested similarly, but with some specifics regarding the chemical nature of each metal. There was a reduction in the content of ureides and proteins and an increase in amino acids in the roots in relation to the increase in Cu and Fe concentrations. There was low accumulation of proline in the roots in treatments 400 and 500 mg/dm3 compared to the control for both TE. On the other hand, the total phenolic compounds in the roots increased. Our results indicate that the increased synthesis of amino acids and the accumulation of phenolic compounds is involved in the tolerance of L. leucocephala to Cu and Fe. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Decomposition and N release pattern from the leaves of three shrubs species were studied under field conditions. Leaves of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.), Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) and Moringa oleifera (Lam.) and two mixtures, Leucaena + Moringa and Leucaena + Guazuma, in a complete randomized block design, were studied during the dry and wet seasons. Litterbags were randomly distributed in each experimental block and placed on the soil surface, and residues were recovered after 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks. Double exponential model decay was better fitted to describe the pattern of the decay of the release of various leaf constituents. Litter dry weight loss and N release were faster from Moringa, followed by the Leucaena + Moringa mixture, while the Guazuma leaf litter decomposed much slower. In the wet period, a rapid N release was observed for Moringa (60%) and Leucaena + Moringa (43%) in the first two weeks. In contrast, Guazuma and the Leucaena + Guazuma mixture released about 46% of N in 16 weeks. In the dry period, leaves released most of their N during the first 8 to 16 weeks. Moringa and Leucaena + Moringa ranked first, having lost 81 and 75% of its initial N, respectively. The ratios of condensed tannin and polyphenols to N were significantly correlated with the N released. It was concluded that the initial mass loss from the leaf litter was high and rapid in the rainy period in comparison to the dry period. The residue disappearance pattern of Moringa, Leucaena and Leucaena + Moringa followed an asymptotic model, with more than 80% of the original residue released during the 16-week study period. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Samples of twelve species belong to mimosoideae were collected from baghdad. The current study aimed to screen the bioactive compounds from leaves methanol extracts of twelve species from Mimosoideae to assess the phytochemical compounds properties. The twelve species of Mimosoideae were Acacia cyanophylla Lindl., Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd., Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth., Albizia julibrissin Durazz, Calliandra haematocephala, Leucaena leucocephala subsp leucocephala, Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata, Mimosa pudica L., Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth., Prosopis farcta (Banks &Sol.) J.F. Macbr., and Prosopis juliflora (SW.) DC., belong to seven genera grown in Baghdad/ Iraq. Methanolic leave extracts of these species were subjected to GC/MS analysis. Data obtained from GC/MS isolation revealed that these species were qualitatively and quantitatively differed. Where, C. haematocephala leaves extract contained predominantly 9-Octadecenoic acid, (E)- (cis-oleic acid) of 11.60%, M. pudica possessed 21.03% of Methyl (methyl 4-O-methyl- α-dmannopyranoside) urinate, L. leucocephala sups. leucocephala had 54% of Methyl (methyl 4-O-methyl-α-d, P. farcta involved 29.32 % of 4,6-Di-O-methyl-α-d-galactose. Conclusively, these species were chemically differed. Therefore, the chemical compounds could be used as tool for categorizing the mimosoids species. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - Background: Prostate cancer is a public health problem and increasingly diagnosed in men under 50 years of age. This cancer occurs much more in subjects of advanced age, generally over sixty. The aim of the study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical and histopathological aspects of prostate cancer in men under the age of 50 in Togo. Methods: It was a retrospective descriptive, cross-sectional study of histologically confirmed cases of prostate cancer in young adults at the Pathological Laboratory of Lomé over a period of 10 years (2011–2020). Results: In total, 29 cases of prostate cancer in patients under 50 years of age. The proportion of prostate cancers in men under 50 was 0.7% of all prostate cancers, The average age of the patients was 45 years with extremes of 35 and 49 years. Twelve patients had a family history of prostate cancer, with a statistically significant relationship between the existence of a family history of prostate cancer and the age of onset of the cancer (p-value = 0.03). The dominant clinical information was prostatic hypertrophy (40.37%), followed by acute urine retention (20.69%) and micturition disorders (17.27%). The median Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) was 188 ng/ml with extremes of 20 ng/ml and 2100 ng/ml. A large proportion of patients had a PSA between 100 and 500 ng/ml. Histologically, they were all prostatic acinar adenocarcinomas. These adenocarcinomas were well differentiated (48%) and moderately differentiated (38%). The predominant histoprognostic grade was ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) grade 1 which was noted in 65.52%, followed by grade 2 in 20.69%. Conclusion: Prostate cancer in men under 50 years of age is relatively rare in Togo, sometimes occurring in the context of a family history of prostate cancer. Hence the importance of raising awareness among the male population, especially with a family history of prostate cancer, to start screening early, around the age of 40. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Environmental pollution by textile dye-based wastewater raises a vital call for consideration to industrialists and scientists due to its influence on the ecosystem. In this study, zinc oxide (ZnO), copper oxide (CuO), Manganese dioxide (MnO2), and Magnesium Oxide (MgO) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized from Leucaena leucocephala leaves for the removal of Reactive Golden Yellow-145 (RY-145) and Direct Red-31 (DR-31) dyes. The nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Optimization of various operating parameters like initial dye concentration, pH, temperature, contact time, and dose of nanoparticles was investigated. The results showed that Leucaena leucocephala leaf-mediated ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and MgO nanoparticles presented the highest adsorption capacities for RY-145 of 47.50 (mg/g), 65.53(mg/g), 53.62 (mg/g), and 58.72 (mg/g) respectively, with optimized parameter values of pH solution, contact time, adsorbent dose, initial dye concentration, and temperature were 3, 75 min, 0.05 g/50 mL, 100 mg/L and 25°C on 124 rpm, correspondingly. DR-31 presented the highest adsorption capacities of 57.08 (mg/g), 83.47(mg/g), 67.36 (mg/g), and 72.53 (mg/g) respectively at optimized parameter values of pH solution, contact time, adsorbent dose, initial dye concentration and temperature were 2 and 3, 60min, 0.05 g/50 mL, 100 mg/L and 25°C on 124 rpm. The surfactants and electrolytes effects were also scrutinized on dyes' adsorption. The surfactants and electrolytes' existence in the aqueous media reduced the adsorption of dye because of the competition for limited binding sites. The RY-145 and DR-31 adsorbents adsorption efficiencies were found in following order; MgO (65.52% and 83.47%) > MnO2 (58.72% and 72.53%) > CuO (53.62% and 67.36%) > ZnO (47.50% and 57.08%). The adsorption-based dye data were scrutinized using various isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics models. The studies presented that the adsorption processes were well fitted to pseudo-second-order kinetics since correlation coefficient (R2) values ranged from 0.994 to 0.999 and Intraparticle diffusion models correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.88 to 0.97, their values were relatively near the experimental values signify the adsorption kinetics in both dyes. Both dyes adsorption on green nano-adsorbents followed a Langmuir isotherm due to decent correlation coefficient values of 0.999 with value of 59.17 (mg/g), 66.22 (mg/g), 72.99 (mg/g), and 81.30 (mg/g) respectively for DR-31 and 47.62 (mg/g), 53.763 (mg/g), 58.48 (mg/g), and 64.93 (mg/g) for RY-145 with monolayer coverage. RY-145 also followed Temkin and Doubinin Radushkevich's isotherm. The thermodynamics investigations revealed spontaneous dyes adsorption onto MgO and MnO2, ZnO is non-spontaneous in both dyes while CuO is spontaneous in DR-31 and non-spontaneous in RY-145. The maximum desorption of 78–86% was attained using the 0.2 N and 0.4 N NaOH for adsorbed RY-145 and DR-31 dye respectively. The desorption data was favorable as the Leucaena leucocephala leaf-mediated ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and MgO nanoparticles adsorbents were utilized several cycles and have stability This experimental study also determines the potential efficacy of green nano-adsorbents for the removal of dye from the real textile effluent. In addition, a phytotoxicity investigation of used green nano-adsorbents is carried out on the pea seeds, to demonstrate their sustainability from a real environmental point of view. Thus, Because of their promising efficiency, green ZnO, CuO, MnO2, and MgO nanoparticles have the potential to apply for dye adsorption from textile wastewater. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Studying the characteristics of microorganisms in mine reclamation sites can provide a scientific reference basis for mine land reclamation. Soils in the plough layer (0–20 cm) of the bauxite mine plots in Pingguo city, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, with different reclamation years were used as the research objects. The community structure of soil bacteria was analyzed with high-throughput sequencing technology. The results show the following: (1) Reclamation significantly increased the contents of soil nutrients (p < 0.05). (2) The relative abundances of Proteobacteria were high (22.90~41.56%) in all plots, and reclamation significantly reduced the relative abundances of Firmicutes (3.42–10.77%) compared to that in the control plot (24.74%) (p < 0.05). The relative abundances of α-proteobacteria generally increased while the reclamation year increased. The relative abundances of α-proteobacteria and γ-proteobacteria showed significant positive correlations with soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus nutrients (p < 0.01). The relative abundance of Acidobacteria Group 6 showed significant positive correlations with soil exchangeable Ca and Mg (p < 0.01). (3) Bacterial co-occurrence network showed more Copresence interactions in all plots (50.81–58.39%). The reclaimed plots had more nodes, higher modularity, and longer characteristic path length than the control plot, and the keystone taxa changed in different plots. (4) The chemoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy were the most abundant functional groups in all plots (35.66–48.26%), while reclamation reduced the relative abundance of fermentation groups (1.75–11.21%). The above findings indicated that reclamation improved soil nutrients, changed the bacterial community structure and potential functions, and accelerated the microbial stabilization of the reclaimed soil. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This study was conducted to select a breed based on the morphological characteristics of Kacang goats in the dry land area, by assessing 31 doe Kacang goats. Semi-intensive raising system is carried out (without giving concentrate), yet water; forage (such as Gliricidia sepium leaves, Sesbania grandiflora leaves, Leucaena leucocephala leaves) and local grass are given by applying ad libitum method. Description of morphological characteristics, Pearson's correlation between body weight and body size, and body index, were analyzed using SPSS 25.0 program. The result of descriptive analysis for BW, BL, WH, CG, CW, CD, RW, RH, RL, HL, HW, and HH are 20.72±3.26 kg, 44.34±8.17 cm, 55.42±7.84 cm, 62.68±7.12 cm, 10.98±2.07 cm, 22.74±2.12 cm, 8.44±1.38 cm, 54.96±6.44 cm, 12.55±0.85 cm, 14.07±0.55 cm, 10.19±0.36 cm, dan 11.69±0.45 cm respectively. The value of the morphological index for WS, BI, DI, LI, PI, B, HS, FL, and CI are 0.78+0.12, 71.06±12.38, 0.42±0.06, 0.81±0.18, 67.55±11.93, 0.43±0.08, 11.18±5.78, 32.68±7.40, dan 72.48±2.82, respectively. The conclusion is that the body weight and body measurements in the dry land area are still below the quality National standards of Indonesia. The correlation coefficient of body weight with body size is in the positive range of moderate to high except, the correlation of body weight with head height which shows a negative correlation. The correlation coefficient of body weight with the morphological index is in the low positive range except for the correlation coefficient of body weight with width slope, balance, and height slope which has a negative correlation coefficient. © 2023, Indonesian Center for Animal Research and Development.

AB  - Abstract: The present study was aimed at curating a porous KCl crosslinked hydrogel with purified subabul galactomannans (SG) from the defatted seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) and κ-carrageenan (κC) by inducing whey protein isolate (WPI). WPI showed 345% foam overrun and minimal foam drainage (%) at 70°C when whipped for 5 min at pH 6.8 in the hydrogel prepared with 6.5% w/v SG + 1% w/v κC + 0.63% w/v KCl + 2% w/v WPI. The SG and WPI incorporated porous hydrogel (SGWP) showed maximum G′ (3010 Pa) and frequency independence (>30 Hz) at 65°C. NMR (1H), scanning electron microscopy, and thermal characterization of SGWP showed a crosslinked microporous gel network formation. SGWP had high water uptake rate (Q) (432%) at 45°C. The stability of SGWP at neutral pH and high temperature (65°C) added an impetus to this study as it could be used for a wide range of applications. Hence the protein–polysaccharide complexation improvised the functional properties of the porous hydrogels. The results suggested a possible valorization of galactomannans from subabul, a forest resource, into a porous hydrogel suitable as a matrix for delivery of bioactive(s) or an aerogel for multifarious industrial applications. Practical Application: A porous hydrogel is defined as a solid, or collection of solid bodies, with sufficient open space to enable a fluid to pass through or around them. Leucaena leucocephala seed (forest resource) galactomannans are non-starch polysaccharides having weak gelling capacity. Whey protein isolates (WPI) are a dairy industry byproduct having excellent foaming properties. Incorporation of WPI in the hydrogel prepared with subabul galactomannan and κ-carrageenan using KCl as a crosslin could form a stable porous structure having high water uptake rate (Q) at neutral pH and elevated temperature. The hydrogel so developed could be a step toward circular economy. © 2023 Institute of Food Technologists.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a plant that is used as animal and human food worldwide. This plant contains the toxic compound namely L-mimosine. The main mechanism of action of this compound involves its ability to chelate metal ions, which may interfere with the proliferative activity of cells and being studied for the treatment of cancer. However, little is known about the effect of L-mimosine on immune responses. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of L-mimosine on immune responses in Wistar rats. Different doses of L-mimosine (25, 40 and 60 mg/kg body weight/day) were administered orally by gavage to adult rats for 28 days. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed in animals, but a decrease in the T-dependent response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in animals treated with 60 mg/kg L-mimosine and an increase in the intensity of S. aureus phagocytosis by macrophages in animals treated with 40 or 60 mg/kg L-mimosine were observed. Therefore, these findings suggest that L-mimosine did not compromise macrophage activity and inhibited T-dependent clonal expansion during the immune response. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Successful creation of seedless (sterile) leucaena germplasm developed from interspecific hybridisation for use as forage
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168371807&doi=10.1071%2fCP22281&partnerID=40&md5=cc0b07c6173560bde02bb2a9a983ea8d
AB  - Context: The legume shrub/tree leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.) is highly regarded as a cattle fodder, although it is considered an environmental weed in many parts of Australia. Aims: We investigated the feasibility of developing a forage variety of triploid leucaena through interspecific hybridisation that is sterile (without seeds) as a strategy to mitigate its weed risk. Methods: A conventional breeding strategy was used to create triploid hybrids from hand-crosses between tetraploid and diploid species of leucaena. Molecular markers were developed to confirm successful crosses and flow cytometry was used to confirm the ploidy level. The plants are being evaluated for flowering behaviour, seed and herbage production across two environmentally diverse sites at Carnarvon and Kununurra in northern Western Australia. Key results: During 2018/19 and 2019/20, 2260 crosses between 45 different combinations of diploid females by tetraploid males and their reciprocals have created over 3000 putative triploid hybrid plants. This is the first time that triploids have successfully been created in Australia and 10 new parental combinations were created as a world-first. Conclusions: A cohort of sterile triploid plants has been identified and selections will be made based on their edible biomass productivity, insect tolerance, capacity for regrowth after cutting, nutritive value and plant chemistry (including anti-methanogenic responses). A sterile leucaena variety will have application not only in Australian grazing systems but also in other tropical regions of the world. Implications: A cost-effective technology for mass vegetative propagation of leucaena will be required for commercialisation of a sterile variety.  © 2023 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

TI  - Remediation of Environmental Contaminants Through Phytotechnology

AB  - Environmental pollution caused by organic pollutants, radionuclides, and potentially toxic elements (PTEs) affects the quality of the biosphere (water, air, and soil). Rapid industrial growth, mining, agricultural inputs, sewage water, and industrial effluents application in soil all contribute to contamination. Remediation of these valuable resources, as well as prevention of new pollutants, have long been required to avoid negative health effects. Several remediation strategies have been applied for environmental pollutants. Phytoremediation is potentially a viable and promising approach which uses green plants to remove, detoxify, or degrade toxic PTEs from the environment. In this review, the application of phytotechnology for pollutants removal and their underlying mechanisms (phytoextraction/phytoaccumulation, phytotransformation, phytostimulation, phytovolatilization, phytorhizodegration, and phytostabilization) were studied. The current study pointed out that the efficiency of phytoremediation can be affected by various factors such as treatment time, temperature, pH, EC, OM, plant density, electric field, and chelating agents. In the end, this review systematically summarized existing knowledge, merits/demerits, prospects, and future aspects of the phytoremediation for remediating polluted soil and water bodies.

AB  - Annual crops and pastures in monoculture frequently have negative effects on ecosystem services due to soil and biodiversity losses. Silvopastoral systems (SSP) have been proposed as an alternative for livestock production systems; however, there are few studies that demonstrate their benefits on soil health. For that reason, this study was established to evaluate the effect of different land uses on soil health measured through chemical indicators. For this purpose, the following land uses managed for at least 19 years were evaluated: (i) intensive maize (Zea mays) production, (ii) a guinea (Megathyrsus maximus) and angleton (Dichantium aristatum) mixed pasture, (iii) SSP with grasses and shrubs of totumo (Cresentia cujete) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), (iv) a multistrata SSP with the same grasses and shrubs plus tree fodder species: (Cassia grandis, Albizia saman and Guazuma ulmifolia); and (v) a secondary forest used as a reference. The evaluations were made in contrasting seasons (dry and rainy), in soils of the Middle Sinú river valley (Colombia), with a drainage gradient. In general, the soils of the SPS presented the highest values for MOS, total N, Mg, B, N-NO3 and CICE, the grass alone pasture presented the highest values in micronutrients: Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn and S and NH4, and lower values for pH, P and NOx, and the highest for Al; whereas, intermediate values for all chemical indicators were obtained in the secondary forest. In contrast, soils cultivated with corn presented the poorest chemical indicators. It is concluded that SSP improve the chemical indicators of soil health as compared to the grass alone pasture and corn monoculture. © 2023,Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales una revista de acceso abierto publicada por el Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT), en asociación con el Instituto de Recursos Genéticos de Cultivos Tropicales de la Academia China de Ciencias Agrícolas Tropicales (TCGRI-CATAS).

AB  - Forage availability is a problem in developing sustainable livestock farming for ruminants in Indonesia. The availability of forage is influenced by several factors, one of which is the availability of land for fodder crop cultivation. The study aimed to test the physicochemistry of Leucaena leucocephala pellets using various types of adhesives originating from local raw materials in the form of tapioca flour, corn flour, sago flour, and commercial adhesives which were carried out for 1 month, namely August 2022 at the Animal Feed Analysis Unit Laboratory, Unit Laboratory Feed Manufacturing, and Transportation Engineering System Laboratory, Halu Oleo University. The results of the study showed that the use of various types of adhesives on the physical and chemical qualities of Leucaena leucocephala forage pellets had a significant effect on the value of pellet durability index, specific gravity, crude protein, dry matter, and organic matter. In contrast, the density value did not show a significant effect. The best results were found using a 3% sago flour adhesive with a Pellet durability index value of 86.71% and a specific gravity of 1.27 g/ml. The adhesive that can improve the chemical quality of Leucaena leucocephala pellets uses 3% corn flour adhesive, which produces a crude protein content of 24.92%. The highest dry material and organic ingredients values are obtained using 3% Tapioca flour adhesive with values of 95.73% and 88.04%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Physicochemical Properties of Combustion Ashes of Some Trees (Urban Pruning) Present in the Neotropical Region

AB  - Secondary lignocellulosic biomass has proved to be useful as an energy source through its oxidation by means of combustion processes. In accordance with the above, in this paper, we wanted to study the ash from urban pruning residues that are generated in cities in the Neotropics. Species such as Licania tomentosa, Azadirachta indica, Ficus benjamina, Terminalia catappa, Leucaena leucocephala, Prosopis juliflora and Pithecellobium dulce were selected because they have been previously studied and showed potential for thermal energy generation. These materials were calcined in an oxidizing atmosphere and characterized by X-ray diffraction and fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy with microchemistry, BET surface area, thermal gravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. The pH and apparent density were also established. The results show high basicity materials (average pH 10), a behavior associated with the presence of chemical elements such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, chlorine, phosphorus, and sulfur. Structurally, these materials have a very significant amorphous fraction (between 49% and 74.5%), the dominant crystalline phases are calcite, arcanite, sylvite, and hydroxyapatite. These ashes have low surface area and do not exceed 13 m2/g. Two characteristic morphological aspects were observed in these ashes: a morphology of rounded grains where silicon content is highlighted, and lamellar morphologies where the presence of chlorine is highlighted. Thermally, these ashes show four significant mass loss events (400°C, 430°C, 680°C, and 920°C), causing mass losses that vary between 25% and 40%. Through this study, it was possible to establish that, from a chemical point of view, these ashes are less dangerous in comparison with those of a mineral coal that was used as a reference. However, they require additional treatments for their disposal due to their high basicity. Because of their composition, these ashes have the potential to be used in the ceramic and cement industries, and in the manufacture of fertilizers. © 2023, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Recent advances in use of 4- coumarate coenzyme a ligase (4CL) as target gene for improving delignification of paper pulp in Leucaena leucocephala in Indian perspective: A review & case study
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152362626&doi=10.1016%2fj.matpr.2023.03.570&partnerID=40&md5=5d7a4f8af5bb738ddf0b8256838c26d7
AB  - Lignin provides support to plants by filling the gaps in cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin components but it is an undesired ingredient of pulp as it imparts black to brown colour to the pulp during paper making process. To remove lignin a lot of chemicals and bleaching agents are used which contribute to major fraction of environmental pollution as well as cost determination of paper making process. In India majorly Leucaena leucocephala is employed for obtaining pulp raw material owing to its properties suited for paper production such as vessel percentage, felting power, runkel ratio, tensile strength etc which is better than other commonly employed sources for paper pulp as raw material. In this review paper we focused on recent advances in the use of 4CL enzyme as target gene towards achieving model designer Leucaena leucocephala trees which can be a possible solution to this problem significantly minimizing the environmental pollution and cost of production. It is known from previous studies that better S/G lignin monomer ratio favours easy extractability of lignin from pulp. Different isoforms with different substrate specificities are known in different plants and knowledge of this differential substrate specificity in conjunction with regulation of expression of these isoforms can help in attaining desired S/G lignin monomer ratio. Thus, these model designer plants would be capable of naturally producing easily amenable lignin towards delignification by altering the S/G lignin ratio and can significantly cut the environmental pollution and cost determining factors for paper production. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Plantation tree species have an immense potential for significantly reducing the atmospheric carbon dioxide and hence regulating climate change. The present study assessed the role of tree species to store carbon and soil enrichment in the eastern plateau and hill region of India. The species investigated were Leucaena leucophala, Gmelina arborea, Cassia siamea, and Eucalyptus tereticornis. The plantation of trees was found to have higher levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) (0.53–0.62%), nitrogen (239.12–253.01 kg ha−1), phosphorus (37.02–38.79 kg ha−1), and potassium (175.47–237.22 kg ha−1) over the non-forested land (control) but was lower in the levels of pH (5.28–5.95) and bulk density (1.32–1.52 g cm−3). However, as soil depth increased, the nutritional status of both plantation and non-forested land soil decreased. The per cent SOC was the highest in surface layers, while the bulk density was the highest in sub-surface layers under different forest plantations. The maximum SOC (0.62%) and bulk density (1.52 g cm−3) were present in Gmelina arborea and Eucalyptus tereticornis plantation, respectively. Among the studied tree species, the soil carbon density and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) were found to be maximum (13.56 t ha−1 and 1.28 t ha−1 year−1) in Gmelina arborea followed by Eucalyptus tereticornis, Cassia siamea, and Leucaena leucocephala, respectively, depicting that these tree species have a stronger capacity to sequester and store carbon, making them suitable as atmospheric carbon reducers. The study also demonstrated that forest plantation enhanced the SOC, nutrient stock, and other crucial soil fertility indicators compared to non-forested site. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

The treatment ration consisted of elephant grass, lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala), coconut meal, tofu waste, bran, cassava waste, and mineral mix arranged based on the PES index of each feed ingredient. The research was conducted in vitro using a completely randomized design (CRD). The treatment consisted of 4 PES indexes, namely 0.55 (R1); 0.6 (R2); 0.65 (R3); 0.7 (R4), and each had 5 replications. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and orthogonal polynomials (OP). The results of the ANOVA showed that the PES index did not affect the production of acetate (C2) and butyrate (C4) but had a highly significant effect on dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), pH, a total of volatile fatty acids (VFA), propionate (C3), C2:C3 ratio, methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and microbial protein synthesis (MPS). The analysis of OP showed a quadratic effect on all variables with the equation Y=-81.601X2+375.04X–310.78 (DMD), Y=-433.69X2+522.69X–128.75 (OMD), Y=-44X2+54.04X– .9 (pH), Y=-2160X2+2576.8X–604.2 (VFA Total), Y=-481.8X2+585.01X–143.45 (C3), Y = 50.93X2–60.177X+21.067 (C2:C3), Y = 202.45X2–223.18X+103.41 (CH4), Y= 436X2 – 552.28X+181.08 (NH3), dan Y=-1012X2+1260X–311.64 (MPS). Protein-energy synchronization (PES) index of 0.6 achieved the best rumen fermentability. The formulation of the PES index-based ration of 0.6 had the most effective compared to other indexes based on the high of propionate, the lowest methane, the lowest NH3, and the best microbial protein synthesis. The ration with an index of 0.6 is composed of 30% elephant grass, 30% Leucaena leucocephala, 10% coconut meal, 10% tofu waste, 10% rice brand, 9% cassava waste, and 1% mineral mix. © 2023, Indonesian Center for Animal Research and Development.

AB  - In the arboretum of Universidad Nacional de Colombia sede Medellín, Cassia fistula (Golden Shower Tree) and Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) exhibited early defoliation. Erysiphe quercicola and Telimena canafistulae, associated with powdery mildew and tar spot, respectively, on C. fistula, were identified using morphological and molecular techniques, both representing new records of fungi for Colombia. Similarly, Phyllactinia leucaenae was proposed as a new combination for Ovulariopsis leucaenae and was associated with powdery mildew on L. leucocephala, which to the best of our knowledge is another new record for Colombia. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Catalysts are used to improve the properties of the bio-oil produced through biomass pyrolysis. In this study, natural minerals, such as natural zeolite and dolomite, were used for the catalytic upgrading of the pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala. Pyrolysis was performed using an in-house designed fluidized bed system wherein the catalyst beds can be placed in two locations. Dolomite and zeolite catalyst beds were placed in the primary fluidized bed and/or secondary hot filter reactors. Four catalyst configurations were utilized in this study. The effects of the type and location of the catalyst on the catalytic activity and product selectivity were investigated. The highest light bio-oil fraction was obtained using the dolomite catalyst situated at the primary and secondary reactors. On the other hand, the configuration in which the natural zeolite catalyst was placed in the two reactors produced heavy bio-oil that was mainly composed of hydrocarbons. The viscosity, flash point, and fly point of the bio-oil produced in this work fall within the standard values for fuel oils. In particular, the viscosity of the bio-oil produced using the catalysts was lower by 60% of that of the product obtained through noncatalytic biomass pyrolysis. The pyrolysis system employed in this study is a promising technology for catalytic biomass pyrolysis processes. © 2022 Energy Institute

TI  - The diversity and quality of forages and their potency as herbal anthelmintic for swamp buffalo in Brebes District, Central Java
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168452496&doi=10.14202%2fvetworld.2023.1496-1504&partnerID=40&md5=dd7b477b3f84bcc0e93bf1c9e653b1b6
AB  - Background and Aim: Swamp buffaloes play an important role in the rural economy of Indonesia. They consume various forages during their grazing time, including those with anti-parasitic potential. However, the information about the type and quality of forages and their potential as a natural anthelmintic for swamp buffalo is very limited. This study aimed to identify the diversity, quality, and anthelmintic potency of forages consumed by swamp buffaloes reared in Bantarkawung Subdistrict, Brebes District, Central Java Province, Indonesia. Materials and Methods: Samples of forages were obtained during three observation periods of the study, with a 12-week interval between each period. Forage diversity was evaluated by identifying its consumption by swamp buffaloes during their grazing activity in the field and feeding time in their shed. The quality of forages was analyzed using proximate analysis to measure their dry matter (DM), crude fiber (CF), crude protein (CP), crude fat (CFat), and ash contents. This is followed by the calculation of their total digestible nutrient based on the proximate analysis results. Botanical composition analysis was then conducted to measure the predominance of forages consumed by the livestock during their grazing activity. Literature reviews were carried out to explore forage's anthelmintic activity. Results: The results showed that swamp buffaloes consume nine species of forage in the shed and 47 in the grazing area, including nine legumes, 18 grass, and 20 others. Swamp buffaloes consumed forages of lower quality, which contained high CF contents and varying levels of other nutrients below their daily nutritional needs. The grazing activity allowed swamp buffaloes to consume a higher variety of forages with better nutritional quality, thereby enabling them to meet their nutritional needs. Legumes and other forages served as the major protein sources, providing CP of 20.03% DM and 11.53% DM, and CF levels of 17.01% DM and 20.35% DM, respectively. The results also showed that the consumption of these forages increased during the rainy season. The predominant species of legumes consumed were Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia spp., while Alternanthera sessilis and Merremia umbellata were the predominant species of other forages. A total of 13 of the 47 species could potentially be used as natural anthelmintic due to their secondary metabolites, namely, tannin, flavonoid, saponin, terpenoid, diterpenoid, and mimosine. These compounds exert anthelmintic effects by inhibiting egg-hatching and larval development, as well as damaging the surface structure of both larvae and adult worms, ultimately leading to the death of the parasites. Conclusion: Overall, swamp buffaloes consumed more variety of forages during grazing compared to when they were kept in sheds. While the low-variety and low-quality forages provisioned for swamp buffaloes in their shed resulted in a low nutrient intake below their daily requirement. Furthermore, daily grazing activities allowed swamp buffaloes to fulfill and supplement their need by consuming a variety of grasses, legumes, and other forages in their respective grazing areas. Some of these forages also have the potential to become natural anthelmintic because they contain secondary metabolites, such as tannins, flavonoids, saponins, terpenoids, diterpenoids, and mimosine. © 2023 Veterinary World.

AB  - This paper describes the outcomes of a five-year (2011-2016) partnership project between the Indonesian Government and the Australian Centre for international Agricultural Research. The objective was to promote the use of Leucaena leucocephala for fattening cattle in the Provinces of West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) and East Nusa Tenggara (NTT). Detailed biophysical and socio-economic measurements demonstrated that it was possible to double productivity of smallholder cattle by improving their nutrition based on feeding leucaena, thus improving the livelihoods of farming families. The results highlighted an opportunity to similarly enhance productivity of other smallholder cattle enterprises in Indonesia and in other tropical developing countries.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Aims: This study focused on new fish feed additives that could supply a nutritional value and inhibit or eliminate mycotoxins. Four novel feed additives, including Albizia lebbeck (L.), Leucaena leucocephala leaf extracts, Serendipita indica and Bacillus megaterium were applied to contaminated fish feed; besides investigating the toxicity of these new fish feed additives.Methodology and results: Our data exhibited that the different tested feed additives were not toxic for brine shrimp larvae or fish. Albizia lebbeck extract at a concentration 0.5% was highly effective in detoxifying mycotoxins with efficacy ratios of 88.01%, 93.89% and 92.89% for aflaB1, aflaG1 and CPA, respectively and L. leucocephala at 0.5% had efficacy ratios of 93.52% and 100% for aflaG1 and CPA, respectively. The addition of S. indica with a concentration of 0.75% was highly effective for the usage of good feed approximately free of mycotoxins, with efficacy ratios of 85.65%, 90.81% and 100% for aflaB1, aflaG1 and CPA, respectively. Moreover, B. megaterium, with a concentration of 0.75% was recommended for detoxification.Conclusion, significance and impact of study: Studied new feed additives as feed additives in fish diets to eliminate mycotoxin with the potential of providing antioxidant activity. Results suggest that mycotoxins degradation can happen in vitro and in vivo by applying new fish feed additives in the fish diet. © (2023), (Universiti Sains Malaysia). All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Alley Cropping System in Degraded Land of Central India: Evaluation of Crop Performance, Economic Benefit and Soil Nutrients Availability
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143746102&doi=10.1007%2fs42106-022-00228-x&partnerID=40&md5=32e5eaa615e6191baef006fabe49e3d6
AB  - Hedgerow or alley cropping is being advocated for sustainable land productivity and improved soil health in the developing world. The suitable food-fodder species grown on bed and furrow system with soil moisture conservation practices need to be adopted for the success of alley cropping under rainfed semi-arid region. A field experiment was conducted during 2013–2016 to assess different food-fodder based alley cropping systems with resource conservation practices (RCP) for enhancing productivity, economic returns and energetics. The perennial Pennisetum tri-specific hybrid (TSH) grass and legume shrubs were planted on a raised bed of 1.5 m wide. One row of shrub was planted in the middle of the bed along with two rows of TSH grass on both side of the shrub row. The seasonal crops were grown in furrow (2.2 m) placed between two beds (1.5 m). In RCP, one supplement irrigation treatments to crops were given i.e. one pre-sowing irrigation (rabi) + other irrigation as per theoretical calculation i.e. 30% of total rainfall—ET losses. In-situ moisture conservation practices include residue retention (stubble height 15 cm + mulching (green weed biomass + litterfall) in furrows. The result indicates that among woody perennials, Sesbania sesban as a hedgerow was superior to Desmanthus virgatus but found at par with Leucaena leucocephala in terms of DM production. Furthermore, TSH grass grown on the side of woody legumes produced about 15–20 Mg DM ha−1 across the treatment per year. The grain yield of the annual crops was in the order of barley > chickpea > pigeonpea across the years and not significantly influenced by perennial components. The highest system productivity (112.2 Mg ha−1) was found under TSH + S. sesban + (sorghum + cowpea–barley) cropping systems leading to higher net monetary returns (US$ 1430 ha−1). While alley cropping with sorghum + pigeonpea was the lowest yielder. Among resource conservation practices, one supplement irrigation and in-situ soil moisture conservation treatments were comparable and produced about 12–14% higher yield than control. The TSH + S. sesban + (sorghum + cowpea–barley) cropping system accumulated highest bio-energy (497 GJ ha−1) but maximum value of energy use efficiency was computed in TSH + Sesbania + (sorghum + pigeonpea). The soil organic carbon was enhanced substantially under 4 years of hedgerow systems over antecedent level. Findings of this study suggest that TSH + S. sesban hedgerow system grown in bed with seasonal crops (sorghum + cowpea–chickpea) in furrow could improve food and fodder production, ensure green fodder availability during dry season and sustain natural resources in rainfed semi-arid agro-ecologies. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The material associated with tree pruning in a city in the Colombian neotropics was characterized in order to determine its energy potential. The species studied for their relevance in the territory were Prosopis juliflora, Lica-nia tomentosa, Terminalia catappa, Azadirachta indica, Pithecellobium dulce, Ficus benjamina and Leucaena leu-cocephala. Moisture content, bulk density, hygroscopic response, elemental chemical analysis, proximal analysis, calorific value, ease of ignition and combustion, thermogravimetric and heat flow analysis, steam generation capa-city, and qualitative analysis of gases (mass spectrometry) were determined. The results that were obtained show high initial moisture contents that vary between 37% and 67% and a variable density (when dry) between 0.21 and 0.41 g/cm3. Chemically, it was shown that all residues have lower carbon and sulfur content compared to a refer-ence mineral coal. However, the residues of some species have higher nitrogen contents compared to the same coal. All biomasses are characterized by their high content of volatile fractions and by having a lower content of inorganic matter compared to carbon. The lower calorific values of these residues are between 14170 and 16928 kJ/kg, which are not negligible compared to other biomasses. This characteristic would be related to the high presence of hemicellulose in the residues. Flue gas monitoring revealed that there are different airflow needs in order to ensure complete combustion. Steam generation tests showed that the calorific value should not be the most relevant criterion to establish the potential use of the waste, since leucaena leucocephala, despite having the highest calorific value, was the material with the lowest performance in steam generation. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

TI  - Evaluation of the productivity and feed value of Wondergraze and Redlands leucaena cultivars under grazing
PY  - 2023
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207110202&doi=10.1071%2fAN22341&partnerID=40&md5=736a2fd1782b126838d169044cc2afcd
AB  - Context: Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a leguminous shrub used for beef grazing in low-rainfall regions (<600-700 mm). Newer cultivars have the potential to extend adoption of the species to higher rainfall (>600-700 mm), frost-free areas of Australia. Aim: We compared productivity, nutritional value and animal performance of two leucaena cultivars, new psyllid-resistant Redlands and the 2010-released Wondergraze, under continuous grazing management in a higher rainfall environment. Methods: Growing steers were allocated to replicated established stands of Wondergraze or Redlands with inter-row mixed grass-legume pasture from January to July 2021. Pasture and leucaena were characterised for biomass and nutritive characteristics. Botanical composition was measured. Liveweight gain, rumen fermentation, and leucaena mimosine breakdown products were measured in grazing steers. Key results: At the beginning of the study, leucaena edible biomass was similar for both cultivars (P > 0.05), but at subsequent samplings, biomass of Redlands was lower than of Wondergraze (P < 0.01). Biomass of both cultivars declined rapidly over the grazing period. Pasture biomass increased between February and July and was significantly higher in Wondergraze paddocks (P < 0.05). Animal performance was not significantly different between cultivar treatments, averaging 0.8 kg/day, but declined over time. Patterns of mimosine conversion to DHP isomers and their conjugation were similar for the two cultivars, suggesting that effectiveness of detoxification did not differ between them. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that leucaena can sustain high levels of animal performance when included in tropical grass pastures in a higher rainfall environment if present in a sufficient quantity (>2 t leucaena edible dry matter/ha established leucaena). Implications: Grazing leucaena-grass pastures is an effective means of increasing animal productivity in parts of subtropical Australia. However, managing grass and/or leucaena growth to match animal requirements can be challenging. © 2023 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - The present world faces critical issues such as global warming, sea-level rise, and drastic change in the climate pattern due to the emission of greenhouse gases. Large-scale use and disposal of hazardous plastics contribute significantly to the present scenario and it becomes essential to use naturally derived materials for making plastics. Natural fibers were found to possess the inherent characteristics required for reinforcing the polymer. In this work, one such novel cellulosic fiber derived from the bast of Leucaena leucocephala was identified and characterized using tests such as chemical, tensile, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric, Differential scanning calorimetry, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Field emission scanning electron microscopy. The presence of high cellulose (59.03 wt.%) with high crystallinity index (63.10%) contributes to high tensile strength(415–693 MPa) and high tensile modulus (9.90–13.10 GPa) of the Leucaena leucocephala fiber (LLF). From thermogravimetric analysis, LLF was observed to be thermally stable up to 188.20°C and activation energy of 64.22 kJ/mol. The morphological analysis of LLF revealed the existence of honeycombed porous surface characterized with serrations, and this facilitates better bonding characteristics with polymer. Lower density, mechanical properties, and better thermal stability make LLF a suitable alternate for synthetic fibers while making composites. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Simulation models represent a low-cost approach to evaluating agricultural systems. In the current study, the precision and accuracy of the RUMINANT model to predict dry matter intake (DMI) and methane emissions from beef cattle fed tropical diets (characteristic of Colombia) was assessed. Feed intake (DMI) and methane emissions were measured in Brahman steers housed in polytunnels and fed six forage diets. In addition, DMI and methane emissions were predicted by the RUMINANT model. The model’s predictive capability was measured on the basis of precision: coefficients of variation (CV%) and determination (R2, percentage of variance accounted for by the model), and model efficiency (ME) and accuracy: the simulated/observed ratio (S/O ratio) and slope and mean bias (MB%). In addition, combined measurements of accuracy and precision were carried out by means of mean square prediction error (MSPE) and correlation correspondence coefficient (CCC) and their components. The predictive capability of the RUMINANT model to simulate DMI resulted as valuable for mean S/O ratio (1.07), MB% (2.23%), CV% (17%), R2 (0.886), ME (0.809), CCC (0.869). However, for methane emission simulations, the model substantially underestimated methane emissions (mean S/O ratio = 0.697, MB% = −30.5%), and ME and CCC were −0.431 and 0.485, respectively. In addition, a subset of data corresponding to diets with Leucaena was not observed to have a linear relationship between the observed and simulated values. It is suggested that this may be related to anti-methanogenic factors characteristic of Leucaena, which were not accounted for by the model. This study contributes to improving national inventories of greenhouse gases from the livestock of tropical countries. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Effects of inclusion of fodder tree leaves mix meal in rearing media on the body size, protein and lipid content of larvae of black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens)

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a fermented substrate containing various proportions of fodder tree leaf mix meal at 0% (LM0), 10% (LM1), 20% (LM2), 30% (LM3) and 40% (LM4) on the body dimensions and nutrient content of black soldier fly (BSF) larvae (maggots). The fodder tree were Leucaena leucocephala and Moringa oleifera in a fixed ratio of 1:1. Completely randomized design was deployed to test those five levels of the legume mix meal. Each experimental unit consisted of 2 kgs of substrate, which was placed randomly in an open-air hut for oviposition by wild BSF. Maggots were harvested 10th days after substrate placement. Variables measured were maggot’s fresh and dry weight, length, crude protein, and lipid content. Analysis of variance was used in analysis of the data. Results showed that levels of fodder tree leaf meal improved maggots protein and lipid content at a quadratic fashion. However, larval weight (0.13-0.18 g), length (15.7-18.2 mm), and DM content (41.0-45.7%) were not effected. It can be concluded that the levels of leucaena-moringa leaf meal in the growth substrate can increase the protein and lipid content of black soldier fly maggots but not the larva’s weight and length. © 2023 Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - The air pollution tolerance index (APTI) is one of the modern tools for assessing the impacts of air pollutants on plant physiology. The value of APTI is different for different plant species. Plants with higher values of APTI are tolerant and act as a sink due to their bioaccumulation ability for air pollutants. Hence, they can be planted to establish green belts in areas with severe air pollution, especially in industrial zones. The present investigation was carried out to assess the APTI values of top twenty urban tree species of the Bikaner city of North-Western Rajasthan. The leaf samples were taken from selected roadside trees distributed in the residential, commercial and industrial zones of the city. On the basis of APTI values, it was observed that Leucaena leucocephala (23.41), Eucalyptus camaldulensis (21.87) and Cassia siamea (21.39) had an APTI value above 20 and they are therefore classified as tolerant species. Similarly, Pongamia pinnata (9.48) showed APTI under 10, therefore it falls into the sensitive category. 80 % of the total species in the studied area are categorized as a moderately sensitive category. There were no plant species in very sensitive (APTI < 1) and very tolerant (APTI > 30) category. © 2023, Association for Promotion of Holistic Approach to Environment. All rights reserved.

TI  - EFFECTS OF FODDER TREE LEAVE SUPPLEMENTATION FOR BASAL RICE STRAW DIET ON RUMEN AMMONIA, pH, AND DEGRADATION CHARACTERISTICS IN SHEEP
PY  - 2023

AB  - Fodder tree leaves (FTLs) contain high levels of protein, vitamins, and minerals that play a major role in enhancing roughage intake by ruminants, thus improving low-quality roughage utilization. The study sought to measure the rumen degradation characteristics, pH, and ammonia N concentration of sheep fed rice straw (RS) and supplemented with FTLs. Four forest-type rumen-fistulated rams of an average weight of 19.0±1.2 kg were randomly assigned to one of four treatments in a 4 × 4 Latin Square design. Treatment diets consisted of urea-ammoniated straw (UAS; control), RS+100% Leucaena leucocephala (L), RS+100% Samanea saman (S), and RS+50% L+50% S (LS). Data obtained were subjected to the Glimmix procedure of SAS (2016) and significant means were separated using Tukey’s test at (P<0.05). Treatments differed significantly (P<0.001) in the quantity of readily soluble materials (a), rate of degradation (c), and a potentially degradable fraction (P) with LS recording the highest a, c, and P among the treatments. Ruminal pH and ammonia concentrations differed significantly (P<0.0001) among the treatments. Overall mean rumen pH values obtained ranged from 6.44 in UAS to 6.72 in the S-supplemented diet whereas mean rumen ammonia values ranged from 4.59 mg/100 ml in sheep fed UAS diet to 9.15 mg/L in sheep fed L diet. The pH values obtained imply that the experimental diets could improve rumen fermentation and, hence, serve as good sources of feed for ruminants. The rumen DM degradation values indicated that sufficient amounts of DM would be degraded over a period of time, thus releasing substantial quantities into the small intestines for digestion to provide essential nutrients needed for better animal performance. The rumen ammonia values obtained were higher than the minimum values recommended for optimal microbial activity for animals fed lignocellulosic materials. This indicated that such FTLs could be utilized for moderate animal performance, especially during the dry seasons when natural pastures are qualitatively and quantitatively poor. © (2023), (Scienceline Publication).

AB  - The effect of green organic mulches (Sesbania aculeata and Leucaena leucocephala) and nitrogen (N) levels on growth, yield, quality and nutrient uptake of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar “Pusa Basmati 1509” was investigated in aerobic rice (AR) and transplanted rice (TPR). The levels of N were control (N0), 75% recommended dose of N (RDN); and 100% RDN) applied through Chemical fertilizer and Azotobacter chroococcum a liquid biofertilizer. A Field experiment was conducted in split plot design with four main-plot and 5 sub-plot treatments. The main plot consisted of bare soil, Sesbania mulch (10 Mg ha−1, fresh weight-FW), Leucaena mulch (10 Mg ha−1 FW), and TPR; and sub-plot consisted N0; 75% RDN, 100% RDN; 75% RDN+Azotobacter, and 100% RDN+Azotobacter. The highest grain, straw and biological yields (3.84, 6.74 and 11.6 Mg ha−1, respectively) and nutrient uptake were recorded with TPR followed by AR with Leucaena and Sesbania mulch. Grain, straw and biological yield of TPR over bare soil were increased by 31.9, 26.6 and 28.3%, respectively. Uptake of Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu by rice under TPR were 52, 33, 36 and 33% higher, respectively than AR under bare soil. The highest grain, straw, and biological yields (3.86, 7.79 and 11.7 Mg ha−1, respectively) of AR were obtained in 100% RDN + Azotobacter compared to the rest of the treatments. Therefore, the cultivation of AR with Leucaena/Sesbania mulch along with 100% RDN and Azotobacter biofertilizer can be most productive in the study area. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A baseline survey was carried out to determine the iodine status of goats and its relationship with the levels of soil, water, and fodder samples collected from different agro-climatic zones (sub-tropical, lower, and upper-intermediate) of the Jammu division. A total of 74 blood and 60 milk samples from goats, as well as soil (50), water (50), and fodder (56) samples, were collected. Plasma inorganic iodine (PII), milk inorganic iodine (MII), iodide ion (I-), and thyroid hormone (T3and T4) levels were measured along with biochemical parameters. The average PII, I-, and MII concentrations of goats from unorganized farms were 55.99±4.56 ng/ml, 1.37±0.11 ppm, and 47.3±5.68 ng/ml compared 74.68±8.40 ng/ml, 1.43±0.11 ppm and 62.01±8.55 ng/ml, respectively from the organized farm. Based on PII level, 71.62% of goats had moderate deficiency (level 50-100 ng/ml) and 28.37% had severe deficiency (level <50 ng/ml). The average levels of iodine in soil and water were 0.24 ppm and 0.06 ppm, respectively. Rabi and kharif fodders showed average iodine levels of 1.25 ppm and 0.37 ppm, respectively. Significant changes were recorded in glucose, HDL and T4levels. Pearson correlation performed between PII (ng/ml) and biochemical parameters established correlation with T4(r = -0.465), glucose (r = 0.510), HDL (r = -0.355) and cholesterol (r = 0.271). The study concluded that iodine deficiency is prevalent in the goat population due to lower levels in the environment implying an urgent need for regular supplementation in the diet. © 2023 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

TI  - Emission factors of PM2.5-Bounded selected metals, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and water-soluble ionic species emitted from combustions of biomass materials for source Apportionment—A new database for 17 plant species
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130977835&doi=10.1016%2fj.apr.2022.101453&partnerID=40&md5=6778a830ab85b34ead0bd255da17f57e
AB  - Over the past few years, burning agricultural or crop residues has resulted in serious air pollution, particularly in northern Thailand. In this study, constant endeavours were made to achieve the first-hand emission factors (EFs) of water-soluble ionic species (WSIS), organic carbon, elemental carbon, and selected metals emitted from the combustion of 17 plant species. The average EF values of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) ranged from 280 g kg−1 to 1441 g kg−1 and from 32 g kg−1 to 142 g kg−1, respectively. Sugarcane burning shows the highest EFs of toxic metals, such as V, Cr, Co, Ni, and Pb, which is concerning because Thailand is the world's second largest sugar exporter. The comparatively high percentage contribution of Cl− coupled with extremely low levels of K+ resulted in questions on its reliability as a chemical tracer for maritime aerosols and biomass burning particles, respectively. OC/EC ratios varied from 4.68 (Leucaena leucocephala) to 11.4 (Terminalia catappa) with the average value of 8.88 ± 1.72. Further attempts to investigate the most suitable diagnostic binary ratios of metals representing biomass burning were conducted using 2D plots of Zn/Mn, Fe/Zn, Fe/Cu, Ni/Co, Mn/Cr, Ni/V, Al/Si, and Pb/As. In this study, Mn/Cr versus Ni/V and Pb/As versus Al/Si can be used as diagnostic binary ratios to classify biomass-burning-related aerosols. © 2022 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control

AB  - Helminth infections continue to be a neglected global threat in tropical regions, and there have been growing cases of anthelmintic resistance reported towards the existing anthelmintic drugs. Thus, the search for a novel anthelmintic agent has been increasing, especially those derived from plants. Leucaena leucocephala (LL) is a leguminous plant that is known to have several pharmacological activities, including anthelmintic activity. It is widely known to contain a toxic compound called mimosine, which we believed could be a potential lead candidate that could exert a potent anthelmintic effect. Hence, this study aimed to validate the presence of mimosine in LL extract and to investigate the anthelmintic effect of LL extract and mimosine on head thrashing, egg-laying, and pharyngeal pumping activities using the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Mimosine content in LL extract was confirmed through an HPLC analysis of spiking LL extract with different mimosine concentrations, whereby an increasing trend in peak heights was observed at a retention time of 0.9 min. LL extract and mimosine caused a significant dose-dependent increase in the percentage of worm mortality, which produced LC50s of 73 mg/mL and 6.39 mg/mL, respectively. Exposure of C. elegans to different concentrations of LL extract and mimosine significantly decreased the head thrashing, egg-laying, and mean pump amplitude of pharyngeal pumping activity. We speculated that these behavioral changes are due to the inhibitory effect of LL extract and mimosine on an L-type calcium channel called EGL-19. Our findings provide evidential support for the potential of LL extract and its active compound, mimosine, as novel anthelmintic candidates. However, the underlying mechanism of the anthelmintic action has yet to be elucidated. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The adsorption method is widely used in water and wastewater treatment; however, most industrial adsorbents are expensive, limiting the use of the adsorption method in developing countries. Therefore, this study aims at developing a biosorbent from waste Leucaena leucocephala seed pods (LLSP) and apply it (as a cost-effective bio-adsorbent) to remove Janus Green B dye (JGBD) from solutions at different values of pH, agitation time, LLSP dose and JGBD concentration. Different techniques were used to characterize LLSP before and after JGBD removal, including pore size distribution, surface area (SBET) analysis, FTIR, SEM, SPM and the point of zero charges (pHpzc) of the LLSP surface. The results proved that LLSP could remove up to 95% of JGBD at pH, LLSP dose, JGBD concentration and agitation time of 9, 0.08 g/100 ml, 50 mg/l and 30 min, respectively. Langmuir and Freundlich analyses were applied to fit the data for equilibrium biosorption, and it was noticed that the Langmuir isotherm model fits the data, and the full monolayer biosorption ability for JGBD was 142.85 mg/g. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The poor nutritional quality of natural pastures is one of the main constraints smallholder cattle farmers encounter in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Information on the nutritive values of the tree and shrub species most used by farmers is insufficient. This study aimed to assess the chemical composition and in vitro gas production profiles of eight selected trees and shrubs forages from the territories of Kalemie and Kabare in the eastern DRC. The forage samples were analysed for dry matter, ash, crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), and acid detergent lignin (ADL) and, condensed tannins (CT). The metabolisable energy, in vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD) and short-chain fatty acids were also estimated. Data obtained were analysed using a one-way analysis of variance in a completely randomised design. The results revealed that the nutrient parameters analysed and calculated differed significantly (p<0.05) between the various species of trees and shrubs and also between the territories within the same species of tree or shrub. The CP ranged from 217 g kg-1 DM in Mangifera indica to 402 g kg-1 DM in Leucaena leucocephala in Kalemie, while from 270 g kg-1 DM in M. indica to 417 g kg-1 DM in Calliandra calothyrsus for samples obtained from Kabare. The forages had moderate NDF ranging from 265 g kg-1 in C. calothyrsus found from Kabare to 690 g kg-1 DM in Erythrina abyssinica found in Kalemie. The condensed tannin content was highest in C. calothyrsus (122 g kg-1 DM) obtained from Kalemie compared to M. indica (68.3 g kg-1 DM) from Kabare. The potential gas production and in vitro OMD were high and comparable between the species such as L. leucocephala, Vernonia amygdalina and E. abyssinica. From this study, it can be concluded that tree and shrub forages had higher CP content and in vitro digestibility, which suggests their suitability for use as protein supplements in livestock diets, particularly during the dry season. © 2022 Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - Pollen and spores have been identified as major airborne bio-particles inducing respiratory disorders including allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis among hypersensitive individuals. The present study was conducted with a view to investigating monthly depositional rate of atmospheric palynomorphs to determine the influence of the immediate vegetation on airborne pollen distribution; allergenic activities of dominant atmospheric pollen types at selected study locations in Taraba and Bauchi States, Northeastern Nigeria. Bioaerosols were collected using Tauber-like pollen traps and subjected to standard palynological treatment procedures, microscopy and photomicrography. Plant enumeration within the surrounding vegetation revealed that some airborne pollen types were produced by local plants at the study locations. Spores of Nephrolepis sp., Pteris sp. and a trilete fern, as well as diatoms were also recovered. Crude protein contents of some dominant pollen types; Borreria verticillata (L.) G.F.W. Meyer and Panicum maximum Jacq. for Taraba State; Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. and Terminalia catappa L. for Bauchi State, were quantified and extracted to sensitize Mus musculus mice for serology (ELISA) and haematology (differential and total white blood cell counts). Statistical significance was tested and recorded in the correlation between levels of serological and haematological parameters elicited by each test group; differences between levels of these parameters elicited by each test group and those of the control, as well as at varying sensitization periods. In the Leucaena leucocephala test group, swollen body and histopathological morbid features showing more extensive areas of inflammatory cells and alveoli filled with fluid in the lungs, were recorded in two dead M. musculus, respectively. The study revealed that all the tested pollen types are possible allergens at the study locations, establishing a complexity of interaction among allergy mediators at varied periods of mice sensitization and forming a paradigm of human immune response to the different pollen allergens. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Leucaena has been used to make mixed silages to obtain nutritional enrichment of the silages. Thus, the inclusion of Leucaena as an additive in mixed elephant grass silages can reduce fermentation losses, and increase the nutritional value and aerobic stability of the mixed silage without changing the fermentation profile. This study evaluated the fermentation profile, nutritional composition, and aerobic stability of elephant grass silages combined with different levels of Leucaena. A total of five inclusion levels of Leucaena (0, 20, 40, 60, and 80% on a dry matter basis) were added to elephant grass silages. A completely randomized design was adopted, with 5 treatments and 3 repetitions, totaling 15 experimental silos that were opened after 30 days of sealing. Fermentation profile, chemical composition, and aerobic stability were analyzed. A descriptive analysis of temperature and pH peaks during aerobic stability was performed. The increase in the inclusion of Leucaena in the composition of silages reduced gas and effluent losses, neutral and acid detergent fiber, cellulose, lignin, total and fiber carbohydrates, and total digestible nutrients, and resulted in increased dry matter, ether extract, and crude protein. A quadratic effect of treatments was found for the temperature to reach the maximum pH (P=0.009). Aerobic stability remained constant after 40% Leucaena inclusion in the composition of elephant grass silages. The inclusion of Leucaena up to 80% in the composition of elephant grass silages reduces fermentation losses, promotes a nutritional increase, and increases the aerobic stability of the silages. © 2022, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

AB  - Plants are utilized for medicinal, therapeutic, nutritional, and industrial importance. This study investigated the phytochemical constituents and antibacterial activities of two medicinal Vitaceae species, namely: Cayratia trifolia and Tetrastigma harmandii. The growing environment (location, elevation, soil properties, and associated plants) of the species in northeastern Cagayan, Luzon, Philippines, were assessed and leaf samples were collected for phytochemical screening and antibacterial analysis. T. har-mandii dominated the population found growing in various habitats such as hills, res-idential areas, near coastal areas and island shorelines, nipa plantations, agricultural and grasslands, near bodies of water, caves, and secondary growth forests while C. trifolia were only found growing in swamps, hills, and secondary growth forests. Both plants were found climbing in plant species like ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala) and kakawate (Gliciridia sepium). T. harmandii populations were growing in soils with lower soil pH and higher nutrient content as compared to C. trifolia populations which grew in soils with higher pH and lower nutrients. Antioxidant properties were exhib-ited by the presence of secondary metabolites. Alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, terpe-noids, anthocyanins, tannins, and saponins were detected in C. trifolia ethanolic leaf extracts while phenols, terpenoids, tannins, and saponins were detected in T. har-mandii. Both species showed inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, a slight activity against Klebsiella aerogenes was observed for T. harmandii. Thus, C. trifolia and T. harmandii also have antibacterial properties. © 2022, Brawijaya University. All rights reserved.

TI  - Increasing the proportion of Leucaena leucocephala in hay-fed beef steers reduces methane yield
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126047758&doi=10.1071%2fAN21576&partnerID=40&md5=67fea404f873313066ef33ea2e181375
AB  - Context: Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a leguminous shrub adapted to higher rainfall (>600 mm) in frost-free areas of Australia. It can be a source of high-quality forage for cattle grazing tropical grass-based pastures that are seasonally deficient in the nitrogen content required for adequate levels of performance. Leucaena contains bioactive compounds that may reduce methanogenesis in the rumen, helping to achieve Australia's goal to make red meat production carbon neutral by 2030. Aim: A study was undertaken to evaluate the response in animal performance and methane production to increasing percentages of leucaena in a hay-based diet. Methods: Growing steers were fed diets containing 0%, 18%, 36% and 48% leucaena. Intake, liveweight gain, methane production and yield were measured in a cross-over trial with two modern cultivars of leucaena (Redlands and Wondergraze). Methane was measured in open-circuit respiration chambers. Key results: There were no effects of cultivar on most parameters. Increasing leucaena percentage in the diet increased dry matter intake, animal performance and methane production (g/day) but reduced methane yield (g/kg dry matter intake) according to the equation: methane yield = 19.8-0.09 × leucaena percentage in the diet. The inclusion of polyethylene glycol to nullify potential antimethanogenic activity of tannins restored methane yield by 67%, indicating that tannins were responsible for most of the observed reduction in methane yield. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that leucaena can improve animal performance and reduce methane yield in steers fed low-quality grasses. Implications: Leucaena can be included in diets of grazing cattle in areas agronomically suited to its production, as a means to reduce enteric methane emissions. © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - Water pollution, as a result of industrial development, has detrimental effects on aquatic organisms and human beings. In this research, Leucaena leucocephala biomass was modified using Fenton’s reagent and sodium hydroxide, and the performances of the native, Fenton-treated, and NaOH-activated adsorbents for removal of Ni(II) from aqueous solution were evaluated under various experimental conditions such as initial pH, contact time, initial concentration of Ni(II), adsorbent dosage, and temperature. The adsorbents were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and pH of the point of zero charge. Kinetic and equilibrium adsorption data were well described by Elovich and Liu models, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities are 50.66, 56.72, and 75.17 mg/g for the native, Fenton-treated, and NaOH-activated L. leucocephala adsorbents, respectively. Desorption of Ni(II) from the surface of the adsorbents was done effectively with 0.03 mol/L of hydrochloric acid. Thermodynamic calculations show that the adsorption process was spontaneous, feasible, and favorable because the values of ΔGo were negative. Adsorption of Ni(II) onto the adsorbents was exothermic (ΔHo values were negative) and there was also a decrease in the randomness of the liquid-solid interface (ΔGo values were negative). Overall, the three adsorbents can be used for the treatment of water that is contaminated with Ni(II). © 2022, Iranian Institute of Research and Development in Chemical Industries.

AB  - Fossil coal can be replaced with renewable charcoal to reduce CO2 emissions from ironmaking processes. Charcoals produced from three hardwood species, Acacia nilotica (W1), Albizia lebbeck (W2) and Leucaena leucocephala (W3), were evaluated as a reductant in ironmaking. Charcoals were produced with slow (5 °C/min) and fast heating rates (50 °C/min) at 600, 800 and 1100 °C. Charcoals were characterized using proximate, ultimate analysis, volume shrinkage, compressive loading, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy for their chemical, mechanical and physical properties. It was found that among the selected biomass species, fixed and total carbon content is higher in W1 (83–97; 84–91%) and W2 (83–96; 86–92%) than W3 (76–89; 78–84%) and increases with increase in carbonization temperature and heating rate. Charcoal yield in W1 (22–28%), W2 (22–26%) and W3 (23–28%) decreases with an increase in carbonization temperature and heating rate. Charcoals produced at various carbonization conditions have at most 10% ash content. Values from different tests indicate that W2 and W3 charcoal are potentially better reductant than W1. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Long-term forest monitoring is vital to understand how Hawaiian forests change over time and to manage and conserve natural resources. Forest inventories are assessed about every 10 years in Hawaiʻi by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, in collaboration with state and federal partners. This report summarizes key findings from 246 forested plots in Hawai‘i, inventoried from 2010 to 2015. Estimates were provided for forest area, tree species composition, size distribution, volume, biomass, carbon, understory vegetation, damage to trees, damaging agents, and invasive plant species across all management or owner groups (federal, state and county, and private). Forested FIA plots were located on five of the eight major Hawaiian Islands: Hawai‘i, Maui, Lānaʻi, O‘ahu, and Kaua‘i. An estimated 1.5 million ac of forested lands were present state-wide, containing many high-value resources, such as clean water, wood products, and carbon sequestration, and delivering a range of cultural ecosystem services. Hawai‘i’s forest inventory consisted of an estimated 1.8 billion live trees and 112 distinct tree species, including species that were native (indigenous), introduced (either by early Polynesians or more recently via European and Asian contact with Hawai‘i), and invasive (those that cause economic, environ-mental, or ecological harm). Montane rainforests were the most common forest community type, accounting for 30 percent of Hawai‘i’s forested lands. ʻŌhiʻa lehua (Metrosideros poly-morpha Gaudich.), an endemic, keystone tree species, was the most common and dominant tree species ≥5 inches diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) within Hawai‘i’s forests, followed by hāpuʻu ʻiʻi (Cibotium menziesii Hook.), hāpuʻu pulu (Cibotium glaucum (Sm.) Hook. & Arn.), and koa (Acacia koa A. Gray). Strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum Sabine) was the most abundant tree species ≥1 inch d.b.h., followed by ʻōhiʻa lehua, invasive haole koa (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit), and Christmas berry (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi). Strawberry guava is invasive and degrades Hawai‘i’s native forests, adversely affecting ecosystem composition, structure, function, and ecosystem services. Hawai‘i’s live trees represented 51 million U.S. tons of dry mass (46.3 Tg) carbon. A total of 47 percent of Hawai‘i’s forests were located on reserved land, primarily ceded lands managed by Hawai‘i’s state and county governments. This report also serves as a baseline for assessing the extent and health of ʻōhiʻa prior to the manifestation of rapid ‘ōhi‘a death, a disease that began causing widespread mortality of ʻōhiʻa lehua trees in 2014. This is the first FIA report for Hawai‘i using the nationally standardized plot design developed by FIA, and it provides the baseline for future forest assessments and estimates of change in forest composition, structure, and health. Detailed tables and graphical highlights are included to inform resource managers, policymakers, and the public about the status and trends of their local forest ecosystems and resources. © 2022, USDA Forest Service.

AB  - The purpose of the proximate analysis is to evaluate the fuel characteristics of raw materials. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the proximate properties of the mixture of Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia mangium fuel pellets. The moisture analyser, mx-50 machine was used in the identification of moisture content (MC) in the samples. Meanwhile, volatile matter (VM) was analysed based on BS EN 15148:2009 standard. Ash content (AC) was obtained using BS EN 14775:2009 standard. On the other hand, fix carbon (FC) was obtained through the summation of percentage in all three (3) different values of moisture content, ash content and volatile matter subtracted from 100%. The average percentage of MC of bottom, middle and top portion are 3.85%, 1.93%, 2.99% respectively. Meanwhile, the average percentage of VM of the same portion is 82.88%, 83.85%, 83.22% respectively. The average percentage of AC with the same portion are 0.44%, 0.17%, 0.29% respectively. Last but not least, the average percentage of FC with the same portion are 12.94%, 14.06%, 14.62% respectively. Based on the results of proximate analysis above which are high in VM and FC and low in MC and AC contents, it can be concluded that the mixture of L. leucocephala and A. mangium fuel pellets has a very good potential to be utilised as solid fuel. © 2022 Author(s).

AB  - In this study, the in vitro apparent rumen degradability of organic matter (ARDOM) and plant secondary metabolites (ARDPSM) of three tropical legumes (Mucuna pruriens, Canavalia ensiformis, and Leucaena leucocephala) were assessed. For this, 3 experiments were set up, i.e., single end-point incubations (24 h) with ruminal inoculum from either Belgian or Cuban sheep, as well as kinetic assessments (0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 12 h, and 24 h) inoculum from Belgian sheep. L-mimosine, L-canavanine, Concanavalin A (Con A), and trypsin inhibitor (TI) were the plant secondary metabolites (PSM) targeted in this study. In all three experiments, both beans, as well as forage/bean meals of M. pruriens and C. ensiformis and their PSM, were extensively degraded during 24 h incubation, irrespective of the inoculum source (0.44 to 0.70 and 0.43 to 0.78 g/g of organic matter (OM) for ARDOM, respectively, and > 0.80 g/g for L-canavanine, > 0.76 TIU/TIU for TI, and > 0.95 g/g for Con A, for both legumes). Forage meal of L. leucocephala was considerably less degraded, with apparent ruminal degradabilities of 0.20 g/g OM and 0.35 g/g OM after 24 h incubation with Belgian or Cuban sheep inoculum, respectively. This could – at least partially – be related to L-mimosine, present in L. leucocephala, which was hardly degraded in the Belgian incubation, while a more extensive ruminal breakdown was observed under the Cuban conditions (0.05 g/g PSM vs. 0.78 g/g PSM, respectively). The negative effect of L-mimosine on OM degradability was supported in an additional in vitro experiment with straw and inoculum from Belgian sheep, as ruminal degradation of straw was 31% lower when pure L-mimosine was supplemented. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

TI  - A Synthesis of Magnetic Natural Coagulant and Its Application to Treat Congo Red Synthetic Wastewater

AB  - Natural plant-based coagulant has been extensively studied these days due to its effectiveness and efficiency in wastewater treatment. However, utilization of plant-based coagulant happens to hold certain drawbacks, namely a long settling time and an increase of dissolved organic in the treated water. A combination of magnetic iron nanoparticles and plant-based protein was subsequently proposed as a solution. In this study, magnetic natural coagulant was synthesized via adsorption of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) protein on tannic acid–modified Fe3O4. The obtained magnetic coagulant was furthermore analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to observe the characteristics before and after protein adsorption. The effect of pH (2 to 4) and coagulant dosage (25 to 250 mg L−1) on the removal of Congo red from wastewater and sludge formation was observed. The best condition was found at pH 2 due to the charge neutralization mechanism. Furthermore, the highest removal of 89.10% with a sludge volume of 4 mL L−1 and a settling time of 5 min was obtained at a magnetic coagulant dosage of 100 mg L−1 and pH 2. The removal result was comparable with a crude extract of Leucaena, however with a much faster settling time. Furthermore, coagulation using magnetic natural coagulant resulted in higher removal of dissolved organics in the treated water, compared to crude extract, where the increase of organic contents was detected due to the presence of various soluble organic compounds in the crude extract. The results obtained in this study show a promising application of magnetic natural coagulant for sustainable water–wastewater treatment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - EFFECT OF SUBABUL (LEUCAENA LEUCOCEPHALA) BASED COMPLETE RATIONS ON CARCASS CHARACTERISTICS AND SERUM THYROXINE PROFILE OF KIDS
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130490055&doi=10.5958%2f0973-9718.2022.00037.X&partnerID=40&md5=5b64c2f75a231ee510ce9ec4aef2f468
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of feeding complete rations containing untreated Leucaena leucocepahala leaf meal (ULLLM) (Subabul) and treated (moist heat) L. leucocepahala leaf meal (TLLLM) at 30 and 40 parts on plane of nutrition and nitrogen balance in kids. Mimosine content of LLLM after moist heat treatment for single-treated and double-treated material was 1.91 and 1.17%, respectively. A feeding trial was conducted with 30 non-descript kids (8.42±0.15 kg, 3 to 4 month-old) by allocating to five complete rations as CR1 (control), CR2 (30% ULLLM), CR3 (30% TLLLM), CR4 (40% ULLLM) and CR5 (40% TLLLM). Average daily gain was significantly (p<0.05) higher in CR1 (55.90±2.25 g/d) and CR3 (56.30±0.92 g/d) followed by CR2 (37.90±3.95 g/d) and CR5 (38.70±5.60 g/d) and lowest in CR4 (23.90±3.65 g/d) group. Dressing yield (39.53 to 44.99%) did not indicate significant changes among the groups. The edible, non-edible, organ weights and wholesale cuts did not indicate significant difference among the groups. Serum T (µg/ml) and T (ng/ml) hormone profile showed significant reduction (p<0.05) at 90 days 3 4 in CR2 (1.80±0.10 and 49.43±2.50) and CR4 (1.10±0.10 and 40.11±2.10) as compared to other groups CR1 (3.61±0.70 and 87.14±8.20), CR3 (2.42±0.20 and 83.14±7.20) and CR5 (2.81±0.30 and 78.11±5.10). Histopathological examination of thyroid gland showed hyperplasia of epithelial cells and follicular vacuolation with cuboidal epithelium in CR2 and CR4 groups. However, normal pattern was observed in CR1 and very mild changes in CR3 and CR5 groups. It was concluded that hot water treatment of L. leucocepahala leaf meal is partially effective in ameliorating mimosine toxicity and can be included at 30% level in complete rations of kids. © 2022, Indian Society for Sheep and Goat Production and Utilization.

AB  - The awareness of the environmental impact of CO2 emission from fossil fuels has resulted in the search for alternative renewable energy sources. Biomass-derived from agro-residues and economic trees have been identified as a sustainable fossil fuel alternative. The Leucaena leucocephala tree is abundant and presents diverse beneficial opportunities as a high-energy density tree. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions and constituent nutrients render it valuable for biogas, bio-oil, biodiesel, ethanol, char, activated carbon, etc. production. In this review, an overview of the bioenergetic applications of the Leucaena leucocephala tree was discussed with emphasis on the challenges and potentials of production of biodiesel, bio-oil, ethanol, char, biogas, and activated carbon from the seeds, forages and leaves, bark, wood, and legumes of the Leucaena leucocephala. Also, the biorefinery concept was elucidated for the plausible generation of fine chemicals and fuels. It is hoped that this study will intensify research on the production of biofuels and fine chemicals from agro-industrial crops such as Leucaena leucocephala and its integration into biorefinery. © 2022

AB  - Silvopastoral systems are livestock agroforestry models that have been promoted to improve cattle nutrition, provide ecosystem services, contribute to protect biodiversity and to mitigate climate change. So far, the research on the economic and environmental benefits of silvopastoral systems has not evaluated in detail the impact of these systems on the reduction of soil erosion and edaphic macrofauna. The objective of this study was to estimate the contribution of silvopastoral systems to the reduction of laminar erosion processes, the protection of soil macrofauna and the conservation of soil water dynamics in cattle farms in the Coffee Region and Cesar River Valley in Colombia. Plots were delimited in intensive silvopastoral systems (SSPi) composed of improved pastures + Tithonia diversifolia, and improved pastures + Leucaena leucocephala, and compared with a control in each site corresponding to degraded pastures (PD). Erosion rate was determined in ton/ha/year and soil physical characteristics were evaluated. Additionally, runoff and infiltration were measured using a rainfall simulator, and the diversity and abundance of edaphic macrofauna were evaluated. It was found that SSPi significantly decrease the soil loss rate up to 35.3%, improve infiltration and hydraulic conductivity and considerably improve soil biological dynamics, registering up to 90 morphospecies, with a maximum total number of individuals of 12281, belonging to 16 orders, three taxonomic classes, and six functional groups with a predominance of detritivores and predators. In general, the SSPi showed the best biological conditions, which contributes to the maintenance of hydrological characteristics and to soil conservation. © 2022 Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.

AB  - To address international food security concerns and sustain a growing global population, global agricultural output needs to increase by 70% by the year 2050. Current agricultural techniques to increase crop yields, specifically the application of chemicals, have resulted in a wide range of negative impacts on the environment and human health. The maintenance of good quality soil organic matter, a key concern in tropical countries such as India, requires a steady input of organic residues to maintain soil fertility. A tree with many uses, Leucaena leucocephala, has attracted much attention over the past decades. As per our literature review, no research has been conducted examining Leucaena leucocephala leaves for their fungal decomposition and their use as green manure. A study of the fungal colonization of Leucaena leucocephala leaves at various stages of decomposition was conducted to get an insight into which fungi play a critical role in the decomposition process. In total, fifty-two different species of fungi were isolated. There was an increase in the percentage of fungus occurrences as the leaves senesced and then finally decomposed. Almost all decomposition stages were characterized by a higher percentage occurrence of Deuteromycetes (75.47%) and by a lower rate of Ascomycetes (9.43%). A gradual increase of basidiomycetes such as unidentified sclerotia and Rhizoctonia solani was seen as the leaves senesced and finally decomposed. In the moist chamber, Didymium nigripes was the only Myxomycete isolated from completely decomposed leaves. In the present study, on average, there were more fungi in wet seasons than in the dry seasons. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Fruits along with vegetables are crucial for a balanced diet. These not only have delicious flavors but are also reported to decrease the risk of contracting various chronic diseases. Fruit by-products are produced in huge quantity during industrial processing and constitute a serious issue because they may pose a harmful risk to the environment. The proposal of employing fruit by-products, particularly fruit peels, has gradually attained popularity because scientists found that in many instances peels displayed better biological and pharmacological applications than other sections of the fruit. The aim of this review is to highlight the importance of fruit peel extracts and natural products obtained in food industries along with their other potential biological applications. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Seed germination ecology of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) as influenced by various environmental parameters
PY  - 2022

AB  - Leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] is a perennial weed in more than 25 countries, including Australia. Knowledge regarding the seed biology of L. leucocephala could help in making weed management decisions. Experiments were conducted to study the effect of hot water (scarification), alternating temperatures, heat stress, salt stress, water stress, and burial depth on seed germination of two populations of L. leucocephala collected from Toowoomba and Gatton, Australia. The optimum duration of hot water treatment to break the hard seed coat dormancy was 2 min for both populations. The highest germination (92% to 98%) was recorded at 35/25 C for both populations, and similar germination occurred at 30/20 C. The Toowoomba population recorded greater germination at low temperature (15/5 to 25/15 C) than the Gatton population. Additionally, the Gatton population had higher germination than the Toowoomba population after 5 min of exposure to temperatures of up to 100 C, suggesting that the Gatton population may be more tolerant to heat stress. Germination was completely inhibited at pretreatment (5 min) temperatures of 150 to 250 C. The Toowoomba population recorded 17% greater germination than the Gatton population at a high salt concentration (160 mM NaCl), indicating its greater salt tolerance. At low moisture stress (-0.1 and -0.2 MPa), higher germination was observed in the Toowoomba population than in the Gatton population, whereas germination was similar for both populations at higher water stress levels (-0.4 MPa or lower). Germination was similar for both populations at shallow depths (0 and 1 cm) but higher emergence was recorded for the Toowoomba population at 2 to 8 cm than the Gatton population. Differential germination behaviors of both populations suggest that they adapted differently in their respective local environments. Knowledge gained from this study will help in formulating integrated management practices for L. leucocephala.  © 2022 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multipurpose tree species are recognized as an important fodder source for livestock, but their potential remains untapped due to dearth of knowledge about their nutritive value. Therefore, 15 MPTs, i.e., Acacia catechu, Albizia chinensis, Bauhinia variegata, Celtis australis, Ficus roxburghii, Grewia optiva, Leucaena leucocephala, Melia composita, Morus serrata, Olea glandulifera, Ougienia oojeinensis, Pittosporum floribundum, Quercus glauca, Q. leucotrichophora and Salix tetrasperma were evaluated for nutritional characteristics, relative nutritive value index (RNVI), palatability index and farmers’ preference on a seasonal basis in north-western Himalayas mid-hills. Most of the nutritive and mineral content decreased as leaves matured with the exception of ether extract, calcium, copper, organic matter and carbohydrate content, while cell-wall constituents and anti-nutritional contents increased. Overall, M. serrata had the highest RNVI in spring and summer, while G. optiva during autumn and winter. Similarly, L. leucocephala had the highest palatability (97.86%), while M. composita (38.47%) had the lowest one. Additionally, G. optiva was the most favored MPT for livestock among farmers, while M. composita was the least ones. The outcome of the study will help policy makers, planners and farm managers in establishing large scale plantations of highly nutritious and palatable species, like G. optiva, L. leucocephala, B. variegata, and M. serrata for year-round supply of green leaves and as a supplement to low-quality feed. © 2022 Navale et al.

AB  - Poisonous plants cause tremendous economic losses to the livestock industry. These economic losses are deterioration in their health, decreased productivity, deformed offspring, and reduced longevity. The current study is the first comprehensive report on poisonous plants of Azad Jammu and Kashmir which systematically documents the phytotoxicological effect and mode of action in livestock. The information was gathered from 271 informants including 167 men and 104 women through semi-structured interviews and literature search through available databases. The data collected through interviews was analyzed with quantitative tools viz. the factor informant consensus and fidelity level. A total of 38 species of flowering plants belonging to 23 families and 38 genera were reported. Family Asteraceae (5 spp) was the most dominant, followed by Solanaceae (4 spp), Fabaceae (4 spp), Euphorbiaceae (4 spp) and Convolvulaceae (3 spp). Among all the species collected, herbs were the dominant life form (22 spp, 57.89%), trailed by shrubs (11 spp, 28.95%), and trees (5 spp, 13.16%). Whole plant toxicity was reported to be the highest (15 spp, 39.47%), followed by leaf toxicity (12 spp, 31.58%), seed toxicity (4 spp, 7.89%), fruit toxicity (3 spp, 10.53%), latex toxicity (2 spp, 5.26%), flowers toxicity (1 spp, 2.63%), and berries toxicity (1 spp, 2.63%). The most toxic route of administration was found oral (39 spp, 40.63%), followed by intraperitoneal (24 spp, 25%), and intravenous (21 spp, 21.88%). The most commonly affected organ was found liver (20.41%), followed by gastrointestinal tract (20.341%), CNS (16.33%), skin (14.29%), kidneys (12.24%), lungs (4.04%), reproductive organs (2.04%), spleen (1.75%), blood (1.75%), heart (1.75%), urinary tract (1.75%), and pancreas (1.75%). The maximum Fic value was found for dermatological disorders (0.91), followed by the endocrine system (0.90), gastrointestinal (0.82), neurology (0.77), nephrology (0.67), cardiovascular (0.67), urinary (0.67), respiratory (0.60), sexual (0.60) disorders. Senecio vulgaris, and Ageratum conyzoides were the most important plants with fidelity level (0.95) and (0.87). Nerium oleander, Lantana camara, Leucaena leucocephala, and Ricinus communis were the important poisonous plant with maximum fidelity level (100%). Ricinus communis with reported lowest LD50 (<20 mg/kg) was the top-ranked poisonous plant followed by Lantana camara and Justicia adhatoda (25–50 mg/kg), Nerium Oleander (157.37 mg/kg), and Datura innoxia (400 mg/kg). We found that knowledge about poisonous plants is less prevailing in the rural areas of Azad Kashmir compared to the knowledge about medicinal plants and poisonous nature of reported plants is due to production of toxic substances and presence of essential oils.

AB  - The effects of outdoor access, stocking density, and age on broiler behavior, stress, and health indicators in a tropical climate were assessed over two seasons, winter and summer. Two hundred and forty Cobb500 male chickens were allocated to one of four treatments, with six replicates of ten birds in each: low stocking density indoors with outdoor access (LO); high stocking density indoors with outdoor access (HO); low stocking density indoors without outdoor access (LI); and high stocking density indoors without outdoor access (HI). Scan sampling was used to record their behavior both indoors and outdoors. At 28 and 42 days old, blood samples were obtained to determine the heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio. At 42 days old, chickens were culled and inspected for footpad dermatitis (FPD), and bone quality was examined. Their spleens and bursas of Fabricius were collected and weighed, relative to carcass weight (RW). A factorial analysis was used to test the effects of season (winter or summer), outdoor access (with or without), stocking density (low: 5 animals/m2 or high: 10 animals/m2), and age (28 or 42 days) on the behavior and stress and health indicators. There were no major effects of providing outdoor access on behavior, except that resting was reduced by providing outdoor access to older birds and those at low stocking densities inside. Resting was also greater in indoor and high-density treatments during winter. The bursa of Fabricius was heavier in summer in outdoor birds. The tibia bones were shorter in the outdoor birds. Heterophil numbers were greater in the outdoor treatments in summer but not in winter. These results indicate that outdoor access can increase activity in some situations, and potentially increase bone strength, but it may also increase the risk of stress, particularly heat stress in summer. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - A COMPARISON OF FOREST REGENERATION IN AN ABANDONED RUBBER PLANTATION AND LOGGED-OVER FOREST WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR FOREST-ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION IN SOUTHEAST THAILAND
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85211995406&partnerID=40&md5=8ee11575cf866ed500005e2a970b5736
AB  - Rubber plantations have been encroaching into upland areas in Southeast Asia for many decades. Such monocultural expansion is a major driver of deforestation in many countries. In Thailand, illegal rubber plantations are subject to government forfeiture and most have been abandoned, allowing subsequent forest regeneration. In Rayong Province, Southeast Thailand, rubber has expanded into upland forest areas since 1987. Here, we report on tree regeneration and ground flora in a rubber plantation abandoned 20 years ago in semi-evergreen forest in the province and compare it with a regenerating forest that was selectively logged prior to 1978. We also surveyed mammals and birds at each site, to determine the potential for zoochorous seed dispersal. The tree flora (≥10 cm DBH) of the abandoned rubber plantation was dominated by Leucaena leucocephala (Leguminosae, Mimosoideae), and the sapling layer (1–5 cm DBH) by Streblus ilicifolius (Moraceae). The non-native L. leucocephala had been introduced by the plantation owner to enrich the soil. Rubber trees (up to 33 years old) still dominated the upper canopy. Native small-tree density (5–10 cm DBH) was 66% higher and native large-tree density (≥10 cm DBH) was 24% lower in the abandoned rubber plantation (ARP) than in the logged evergreen forest (LEF), indicating an earlier successional status in the former. Species richness and diversity of woody plants were higher in the LEF than in the ARP in most strata, except for tree and shrub species ≥5 cm DBH, of which 73 species had re-established in the ARP (despite competition from the alien L. leucocephala), compared with 63 species in the LEF. Native liana species were common in both plots (22 species in the ARP; 24 in the LEF). Of all native trees and shrubs ≥5 cm in DBH in the ARP 73% were known to be dispersed by animals, in comparison with 79% for the LEF. Longterm research is needed to determine if native species, recruiting into the ARP from nearby logged natural forests, will be able to outcompete the alien species and become dominant. © 2022 Siam Society under Royal Patronage.

TI  - Allelopathy and Allelochemicals of Leucaena leucocephala as an Invasive Plant Species
PY  - 2022

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit is native to southern Mexico and Central America and is now naturalized in more than 130 countries. The spread of L. leucocephala is probably due to its multipurpose use such as fodder, timber, paper pulp, shade trees, and soil amendment. However, the species is listed in the world’s 100 worst invasive alien species, and an aggressive colonizer. It forms dense monospecific stands and threatens native plant communities, especially in oceanic islands. Phytotoxic chemical interactions such as allelopathy have been reported to play an important role in the invasion of several invasive plant species. Possible evidence for allelopathy of L. leucocephala has also been accumulated in the literature over 30 years. The extracts, leachates, root exudates, litter, decomposing residues, and rhizosphere soil of L. leucocephala increased the mortality and suppressed the germination and growth of several plant species, including weeds and woody plants. Those observations suggest that L. leucocephala is allelopathic and contains certain allelochemicals. Those allelochemicals may release into the rhizosphere soil during decomposition process of the plant residues and root exudation. Several putative allelochemicals such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and mimosine were identified in L. leucocephala. The species produces a large amount of mimosine and accumulates it in almost all parts of the plants, including leaves, stems, seeds, flowers, roots, and root nodules. The concentrations of mimosine in these parts were 0.11 to 6.4% of their dry weight. Mimosine showed growth inhibitory activity against several plant species, including some woody plants and invasive plants. Mimosine blocked cell division of protoplasts from Petunia hybrida hort. ex E. Vilm. between G1 and S phases, and disturbed the enzyme activity such as peroxidase, catalase, and IAA oxidase. Some of those identified compounds in L. leucocephala may be involved in its allelopathy. Therefore, the allelopathic property of L. leucocephala may support its invasive potential and formation of dense monospecific stands. However, the concentrations of mimosine, phenolic acids, and flavonoids in the vicinity of L. leucocephala, including its rhizosphere soil, have not yet been reported. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The roost tree characteristics of Indian flying fox (Pteropus medius) were studied in the midland laterite hillocks of northern Kerala in peninsular India. A total of 170 trees belonging to 20 families, 32 genera, and 37 species were identified as roost trees from eleven roost sites located in Kannur and Kasargod districts of northern Kerala. Roost tree parameters such as habit, origin, diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, bole height, crown length, crown spread, and crown closure were analyzed. Families Anacardiaceae and Lamiaceae represented more number of roost trees in the study area. The mean bat abundance per tree for the entire study area was found to be 54.35±5.2 and it was highest for Ficus religiosa (peepal) followed by Tetrameles nudiflora (false hemp tree) and Leucaena leucocephala (subabul). Bats showed a preference for native trees and did not show any difference in the selection of evergreen and deciduous trees for roosting. The study also revealed that P. medius prefers large trees with greater height, diameter, crown length, and crown spread. As the midland laterite hillocks are under severe habitat degradation, the study recommends preserving large trees for better conservation of the remaining habitats of P. medius in the area. © 2022 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the physiological adaptability of pregnant doe Kacang goats in a dryland area of Indonesia. Thirty pregnant doe Kacang goats aged 2-3 years were observed. The rearing system was semi-intensive without giving concentrated feeds. Local grasses and legumes such as Leucaena leucocephala leaves, Gliricidia sepium leaves, Sesbania grandiflora leaves, and drinking water were offered ad libitum. Experimental data such as respiration rate, rectal temperature, adaptability coefficient, heart rate, and heat tolerance coefficient, were collected during 2-3 months of gestation. The mean and standard deviation were calculated using a descriptive analysis method. The average humidity in the morning and afternoon and the ambient temperature in the middle of the day were outside the normal range. The THI value indicates that the experimental animals are under medium heat stress. The average values of HTC, AC, RT, HR, and RR were still typical for goats. In conclusion, although the average ambient temperature at midday and humidity in the morning and afternoon were outside of the normal range, they did not cause any effects on feed and water intake, health, and fetus growth and development of pregnant doe Kacang goats. This happened because the Kacang goat is a local breed that can adapt well to extreme environments. Therefore, pregnant doe Kacang goats in Malaka District can be allowed to graze in the paddock throughout the day and housed at night. © 2022 Malque Publishing. All rights reserved.

TI  - Potential of field edge rainwater harvesting, biomass transfer and integrated nutrient management in improving sorghum productivity in semi-arid regions: a review

AB  - Sorghum has been promoted in arid and semi-arid areas due to its drought tolerance which makes it survive under harsh environmental conditions, but grain yields are very low, e.g., averaging 514 kg ha−1. The use of field edge rainwater harvesting techniques of tied contours and infiltration pits can be suitable options to capture rainfall and reduce runoff on the soils. Furthermore, integration of field edge rainwater harvesting with appropriate soil fertility management practices can potentially increase sorghum yields. The use of biomass transfer of nitrogen fixing trees such as Leucaena leucocephala is an agroforestry practice which can improve soil fertility through increasing mineral nitrogen, cation exchange capacity and porosity, water retention, and reduce soil bulk density. Other appropriate soil fertility management include integrated nutrient management (INM) where organic fertilisers such as cattle manure are mixed with inorganic fertilisers. These technologies are examples of climate smart agricultural practices that have the potential to increase sorghum yields. The integration of rainwater harvesting techniques and INM show improved sorghum yields ranging from 750 to 2100 kg ha−1 with potential of increasing yields in clay soils. However, currently there is little data available on the implementation of these technologies in semi-arid areas. This paper reviews and analyses the potential effect of integration rainwater harvesting, biomass transfer and INM on sorghum yields in semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The cDNA encoding S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase was isolated from giant leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata) root tissue mRNA. Transcriptome data and 5′-RLM-RACE were used to obtain the transcript sequence and clone into the T7-expression vector pEt14b. N-terminal Histidine-tagged recombinant protein was expressed highly in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized by activity assays. A straightforward method using isocratic reverse-phase HPLC analysis (mobile phase: 0.02M o-phosphoric acid) of enzyme assays determined optimal enzyme activity at pH 10.0, 55 °C and 200 mM KCl. In addition to thermophilic activity, giant leucaena SAM-synthetase remains highly active in solutions containing up to 4 M KCl and accepts Na+ to some extent as a substitute for K+, a known required cofactor for SAM-synthetases. The enzyme followed Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Km = 1.82 mM, Kcat = 1.17 s−1, Vmax 243.9 μM. min−1) and was not inhibited by spermidine, spermine or nicotianamine. Giant leucaena SAM-synthetase is a highly tolerant enzyme to extreme conditions, suggesting further studies on plant SAM-synthetases. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Abstract: Nitrogen management in a karst basin is examined through the establishment of legumes Leucaena leucocephala and Phaseolus vulgaris in pasture and crop areas respectively, with the objective of enriching the nutrient flow interrupted by the construction of dams and canals built during the 1990s, which have altered the natural patterns of hydrological variation and transport to the sea. The different soil treatments show low values of overland fluxes to the sea between 0.9623 and 0.9624 kg ha−1 yr−1 for crops, discretely increasing by 0.02% in pasture and by 0.28% for crop + pasture according to the geomorphic potential of the basin. For land use conditions, a positive economic nitrogen balance was estimated in the range of 55–1560 for crops and 22–2400 USD ha−1 yr−1 for pastures, the latter showing positive balances at the lowest fixation rates, confirming that cover management with legumes maximizes gains and minimizes losses for both agricultural and marine ecosystems, providing a source of indirect fertilization downstream where agricultural areas are located. Article highlights: In the flat karst region, geomorphological potential is the main factor in predicting the dynamics of sediment movement.Leguminous land use has a weak effect on alleviating pressures on the island's oligotrophic marine ecosystems.In both crop and pasture, a positive annual economic balance of N was found in the range of 55–2400 USD ha−1 yr−1. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Hypertension is a significant public health problem worldwide, a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cause of premature death. Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity is one of the causes of hypertension. Lamtoro Gung has potential as an Angiotensin-I-converting Enzyme Inhibitory (ACE-I) due to the presence of peptide that able to inhibit its activity to prevent hypertension. The germination process was carried out to hydrolyse storage proteins and produce peptides that have a low molecular weight. This study investigated ACE-I activity from Lamtoro Gung seed during germination and evaluated the blanching effect on it. This experiment was conducted with a Completely Randomised Design (CRD), and the factor is the differences in germination duration (0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h). Proteolytic activity and the degree of hydrolysis during germination were studied to know the correlation between germination and ACE-I activity. The highest ACE-I activity sample was blanched with three different durations (2, 4, and 6 s). The 48 h germinated Lamtoro Gung had the highest ACE-I activity (70.62%). This result was supported by the proteolytic activity (168.79 U/g protein dry matter) and degree of hydrolysis (23.26%). Forty-eight hours of germination of Lamtoro Gung resulted in the highest ACE-I activity. Blanching of germinated Lamtoro Gung for 2 s could hold the ACE-I activity, but the longer duration decreased it. © 2022 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. All rights reserved.

AB  - [Objective] To investigate the change characteristics of soil particulate carbon and nitrogen content in the process of plantation restoration and to provide references for studying the response mechanism of soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics to plantation restoration. [Method] Leucaena leucocephala plantations at young age, middle age and matured age in Yuanmou dry-hot valley were selected and the natural shrub-grass plot as the control, the change characteristics of the soil particulate carbon and nitrogen content of natural shrub-grass plot and L. leucocephala plantations with different ages were studied. [Result] Compared with the natural shrub-grass plot, the age stage of L. leucocephala plantations significantly affected the soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), POC/SOC, POC/PON. The proportion of mass of soil particle, SOC and TN contents were the highest in the matured plantation, while the POC, PON, POC/SOC, and POC/PON were the highest in the middle aged plantation. [Conclusion] The invasion of L. leucocephala into shrubs in dry-hot valley will significantly change the dynamics of soil carbon and nitrogen and its stability. The soil nutrient content in the matured plantation is the highest, while the soil stability in the middle-aged plantation is the lowest. This study could provide data support for the comprehensive evaluation of the effect of L. leucocephala on improving the soil ecological function in dry-hot valley. © 2022, Editorial Department of Forest Research.

AB  - Non-native (introduced, exotic, and alien) species alter forest ecosystem processes, cause landscape change, interfere with services provided by native trees, and contribute to biotic homogenization. To quantify the degree of invasion by non-native trees in the United States, we combined two broad-scale datasets: (1) tree species occurrence data from the national Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot network and (2) ecoregions characterized by relatively homogeneous environmental conditions. Using the FIA statistical design, we created an indicator of non-native tree regeneration success by estimating the proportion of small trees (seedlings and saplings) relative to all trees for non-native species in the conterminous United States and southeast Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Species with at least 75 percent of their stems consisting of smaller stems were classified as highly invasive while those with 60 percent to 75 percent of smaller stems were classified as moderately invasive. Above these thresholds, non-native species are of ecological concern because they are established and reproducing successfully and therefore likely to continue to spread in the future. For the conterminous United States and southeast Alaska, we identified 16 highly invasive and four moderately invasive non-native tree species. Widespread highly invasive and relatively well-established species included Ailanthus altissima, Triadica sebifera, and Ulmus pumila. The richness of highly invasive species was the highest in parts of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic States, followed by much of the Southeast. In Hawaii, we identified seven highly invasive and three moderately invasive non-native tree species. The most widespread highly invasive and well-established tree species in the archipelago were Psidium cattleyanum, Psidium guajava, Ardisia elliptica, and Syzygium cumini. The largest numbers of highly invasive species were inventoried in the lowland/leeward dry and mesic forests of O’ahu and the lowland wet and mesic forests of Hawai’i Island. Puerto Rico had 17 highly invasive and two moderately invasive tree species. The most widespread and well-established non-native species were Leucaena leucocephala, Spathodea campanulata, Coffea arabica, Syzygium jambos, and Melicoccus bijugatus. The results of this assessment offer insights into which species are most likely to alter forest ecosystems and which forests may be effectively managed to control invasive trees.

AB  - The current study demonstrates a green, quick and easy method for producing and characterization of silver nanoparticles from dehydrated leaf extract of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam-AgNPs) to evaluate its antibacterial activity against harmful bacteria, photocatalytic degradation of dyes used in textile dyeing industries and antioxidant activity to reduce oxidative stress. The UV-Visible spectra maximum absorption peak (λmax) of the Lam-AgNPs was noticed at 436 nm. FTIR vibrational spectra revealed the phytoconstituents that cause the reduction and stabilization of AgNPs from the plant extract. The average crystallite size was calculated to be 26 nm using the Debye-Scherrer equation with X-ray diffraction studies. The EDS spectra screening exposed a high concentration of silver with a weight % of 71.67 % and atomic % of 30.49 %. TEM studies showed the nano-sized particles that were spherical to quasi-spherical in shape and polydistributed in nature. Most particles are spread in the 15-20 nm and 30-35 nm size ranges. Lam-AgNPs had effective antibacterial action against four tested strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida and Klebsiella pneumoniae by the zone of inhibition observed at 20 mm, 19 mm, 15 mm and 16 mm, respectively. The DPPH free radical scavenging assay was used to study the antioxidant activity of Lam-AgNPs and the IC50 value calculated was 240.70µg/ml. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of biogenic Lam-AgNPs for the degradation of Red m5b dye was investigated under solar light irradiation and 100% degradation was noticed after 90 minutes of reaction. © 2022

AB  - The present study was planned to screen nutritional properties of eight different species of top feeds viz., Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, Bambusa vulgaris, Ficus benghalensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Pithecellobium dulce, Senegalia catechu and Terminalia arjuna used in southern Gujarat, India. Top feeds were assessed for their chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, gas production potential and polyphenolic fraction using rumen liquor of Surti buffalo. To check resemblance, two conventional fodders Sorghum vulgare and Medicago sativa were also assessed. Crude protein (CP) content was in the range of 10.28 (Acacia nilotica) to 21.71% (Pithecellobium dulce). The NDF content varied from 35.57% (Acacia nilotica) to 64.47% (Bambusa vulgaris). Acacia nilotica had the highest total phenolic (12.60%) content, whereas Azadirachta indica had higher condensed tannin (CT) content (8.60%). In vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) of top feeds ranged from 75.41 to 86.71% and 50.09 to 72.67%, respectively. The in vitro gas production (IVGP) was high (P>0.05) in Azadirachta indica (44.00 ml). Results revealed that all proximate components, fiber fractions, mineral content, total phenols and their fractions in top feeds were found comparable to or better than conventional fodders. Major parameters of in vitro digestibility were also resemblance and more comparable to conventional fodders. However, Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, and Pithecellobium dulce were found best suitable amongst top feeds by considering their chemical composition, phenolic contents and in vitro rumen evaluation. © 2022, Range Management Society of India.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a nitrogen-fixing legume and a fast-growing species used for various purposes, including food, medicine, and most recently, energy-source wood. Compared to other commonly planted legumes, this species has a high-stress tolerance, and only one recorded insect infestation. The transcriptome analysis revealed genes involved in the production of stress tolerance compounds in the root. In this study, we attempted to extract simple sequence repeats (SSRs) from the transcriptome data of L. leucocephala root to establish molecular markers. The SSRs mined from L. leucocephala transcriptome deposited in NCBI with accession number GDRZ00000000. We used Krait v.1.3.3 to extract the SSRs and developed the primers. The SSRs cover 0.3% of the total transcriptome sequence, with 21.321 perfect SSRs found and relative density 2908.63 (bp/Mb). The most abundant type of SSRs was found in mononucleotide (39.85%), followed by dinucleotide (33.49%) and trinucleotide (24.75). However, for tetra, penta, and hexanucleotide, the percentage was lower than 2%. The number of primers generated was 8137 primers, with 3969 dinucleotides, 3947 trinucleotides, 150 tetranucleotides, 21 pentanucleotides, and 50 hexanucleotide SSR primers. This finding may help to accelerate stress-tolerant legume improvement in the future. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - The worldwide environmental changes and increasing levels of carbon dioxide are some of the key natural concerns of the date. In the present article, the evaluation of urban woods organization was utilized to measure the capability of urban biological system as carbon sink and moderating environmental changes through carbon digestion, and the capability of the framework to upgrade biodiversity preservation. Recently settled regions appeared to have lower carbon stockpiling potential, while territories set up before have most elevated carbon stockpiling potential. Around 36 diverse tree species developing/planted as urban timberland were recognized, ruled by Senna siamea, Azadirachta indica, Polyalthia longifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Pithecellobium and Mangifera indica. Aside from being common enhancement the tree species as carbon dioxide (CO2) sink through photosynthesis and territories of ex-situ preservation through plants, urban ranger service can store huge amount of carbon anyhow biodiversity preservation particularly where they spread broad regions like parks, nurseries, and roads oversaw over extensive stretches, similar to the case in urban environments. Improved administration of urban forests will probably improve the potential for carbon storing by earthly vegetation as a method for alleviating CO2 outflows and environmental change just as biodiversity protection. It is appeared here that such a system may contain the board practices that think about the net impact of both diminishing weakness and outflows. In the biophysical domain, these practices may incorporate, however, are not constrained to planting more trees, planting better adjusted species to the future atmosphere, lessening tree worry, among others. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.

AB  - Phytostabilization is a more appropriate way for rehabilitation of metal-polluted environments in the Copperbelt region. A 1.5-hectare tree planting trial had been installed on the tailings dam (TD) with the help of organic matter (OM) mixed to topsoil. Then, 15 years later, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of the tree plantation, in regard to soils and spontaneous vegetation. The Cu and Co concentration was higher in the reclaimed soil compared with the unreclaimed. Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia polyacantha, Albizia lebbeck, Pinus sylvestris, Psidium guajava, Senna siamea, Senna spectabilis, and Syzygium guineense responded well to the criteria of phytostabilization, whereas Leucaena leucocephala was very invasive. Metal concentration was manifold higher in charcoals than in woods (Zn: 3.8–39.8 mg kg−1 in wood versus 272–523 mg kg−1 in charcoal) with no differences between charcoals regardless of the origin. The tree implantation aided with amendments can meet the criteria of phytostabilization through good survival and regeneration in the heavily contaminated TD.

AB  - The aim of this research is to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of TiO2 nanocatalyst in fast pyrolysis. Leucaena leucocephala was used as the feedstock pyrolyzed in the presence of TiO2 catalyst in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. The influence of pyrolysis temperature, catalytic zone temperature and TiO2 catalyst to biomass (T/W) ratio on bio-oil production was evaluated. The structure and surface chemistry of TiO2 catalyst were characterized by various analytical techniques. The characteristics and composition of the biomass were also investigated. In the absence of the catalyst, the maximum bio-oil yield of 54.21% was achieved at a pyrolysis temperature of 500°C. Regarding the influence of catalytic zone temperature, pyrolysis at 600°C using the T/W ratio of 1:1 resulted in an upgraded bio-oil product the yield of which was 59.98%. The obtained bio-oil contained 27.1% oxygen content with the HHV of 29.1 MJ/kg, indicating the TiO2 catalyst could enhance the yield of bio-oil, accompanied by a decrease in gas generation. Moreover, in this study, the maximum yield 67.1% was obtained using 3:1 T/W ratio. The obtained bio-oil consisted of oxygen content 24.5% and generated the highest HHV of 31.5 MJ/kg. Thus, the TiO2 catalyst had a potential for improving production efficiency of bio-oil product. © 2022 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC), Asian Institute of Technology.

AB  - Plant species possess a huge potential in restoration of fly ash ecosystem. Litter deposition and its decomposition in the ash deposited sites are two important processes of the fly ash ecosystem. In order to identify the biological potential of a plant species to aid restoration of fly ash deposited sites, it is needed to assess leaf litter decomposition as well as nutrient release pattern. In the present investigation, we studied the leaf litter decomposition of the plant species (Leucaena leucocephala, Pithecellobium dolce and Prosopis juliflora) and mix plantation in the fly ash ecosystem. The litter bag experiment was conducted in the area of plantation on the fly ash deposited site during a period of 365 days. Percentage of C and N was higher in L. leucocephala > P. dolce >Mix Plantation > P. juliflora while C/N ratio was higher in P. juliflora >Mix Plantation > L. leucocephala > P. dolce. L. leucocephala and P. dolce showed relatively fast decomposition rates (k = 1.27, 1.17), respectively while mix plantation (k = 0.82) and P. juliflora (k = 0.73) exhibited relatively slower decomposition rates. Thus, we noted that the decomposition rate of L. leucocephala was greater than the other selected species. This shows that the species having faster decomposition rate and nutrient release could be a factual choice for rehabilitation of fly ash deposited sites. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer was used to investigate the effect of using different bleaching agents during the bleaching process on the functional group of cellulose obtained from Leucaena leucocephala pods. The spectra showed that fiber treated with 5 % sodium hypochlorite (NaCIO) showed a similar functional group with the commercial cellulose. Moreover, the chemical composition analysis and whiteness index showed that fiber treated with NaCIO produced 89.37 % cellulose. The whiteness index was 78.5 %, which was the highest. Therefore, these results are expected to provide insight into the potential of utilizing L. leucocephala pods as the alternative raw material for the isolation of cellulose, as the pods of these plants are underutilized.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an efficient technique for the reclamation of salt-affected soils by growing plants. The present study aims to evaluate the intercropping of halophyte Atriplex nummularia Lindl. with naturally occurring species (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) adapted to semiarid regions as a management capable of enhancing the phytoremediation capacity of these species. A field experiment was conducted in a randomized block and contained four replicates. Species were cultivated alone and in association with A. nummularia to evaluate their potential uses in the reclamation of soils. Exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+, as well as salinity and sodicity variables, were evaluated. The evaluations were performed at 9 and 18 months of plant growth. The results indicated that A. nummularia individualized was the treatment most efficient; with reductions of 80%, 63%, and 84% in electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, and exchangeable sodium percentage values, respectively at 18 months compared to starting of the experiment. However, the use of A. nummularia and species adapted to the semiarid in association, or even alone, promoted beneficial effects on the soil quality after the establishment of the plants. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Sustainability use of expensive protein source in a dairy ration requires ration formulation based on rumen degradable and undegradable protein ratio (RDUP). It improves the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis and less feed residue to the environment. Providing less expensive green protein sources such as leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) is also an alternative. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dairy ration based on RDUP with leucaena addition on in vitro fermentability and digestibility. This study was conducted in a 4 x 3 factorial randomized block design. Factor 1 was RDUP levels (R1= 60:40; R2= 55:45; R3= 50:50; R4= 45:55) and factor 2 was Leucaena addition (L1= 10%; L2= 20%; L3= 30%). The data were analyzed using ANOVA and followed by the Duncan test. The result showed that increasing RDUP levels increased NH3 concentration and dry matter digestibility. Treatment L2 resulted in a high NH3 concentration compared to other L treatments. The combination of R1 with L2 and L3 resulted in the highest total VFA concentration than other treatments. Protozoa population increased with increasing leucaena in the ration. It is concluded that dairy ration with 60:40 rumen degradable protein to undegradable protein ratio and 20% leucaena can improve ruminal fermentation and digestibility. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Hymenolepis nana is globally distributed. Leucaena leucocephala has been studied as a treatment, including the nematodes and protozoa, but no research results are related to cestodes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to target H. nana. Methods: The natural components of L. leucocephala were isolated and added to H. nana, which was cultured in vitro, to observe changes in the mortality, motility, and morphology. BALB/c male mice infected with H. nana were treated with effective components of L. leucocephala for 10 days, and the changes were recorded. After the mice were sacrificed, the spleen weight was measured, and a primary culture was performed for the subsequent cytokine and chemokine testing. Results: The experiment found that 132-hydroxy-(132-S)-pheophytin a and aristophyll-C have clear cestocidal effects in vitro. 132-hydroxy-(132-S)-pheophytin a has been shown to be effective at reducing parasite populations and eliciting host immune responses in vivo. IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, MCP-1, IFN-γ, TNF-α, MIP-1α, and GM-CSF in 132-hydroxy-(132-S)-pheophytin a were significantly increased after stimulation, while IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-3, IL-12p70, and RANTES were unchanged. Conclusions: The investigation shows that components of L. leucocephala have actual cestocidal activity against H. nana. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - To test the applicability of alternate land use systems for improving soil functionality in restored ecologies, soils were sampled from 0–15, 15–30 and 30–45 cm deep layers of Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Hardwickia binata (HB), Emblica officinalis (EO), Azadiracta indica (AI)-based silviculture systems; Acacia nilotica-based silvipasture systems (AN); and natural grassland (NG). These were compared with samples from fallow land (F). They were evaluated for their carbon management index (CMI), nutrient supply capacity (NSC), soil functionality (SF), ecorestoration efficiency (ERE) and 21-day cumulative microbial respiration (CO2-21) to assess their applicability in semiarid India. Soil functionality and functional diversity as impacted by restoration have remained largely overlooked. The LL had ~12, 7 and 11% higher CMI than fallow in sampled soil layers. ERE of LL was ~ 55, 65 and 79% higher than fallow land in sampled soil layers, respectively. However, ERE in surface layer was poorer than subsequent soil layers for all systems. The LL, HB and AN improved NSC and SF by: a) ~ 2.5-, 2.2- and 1.6-times; and b) 9.3-, 5.3- and 5.1-times over fallow land in the surface soil layer. A similar trend was observed for SF in lower layers. However, the topsoil layer had >16% mean SF values than subsequent layers. LL, HB and AN systems had ~4.2-, 2.3- and 1.9-times higher CO2-21 than fallow land in the top layer. CO2-21 was positively correlated with NSC and SF but could not predict ERE well. Hence, legume tree-based restoration tactics might be useful for improving land restoration and soil functionality in semiarid regions. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Environmental contamination with Cadmium (Cd) is of great concern due to its hazardous effects on living organisms.Query In the present research, Leucaena leucocephala plants were exposed to Cd concentrations of 5, 10, and 15 mg/L to determine their potential use in Cd remediation. Different parameters including Cd uptake, macro/micronutrient content, chlorophyl, and catalase production were determined. Results indicated that Cd uptake by L. leucocephala roots did not show a significant difference between treatments. However, a significant increase in Cd content (Tukey´s HSD) was observed in stems as Cd levels in the media augmented. The highest Cd content (830 ± 20 mg/kg) was determined in stems of plants exposed to 15 mg/L Cd, and no Cd was detected in leaves. Data showed that as Cd concentration increased in the media, Ca, Mg, K, Zn, and Mn decreased. Moreover, while the presence of Cd reduced catalase activity in roots, chlorophyll production was not affected. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Protein and iron source snack bar made from Mlanding Tempeh – A fermented Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala)
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137630791&doi=10.17170%2fkobra-202204136016&partnerID=40&md5=1c7083eaf1b23ede2f60783d2682b730
AB  - Mlanding Tempeh is an Indonesian fermented food made from Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala), a tropical legume that contains complete nutrients. The legume has high productivity and adapts well to dry climates thus serving well as a plant-based protein source in arid areas to improve the local food security. This is especially true for Indonesian male adolescents who often suffer from undernutrition. This study aimed to introduce a process to further improve the nutritional value and potential acceptance of the Mlanding Tempeh by developing it into a snack bar. A complete food process development and nutrient analysis were performed. Analysis of anti-nutrient content found a reduction of tannins after 24h fermentation of Lamtoro, from 52.11 to 4.20 (mg. tannic acid). Frying and oven-baked method was chosen for processing the Tempeh into the snack bar. Formulation with 60% Mlanding Tempeh, 35% red kidney beans, and 5% puffed rice had the highest acceptance and preference score. The energy and nutrients such as protein, fat, and carbohydrates content in 100 g of snack bars were 385.44 kcal, 17.62 g, 3.18 g, and 71.58 g, respectively. A 100 g of snack bar provided around 29% of the daily protein and 22.27% of iron needs for male adolescents. Hence, the Mlanding Tempeh snack bar can be considered a good source of protein and iron for this demography. In addition, it also has high dietary fibre. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background. Through in vitro studies, dried Leucaena leucocephala leaf (DLL) was identified as potential candidate in mitigating enteric methane (CH4) emission. Nevertheless, its efficiency as suitable feed for sheep has not been determined in Ethiopia. Objective. To assess the suitability of replacing the concentrate mix (CM) with DLL on voluntary intake, growth performance in rams and in vitro CH4 production. Methodology. Thirty yearling rams were first stratified according to their initial body weight similarities and then individuals from each stratum were randomly assigned to five treatment diets with six rams each. The control diet contained CM with 346 g/head/d (T1), and treatment diets replacing the CM in the control diet with DLL at a rate of 5% (T2), 10% (T3), 15% (T4) and 20% (T5) with the corresponding CM to DLL mixture ratio of 346:0, 329:17, 311:35, 294:52 and 277:69 g/head/day. Grass hay was provided ad libitum to all rams. Data were collected on fed intake and body weight. Methane (CH4) production was determined along with 24h in vitro gas production (GP). Digestible organic matter (DOM) and Metabolizable energy (ME) were estimated from 24h GP. Results. The contents of ash, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDFom), acid detergent fiber (ADFom) and acid detergent lignin were higher in DLL than in the control diet while it contained the lowest EE value. The DLL had the highest Ca and K values as compared to the control diet. The feed intake, live weight and weight gain did not differ (P>0.05) among rams supplemented with various levels of DLL. The total intake of CP increased across treatment diets and was significantly higher for T3, T4 and T5 than T1 and T2 diets. None of the supplementation levels of L. leucocephala affected the total intake of DM, NDFom and ADFom. There was a linear reduction (p<0.05) of in vitro CH4 production as the levels of DLL in the diet were increased. It was lowest in T4 and T5 diets being significantly different from those of T1 and T2. The T5 diet showed the lowest values and differed (p<0.05) from those of T1, T2 and T3. The ME and DOM values were higher (p<0.05) in T1 and T2 diets than that of T4 and T5. No difference in ME and DOM values were observed between T1, T2 and T3 diets as well as among T4 and T5 diets. Implications. The current findings suggest that conventional CM could be replaced with DLL up to 20% as alternative protein source in ruminant nutrition in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Conclusion. The replacement of CM with DLL significantly reduced the in vitro CH4 production across treatment diets without affecting the voluntary intake and growth performance parameters in rams.

TI  - Microbial colonisation of tannin-rich tropical plants: Interplay between degradability, methane production and tannin disappearance in the rumen
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133872837&doi=10.1016%2fj.animal.2022.100589&partnerID=40&md5=97a846abcaf6a498b301fdca103f2c5a
AB  - Condensed tannins in plants are found free and attached to protein and fibre but it is not known whether these fractions influence rumen degradation and microbial colonisation. This study explored the rumen degradation of tropical tannin-rich plants and the relationship between the disappearance of free and bound condensed tannin fractions and microbial communities colonising plant particles using in situ and in vitro experiments. Leaves from Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium, and Leucaena leucocephala, pods from Acacia nilotica and the leaves of two agricultural by-products: Manihot esculenta and Musa spp. were incubated in situ in the rumen of three dairy cows to determine their degradability for up to 96 h. Tannin disappearance was determined at 24 h of incubation, and adherent microbial communities were examined at 3 and 12 h of incubation using a metataxonomic approach. An in vitro approach was also used to assess the effects of these plants on rumen fermentation parameters. All plants contained more than 100 g/kg of condensed tannins with a large proportion (32-61%) bound to proteins. Calliandra calothyrsus had the highest concentration of condensed tannins at 361 g/kg, whereas Acacia nilotica was particularly rich in hydrolysable tannins (350 g/kg). Free condensed tannins from all plants completely disappeared after 24-h incubation in the rumen. Disappearance of protein-bound condensed tannins was variable with values ranging from 93% for Gliricidia sepium to 21% for Acacia nilotica. In contrast, fibre-bound condensed tannin disappearance averaged ∼ 82% and did not vary between plants. Disappearance of bound fractions of condensed tannins was not associated with the degradability of plant fractions. The presence of tannins interfered with the microbial colonisation of plants. Each plant had distinct bacterial and archaeal communities after 3 and 12 h of incubation in the rumen and distinct protozoal communities at 3 h. Adherent communities in tannin-rich plants had a lower relative abundance of fibrolytic microbes, notably Fibrobacter spp. whereas, archaea diversity was reduced in high-tannin-containing Calliandra calothyrsus and Acacia nilotica at 12 h of incubation. Concurrently, in vitro methane production was lower for Calliandra calothyrsus, Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala although for the latter total volatile fatty acids production was not affected and was similar to control. Here, we show that the total amount of hydrolysable and condensed tannins contained in a plant govern the interaction with rumen microbes affecting degradability and fermentation. The effect of protein- and fibre-bound condensed tannins on degradability is less important. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Woody plant community structure and composition of an urban riparian forest in Monterrey metropolitan area, Northeast Mexico
PY  - 2022

AB  - This work details the structure and composition of the woody plant community of a gallery forest located in the La Silla River, between Monterrey and Guadalupe urban areas in Nuevo León, Mexico. For the analysis, the woody vegetation was categorized into upper and lower strata. The upper stratum maximum height was 38 m, and the canopy cover was 100%. The canopy consisted of 22 species from 16 families, of which seven species represented 82.3% of the importance value index (IV); Taxodium huegelii had the highest IV (34.32%). The lower stratum maximum height was 2.5 m, and the cover was 48%. Thirteen species from 10 families were identified, five of which reached 81.3% of the IV; Ricinus communis had the highest IV (23.42%). The plant community diversity was 3.8 and 2.29, based on Margalef and Shannon indices, respectively. As one finding in the present study, it can be stated that the main threat is the presence of widely distributed exotic species such as Ricinus communis and Leucaena leucocephala, with high importance values. However, the presence of a well-established tree stratum, as well as the presence of species typical of the gallery forest, suggest a good state of conservation of this gallery forest. The present results highlight the importance of studying the composition, structure, and diversity, taking into consideration the flora of floristic provinces, as an analytic strategy for the diagnosis of riparian lentic community health.  © 2022 The Torrey Botanical Society.

AB  - in vitro study was carried out to measure methane (CH4) production and ruminal fermentation parameters of tropical forages either commonly used and with a potential for inclusion in Colombian livestock systems. The forages evaluated wereUrochloa hybrid cv. Cayman, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena diversifolia, Megathyrsus maximus cv. Mombaza, Urochloa brizantha cv. Toledo, Canavalia brasiliensis,Urochloa decumbens, Tithonia diversifolia and Dichantium aristatum. which were incubated using the in vitro gas technique for 96 h. Treatments with higher neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and crude protein (PC) contents had higher gas production, dry matter (DM) degradability and the highest CH4 production (ml/g DMd) at 24 hours. Methane at 24 hours of incubation varied between 4.69 and 8.10 ml and increased by 43% on average at 48 hours. In all treatments, the highest proportion of volatile fatty acid (VFAs) corresponded to acetate, which was more than 50% of the total VFAs produced. Treatments with Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman and their associations with Leucaena diversifolia had the lowest CH4 production values at 24 h. Similarly, treatments with Cayman grass, its associations with Leucaena and Toledo grass alone showed the highest DM degradability values. In conclusion, the inclusion of Leucaena and Tithonia diversifolia on a diet based on forage grass (Cayman or Toledo) had a positive effect on nutrient content and degradability and the group of treatments that included Cayman grass and its associations had lower CH4 production values and higher degradability than the rest of the treatments. © 2022 Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - This review provides examples of the utilisation of plant bioactivity to mitigate enteric methane (CH4) emissions from the Australian ruminant production systems. Potential plant-based mitigation strategies that reduce CH4 without major impacts on forage digestibility include the following: (i) low methanogenic tropical and temperate grass, legume and shrub forage species, which offer renewable and sustainable solutions and are easy to adopt, but may have restricted geographical distribution or relatively high costs of establishment and maintenance; (ii) plant-based agricultural by-products including grape marc, olive leaves and fruit, and distiller's grains that can mitigate CH4 and provide relatively cheap high-nutrient supplements, while offsetting the impact of agricultural waste, but their use may be limited due to unfavourable characteristics such as high protein and water content or cost of transport; (iii) plant extracts, essential oils and pure compounds that are abundant in Australian flora and offer exciting opportunities on the basis of in vitro findings, but require verification in ruminant production systems. The greatest CH4 mitigation potential based on in vitro assays come from the Australian shrubs Eremophila species, Jasminum didymium and Lotus australis (>80% CH4 reduction), tropical forages Desmanthus leptophyllus, Hetropogon contortus and Leucaena leucocephala (∼40% CH4 reduction), temperate forages Biserrula pelecinus (70-90% CH4 reduction), perennial ryegrass and white clover (∼20% CH4 reduction), and plant extracts or essential oils from Melaleuca ericifolia, B. pelecinus and Leptospermum petersonii (up to 80% CH4 reduction). Further research is required to confirm effectiveness of these plant-based strategies in vivo, determine optimal doses, practical modes of delivery to livestock, analyse benefit-cost ratios and develop pathways to adoption.  © 2022 Journal compilation

AB  - Composting is an environmental-friendly option for yard waste management, and produces products for improving soil quality. However, there is a weed dispersal risk if the compost contains many active weed seeds. This study assessed the potential of composting in minimizing the seed germination of a major tropical invasive weed, Leucaena leucocephala. The germination of the species was tested after two different sets of thermal treatments, i.e., (1) different constant temperatures (20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C, and 70 °C) for 5 days, and (2) composting temperature (simulating the temperature profile of a typical composting process) for 60 days. A three-month growth test was further conducted for the seeds treated with the composting temperature. The seeds were present either alone (N-seeds) or mixed with wood chips (W-seeds) when thermally treated. A constant temperature treatment of 70 °C suppressed the seed germination to a low rate. For the composting temperature treatment, the germination percentage of the N-seeds and W-seeds were reduced from around 60% to 22.7% and 12.7%, respectively. This preliminary study suggested that the temperature should reach as high as 70 °C in the composting process to guarantee the suppression of the germination of the seeds of L. leucocephala, particularly when the seeds are contained within seed pods during composting. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The use of agricultural practices such as fertilization and intercropping can improve the production of forage cacti. The objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of forage cactus intercropped with leguminous trees and fertilized with different sources of manure in the tropical semiarid region of Brazil. The research was carried out at the Agricultural and Livestock Research Enterprise of Pernambuco State during the period from March 2011 to September 2013. The following cultivation systems were used: (i) Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth + forage cactus cv. IPA-Sertania [Opuntia cochenillifera (L.) Mill]; (ii) Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit + forage cactus; and (iii) forage cactus in monoculture. All of these systems were fertilized with different sources of manure (cattle, goat, sheep, and broiler litter). The goat and sheep manure (16.6 and 16.5 Mg DM ha−1 year−1) provided the least production of cactus in the different cropping systems. Cattle manure provided greater production of forage and wood from legumes (1.4 and 4.3 Mg DM ha−1 year−1) and cactus (20.9 Mg DM ha−1 year−1). Gliricidia produced more forage and wood than Leucaena. Total production of the forage cactus-Gliricidia system produced 4.7 and 3.8 Mg DM ha−1 of biomass and wood in two years, respectively. The production and morphological characteristics of the cactus increased at further distance from the trees (3 m), and the opposite effect was observed for the concentrations of N, p, and K. Thus, cropping systems using forage cactus and tree legumes fertilized with manure represent an option for tropical semiarid regions. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Great Facilitation of Thirty Years of Reforestation with Mixed Species to Ecosystem Nitrogen Accumulation in Dry-Hot Valley in the Jinsha River
PY  - 2022

AB  - Nitrogen is a key factor influencing ecosystem structure and function in reforestation, but knowledge of ecosystem nitrogen accumulation through reforestation with mixed species is limited. Especially in the dry-hot valley of the Jinsha River, no studies cover total ecosystem nitrogen accumulation in mature plantations and its allocation for difficulty in collecting tree roots and deep soil from dry red soil. In this study, nitrogen accumulation of seven mixed plantations in the dry-hot valley in the Jinsha River was studied after thirty years of reforestation with an analogous sites method. The results were as follows: (1) Soil nitrogen stocks decreased with depth in the soil profile. Deep soil nitrogen storage (20–80 cm) was significantly correlated with stand age (R2 = 0.752, p = 0.000; n = 7), accounting for 56–63% of total soil nitrogen storage and 43–47% of soil nitrogen accumulation in the dry-hot valley. (2) Total biomass nitrogen stock of the 30-year-old plantation was 1.22 t ha−1, 61 times that of degraded wasteland and 7.6 times that of natural recovery shrub grassland, and it recovered to the reference level of natural forest following 30 years of reforestation. (3) Total ecosystem nitrogen stock in the 30-year-old plantation was 12.72 t ha−1, 1.4 times the reference wasteland and 1.19 times the natural recovery shrub grassland. The contribution of soil nitrogen to ecosystem nitrogen storage and accumulation was 90% and 67%, respectively. Litter nitrogen accounted for 1.6% ecosystem nitrogen storage. It indicated that reforestation with mixed plantation of Leucaena leucocephala and other species greatly facilitated more ecosystem nitrogen accumulation, especially soil nitrogen (including deep compartment). Secondary biomass nitrogen, especially litter, could not be overlooked. This study filled the gap of ecosystem nitrogen storage and distribution during reforestation in the dry-hot valley. Mixed plantation with legume species such as L. leucocephala and other species and an important role of secondary biomass, especially litter in nitrogen accumulation, provided a reference for the strategy formulation of reforestation and forest nitrogen management in the dry-hot valley and other semi-arid or arid regions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The objectives of the study were to determine the chemical composition, ruminal degradability, and apparent digestibility of mixed Napier (Pennisetum purpureum) (PP) –Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) (LL) silages. Freshly cut Napier and Leucaena were harvested and mixed at 70:30; 50:50; 30:70 ensiled for six weeks. The chemical composition of the fresh forages and the silages were determined using the AOAC (1990) procedures. Dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) ruminal degradability were determined by nylon bag technique using three rumen cannulated Bonsmara steers for periods of 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours. DM and CP ruminal degradability kinetics were described by fitting the data on the model P= a+b (1-e-ct) using the neway computer program where a is the rapidly degradable fraction, b is the slowly degradable fraction and c is the outflow rate. Hay supplemented with 25% mixed PP: LL silages was fed to three castrated male Pedi sheep to evaluate apparent digestibility coefficient and N retention. The fresh cut PP had more CP, Fat, and ash, with less OM. Leucaena was richer in most nutrients than Napier. The study indicated the 50:50 silage was the optimal mix to maximize the overall nutritive value. The DM and CP disappearance constants a, b and c were similar for all silages. PP: LL mixing ratio did not affect the DM and CP degradability kinetics of the silages. There was no effect on total dietary intake, apparent digestibility and N retention © 2022, Animal Nutrition and Feed Technology.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Giant leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata) can be managed as a profusely branched bushy plant by repeated harvest of its foliage for use as fodder. The objective of this research was to determine the effects of soil pH and salinity, age of the leaves, post-harvest storage duration, and psyllid infection on the nutritional qualities of leucaena fodder. To determine the effects of soil pH and salinity on fodder quality, giant leucaena K636 plants were grown in large pots containing soils adjusted to different pH and salinity levels. The effects of age of the leaves, post-harvest storage duration and psyllid infection on fodder quality were studied using leucaena samples collected from Waimanalo Research Station. Among five pH levels tested, pH 6.0 was found to produce the highest amounts of protein and structural fibers in the foliage. Mimosine contents were highest at pH 6 and 7 and lowest at pH 5.0. The growth of giant leucaena was retarded and the nutritional quality were adversely affected under salinity conditions. Compared to young leaves, old leaves contained 18.5% less protein, 95% less mimosine, 30% less tannin and 40% more structural fibers. Post-harvest storage duration up to 72 h, at room temperature did not seem to affect protein, tannin and structural fiber contents of the foliage; however, mimosine content was reduced by 25%. These results will help to identify ideal soil pH, age of foliage, and post-harvest storage duration for obtaining high forage yield and nutritional quality for giant leucaena. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Alien invasive Leucaena leucocephala successfully acquires nutrients by investing in below-ground biomass compared to native Vachellia nilotica in nutrient-Amended soils in South Africa
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145807935&doi=10.1093%2faobpla%2fplac026&partnerID=40&md5=a8ef199f6e59555bb4bc3c98d5585c84
AB  - Soils in grasslands and savannas of southern Africa are acidic and nutrient-poor. Legume plants, such as Vachellia nilotica and alien invasive Leucaena leucocephala, are a major component of the vegetation there. Vachellia nilotica can establish in drought-prone environments, and is invasive in high rainfall areas. Leucaena leucocephala is an emerging invasive in South Africa and is ranked among the world's 100 most invasive alien species. Alien plants can invade native habitats through their adaptability to low-resource soils, and thus can out-compete and displace native vegetation. We investigated the effects of phosphorus (P) deficiency and soil acidity on legume-microbe symbiosis, nitrogen (N) nutrition and carbon (C) growth costs of these two legumes in grassland soils. We used as inoculum and growth substrate soils collected from a long-Term (>65 years) nutrient and lime-Addition trial, the Veld Fertilizer Trial (VFT), located at Ukulinga Research Farm near Pietermaritzburg in South Africa. We used soils from three VFT treatments: soils fertilized with superphosphate (336 kg ha-1) applied once per year (+P), soils fertilized with superphosphate (336 kg ha-1) applied once per year with dolomitic lime (2250 kg ha-1) applied once every 5 years (P+L) and soils with no superphosphate and no dolomitic lime applications (Control). Seeds of V. nilotica and L. leucocephala were germinated and grown independently in these soils in green house conditions and harvested after 125 days for measurement of growth, legume-microbe symbiosis, N nutrition and C growth costs. Results showed that the two legumes had different growth adaptations. Vachellia nilotica grown in control soils and +P soils nodulated with various Burkholderia spp., while L. leucocephala did not nodulate in all soil treatments. Both legumes utilized for growth both atmospheric-and soil-derived N across all treatments thereby decreasing C growth costs. Vachellia nilotica grown in +P soils accumulated the most biomass and N nutrition. Leucaena leucocephala maximized specific N assimilation rates by investing in below-ground biomass accumulation in control soils. This shows that L. leucocephala possesses traits that are successful in acquiring nutrients by investing in below-ground biomass and relying on utilization of N from both the soil and the atmosphere.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

TI  - Dryland Livestock Rearing Relies Heavily on Tree fodders: A Narrative Review
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142351470&partnerID=40&md5=a63fa2048be1d124c0aa943bf18b67f9
AB  - Forage crops that are easy to maintain, more effective, drought tolerant, and supportive of dryland agriculture in arid and semi-arid areas of the world are now more likely to be prioritized. Dryland agriculture benefits from the unique characteristics of tree fodders such as it’s deeper root structure, low water requirement, and capacity to endure harsh climates. Additionally, the quality of the feed provided by fodder trees has been determined to be more nutritious than those received from other sources. It is also crucial that these fodder trees continue to supply the cattle with fodder even if other crops are impacted by drought and water constraint. This review paper provides significant information upon various important tree fodders that could be used for livestock rearing in dryland areas. © 2022 Indian Veterinary Assocaition.

AB  - The pyrolysis of coconut shell (CS) only, lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) wood residues (LWR) only, and a CS/LWR mixture was experimentally studied herein for the first time. Additionally, the reaction kinetics of solid destruction during the pyrolysis process of CS and LWR was deduced. An experimental investigation was carried out in a batch reactor at the different pyrolysis temperatures (300–500 °C). The highest phenol yield (30.97%) was observed at 500 °C for the pyrolysis of CS. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor and for degradation of solid were successfully determined for the first time using the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy was determined in the range of 121–153 kJ mol−1 for the temperature range of 300–500 °C. Meanwhile, the pre-exponential factors of 3.51×1010 s−1, 4.77×1010 s−1, and 5.38×1010 s−1 were calculated for the pyrolysis of CS only, LWR only, and a CS/LWR mixture, respectively. This research presents the mitigation for the alleviation of the energy crisis and to convert underutilized biomass to high-value products. © 2021, The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.

TI  - Nutritional Evaluation of Predominant Tree Fodders and Shrubs of Southern Kerala as a Quality Livestock Feed
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136208882&doi=10.18805%2fag.D-5388&partnerID=40&md5=c630d535f3254a640cd7b57f4683462d
AB  - Background: India ranks first in global livestock production and it is an important subsidiary enterprise that support more than 75 per cent of the rural community. But fodder production is not well practiced in our country and animals generally consume naturally grown grasses and shrubs which are of low quality in terms of protein and available energy. Hence, there is an urgent need to look for new fodder resources that are sustainable in nature and cover our fodder deficit. Keeping the above in view, the present study has been proposed to evaluate the predominant tree fodders and shrubs of Southern Kerala as a quality livestock feed. Methods: The study was conducted in College of Agriculture, Vellayani, Thiruvananthapuram during January-September, 2020 to assess the nutritional value of predominant tree fodders and shrubs in Southern Kerala as a quality feed for cattle. Ten different fodder trees and shrubs that locally fed to the cattle viz., Agathi (Sesbania grandiflora), erythrina (Erythrina indica), Drumstick (Moringa oleifera), Coconut (Cocos nucifera), Glyricidia (Glyricidia maculate), Matti (Terminalia elliptica), Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala), Cassava (Manihot esculenta), Banana (Musa acuminate) and Mango (Mangifera indica) were selected and analysed for proximate composition, crude fiber and mineral status. Result: The result revealed that mean values for dry matter, crude protein, crude fiber, ether extract and total ash in tree fodders were 37.07±4.02, 18.52±1.72, 18.56±2.07, 4.68±0.51, 8.72±0.66, respectively. The study also proved that Sesbania grandiflora (Agathi) is nutritionally superior to other tree fodders with high crude protein (25.24%) and lower crude fiber (8.43%) content. The Neutral Detergent Fiber content of fodder tree leaves varied from 17.34-65.32 per cent and that of Acid Detergent Fiber from 11.10-48.69 per cent. Phosphorus and potassium status of top feeds comes under the range of 0.26-0.93 per cent and 1.0-2.7 per cent respectively. However the highest amount of Calcium as well as magnesium was found in Moringa oleifera (2.75 and 0.60 per cent respectively). © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

AB  - Background: DNA barcoding have been considered as a tool to facilitate species identification based on its simplicity and high-level accuracy in compression to the complexity and subjective biases linked to morphological identification of taxa. MaturaseK gene (MatK gene) of the chloroplast is very vital in the plant system which is involved in the group II intron splicing. The main objective of this study is to determine the relative utility of the “MatK” chloroplast gene for barcoding in 15 legume as a tool to facilitate species identification based on their simplicity and high-level accuracy linked to morphological identification of taxa. Methods and Results: MatK gene sequences were submitted to GenBank and the accession numbers were obtained with sequence length ranging from 730 to 1545 nucleotides. These DNA sequences were aligned with database sequence using PROMALS server, Clustal Omega server and Bioedit program. Maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining algorithms were employed for constructing phylogeny. Overall, these results indicated that the phylogenetic tree analysis and the evolutionary distances of an individual dataset of each species were agreed with a phylogenetic tree of all each other consisting of two clades, the first clade comprising (Enterolobium contortisiliquum, Albizia lebbek), Acacia saligna, Leucaena leucocephala, Dichrostachys Cinerea, (Delonix regia, Parkinsonia aculeata), (Senna surattensis, Cassia fistula, Cassia javanica) and Schotia brachypetala were more closely to each other, respectively. The remaining four species of Erythrina humeana, (Sophora secundiflora, Dalbergia Sissoo, Tipuana Tipu) constituted the second clade. Conclusion: Moreover, their sequences could be successfully utilized in single nucleotide polymorphism or as part of the sequence as DNA fragment analysis utilizing polymerase chain reaction in plant systematic. Therefore, MatK gene is considered promising a candidate for DNA barcoding in the plant family Fabaceae and provides a clear relationship between the families. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Dyes are significant pollutant of our clean water. Adsorption using activated carbon uses lots of energy in the production stage. Thus, it is an expensive choice for contaminant clearance from wastewater. Modification of biomass particles using suitable chemical can produce adsorbent with lower cost. In this study, the Leucaena leucocephala biomass was treated with sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) as an adsorbent for Malachite green uptake from contaminated water. Batch adsorption studies were done to study the effect of various parameters on the adsorption percentage of the prepared adsorbent. The results showed that the optimum values evaluated for each adsorption parameters are 20 ppm for initial adsorbate concentration, 60 minutes contact time, 30 C for solution temperature, pH of 7, adsorbent particle size of 0.425 - 0.5 mm and 0.5 g/L adsorbent dosage. The results showed that SDBS treated Leucaena leucocephala has the potential to be used as a low-cost adsorbent for Malachite green dye from contaminated water. © 2022 Author(s).

AB  - In this study, Leucaena leucocephala was introduced in the traditional agriculture system and total six systems viz., cereal-cereal, pulse-cereal, agri-pastoral, agri-silvi-pastoral, agri-horti-pastoral and vegetable-vegetable were evaluated for livelihood security of farmers under rainfed sub-tropical foot hill plains of Jammu. The agri-silvi-pastoral system recorded an overall increase in gross income (43.23%), maize equivalent yield (50.73%), rain water use efficiency (55.57%), sustainable yield index (44.17) and employment days (34.7 md) in comparison to the other systems studied. The Leucaena leucocephala plots were also characterized by higher organic carbon content and available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium availability. This technological intervention also increased the fuel and fodder (mixed fodder and green leaves) production and enhanced the B: C ratio (61.6%) of the system when compared to other systems in vogue in rainfed subtropical foot hill plains of Jammu. © 2022, Range Management Society of India.

AB  - Agroforestry systems include trees or shrubs and grasses and are considered a sustainable method of restoring degraded pastures, mitigating climate change, and increasing carbon and nitrogen stocks in tropical soils. Thus, the objective of this study was to quantify the carbon and nitrogen stocks in different agroforestry systems with forage cactus in the semi-arid tropic of Pernambuco. The experiment (8 years) was conducted on a Regosol soil at Caruaru Experimental Station, Agronomic Institute of Pernambuco - IPA (8°14’S, 35°55’W). The following cropping systems were tested: i) gliricidia [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth] + forage cactus ‘IPA Sertânia’ [Nopalea cochenillifera (L.) Salm-Dyck], and ii) leucena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] + forage cactus ‘IPA-Sertânia’. Treatments were allocated in a complete randomized block design, with four replications. Samples were collected during the rainy seasons in the 0- to 0.10- and 0.10- to 0.20-m soil layers at 0, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 m in a perpendicular gradient from tree legume rows. Samples were used to determine soil carbon and nitrogen stocks. The different agroforestry systems did not differ significantly for C and N stocks. However, C and N stocks were significantly higher at the 0.10- to 0.20-m layer compared to the 0- to 0.10-m layer. It was observed that the 0.10-to 0.20-m layer stored an average of 36.6 Mg C ha-1 and 1.9 Mg N ha-1, while the 0- to 0.10-m layer stored an average of 14.7 Mg C ha-1 and 1.3 Mg N ha-1. It is concluded that the different cultivation systems with forage cactus are similar and efficient in storing carbon and nitrogen. The largest stocks of carbon and nitrogen occurred in the 0.10- to 0.20-m layer. © 2022 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ruminants, mainly cattle, contribute to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions as methane (CH4) is produced by ruminal fermentation. Hence, various anti-methanogenic feed strategies have been studied, including the use of plants with secondary metabolites. This study evaluated in vitro ruminal fermentation metrics, microbial composition by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and the CH4 production of the foliage of several tropical trees and shrubs: Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa oleifera, Albizia lebbeck, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Piscidia piscipula, Brosimum alicastrum, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Guazuma ulmifolia, Cnidoscolus aconitifolius, Gliricidia sepium and Bursera simaruba, using Cynodon plectostachyus grass as control. The results showed a wide variation in the chemical composition of the foliage, as well as in the ruminal microbiota. The crude protein (CP) content ranged from 11 to 25%, whereas the content of condensed tannins (CT) and saponins (S) was from 0.02 to 7%, and 3.2 to 6.6%, respectively. The greatest dry matter degradability (DMD) after 72 h was 69% and the least 35%, the latter coinciding with the least gas production (GP). A negative correlation was found between the CT and CH4 production, also between protozoa and fungi with the SGMT group of archaea. We concluded that the foliage of some tropical trees and shrubs has a high nutritional value and the potential to decrease CH4 production due to its CT content. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Leaves of twenty fodder tree species were collected from Forest College and Research Institute, Mettupalayam and estimated for nutritional and anti-nutritional factors during 2019. High and significant fodder yield (kg/0.5 acre) was recorded for Dalbergia sissoo (27.36) followed by Leucaena leucocephala (24.77), L. diversifolia (23.53) and Gliricidia sepium (19.36) along with high carbohydrate (16.60%) and calcium contents. Crude protein content ranged from 7.43 to 35.0%, crude fat content varied from 1.05 to 4.81% and carbohydrate content varied from 10.40 to 17.20%. The maximum phenol content was exhibited by Ficus religiosa (0.24 mg/g) and minimum in Sesbania grandiflora, Dalbergia sissoo and Moringa oleifera (0.02 mg/g). Highest and lowest tannin contents were recorded in Thespesia populnea and Neolamarkia cadamba (0.12 mg/g) and L. diversifolia, Inga dulce and Hibiscus tiliaceus (0.02 mg/g). All the fodder trees exhibited less phenol, tannins and nitrate contents, which are expected to show positive effects in ruminants as feed supplement throughout the year. © 2022, Range Management Society of India.

TI  - Comparative analysis of leaf litter decomposition and nutrient release patterns of bamboo and traditional species in agroforestry system in Ghana
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131329697&doi=10.1016%2fj.clema.2022.100068&partnerID=40&md5=4a9146d2dc0d8f1022ada644d784592c
AB  - Understanding leaf litter decomposition dynamics is imperative owing to nutrient release rates and synchronization. The overarching aim is to sustainably manage agroforestry systems and ensure environmental integrity. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the decomposition and nutrient release of leaves of different bamboo species (Oxytenanthera abyssinica, Bambusa balcooa, Bambusa vulgaris), rarely used woody perennials in agroforestry system in Ghana, and compared with commonly used agroforestry species; Albizia lebbeck, Senna siamea, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Eucalyptus grandis. Litterbag technique was used and freshly fallen leaves of the species (equivalent to 100 g on a dry weight basis) were collected and placed into 30 cm × 45 cm nylon litterbags with a 2-mm mesh size. The weight of the samples in the litterbags was based on local plant litter application rates (5 t dry matter ha1) for maize production in the study location. There was a total of 216 litterbags (27 per species) for the study. Eight transects spaced at 1.0 m apart were laid in a randomized complete block design and twenty-seven litter bags spaced 0.5 m apart were placed on each transect. The litterbags were buried at 2 cm depth and three samples of each species were retrieved and weighed for 210 days to determine weight loss and nutrient release. Compared with Oxytenanthera abyssinica (8 weeks) and Senna siamea (6 weeks) half-life, rate of decomposition was analogous and higher than the other species. Further, Bambusa balcooa and the other non-bamboo species showed similar rate of decomposition. However, Bambusa vulgaris had marginally slower rate of decomposition compared to the traditional species. The highest rate of N, P, K and Ca release was recorded for Albizia lebbeck. Nonetheless, rates of P, Ca and Mg release were comparable to the other non-bamboo species. Eucalyptus grandis and Bambusa vulgaris also showed dominance in initial nitrogen and lignin concentrations and release. Therefore, with the observed substantial and comparable litter quality and decomposition rate among the species, it may be imperative to consider using the bamboo species for soil amendment and green manure in agroforestry system. © 2022

AB  - A vegetation survey was conducted in Chobe district to document tree species in residential areas. The survey resulted in 44 tree species, representing 44 genera and 22 families across the nine study villages. The diversity and evenness ranged from 2.47–3.15 and 0.77–0.90, respectively. An average of 19, 7 and 5 native, exotic and alien tree species respectively, were recorded. The most frequent native tree species, e.g. Baikiaea plurijuga, in the residential areas was also the dominant species in the neighbouring woodlands, suggesting that the species was retained when the woodlands were converted to residential use. The indigenous fruit bearing tree species, namely Berchemia discolor and Sclerocarya birrea, and the exotic fruit-bearing tree species, namely Carica papaya and Mangifera indica, were dominant in most residential areas, signifying their contribution to household food security. Invasive alien tree species, Jatropha curcas and Leucaena leucocephala were most frequent and, therefore, need continuous monitoring to prevent their spread into natural ecosystems. The study recommends raising of public awareness about invasiveness of alien invasive tree species. © 2022, University of Montenegro. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of Root Distribution Characteristics on the Overturning Resistance of Leucaena leucocephala Forest in Debris-Flow Accumulation Area, Dawazi Gully, Yunnan, China
PY  - 2022

AB  - Tree resistance to overturning is crucial in forestry hazard applications and management. Tree anchorage varies considerably with species, tree age, and site conditions. We investigate the relationship between the root characteristics of the overturning slip surface and the role of roots (regarding different diameters in overturning). Four Leucaena leucocephala were fully excavated by a quadrate monolith to establish root distribution characteristics, and 19 L. leucocephala were uprooted until the trees completely overturned to measure the anchoring resistance to overturning. A model was developed to improve the descriptions of root characteristics in the mechanical processes for tree overturning. The results show that the distribution characteristics of the root system were well described by the model. For the root–soil plate radius, the thickest root diameter and the root biomass of different diameters at the overturning slip surface increased with the diameter at the breast height. The root biomass affected the strength of the overturning slip surface; the root density may be a key factor in identifying the location of the overturning slip surface. The model could predict the overturning moment of most overturned trees; although it overestimated the overturning moment for small diameters at breast height trees, the results will be useful for understanding the influence of root distribution characteristics in overturning. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Effects of Protein and Roughage Sources in Total Mixed Ration on Voluntary Feed Intake, Nutrient Intake and Blood Metabolites in Black Bengal Goats
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132230252&doi=10.18805%2fIJAR.B-1391&partnerID=40&md5=2d9b1b6a8f5d3bbb924e8c5b3281d145
AB  - Background: Agricultural productivity in Southeast Asian countries are important to produce food for human, thus the first priority to improve agricultural productivity is feed and feeding in livestock, especially in ruminants when rice straw and Napier grass are used as the roughage sources; in addition, cassava leaves and Leucaena leaves can be used as the protein sources. Interestingly, the strategy to improve feed in ruminant is through the use of total mixed rations (TMR) which are produced by combination of roughages, concentrates, minerals, vitamins and additives. Methods: During the period 2020-2021 a study with 2 × 2 factorial, in 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21 days per period tested the following TMR’s T1-5% urea treated rice straw with dried Leucaena leaves, T2-5% urea treated rice with dried cassava leaves, T3-fermented napier grass with dried Leucaena leaves and the T4-fermented napier grass with dried cassava leaves on voluntary feed intake, nutrient intake and blood metabolites in Black Bengal goats. Result: All treatments did not affect voluntary feed intake (kgDM/head/day and % BW) (P>0.05), but feeding with 5% urea treated rice with dried cassava leaves, it was non significantly higher (0.71 kgDM/day). Furthermore, nutrient intake of organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and rumination were not affected among all the four treatments (P>0.05). Additionally, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen and triglyceride concentrations in plasma were not influenced due to treatments (P>0.05). Nevertheless, Feed cost (USD/kg) was reduced T3 and T4. In conclusion, feeding Black Bengal goat with fermented napier grass with dried Leucaena leaves and fermented napier grass with dried cassava leaves in the TMR were suitable because of the lowest price (0.13 USD/kg) when compared to the other treatments. © 2022 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

AB  - The productive performance of dairy Mambí de Cuba cows in a silvopastoral system (SPS) was determined for five yearsunder commercial conditions. One hundred and thirty-six Mambí de Cuba cows, with 1-10 lactations were used. Feedingwas based on grazing of Megathyrsus maximus, Leucaena leucocephala foliage, forage complementation in the dry seasonand low level of concentrate feed. Milk yield on the control day (MYC), milk yield adjusted to 305 days (MY-305) andlactation length (LL) were estimated. The data were analyzed using mixed generalized linear models with the statisticalpackage SAS. The milk production was 10.3-10.5 kg cow-1 day-1. Cows with a calving body condition score (BCS) >3.0showed higher MYC (10.5-11.1 kg cow-1 day-1) than those with a calving BCS≤2.0 (9.6 kg cow-1 day-1); while cows with acalving BCS=3.0-3.5 had higher MY-305 (3 040.2 kg cow-1 lactation-1) than those with a calving BCS>3.5 (2 545.1 kg cow-1 lactation-1). Both MYC and MY-305 were similar regardless of the calving season of the cows; while LL had a trend todecrease in the rainy calving season (CS-R). It is concluded that the Mambí de Cuba cows, managed in a SPS with M.maximus and L. leucocephala showed acceptable milk production in both seasons of the year, which was affected in cowswith a calving BCS<3.0 or >3.5. © 2022 Fundacion CIPAV.

TI  - Performance, Rumen Microbial Community and Immune Status of Goat Kids Fed Leucaena leucocephala Post-weaning as Affected by Prenatal and Early Life Nutritional Interventions

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala represents a local protein source in tropical ruminant diets. However, its full exploitation is impaired by mimosine, unless it is degraded by the rumen microbial community. Recently, the ruminal bacterial communities of newborns were persistently modified through prenatal or postnatal dietary interventions. Such early-life interventions might enhance adaptation of ruminants to Leucaena leucocephala, which was investigated using a 2 × 2 factorial design trial that tested both supplementation of L. leucocephala in the late pregnancy diet of goat does, and supplementation of live yeast to their newborns. The composition of ruminal bacteria, immune status, as well as organic matter digestibility (OMD) and performance of kids were studied during and after the intervention. Ten pregnant goats were divided into two groups: the D+ and D– groups, which either received or did not receive 30 g of L. leucocephala forage meal during the last 7 ± 0.5 weeks of gestation. Twins from each goat were divided into the K+ and K– group (supplemented with or without 0.2 g/d of live yeast from day 3 until weaning at 8 weeks). Rumen samples were collected from 4-, 8-, 14-, and 20-weeks old kids to assess the bacterial community, while immune parameters (white blood cells, immunoglobulin M and G, and chitotriosidase activity) were measured in blood and saliva sampled at 4-, 8-, and 20-weeks. We found a stimulatory effect of the prenatal exposure on the post-weaning dry matter intake of the L. leucocephala supplemented diet, resulting in a higher daily gain and final body weight at 20 weeks in the D+ vs. D– group (406 vs. 370 g DM/d, 85.4 vs. 78.6 g/d, and 15.2 vs. 13.8 kg, respectively). Moreover, Ruminococcus represented a greater proportion of the rumen bacterial community of the D+ vs. D– kids (5.1 vs. 1.6%). Differences in the immune status were relatively small and not thought to be a driving factor of differences in animal performance. Furthermore, postnatal supplementation of live yeast favored maturation of the rumen bacterial community (i.e., greater abundance of Bacteroidetes, in particular Prevotella, and reduced abundance of Firmicutes) and protozoa colonization. Concomitantly, OMD was enhanced post-weaning, suggesting effects of the early-life intervention persisted and could have affected animal performance.

AB  - Background: Supplementation of grazing cattle with native and naturalized forages using silvopastoral systems has been suggested as an affordable strategy to reduce methane production and improve nutrition, diminishing the environmental impact of cattle production. Objective: To evaluate the effect of three tropical forage species in a silvopastoral arrangement on methane production and fermentation parameters using an in vitro ruminal simulation system (RUSITEC). Methods: Four diets were evaluated. The control treatment was a basal diet of colosuana grass (COL; Bothriochloa pertusa), while the other diets consisted of 70% COL complemented with 30% shrub forage from either Leucaena leucocephala (CL), Guazuma ulmifolia (CG), or Crescentia cujete (CT). A randomized complete block design with repeated measurements over time was used. Results: The inclusion of shrub forage did not affect pH, organic matter degradation (OMD) or volatile fatty acids (VFA). The inclusion of shrub forage affected the degradation of structural components. The concentration of N-NH3 increased in the CL diet compared to COL (p<0.05). In general, methane production in terms of mL/day, mL/g DMi, mL/g DMd, and mL/gOMd was reduced for CL compared to COL (p<0.05). Conclusions: Based on these results, inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala, Guazuma ulmifolia or Crescentia cujete on B. pertusa-based diets improves ruminal fermentation parameters and reduces in vitro methane production. © 2022, Universidad de Antioquia.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala growing in the tropics and subtropics serves as potential forage for livestock because its foliage is rich in protein, fiber, and minerals. However, its use for livestock feed has been hindered by toxic nonprotein amino acid mimosine. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method to reduce or eliminate mimosine from foliage. A previous study found that the fermentation of L. leucocephala foliage reduced the mimosine content and prompted the authors to isolate potent mimosine degrading microorganisms and characterize the mimosinase for the complete elimination of mimosine in the L. leucocephala foliage. The soil screening of the L. leucocephala tree surroundings led to the isolation of Arthrobacter sp. Ryudai-S1, which can degrade and assimilate mimosine as a nitrogen and carbon source. Mimosinase in this strain was found to be thermostable and showed strong activity. Docking model’s inspection and the interaction energy calculation between mimosine-pyridoxal-5ʹ-phosphate (PLP) complex and the active site of this enzyme identified 11 important amino acid residues that stabilized the binding. Of these amino acid residues, mutation experiment suggested that Tyr-263ʹ and Phe-34 stabilizes the substrate binding and play a critical role in guiding the substrate to proper positions to accomplish high catalytic efficacy and selectivity. These observations suggest that Arthrobacter sp. Ryudai-S1 could be potentially useful for the development of L. leucocephala feed with reduced mimosine content.

AB  - Melissopalynological analysis of 34 honey samples (17 summer and 17 autumn samples) collected from feral colonies of Indian hive bee (Apis cerana), European bee (Apis mellifera) and rock bee (Apis dorsata) during 2011 – 2015 from the Shimla Hills of Himachal Pradesh (India) was performed. Pollen from plant taxa belonging to 43 families was found in the honey samples. Of 34 honey samples from the Shimla Hills, 18 were unifloral with 12 pollen types as predominant and the remaining 16 samples were multifloral. The predominant pollen plant taxa of summer were Pyrus sp., Malus domestica, Prunus amygdalus, Prunus sp., Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Citrus sp. and Rhododendron arboreum. In autumn, the predominant pollen plant taxa were Leucaena leucocephala, Salvia officinalis, Eriobotrya japonica, Impatiens balsamina and Prinsepia utilis. Melissopalynological analysis of summer honey collected from Summer Hill and Sarahan tagged these as “mad honey”, since Rhododendron pollen was predominant. The pollen spectrum indicated a diverse bee plant flora, which is promising indicator to augment the beekeeping industry in this region. © 2022, University of Latvia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seedlings is the initial part of seed plant’s growth and development including areca nut palm which germination is an essential part of it. Organic mulching is one of the utmost sustainable practices, therefore, it has been employed to enhance areca nut seedlings growth. The study aims to evaluate the effect of several types of organic mulch on areca nut seedlings shoot-root growth. The 3-month long experiment was conducted according to completely randomized design, with four treatments, namely no mulching (control) (M0), gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) mulching (M1), imperata (Imperata cylindrica) mulching (M2) and lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) mulching (M3). The treatments were repeated 5 times with 20 experimental units. The findings revealed that no significant differences (p < 0.05) were found on the application of different organic mulching among all of the parameters. The treatment covered by imperata mulch tended to score the highest compared to other mulches on germination time, seedling height and shoot fresh weight while the minimum yield was recorded in M1 where gliricidia mulch was used. Application of organic mulch displayed better results for most of the parameters than that of the control resulting from an optimal growing environment for areca nut seedlings growth. © 2022 Universitas Sebelas Maret.

TI  - Changes in growth pattern and rhizospheric soil biochemical properties of a leguminous tree species Leucaena leucocephala under long-term exposure to elevated ozone
PY  - 2022

AB  - Increasing concentrations of ground-level ozone (O3) exert significant impacts on the plants, but there is limited data for belowground processes. We studied the effects of long-term exposure of elevated O3 (EO3) on plant growth parameters (plant height and biomass) and biochemical parameters (nutrients, microbial biomass and enzymatic activities) of rhizospheric soil of leguminous tree species Leucaena leucocephala. L. leucocephala seedlings were grown under ambient O3 (AO3) and EO3 (+20 ppb above ambient) under Free Air Ozone Concentration Enrichment (O3-FACE) facility and changes in plant growth and their rhizospheric soil properties were studied during 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of EO3 exposure. L. leucocephala showed significant reductions in shoot length, root biomass, shoot biomass, leaf biomass and total biomass during 12, 18 and 24 months of exposure to EO3. Total nutrients in rhizospheric soil like carbon and phosphorus were significantly reduced after 24 months of EO3 exposure. Most of the available nutrients showed significant reduction after 6, 12 and 24 months of EO3 exposure. A significant decrease was apparent in microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of EO3 treatment. Significant reductions were observed in extracellular enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, β-glycosidase, fluorescein diacetate, arylsulfatase, cellulase and protease) of soil after 6, 12 and 24 months of EO3 exposure. These results suggest that increasing O3 concentrations will directly impact L. leucocephala growth as well as have indirect impact on the nutrient contents (C, N, and P), microbial biomass and extracellular enzymatic activities of rhizospheric soil of L. leucocephala. Our results suggest that continuous increase in O3 concentrations will have serious implications for aboveground plant growth and belowground soil fertility in this region considered as O3 hotspot. © 2022, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - Four types of biochars were prepared from rice husk as farm waste, sugarcane bagasse as sugar cane juice store waste, residues of Leucaena leucocephala tree as horticulture waste and chicken manure as chicken farm reduce at 700οC, then evaluated as a alternative to control Tribolium castaneum, Rhyzopertha dominica, Oryzaephlius surinamensis and Sitophilus oryzae. The character of each type has been defined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with an Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to identify the elemental composition and functional groups distributed on biochars surface. The elemental compositions refer to the chicken manure biochar exhibited a decrease in Carbon concentration and increase Oxygen content; there is a negative correlation between C and O contents. On the other hand, the chicken manure biochar is the only tested biochar that contains Ca, P, and Cl. The chicken manure biochar has the largest number of functional groups on its surface, the mortality of insects was recorded after 10 days which showed that the chicken manure biochar was the most effective which contains more different elements and functional groups on its surface. The most affected insects were O.surinamensis and R. dominica with mortality percentages 86.66 and 73.33. Smaller particles of chicken manure biochar were more effective than larger particles against both R. dominica and O. surinamensis, the smaller particles (1.80—0.94 µm) recorded LC50 1.29 and 0.56 g/kg against R. dominica and O. surinamensis. SEM images for the affected insects showed the adhesion of biochar particles on insect’s body parts, also, the sensilla were disappeared as a result of the friction between biochar particles and insect cuticle. Our results may indicate the promising features of biochar as an alternative method to control some stored product insects with considering the source of biochar which affect its elemental and functional groups contents. Biochar had different efficacy depending upon its moisture contents, with increased moisture the toxicity of biochar decreased. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Rainwater harvesting and Leucaena leucocephala biomass rates effects on soil moisture, water use efficiency and Sorghum bicolor [(L.) Moench] productivity in a semi-arid area in Zimbabwe
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131079083&doi=10.1002%2fjsfa.12011&partnerID=40&md5=eb5005085002ce314fa063b7a340bb4c
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorghum is one of the major staple crops in Sub Saharan Africa but its production is mainly limited by moisture stress, frequent droughts and soil infertility, especially in the smallholder farming systems. This raises the need to develop climate smart options to improve sorghum production. The objective was to assess the effects of rainwater harvesting and use of different Leucaena leucocephala biomass rates on soil moisture content, rainwater use efficiency, and stover and grain yields in two sorghum varieties (Macia and SV1). The experiment was laid as a randomized complete block design in split-split plot arrangement from 2017/2018 to 2019/2020 season. RESULTS: The results show that tied contour (TC) and infiltration pits (IPs) significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil moisture content than standard contour (SC). Soil moisture content increased gradually with the increase in soil depth (20–40 cm > 0–20 cm), with 2018/2019 season having the maximum soil moisture content. Soil moisture content also increased with the increase in application rates of Leucaena biomass. Grain and stover yields were significantly (P < 0.05) increased by all Leucaena biomass application rates with higher yield observed in 2018/2019 season. SC had significantly lower grain and stover yields at all Leucaena biomass application rates. TC and IPs had comparable rainwater use efficiency compared to SC. Rainwater use efficiency increased with application rates of Leucaena biomass across all seasons and varieties. CONCLUSION: TC and IPs are better adaptive mechanisms against drought spells in semi-arid areas and can be combined with 10 t ha−1 of Leucaena biomass due to better yield increments realized. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Effect of Extraction Time and Temperature on Total Flavonoids and Coumarins Content of Petai Belalang (Leucaena leucocephala) Seeds
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137362845&doi=10.1063%2f5.0100500&partnerID=40&md5=a77555d6d29642e4eb574e06d92d42b2
AB  - Recently, much attention has been drawn towards flavonoids and coumarins as they demonstrate numerous pharmacological properties which have potential to be commercialized as medicines or supplements. Studies have found out that Leucaena leucocephala (L.leucocephala) plant possesses good natural antioxidant and antibacterial sources particularly flavonoids and coumarins that could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavengers. However, the isolation of antioxidants from this plant is often limited by the lignocellulosic components, mainly lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose found in the plant cell wall. The high durability of lignin in both physical and chemical environments has regarded as one of the most non-degradable compounds in nature. Hence, this study is to focus on the proper extraction technique of the phytochemicals to enhance the yield of the desired extracts. An investigation into the effect of time (0 – 48 min, at 12 min interval) and temperature (30 – 70 oC, at 10 oC interval) on the extraction of flavonoids and coumarins from L.leucocephala using microwave assisted hydro-distillation (MAHD) were performed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Total flavonoid content (TFC) and total coumarin content (TCC) were used for determination of flavonoids and coumarins in the extracts. Experimental results show that highest TFC and TCC were observed at 60 oC in 36 min of extraction. The best conditions were performed using two-way ANOVA revealed that the optimum conditions were the extraction conducted at 60 oC in 12 min with significance different in average TFC and TCC values by both parameters with the p values of p<0.05. TFC and TCC were significantly correlated with time and temperature of the extraction. This finding suggests that the extraction by MAHD only require short period of time to achieve optimum flavonoids and coumarins. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Vernonia amygdalina (leaf), Garcinia kola (seed), and Leucaena leucocephala (seed) are three well-known tropical plants used in African ethnomedicine to reduce parasitic worm burdens and are potential sources of alternative solution for controlling parasitic helminths infection in grazing livestock. This study investigated extracts from these plants for anthelmintic activity against adult Haemonchus placei, an haematophagous nematode from cattle abomasa. Powdered plant materials were macerated in acetone and the crude acetone extracts evaluated for anthelmintic activity using H. placei adult worm motility assay. Afterwards, fresh sample of V. amygdalina was macerated successively in chloroform and acetone and the extracts evaluated for anthelmintic activity. The chloroform extract was subjected to phytochemical and FT-IR analyses and fractionated by vacuum liquid chromatography. Anthelmintic data were fitted to a nonlinear regression equation (Log [extract or fraction] vs. lethality; variable slope) to produce best-fit sigmoidal curves and LC50 values computed with associated uncertainty. Results: Of the three tropical plants, only V. amygdalina was active against adult H. placei with best-fit LC50 of 6.51 mg/mL (95% CI: 5.32–7.75). Evaluation of the two extracts obtained by successive maceration showed that chloroform extract (LC50, 2.46 mg/mL, 95% CI: 1.87–3.28) was 11 times as potent as acetone extract (LC50, 27.01 mg/mL, 95% CI: 21.32–48.57) (α < 0.0001). Chromatographic fractionation of the chloroform extract yielded four fractions (FA-FD) with FB (LC50, 2.38 mg/mL, 95% CI: 1.76–3.28) 2.19 times as potent as FC (LC50, 5.21 mg/mL, 95% CI: 4.40–5.79) against H. placei, while FA and FD were inactive. Phytochemical evaluation of the chloroform extract revealed the presence of saponins, steroids, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, and the absence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and anthraquinones. FT-IR structural analysis of chloroform extract indicated the presence of key functional groups which are chemical fragments/ structural motifs known to be present in the two major classes of bioactive compounds (sesquiterpene lactones and steroid glucosides) reportedly to be found in V. amygdalina. Conclusions: The findings showed that chloroform extract of V. amygdalina leaf possessed relatively good anthelmintic activity against adult H. placei. This could be indicative of its potential usefulness as an anthelmintic phytomedicine to control gastrointestinal nematodes infection in cattle. Key highlights: Extracts of three different plant materials (one leaf, two seeds) were tested against adult Haemonchus placei in vitro;Chloroform extract of Vernonia amygdalina was 11 times as potent as acetone extract;Fractionation of the chloroform extract yielded a bioactive fraction responsible for about 90% of the total lethal effect of the chloroform extract.Bioprocessing of V. amygdalina leaf could produce phytomedicines for organic livestock farming.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (commonly known as leucaena) is a leguminous species of the family Fabaceae and a native of Mexico and Central America. It is often addressed as a “miracle tree” for offering a wide variety of ecosystem services and possessing strong ecological attributes. The multiple uses of leucaena in agroforestry, livestock, and restoration practices led to the worldwide distribution of its ssp. glabrata and leucocephala. However, following its introduction into non-native regions, the commercial value of ssp. leucocephala was challenged by its large-scale spread outside the cultivation zone. It has assumed a status of an environmental weed and invasive plant in many regions across Africa (17 countries and Island nations), Asia (17), Europe (1), Oceania (23), North America (12), and South America (7). The plant is enlisted in the top five terrestrial invasive plant species with the greatest international presence. The species is now considered one of the 100 worst invaders in the world. The plant mainly invades roadsides, wastelands, cultivated lands, riverbanks, and forest edges, and suppresses the growth of other woody and herbaceous species. Its infestations alter the patterns of vegetation, plant succession, and community assembly in the introduced habitats. Propagation of ssp. leucocephala, without considering the environmental risks associated with it, may result in major repercussions and irreparable losses. Therefore, it is important to discuss its invasive propensities and the possible alternatives that may replace the weedy species without encumbering its economic benefits. This review aims to thoroughly evaluate the ecological and invasive attributes of leucaena, promote awareness about the ecological costs associated with its spread, and suggest suitable options for its management.

AB  - Although the capacity of plants to store carbon is known, obtaining information about the sequestration potential in the soil and in herbaceous, shrubby and tree biomass in land use systems is essential, even more so in landscapes dominated by livestock. The objective was to study the dynamics of carbon storage in three different forage systems in a livestock farm in Concepción, Paraguay. For this, the carbon level was estimated at different soil depths (0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) and in the herbaceous/shrub biomass in three systems (Brachiaria brizantha cv Marandú, Panicum maximum cv Colonial and Leucaena leucocephala consortium with colonial), with an interval of 30 days between the three measurement moments. The results generated from the biomass indicated that the system constituted by the colonial forage consortium with L. leucocephala, presented the highest level of carbon (3.73 t.ha-1), showing a significant difference in relation to the B. brizantha (2.12 t.ha-1; p<0.05). On the other hand, the initial period showed higher carbon concentration (4.55 t.ha-1; p<0.05). Likewise, a higher content was found at a depth of 0-20 cm (20.26 t.ha-1; p<0.05). These results were obtained in a winter process. In this regard, it is important to mention that forage shrubs in systems with pastures constitute a fundamental nutritional resource in winter, in this sense it is recommended to use improved and consortium pasture systems, to increase carbon storage, achieve stable and productive systems, in correspondence with its potentialities. © The Authors, 2021, Published by the Universidad del Zulia.

AB  - Street trees are always considered a vital part of urban green infrastructure in urbanized areas through mitigating the negative effects caused by urbanization taking part in human well-being. However, little is still known about their diversity, structure and protection, mostly in Lubumbashi city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), where the pace of urbanization is not only rapid but also unplanned. In this study, using an inventory, we have characterized the diversity, structure and protection measures of street trees along a land-use planning gradient in Lubumbashi for both planned and unplanned neighborhoods. From the results, a total of 1596 trees were en-countered, comprising 40 species, 33 genera and 17 families, mostly dominated by exotic species (65%). In addition, most of the studied trees (63%) belonged to four species only (Jacaranda mimosifo-lia, Leucaena leucocephala, Mangifera indica, and Acacia auriculiformis) with Leucaena leucocephala and Jacaranda mimosifolia being highly represented in unplanned and planned neighborhoods, respectively. The most abundant diameter classes in the planned neighborhoods were those with at most 10 cm against the classes larger than 50 cm in the planned neighborhoods. In both neighborhoods, trees with protection equipment represent less than 35%. Furthermore, in planned neighborhoods notably, nearly half of the observed equipment is in a good condition. Despite the benefits associated with street trees, there is a need to reduce the proportion of exotic tree species by planting native utilitarian tree species. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata (giant leucaena) is a tree legume, whose foliage is used as a fodder for animals because of its high protein content. In spite of being a highly nutritious fodder, giant leucaena foliage has two undesirable secondary metabolites, mimosine and tannin. The amounts of mimosine and tannin in giant leucaena foliage are known to vary under different environmental conditions. Giant leucaena was grown under different salinity, pH and nitrogen availability conditions. It produced the highest amounts of mimosine at pH 6.0–7.0, whereas, variation in soil pH did not affect tannin concentrations. Salinity stress had negative effects on both mimosine and tannin concentrations, while nitrogen abundance promoted both mimosine and tannin production. Seven genes for mimosine and tannin metabolism were isolated from a transcriptome library of giant leucaena. These were mimosine synthase, mimosinase, chalcone synthase, flavanone 3β-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol reductase, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, and anthocyanidin reductase. The highest level of mimosine synthase activity was observed in the absence of salt in the soils. Mimosine synthase activities had strong positive correlation with mimosine concentrations in the foliage (R2 = 0.78) whereas mimosinase expression did not appear to have a direct relationship with salt concentrations. The expression of mimosine synthase was significantly higher in the leucaena foliage under nitrogen abundant condition than in nitrogen deficiency conditions, while mimosinase expression was significantly higher under nitrogen deficiency condition than in nitrogen abundance conditions. Mimosine concentrations in the foliage were positively correlated with the expression levels of mimosine synthase but not mimosinase. Similarly, the concentrations of tannin were positively correlated with expression levels of dihydroflavonol reductase, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, and anthocyanidin reductase. Understanding of the environmental conditions that promote or inhibit transcription of the genes for mimosine and tannin biosynthesis should help to design environmental conditions that inhibit transcription of these genes, resulting in reduced levels of these compounds in the leucaena foliage.

TI  - Development of Meso- and Macro-Pore Carbonization Technology from Biochar in Treating the Stumps of Representative Trees in Taiwan

AB  - This study uses the tree stumps of the three representative trees in Taiwan (Leucaena leucocephala, Syzygium samarangense, and Ziziphus jujuba) as the material source and recyclable oyster shell powder as an activator. A carbonization process for upgrading and recycling the tree stumps was developed with our homemade, digital-controlled, energy-saving carbonization system. First, the tree stumps are carbonized at a medium temperature of 500 °C and then heated to 900 °C for high-temperature carbonization, followed by the activation procedure as required. With our method, we can produce biochar with a high proportion of fixed carbon and a high proportion of meso- and macropores while maximizing the yield of wood vinegar. The specific surface area of the meso- and macropores can reach up to 70 m2/g or more. The effect of different activation materials on the pore characteristics and specific surface area of biochar was carefully examined. It was found that both KOH and oyster shell powder is the ideal activator for producing biochar with a high proportion of meso- and macropores. The FTIR spectrum, CEC, and contents of the ordinary elements and heavy metals of the biochar were also reported. It is clear from the FTIR data that the absorption peaks of the overall spectrum of the three types of biochar after carbonization at high temperature are cleaner than those of biochar carbonized at low temperature. This research can promote the recycling of agricultural residues, enhance soil carbon sequestration, preserve fertilizers, and suppress diseases and pests, moving towards approaching the goal of net-zero carbon emissions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Ice adhesion to superhydrophobic surfaces is most of the time studied regarding their wetting properties, in attempts to predict the best candidates to promote low ice adhesion. However, no clear correlation between water repellency and ice adhesion has yet been defined, thus limiting the development of low ice adhesion superhydrophobic surfaces to empirical testing. The present study puts forward a mechanical based approach (usually used for bonded joints) to rationalize the role of the surface structure on ice adhesion. Experimental observations on a single microtextured substrate form the basis for the development of a fracture toughness analysis. Compared to a smooth aluminum substrate, shear ice adhesion measurements show that adhesion increased by 30% when ice penetrated the surface structure microgrooves (Wenzel ice) or decreases by 36% when air remained trapped beneath the ice (Cassie ice). Post-mortem observations of the fracture surfaces were performed using a replica technique. Formulas were derived to compute the interfacial fracture toughness of Cassie and Wenzel ice, depending on the geometry of the microtexture. The fracture toughness was then used as an input parameter into a finite element model comprising a cohesive zone layer to model the interface. This semi-analytical approach gave values in good agreement with experimental results, thus showing the relevance of the present toughness analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Initial In Vitro Assessment of the Antifungal Activity of Aqueous Extracts from Three Invasive Plant Species

AB  - The development of new, safe, and effective methods of managing fungal pathogens is required. This study was conducted to perform an initial in vitro assessment of the antifungal activity of water-based plant extracts from three plants which are invasive in Egypt: Prosopis juliflora, Ipomoea carnea, and Leucaena leucocephala. These extracts were tested against three pathogenic fungi species that cause high crop losses in Egypt: Fusarium solani, Alternaria solani, and Colletotrichum circinans. Three extract concentrations, 10%, 20%, and 30%, were tested using a completely randomized design, with three replicates per treatment. Antifungal activity was determined based on the effects of plant extracts on fungal radial growth inhibition, average daily growth of fungi, spore formation, spore germination, and total biomass. Inhibition of the growth of fungal strains increased with increasing plant extract concentration, with the highest inhibitory rate at the 30% extract concentration. In addition, spore density, spore germination, and total biomass decreased significantly with increasing extract concentration. The three fungal pathogens differed in their inhibition and their response to these plant extracts. Prosopis juliflora had the highest inhibitory effect on the three fungal pathogens, compared to the extracts from the other two invasive plants. The results of this feasibility study indicate that P. juliflora extracts have high antifungal activity and follow-up in vivo assays should be conducted to determine their efficacy in the safe and sustainable management of these and other fungal pathogens. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Erosion, pollution and vegetation loss are some of the negative effects of alluvial gold exploitation. One of the biotechnological strategies currently used to reduce the impact of this practice is restoration by means of plant growth-promoting microorganisms. The main purpose of this study was to determine the growth and adaptation of Leucaena leucocephala in soils degraded by alluvial gold in Istmina, Chocó (Colombia), through inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense, Mortierella sp. and Rhizoglomus fasciculatum. Under greenhouse conditions, simple and combined inoculations were carried out in bags containing 15-day-old seedlings. The following variables were taken into consideration: height, dry mass of the aerial part, radical dry mass, foliar phosphorus and mycorrhizal colonization. The results showed that there was a significant promotion (P<0.05) in shoot and root dry weight and foliar P concentration with single and dual inoculations of R. fasciculatum with A. brasilense and Mortierella sp. with A. brasilense, with respect to the control. The triple inoculation did not present better results than those achieved with the dual inoculations. These results show that the inoculation of these microorganisms individually and/or combined has a beneficial effect on the nutrition and growth of Leucaena, so this practice is recommended to increase its development and establishment in restoration programs for soils affected by alluvial gold mining. © 2022 Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - The present study was conducted to determine the effects of the replacement of fishmeal with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit leaf meal (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) on fish growth and to compare the cost-effectiveness of replacement of fishmeal with Leucaena leaf meal in fish diets. The proximate value of the tested leaf meal showed moderate contents of crude protein and low contents of crude ash. The daily and mean weight gains of fish showed that the highest weight gains were recorded in fish fed with diet T3 (20%), while the least values were in fish fed with diet T4 (30%), and the differences were not significant (P>0.05). The highest survival rate was observed in fish fed with diet T1 (0%), while fish fed with T2 (10%) and T4 had the lowest values. The highest specific growth rate was obtained in diet T1. However, the highest food conversion ratio was recorded in fish fed with diet T4. The highest expenditure was recorded in diet T1. Our findings showed that using Leucaena leaf meal in the fish diet is best at a 20% inclusion level for optimum growth. Leucaena-containing diets were more cost-effective than a diet with only fishmeal. © 2022, Smujo International. All rights reserved.

TI  - Augmenting Leucaena leucocephala biomass with mineral fertiliser on rainwater use efficiency, agronomic efficiency and yields on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [(L.) Moench]) under rainwater harvesting techniques in semi-arid region of Zimbabwe
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133667381&doi=10.1016%2fj.heliyon.2022.e09826&partnerID=40&md5=a4819da7c0083cdbf3d1ee8e06a14ffc
AB  - Food security in semi-arid regions is threatened by declining soil fertility, soil moisture stress and long frequent droughts as a result of erratic rainfall. Therefore we assessed the effects of augmenting Leucaena leucocephala biomass (organic manure) with mineral fertiliser on rainwater use efficiency, agronomic efficiency, grain and stover yields for two sorghum varieties (Macia and SV1) under rainwater harvesting techniques. The experiment was laid in split-split plot arrangement with rainwater harvesting method as main plot factor, with Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser as subplot factor and sorghum variety as sub-sub plot factor over three cropping seasons. Data collected include rainwater use efficiency, agronomic efficiency, grain and stover yields. Results show that tied contours have significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher grain and stover yields from all varieties and seasons. Irregardless of sorghum variety, tied contours had significant (p ≤ 0.05) sorghum grain and stover yield followed by infiltration pits and lastly standard contours. Grain and stover yields improved with increasing levels of Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser combination. Highest grain yields observed were 1.146 t ha−1 (Macia) and 1.1 t ha−1 (SV1) from tied contour +15 t ha−1 biomass +150 kg ha−1 NPK fertiliser treatments. Rainwater use efficiency was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher from tied contours compared to infiltration pits and standard contour. Rainwater use efficiency was statistically (p ≤ 0.05) influenced by increasing application levels of Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser in all seasons. Agronomic efficiencies were considerably (p ≤ 0.05) affected by rainwater harvesting, Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser and interaction of all factors. It can therefore be concluded that Leucaena biomass + NPK fertiliser, tied contours and infiltration pits improve sorghum yields. Augmenting 2.5 t ha−1 biomass with 25 kg ha−1 NPK fertiliser under tied contours and Macia have better agronomic efficiency. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Measurement of pulpwood traits from a standing tree has considerable advantage when screening large populations for tree selection. It reduces time and also eliminates requirements of transport, powdering, and storing the sample. This study describes estimation of Kraft pulp yield (KPY) in Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. urophylla, Leucaena leucocephala, and Casuarina junghuhniana by portable NIR spectroscopy of standing trees. Calibration models were developed for KPY estimation using portable NIR spectroscopy for the four species, along with a calibration model for syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio in E. camaldulensis. The calibration models for KPY showed R2 values ranging from 0.93 (E. camaldulensis) to 0.83 (L. leucocephala), and 0.95 for S/G ratio. The developed calibration models for E. camaldulensis and L. leucocephala were compared with laboratory NIR models, and a variation of <±2.0% was found between both methods. The models were validated by both external and cross validation which showed <2.0% RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction) and <2.0% RMECV (root mean square error of cross validation) in external and cross validations, respectively. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This study evaluates the effects of the inclusion of two different Leucaena species as a source of condensed tannins based on in vitro fermentation, methane production and post-ruminal protein supply in a diet based on Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman CIAT BR02/1752 grass. Under in vitro conditions, Leucaena leucocephala CIAT 17263 and Leucaena diversifolia ILRI 15551 were incubated in two proportions (25% and 50% w/w) with Cayman grass and with/without polyethylene glycol as a tannin-binder. The results show that substrates with Leucaena diversifolia produced less gas and methane than those with Leucaena leucocephala with and without polyethylene glycol. The mass in undegraded feed + solid associated microbes fraction decreased linearly with increasing level of inclusion of both species of Leucaena, while increasing its nitrogen content. It is concluded that the condensed tannins of Leucaena diversifolia possess the superior activity and that the tannin content of both evaluated Leucaenas did not affect the diet degradation, and reductions in post-ruminal protein did not occur in the present study. Further studies are needed to differentiate the tannins present in different Leucaena species and their dietary effects. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - We evaluated the influence of herbaceous vegetation on the colonization of an invasive and two native tree species in a degraded area located at the Caatinga semiarid forest in Northeastern Brazil. Seedlings of the native trees Anadenanthera colubrina and Astronium urundeuva were planted in nine paired blocks with intact and removed herbaceous vegetation. In addition, seeds of the invasive tree species Leucaena leucocephala were sown in the same paired plots. Growth, germination, establishment, and survival of the tree species were monitored for 8 months. The results showed that herbaceous vegetation hampered native seedling growth in respect to leaf number, leaf size, height, and stem diameter. Conversely, herbaceous vegetation had a neutral effect on the germination, establishment, and growth of the invasive species L. leucocephala. Dominant ruderal herbaceous species strongly prevent the natural succession of native trees in this semiarid forest, while not affecting the establishment of an invasive tree. Management of herbaceous vegetation cover in degraded areas might be a key step for successful restoration in this dryland. © 2021 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - The present investigation was aimed at preparing hydrogels from galactomannans extracted from the defatted seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) (SGM) and κ-carrageenan (кC) in an aqueous phase (pH 6.8) using KCl as ionic crosslinker. The dynamic moduli (G’ and G”) and Power law parameters (n’ and n”) of the hydrogels were optimized through full factorial design (CCD). The optimized hydrogel was prepared with SGM (6.5% w/v) and кC (1% w/v) in the presence of KCl (0.63% w/v) (GA1). A hybrid hydrogel using a combination of SGM and crude arabinoxylan from flaxseed (FX) was also optimized similarly as GA1. The optimized hybrid hydrogel was composed of FX (1% w/w), SGM (5.5% w/v), and кC (1.32% w/v) crosslinked with 0.25% w/v KCl (GAX). GAX showed higher dynamic moduli (G’-2871 Pa, G”-1711 Pa) than GA1 (G’-2589 Pa and G”-1399 Pa) due to the formation of stable interpenetrating polymer network between the hydrogel components. The structural (NMR (1H), FTIR), morphological (SEM), rheological as well as thermal studies confirmed superior characteristics of GAX than GA1. This was also evident from high gel strength (2019 N) and increased firmness (1231 N.s) of GAX. GAX also exhibited 389% water uptake ratio (q) at neutral pH and 45 ℃, and did not show any syneresis for 72 h at 4 ℃. The synergistic amalgamation of a galactomannan from a forest resource and an arabinoxylan from flaxseed processing byproduct not only valorizes them but also enables the development of a self-stable hydrogel that can find far reaching applications in various industrial sectors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Honeybees (Apis mellifera) depend entirely on floral resources (pollen and nectar) in their surrounding landscape to satisfy their dietary needs. Honeybee diets in temperate areas have been well studied, and there is increasing evidence that floral diversity is critical for honeybee health. Tropical forests often contain high floral diversity but honeybee diets have been rarely studied in the tropics. We aim to compare the botanical sources in bee bread between landscapes with and without surrounding forest cover in the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea. We collected bee bread from 24 hives across 8 sites over two years and examined floral sources, diversity measures and major plant groups using DNA metabarcoding. We identified a total of 89 taxa across 34 orders, 41 families, 84 genera and 61 species of botanical sources in bee bread. Bee bread from hives in sites with surrounding forest contained significantly greater species diversity (H’ Forest = 1.4, H’ No forest = 1.1) and species evenness (J Forest = 0.68, J No forest = 0.6). Trees were the most abundant source of bee bread, regardless of landscape, and constituted 52% of total abundance. Herbaceous plants, mostly introduced species, were the second most abundant floral sources at ∼ 26% of total bee bread abundance, particularly in forest landscapes. We found the most abundant sources such as introduced tree species Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) and native tree species Syzigium unipunctatum (Myrtaceae) were foraged on in both landscapes; other common species included introduced species Hylodesmum nudifloram (Facbaceae) and Bidens pilosa (Asteraceae), and native food crop Entada phaseoloides (Fabaceae). Interestingly, many wind pollinated species were found in both landscapes including Araucaria (Araucariaceae), Pinus (Pinaceae), Nothofagaceae species and Poaceae species. Our work suggests that bees are seeking out floral tree resources even in landscapes where trees are scarce. Thus beekeeping in tropical environments would benefit from preserving remaining forest cover and incorporating more trees to existing, open landscapes to optimize the diversity in honeybee diets. © 2021

AB  - Forage cactus responds positively to organic fertilization. However, little is known about the mineralization dynamics of the various sources of existing organic fertilizers. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the release of nutrients from different manure types and the nutrient accumulation in forage cactus across different cropping systems. Different manure sources (cattle, goat, sheep, and broiler litter) were evaluated for the following cropping systems: (i) Gliricidia sepium intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertânia; (ii) Leucaena leucocephala intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertânia; and (iii) Cactus cv. IPA-Sertânia in monoculture, in the tropical semiarid region of Brazil. The rate of decomposition and release of N, P, and K from manure was determined by incubating a litterbag, evaluated in different periods (0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 days). Broiler litter released the greatest amount of N and P. Sheep manure released the greatest amounts of K. The greatest accumulations of N, P, and K in cactus biomass occurred when broiler litter was applied. Cactus monoculture accumulated less N over 256 days, indicating that the presence of tree legumes favors the accumulation of N in cactus. Broiler litter promoted the best synchronism between N release and N uptake in different cropping systems. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Forest is said, an intricate ecosystem of our planet that includes herbs, shrubs, grasses, trees and many more. These plants and various tree species are dominant in forests and have several potential benefits. For instance, overall forests provide all our basic needs like food, fodder, fuel and other variety of products. Food is essential for all humans and other biological organisms as it provides energy and nutrition. Obtaining food from the wild has been closely entwined with mankind for millions of years ago. Forests are principal fodder resources available in the form of livestock for an immensely large cattle population in a country like Brazil, India, China and so on. Additionally, the domestic household sector is the most prominent energy consumer that depends on biofuels, and the rural community quite often depends on the forest. Thus overall, forests and their products play a prime role in the socio-economic development of a country with that it also offers shelter to many livestock populations and livelihood for numerous people. Some of the commonly used food, fodder and fuelwood species are Aegle marmelos, Albizia lebbeck, Azadirachta indica, Bauhinia purpurea, Bauhinia retusa, Bauhinia variegate, Celtis australis, Dalbergia sissoo, Ficus benghalensis, Ficus nemoralis, Ficus roxburghii, Grewia optiva, Leucaena leucocephala, Melia azedarach, Moringa olifera, Morus alba, Ougeinia oojeinensis, Prosopis cineraria, Quercus leucotrichophora, Terminalia alata, Toona ciliate and Zizphyus mauritiana. This chapter specifies some of the wild varieties of edible food, fodder resources and fuelwood species illustrating its description, distribution, nutritional values as well as medicinal importance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - The objective of this study is to understand the characteristics of vegetation communities under different vegetation eco-restoration models (vegetation concrete eco-restoration technique, frame beam filling soil technique, thick layer base material spraying technique, and external soil spray seeding technique). Vegetation coverage, dominant species, species composition, and species diversity of vegetation community under different vegetation eco-restoration modes were analyzed by field survey. The vegetation community of the abandoned slag slope was unstable due to the simple vegetation community structure. The species and number of the thick layer base material spraying slope were low and fail to form a healthy multilayer community structure due to invade of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Studying the allelopathy of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and seeking the best species composition that can coexist with it is significant to promote the positive succession of the vegetation community. The frame beam filling soil technique, external-soil spray seeding technique, and vegetation concrete eco-restoration technique can effectively promote the succession process of the vegetation community and have well water and soil conservation capacity. These findings suggest that artificial vegetation eco-restoration measures can effectively promote vegetation eco-restoration and the positive succession of vegetation community of disturbed slopes. The research results can provide scientific advice for vegetation eco-restoration and subsequent control and management of disturbed slopes in the Xiangjiaba project, and also can be helpful to other similar projects. © 2021 Technoscience Publications.

AB  - The aim of this research was to discover the effect of increasing rumen degradable protein in ruminant diet using Tithonia diversifolia and Leucaena leucocephala on rumen fermentation characteristics, microbial protein synthesis, protozoa population, methane production, and nutrient digestibility. The in vitro method was used in this research in randomized block design with three treatments and five replications. Three diets were formulated containing 50, 55 and 60% rumen degradable proteins (RDP) and were represented as 50, 55 and RDP60. The RDP50 diet contained RDP 50% of crude protein. The 55 and RDP60 diet contained RDP 55 and 60% of crude protein, respectively. The results showed Total Volatile Fatty Acid (100mM vs 98.93mM and 95.60mM) and microbial protein synthesis (88.86mg/100mL vs 84.03mg/100mL and 81.20mg/100mL) were higher in RDP55 diet (P<0.05). Decreasing protozoa population and methane production were observed with increasing RDP in diet (P<0.05). NH3 production (15.30-16.15mM) and protein digestibility (62.52-66.12%) increased with the rising of RDP level (P<0.05). Beside that, higher dry matter (64.56% vs 61.58% and 58.20%), organic matter (66.67% vs 63.89% and 60.69%), crude fiber (65.37% vs 62.07% and 60.78%), and nitrogen-free extract (66.45% vs 62.87% and 60.57%) digestibility were observed in RDP55 diet (P<0.05). Our study revealed that diet containing RDP 55% of crude protein in ruminant feed using T. diversifolia and L. leucocephala improved rumen fermentation characteristics and nutrient digestibility. Further research is needed to discover the effect of the in vivo feeding trial on animals. © 2022, Unique Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

TI  - Feeding strategies to increase nitrogen retention and improve rumen fermentation and rumen microbial population in beef steers fed with tropical forages
PY  - 2021

AB  - The effect of the inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala and Tithonia diversifolia in Zebu steers receiving a diet based on improved pastures such as Brachiaria decumbens and Brachiaria hybrid cv Cayman on nitrogen (N) excretion, urinary volume and rumen microbial population was evaluated. To determine the dry matter intake and nutrient excretion, eight steers were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design consisting of four periods and four diets. Four of them were cannulated for ruminal fluid extraction and quantification of ruminal microorganisms in three times of grazing (T0, T7 and T15). Forage intake was calculated through the external marker titanium dioxide. Diet including forages with superior protein content generated an increase in the gene copy numbers of Prevotella ruminicola and total bacteria on 15 sampling day (p < 0.001). Animals receiving diets with the dietary inclusion of Leucaena and Tithonia had daily N intakes of 228 and 113.5g N intake d−1, of which they excreted 42% and 61%, respectively. Inclusion of both protein forages increased daily urinary volume (9% and 7% d−1), with respect to the pasture-based diet. This study revealed that the inclusion of 18% Leucaena in a pasture-based diet improves the dry matter intake and N retention in Zebu steers under tropical conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Effects of biological nitrification inhibitors on nitrogen use efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural soils: A review
PY  - 2021

AB  - To maintain and increase crop yields, large amounts of nitrogen fertilizers have been applied to farmland. However, the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of chemical fertilizer remains very low, which may lead to serious environmental problems, including nitrate pollution, air quality degradation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Nitrification inhibitors can alleviate nitrogen loss by inhibiting nitrification; thus, biological nitrification inhibition by plants has gradually attracted increasing attention due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. Research progress on BNI is reviewed in this article, including the source, mechanisms, influencing factors and application of BNIs. In addition, the impact of BNI on agriculture and GHG emissions is summarized from the perspective of agricultural production and environmental protection, and the key future research prospects of BNIs are also noted. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The nutritive value of the Leucaena leucocephala (L. leucocephala) plant and its interesting physicochemical characteristics make them useful for a plethora of applications, including food and medicine. According to previous studies, the analysis of the different parts of this plant shows that they are rich sources of proteins, tannin, carotene, leucenol, and flavonol glycosides, and other components which play an important role in the potential uses of this plant. Recently, the application of seed powder of L. leucocephala in treat synthetic turbid water and its use as soil fertility improvement has been reported. This chapter explores the physicochemical features of L. leucocephala and the adsorbent derived from this biomass to study them toward removing heavy metals and metalloids from aqueous solutions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background. There is a concern among poultry meat consumers due to broiler conditions during rearing period in commercial production systems. Consumers trust the organic and free-range poultry production systems because they suppose are more suitable and natural, giving high nutritive value and low-fat content to the meat, improving also the chicken welfare. Objetive. Two studies evaluated the effect of an outdoor access on ethological behavior, health indicators and productive performance of Hubbard broilers in the rearing period. Methodology. The first experiment evaluated outdoor access system in spring (april to may), and the second one was implemented in summer (june to august). In both studies included two groups: a) chickens with outdoot access (OA) and b) chickens at indoor rearing only (WOA). In the first experiment, ethological behaviors (EB) were described; forage intake (Fo), feed intake (FI), live weight gain (LWG) and carcass characteristics (Cc) were measured, blood components (BC), total immunoglobulins (Ig) and parasite eggs counts in excreta (Pc) were also determined, besides microscopic gut lesions in chickens (ML) were evaluated. In the second experiment, live weight gain (LWG), feed intake (FI) and forage intake (Fo) were measured, also carcass characteristics (Cc) were determinated. Analysis of variance by one way ANOVA was performed. Results. In first experiment, it was found that OA and WOA chickens stayed the most time resting. However, inside and outside, moving and foraging behaviors were observed in OA, while in WOA treatment foraging of chickens was the less frequent conduct. WOA showed higher final live weight and FI, but there were no differences in LWG and feed conversion in comparison with OA. Gizzard and caeca weights were heavier in OA treatment. No differences in both carcass yield and abdominal fat were found. At the last two weeks of age the forage intake amount per bird was 1.93 + 0.97 g and 2.06 + 0.87 g of DM/d of Leucaena leucocephala and Pennisetum purpureum, respectively. OA chickens had fewer leukocytes number (lymphocytes, eosinophils) and total inmmunoglobulins, but more heterophils and blood hemoglobulin. No differences between treatments in Eimeria oocysts in excreta were found. However, higher distribution and severity in microscopic gut lesions in birds WAO treatment were found. While in second experiment it was found that both OA and WAO broilers had similar final weight, feed intake, carcass yield and abdominal fat, but OA chickens had a trend to be higher in both weight gain and better feed convertion. Likewise, AO and WAO broilers had similar tibial ash content. Also, AO broilers consumed 0.50 + 0.36; 0.49 + 0.50 and 0.60 + 0.32 g of DM/d of Leucaena leucocephala, Brosimum alicastrum and Moringa oleifera, respectivily. Implications. It is basic to have the knowledge regarding poultry production with outdoor access in tropical conditions. Conclusions. Outdoor access stimulated natural behaviours expression and did not affect productive performance. Also, AO did not produce hematological changes or severe microscopic lesions. © 2022 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fusarium oxysporum is a serious pathogen that causes severe wilt disease in commercial nurseries of Acacia mangium in South Sumatra, Indonesia. This study aimed to investigate the host range of F. oxysporum as a nursery wilt pathogen in A. mangium and several forests and industrial plants. Three isolates of F. oxysporum with ) sequences were tested for pathogenicity on different Fabaceae family plants and theadifferent translation elongation factor (tef 1- growth of population was also observed. The results showed that all three isolates were able to infect all the tested plants with different reactions to wilt disease. Acacia crassicarpa and Falcataria moluccana were highly susceptible; Archidendron pauciflorum, Leucaena leucocephala, and Parkia speciosa were moderately vulnerable and Acacia auriculiformis was moderately resistant. The pathogen population in A. crassicarpa and F. moluccana grew rapidly along with the increase in disease scores, while in L. leucocephala it was moderate, and slow in A. pauciflorum, P. speciosa and A. auriculiformis plants. In conclusion, F. oxysporum pathogen, which was isolated from A. mangium, has a wide range of hosts in the Fabaceae family. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scarcity of freshwater resources for agricultural purposes is a crucial problem in arid and semi-arid regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Moringa seed powder on wastewater quality parameters and examine the responses of Leucaena leucocephala seedlings irrigated with Moringa-treated wastewater. Moringa seed powder was used for different wastewater types (gray, primary-, and tertiary-treated wastewater). Wastewaters were treated with Moringa seed powder using the following concentrations: 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/L. The analyses of wastewaters before and after treatment with Moringa seed powder were conducted, and its impact on seed germination and seedling growth of Leucaena leucocephala was investigated using Moringa-treated wastewater. Our results revealed that Moringa seed powder decreased pH and increased electrical conductivity, phosphate, nitrate, and ionic abundance of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium in the treated wastewater as Moringa seed powder concentration increases. Both germination rate index and percentages were not significantly different for treated wastewater as compared to control. However, the treatment showed the highest percentage at 0.8 g (95%) using M. oleifera compared to 0.2 g (86.3%) with M. peregrina. On the other hand, seedling characteristics of Leucaena leucocephala improved for both treatments. Shoot heights and root lengths were the highest at concentrations 0.2 g (10.48 and 7.28 cm, respectively) and 0.8 g (10.51 and 7.22 cm, respectively) for both M. peregrina and M. oleifera. Finally, Moringa seed powder improved the plant productivity using M. oleifera, while slight decline in plant height with M. peregrine was shown compared to control. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Lamtoro tempeh is a fermented food in Java, made from lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) seeds. Its extended fermentation creates a unique flavor and taste that can be used as a seasoning. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the chemical (moisture, ash, soluble protein, and amino acids contents) and sensory characteristics (brownish color, ammonia aroma, umami taste, and overall acceptability) of lamtoro tempeh from Gunungkidul, Yogyakarta, during extended fermentation for up to 120 hours. The chemical and sensory characteristics were analyzed every 12 and 24 hours respectively. From multiple comparison tests, tempeh with the longest fermentation had the strongest sensory characteristics. Other results showed that extended fermentation increased moisture content up to the highest amount of 74.6% (wb) at 96 hours and 3.55% ash content (db) at 60 hours, as well as soluble protein from 3.02% to 22.62% (db) at the end. Moreover, glutamic acid decreased during fermentation and aspartic acid had the highest amount afterwards. Investigating microbial changes in the food's unique characteristics during this process is required.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Globally, biological invasions are considered as one of the major contributing factors for the loss of indigenous biological diversity. Hyperspectral remote sensing plays an important role in the detection and mapping of invasive plant species. The main objective of this study was to discriminate invasive plant species from adjacent native species using a ground-based hyperspectral sensor in two protected areas, Lehri Reserve Forest and Jindi Reserve Forest in Punjab, Pakistan. Field spectral measurements were collected using an ASD FieldSpec handheld2™ spectroradiometer (325–1075 nm) and the discrimination between native and invasive plant species was evaluated statistically using hyperspectral indices as well as leaf wavelength spectra. Finally, spectral separability was calculated using Jeffries Matusita distance index, based on selected wavebands. The results reveal that there were statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the different spectral indices of most of the plant species in the forests. However, the red-edge parameters showed the highest potential (p < 0.001) to discriminate different plant species. With leaf spectral signatures, the mean reflectance between all plant species was significantly different (p < 0.05) at 562 (75%) wavelength bands. Among pairwise comparisons, invasive Leucaena leucocephala showed the best discriminating ability, with Dodonaea viscosa having 505 significant wavebands showing variations between them. Jeffries Matusita distance analysis revealed that band combinations of the red-edge region (725, 726 nm) showed the best spectral separability (85%) for all species. Our findings suggest that it is possible to identify and discriminate invasive species through field spectroscopy for their future monitoring and management. However, the upscaling of hyperspectral measurements to airborne and satellite sensors can provide a reliable estimation of invasion through mapping inside the protected areas and can help to conserve biodiversity and environmental ecosystems in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Water contamination that caused by heavy metals is a very common phenomenon in the industrial age. One of the popular way to treat metal contaminated water is by adsorption process using activated carbon as the adsorbent. This paper works on producing activated carbon by chemical means with impregnation ratios of NaOH:char (w/w) was predetermined at 1:1 (ACT1-1), 2:1 (ACT2-1) and 3:1 (ACT3-1) under activation temperature of 700°C. Considering the Leucaena leucocephala is a wildly, easy and fast grown species, with the availability throught the year, it was chosen to be used as the precursor. The properties of these activated carbons and its potential for cadmium removal from aqueus solution was analyzed. It was found that the highest surface area was recorded at 662.76 m /g. Four parameters were studied which are contact time, the effect of pH, initial concentration of adsorbate and temperature. The equilibrium time was achieved in 40 min treatment at initial concentrations of 30 mg/l. The adsorbent exhibited good sorption potential for cadmium at pH 8.0 and equilibrium temperature of 30°C. Based on the results, this study had proved that activated carbon from Leucaena leucocephala biomass have the good potential to be used for removal of cadmium from wastewater. © 2022 Polish Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Effect of tannins from tropical plants on methane production from ruminants: A systematic review

AB  - Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas generated during the feed fermentation processes in the rumen. However, numerous studies have been conducted to determine the capacity of plant secondary metabolites to enhance ruminal fermentation and decrease CH4 production, especially those plants rich in tannins. This review conducted a descriptive analysis and meta-analysis of the use of tannin-rich plants in tropical regions to mitigate CH4 production from livestock. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of tannins supplementation in tropical plants on CH4 production in ruminants using a meta-analytic approach and the effect on microbial population. Sources of heterogeneity were explored using a meta-regression analysis. Final database was integrated by a total of 14 trials. The ‘meta’ package in R statistical software was used to conduct the meta-analyses. The covariates defined a priori in the current meta-regression were inclusion level, species (sheep, beef cattle, dairy cattle, and cross-bred heifers) and plant. Results showed that supplementation with tropical plants with tannin contents have the greatest effects on CH4 mitigation. A negative relationship was observed between the level of inclusion and CH4 emission (−0.09), which means that the effect of CH4 mitigation is increasing as the level of tannin inclusion is higher. Therefore, less CH4 production will be obtained when supplementing tropical plants in the diet with a high dose of tannins. © 2021

TI  - Mulching on family maize farms in the tropics: A systematic review
PY  - 2022

AB  - Family farms, predominantly reliant on family labour, produce approximately three-quarters of the World's food. Maize (Zea mays) is the world's most produced cereal. Yet in much of the tropics, actual maize yields are far below those attainable with best-bet practices. While any advantage of adding mulch might depend on soil fertility level, mulch quality, amount of rainfall, irrigation, and other factors, no ranking of their importance has been found. Our objectives were to disentangle these influences to assess how mulch affects yields on different fertility soils under different precipitation regimes. We conducted a systematic review in Web of Science, obtaining 50 papers on experiments from the tropics. Fewer trials have been conducted in Asia and Pacific (n = 10) than in Africa (n = 20) or Latin America and the Caribbean (n = 20). Twenty mulches had been tested of which Leucaena leucocephala had been used in 25% of trials. Mulch was more commonly applied after (n = 15) than before (n = 18) sowing or at sowing (n = 14); three trials did not mention application timing. Mulch increased grain yield and biomass. The positive effect of mulch was greater when combined with mineral fertilizer, implying a synergistic rather than a substitutional effect and demonstrating its applicability, even for farmers able to afford inputs. Mulch increased both maize grain yield and total biomass so is recommended as a sustainable practice in general, but particularly on low fertility soils in lower rainfall areas. Future work should model mass loss and nutrient release of different mulch types under different agroecological conditions. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - USING DRONE-BASED THREE-DATE MULTISPECTRAL IMAGES TO CLASSIFY INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES WITH MACHINE LEARNING ALORITHMS
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149443048&partnerID=40&md5=5a214c443ff5d9829f67402457d64e89
AB  - In the past few decades, globalization has caused invasive alien species (IAS) to spread to the world, and IASs have damaged local agriculture and ecosystems. Leucaena leucocephala (white popinac, WP), a world-famous IAS, is chosen as target species. WP can blossom and fructify throughout the year, and its phenology is affected more by precipitation rather than different seasons. Hence, we conducted our field survey to collect in-situ data in dry, rainy, and normal seasons, and also used drone to take three-date multispectral images (five spectral bands). To ensure the data quality, we used centimeter-grade Trimble R12 to measure six ground control points, and the final orthophoto’s resolution is 6 cm, with the positioning error of 2.7 cm. We used logistic multiple regression (LMR), random forest (RF), and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) to classify WP and used F1 score and kappa coefficient to assess model performance. In dry season, reflectance in green and near-infrared (NIR) band are the lowest. When using three seasons separately, the normal season’s accuracy is the highest, F1 score and kappa coefficient of LGBM was 0.91 and 0.87. And by combining three seasons together, the accuracy got improved again. LGBM’s index value was 0.97 and 0.95, showing that combining data from different dates could boost classification accuracy. As for the contribution of different bands in spectrum, NIR band from dry and normal seasons contributed the most. Red band from normal and rain seasons were also important, showing that red and NIR bands are important for classification. In conclusion, this research confirmed that WP’s phenology is affected by precipitation and understanding the effect of dry and rainy seasons can enhance the accuracy of models. By combining data from three seasons, models would provide the highest accuracy, showing that multi-temporal data could boost model performance. © 43rd Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2022.

AB  - Assessing the palatability of forage from locally adapted trees could improve the sustainability of livestock production systems. However, grasses continue to dominate livestock feed across the Amazon. We established a silvopastoral cattle farming system in Peru, comparing three different forage tree species with grass monocultures using a randomised block design. Trees were arranged in alleys of 0.5 x 7.5 m, planted alongside grass, and were directly browsed by cattle. Browse removal was estimated by three methods: Destructive sampling, canopy measurements and leaf counts. We found that all three tree species were palatable to cattle. Plots containing trees and grass produced more available forage (mean > 2.2 Mg ha-1) for cattle than the grass monocultures (mean = 1.5 Mg ha-1). Destructive sampling below 1.6 m demonstrated that cattle consumed 99% of the available Erythrina berteroana forage, 75% of the available Inga edulis forage and 80% of the available Leucaena leucocephala forage in 8 days. This research demonstrates methodologies to estimate the intake of locally adapted browse species by cattle and highlights the potential benefits of silvopastoral systems in the Amazon. Planting trees could also benefit animal health and provide ecosystem services such as soil regeneration, enhanced nutrient cycling and carbon capture. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) is native to Central America and has invaded many climatic regions of the tropics. In South Africa, the species is categorized as an emerging or incipient weed used as fodder, timber, firewood and in erosion control on degraded habitats. The species is common along the eastern subtropical regions of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, where it invades grasslands, savannas and edges of forests. Soils of these ecosystems are characterized as nutrient deficient and acidic. Using a pot trial, we determined the effects of the nutrient addition treatments on microbial symbiosis, N nutrition and biomass accumulation of L. leucocephala under greenhouse conditions. After 180 days of growth, plants were harvested, and their utilization of N derived from the atmosphere and from the soil was quantified through determination of δ15N values. L. leucocephala maintained growth and N nutrition by relying on both atmospheric-and soil-derived N across all soil treatments. The NDFA was significantly higher in high P (N1 + P, N2 + P and N3 + P) soils. L. leucocephala was able to nodulate with intermediate and fast-growing strains from the Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium genus in N2 + P grown plants. This shows that L. leucocephala possesses traits that are successful in acquiring nutrients, especially in nutrient limited conditions, by establishing plant symbiosis with multiple bacteria and relying on extracting N from the soil and from the atmosphere through the symbiosis. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background. Since the beginning of civilization, medicinal plants have been used in human healthcare systems. Studies have been conducted worldwide to evaluate their efficacy, and some of the results have triggered the development of plant-based medications. Rural women in Pakistan frequently experience gynaecological disorders due to malnutrition and heavy physical work during pregnancy. Due to the low economic status, the remoteness of the area, and the lack of modern health services, herbal therapy for gynaecological disorders is common among the indigenous tribes of the study area. Methods. Field surveys were carried out from April 2018 to October 2020 to collect data regarding medicinal plants used for different gynaecological disorders. A semistructured questionnaire was used to collect ethnogynaecological data. Results. In total, 67 medicinal plant species belonging to 38 families are being used to treat 26 different gynaecological problems. The herbaceous growth form and the Lamiaceae family were recorded with the maximum number of plant species (42 species and 7 species, respectively). Leaves are the most highly utilized plant part, with 16 species. In the case preparation method, decoction was the dominant method (25 species, 36.76%). The informants reported the maximum number of species for the treatment of irregular menstrual flow as 11 species (15.28%). The highest relative frequency of citation (RFC) value was obtained for Acacia modesta (0.37), and the use value (UV) for Tecomella undulata (0.85). The highest informants' consensus factor (ICF) value (1.0) was obtained for emmenagogue and tonic each after delivery. The highest consensus index (CI%) value was calculated for Acacia modesta (36.92%). The Lamiaceae had the highest family importance value (FIV) (98.46%). Conclusion. This is the first ever quantitative study focusing mainly on ethnogynaecological study conducted in the tribal areas of North Waziristan which highlights the importance of traditional herbal remedies for their basic medical requirements. The results of this study would serve as a baseline for advanced phytochemical and pharmacological screening, as well as conservationists for further studies.  © 2022 Sabith Rehman et al.

AB  - Research on endosymbionts is emerging globally and is considered as a potential source of bioactive phytochemicals. The present study examines the antioxidant and antidiabetic of the endophytic crude extract isolated from Leucaena leucocephala leaves. Endophytic bacteria were isolated from the leaves of L. leucocephala and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to establish their identity. The in vitro antioxidant effect of endophytic crude extract (LL) was evaluated using 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2′-Azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) free radical scavenging methods. The in vitro antidiabetic properties of LL were evaluated using α-Amylase and α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition assay. The isolated endophytic bacteria were identified as Cronobacter sakazakii. LL displayed potent free radical scavenging effect against ABTS and DPPH radicals with an inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) value of 17.49 ± 0.06 and 11.3 ± 0.1 μg/mL respectively. LL exhibited α-Amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition with an IC50 value of 23.3 ± 0.08 and 23.4 ± 0.1 μg/mL respectively compared to the standard drug (acarbose). Both glucose loaded normoglycemic rats and STZ induced diabetic rats treated with LL (200 mg/kg) exhibited a considerable reduction in blood glucose levels p<0.01 after 8 h of treatment when compared to normal and diabetic control rats respectively. Thus, the study shows that LL has a wellspring of natural source of antioxidants, and antidiabetic agents and phytoconstituents present in endophytes could be the rich source for bioactive compounds. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - The objective of this investigation was to study the physical, tecno-functional, chemical, and thermal properties of the Leucaena leucocephala seed. The physical properties revealed that the pod had an average weight of 2.14 g, a length of 13.67 cm, and an average of 20 seeds per pod. The seed had an average weight of 0.07 g with a volume of 30.02%. The sphericity was 52.14%, ovoid in shape, and presented with an apparent density and real density of 0.81 and 0.68 g/cm3, respectively, and a porosity of 15.64%. The seed had a green hue, whereas the flour had a light brown hue. The seed presented with a high-fat content of 31.78 g/100 g, protein of 26.56 g/100 g, and fiber of 15.49 g/100 g. The flour showed a water absorption capacity of 4.64 g/g, water solubility capacity of 16.20%, water activity of 0.35, oil absorption capacity of 2.03 g/g, and emulsifying capacity of 48.06%. It also showed foam formation ability (48.06%), gelling capacity (4.00%), swelling power (4.5-5.2%), and a pH of 6.7. The thermal properties showed the presence of three endodermic peaks, indicating the presence of protein-amylose and lipid-amylose interactions, in addition to the gelatinization temperature of the starch present in the flour. © 2022, Sociedade Brasileira de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Alimentos, SBCTA.

TI  - Potential toxic effects produced by L-mimosine in the thyroid and reproductive systems. Evaluation in male rats
PY  - 2021

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a worldwide plant used as forage; however, its use in animal production has been limited because of the presence of a toxic nonprotein amino acid, L-mimosine. L-mimosine exhibits negative effects not only in ruminants but also in monogastric animals; however, there is little information available on the effect of this amino acid in monogastric species. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the general toxicity of L-mimosine in rats, as well as its effects on the endocrine and reproductive systems. L-mimosine was extracted from seeds of L. leucocephala that were administered orally by gavage to adult Wistar rats at different doses of 25, 40 and 60 mg/kg body weight/day for 28 days. The following parameters were evaluated: weight gain, feed intake, serum enzymes, histopathology (liver, kidney, thyroid, thymus, and spleen), serum hormones (testosterone, corticosterone, T3 and T4) and sexual behavior. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed in animals, but histopathology revealed consistent lesions in the thyroids. Additionally, rats exposed to L-mimosine presented low serum levels of testosterone, decreased mount numbers and increased mount intervals. Therefore, our study reinforces the assumption that L-mimosine has goitrogenic potential and causes impairment in male reproductive performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anthropogenic actions have caused soil degradation and revegetation is a way to recover degraded soils. However, salt-affected soils require the use of suitable species to extract salts from the soil. This study investigated the growth of shrub and tree species in a soil degraded by salts, alone or associated with a phytoextraction salt species, evaluating plant biomass yield and extraction of elements by plants. A field experiment was assembled with eight treatments: 1) Atriplex nummularia Lindl., 2)Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth, 3) Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) Wit, 4) Azadirachta indica A. Juss, 5) A. nummularia + M. caesalpiniifolia, 6) A. nummularia + L. leucocephala and 7) A. nummularia + A. indica; in randomized blocks with four replications. After 30 months of cultivation, plants were collected to measure biomass and concentrations of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, P, and N. A. indica plants had the highest total biomass (10.75 kg plant-1), about 15 times more than M. caesalpiniifolia, both in associated cultivation with A. nummularia. A. nummularia plants extracted more Na and Cl in the dry matter, maximum of 124.70 and 166.79 g plant-1, respectively. The highest production of plant biomass (23.55 t ha-1) and total extraction of elements (1438.51 kg ha-1) were obtained by associated cultivation of A. nummularia and A. indica. Associated cultivation did not decrease the phytoextractor potential of Na and Cl by A. nummularia plants and it can be used to regenerate degraded areas. © This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License

AB  - In tropical and subtropical regions, as well as in the internal and/or marginal Mediterranean areas, one of the most important problems related to animal production is represented by the inadequate nutritional supplies. The low productivity of the animals, often connected to reduced annual growth, is, in fact, not infrequently attributable to the low nitrogen content and the high fiber content of the local plant species and crop residues that constitute the base ingredients of the rations commonly adopted by farmers. The use of the supplementation with arboreal and shrub fodder, although often containing anti-nutritional factors and toxins that limit its use, could be a profitable way to alleviate the nutritional deficiencies of the basic diets. Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit is native to Central America and widely naturalized in the majority of Latin American countries. It is a legume suitable for tropical and subtropical environments including the countries of the Mediterranean area. Moreover, its spread is desirable if we consider the multiple uses to which it is suitable, the considerable amount of biomass produced, and its role in preserving the environment. The aim of this work was to highlight the characteristics of Leucaena that can justify its wide diffusion. A structured analysis of strengths and weaknesses was performed accordingly. Being a good protein source for feeding livestock, it could be a species to be introduced in the inland areas of the Mediterranean countries as an alternative protein source; the limit represented by the presence of anti-nutritional factors could be overcome by feed processing and by launching targeted research programs. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - In vivo anti-inflammatory activity of Fabaceae species extracts screened by a new ex vivo assay using human whole blood
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101476126&doi=10.1002%2fpca.3031&partnerID=40&md5=6cb4291a3089662ea07fc6bd709d3129
AB  - Introduction: Plants have been considered a promising source for discovering new compounds with pharmacological activities. The Fabaceae family comprises a large variety of species that produce substances with diverse therapeutic potential, including anti-inflammatory activity. The limitations of current anti-inflammatories generate the need to research new anti-inflammatory structures with higher efficacy as well as develop methods for screening multiple samples, reliably and ethically, to assess such therapeutic properties. Objective: Validate and apply a quantification method for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production from an ex vivo assay in human blood in order to screen anti-inflammatory activity present in many Fabaceae species extracts. Methods: Human blood was incubated with extracts from 47 Fabaceae species. After lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation, PGE2 was quantified in the plasma by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The extracts that presented PGE2 production inhibition were further assessed through in vivo assay and then chemically characterised through an analysis of ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS2) data. Results: The new ex vivo anti-inflammatory assay showed that five out of the 47 Fabaceae species inhibited PGE2 production. Results from an in vivo assay and the metabolic profile of the active extracts supported the anti-inflammatory potential of four species. Conclusion: The quantification method for PGE2 demonstrated fast, sensitive, precise, and accurate results. The new ex vivo anti-inflammatory assay comprised a great, reliable, and ethical approach for the screening of a large number of samples before an in vivo bioassay. Additionally, the four active extracts in both ex vivo and in vivo assays may be useful for the development of more efficient anti-inflammatory drugs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Soil seed bank characteristics along a gradient of past human disturbances in a tropical semi-deciduous forest: Insights for forest management
PY  - 2022

AB  - The soil seed bank (SSB) in forests is a key indicator of their resilience after disturbances. Despite the growing interest in describing patterns of SSB and understanding potential processes underpinning those patterns, we still know little about SSB patterns and drivers in semi-deciduous tropical forests. Using the regeneration emergence method, we assessed the patterns of SSB (i) across four vegetation types with variable intensity of past human disturbances: typical dense forest - degraded dense forest - young preforest fallow - old preforest fallow, and (ii) in relationships to soil depth (0–5 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–15 cm, 15–20 cm) in a protected tropical semi-deciduous dense forest in Benin, West-Africa. The standing vegetation (adults and regeneration) data and soil samples were collected using a systematic sampling of 60 plots of 10 m × 10 m in the four vegetation types. Herbaceous plants dominated (67% − 78%) the SSB. From the SSB, five tree species emerged: Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn., Dialium guineense Willd., Ficus sur Forssk., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit, and Lonchocarpus sericeus (Poir.) Kunth. Regarding tree species, the total densities of germinated seeds (seeds.m−2) were higher in typical dense forest (28.00 ± 7.22) and young preforest fallow (16.67 ± 7.07) than in old preforest fallow (10.00 ± 6.75) and degraded dense forest (8.89 ± 3.81). When only tree species were considered, the SSB was more diverse and dense in typical dense forest than in other vegetation types suggesting negative effect of past human disturbances on SSB. The similarity of the species composition between the SSB and the surrounding vegetation was low (Jaccard's similarity index ranged from 0 to 17.64%, indicating that the majority of tree species in the surrounding vegetation were absent in the SSB. This study highlighted a need of planting effort of native tree species to restore degraded areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecosystem services offered by two native tree species viz. Azadirachta indica, Morinda tinctoria, and four exotic species viz. Tamarindus indica, Prosopis juliflora, Leucaena leucocephala, and Ipomoea carnea in the Mathippanur village of Madurai district, Tamil Nadu, India were assessed to augment their valuable ecosystem services and to get the management strategy for sustainable use. The selected plant species provide economic benefit through their products, regulating soil health, sequestering carbon, and supporting nests of animals. However, they cause discomfort to the associated vegetation and human beings. Both native and exotic species play a crucial role in the ecosystem and the removal of exotic species will lead to disturbance in the ecosystem resilience. For sustainable management, mixed plantations of tree species can be raised in barren and fallow lands. The plantations will aid in monetary support to the local inhabitants, people's participation in resource management and conservation, and effective use of land and tree services. © 2021 Technoscience Publications.

AB  - Plant growth regulators play a key role in cell wall structure and chemistry of woody plants. Understanding of these regulatory signals is important in advanced research on wood quality improvement in trees. The present study is aimed to investigate the influence of exogenous application of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) and brassinosteroid inhibitor, brassinazole (BRZ) on wood formation and spatial distribution of cell wall polymers in the xylem tissue of Leucaena leucocephala using light and immuno electron microscopy methods. Brassinazole caused a decrease in cambial activity, xylem differentiation, length and width of fibres, vessel element width and radial extent of xylem suggesting brassinosteroid inhibition has a concomitant impact on cell elongation, expansion and secondary wall deposition. Histochemical studies of 24-epibrassinolide treated plants showed an increase in syringyl lignin content in the xylem cell walls. Fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies revealed the inhomogenous pattern of lignin distribution in the cell corners and middle lamellae region of BRZ treated plants. Immunolocalization studies using LM10 and LM 11 antibodies have shown a drastic change in the micro-distribution pattern of less substituted and highly substituted xylans in the xylem fibres of plants treated with EBR and BRZ. In conclusion, present study demonstrates an important role of brassinosteroid in plant development through regulating xylogenesis and cell wall chemistry in higher plants. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of Leucaena leucocephala and corn oil supplemented to diet on in vitro ruminal and post-ruminal nutrient degradation using a two-stage in vitro technique. The four dietary treatments consisted of Pennisetum purpureum and concentrate in a 75:25 ratio with increasing levels of L. leucocephala (L0= 0%, L25= 25%, L50= 50%, and L75= 75%, DM basis) with three levels of corn oil (CO) (CO1= 0%, CO2= 1%, and CO3= 2% of the substrate) resulting in 12 treatment combinations that were randomly assigned to a 4×3 factorial design. The L75 and CO3 treatment decreased ruminal and total dry matter and organic matter degradation (p<0.001). Leucaena supplementation also increased ruminal and post ruminal protein degradation (rdN and pdN) while CO decreased the rdN and the pdN. To conclude, inclusion of Leucaena to the diet by 50% improved nutrients degradation, particularly ruminal and post-ruminal N degradation, while CO at 1% level negatively affected nutrient degradation in the rumen. © 2021, Prince of Songkla University.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the optimum inclusion levels of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal on growth, haematology, and physiological performance of pigs. A total of 16 grower pigs comprising of 12 females and 4 castrated males weighing an average of 13.5 kg were assigned into a completely randomized experimental layout, subjected to 4 inclusion levels of leaf meal (0, 50, 100, and 150 g/kg DM). Regression model and one-way ANOVA model were used to analyse the data. The total feed intake (TFI) and average weekly feed intake (AWFI) were significantly affected quadratically (P < 0.05) by increased inclusion levels, while tubular diameter (TD) and epithelial cell thickness (ECT) of the thyroid gland were not significantly (P > 0.05) affected quadratically. However, a significant difference due to inclusion levels on TD and ECT was established due to one-way ANOVA. Optimal inclusion levels of 70.5 g/kg for TFI and 70.0 g/kg for AWFI were significantly established with 99% regression coefficient. This implies that the quantity of Leucaena leaf meal intake continued increasing up to 70.50 g/kg inclusion levels before it started reducing; hence, the optimal inclusion levels of Leucaena for best feed intake is at 70.5 g/kg at which point all other parameters of growth, haematology, and physiological parameters were not significantly affected. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This research is part of knowledge management and value-added transmission of goat production for sustainable career promotion and community food security. The objective of this study was to investigate how fresh leucaena and the effect of different sources of leucaena on growth performance and meat quality in indigenous Anglo-Nubian hybrid goats ale after weaning, with an average weight starting at approximately 15 kg, were divided into 5 groups of 4 with 4 repetitions each. The research was allotted in five into five groups of four repeats each. Treatment 1 received pangola grass as a crude feed source, treatment 2 received leucaena as a 25% feed substitute, treatment 3 received leucaena as a crude feed substitute at level 50%, treatment 4 received leucaena as a feed substitute at level 75, and treatment 5 received leucaena as a 100% coarse feed substitute. Leucaena was able to raise goats at a rate of 75-100%. The average daily gain, feed cost per gain of 1 kg, and blood-urea-nitrogen (BUN) values after 4 hours of feeding were the best and higher than the BUN values of the other groups. The difference in values was statistically significant. (P<0.05), and use in percentages 50-100 did not affect the final weight, total weight gain, dry matter content, protein intake, total feed conversion ratio (FCR), dry matter intake (DMI) to percentage body weight (BW), feed cost per gain, economic loss index, production performance index, salable head return, carcass characteristics, quality and chemical composition of meat, or meat acceptance according to research results.

AB  - Aim of study: To investigate the effect of feeding foliage of leguminous trees on growth rate, semen characteristics, and sexual behavior of bucks. Area of study: Northeastern Mexico. Material and methods: Twenty-two young goat bucks were randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups: 33% alfalfa hay (dry matter basis), 33%; Acacia farnesiana; Leucaena leucocephala; or Prosopis laevigata foliage (n=4 for alfalfa; n=6 for the rest of groups). Main results: Average daily gain (ADG) did not differ between bucks fed alfalfa, A. farnesiana, or L. leucocephala (120 ± 26, 134 ± 37, and 103 ± 29 g/d, respectively), but ADG of bucks offered P. laevigata was the lowest (72 ± 8 g; p<0.05). Bucks fed alfalfa had the highest feed efficiency (6.59 ± 1.25 kg of feed consumed/kg of gain; p<0.05) and bucks offered leguminous trees had the lowest (average 9.85 ± 2.3). Bucks offered alfalfa, and A. farnesiana had increased (p<0.05) scrotal circumference (26.6 ± 0.4 and 25.8 ± 1.5 cm) than bucks fed L. leucocephala, or P. laevigata (24.3 ± 1.2 and 24.1 ± 2.0 cm). Mean ejaculate volume was two-fold higher in alfalfa-fed bucks than all other dietary treatments. Sexual behavior did not differ among bucks fed the different legumes. Research highlights: Foliage of both A. farnesiana and L. leucocephala could totally replace alfalfa hay for rearing growing goat bucks in confinement without affecting daily weight gain, most semen characteristics, and copulation ability. P. laevigata reduced body weight and reproductive function. © 2021 INIA.

AB  - In Ghana, many soils are heavily contaminated with mercury (Hg) that is used in the amalgamation process of gold. This pollution has drastic effects not only on the environment but also on humans through direct exposure in areas close to illegal gold mining sites and consumption of contaminated food crops that are cultivated on those soils. Consequently, the objective of this study was to identify suitable plant species for phytoremediation of Hg-contaminated soils and to return the land to agricultural use for food production. Plants growing on Hg-contaminated sites need to possess some level of tolerance to Hg-toxicity in order to survive. It is postulated that Hg-tolerance of plants is due to a restricted Hg-uptake and/or translocation brought about for example by Hg-sequestration in certain cell compartments or by organic compounds. Consequently, native legumes, which grow near Hg-contaminated sites in Ghana, are presumed tolerant to Hg and improve the fertility of the degraded soils due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. The plant species that are currently evaluated for Hg-uptake efficiency in pot experiments under greenhouse conditions are Acacia mangium, Brassica juncea, Leucaena leucocephala, Mimosa pudica, Moringa oleifera and Senna siamea. Brassica juncea plant is a known metal-accumulating wild-type plant and serves as a positive control. Hg was provided at two concentrations (5, 10 mg kg-1) as mercury chloride (HgCl2) solution. To evaluate physiological reactions of the plant species to mercury exposure gas exchange (H2O and CO2) of all experimental plants was measured in order to determine assimilation. Plants which can accumulate high concentrations of mercury with a high tolerance level to Hg without visible or physiological phytotoxicity symptoms will be selected for further experiments in phytoremediation of Hg-contaminated soils in Ghana. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - Head and neck cancer (HNC) usually arises from squamous cells of the upper aerodigestive tract that line the mucosal surface in the head and neck region. In India, HNC is common in males, and it is the sixth most common cancer globally. Conventionally, HNC attributes to the use of alcohol or chewing tobacco. Over the past four decades, portions of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive HNC are increasing at an alarming rate. Identification based on the etiological factors and molecular signatures demonstrates that these neoplastic lesions belong to a distinct category that differs in pathological characteristics and therapeutic response. Slow development in HNC therapeutics has resulted in a low 5-year survival rate in the last two decades. Interestingly, HPV-positive HNC has shown better outcomes following conservative treatments and immunotherapies. This raises demand to have a pre-therapy assessment of HPV status to decide the treatment strategy. Moreover, there is no HPV-specific treatment for HPV-positive HNC patients. Accumulating evidence suggests that phytochemicals are promising leads against HNC and show potential as adjuvants to chemoradiotherapy in HNC. However, only a few of these phytochemicals target HPV. The aim of the present article was to collate data on various leading phytochemicals that have shown promising results in the prevention and treatment of HNC in general and HPV-driven HNC. The review explores the possibility of using these leads against HPV-positive tumors as some of the signaling pathways are common. The review also addresses various challenges in the field that prevent their use in clinical settings. © Copyright © 2021 Aggarwal, Yadav, Chhakara, Janjua, Tripathi, Chaudhary, Chhokar, Thakur, Singh and Bharti.

AB  - In an urban residential complex, in addition to providing environmental services, trees also attract wild birds. The objective of this research was to identify trees planted in tropical urban residential areas that can attract wild birds. The research was conducted in Sentul City Residential Complex, Bogor, West Java, by observing wild birds that visit certain trees as part of their habitat components. Trees provide nectar, fruits, seeds, and insects as food for birds and nest materials. Trees also have important functions as birds' cover and nesting sites. There were 103 tree species, all basically supporting the life of 51 bird species found in the study area. Examples of nectar producer trees were Spathodea campanulata, Callistemon citrinus, Erythrina crista-galli; fruit producers were Muntingia calabura, Syzygium polyanthum, Ficus benjamina; seeds producers were Leucaena leucocephala, Paraserianthes falcataria. Many trees also attracted insects for bird food, including Acacia mangium, Samanea saman. Conifers and small twigs and leaf petioles/rachis of many legumes, for example, Delonix regia, Calliandra calothyrsus) can be used as nest materials. Careful selection of trees could attract many wild birds to increase the environmental quality of the residential areas.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Climate change is a major issue across the globe. Therefore, carbon (C) assimilation and storage is the key management strategy for mitigating climate change. The present investigation was carried out in two riparian sites i.e., Maini and Machhli river of northern Chhattisgarh, India, through stratified random sampling. Results reveal that vegetation beside Maini river was represented by 22 species of tree, 17 species of saplings, 12 species of seedlings, 5 shrub species and 15 herb species and total density value was 1410–460,000 individuals/ha. The vegetation in Machhli river was represented by 14 species of tree, 15 species of sapling, 14 species of seedling, 10 shrub and herb species each and the total density value was 830–440,000 individuals/ha. The diversity indices were higher for tree and herb layer in Maini river while in Machhli river the diversity indices value were higher for sapling, seedling and shrub layer. Terminalia arjuna, Shorea robusta and Mangifera indica contributed maximum total biomass (58.23%) at Maini river. In Machhli river, 73% of total biomass was contributed by Terminalia arjuna, Leucana leucocephala and Ficus heterophylla. Higher biomass accumulation, C stock and CO2 mitigation were found in 30–50 cm girth class in both sites. The total C stock and CO2 mitigation ranged between 60.54–77.58 t/ha and 222.10–284.84 t/ha for both the sites, respectively. Results reveal significant contribution of riparian vegetation towards biomass accumulation, C storage and CO2 mitigation. Such study under tropical condition would help to formulate policy towards restoring degraded riparian vegetation and combating climate change. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This research aimed to develop a Bali cattle farming system in Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) with Lamtoro Taramba feed's main base. The research was conducted in the Raknamo farmer group, Kupang Regency, Nusa Tenggara Timur. The livestock used in this study were 8 (eight) Bali cattle, age 12-15 months, with an average initial body weight of 134.38 - 146,63 kg. The observation activity was to collect data on Bali cattle's body weight, which were given the main feed of Lamtoro Taramba for three months and always feed available in cattle-shed, then calculated the daily body weight gain. The research results showed that Bali cattle's average body weight from the first month of observation is 134.38 kg, the second month is 140,69 kg, the third month is 146,63 kg. The results of the research showed for the daily bodyweight gain from the first to second month (ADG 1) was 0.18 kg/day, the third month increased (ADG 2) by 0.19 kg/day; the statistical data was significant (P < 0.05). So, the daily body weight gain of Bali cattle increases with Lamtoro Taramba main feed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The abundant availability of Leucaena leucocephala (petai belalang) in Malaysia was one of the contributing factors of this research. The phytochemicals obtained from this plant will contribute towards many fields mainly medicine and it becomes more favorable as compared to the modern medicines used these days. Diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure and diabetes are very crucial, and it occurs frequently among all ages of citizens in Malaysia. Therefore, phytochemicals in this plant can be a great substitute of modern medicines. However, lignin is known to interfere with the cell wall polysaccharides digestion, and hence considered as an anti-quality component in forages. To improve phytochemicals extraction, an effective degradation method of lignin is in demand. Thus, the goal of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of using enzymatic hydrolysis by laccase from Trametes versicolor (LTV) to breakdown lignin using mild reaction condition. To clarify the effect of enzymatic hydrolysis, a preliminary study on the percentage of lignin removal was conducted that taking the effect of LTV concentration, incubation temperature and time into consideration. The results were then used to analyze total flavonoid contents (TFC) of L.leucocephala seed after the extraction by using microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD) method. In view of this, extraction temperature and time were varied. TFC was estimated by UV-VIS spectrophotometer for quantification by using quercetin as standard. The result emerge from this study showed that the TFC was high in the extraction temperature of 60˚C in 12 min with an average of 1639 mgQE/g.d.w and the lowest TFC was recorded at 30˚C with 677 mgQE/g.d.w. Further analysis showed that enzymatic hydrolysis has assisted the extraction of flavonoids, thus, provided scientific method to extract flavonoid as an alternative therapy for various diseases. © 2021, Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

AB  - Cattle fattening using Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) as the source or the main component of the cattle’s diets is one of the proven innovations that can provide financial benefit to cattle farmers. The objective of this study is to evaluate the adoption of Leucaena-based cattle fattening and identify the factors contributing to the adoption and diffusion of these improved practices. A mixed method approach was used to understand the adoption of Leucaena and cattle management by local farmers who participated in the early stage (2017) and those who participated in the later stages of the project (2018– 2020). The study showed that male Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) that were fed Leucaena-based diets grew two times faster than cattle fattened on grasses. This increased live weight gain and, subsequently, faster sales and increased profits. This may account for the rapid adoption and diffusion of Leucaena-based cattle fattening in Dompu through farmer-to-farmer learning, effective facilitation, demonstration trials, and linking farmers to end markets. To sustain the practice change, the project facilitated the development of an agribusiness support center (ASC). Sustaining the ASC requires further efforts that include internalization of the project outcome into the local government program. © 2022 Asian Economic and Social Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of urea and molasses fermented cassava pulp on rumen fermentation, microbial population and microbial protein synthesis in beef cattle
PY  - 2022

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of fermented cassava pulp with urea and molasses on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation and microbial protein synthesis. All brahman crossbred beef cattle were randomly assigned according to a 4 × 4 Latin Square Design to receive four dietary treatments; cassava pulp (control), cassava pulp fermented with urea 4%, cassava pulp fermented with molasses 4%, and cassava pulp fermented with urea 4% and molasses 4%. All animals were fed concentrate pellet at 1.5% BW and supplemented 0.5% BW of cassava pulp. The results showed that rumen NH3-N concentration was increased in cattle fed with both cassava pulp fermented with urea and/or molasses (P < 0.05). The total VFA was not affected by dietary treatments while there was an increase in propionic acid when cattle were supplemented with fermented cassava pulp. However, methane production and protozoal population were lower in treatments with fermented cassava pulp (P < 0.05). Feeding of fermented cassava pulp resulted in an increase in microbial protein synthesis (P < 0.05). Based on the present findings, it could be concluded that fermented cassava pulp with urea and molasses can increase propionic acid, microbial protein synthesis while reducing protozoal population and CH4 production. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This study aimed at energy reduction during pulping of L. leucocephala by passing the wood chips through an impressafiner followed by xylanase pretreatment. An impressafiner compressed the chips and converted them into spongy materials. Wood chips of L. leucocephala with or without de-structuring and de-structured wood chips followed by enzymatic treatment were subjected to Kraft pulping at different temperatures varying from 135 to 170 °C and active alkali varying from 12 to 20% (as Na2O) to observe effect on screened pulp yield and kappa number. The de-structured wood chips followed by enzymatic treatment produced a pulp yield of 48.2% and kappa number 18.6. L. leucocephala without de-structuring produced a pulp yield of 50.1% and kappa number 23.7. When the pulp was subjected to oxygen delignification to reduce kappa number in the vicinity of 18.6, pulp showed shrinkage by 6.64% compared to Kraft pulp of de-structured wood chips followed by enzymatic treatment. Kraft pulp produced from de-structured wood chips of L. leucocephala followed by enzymatic treatment showed net saving of US$ 163.15 per digester over Kraft pulp produced without de-structuring of wood chips of L. leucocephala. Moreover, the pulp obtained by de-structuring followed by enzymatic treatment showed improvement in pulp brightness and physical strength properties including tensile, tear, and burst index significantly compared to pulp obtained without de-structuring. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - The performance of a particleboard seems to be related to the chemical constituents of the species and the size distribution the particles. Neolamarckia cadamba (NC) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL) are fast growing species and good potential resources for particleboard production. This study examined the chemical contents of both species, as well as the mechanical and physical performance of particleboard made with 100% NC, 100% LL, and their 50:50 admixtures. High moisture resistance boards were prepared using melamine urea formaldehyde (MUF) at a content of 10, 12, and 14 %. The 30% extra buffering of LL translated to its lower performance for both mechanical and physical properties. The 50:50 admixtures provided enticing results, as it counteracts the impact of lowered performance of 100% LL. All boards passed the mechanical requirements of the BS EN 312 (2003) standard, but they did not meet the requirement for thickness swelling. The internal bond for cyclic test only failed for 100% LL with 10% resin added. With use of wax, the potential of improvement in swelling properties is possible. © 2022, North Carolina State University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. The productive variability of the forage is determined by the type of soil and the cultivation system. The use of silvopastoral systems represents an alternative because they can increase forage production and quality. Objective. To evaluate the production, the morphological components and the nutritional quality of the biomass of Cynodon plectostachyus (star grass) alone or in association with Leucaena leucocephala (huaxin). Methodology. The study was carried out in Tizimin, Yucatan, Mexico. Plots of C. plectostachyus were established in alleys croping of L. leucocephala and in monoculture, in hyperskeletal Luvisols and Leptosols soils. A 2 X 2 factorial design with five repetitions per treatment was used. The biomass production, the forage components and the content of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber were evaluated for one year. Results. Forage production, leaf and forage quality did not change according to the cultivation system (p≥0.05). No effect is believed due to the type of soil (p≥0.05). The interaction of the cultivation system with the type of soil increased the NDF content of C. plectostachyus (p≤0.05). Implications. The association of C. plectostachyus and L. leucocephala could increase the availability of structural carbohydrates for ruminant nutrition. Likewise, it is essential to consider long-term evaluations that allow to know the improvements in the crude protein content and the biomass production of the grasses in association under silvopastoral systems. Conclusions. The association of C. plectostachyus with L. leucocephala in Leptosol soil increases the availability of structural carbohydrates by increasing the stem and dead tissue that can be incorporated as organic matter in the soil. © 2022 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

AB  - Acacia mangium and Leuceana leucocephala are both exotic species known to be planted in Malaysia. Both species are well known to possess high growth rate, therefore made as reforestation species as well as a popular resource for pulp and paper industry. The main objectives of this study are to determine the chemical compositions of small diameter wild Acacia mangium and Leucaena leucocephala species and to compare that properties between of them at three (3) different stem portions (bottom, middle and top) and two (2) different parts (bark and wood). All analyses were done according to TAPPI standard method, except hemicellulose (Wise et al.) and holocellulose (formula). All the data and results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's Post Hoc test. Results revealed alcohol-toluene solubles was highest in bottom portion of Acacia mangium bark (14.98%). Holocellulose can be found highest in middle portion of Leuceana leucocephala wood (90.61%). For α-cellulose, highest was in Leuceana leucocephala bark (69.36%). Hemicellulose was most abundant in Acacia mangium top portion of wood (36.14%), while highest lignin was in its bottom portion of bark (31.18%). ANOVA indicates there are statistically high significance between species for all chemical composition, but between portions, only alcohol-toluene soluble and holocellulose are significant. For parts, all chemical composition is significant, except for lignin. This study proved that small diameter wild Acacia mangium and Leuceana leucocephala as a viable resource for pulp and paper industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a potential species for wood-energy production in Indonesia. A study of genetic improvement was initiated with a progeny test of 80 lines from 10 seed sources. Plant height and stem diameter were measured at 6 and 18 months, growth index (GI) calculated at 18 months and wood biomass production measured at 30 months. Differences between seed sources for height and diameter were observed at 6 months but not at 18 months. Significant differences between lines within seed source were observed for height and diameter at 6 months and these differences remained at 18 months. Differences between lines for GI and biomass were significant at 18 and 30 months respectively. At 18 months, line mean heritability for height, diameter and GI were estimated to be moderate, namely 0.62, 0.61 and 0.62 respectively. At 30 months line mean heritability for biomass was moderately low (0.39). Genetic correlations between height and diameter were moderately high at 6 months (0.74) and increased at 18 months (0.82), while correlation between diameters at 6 and 18 months was high (0.93). The expected genetic gain from selecting the 25 and 10 best lines with a high line value for GI was 33.7% and 48.8% respectively, with lines from the Indonesian local seed sources found to be the best performers. Three lines from the newly introduced Tarramba cultivar also had good performance. These results are discussed in relation to the future improvement program of this species for wood energy production. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Mimosine is a nonprotein amino acid biosynthesized from OAS (O-acetylserine) and 3H4P (3-hydroxy-4-pyridone or its tautoisomer 3,4-dihydroxypyridine). This amino acid constitutively occurs in all parts of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit plants and is found at higher concentrations in seeds and leaves. This metabolite has several useful activities, such as antioxidant, allelochemical, insecticidal, antimicrobial, metal chelating, and antitumor. Mimosine is well studied in biomedical research due its ability to inhibit cells in the late G1 phase and to induce cell apoptosis. Two simple methods of mimosine extraction from leucaena leaves, pulverized and whole maceration, are described herein in detail. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, torrefaction under mechanical pressure of 10–70 MPa at 250 °C was proposed as a pretreatment method and its effect on pyrolysis behaviours of Leucaena (LC) was examined at 900 °C. It was found that the mechanical pressure applied during torrefaction could significantly increase the char yield at 900 °C. The char yield increased from 18.7% for Raw to 26.4% and 27.5% for MP40 and MP70, respectively. The %C of biochar prepared from MP40 (MP40-900) was 86.5%, whereas the %C of biochar prepared from raw (Raw-900) was 82.6%. From TG-MS analyses during the pyrolysis of MP, a large amount of oxygen was removed as H2O and CO2. The analyses of tars produced from MP showed higher fraction of acids and furans compared with tar produced from Raw. Furthermore, the mechanism of the pyrolysis of LC torrefied under mechanical pressure was discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study evaluated the performance, carcass characteristics, tissue composition, and meat quality of goats raised on pasture in the Caatinga rangeland supplemented with Leucena (Leucaena leucocephala) and Sabiá (Mimosa caesapiniifolia) hays associated or not with spineless cactus (Nopalea cochenillifera), and without supplementation. Thirty male castrated goats, no defined breed, with an average body weight of 15.5 kg ± 0.64 were used, distributed in a randomized block design, according to the initial weight of the animals. The experimental period lasted 105 days. The highest intake of DM, OM and CP occurred in the animals supplemented with Leucena hay associated or not with spineless cactus. The intake of NDF was higher (p <0.05) for animals fed only with Leucena and Sabiá hays. The highest intake of TDN was observed for diets, only grazing, and hays associated with spineless cactus. The daily weight gain for goats fed with Leucena hay and spineless cactus was 68.5% higher (p <0.05) than on grazing alone. Consequently, they obtained the highest (p <0.05) weights and yields of carcasses, shoulder, loin, and leg cuts, conformation and finishing scores, leg muscle index, and % fat in the leg of goats. The meat quality did not differ. The supplementation with Leucena hay associated with spineless cactus improves performance, weights, and yields of the carcass, commercial cuts, leg muscle of goats grazing in the Caatinga rangeland. © 2022, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the simple and combined inoculation with three local rhizobia isolates (R1, R2 and R3) and two species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomus cubense-AMF1-and Claroideoglomus claroideum-AMF2-) on mycorrhizal colonization, nodulation, growth and biomass production of Leucaena leucocephala in a substrate with a close to neutral pH under greenhouse conditions. Thirteen treatments were evaluated in a completely randomized design with five replications. The inoculation and co-inoculation promoted greater plant growth with respect to the control without inoculation and to the fertilization treatment. Within the inoculation and co-inoculation treatments, one rhizobium isolate (R2) stood out for producing the highest plant height and leaflet production, while the R3 + AMF1 and R3 + AMF2 combinations promoted the highest plant height, and also promoted higher biomass together with R1 + AMF1. In addition, the R3 + AMF2 combination stood out for presenting a high number of AMF spores, frequency and intensity by AMF colonization, and nodule activity. It is concluded that inoculation with local rhizobia isolates and their combination with AMF favors the development of mycorrhizal structures, nodulation, growth and biomass production of L. leucocephala grown in a substrate with neutral pH. Isolate R2 and the combination R3 + AMF2 were identified as effective inoculants to increase plant growth. © 2022

AB  - The parasitism of Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae) by the parasitoid Horismenus abnormicaulis (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is described for the first time. We harvested 90 Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) fruit pods, in June 2019 on the campus of the Federal University of Lavras in the municipality of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We found 21 individuals of H. abnormicaulis and 334 of A. macrophthalmus. The presence of cephalic capsule of beetle's pupa and evidence of predation into seed pods from which the wasps emerged suggested H. abnormicaulis is a parasitoid of A. macrophthalmus. Horismenus abnormicaulis has been added to the list of A. macrophthalmus parasitoids, and its occurrence has been expanded to the state of Minas Gerais. This discovery expands our knowledge of H. abnormicaulis biology and distribution in Brazil, as well as the tri-trophic interaction, plant-herbivore-parasitoid in invasive plant systems. © 2022 Sociedade Brasileira De Entomologia.

AB  - In this study, the impact of long term exposure of elevated ozone (+20 ppb above ambient) on photosynthetic traits and anti-oxidative defense system of Leucaena leucocephala, a tree of great economic importance, was studied in a Free Air Ozone Concentration Enrichment (O3-FACE) facility at different time intervals (6, 12, 18, and 24 months). Results showed that net photosynthesis, photosynthetic pigments and lipid peroxidation were significantly reduced after 6, 12 and 24 months of exposure to elevated ozone (eO3) whereas stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were significantly decreased after 12 months of exposure to eO3. Antioxidant enzymatic activities (catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase) were significantly increased after 12 months of exposure to eO3. Ascorbate was increased significantly after 6 and 12 months of exposure to eO3 while reduced glutathione content declined significantly after 6 and 24 months of exposure to eO3. The study showed that there were several negative long lasting physiological and biochemical responses in Leucaena. The results provide evidence that Leucaena exhibited greater sensitivity to O3 during initial exposure (up to 12 months) but showed moderate tolerance by the end of the 2nd year. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study assessed and classified the phytoremediation potentials of selected plant species around gold mining areas in restoring the environments contaminated by heavy metals. The geographic focuses of the study were the Golden Pride Gold Mine (GPGM) and Geita Gold Mine (GGM) in Tanzania. The shoots and roots of plant species surrounding the mining areas and the samples of associated soils were collected and analysed for total concentrations of lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), arsenic (As), manganese (Mn) and nickel (Ni) using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) and UV-VIS spectrophotometry. Results indicated that the soils from study areas were loamy textured and slightly acid (pH 6.1–6.5), soil organic carbon and organic matter were low (0.6–2.0%), total nitrogen was very low (<0.10%), phosphorous ranged from low (6–12 mg kg-1 soil) to high (13–25 mg kg-1 soil), and cation exchange capacity ranged from low (6.0–12.0 cmol(+) kg-1 soil) to medium (12.1–25.0 cmol(+) kg-1 soil). In assessing heavy metals using plant parts, the roots of giant rats-tail grass (Sporobolus pyramidalis) accumulated highest Pb (757.78 μg g-1), Creeping Blepharis (Blepharis maderaspatensis) the Cd (158.11 μg g-1), lantana (Lantana camara) the As (68.61 μg g-1), and leuceana (Leucaena leucocephala) accumulated higher Mn (2734.61 μg g-1) and Ni (4464.33 μg g-1). In shoots, L. leucocephala accumulated higher Cr (1276.67 μg g-1) and higher Cu (2744.44 μg g-1) in L. camara. Although S. pyramidalis, M. repens, L. camara, B. maderaspatensis and L. leucocephala are likely to pose hazards to herbivores (grazing animals) while entering the food chain, they are still potential hyperaccumulators thus can be used to decontaminate metalliferous affected soils. Blepharis maderaspatensis has never been reported anywhere as Pb, Cd, Cu, Mn and Ni uptake plant hence this can be regarded as a new finding © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The potential values and application of soil bioengineering techniques are crucial for the slope protection and ecological restoration. Knowledge related to the biological and engineering properties of plants is essential for the implementation of soil bioengineering techniques. Thus, four tropical species namely Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia mangium, Dillenia suffruticosa and Melastoma malabathricum were evaluated in terms of root profiles and root engineering properties. Leucaena leucocephala showed the highest root tensile strength followed by A. mangium, D. suffruticosa and M. malabathricum. Pull-out resistance was mostly affected by the root than the shoot profiles. Leaf area index (LAI) and root biomass were strongly correlated (R2 = 0.79), implying that the root biomass would be higher if the plant canopy was higher. Tree species, L. leucocephala and A. mangium, had deep rooting system and recommended for slope protection. Shrub species, M. malabathricum and D. suffruticosa had shallow root system and suggested for controlling soil erosion. Based on the overall engineering properties, L. leucocephala showed excellent performance through its root profiles and can be a potential plant for soil reinforcement. In conclusion, plant pull-out resistance, root tensile strength and type of roots can be used as important tools to identify plant performance for soil reinforcement. The results can be an aid to select potential slope plants for implementing soil bioengineering and slope protection techniques successfully. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia

TI  - Anthelmintic-like Activity of Leucaena leucocephala Aqueous Extract Against Gyrodactylus spp. in Naturally Infected Tilapia Fingerlings
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113133271&doi=10.1002%2fnaaq.10206&partnerID=40&md5=d5ff000c3636958ef4e5c1ffa147d350
AB  - Aquaculture represents the fastest growing food-producing sector worldwide. However, the intensification of fish farms has led to environmental, health, and welfare challenges. The monogenean ectoparasite Gyrodactylus spp. has been considered one of the most pathogenic ectoparasites affecting fish, and no specific control strategies besides formalin baths have been established. The use of bioactive plants has been recently proposed as an alternative method to control gyrodactylid infections. Leucaena leucocephala is a tropical legume that has been found with anthelmintic activity against both internal and external parasites of cattle. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the anthelmintic-like activity of L. leucocephala aqueous extract against Gyrodactylus spp. in hybrid tilapia Oreochromis spp. fingerlings and its effect on host health through histopathological analysis. Five concentrations of L. leucocephala aqueous extract were employed (2.00, 1.00, 0.50, 0.25, and 0.125 mg/mL) to estimate the mean effective concentration (EC50). Distilled water and formalin (1:4,000) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The aqueous extract of L. leucocephala showed a dose-dependent behavior, with an EC50 of 0.228 mg/mL. Quercetin was identified as the main phytochemical present in the extract. Postmortem analysis of fingerlings exposed to the plant extract had no treatment-associated pathological findings, thus indicating that the use of L. leucocephala baths had no negative impact that could jeopardize the lives of treated animals. After the in vivo assessment, the aqueous extract of L. leucocephala appears to be a promising alternative to control gyrodactylid infection in tilapia. © 2021 American Fisheries Society

AB  - To reduce the feed cost in raising chickens it is necessary to find alternative feed sources. The feed ingredients must have relatively low prices, do not compete with human needs, and have abundant availability on location. The purpose of this study was to determine the performance of KUB chicken production with feed containing Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf flour (LLF). The study was conducted using 300 chickens aged 4 weeks, unsexed, which were allotted to 4 treatments, each with 5 replicates and 15 birds per replicate in a Completely Randomized Design. The treatments were in the form of a) T0: 0% LLF; b) T1: 3% LLF; c) T2: 5% LLF and d) T3: 7% LLF. The LLF was mixed with a basal feed in a mixture of concentrate, corn and bran. The study lasted for 6 weeks, i.e. until the chicken was 10 weeks old, with observations including daily weight gain (DWG), feed consumption, feed conversion ratio (FCR), and income over feed cost (IOFC). The results showed that the best performance of KUB chicken production was by the addition of 5% LLF in the feed, as it could increase the DWG value, reduce the FCR value and increase the IOFC value. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Could more efficient utilization of ecosystem services improve soil quality indicators to allow sustainable intensification of Amazonian family farming?
PY  - 2021

AB  - In the Amazonian periphery, there are sources of numerous disservices, including deforestation, loss of wildlife habitat and biodiversity erosion. However, there are great opportunities to adopt appropriate agricultural management practices to take advantage of the benefits of ecosystem services for sustainable agricultural intensification. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of certain ecosystem services provided by combined use of legumes with residue of low- and high-quality on soil quality indicators, nitrogen use efficiency and sustainability of maize grain yield in infertile tropical soil. The overarching objective is to determine how ecosystem services can contribute to the improvement of land-use policy to ensure the sustainability of cultivated lands, in such a way that forest can be preserved by avoiding deforestation of other new areas through shifting cultivation systems. Four leguminous tree species were used, two with high-quality residues Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) and Gliricidia sepium (gliricidia) and two with low-quality residues Clitoria fairchildiana (clitoria) and Acacia mangium (acacia). Maize grain yield was evaluated between 2011 and 2017 in these treatments. In 2018, to assess how ecosystem services affect crop performance, the treatments were divided into ten treatments with and without urea. We conclude that increased uptake of inorganic and organic N by maize resulting from improvement of the soil quality indicators may allow agricultural intensification. This improvement can help meet the challenges of sustainability and feasibility of agroecosystems of the Amazonian periphery by making the agroecosystem more productive year by year. Therefore, our results confirm that the utilization of an ecosystem services style approach can help meet the challenges of sustainability and feasibility in agrosystems of the Amazonian periphery. In addition, these results can contribute to the development of land-use policy in the Amazonian periphery, aiming for the intensification of agriculture in cropped areas to avoid deforestation of new areas from shifting cultivation systems. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - An experiment was done to examine the effect of the addition of different legume leaves on live weight gain, change in body dimension, and condition score of Donggala bulls fed corn stover (CS). Twenty-eight Donggala bulls (initial body weight (BW) 179.48±3.66 kg) were blocked by BW in a randomized complete block design with 4 treatments and 7 replicates. The treatments were CS ad libitum, CS plus Desmanthus virgatus (CSD), CS plus Gliricidia sepium (CSG), and CS plus Leucaena leucocephala (CSL). All supplements were offered at level 1% BW dry matter (DM)/day. The experiment was run for 16 weeks, with 2 and 14 weeks for the introduction and measurement period, respectively. The parameters observed include average daily live weight gain (ADG), wither height, heart girth, body length, and body condition score (BCS). It was observed that the addition of different tree legumes leaves lifted up significantly (P<0.05) ADG, change in heart girth, BCS but did not affect significantly (P>0.05) change of wither height and body length of Donggala bulls fed CS. The addition of Leucaena resulted in the highest increase (P<0.05) in ADG, change of heart girth, and BCS. It was concluded that supplementation of tree legume leaves increased the growth performance of Donggala bulls fed CS.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - L-mimosine is a compound found in Leucaena leucocephala, that is used as animal feed due to its high protein content, but it can also cause intoxication. Due to its low solubility in organic and aqueous solvents, its administration in laboratory animals is difficult, especially in delicate periods such as pregnancy. Thus, to circumvent such problems, this study proposes a stress-free form of oral administration with gelatin tablets with flavoring (meat broth) for 14 consecutive days of the gestational period (GD06 to GD20). For that, 17 pregnant Wistar rats divided into 3 groups were used: control (CO; n = 5) not treated; gelatin (GEL; n = 6), which received a gelatin tablet with flavoring; and gelatin with flavoring added 140 mg/kg of L-mimosine (GM; n = 6). All animals received feed and water ad libitum. The parameters analyzed were body weight gain, water and feed consumption, serum biochemistry, blood count and reproductive indices. Among these, only the real and total weight gains of dams showed statistically significant differences, with a decrease in the group GM. Thus, we could observe that flavored gelatin was an efficient and effective administration method to insoluble compounds and long-term administration to pregnant rats, with quick adaptation and without refusal by the animals. In addition, we could observe a direct effect of L-mimosine on the animals' weight gain; however, the dose administered was not sufficient to confer maternal and fetal toxicity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A mineral evaluation of the components of the intensive silvopastoral system, soil, drinking water, forage (Leucaena leucocephala, Megathyrsus maximus) and blood serum of calves and dairy cows was performed. Three samplings were carried out in the cold, dry and rainy seasons. Cu, Fe, Zn, Ca, Mg, K, Na and P were determined and analyzed. Elevated levels of Fe, Ca, K and Mg were found in the soil, while minerals from drinking water remained within adequate ranges, with the exception of Fe (0.61 and 0.57 mg kg-1) at the ranches El Vivero and Los Huarinches, respectively. The concentration of Ca, Mg, K and Na was higher in Leucaena leucocephala than in Megathyrsus maximus, while the content of Cu (6.16 and 5.66 mg kg-1), Zn (17.9 and 24.4) and P (2,584.5 and 2,682.8 mg kg-1) in both ranches do not meet the requirements of the cows, which could generate low levels of these elements in blood serum, in both cows and calves: Cu (0.64 and 0.54 mg kg-1), Zn (0.74 and 0.60 mg kg-1) and P (49.24 and 39.43 mg kg-1), respectively. © 2021 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this research is to formulate and evaluate the wound healing gel of Leucaena leucocephala leaves extract. Methods: In this research, the extract of Leucaena leaves was formulated into wound healing gel by using a variation of the concentration of Carbopol as a gelling agent and Propylene glycol as a humectant. Afterward, the gel's physical properties (pH, viscosity, spreadability), stability, and sterility were tested. The wound healing activity was evaluated by making excision wounds on the Wistar Albino rat's back, and then the gels were applied to the wound every day. The wound's size was measured and counted as the percentage of wound closure. Results: The result showed that Formula 4 (contains 1.5% of Carbopol and 12% of Propylene glycol) has the best physical characteristics and wound healing activity. Formula 4 showed 100% wound closure on the 11th day of the treatment, while the negative control only reached 49.12%. The statistical parameter with the p-value<0.05 stated that they are significantly different. Conclusion: This research demonstrated that gel with Leucaena leaf extract has good physical characteristics, and it can significantly improve the wound healing process. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Wet and dry foams are prevalent in many industries, ranging from the food processing and commercial cosmetic sectors to industries such as chemical and oil-refining. Uncontrolled foaming results in product losses, equipment downtime or damage and cleanup costs. To speed up defoaming or enable anti-foaming, liquid oil or hydrophobic particles are usually added. However, such additives may need to be later separated and removed for environmental reasons and product quality. Here, we show that passive defoaming or active anti-foaming is possible simply by the interaction of foam with chemically or morphologically modified surfaces, of which the superamphiphobic variant exhibits superior performance. They significantly improve retraction of highly stable wet foams and prevention of growing dry foams, as quantified for beer and aqueous soap solution as model systems. Microscopic imaging reveals that amphiphobic nano-protrusions directly destabilize contacting foam bubbles, which can favorably vent through air gaps warranted by a Cassie wetting state. This mode of interfacial destabilization offers untapped potential for developing efficient, low-power and sustainable foam and froth management. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Agroforestry system is a mixed plantation between cultivation planting and tree species in a forest land area. Coffee with a shade tree is commonly found out as an agroforestry system in Aceh Tengah highlands. Many farmers choose tree species suit for coffee to support coffee productivity. This research aimed to identify the planting of shade trees and coffee; what kinds of species mainly be grown by farmers. The research found that most farmers prefer to plant Leucaena leucocephala than other species causes the benefit of Leucaena leucocephala species. Coffee farmers should use trees as a protective crop to increase the total coffee production. Use Leucaena leucocephala as a protective tree because Leucaena leucocephala root contains rhizobium, helping coffee production. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can increase the acquisition of silicon (Si) and, therefore, alleviate the problems caused by metallic toxicity in plants, but this effect remains poorly understood. The objective was to evaluate the influence of Si application on the growth of Leucaena leucocephala inoculated with AMF (Claroideoglomus etunicatum) in a soil contaminated by manganese (Mn). We exposed plants to increasing levels of Si (0, 100, 200 and 400 mg kg-1) in the soil for 90 days. Intermediate levels of Si and AMF inoculation significantly increased shoot and root dry mass, the number of sheets, root system length and mycorrhizal colonization. The abundance of AMF spores decreased linearly with increasing levels of Si applied to the soil, suggesting a low correlation with mycorrhizal colonization. In addition to the higher Mn contents in the shoots and, mainly, in the roots, the combined application of Si and inoculation with AMF significantly reduced foliar toxicity by more than 40%, when compared to the absence of Si and AMF inoculation. Our results demonstrated a synergistic effect of AMF and Si in improving the growth and tolerance of L. leucocephala plants in soil contaminated by Mn. © 2022 Nativa. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetation cover affects soil organic matter and activity of soil microorganisms. We investigated the intercropping effect of forage cactus with tree legumes on soil microbial biomass and organic matter in the semi-arid tropic, state of Pernambuco, Brazil. We assessed the following cropping systems: (i) Gliricidia sepium intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertânia; (ii) Leucaena leucocephala intercropped with cactus cv. IPA-Sertânia; and (iii) Cactus cv. IPA-Sertânia in monoculture. Samples were collected during the dry and rainy seasons in the 0-to 0.10-and 0.10-to 0.20-m soil layers at 0, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 m in a perpendicular gradient from tree legume rows. The following responses were determined: δ13C and δ15N, C and N, microbial activity and biomass, and metabolic, microbial, and mineralization quotient. δ13C and δ15N varied with the distance from the trees. In the dry season and beginning of the rainy season, the cropping systems showed similar values for C, N, microbial activity, carbon, and nitrogen in the microbial biomass. The presence of tree legumes at the end of the rainy season favored soil microbiota, which showed a reduced loss of C-CO2, with no indication of metabolic stress and greater microbial biomass and microbial quotient in relation to forage cactus in monoculture. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The coastline of Banda Aceh is one of the locations where land, water and air elements meet. This meeting point functions as buffer zones for migrating birds as a place to find food, rest, and other activities. The aim of this study is to determine the type of migratory bird stopover habitat in the coastal area of Banda Aceh. This study is a descriptive qualitative research with a direct observation. The results of this study indicate that there are four types of migratory bird stopover habitats in the coastline of Banda Aceh which is rich in natural resources and plant vegetation to be used as a stopover for migratory birds, namely beaches, mangrove forests, ponds, and swamps with locations in Gampong Pande, Kuta Raja Subdistrict, Lampulo Village, in Kuta Alam Subdistrict, and Alue Naga Village, Syiah Kuala Subdistrict. This study revealed that these locations are rich in natural resources and plant vegetation, such as Rhizophora apiculata (oil mangrove), Rhizophora mucronata (loop-root mangrove), Avicennia marina (grey maggrove), Avicennia alba (Api-Api Putih), Casuarina equisetifolia (Coastal She-oak), and Leucaena leucocephala (river tamarind). These locations are ideal for migratory birds as they can be used as a stopover place to find food, rest, and breed. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Crop productivity is affected by organic and inorganic fertilizer. Sweet corn (Zea mays saccharatta) is used under crop-livestock system (CLS) in Indonesia. The characteristic of CLS is crop yield for food, stover and cornhusk for livestock feed, and dung (i.e. cattle, goat, poultry) for manure as organic fertilizer. Organic-N (Leucaena leucocephala) and nature-P (rock phosphate) enhanced the quality of manure if added at the initial fermentation process that was called manure plus. Present study investigated the effect of organic-N and nature-P enriched manure application on plant growth and sweet corn production, stover and cornhusk production in Batang District of Central Java. The experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design with seven treatments and four replicates, T1 (SA+TSP), T2 (cattle manure+inorganic), T3 (cattle manure plus), T4 (goat manure+inorganic), T5 (goat manure plus), T6 (poultry manure+inorganic), T7 (poultry manure plus). The results showed that plant height and sweet corn production, stover and cornhusk production significantly affected by the treatment. Goat manure plus resulted in similar on plant growth and sweet corn production compared to manure+inorganic fertilizer. It was concluded that N-Leucaena leucocephala and P-RP enriched manure replaces inorganic fertilizer (SA+TSP).  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Special wettability material is an important material for oily wastewater treatment. Among various wettability materials, the metal mesh material showed great advantages, such as high mechanical strength, high separation efficiency, and self-cleaning properties based on recent studies. This review article firstly describes the basic mechanism of surface wettability, including the contact angle in the air (e.g. Young's mode, Wenzel's mode, and Cassie-Baxter's mode), the contact angle hysteresis, and the rolling angle. The special wettability including superhydrophobic-oleophilic, hydrophilic-oleophobic, hydrophilic-underwater oleophobic, and switchable wettability and characteristic of the fabrication method and are discussed in this paper. The properties of the various metals that can be used for oil-water separation are summarized. Moreover, the challenges faced by metal mesh materials in oil-water separation are analyzed, and future development and application have prospected. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work is considered the first study for the components of the Iraqi Leucaena leucocephala plant, where the different phytochemical compounds that present in the aerial parts were identified by using the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technique (GC/MS). The type of the components and their concentration will differ according to the part of the plant used and the method of extraction (hot and cold). This study made a comparison in lupeol concentration that was identified and isolated from petroleum ether fractions of Leucaena leucocephala by using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), and Preparative High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (P-HPLC). The plant leaves and stems were collected in September, dried under shade, and powdered (separately), then extracted by two extraction methods: hot Soxhlet and cold maceration method using 85% ethanol, then the result crude extract was fractionation with petroleum ether by using a separator funnel. The results of GC/MS, HPTLC, and PHPLC indicated that the leaves contain a higher concentration of lupeol than the stems and the cold maceration method is more efficient than the hot Soxhlet extraction method. Lupeol has many pharmacological activities applied in alternative medicine such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-arthritic, anticancer, antidiabetic, and antioxidant activities with wide future applications. © 2022 University of Baghdad - College of Pharmacy.

AB  - The infestation of weedy rice has becoming a threat which leads to competition between weedy rice and commercial rice for nutrient uptake. Weedy rice management is more dependent on the herbicides application that can contribute to various environmental problems. Thus, this study was conducted to assess the allelopathic potential of two invasive plants namely L. leucocephala and D. linearis in controlling the growth of weedy rice. The allelopathic potential was evaluated through laboratory bioassay namely the dish pack method, sandwich method and plant box method to determine the allelopathic potential on the seedling growth of two weedy rice variants collected in Peninsular Malaysia (designated as WRE and WRN) and MR220 CL2 rice variety. Highest concentration of L. leucocephala leaf litter (50 mg) inhibited the radicle elongation of MR220 CL2, WRN and WRE by 49 %, 51 % and 83 % compared to control, respectively. Through the dish pack method, the volatile compound from D. linearis leaf were found to disrupt the radicle growth of MR220 CL2, WRN and WRE by 21 %, 29 % and 25 % of the control at the nearest distance (41 mm) of the bioassay plants with the D. linearis leaf. Compared with D. linearis, the root exudate from L. leucocephala exhibited higher inhibitory effect towards the bioassay species. Overall, the findings from this study showed that the allelopathic potential of L. leucocephala was more preferable to be investigated further for sustainable weedy rice management in the future by infusing the biological approach. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Optimization Study of Leucaena leucocephala Seed Extract as Natural Coagulant on Decolorization of Aqueous Congo Red Solutions
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092591991&doi=10.1007%2fs13369-020-05008-1&partnerID=40&md5=2ffab6db923a215cfd05d292c4f8c763
AB  - Coagulation is a water and wastewater treatment technology that has been widely used due to its high efficiency and effectiveness. Various inorganic salts are commonly used as coagulant; however, there are some negative impacts of utilization of these chemical coagulants, such as high costs, large sludge volume, and also potential negative impact to human health. To overcome these problems, natural-based coagulants have been explored to reduce and substitute chemical coagulants. In this study we investigated utilization of Leucaena leucocephala seed protein, extracted using 0.5 M MgCl2 solution as natural coagulant to treat synthetic Congo red wastewater. From the protein solubility profile at various pH, it could be observed that leucaena protein’s isoelectric point was around pH 4. The optimization of coagulation condition was done by using Response Surface Method (RSM)—Central Composite Design (CCD) with variations of pH (2.93–4.12), coagulant dose (183.52–496.58 mg eq BSA/L), and dye concentration (44.1–56 mg/L). This experimental design was used to obtain the optimum condition that gave maximum dye removal percentage and minimum sludge volume. It was found that pH, coagulant dose, and dye concentration were significant for dye removal and sludge volume. Furthermore, it became evident that charge neutralization was the coagulation mechanism in this study. Based on the obtained model, 88.61% dye removal with 16.93 mL/L sludge volume was obtained at the optimum condition. The predicted optimum condition was in a good agreement with experimental data with relatively low error value. The obtained result implies good potency of leucaena as natural coagulant. © 2020, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - Green manures are an adequate alternative for improving the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus for crop nutrition, within a global context of decreasing soil fertility and the urgent need to care for the environment. Mixteca region, covers a wide area of central Mexico, characterized by a semi-arid climate, eroded calcareous soil, and rural poverty. With the aim of proposing technologies for improving soil quality and increasing the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus, an experiment was conducted using green manures: Canavalia ensiformis, Dolichos lablab, Leucaena leucocephala and Avena strigosa and Phaseolus vulgaris, that would ensure a balance between N and P release and the requirements of maize cultivation. The rate of enriched soil mineralization with green manures was determined through incubation, controlled for 15 days with CO2 emissions using an OxiTop OC110® kit as an indicator of decomposition. CO2 emissions were greatest in the soil established with Leucaena leucocephala and least in the soil with no fertilizer, with emissions descending in the following order: Leucaena leucocephala > Canavalia ensiformis > Avena strigosa +Phaseolus vulgaris > Dolichos lablab > soil without green manure. It is assumed that a greater flow of CO2 is accompanied by greater mineralization and release of nutrients. The Ntotal in the soil treated with green manures was similar and greater than that of the soil without fertilizer. Soil treated with Avena strigosa+Phaseolus vulgaris contained the highest values of Nmineral (N-ammonium + N-nitrate). POlsen content in soils with green manures was double that of the soil without fertilizer. Incubation provided the opportunity of identifying those green manures with higher agronomic potential in the area under study. The biomass comprising Leucaena leucocephala leaves and tender stems constitute an alternative for improving soil by providing OM. However, when considering the availability of N and P, the Avena strigosa+Phaseolus vulgaris combination is a superior alternative for meeting the needs of maize cultivation. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 4.0 International license.

TI  - A lucerne-digit grass pasture offers herbage production and rainwater productivity equal to a digit grass pasture fertilized with applied nitrogen
PY  - 2022
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117728917&doi=10.1016%2fj.agwat.2021.107266&partnerID=40&md5=f6c5ab2a2e3073eb7d37cd5e5be91a39
AB  - In recent years, livestock producers have widely sown tropical perennial grasses, such as digit grass (Digitaria eriantha), in the frost-prone summer dominant rainfall zone of eastern Australia. Tropical grasses require substantial nitrogen inputs to maintain water productivity and forage quality. Perennial legumes offer a potential nitrogen source for these perennial grasses when sown in a mixed sward. Lucerne (Medicago sativa) is the perennial legume most widely sown in grazing systems in south-eastern Australia. In this study, conducted over the period 2014–2018, we compared the soil water dynamics and rainwater productivity of pure stands of digit grass (fertilized with applied nitrogen), lucerne, desmanthus (Desmanthus virgatus) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and binary mixtures of digit grass (not fertilized with applied nitrogen) with each legume. We found that often growing season actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was similar among the treatments (P > 0.05), but rainwater productivity (kg DM/ha.mm) and proportion (%) of legume herbage mass were not (P < 0.05). Our results showed that the lucerne-digit grass mix was equally productive and efficient as fertilized digit grass (P > 0.05), particularly in the latter three seasons. However, lucerne dominated the herbage mass (c. > 67% legume). Leucaena production was delayed by frost and severely impacted by competition with digit grass, and generally underperformed both lucerne and desmanthus. This observation did always not hold when alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) impacted desmanthus in specific seasons. Our experiment has shown that a mixed sward of lucerne-digit grass is highly productive and offered high rainwater productivity. Both desmanthus and leucaena, in mixes with digit grass, provided useful contributions of legume herbage mass, in specific seasons and under specific conditions, but both underperformed overall compared with lucerne. © 2021

AB  - Background and aims: Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) has been considered one of the 100 most invasive species on a global scale. Despite its potential threat, its introduction is increasingly being promoted for agroforestry, ornamentation, shading and handicrafts in the warm and temperate forest regions of Argentina. The threat of Leucaena populations to biodiversity has been reported worldwide, where control was not effective. The aims of the present study were to update the record of naturalized populations in Argentina and provide information on the historical and current processes of naturalization and invasion. M&M: The records were documented by collecting plant material in the field and examination of material housed in herbaria. Field observations were also made to observe current naturalization processes and interaction with dispersers/predators. Results: The invasive condition was confirmed in Argentina and two introduction pathways were recognized. Based on the general appearance of the groves and the microhabitat that is generated in the invaded environments, it is considered a transformer species in Argentina. The reproductive characteristics and their interaction with other strata of regional biodiversity related to the invasive process are indicated. Conclusions: The analysis of the herbarium labels allowed detecting that in 1921 this species was already naturalized in the country. The intervention of humans in its dispersal is discussed and future scenarios are proposed. © 2022,Boletin de la Sociedad Argentina de Botanica. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Effect of supplementing Leucaena leucocephala leaves alone or in conjunction with malic acid on nutrient utilization, performance traits, and enteric methane emission in crossbred calves under tropical conditions
PY  - 2021

AB  - Dietary strategies aiming at minimizing enteric methane (CH4) emission in ruminants are of practical interest from nutritional, economical, and environmental point of view. The present study evaluated the effects of supplementing Leucaena leucocephala leaves either alone or in conjunction with malic acid on nutrient utilization, growth performance, and enteric CH4 emission in crossbred cattle fed wheat straw and concentrate-based diet under tropical conditions. Eighteen crossbred (Karan-Fries) calves were randomly allocated into 3 groups: G-I (control)—fed wheat (Triticum aestivum) straw and concentrate mixture in the ratio 50:50; G-II—fed wheat straw, concentrate mixture, and Leucaena leucocephala leaves in the ratio 45:45:10; and (3) G-III—fed similar diet like G-II with an additional supplementation of 1% malic acid on dry matter intake basis. Experimental feeding spanning 90 days included a 7-day metabolism trial and CH4 quantification study by sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique. Results revealed no significant effect of dietary treatments on dry matter intake (DMI) and digestibility of nutrients, except neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility which was 5.5% higher (P < 0.05) in G-III as compared to control. Further, nitrogen (N) metabolism, rumen microbial protein synthesis, and growth performance remained similar among the treatments. No significant effect was also observed for enteric CH4 emission (expressed as g/day and g/kg DMI) in calves supplemented with Leucaena leucocephala leaves and malic acid. Therefore, the present findings depict modest improvement in fiber digestibility with no encouraging effect in mitigating enteric CH4 in growing cattle calves by supplementing Leucaena leucocephala leaves alone or with malic acid within the selected levels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: After suffering from an acute problem of excess water for a long time, the Oasis of Ouargla benefited from an aerated lagoon treatment plant, producing biologically treated domestic effluents. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of reusing this effluent for watering plants. The experiment was conducted in the Ouargla WWTP, which is located in the region of Said Otba (northeast of Ouargla), north of the national road NR 49. Methods: The study area was selected based on the originality of the study and availability of water. The plants used were Acacia farnesiana and Leucaena leucocephala. The selection of Leucaena was based on the following criteria: It is used as a windbreak, it is very tolerant to drought, and it is used as a fodder to maintain soil fertility. And, Acacia was selected because it is used as a fodder, protects the soil against erosion, and to fix nitrogen. The watering of these plants is done jointly by treated wastewater from the WWTP and well water (WW), of which the latter was used as a control. Sampling and analysis of the irrigation water were performed according to the experimental protocol. To show the growth rate of the two plants studied, biometric measurements were taken weekly for 25 weeks. Results: The physicochemical analyses show that the treated wastewater is of poor quality belonging to the last class of Riverside’s C5-S4, with an excessive salinity (EC) of 13.51 dS/m and an Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of 12.61 against EC of 2.49 dS/m and 2.13 for the WW. At the end of the experiment, it was found that irrigation with purified wastewater (PWW) gave less growth compared to that with WW. Statistical analyses of the biometric measurements confirmed that there is a highly significant difference at P < 0.05. Conclusion: The reuse of WWTP effluent gives less interesting results but is still possible. It is recommended to choose Salt-tolerant crops, as well as the dilution of these waters by the addition of less salty waters. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Asia, occupying nearly 30% of the earth’s terrestrial surface, is one of the most important continent known for its highly diverse culture, economy, geography, and ecology. Three of the world’s five largest economies, and nearly two-thirds of the world’s population, are in Asia. The continent has a diverse range of habitats including tropical moist and boreal forests, deserts, and the Arctic tundra. Eleven out of 36 global biodiversity hotspots are in Asia, all of which are threatened due to multiple human-mediated drivers including biological invasions. The number of known invasive alien plant species (IAPS) currently present in Asia is high, and their number and distribution are expected to increase further due to a lack of effective management responses, land use and climate changes, and expanding international trade, travel, and transport. IAPS such as Ageratina adenophora, Chromolaena odorata, Lantana camara, Leucaena leucocephala, Mikania micrantha, Mimosa diplotricha, Parthenium hysterophorus, and Pontederia crassipes are widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. Most of the known IAPS in Asia have a Central and South American origin. However, information on biological invasions, especially those of plants, is poor and fragmented, hampering efforts to develop and implement policies and management interventions. The continent is lagging behind much of the world in research effort and knowledge generation related to plant invasions. Capacity, both human and otherwise, of most countries to address biological invasions is low. Most countries (particularly in Central Asia) also lack a comprehensive database of IAPS. Ecological impact studies are also lacking in Southeast, Central, and North Asia. With a few exceptions, the economic cost of plant invasions is also unknown in most countries. Priority actions required for effective management of IAPS in Asia include regional collaboration for research and knowledge sharing, promotion and institutionalization of biological control, and increased focus on socioecological research related to plant invasions. Additionally, efforts are required at the continental scale to make all stakeholders aware of the problem of plant invasions for the formulation of appropriate policies and implementation of effective management strategies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Background: A 70% ethanolic extract of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit seeds contain a certain amount of sulfhydryl active compounds and potential for ameliorated cyclophosphamide side effects. Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze of urine 3-hidroxy propil mercapturic acid (3-HPMA) in a rat model for cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis to determine the effect of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit seeds extract. Materials and methods: The levels of urine 3-hidroxy propil mercapturic acid was measured using LCMS/MS. Urine preparation was carried out by dilution (1:5) with mobile phase and contained a deuteurated internal standard. The LC separation was performed using a C18 column (1.7 μm; 2.1 mm × 100 mm). The mobile phase consisted of formic acid (0.1%) and formic acid (0.1%) in acetonitrile (90:10 v/v), as a starting gradient at flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with total run 7 min. Results: The lower limit of quantification was 40 ng/ml and the linear extended to 20,000 ng/ml. The method has been successfully to be applied in determined of rat urine 3-HPMA. The results showed that the 70% ethanolic extract of seeds can increased the amount of 3-HPMA in rat urine. Conclusion: The 70% ethanolic extract of seeds displayed a potential ameliorating effect against cyclophosphamide side effects.  © 2021 Phcogj.Com.

AB  - Nematode parasites are an ongoing challenge in livestock production. Pharmaceutical anthelmintics are effective but pose their own risks. This is an overview of nematodiasis in small ruminants in Mexico focusing on the main problems faced by producers to maintain productivity. It includes general information on gastrointestinal nematodes and their effects on animal health and productivity. It also summarizes the main challenges faced by livestock producers in combating these parasites and current control and prevention strategies, including pharmaceuticals, anthelmintic resistance, grazing management, selective deworming, protein nutritional strategy, vaccination, and selection of animals genetically resistant to nematodes. The potential use of plants and compounds with nematocidal activity, and nematophagous fungi as biological control agents are also covered. Research by the Helminthology Department of the CENID-SAI of the INIFAP is highlighted, and a comprehensive nematode control method is proposed that targets different control strategies at specific nematode developmental stages. Controlling nematodiasis in small ruminants is vital to the success of production systems since it negatively affects animal health and producer results. Continued development of new nematode control options holds promise for successful long-term management of this disease. © 2021 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria. All rights reserved.

AB  - The improvement of dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) efficiency using clay from Timor to modify TiO2 semiconducting material with chlorophyll dyes as photosensitisers had been conducted. This investigation employed doctor blade method for photoelectrochemical cell design and testing using chlorophyll from three different plant leaves namely Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.), (A), Lannea coromandelica (B) and Cromoleana Odorata (C). Infra-Red, X-Ray Fluorescence and X-Ray Diffraction analysis show that the main chemical compositions of the clay are SiO2 (53%), Fe2O3 (22,2%) and Al2O3 (13%) identified as a typical bentonite clay. We found that the addition of clay onto TiO2 increased the efficiency of cells using these three different source of chlorophylls (A - from 0.0437 to 0.7502%, B - from 1.203 to 1.450% and C - from 0.034 to 0.284%) potential for further purifications or activations and applications. © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - Livestock in semi-arid areas such as the province of Santa Elena has ancestral management with deficiencies in animal nutrition, which economically affects small farmers or livestock producers, especially in the dry season. This type of production is not considered a profitable business, but rather as a subsistence activity. Feeding problems and incipient handling of the animals prevent them from gaining weight for meat or producing more milk. The objective of this research was to predict the daily production of meat and milk in cattle from energy estimates of forage species using mathematical formulas, to estimate the necessary amount of fresh forage (kg) that is needed to cover the total energy requirements of the animal. The results of the bromatological analysis in the specific conditions of the province of Santa Elena determined the tree species Caesalpinia glabatra with the highest% of dry matter, Leucaena leucocephala and Moringa oleifera with the highest protein values. The energy value calculated for Moringa oleifera, Leucaena leucocephala and Caesalpinia glabatra presented moringa as the species that contributes the highest energy value to cattle. The energy estimates that fresh forage and dry matter produce in catle, for Moringa oleifera, the highest amount of kg/meat/day and the highest amount of l/ milk/day. The Caesalpinia glabatra species proved to be the forage species with the highest yield and animal load in adult bovine units per hectare. © 2022, UCOPress.

AB  - Tetrastigma harmandii Planch. is utilized for culinary and medicinal purposes in the Philippines. However, its growing conditions, nutritional composition and asexual propagation are less known. Hence, this study characterized the growing environment of T. harmandii in northeastern Cagayan, Philippines and determined its proximate and nutrient compositions through proximate and elemental analyses, respectively. Asexual propagation was also done wherein T. harmandii stem cuttings (one, two and three nodes) with and without auxin (α-NAA) were propagated for 33 days inside the rooting bins. Results revealed that the species grows in various habitats such as hills, coastal areas, residential and agricultural land, grasslands, bodies of water, caves and secondary growth forests in 18-181 masl elevations. It was also found to thrive in moderately acidic soils with medium organic matter and high nutrient contents. The species grows mostly together with Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium. Moreover, the leaves of the plant have high crude fiber (5.20%), potassium (3.28%) and iron (207 ppm). The propagation of the plant using three-node stem cuttings without auxin application showed better survival (97.78%) and rooting (86.67%). Compared with one-node stem cutting, improved rooting was observed in the two-node (1.68 more roots and 0.30 denser roots) and three-node (2.92 more roots and 0.14 denser roots) stem cuttings. Hence, T. harmandii is easy to root when propagated asexually; better rooting can be achieved through three-node stem cuttings without auxin application. © 2022 Mindanao Journal of Science and Technology.

AB  - Safety issues on the residual effect of pesticides and their metabolites on fruits and vegetables are of utmost importance. Synthetic pesticides remain in fruit and vegetables after harvest causing great health hazards to the consumers. Field studies were conducted on the evaluation of Leucaena leucocephala leaves as an alternative to the use of synthetic nematicide, while possible residues of carbofuran in tomato fruits were also analysed. Acetone, methanol and petroleum ether fractions of the leaves of L. leucocephala were applied at 200 mg/mL in variants of 100 mL, 150 mL and 200 mLto a naturally nematode infested field. Comparison was made with carbofuran a synthetic nematicide. Samples of tomato fruits from carbofuran treated and untreated beds were extracted with ethyl acetate for residual pesticide analysis to ascertain the exceedance of the maximum residue limit (MRL). Results revealed that pesticide residue was significantly (P=0.05) higher in plots treated with carbofuran compared with standard MRL for carbofuran in tomatoes. Crude extracts of L. leucocephala were as effective as carbofuran, while the fraction was however significantly better in producing more numbers of fruits and reduced nematode population in root and soil. © 2021, Nematological Society of India.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae), popularly known as 'leucena,' is an exotic and perennial legume widely used for urban afforestation, the recovery of degraded areas, the production of wood, firewood, forage, and organic fertilizer. Clinical studies have shown that L. leucocephala has antineoplastic, antiviral, anticoagulant, antithrombotic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and immunostimulant activities. Its medicinal properties are associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, galactomannans, and sulfated polysaccharides. In vitro culture is a biotechnological tool that can be used for the preservation of L. leucocephala, and callus culture corresponds to a technique for obtaining bioactive compounds of medicinal interest in vitro. This work aimed to develop a protocol for in vitro germination and callus induction with the potential for the production of phenolic compounds. For seed germination, Murashige and Skoog medium and Wood Plant Medium were used, in concentrations of 50% and 100%, and for callus induction, leaf segments were placed on 50% WPM medium supplemented with different concentrations of BAP (0; 4.44; 8.88; 17.75 μM) and 2,4-D (0; 4.52; 9.05, 18.10 μM), in the presence and absence of light. The production of phenolic compounds was evaluated by the total phenols and flavonoids using standard methodologies. A higher percentage of germination was observed in 50% WPM (74%), which also provided the formation of seedlings with a higher total phenol and flavonoid content. Callus induced with 2,4-D in the presence of light had a high phenolic content. These results indicated that L. leucocephala calli are promising biotechnological products for obtaining phenolic compounds in vitro. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc..

TI  - Apparent digestibility and nutritional composition of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) leaf meal incorporated in the diets of Black Australorp and Potchefstroom Koekoek chicken breeds
PY  - 2021

AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the apparent digestibility and nutrient composition of Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM) inclusion in Black Australorp and Potchefstroom Koekoek diets. Tender and mature leaves were separately harvested from 10 individual trees and stored separately for chemical analyses. The leaves were air-dried in a well-ventilated laboratory to constant weight and milled to pass through a 1-mm sieve. A mixture of tender and mature leaves was also collected to produce a bulk leaf meal. The four iso-nitrogenous dietary treatments were 0 (control), 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5% of LLM, respectively. The apparent digestibility of two chicken breeds was also evaluated. The dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), ether extract (EE), cellulose and hemicellulose of the samples did not differ between tender and mature leaves. Tender leaves had higher (P < 0.05) calcium, potassium, magnesium and sodium concentration than mature leaves. Crude protein and mimosine content were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in tender than in mature leaves. The inclusion levels of L. leucocephala leaf meal affect (P < 0.05) acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and crude protein (CP) digestibility. Crude protein digestibility decreases as the inclusion levels of L. leucocephala increase. Both tender and mature L. leucocephala leaves have a potential nutritional value that can be used in feedstuff and can be used as a protein supplement for Black Australorp and Potchefstroom Koekoek chicken breeds. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - For the estimation of genetic diversity and population structure, 23 accessions of Leucaena leucocephala were characterized using morphological and molecular markers. A medium to high degree of genetic variability was calculated among these accessions based on eight quantitative traits. Furthermore, a cluster analysis based on morphological characteristics grouped the 23 Leucaena accessions into five groups based on their similarities. Furthermore, the principal component analysis revealed that eight quantitative traits contributed for 82.57% of the total variability. Eleven simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers showed a high degree of polymorphism among the 23 L. leucocephala accessions. The polymorphic information contents (PIC) for these 11 markers were estimated and revealed that SSR723 had higher PIC value (0.90). Also, the dendrogram generated based on 11 markers distinctively demarcated most of the L. leucocephala accessions into different clusters indicating its vast genetic diversity in the population. A population structure study of these 23 L. leucocephala accessions showed the existence of two gene pools. Also, analysis of molecular variance showed that there was 13% variability between populations, while there was 87% variability within the population. The first and second coordinates of principal coordinate analysis unconditionally distributed these accessions into four coordinates based on their similarity. Overall, the high degree of genetic variability described by morphological and molecular markers in L. leucocephala can be used as a basic tool for assessing genetic diversity and linkage mapping in Leucaena genetic improvement programs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In the present study, the nutritional values and in vitro rumen parameters of three browse forages (Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Cajanus cajan (CC) and Khaya senegalensis (KS)) and five grasses (Andropogon gayanus (AG), Panicum maximum C1 local (PMCL), Panicum maximum C1 ameliorate (PMCA), Pennisetum purpureum (PP), and Brachiaria ruziziensis (BR)) grown in the Republic of Benin were investigated. With this aim, it was determined dry matter (DM), ash, acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), metabolizable energy (ME), dry matter intake (DMI), dry matter digestibility (DMD) and relative feed value (RFV) as nutritive values, gas production (GP), methane production (MP), organic matter digestibility (OMD) as in vitro rumen fermentation parameters. Strained and anaerobically prepared rumen fluid was used for determining GP and OMD. Additionally, the correlations between chemical composition and fermentation characteristics were studied. The samples were collected in two rangeland areas in the Republic of Benin. The lowest and highest ADF contents were determined for CC (30.85%) and PMCA (43.14%). The lowest NDF content was found for CC (48.62%). The highest GP (33.8%) and ME (6.85 MJ/kg DM) have been determined for BR. The CC had the highest DMD (64.9%) and RFV (124.1). The lowest MP (mL) was recorded in PMCA, whereas the highest MP was recorded in AG. The crude protein (CP) content of forages was positively correlated with OMD, DMD, DMI, and RFV, while NDF was negatively correlated with GP, MP, OMD, DMD, DMI, and RFV. However, ADF was negatively correlated with GP, DMD, DMI, and RFV, whereas positively with ME. These results show that all the plant materials used in the present study can be used as alternative forage sources in ruminant rations. © 2022 TUBITAK. All rights reserved.

AB  - The existence of green open space becomes important along with the decline in environmental quality. The University of Sumatera Utara (USU) campus, as one of the city's green open spaces, is expected to be able to minimize negative impacts of increasing levels of pollution. For this reason, it is necessary to select tree species to maximize the function of green open spaces. The purpose of this research was to identify the Fabaceae family's stomata characteristics, which included the type, length, thickness, and its density. To determine stomata characteristics, the epidermal layer of the leaves was perforated using nail polish. The results showed that all of observed trees had paracytic stomata with a random distribution pattern. The longest stomata was found in Erythrina crista that reached 20.15 µm in length, while the shortest stomata was found in Intsia bijuga and reached 12.36 µm in length. Tamarindus indica had the widest stomata, reaching 2.59 µm in width, while Pithecellobium dulce variegate have had smallest, at 7.74 µm in width. Peltophorum pterocarpum had the highest density at 718.68µm, while Leucaena leucocephala have had lowest density at 94/ µm2. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Since Cattle introduced in Semi Area of East Nusa Tenggara (ENT), Bali Cattle in Timor Island is considered as the most productive cattle in terms of population. In the last 10 years Bali cattle in West Timor (Indonesia) is around 550,000 - 980,000 head, however the quality/performance of Bali cattle is considered degraded and also native vegetation continuing depleted. Until recently, forage is the main limitation for cattle production in semi-arid region of Timor. This paper discusses cattle farming development in semi-arid region of ENT, how to address the forage shortage and farmers' response to the introduced cattle-forage innovations. The data and information were mainly taken from the collaboration research program of ACIAR and AIAT-NTT, particularly in Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Var. Tarramba) development. The study revealed that traditional cattle farming relies on grazing land and abandoned/fallow land during dry season for forage. Fattening systems practiced mainly in the area or farmers that have enough forage, particularly Leucaena. Farmer's plant Leucaena as part of local agroforestry and or integrated forage into maize farming as main strategy to overcome forage shortage problem. Farmers considered innovation related Leucaena as the best innovation/approach to improve cattle farming in semi-arid area. It is concluded that introduced forage legume, particularly Leucaena in semi-arid areas have increased carrying capacity of pastureland, improved soil fertility and decreased shifting cultivation or encourage more permanent crop land.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - More than 200 root-nodule bacterial strains were isolated from Leucaena leucocephala growing at 42 sampling sites across 12 states and three union territories of India. Genetic diversity was observed among 114 strains from various climatic zones; based on recA, these were identified as strains of Ensifer, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, and Bradyrhizobium. In multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) strains clustered into several novel clades and lineages. Ensifer were predominant nodulating genotype isolated from majority of alkaline soils, while Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium strains were isolated from a limited sampling in North-Eastern states with acidic soils. Positive nodulation assays of selected Ensifer representing different genetic combinations of housekeeping and sym genes suggested their broad host range within the closely related mimosoid genera Vachellia, Senegalia, Mimosa, and Prosopis. Leucaena selected diverse strains of Ensifer and Mesorhizobium as symbionts depending on available soil pH, climatic, and other edaphic conditions in India. Lateral gene transfer seems to play a major role in genetic diversification of Ensifer exhibited in terms of Old World vs. Neotropical genetic make-up and mixed populations at several sites. Although Neotropical Ensifer strains were most symbiotically effective on Leucaena, the native Ensifer are promiscuous and particularly well-adapted to a wide range of sampling sites with varied climates and edaphic factors. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Bioactive constituents from natural sources are of great interest as alternatives to synthetic compounds for the treatment of various diseases, including diabetes mellitus. In the present study, phytochemicals present in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit leaves were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and further examined by qualitative and quantitative methods. α-Amylase enzyme activity assays were performed and revealed that L. leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit leaf extract inhibited enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner, with efficacy similar to that of the standard α-amylase inhibitor acarbose. To determine which phytochemicals were involved in α-amylase enzyme inhibition, in silico virtual screening of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties was performed and pharmacophore dynamics were assessed. We identified hexadecenoic acid and oleic acid ((Z)-octadec-9-enoic acid) as α-amylase inhibitors. The binding stability of α-amylase to those two fatty acids was confirmed in silico by molecular docking and a molecular dynamics simulation performed for 100 ns. Together, our findings indicate that L. leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit-derived hexadecanoic acid and oleic acid are natural product-based antidiabetic compounds that can potentially be used to manage diabetes mellitus.  © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to find out the malic acid and fumaric acid content of commonly available forages for ruminants by gas chromatography (GC). Six samples of sixteen commonly available fodder crops from various places of Tamil Nadu used for feeding ruminants were collected, dried and stored in an airtight container for malic acid and fumaric acid estimation. There was no significant difference in malic acid and fumaric acid contents between grasses/ shrubs and tree fodders. Among grasses/ shrubs, Medicago sativa contained higher level of malic acid (0.596%) and Saccharum officinarum contained lower level of malic acid (0.162%). The malic acid content of other grasses/ shrubs was ranged from 0.217 to 0.313%. The Moringa oleifera (0.411%) had higher level of malic acid and Sesbania grandiflora (0.127%) had lower level of malic acid among tree fodders. The fumaric acid content was also highest in Medicago sativa (0.264%) and lowest in Pennisetum typhoides x Pennisetum purpureum (0.051%) in grasses/shrubs. Among tree fodders, Moringa oleifera also contained the maximum percentage of fumaric acid (0.182%) followed by Sesbania grandiflora (0.170%), Azadirachta indica (0.132%) and least in Leucaena leucocephala (0.062 %) and Acacia nilotica (0.041%). A trend was observed that the fumaric acid content was lower when compared to the malic acid content in all forages. It was concluded that the forages which contained higher level of malic acid and fumaric acid can safely be included in the ruminant ration to reduce methane emission and increase productivity. © 2021, Range Management Society of India.

AB  - Introduction: There is a vast data gap for the national and regional greenhouse gas (GHG) budget from different smallholder land utilization types in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) at large. Quantifying soil GHG, i.e., methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from smallholder land utilization types, is essential in filling the data gap. Methods: We quantified soil GHG emissions from different land utilization types in Western Kenya. We conducted a 26-soil GHG sampling campaign from the different land utilization types. The five land utilization types include 1) agroforestry M (agroforestry Markhamia lutea and sorghum), 2) sole sorghum (sorghum monocrop), 3) agroforestry L (Sorghum and Leucaena leucocephala), 4) sole maize (maize monocrop), and 5) grazing land. Results and discussion: The soil GHG fluxes varied across the land utilization types for all three GHGs (p ≤ 0.0001). We observed the lowest CH4 uptake under grazing land (−0.35 kg CH4–C ha−1) and the highest under sole maize (−1.05 kg CH4–C ha−1). We recorded the lowest soil CO2 emissions under sole maize at 6,509.86 kg CO2–Cha−1 and the highest under grazing land at 14,400.75 kg CO2–Cha−1. The results showed the lowest soil N2O fluxes under grazing land at 0.69 kg N2O–N ha−1 and the highest under agroforestry L at 2.48 kg N2O–N ha−1. The main drivers of soil GHG fluxes were soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, soil moisture, clay content, and root production. The yield-scale N2O fluxes ranged from 0.35 g N2O–N kg−1 under sole maize to 4.90 g N2O–N kg−1 grain yields under agroforestry L. Nevertheless, our findings on the influence of land utilization types on soil GHG fluxes and yield-scaled N2O emissions are within previous studies in SSA, including Kenya, thus fundamental in filling the national and regional data of emissions budget. The findings are pivotal to policymakers in developing low-carbon development across land utilization types for smallholders farming systems.

AB  - Turbidity is removed by adding a chemical coagulant, which produces a secondary toxic of alumina residues in the water. Therefore, the aim of study was to evaluate the coagulation activity of NaCl extract from Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania grandiflora seeds on the removal of turbidity for water purification. The proximate composition of the seeds was determined. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to identify the functional groups of protein, and the surface morphology was observed by SEM-EDS. To obtain the optimized condition, all experiments were evaluated by artificial turbid water before being applied on the natural water (i.e., Selokan Mataram). The coagulation process was evaluated by concentration (M), dosage (mL/L), and pH in terms of turbidity, total dissolved solids, and transmittance of light. The results showed that both coagulant seeds contained 25.32 and 30.81% of protein. These coagulants could remove the turbidity by 99.7% for L. leucocephala and 94.24% for S. grandiflora from artificial turbid water at the optimized concentration of 1.0 M, and dosage of 5 and 10 mL/L, respectively. At pH 5 the removal of turbidity from Selokan Mataram was 99.4% for L. leucocephala and 97.23% for S. grandiflora. © 2022 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

TI  - Effects of browse legume species addition on nutritional composition, fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability of Opuntia cladodes silage
PY  - 2022

AB  - Forage legumes are commonly used as an absorbent additive in high-moisture silages. Thus this study was carried out to assess the nutritive value, fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability of Opuntia–legume browse mixed silages. Five browse legume species (Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia mellifera, Searsia lancea, Prosopis velutina, and Grewia flava) were mixed with Opuntia cladodes. The silage mixture was formulated at a ratio of 60 Opuntia cladodes: 40 leguminous browse species and ensiled in polythene bags and kept in a laboratory for 42 days to determine chemical composition and fermentation characteristics. Silage samples were also subjected to an aerobic stability test. One-way analysis of variance in a completely randomised design was used to analyse the data. The pH values for silages made from Opuntia cladodes with L. leucocephala, A. mellifera and G. flava were lower than 4.8, which is considered an indicator of good-quality silage. The water-soluble carbohydrates content of silages made with Opuntia cladodes and S. lancea and G. flava was within the range of 8–12 g/kg dry matter, which is sufficient for good fermentation. The highest CO2 production, which signifies poor aerobic stability, was recorded for the control silage (Opuntia) compared to all Opuntia–legume mixed silage treatments. The addition of legume browse leaf-meal to Opuntia cladodes improved nutritive value, fermentation characteristics, and silage quality. Therefore, despite some limitations, Opuntia–legume browse silages, particularly Opuntia–G. flava and Opuntia–L. leucocephala, proved to be beneficial for livestock, as they meet the nutritional requirement of a ruminant. Significance: This study underlines the importance of co-ensiling Opuntia cladodes and high protein legume browse hay to offer an alternative feeding strategy for ruminant livestock and ensure sustainable provision of high-quality feed during dry periods. © 2022 Academy of Science of South Africa.

AB  - The AgNPs were synthesized using water-soluble polysaccharides extracted from the Leucaena leucocephala seeds. The UV-visible spectrum of the AgNPs showed a sharp absorption peak at 448 nm. The XRD analysis showed four major peaks of the crystalline AgNPs with planes of a face-centered cubic lattice of silver. The EDS spectrum showed a strong signal peak at 3 keV. TEM and SEM observations showed the spherical shape of AgNPs with no particle agglomeration, and the size ranged from 8 to 20 nm. AgNPs were highly stable at -14.2 mV by zeta potential measurement. AgNPs showed significant anticancer activity against the cell lines of breast cancer, liver carcinoma, and colon carcinoma with the IC50 value of 22.5, 12.3, and 8.9 μg mL-1, respectively. AgNPs at 900 μg mL-1 exhibited considerable antifungal activity against ten fungal pathogens. Water-soluble polysaccharide has the ability to synthesize AgNPs keeping strong antitumor, antifungal activities. The AgNPs can slow down spoilage of composite milk samples at different temperatures. In addition, the accuracy of milk-IR-analyses was not affected by different concentrations of AgNPs.  © 2022 Mohamed A. Taher et al.

AB  - Iron (Fe) is a micro essential needed by plants in small amounts and can be toxic when available in large quantities. This study aimed to evaluate how Fe exposure affects the growth of C. callothyrsus and L. leucocephala seedlings. This study used a completely randomized design with factorial, where the first factor consisted of two levels of seedlings (C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala), and the second factor consisted of Fe concentration which consisted of 8 levels (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 mM). The results showed that treatment of seedlings species and concentration of Fe was able to significantly affect the growth parameters (height, root length, root dry weight, shoots, and plant dry weight) of seedlings. The control treatment (without Fe) showed the highest growth response compared to those treated with Fe exposure and an increase in Fe concentration was able to reduce all growth parameters in both seedlings. The 0.5 mM Fe concentration reduced all growth parameters of C. calothyrsus drastically, while in L. leucocephala, the Fe 0.75 concentration was able to decrease all growth parameters drastically. The tolerance index of both seedlings decreased with increasing Fe concentration. The rate of photosynthesis did not show a significant difference between treatments, meanwhile, it had a significant effect on chlorophyll affect chlorophyll (a, b, and total chlorophyll) and carotenoid content. The highest Fe content in C. calothyrsus seedlings was at a concentration of 1.5 mM (4.40%), while in L. leucocephala seedlings, the highest Fe content was at 1.7 mM (2.87%). © 2021, J.

AB  - Despite several studies, role of eco-restoration strategies involving trees and grasses on soil organic carbon pools and fractions, response of soil enzymes in degraded land of tropical climate has remain largely overlooked. Four native fast growing fodder trees, namely, Ficus infectoria, Morus alba, Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala with combination of grasses viz., Cenchrus ciliaris, Chrysopogon fulvus and Panicum maximum were used as eco-restoration tool in Bundelkhand region. Total organic carbon (TOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), and activities of important soil enzymes were measured. After 9 years, land under Ficus, Morus, Acacia and Leucaena had ~63, 105, 87 and 81% greater TOC than fallow land in surface layer and Cenchrus, Panicum, and Chrysopogon increased TOC by 84, 91 and 77% at surface layers, respectively, over fallow land. MBC increased by 2–2.5 folds in both soil layers. All C fractions responded positively to eco-restoration. Ficus, Morus, Acacia and Leucaena boosted up carbon management index (CMI) by 51, 84, 71 and 65% at surface layers, respectively over fallow land. Similarly, grasses also improved CMI by >60%. Soil organic carbon accumulation under Ficus, Morus, Acacia and Leucaena were ~ 55, 91, 77 and 71% higher than fallow land at surface layers, and 71, 85, 95 and 69% higher than fallow land at subsurface soil layers. We developed an index for comparing ecorestoration efficiency (ERE). We found Morus + Panicum, Acaia + Panicum to be effective restoration strategies for eco-restoration under degraded lands of tropical climates. Our study indicated that implementation of these ecological restoration strategies could be a quantitatively important component of national climate change mitigation strategies in India and thus should be continually paid a great attention. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural coagulants from plants resources have gained a lot of attention as it is renewable, biodegradable, non-hazardous, lower cost, and less sludge generated compared to chemical coagulants. However there are still some drawbacks, namely long settling time and possible increase of dissolved organic carbon in the treated water. In this paper we tried to address these drawbacks by utilizing citrate modified Fe3O4 to adsorb protein from Leucaena leucocephala as the active coagulating agent. The effect of trisodium citrate concentration and protein adsorption pH to the adsorbed protein was investigated. It was found that the trisodium citrate concentration of 0.5 M and pH 4.0 gave the highest protein adsorption. The obtained magnetic coagulant was furthermore characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray Diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy to observe the characteristics before and after protein adsorption. Furthermore, the effect of pH (2 to 10) and coagulant dosage (60 to 600 mg L− 1) to the removal of synthetic Congo red wastewater and sludge volume formation was investigated. It was found that pH 3 was the best pH for coagulation due to charge neutralization mechanism of leucaena protein. Furthermore the highest removal was obtained at dosage 420 mg L− 1 with 80% removal. This result was comparable with crude extract of leucaena with half settling time (20 min) and lower increase of permanganate value, indicating lower increase of dissolved organics in the treated water. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigated the potential for tolerance, absorption, and translocation of iron (Fe) by Leucaena leucocephala, as well as the response of the photosynthetic mechanism and the phytoremediation potential of L. leucocephala grown in soil with concentrations of Fe (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg Fe/dm3 of soil). The chlorophyll content and the photosynthetic apparatus showed a significant difference between treatments: the chlorophyll content, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance were higher in the treatment 200 mg Fe/dm3 of soil, while the photosynthetic rate was higher in the treatment 500 mg Fe/dm3 of soil in relation to the control. From 300 mg Fe/dm3 of soil onward, there was a significant reduction in the number of leaves, mass, and biomass of L. leucocephala. The species is tolerant to the Fe doses analyzed. Availability of Fe in the soil after the cultivation of L. leucocephala decreased, evidencing the plant capacity of Fe absorption, which accumulated mostly in the roots, and only % of Fe was translocated to the shoots. The highest Fe accumulation per biomass was 9.48 mg, at 200 mg Fe/dm3 of soil. The amount of Fe translocated and accumulated in L. leucocephala is directly related to its biomass production thus the dose 200 mg Fe/dm3 of soil allows the best performance of phytoremediation potential. Although plant growth is affected by treatments of 300, 400 and 500 mg Fe/dm3 of soil and Fe accumulation is less, L. leucocephala is able to tolerate and phytostabilize soil Fe with potential for use in phytoremediation, mainly because it is a kind of phytostabilization of Fe. © 2021 SAAB

AB  - In the wake of climate change and global warming, the production systems of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) are receiving increasing attention in the tropics, where the silvopastoral systems can improve animal welfare and production conditions. The objective of this study was to characterize the behavior of heifer buffaloes in a silvopastoral system (SPS) with Leucaena leucocephala (600 trees/ha) and in a conventional system (CVS), under intense heat stress and moderate heat stress in Cuba. We observed nine animals, with an average weight of 167.9 kg at the beginning of the study, during the daylight period, from 6:00 to 18:00 h, at 10 min intervals, for 12 days. Activities recorded were grazing, ingestion of tree leaves, rumination, water intake, walking, lying, standing, sheltering in the shade of trees, and wallowing. Sheltering in the shade of trees and wallowing were collectively considered as thermoregulatory behavior (TB). TB was different in both systems and conditions of heat stress (p < 0.05), with 4.06 in CVS and 3.81 h in SPS in the intense heat stress period, while it was 2.91 and 1.08 h for SPS and CVS, respectively, during the moderate heat stress period. The wallowing activity showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in the intense heat stress season with 1.18 and 2.35 h for SPS and CVS, respectively. Time spent on feeding behavior was highest in the SPS system (p < 0.05). Longer times of thermoregulatory and feeding behavior indicate the importance of trees in animal welfare for this species in tropical conditions, thus supporting avoided deforestation and the replanting of trees in existing production systems and landscapes. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Rapid urban development leads to changes of vegetation community structure in the riparian zone. Research on tree community structure has been done at 3 location points of Ciliwung riparian zone in Depok-South Jakarta with different habitat condition. Habitat at location 1 is known to be natural, habitat at location 2 has undergone land use conversion, and habitat at location 3 has undergone river bank concretization. This study aimed to compare tree community structure in the 3 locations. We used plot method for data sampling. A total of 4 plots at each location with size of 20x20 m were determined purposively. The results showed that the 3 locations showed differences in the tree community structure. Compositions of tree at location 1, 2, and 3 respectively consists of 11 species in 8 families, 14 species in 10 families, and 4 species in 4 families. Overall, all three locations have low to moderate level of tree diversity (H' 1.26-2.3) and high level of tree evenness (E 0.81-0.90).

TI  - Key characteristics for facilitating Leucaena leucocephala to successfully invade pioneer communities of tropical rain forests
PY  - 2020

AB  - Aims Due to fast-growing and high drought stress tolerance, Leucaena leucocephala has been widely used for afforestation in degraded tropical forests worldwide, but it is also a global invasive exotic species. Studies have shown that fast-growing can help L. leucocephala successfully invade subtropical forests. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether fast-growing and high drought stress tolerance can help L. leucocephala invade tropical rain forests.Methods The pioneer community of tropical rain forest which had been invaded by L. leucocephala in the Baopoling Mountain, Sanya, China was the research object. Through the t-test, we compared the differences in key functional traits that were related to growth rate (photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate) and drought stress tolerance (leaf turgor loss point) in both wet and dry seasons between L. leucocephala and eight dominant native species of pioneer community of tropical rain forest. And the principal component analysis (PCA) was used to investigate whether these functional traits can best discriminate between Leucaena leucocephala and the eight dominant native species.Important findings Leucaena leucocephala could be invariably growing fast (photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate much higher than native species) from wet to dry seasons and had higher drought stress tolerance (leaf turgor loss point much lower than native species) in the dry season. The results of PCA showed that these functional traits could significantly discriminate between L. leucocephala and the eight dominant native species. Therefore, invariable fast-growing from wet to dry season and high drought stress tolerance in the dry season make L. leucocephala successfully invade pioneer communities of tropical rain forests. In the future, these functional traits can be used to select many native species to perform biological control of L. leucocephala in other tropical forests. © 2020 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology.

AB  - Biogas is an excellent renewable fuel providing gas for clean energy applications and fertilizers for organic farming. In the present study, seeds from four tree species of Acacia nilotica, Albizia lebbeck, Prosopis juliflora, and Leucaena leucocephala have been utilized for biogas production as alternative feedstocks. They have been investigated in a mixed-feeding mode in a single digester to tackle the feedstock availability and seasonality challenges. The investigations were conducted in a 300 ​L anaerobic digester for 120 days under daily feeding mode. The average specific biogas yield and specific methane yield was found to be 0.425 ​m3/kg of volatile solids and 0.228 ​m3/kg of volatile solids, respectively. The average volumetric methane content in biogas was 54.7%. This paper presents a unique study on anaerobic digestion of selected seeds in a mixed-feeding mode to provide broad opportunities for their efficient and sustainable utilization. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Chitosan was extracted from Leucaena leucocephala (LL) pods collected from three locations in west coast Malaysia. The primary objectives of this study were to extract and characterized the extracted chitosan pectin from LL pods. Besides that, the physicochemical properties of extracted chitosan were determined and compared with the commercial chitosan. Chitosan A extracted from LL pods gave a higher percentage of yield compared to chitosan B, 70.9% and 67.6%, respectively. Besides that, the color analysis and whiteness index of both extracted chitosan were evaluated. From the data obtained, chitosan B has higher whiteness index, which is 61.6% and chitosan A was only 48.5%. Based on this study, it can be concluded that decolorization treatment with method B produced chitosan with a higher percentage of whiteness index compared to decolorization treatment with method A. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Traditional medicinal plants used by the Mon people in Myanmar
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091379177&doi=10.1016%2fj.jep.2020.113253&partnerID=40&md5=8bb5ae312048c36c4229c209b60a99f7
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Myanmar's Mon people largely depend on a traditional medical system for health care, however, information about their medical plants is rare in the current literature. In this first ethnobotanical study of Mon traditional medicinal plants (MTMs), we attempt to answer three research questions: 1) What species are used as MTMs by the Mon people and what diseases can be treated with these MTMs? 2) What are the general characteristics of these MTMs? 3) Which species and their usages have high consensus of knowledge? Aim of the study: We aimed (1) to document both the diversity of medicinal plants used by the Mon people and their knowledge of the therapeutic usages of these plants; and (2) to quantitatively identify the most well-known medicinal plant species and prevalent diseases treated by these species, and to evaluate the status of scientific research and application for each of these species. Materials and methods: Ethnobotanical surveys and interviews were carried out in 10 villages in four townships of Mon State, Myanmar in 2018. Data were collected from interviews with 131 informants, chosen via the snowball sampling method. Therapeutic uses of medicinal plants were categorized according to the ICPC-2 standard. Voucher specimens of plant species were collected and identified by experts. To evaluate the consensus of knowledge, we applied use reports (URs) using the R package of ethnobotanyR. Results: In total, we recorded 158 medicinal plant species belonging to 64 families as being used by the Mon people, with 13 species being newly recorded as medicinal plants in Myanmar. The people listed 78 therapeutic uses for these plants, which could be classified into 16 ICPC-2 disease categories. Digestive, urological and respiratory diseases ranked as the most prevalent diseases based on use reports. Fabaceae was the most represented family and the leaf was the most commonly used plant part. Decoction and oral administration ranked top in preparation and administration methods, respectively. Tinospora sinensis (Lour.) Merr, the introduced species Chromolaena odorata (L.) R. M. King & H. Rob., Mimosa pudica L., Tadehagi triquetrum (L.) H. Ohashi, and Alysicarpus vaginalis (L.) DC were the five most cited medicinal plant species, and were used to treat dysuria, cuts and wounds, cough, diabetes and gall stones respectively, with high consensus. Conclusion: The Mon people of Myanmar have a rich and diverse knowledge of traditional medicinal plants. The list of medicinal plants in Myanmar can be renewed, with the addition of 13 species. MTMs still function as an important component of the health care of the Mon people in Myanmar, and a systematic documentation of the local knowledge of MTMs would be of great value in the future. Resource monitoring, phytochemical and pharmacological research and evidence-based drug development are suggested to promote the use of MTMs and aid drug discovery. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Salt stress is one of the serious abiotic stressors which limit the growth and development of important crops in agricultural lands. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been implemented as a strategy to mitigate the adverse effects due to an impact of salt stress through the structural and physiological adjustment. This study aimed to determine a relationship between salinity levels (0, 150, 300, and 450 mM NaCl) and AMF treatments (Glomus manihotis, Glomus etunicatum, and G. manihotis + G. etunicatum) to the salt tolerance of Leucaena leucocephala seedlings in a greenhouse. Salinity reduced the plant height, biomass, and root colonization by AMF. However, the inoculation of AMF, especially the consortium, ameliorated the negative effects by stabilizing the growth performance and supporting the photosynthetic outputs through optimum nutrient and mineral absorptions. These results were indicative through a significant interaction between salinity levels and the types of AMF treatment in all parameters except in the total leaf protein and proline contents from the two-way ANOVA results. Root colonization was highly correlated with the plant height, biomass, and total carbohydrate content with a maximum contribution conferred by the AMF consortium, based on Pearson's correlation coefficient test and PCA analysis. Our study then showed the positive impact of AMF toward salt tolerance by L. leucocephala with potential application and cultivation in salt-stressed ecosystems. © 2021 Delvian Delvian and Adrian Hartanto.

TI  - Determinants of Host Range Specificity in Legume-Rhizobia Symbiosis
PY  - 2020

AB  - Leguminous plants possess the almost unique ability to enter symbiosis with soil-resident, nitrogen fixing bacteria called rhizobia. During this symbiosis, the bacteria physically colonize specialized organs on the roots of the host plant called nodules, where they reduce atmospheric nitrogen into forms that can be assimilated by the host plant and receive photosynthates in return. In order for nodule development to occur, there is extensive chemical cross-talk between both parties during the formative stages of the symbiosis. The vast majority of the legume family are capable of forming root nodules and typically rhizobia are only able to fix nitrogen within the context of this symbiotic association. However, many legume species only enter productive symbiosis with a few, or even single rhizobial species or strains, and vice-versa. Permitting symbiosis with only rhizobial strains that will be able to fix nitrogen with high efficiency is a crucial strategy for the host plant to prevent cheating by rhizobia. This selectivity is enforced at all stages of the symbiosis, with partner choice beginning during the initial communication between the plant and rhizobia. However, it can also be influenced even once nitrogen-fixing nodules have developed on the root. This review sets out current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms employed by both parties to influence host range during legume-rhizobia symbiosis. © Copyright © 2020 Walker, Lagunas and Gifford.

TI  - Chemical and in vitro evaluation of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) Leaves as a Substitute of Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) with/without Rejected Green Banana Fruits (Musa paradisiaca)
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123233650&doi=10.54203%2fscil.2021.wvj86&partnerID=40&md5=220dec563318db32da39d1083173a528
AB  - Leucaena leaves and rejected green banana fruits can be promising to cope with feed gaps in arid and semi-arid Mediterranean regions. The present study evaluated the feeding value and secondary active compounds of Leucaena leaves and rejected green banana fruits for ruminants using a semi-automated gas production (GP) system. Comparisons were made with the traditional feeds as alfalfa, and Dichanthium spp. grass hay. Analysis of HPLC was performed for the feed ingredients to characterize the main phenolic components. The in vitro evaluation was carried out for the experimental feed ingredients and diets. Four diets were formulated as the first diet consisted of alfalfa and grass hay at a ratio of 35:65 (AG), the second diet composed of alfalfa, grass hay, and green banana fruits at a ratio of 35:55:10 (AGB), third and fourth diets were prepared by replacing alfalfa in AG and AGB with Leucaena leaves to be LG and LGB, respectively. Leucaena leaves showed a high content of valuable phenolic components that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, such as gallic acid, ellagic acid, and naringenin. Moreover, Leucaena leaves and diet had higher crude protein, total phenols, and total tannins than alfalfa, which was reflected on the chemical composition of diets, and recorded the lowest total accumulative GP at 24 hours leading to low CH4 and CO2 production. Banana fruits recorded the lowest ruminal pH, ammonia concentration, and degraded neutral detergent fiber, compared to other feed ingredients, while it had the highest GP and degraded organic matter. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use Leucaena leaves in animals' diets with/without rejected green banana fruits as an alternative feed resource with potential environmental and animal health benefits. © 2021.

AB  - This study was performed to investigate the effect of replacing alfalfa hay by L. leucocephala leaves in proportions of 25, 50 and 100% on in vitro gas production (GP) parameter, digestibility and in situ degradability in buffalo. Results showed that the volume of GP at 2 to 12 hours after incubation was significantly affected by replacing alfalfa hay with L. leucocephala leaves. In vitro digestibility of organic matter (OMD) differed significantly between treatment as it declined by increasing the alfalfa hay substitution rate from 25 to 100%. The microbial crude protein (MCP) differed significantly between treatments and was the greatest of 589 and 599 mg g-1 of dry matter (DM) when L. leucocephala leaves replaced alfalfa hay at 25 and 50%. The in vitro digestibility of DM (IVDMD) increased significantly at 50% L. leucocephala replacement rate. Moreover, substituting alfalfa hay by L. leucocephala had a significant effect on the in situ degradability parameters. The insoluble but potentially degradable fraction (B) and potential of degradability (A+B) significantly increased for treatment contain 50% L. leucocephala leaves. The effective degradability (ED) was significantly different between dietary treatments and was the greatest when alfalfa hay was replaced by 25 and 50% L. leucocephala. In conclusion, L. leucocephala leaves can substitute 25 to 50% of dietary alfalfa hay in buffalo rations without effect on rumen efficiency. © 2021, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

TI  - Nutraceutical properties of Leucaena leucocephala, Manihot esculenta, Cajanus cajan and a foliage blend in goat kids infected with Haemonchus contortus

AB  - Protein and condensed tannin-rich foliage (TRF) are potentially useful as nutraceuticals. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the diet and anthelmintic properties of three TRF types both individually and in combination. We hypothesized that synergistic or antagonistic effects on feed and anthelmintic values related to associations between TRF types may occur. Nutritional and anthelmintic characteristics of Leucaena leucocephala, Manihot esculenta, Cajanus cajan and a mixture of the compounds were evaluated using alfalfa pellets as a control. TRF ingredients were combined with Dichantium hay (48 and 52% of dry matter intake respectively) in mixed diets were consumed by Creole goat kids. Measurements were carried out in animals without parasites and in animals artificially infected with Haemonchus contortus. Individual feed intake and the digestibility of each diet was measured along with kid growth. There were no significant differences between the growth rates of pre-infected animals and animals fed mixed diets that included alfalfa. A strong anthelmintic activity is observed with Leucaena leucocephala contrary to other TRFs. This work confirms variable dietary and anthelmintic properties of TRF. The combination of TRF did not have synergistic or antagonistic effects on feed value or the anthelmintic potential of TRF. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - A Trait-Based Protocol for the Biological Control of Invasive Exotic Plant Species

AB  - Selecting appropriate native species for the biological control of invasive exotic plants is a recurring challenge for conservationists, ecologists, and land managers. Recently developed trait-based approaches may be an effective means of overcoming this challenge. However, we lack a protocol and software platform that can be used to quickly and effectively select potential native plant species for performing biological control of the invasive exotic plant species. Here, our study introduces a protocol and a software program that can be used for trait-based selection of appropriate native plant species for performing biocontrol of invasive exotic plant species. In particular, we illustrate the effectiveness of this software program and protocol by identifying native species that can be used for the biological control of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, a highly invasive plant species found in many parts of the world. Bougainvillea spectabilis was the only native species selected by our software program as a potential biocontrol agent for L. leucocephala. When separately planting 4 seedlings of B. spectabilis and two unselected species (Bombax ceiba, and Ficus microcarpa) as neighbors of each individual of L. leucocephala for 3 years, we found that B. spectabilis, which was functionally similar to the invasive L. leucocephala, significantly limited the invasion of the latter, while the unselected native plant species could not. That was because all the seedling of B. spectabilis survived, while half seedlings of unselected species (B. ceiba and F. microcarpa) died, during the experimental period when planted with L. leucocephala seedlings. Moreover, the growth of L. leucocephala was restricted when planted with B. spectabilis, in contrast B. ceiba and F. microcarpa did not influence the growth of L. leucocephala. Overall, our software program and protocol can quickly and efficiently select native plant species for use in the biological control of invasive exotic plant species. We expect that this work will provide a general protocol to perform biological control of many different types of invasive exotic plant species. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Jiang, Zhao, Xing, Ge, Cui, Liu and Wang.

AB  - Deep ravines along the Chambal river represent the worst form of land degradation by runoff water. Performance of seven tree species in terms of growth, biomass production, carbon stock (CS) and soil properties was observed after 8 years of plantation tree species and rejuvenation of natural vegetation (NV) on the degraded ravine land. The ravine area was treated with embankment type water harvesting structures (WHS) targeting complete control of runoff and support the vegetation. The total biomass CS was significantly higher in A. nilotica (13.44 Mg ha-1) followed by A. indica (8.97 Mg ha-1) and lowest in A. catechu (3.17 Mg ha-1). The soil CS was significantly higher in L. leucocephala (4.67 Mg ha-1) followed by A. indica (4.62 Mg ha-1) and lowest in A. catechu (3.86 Mg ha-1). Similarly in NV, higher biomass and CS were recorded with small trees followed by grasses, shrubs, climbers, and herbs. Under A. nilotica afforestation with NV, the highest mean annual CS rate was found to be 2.46 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Tree plantation of L. leucocephala led to maximum improvement of organic carbon (OC), water holding capacity (WHC) and a sum of all macronutrient availability followed by A. indica, D. sissoo and A. nilotica in treated ravine land. Combined ranking in terms of survival, height, the diameter of stumped height (DSH) and biomass yield showed that the preferred choice for tree species was in the order of Acacia nilotica > Azadirachta indica > Prosopis juliflora > Leucaena leucocephala > Balanitesa egyptiaca > Dalbergia sissoo > Acacia catechu. © 2021, Range Management Society of India.

AB  - Synthesis of silver nanoparticles, as potential mercury metal detection, using Lamtoro Pods extracts has been successfully carried out by the green reduction method. The peak spectrum of plasmon resonance (SPR) at 415 nm confirmed the formation of silver nanoparticles. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) test obtained a characteristic functional group vibration spectrum in Lamtoro Pods. A shift of wavenumber was distinguished by comparing the FTIR spectrum between Lamtoro pods extract and silver nanoparticles. This indicated the involvement of phenol and flavonoid compounds found in the Lamtoro act as a reducing agent of Ag+ to Ag0 (silver nanoparticles). The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) pattern showed that the material synthesized as silver nanoparticles. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization showed that the nanoparticles have an average size 15.70 nm. The color intensity of silver nanoparticles decreased to be colorless after being contacted with mercury ion, indicating its potential for mercury metal ions detection. © 2021, Novel Carbon Resource Sciences.

AB  - Limestone mining has the potential into environmental damage that involve modify an ecosystem. The attempt that contrived to reduce the disturbances are rehabilitation. This research was conducted to examine the growth response of Leucaena leucocephala inoculated with AMF and soil ameliorant in a limestone post-mining soil. The design used was a split-plot design in a completely randomized design with 3 factors. The first factor was AMF inoculum (Daemonorops draco AMF and MycoSilvi), the second factor was organic fertilizer of compost, and the third factor was inorganic fertilizer. The variables used in this study expressed by height, diameter, biomass, root colonization, and nutrient absorption of the plant. The analysis showed that the combination of MycoSilvi and compost 7.5% gave best result of height, diameter, and biomass, with significantly increased by 962.67%, 899.41% and 1440.67% to control plant. It also gave best result of nutrient uptake N, P, and K, with significantly increased up to 17.64 g plant-1, 2.42 g plant-1, and 18.05 g plant-1. In general, AMF showed a good percentage of root colonization with an average 36.67-86.67%. Further research is needed to determine the response to the growth of seedlings planted in the field. © 2020 Institut Pertanian Bogor, Department of Forest Management, Faculty of Forestry.

AB  - Lectins are a specialized group of proteins with immense biological properties and applications. This study describes the purification and characterization of a lectin from Leucaena leucocephala seeds, a plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. Leucaena leucocephala lectin (LLL) was purified by a two-step purification method involving DEAE-cellulose anion exchange chromatography and Sephadex G-75 size exclusion chromatography. The isolated lectin displayed a high haemagglutination titre upon treatment with rabbit erythrocytes. SDS-PAGE and Reverse-Phase High performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis experimentally revealed the presence of three bands corresponding to 37, 27 and 20 kDa indicating the presence of isolectins. Periodic Acid Schiff's (PAS) staining of LLL confirmed the presence of glycoprotein. Various biochemical parameters were analysed to study its effect on the haemagglutination activity. Sugar inhibition studies experimentally revealed that Glucose was the most potent inhibitor. Fluorescence spectrometric analysis of LLL and Glucose indicated a strong interaction with an association constant of 0.159 × 103 M−1. Circular Dichroism spectroscopy indicated a higher alpha helical content (25.27%). LLL was observed to possess mitogenic activity against Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The present investigation reports the isolation of a novel lectin from this plant which could contribute towards the diagnostic studies of certain diseases and for its therapeutic potential. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The durability of superhydrophobic surfaces in fully immersed conditions is a major obstacle to their application in engineering applications. We perform an experimental study to measure the friction factor fd as a function of time for a new superhydrophobic surface that is capable of recovering the Cassie-Baxter wetting state. Values of fd were obtained by measuring the pressure drop and volume flux of a turbulent water flow in a 1.5 m long duct containing one superhydrophobic wall. The Reynolds number of the flow was approximately 4.5×104 for all experiments. Reductions in fd were 29%-36% relative to a hydraulically smooth surface. The Cassie-Baxter state could be recovered by blowing air through the porous surface for 10 min. The durability of the drag-reduction, as quantified by the relaxation time T in which the surface loses its superhydrophobic characteristics, were measured to be between 10 and 60 min depending on the initial head. The relaxation time T was highly dependent on the pressure difference across the surface. In contrast to models based on Darcy flow through a porous medium, the study indicates that there seems to be a critical pressure difference beyond which the Cassie-Baxter state cannot be sustained for the material under consideration. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This study was conducted on a cattle farm in Yucatan, Mexico. The objective was to assess the effect of energy supplementation on milk yield and composition, and on the efficiency of use of dietary N in cows fed Leucaena leucocephala foliage (30% of total diet) and grass Pennisetum purpureum. Four multiparous crossbred Bos indicus × B. taurus cows in the first third of lactation were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Treatments consisted of two energy sources: sugar cane molasses and rice polishing, offered individually or mixed, and a control group (Ctrl) without energy supplementation. The supplements were iso-proteic and iso-energetic and were formulated to provide 25% of the daily energy requirement. Supplementation increased dry matter intake (3 kg/cow/d). Milk yield was 13% higher (P = 0.048) in the supplemented treatments (7.86 kg/cow/d) than in the Ctrl group (6.97 kg/cow/d). Milk yield did not differ (P > 0.05) among supplemented treatments. Milk fat was higher for the Ctrl treatment compared with molasses and rice polishing. Concentrations of protein, lactose and solids non-fat in milk were not significantly affected by energy supplementation. The lower concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) found in the treatments with supplementation (9.77 mg/dl) compared with Ctrl (15.61 mg/dl) indicates greater efficiency in capturing N by rumen microorganisms. No differences in BUN were found among supplemented groups. It is concluded that energy supplementation with rice polishing alone or in combination with molasses, can improve the efficiency of use of dietary N, and milk yield, in cows fed 30% L. leucocephala foliage. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The relative importance index, mean crowding index, patchiness index, Cassie index and Mrisita index were used to analyze the composition and aggregation characteristics of the dominant species of nekton in Minnan Fishing Cround using the special investigation data of fishery resources in Minnan Fishing Cround in April and October 2016. The results showed that there were 17 dominant species of nektons in Minnan Fishing Cround, including 6 species of fish, 3 species of shrimp, 4 species of crab and 4 species of cephalopod. Polydactylus se-xfilis had the strongest aggregation intensity among fishes, and Loligo beka had the strongest aggregation intensity among cephalopods in spring and autumn. Parapenaeopsis hardwickii had the largest aggregation intensity among shrimps, and Portunus gladiator had the largest aggregation intensity among crabs in spring. Trachypenaeus curvirostris had the largest aggregation intensity among shrimps, and Charybdis japonica had the largest aggregation intensity among crabs in autumn. In spring, Evynnis cardinali, Trachypenaeus curvirostris, Portunus trituberculatus, Loligo beka had the highest mean crowding among fishes, shrimps, crabs and cephalopoda, respectively. In autumn, Trichiurus lepturus, Trachypenaeus curvirostris, P. gladiator and Loligo duvaucelii had the highest mean crowding among fishes, shrimps, crabs and cephalopoda, respectively. The average crowding of main dominant species of nekton in autumn was higher than that in spring, and the aggregation intensity of shrimp and crab was higher than that of fish and cephalopod in the Minnan Fishing Cround. © 2021 Science Press.

AB  - Surface coal mining results in the degradation of habitat, altering soil properties, including its biological, physical and chemical features. This review explains the harmful effects of coal mining, such as increased soil erosion, nutrient leaching, increase in soil bulk density, accumulation of heavy metals in soils, and decline in soil pH, organic matter, plant available nutrients, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and microbial activity. Revegetation through tree plantations is one of the efficient methods of restoring fertility of soil by improving the organic matter content and its various properties, increasing plant available nutrients and CEC, and enhancing biological activities. Some promising tree species that could be used for revegetating coal mine spoils in India are, viz., Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia holosericea, Acacia mangium, Albizia procera, Dalbergia sissoo, Leucaena leucocephala, Pithecellobium dulce and Prosopis cineraria. These tree species are acid-tolerant, suitable for growing in infertile soil, and are able to add substantial quantity of organic matter to the soil. From this review, it may be concluded that the revegetation of coal mine spoil through tree plantations can improve fertility of soil and can support the establishment of vegetation; however, the process of restoration of the vegetation, close to the original level, may take longer time, depending on the extent of degradation. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

AB  - River tamarind or scientifically Leucaena leucocephala, is one of the underutilized nanocellulose resources with the potential to be used in reinforcement materials. This work evaluated the use of the insoluble residual waste or marc obtained during the isolation of galactomannan from Leucaena leucocephala seed (LLS) as a feedstock of cellulose to obtain cellulose nanocrystals by a two-step acid hydrolysis followed by its characterization and morphological study. The first step involved acid hydrolyzation of the hemicellulose and lignin from LLS, while the second step dealt with the removal of the amorphous region to produce crystalline LLS nanocrystals (NLLS). The physicochemical properties of nanocrystals were characterized using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), particle size analyzer (PSA), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The NLLS isolated showed a rod-like structure in the range of 70–90nm in diameter with a crystallinity index of 76% and thermal stability at 264°C. PSA indicates that 97.5% of the size distribution of NLLS was below 136.9nm. GPC analysis also revealed that the sulphuric acid hydrolyzation during the second step caused a reduction in the molecular weight due to the cleaving of glycosidic bonds in the structure. These results indicated that LLS waste is a potential feedstock for cellulose nanocrystals preparation. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Nematodes develop resistance to the most common commercially available drugs. The aim of this study was to identify and evaluate the action of protein exudates from Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia mangium, and Stylosanthes capitata seeds on the gastrointestinal nematode Haemonchus contortus. The exuded proteins were precipitated, dialyzed, lyophilized, and assessed for their effect on egg hatching and artificial larval exsheathment inhibition. Proteome analysis of the protein extracts was also performed. Although no egg-hatching inhibition was observed, all exudates showed efficacy in inhibiting the larval exsheathment of H. contortus larvae with an EC50 varying from 0.61 to 0.26 mg P mL−1. Proteomic analysis revealed the presence of proteases, protease inhibitors, chitinases, and lectins among other proteins in the exudates. Most of the exuded proteins belong to the oxidative stress/plant defense and energy/carbohydrate metabolism functional clusters. This study concluded that the bioactive proteins from different classes exuded by seeds of M. caesalpiniifolia, L. leucocephala, A. mangium, and S. capitata show stage-specific inhibition against H. contortus. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Research progress on the application of feed additives in ruminal methane emission reduction: A review
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103444886&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.11151&partnerID=40&md5=25a62f842b07ae36b8a2105e93ad8511
AB  - Background. Ruminal methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants not only pollute the environment and exacerbate the greenhouse effect, but also cause animal energy losses and low production efficiency. Consequently, it is necessary to find ways of reducing methane emissions in ruminants. Studies have reported that feed additives such as nitrogen-containing compounds, probiotics, prebiotics, and plant extracts significantly reduce ruminant methane; however, systematic reviews of such studies are lacking. The present article summarizes research over the past five years on the effects of nitrogen-containing compounds, probiotics, probiotics, and plant extracts on methane emissions in ruminants. The paper could provide theoretical support and guide future research in animal production and global warming mitigation. Methods. This review uses the Web of Science database to search keywords related to ruminants and methane reduction in the past five years, and uses Sci-Hub, PubMed, etc. as auxiliary searchers. Read, filter, list, and summarize all the retrieved documents, and finally complete this article. Results. Most of the extracts can not only significantly reduce CH4 greenhouse gas emissions, but they will not cause negative effects on animal and human health either. Therefore, this article reviews the mechanisms of CH4 production in ruminants and the application and effects of N-containing compounds, probiotics, prebiotics, and plant extracts on CH4 emission reduction in ruminants based on published studies over the past 5 years. Conclusion. Our review provides a theoretical basis for future research and the application of feed additives in ruminant CH4 emission reduction activities. Copyright 2021 Sun et al.

AB  - Field studies were conducted on the application of Leucaena leucocephala leaf extracts as an alternative to carbofuran a synthetic nematicide, while possible residues of carbofuran in tomato fruits were also analysed. Acetone, methanol and petroleum ether fractions of the leaves of L. leucocephala were applied at 200 mg/mL in variants of 100 mL, 150 mL and 200 mL to a naturally nematode infested field. Comparison was made with carbofuran a synthetic insecticide and nematicide. Samples of tomato fruits from carbofuran treated and untreated beds were extracted with ethyl acetate for residual pesticide analysis to ascertain the exceedance of the maximum residue limit (MRL). Results revealed that pesticide residue was significantly (p = 0.05) higher in plots treated with carbofuran compared with standard MRL for carbofuran in tomatoes. Crude extracts of L. leucocephala were as effective as carbofuran, while the fraction was however significantly better in producing higher numbers of fruits and reduced nematode population in root and soil of tomato plants. © 2021 Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry Brno.

AB  - Five important fodder species of mid-hill zone of North-Western (NW) Himalayas viz. Grewia optiva, Celtis australis, Bauhinia variegata, Leucaena leucocephala, and Morus serrata were selected for the study. Whole tree biomass, biomass partioning, the carbon content of each part, was determined. Five models viz, linear, quadratic, cubic, power and compound were tried and tested with the data of biomass and carbon of fodder trees. Test statistics viz. T-test, R2, adjusted R2, and Standard Error (SE) were applied to arrive at the best fit model for each parameter. It was found that for leaf estimation of B. variegata and G. optiva compound model, for L. leucocephala and M. serrata power model and for C. australis Quadratic model is the best fit. Similarly, for other parameters like branch biomass, above-ground biomass, rate of carbon sequestration, and above ground carbon stock best fit models have been derived. The models developed had high significance as tested with different statistics and thus can be applied for NW Indian Himalayas. © 2021 Ecological Society of India. All rights reserved.

AB  - The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) represents a very promising future strategy for synthesizing carbon-containing chemicals in a more sustainable way. In spite of great progress in electrocatalyst design over the last decade, the critical role of wettability-controlled interfacial structures for CO2RR remains largely unexplored. Here, we systematically modify the structure of gas-liquid-solid interfaces over a typical Au/C gas diffusion electrode through wettability modification to reveal its contribution to interfacial CO2 transportation and electroreduction. Based on confocal laser scanning microscopy measurements, the Cassie-Wenzel coexistence state is demonstrated to be the ideal three phase structure for continuous CO2 supply from gas phase to Au active sites at high current densities. The pivotal role of interfacial structure for the stabilization of the interfacial CO2 concentration during CO2RR is quantitatively analysed through a newly-developed in-situ fluorescence electrochemical spectroscopic method, pinpointing the necessary CO2 mass transfer conditions for CO2RR operation at high current densities. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Togo has diverse vegetation ecosystems and habitats with a large number of native flora and fauna species. These provide suitable ecosystem services for diverse environmental and economic outcomes. However, there are threats to socioeconomic conditions and biodiversity from invasive alien species (IAS). IAS are non-native plants and exotic wildlife species that are highly aggressive and harmful to local communities, causing threats to biodiversity, economic impacts, and human health problems. This review provides information on the status of IAS and their ecological impacts on biodiversity in the major ecosystems of Togo, and discusses some mitigation measures that are ongoing in Togo. Findings describe five terrestrial invasive plant species in Togo: Chromolaena odorata (Siam weed), a highly aggressive exotic plant species of fallow land, especially in the Guinean climate; Azadirachta indica (neem tree), a woody species that has become dominant in some areas of the country; Leucaena leucocephala (river tamarind); Tithonia diversifolia (tree marigold); and Mimosa invisa (creeping sensitive plant). In the aquatic environment, the most common invasive alien plant species that invade ponds and lagoons include Pistia stratioites (water lettuce), Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth), Azolla africana (water fern), and Salvinia auriculata (giant Salvinia); the latter two cause eutrophication. In addition, the review documents the prevalence of Achatina fulica (giant African snail), a harmful exotic snail that has invaded riparian and ruderal habitats in Togo, and threatens native terrestrial mollusks through competition for food and refuge. A. fulica has high resistance to environmental changes, high breeding capacity, high potential for natural spread, rapid growth, and high fertility rates. It is also a potential intermediate host of Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a parasitic nematode commonly known as rat lung worm and a causative agent of eosinophilic meningitis. This review documents several invasive alien insect species that are major threats to agriculture across Togo, including Chilo partellus (spotted stem borer), Liriomyza spp. (leaf miner), and Tuta absoluta (tomato leaf miner). Other invasive insect species documented in the review include Paracoccus marginatus (papaya mealybug) and Xylosandrus compactus (shot-hole borer). In addition, Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm), the lethal necrosis disease of maize, and the invasive plant Parthenium hysterophorus (Parthenium weed) have established as significant threats to agriculture in Togo, particularly to maize production. The Oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis) is one of the major fruit pests in Togo, especially mangoes, and the melon fly (Zeugodacus cucurbitae), an insect species native to East Asia, has invaded market gardening crops in Togo. Controlling IAS is an important action to mitigate the negative impacts on biodiversity and especially on agricultural production. Togo has developed its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP 2011-2020), in which the IAS issue has been well considered, and identified prevention and control measures to be taken. A few actions identified in the NBSAP have started, such as setting up task forces for the management of insect IAS. However, there are generally no concrete actions visible on the ground for most IAS threats in Togo. © 2021 John Wiley and Sons Ltd.

AB  - The biochar utilization reduces CO2 emissions. This study aims to investigate the optimum pyrolysis temperature of lamtoro wood (Leucaena leucocephala) to produce suitable biochar for coal blends as fuel in the steam power plant. The experiment was carried out in a batch process, applied to a fixed bed reactor, 10 C/minute heating rate, three different variables temperature (300, 450, 600 C), and 60 minutes residence time. The biochar yield for each pyrolysis temperature is 61.77%, 26.45%, and 24.89%. This shows that the pyrolysis is carried out at a temperature of 300 to 450 C, then ramps up to 600 C. The volatile matter was released during the pyrolysis and raise the fixed carbon content. The fixed carbon content for each pyrolysis temperature is 26.35%, 61.82%, and 65.66%. Fixed carbon content at 450 and 600 C identical to bituminous coal. The increase in fixed carbon content in biochar leads the heating value to increase. The heating value of lamtoro wood was 19.15 MJ/kg (db), increasing to 22.92, 28.01, and 29.73 MJ/kg (db) for each pyrolysis temperature. The biochar heating value is close to bituminous coal. The biochar energy content of original lamtoro wood for each pyrolysis temperature is 81.72%, 42.77%, and 42.71%. Biochar reaches its optimal point at pyrolysis temperature 450 C, which has a yield and heating value almost the same at pyrolysis temperature of 600 C. The biochar characterization results indicate that it can be used as a coal blend for steam power plants.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Like all the South-east Asian countries, Malaysia is endowed with diverse ecosystems and habitats with a large number of native flora and fauna species. During the colonial era, many species of economic plants were introduced but they didn’t become threats to socio-economic conditions and biodiversity from these alien species. Only a few species have become invasive that are harmful to the local and native communities, causing minor impacts to the environment. This brief review provides information on the status and ecological impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on biodiversity in Malaysia and discusses some control measures. Five terrestrial invasive plant species, including Pennisetum polystachion, Mimosa pigra, M. invisa, Acacia mangium, Leucaena leucocephala. In the aquatic environment, the most common invasive alien plant species that invade ponds and lagoons include Eichhornia crassipes, Nymphaea nelumbo, Cabomba furcate, and Pistia stratiotes. A preliminary action was identified by the Ministry of Agriculture via task forces for the management of IAS. However, there are generally no concrete strategies and action plans visible on the ground for most of the IAS threats in Malaysia. © 2021 John Wiley and Sons Ltd.

AB  - Drought is the main problem faced in agricultural activities in Sekaran Village, Bojonegoro Regency. The primary agricultural commodities in Sekaran Village are corn and cattle breeding. Tree corridor planning is one of the proposed solutions to overcome this problem. This study aimed to develop a tree corridor plan for the agricultural area's ecological sustainability in Sekaran Village by improving the quality and quantity of green open space. Spatial data obtained from the field survey using drone technology. Environmental variables used for corridor plan analysis were land cover, slope, road, and orthomosaic imageries. This study produced a tree corridor planning along 156.57 km located in agriculture land, roadsides, and valley/basin. The proposed tree species has ecological functions such as water absorption and improving microclimate, production functions (food and cattle feed), and aesthetic functions. Tree corridors will use a hedgerow model to form an integrated corridor system in Sekaran Village. Tree species recommended such as Swietenia mahogani, Delonix regia, Spathodea campanulata, Gliricidia sepium, Centrosema pubescens, Leucaena leucocephala, Mangifera indica, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Psidium guajava.  © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biosorbents (fiber, treated fiber, and charcoal) from the Leucaena leucocephala tree were prepared in this study. The potential of the biosorbents as metal capture (removal percentage %R) for chromium (III) (Cr+3) from aqueous solution was examined. The concentrations of the Cr+3 solutions were measured before and after the adsorption to investigate the %R using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Moreover, the specific surface area (A) of the biosorbent samples was evaluated after measuring the adsorbed acetic acid onto the samples. From the results, A and %R were found in the order of charcoal > treated fiber > fiber. The highest values of A and %R were about 423 m2g-1 and 97%, respectively. This finding suggested the high potential of Leucaena charcoal usage as chromium ions capture compared to fibers and treated fibers. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to characterize the soil seed bank in an area dominated by Leucaena leucocephala, here called “Povoamento de Leucaena” (PL) and an area of native forest in the Parque Estadual do Rio Doce (PERD), both of which are affected by the city of Ipatinga, MG. Thirty sample units (SU) with dimensions of 25.0 x 25.0 x 5.0 cm were installed in each of the study areas and the seed bank of the areas was collected and evaluated. The emerging seedlings were counted and identified; the evaluations were carried out weekly during the six-month period. The average density of germinated seeds was 716.2 seeds/m² in the PL and 86.4 seeds/m² in the PERD area. In addition, 39 species were identified in the PL area (41% exotic), while in the PERD area 32 species were identified (25% exotic). The exotic tree species that stood out in number of individuals were Muntingia calabura and L. leucocephala, representing 82.57% and 5.88%, respectively of the total individuals found. Therefore, both environments are under strong environmental pressure, requiring the control of existing exotic species, as well as enrichment actions with the planting of species of diversity to accelerate the restoration process in the PL area. © 2021.

AB  - The study aims to determine the performance of young male Kacang goats fattened by complete silage. There were 12 young male Kacang goats used in this study with initial body weight of 10-12 kg. The study used a Completely Randomized Design with 3 treatments for each TI: 45% Natural Grass + Leucaena leucocephala 20% + corn flour 25% + bran pollard 10%; T2: Sorghum bicolor L. Moench 45% + L. leucocephala 20% + corn flour 25% + bran pollard 10%; T3: Pennisetum purpuphoides 45% + L. leucocephala 20% + corn flour 25% + bran pollard 10%. The data was analyzed by analysis of variance. The results showed that the use of complete silage made from different forages did not have a significant effect on the feed intake and digestibility of the male Kacang goats, except digestibility of ether extract (P <0.05). Daily body weight gain of T2 treatment higher than T1 treatment (P<0.05), but was relatively the same with T3 treatment. As well as the T1 treatment was relatively the same with T3 treatment. The feed conversion and efficiency provided relatively the same results of the three treatments. It can be concluded that the male Kacang goats which obtained complete silage composed of natural grass, S. bicolor L.Moench and P. purpuphoides in have not had a significant effect on the feed intake and digestibility of nutrients, except on the digestion of ether extract. The daily body weight gain of the goats that received complete silage with Sorghum bicolor L. Moench-based forage can be increased, but the feed conversion and efficiency used have relatively similar effects. © 2021. Tahuk et al.

AB  - Two experiments (in vitro and in vivo evaluation) were conducted to evaluate the ability of three different tanniniferous legumes to replace berseem hay on ruminal fermentation, digestibility and methane (CH4) emission. Berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) hay (BH) was considered as control, or replaced at 50 % with Acacia saligna (AS), Leucaena leucocephala (LL) or Atriplex halimus (AH) on a DM basis. In Experiment 1 (in vitro evaluation), in vitro ruminal degradability, gas and CH4 production were measured. In Experiment 2 (in vivo evaluation), twelve Barki rams weighing 43.29 ± 0.13 kg were randomly assigned into 4 treatments and individually fed the BH, AS and LL diets for 30 days (21 days for adaptation, 7 days for digestibility and N balance and the subsequent 2 days for CH4 measurements). Results of Experiment 1 showed that AS, LL and AH diets decreased (P < 0.05) gas, CH4 and total protozoa compared to BH. Both AS and LL diets increased (P < 0.05) ruminal propionate and partitioning factor, while decreased, ammonia-N (NH3-N) concentrations, acetate, acetate/propionate ratio and protozoa count compared to the BH diet. In Experiment 2, the LL diet decreased (P < 0.05) dry matter intake and digestibility of crude protein compared with the BH diet. Rams fed both AS and LL diets showed greater (P < 0.05) fecal N and retained N, while decreased (P < 0.01) urinary N excretion and exhibited 11.45 % reductions in CH4 production. In conclusion, the partial replacement of BH with AS reduced N losses and CH4 emissions without negative effects on ruminal fermentation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Higher biochar rate can be efficient in reducing nitrogen mineralization and nitrification in the excessive compost-fertilized soils
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108834475&doi=10.3390%2fagronomy11040617&partnerID=40&md5=4a70851a68cf7587f1bca163ab00795b
AB  - The effects of a high biochar rate on soil carbon mineralization, when co-applied with excessive compost, have been reported in previous studies, but there is a dearth of studies focusing on soil nitrogen. In order to ascertain the positive or snegative effects of a higher biochar rate on excessive compost, compost (5 wt. %) and three slow pyrolysis (>700◦C) biochars (formosan ash (Fraxinus formosana Hayata), ash biochar; makino bamboo (Phyllostachys makino Hayata), bamboo biochar; and lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de. Wit), lead tree biochar) were applied (0, 2 and 5 wt. %) to three soils (one Oxisols and two Inceptisols). Destructive sampling occurred at 1, 3, 7, 28, 56, 84, 140, 196, 294, and 400 days to monitor for changes in soil chemistry. The overall results showed that, compared to the other rates, the 5% biochar application rate significantly reduced the concentrations of inorganic N (NO−3−N + NH+4 − N) in the following, decreasing order: lead tree biochar > bamboo biochar > ash biochar. The soil response in terms of ammonium and nitrate followed a similar declining trend in the three soils throughout the incubation periods, with this effect increasing in tandem with the biochar application rate. Over time, the soil NO−3−N increased, probably due to the excessive compost N mineralization; however, the levels of soil NO−3 − N in the sample undergoing the 5% biochar application rate remained the lowest, to a significant degree. The soils’ original properties determined the degree of ammonium and nitrate reduction after biochar addition. To reduce soil NO−3 − N pollution and increase the efficiency of compost fertilizer use, a high rate of biochar application (especially with that pyrolyzed at high temperatures (>700◦C)) to excessively compost-fertilized soils is highly recommended. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Cattle and corn are important for small farmers in west Timor. However, owing to the lack of proper technologies, marginal lands and erratic rainfalls, productivity of both are low. To improve the productivity, a conservation agriculture approach was demonstrated during 2017-2019 at Camplong II village, on a marginal land with shallow top soil, rocky formation, with existing corn production of <1 ton/ha. The technology package in 2019, includes: (i) hedges of Leucaena leucocephala (planted at 2 m within the row and 4 m between the rows), (ii) Deep planting hole (40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm) filled with mixtures of soil and cattle manure, (iii) planting of grass within the rows of Leucaena, (iv) cover crop legumes: cow pea, Clitoria ternatea, and Mucuna holtonii while using corn stover and cattle refusals as mulches. Forage was obtained from Leucaena and the grass, while herbaceous legumes were left uncut. The results include: (i) year round supply of high quality forage, (ii) improved the daily weight gain of fattening cattle (0.2 to 0.3 - 0.6 kg/head/day), (iii) reduced calves mortality down to 0%, (iv) and increased corn yield to 5 ton/ha and a second crop harvest as green corn.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the reproduction output of Archachatina marginata fed on roughage and concentrate feed with leaf meal inclusive diets. 150 point of lay snails weighing between 150-170g were randomly allotted to 5 treatment diets with ten (10) replicates, three (3) snails per replicate, desig-nated as treatment 2 (GNCD) which has groundnut cake, Treatment 3 (GLLM) has Gliricidia sepium, Treatment 4 (MOLM) Moringa oliefera and Treatment 5 (LLLM) has Leucaena leucocephala leaf meals as protein source in snail diet and a control; treatment 1 (UPWP) fed roughage (unripe pawpaw and wa-termelon peel) in a 12 weeks feed trail. Feed intake, weight gain, egg lay, egg fertility, and hatchability and Gonado-somatic index were measured. The result revealed snails fed UPWP had least final weight and weight gain which was accompanied by the highest feed intake across the treatments. Average egg laid, hatchability, fertility, embryo mortality and average juvenile produced by snails on roughage-based diet were significantly least across the treatments. High gonado-somatic index of snails on leaf meal based diet accompanied with better reproductive output in laying snails were recorded. Snails fed Leucaena leucocephala inclusive diet had better egg production, fertility, hatchability and juvenile snails accompanied with gonado-somatic index across the treatments. In conclusion, concentrate ration is essential for optimal reproductive output in snails. © 2021, UCOPress. Cordoba University Press (UCOPress Editorial Universidad de Córdoba). All rights reserved.

AB  - Itajahya rosea was found growing in association with Leucaena leucocephala plants at Savitribai Phule Pune University campus in India. The species identity was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis based on ITS and LSU regions of rDNA, wherein, our fugus was placed along with I. rosea in phylogenetic tree. It represents first record of I. rosea from India. Frequent visitation by Drosophila species on I. rosea fruiting body particularly on gleba was observed. The Drosophila got attracted to the detached gleba under the laboratory conditions and even sometimes, they prefer to sit over the gleba as compare to their food banana. It suggested that I. rosea gleba or pseudostipe produces some compounds for attraction and feeding behavior of Drosophila species. Therefore, we characterized the volatile attractants produced by gleba and pseudostipe of I. rosea by GC-MS analysis. Nineteen compounds were identified from gleba while nine compounds were recovered from the pseudostipe. Out of them, blends of three abundant odor producing volatile compounds were reported namely, Hexadecane, Pentadecane and Nonadecane, which are responsible for attraction of Drosophila toward the gleba. Three fatty acids namely 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z), hexadecanoic acid and benzoic acid ethyl ester produced are served as an appetitive signal through olfactory response of Drosophila, so the flies were feed on the gleba. Two pheromones’ compounds, heneicosane and (+)-(5S,9S)-5,9-dimethylpentadecane, were also reported in pseudostipe and gleba, respectively, which play a role in Drosophila for breeding. Our study highlights an intriguing chemical ecology of fungus–Drosophila interaction. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Dedicated energy crop (DEC) serves as a highly promising feedstock for heat and power apart from wastes. Established DEC plant species which include poplar, willow and eucalyptus possess special criteria such as fast growing, high biomass production per unit land area and can be planned in production. Locally available plants such as Leucaena leucocephala and Khaya senegalensis are identified among potential species which can be developed as our own DEC. Therefore, this research was conducted to assess the potential of Khaya senegalensis and Leucaena leucocephala as energy crop. Proximate analysis was executed to establish some important quality of the biomass sample which were moisture content, volatile matters, ash content, and carbon content. Biomass sample was then pelletized and subjected to density and durability testing to evaluate the pellet quality produced. Interestingly, it was found that Khaya senegalensis and Leucaena leucocephala biomass have strong potential to be industrialised as our own dedicated energy crops. The calorific value of both biomass are as good as other established energy crops thereby enlisting these two plant species as Malaysian energy crop. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In tropical dry forest conditions, small ruminant production is an alternative for small farmers. Even so, the quality of the forages does not meet the nutritional requirements of the animals. However, the high biodiversity of trees that exist in the region offers a supplementation alternative especially during the dry season. The objective of this research work was to evaluate the quality and the profile effect of fatty acids in Colombian creole lamb meat supplemented with tree species from the tropical dry forest. A total of 35 lambs were used which were randomly distributed in 5 treatments as follows: T1: Botriochloa pertusa; T2: Botriochloa pertusa + 300 g/day of Leucaena leucocephala; T3: Botriochloa pertusa + 300 g/day of Gliricidia sepium; T4: Botriochloa pertusa + 300 g/day of Guazuma ulmifolia and T5 (BpSs): Botriochloa pertusa + 300 g/day of Senna spectabilis. The experimental units were brought to a final slaughter weight of ±32 kg and the pH, color, and fatty acid composition of the carcasses were evaluated at 24 hours. The meat quality parameters did not present significant differences (P>0.05) in the different supplements and obtained acceptable parameters for their consumption. It was evidenced that the proportions of saturated fatty acids (C 16: 0, C 18: 0, total SFA) in lambs supplemented with Senna spectabilis and Gliricidia sepium were lower (P<0.05). It is concluded that under the conditions of the study the supplementations with Senna spectabilis and Gliricidia sepium can induce a favorable change in the fatty acid content of lamb meat. © 2021.

TI  - Effect of Leucaena leucocephala and corn oil on ruminal fermentation, methane production and fatty acid profile: An in vitro study
PY  - 2021

AB  - Aims: This in vitro study aimed to examine the effect of proportions of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) to Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach) or levels of corn oil (CO) and their interaction on ruminal fermentation, methane (CH4) production and fatty acid profile. Methods: The experiment was conducted as a 4 × 3 factorial arrangement following a completely randomised design with two factors. The treatments were according to the proportion of Leucaena and Napier grass (in g/kg DM, Treatment (T)1 = 0: 750 (control), T2 = 250: 500, T3 = 500: 250, T4 = 750: 0). Three levels of CO (in mg rumen fluid, CO1 = 0, CO2 = 10, CO3 = 20 respectively) were added to each of the diet, giving a total 12 dietary treatments. Key results: Replacing Napier grass with Leucaena at 500 g/kg (T3) and 750 g/kg (T4) levels increased the molar volatile fatty acid concentration, microbial protein synthesis (P < 0.001) and ammonia nitrogen concentration (P = 0.003), whereas ruminal protozoa concomitantly decreased (P < 0.05). The addition of CO at 10 mg also reduced the number of ruminal protozoa compared with the control (P < 0.001). A significant Leucaena × CO interaction was observed on the increase of ammonia nitrogen and microbial protein synthesis, and CH4 production was simultaneously suppressed (P < 0.001). There was also a significant Leucaena × CO interaction on increasing concentration of C18:1 cis-9, C18:2 cis-10 cis-12 and α-linolenic acid, which thus contributed to the increase of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulation in the culture (P < 0.001). However, the concentration of C18:0 was not influenced by the treatments (P > 0.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the inclusion of Leucaena into a Napier grass-based diet at 500 g/kg and 750 g/kg DM positively affected rumen fermentation, reduced CH4 formation and increased beneficial fatty acids in the rumen. Although CO had similar positive effects on CH4 production and targeted beneficial fatty acids, it reduced the microbial protein synthesis at inclusion of 20 mg/mL DM. Overall, there were synergistic interactions between Leucaena and CO in reducing CH4 production and improving the fatty acid profile in the rumen. Implications: It is possible to improve animal productivity while reducing the environmental impact of livestock production through inclusion of tannin-containing Leucaena and CO in ruminant diets in tropical regions where C4 grasses typically have low nutritive value. © 2021 CSIRO.

AB  - In this study, torrefaction behavior of hot-pressed wood pellet prepared at 250 °C and compression pressure of 70 MPa was examined at temperature 260–300 °C. It was found that the torrefaction behavior of hot-pressed pellet (HP) was significantly different from that of Raw and cold-pressed pellet (CP). The mass yield and energy yield for torrefaction at 300 °C and 30 min holding time for HP were 54.5% and 84.4%, respectively. Whereas the mass yield and energy yield for torrefaction at 300 °C and 30 min for Raw were 41.5% and 58.1%, respectively. From the gas formation analysis, it was found that the dehydration and deoxygenation reactions were accelerated to produce a large amount of H2O and CO2 during the torrefaction of HP. It was judged that torrefaction of hot-pressed pellet was very effective to prepare high quality black pellet. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lamtoro tempeh is a traditional Indonesian fermented food made from lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala). In Pacitan, it is usually fermented using usar (a traditional tempeh inoculum made from senggani leaves). The fermentation process takes 42 hrs and during this period, there are changes in the chemical and microbiological characteristics of the lamtoro seeds. To study these changes, samples were collected and tested for chemical characteristics (water content, ash content, dissolved protein, pH, and total acid titration) and microbiological characteristics (the number of fungi, yeast, and lactic acid bacteria) every 6 hrs during the 42 hrs fermentation. During fermentation, the water content increased significantly in the initial 6 hrs of fermentation and then tended to stabilize until the 42-hour. The ash content increased, while the dissolved protein content increased from the 0-hour to the 36-hour of fermentation but dropped at the 42-hour. The pH level of the lamtoro tempeh decreased from 0-hour until 30-hour and then increased until the end of the fermentation period. However, the level of total acid titration increased during the lamtoro tempeh fermentation. The growth of fungi, yeast and lactic acid bacteria initially declined but then gradually increased until the end of fermentation (42-hour). The fermentation time was found to affect both the number of microbes and the chemical characteristics of the lamtoro tempeh from the Pacitan area. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Effects of substituting Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) as roughage source on digestibility, blood metabolites and ruminal fermentation in growing goat
PY  - 2021

AB  - This study aimed to assess the effects of three levels of inclusion (0, 50, and 100%) of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) as roughage sources on growing goats. Feed nutrient digestibility, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose (BG), and ammonia nitrogen concentration (NH3-N) of goats were measured. The results showed that the control and the 50% Leucaena in roughage groups had higher DM, OM, NDF, and ADF digestibility than the 100% Leucaena group. The digestibility of CP in goats fed with 50 and 100% of Leucaena in roughage was significantly (P<0.05) higher than goats in the control group. The values of pH, NH3-N, and BG of all treatments were not significantly different. The ruminal NH3-N concentration did was not changed with different proportions of Leucaena leaf, ranged between 24.98-26.52 mg/dL. The BUN and BG concentrations in this trial were within the physiological range of goats. Results of this study concluded that substitution of grass by Leucaena up to 50% enhanced DM, CP and fiber digestibility but total substitution reduced nutrient digestibility (except CP). However, substitution at both levels did not affect blood metabolites and ruminal fermentation of growing goat. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

TI  - Preparation, development and characterization of Leucaena leucocephala galactomannan (LLG) conjugated sinapic acid: A potential colon targeted prodrug
PY  - 2021

AB  - Sinapic acid (SA), a widely prevalent hydroxycinnamic acid, possess numerous biological activities owing to its antioxidant property. The present study was aimed to prepare colon targeted polysaccharidic/polymeric ester prodrug of SA (a microbially triggered system) using Leucaena leucocephala galactomannan (LLG) as a polysaccharidic carrier. The polymeric conjugates of SA-LLG were found to exhibit an increase in % yield and DS with increase in amount of SA and volume of thionyl chloride. The degree of depolymerization of SA-LLG prodrug batches were evaluated using optimized concentration of galactomannase. The SA-LLG prodrug was characterized employing UV and FTIR spectroscopy, 1H NMR and XRD. In vitro release study of the optimized prodrug batch (SL10) suggested stable nature of SA-LLG conjugate under acidic (pH 1.2) and alkaline conditions (pH 6.8). The treatment of prodrug with galactomannase (15 mg/mL) followed by esterase (10 U/mL) enzyme released approximately 81% of SA after 24 h. The cell viability results revealed that free SA and SA-LLG were found to have similar antiproliferative potential against human colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116 cells). Our investigation revealed that polysaccharidic prodrug, SA-LLG, has the potential for colon targeting of SA and thus can be employed for the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Termites are major pests of houses and buildings, and also living plants such as agricultural crops, trees in forests, urban areas and gardens. However, in Japan, the basic ecology of termites nesting in living trees is not fully understood. In this study, we observed 255 colonies (nests) of the drywood termite Neotermes sugioi, collected in the field on Okinawa Island, and reported the frequency composition of the reproductive castes, the size of wood with termite gallery, the population size of colonies, and the relative position of the reproductive and non-reproductive castes within nests. Most colonies were headed by a primary queen and a primary king. However, colonies headed only by primary queens, primary kings, or neotenic kings, each accounted for approximately 5% of the colonies. A colony size of 1,000– 4,000 individuals (2058.2 ± 1695.0 [mean ± SD]) was common and the average length of colony branches was less than 100 cm. Queens and kings were found in the same or nearby nest areas, and more predominantly in the central or root side of nest wood areas. The termites may experience colony fragmentation and reproductive loss as a consequence of typhoons. Incipient colonies (i.e., colonies at an early stage of development) were found on 11.3% of branches of Leucaena leucocephala that did not show any obvious signs of infestation. In future research, it will be necessary to update the list of trees damaged by this termite species, compare the damage by tree species, and evaluate the economic impact. © 2020 Korean Society of Applied Entomology

TI  - Leucaena leucocephala leaves and prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) as substitutes for alfalfa hay (Medicago sativa L.) and their effects on the gas and methane production, prevalence of methanogens and patterns of ruminal fermentation in vitro

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the replacement of alfalfa hay with Leucaena leucocephala leaves and prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) as an alternative forage, on gas and methane production, ruminal fermentation patterns and total amount of methanogens during in vitro fermentation. Four treatments were evaluated: (T1) alfalfa hay + concentrate (50: 50%, DM); (T2) alfalfa hay + Leucaena leaves + concentrate (30: 20: 50%, DM); (T3) alfalfa hay + prickly pear + concentrate (30: 20: 50%, DM) and (T4) alfalfa hay + Leucaena leaves + prickly pear + concentrate (30: 10: 10: 50%, DM). The higher gas production from of soluble fraction (A) and rate gas production (Kd) values, ammonia-N (NH3-N) concentrations and propionate were found in T1 and lower in T2 (p<0.05). Nevertheless, the inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala in the diet decreased the methane production and did not affect the total of methanogens. Results showed that the replacement of alfalfa hay by Leucaena leucocephala and Opuntia ficus-indica in a diet do not affect the main variables of in vitro gas production, ruminal fermentation patterns and methanogenic microorganisms populations. © 2021 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

TI  - On the cause and correction of the anomalously high contact angles measured on soils and granular materials
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100781951&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoderma.2021.114973&partnerID=40&md5=b4f6eb547652b243cf86e958f013e073
AB  - Anomalously high water contact angles are often measured for soils or other granular materials when using a goniometer which is designed for use with flat surfaces. For many years such high contact angles have been rationalised in terms of Cassie and Baxter, and/or Wenzel models for contact angles on non‐planar surfaces, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that the theories behind these models are fundamentally flawed. Here, we present an alternative interpretation of these anomalously high contact angles which takes into consideration how a water drop sits on the particulate surface, and propose a geometric correction factor to address this anomaly. Experimental data from studies with precisely arranged needles and spheres, and model and natural soils, were used to explore this approach and examine the validity of the method. Application of the correction factor to measurements of water drops on 1 mm diameter steel spheres hydrophobised with paraffin wax gave a reduction of the measured contact angle of 140.4(±0.6)° to a corrected contact angle of 108.2(±1.0)°, which is within 3.5° of the flat‐plane contact angle for water on the wax of 111.7(±0.6)°. For paraffin wax coated soils, measured contact angles are shown to be 15–25° higher than comparable flat-plane contact angle. This correction factor may be useful in interpreting goniometer contact angle measurements of irregular surfaces since it is the flat-plane, rather than measured, contact angle which gives a measure of the polarity/hydrophobicity of the surface. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Membrane wetting and fouling represent the foremost concerning issues confining membrane distillation in the treatment of industrial wastewater. This work presents a superhydrophobic poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane with anti-fouling property, which was derived from the bioinspired adhesive, mineralization and fluorination process for the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). The synthesis of membrane was initiated by co-depositing polydopamine/polyethylenimine composite layer onto membrane substrates as “bio-glue” associated with β-FeOOH nanorods as hierarchical structure anchoring to form coordination complexes via the catechol group and Fe3+, then proceeded with the fluorination of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane to obtain the superhydrophobic PVDF membrane. Due to the unique micro-nano structure obtained, the resulting PVDF membrane, with a low sliding angle of 5.7° and a high water contact angle of 162°, conforms to the Cassie state. The membrane morphology, wetting behaviour, and anti-fouling performance were systematically characterized. The novel mineralized superhydrophobic membrane exhibited a steady flux and an outstanding salt rejection (99.9%) in treating high salinity and hardness containing-wastewater during 60-h-DCMD test, thus showing great potential for practical application in long-term DCMD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Feasibility of UV-Vis Spectral Fingerprinting Combined with Chemometrics for Rapid Detection of Phyllanthus niruri Adulteration with Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2021

AB  - Phyllanthus niruri is widely used in Indonesia as immunostimulant. The morphology of Leucaena leucocephala leaves is similar to that of P. niruri leaves. L. leucocephala is easy to find and collect because it is widely distributed in the world. Therefore, it is likely P. niruri could be adulterated with L. leucocephala. Therefore, identification and authentication of P. niruri is important to ensure the raw materials used are original without any substitution or mixture with other similar plants causing inconsistencies in their efficacy. In this paper, we described feasibility used of UV-Vis spectral fingerprinting and chemometrics for rapid method for the identification and detection of P. niruri leaves adulterated with L. leucocephala leaves. UV-Vis spectra of samples measured in the interval of 200-800 nm and signal smoothing followed by standard normal variate were used for pre-processing the spectral data. Principal component analysis (PCA) with the absorbance data from the pre-processed UV-Vis spectra in the range of 250-700 nm as variables could distinguish P. niruri from L. leucocephala. PCA followed by discriminant analysis (DA) could successfully classified P. niruri mixed with 5, 25, and 50% L. luecocephala into their respective groups (96.81%). We also employed soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) for authentication of P. niruri and found that 88.3% of the samples were also correctly classified into their respective groups. A combination of UV-Vis spectroscopy with chemometrics, such as PCA-DA and SIMCA, were used for the first time for the identification and detection of P. niruri adulterated with L. leucocephala. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - Alginate-producing bacteria are important for improving the quality of dry land, as they can both dissolve phosphate and fix nitrogen. Until now, the alginate-producing bacteria are largely isolated from seaweed. These bacteria were from the root ecosystem of cultivated plants. This study was conducted to explore bacteria that were capable of producing alginates, dissolving phosphates, and fixing nitrogen from the rhizosphere of corn (Zea mays), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), and lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala). The characterization was carried out both morphologically and physiologically. A total of 17 isolates were successfully grown on alginate media, of which six isolates were from maize rhizosphere, five isolates from cocoa, and six isolates from the lamtoro rhizosphere. Bacterial isolates from the rhizosphere of maize and cocoa varied in terms of colony colors. In contrast, isolates from the lamtoro rhizosphere varied in colony forms. The KK1-40 isolates showed the highest cell biomass and dry weight which were 0.082 g mL-1 and 0.068 g respectively. The KK3-32 isolate showed the highest phosphate dissolution concentration of 10.85 mg L-1 with phosphate solubility efficiency value (PSE) and phosphate solubility index (PSI) which were 166.7 and a phosphate solubility index (PSI) 2.67 with a phosphate dissolution concentration of 10.85 mg L-1. LR1-25 isolates were able to fix the highest amount of nitrogen with a total N content of 0.36%. Isolates KK1-40 and LR1-25 were identified as Gram-negative bacteria and isolate KK-32 were identified as Gram-positive bacteria. The bacterial isolates KK1-40, KK3-32, and LR1-25 were superior bacteria that can be formulated to increase the productivity of dry land. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is high-nutrient legume due to its crude protein rate (20-30%). Unfortunately, its utilization needs to be restricted due to the presence of mimosine, a compound that exhibits negative effects on livestocks. This study aimed to compare the performance of adult male rabbits after given commercial feed supplemented with water-soaked and air-dried Leucaenaleaf meal (WSADL) with those given air-dried Leucaena leaf meal (ADL).Fifty local male rabbits, 6 months old and weighing around 2.0-2.3 kg, were used as samples. This study used a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with five treatment groups (n=10), consisting of one control group that were fed commercial feed (R0), three groups that were fed WSADL (15%, 22.5%, and 30%) and one group that was fed 15% of ADL. Those rabbits were fed for 60 days. The independent variables being observed were the dry matter intake, daily weight gain, and feed conversion ratio (FCR). The result showed that the supplementation of Leucaena leaf meal which was processed through water-soaking and air-dried as much as 30% on rabbit feed did not reduce the dry matter intake, while it increased body weight gain and efficiency of feed usage. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Madagascar is experiencing some of the most persistent and alarming rates of anthropogenic forest loss, threatening its endemic flora and fauna. Numerous factors contribute to this forest degradation and loss, but in Madagascar it is most often attributed to heavy human reliance on forest products for income and survival. Montagne des Français (MDF) is a forest in northern Madagascar and the last remaining home of the Critically Endangered northern sportive lemur (Lepilemur septentrionalis). We assessed the type and frequency of anthropogenic disturbances observed at MDF, as well as the forest loss and fragmentation in this region over six decades. To assess current conditions, we systematically recorded occurrences of anthropogenic disturbances in ten lemur home ranges and three trails over two field seasons (June to July 2016; February to May 2017). To assess historical landcover change, we analyzed six, classified, 30-m resolution forest cover maps from 1953, 1973, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2014. We recorded a total of 1,412 human-caused disturbances of eight different types in about 15 ha. Felled trees were the most frequently observed disturbance, with Bonaramatsigny (Leucaena leucocephala) the most frequently felled species. Forest cover at MDF drastically decreased from 76% in 1953, to 24% in 2014. Our results indicate that human disturbances are widespread and pervasive, contributing to overall forest cover loss and fragmentation at MDF, which impact the quality, connectivity, and availability of habitat for endemic lemurs of this region. © 2021 Global Wildlife Conservation.

AB  - Species of Raffaelea (Ophiostomatales: Ascomycota) are obligate symbionts of ambrosia beetles, some of which pose a substantial threat to forest trees. Leucaena leucocephala is a small mimosoid tree species that is considered as an invasive weed in most of its introduced range globally. During a field expedition on the French island of Réunion, dying L. leucocephala trees were observed. Samples were taken from these trees and isolations made from symptomatic wood tissues that included beetle tunnels, but in the absence of the beetles themselves. Multiple isolates of a fungus resembling a Raffaelea species were obtained from the discoloured wood associated with the beetle tunnels. To determine their identity, microscopic examination was performed and DNA sequences for three gene regions (ITS, LSU, TUB) were obtained. Phylogenetic analyses based on these gene regions revealed that the isolates represent a new species of Raffaelea, described here as R. borbonica sp. nov. A pathogenicity test was conducted with the fungus, which was shown to cause lesions on the inoculated seedlings, but with a low level of aggressiveness.  © 2020 Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute.

AB  - Torrefaction of Leucaena Leucocephala was performed in a fixed bed reactor at temperature of 300 C and 20 minutes holding time under inert environment. The torrefied Leucaena Leucocephala was pelletized with starch as the binder. Two parameters were investigated such as different ratio of starch addition to torrefied Leucaena Leucocephala pellets and the thickness of torrefied Leucaena Leucocephala pellets towards its durability. The ratios of starch addition to torrefied Leucaena Leucocephala pellets studied were 0, 5,10,15,20 and 25 wt%. Meanwhile, the studied thickness of torrefied Leucaena Leucocephala pellets were 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 cm. It was observed that when the ratio of starch addition to torrefied Leucaena Leucocephala pellets was varied from 0-25 wt%, the durability increased steadily and the highest durability of 56.06% was achieved at 20 wt%. When the thickness of torrefied Leucaena Leucocephala pellets was increased from 0.3-0.7 cm, the highest durability of 93.18 % was achieved at 0.5 cm thickness. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis was performed on the torrefied Leucaena Leucocephala pellets of 0 and 20 wt% ratio of starch addition. SEM images show the existence of some minor pores on the surface of torrefied Leucaena Leucocephala pellet at 250X and 1000X magnifications. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this study we have discussed pollen morphology of 14 mimosaceous species belonging to five genera by using light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The palynological features of species were determined by both qualitative and quantitative characters. The qualitative characters include pollen shape, colpi arrangement, and exine sculpturing. Oblate spheroidal shaped pollens were noted in Albizia procera, Albizia lebbeck, Acacia tortilis, Acacia ampliceps, and Acacia modesta, subprolate shaped pollen in Leucaena leucocephala, Prosopis julifera, and Acacia nilotica, prolate pollen in Acacia farnesiana and Prosopis glandulosa while spheroidal, sub spheroidal and sub oblate pollen grains were observed in Acacia catechu, Mimosa himalayana, Prosopis cineraria, respectively. Sparsely foveolate, reticulate, scabrate, and scrobiclate exine sculpturing were observed. Colpi with sunken ornamentation were seen in P. cineraria, P. glandulosa, P. juliflora, and L. leucocephala while colpi were absent in rest of the studied species. The quantitative characters were statistically studied using SPSS software. The current study gives important morpho-palynological characters for identifying and validation of close related and similar taxa which will aid to the phylogenetic analysis of Mimosaceae family. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The 70% ethanolic extracts from eight neglected fruits; Muntingia calabura, Leucaena leucocephala, Spondias dulcis, Syzygium jambos, Mangifera caesia, Ardisia elliptica, Cynometra cauliflora and Ficus auriculata were evaluated for their 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging, α-glucosidase inhibitory activities as well as total phenolic content. The results of this study revealed that M. caesia fruit extract demonstrated the most potent radical scavenging activity. Among the fruits examined for α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, M. calabura and F. auriculata exhibited strong activity with no significant difference. The Pearson correlation indicated that the activities of M. caesia and F. auriculata contributed by phenolic compounds. A total of 65 metabolites were tentatively identified by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHLPC-MS/MS). These findings suggested that the possible application of M. caesia and F. auriculata as a functional food with antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory properties. © 2021, The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (lmk.) de Wit) (leed tree) seeds have been fermented by Indonesian as a traditional food which is called tempeh. The fermentation products of legume seeds are good functional foods, since they contain many bioactive compounds. The objective of this study was to determine the bioactive compound contents of fermented lead tree seed, such as total phenolic, ascorbic acid, β-carotene and α-tocopherol. Antioxidant activity testing was carried out using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) method. Analysis of total phenolics, ascorbic acid, β-carotene and α-tocopherol were carried out using the folin-ciocalteu method, iodine titration, spectrophotometry and iron (III) chloride-thiocyanate, respectively. Rhizopus oligosporus was used to ferment lead tree seeds for 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 days. Fermented leed tree seed powder was extracted with petroleum ether followed by ethanol. In comparison to unfermented leed tree seed powder, the β-carotene and α-tocopherol of the fermented seed powder increased. The greatest enhancement of β-carotene and α-tocopherol contents were observed at day 2 of fermentation. The highest antioxidant activities of fermented leed tree seeds were also obained at day 2 of fermentation with 55.55±4.59 and 74.46±3.49% inhibition in petroleum ether and ethanol extracts, respectively. The results show that lead tree seed tempeh has high antioxidant activity due to the bioactive compounds contains, such as phenolics, β-carotene and α-tocopherol. Therefore, leed tree seed tempeh could be used for possible commercial production of functional food to alleviate oxidative stress. © 2021, Universitas Jenderal Soedirman. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines the different plants visited by the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) during the honey harvest season (August to November) 2012. The work consisted in identifying the corbicular pollen pellets collected by the bees in one apiary in the village of Huejotitan, municipality of Jocotepec, state of Jalisco, Mexico. Three hives were selected and sampled monthly by means of Ontario modified pollen traps. The samples were tagged and frozen and later processed by acetolysis technique to remove the exine; permanent glycerine slides were made for the preservation and analysis. Identification and counting of pollen grains was performed using an Olympus BH-2® upright microscope equipped with a 100X ocular micrometer to measure each individual species pollen grain, using immersion oil. Wild plants in bloom were also collected monthly, tagged, pressed and taken to the herbarium for identification; the pollen was extracted, processed and identified for a reference collection that served as an ancillary means of identification and as a seasonal reference to the blooming species. In the corbicular pollen, 23 types of plants were identified: 13 at species level, five at genus level and five at family level belonging to 17 plant families. Myrtaceae resulted the most frequently represented family followed by Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Lamiaceae. © 2021 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: Bark from trees is considered a worthless raw material. However, this resource could be economically beneficial if utilized efficiently due to its rich chemical compounds. In this study, an ethanol toluene-soluble extractive, alpha-cellulose and lignin obtained from Leucaena leucocephala bark were characterized to determine their chemical functional groups. Based on FTIR spectral analysis, the results indicated that the bands of the functional groups of the extractive from the original bark remain unchanged; however, the absorbance intensity was found to be weaker in the group frequency and fingerprint regions. Removal of extractive, pectin, hemicellulose and lignin from the bark indirectly increased the strong absorbance intensity of cellulose. Broad peaks of OH stretching found in all spectra were assigned to the presence of phenolic OH and aliphatic structures for extractive and aromatic structures of lignin. It was revealed that aromatic functional groups were mainly found in the extractive, while water, carbonyl and ether were the dominant groups in cellulose, and methyl, methylene, carbonyl and carboxyl groups were enriched in lignin.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.), a leguminous invasive exotic plant is often present in tropical fragmented forests. This study was conducted in the green area of Suranaree University of Technology (SUT) in Northeastern Thailand to evaluate the relationship between Leucaena abundance and native plant species (tree and climber) diversity. Species data of the entire line transects were ranked according to Importance Value Index (IVI) to describe overall species distribution within fragments for trees, saplings, and seedlings separately. Random 80 m segments of nine line transects were selected within 9 selected forest fragments to record species diversity and abundance in a standardized manner. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) comparisons among the Shannon diversity index and species richness (as native species diversity variables) were modeled dependent upon Leucaena stem density and propagule pressure (as Leucaena abundance variables). The cluster diagram of similarity between species abundance and comparison of Sorenson similarity index (p diversity among fragments) did not reveal a significant relationship between native species diversity and Leucaena abundance based on fragments. Rank abundance curves showed establishment of secondary native species under the Leucaena dominant canopy. As the result of IVI ranking, same six native species were at the top in tree, sapling, and seedling stages. Thus, at SUT Leucaena may be acting as nurse crop (or even a pioneer species) in severely disturbed mixed deciduous forest fragments. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This study estimated 18.35 Mg C/ha in standing biomass of natural forest and 15 Mg C/ha in Hardwickia binata Roxb. plantation in a tropical dry deciduous forest located in the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. The study area of Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM), Bhopal, resembled a degraded dry scrubland in 1988 and for over about three decades, the degraded forest recovered remarkably, and ecological processes evolved favorably with canopy cover reaching over 60% in some patches and about 50% in general at most part of the campus. The study was conducted in 18 randomly laid plots in natural forest and over one-acre (0.405-ha) plantation area of Hardwickia binata for assessing the above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass and subsequent carbon content. The lower-diameter classes accounted for the maximum above-ground biomass, basal area and tree density. The forest is predominantly occupied by Leucaena leucocephala, an exotic tree species which showed higher standing biomass carbon storage of 3.79 Mg C/ha followed by Holoptelea integrifolia (2.11 Mg C/ha), Azadirachta indica (1.29 Mg C/ha), Gardenia latifolia (1.26 Mg C/ha) and Lannea coromandelica (1.24 Mg C/ha) besides Hardwickia binata plantation (15 Mg C/ha). It is recommended to plant and promote local native tree species in the urban forests of tropical dry deciduous nature as a means to mitigate climate change effects. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - A large number of anti-corrosion coatings containing volatile solvents with aliphatic hydrocarbons, formaldehyde and benzene are produced annually with the risk of releasing harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air. In this study, a commercial coating product for protecting steel is compared with the newly formulated green coating for the quantification of VOC content. The comparison was executed using the mass difference method following ASTM D2369-03. The extract and formulated coating were also subjected to optical, electrochemical and morphological studies, ie, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Scanning Electron Microscope/Energy Dispersive X-Ray (SEM/EDX). Based on the extract characterization, functional groups of hydroxyl, carboxylic acid and carbonyl with wavenumbers of 3350.cm-1, 2947.23 cm-1 and 1053.13 cm-1, respectively were identified. Also, coating with 3 wt.% of Leucaena leucocephala leaves extract (LLE), P2 showed a consistent optimum performance in reducing corrosion until the 40th day with a rate of 3.14 x10-3 mm/year. The P2 sample was later subjected to VOCs content analysis, and the outcome displayed a lower VOCs content of 345.40 g/L compared to a commercial product, which fulfilled the standard requirement for low-VOC paint by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Hence, it can be concluded that the developed green anticorrosion coating possessed low VOCs content with excellent abilities in protecting steel exposed to an aggressive environment. © Penerbit UMT

AB  - In recent years, the increasing price of protein-rich feed ingredients and retraction of antibiotic growth promoters from diets have become serious problems for broiler producers worldwide. Plant leaves are considered as alternative and cheap protein-rich feed ingredient for broilers owing to their high protein content. Studies have also shown that fermented plant leaves could serve as natural growth promoter, which is beneficial for broilers during the post-antibiotic era. Fermented leaves can also be used as natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents for broilers as they consist of phytochemical compounds. This review presents the effects of dietary incorporation of fermented plant leaves on growth performance, physiological condition, and meat characteristics of broiler chickens based on the most recent literature. © 2021 Istanbul University.

AB  - The present study was carried out to know the grazing behavior and the botanical composition of the diet selected by sheep grazing a meadow of “African star” (Cynodon plectostachyus) in monoculture and the same grass associated with Leucaena leucocephala and Guazuma ulmifolia, in two seasons of the year (yr). The variables obtained in a period of 12 hours (h) were: the times of grazing, browsing, rumination and rest under the sun or under the shade of the trees, also the frequency of urine and consumption was obtained in a space of 24 h of water. On the other hand, the botanical composition of the diet selected by each animal and the rectal temperature of the sheep grazed in both types of meadows during the sack and rain season were measured. The results indicated that the grazing time of the sheep was not modified by the type of pasture in both seasons of the yr. The rumination time was longer and the rest time was shorter in the sheep grazing in the wooded meadow. It was found that the body temperature taken by straight route decreased 0.25 and 0.38 °C in the dry and rainy season, respectively, in relation to the animals that grazed in monoculture meadows. Sheep ate more tree foliage and drank more water during the dry season, associated with higher browsing activity. In conclusion, the silvopastoral system favorably modifies the daily activities of grazing sheep and provides greater comfort and well-being to the animals. © (2021). All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Background: Dry Forest can be recovered with restoration plantings. Selection of tree species for restoration plantings depends on its successful performance under the adverse conditions of degraded areas. Hypotheses: Early-successional legume species have higher survival in degraded areas. Studied species: Twelve native tree species from the dry forest. Study site and dates: Pastures excluded from cattle ranching activities in Quilamula, Tlaquiltenango, Morelos, Mexico for 28 months, from July 2017 to October 2019. Methods: Experimental plantings of 12 tree species (N= 1,080 juveniles). Survival was registered in October 2017, June and October 2018, and in October 2019. Results: Early-successional tree species showed higher survival (27 %) than late- successional species (20 %). Legumes showed higher survival (25 %) than non-legumes (22 %). Early non-legume species and late-successional legumes had similar and higher survival (> 30 %) than early-successional legume species (< 18 %). Conclusions: To ensure the success of restoration plantings and accelerate the recovery of the forest, it is suggested to plant a mix of early-successional species (i.e., Dodonaea viscosa Jacq. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit) and as many late-successional legumes and non-legumes species as possible. On © 2021 Sociedad Botanica de Mexico, A.C. All rights reserved.

AB  - Taro (Colocasia esculenta L. cv. Latiraj) is a vegetable for many people in tropical and sub-tropical countries in the world. Because of large quantities of vitamins and minerals, it has considerable value in the food market. As the Taro has raised market demand, it needs to increase production as much as possible. Agroforestry would be a possible production approach for Taro as it can be practised in a partially shaded conditions. The research aimed to evaluate the performance of Taro under woody perennials of Melia azedarach, Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia lebbeck and sole crop cultivation to get potential production and high financial return. This experiment was followed a single factor Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. The treatments were (1) sole cropping of Latiraj, (2) Latiraj-Melia azedarach, (3) Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck and (4) Latiraj-Leucaena leucocephala. The results showed the maximum number of stolon per plant (29.50) found in Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck and noted the minimum number of stolon (19.17) was in Latiraj-Leucaena leucocephala. Also, the highest stolon length (60.85 cm) and girth (3.33 cm) were observed in Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck and Latiraj-Melia azedarach, respectively. Moreover, the highest stolon yield (10.08 ton/ha) was obtained from Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck compared to (9.85 ton/ha) Latiraj sole cropping. The maximum benefit-cost ratio (4.78) was recorded in the Latiraj-Albizia lebbeck, 24% higher than (3.62) Latiraj sole cropping for economic performance. Finally, it was found that the Taro cv. Latiraj cultivation under Albizia lebbeck as an agroforestry practice would be a sustainable strategy to maximize the production, touching financial benefit and ensuring the proper utilization of vacant woodlots space. © 2021.

AB  - Boron foliar sprays have been shown to increase marketable yield and fruit quality of tomato. Furthermore, the demand for organic produce is increasing due to consumer requirements for a healthy and safe product to eat. This greenhouse trial aimed to determine the effects of application methods and doses of liquid organic boron fertilizer. This fertilizer is made from green manure (Leucaena leucocephala leaves: Pennisetum purureum leaves: Musa acuminate stem: Allium cepa group Aggregatum bulb 2:2:1:0.1/v:v:v:v).The effects liquid organic boron fertilizer on growth and yield of tomatoes grown hydroponically were studied. The study used a split-plot experimental design. The main plot was the application method of foliar and basal sprays. The subplot was the concentration of liquid boron organic fertilizer (4.10%B) was applied at 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150 mL L-1. The results showed no interactions between the method and the concentration of liquid organic boron fertilizer (LOBF) on growth and yield of tomato plants. However, the concentration of liquid organic fertilizer significantly affected tomato growth and the yield. An application rate of 25 mL L-1 of liquid organic boron fertilizer increased the number of flower clusters by 22%. It also increased fruit yield plant-1 by 18% and increased the number of tomato fruit plant-1 by 14% compared to the control treatment (no liquid organic boron fertilizer). Results showed that foliar spray more efficient than basal spray. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reducing costs of implementation and maintenance of restoration activities is crucial for a project’s success. In order to achieve it, direct seeding and the use of green manure species have been proposed as potential alternatives. Here, we compare some preliminary results on seedlings performance and cost on four restoration techniques including these alternatives in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. In 16 plots, we established: (1) conventional seedling planting of 20 native species (2×3m spacing between plants), (2) direct seeding of Senna alata among the seedlings of the 20 native species; (3) direct seeding of Cajanus cajan among seedlings of the 20 native species and; (4) direct seeding of Leucaena leucocephala in the inter-row of the 20 native species seedlings. A year later seedling performance (survival and growth) resulted similar among these four techniques. However, costs of using Senna and Cajanus were consistently lower, mainly during the maintenance phase due to the reduction of fertilization and individual protection needs. Introducing green manure species by direct seeding may be a useful strategy to complement and eventually replace planting seedlings of other high-growth rate species to rapidly cover the soil surface. This approach may partially reduce some financial costs, particularly at the early stages of projects. Other strategies should be evaluated to complement our results. © 2020 University of Sao Paolo.

AB  - Galactomannans are naturally occurring biocompatible and biodegradable nonionic polysaccharides comprised of mannose and galactose residues. They are under investigation for the design of various drug delivery carriers such as matrix tablets, microparticles, nanoparticles/nanocomposites, polymeric micelles, hydrogels, as well as pharmaceutical excipients. Amongst galactomannans, guar gum, locust bean gum, and fenugreek gum are the biomaterials mostly investigated for their potential utility as nanocarriers for various purposes, either in their native or modified forms. The galactomannan-based nanomaterials have been fabricated by adopting various strategies. These galactomannan nanomaterials have been tested for oral vaccination, oral insulin delivery, cancer cell & macrophage targeting, controlled drug delivery, heavy metal extraction and wound dressing applications. The galactomannan has attracted the attention of researchers as reducing agents for the green synthesis of metal nanoparticles as well. These nanometals have shown improved antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer activities. In vitro toxicity of the nanomaterials is also assessed in some instances. Others such as cassia gum, tara gum, Delonix, Leucaena leucocephala, Punica granatum galactomannans are amongst the least studied materials for biological applications. This review describes various strategies adopted for the synthesis of galactomannan-based nanomaterials, their properties and applications, especially in the field of drug delivery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of rumen-degradable-to-undegradable protein ratio in ruminant diet on in vitro digestibility, rumen fermentation, and microbial protein synthesis
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104460500&doi=10.14202%2fVETWORLD.2021.640-648&partnerID=40&md5=9c831d27503a57cb987691e84a7631e7
AB  - Background and Aim: Feeding ruminants must notice the degradability of feed, especially protein. Microbial rumen requires ammonia from rumen degradable protein (RDP) beside that ruminant require bypass protein or rumen undegradable protein (RUP) and microbial crude protein. The aim of the study was to discover the best RDP:RUP ratio in beef cattle diets commonly used by Indonesian farmers using an in vitro methodology. Materials and Methods: Samples of Pennisetum purpureum, Leucaena leucocephala, Indigofera zollingeriana, cassava, maize, palm kernel cake, rice bran, and tofu waste were formulated into dietary treatments (dry matter [DM] basis). All experiments were carried out using a 3×3×2 factorial, randomized block design with three replications. Treatments consisted of three protein levels (12%, 14%, and 16%), two energy levels (65% and 70%), and three RDP:RUP ratio levels (55:45, 60:40, and 65:35). The experimental diets were incubated in vitro using buffered rumen fluid for 48 h at 39°C. After incubation, the supernatants were analyzed to determine pH, ammonia concentration, total volatile fatty acid (VFA), and microbial protein synthesis. The residues were analyzed to determine DM, organic matter, protein, and RUP digestibility. Results: Increased protein, energy, and RDP levels increased digestibility, ammonia concentrations, total VFAs, and microbial protein synthesis (p<0.05), while rations with 16% protein lowered these parameters (p<0.05). Conclusion: Increased dietary protein (from 12% to 14% DM), energy (from 65% to 70% DM), and RDP (from 55% to 65% crude protein [CP]) levels increased nutrient digestibility, ammonia concentration, total VFA levels, and microbial protein synthesis. The diet containing 14% DM dietary protein and 70% DM energy, which contained 55%, 60%, or 65% CP RDP optimally increased nutrient digestibility, ammonia concentration, total VFA levels, and microbial protein synthesis. Thus, feed based on these RDP:RUP ratios can optimize ruminant productivity. © 2021 Veterinary World. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of Sodium Hypochlorite Concentration during Pre-treatment on Isolation of Nanocrystalline Cellulose from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) Mature Pods
PY  - 2021
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134155012&doi=10.15376%2fbiores.16.2.3137-3158&partnerID=40&md5=4458b0b7dc0ad9ef89c5136f106c22ff
AB  - Mature pods of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit were utilized as raw material for nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) production. NCC's isolation begins with L. leucocephala fiber's alkaline treatment with sodium hydroxide, followed by bleaching treatment at three different percentages (3%, 5%, and 7%) of sodium hypochlorite. Acid hydrolysis was then conducted to obtain NCC, which was comprehensively characterized in terms of morphology, chemical functional groups, whiteness index, and crystallinity. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and chemical composition results showed that alkali treatment (NaOH) and bleaching (3%, 5%, and 7% of sodium hypochlorite, NaClO) were effective in the removal of lignin and hemicellulose. The variation of sodium hypochlorite concentration affected physical and structural characteristics of the NCC produced, which exhibited a rod-shaped structure with diameters ranging from 17 to 49 nm. These observations provide insight into the potential utilization of L. leucocephala as raw material for preparing nanocellulose, which may address problems of the underutilized mature pods. © 2021, North Carolina State University.

AB  - The aim of this research work is to develop polyesteramide [LMPEA] nanocomposite coating material [LMPEA/Ag] using N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) fatty amide obtained from non-edible Leucaena leucocephala [LL] seed oil [LLO], and maleic anhydride, reinforced with silver nanoparticles [SNPs], biosynthesized in Leucaena leucocephala leaf extract. UV, XRD, TEM, and particle size analyses confirmed the biosynthesis of NP (37.55 nm). FTIR and NMR established the structure of LMPEA formed by esterification reaction, without any solvent/diluent. Coatings were mechanically strong, well adherent to substrate, flexibility retentive, hydrophobic, and antimicrobial as evident from good scratch hardness (2-3 kg), impact resistance (150 lb per inch), bend test (1/8 inch), high water contact angle measurement value (109°) relative to pristine LMPEA coating (89°), and broad-spectrum antimicrobial behavior against MRSA, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, A. baumannii, and C. albicans. LMPEA and LMPEA/Ag exhibited high corrosion protection efficiencies, 99.81% and 99.94%, respectively, in (3.5% w/v) NaCl solution for 20 days and safe usage up to 200 °C. The synthesized nanocomposite coatings provide an alternate pathway for utilization of non-edible Leucaena leucocephala seed oil through a safer chemical synthesis route, without the use/generation of any harmful solvent/toxic products, adopting "Green Chemistry"principles.  ©

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The prevalence and distress caused by erectile dysfunction (ED) to both male and female partners are increasing at a steady rate. ED has now become the most treated sexual disorder for men among young and old age groups due to varying physical and psychological factors. The treatment with synthetic Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors are cost-effective but due to adverse effects such as priapism, loss of vision, heart attack and syncope, the daily life patterns of these patients are distressed and hence the need for alternative medicaments or sources are of utmost important. Therefore, the exploration of medicinal plants as PDE5 inhibitors will be worthwhile in tackling the problems as many plant extracts and fractions have been long used as aphrodisiacs and sexual stimulants which may be found to be active against PDE5 enzyme. Aim of the study: To provide a review on the different medicinal herbs traditionally used as natural aphrodisiacs, libido or sexual enhancers which are proven for their PDE5 inhibitory effect. Materials and methods: Ethnobotanical and scientific information was procured, reviewed and compiled from the literature search of electronic databases and search engines. Results: A total of 97 medicinal plants exhibiting PDE5 inhibitory effect are reviewed in this paper which is supported by preclinical experimental evidence. Among them, 77 plants have been selected according to their traditional and ethnobotanical uses as aphrodisiacs and the rest are screened according to their effectiveness against predisposing factors responsible for ED and sexual dysfunction such as diabetes and hypertension or due to the presence of phytochemicals having structural similarity towards the identified natural PDE5 inhibitors. In addition, sixteen alkaloids, sixty-one phenolics and eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been isolated or identified from active extracts or fractions that are exhibiting PDE5 inhibitory activity. Among them, isoflavones and biflavones are the major active constituents responsible for action, where the presence of prenyl group for isoflavones; and the methoxy group at C-5 position of flavones are considered essential for the inhibitory effect. However, the prenylated flavonol glycoside, Icariin and Icariside II isolated from Epimedium brevicornum Maxim (hory goat weed) are the most effective inhibitor, till date from natural sources. Traditional medicines or formulations containing extracts of Ginkgo biloba L., Kaempferia parviflora Wall. ex Baker, Clerodendrum colebrookianum Walp., Eurycoma longifolia Jack and Vitis vinifera L. are also found to be inhibitors of PDE5 enzyme. Conclusion: The review suggests and supports the rational use of traditional medicines that can be further studied for the development of potential PDE5 inhibitors. Many traditional medicines are still used in various regions of Africa, Asia and South America that are poorly characterized and experimented. Despite the availability of a vast majority of traditional formulations as aphrodisiacs or sexual stimulants, there exists a need for systemic evaluation on the efficacy as well as the mechanism of action of the herbal constituents for the identification of novel chemical moieties that can be further developed for maximum efficacy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Cinambo River flood control channel in the Rancabayawak impacts the decline in the habitat quality of some herons, such as cattle egret [Bubulcus ibis (Linnaeus, 1758)], little egret [Egretta garzetta (Linnaeus, 1766)], and Javan pond-heron [Ardeola speciosa (Horsfield, 1821)]. Besides, many built-up areas due to the urbanization in peri-urban areas also impact habitat quality, such as the loss of plants commonly used as perching and nesting sites. Along with the development of Rancabayawak as a built-up area, it is essential to study the management of those birds. This study aims to reveal: 1) plants used as perching and nesting sites, 2) population size and distribution, and management efforts on B. ibis, E. garzetta, and A. speciosa in Babakan Rancabayawak Hamlet, Gedebage Subdistrict, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. A mixed-methods approach was applied in this study by calculating the estimated population and bird nests, plant inventory survey, and the installation of the A8 mini GPS. Bambusa vulgaris, Leucaena leucocephala, and Mimosa pigra are plants that are used as perching and nesting sites by B. ibis, E. garzetta, and A. speciosa. The estimated population mean of those birds was 630 individuals, 92 individuals, and 43 individuals, respectively, with the population average of those birds, is 1680 individuals. Three hundred twenty-nine nests (329) were found during the study. Based on distribution mapping, birds moved east and south, covering paddy fields in Rancaekek, Solokanjeruk, and Majalaya within a radius of 12 km. Management efforts can be conducted by not cutting down the plants that become nesting and perching sites and maintaining the wetlands in their habitats. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is an essential metalloid element for mammals. Nonetheless, both deficiency and excess of Se in the environment are associated with several diseases in animals and humans. Here, we investigated the interaction of Se, supplied as selenate (Se+6) and selenite (Se+4), with phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) in a weathered tropical soil and their effects on growth and Se accumulation in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. The P-Se interaction effects on L. leucocephala growth differed between the Se forms (selenate and selenite) supplied in the soil. Selenate was prejudicial to plants grown in the soil with low P dose, while selenite was harmful to plants grown in soil with high P dose. The decreasing soil S dose increased the toxic effect of Se in L. leucocephala plants. Se tissue concentration and total Se accumulation in L. leucocephala shoot were higher with selenate supply in the soil when compared with selenite. Therefore, selenite proved to be less phytoavailable in the weathered tropical soil and, at the same time, more toxic to L. leucocephala plants than selenate. Thus, it is expected that L. leucocephala plants are more efficient to phytoextract and accumulate Se as selenate than Se as selenite from weathered tropical soils, for either strategy of phytoremediation (decontamination of Se-polluted soils) or purposes of biofortification for animal feed (fertilization of Se-poor soils). © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biofuel industry is gradually growing as the market starts to shift the demand from non-renewable energy sources to renewable energy sources The aim of this study is to produce bioethanol from biomass feedstock which is Leucaena leucocephala. It is a potential lignocellulosic energy source as it contains high composition of carbohydrates which can be broken down into fermentable sugar through pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis prior to the fermentation into bioethanol. Screening for both upstream processing were conducted by OFAT experiments to optimize several parameters tested such as pretreatment temperatures and NaOH concentrations. Fermentation process was conducted in Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) conditions aided by Kluyveromyces marxianus UniMAP 1-1 as the fermenting microbes. This yeast is capable in converting sugar to ethanol at high temperature. The optimization of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis by using OFAT gave the optimum value for both process prior to fermentation. The ethanol obtained from this SSF Fermentation is 3.15 g/L of bioethanol from 25.0 g/L of total sugars in hydrolysate.

AB  - In recent decades in northwest Vietnam, Arabica coffee has been grown on sloping land in intensive, full sun monocultures that are not sustainable in the long term and have negative environmental impacts. There is an urgent need to reverse this negative trend by promoting good agricultural practices, including agroforestry, to prevent further deforestation and soil erosion on slopes. A survey of 124 farmers from three indigenous groups was conducted in northwest Vietnam to document coffee agroforestry practices and the ecosystem services associated with different tree species used in them. Trees were ranked according to the main ecosystem services and disservices considered to be locally relevant by rural communities. Our results show that tree species richness in agroforestry plots was much higher for coffee compared to non-coffee plots, including those with annual crops and tree plantations. Most farmers were aware of the benefits of trees for soil improvement, shelter (from wind and frost), and the provision of shade and mulch. In contrast, farmers had limited knowledge of the impact of trees on coffee quality and other interactions amongst trees and coffee. Farmers ranked the leguminous tree species Leucaena leucocephala as the best for incorporating in coffee plots because of the services it provides to coffee. Nonetheless, the farmers' selection of tree species to combine with coffee was highly influenced by economic benefits provided, especially by intercropped fruit trees, which was influenced by market access, determined by the proximity of farms to a main road. The findings from this research will help local extension institutions and farmers select appropriate tree species that suit the local context and that match household needs and constraints, thereby facilitating the transition to a more sustainable and climate-smart coffee production practice. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Tannin-rich forage as a methane mitigation strategy for cattle and the implications for rumen microbiota

AB  - Context: Methane from ruminant livestock systems contributes to the greenhouse effect on the environment, which justifies the adoption of novel feed strategies that mitigate enteric emissions. Aims: We investigated the effects of the condensed tannin (CT)-rich legumes Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala, Stylosanthes guianensis, Gliricidia sepium, Cratylia argentea, Cajanus cajan, Desmodium ovalifolium, Macrotyloma axillare, Desmodium paniculatum and Lespedeza procumbens on in vitro methane emissions and rumen microbiota for beef cattle. Methods: Four rumen-cannulated Nellore cattle grazing a tropical grass pasture were used as inoculum donors. Key results: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the abundance of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, methanogenic archaea and protozoa populations were reduced (P £ 0.05), whereas total ruminal bacteria were enhanced in the presence of CT. Our study also revealed a positive (P £ 0.05) relationship between CT and Fibrobacter succinogenes abundance. Reactive CT from L. leucocephala, D. paniculatum and L. procumbens resulted in decreased (P £ 0.05) isoacid content and methane production. Conclusions: L. leucocephala, D. paniculatum and L. procumbens have the potential to suppress rumen methanogenesis. However, in vitro fermentation of L. leucocephala resulted in greater (P £ 0.05) degradability percentages than the other two species. Implications: CT in legume species will have potential as part of an overall nutritional strategy to manipulate rumen microbiota and mitigate enteric methanogenesis in livestock production systems.  © 2021 CSIRO.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination in water is happening worldwide. Adsorption using activated carbon is a common choice for cleaning the wastewater. The drawback of activated carbon is the higher cost of production due to the need for high heat in the process. This work investigated on activated carbon produced from the abundantly available Leucaena leucocephala biomass in order to reduce the cost of raw material. The biomass was chemically activated at different activation temperatures. The produced activated carbon was characterized using SEM, FT-IR, surface analyzer, and TGA. Isothermic and thermodynamic studies were done to evaluate the adsorption properties of the activated carbon. It was found out that higher surface area can be obtained using the higher activation temperature. Higher NaOH to carbonized sample ratios also resulted in higher surface area for all activation temperatures, which are 662 m2g-1 for 700 °C activation temperature, 735 m2g-1 for 750 °C, and 776 m2g−1 for 800 °C. Isothermic studies showed that all of the activated carbon that is produced from Leucaena leucocephala biomass are fit to the Langmuir isotherm, regardless of any activation temperature. Lastly, the thermodynamic study found out the adsorption process is endothermic, reflected by the positive value of ΔHo. It can be concluded that Leucaena leucocephala is a promising alternative material for producing activated carbon. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The demand for cucumber has risen globally due to its nutraceutical properties and positive health effects. Recently, cucumber has been grown as an associate crop to maximize land-use efficiency. Therefore, this research aimed to find the maximum cucumber yield and economic feasibility under Albizia lebbeck, Melia azedarach, and Leucaena leucocephala woodlots-based agroforestry with mulching. The results revealed that the highest cucumber fruit yield (9.15 tons/ha) was attained by growing under Albizia lebbeck with dry water hyacinth mulch. Similarly, the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) was the highest (2.89) cucumber Albizia lebbeck woodlot agroforestry, twice as much as mono-cropping production. Thus, it would be concluded that cucumber grown under Albizia lebbeck woodlot agroforestry with dry water hyacinth mulch can be a cost-effective production practice for securing higher yields. © 2021, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - The phenolic compound, condensed tannin (CT), from plant-based foods has suggested to have a beneficial function in the biological system of the animal kingdom. However, there is a lack of information for a comprehensive understanding of their molecular weight (MW) and protein-binding affinity (PBA) evaluated in tropical plants as commonly used feedstuff. Therefore, we evaluated concentration, MW, and PBA of CT from selected tropical leaf peel. The four plant materials harvested, extracted, and purified as experimental groups were cassava (CV) leaves (Manihot esculenta Crantz.), Leucaena (LN) leaves (Leucaena leucocephala Lam. de Wit), Siamese neem (SN) leaves (Azadirachta indica A. Juss. var. siamensis Valeton), and mangosteen (MS) peels (Garcinia mangostana Linn.). A commercial quebracho tannin (QB) was used to compare simultaneously. MW was determined using the gel permeation chromatography and PBA was subsequently measured by assaying purified experimental groups in protein precipitation. We found that the ranges of CT and MW in selected plant materials were 1.2%-14.4% on a dry matter basis and 2.9-3.6 Da, respectively. The PBA was ranked in the ascending order as follows: MS peels < LN leaves < CV leaves < SN leaves. Of note, the SN leaves were higher than QB. Our results indicated that a higher concentration of MW of CT resulted in a greater PBA. In conclusion, SN leaves could be a promised tropical plant as a PBA modifier on the system biology of animal nutrition. © 2021 Siwaporn Paengkoum et al. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - As a preliminary study, this project aims to remove the copper (Cu II) from aqueous solutions using Leucaena leucocephala leaves. Effect of free cell and immobilized form of biosorbent on adsorption capacity were evaluated in this study. Kinetic models of pseudo-first order, second order and equilibrium isotherms of Langmuir and Freundlich were used to predict the efficiency of Cu2+ absorption by Leucaena leucocephala leaves adsorption system. The functional groups involved during the adsorption were identified using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) whereby the Leucaena leucocephala leaves has the large amount of hydroxyl functional groups at the wavelength of 3411.66 cm-1. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) were used to measure the metal concentration before and after the adsorption process. The maximum percentage removal of the Cu2+ was achieved by immobilized form of Leucaena leucocephala leaves as biosorbent in aqueous solutions with a 72.3% of removal. Adsorption kinetics of pseudo-second order was well fitted with the adsorption data with the R2 of 0.9622. In addition, the results reveal that Langmuir isotherm was the best model to explain the adsorption of Cu2+ using immobilized Leucaena leucocephala leaves with the R2 of 0.9974. This result showed that Leucaena leucocephala leaves as an effective and potential biosorbent for the adsorption of Cu2+ from the wastewater. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - In recent years, great focused has been placed on the development of low-cost adsorbents to be used for applications regarding treatment of wastewater. In this study, Leucaena leucocephala peel (LLP) was used for adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous solutions. The experiments were conducted at seven concentrations (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 mg L-1) and three temperatures (298, 308, 318 K). The obtained data were applied to adsorption isotherm, kinetic and thermodynamic calculations. The results showed that Freundlich isotherm was more appropriate compared to Langmuir and Temkin isotherms. The kinetic results indicated that the process fitted pseudo second order model with higher R2 values compared to pseudo first order and intra-particle diffusion models. Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy values were calculated for 298 K as 2.776 kJ mol-1, 6.262 kJ mol-1 and 11.699 J mol-1, respectively. © Yildiz Technical University, Environmental Engineering Department.

AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are the biggest threats to our forests. Afforestation is one way to sustain life and combat global warming. Unfortunately, high cost and hazard factors in handling of tree saplings and initial care after planting affect the success rate of afforestation projects. Seed ball technique is effective for propagating plants from seeds because the seeds are protected from external stress and predation. The present experiment investigated the applicability of this technique in afforestation programmes at three different locations for the establishment of subabul (Leucaena leucocephala), a tree fodder, which is a major source of grazing for forest animals. Seed balls was prepared using red soil and vermicompost at a ratio of 2:1 and mixed with 230-250 mL of water per kg of medium. Seed balls protected the seeds from biotic and abiotic stresses and the vermicompost provided nutrients and growth hormones which greatly improved the establishment and survival rate of subabul. Seed ball technique is recommended for forest regeneration and re-greening the earth surface. © 2021 Forest Research Institute Malaysia. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the chemical composition and gas production based on fermentation in the rumen of nine types of forage tropical feed commonly used, named mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni L. Jacq.), tayuman (Bauhinia purpurea), bamboo (Bambusa arundinaceae), canary (Canarium) indicum L.), tea (Camellia sinensis), ketapang (Terminalia catapa L.), lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala), tehtehan (Duranta repens), and turi (Sesbania grandiflora). Measurement of gas production in vitro was carried out at 7 observation points of hours (2, 4, 8, 16, 36, 48, 72). Tannin activity was measured using measurements of gas production divided into three groups with modified levels of polyethylene glycol (PEG), i.e., samples without PEG (P1); sample + PEG in the amount of 200 mgDM (P2); and PEG + samples of tannins contained in each forage based on literature studies (P3). The total content of tannin varied between 0.20-13.80%. The most optimal measurement of gas production was in the sample given PEG of 200mg/kg with a significant difference (P<0.05). From the result, it was found that the higher the tannin content, the lower of gas produced. The addition of PEG was proven to be able to optimize the digestibility value seen from the higher gas production. © 2021 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

AB  - Water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) manifest different levels of selectivity for different pastures and forages. Knowledge of feed selectivity is important to facilitate the design of efficient production systems that take into account optimal animal welfare. In this study, the selectivity of nine 18-month old female water buffaloes for Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium, and Moringa oleifera was evaluated. After 12 h of grazing Megathyrsus maximum, the animals were housed in individual shelters and 1.2 kg of leaves from each of the four tree species were offered to the animals simultaneously. The selectivity, measured as the intake of dry matter (DM), was highest for A. lebbeck (mean = 0.34 kgDM, SD = 0.05 kg), followed by L. leucocephala (mean = 0.30 kgDM, SD = 0.03 kg), M. oleifera (mean = 0.11 kgDM, SD = 0.05 kg), and G. sepium (mean = 0.10 kgDM, SD = 0.02 kg) (P < 0.01). The crude protein intake was highest for A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala. Notably, the less selected leaves were those of G. sepium and M. oleifera. This study suggests that the inclusion of A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala in silvopastoral systems may increase both the consumption and well-being of water buffaloes in the tropics. © Copyright © 2020 Galloso-Hernández, Rodríguez-Estévez, Alvarez-Díaz, Soca-Perez, Dublin, Iglesias-Gómez and Guelmes.

TI  - Development of Eco-friendly Dyeing Process Based on Caesalpinia sappan L. Bark, Cocos nucifera Fiber and Leucaena leucocephala Leaves
PY  - 2021

AB  - Natural dyes have begun to regain attention due to biodegradable nature and low negative impact on human health and the environment. Besides, the continuous development of color shades variants from several natural sources of newly available abundant natural dyes and their ability to produce high color intensity and high wash fastness has become a major consideration of their use in textile dyeing. This study has evaluated the potential utilization of Caesalpinia sappan L bark, Cocos nucifera fiber, and Leucaena leucocephala leaf as a single and combination natural dye material. In particular, the extracts of these natural dye materials are used to dye the cotton fibers by involving mordanting stages using alum and fixation using iron (II) sulfate, alum, and calcium oxide compounds. The quality of the resulting dyeing was evaluated by the intensity of the color and wash fastness against wet washing. The dyeing results showed the appearance of varied shades of color with the dominance of the typical reddish color of Caesalpinia sappan L. While the results of the analysis using Diffuse Reflectance Ultraviolet (DRUV) and the wash fastness using the staining scale method showed high color dyeing with the color intensity in the range 53.55% - 94.34% with wash fastness in the staining scale range 2 (less) – 4 (good). Specifically, in contrast to the behavior of dye AB, the AC staining scale increases with increasing dye C added (up to 50%) and decreases when dye C added increases to 75% (dye AC3) © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License

AB  - The current study evaluated the anthelmintic effect of different extracts of Leucaena leucocephala, Parkia platycephala, and Senna alata on trichostrongylid eggs and infective larvae and determined the potential active components of each plant. Dried and macerated plant material was concentrated using rotaevaporation to obtain the crude extract (CE), followed by solvent partitioning to obtain hexanic (HexE), acetatic (AcE), and butanolic (BuE) extracts used for phytochemical analysis and anthelmintic efficacy testing in vitro. All the crude and partitioned extracts tested showed inhibition activity in the hatching of trichostrongylid eggs. Larvicidal efficacy was observed at CE concentrations of 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mg/mL for P. platycephala and S. alata. However, L. leucocephala CE did not significantly reduce the number of living larvae in the tested concentrations. Chromatographic analysis revealed several active metabolites; gallic acid, ellagic acid, naringin, morin, and kaempferol on AcE of P. platycephala; gallic acid, rutin, and ellagic acid on BuE of P. platycephala; and gallic acid and naringin on BuE of L. leucocephala. The extracts of P. platycephala, L. leucocephala, and S. alata leaves showed egg hatching inhibition and larvicidal activity, probably produced by tannins and flavonoids, which may act alone or by synergism. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Raw biomass contained low energy and high moisture content which contributed to its limitation as energy source. However, the biomass properties can be improved via torrefaction method. Torrefaction is a biomass pretreatment method that is performed between 200-300 C using slow heating rate in an inert condition. In this study, Leucaena Leucocephala (Leucaena) was torrefied in a fixed-bed reactor at 20 C/min from 200-300 C at holding times of 20 min. The changes in the elemental and chemical properties of Leucaena were studied using a few methods of analysis such as proximate, elemental analysis and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer. When the torrefaction temperature was increased from 200 to 300 C, the oxygen to carbon (O/C) and hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio of torrefied Leucaena reduced significantly. From FTIR, the broad peak at wavenumber of approximately 3400 cm-1 due to the presence of OH group reduced in its intensity upon increasing torrefaction temperature from 200 to 300 C which indicated that the degree of hydrophobicity of torrefied Leucaena had improved. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The Leucaena leucocephala seeds (LLS) cotyledon proteins, globulins, and glutelins were independently hydrolyzed by Alcalase, Trypsin, and α-Chymotrypsin up to 180 min. The degree of hydrolysis (DH), antioxidant, ACE-inhibitory, and α-Amylase inhibition were assessed. The higher DH values were 76.75% and 82.71% for globulin α-Chymotrypsin, and glutelin Alcalase hydrolysates, respectively. The glutelin hydrolyzed with Trypsin showed the higher DPPH• antioxidant activity while the higher ABTS antioxidant activity was for globulin Alcalase hydrolysate after 180 min digestion. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was 95.44% for globulin-Alcalase hydrolysate at 180 min; while, for the α-Amylase inhibition assay, glutelin-Alcalase showed the highest values at 100 min of reaction. LLS cotyledon protein concentrates and hydrolysates with relatively low mimosine content were obtained after protein extraction. Such findings indicate the possibility of getting bioactive peptides from LLS cotyledon proteins using enzyme digestions and might be utilized for functional foods with physiological enhancer effects. © 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Structural insight of two 4-Coumarate CoA ligase (4CL) isoforms in Leucaena suggests targeted genetic manipulations could lead to better lignin extractability from the pulp
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089102707&doi=10.1007%2fs13205-020-02375-2&partnerID=40&md5=728e09bb36e5fe30c561a9641a4cfbdf
AB  - 4‐Coumarate: coenzyme A ligase (4CL) is a key enzyme involved in the early steps of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway. It is hypothesized to modulate S and G monolignol content in the plant. Lignin removal is imperative to the paper industry and higher S/G ratio governs better extractability of lignin and economics of the pulping process. This background prompted us to predict 3D structure of two isoforms of 4CL in Leucaena leucocephala and evaluate their substrate preferences. The 3D structure of Ll4CL1 and Ll4CL2 protein were created by homology modeling and further refined by loop refinement. Molecular docking studies suggested differential substrate preferences of both the isoforms. Ll4CL1 preferred sinapic acid (− 4.91 kcal/mole), ferulic acid (− 4.84 kcal/mole), hydroxyferulic acid (− 4.72 kcal/mole), and caffeic acid (− 4.71 kcal/mole), in their decreasing order. Similarly, Ll4CL2 preferred caffeic acid (− 6.56 kcal/mole, 4 H bonds), hydroxyferulic acid (− 6.56 kcal/mole, 3 H bonds), and ferulic acid (− 6.32 kcal/mole) and sinapic acid (− 5.00 kcal/mole) in their decreasing order. Further, active site residues were identified in both the isoforms and in silico mutation and docking analysis was performed. Our analysis suggested that ASP228, TYR262, and PRO326 for Ll4CL1 and SER165, LYS247 and PRO315 for Ll4CL2 were important for their functional activity. Based on differential substrate preferences of the two isoforms, as a first step towards genetically modified Leuaena having the desired phenotype, it can be proposed that over-expression of Ll4CL1 gene and/or down-regulation of Ll4CL2 gene could yield higher S/G ratio leading to better extractability of lignin. © 2020, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (petai Cina), Parkia speciosa Hassk. (petai), and Archidendron jiringa (Jack) I.C. Nielsen (jengkol) seeds extracts contain sulfhydryl compounds and have various therapeutic properties. The main objective of this research was to compare the effect of various ethanol concentration on the yield of extract and levels of sulfhydryl compounds from leguminous seeds. Dried seeds were macerated at room temperature (25∘C) with a ratio of solids and solvents was 1:10. The solvent concentrations used were 30%, 50%, 70% and 96% ethanol. The yield of extract was expressed as the ratio of the weight of extract to the weight of dried seeds, the level of sulfhydryl compound was expressed as reduced L-glutathione (GSH) equivalent. The level of sulfhydryl compounds was determined by Ellman reagent and further analyzed using a spectrophotometer at 411 nm wavelength. Stink bean produced the highest yield of extract, while the highest level of sulfhydryl compounds was obtained from petai cina seed extract. The concentration of ethanol gave a significant difference to the yield of extract and the level of sulfhydryl compounds. The results showed that ethanol concentration affected the efficiency of the extraction of total sulfhydryl compounds and the yield of the extract on leguminous seeds. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

The treatments used under experimentation are (T1) 100% RDF through Vermicompost (5t ha-1), (T2) 100% RDF throw Neem Cake (2.5t ha-1), (T3) 100% RDF throw FYM (12t ha-1), (T4) 50% RDF through Vermicompost + 50% RDF Neem cake, (T5) 50% RDF through Neem cake + 50% RDF FYM, (T6) 50% RDF through Vermicompost + 50% RDF FYM, (T7) 50% RDF through Vermicompost + 25% RDF Neem cake +25% RDF FYM and (T0) control. Findings revealed that the treatment (T7) 50% RDF through Vermicompost + 25% RDF Neem cake +25% RDF FYM emerged superior in respected of growth attributes as well as yield of coriander and gave maximum seed yield (19.76 q ha-1) followed by treatment (T4) 50% RDF through Vermicompost + 50% RDF Neem cake, with seed yield (16.06 q ha-1) while minimum was recorded in control. As far as economic concern, maximum C:B ratio T7 (1: 2.38) and Net Return T7 (Rs. 45,802/-) was found. Therefore, asystematic coriander cropping with sufficient management practices will be more beneficial for livelihood on a sustainable basis. © 2020 Plant Archives. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interest in the carbon sink and bio-chemical potentiality of plants has increased efforts to explore the opportunities for climate change mitigation, to meet the growing bioenergy demand. This study was conducted with the objective to quantify the carbon sink and bio-chemical potentiality of Leucaena leucocephala and Peltophorum pterocarpum. Outstanding physiological performance, measured as photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf chlorophyll content and biomass production was observed to be the highest in L. leucocephala. Leucaena leucocephala was found to be active in photosynthesis at very high CO2 concentrations. Likewise, L. leucocephala had a higher lignocellulose composition than P. pterocarpum. Also, a higher alpha-cellulose and hemicellulose content was observed in thin roots than in coarse roots and stem bark, while stem bark and coarse roots had higher level of lignin content. Overall results revealed that L. leucocephala had a good carbon sink potentiality and appeared to be a promising feedstock for high-value of biochemicals. Thus, it can be planted for climate change mitigation to fulfill future bioenergy and biochemical demand. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

TI  - Effects of rainfall levels on runoff and sediment yield of slope farmland in purple soil under different tillage and crop patterns
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100812477&doi=10.16843%2fj.sswc.2020.03.011&partnerID=40&md5=d83de79d975e78c9a300b0580d283e73
AB  - [ Background ] In order to select better tillage and crop patterns for soil and water conservation of slope farmland in the purple soil, the characteristics of soil and water loss were investigated. [Methods] Based on the data of rainfall, runoff and sediment yield from 1989 to 2016 at Soil and Water Conservation Experimental Station in Suining city, four periods were divided according to different patterns that include ridge and furrow tillage, economic and fruit forest, cross ridge and planting hedgerows. Runoff and sediment yield of different plots under different patterns were analyzed according to rainfall levels. [ Results] 1) Light rain and medium rain hardly caused soil erosion. The erosive rainfall was concentrated in June-August, which was mainly represented by rainstorm and heavy rain. 2) The effect of contour ridge and furrow treatment was the most obvious under heavy rain. Compared with downhill ridge in farmland, cross ridge reduced runoff yield by 50%-56% under large rainstorm and reduced sediment yield by 93%-95% under rainstorm significantly (P < 0. 05). Compared with Zea mays, planting Hemerocallis citrina Baroni in downhill ridge significantly reduced sediment yield by 88%-98% under heavy rain and rainstorm. Runoff and sediment yield of planting hedgerows was bigger than that of the control plots in the initial stage of planting hedgerows,which was significantly different under heavy rain. However, after three years of planting, hedgerows had great effects of reducing runoff and sediment, and the effect of Vetiveria zizanioides was better than that of Leucaena leucocephala. 3) Runoff and sediment yield of ridge and furrow plots during extraordinary rainstorm was significantly different from that during rainstorm and heavy rain. During large rainstorm, runoff yield of planting Hemerocallis citrina Baroni with downhill ridge was 6. 4 times of that during heavy rain, and the difference was significant. The sediment yield during large rainstorm was significantly different from that during rainstorm and heavy rain in cross ridge and downhill ridge plots. At the initial stage of planting hedgerow, runoff yield of hedgerow plots was no significantly different from that of no-hedgerow plots during different rainfall levels (P > 0. 05). While sediment yield of Amygdalus persica hedgerow plots was significantly different from that of no-hedgerow plots during large rainstorm and heavy rain. Three years after planting hedgerow, runoff and sediment yield during large rainstorm was significantly different from that during rainstorm and heavy rain. The runoff yield during large rainstorm was 3. 3-6. 6 times of that during rainstorm and heavy rain, meanwhile, sediment yield during large rainstorm was 8. 8-113. 5 times of that during rainstorm and heavy rain. [Conculsions] Overall, sediment reduction effect of various tillage and crop patterns is better than runoff reduction effect. With the increase of rainfall level, the sediment reduction rate was decreasing. Therefore, considering the agricultural management and economic benefits, the appropriate patterns should be selected according to the actual situation of sloping farmland. © 2020, Editorial Board of Science of Soil and Water Conservation.

TI  - Nutritional Quality, Voluntary Intake and Enteric Methane Emissions of Diets Based on Novel Cayman Grass and Its Associations With Two Leucaena Shrub Legumes

AB  - Methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation in cattle are an important source of greenhouse gases, accounting for about 40% of all agricultural emissions. Diet quality plays a fundamental role in determining the magnitude of CH4 emissions. Specifically, the inclusion of feeds with high digestibility and nutritional value have been reported to be a viable option for reducing CH4 emissions and, simultaneously, increase animal productivity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the nutritional composition and voluntary intake of diets based on tropical forages upon CH4 emissions from zebu steers. Five treatments (diets) were evaluated: Cay1: Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman (harvested after 65 days of regrowth: low quality); Cay2: cv. Cayman harvested after 45 days of regrowth; CayLl: cv. Cayman + Leucaena leucocephala; CayLd: cv. Cayman + Leucaena diversifolia; Hay: Dichantium aristatum hay as a comparator of common naturalized pasture. For each diet representing different levels of intensification (naturalized pasture, improved pasture, and silvopastoral systems), CH4 emissions were measured using the polytunnel technique with four zebu steers housed in individual chambers. The CH4 accumulated was monitored using an infrared multigas analyzer, and the voluntary forage intake of each animal was calculated. Dry matter intake (DMI, % of body weight) ranged between 0.77 and 2.94 among diets offered. Emissions of CH4 per kg of DMI were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in Cay1 (60.4 g), compared to other treatments. Diets that included Leucaena forage legumes had generally higher crude protein contents and higher DMI. Cay1 and Hay which had low protein content and digestibility had a higher CH4 emission intensity (per unit live weight gain) compared to Cay2, CayLl and CayLd. Our results suggest that grass consumed after a regrowth period of 45 days results in lower CH4 emissions intensities compared to those observed following a regrowth period of 65 days. Diets with Leucaena inclusion showed advantages in nutrient intake that are reflected in greater live weight gains of cattle. Consequently, the intensity of the emissions generated in the legume-based systems were lower suggesting that they are a good option for achieving the emission reduction goals of sustainable tropical cattle production. © Copyright © 2020 Gaviria-Uribe, Bolivar, Rosenstock, Molina-Botero, Chirinda, Barahona and Arango.

AB  - The in vitro fermentation kinetics and digestibility of six tropical grasses and five multipurpose tree species (MPTs) found in the Caribbean were determined by the current study. The in vitro gas production was measured and fitted to a dual and single pool model to determine the fermentation kinetics of these forages. The average rate of the fast pool (C1) for grasses was over 20% higher than that of the MPTs. The volume of the fast pool by the dual pool model (V1) for grasses was 40% lower and the slow pool (V2) 30% greater than that of the MPTs. There was a strong negative relationship between the fast pool of the dual pool model (V1) and the neutral detergent fibre (NDF) (r =-0.781) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) (r =-0.655) fractions and a positive relationship between the V1 and the digestible organic matter in dry matter (DOMD) (r = 0.537). Moringa oleifera was at the higher end of the range for the total gas production by the dual pool model (Vtscho) (132.1 ml/g DM) and single pool model (Vtorsk) (131.5 ml/g DM) at 48 hours which was followed by that of Gliricidia sepium (116.1 and 113.5 ml/g/DM respectively) and Morus alba (116.9 and 113.7 g/kg DM respectively). At 48 hours, the Vtscho and Vtorsk for Trichanthera gigantea and Leucaena leucocephala were at the lower end of the range for the forages (Trichanthera gigantea: 70.8 and 65.7 ml/g DM and Leucaena leucocephala: 89.1 and 86.2 ml/g DM for the dual and single pool models respectively). Moringa oleifera was at the higher end of the range for the total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production whereas Trichanthera gigantea was at the lower end of the range. All MPTs except Trichanthera gigantea and Leucaena leucocephala, were more fermentable than the grasses and based on chemical composition, in vitro digestibility, fermentation parameters and end products, Moringa oleifera and Morus alba demonstrated overall high performance whereas Trichanthera gigantea performed poorly. © 2021 Trop.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala leaves and Trigonella foenum-graecum seeds are reported to have antidiabetic activity. This research studied the interactions of chemical constituent molecules from Leucaena leucocephala and Trigonella foenum-graecum to antidiabetic macromolecules targets namely dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B), glucokinase, as well as α-glucosidase, and predicted the pharmacokinetics profiles of active predicted compounds. Molecular docking of all ligands was conducted using AutoDock Vina in PyRx and the results were presented as binding affinity values (kcal/mol) of ligand against protein. Program PyMol were used to visualize the 3D molecular of docked conformation and ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacokinetics profiles were predicted by SwissADME. The result showed that kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside contained in Leucaena leucocephala had best value of binding affinity on protein dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (-9.2 kcal/mol) and α-glucosidase (-8.8 kcal/mol). While luteolin-7-glucoside on protein glucokinase (-9.5 kcal/mol) and tyrosine phosphatase-1B (-9.5 kcal/mol). Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside and luteolin-7-glucoside were predicted to have low gastrointestinal absorption and cross the blood brain barrier. © 2020 Author(s).

AB  - Vermicomposting of pressmud with cow dung and nitrogenous green manures (Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala) was carried out using Eudrilus eugeniae (50 days). The reduction in pH, total organic carbon, C/N ratio, water-soluble organic carbon (Cws)/Norg and C/P ratios, and a pronounced increase in NPK contents and microbial population in vermicompost were observed. An enhanced TKN of 3.80% and 3.45% was recorded in vermicomposts of pressmud + cow dung + L. leucocephala (2:1:1) and pressmud + cow dung + G. sepium (2:1:1) respectively. The C/N and Cws/Norg ratios in vermicompost ranged from 11.86 to 16.66 and 0.53 to 1.33, respectively. The activity of dehydrogenase, urease, acid and alkaline phosphatase declined towards the end, indicating the progression of vermicompost maturity. The pressmud and green manure substrates promoted more biomass of E. eugeniae, while cow dung with green manure combination favored reproduction. The amendment of cow dung and green manure plants to pressmud (2:1:1 ratio) results in nutrient-enriched vermicompost production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fernando de Noronha (FN) is an oceanic archipelago in the northeast coast of Brazil, approximately 360 km away from the continent. It is composed of 21 islands and the biggest (also named Fernando de Noronha) has 16.4 km2 and is inhabited since the 17th century. The archipelago is an important breeding site for several marine birds, including regionally threatened species such as Puffinus lherminieri, Sula sula, Phaethon aethereus, and Phaethon lepturus. It also contains critical habitat for endemic species such as the mabuia lizard (Trachylepis atlantica), Ridley's worm lizard (Amphisbaena ridleyi), and birds like the noronha elaenia (Elaenia ridleyana) and the noronha vireo (Vireo gracilirostris), all endangered. Since its discovery and colonization, FN's native species have been impacted by the arrival of several exotic and invasive species, especially domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus), dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), brown and black rats (Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus), house mice (Mus musculus), cururu-toad (Rhinella jimi), tegu lizard (Salvator merianae), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata), rock cavy (Kerodon rupestris), and the river tamarind (Leucaena leucocephala). Moreover, several zoonotic diseases, like salmonellosis and toxoplasmosis, have been linked to some of these invasive species. Until recently, the geographic isolation of FN from research centers, in combination to elevated operational costs in conducting research in this remote location, have prevented studies on FN's invasive species. However, recently established partnerships among governmental executive bodies, NGO's, research institutes and universities have promoted the development of research and management of invasive species on the archipelago. In this chapter, we describe and discuss the scientific advances of the last decade assessing the population demographics of FN's invasive species, their impacts, knowledge gaps, and required species management to conserve the native biodiversity of this unique Atlantic archipelago. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The objective of the study was to estimate the potential alterations in the areas with environmental aptitude (AA) and to establish the ecological descriptors for L. leucocephala; with the MaxEnt model and based on 19 bioclimatic variables and one edaphic, the distribution niche was modeled for the periods 1960-1990, 2041-2060 and 2061-2080. The climatic data were obtained from the Global Climate Data portal of WorldClim and worked with raster and ascii images with a resolution of 30 seconds of arc. For future climatologist, the general circulation model (MCG) was considered: GFDL-CM3 with two representative greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The results showed that for the reference climate (1960-1990), the area with AA for the species is 251 134 Km2, and it is located in the coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico, Sierra Madre Oriental, Occidental and del Sur, Sierra Norte of Puebla, Isthmus of Tehuantepec and part of the Yucatán Peninsula, and the environmental variables that contribute most to explain the distribution of the species are: photoperiod, precipitation of the wettest month, average temperature of the coldest month, accumulated precipitation from May to October and the average temperature from November to April. Regarding future climate scenarios, the projections are for a substantial increase in the area with AA, the 51 to 72 % for the RCP 8.5 and 4.5, respectively. Regarding the ecological descriptors of L. leucocephala, the environmental distribution ranges are wide, both for variables related to temperature and variables related to precipitation. © 2020 The authors.

AB  - Positive effects of a biochar-compost mix on soil nutrient status in infertile soil have been reported, but the potential effect of biochar amendments in excessive compost-fertilized soils has not been extensively studied. Excessive application of compost can result in the accumulation of nutrients and heavy metals (Cu and Zn). Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of biochar-excessive compost co-application on soil nutrient status. We hypothesized that biochar co-application could have positive effects on the absorption of excessive nutrients of Cu and Zn. A 371-day laboratory incubation study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de. Wit) biochar produced at 750 ° C on the dynamics of the soil nutrients. Three Taiwan rural soils were selected, including slightly acidic Oxisols (SAO), mildly alkaline Inceptisols (MAI), and slightly acid Inceptisols (SAI). The biochar treatments include control (0%) and 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% (w/w). In each treatment, 5% (w/w) poultry-livestock manure compost was added to test excessive application. The results indicated that the biochar treatments had a significant increase effect on soil pH, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), C:N ratio, and available K concentration. The effect of biochar on electrical conductivity (EC) and available P, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, and Zn was insignificant. The effect of biochar, with relatively low application rates (<2% by wt), low surface area, and less surface function group, was eliminated by excessive compost (5% by wt). In addition to carbon sequestration and nitrogen conservation, biochar addition has no effect on the absorption of the excessive nutrients Cu and Zn in three studied soils. © 2020 by the authors.

AIM: This study was investigate the antidiarrheal activity of the ethanol extracts of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit seeds induced by oleum ricini and intestinal transit methods for rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: L. leucocephala seeds were extracted by maceration with 80% ethanol. Evaluation of antidiarrheal extract activity was performed by induction of oleum ricini and intestinal transit methods. The extract at dose doses of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg BW was orally administered to the animals 1 h after induction by oleum ricini. Then diarrhea time, frequency, consistency, stool weight, and duration of diarrhea were observed every 30 min for 6 h. In determining the intestinal transit method, a percentage of the distance of the Chinese ink determined. This study was used positive control as Loperamide (1 mg/kg BW) and 0.5% Na-CMC as a negative control. RESULT: In diarrhea induced by castor oil, L. leucocephala seed extract at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg bw has been shown to significantly delay the onset of diarrhea, reduce diarrhea frequency, stool weight and duration of diarrhea compared with Na CMC as a negative control (p < 0.05). The extract at a dose of 400 mg/kg bw did not differ significantly from loperamide as positive control (p > 0.05). In this study, L. leucocephala extract reduced the distance traveled by Chinese ink in the intestine but only at a dose of 400 mg/kg bw which has a comparable activity with loperamide significantly. The antidiarrheal activity of extract showed at a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The ethanol extract of L. leucocephala seeds has antidiarrheal activity which supports its use in folk medicines. © 2020, Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala leaves extract (LLE) was incorporated as an additive in a new coating formulation. The coatings containing different wt.% of the extracts were analysed by optical characterizations and we proceeded to the antimicrobial assessment. The coating was applied onto the surface of stainless steel grade 316L and immersed in seawater for 50 days. A batch of specimens was collected every 10 days and evaluated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization and scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX). The incorporation of 3 wt.% LLE into the coating (P2) matrix remarkably boosted the barrier quality of the coating. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The world is facing serious threat due to global warming. Several measures have been proposed and the cost effective solution will be the "Tree Plantation". However, each tree has its own CO2 absorption rate and growth. Based on the literature review, Leucaena leucocephala plant has the highest CO2 absorption rate and higher rate of growth. Also it is a tropical tree which can be grown in waste land in rural areas. The tree has multiple benefits like its leaves being used as fodder and the stem as fire wood. In India 1,00,000 hectares of land has this plantation and it yields 12,000 MT of biomass per year. It has been found that 30% oil yield can be obtained from the seeds. This oil has a calorific value of 39 MJ/kg which can replace the fossil fuel consumption. However, the present research work identified another route for bio-oil production from the seeds. The present work attempted to utilize the seeds of Leucaena leucocephala for bio-oil production. © 2020 Author(s).

AB  - This research aimed to study the effects of enriched protein supply from tree legume leaves in a complete ration based on tropical grass andconcentrates fed to growing goats. The treatments were: EG: Dwarf Elephant Grass as control; GS: EG + Gliricidia sepium ; LL: EG + Leucaenaleucocephala; IZ: EG + Indigofera zolingeriana. Concentrates were included in all diets. Twenty male goats with body weight 13 - 15 kg wereallocated to two groups: 4 goats for digestibility study, and 16 goats for growth trial. Apparent digestibility coefficients, feed intake, live weight gain and feed conversion were improved when the diet of elephant grass and concentrateswas supplemented with leaves from legume forage trees. Indigofera zollingeriana appeared to support better growth performance than Leucaenaleucocephala or Gliricidia sepium. © 2020 Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gramineae do not meet the needs of ruminants in the tropics, and their marked seasonal production causes disadvantages in animal production; in addition, high fiber levels and low protein content result in a higher production of greenhouse gases (GHG). For this reason, this study intended to supplement the diet by adding different foliage levels of tropical trees with the objective of evaluating the effect of incorporating 15, 30, and 45% of Moringa oleifera, Leucaena leucocephala or Guazuma ulmifolia on a diet based on Cynodon nlemfuensis grass during ruminal fermentation in vitro. The methodology consisted of ten treatments with different inclusion percentages of three different trees; the chemical composition, in vitro ruminal fermentation, dry matter degradation (IVDMD), pH, volatile fatty acid concentration (VFAs), biogas production and emission of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were determined. Data were analyzed through a completely randomized design. The chemical composition of the diets showed differences (P < 0.05) when tree foliage was added gradually to the diet; the IVDMD was different (P < 0.05); pH of the treatments showed no differences (P > 0.05); VFA concentration was different (P < 0.05), the diet with 45% of Moringa oleifera had the best VFA concentration; however, the total biogas production and CH4and CO2concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) in the diet with 45% Leucaena leucocephala. In conclusion, the addition of 45% of Leucaena leucochephala to the diet improved chemical composition without affecting the VFA concentration and producing less CH4and CO2(18 and 24%, respectively). © 2020 Terra Latinoamericana.

AB  - The following paper presents research on the conversion of wood wastes accessible in Egypt into activated carbon. In this study, wood samples of four Egyptian tree species were used: Delonix regia, Leucaena leucocephala, Salix mucronata, and Tipuana tipu. The wood scraps were soaked in a KOH solution and then carbonized at 600 °C under the flow of nitrogen; the resulting materials were analyzed by means of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, low-temperature adsorption of nitrogen, and an investigation of the surface area using nitrogen sorption. The addition of a chemical activator facilitated an increase of the surface area up to 603 m2 g−1. In its second part, the work aims to experimentally confirm that synthesizing hybrid materials consisting of oligothiophene dye (OT) and the obtained activated carbon may contribute to improving the applicability of these carbons as dye adsorbents. Confocal microscopy, Raman spectra, and SEM-EDX microscopy were used to confirm the immobilization of oligomers on the surface of carbon hybrid materials. Confocal microscopy in particular is considered to be an appropriate technique of detecting the presence of adsorbed 6 T molecules on the carbon surface. The presented research is a major step towards the application of modified carbons as an attractive and inexpensive base for dye molecule adsorption. © 2020

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, Swietenia mahagoni, and Artocarpus heterophyllus commonly used in ruminant feeding practices and contains CT with the potential to reduce CH4 emissions and improve feed protein utilization. This study was aimed to determine the effect of the combination of Leucaena leucocephala, Swietenia mahagoni, and Artocarpus heterophyllus as a tannin source on in vitro ruminal fermentation kinetics. The combination leaves consist of Swietenia mahagoni (40%), Leucaena leucocephala (30%), and Artocarpus heterophyllus (30%). The levels of combination leaves which used were 0%, 50%, and 100% as forage sources (60%) and concentrate 40%. Feed fermentation was conducted using Menke and Steingass gas production technique for 48 hours. Kinetic of gas production was analyzed using the Fit Curve program. Data obtained were analyzed using one way ANOVA, and continued by DMRT. The results showed that gas production from soluble fractions (a) was not affected by the treatment. Gas production from the potentially degraded fraction (b) decreased significantly (P<0.05) at 100% combination leaves. The potential extent of gas production (a+b) decreased significantly (P<0.05) at 100% combination leaves. The gas production rate (c) increased significantly (P<0.05) at 100% combination leaves. Inclusion of 100% of combination leaves in the diet could reduce rumen gas production and the soluble and the potentially degraded fraction (a+b) and gas. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Liquid organic fertilizer (LOF) supplementation for solid organic fertilizer can accelerate the availability of plant nutrients. However, the nutrient content of LOF is highly dependent on its sources. The objective of the experiment was to examine the nutrient content of enriched liquid organic fertilizer from dairy cattle wastes. The experiment was conducted at Closed Agriculture Production System Research Station located in Air Duku Village, Bengkulu, Indonesia, at 1054 m above sea level. The experiment was laid out in a Completely Randomized Design with ten treatments and three replications. The treatments consisted of LOF from dairy cattle wastes enriched with Tithonia diversifolia, Ageratum conyzoides, Leucaena leucocephala, and Gliricidia sepium, their combination with phosphate rock, the combination of Tithonia diversifolia, and Ageratum conyzoides, and control. The LOF solution was anaerobically incubated for six weeks. The experiment indicated that during the incubation, solution pH declined for the first two weeks, gradually increased up to week 6. At the end of incubation, control exhibited the highest pH as compared to those with enrichment, indicating that decomposition of green biomass released a considerable amount of hydrogen. Enrichment of LOF considerably increased the contents of C, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg. The addition of phosphate rock to biomasses did not contribute a prominent increase in phosphorus content, possibly due to its low solubility at high pH. LOF enrichment with Tithonia diversifolia and Ageratum conyzoides had the highest N, P, and Mg contents. Therefore, the enrichment is the most potential for LOF production in closed agriculture system. © 2020, Insight Society.

AB  - Plants and plant-based products have been used for a long time for medicinal purposes. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant and anti-α-glucosidase activities of eight selected underutilized plants in Malaysia: Leucaena leucocephala, Muntingia calabura, Spondias dulcis, Annona squamosa, Ardisia elliptica, Cynometra cauliflora, Ficus auriculata, and Averrhoa bilimbi. This study showed that the 70% ethanolic extract of all plants exhibited total phenolic content (TPC) ranging from 51 to 344 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dry weight. A. elliptica showed strong 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide (NO) scavenging activities, with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 2.17 and 49.43 µg/mL, respectively. Most of the tested plant extracts showed higher inhibition of α-glucosidase enzyme activity than the standard, quercetin, particularly A. elliptica, F. auriculata, and M. calabura extracts with IC50 values of 0.29, 0.36, and 0.51 µg/mL, respectively. A total of 62 metabolites including flavonoids, triterpenoids, benzoquinones, and fatty acids were tentatively identified in the most active plant, i.e., A. elliptica leaf extract, by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)–electrospray ionization (ESI) Orbitrap MS. This study suggests a potential natural source of antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitors from A. elliptica. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Available forage biomass, botanical and forage chemical compositions, stocking rates, and resting times of plants after grazing were assessed in a silvopastoral system (using Voisin grazing) having 15,000 (D15) and 25,000 Leucaena leucocephala trees ha−1 (D25), associated with Digitaria eriantha. A randomized complete block design with two replicates was used. Biomass samples were collected from July 2017 to July 2018, when grass (during rainy and transition seasons) and trees (during the dry season) achieved their optimal resting points and sheep grazed paddocks (stock density: 34–204 AU ha−1 according to season). Biomass yield was higher in D25 (15,958 ± 1190 kg DM ha−1, p ' 0.05) with higher carrying capacity (2.93 ± 0.43 AU ha−1 year−1). Yield fluctuated over time (p ' 0.0001) with greater biomass (p ' 0.05) during the rainy (up to 3722 ± 121 kg DM ha−1), than in the transition (1800 ± 121 kg DM ha−1) and dry seasons (511 ± 121 kg DM ha−1). Between 59 and 65% of the biomass was grass during the transitional and rainy seasons, while during the dry season, 100% of the biomass was from the trees and crude protein was greater in trees (24%) than in grass (10%) biomass. Rest periods for the paddocks varied according to grazing season (from 31 to 120 days). Higher tree density increased forage biomass and yield in the silvopastoral system, which was maintained throughout the year even with seasonal precipitation because the trees sustained growth for an extended period during the year. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to determine the carcass and meat characteristics of male Kacang goat fattened by complete silage made from natural grass, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench and Pennisetum purpuphoides. Materials and Methods: This study examined 12 young male Kacang goats aged 10-12 months with an initial body weight of 10-12 kg. The livestock was divided into three groups randomly to receive feed treatments. The three treatments of this study included T1: Complete silage made from natural grass; T2: Complete silage made from S. bicolor (L.) Moench, and T3: Complete silage made from P. purpuphoides. Data were analyzed according to the analysis of variance procedure. Results: The carcass percentage of livestock T2 and T3 treatment was relatively similar but higher (p<0.05) than the T1 group. The non-carcass percentage of T2 and T3 was relatively the same but lower than T1. The water content of T1 treatment was higher (p<0.05) than T3, but relatively the same as T2 treatment. The collagen content of T2 and T3 was relatively the same but lower (p<0.05) than T1; likewise, the cholesterol of T2 and T3 treatments was relatively similar but higher than T1 treatment. The variables of slaughter and carcass weight, and non-carcass weight, meat protein content, acidity, cooking losses, water holding capacity, and tenderness were not significantly different between groups of animals. Conclusion: The use of S. bicolor (L.) Moench and P. purpuphoides as a basic forage in making complete silage has been shown to increase carcass percentage, the content (%) of fat, collagen, and cholesterol. Otherwise, the treatments have no effect on the content of pH, tenderness (kg/cm2), cooking loss (%), and water holding capacity (%) of male Kacang goat fattened. Therefore, S. bicolor (L.) Moench and P. purpuphoides plants have great potential to be developed by farmers/ ranchers as feed for goats. Copyright: © Tahuk and Bira. Open Access.

AB  - In the present work, the anthelmintic activity (AA) of ethanolic extracts obtained from Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Pithecellobium dulce was evaluated using the third-stage-larval (L3) exsheathment inhibition test (LEIT) and egg hatch test (EHT) on Haemonchus contortus. Extracts were tested at concentrations of 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL. The larval exsheathment inhibition (LEI) results showed that G. sepium achieved the highest average inhibition of 91.2%, compared with 44.6% for P. dulce and 41.0% for L. leucocephala at a concentration of 40 mg/mL; the corresponding IC50 values were 22.4, 41.7, and 43.3 mg/mL, respectively. The rates of egg hatching inhibition (EHI) at a concentration of 5 mg/mL were 99.5% for G. sepium, 64.2% for P. dulce, and 54% for L. leucocephala; the corresponding IC50 values were 1.9 mg/mL for G. sepium, 3.9 mg/mL for P. dulce, and 4.3 mg/mL for L. leucocephala. The species extracts studied here were also analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap/MS/MS), resulting in the compounds' identification associated with AA. Glycosylated flavonoids and methoxyphenols were observed in all three species: fatty acids in G. sepium and P. dulce; phenylpropanoids, anthraquinone glycosides, amino acids and glycosylated phenolic acids in G. sepium; and flavonoids in L. leucocephala. Comparatively, G. sepium presented a greater diversity of compounds potentially active against the control of gastrointestinal nematodes, which was associated with the results obtained in the applied tests. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - The mineral content of some tropical forages commonly used in small ruminant production systems in the caribbean – part 2
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107444888&partnerID=40&md5=4a554f9c06d1f2fb8edefb32e3d2efc0
AB  - Understanding the differences in the mineral concentrations of forages is critical as it informs on which and how species can be used to improve the mineral content of diets. Also, with the constantly changing nutritive value of forages, regulating the mineral composition through on-going forage evaluation is important as deficient minerals can be identified and supplemented. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide information on the mineral profiles for 12 forage species used in small ruminant production systems in the Caribbean. The forage species included seven grasses (Brachiaria arrecta, Brachiaria ruziziensis x), Cynodon dactylon, Cynodon, nlemfuensis, Digitaria eriantha, Megathyrsus maximus and Pennisetum purpureum); two leguminous multipurpose tree species (LMPTs) (Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala) and three non-leguminous multipurpose tree species (NLMPTs) (Moringa oleifera, Morus alba and Trichanthera gigantea). Overall, the calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, cobalt, manganese, and zinc were within the range required for small ruminants. Brachiaria arrecta and Digitaria eriantha were the only two species with Na concentrations that were within the range required for small ruminants (0.9626 and 4.4281 g/kg DM respectively). Brachiaria arrecta, Cynodon dactylon, Cynodon nlemfuensis, Leucaena leucocephala and Trichanthera gigantea were the only species with copper concentrations that were within the range required for small ruminants (11.50, 20.24, 11.95, 8.16 and 16.60 mg/kg DM). The concentration of potassium in Pennisetum purpureum (39.1 g/kg DM), Brachiaria arrecta (32.6 g/kg DM), and Cynodon nlemfuensis (34.0 g/kg DM), the concentration of iron in Cynodon dactylon (3340 g/kg DM) and molybdenum in both Cynodon dactylon (8.615 mg/kg DM) and Cynodon nlemfuensis (7.722 mg/kg DM) were above the maximum tolerable levels for small ruminants. The results of the study suggest that forages varied in mineral concentrations and the toxic and marginal concentrations of specific minerals in various forage species elicit the careful management of inclusion in diets, to ensure that the mineral concentrations are within the range required for small ruminants. © 2020 Trop.

AB  - Jinsha river dry-hot valley with a fragile ecology in Southwest China is characterized by hot and dry climate and serious vegetation degradation, that is difficult to rehabilitate the original ecosystem structure and functions. In order to study the adaptability of the introduced tree species to environment of Jinsha river dry-hot valley, photosynthetic physiological characteristics and chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics of Leucaena leucocephala were measured in dry season ( November) and wet season (July), respectively. The results showed that; (1) According to the Pn-C| response curves,net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in dry season was higher than that in wet season at C <150 (imol/mol, but it was lower at C> 150 fjimol/mol. (2) Compared with wet season, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), stomatal limitation (A,), initial carboxylation efficiency (CE) , photosynthetic capacity (/lniAl), C02 compensation point (T) , photorespiration rale (Rp) , the maximum carboxylation rate ( Vemu ) , the maximum electron transport rate ( J:iui) , triose phosphates utilization rate (TPU) , J^yy^, actual photochemical efficiency of PSII ( tf>psn ) , photochemical fluorescence quenching ( qP) , and electron transport rate (ETR) of Leucaena leucocephala decreased significantly in dry season (P<0.05). (3) Compared with wet season, intercellular CO, concentration (C ), stomatal conductance ( ), transpiration rate ( Tt), water use efficiency (WUE), light-saturated net photosynthetic rate ( Pnmsil) , <lark respiration rate ( Rd ) , and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) of Leucaena leucocephala significantly increased in dry season (P<0.05). (4) <X>pf;iI, NPQ and ETR, three indices of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, well correlated with photosynthetic physiological indices. In conclusion, the main factor influencing the photosynthetic rale of Leucaena leucocephala was the stomatal limitation in wet season, but it was non-stomatal limitation in dry season. © 2020 Science Press.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia nilotica are two arboreal legumes with several uses in agriculture, nutritious forage and livelihoods, fence posts, wood production, biofuel production, charcoal, firewood, shading, hedges, windbreaks, and improvement of soil fertility. The seed dormancy is common in Leucaena and Acacia species, and it creates difficulties in seed testing and planting. The aim of this study is to determine the effective methods of sulfuric acid and hot water due to overcoming dormancy in seeds of those species. Most pretreatments significantly (p < 0.05) reduced hard seed content and enhanced germination percentage when compared to nontreated seeds. Effectiveness of water and acid pretreatments increased when increasing in duration time from 3 to 60 min. The best recommended time pretreatment of sulfuric acid 60 min for A. nilotica, and 3 min of hot water for Leucaena. These treatments all reduced hard seeds to 0% and did not cause damage to the seeds during the germination. Further, the lens and hilum both were identified as primary sites for water uptake into the seeds of Leucaena. Whereas, the lens was recognized as the original site of water intake in A. nilotica. In addition, the seed coat anatomy identified that the palisade epidermal layer was dense, and thickness tissue had been prevented imbibition of water in Leucaena and A. nilotica. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The ruderal babassu palm (Attalea speciosa) is expanding on large areas of degraded Amazon landscapes. Decomposition of leaves and roots is in the center of plant:soil interactions. We evaluated decomposition and nutrient concentrations of leaves and fine roots of babassu in comparison with two exotic reference species, Acacia mangium (slow degradability) and Leucaena leucocephala (fast degradability), in a 138-day litterbag assay carried out in secondary forest stands of different age and babassu abundance. We chose 4-mm over 2-mm mesh litterbags based on a pilot study. Babassu leaves degraded slower than leaves of A. mangium and L. leucocephala, and also had lower nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium concentrations in all stages of decomposition. By contrast, potassium concentrations in babassu leaves were higher than in both reference species at 0 and 50 days. Roots of all three species decomposed slower than leaves. Compared to the leaves, both biomass loss and nutrient concentrations differed less between babassu and reference-species roots, except for lower nitrogen concentration in babassu roots. Leaf-litter decomposition of all three species was significantly faster in old than in young secondary forest, suggesting an acceleration of decomposition along succession. Babassu leaves decomposed faster in old babassu-dominated than non-dominated secondary forest, pointing to the existence of specialized decomposer communities in babassu-dominated stands. © 2020, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia.

AB  - On dairy farms in Western Burkina Faso, milk production is limited by a fodder shortage in the dry season. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and potential of shrub fodder banks (SFB) to supplement the dry-season feed of dairy cows with fodder of good nutritional value. A work on the codesign, establishment and harvesting of SFB planted with Leucaena leucocephala and Morus alba was carried out in three dairy cattle farms in Western Burkina Faso. The three SFB were planted at high density, with 20,000 plants.ha-1, in July 2016. Growth was rapid during the first seven months (rainy season and early dry season). At planting day (pd) plus seven months, L. leucocephala measured 145 ± 11 cm and M. alba 143 ± 72 cm. Then, during the dry season growth slowed down. Soil characteristics, lack of rainfall and shallow planting beds explained the differences in growth observed between experimental sites. Termite attacks (SFB3) and fire (SFB1) affected the development of the SFB concerned without destroying them. The cumulative biomass production on SFB2 and SFB3 over the three harvest cuttings (pd+13, pd+15, and pd+17-18 months) was higher with L. leucocephala (8.2 ± 2.6 t dry matter. ha-1) than with M. alba (1.8 ± 2.3 t dry matter.ha-1). Establishing and operating 625 square meters of SFB cost 896,188 FCFA (about 1350 €). Solutions need to be found to make them financially more accessible to farmers. © 2020, CIRAD.

AB  - In this research, field surveys of species composition and vegetation community structure of 22 gullies in the hot-dry valley region of Yuanmou County in Yunnan Province were carried out using standard vegetation sampling methods to study the plant community structure in gullies with different activity levels. As the gully stability increased, the number of plant species also increased. Twenty-eight species of plants belonging to 28 genera of 12 families, were found in active gullies. Twenty-nine species of plants belonging to 29 genera of 16 families, were found in semi-stable gullies. Thirty-seven species of plants belonging to 35 genera of 15 families were discovered in stable gullies. Based on plant form, the gully vegetation communities could be divided into three layers (herb layer, shrub layer and tree layer) which varied with the activity level of the gullies. No tree layer was found in the active gullies. The dominant species in the herb layer was Heteropogon contortus, with Bothriochloa pertusa and Aristida adscensionis as sub-dominant species. The dominant species in the shrub layer was Dodonaea viscosa, with Leucaena leucocephala as the sub-dominant species. The dominant species of the tree layer was Azadirachta Indica, with Eucalyptus robusta as the sub-dominant species. As the gully stability increased, so also did the coverage of its vegetation community. The plant communities in gullies with differing activity levels were all dominated by perennial herbs and shrubs, with a smaller number of tree species of trees, in which the dominant species were the same and played similar roles in the plant communities. However, with increasing stability of gullies, the number and diversity of trees gradually increased. For active gullies, semi-stable gullies and stable gullies, the plant community similarities were comparatively similar in the herb layer, extremely similar in the shrub layer, and extremely different in the tree layer. As the stability of a gully changed, the tendency for the plant community matured without species change in the shrub layer was evident. However, for the herb layer and tree layer, as the gully stability increased with time the species composition of the vegetation community evolved. These results indicate that the activity status of a gully plays an important role in determining the community structure of the tree layers, while the community structure of the shrub layer was less affected by the activity status of the gully. In summary, an obvious difference in vegetation structure was evident between gullies with different activity status, and this information could provide a scientific basis for gully ecological restoration decisions and for formulation of future studies. © 2020, Editorial Office of Acta Prataculturae Sinica.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the nutritive value of leaves of six tree forage species [Acacia albida (Del.), Acacia nilotica (L.) Del., Balanites aegyptiaca (L.) Del., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Moringa stenopetala (Baker f.) Cufodontis and Morus alba (L.)] sampled from southwestern part of Ethiopian rift valley. The leaf samples were analyzed for chemical composition using official methods, and in vitro gas test was conducted to estimate their metabolizable energy content, organic matter digestibility (OMD), short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and gas production characteristics. Crude protein was highest in L. leucocephala (213.09 g kg−1 DM) and M. stenopetala (209.80 g kg−1 DM) and the lowest was in M. alba (101.63 g kg−1 DM). The fiber (NDF, ADF and ADL) fractions were highest in B. aegyptiaca and lowest in M. stenopetala. Condensed tannin concentration ranged from 10.76 g kg−1 DM in B. aegyptiaca to 81.89 g kg−1 DM in A. nilotica. The OMD, cumulative gas volume, SCFA and NH3-N production were highest (p < 0.05) in M. stenopetala and M. alba followed by the values measured for L. leucocephala, B. aegyptiaca and A. albida and lowest was for A. nilotica. Highest methane (CH4) production per gram of dry matter was noted for M. stenopetala and the lowest for A. nilotica though opposite situation was observed when CH4 production was expressed as a ratio to total gas produced. Overall, most of the studied browse plants are desirable candidate species for mitigation of enteric methane emission while supplying optimum level of nitrogen if used as a supplement to low-quality forages. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This paper reports on the vegetation composition and diversity of herb, shrub and tree layers developing on an age series of overburden dumps (1, 3, 9, 12, 18 and 21yr) in Bansra and Sonepur Bazari colliery of Raniganj Coalfields. An adjacent native forest Garhjungle was also studied to compare the vegetation development. Total 69, 20, and 30 species of herbs, shrubs including climbers, and trees, respectively, were recorded from the overburden dumps, whereas 10 species of trees, 7 of shrubs and 20 herbaceous species were recorded from the natural forest Garhjungle. Four indices of species diversity estimated the richness, heterogeneity, evenness and dominance of species. Herbs appeared from 1yr dump while shrubs and trees appeared from 3yr onwards. Herb layer was most diverse in the early successional stage while shrub layer was most diverse in the intermediate stage. Density of herbs and shrubs decreased, whereas density, basal area and diversity of tree increased with increase in dump age. Herb layer was dominated by invasive species in the initial phase of succession and gradually replaced by higher successional herbs. Shrub layer was dominated by invasive species throughout the succession. Importance of , only invasive tree species recorded, increased in the late successional stage.

AB  - Understanding belowground morphological mechanisms of trees and grasses is a complicated task but can help in the design and management of silvopastoral systems. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the harvest intervals (i.e. 30 and 50 days) of aboveground biomass on the fine root density and vertical distribution in two silvopastoral systems (SPS): one comprising Leucaena leucocephala (legume tree) and Cynodon plectostachyus (grass) and the other L. leucocephala and Panicum maximum. We used a completely randomized design with four repetitions. We sampled fine roots by using a metal cylinder (8 cm diameter and 50 cm length) 7 days after each harvest. We washed the samples with pressurized water to separate them from the soil. The roots were digitalized at a resolution of 600 dpi to determine the diameter and specific root length by using IJ Rhizo® software. Samples were subsequently dried to quantify fine root mass. We found that the greater percentages of fine roots were between 0.4 and 0.8 mm for the legume and between 0.2 and 0.4 mm for grasses. The fine root length and mass density of P. maximum was higher (P < 0.001) compared to C. plectostachyus in both harvest intervals. However, the fine root density of L. leucocephala did not vary between SPS (P > 0.05). The effect of harvest interval was significant only in some soil layers in both SPS (P > 0.05). Most of the pasture roots were found in the upper soil layer (0–20 cm), while L. leucocephala roots were present to deeper soil layers. We conclude that P. maximum has a greater rooting capacity and a more rapid recovery than C. plectostachyus, which has greater diameters and lower root density. However, L. leucocephala presented deeper and thicker fine roots in both SPS, which is a good indication of its belowground recovery capacity to aboveground disturbances. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Phytoextraction of heavy metals by trees is less hazardous for human beings and animals than their extraction by agricultural crops from the contaminated sites. Therefore, phytoextraction potential of four tree species namely Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. (eucalyptus), Leucaena leucocephala Lam. de Wit (subabul), Melia azedarach L. (dhrek), and Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. (shisham) to tolerate and extract lead (Pb) from soil at its six applied rates (0, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 mg Pb kg −1 soil) was assessed after 18 months of their growth in a pot experiment. Dry matter (DM) yield of different tree components (stem, leaves, and roots), their Pb concentration, Pb uptake and available Pb in the soil before planting and after harvesting the plants were determined. Contamination indices namely transfer coefficient (TC) or bioaccumulation factor for shoots (BAFshoot), bioaccumulation factor for roots (BAFroot), translocation factor (TF), tolerance index (TI), and the remediation factor (RF) were also determined. The increasing Pb levels led to a significant decrease in total DM yield and in eucalyptus, subabul, dhrek, and shisham, it decreased by 38.9, 34.6, 23.3, and 23.5% at the highest level of applied Pb as compared to control (P ≤ 0.05). The Pb concentration in different plant parts increased significantly with increasing levels of added Pb (P ≤ 0.05). Subabul had significantly highest (0.25 − 100.9 mg pot −1) removal of Pb at different applied Pb levels and therefore, subabul pots had the lowest amount of available soil Pb after harvesting of plants. Dhrek was observed to have highest (56.4 mg kg −1 soil) upper critical level of available soil Pb whereas subabul had the greatest Pb extraction capacity from the soil. Contamination indices TF (1.35) and TI (0.88) were highest for dhrek but TC or BAFshoot (3.23), BAFroot (2.66), and RF (7.65%) were highest for subabul. Therefore, subabul can be used for phytoremediation of Pb-contaminated sites due to its more biomass and higher extraction of Pb from soil than the other tree species. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study aimed to quantify the dynamics of soil CO2 fluxes in two silvopastoral systems based on Leucaena leucocephala, one associated with Panicum maximum (L + P) and another with Cynodon plectostachyus (L + C). We measured CO2 fluxes fortnightly during the dry and rainy seasons in the morning and the afternoon, with an infrared gas analyzer. Simultaneously, we measured soil temperature, soil moisture, ambient temperature, and relative humidity. Soil CO2 fluxes ranged from 6.0 ± 0.14 to 6.1 ± 0.12 µmol CO2/m2/s but no statistical differences were observed between systems. Soil CO2 flux in the L + P was 12.5% higher in the rainy season compared with the dry season but the season did not affect the fluxes in L + C. Regarding the diurnal variation, CO2 fluxes were 17.6%–34.8% higher in the morning compared with afternoon measurements. Soil moisture and temperature were higher in L + C, but the ambient temperature and relative humidity showed no statistical differences between systems. In both systems, soil temperature was greater in the afternoon, while the soil moisture and relative humidity were greater in the morning. The diurnal variation of soil CO2 fluxes in silvopastoral systems correlated positively with soil temperature and ambient temperature, but negatively with relative humidity. We concluded that soil CO2 fluxes did not vary between silvopastoral systems but respond differently to the seasons. The results have important implications on the establishment and management of Leucaena-based silvopastoral systems for the mitigation of soil CO2 fluxes from extensive livestock production lands. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - Methane produced by enteric fermentation contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere. Methane is one of the GHG resulting from anthropogenic activities with the greater global warming contribution. Ruminant production systems contribute between 18% and 33% of methane emissions. Due to this, there has been growing interest in finding feed alternatives which may help to mitigate methane production in the rumen. The presence of a vast range of secondary metabolites in tropical trees (coumarins, phenols, tannins, and saponins, among others) may be a valuable alternative to manipulate rumen fermentation and partially defaunate the rumen, and thus reduce enteric methane production. Recent reports suggest that it is possible to decrease methane emissions in sheep by up to 27% by feeding them saponins from the tea leaves of Camellia sinensis; partial defaunation (54%) of the rumen has been achieved using saponins from Sapindus saponaria. The aim of this review was to collect, analyze, and interpret scientific information on the potential of tropical trees and their secondary metabolites to mitigate methane emissions from ruminants. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Problem on national energy becomes important in relation to National Determined Contribution (NDC) particularly emission target from energy sector. One of renewable energies is wood based biomass energy (WBBE). The objectives of the research are: (i) to review policies on WBBE development, and (ii) to provide share estimation of WBBE in national energy supply. Method used is content of analysis for reviewing regulations on energy field and supply and demand for estimating share of WBBE. Research shows that WBBE is an alternative energy as substitution for now renewable energies such as oil and gases and coal. However, this still requires, such as, presidential instruction related to WBBE provision and utilization. Potential tree species for WBBE are Kaliandra (Calliandra callothyrsus), Akasia (Acacia auriculiformis), Gamal (Gliricidia sepium), dan Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala). In national energy mix, WWBE is allocated with other energies for 2%. This share can be increased more than 2% if it is supported by various policies at national and field levels, and provision of forest and land by Ministry of Environment and Forestry and National Land Agency. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Impact of fly ash (FA) on germination and initial seedling growth performance of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit was studied during 2016-2017. Substrate was prepared by admixing FA to forest soil (S) at five concentrations viz.20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% (w/w). The experimental design was CRD with six treatment and three replications. Eighteen hundred freshly collected seeds were treated with hot water and sown at 0.5-1.0 cm depth in germination trays containing substrates of different treatments. Significant (P<0.05) variation in germination (G.) period, G. rate, G. capacity and G. Index with respect to FA concentration in growing media was observed (n=100).G. period was reduced by 5.67 days in 20% fly ash admixed growing media (FAAGM) over control (S). Maximum G. rate (88.67%), G. value (18.47) and G. index (1.58) were found in 20% FAAG Mafter 30 days of sowing. Observations pertaining to growth dynamics were recorded at 90 days after transplanting (DAT). Significant difference (P>0.05) in seedling survival rate, plant height, diameter growth, nodules per plant and seedling quality index were observed. The survival rate (91.83%) and root nodule number was (7.20) was maximum at 20% FAAGM. But plant height (51.68 cm), diameter growth (3.96 cm) and seedling quality index (0.706) were attained maximum at 40% FAAGM. It is concluded form the present investigation that FA can be admixed @ 20% (w/w)in forest nurseries for improving germination and @40% (w/w) for promoting seedling growth and quality improvement. © 2020 Ecological Society of India.

AB  - The woody flora of the university city “Antonio Borjas Romero” of the University of Zulia was determined. Twelve fortnightly samples (November 2015-April 2016) were performed, botanical samples were collected and taxonomically identified. Eighty-two species were determined, 37 families, highlighting those with the highest number of species: Caesalpiniaceae (9) and Mimosaceae (9). Secondary communities were found: relics of xerophytic species (Caesalpinia coriaria, Prosopis juliflora and Vachellia tortuosa), monospecific areas planted with Peltophorum pterocarpum, secondary savannas with invasive species (Azadirachta indica and Calotropis procera), formations with deciduous elements (Caesalpinia granadillo and Pithecellobium dulce) and species adjacent to packed ravines (Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Leucaena leucocephala and Ricinus communis). Also highlighted ornamental species planted in the green areas of the buildings. The woody flora of the university city did not differ substantially from the previous registry, however the wide spread of the invasive A. indica on the university campus of the University of Zulia is of concern. © 2020, Universidad del Zulia.

AB  - In addition to soybean, Leucaena leucocephala is one of the tempe raw materials usually used in Indonesia. These tempe is only made by peoples in a few areas in the southern part of Java such as Wonogiri, Gunungkidul and Pacitan. For some purposes, such as cooking ingredients, tempe is deliberately fermented longer than usual to obtain a savory taste. In a previous study, we had studied leucaena tempe or people known as lamtoro tempe that process in Wonogiri and reported that there had been a change in characteristic during fermentation until over-fermented tempe. Therefore, in this research, we analyzed the change in the chemical and microbiological characteristic of lamtoro tempe from Pacitan during continued fermentation. This research showed that during the fermentation process, mold, yeast, and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) persisted for up to 126 hrs of fermentation time. The growth of yeast and mold tend to decrease while LAB continued to increase until it reached 11 log CFU/mL. In addition, the moisture content, ash content, soluble protein levels, pH and titrated acid increased during continued fermentation time. Glutamic acid and aspartic acid were the highest amino acids by weight percentage. Both amino acids have an important role in the sensory characteristics of lamtoro tempe. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The aim of this work was to compare the carbon (C) mineralization kinetics of three biochars (Formosan ash (Fraxinus formosana Hayata), ash biochar; Makino bamboo (Phyllostachys makino Hayata), bamboo biochar; and lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de. Wit), lead tree biochar) applied with two addition rates (2 and 5 wt %) in three excessive compost-fertilized (5 wt %) soils (one Oxisols and two Inceptisols), and to ascertain the increasing or decreasing effect of biochar and soil type in the presence of excessive compost. The study results of 400 days incubation indicated that, in general, the potential of the three biochars for C sequestration is similar in the three studied soils. The presence of excessive compost stimulated the co-mineralization of the more labile components of biochar over the short term (first two months). The potential of biochar addition for neutralizing soil pH and regulating the release of Al from soil for preserving soil organic carbon (SOC) might be the important mechanisms in biochar-compost interactions, especially in the presence of excessive compost. Overall, 5% application rate of three high temperature-pyrolysis biochars showed the less detriments to studied soils. In these incubations of biochar, excessive compost, and soil, it is a decreasing effect overall, that is, the enhanced storage of both biochar-C and SOC, which is expected as a long-term carbon sequestration in soil. The recorded direction and magnitude of effect, both are strongly influenced by biochar and soil type. When co-applied with excessive compost, the negative (reducing CO2 release) effect with increasing biochar application rates was eliminated. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - With the objective of evaluate the behavior of the seeds of four trees; Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena), Gliricidia sepium (Gliricidia), Moringa oleifera (Moringa) and Coulteria platyloba (Coral) as treatments with three repetitions of 1,000 seeds, through the process of endozoocoria in cattle of the Brahman breed, as a future strategy for restoration of pastures in silvopastoral arrangements. Due to the poor recovery of Gliricidia and practically zero of Moringa in the feces, it was decided to only study the emergence of Leucaena and Coral in nursery conditions, by means of a design of repeated measures over time and six treatments: LEE and CE (Leucaena and Coral scarified by endozoochory), LEAC and CEAC (Leucaena and Coral scarified with hot water; LC and CC (Leucaena and Coral without scarifying as control). The height of the plant and the number of leaves plant -1 were also measured. Differences were observed in all treatments and treatments. Higher percentages of seeds expelled in feces were seen in Leucaena and Coral with 89% and 69%, respectively, however, the lowest percentages of excretion were found in Gliricidia with 7.8% and Moringa with 0.3%. Germination of Leucaena and Coral undergoing different scarification processes, indicated that the Leucaena seeds scarified with hot water showed 55.67%, without differing from the Coral with the same treatment and control, not were differences observed between the scarified seeds through endozoochory process and those that did not undergo scarification Leucaena and Coral presented the highest percentages of seeds expelled through endozoochoruos dispersal, while this route of dispersion is not possible in Gliricidia and Moringa. Leucaena and Coral seeds were not affected with endozoochory, which favors their use in the restoration of degraded pastures through silvopastoral systems or other functionality. © 2020 Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - With this contribution, an updated picture of the rapid expansion of Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata in Sicily is provided. On the one hand, this is a quite worrying sign, as this woody species figures among the world’s worst invasive alien species. On the other hand, the species shows interesting potential for production purposes (for wood, biomass and for feeding livestock), also considering its nitrogen fixation ability. Consequently, the two opposite options to cope with this species, i.e. cultivation and control/eradication, should accurately take into account the possible uses as well as its invasive behaviour. on © the Author(s), 2020.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is one of the 22 Leucaena species that originated in Central America. There are two major subspecies of leucaena, L. leucocephala subsp. glabrata (giant leucaena) and L. leucocephala subsp. leucocephala (common leucaena). Giant leucaena is a medium size fast-growing tree important for agroforestry while common leucaena is a small bushy shrub that is considered to be an invasive weed. Giant leucaena can be grown as a woody tree of up to ~ 20 m in height or maintained as a bushy fodder legume by repeated harvest of its foliage several times a year. Giant leucaena grown for fodder can produce forage dry mater yield of up to 34 Mg ha−1 year−1. High forage yield together with high protein content makes leucaena an ideal fodder legume for the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Although mimosine present in the leucaena foliage has toxicity, it should not be a big concern because ruminants can be successfully inoculated with the mimosine-metabolizing rumen bacterium Synergistis jonesii. Alternatively, mimosine present in the leucaena foliage can be removed easily and inexpensively through simple processing. Giant leucaena cultivars are generally free from diseases and are highly tolerant to drought. Although infestation by psyllids may be a problem, a number of psyllid-resistant cultivars of giant leucaena have been developed through interspecies hybridization. The wood of giant leucaena can be used for timber, paper pulp, or biofuel production. Leucaena foliage and wood may serve as raw materials for development of new industry for production of phytochemicals such as mimosine, tannins and anthocyanins, wood products, and high-protein animal feed for farm animals in the future. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Seed abundance affects seed removal of an alien and a native tree in the Brazilian savanna: Implications for biotic resistance
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086317733&doi=10.1111%2faec.12922&partnerID=40&md5=ab3b78489408e02b763a98160fbc1773
AB  - Invasive species are among the major threats to global biodiversity. Plant invasions are often driven by great propagule pressure that overcomes barriers to early colonisation and establishment, such as the biotic resistance from pathogens and seed predators. However, the way in which biotic resistance interacts with propagule pressure and affects seed survival remains poorly understood. Here, we experimentally assessed the effect of seed abundance on seed removal in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna). We tested whether the invasive Leucaena leucocephala and the native Anadenanthera macrocarpa (both Fabaceae) differ in post-dispersal seed removal – an indicator of granivore pressure – by different guilds of seed predators, varying seed abundance (2, 5 or 10 seeds of each species per treatment) and distance from a disturbance (5, 20 and 50 m from a firebreak) in two fragments of Cerrado. Treatment encounter, that is the chance of at least one seed being removed, increased 72% from 2 to 10 seeds per treatment, but seed removal increased only by 32%, suggesting a threshold in granivore response to seed availability. Native seeds suffered higher removal than exotic seeds, but removal rates did not vary with distance to disturbance or interact with vertebrate and invertebrate exclusions. Our results suggest a patchy pattern of seed predation influenced by resource abundance and emphasise the efficiency of high propagule pressure in overcoming the density-dependent biotic resistance during early stages of exotic plant invasions in Cerrado. Seeds of fast-germinating species, such as L. leucocephala, that reach appropriate spots for regeneration may still overcome the biotic resistance due to the patchy nature of seed predation.

AB  - The effects of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) of dielectric barrier discharges on the wettability, imbibition and germination of Leucaena leucocephala were investigated. It was established that CAP treatment markedly hydrophilized the seed coat, especially at longer treatment times. From the profile of the imbibition curve and visual observation, it was possible to verify that there are two resistance barriers to water penetration: integument surface and region of the macrosclereid cell wall (light line). Although the plasma interacts only in the integument, increasing the density of hydrophilic sites increases the capacity of water absorption, producing enough driving force to overcome the second resistance barrier. The existence of these two barriers changes the three-phase pattern generally observed during seed germination. Despite an increase in imbibition, the plasma treatment conditions used in this work, were not enough to overcome completely the dormancy barrier.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala has become one legume most commonly used in ruminant feeding practices and which contains CT with potential to reduce CH4 emissions, improve feed protein utilization. This study was aimed to determine the effect of L. leucocephala leaves as a tannin source on rumen amylase, CMC-ase, β-glucosidase, protease activity and kinetic of gas production. The study began with tannin protein-binding capacity evaluation. The levels of L. leucocephala leaves which used were 0%, 10%, and 25%. Feed fermentation was conducted using Menke and Steingass gas production technique for 48 hours. Kinetic of gas production was analyzed using the Fit Curve programme. Data obtained were analyzed using one way ANOVA, and continued by DMRT. The results of this study showed that the tannin protein-binding capacity was 1.2680 mg BSA/mg DM of L. leucocephala leaves. Amilase, CMC-ase, β-glucosidase, and protease activity decreased significantly (P<0.01) at 10% and 25% L. leucocephala. Gas production from soluble fractions (a) was not affected by the treatment. Gas production from the potentially degraded fraction (b) decreased significantly (P<0.05) at 10% and 25% L. leucocephala . The potential extent of gas production (a+b) decreased significantly (P<0.05) at 25% L. leucocephala. The gas production rate (c) increased significantly (P<0.05) at 25% L. leucocephala. Inclusion up to 25% of L. leucocephala leaves in the diet reduce rumen hydrolytic enzymes activity, the soluble and the potentially degraded fraction (a+b) and gas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate milk production, N2-fixation and N transfer, forage yield and composition (under two cutting intervals) in a silvopastoral system (SPS) with Leucaena leucocephala-Megathyrsus maximus and M. maximus-monoculture (MMM) with crossbred cows in a completely randomized design. Forage yield in the SPS was 6490 and 6907 kg DM ha−1 for cutting intervals (CI) of 35 and 50 days. Forage yield for the MMM was 7284 and 10,843 kg DM ha−1, and forage crude protein (CP) was 29.0% and 26.1% for L. leucocephala, harvested at 35 and 50 days, respectively. CP for the associated M. maximus was 9.9% and 7.8% for CI 35 and 50 days, respectively, and for MMM was 7.4% and 8.4%, harvested at 35 and 50 days. Milk production was 4.7 kg cow−1 day−1 for cows grazing MMM and 7.4 kg cow−1 day−1 under SPS. Nitrogen fixation in L. leucocephala (%Ndfa) was estimated to be 89% and 95%, at 35 and 50 days, with an N2 transfer to the associated grass of 34.3% and 52.9%. SPS has the potential to fix and transfer important amounts of N2 to the associated grass, and increase forage CP content and milk production. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - At the risk of the presence of Heteropsylla cubana Crawford could limit the use of leucaena. The present work was conducted in different Leucaena leucocephala agroecosystems, in their initial stages after the intercropping of seasonal crops, with different years of establishment and presence or not of other trees in the system. The objective was to evaluate the abundance of H. cubana population in L. leucocephala agroecosystems and understand its enemies naturals associated to leucaena pyllid. Periodic random samplings of the associated arthropods were carried out. The collected species were identified taxonomically and classified according to their feeding habit. Bivariate correlation and principal components analysis were applied. The results showed that H. cubana is the phytophagou main in L. leucocephala sowings. A complex of natural enemies grouped in 4 classes, 8 orders, 12 families, and 21 genera was detected. H. cubana population density was higher in less diverse sowings. Criteria are provided to keep the populations under non-harmful levels. It is concluded that despite the abundance shown by H. cubana, in the dry season, in areas of L. leucocephala , favored by the climatic conditions in the period. There is a permanence of natural enemies of the leucaena psyllid, under Cuban conditions, given by predators, parasitoids and entomopathogens that favor their control. It is recommended to favor or increase the presence of these natural enemies in the agroecosystem to prevent economic damage to the legume and to continue promoting the use of the tree as animal feed. © 2020 Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - Quezon Protected Landscape (QPL) is a tropical rainforest situated at the southern Sierra Madre mountain range. However, it is subjected to anthropogenic pressure that poses threats to its flora and fauna. This study was conducted to describe the plant diversity, assess their ecological and conservation status, and to identify current anthropogenic threats in various vegetation types in QPL. Vegetation assessment was done using quadrat method established at different land use types wherein ninety 10x10 m nested plots were used for trees, 5x5 m subplots were used for herbs and shrubs, and 1x1 m subplots were used for grasses. The study documented a total of 328 species belonging to 84 families and 208 genera with 2,737 individuals. Species diversity is high as revealed by the values obtained from species diversity (H') and species evenness (J') indexes. Out of 172 tree species identified, the most important species are: Parashorea malaanonan (Blanco) Merr. in the regenerating and lowland evergreen dipterocarp forest; Diospyros pyrrhocarpa Miq. in the karst forest; Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in the secondary forest; and Cocos nucifera L. in the agroforest. Assessment of ecological status showed that out of 328 species, 213 (64.94%) are native, wherein 65 (19.8%) are endemic, and 115 (35.06%) are introduced. Forty-five species (13.72%) are threatened in which 25 of those are endemic in the Philippines. Overall, QPL has a wide array of plant species and threats such as the illegal extraction of natural resources, encroachment, cleanliness and presence of invasive alien species. So, it is recommended that protection and awareness campaign should be done for conservation and sustainability. © 2020 Association of Systematic Biologists of the Philippines. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Influence of energy supplementation on dietary nitrogen utilization and milk production in cows fed foliage of Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2020

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the effect of four energy supplements (two highly fermentable; two starch-based carbohydrates) on blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary urea excretion, and milk yield, in dual-purpose cows fed foliage of Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena). Five Holstein-Zebu cows with 450 kg body weight in their second third of lactation were used in a 5 × 5 Latin square design. Cows were fed (dry basis) a mixture of 45% Leucaena and 55% Pennisetum purpureum grass. Treatments were supplementation with (i) sugarcane molasses (Mo), (ii) sorghum grain (So), (iii) fresh citrus pulp (CitP) or (iv) rice polishing (RP), all of them incorporated into the diet at 25 MJ of ME/cow/day. There was a control group (Cont) without energy supplementation. The study comprised five periods of 20 days (15 days adaptation, 5 days measurements). Dry matter intake (kg/day) was lower (P < 0.05) for Cont (9.4) compared with Mo (12.1), So (12.0), CitP (11.9) and RP (11.9) but no difference was observed among energy supplements (P > 0.05). Milk yield (kg/day) was higher (P < 0.05) in cows supplemented with starch supplements (4.7 for So; 4.9 for RP) compared with Cont (3.3). Milk yield from highly fermentable supplements (Mo and CitP) did not differ (P > 0.05) from Cont or other treatments. Milk protein, fat and lactose were not different among treatments (P > 0.05). Blood urea nitrogen and urinary urea excretion were both reduced (P < 0.05) by energy supplementation. Urinary urea excretion was not different (P > 0.05) among cows fed different sources of energy. It is concluded that in dual-purpose cows fed Leucaena foliage, supplementation with sugarcane molasses, citrus pulp or rice polishing reduced blood urea nitrogen and urinary urea excretion. Milk yield was increased by sorghum and rice polishing whereas energy supplementation did not affect milk composition. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorus Mineralization as Influenced by Type of Organic Residues and Soil Contact Variation in Vertisol of Central India

AB  - Soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) play a critical role in plant nutrient dynamics and crop yield performance under different soils. In this study, the amount of carbon (C), N and phosphorus (P) mineralization as influenced by type of organic residue and soil contact variation was studied for an incubation period of 75 days under controlled laboratory conditions. Different types of residues, viz. subabul residue (Leucaena leucocephala) (T1), biochar of subabul residue (T2) and FYM (T3), along with unamended soil with no residue constituted the three modes of application, viz. buried (t1), incorporated (t2) and surface applied (t3) treatments. Among all the treatments, subabul residue applied treatments showed highest rate of C mineralization in which surface applied (SA) treatments varied from 19.54 at 24 h to 239.55 mg CO2–C/100 g soil at 75 days followed by subabul incorporated (I) (17.04–237.8 mg CO2–C/100 g soil) and subabul buried (B) (15.91–225.5 mg CO2–C/100 g soil) treatments. Subabul incorporated (I) treatment showed lowest rate of mineralization of NO3–N, which varies from 0.010 and 0.613 mg kg−1 at 7 days to 4.640 and 10.03 mg kg−1 at 75 days after incubation followed by subabul buried (B) and SA treatments. These results will be useful in the selection of agriculture crop inputs and their proper placement in soils with respect to nutrient mineralization. © 2019, NAAS (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences).

AB  - Silvopastoral systems have proved to be important for the environmental and economic sustainability of the producers who carry them out. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the financial and economic profitability of the intensive silvopastoral system Leucaena leucocephala in association with cross-bred Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) under irrigation in the production of beef calves in Southern Sinaloa, in order to contribute information to productive, economic and environmental sustainability in tropical regions. By following up on the technical and economic information regarding a 20-ha production unit in southern Sinaloa for 3 years, a financial and economic evaluation was carried out considering the payment for the carbon sequestration environmental service provided by the intensive silvopastoral system (ISS). The financial analysis methodology was used, in which the three main indicators used in the evaluation of projects were estimated: Net Current Value (NCV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Cost Benefit Ratio (CBR). In a time frame of 10 years of planning, the ISS is profitable, as it exhibits a NCV of 7 605 792.14 MXN, an IRR of 27.9 % and a CBR of 1.21 in the financial evaluation, and of 1.24 in the economic evaluation. The results of the present research show that calves can be developed in an ISS in a profitable and sustainable way, which is why greater institutional support is required to spread, promote and support these silvopastoral systems in tropical regions. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The potential impact of the soil seed bank of a given species and subsequent population persistence will depend on the robustness of the seeds against depletion. Invasiveness is frequently linked to this behavior and successful control of invasive species depends on reducing the size of their seed banks. We propose a hybrid model that simulates the seed bank dynamics in association with their physical dormancy (PD) based on experimental data on seed bank depletion of a Leucaena leucocephala population during the dispersal phase. The hybrid model uses cellular automata (CA) and Monte Carlo techniques. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the model delivers reproducible and reliable results. Then, we discuss the ability of the hybrid model to predict the effect of seasonal climate change. A 2.0 °C increase in temperature was enough to cause a considerable impact in the seed depletion curve, and after 1 year, ~ 75% of the seeds had already disappeared from the seed bank. The proposed hybrid CA model can be used to study soil-stored seed banks with physical dormancy, and could be applied to other Fabaceae species with similar seed traits. We believe that this computational model contributes to a better understanding of seed bank dynamics and will aid in the control of invasive species and for testing different scenarios to reduce or eliminate seed banks that have already been formed. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The main task was to evaluate the effect of tree foliage species supplemented in cattle balanced diets on the in vitro fermentation and digestibility, synthesis of microbial biomass and methane (CH4) production. The experimental diets were isoenergetic and isoproteic balanced and formulated to meet the requirements of growing cattle (250 kg BW). Seven treatments were tested: control treatment (CT1) with the grass Pennisetum purpureum and six additional treatments substituting P. purpureum (30% of DM) with foliage of Neomillspaughia emarginata (NE2), Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia (TA3), Caesalpinia gaumeri (CG4), Piscidia piscipula (PP5), Leucaena leucocephala (LL6) and Havardia albicans (HA7). A randomised complete block design with blocks repeated over time was implemented. The highest gas production (P < 0.05) was found in CT1 and TA3 (244.10 and 235.13 mL g−1, respectively). The highest in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) (P < 0.05) were in CT1, TA3 and LL6 (IVDMD = 56.33%, 56.85% and 56.08%; IVOMD = 62.41%, 66.86% and 64.38%, respectively). Synthesis of microbial biomass and volatile fatty acid concentration was similar among tree foliage supplementation and CT1, and the lowest CH4 production (P < 0.05) was found in LL6 (35.94 L kg−1 of digested dry matter). It is concluded that the supplementation with T. amygdalifolia, P. piscipula and L. leucocephala at 30% in balanced diets could be used without affect negatively the organic matter digestibility of the diets, the synthesis of microbial biomass and the volatile fatty acid concentration. Additionally, the supplementation with L. leucocephala reduces CH4 production in the rumen by 12.78%. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Gas production, methane and energy loss from 10 dry and 12 green fodders were evaluated in vitro using sheep and goat inocula. Dry matter intake and digestible DM (DDM) were higher for green (2.45% and 62.28%) than dry fodders (1.72% and 52.88%), respectively. Mean in vitro dry matter digestibility was higher for green than dry fodders in rumen inocula of sheep (63.51 vs 45.34%) and goat (61.36 vs 41.36%), respectively. After 12 h, gas production was higher for green than dry fodders in sheep (69.70 mL/g vs 64.40) and goat inocula (61.73 vs 55.53 mL/g). Gas production was higher for dry and green fodders in sheep inoculums vs goat at 12, 24 and 48 h. At 12 h, methane production was higher for green than dry fodders both in sheep (12.96 vs 9.69 mL/g) and goat (13.34 vs 9.14 mL/g). Total CH4 production was higher for green than dry fodders with both sheep (40.92 vs 33.83 mL/g) and goat inocula (33.34 vs 30.47 mL/g), respectively. Methane production was higher from fermentation of green fodders than dry fodders in rumen inocula from goat (19.27 vs 14.16) and sheep (18.57 vs 14.76 g/kg DM), respectively. Green fodders produced higher CH4 with goat (33.75 g/kg DDM) vs sheep inocula (29.65 g/kg DDM). Methane production (g/kg DDM) and energy loss as methane (CH4 % GE) was similar for dry and green fodders fermented in sheep and goat inocula. Overall, results showed that green forages produced more CH4 compared with dry forages so this piece of information should be put into consideration for sustainable and environmentally friendly production system. © 2020 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

AB  - Research Highlights: Established stands of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Spathodea campanulata P. Beauv., and Vitex parviflora Juss. modified soils in Guam's limestone forests, reducing storage pools of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Background and Objectives: Invasive plants may engineer negative changes in ecosystem properties. This study was conducted to determine changes in soil chemistry following infestations of three problematic tree species on Guam. Materials and Methods: Minerals, metals, and mineralization dynamics were measured in invaded sites and paired sites with biodiverse native tree cover. Results: Most soil properties were significantly changed by long-term infestations of the invasive tree species. The soils within invaded sites exhibited total carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus that were less than native sites. In contrast, the carbon/nitrogen ratio increased for every species-site combination. The other chemical properties were idiosyncratic among the sites and species. Conclusions: Mitigation and restoration activities that include the removal of these trees from project sites may require many years for the below-ground ecosystems to return to their native state. These three invasive trees decrease the ability of Guam soils to sequester recalcitrant forms of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. © 2020 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Tannin-rich plants as natural manipulators of rumen fermentation in the livestock industry
PY  - 2020

AB  - Condensed tannins (CTs) are plant anti-herbivore compounds with antimicrobial activity that can be used in ruminant diets as ruminal microbiome manipulators. However, not all CTs from fodder legumes are bioactive due to their wide structural diversity. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of 10 CT-containing plants (Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala, Stylosanthes guianensis, Gliricidia sepium, Cratylia argentea, Cajanus cajan, Desmodium ovalifolium, Macrotiloma axilare, D. paniculatum, and Lespedeza procumbens) on in vitro fermentation kinetics of Nelore beef cattle. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a specific CT-binding agent, was added to neutralize condensed tannin. Tifton and alfalfa hay were used as controls lacking CT. The experimental layout included a randomized complete block with factorial design and four blocks. The data were subjected to analysis of variance followed by Duncan’s test to determine differences (p < 0.05) among treatment means. The addition of PEG in browse incubations resulted in increased gas production, fermentation rate, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and N-NH3 release. Within our study, Lespedeza procumbens, Desmodium paniculatum, Leucaena leucocephala, Desmodium ovalifolium, and Flemingia macrophylla showed superior bioactivity compared to other species evaluated, suggesting a natural alternative for replacing ionophores to modify ruminal fermentation. Condensed tannins from L. pocumbens, D. paniculatum, L. leucocephala, D. ovalifolium, and F. macrophylla have the potential to modify rumen fermentation in beef cattle. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Bio-methane production via anaerobic co-digestion by optimizing the mixing ratios of river tamarind (Leucaena leucocephala) and dolphin fish (Coryphaena hippurus) offal
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089772646&doi=10.3390%2fPR8080934&partnerID=40&md5=2fc6f6f4efba4ec0f2497a51e471d8ff
AB  - Fish offal and other high protein substrates are generally not suitable for anaerobic digestion because of the high levels of ammonia produced as a result of their biodegradation. In order to efficiently use these types of substrates to produce methane, co-digestion is used to balance the amounts of carbon and nitrogen in the feedstock. In this experiment an optimization procedure for maximizing the methane potential of fish offal, using river tamarind as the co-substrates was developed. Our experimental design tested the effects of substrate to substrate mixtures, as well as overall substrate to inoculum combinations, on the methane potentials. This was performed using batch style biochemical methane potential assays, which employed a methodology developed in our laboratory. The optimum of the 25 combinations tested was 50% fish offal to 50% river tamarind at a substrate to inoculum ratio of 0.03, with a specific methane yield of 144 ± 6 NmL/gFM (330 ± 14 NmL/goDM). This gave much improvement when compared with the fish offal alone, which reached 63 ± 4 NmL/gFM (317 ± 20 NmL/goDM) at maximum. These results indicate that with the correct mixture, rivertamarind is a suitable co-substrate for anaerobic co-digestion of fish offal. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Effect of dried leaves of leucaena leucocephala on rumen fermentation, rumen microbial population, and enteric methane production in crossbred heifers

AB  - The effects of dietary inclusion of dried Leucaena leucocephala leaves (DLL) on nutrient digestibility, fermentation parameters, microbial rumen population, and production of enteric methane (CH4) in crossbred heifers were evaluated. Four heifers were used in a 4×4 Latin square design consisting of four periods and four levels of inclusion of DLL: 0%, 12%, 24%, and 36% of dry matter (DM) intake. Results showed that DM intake (DMI), organic matter intake, and gross energy intake (GEI) were similar (p > 0.05) among treatments. Apparent digestibility of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and energy decreased with increasing levels of DLL in the ration (p < 0.05). In contrast, digestible crude protein (CP) was higher (p < 0.05) in treatments with 12% and 24% DM of DLL. The inclusion of DLL did not affect (p > 0.05) rumen pH and total volatile fatty acids. Rumen microbial community was not affected (p > 0.05) by treatment. There was a linear reduction (p < 0.05) in CH4 emissions as the levels of DLL in the ration were increased. Results of this study suggest that an inclusion of 12% DM of ration as DLL enhances digestible CP and reduces daily production of enteric CH4 without adversely affecting DMI, rumen microbial population, and fermentation parameters. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Syahbudin A, Meinata A, Arifriana R, Wiyono. 2020. The composition of undergrowth vegetation in the Gendol Riverbank, Sleman District, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 1786-1792. Gendol river is one of the rivers affected by a pyroclastic blast from Mount Merapi eruption in 2010. This river flows through several villages, such as Glagaharjo, Kepuharjo, Wukirsari, and Argomulyo. On this riverbank, vegetation has grown naturally post-eruption of Mount Merapi and is continues to change. Some vegetation was also planted by the community. This study aims to find out the composition of the undergrowth vegetation on the Gendol riverbank in Cangkringan Sub-district. The data was obtained systematically by marking 10 sample plots of 5 m x 5 m and 2 m x 2 m size, on each side of the bank. A total of 68 species were recorded in this study which consisted of 29 trees species in seedlings and saplings stage, 34 species of herbs and shrubs, and 6 species of grasses. The dominant among the non-tree species are Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M.King & H.Rob. with an IVI of 43.78%, Alternanthera brasiliana (L.) Kuntze with IVI of 16.6% and Asystasia gangetica (L.) T. Anderson with IVI of 15.78%. Saplings are dominated by Falcataria moluccana (Miq.) Barneby & J.W. Grimes with IVI of 32.81%, followed by Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit (IVI-24.41%) and Melia azedarach (IVI-14.28%). © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Buffaloes use wallowing behavior to release excess heat in tropical conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of silvopastoral systems in the feeding and thermoregulatory behavior of water buffaloes under moderate and intense heat stress. The behavior of water buffaloes was evaluated in two different production systems. The conventional system with Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) only, and the silvopastoral system with Guinea grass and Leucaena leucocephala trees. The relation between the frequency of animal activities and the length of time the animals engaged in each activity was measured during the day time (6:00–18:00 h) by visual observations at 10-min intervals. The results obtained suggest that buffaloes use tree shade to partially supplement wallowing. Feeding behavior increased under intense heat stress in the silvopastoral system indicating that it can be a promising alternative to improve the buffaloes rearing conditions in the tropics. © Copyright © 2020 Galloso-Hernández, Rodríguez-Estévez, Alvarez-Díaz, Soca-Pérez, Dublin, Iglesias-Gómez and Simon Guelmes.

AB  - The plant kingdom can influence the productivity and health of herbivores at different levels. However, demonstrating this process in a scientific manner entails substantial endeavors from different disciplines. In the present review, we will describe the features of a native vegetation system traditionally used by small ruminants and use its particularities to build an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate the nutraceutical properties of plants. Initially, we will establish the context of the low deciduous forest (LDF), considering some botanical and nutritional aspects, as well as the presence of plant secondary compounds (PSC) and gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN). Furthermore, we will focus on coevolutionary aspects that undoubtedly shaped the plants–nutrients–PSC–GIN– herbivore relationship. In addition, the concept of nutraceutical will be discussed to provide clarity and aspects to be considered for their evaluation. Then, ethological, agronomical, nutritional, PSC, parasitological and animal species issues are deepened placing emphasis on methodological approaches. Special focus is given to condensed tannins, as they are the fourth largest group of PSCs and the most studied in livestock sciences. Validation of the nutraceutical properties of plants from native vegetation systems should be seen as a process derived from many scientific disciplines that feed into each other in a cyclic manner. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this experimental study, seeds of wild tree species namely Acacia nilotica, Prosopis juliflora, Albizia lebbeck, and Leucaena leucocephala were explored as potential feedstocks for anaerobic digestion and compared with cattle manure which is a commonly used feedstock. These seeds occur abundantly as waste biomass in tropical and subtropical parts of Asia, Africa, and the USA. An experimental investigation was carried out in large 300-L anaerobic digesters under semi-continuous feed mode for 90 days. The average specific methane production yield observed was 0.208 Nm3/kg volatile solids (VS) for A. nilotica, 0.227 Nm3/kg VS for P. juliflora, 0.219 Nm3/kg VS for A. lebbeck and 0.210 Nm3/kg VS for L. leucocephala which was found to be higher than cattle manure’s yield of 0.146 Nm3/kg VS. Experimental analysis revealed an average methane content of more than 52% for all the seeds and a total volatile solid mass removal efficiency of 41.60% for A. nilotica, 44.19% for P. juliflora, 43.76% for A. lebbeck, and 41.41% for L. leucocephala which was higher than 29.7% for cattle manure. The experimental investigations showed that they have a higher biogas production potential than cattle manure indicating their huge scope and suitability as alternative feedstocks, and their use can also mitigate the ecological risk seeds pose by growing into invasive trees. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Pharmacology has developed many drugs to treat infections, but many people, especially in developing countries, cannot afford to purchase them, and still depend on traditional knowledge and local medicinal plants to fight off infections. In addition, numerous microbes have developed resistance to the pharmaceutical drugs developed to fight them, and for many, such as Covid-19, effective drugs remain to be found. Ethnomedicinal knowledge is useful, not only for local people as a source of medicine for primary health care, but also for new pharmacological discoveries. This study aimed to identify the plants that the Karen, the largest hill-tribe ethnic minority in northern and western Thailand, use for treatments of infectious diseases. We present a meta-analysis of data from 16 ethnobotanical studies of 25 Karen villages with the aim of understanding traditional knowledge and treatments and point to potential plants for further pharmacological development. The Karen used 127 plant species from 59 plant families to treat infections and infectious diseases. The Cultural Important Index (CI) showed that the Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae, Asteraceae, Lauraceae, Apocynaceae, Menispermaceae, and Lamiaceae were the most commonly used families. As for species, Cleidion javanicum, Tinospora crispa, Litsea cubeba, Aesculus assamica, Tadehagi triquetrum, Senna alata, Tithonia diversifolia, Embelia sessiliflora, and Combretum indicum were the most commonly used in treatments of infectious diseases. We suggest that these plant species should be the first to be pharmacologically tested for possible development of medicines, and the remaining species registered should subsequently undergo testing. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Quantifying non-fibrous carbohydrates, acid detergent fiber and cellulose of forage through an in vitro gas production technique
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081348247&doi=10.1002%2fjsfa.10342&partnerID=40&md5=6e6a42c0e4070557db08e8faea612984
AB  - BACKGROUND: The in vitro gas production (GP) technique has been useful for evaluating the potential degradability of feedstuffs in ruminal environments; GP is related to the components of feedstuff ingredients. RESULTS: Linear models were generated and validated as alternatives of quantifying neutral detergent-soluble fiber, starch (St)/hemicellulose (Hem) and cellulose (Cel) through GP. Residuals of models obtained from the peaks of GP [0–8 h (GP-8), > 8–24 h (GP-24), > 24–48 h (GP-48) and > 24–81 h (GP-81)] of 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12 and 0.20 g of glucose (Glu), St and Cel respectively. The incubations were analyzed in mixtures of Glu, St and Cel. The best fitting models (r2 from 0.709 to 0.935) were tested on corn stover (CS) to quantify rapid fermentation fractions (RF; equivalent to Glu), medium fermentation fractions (MF; equivalent to St) and low fermentation fractions (LF48; equivalent to Cel); in CS, RF, MF and LF models had standardized residuals < 0.09. The analysis with Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam. de Wit) and star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst) consider high-protein ingredients. CONCLUSION: The in vitro GP of RF, MF and LF48 fractions equivalent to Glu, St and Cel are affected by maturity and harvest time even when the chemical composition remains similar, and so RF, MF and LF48 should be considered during the design of ruminant diets. In vitro GP could be used to quantify the components of some forages, although further studies are necessary. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - There is ever increasing problem of air pollution in cities due to urbanization, industrialization, population growth and increased number of vehicles. Plants can play a vital role in mitigation of air pollution in urban areas. The present study was conducted to estimate the Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) and Anticipated Performance Index (API) for 21 different plant species used for green belt development along the roadsides in Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan. For APTI and API estimation, ascorbic acid, total chlorophyll content, relative water content and pH of leaf extract of selected plant species were measured using standard methods. The results showed that Syzygium cumini L. (jaman), Pterospermum acerifolium (kanak champa) and Alstonia scholaris (devil tree) were the excellent performers. According to API and APTI values, these species were found effective in reducing air pollution and could be effective for green belt development in urban areas. Albezia lebbeck, Melia azedarach, Eucliptus camaldulensis, Dalbergia sissoo, Tamarindus indica, Acacia nilotica L., Callistemon viminalis and Leucaena leucocephala are very poor performers regarding air and noise abatement. These plants are very poor performers and are very sensitive plants to air pollution. These plants can be used as bio-indicators of poor urban air quality. © 2020, University of the Philippines Los Banos. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seasonally Distinctive Growth and Drought Stress Functional Traits Enable Leucaena Leucocephala to Successfully Invade a Chinese Tropical Forest
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094626677&doi=10.1177%2f1940082920949176&partnerID=40&md5=3dc35cec8ae6efbbd77ff981e4fb03b6
AB  - The nitrogen-fixing mimosid Leucaena leucocephala continues to be used for afforestation in degraded tropical forests. Yet, fast-growth and high drought stress tolerance enables L. leucocephala to outperform native species and L. leucocephala has been identified as one of the 100 most invasive species globally. This warrants development of effective control measures, including bio-controls, to prevent the spread of this species particularly across tropical islands. Here, we compare differences in key functional traits between L. leucocephala and eight dominant native species (Bridelia tomentosa, Radermachera frondosa, Lepisanthes rubiginosa, Rhaphiolepis indica, Pterospermum heterophyllum, Fissistigma oldhamii, Psychotria rubra and Cudrania cochinchinensis) in L. leucocephala invaded tropical forests of Hainan Island, China. Functional traits related to growth (photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate) and drought stress tolerance (leaf turgor loss point) were measured in wet and dry seasons to investigate whether these functional traits differed between L. leucocephala and the eight dominant native species. Our results demonstrate that L. leucocephala has significantly increased growth rates (at least two-fold) in both wet and dry seasons. Additionally, L. leucocephala shows significantly higher drought stress tolerance (lower TLP) in the dry season. These results indicate that L. leucocephala would almost certainly outperform the eight dominant native species and might successfully invade Hainan tropical forests. There is an urgent need to identify native species that have similar growth and drought stress tolerance traits to enable the development of effective strategies to control L. leucocephala on Hainan Island. © The Author(s) 2020.

TI  - Effect of age of regrowth, chemical composition and secondary metabolites on the digestibility of Leucaena leucocephala in the Cauto Valley, Cuba

AB  - Finding alternatives to deal with the lack of feed during the dry period is a challenge for animal research in tropical areas. The effect of age of regrowth (60, 120 or 180 days), chemical composition and secondary metabolites on Leucaena leucocephala digestibility was evaluated. A randomized block design with six replicates was used. The statistical procedures included analysis of variance and correlation and regression analysis. Multiple linear equations between in vitro and in situ digestibility, as dependent variables, and the age of regrowth, NDF, ADF, lignin, Ca, Si, NDF/N, ADF/N, tannins, condensed tannins and saponins, as explanatory variables, were established. An increase in cell wall content and its components with age of regrowth, and a variable response in mineral concentrations were observed. The linear equations relating digestibility with the age of regrowth, NDF, ADF and Si (R2 > 0.78) or with the secondary metabolites tannins, condensed tannins and saponins (R2 > 0.79) were statistically significant (p < 0.05) explaining a high proportion of variance. The regrowth age, cell wall components, polyphenol compounds, saponins contents determined the forage digestibility and these aspects must be taken into consideration to estimate the nutritional value of Leucaena roughage to be used as feedstuff for animals. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Savannas in Indonesia are located from west to the east across the archipelago. The objective of this research was to investigate the dissimilarity of floristic composition among savannas at different elevations in Flores. Sixteen sampling plots, each measuring 20 x 20 m were spread over the lowland, midland, and upland savannas. We analyzed the differences in plant community composition among the savannas using NMDS ordination and SIMPER analyses available in PRIMER V.6. As many as 41 species of plants were found in all of the sampling plots. The lowland savanna plant community consisted of Themeda arguens, Zoesya sp., Chromolaena odorata, Crotalaria sp., Adenanthera pavonina, Ocimum sp., Lantana camara in the groundcover layer, and Ziziphus jujube, and Borassus flabellifer at the tree layer. The midland savanna had almost similar composition, except the occurrence of Imperata cylindrica and Leucaena leucocephala, and the upland savanna plant species were Cyperus sp., Polygala paniculata, I. cylindrica, Melastoma malabathricum, C. odorata, Centella asiatica, Vaccinium sp., and Cymbopogon sp. The savannas in Flores were invaded by invasive exotic species, namely L. camara and C. Odorata which may pose serious threat to the existence of savannas. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

TI  - A minimal genetic passkey to unlock many legume doors to root nodulation by rhizobia

AB  - In legume crops, formation of developmentally mature nodules is a prerequisite for efficient nitrogen fixation by populations of rhizobial bacteroids established inside nodule cells. Development of root nodules, and concomitant microbial colonization of plant cells, are constrained by sets of recognition signals exchanged by infecting rhizobia and their legume hosts, with much of the specificity of symbiotic interactions being determined by the flavonoid cocktails released by legume roots and the strain-specific nodulation factors (NFs) secreted by rhizobia. Hence, much of Sinorhizobium fredii strain NGR234 symbiotic promiscuity was thought to stem from a family of >80 structurally diverse NFs and associated nodulation keys in the form of secreted effector proteins and rhamnose-rich surface polysaccharides. Here, we show instead that a mini-symbiotic plasmid (pMiniSym2) carrying only the nodABCIJ, nodS and nodD1 genes of NGR234 conferred promiscuous nodulation to ANU265, a derivative strain cured of the large symbiotic plasmid pNGR234a. The ANU265::pMiniSym2 transconjugant triggered nodulation responses on 12 of the 22 legumes we tested. On roots of Macroptilium atropurpureum, Leucaena leucocephala and Vigna unguiculata, ANU265::pMiniSym2 formed mature-like nodule and successfully infected nodule cells. While cowpea and siratro responded to nodule colonization with defense responses that eventually eliminated bacteria, L. leucocephala formed leghemoglobin-containing mature-like nodules inside which the pMiniSym2 transconjugant established persistent intracellular colonies. These data show seven nodulation genes of NGR234 suffice to trigger nodule formation on roots of many hosts and to establish chronic infections in Leucaena cells. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This study focused on utilization of Leucaena leucocephala seeds’ extract and iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) under magnetic field to provide effective coagulation process. Leucaena seeds’ extract was obtained using 3 M NaCl solution as solvent at feed-to-solvent mass ratio of 1:20. IONPs were synthesized using co-precipitation method. The obtained IONPs were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Based on analysis results, the obtained IONPs were the agglomerate of Fe3O4 phase with average particle diameter of 14.6 nm. The extract and IONPs were used as natural coagulant at various pHs (3–12), coagulant dosages (4–40 mL extract/L), and IONPs concentrations (0.5–3 mg/mL extract) under external magnetic field. It was obtained that pH 3 was the best pH because positively charged Leucaena protein at pH 3 acts to neutralize negatively charged Congo red molecules. The highest removal was obtained at coagulant dosage of 20 mL/L, and further increase in dosage was decreasing the removal due to colloid re-stabilization effect. The variation of IONPs concentration did not give any effect on the %removal and sludge volume. However, further investigation using pseudo-second-order kinetic model showed that the increase in IONPs concentration gave increase to the kinetic constant, signifying faster settling kinetics. The best condition was obtained at pH 3, coagulant dosage 20 mL/L, and IONPs concentration of 3 mg/mL extract that gave 90% Congo red removal, 30 mL/L sludge volume, and 30 min settling time. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Giant leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata) is an arboreal tree legume, which is widely grown as a source of high-protein fodder for animals. The goal of this research was to identify genes that are highly expressed in the foliage so that the yield and nutritional value of the foliage can be further enhanced in giant leucaena grown for fodder. Through microarray analysis of 10,000 cDNA, based on a transcriptome library of giant leucaena, 138 gene sequences were identified to be expressed highly in the foliage compared with the root. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis validated the expression of 13 genes selected from the most highly expressed sequences in the foliage. These genes encoded proteins involved in the metabolism of starch, lipids, cell wall components and secondary metabolites such as β-amyrin and mimosine. Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase and mimosinase are two of the most highly expressed genes in the foliage. Mimosinase is involved in recycling mimosine, which may be a storage molecule that is degraded to produce substrates for synthesis of amino acids and other metabolites. Some of the highly expressed genes identified in this study can be used in future breeding programs for enhancing fodder yield and quality of giant leucaena. © 2019, © 2019 Societá Botanica Italiana.

TI  - The chemical weathering and its controlling factors of topsoil in the hot-dry valley of the lower Yalongjiang river
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111007815&doi=10.11928%2fj.issn.1001-7410.2020.04.21&partnerID=40&md5=cad67ca1f7c01633516e31db541e4e58
AB  - Rocks/minerals chemical weathering is a superficial geochemical process in which releasing nutrient elements to soil and forming clay minerals in the soil, and simultaneously developing eco-environmental functions of soil. In this study, we selected 10 community plots, located respectively in the different slopes and mountain rift basins (26°32'~34°05'N, 96°52'~102°48'E) with elevation ranging from 1000 m to 3000 m in the lower reaches of the Yalongjiang River on the southeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, including grassland, savanna, mixed woodland, Leucaena leucocephala woodland, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest land, Pinus yunnanensis woodland, wide-valley grassland, corn field, mango orchard and apple orchard, etc.,  and collected its topsoil samples, respectively. The grain size composition and mineral elemental composition were analyzed, the proxies of grain size and geochemical parameters and the methods of correlation analysis and ridge regression analysis were employed. The objectives of this study were to explore the evolution trend of the topsoil chemical weathering; to quantify the contributions of major controlling factors to the topsoil chemical weathering; and to evaluate the carbon sink potential of the topsoil chemical weathering in the hot-dry valleys of the southwestern China. The results show that the spatial differences of the topsoil chemical weathering intensity resulted in significant spatial heterogeneity of the topsoil grain size composition in the study area. In the south of the study area with lower altitude (below 1300 m) and steeper slope, including grassland, savanna, mixed woodland, Leucaena leucocephala woodland, corn field and mango orchard, the grain size of the topsoil occurs more coarse (mean grain size ranging from 3.94 φ to 6.35 φ) and merely 6.51% of clay content. The topsoil is characterized by relatively weak eco-environmental function. However, in the western study area with higher elevation (above 2400 m) and gentle slope, including wide-valley grassland, Pinus yunnanensis woodland, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest land and apple orchard, the grain size of the topsoil exists more finer (mean grain size ranging from 7.91 φ to 8.57 φ) and higher clay content (39.21%). Hence, the topsoil is characterized by stronger eco-environmental function. Comparing with the upper continental crust, terrestrial shale and Chinese soil geochemical baseline values, the content of element K, P, and Si is lower, and the content of element Ti, Mn, and Fe is higher in the topsoil of the study area. The contents of mobile elements (Mg, Ca, and Na) varies widely in the topsoil among the different communities, which is consistent with the rocks features of widespread distribution of carbonate rocks, sand shales and mudstones, and sparse silicate rocks as well as the intensive slope erosion in the study area. For the purpose of ensuring the yield and quality of crops and the soil resources in the study area, it is necessary to rational application of K and P-containing fertilizers and organic fertilizers, and at the same time strengthen field management to reduce the pollution of rainwater runoff carrying nutrients flushing into the cascade reservoirs in the lower Yalongjiang River. The spatial variation of the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) and the A-CN-K triangle diagrams show that the topsoil in the western study area is undergoing a moderate-intensity weathering process (the averaged CIA=86), and is in the stage of desilicating and ferrallitic weathering process. The chemical weathering of the topsoil on the steeper slopes in the southern study area is in the lower to medium development stage (the averaged CIA=65), and is in the leaching stage of element Ca and Na. Hence, the topsoil chemical weathering process in the study area may still consume atmospheric CO2 and serve as carbon sinks. The Ridge regression analysis suggested that the spatial differences of the topsoil chemical weathering intensity in the study area were mainly predominated by parent rocks, altitude, slope, and soil TN content, which contribution to the topsoil CIA value is 57.34%, 23.46%, 10.33%, and 6.87%, respectively. Obviously, the nature of the parent rocks is the major factor controlling the topsoil chemical weathering process in the study area. The geomorphological factors (elevation and slope) are the main external factors driving the chemical weathering process, and the impact of the elevation on the CIA value is greater than that of the slope; The biological action contribute limitedly to the CIA value too. This study can provide basic data for deeply discussing soil biogeochemical processes in hot-dry valleys. © 2020, Science in China Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Living fences for improved smallholder livestock systems in Cambodia
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092157447&doi=10.1080%2f14728028.2020.1827049&partnerID=40&md5=6e4d41125af1e230fe7a3f5479083a99
AB  - In northwest Cambodia, the majority of smallholder households own livestock. Poor consistency in feed supply throughout the year is a major constraint to livestock performance. Another critical challenge, livestock roaming in the dry season for forage, results in smallholders having few options to protect any post-rice dry season cropping activity from free-ranging animals. Living fences have the potential to address both these challenges, by providing high-quality feed for livestock throughout the year, while also serving as a barrier to protect the land from livestock grazing. A mixed-methods approach was used with communities in Battambang Province, including household surveys, a fodder production experiment, a cattle feeding trial, farmer training and data on dissemination and adoption. Results showed that living fence species, such as Leucaena leucocephala, can produce 2.5 kg of fresh weight per week per 100 trees during the dry season. This biomass volume is sufficient to supplement cattle diets so that a smallholder can sustain a small percentage weight gain in cows throughout the dry season. Critical challenges, including land tenure, physical access to paddy lands, and the gendered nature of these farming systems, remain for realizing private benefit on paddy lands culturally considered public in the dry season. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to study the effect of mixing ratios of binder on the properties of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) pellets. In this study, the fermented cassava-rhizome was used as a binder in the production of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) pellets. The duration time of the fermentation process was three days. The mixing ratios of leucaena with fermented cassava-rhizome varied at 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 50:50, respectively. The results demonstrated that the mixing ratios of binder affected the bulk density and durability of leucaena pellets. The increasing amount of fermented cassava-rhizome increased the bulk density and durability of leucaena pellets. The physical properties were determined following the Pellet Fuels Institute standard specification for residential/commercial densified fuel. Moreover, the results illustrated that the optimal mixing ratios (leucaena: fermented cassava-rhizome) in the production process of pellets was 70:30, as this mixing ratio provided the lowest energy consumption (420 kWh/ton) in pellets production and the highest mass yield at 94.3%. Thus, the results obtained from this research suggested that the fermented cassava-rhizome as a binder might be an alternative adhesive material for improving the asymmetrical structure and physical properties of biomass raw materials. © 2020 Silpakorn University .

TI  - Evaluation of nutraceutical properties of Leucaena leucocephala leaf pellets fed to goat kids infected with Haemonchus contortus
PY  - 2020

AB  - Background: Leucaena leucocephala, as a shrub legume rich in condensed tannins, is a candidate for the integrated control of gastrointestinal parasitic pathogen nematodes. Here, we investigated the anthelmintic potential of the nutraceutical L. leucocephala, transformed into pellets, against Haemonchus contortus. Results: Creole goat kids were fed an iso-nitrogenous diet of Dichantium hay with alfalfa pellets or Leucaena pellets or an alfalfa-leucaena mixture in varying ratios. The artificial infection of kids with H. contortus led to infection levels comparable to those observed in the farm environment on the basis of egg excretion. The anthelmintic activity of Leucaena, compared to alfalfa, was demonstrated by its potential to reduce egg excretions (1524 vs. 3651 eggs/g) and the larval development of excreted eggs (3.5 vs. 24%). This anthelmintic potential was reported when the ratio of Leucaena incorporation in the diet was high (50% DM intake). The voluntary dry matter intake (79.3 vs. 77.0 g Large Weigth0.75), the total tract dry matter digestion (0.585 vs. 0.620), and the growth (57.1 vs. 71.3 g/d) of kids fed Leucaena compared to alfalfa indicate that Leucaena has a high feed value. The Leucaena, even at the highest intakes in the diets, has not shown any signs of poisoning in kids. Conclusions: Leucaena fulfilled the conditions to be a good nutraceutical, and pelleting is a good method for its use. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Mimosine facilitates metallic cation uptake by plants through formation of mimosine–cation complexes

AB  - Key message: Iron deficiency conditions as well as iron supplied as a Fe(III)–mimosine complex induced a number of strategy I and strategy II genes for iron uptake in leucaena. Abstract: Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a tree-legume that can grow in alkaline soils, where metal-cofactors like Fe(III) are sparingly available. Mimosine, a known chelator of Fe(III), may facilitate Fe(III) uptake in leucaena by serving as a phytosiderophore. To test if mimosine can serve as a phytosiderophore, three sets of experiments were carried out. First, the binding properties and solubility of metal–mimosine complexes were assessed through spectrophotometry. Second, to study mimosine uptake in plants, pole bean, common bean, and tomato plants were supplied with mimosine alone and metal–mimosine complexes. Third, the expression of strategy I (S1) and strategy II (S2) genes for iron uptake from the soil was studied in leucaena plants exposed to different Fe(III) complexes. The results of this study show that (i) mimosine has high binding affinity for metallic cations at alkaline pH, Fe(III)–mimosine complexes are water soluble at alkaline pH, and that mimosine can bind soil iron under alkaline pH; (ii) pole bean, common bean, and tomato plants can uptake mimosine and transport it throughout the plant; and (iii) a number of S1 and S2 genes were upregulated in leucaena under iron-deficiency condition or when Fe(III) was supplied as a Fe(III)–mimosine complex. These findings suggest that leucaena may utilize both S1 and S2 strategies for iron uptake; and mimosine may play an important role in both strategies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The biomass and nutritional value of Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham (5,000 trees ha-1) and Megathyrsus maximus cv. Tanzania was assessed in a silvopastoral system in a tropical hot sub-humid climate in the rainy and dry seasons. Samplings were done from August-October 2014 (rainy) and March-April 2015 (dry). The treatments were harvests at 20-, 30-, 40- and 50-d intervals in both seasons, randomly assigned to twelve (24 m2) paddocks. The grass accounted for most of the total available forage in the silvopastoral system (80 vs 20 %). In both seasons, the association yielded more forage at the 50-d interval (5,300 kg DM ha-1 in the rainy season and 1,620 kg DM ha-1 in the dry season) (P<0.05). During the rainy season, crude protein (CP) in the tree forage was higher at the 50-d interval (22 %; P<0.05), but did not change over the intervals during the dry season (28 %; P>0.05); neutral detergent fiber (NDF) did not change over time (44 %; P>0.05) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) increased in the 50-d interval (25 %, P<0.05) but in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) decreased (49 %; P<0.05), regardless of season. Crude protein (10%; P<0.001) and IVDMD (58 %; P<0.03) of M. maximus remained high from the 20- to 40-d intervals, although in both seasons NDF and ADF fractions significantly increased after the 40-d interval. The evaluated silvopastoral system attains highest yield between the 40- and 50-d intervals. The highest nutritional quality of M. maximus was at 40 ds, after which the nutritional quality of L. leucocephala may compensate for the lost nutritional quality of the grass, regardless of season. © 2020 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit is a fast-growing tree species often used as lead (shade) tree that can be cultivated in Malaysia. This species has potential as an alternative resource for the Malaysian furniture and panel board industries in the coming years because of a shortage of the current frequently used raw material (rubberwood). A study on growth performance and potential as particleboard resource material was done. In terms of growth performance, the preliminary study indicated that Leucaena trees grew at a rate of 44% from the first month to the forth month and 43% from 6 to 12 months. As for particleboard manufacturing, Leucaena: Rubberwood admixture bound with urea formaldehyde (8%, 10 % and 12% resin content) to a density of 700 kg/m3, showed promise of usability when all boards pass the Type P2 board requirement of EN312:2010. In general, L. leucocephala wood is a potential raw material for the manufacture of wood composites. © 2020

TI  - Establishing high-density protein banks for livestock in Burkina Faso (West Africa): agronomic performance under contrasting edaphoclimatic conditions

AB  - West African livestock keepers need forage sources to feed animals without degrading the local fragile ecosystems. Establishing high-density forage protein banks for animal feeding was evaluated in three contrasting zones of Burkina Faso. The agronomic performance of the fodder species Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) and Morus alba (mulberry), planted for intensive forage production (25,000 plants/ha) was monitored through plant height (HEI), stem diameter (DIA), branch number (BrN) and branch length (BrL). Once plots were considered established (at 7 months) all trees were coppiced. Biomass yield subsequently was monitored over three bi-monthly harvests which began approximately 1 year after planting. For both species, a highly significant interaction between experimental site and dates was observed for all variables except BrN. Average HEI (103 cm) were similar. DIA (7 ± 0.4 cm) and BrL (55 ± 2.2 cm) were higher in mulberry (6 ± 0.1 and 29 ± 1.0 cm, respectively), whereas the BrN remained higher in leucaena (7 ± 0.2 vs. 2 ± 0.1 cm). No differences were observed in HEI between sites from June to August. However, from September to October, both species displayed a stronger growth rate at site 1. The biomass yields (t DM/ha/year) in three consecutive harvests were lower than values reported in other tropical regions (1.8 ± 1.2 and 8.1 ± 3.9, for mulberry and leucaena, respectively). Differences between sites were due mainly to soil properties, rainfall pattern and termite attacks. This study demonstrated that L. leucocephala and M. alba, planted in high-density forage banks, successfully establish and have high forage yield across several edaphoclimatic conditions in Burkina Faso. Our findings suggest that this technology could significantly contribute to livestock feeding systems in the region, thus reducing negative effects of over-grazing on landscape degradation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The effect of moisture on seedling growth of Albizia lebbeck (L) Benth., Leucaena leucocephala Lam. and Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. was evaluated in central India dur i ng 2018. One mont h ol d seedl i ngs r ai sed i n polyethylene bags containing about 3 kg of garden soil were subjected to three watering frequencies as irrigating daily (control), and withholding irrigation upto 14 days (i ntermedi ate stress) and 21 days (severe stress). Observations were made according to different watering frequencies on eight quantitative traits viz. plant height, root length, survival percentage, relative water content, excised leaf water loss, total chlorophyll content, proline content and total biomass. All the traits considered were signi fi cantly decreased as stress i ncreased. Under opt i mum moi st ur e condi t i on A. l ebbeck and L. l eucocephal a per f or med wel l t han D. si ssoo. At intermediate stress D. sissoo had maximum reduction of 81.36%, 54.33%, 43.62% and 20.0% for traits like total biomass, root length, total chlorophyll content and survival percent, respectively. In severe stress condition also the pattern was similar as D. sissoo had maximum reduction for total biomass (84.75%), root length (63.77%), total chl orophyl l content (46.30%) and survi val percent (40.0%). While L. leucocephala had higher reduction for plant height by 26.46% and 40.03% at intermediate stress and severe stress, respectively and it also had higher reduction for total biomass (84.92%) at severe stress. In contrast, A. lebbeck had minimum reduction for the traits like total biomass (60.87%), root length (25.94%), survival percent (no reduction), total chlorophyll cont ent (17. 38%) and pl ant hei ght (17. 37%) at intermediate stress. Also the reduction pattern was similar at severe stress for total biomass (63.77%), root length (38.03%), survival percent (no reduction), plant height (32.79%) and total chlorophyll content (27.02%). In both stress levels, A. lebbeck had higher relative water content, proline accumulation and lower excised leaf water loss than L. leucocephala> D. sissoo. Based on physiological and biochemical trait expressions and mini--mum percent reduction for putative traits the species A. l ebbeck i ndi cat ed bet t er dr ought r esi st ance as compared with L. leucocephala > D. sissoo. Hence, A. lebbeck can be a choice of species for better agroforestry programmes i n drought thrivi ng ari d and semi-ari d regions. © 2020, Range Management Society of India. All rights reserved.

TI  - Diversity of rhizobia and importance of their interactions with legume trees for feasibility and sustainability of the tropical agrosystems
PY  - 2020

AB  - Symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a complex process that involves rhizobia, a diverse group of α and β-proteobacteria bacteria, and legume species. Benefits provided by BNF associated with legume trees in tropical environments include improvements to efficiency of nitrogen (N) use, increase of soil carbon sequestration, stabilization of soil organic matter, decrease of soil penetration resistance, and improvement of soil fertility. All these benefits make BNF a crucial ecosystem service to the sustainability of tropical agriculture. Due to the importance of this ecological process and the high diversity of rhizobia, these bacteria have been extensively characterized worldwide. Currently, over 400 species of rhizobia are known, distributed into seven families. In the humid tropics, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia mangium, Gliricidia sepium, and Clitoria fairchildiana are four of the most common species used by family farmers to create sustainable agricultural systems. These four legumes perform symbiosis with different groups of rhizobia. Exploring BNF could help to enable sustainable intensification of agriculture in the humid tropics, mainly because it can increase N use efficiency in an environment where N is a limiting factor to plant growth. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the nutritional value of three leguminous trees heavily selected by goats in a xerophilous shrubland. Chemical composition and in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD) of leaves and pods from leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), mesquite (Prosopis laevigata), and huisache (Acacia farnesiana) is presented. Crude protein (CP) ranged from 17.3% for leaves of huisache to 21.9% for leucaena. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content ranged from 39.0 to 40.3 with no difference among fodder threes. Across tree species, mean IVDMD was 61.6% for pods and 52.2% for leaves. IVDMD for leaves was highest (p < 0.01) for leucaena (54.9%) and lowest for huisache (47.3%). Condensed tannins in an acetonic extract were highest for leaves of huisache (45.3 mg CE/g DM) and lowest for mesquite (25.9 mg CE/g DM). Pods and leaves of huisache presented the highest number of secondary metabolites, mainly related to hydroxybenzoic acid and flavonols; leucaena and mesquite presented mainly flavonols and anthocyanins. It was concluded that leaves and pods of leucaena, mesquite, and huisache constitute valuable forages for ruminant livestock due to their low fiber, high CP levels, moderate in vitro fermentation characteristics and high mineral content. © 2020.

AB  - The low availability and fluctuating quantity and quality of forage growing in grassland, shrinking grassland area and poor management are the main causes of increased land degradation and reduced productivity of animals grazing on tropical grasslands. One sustainable way for overcoming the problems is through establishment of Leucaena leucocephala in grasslands. To generate information useful for increasing productivity of grasslands using Leucaena leucocephala, literature concerning the benefits of Leucaena – grass mixture in silvopastoral system in Google Scholar, PubMed, Crossref, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched. From those databases, characteristics of Leucaena in relation to overcoming land degradation and increasing soil fertility were elaborated and highlighted. Nutritive value of Leucaena and grasses, both in mixture and monoculture and their relations to animal production are reviewed and discussed. © 2020 Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.

TI  - Potential of mulberry leaf biomass and its flavonoids to improve production and health in ruminants: Mechanistic insights and prospects
PY  - 2020

AB  - Leaf biomass from the mulberry plant (genus Morus and family Moraceae) is considered a potential resource for livestock feeding. Mulberry leaves (MLs) contain high protein (14.0–34.2%) and metabolizable energy (1130–2240 kcal/kg) with high dry matter (DM) digestibility (75–85%) and palatability. Flavonoid contents of MLs confer unique antioxidant properties and can potentially help alleviate oxidative stress in animals during stressful periods, such as neonatal, weaning, and periparturient periods. In addition, mulberry leaf flavonoids (MLFs) possess antimicrobial properties and can effectively decrease the population of ruminal methanogens and protozoa to reduce enteric methane (CH4 ) production. Owing to its rich flavonoid content, feeding MLs increases fiber digestion and utilization leading to enhanced milk production in ruminants. Dietary supplementation with MLFs alters ruminal fermentation kinetics by increasing total volatile fatty acids, propionate, and ammonia concentrations. Furthermore, they can substantially increase the population of specific cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen. Owing to their structural homology with steroid hormones, the MLFs can potentially modulate different metabolic pathways particularly those linked with energy homeostasis. This review aims to highlight the potential of ML and its flavonoids to modulate the ruminal microbiome, fermentation, and metabolic status to enhance productive performance and health in ruminants while reducing CH4 emission. © MDPI AG.

TI  - Combining organic and mineral fertilizers as a climate-smart integrated soil fertility management practice in sub-Saharan Africa: A meta-analysis
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091622391&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0239552&partnerID=40&md5=35f11a6604567a15105204c26f62d81f
AB  - Low productivity and climate change require climate-smart agriculture (CSA) for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), through (i) sustainably increasing crop productivity, (ii) enhancing the resilience of agricultural systems, and (iii) offsetting greenhouse gas emissions. We conducted a meta-analysis on experimental data to evaluate the contributions of combining organic and mineral nitrogen (N) applications to the three pillars of CSA for maize (Zea mays). Linear mixed effect modeling was carried out for; (i) grain productivity and agronomic efficiency of N (AE) inputs, (ii) inter-seasonal yield variability, and (iii) changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content, while accounting for the quality of organic amendments and total N rates. Results showed that combined application of mineral and organic fertilizers leads to greater responses in productivity and AE as compared to sole applications when more than 100 kg N ha-1 is used with high-quality organic matter. For yield variability and SOC, no significant interactions were found when combining mineral and organic fertilizers. The variability of maize yields in soils amended with high-quality organic matter, except manure, was equal or smaller than for sole mineral fertilizer. Increases of SOC were only significant for organic inputs, and more pronounced for high-quality resources. For example, at a total N rate of 150 kg N ha-1 season-1, combining mineral fertilizer with the highest quality organic resources (50:50) increased AE by 20% and reduced SOC losses by 18% over 7 growing seasons as compared to sole mineral fertilizer. We conclude that combining organic and mineral N fertilizers can have significant positive effects on productivity and AE, but only improves the other two CSA pillars yield variability and SOC depending on organic resource input and quality. The findings of our meta-analysis help to tailor a climate smart integrated soil fertility management in SSA. © 2020 Gram et al.

AB  - The nutritional evaluation of tropical forages in the Caribbean is limited. Therefore, this study was done to provide information on the nutritive value of 12 forages used in regional small ruminant production systems in the Caribbean region, utilising three different methods of forage evaluation. Samples of seven grasses Brachiaria arrecta, Brachiaria ruziziensis, Cynodon dactylon, Cynodon nlemfuensis, Digitaria eriantha, Megathyrsus maximus and Pennisetum purpureum; two leguminous multipurpose tree species (LMPTs) Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala and three non-leguminous multipurpose tree species (NLMPTs) Moringa oleifera, Morus alba and Trichanthera gigantea were collected from one of two sites located in Trinidad and Jamaica. Analysis of nutritive value was done using proximate analysis, in vitro assays and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Cynodon nlemfuensis had the highest crude protein (CP, 191.2 g/kg DM) of the grasses and Leucaena leucocephala and Moringa oleifera the highest CP (263.6 and 232.5 g/kg DM respectively) of the LMPTs and NLMPTs. The NLMPTs, Moringa oleifera and Morus alba had the highest starch, highest in vitro digestible organic matter in dry matter (IVDOMD, 651 and 655 g/kg DM respectively) and metabolisable energy (ME, 10.62 and 10.68 MJ/kg DM respectively) and the lowest neutral detergent fibre (NDF) of the MPTs. There was a strong positive relationship between the IVDOMD and both the CP and starch fractions and a strong negative relationship between the IVDOMD and both the NDF and acid detergent fibre (ADF) fractions. The NIRS predicted values had a strong relationship with the gross chemical CP, NDF, IVDOMD and ME) values of tropical forage species (R2 = 0.91, 0.86, 0.70 and 0.80 respectively). Overall, the forage species were above the minimum CP, IVDOMD and ME required to be classified as intermediate to good quality forages. © 2020 Trop. Agric. (Trinidad).

TI  - Mycorrhizal Atriplex nummularia promote revegetation and shifts in microbial properties in saline Brazilian soil
PY  - 2020

AB  - Soil microbial attributes are the most sensitive indicators of changes in soil quality caused by land use. The restoration of areas with salinity and sodicity problems via revegetation has a significant impact on soil attributes. Understanding the response of microbial indicators is essential to maintain the bioavailability of soil organic matter and provides an alternative to land reclamation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of revegetation on the regeneration of saline soil in a Brazilian semiarid area through evaluating the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and changes in the soil microbial structure and chemical attributes. A field experiment was performed with a randomized block design of eight treatments: a control (without plant cultivation), monocultures (Atriplex nummularia [Atri], Mimosa caesalpiniifolia [Sab], Leucaena leucocephala [Leu], and Azadirachta indica [Neem]), and intercrops (Atri and Sab, Atri and Neem, and Atri and Leu). Soil composite samples were collected from each plot during the dry and rainy seasons when the plants had completed 24 and 30 months of growth after transplanting, respectively. The cultivation of the saline soil allowed an increase in microbial biomass carbon in both seasons. In the rainy season, the soil basal respiration and metabolic quotient were lower in the cultivated area than in the control area. Spore density and mycorrhizal colonization were higher in the cultivated area than in the control area in both seasons. We provide the first data related to the beneficial effects of revegetation with naturally mycorrhized plants of A. nummularia in monoculture or intercrop on the soil quality of a semiarid area. © 2020

AB  - The study was conducted to measure digestibility of dry matter and organic matter in Holstein Friesian cow ration which was supplemented with Leucaena Leucocephala leaves. The experiment was designed followed completely randomized design, consisted of 3 treatments, namely P0, P1 and P2 with 4 replications. Treatment P0 was basal ration, composed of 35% forage + 65% concentrate of total dry matter. Treatment P1 and P2 contained basal ration supplemented by Leucaena Leucocephala leaves as much as 10% and 20% of total forage dry matter, respectively. The data on dry matter, organic matter digestibility and nutrient consumption were collected during 14 days. The results showed no significant different of dry matter, organic matter, crude fibre digestibility among rations. Dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, and crude fibre of ration P1 and P2 were higher than P0. In conclusion, there was no effect of Leucaena Leucocephala leaves supplementation on dry matter and organic matter digestibility of ration but increased the consumption of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and crude fiber. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Leaves of Mulberry (Morus alba Lam.), Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam de wit.) and Moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam.) were evaluated as dry season protein supplements for grazing animals based on chemical composition, in vitro and in sacco nutrient digestibility and a Rabbit feeding trial. All tree fodder forages had similar dry matter (DM) content, but crude protein was higher in Moringa (28.6%) followed by Leucaena (24.5%), Mulberry (24.1%) and Lucerne (18.0%). Ash content was highest in Mulberry followed by Moringa and Lucerne with Leucaena having lowest amounts. Polyphenols ranged from 2.72 to 3.64%, with Leucaena having highest and Mulberry lowest amounts. Dietary fibre were highest in Mulberry and Moringa, but there were no significant differences (P < 0.05) between Leucaena and Lucerne. In vitro gas production and DM disappearances were higher in Moringa followed by Mulberry and Lucerne with Leucaena having lowest amounts. Except for Leucaena, DM disappearances were increased when rumen fluid from dairy cattle steers was used. In sacco DM disappearances were 33.7% for Leucaena, 78.2% for Lucerne, 50.2% for Moringa and 50.7% for Mulberry. In vitro and in sacco crude fibre and neutral detergent fibre disappearances were relatively lower, but reflected DM disappearances. The Rabbit feeding trial showed diets based on Moringa, Leucaena and combined fodder forages to have significantly better performance than Mulberry and grass hay alone. The conclusion was that tested tree fodder forages have potential of being used as dry season protein supplements for grazing animals on traditional smallholder farms. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Bioactive compounds from ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala) seeds were isolated using solvent extraction and silica gel column chromatography. Antifeedant activities of the crude ethanolic extract, chromatographic fractions and crystalline isolate were tested on third instar larvae of the common cutworm (Spodoptera litura). Dual choice assay using 10 μg cm-2 applied on both adaxial and abaxial parts of castor (Ricinus communis) leaves showed that the crystalline isolate had the highest activity, with percentage relative feeding inhibition of 79.93 ± 1.00%. The very high melting point, together with data from chemical and spectroscopic analyses, suggest that the isolate is a saponin-containing complex with molar mass of 662 g mol-1 in the major component. © 2020, College of Agriculture and Food Science, University of the Philippines Los Banos.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of supplementations of Leucaena leucocephala or Gliricidia sepium by goats fed old Panicum maximum basal diets on their dry matter and nutrient intake, digestibility, and N balance. The experiment used four goats weighing of around 12 kg fed four kinds of diet in Latin square design. The diets were 1 young guinea grass, 2 old guinea grass, 3 old guinea grass 60% + Leucaena 40%, 4 old guinea grass 60% + Gliricidia 40%. Results of the study revealed that dry matter and crude protein intake, dry matter, crude protein, and NDF digestibility were significantly higher when the goats fed young grass, Leucaena- or Gliricidia-supplemented old guinea grass than goats fed old guinea grass only. N retained as proportion of ingested N by the goats fed young guinea grass, and old guinea grass supplemented with Leucaena or Gliricidia were positive (63.95, 68.85, and 67.88%, respectively), while the goats fed old guinea grass was negative (− 55.49%). Intake of young grass resulted in greater N excreted via urine while supplementation with Leucaena or Gliricidia resulted in greater N excreted via feces. It can be concluded that supplementation of Leucaena or Gliricidia is very beneficial to increase dry matter and nutrients intake, digestibility, and N retention in goats fed Panicum maximum basal diets. An important finding of this work is that young forage consumed by goats allows to reach important performances and that supplementation is not essential. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Role of Secondary Plant Metabolites on Enteric Methane Mitigation in Ruminants

AB  - The rumen microbiome plays a fundamental role in all ruminant species, it is involved in health, nutrient utilization, detoxification, and methane emissions. Methane is a greenhouse gas which is eructated in large volumes by ruminants grazing extensive grasslands in the tropical regions of the world. Enteric methane is the largest contributor to the emissions of greenhouse gases originating from animal agriculture. A large variety of plants containing secondary metabolites [essential oils (terpenoids), tannins, saponins, and flavonoids] have been evaluated as cattle feedstuffs and changes in volatile fatty acid proportions and methane synthesis in the rumen have been assessed. Alterations to the rumen microbiome may lead to changes in diversity, composition, and structure of the methanogen community. Legumes containing condensed tannins such as Leucaena leucocephala have shown a good methane mitigating effect when fed at levels of up to 30–35% of ration dry matter in cattle as a result of the effect of condensed tannins on rumen bacteria and methanogens. It has been shown that saponins disrupt the membrane of rumen protozoa, thus decreasing the numbers of both protozoa and methanogenic archaea. Trials carried out with cattle housed in respiration chambers have demonstrated the enteric methane mitigation effect in cattle and sheep of tropical legumes such as Enterolobium cyclocarpum and Samanea saman which contain saponins. Essential oils are volatile constituents of terpenoid or non-terpenoid origin which impair energy metabolism of archaea and have shown reductions of up to 26% in enteric methane emissions in ruminants. There is emerging evidence showing the potential of flavonoids as methane mitigating compounds, but more work is required in vivo to confirm preliminary findings. From the information hereby presented, it is clear that plant secondary metabolites can be a rational approach to modulate the rumen microbiome and modify its function, some species of rumen microbes improve protein and fiber degradation and reduce feed energy loss as methane in ruminants fed tropical plant species. © Copyright © 2020 Ku-Vera, Jiménez-Ocampo, Valencia-Salazar, Montoya-Flores, Molina-Botero, Arango, Gómez-Bravo, Aguilar-Pérez and Solorio-Sánchez.

AB  - Experiments were conducted to study the effects of density on growth and biomass partitioning of Leucaena leucocephala seedlings. Four plantations with densities of 10,000, 20,000, 40,000, and 80,000 seedlings ha−1 were evaluated only from 15 to 25 months after planting. At 15 months, crown height and width decreased with increasing density. Seedling height/dbh ratios increased with increasing density. Biomass increased with greater density according to the yield–density effect equation, which was evident for all densities. With increasing age, biomass division to branches and leaves increased, whereas partitioning to roots decreased in the 10,000 and 20,000 seedlings ha−1 plantings. Partitioning to branches and leaves remained relatively steady, while partitioning to roots increased in the 40,000 and 80,000 seedlings ha−1 plantings. Biomass division into stem and bark components remained relatively steady in all densities. Yield–density and organ yield–density curves shifted upward with increasing seedling age on a log–log graph throughout the experimental period. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Seed rain along a gradient of degradation in Caribbean dry forest: Effects of dispersal limitation on the trajectory of forest recovery
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067509220&doi=10.1111%2favsc.12444&partnerID=40&md5=2c8908b8fb6e6bf785043fdc146d1a12
AB  - Questions: Tropical dry forests that experience severe disturbances (e.g., fires) often remain degraded for long time periods, during which non-native grasses and trees dominate. One barrier to native tree regeneration in degraded areas may be seed dispersal limitation. To better understand how dispersal limitation influences recovery from degradation, we tested whether the mode and rates of seed dispersal differed in degraded sites dominated either by the exotic tree Leucaena leucocephala or open areas dominated by introduced pasture grasses. We also tested whether L. leucocephala stands facilitate the recruitment of native trees by increasing their seed input compared to open grass areas. Location: Guánica Commonwealth Forest, Puerto Rico. Methods: Seed rain was measured for one year in traps located within five vegetation types that ranged in degree of forest degradation from open grass to intact native forest. Results: In open grass areas, seed rain density was similarly low for L. leucocephala and abiotically dispersed native trees (mean [95% CI] = 50.9 [15.1–171.0] vs. 34.2 [10.3–113.5] seeds m−2 year−1), whereas it was even lower for animal-dispersed native trees (0.14 [0.03–0.67] seeds m−2 year−1). Compared to open grass areas, L. leucocephala-dominated stands, even those with grass understories, had higher seed rain density of animal-dispersed trees (43.0 [12.9–143.6] seeds m−2 year−1), but not abiotically dispersed trees (20.8 [6.3–68.5] seeds m−2 year−1). Conclusions: The dominance of L. leucocephala in disturbed Caribbean dry forests does not appear to be mediated by disproportionate seed arrival in open areas compared to native tree seeds. Rather, subsequent factors such as seed and seedling survival likely favor L. leucocephala in highly degraded areas. Since L. leucocephala stands increase the seed rain of animal-dispersed native trees, retaining them in highly disturbed Caribbean dry forests may facilitate the regeneration of native forests. © 2019 International Association for Vegetation Science

TI  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit Seeds: A new potential source of sulfhydryl compounds
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082334236&doi=10.5530%2fpj.2020.12.47&partnerID=40&md5=9b5fad197bb9b423cf347f5aa8fae758
AB  - Background: Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit seeds are considered the most widely consumed legumes by ruminants. The seeds contain around 1.5 mmol of thiol/sulfhydryl compounds per 100 g of dried seeds. The contents of the sulfhydryl compounds can act like glutathione. On the other hand, the intake of a high amount of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit seeds is limited by mimosine because it can induce toxicity and death in ruminants. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine sulfhydryl compound levels in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit seeds after the mimosine removal process. Materials and methods: Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit seeds were soaked in aquadest for 24 hours and then dried at 40°C for 86 hours. The dried seeds were macerated at room temperature using 30%, 50%, 70%, and 96% (v/v) of ethanol as the solvent with a 1:10 solvent-to-solid ratio. Levels of dried extract yield were determined for sulfhydryl compounds and mimosine using a spectrophotometer. Results: The 30% ethanol extract without soaking produced the highest levels of extract yield, but 70% ethanol was the most effective solvent for extracting the maximum sulfhydryl and minimum mimosine levels. Conclusion: Ethanol solvent (70%) can be used to extract maximum levels of sulfhydryl compound and minimum levels of mimosine from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit soaked seeds. © 2020 Phcogj.Com.

TI  - Effects of slowly varying meniscus curvature on internal flows in the Cassie state
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067068127&doi=10.1017%2fjfm.2019.366&partnerID=40&md5=bb651cec4b35b45d6e494612eee17e39
AB  - The flow rate of a pressure-driven liquid through a microchannel may be enhanced by texturing its no-slip boundaries with grooves aligned with the flow. In such cases, the grooves may contain vapour and/or an inert gas and the liquid is trapped in the Cassie state, resulting in (apparent) slip. The flow-rate enhancement is of benefit to different applications including the increase of throughput of a liquid in a lab-on-a-chip, and the reduction of thermal resistance associated with liquid metal cooling of microelectronics. At any given cross-section, the meniscus takes the approximate shape of a circular arc whose curvature is determined by the pressure difference across it. Hence, it typically protrudes into the grooves near the inlet of a microchannel and is gradually drawn into the microchannel as it is traversed and the liquid pressure decreases. For sufficiently large Reynolds numbers, the variation of the meniscus shape and hence the flow geometry necessitates the inclusion of inertial (non-parallel) flow effects. We capture them for a slender microchannel, where our small parameter is the ratio of ridge pitch-to-microchannel height, and order-one Reynolds numbers. This is done by using a hybrid analytical-numerical method to resolve the nonlinear three-dimensional (3-D) problem as a sequence of two-dimensional (2-D) linear ones in the microchannel cross-section, allied with non-local conditions that determine the slowly varying pressure distribution at leading and first orders. When the pressure difference across the microchannel is constrained by the advancing contact angle of the liquid on the ridges and its surface tension (which is high for liquid metals), inertial effects can significantly reduce the flow rate for realistic parameter values. For example, when the solid fraction of the ridges is 0.1, the microchannel height-to-(half) ridge pitch ratio is 6, the Reynolds number of the flow is 1 and the small parameter is 0.1, they reduce the flow rate of a liquid metal (Galinstan) by approximately 50 %. Conversely, for sufficiently large microchannel heights, they enhance it. Physical explanations of both of these phenomena are given. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - This work, for the first time, identified the phytochemical constituents of leaves, fruits, stem barks, and wood branches extracted from the tree pruning wastes of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. grown in Egypt, showing 49, 29, 34, and 27 phytocomponents, respectively, as assayed by gas chromatograph-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis. The major components of leaves were 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester (17.7%), betulin (15.7%), lupeol (14.7%), androstan-17-one,3-ethyl-3-hydroxy-, (5à)- (12.3%), 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, methyl ester, (Z,Z,Z)- (11.6%), betamethasone (9.7%), and β-sitosterol (9.1%). The major phytocomponents of fruits were β-sitosterol (55.7%), 3beta-hydroxy-5-cholen-24-oic acid (48.7%), 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester (42.9%), lupeol (29.3%), betulin (15.8%), stigmasterol (12.8%), and campesterol (7.6%). The major phytocomponents of stem barks were 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, diisooctyl ester (65.7%), β-sitosterol (27.2%), betulin (22.1%), lupeol (21.1%), and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)-, methyl ester (8.8%). Wood branches contained β-sitosterol (60.1%), 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester (47.2%), lupeol (22.5%), campesterol (15.6%), and stigmasterol (14.1%). Most of the identified compounds have been reported to possess important biological activities, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-arthritic, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities. The four constituents of L. leucocephala were statistically independent in these phytocomponents. The phytocomponents in five solvents were mixed in describing the four constituents. These constituents of L. leucocephala are potential bioresources for phytopharmaceutics. © 2019 North Carolina State University.

TI  - Carbon storage in a silvopastoral system compared to that in a deciduous dry forest in Michoacán, Mexico
PY  - 2019

AB  -                              Livestock production in the tropics contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, so better understanding the role of silvopastoral systems (SPS) in mitigating such emissions is necessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the amounts of carbon stored in the biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) components of a Leucaena leucocephala cum Panicum maximum silvopasture system (SPS) compared to a deciduous tropical forest (DTF), and a grass monoculture (GM) in Michoacán, Mexico. The above- and below-ground biomass were measured by destructive sampling in the SPS and GM, while previously reported allometric equations were used to quantify biomass stocks in the DTF. The SOC concentration up to 30 cm was determined by dry combustion method. The SPS and DTF contained more aboveground biomass (41.8 ± 3.30 and 36.7 ± 5.72 Mg DM ha                             −1                             ) compared to GM (8.0 ± 0.76 Mg DM ha                             −1                             ). However, the SPS exhibited greater belowground biomass (16.4 ± 1.95 Mg DM ha                             −1                             ) than the other systems. The DTF had the highest SOC fraction in all depth classes with values ranging from 3.1 ± 0.07% to 3.7 ± 0.06%, respectively, compared to the other systems. The total carbon stocks in SPS was similar to DTF (120.7 ± 10.97 vs. 120.9 ± 6.38 Mg C ha                             −1                             ) but was significantly higher than GM (78.2 ± 8.41 Mg C ha                             −1                             ). In dry tropical conditions, SPS displays enormous potential for increasing biomass and soil carbon stocks compared to the GM and can thus be used as a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy in livestock production systems.                          © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The effects of forage type and season on retention time (RT) and the fatty acid (FA) profile of the rumen fluid (RF) of steers grazing a range of grasses and a legume/grass mix were evaluated. Four rumen cannulated steers (790 ± 17 kg body weight (BW) grazed individual wet season pastures (herbage mass 2600-6200 kg DM/ha of C3 ryegrass Lolium perenne and C4 grasses pangola Digitaria eriantha, signal grass Brachiaria decumbens, star grass Cynodon dactylon, kikuyu Pennisetum clandestinum, and speargrass Heteropogon contortus in both seasons, and a mixture of leucaena Leucaena leucocephala and green panic Panicum maximum in the dry season. Each grazing period consisted of at least 21 d, followed by a 3 d collection period. On d 22 CrEDTA was used to estimate RT (182 mg Cr/100 kg BW via the cannula) and RF samples were collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 28, 32 and 48 h after dosing for Cr analysis. Diet crude protein (CP) and dry matter digestibility (DMD) were estimated by faecal NIRS. Concentration of NH3N and volatile fatty acids (VFA) in RF was determined at 0, 8 and 16 h after dosing. Dry season speargrass had the lowest CP (18 and 39 g/kg DM in plucked sample (PS) and estimated by faecal NIRS, respectively) and DMD (49%), which was associated with a low NH3N (9 mg NH3N/L) and VFA concentration (70 mM) in RF, and much longer RT of Cr (20 h) than the other grasses. The RT of Cr of the other wet season grasses was similar across all forage species (8- to 11 hours). Total VFA in RF was lowest for steers grazing dry season grass, intermediate for grasses in the wet season and highest for steers grazing the legume/grass mix. Speargrass had the highest non-glucogenic:glucogenic VFA. Ryegrass had higher CP (190 g/kg DM) and DMD (68%), but steers grazing this pasture had similar NH3N concentration in RF to steers grazing kikuyu and leaucaena/grass mix (above 100 mg NH3N /L). Palmitic and stearic acid in RF were much higher than in plucked samples, but all grasses had similar total saturated FA in RF with a greater degree of saturation for ryegrass. A higher CLA c9,t11 in RF of steers grazing ryegrass most likely resulted from the linoleic content in the forage and the higher intake of ryegrass resulting in accumulation in RF. Total unsaturated FA (TUFA) content of RF was reduced markedly compared to forage samples with some small differences between species indicating an extensive biohydrogenation despite the grass type and season. It was concluded that RT of Cr in the rumen of cattle grazing wet season grasses was similar across all forage species (8 to 11 hours) and would not result in different times for biohydrogenation within the rumen. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Taiwan, farmers often apply excessive compost to ensure adequate crop yield in frequent tillage, highly weathered, and lower fertility soils. The potential of biochar (BC) to decrease soil C mineralization and improve soil nutrient availability in excessive compost application soil is promising, but under-examined. To test this, a 434-day incubation experiment of in vitro C mineralization kinetics was conducted. We added 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% (w/w) woody BC composed of lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de. Wit) to one Oxisol and two Inceptisols in Taiwan. In each treatment, 5% swine manure compost was added to serve as excessive application. The results indicated that soil type strongly influences the impact of BC addition on soil carbon mineralization potential. Respiration per unit of total organic carbon (total mineralization coefficient) of the three studied soils significantly decreased with increase in BC addition. Principal component analysis suggested that to retain more plant nutrients in addition to the effects of carbon sequestration, farmers could use locally produced biochars and composts in highly weathered and highly frequent tillage soil. Adding 0.5% woody BC to Taiwan rural soils should be reasonable and appropriate. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The present study was carried out to determine the effect of Acacia nilotica, a tropical plant rich in hydrolyzable tannins (HT), on rumen fermentation and methane (CH4) production in vitro. We used leaves and pods from A. nilotica alone and combined. The combination of HT from A. nilotica leaves and pods and condensed tannins (CT) from Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala were also evaluated to assess potential differences in biological activity between HT and CT. Four series of 24-h incubations were performed using rumen contents of 4 sheep fed a tropical grass (natural grassland based on Dichanthium spp.). A first experiment tested different levels of replacement of this tropical forage (control [CTL] without tannins) by A. nilotica leaves or pods: 0:100, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25 and 100:0. A second experiment tested the mixture of A. nilotica leaves and pods in different proportions: 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100. A third experiment tested the 50:50 combination of A. nilotica leaves or pods with C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala. Acacia nilotica pods and leaves had a high content of HT (350 and 178 g/kg DM, respectively), whereas C. calothyrsus and L. leucocephala had a high content of CT (361 and 180 g/kg DM, respectively). The inclusion of HT from A. nilotica leaves and pods decreased CH4 production dose-dependently (P < 0.01). Total replacement of the CTL by A. nilotica decreased CH4 production by 64 and 55% with leaves and pods, respectively. Pods were richer in HT than leaves, but their antimethanogenic effect did not differ (P > 0.05). Although A. nilotica leaves and pods inhibited fermentation, as indicated by the lower gas production and VFA production (P < 0.01), this effect was less pronounced than for CH4. Volatile fatty acid production decreased by 12% in leaves and by 30% in pods when compared with the CTL alone. Positive associative effect was reported for VFA, when HT-rich sources and CT-rich sources were mixed. Combining the 2 sources of HT did not show associative effects on fermentation or CH4 production (P > 0.05). Hydrolyzable tannin-rich sources were more effective in suppressing methanogenesis than CT-rich sources. Our results show that HT-rich A. nilotica leaves and pods have the potential to reduce ruminal CH4 production. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Effects of Plant Residue Decomposition on Soil N Availability, Microbial Biomass and β-Glucosidase Activity During Soil Fertility Improvement in Ghana
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072559435&doi=10.1016%2fS1002-0160%2817%2960433-8&partnerID=40&md5=ffdddfc4982aae872e3ef7fe32d11f9f
AB  - With limited use of inorganic fertilizers on smallholder farms, plant residues could be viable alternatives for soil fertility improvement. This study was conducted to determine how residue quality and decomposition of nine plant species influence soil N availability, microbial biomass, and β-glucosidase activity during soil fertility improvement. Significant differences in N concentration were found among the species, ranging from 12.2 g kg−1 in Zea mays to 39.2 g kg−1 in Baphia nitida. The C/N ratio was the highest in Z. mays (34.4), whereas lignin and polyphenol concentrations were the greatest in Acacia auriculiformis. The highest decomposition rate (0.251% per day) occurred in Tithonia diversifolia, and the lowest in A. auriculiformis, Albizia zygia, B. nitida, and Z. mays, with the half-lives of 28–56 d. Between 80% and 89% of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg were released from T. diversifolia in 7 d, compared with over 70% retention in A. auriculiformis, B. nitida, and Z. mays. The decomposition and nutrient release half-lives of Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Azadirachta indica, and Senna spectabilis were less than 14 d. Soil mineral N, microbial biomass, and β-glucosidase activity increased under all treatments, with T. diversifolia having the greatest effect. While N mineralization occurred in all of the species throughout the experiment, an initial N immobilization was recorded in the A. zygia, B. nitida, A. auriculiformis, and Z. mays treatments for up to 14 d. Decomposition and nutrient release rates, mineral N, soil microbial biomass, and β-glucosidase activity were dependent on residue quality, and P and lignin levels, the lignin/N ratio, and the (lignin + polyphenol)/N ratio had the most significant effects (P ≤ 0.05). © 2019 Soil Science Society of China

AB  - The common name for L. leucocephala are Lamtoro or Petai Cina (Indonesian), White lead tree (English) is one of the fastest growing leguminous trees in semi arid area. It is planted as a shade tree for cash crops, soil fertility improvement and a variety of other purposes. The seed oil of L. leucocephala (Lam) de Wit was investigated for its fatty acid composition and total lipid content. The main aims of the work were to determine the total lipid content and the fatty acid composition of L. leucocephala. The oil was obtained by n-hexane soxhlet extraction from the pulverized dried seeds of L. leucocephala, followed by the separation process of the oil by using silica gel column chromatography with different solvents then classified into different lipid classes (neutral lipids / NL, glycolipids/GL, and phospholipids/PL). The result showed that linoleic acid and ricinoleic acid dominated NL and GL whereas palmitic acid dominated in PL. NL, GL and PL fractions content unsaturated fatty acid 86.81%, 89.34% and 34.75% respectively. PL fraction was dominated by saturated fatty acid (65.25%). © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Methane emissions and the use of desmanthus in beef cattle production in Northern Australia
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071285297&doi=10.3390%2fani9080542&partnerID=40&md5=224186021c748bca1af4df07b716cb14
AB  - An in-depth review of Australia’s tropical beef cattle production system is presented with emphasis on the use of Desmanthus, a tropical legume, as a nutritional supplementation strategy for the abatement and mitigation of methane emissions. It also identifies current knowledge gaps in in vivo methane emissions research.: The Australian beef industry is a major contributor to the economy with an estimated annual revenue generation of over seven billion dollars. The tropical state of Queensland accounted for 48% of Australian beef and veal production in 2018. As the third biggest beef exporter in the world, Australia supplies 3% of the world’s beef exports and its agricultural sector accounts for an estimated 13.2% of its total greenhouse gas emissions. About 71% of total agricultural emissions are in the form of methane and nitrous oxide. In this review, an overview of the carbon footprint of the beef cattle production system in northern Australia is presented, with emphasis on the mitigation of greenhouse gases. The review also focuses on the tropical legume, Desmanthus, one of the more promising nutritional supplements for methane abatement and improvement of animal growth performance. Among the review’s findings is the need to select environmentally well-adapted and vigorous tropical legumes containing tannins that can persistently survive under the harsh northern Australian conditions for driving animal performance, improving meat quality and reducing methane emissions. The paper argues that the use of appropriate legumes such as Desmanthus, is a natural and preferred alternative to the use of chemicals for the abatement of methane emanating from tropical beef cattle production systems. It also highlights current gaps in knowledge and new research opportunities for in vivostudies on the impact of Desmanthus on methane emissions of supplemented tropical beef cattle. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - An alien invasive species is defined as a strange plant that propagates naturally in natural or semi-natural habitats, producing changes in the composition, structure or processes of ecosystems. In Brazil, records of the scale of the problem are deficient, although several species are already known as invasive. In Maranhão there were no studies on invasive plant species, although records and observations indicate invasions in various environments. On the island of São Luís, invasion by a number of species has become apparent, with many areas of the municipalities invaded by introduced plant species. The main objective of this study was to identify, quantify and map the invasive plant species on the island of São Luís. Five main invasive species were located and identified that have been occupying and modifying environments on the island of São Luís: 1) Leucena - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit. (Fabaceae); 2) Amendoeira - Terminalia cattapa L. (Combretaceae); 3) Fios de Ouro - Cuscuta racemosa Mart. (Convolvulaceae); 4) Saco de Velho - Calotropis procera (Aiton) W. T. Aiton (Apocynaceae); 5) Acacia Australiana - Acacia mangium Willd. (Fabaceae). These five invasive species were located and sampled at 420 sites in the four municipalities of the island. The invaded areas were sampled in relation to the invasive species and also in relation to the main accompanying species. An aerial image of the island of São Luís was used to locate plant formations and to produce a distribution map of the invasive species on the island of São Luís. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of substitution of Leucaena leucocephala (LL) leaves on in vitro rumen fermentation and methane emission in thin tailed-sheep. Rumen fluid were collected form two thin tailed-sheep fed with mixed-forages. The basal diet used in in vitro study consisted of 30% of concentrate and 70 % of forages. LL leaves substituted the forages of basal diet by 10% or 25 %. Methane production, carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia concentration, microbial protein, protozoa, volatile fatty acids (VFA) were obtained according to in vitro gas production methods followed by microbial diversity evaluation. Substitution of LL leaves reduced (P<0.05) the pH, ammonia and microbial protein regardless percentage of substitution. Protozoa counts lowered as the LL leaves increased (P<0.05). However, there were no significant effects of LL leaves substitution on VFA production, CO2 and methane emission. It can be concluded that substitution of LL leaves to forages up to 25% was not enough to reduce methane emission although some ruminal fermentation parameters were affected. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The legume-rhizobium association is widely used around the world to improve crop production via nitrogen fixation (N2-fixation). Inoculation with suitable strains is required in order to establish effective symbioses in soils. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are of biotechnological interest since they can improve plant health and soil fertility. A collection of root-nodulating bacteria was isolated from Leucaena leucocephala in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. The isolates were characterized based on their phenotypic features including growth rate, acidification in culture media, utilization of carbon sources and salinity stress tolerance. The antibiotic resistance level of selected strains was tested against five different antibiotics and showed that most of the strains were sensitive to kanamycin (30 µg) but resistant to ampicillin (10 µg) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1.25/23.75 μg). Isolates 40a and 74 produced substantial amounts of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and other isolates produced siderophores. These isolates were used to verify their nodulation capacity on L. leucocephala. The 16S rRNA gene products were sequenced to determine the identity and phylogenetic diversity of the isolates, placing them in the genera Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium (syn. Ensifer). Based on this study, we propose that isolates Sinorhizobium (40a) and Rhizobium (74) are potential candidates to be used as inoculants to enhance symbioses and N2-fixation using Leucaena leucocephala in karst soils. © 2020, Chiang Mai University.

TI  - Promotion of plant growth in soils degraded by urban mining through the addition of construction and demolition waste
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065329385&doi=10.5276%2fJSWTM.2019.13&partnerID=40&md5=bb86669c8fa9e3d9378c3a5a879bfba5
AB  - Construction and demolition processes produce approximately 50% of all urban waste. The production of construction and demolition waste (CDW) and the consumption of raw materials have increased in order to satisfy the demand generated by a demographic explosion in cities. As a result, the extraction of raw materials has become an unsustainable activity that utilizes approximately 50% of non-renewable natural resources. This generates eco-systemic changes that can alter the biological equilibrium; the most representative changes are the loss of soil and vegetation, which hinder the implementation of environmental services such as landscaping, recreation, water retention, and agricultural activities, among others. For this reason, it is necessary to generate new options that will permit the recycling of CDW. One option is to use this waste as a source of nutrients for degraded soils, which would make it possible to mitigate the environmental impacts caused by both mining and this solid waste. This study evaluated the effect of adding construction and demolition waste to urban soils degraded by the clay extraction process on the establishment of the plant species Leucaena leucocephala. The results showed that the addition of CDW modified the soil pH and improved nutrient availability. After planting, it was found that the leaf phosphorus concentration in the treatment without waste (control) was of 0.0170 (g Kg-1), while in the treatment with waste it was of 0.308 (g Kg-1), the height and diameter were double the height and diameter for the control, the aerial dry mass was 2.6 times greater than the control and the total phosphorus was 1.4 times greater than the control. These results are important because they confirm that CDW can be used in restoration programs for soils degraded by mining. © 2019 Widener University School of Civil Engineering. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coagulation is a well-known technology applied in water and wastewater treatment. Inorganic salts, such as alum, ferrous sulfate, and polyaluminum chloride, are usually used. It is widely known that utilization of these inorganic coagulants poses several disadvantages, such as high coagulant cost and high sludge volume that increase water treatment expenses. The use of alum also poses health risk to human as it may cause degenerative diseases. In order to minimize these disadvantages, the use of various coagulants from natural resources has been recently proposed. In this research, study was performed on the extraction and use of a potential natural coagulant (Leucaena leucocephala) seed kernel as natural coagulant. Leucaena seed kernel was extracted at various NaCl concentrations (0–5 mol L−1). Extract with highest protein content obtained at NaCl concentration of 3 mol L−1 was further used to treat a synthetic wastewater model substance (Congo red solution) at various pH (2–10) and dosage (2–40 mL L−1). This natural coagulant successfully removed 99.9% of the color at pH 3 and dosage 10 mL L−1, with only half sludge volume discharged when compared to alum. The result suggests that leucaena is a promising natural coagulant for water and wastewater treatment. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - This study aims to investigate effect of supplementation of Leucaena leucocephala leaf in the ration on milk production and composition of Friesian Holstein cow. The experiment was performed using 3 treatments namely P0 (basal ration, composed of 40% concentrates + 60% forage of total dry matter), while P1 and P2 contained basal ration and Leucaena Leucocephala leaf, supplemented with 10 and 20% of total forage dry matter (DM), respectively. The experiment was performed for 60 days, with 12 lactation cows at body weight average 400-450 kg. Cows were at 3 to 4 months of lactation stage. Parameters observed were milk production (L/d) and milk composition namely percentage of protein, fat and lactose. Results showed that P2 significantly increased milk production compared to P1 and P0, while in milk composition in P1 and P2 were significantly higher compared to control. The average of protein, fat and lactose of milk in P0 were 2.87%, 4.73% and 4.44%, P1 were 2.99%, 3.29% and 4.86%, P3 4.91%, 4.59% and 4.60%, respectively. It is concluded that supplementation of Leucaena Leucocephala leaf at 10 and 20% improve milk composition, but only at 20% supplementation the milk production was increase. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Loss of NiFQ leads to accumulation of porphyrins and altered metal-homeostasis in nitrogen-fixing symbioses
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060527247&doi=10.1094%2fMPMI-07-18-0188-R&partnerID=40&md5=4d187ea97f96e2d926289ec096b70fe1
AB  - Symbiotic nitrogen fixation between legumes and rhizobia involves a coordinated expression of many plant and bacterial genes as well as finely tuned metabolic activities of micro- and macrosymbionts. In spite of such complex interactions, symbiotic proficiency remains a resilient process, with host plants apparently capable of compensating for some deficiencies in rhizobia. What controls nodule homeostasis is still poorly understood and probably varies between plant species. In this respect, the promiscuous Sinorhizobium (Ensifer) fredii strain NGR234 has become a model to assess the relative contribution of single gene products to many symbioses. Here, we describe how a deletion in nifQ of NGR234 (strain NGRDnifQ) makes nodules of Vigna unguiculata, V. radiata, and Macroptilium atropurpureum but not of the mimisoid tree Leucaena leucocephala, purple-red. This peculiar dark-nodule phenotype did not necessarily correlate with a decreased proficiency of NGRDnifQ but coincided with a 20-fold or more accumulation of coproporphyrin III and uroporphyrin III in V. unguiculata nodules. Porphyrin accumulation was not restricted to plant cells infected with bacteroids but also extended to the nodule cortex. Nodule metal-homeostasis was altered but not sufficiently to prevent assembly and functioning of nitrogenase. Although the role of NifQ in donating molybdenum during assembly of nitrogenase cofactor FeMo-co makes it essential in free-living diazotrophs, our results highlight the dispensability of NifQ in many legume species. © 2019 The American Phytopathological Society.

AB  - Objectives: To know the forage habits related to pollen collected by Nannotrigona mellaria in two urban environments of Valle del Cauca. Scope: Inventory of plant species mostly used by this group of bees as a source of pollen for their diet. Methodology: Corbicular pollen of worker bees was collected in four nests: three at Universidad del Valle (Cali, Colombia) and one at Universidad Nacional, Palmira Campus during a period of 24 weeks between June 2013 and January 2014. In the same way, pollen was collected from plant species near the nesting site and the comparison was made. A grouping analysis was carried out to determine similarity between the diets and a Dufrene and Legendre's species indicator analysis was performed to determine the type of pollen related to each beehive. Main results: The species collects pollen from 29 plant families and 73 different species, being the species of the Fabaceae family the most represented among the collected material (29% of the records) and Leucaena leucocephala the most frequent species (18% of the records). Fourteen species with a significant indicator value were reported (p <0.05), being the beehive at Universidad Nacional the one that presented a greater number (seven in total). Conclusions: The N. mellaria species collects pollen from a wide variety of plants in the study sites and therefore it has great potential as a pollinator in urban areas. In addition, this species has preference in the collection of leguminous plants pollen, possibly due to their abundance in the study area and their abundant flowering visually appealing to the Apidae and because they can offer nectar as well as pollen. © 2019, Universidad de Caldas.

AB  - Adding biochar to excessive compost amendments may affect compost mineralization rate and nitrogen (N) availability. The objective of this 371-day incubation study was to evaluate the effects of four proportions of woody biochar (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%) from lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de. Wit) biochar produced at 750 ◦C through dynamic mineral N and N mineralization rates in three rural soils (one Oxisol and two Inceptisols). In each treatment, 5% poultry–livestock manure compost was added to serve as an excessive application. The results indicated that the biochar decreased available total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) (NO3 −-N+NH4 +-N) by on average 6%, 9% and 19% for 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0% treatments, respectively. The soil type strongly influenced the impact of the biochar addition on the soil nitrogen mineralization potential, especially the soil pH and clay content. This study showed that the co-application of biochar and excessive compost benefited the agricultural soils by improving NO3 −-N retention in agroecosystems. The application of biochar to these soils to combine it with excessive compost appeared to be an effective method of utilizing these soil amendments, as it diminished the net N mineralization potential and reduced the nitrate loss of the excessive added compost. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The need to investigate species used in forest exploitation and the disposal of their residues and byproducts motivated the evaluation in a greenhouse of the effect of wood vinegar (WV) on seed germination and seedling growth of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) in two substrates. The studied factors were WV concentrations in irrigation water (0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2 and 1.6%) and substrate (sand or vermiculite). Each treatment had four repetitions of 30 seeds in plastic trays. The variables evaluated up to 27 days after sowing were: emergence percentage, emergence speed index, percentage of ungerminated seeds, total seedling length, shoot height, shoot and root dry weight. The concentrations of wood vinegar used in this study had an inhibitory effect on the germination, emergence and initial development of leucaena at all studied concentrations. A large decrease in percentage and speed of germination of leucaena was observed, mainly in the sand substrate. The more intense effect on the germination stage than in later stages of development was caused by substances contained in WV, such as acetic acid, furfural and methanol. The germination, emergence and initial growth of leucaena were less impaired when the substrate was vermiculite. For effective control of leucaena it is necessary to test higher concentrations of wood vinegar. © 2020, University of Zagreb. All rights reserved.

TI  - Leucaena leucocephala extract has estrogenic and antiestrogenic actions on female rat reproduction

AB  - Leucaena feed has been reported to cause disruptive effects on livestock reproduction, such as low calving percentages in cows, abortion in female goats and pigs, dead fetuses and fetal resorption in pregnant rats. In this study, the effects of Leucaena on different female reproductive variables were analyzed in two different reproductive conditions: gonadally intact and ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. Leucaena (LEU) was administered to females in both experimental conditions for 30 consecutive days. The effects of the legume extract were compared with those of Daidzein (DAI), a phytoestrogen, and of the female hormone estradiol (E2). In intact females, LEU disrupted the estrous cycle and female sexual behavior, decreased the number of follicles and corpora lutea, increased uterine and vaginal epithelium in proestrus and diestrus periods, increased uterine and vaginal relative weights during diestrus, and decreased serum progesterone during proestrus. All these effects were similar to those of DAI but lower than E2-induced effects. In OVX females, LEU decreased body weight, induced lordosis, stimulated vaginal epithelium cornification, increased vaginal weight, and augmented vaginal epithelium thickness. Again, these effects were similar to the effects of DAI and lower than the effects observed with E2. These results indicate that, in gonadally intact females, LEU can produce antiestrogenic effects in sexual behavior but estrogenic effects on uterine and vaginal weight and epithelia, without modifying serum levels of E2. In OVX females, in total absence of endogenous E2, LEU induced estrogenic effects on vaginal weight and epithelia, as well as on sexual behavior. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  -                              A screening study was conducted to investigate the nutrient composition, anti-nutritional factors, in vitro gas (GP) and methane (CH                             4                             ) production of leaves and whole pods in tropical multipurpose trees (MPTs). The results indicated that the highest CP (296 g/kg DM) was found in Moringa stenopetala leaves followed by Acacia abysinica (277 g/kg DM), Millettia ferruginea (264 g/kg DM), Prosopis juliflora (261 g/kg DM) and Moringa oleifera (256 g/kg DM). In whole pods, the CP ranged from 172 in M. ferruginea to 191 g/kg DM in M. stenopetala. The starch in M. stenopetala, P. juliflora and Chamaecytisus palmensis leaves was 44.2, 28.8 and 24.4 g/kg DM, respectively. Leaves of Cajanus cajan had the highest concentrations of valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, lysine and threonine. The highest concentration of total and tannin phenols were observed in leaves of A. nilotica while P. juliflora leaves had the lowest. Leaves of M. oleifera had higher total phenols and soluble condensed tannins than those of M. stenopetala. The in vitro GP were (P < 0.05) higher in leaves of Moringa species, Sesbania sesban, C. palmensis and Leucaena leucocephala than other MPTs. The CH                             4                              production in A. nilotica, P. juliflora and C. cajan leaves was 1.05, −1.16 and 1.79 ml/200 mg DM, respectively and were lower (P < 0.05) than other MPTs. The lowest CH                             4                              was observed in M. ferruginea pods (2.64 ml/200 mg DM) being (P < 0.05) different from other species. In conclusion, leaves of A. nilotica, P. juliflora, C. cajan and pods of M. ferruginea were identified as potential candidates in mitigating CH                             4                              production and might be used as feed additives or supplementary feed for grazing ruminants.                          © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Soil contamination by spent engine oil is a growing concern in many countries, especially in some less developed countries such as Nigeria. Greenhouse experiment was conducted for 4 months using Leucaena leucocephala to determine its effect on the nutrients (N, P, K, organic carbon) and heavy metals (Zn, Ni, Pb, Cu) of soil polluted with spent engine oil [5% (w/v)]. Soil without spent engine oil was used as control. Bioaccumulation of the nutrients and heavy metals in Leucaena leucocephala was also determined. Reductions in the nutrients were observed in the soils during the first to third months of bioremediation. However, in the fourth month, 33.33% and 16.67% increase in nitrogen were recorded in the control and polluted soils, respectively. Reduction in Zn, Ni, Pb, and Cu was 41%, 48.39%, 61.60%, and 52.72%, respectively, in the polluted soil, and bioaccumulation of Zn, Ni, Pb, and Cu in Leucaena leucocephala planted in the polluted soil increased by 73.41%, 85.46%, 3366.04%, and 125.53% in the plant biomass. This chapter has shown that Leucaena leucocephala is effective in bioremediation of heavy metals in spent engine oil-polluted soil. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - The diversity of macro-invertebrates is related to the state of disturbance of the soil, caused mainly by the land-use change for agricultural activities. A strategy for the conservation of these organisms is the implementation of diversified production systems such as silvopastoral systems. However, in the Southeast of Mexico, information is still limited. The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the richness, abundance and composi­tion of macro-invertebrates in four contrasting agro-ecosystems: Two silvopastoral systems made of Leucaena leucocephala and associated pastures (i.e. Panicum maximum cv mombaza and Cynodon plectostachyus), a pasture of Brachiaria brizantha with scattered trees in low density and, a medium-statured tropical dry forest. In each system, an area of one hectare was delimited and a transect of 50 m in length was established in which five pit-fall traps were placed every 10 m. The sampling was carried out in February and May of 2018 and in each month five collections were made with five-day intervals. A total of 1 737 organisms belonging to 10 orders of the class Insecta and one of the class Gastropoda were collected. The medium-statured tropical dry forest (923 individuals) and the silvopastoral systems of L. leucocephala with C. Plectostachyus (354 individuals) show the highest abundance of macro-invertebrates. The most abundant genera were: Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Aracninae and Orthoptera. The higher macro-invertebrate diversity was found in the silvopastoral systems of L. leucocephala with P. maximum (H ‘= 1.58) and L. leucocephala with C. plectostachyus (H’ = 1.44). The results show that livestock systems managed with woody components (trees or shrubs) are home of an important abun­dance and richness of macro-invertebrates, compared to tropical forests. This diversity of macro-invertebrates may contribute to the integrity and functionality of the agro-ecosystems. © 2019, Universidad de Costa Rica. All rights reserved.

AB  -                              Abstract: Phytomediated synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles has become a key research area in nanotechnology due to its wide applicability in various biomedical fields. The present work explores the biosynthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) using Leucaena leucocephala leaf extract. The synthesised ZnO-NPs were characterised by ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) studies. Biosynthesised ZnO-NPs are found to have wurtzite hexagonal structure with particles distributed in the range of 50–200 nm as confirmed by TEM studies. The anticancer activity of ZnO-NPs against MCF-7 (breast cancer) and PC-3 (human prostate cancer) cell lines was evaluated using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. From the assay, biosynthesised ZnO-NPs have better cytotoxic activity on PC-3 cell lines than MCF-7 cell lines. The in vitro cytotoxicity studies of biosynthesised ZnO-NPs against Dalton lymphoma ascites (DLA) cells reveal better antitumor activity of 92% inhibition with concentration of 200 µg·ml                             −1                              of ZnO-NPs, and as the concentration increases, the anticancer efficiency as well increases, and also, it has excellent photocatalytic activity to degrade crystal violet dye in aqueous solution after irradiation of 90 min. The result suggests that the green synthesis of ZnO-NPs could be easily recovered and reused several times without any significant loss of the catalytic activity. The advantage of this technique lies in its low cost, easily climbable and non-use of toxic agents.

AB  - Optimization of oil extraction from Leucaena leucocephala seeds (LLS) using solvent method was studied. 2k factorial technique was employed for optimization of extraction process variables, which include particle size, extraction temperature, extraction time and solvent/solid ratio. Good agreements were achieved between the predicted and experimental values of oil extraction yield (R2=0.9974andAdj-R2=0.9922). Optimization results showed that maximum oil extraction efficiency was achieved under the optimized factor combination of ≤ 0.6 mm particle size, 50 °C extraction temperature, 2 h extraction time and 10:1 v/w solvent/solid ratio. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Mimosine accumulation in Leucaena leucocephala in response to stress signaling molecules and acute UV exposure

AB  - Mimosine is a non-protein amino acid of Fabaceae, such as Leucaena spp. and Mimosa spp. Several relevant biological activities have been described for this molecule, including cell cycle blocker, anticancer, antifungal, antimicrobial, herbivore deterrent and allelopathic activities, raising increased economic interest in its production. In addition, information on mimosine dynamics in planta remains limited. In order to address this topic and propose strategies to increase mimosine production aiming at economic uses, the effects of several stress-related elicitors of secondary metabolism and UV acute exposure were examined on mimosine accumulation in growth room-cultivated seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala spp. glabrata. Mimosine concentration was not significantly affected by 10 ppm salicylic acid (SA) treatment, but increased in roots and shoots of seedlings treated with 84 ppm jasmonic acid (JA) and 10 ppm Ethephon (an ethylene-releasing compound), and in shoots treated with UV-C radiation. Quantification of mimosine amidohydrolase (mimosinase) gene expression showed that ethephon yielded variable effect over time, whereas JA and UV-C did not show significant impact. Considering the strong induction of mimosine accumulation by acute UV-C exposure, additional in situ ROS localization, as well as in vitro antioxidant assays were performed, suggesting that, akin to several secondary metabolites, mimosine may be involved in general oxidative stress modulation, acting as a hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion quencher. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  -                              Activated carbons (ACs) were prepared from Leucaena leucocephala biomass. This is an agricultural solid waste by-product, as well as easily grown species available abundantly in Southeast Asia. In this work, activated carbon derived from Leucaena leucocephala biomass was prepared for sequestration of cadmium from aqueous solutions. The activated carbon was produced by a NaOH chemical activation process using NaOH:char ratios (w/w) of 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 at 800 °C. The activated carbon’s BET surface areas were determined as 185, 595, and 776 m                             2                              g                             −1                              for the NaOH:char ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1, respectively. At initial concentration of 30 mg/l, maximum cadmium adsorption was achieved within 40 min. The adsorbent also showed good sorption of cadmium at pH 7.0 with solution temperature of 30 °C. Isothermic studies showed the adsorption process best fitted to Langmuir isotherm which indicates monolayer adsorption had happened while kinetic studies showed physisorption process was favorable, determined by pseudo-first order kinetic model. Maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 70.423 mg/g for NaOH:char ratios of 3:1.                          © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - An endophytic diaporthe apiculatum produces monoterpenes with inhibitory activity against phytopathogenic fungi
PY  - 2019

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from endophytic fungi are becoming a potential antibiotic resource. The inhibitive effects of VOCs produced by an endophytic fungus in Leucaena leucocephala were investigated on plant pathogens in this study. Using standard morphological methods and multigene phylogeny, the fungus was identified as Diaporthe apiculatum strain FPYF 3052. Utilizing a two-compartment Petri plate bioassay method, the VOCs from this fungus showed bioactivity ranging from 23.8% to 66.7% inhibition on eight plant pathogens within 24 hours. The SPME-GC/MS technique identified fifteen volatile compounds with dominant terpenoids γ-terpinene (39.8%), α-terpinene (17.2%), and (-)-4-terpineol (8.4%) from the VOCs. Commercial α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, and (-)-4-terpineol demonstrated inhibition on the tested pathogens at concentrations from 0.2 to 1.0 µl/ml within 72 h in the bioassay system. The inhibition rates were from 28% to 100% percent using 1.0 µl/ml within 48 h. (-)-4-Terpineol was the most active of the terpenoids causing up to 100% inhibition. The data illustrate that these monoterpenes play an important role in the inhibitive bioactivity of the VOCs of D. apiculatum FPYF 3052. Most importantly, (-)-4-terpineol is now for the first time, reported to have capability of strong antifungal activity and could be developed as an antibiotic substance. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Leguminous alley cropping improves the production, nutrition, and yield of forage sorghum
PY  - 2019

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the growth, production, and leaf contents of macronutrients, as well as the yield of forage sorghum cultivated on the alleys of Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp.) and Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) in the presence and absence of mineral fertilization. The experiment was conducted in two different periods: During the 2016/2017 double crop (cultivation carried out at the end of the crop cycle) and during the 2017/2018 crop (cultivation carried out at the beginning of the crop cycle). A randomized block design, in which the first factor refers to cultivation systems (single sorghum, sorghum cultivated in Gliricidia alleys, and sorghum cultivated in Leucaena alleys) and the second factor refers to mineral fertilization (presence and absence of fertilization), in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement was used. The leguminous plants were cut, and the residues were deposited in the alleys. The cultivation in alleys without mineral fertilization increased total forage biomass when compared to the single crop cultivation. Cultivation in Leucaena alleys showed a higher leaf content of nitrogen (N) when compared to the single crop, both in the presence and absence of mineral fertilization. In the double crop, sorghum cultivated in Leucaena alleys without fertilization presented a higher forage yield (up to 67%) when compared to the single crop system. However, there was no difference in yield when mineral fertilization was applied to the treatments. Overall, the alley crops were able to increase the morphological (plant height (PH), stem diameter (SD), panicle diameter (PD), and panicle length (PL) and yield (leaf dry mass (LDM), stem dry mass (SDM), total green mass (TGM), and total dry mass TDM) variables of the crop, improving the productivity of forage sorghum. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Allelopathic potential of rain leachates from Eucalyptus urophylla on four tree species
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046681070&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-018-0240-8&partnerID=40&md5=d978bb4f3357930a26319a66dd72d527
AB  - Allelopathy is considered a major cause of biodiversity reduction in Eucalyptus plantations. Eucalyptus can produce allelochemicals through various ways, such as volatilization and root exudation. However, there are few studies of the roles of rain leachates in mediating eucalyptus allelopathy. Thus, we conducted a greenhouse experiment to assess the allelopathic effects of rain leachates from Eucalyptus urophylla on some vital traits of three native (Leucaena leucocephala, Pterospermum lanceaefolium, and Schefflera octophylla) and one introduced (Albizia lebbeck) tree species. We compared the effects of rain leachates from E. urophylla foliage, litter, and foliage + litter. To identify specific chemicals from rain leachates that can mediate allelopathy, we used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) to isolate and determine allelochemicals from leachates. The results showed that litter leachates and foliage + litter leachates significantly inhibited seed germination of L. leucocephala, P. lanceaefolium, and S. octophylla. The inhibitory effects on seed germination of litter leachates alone were relatively stronger than that of foliage + litter leachates; however, foliage leachates alone did not inhibit seed germination and seedling survival, except for P. lanceaefolium. We also did not find significant negative effects of rain leachates on biomass, root length, and shoot length of the target species; foliage + litter and foliage leachates even increased fresh weight and dry weight of L. leucocephala and S. octophylla, respectively. Seedling survivorship was lower under the leachate treatments for all the target species except A. lebbeck. GC–MS analysis suggested that phenol acids, ester, alkanes, and alcohol are the main components in leachates. The diversity and content of allelochemical components detected in litter leachates and foliage + litter leachates were much higher than foliage leachates. We concluded that rain leachates from E. urophylla primarily cast a negative impact on seed germination and seedling survival of the receptor species, and allelopathy of E urophylla may be partly responsible for the loss of understory species. Different sources of rain leachates vary significantly in their inhibitory effects, and rain leachates from litter are likely to be an important pathway of allelopathy. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare in vitro digestibility of diet containing Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) at blooming stage in cow and dromedary camel. The experimental diets were including 0, 25, 50 and 100% of Subabul branches as a replacement of Alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The ingredients of diets were Alfalfa, wheat straw, corn silage, corn, barely, bran and mineral-vitamin supplement by a ratio of concentrate and forage at 50:50. Rumen fluid was taken from fistulated cow and dromedary camels and in vitro digestibility of experimental diets was determined. The obtained data were analyzed in a split plot design. The lowest digestibility of dry matter in dromedary camel (73.1%) and cattle (71.9%) was found in the treatment containing 100% of Subabul (p < 0.05). But digestibility of natural detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) of diets containing different levels of Subabul instead of Alfalfa were not different in cow and camel (p > 0.05). Digestibility of NDF and ADF in the treatment containing 100% Subabul in the cattle were 70.36 and 68.21%, respectively, and in the dromedary camel were 71.19% and 69.02%, respectively (p < 0.05). Treatments containing 50 and 100 % Subabul (74.38 and 70.37%) had the lowest dry matter digestibility (p < 0.05). The ADF digestibility in treatments containing 50 and 100% Subabul in compared with control treatment was 72.4 and 67.6 vs 73.5 %, respectively, and NDF digestibility was 72.45, 69.65 and 75.33 % in treatments containing 50 and 100% Subabul and control, respectively (p < 0.05). As per the result, the digestibility of DM, NDF and ADF of Subabul were not different between cow and dromedary camel (p > 0.05).The result of these experiments showed that in vitro digestibility of 50 % Subabul instead of Alfalfa in diet of cow and camel was better than other levels, therefore it can be used in cow and dromedary camel nutrition. © 2019 Exploratory Animal and Medical Research.

AB  - The waste seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (LLS) used in this study were unused residues obtained after oil and polysaccharides extraction. The microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was isolated from LLS by acid treatment. MCC produced was, then, further converted to glucose by using sulphuric acid at 121 °C by varying the acid concentration and reaction time. The sugar composition was analyzed by using the phenol-sulfuric acid method and pre-column derivatization HPLC technique. The yield of glucose ranging from 70-85% could be obtained from MCC hydrolyzates, depending on the hydrolysis factors, which corresponding to around 57-75% of the percentage conversion of MCC to glucose. Cellulose isolated from LLS was, therefore, potentially suitable to be utilized in liquid biofuels and other value-added chemicals such as bioethanol, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural(HMF), and levulinic acid. © 2019 Penerbit UTM Press.

UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064881774&doi=10.1017%2fjfm.2019.177&partnerID=40&md5=8df525cc58f938c9bd8c297cc9da80f5
AB  - An important class of canonical problems that is employed in quantifying the slipperiness of microstructured superhydrophobic surfaces is concerned with the calculation of the hydrodynamic loads on adjacent solid bodies whose size is large relative to the microstructure period. The effect of superhydrophobicity is most pronounced when the latter period is comparable to the separation between the solid probe and the superhydrophobic surface. We address the above distinguished limit, considering a simple configuration where the superhydrophobic surface is formed by a periodically grooved array, in which air bubbles are trapped in a Cassie state, and the solid body is an infinite cylinder. In the present part, we consider the case where the grooves are aligned perpendicular to the cylinder and allow for three modes of rigid-body motion: rectilinear motion perpendicular to the surface; rectilinear motion parallel to the surface, in the groove direction; and angular rotation about the cylinder axis. In this scenario, the flow is periodic in the direction parallel to the axis. Averaging over the small-scale periodicity yields a modified lubrication description where the small-scale details are encapsulated in two auxiliary two-dimensional cell problems which respectively describe pressure- and boundary-driven longitudinal flow through an asymmetric rectangular domain, bounded by a compound surface from the bottom and a no-slip surface from the top. Once the integral flux and averaged shear stress associated with each of these cell problems are calculated as a function of the slowly varying cell geometry, the hydrodynamic loads experienced by the cylinder are provided as quadratures of nonlinear functions of the latter distributions over a continuous sequence of cells. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Acute effect of purified mimosine (MiMo) extracted from Leucaena leucocephala on testicular histopathology has been documented with seminal vesicle (SV) atrophy. Since protein phosphorylation and seminal secretions play important roles in sperm physiology, this study aimed to study the alteration of substances including tyrosine phosphorylated (TyrPho) proteins in seminal vesicle treated with MiMo. Male mice were divided into a control and experimental groups treated with purified MiMo at 3 doses of 15, 30, and 60 mg/KgBW, respectively for 35 consecutive days. The morphology and weights of SV were compared among groups. The levels of magnesium and fructosamine in SV fluid were assayed. The profiles of equally SV total proteins were compared using SDS-PAGE. The expression of seminal TyrPho proteins was detected by western blotting. Recent results showed the decreased weights of SV in MiMo treated mice compared to control. However MiMo in all doses did not affect the levels of magnesium and fructosamine in SV fluid. The SV protein expression of 130 and 55 kDas was obviously decreased in a high dose MiMo. In dose-dependent response, the expressions of 72 and 55 kDas TyrPho proteins of SV were increased. In conclusion, MiMo could affect SV morphological size and protein secretions especially TyrPho proteins. © 2019, Universidad de la Frontera. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to explore the differences and variation of the water storage capacity of soil and shear performance between the sedimentation zone in front of and ridge behind hedgerows on Purple Soil Slopping Farmland. This study set 10° Leucaena leucocephala hedgerows (plot L10), 10° Vetiveria zizanioides hedgerows (plot V10), and 15° V. zizanioides hedgerows (plot V15), from the Soil and Water Conservation Experimental Station in Suining, Sichuan. There were sedimentation zones in front of the hedgerows on the up, middle, and down slopes and a ridge behind the hedgerows on the up and middle slopes at each plot. We collected samples of arable soil from these zones to a 30 cm depth. Some basic physical properties and shear strength of soil were measured, and soil total storage capacity, flood detention storage, internal friction angle p, and cohesion c were calculated. The results showed that: (1) in the same plots, the water storage capacity of the sedimentation zone in front of the hedgerows was better than that of the ridges behind the corresponding hedgerows, and that the sedimentation zone had a higher natural water content by 6.52% —12.13%; (2) soil disturbance and shear resistance of the ridges behind the hedgerows were higher than that of the sedimentation zone in front of the corresponding hedgerows. The soil non-capillary porosity of ridges behind the hedgerows was significantly higher than that of the sedimentation zone in front of the hedgerows by 5.61%—57.70%; (3) in the same plot, the water storage capacity in the sedimentation zone in front of the hedgerows showed the following order: down slope > middle > up slope, and that of the ridge behind hedgerows was up > middle slope. This trend was obvious in plot V15; the soil total storage capacity and flood detention storage of the sedimentation zone in front of the hedgerows on the down slope were 1.04 times and 1.03 times higher than those of the up slope, respectively, and those of the ridge behind the hedgerows on the up slope were all 1.02 times higher than that of the middle slope; (4) in the same plot, the internal friction angle p, cohesion c, and shear strength in the sedimentation zone in front of the hedgerows were in the order of up > middle > down slope, and that on the ridge behind the hedgerows were up > middle slope. This was evident in plot V10, where the internal friction angle p, cohesion c, and shear strength of the sedimentation zone in front of the hedgerows on the up slope were 1.06, 1. 09, and 1.05 times greater than those of the down slope, respectively. However, those of the ridge behind the hedgerows on the up slope were all 1.04 times higher than that of the middle slope; (5) the rainy season had no significant effect on soil disturbance, water storage capacity, and shear performance for both the sedimentation zone in front of and ridge behind the hedgerows. © 2020 Science Press.

TI  - Fractal dimensions of trapped sediment particle size distribution can reveal sediment retention ability of common plants in a dry-hot valley

AB  - Aboveground plant parts can trap moving sediment on slopes during concentrated water runoff, resulting in the formation of sediment mounds around plants. Plant morphological and functional traits may influence these sediment trapping patterns. Characterizing the sediment trapping abilities of common plants is of great interest when selecting appropriate plant species for erosion control. Predicting plant sediment trapping abilities using fractal dimensions of sediment particle size distribution could enhance the management and restoration of degraded lands with declining vegetation coverage in dry-hot valleys. Using flume experiments, we studied sediment retention abilities in six common plant species: the tree species Leucaena leucocephala and Melia azedarach; the shrub species Dodonaea viscose and Coriaria sinica; and the graminoids Heteropogon contortus and Eulaliopsis binate. Sediment trapping mass was measured at two ages (three-month-old and one-year-old seedlings). The particle size distribution of trapped sediment was determined using a laser particle size analyzer. The fractal characterizations (singular- and multi-fractal dimensions) of sediment particle size distribution were calculated using the fractal scale theory. Statistical analyses were performed to compare sediment trapping mass and the fractal characterizations in the six species at the two ages. C. sinica had the highest relative trapped sediment at both ages. Trapped sediment mass of one-year-old seedlings were significantly related to the singular fractal dimension (D), capacity dimension (D0), entropy dimension (D1), and correlation dimension (D2) of trapped sediment particle size distribution. However, trapped sediment mass of three-month-old seedlings was only related to D, while that combining the data in both ages had significant correlations with D and D0. Our results suggest that fractal dimension of sediment particle size distribution can predict sediment mass trapped by plants. Such knowledge may help maximize sediment trapping through appropriate species selection and provide useful information for slope erosion control. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Molecular cloning of putative chloroplastic cysteine synthase in Leucaena leucocephala

AB  - Cysteine biosynthesis is directed by the successive commitments of serine acetyltransferase, and O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OASTL) compounds, which subsequently frame the decameric cysteine synthase complex. The isoforms of OASTL are found in three compartments of the cell: the cytosol, plastid, and mitochondria. In this investigation, we first isolated putative chloroplastic OASTL (Ch-OASTL) from Leucaena leucocephala, and the Ch-OASTL was then expressed in BL21-competent Escherichia coli. The putative Ch-OASTL cDNA clone had 1,543 base pairs with 391 amino acids in its open reading frame and a molecular weight of 41.54 kDa. The purified protein product exhibited cysteine synthesis ability, but not mimosine synthesis activity. However, they both make the common α-aminoacrylate intermediate in their first half reaction scheme with the conventional substrate O-acetyl serine (OAS). Hence, we considered putative Ch-OASTL a cysteine-specific enzyme. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the optimum pH for cysteine synthesis was 7.0, and the optimum temperature was 40 °C. In the cysteine synthesis assay, the Km and kcat values were 838 ± 26 µM and 72.83 s−1 for OAS, respectively, and 60 ± 2 µM and 2.43 s−1 for Na2S, respectively. We can infer that putative Ch-OASTL regulatory role is considered a sensor for sulfur constraint conditions, and it acts as a forerunner of various metabolic compound molecules. © 2019, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Biochar enhancement of facilitation effects in agroforestry: early growth and physiological responses in a maize-leucaena model system
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058371421&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-018-0336-1&partnerID=40&md5=3933126806e4d93740182fdc274b804c
AB  - Biochar, or pyrolyzed organic matter intended for use as a soil amendment, has a variety of properties of interest from the perspective of agroforestry, in particular its potential to increase soil C sequestration and enhance yields by increased retention of soil mineral nutrients. Nitrogen-fixing legumes commonly show large growth responses to biochar, and we hypothesized that combinations of legumes and non-legumes would show increased enhancement of yields in mixture due to enhanced facilitation related to increased nutrient retention. This hypothesis was tested in a glasshouse pot trial involving the leguminous tree leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), and maize (Zea mays) grown for 120 days in mixture and monoculture in both an unamended soil and soil amended with a slow-pyrolysis coconut husk biochar at 10 t/ha. Responses were quantified in terms of biomass production and partitioning, leaf-level gas-exchange, leaf chlorophyll content, and (for leucaena) root nodule formation. Consistent with predictions, leucaena showed more pronounced growth and physiological responses to biochar than did maize. The system also showed increased total biomass yields relative to monocultures in the two-species mixtures with biochar (relative yield in mixture [RYM] = 1.69; 95% CI 1.41–1.81), but not in the control treatment (RYM = 1.25; 95% CI 0.93–1.76), and positive effects of biochar on yield were generally greater for both species when grown in mixture. Growth responses to biochar were most pronounced for stem and root biomass, and growth responses were consistent with changes in leaf-level photosynthesis and chlorophyll content. In addition, biochar had large effects on biomass partitioning, enhancing stem allocation in both species. Our results suggest that biochar additions may augment facilitative interactions in agroforestry and intercropped systems on acidic, nutrient-deficient soils by enhancing system nutrient retention. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Responses of the seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus and its recruited parasitoids to resource availability – Implications for the biological control of Leucaena leucocephala in South Africa
PY  - 2019

AB  - Introduced from Central America for agroforestry, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit (Fabaceae) has become invasive in several tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The seed beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was released in South Africa in 1999 to curb the plant's high seed production. Monthly sampling was conducted during 2011/2012 at four sites in KwaZulu-Natal Province to determine the reproductive phenology of L. leucocephala populations, the levels of seed damage inflicted by A. macrophthalmus, and the extent to which the beetle has recruited native parasitoids. There were typically two podding cycles annually, with variations in peak pod production between sites and periods of very low seed availability. The levels of pre-dispersal seed damage on canopy-held pods were erratic, fluctuating greatly between months and sites, and seldom exceeding 50%. Levels of post-dispersal damage on soil-surface seeds were substantially lower, seldom exceeding 5%. Parasitism of the larval/pupal stages of A. macrophthalmus also varied between months and sites, reaching a maximum of 45%. There was a moderate but significant negative correlation between percentage seed damage and seed availability, indicating higher damage during periods of seed scarcity. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between percentage parasitism and seed infestation by A. macrophthalmus. These trends suggest that neither A. macrophthalmus nor its recruited parasitoids are tracking resource availability, ensuring a negligible impact on seedling recruitment. Additional seed-reducing agents, particularly insects that exploit green pods, are required to regulate L. leucocephala populations in South Africa. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The vegetation of the botanical conservatory Michel Adanson of Mbour (CBMA), resulting from a process of natural vegetation and introduction of species from various horizons, is today threatened by a number of factors such as erosion coastal. However, good management of this vegetation necessarily requires a better knowledge of its structural characteristics. The purpose of this study is to characterize the CBMA's woody vegetation structure for sustainable management. The dendrometric survey method allowed us to characterize the CBMA vegetation. The woody species inventoried were 23 in 21 genera and 16 families. The density, the basal area and the recovery of the species were quite high causing a strong competition between the individuals. This results in a woody stand dominated by individuals of small diameter and size. The woody stand is also generally characterized by a medium diversity and heterogeneous distribution of individuals in the plots. It regenerates quite well with the dominance of Leucaena leucocephala. This study allows a better knowledge of the vegetation of the CBMA to better manage these plant resources. © 2019 International Formulae Group. All rights reserved.

AB  -                              The field experiment was conducted on black soil (Vertic Ustropept) at Zonal Agricultural Research Station farm, Solapur, for successive 30 years from 1987–1988 to 2016–2017 under dryland condition in a randomized block design with 10 treatments and 3 replications. The pooled results of seven years (2010–2011 to 2016–2017) revealed that the application of 25 kg N ha                             −1                              through crop residue (CR, byre waste) along with 25 kg N ha                             -1                              through Leucaena lopping (Leucaena leucocephala) to rabi sorghum gave significantly higher grain and stover yield and Sustainable Yield Index (14.61 and 36.11 q ha                             −1                              and 0.47, respectively) which was on par with T                             7                             , where 25 kg N ha                             −1                              through farmyard manure (FYM) + 25 kg N ha                             −1                              through urea was applied for grain and stover yield (13.95 and 34.46 q ha                             −1                              and 0.44, respectively). The gross and net monetary returns and benefit–cost ratio were also influenced significantly due to integrated nitrogen management (Rs. 59,796, Rs. 47,353 ha                             −1                             , and 3.13, respectively). This was also reflected in residual soil fertility status of soil after harvest of rabi sorghum. The organic carbon content and available nitrogen content of soil, as well as nitrogen uptake and moisture use efficiency for grain, were also increased. The total microbial count of bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes was more where FYM or CR addition was done. The count of N fixers and P solubilizers was more under Leucaena application either alone or with CR or urea. Application of CR at 4.8 t ha                             −1                              (25 kg N ha                             −1                             ) along with Leucaena lopping at 3.5 t ha                             −1                              (25 kg N ha                             −1                             ) as green leaf manure is the best alternative organic source for fertilizer urea (50 kg N ha                             −1                             ) to increase the production of dryland rabi sorghum.                          © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Yield, chemical composition, fatty acid profile, and sensory acceptability of Panela cheese produced from cows grazing in an intensive silvopastoral system (ISS) with Leucaena leucocephala and Cynodon nlemfuensis were evaluated and compared with Panela cheese from cows grazing a monoculture system (MS) of C. nlemfuensis only. The experiment lasted for 9 weeks in a tropical area in Mexico using ten crossbred cows (30–90 days of milking) assigned homogenously as five cows in each experimental group. No significant differences were found between the two systems for milk and cheese gross composition. Panela cheese from ISS showed lower content of the hypercholesterolemic fatty acids, accompanied with higher content of omega-3, omega-6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, Panela cheese from ISS showed higher preference for the attributes of appearance, texture, flavor, and overall acceptability. It is concluded that Panela cheese from cows grazing in ISS has better acceptability and nutritional properties than that produced from MS with grass only. © 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science

AB  - The paper provides an inventory of the naturalized vascular flora of Ghana, based on newly gathered information from the literature and consultations with local experts. We adopted a rather conservative approach by including only species for which strong evidence exists that they are alien in Ghana. We recorded 291 species of naturalized alien plants; for 237 of them there is information on their distribution in the 10 administrative regions of Ghana. Twenty-five species (i.e. 8.6% of the total number of naturalized species) are classified as invasive. There are 21 widely distributed species (7.2% of the total naturalized flora) that occur in at least eight regions, and five of them are distributed all over the country: Azadirachta indica, Echinochloa colona, Leucaena leucocephala, Senna occidentalis and S. siamea. Of these five, the first three are classified as invasive. The naturalized flora of Ghana includes 71 families, with Leguminosae (66 species), Compositae (22) and Poaceae (18) most represented. The majority of species have their native range in South and North America, contributing 161 and 127 species, respectively. Tropical Asia (98 species) and Africa (37 species) are less represented and only three species have their origin in Europe. The dominance of the Americas as a source region is even more pronounced for the subset of invasive species, with this continent accounting for 18 species out of 25 (72%). Annual and biennial/perennial herbs, shrubs and trees are evenly represented in the naturalized alien species pool. Among invasive species, biennial/perennial herbs are markedly over-represented compared to their contribution to the naturalized flora as a whole (52% vs 38%). The same is true for aquatic species (12% vs 2%). Species that occur as naturalized in more than 40 regions in Africa are also more widely distributed within Ghana. The numbers of naturalized species in the administrative regions of Ghana varied from 34 in Upper West to 173 in Greater Accra. These numbers increased with human population density and decreased with distance from the sea, but this pattern was driven by the city of Accra region. The only predictor that remained significant after removing this outlier was the amount of precipitation in the dry period, which was positively associated with the regional richness of naturalized species. This study could serve as a stimulus for other countries in hitherto understudied tropical regions to work towards comprehensive inventories, for which basic data on the alien flora often is still incomplete. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the influence of tree litters on soil nutrients in a managed forest in southwestern Nigeria. Mono species tree clusters consisted of indigenous species: Gmelina arborea, Tectona grandis, Leucaena leucocephala, Bambusa vulgaris, Treculia africana, Anogeissus leiocarpus were selected and analyzed for their litter and soil chemical properties at 0–5 and 15–30 cm. T. africana and T. grandis litters have the highest nutrients, while L. leucocephala and A. leiocarpus are the lowest. Soils under G. arborea, T. africana, and A. leiocarpus are more acidic due to lower calcium and magnesium contents but have higher manganese and sulphur levels. Tree litters improved soil nitrogen, phosphorous, and micro-nutrients but depleted potassium. Litter lignin and carbon appeared to hinder the release of some nutrients. Nitrogen, potassium and copper are concentrated in the topsoil while others nutrients are not differentiated with soil depth. There is a positive correlation between litter chemistry and soil chemical properties. It was concluded that tree litter chemistry differs according to species but determines soil reaction and nutrient content. The magnitude of the effect on soil properties is related to the quality of the organic litters. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper assesses the ability of fodder plants to reduce methane (CH4) emissions while simultaneously improving animal productivity in Ethiopia. Enteric CH4 emissions from ruminants in Ethiopia increased by 12% or 6197 Gg CO2-eq. in 2017 compared to the year 2011. In this study, six tropical multipurpose forages (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Moringa stenopetala (Bak.f.) Cuf., Sesbania sesban (L.) Merr., Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp., Crotalaria juncea L., and Lablab purpureus L.(Sweet)) and maize stover were characterized in terms of chemical composition, in vitro CH4 production, and CH4 concentration (%). The objective was to identify forages with low CH4 production potential but with adequate forage quality. The forages differed significantly in chemical composition and in enteric CH4 emission. The dry matter (DM), ash, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), and acid detergent lignin (ADL) ranged between 89.4-95.4%, 6.08-12.5%, 3.3-30.7%, 20.4-76.0%, 10.8-44.8, and 2.9-14.1%, respectively. All forage plants, except maize stover, contained high CP content above a threshold value (i.e., 7%). Cajanus c. generates the lowest amount of CH4 (32.83 mL/0.2 g DM incubated). CH4 concentration (%) was used as a potential indicator to determine the capacity of a plant to lower CH4 production. Among the studied species, L. purpureus showed the highest CH4 reduction potential (16%) followed by C. juncea (23.45%), M. stenopetala (24.2%), and L. leucocephala (25.5%). Moringa s. was the most frequently preferred by the farmers followed by C. juncea and L. leucocephala. We concluded that M. stenopetala, C. juncea, and L. leucocephala can be promoted as valuable feed resources for ruminants while simultaneously reducing CH4 emissions. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The use of biomass resources different from conventional wood materials fosters the sustainable growth of the paper industrial sector and finds a development path in line with the concept of circular bioeconomy. In this work, six non-wood materials (Leucaena leucocephala, tagasaste, rice straw, Paulownia fortunei, Hesperaloe funifera and empty fruit bunches) were tested and compared to Eucalyptus globulus for paper production under Kraft conditions. All the raw materials were chemically characterized to determine holocellulose, cellulose, Klason lignin, ash, hot water solubles, 1% soda solubles and ethanol-benzene extractives. In addition, a biometric test was performed to determine the length and the width of the fibres. The cellulosic pulps obtained from the raw materials were characterized to determine their yield, viscosity, Kappa number and drainage index. As regards the paper sheets made from the cellulosic pulps, they were characterized to determine brightness, stretch and tear index. A comparison of the results suggests that these non-wood species can be used for papermaking, under Kraft operating conditions, when high-brightness paper is not required. © 2020 Editura Academiei Romane.

AB  - A shortage in the rubberwood supply is becoming a reality in Malaysia. To find alternative raw materials for Malaysian wood-based industries, fast-growing species have been identified and need to be analyzed in particleboard manufacturing. This study evaluated the properties of particleboard made with a 50:50 ratio of Neolamarckia cadamba and Leucaena leucocephala with melamine urea formaldehyde as the resin at different contents (10%, 12%, and 14%) and particle sizes (1.0 mm, 2.0 mm. and unscreened particles). The particleboards were tested according to EN 312 (2003). The results showed that the particleboard mechanical properties were significantly improved with increase of the resin content and particle size. The thickness swelling value dropped as resin content was increased, showing better stability of the board. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

TI  - Attenuation of Manganese-Induced Toxicity in Leucaena leucocephala Colonized by Arbuscular Mycorrhizae
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077357120&doi=10.1007%2fs11270-019-4381-9&partnerID=40&md5=29e7698fb8e58b17b8b3410a9d0f8a1a
AB  - The use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is considered an important strategy to bioremediate contaminated soil by heavy metals. However, the mechanisms used by AMF to attenuate plant toxicity, caused by the higher manganese (Mn) concentrations in the soil, remain poorly understood. We analyzed the influence of Mn on Leucaena leucocephala development and tolerance inoculated with different AMF species (Claroideoglomus etunicatum, Acaulospora scrobiculata and native AMF). In a greenhouse experiment, we exposed the plant to increasing levels of Mn (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg kg−1) in the soil, during 60 days. Higher Mn levels reduced shoot and root dry mass, AMF spore abundance in soil, and mycorrhizal colonization. However, the inoculated plants were lower affected by the Mn increases in the soil, evidencing phytoprotective effect promoted by the AMF. In addition to higher Mn contents in the roots and lower Mn contents in the shoots, inoculated plants with native AMF and C. etunicatum showed increase in P content in the shoots of 34.4% and 21.8% and decrease in leaf toxicity of 65.15% and 34.74%, respectively, as compared with the control treatment. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis allowed us in detecting Mn on the surface of the spores, which varied with AMF species, acting as a biological barrier to reduce phytotoxicity and increase plant tolerance to Mn. Together, our results suggest that AMF colonization in Leucaena leucocephala attenuates Mn toxicity symptoms and maximizes its development, increasing its tolerance to high concentrations of this element in the soil. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Assessment of leucaena leucocephala as bio-based adsorbent for the removal of pb2+, cd2+ and ni2+ from water
PY  - 2020

AB  - This study was investigated the removal of Pb2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+ from single and multicomponent aqueous solutions by Leucaena leucocephala. The point of zero charge and the specific surface area of the bio-based adsorbent were determined, and the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques were used to characterize the biosorbent. The elemental composition before and after the heavy metal adsorption by this material was found using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The effects of various parameters such as contact time (30–1,440 min), pH (2–10), initial adsorbate concentration (10–500 mg L−1) and biosorbent dosage (1–10 mg L–1) were examined. Biosorption capacity was found to be dependent on all of the parameters studied. The amount of metal ions sorbed by L. leucocephala increased as the radius of the cations decreased. Kinetic studies show that maximum uptake of Pb2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+ was reached within 60 min of contact for single and multicomponent solutions of these metallic ions. However, metal removal by biosorbent using a single metal ion solution was higher than that obtained using multicomponent solutions. Furthermore, the biosorption process of the metal ions followed a well-defined pseudo-second-order model. The data’s for the single and simultaneous removal of Pb2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+ were analyzed according to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The equilibrium data fit well in Freundlich isotherm model. After the biosorption process, L. leucocephala was treated with nitric acid at different concentrations to evaluate reusability. © 2020 Desalination Publications.

TI  - The Mimosoid tree Leucaena leucocephala can be nodulated by the symbiovar genistearum of Bradyrhizobium canariense

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a Mimosoid legume tree indigenous to America that has spread to other continents, although it is not still present in some European countries such as Portugal. Nevertheless, we found that this legume can be nodulated in this country by slow-growing rhizobial strains which were identified as Bradyrhizobium canariense trough the analysis of the core genes recA and glnII. The analysis of the symbiotic gene nodC showed that these strains belong to the symbiovar genistearum, which commonly nodulates Genistoid legumes. Although two strains nodulating L. leucocephala in China and Brazil were classified within the genus Bradyrhizobium, they belong to undescribed species and to the symbiovars glycinearum and tropici, respectively. Therefore, we report here for the first time the ability of L. leucocephala to establish symbiosis with strains of B. canariense sv genistearum confirming the high promiscuity of L. leucocephala, that allows it to establish symbiosis with rhizobia native to different continents increasing its invasiveness potential. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Legume is the best source of protein to ruminant. Tannin content in legumes can provide protein by pass for ruminant. This study was conducted to determine the effect supplementation of legumes (Leucaena leucocephala) as substitute of concentrate on nutrient digestibility and microbial protein synthesis of the completed feed based on ammoniated rice straw. The study was conducted in an in vitro used a randomized block design where there were 3 treatments dan 5 replications. The treatments were A. 40% ammoniated rice straw + 60% concentrate, B. 40% ammoniated rice straw + 50% concentrate + 10% Leucaena leucocephala, C. 40% ammoniated rice straw + 40% concentrate +10, + 20% Leucaena leucocephala. The results showed that the addition of of Leucaena leucocephala had increased the digestibility of DM, OM, CP and microbial protein synthesis (p< 0.05). Increased doses of Leucaena leucocephala until 20% decreased digestion of nutrition compared with dose 10% but was still higher than control. In conclusion, the supplementation of Leucaena leucocephala on completed feed based on ammoniated rice straw in vitro can increase nutrient degradability. Supplementation of 10% and 20% Leucaena leucochepala were suitable to be used for further studies, therefore in vivo experiment is required to study the effects on animal production. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Soil and plant compositions have been affected by human activities in Imo watershed, southern Nigeria. The study examined the responses of soil and plants to changes in landscape under different land use. It was hypothesized that though forest had higher soil organic carbon (OC) and organic matter (OM), it was the most altered land use with substantial loss of biodiversity. Data were collected covering soil properties and plant compositions. Arable land (AL), forestland (FL), grassland (GL), shrubland hills (SL), urban built-up green (UL), Freshwater swamp-mangrove wetland (WL)  and water bodies (WB) were classified as the main land use by using ArcGIS 10.1 and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) land-use classification system. One-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc test was used to determine the mean differences in years and land use for various soil properties and plant parameters. Results revealed that soil nutrient concentrations decreased by at least 50% across land use. Leucaena leucocephala, Vernonia amygdalina, Panicum maximum, Lablab purpreus, Vernonia nigritiana and Elaeis guineensis were dominant with high cover. Species diversity showed significantly negative correlations with species evenness and R-factor (p < 0.05), but positive correlations with total nitrogen and OM and OC (p < 0.001). To restore and increase soil and plant biodiversity, human activities need to be regulated by introducing sustainable agriculture and logging. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Potential of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) for compensatory growth on Anglo-Nubian crossbred male goats

AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the potential of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) as the sole diet after restriction of feeding in order to elevate compensatory growth during re-alimentation. Twelve Anglo-Nubian crossbred male goats, with an average body weight of 17.50 kg, were assigned to 3 treatments, with 4 replicates, in a completely randomized design (CRD), where all treatments were under 3 feeding regimes, viz. pre-feed restriction, feed restriction, and re-alimentation. All animals were allotted to normal feeding and fed with Pangola hay and meal concentrate to promote an average daily gain (ADG) of 100 g in the initial period for 3 weeks. During the feed restriction period, animals in Treatment 1 were continuously fed at the same level as in the pre-restriction (normal growth/control group), while the animals in Treatments 2 and 3 (restricted groups) were kept at feeding levels of 47.5 and 67.5 % below maintenance, based on NRC (2007), for 4 weeks. In the final period of re-alimentation (7 weeks), the normal growth group was given Pangola hay and meal concentrate at the same level as in the pre-restriction period while restricted groups were subjected to ad libitum sole leucaena feeding until the end of the trial. The results showed that average daily gain (ADG) and feed intake did not differ among the treatments during the pre-feed restriction while, in the restriction feeding period, the restricted groups had lower means (P < 0.01) than the normal growth group. In the re-alimentation period, total dry matter intake was not significantly different among treatments. It is pointed that there were 2 sub-periods during the re-alimentation period where total dry matter intake during the compensatory growth and the normal growth were not significantly different. However, the compensatory growth had been achieved within 2 weeks, indicating a higher ADG of 141.25 and 158.57 g in the restricted groups, compared to 106 g in the control group. Afterwards, the sub-period of normal growth (5 weeks) was followed with a lower ADG in the restricted groups than that in the control group. It can be concluded that the potential of single leucaena feeding for compensatory growth after restriction feeding can be achieved within a short period during re-alimentation, due to the limitation of fiber enrichment in leucaena. © 2019 Walailak University.

AB  - Agricultural waste has the potential of biomass as a raw material for producing renewable energy. The primary processing of coffee produces waste from pulping and hulling activities. Waste can be processed further through composting, anaerobic water waste treatment and burning to be converted into electrical energy. Therefore, the calculation is needed that estimates the amount of potential biomass that is converted. Then, the purpose of the paper is to analyze each stage in the life cycle of Gayo Arabica coffee and calculate the potential amount of electrical energy produced. The life cycle assessment method uses material and energy analysis intending to explain the flow of inputs and outputs within the system boundary and analyze the movement and transformation of materials, energy, waste, and emissions. In the context of the paper, the study uses material flow analysis to estimate the biomass potential from solid and water waste treatment. The study uses interviews, observations and a cooperative report located in Central Aceh district as an Arabica coffee producer area in Indonesia. Production of Arabica coffee is managed by cooperatives involving small farmers and collectors from cultivation, primary processing, packaging, and delivery. Cultivation uses the agroforestry system with a shade tree of the type of lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala). Packing with a pack of burlap is done by the cooperative. Activities undertaken cooperatives include the acceptance of coffee beans from the collector. Since 2016 cooperatives implemented a policy of processing coffee beans at the collector level. The estimation of the study shows that waste treatment through anaerobic water waste treatment, composting and combustion from 1 ton of cherry coffee (primary processing) has an energy potential of 34 kwh. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - When a seed-feeding beetle is a predator and also increases the speed of seed germination: an intriguing interaction with an invasive plant
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061360070&doi=10.1007%2fs10682-019-09974-3&partnerID=40&md5=a544b323dd9e2ebebb1fbf0f86fd86b7
AB  - Bruchine beetles are usually considered seed predators, particularly because these beetles consume the seed embryo and kill the seeds. Previous studies suggest that under certain conditions, these insects do not kill the embryo. In this study, we asked whether the germination speed of seeds of the invasive tree Leucaena leucocephala is enhanced by the seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae). We also tested whether differences in germination between attacked and intact seeds could be related to seed size. We finally examined whether the number of larvae per seed affected seed germination and whether seedling emergence patterns were similar to those exhibited by germination. We found that compared to intact seeds, proportionally faster germination occurred in seeds attacked by A. macrophthalmus in 14 of the 26 populations studied. In addition, those populations that presented greater germination speed in the attacked seeds during the evaluation time also had the largest seeds. Similar to the germination experiments, seedling emergence was faster in the attacked compared to the intact seeds. Our findings show that the germination speed of L. leucocephala seeds can be enhanced by A. macrophthalmus. However, this effect is much more intense when a single larva develops inside the seed. In evolutionary terms, it is possible that the selection for larger seeds is favoured, increasing the speed of seed germination and contributing to predator satiation at the seed level. However, this effect could be minimized by the production of many seeds by L. leucocephala plants, causing predator satiation by “masting” effects, which would favour the selection for higher seed numbers. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Difficulty in controlling weeds has hindered the success of vegetation recovery projects using white leadtree (Leucaena leucocephala) seedlings in degraded areas. The use of herbicides is indispensable to mitigate damage and make these areas viable. Therefore, this study evaluated the selectivity of pre- and postemergence herbicides on white leadtree seedlings. Two experiments were carried out in a greenhouse in a randomized block design with four replications. Pre-emergence treatments (g ha-1) were: atrazine (3,500.00), chlorimuron-ethyl (20.00), clomazone (900.00), flumioxazin (125.00), indaziflam (100.00), isoxaflutole (262.50), pendimethalin (1,150.00), sulfentrazone (500), and S-metolachlor (1,920.00), in addition to a control (without herbicide). The second experiment consisted of the following postemergence treatments (g ha-1): atrazine (2,500.00), chlorimuron-ethyl (15.00), clomazone (54.00), flumioxazin (20.00), glyphosate (396.25), haloxyfop-methyl (49.88), indaziflam (75.00), isoxaflutole (187.50), pendimethalin (1,150.00), and S-metolachlor (1,440.00), in addition to a control (without herbicide). Phytotoxicity, plant height, and root collar diameter were assessed at 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days after application (DAA). Shoot dry matter was assessed at 60 DAA. Herbicides atrazine, indaziflam, and isoxaflutole, applied in pre- and postemergence, in addition to glyphosate, negatively influenced all evaluations, being considered nonselective for white leadtree plants. Herbicides with selectivity, regardless of the application method, were chlorimuron-ethyl, clomazone, flumioxazin, haloxyfop-methyl, pendimethalin, sulfentrazone, and S-metolachlor. © 2020 Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

AB  - In the present study, bioadhesive polymeric nanoparticles for ocular delivery of dorzolamide hydrochloride (DRZ) were formulated using derivatized Leucaena leucocephala galactomannan (LLG). The carboxymethyl (CMLLG) and amine derivative (AMLLG) of LLG were synthesized and used for the preparation of nanoparticles. The preparation method was optimized using 2-factor, 3-level central composite experimental design. The optimized nanoparticles were characterized by FTIR, DSC, SEM, TEM and XRD studies. The results of in vitro release studies and ex vivo transcorneal permeation studies revealed sustained release and higher corneal permeation as compared to conventional formulation of DRZ. The optimized nanoparticles were found to reduce the intra ocular pressure (IOP) for prolonged period of time when compared to conventional eye drops. Overall, the present study suggests a promising role of bioadhesive polymeric nanoparticles for ocular drug delivery in glaucoma treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present research had as objective to evaluate the dynamics of the environmental recovery of waste dumps in calcary mining by analyzing the composition and phytosociological structure of natural regeneration. The study was carried out in a waste dumo located in Salto de Pirapora, São Paulo, Brazil, with sterile piles abandoned since 1994 and 2013 and a native forest fragment, totaling three treatments. Twelve plots of 10 × 10 m were allocated to each area, where all shrub-tree individuals with height above 1.30 m were sampled, identified and evaluated for their composition and phytosociological structure. The occurrence of natural regeneration in the sterile cells was observed with the increased number of individuals and species over time. The results indicate that the vegetation present in the waste dumps is in transition from pioneer forest to a more advanced successional stage. However, Leucaena leucocephala has established itself more expressively than other species, inhibiting the development of other species. Finally, management actions are suggested so that the ecological succession of the waste dumps is not compromised. © 2020 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental.

AB  - The main objective of the current work was to investigate the unknown compound composition contains in Leucaena Leucocephala (Petai Belalang) to prove that there were antioxidants properties presents in the leaves and seeds of the plant. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to characterize the samples. It was found that for both leaves and seeds sample of Leucaena Leucocephala, the spectrum had shown the main existence of alcohol (O-H bond. As the O-H bond is the main element of antioxidant and phenolic compound, the FTIR analysis shows for the high possibilities for the present of antioxidant and phenolic compound in the leaves and seeds of Leucaena Leucocephala. Further analysis using HPLC, both seed and leaf sample shows for the presence of the same compounds, identified as apigenin, caffeic acid, formic acid, isorhamnetin, keampferol, luteolin and quercetin, but by comparing the peak, can be concluded that the compounds in seed are higher than the compounds in leaf. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Heavy metals are characterised by a relatively high density and cause genotoxic, cytotoxic and mutagenic effects on plants, animals and humans. Lead (Pb) is one of the heavy metals that causes toxicity to plants and animals. This experiment was conducted using a hydroponic technique to study the effects of Pb(NO3)2 on physiological, biochemical and ultrastructural characteristics in Leucaena leucocephala seedlings. Plants were grown in a growth chamber for 21 days in Hoagland’s solution supplemented with 0 (control), 25, 50, 100, 300, 500 and 700 µm Pb(NO3)2. Shoot heights as well as root lengths decreased significantly in Pb-treated plants with 300, 500 and 700 µm. In Pb-treated plants with high Pb concentrations, photosynthesis rate (PN), stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E) decreased. Total protein and carbohydrate content in Pb-treated plants with 300, 500 and 700 µm increased significantly in leaves. Moreover, in Pb-treated plants with 300, 500 and 700 µm Pb(NO3)2, mesophyll cells had enlarged chloroplasts with disrupted thylakoid membranes associated with large starch grains. In contrast, Pb treatments with 25, 50 µm and 100 µm were not toxic to the plants. Thick sections of roots of Pb-treated plants with 300, 500 and 700 µm Pb showed distinct changes in structure of epidermal and cortical cells. Moreover, thin sections of roots of Pb-treated plants with 300, 500 and 700 µm Pb had thickened walls of xylem cells. These results will shed more light in understanding the effects of heavy metal stress on plants. © 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands

AB  -                              The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of tree foliage species supplemented in ruminant diets based on Pennisetum purpureum on the in vitro digestibility and fermentation, microbial biomass synthesis and enteric methane production. Seven experimental diets were evaluated, including a control treatment based on P. purpureum (PT) grass, and six additional treatments supplemented with 30.0% foliage from Neomillspaughia emargiata (NE), Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia (TA), Caesalpinia gaumeri (CG), Piscidia piscipula (PP), Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Havardia albicans (HA). A randomised complete block design repeated in two periods (block) was used. The highest gas production (P < 0.05) was recorded in treatments TA and PT (237 and 228 mL g                             −1                             , respectively). The highest in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD) and organic matter (IVOMD) (P < 0.05) was recorded in the control treatment PT (57.9% and 66.1%, respectively). Treatments LL, NE, TA and PP promoted greater microbial biomass synthesis (290, 223, 220 and 213 mg g                             −1                             , respectively) (P < 0.05). The proportion of propionic acid also increased in these latter treatments and in treatments CG and HA (P < 0.05). Additionally, treatments LL, PP, NE and TA decreased methane production (25.8, 29.5, 30.6 and 31.8 L kg                             −1                              of digested dry matter, respectively). In conclusion, supplementation with L. leucocephala, P. piscipula, N. emargiata and T. amygdalifolia in ruminant diets based on P. purpureum is one feed alternative that can promote greater efficiency and synthesis of microbial biomass, increase the proportions of propionic and butyric acid and decrease the production of enteric methane by 15.6 to 31.6%.                          © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects different seasons (rainy, rainy-dry transition, dry, dry-rainy transition) throughout the year on the reproduction and endocrine profile of Saanen bucks reared in a tropical climate. During these seasons environmental data were recorded (ambient temperature and relative air humidity) to calculate the temperature and humidity index. Reproductive parameters were also evaluated in the same periods to check seasonal variations, wherey semen was collected twice a month from nine Saanen bucks using an artificial vagina. Furthermore, scrotal circumference, scrotal surface temperature and serum levels of testosterone, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and cortisol were measured. The climate parameters influenced the reproductive parameters, mainly during the dry period, when higher values of ambient temperature reduced sperm quality, however, scrotal circumference and surface temperature, as well as serum levels of testosterone increased. In conclusion, Saanen bucks reared in a tropical climate are subject to heat stress, evinced by transient seasonal variations in reproductive parameters, where the first season is the most favorable to reproduction. © 2020, University of Zagreb, Facultty of Veterinary Medicine.

AB  - This study deals with optimizing the pretreatment process for Leucaena leucocephala wood. Total 51 experiments were conducted. Three parameters were optimized i.e. catalyst concentration (1–3%), duration (120–300 min) and temperature (100–150 °C). Improvement in saccharification efficiency was evaluated using commercial cellulases. Single response, total reducing sugar yield, was estimated at the end of the experiments. The results of these experiments were analysed by three algorithms of neural networks i.e. Bayesian Regularization Neural Network (BRNN), Scaled Conjugate Gradient Neural Network (SCGNN), and Levenberg Marquardt Neural Network (LMNN). Among the three algorithms of ANN, BRNN gave most accurate predictions for total reducing sugar yield. At some points, BRNN and LMNN are almost equally efficient but BRNN had lower values for all error functions. SCGNN and LMNN are supervised in nature but Bayesian uses probabilistic optimization. Probably that makes this technique better than others. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to measure the effect of dietary protein and energy supplementation on rumen characteristics and digestibility of Bali bulls, by in vitro. Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Corypha elata Robx (CeR) as protein and energy sources, respectively, and Native Grasses (NG) collected from Natural Pasture (NP) in Timor-Leste, were used as dietary treatments. A 3 x 3 factorial design was used in this study, namely, protein and energy sources (LL, CeR and LL-CeR) and 3 levels of supplementation (10, 15 and 20%). Rumen characteristics (pH, NH3, microbial protein (MP), and volatile fatty acids (VFA) production and composition) and dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) digestibility were measured. We found that dietary supplementation had a significant (P<0.05) effect on rumen characteristics in terms NH3 concentration, total VFA, acetic acid, propionic acid) but did not affect the pH, butyric acid and microbial protein (P>0.05). The digestibility of DM and OM were also significantly increased (P<0.05). It is concluded that dietary supplementation improves rumen characteristics and digestibility of Bali bulls. Leucaena Leococephala and CeR are recommended as protein and energy supplementation, respectively, on NG diet in NP in Timor-Leste to optimize productivity of Bali cattle. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Makmur M, Zain M, Marlida Y, Khasrad, Jayanegara A. 2019. Fatty acids composition and biohydrogenation reduction agents of tropical forages. Biodiversitas 20: 1917-1922. The study was conducted to determine the composition of fatty acids, measured rumen biohydrogenation reduction agents (total phenols and total tannins) content and selected promising plants in various species of tropical forages. Ten species of tropical forages, namely, Panicum maximum, Cynodon plectostachyus, Pennisetum purpurephoides, Pennisetum purpureum, Brachiaria decumbens, Glyricidia sepium, Calliandra calothyrsus, Stylosanthes guaianensis, Leucaena leucocephala and Indigofera zollingeriana were used in this study. The fatty acids composition (% of total identified fatty acids) which were dominant in grasses were C18: 3n-3 (29%), C16: 0 (28%) and C18: 2n-6 (23%). Whereas in legumes, the significantly higher composition of fatty acids was C18: 3n-3 (42%) followed by C16: 0 (17%) and C18: 2n-6 (17%). The average poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) composition in grasses was relatively lower (44.6%) than legumes (59%). Likewise the content of total phenols and total tannins (g/100g DM) of grasses (0.91 and 0.41) and legumes (1.72 and 0.70). The selection of the forage plant species was based on the criteria of PUFA composition and biohydrogenation reduction agents using TOPSIS method. The results obtained show that B. decumbens (grass) and I. zollingeriana (legume) had the highest preference value of 0.74 and 0.87, respectively. In conclusion, B. decumbens and I. zollingeriana are forage species that have potential to provide healthier ruminant products. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

Both of adsorbents (503 and commercial activated carbon-UCS) modified by cationic surfactants (HDTMA and DDAB) were also applied for removal chromium (VI) ion (Cr                             2                             O                             7                                                          2−                             ), which as expected, adsorption capacity of Cr                             2                             O                             7                                                          2−                              was clearly enhanced, comparing with adsorbent without modification. The physicochemical properties of as-modified adsorbents were investigated. Adsorption behaviour of Cr                             2                             O                             7                                                          2−                              onto modified adsorbent was well fitted on Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms as well as pseudo-second-order kinetic model, suggesting to fast monolayer-physisorption process. The activated carbon (UCS-DDAB) exhibited a maximum q                             max                              of 3.46 mg g                             −1                             . Thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption of Cr                             2                             O                             7                                                          2−                              onto absorbent surface was endothermic process with spontaneous nature. This research was expected to improve the efficiency of activated carbon modified by cationic surfactants, and could be definitely applied for removal of Cr(VI) ion from wastewater.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The experiment was conducted to study an allelopathic effects of leucaena leaves on growth of rice, wrinkle duck-beak and mung bean. The result showed that different concentrations of the leucaena extracts showed various growth patterns on the selected plant species. The growth of seedling shoot length, root length, dry weight and fresh weight were decreased by increasing concentration of the leucaena leaves extract. In rice and wrinkle duck-beak was found that the inhibition was higher in the root than the shoot growth. In addition, the use of leucaena extracts 1:1 to 1:5 can restrain the growth of wrinkle duck-beak root length 100% at the age of 3 days, but from the age of 7 days, all leucaena extracts completely restrained the wrinkle duck-beak root length. Furthermore, allelopathy of leucaena results can be utilized for the biological weed control and to reduce the use of herbicide in agriculture systems. © 2019, Prince of Songkla University.

AB  - Phaseolus dumosus is an endemic species from mountain tops in Mexico that was found in traditional agriculture areas in Veracruz, Mexico. P. dumosus plants were identified by ITS sequences and their nodules were collected from agricultural fields or from trap plant experiments in the laboratory. Bacteria from P. dumosus nodules were identified as belonging to the phaseoli-etli-leguminosarum (PEL)or to the tropici group by 16S rRNA gene sequences. We obtained complete closed genomes from two P. dumosus isolates CCGE531 and CCGE532 that were phylogenetically placed within the tropici group but with a distinctive phylogenomic position and low average nucleotide identity (ANI). CCGE531 and CCGE532 had common phenotypic characteristics with tropici type B rhizobial symbionts. Genome synteny analysis and ANI showed that P. dumosus isolates had different chromids and our analysis suggests that chromids have independently evolved in different lineages of the Rhizobium genus. Finally, we considered that P. dumosus and Phaseolus vulgaris plants belong to the same cross-inoculation group since they have conserved symbiotic affinites for rhizobia. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Plants constitute a major ingredient in traditional or folk medicine. The therapeutic claims made on the use of these traditional medicinal plants range from simple conditions such as fevers and migraines, to more complex diseases such as cancer, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. The aqueous ethanolic extracts of five medicinal plant species; Cosmos caudatus, Leucaena leucocephala, Momordica charantia, Pereskia bleo and Averrhoa bilimbi were assessed for glucose lowering effect via the in vitro α-glucosidase inhibition assay. Their antioxidant potential, represented by their DPPH radical scavenging activity and total phenolic contents were also measured. The most potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was recorded for the leaf extract of C. caudatus with IC50 of 21.90 ± 3.60 μg/mL, followed by L. leucocephala with IC50 value of 30.80 ± 2.50 μg/mL. Momordica charantia, P. bleo and A. bilimbi did not show any significant inhibition of α-glucosidase. Meanwhile C. caudatus also gave the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity with IC50 value of 272.46 ± 8.98 μg/mL, and the highest total phenolic content with a value of 0.263 ± 0.02 g GAE/g DW. The present work provides a priority list of interesting plants for further study with respect to the treatment of diabetes. © 2018 Universiti Putra Malaysia.

AB  - Two Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped bacterial strains (C5T and C16), isolated from root nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris L. in Jiangxi Province, PR China, were characterized by using a polyphasic taxonomical approach. The phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and three concatenated housekeeping genes (recA-glnII-atpD) revealed that C5T and C16 were members of the genus Rhizobium, yet were distinct from known species. The case for strain C5T representing a novel species was supported by genomic results. Pairwise digital DNA-DNA hybridization and average nucleotide identity values were much lower than the proposed and generally accepted species boundaries. The genome-based phylogenetic tree reconstructed by using the up-to-date bacterial core gene set consisting of 92 genes showed that the strains formed a monophyletic branch, further supporting this result. The symbiotic genes of nodC and nifH were identified in both strains; each could nodulate Phaseolus vulgaris and Glycine max but not Leucaena leucocephala, Pisum sativum or Medicago sativa plants. Major cellular fatty acids of C5T were summed feature 8 (C18: 1 ω7c/C18: 1 ω6c; 58.8%), C18: 1 ω7c 11-methyl (14.2%) and C18: 0 (8.1%). The DNA G+C content of C5T was 61.4 mol%. Based on these genomic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic characteristics, we propose a novel species: Rhizobium chutanense sp. nov. The type strain is C5T (=CCTCC AB 2018143T=LMG 30777T). © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Effects of outdoor access and indoor stocking density on behaviour and stress in broilers in the subhumid tropics

AB  - Studies investigating the welfare of commercial-line broiler chickens raised in houses with outdoor access in the tropics are scarce, and none have investigated whether responses vary according to indoor conditions. Hence, we assessed the effects of providing outdoor access at two indoor stocking densities on broiler chickens’ growth, behaviour, stress responses and immunity in a tropical region of Mexico. One hundred and sixty chickens were assigned to one of four treatments in a factorial design: with or without outdoor access and low or high stocking density indoors. Ad libitum sampling was used to build a purpose-designed ethogram. Scan sampling was used to record the number of birds engaged in each activity of this ethogram, both indoors and outdoors. Heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and serum corticosterone levels were tested in weeks four and six of age. When the birds were 42 days old, they were slaughtered, and the bursa and spleen harvested and weighed. In an interaction between stocking density and outdoor access, birds at the high stocking density with no outdoor pens spent the least time walking and preening and more time lying (p < 0.05). Birds given outdoor access foraged more, but only at indoor low stocking densities (p < 0.05). Outdoor access reduced heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, indicating reduced stressor response. Birds with low stocking density indoors and outdoor access appeared more responsive to stressors, with elevated corticosterone and reduced spleen and bursa weights (p < 0.05). There were welfare benefits of outdoor access, principally in terms of increased activity, which were reflected in slower growth in the birds with outdoor access. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - In vitro rumen biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids in tropical grass-legume rations
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089340980&doi=10.14202%2fvetworld.2020.661-668&partnerID=40&md5=db2e349fe92a4bdb4a5f4c9b693c5ccd
AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of various combinations of tropical grass-legume species in rations on the biohydrogenation (BH) activity of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), C18:0 composition, and fermentation profile in an in vitro rumen system. Materials and Methods: Samples of the following five fodder plants were used: One species of grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and four species of tree legumes (Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra calothyrsus, and Indigofera zollingeriana). The following eight experimental diets were evaluated: 50% P. purpureum + 50% L. leucocephala (LL I); 50% P. purpureum + 50% G. sepium (GS I); 50% P. purpureum + 50% C. calothyrsus (CC I); 50% P. purpureum + 50% I. zollingeriana (IZ I); 75% P. purpureum + 25% L. leucocephala (LL II); 75% P. purpureum + 25% G. sepium (GS II); 75% P. purpureum + 25% C. calothyrsus (CC II); and 75% P. purpureum + 25% I. zollingeriana (IZ II). Each ration was replicated 3 times. In vitro rumen incubation was performed for 48 h, according to the Tilley and Terry method. Determination of the FA profiles of the forage materials and rumen fluid samples was performed using gas chromatography. Results: The percentage of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) in the forage materials ranged from 34.18% (P. purpureum) to 74.51% (C. calothyrsus). The percentage of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) ranged from 5.06% (P. purpureum) to 8.71% (L. leucocephala). The percentage of saturated FA (SFA) was the lowest at 19.12% (C. calothyrsus) and highest at 60.76% (P. purpureum). In vitro BH of C18:3 n-3, C18:2 n-6, C18:1 n-9, and C18 PUFA in the experimental diets ranged from 72% to 100%. The BH of C18:1 n-9 in GS I (80%) and IZ I (72%) was significantly different (p<0.05). The percentage of C18:0 was 10-50% and significantly different (p<0.05) among treatments, with the highest (of 50%) in GS II. No significant differences (p>0.05) were observed in the fermentation parameters (pH, total volatile FAs, in vitro dry matter digestibility, and in vitro organic matter digestibility) among the treatments, except in NH3 concentration (p<0.05). Conclusion: The various combinations of tropical legumes do not have significant inhibitory effects on the BH of C18:2 n-6, C18:3 n-3, and C18 PUFA after in vitro incubation for 48 h. Furthermore, an increase in the tropical legume ratio in the ration tends to suppress C18:0 formation after the fermentation simulation process. IZ I has the potential to reduce C18:1 n-9 (MUFA) disappearance and yield an ideal rumen fermentation profile. Makmur, et al. Open Access. © 2020 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the soil pollution level and evaluated the phytoremediation potential of 25 native plant species on a former gold mine-tailing site in Ghana. Plant shoots and associated soil samples were collected from a tailing deposition site and analyzed for total element concentration of As, Hg, Pb, and Cu. Soil metal(loid) content, bioaccumulation factor (BAFshoots), and hyperaccumulator thresholds were also determined to assess the current soil pollution level and phytoextraction potential. The concentration of As and Hg in the soil was above international risk thresholds, while that of Pb and Cu were below those thresholds. None of the investigated plant species reached absolute hyperaccumulator standard concentrations. Bioavailability of sampled metal(loid)s in the soil was generally low due to high pH, organic matter, and clay content. However, for Cu, relatively high bioaccumulation values (BAFshoots > 1) were found for 12 plant species, indicating the potential for selective heavy-metal extraction via phytoremediation by those plants. The high levels of As at the study site constitute an environmental and health risk but there is the potential for phytoextraction of Cu (e.g., Aspilia africana) and reclamation by afforestation using Leucaena leucocephala and Senna siamea. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The low quality of tropical grasses in the dry season justifies the use of dietary supplements to meet the nutritional needs of sheep. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementation with high-protein feed on mutton sheep performance and yield in Massai grass pastures during the dry season. The treatments corresponded to four supplements, namely Leucaena leucocephala leaf hay, Gliricidia sepium leaf hay, soybean meal, and a treatment that received only multiple mixture (protein salt) ad libitum. The pasture was evaluated for canopy height, forage supply, and chemical composition of leaf blade, stem and dead material. Average daily gain, weight gain per area, and the stocking rate were also evaluated. There were four grazing cycles because the grazing method was rotational stocking with seven days of occupation and 35 days of rest. The interaction between supplements and grazing cycles was not significant, and no effects of the supplements were found for any of the variables. The highest forage and leaf blade offerings were observed in the first grazing cycle. The highest levels of crude protein and lower neutral detergent fibre and lignin of pasture components were observed in cycles 3 and 4. The highest average daily gains per animal and per area were observed in cycles 1 and 2. Protein supplementation of sheep in Massai grass pastures promotes satisfactory gains during the dry season, and Leucaena and Gliricidia hays can be used as protein sources instead of soybean meal. © 2020 South African Bureau for Scientific Publications.

AB  - Mlanding tempeh is made from Leucaena leucocephala seed fermentation by Rhizopus sp. The traditional process of making Mlanding tempeh consist of boiling the seed, crushing to separate the hull, soaking, boiling, and fermentation with Usar as inoculum. There are Rhizopus sp. and some microbial contaminants in Usar. The objective of the research was to study the change on microbial growth (lactic acid bacteria, mold, and yeast) during Mlanding tempeh over fermentation. The fresh tempeh was obtained from 36 hours fermentation and then continued with fermentation up to 120 hours. The results showed that the pH was increased up to 8.5 at the end of fermentation. The total mold number increased at 36 hours fermentation then stable until 72 hours and decreased at the 84 hours fermentation and undetected at 108 hours fermentation. During 36 hours fermentation, the number of yeasts increased then until 72 hours the number of yeasts was stable. In 84 hours the number of yeast decreased and finally, the yeast undetected at the 96 hours fermentation. The number of lactic acid bacteria increased by 72 hours and then decreased until the end of fermentation. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Torrefaction of Leucaena Leucocephala under isothermal conditions using the Coats–Redfern method: kinetics and surface morphological analysis
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071747102&doi=10.1007%2fs11144-019-01659-w&partnerID=40&md5=c82ecf0d21d6049d3f0c7e8779517eae
AB  - The effects of temperature and holding times on the torrefaction of Leucaena Leucocephala (Leucaena) were elucidated via a novel isothermal decomposition approach. The torrefaction was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at temperature ranged from 200 to 300 °C for 20, 40 and 60 min. The effects of both torrefaction temperature and holding time were studied quantitatively and qualitatively by evaluating the distribution product yields and surface morphological changes. Quantitatively, the mass yield decreased with increasing temperature for all tested holding times, while the liquid and gas yields increased steadily due to the release of volatiles from the biomass decomposition. Qualitatively, significant morphological changes on Leucaena due to torrefaction were evidently captured via SEM imaging analysis. For torrefaction temperatures from 200 to 260 °C, the raw and torrefied Leucaena showed that pore evolution process had become evident. However, for torrefaction temperatures from 280 to 300 °C, the torrefied Leucaena revealed that the internal structure of torrefied Leucaena underwent pore development process. The pore development was noticeably observed for all temperatures. The values of activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor (ln A) for the torrefaction were calculated based on the Coats–Redfern method for first order reaction. The values of Ea and ln A for 20, 40 and 60 min were found to be 39.75, 40.10 and 42.31 kJ/mol, and 3.92, 4.14 and 4.67. As a conclusion, the torrefaction of Leucaena from 200 to 300 °C for 20 min holding time is more reactive as compared to that at higher holding time. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Abstract: The efficient/low-cost activated carbons were prepared from inedible fruits such as Cerbera odollam Gaertn, Terminalia catappa, Ficus lyrata, Couroupita guianensis Aubl and Hevea brasiliensis as well as biochars of Combretum quadrangulare and Leucaena Leucocephala (LL). The physical and chemical activation processes were applied to improve the Fe3+ adsorption efficiency. As obtained results, LL heated at 500 °C for 2 h (LL502) exhibited best performance for Fe3+ adsorption with a qe value of Fe3+ (28.18 mg/g). The physicochemical properties of LL502 such as BET surface area, total acid–base amount and pHpzc were 247.3 m2/g, 2.2647 meq/g and 8.49, respectively. Moreover, the adsorption behaviors of Fe3+ onto the surface of LL502 were found to be monolayer, physisorption and rapid adsorption processes which could be confirmed by Langmuir and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherms and pseudo-second order kinetic models, respectively. Adsorption thermodynamics also indicated that the Fe3+ adsorption processes were endothermic and spontaneous in nature. In addition, 98% of iron removal from ground/surface water was successfully achieved by using LL502. The quality of ground/surface water was acceptable based on comparison with a water quality standard. This research was as expected since as-prepared low-cost adsorbent could be verily applied in a practical treatment process.

AB  - The purpose of this text is to provide a long-term record of oc-currences of the species Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. in the Brazilian territory, in order to (i) determine if its introduction occurred before the earliest official record, (ii) identify points of occurrence in Brazil, and (iii) assess its status as a useful although invasive plant. The text is partly based on research done on the confirmed presence of this plant in the Brasília National Park, located in Brazil’s Federal District. Three databases available on the Internet containing information from several herbariums were accessed to obtain the location and the dates of the relevant records of the plant in Brazilian territory. We found that the species was rather widely present in the Brazilian territory before the official record of its earliest introduction. In addition, we found that the plant’s current geographic distribution indicates that it continues to have a strong invasive potential in Brazil, especially because there are social and technical incentives to cultivate it in rural properties. © 2020, Editora da P U C R S.

TI  - The interaction effect between intraspecific competition and seed quality on the life-history traits of the seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075782951&doi=10.1111%2feea.12854&partnerID=40&md5=c4a0865026399eac816301824618e6c5
AB  - It has been shown that intraspecific competition and resource quality may affect life-history traits of insects, such as body size, fecundity, and survival. However, intraspecific competition and resource quality may interact with each other. The study of such interacting effects is crucial for understanding the influence of these ecological variables on the selection of specific life-history traits. Here, we investigated whether the interaction between intraspecific larval competition and variation in resource quality affects adult emergence and survival, egg size, fecundity, body size, and sexual size dimorphism (SSD) of the seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) when infesting Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit (Fabaceae), its host plant. In the laboratory, beetles were reared on seeds that differed in quality (e.g., different hardness, seed size, water content), in the presence or absence of larval competition. Body size and SSD did not differ between treatments (with and without competition), nor were they affected by varying resource quality. Females subjected to competition during the larval stage and females emerging from seeds of higher quality, displayed the highest fecundity. The proportion of emergent adults was higher in the absence of competition. In addition, larger eggs were laid on the low-quality resource in the absence of competition, showing a trade-off between egg size and egg number. Adult survival differed among treatments and resource qualities, suggesting a higher investment in adult survival for individuals emerging from seeds of low quality in the presence of competition. Whether changes in specific traits could be selected for in detriment of others will depend on the strength of intraspecific competition, the variation in resource quality, and the plasticity in the life-history traits investigated. This needs further clarification. © 2019 The Netherlands Entomological Society

AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the genetic diversity of the nodule-forming bacteria associated with native populations of Vachellia gummifera growing wild in Morocco. The nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences from three selected strains, following ARDRA and REP-PCR results, revealed they were members of the genus Ensifer and the sequencing of the housekeeping genes recA, gyrB, dnaK and rpoB, and their concatenated phylogenetic analysis, showed that the 3 strains belong to the species E. fredii. Based on the nodC and nodA phylogenies, the 3 strains clearly diverged from the type and other reference strains of E. fredii and formed a clearly separated cluster. The strains AGA1, AGA2 and AGB23 did not form nodules on Glycine max, Phaseolus vulgaris and Medicago truncatula, and effectively nodulated V. gummifera, Acacia cyanophylla, Prosopis chilensis and Leucaena leucocephala. Based on similarities of the nodC and nodA symbiotic genes and differences in the host range, the strains isolated from Moroccan endemic V. gummifera may form a different symbiovar within Ensifer species, for which the name “vachelliae” is proposed. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Available soil nutrients and water content affect leaf nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry at different ages of Leucaena leucocephala forests in dry-hot valley
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048596653&doi=10.1007%2fs11368-018-2029-9&partnerID=40&md5=7c500fcdefdf4ffceecf5ea2b1ecba42
AB  - Purpose: The carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations of leaves can reflect soil nutrient supply conditions and changes in soil. An understanding of species adaptability and nutrient use efficiency in extreme ecosystems can help land managers choose effective methods to improve management and community structure of introduced plants which may induce biological invasion and limit the regeneration of native species. Materials and methods: We selected the Leucaena leucocephala forests in three ages (9, 15, and 26 years old) in the Jiangjiagou Gully to study the relationships between (i) soil factors and forest age and (ii) leaf nutrient concentrations. Soil factors and leaf nutrients were measured in nine sampling quadrats of 10 × 10 m of each plot. We used ANOVA to examine differences in leaf variables and soil factors at different ages of L. leucocephala forest. Pearson’s correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were conducted to identify the relationships between soil factors and leaf variables. Then, we used analysis of covariance to examine combined effects of forest ages and soil factors on leaf variables. Results and discussion: Leaf N was significantly correlated with available P, while leaf P was significantly correlated with both available P and available N. Leaf N and P had no significant relationship with soil total N and P. Leaf C:N:P stoichiometries had a higher significant correlation with total N, available N, and soil water content. Conclusions: Our findings illustrate that available N and available P are the main limitations for L. leucocephala, though available P imposed a stronger limitation than available N. Moreover, soil water content played an indispensable role on nutrient accumulation and the soil ecological environment. Our results provide useful information to improve L. leucocephala community structure and reduce soil degradation in a dry-hot valley. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Feed intake, rumen fermentation, digestibility and live weight gain of male Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) fed different mixtures of Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2019

AB  - Leucaena based cattle fattening system has been widely adopted by farmers in Sumbawa island Indonesia. Farmers mostly fatten cattle with leucaena as the sole diet so the number of cattle fattened in the dry season declines with availability of leucaena. Despite its widespread use as living fences, Gliricidia sepium,, on the other hand, has not been optimally utilized to feed cattle due to its low palatability. In this experiment, gliricidia was mixed with leucaena at increasing level to improve its intake. The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effect of replacing leucaena in the diet on feed intake and live weight gain of male Bali cattle. Twenty male Bali cattle at approximately 12 months of age and initial live weight of 121±10.9 kg were divided into four groups and fed ad libitum one of the following diets: 100% Leucaena, 85% leucaena and 15% gliricidia, 70% leucaena and 30% gliricidia and 55% leucaena and 45% gliricidia . All diets were supplemented with rice bran 5g/kg LW and minerals x at 3% of the rice bran. There were no differences among diets in DM feed intake: 2.6 – 2.9% of LW, organic matter digestibility 54.3 – 63.6% and live weight gains 0.43 – 0.54 kg/d. Replacing up to 45% leucaena with gliricidia did not reduce feed intake, digestibility and live weight gain of male Bali cattle. © 2019 Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.

The combination effects of different concentrations of Acer saccharum var. saccharum inner (IB) and outer (OB) bark acetone extracts with citric acid (CA) applied to Leucaena leucocephala wood were evaluated against the growth of three common molds (Trichoderma viride, Fusarium subglutinans, and Aspergillus niger). IB, OB, and CA solutions were prepared at 0.25% and 0.5% and their combinations were formulated in equal amounts. Acetone extracts of IB and OB were analyzed for their chemicals composition and phenolic compounds using GC/MS and PHLC, respectively. The IB acetone extract contained 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone (31.67%), palmitic acid (15.52%), and linoleic acid (11.14%), while the OB acetone extract contained 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(2-ethylhexyl) ester (9.34%), (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadien-1-ol (8.86%), and cis-tetrahydro-6-methoxy-2H-pyran-3-ol (5.72%). The HPLC analysis indicated the presence of 14 phenolic compounds in IB extract with major constituents caffeine (362.88 µg/g extract), and p-hydroxy benzoic acid (358.06 µg/g extract), while OB contained 12 compounds with major constituents p-hydroxy benzoic acid (8950.5 µg/g extract), gallic acid (5261 µg/g extract) and salicylic acid (572.38 µg/g extract). High total phenolic content in OB (292.67 mg GAE/g) was associated with high antioxidant activity with an IC                             50                              values of 1.77 and 4.14 μg/mL, as measured by DPPH and β-Carotene-linoleic acid, respectively. The combination treatment of IB0.25%+ OB0.25%+CA0.25% produced the highest antifungal effects against growth of T. viride with an inhibition percentage (IP) of 10.37%, IB0.5%+CA0.5% (IP 16.66%) with F. subglutinans, while CA0.5% and OB0.25%, showed IP of 27.77% and 23.70% with A. niger, respectively. The combination effects of IB, OB and CA could be used as biocide agents for preventing mold growth on wood.                          © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  -                              This study is initiated to launch an activated carbon derived from Leucaena leucocephala seed pod as an adsorbent for the removal of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solution. The prepared activated carbon was characterized by proximate analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement, scanning electron microscopic-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The effects of various variables, initial Cr(vi) concentration, contact time, adsorbent dosage, temperature and pH, which influence the adsorption process, were investigated. Equilibrium adsorption isotherms, kinetic and thermodynamic behaviour of the process were studied. The pH at point of zero charge (pH                             pzc                             ) of 5.20 suggested that surface of the activated carbon was positively charged for pH below the pH                             pzc                             , attracting anions. The obtained results showed that 100 min contact time, 1.0 g adsorbent dose, 45 °C temperature and solution pH of 6.0 resulted in maximum Cr(vi) uptake. The experimental data better fitted to the Langmuir isotherm with monolayer adsorption capacity of 26.94 mg/g. The kinetic analysis revealed that pseudo-second-order model fitted well to the acquired experimental data. The thermodynamic behaviour of Cr(vi) adsorption onto activated carbon was found to be spontaneous and endothermic in nature.                          © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Assessment of ecological fitness of woody species across land use is critical issues in degraded land restoration. However, little is known about AGBC stored capacity, important value and distribution index of woody species grows in exclosure and adjacent open lands. Therefore, this research is aimed to (i) analyse impact of exclosure on AGBC (ii) ecological fit species. A random sampling method was employed. Forty sample plots (50m*50m) were used. AGBC stocks (mean± SE) of woody species in adjacent open grazing and exclosure land use of GW site was 0.11±0.07 and 1.24±0.27Mg ha-1 respectively. While in adjacent open grazing and exclosure land use of WG site, the value was 0.27±0.03 and 2.79±0.27Mgha-1 respectively. In both site exclosure land uses, the proportion of rare, occasional and common woody species were better than their adjacent open grazing land. Cupressus lustanica from open grazing and Vernonia auriculifera from exclosure land use of WG as well as Croton macrostachyus from open grazing and Leucaena leucocephala from exclosure land use of GW site were recorded as top ecologically fit species. It is recommended to protect degraded lands via integrating ecologically adapted native species and fully used their diversity to achieve the potential benefits of land restoration. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Catalytic Steam Reforming of Biomass-Derived Tar over the Coal/Biomass Blended Char: Effect of Devolatilization Temperature and Biomass Type
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065020191&doi=10.1021%2facs.energyfuels.9b00320&partnerID=40&md5=901a69d85f856512048843d550083839
AB  - Catalytic tar steam reforming over char was conducted in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor. This reactor was divided into two zones: the "devolatilization zone", where the biomass tar is released, and the "tar reforming zone", where the tar and char are contacted and reformed into products. The temperature of the tar reforming zone was maintained at 800 °C for all experiments. The effects of devolatilization temperature (600, 700, and 800 °C) and biomass type (rice straw, RS, and Leucaena leucocephala wood, LN) on the catalytic performance of char during tar steam reforming were investigated. Biomass chars and coal/biomass blended chars (C/RS and C/LN) were prepared as the catalyst for tar steam reforming. Results revealed that compared with biomass chars, C/RS and C/LN performed a better catalytic activity in tar steam reforming, resulting in a higher carbon conversion into gas and a lower carbon conversion into tar. The main catalytic roles of the coal/biomass blended char can be explained by the improvement of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area during co-pyrolysis and the existence of alkali and alkaline earth metallic species (AAEMs), particularly K, as the stable silicate form. Considering the effect of devolatilization temperature, the tar released at 700 °C can be mostly converted among all types of char. Tars containing the mixture of phenolic compounds (i.e., phenol and methyl phenol) and aromatic compounds (i.e., naphthalene and methyl naphthalene) were favorable to reform over the char surface to achieve the relatively high tar conversion. In addition, LN tar was easier to convert than the RS tar in both cases of with and without char because of the lower proportion of a stable aromatic compound. The outcome of this study can be beneficial for the design and operation of the tar removal process during biomass gasification using the low-cost carbon-based catalyst. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The revival of the natural dyes comes from an awareness of maintaining health and preserving the environment. Medicinal plants can be used as a source of the natural dyes. This study aimed to determine the medicinal plants in East Sumba Regency potentially exploited as a natural dye for ikat weaving. Plant data was obtained from Tana Tuku village and Mbatakapidu village in East Sumba Regency. A total 13 species of plants were extracted to dye cotton fabric and mordant by FeSO4 (ferrous sulphate), Al2(SO4)3 (alum) dan CaCO3 (lime). The intensity of color L*, a*, b* were analyzed by Kruskal Wallis test and Duncan post hoc test. The fastness of washing test analyzed by a gray color change scale and staining scale standard. The results showed that the ferrous sulphate mordant produced dark color and the alum mordant produced bright color. The intensity of red color was shown by Swietenia macropylla King and Leucaena leucocephala when it was mordanting by lime. The intensity of yellow color was shown by Woodfordia fruticosa (L.) Kurz with alum and Syzigium polyanthum with lime. The color change was not significant at 40oC of washing shown by Tamarindus indica and Leucaena leucocephala mordanting by ferrous sulphate, Leucaena leucocephala, Bombax ceiba and Timonius timon mordanting by alum, Tamarindus indica, Leucaena leucocephala, Timonius timon mordanting with lime.

AB  - The use of Leucaena leucocephala leaf powder treated with urea (treated-ULLP) as an alternative adsorbent for the adsorption of Pb(II) ions has been investigated. The adsorption studies were performed under batch mode and focused on the effects of pH, adsorbent dosage and initial Pb(II) concentrations. The pseudo-second order kinetics model fitted well the adsorption data with the values of correlation coefficient (R2) > 0.97. Large amounts of hydroxyl, carboxyl and amine as detected by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer suggested that these functional groups were responsible for the adsorption of Pb(II) ions. Treated-ULLP demonstrated a good potential for Pb(II) ions removal with the maximum adsorption capacity of 90.09 mg/g, calculated from the Langmuir isotherm model. © 2020 Technoscience Publications.

TI  - Invasive plants facilitated by socioeconomic change harbor vectors of scrub typhus and spotted fever
PY  - 2020
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078870538&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pntd.0007519&partnerID=40&md5=d27d4ed2da9bfadbe63f2ecace566f7f
AB  - Ecological determinants of most emerging vector-borne diseases are understudied, particularly for neglected tropical disease. Moreover, although socioeconomic impacts can have significant downstream effects on human risks to vector-borne diseases via a change in land cover, particularly facilitating the invasion of exotic plants, related studies remains very scarce. Scrub typhus and spotted fever are neglected diseases emerging around the globe and are transmitted by chigger mites and ticks infective of Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rick-ettsia spp., respectively, with small mammals as the primary hosts of both vectors. Methodology/Principal findings We investigated how invasions of the plant Leucaena leucocephala caused by widespread abandonment of farmlands driven by industrialization affected abundance of chiggers and ticks in Penghu Island, Taiwan. We determined ectoparasite abundance by trapping small mammals in three types of habitats (invasion site, agricultural field, human residential) every two months for a year. Based on ectoparasite burdens, invasion sites harbored more chiggers and ticks than the other two habitats. Furthermore, hosts maintained higher burdens of both vectors in early winter and burdens of chiggers were more stable across seasons in invasion sites, suggesting that sites with invasive plants could be a temporary refuge for both vectors and might help mitigate the negative influence of unfavorable climate. Infective rates of O. tsutsugamushi in chiggers and Rickettsia in ticks were also consistently not lower in invasion sites. Top soil temperature and relative humidity were similar across the three habitats, but invasion sites contained more of the rat Rattus losea, on which chiggers and ticks were more engorged than those from the most commonly trapped species (Suncus murinus shrew), indicating that abundance of the host R. losea instead of microclimate might better determine the abundance of both vectors. Conclusions/Significance This study highlights an important but largely neglected issue that socioeconomic change can have unexpected consequences for human health induced particularly by invasive plants, which could become a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases but usually are very hard to be eradicated. In the future, a more comprehensive approach that integrates socio-economics, land use, exotic species, and human health should be considered to fully under-stand potential emergence of vector-borne diseases. © 2020 Wei et al.

TI  - Rapid sequestration of ecosystem carbon in 30-year reforestation with mixed species in dry hot valley of the jinsha river
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067202377&doi=10.3390%2fijerph16111937&partnerID=40&md5=d0e7149694fa00ad2062c04ef05fb9da
AB  - Reforestation plays an important role in the carbon cycle and climate change. However, knowledge of ecosystem carbon sequestration through reforestation with mixed species is limited. Especially in dry hot valley of the Jinsha River, no studies cover total ecosystem carbon sequestration level in mature mixed plantations for a limited area of mixed plantations and difficulty in the sampling of plant roots and deep soil. In this study, carbon sequestration of seven mixed plantations of different ages in dry hot valley of the Jinsha River was investigated with analogous sites method. The results are as follows: 1) Deep soil organic carbon (SOC) storage significantly increased with stand age (p = 0.025), possibly due to fine root exudates and dissolved organic carbon transportation into deep soil and retention. 2) Total biomass carbon storage in the 30-year-old mixed plantation was 77.78 t C ha−1, 54 times reference wasteland and 9 times reference natural recovery shrub-grassland. However, total biomass carbon storage of 30-year-old mixed plantation was insignificantly lower than that of reference natural forest (p = 0.429). After 30 years of reforestation, plantation biomass carbon storage recovered to reference level, and its sequestration rate was 2.54 t C ha−1 yr−1. 3) The total ecosystem carbon storage of 30-year-old mixed plantation was 185.50 t C ha−1, 2.38 times reference wasteland, 2.29 times reference natural recovery shrub grassland, and 29% lower than reference natural forest. It indicated that niche complementary, good stand structure, and characteristics of dominant species Leucaena leucocephala in mixed plantations facilitate more rapid carbon sequestration, especially biomass carbon in the dry hot valley. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Condensed tannin (CT) of varying molecular weights (MWs) may affect rumen microbial fermentation by shifting composition of fungal community. In this study the effects of unfractionated CTs (F0) and CT fractions of different MWs (F1 > F2 > F3 > F4 > F5) from Leucaena leucocephala hybrid-Rendang (LLR) on the fungal mass and composition of fungal community were determined using molecular approaches. The results showed that the total fungi biomass decreased (p <.05) with the addition of higher-MWs CT fractions F1, F2 and F3 with values 35.3 µg/mL, 34.6 µg/mL and 39.3µg/mL, respectively, when compared to that of the control sample (without CTs) at 52.1 µg/mL. Sequencing of the polymorphic internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) by high-throughput sequencer, recovered mean of 109,190 sequences per-sample which comprised of a number of operation taxonomy units (OTUs) ranging from 22 to 38 and were classified into 7 genera. Piromyces 4 was the dominant genus in the control representing ∼70% of the sequences. Relative abundance of the Piromyces 4 increased significantly (p <.05) with increasing MWs of the CT fractions, however the second dominant Neocallimastigaceae was significantly (p <.05) reduced. This study demonstrated that CT fractions of different MWs could decrease the population mass as well as alter the rumen fungal community structure and diversity, and the effect was more pronounced for higher-MWs CTs. Hence, the shift in fungal diversity, accompanied by changes in population mass would influence fibre digestibility in the rumen in the presence of high MW CTs.HIGHLIGHTS Condensed tannins (CTs) of different molecular weights (MWs) alter the rumen fungi population and diversity. Relative abundance of the Neocallimastigaceae decreased with increasing MWs of CTs, whereas the predominant Piromyces was significantly increased. Higher MWs of CT fractions would influence fibre digestibility in the rumen. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - The non-flavonoid inducible nodA3 and the flavonoid regulated nodA1 genes of Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 guarantee nod factor production and nodulation of different host legumes
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064839796&doi=10.1007%2fs11104-019-04073-2&partnerID=40&md5=e4b7646693aa608a8c29ad7d9bd725ad
AB  - Aims: The symbiosis between rhizobia and their host legumes is initiated by a complex molecular dialogue in which the activation of bacterial NodD proteins by appropriate plant flavonoids triggers the expression of the bacterial nodulation (nod) genes. These genes are involved in the synthesis and export of the Nodulation factors (NF), which are signal molecules that, when recognized by plant receptors, launch the symbiotic process. The core of NF is synthesized by proteins encoded by the nodABC genes, whereas the rest of the nod genes protein products are involved in the decoration of NF with different chemical substituents and their export to the environment. Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899, the microsymbiont of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), is characterized for tolerating multiple physical stresses and for synthesizing a large variety of NF not only in the presence of inducing flavonoids but also when high concentrations of salt are present. In addition, another interesting feature of the R. tropici CIAT 899 genome is the presence of three different nodA genes on the symbiotic plasmid, although their exact roles remain to be elucidated. In this work, we characterize the role of the three NodA proteins of R. tropici CIAT 899 in symbiosis. Methods: We have analyzed by quantitative PCR the expression of the nodA1, nodA2 and nodA3 genes of CIAT 899, showing that only nodA1 and nodA2 are inducible by flavonoids. We have also constructed single, double and triple non-polar mutants in these genes in order to study their importance in NF production and in nodulation of four different host legumes of CIAT 899: P. vulgaris, Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus japonicus, and L. burttii. Results: The nodA1 and nodA2 genes of CIAT 899 (both inducible by flavonoids) are more related between them than with nodA3 (non-flavonoid inducible). Interestingly, the presence of NodA1 or NodA3 is crucial for nodulation with L. leucocephala and L. japonicus, since both NodA1 or NodA3 guarantee Nod factor production upon apigenin induction. Interestingly, osmotic-stressing conditions increase the quantity and diversity of the Nod factors synthesized by NodA2, being these molecules able to induce the formation of nodule primordia on P. vulgaris. Conclusions: We concluded that R. tropici CIAT 899 requires at least the flavonoid-induced nodA1 or the flavonoid-independent nodA3 genes for ensuring symbiotic success in the four assayed host-legumes. The inducible nodA2 gene is sufficient to induce nodulation on P. vulgaris and L. burttii but not in L. leucocephala and L. japonicus. To our knowledge, in this work we report for the first time that a non-flavonoid inducible copy of nodA is enough to induce nodulation on legumes. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Propagule supply and habitat suitability strongly influence the success of invasive alien plants. Thus, an invaded area is likely to have an adequate propagule supply, a suitable habitat, or both for species persistence. Based on this idea, we classified invaded areas into four categories as follows but with establishment still occurring in some cases: Class 1, adequate propagule supply and habitat suitability; Class 2, adequate propagule supply but limited habitat suitability; Class 3, limited propagule supply and adequate habitat suitability; and Class 4, mid-to lowlevel propagule supply and habitat suitability. We propose a framework for the classification of invaded areas into these four classes and present a case study in which this framework was applied. Classifying target areas in this manner could facilitate more efficient and practical management planning, thereby saving time and resources. We selected the alien shrub Leucaena leucocephala L. (Fabaceae) as a model species, which has invaded the Nakodo-jima Island in the Ogasawara Archipelago of Japan. We developed a species distribution model by incorporating proxy variables for propagule supply and habitat suitability as well as submodels for propagule supply or habitat suitability. Using these submodels, we estimated the levels of propagule supply and habitat suitability in each, and classified the current distribution range appropriately. Using these classifications, land managers could set priorities to concentrate their efforts to efficiently control target species. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Cell wall architecture of tension wood fibres represents a suitable biological system to study the mechanism of growth and maintenance of posture of trees growing under various physical and physiological growth constraints. In the present study, we investigated the spatial distributions of β-(1–4)-D-galactan, xyloglucan and xylans (both less and highly substituted) in the opposite and tension wood fibres of bent Leucaena leucocephala by immunolabelling with monoclonal antibodies LM5, CCRCM1, LM10 and LM11 specific to these carbohydrate epitopes. The presence of non-lignified, tertiary wall layer is the typical tension wood characteristic associated with the reaction xylem fibres in Leucaena. LM5 labelling of opposite fibres showed weak labelling in the cell walls indicating less concentration of β-(1–4)-D-galactans while tension wood showed strong labelling in the tertiary wall layer suggesting the gelatinous layer (G-layer) has a strong cross linking with β-(1–4)-D-galactans. Xyloglucan distribution was more in the compound middle lamellae and the primary wall-S1 layer boundary of tension wood fibres as compared to that of opposite wood. A weak labelling was also evident near the boundary between the G-layer and the secondary wall of tension wood fibres. The secondary wall of opposite and tension wood fibres showed a strong distribution of both ls ACG Xs (LM10) and hs ACG Xs (LM11) while a weak labelling was noticed in the compound middle lamella. Tension wood fibres also showed strong xylan labelling mainly confined to the lignified secondary walls while the G-layer showed weak xylan labelling. In conclusion, our results suggest that β-(1–4)-D-galactans and xyloglucans could be implicated in the tensile stress generation within the G-layer of tension wood fibres of Leucaena leucocephala. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS

TI  - Effects and mechanisms of revegetation modes on cadmium and lead pollution in artificial soil on railway rock-cut slopes
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049807488&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2018.06.380&partnerID=40&md5=0eff286b5ade427715c914c131145572
AB  -                              Artificial soil on railway rock-cut slopes may be considerably contaminated with cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), which may migrate to nearby croplands and pose substantial risks to human and animal health. We investigate the influence of three types of revegetation modes – herbs (HS); herbs and shrubs (HSS); and herbs, shrubs, and trees (HSTS) – on the transportation of these heavy metals in soils. Six representative rock-cut slopes were chosen, and the vegetation, pollutant concentration, phytostabilization, and simulated rainfall were investigated. The results indicated that Cd posed a considerable ecological risk, while Pb posed a low ecological risk in the artificial soil. The erosion of artificial soil on the slopes played a primary role in the migration of Cd and Pb, because 87–91% of Cd and 85–89% of Pb was lost in sediments. Revegetation modes significantly affected the transportation of Cd and Pb. HSTS controlled a lot of Cd in their dominant plants among the three revegetation modes. HSTS not only decreased enrichment factor (EF) and ecological risk (E                             r                             ) values of Cd in the soils, but also decreased runoff, sediment and cumulative migrated Cd and Pb. The relationships among multi-factors were analyzed by stepwise mediation effect test and the results indicated that root weight density, aboveground biomass and immobilization of dominant plants for Cd and Pb were important direct factors which influenced the transportation of Cd and Pb. Overall, HSTS has proven to be beneficial in controlling the migration of Cd and Pb to croplands near the slopes and reducing their environmental risk. These results can offer a tested and implementable solution for mitigating the risks posed by these pollutants around the quickly expanding railways in the study region.                          © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Prediction of in situ ruminal degradability of forages in Buffaloes using the in vitro gas production technique

AB  - Two experiments, namely the situ nylon bag technique and the in vitro gas production technique, were carried out to determine the correlations between the in situ ruminal degradability and the in vitro gas production of different forages, and to predict the ruminal degradability of the forages using the gas production parameters. Forage samples from Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), Guinea grass (Panicum maximum), Para grass (Brachiaria mutica), Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), Rain tree (Samanea saman), and Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) were incubated in the rumen of three rumen-cannulated buffaloes using the in situ nylon bag technique for 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. The six forage samples were also subjected to the in vitro gas production analysis following the modified methods developed by Menke & Steingass (1988), along with 30 other commonly used forages in the Philippines. Both experiments followed a randomized complete block design. Their dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and crude protein (CP) degradation kinetics and effective degradability (ED) as well as the gas production parameters were then estimated. Results revealed that the ED of each nutrient was found to be moderately to strongly correlated with some of the gas production times and estimated gas parameters. The predictor models generated using the gas production parameters for the ED of DM, OM, and NDF were sufficiently strong (R2= 0.740, p value= 0.0002; R2= 0.659, p value= 0.0009; and R2= 0.813, p value < 0.0001, respectively) while that of CP was only moderate (R2= 0.500, p value= 0.0055). It was concluded that the relationship between the two techniques is sufficiently strong and therefore the gas production parameters can be used to predict the in situ ruminal nutrient degradability of forages. © 2019, Tropical Animal Science Journal.

TI  - Testing rensch’s rule in Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus, a seed-feeding beetle infesting Leucaena leucocephala plants

AB  - Rensch’s rule states that males vary more in size than females when body size increases. The main cause of Rensch’s rule has been credited to sexual selection. However, different degrees of plasticity between the sexes have also been proven to be useful for describing variations in sexual size dimorphism, particularly within an intraspecific context. For insects, in general, this rule has rarely been tested within species. Here, we tested whether Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer, 1907) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) followed Rensch’s rule when individuals emerged from seeds immediately after fruit collection and when they were reared for one generation, by measuring three morphological traits. Rensch’s rule was not followed for any of the morphological traits. Variations in body size were similar in males and females for bruchines that first emerged from seeds and for those that were reared for one generation. These findings suggest that environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, and seasonality) are unlikely to drive differential plasticity in males and females of this seed-feeding beetle. It is possible that changes in the body size of A. macrophthalmus have a genetic basis. However, regardless of whether variations in body size have a genetic basis, our findings provide no support for Rensch’s rule. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the allelopathic effect of aqueous extracts of leaves of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) R. de Wit. and Hovenia dulcis Thunb. on germination and early development of Mimosa bimucronata DC Kuntze and Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.). Extracts were prepared in dilution of 2.5%; 5%; 7.5% and 10% (w/v) and compared to the control. Both extracts revealed allelopathic potential on seed germination and initial growth of M. bimucronata. No negative interference of extracts from the donor species was observed on the germination of P. dubium. However, seedlings subjected to L. leucocephala extract suffered interference in the initial development, resulting in the elongation of the radicle to be more sensitive to the effects of the extracts. Thus, the results showed that aqueous extracts of the leaves of L. leucocephala and H. dulcis have inhibitory properties on germination and early development of M. bimucronata, as well as and early development of P. dubium. © 2019 Fundacao Zoobotanica do Rio Grande do Sul.

TI  - Local knowledge regarding ecosystem services and disservices from invasive alien plants in the arid Kalahari, South Africa
PY  - 2018

AB  - Across the globe, many invasive alien plants were purposefully introduced because of their usefulness. These plants continue to provide multiple goods and services, such as fodder, fuelwood, medicines, fruits, shade and aesthetic appeal. However, as they invade negative impacts arise. This often leads to conflicts of interests and trade-offs between the benefits and costs of these species and, ultimately, the environment and local livelihoods. Traditionally, invasive plant species research in dryland systems has tended to focus on the impacts of these species on large-scale natural systems, primarily rangelands and river courses. Limited work has been undertaken regarding the role of these species in providing services and disservices within homesteads and settlements in these harsh environments. Such knowledge is important with regards to management. The primary aim of this study was therefore to assess the assimilation of invasive plant species into the lives of households in several small farming settlements in the arid Kalahari region of the Northern Cape, South Africa. Specific objectives were to: 1) assess the diversity, prevalence and size structure of invasive plants in resident's homesteads; 2) identify sources, local practices, knowledge and beliefs related to the invasive plants present as well as local management practices; and 3) understand residents' perceptions of the ecosystem services and disservices these species deliver. To do this, we used household and ‘drive-past’ surveys, in-depth interviews and measurement of plants in homesteads. From the ‘drive-past’ survey, we identified 12 officially listed and one proposed invasive plant species in the settlements, 10 of which were covered in the household survey. Eight native tree species were also present, but these were at much lower frequency and density than introduced species. Thirteen different goods and services from the invasive plants were recognised with the most common being shade, aesthetics and fuelwood. Some species, such as Morus alba and Opuntia ficus-indica, were important for fruit, while eight species were mentioned as being used for fodder. Respondents also mentioned that O. ficus-indica, Prosopis spp., Leucaena leucocephala and Melia azedarach imposed costs. These disservices included reductions in water supply, damage to buildings and human health impacts. Some of these species were also perceived to be spreading beyond homesteads in some settlements and invading rangeland. Less than a quarter of households had no invasive plants in their yards, and these were mainly new dwellings in the growing informal areas around the settlements. Invasive plants were obtained from variety of sources suggesting various pathways of introduction. We conclude by discussing some options for management focusing on Prosopis, as the invasive plant perceived to most rapidly expanding and generating the most disservices. We also highlight what further research is needed with regard to filling research gaps on invasive plant species within social-ecological systems in arid areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of a semi-automated tool for measurement of digital images obtained by the X-ray test in seed lots of Leucaena leucocephala and their relationship to seed physiological quality. Seeds were collected from five mother trees in Viçosa, MG. The study was performed through analysis of radiographic images of the seeds. It was determined the percentage of damaged seeds (predation and fungi) and measured: the area, perimeter, circularity, relative density, and integrated density of the seeds. After the X-ray test, a germination test was performed on the seeds, from which ten variables related to seed physiological quality were extracted, including a vigor index. The use of semi-automated measurement tools associated with the X-ray test was effective for evaluating the internal morphology of Leucaena leucocephala seeds, and the variables determined are related to seed physiological quality. © 2019, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

PY  - 2019

AB  - During their lifecycle, from free-living soil bacteria to endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteroids of legumes, rhizobia must colonize, and cope with environments where nutrient concentrations and compositions vary greatly. Bacterial colonization of legume rhizospheres and of root surfaces is subject to a fierce competition for plant exudates. By contrast root nodules offer to rhizobia sheltered nutrient-rich environments within which the cells that successfully propagated via infection threads can rapidly multiply. To explore the effects on symbiosis of a slower rhizobia growth and metabolism, we deleted one or two copies of the three functional rRNA operons of the promiscuous Sinorhizobium fredii strain NGR234 and examined the impact of these mutations on free-living and symbiotic lifestyles. Strains with two functional rRNA operons (NGRδrRNA1 and NGRδrRNA3) grew almost as rapidly as NGR234, and NGRδrRNA1 was as proficient as the parent strain on all of the five legume species tested. By contrast, the NGRδrRNA1,3 double mutant, which carried a single rRNA operon and grew significantly slower than NGR234, had a reduced symbiotic proficiency on Cajanus cajan, Macroptilium atropurpureum, Tephrosia vogelii, and Vigna unguiculata. In addition, while NGRδrRNA1 and NGR234 equally competed for nodulation of V. unguiculata, strain NGRδrRNA1,3 was clearly outcompeted by wild-type. Surprisingly, on Leucaena leucocephala, NGRδrRNA1,3 was the most proficient strain and competed equally NGR234 for nodule occupation. Together, these results indicate that for strains with otherwise identical repertoires of symbiotic genes, a faster growth on roots and/or inside plant tissues may contribute to secure access to nodules of some hosts. By contrast, other legumes such as L. leucocephala appear as less selective and capable of providing symbiotic environments susceptible to accommodate strains with a broader spectrum of competences. ©2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of cutting age on the production, chemical composition, degradation kinetics and anatomy of Leucena (Leucaena leucocephala). The experimental design was a completely randomized design with a factorial arrangement 2x4 (two types of tissues and four cutting ages) for the production data of dry matter and 3x4 (three degrees of degrees of digestion of tissues and four cutting ages). Observed effect (P<0.05) for the total production of DM of Leucena in function of different ages. The tissue types grain and non-grain showed maximum production at 70 days of age, with production of 2333,00 and 716.60 kg DM ha-1, respectively. The parameters of degradation of DM evaluated decreased significantly with the increase in the maturity of the plant, in the same way the chemical composition presented behavior inherent to the advance of age. The effective degradability DM also decreased with the increase in the rate of passage (2, 5, and 8% h-1). The highest rate of degradation (c) was obtained for 30 days. With the advance in plant maturity increases the proportion of vascular tissue lignificad influencing parameters of ruminal degradation of Leucena. The ages assessed influenced the chemical composition of the Leucena (P<0.05), where the levels of dry matter, crude protein, acid detergent fiber and lignin and ash showed increasing linear behavior. The cutting age of 70 days offers an optimal point regarding the proportion of anatomical tissues correlated with the degradation and chemical composition of the Leucena. © 2019 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

TI  - Quantifying ruminal fermentation and methane production using the in vitro gas technique in the forages of a sheep silvopastoral system in Chiapas, Mexico

AB  - Ruminal fermentation and methane production in a sheep silvopastoral system were quantified with the in vitro gas production technique. Evaluations were done of local energy sources (molasses, Zea mays L. and Musa paradisiaca L.), of the base forage (Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania), of forage tree foliage (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) and Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham), and diets combining these elements. Ruminal fluid was collected from five sheep (Pelibuey x Katahdin; 40 ± 3 kg). Five treatments (diets) containing different mixtures of forage tree foliage, energy sources and the base forage were analyzed in a completely random experimental design. Maximum gas volume production (V) was observed in M. paradisiaca (544 ml/g-1 DM) and Z. mays (467 ml/g-1 DM) (P≤0.05). The lowest V values were for the foliage of G. sepium (253 ml/g-1 DM) and L. leucocephala (180 ml/g-1 DM) (P≤0.05). Of the diets, D4GMP (48% P. maximum, 30% G. sepium, 7% Z. mays, 15% M. paradisiaca) had the highest V value. Methane production ranged from 6.31 to 9.60 L/Kg digested DM, and did not differ between treatments (P>0.05). Data were used to generate a potential fermentable gases emission index, which suggested that the diets containing slow fermenting carbohydrates resulted in higher gas emission rates. Inclusion of forage trees and local energy sources in sheep silvopastoral management systems can improve diet quality and contribute to reducing CH4 emissions. © 2019 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

AB  - The Leucaena genus is made up of 24 different species (19 diploid and 5 tetraploid species). However, early use of the Leucaena genus in agricultural systems was based entirely upon a very narrow germplasm base. A single genotype of Leucaena leucocephala ssp. leucocephala ('common' leucaena) was spread pantropically from its center of origin in Mexico over 400 years ago. Genetic improvement of Leucaena leucocephala began in the 1950s, when vigorous 'giant' leucaena (L. leucocephala ssp. glabrata) was identified in Australia and Hawaii. Cultivars such as Hawaiian Giant K8, Peru and El Salvador were selected and promoted for grazing in Australia and multipurpose agroforestry uses throughout the tropics. Plant breeding for improved forage production resulted in the release of cv. Cunningham in 1976 in Australia. These cultivars of 'giant' Leucaena leucocephala displayed broad environmental adaptability, with the exception of poor tolerance of cold temperatures (and frost) and acid soils. The outbreak of the psyllid insect pest (Heteropsylla cubana) from Cuba during the 1980s devastated both 'common' and 'giant' leucaena all around the world. This challenge resulted in renewed interest in lesser-known Leucaena spp. that exhibited tolerance to the pest and in interspecific hybridization as a means of developing new cultivars. Some 'giant' leucaena lines exhibited excellent agronomic traits and a degree of tolerance to the psyllid pest and this resulted in the release of new cultivars in Australia (cvv. Tarramba and Wondergraze) and Hawaii (cv. LxL). Since the 1990s, plant breeding programs have sought to develop cultivars with greater psyllid tolerance using interspecific hybridization. This has resulted in the release of cv. 'KX2-Hawaii' for timber and forage production, and a backcrossed forage cultivar cv. Redlands (Australia). Both cultivars are based upon interspecific hybridization between L. pallida and L. leucocephala ssp. glabrata. Cold-temperature and acid-soil tolerance have been pursued in South American breeding programs based upon L. diversifolia, without commercial success. The development of sterile Leucaena spp. cultivars is currently underway to nullify the environmental weed potential of all current commercial cultivars. Tolerance to cold temperatures (L. diversifolia, L. pallida, L. pulverulenta and L. trichandra), frost (L. greggii and L. retusa) and psyllids (L. collinsii) exists within the Leucaena genus and may be exploited in future hybridization programs. New genetic analyses and molecular plant breeding techniques have the potential to facilitate further gene transfer between Leucaena spp. for the development of the next generation of multipurpose cultivars. © 2019.

AB  - This study examined the effects of diets with two protein sources (oilseed cake meal (OSCM) and Leucaena leucocephala hay) on the performance of lactating goats that were fed a total mixed ration (TMR). Thirty Saanen milk goats were divided into two groups, which were fed one of the two TMRS, with or without Leucaena hay at 25% of the DM. The TMRs were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous, iso-energetic and iso-neutral detergent fibre, while using two sources of crude protein, namely i) Leucaena hay; and ii) oilseed cake meal OSCM from soybean, sunflower, and cottonseed. No significant differences were revealed in body condition score, bodyweight change, milk yield and milk composition, such as milk fat (%), milk lactose (%), somatic cell count (x 103 cells/mL) and milk protein (%) during the entire lactation period. In contrast, goats fed the TMR with Leucaena hay had a lower milk urea nitrogen (mg nitrogen/dL) level than those fed the control diet (with OSCM). It was concluded that replacing a proportion of oilseed cake meal with Leucaena in Saanen milk goats fed TMR does not negatively influence milk production and composition. © South African Society for Animal Science.

AB  - A study was conducted during 2013-2017 to evaluate the potential of 5 cultivars/experimental lines of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) at 2 sites in Northern Inland NSW. In this frost-prone, summer-dominant rainfall region, all cultivars/lines established well and survival was > 70% at Bingara and > 95% at Manilla. Cultivars Wondergraze and Cunningham were the most productive, producing up to approximately 2.4 t DM/ha and 1.9 t DM/ha per growing season at Bingara and Manilla, respectively. Tropical grass establishment in the alleys was poor with plant productivity inversely related to leucaena productivity. Although this study has confirmed the persistence and productive potential of leucaena, the challenges around tropical grass establishment and persistence as well as the weed potential of leucaena in this region need to be addressed before broad-scale use could be recommended in Northern Inland NSW. © 2019.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass containing cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin is significantly analyzed via methods from infrared to microscopy. These methods help researchers to explore the organic or inorganic functional groups and physical surface impacts microscopically on the particles of the pretreated biomass. Some concerns arise in understanding the data results. An investigation with the presence of ionic liquids on Leucaena Leucocephala (Petai Belalang), Acacia Auriculiformis and Melastoma Malabathricum (Senduduk) are reported via the results of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrum (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The model ionic liquids as green solvents used are 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium Acetate (EMIMAc) and 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium Chloride (EMIMCl). This work is very essential to sustain preliminary reliable understanding on the chemical and physical effects on lignocellulosic biomass during pretreatment with solvents. © 2019 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

AB  - The increasing demand of organic products of improved quality has become a priority to meet customer needs. Nine different organic material were studied to determine the suitable composition for liquid organic fertilizer. The study was conducted as a pot trial to evaluate the effect of liquid organic fertilizer on organic tomato yield. The study reported that Leucaena leucocephala had great potential as nitrogen source, Pennisetum purpureum and goat manure for phosphorus, and rabbit manure had the highest amount of potassium content. The applications of liquid organic fertilizer made from these materials increased the tomato growth and yield compared to control. Application of 75 % organic manure + 20 mL L-1 liquid organic fertilizer improved the tomato yield by 83 % and increased the vitamin C content (66 %) than the control. © 2019 Society for Advancement of Horticulture.

TI  - An in vitro approach to evaluate the nutraceutical value of plant foliage against Haemonchus contortus
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055472354&doi=10.1007%2fs00436-018-6107-0&partnerID=40&md5=c48819e3f27a4ff50934e407fe48e2dc
AB  - Nutraceutical plants provide nutrients for the animal as well as secondary compounds that can affect the biology and survival of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN). Current screening of nutraceutical plants is based on in vitro evidence of anthelmintic (AH) activity against different life stages of GIN, but nutritional information is omitted or scarce. This study proposes an integral in vitro screening protocol to identify the nutraceutical value of the foliage from plant species consumed by small ruminants, using Haemonchus contortus as a biological model. The leaves from Acacia collinsii, A. pennatula, Bunchosia swartziana, Gymnopodium floribundum, Havardia albicans, Leucaena leucocephala, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Mimosa bahamensis, Piscidia piscipula, and Senegalia gaumeri were evaluated for their chemical composition and in vitro digestibility. Acetone:water extracts (70:30) from leaves of each plant were evaluated using the egg hatch assay and larval exsheathment inhibition assay. Respective effective concentrations 50% (EC50) were determined for each assay. The ten plant species showed good nutritional value for ruminants, including crude protein (> 10%), metabolizable energy (> 2.9 MJ/kg DM), and varied CT content (from 1.0 to 37.6%). The best AH activity against H. contortus eggs (EC50 = 401.8 μg/mL) and L3 (EC50 = 83.1 μg/mL) was observed for S. gaumeri extract. Although all the plant species showed in vitro nutraceutical potential, the leaves of S. gaumeri had the best values. The proposed in vitro protocol showed to be useful for the integral assessment of the nutraceutical potential of different plant species as it included the nutritional value and the AH activity against eggs and L3 in the selected plant species. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize the performance of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) to assess its use as a potential bioethanol or biofuels through pretreatment process. The pretreatment process was performed to remove crystalline structural of biomasses in order to improve enzymatic hydrolysis process. In this work, combined electron beam irradiation and ionic liquid method was used as the pretreatment process for various LCBs such as Gigantochloa albociliata (GA), Leucaena leucocephala (LL), oil palm frond (OPF), acacia and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) as reference. Irradiation dose was measured through electron beam accelerator over a range of 100-1000 kGy. Ionic liquid (IL) is known as green solvent that can dissolve cellulose. 50% v/v 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIMAc) IL was employed to enhance the effect of irradiation in pretreatment process. The LCBs was analyzed by using two method; Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). FTIR result shows different pattern of spectra and peak for each condition. Lateral order index (LOI) based on Beer’s Law was also calculated to determine the changes in structure order after pretretament. For XRD results, the crystallinity index (CrI) of pretreated LCBs was calculated by using Segal’s Equation in order to determine the pattern based on different conditions. The highest percentage of effectiveness showed by pretreated Acacia as the values of LOI and CrI is the lowest compared to other LCBs which is 41.77% and 25.21%, respectively. © 2019 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

TI  - Impact of continuous organic manuring on mechanisms and processes of the stabilisation of soil organic C under rice-wheat cropping system
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074169125&doi=10.1071%2fSR19014&partnerID=40&md5=0953c8aa90478a1bbfb50deed403a44b
AB  - Understanding the mechanism of soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilisation may help in developing management strategies for SOC storage. A long-term organically managed rice-wheat cropping system was used for SOC stabilisation study. Soil samples were collected from control, FYM (farmyard manure to rice and wheat), GM (green manure Sesbania aculeata to rice and Leucaena leucocephala to wheat), GB (GM with biofertiliser blue green algae to rice and Azotobacter sp. to wheat), GF (GM with FYM), GFB (GM with FYM and biofertiliser). Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)-resistant C correlated significantly with ammonium oxalate and dithionate extractable Fe, Al and Si in soil. The GFB showed the highest enrichment of SOC (32%) as well as NaOCl-resistant C (22%) at 0-15 cm soil depth. At higher soil depth, GM alone showed the highest enrichment of SOC (39% at 15-30 cm, 84% at 30-60 cm). The NaOCl-resistant C was higher in FYM and GFB treatments at 15-30 and 30-60 cm depths respectively. The proportion of NaOCl-resistant C to SOC increased down the profile and was highest (30-52%) in 30-60 cm soil depth. A multiple regression model developed between ammonium oxalate extractable Fe, Al and Si and SOC could well predict the stable SOC content. There was a substantial improvement in prediction when extractable Fe, Al and Si were combined together. Among the organic treatments, GFB showed the highest humification and aromaticity in humic acid with least polarity and more reduced form. The combination of all the organic sources (GFB) could be a promising nutrient management strategy for enhancing the stability of SOC in rice-wheat cropping systems of semiarid subtropical India. © 2020 CSIRO.

AB  - This review describes the history of research in Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) feeding systems carried out by the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) over the last 5 decades and discusses the main limitations resulting in poor adoption in Argentina. Leucaena was introduced in the subtropical region of the north of the country in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Since then, INTA has conducted research to evaluate forage and animal productivity, leucaena accessions, rhizobial strains, contribution to soil carbon and total nitrogen and density effects on competition and other ecosystem interactions in silvopastoral systems. In spite of the convincing research results showing the excellent potential of leucaena to increase forage quality and animal production in suitable areas, there has been poor adoption of this forage tree legume on a broad scale. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - raditional fruit homegardens are units of production of high richness of species with value in use. The objective was to analyze the relationship between the arboreal structure of 30 homegardens of Coatetelco, Morelos and the value in use of the species. The structure was quantified through the Importance Value Index (IVI). The Cultural Value Index (CVI) identified the preference of the community. The arboreal variety includes 24 botanical families, 49 genera and 65 species; 45 % were introduced and 55 % were native of America from which 23 % belonged to dry tropical deciduous forest. Ecologically and culturally, the most important species are the multiple use ones (Leucaena leucocephala, and L. esculenta), self-supply and sale ones (Mangifera indica, and Citrus x aurantium), and the ones produced during dry season (Spondias purpurea and Pithecellobium dulce). The size of homegardens, specific richness and density are positively related. Importance value and cultural value index correlated 86 %. The structure of the homegardens was organized because of cultural reasons. The preferred species are the ones with the highest value in use. Native trees such as Amphipterygium adstringens, Swietenia humilis, Jacaratia mexicana, Enterolobium cyclocarpum and also some other species introduced as Citrus maxima, Ficus carica and Moringa oleifera which could be lost because of lack of space. © 2019 Universidad Autonoma Chapingo.

PY  - 2019

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) cv. Tarramba was first introduced to eastern Indonesia (East and West Nusa Tenggara Provinces) as part of an ACIAR project in 2001?2003. Its superior value was recognized immediately as it: was preferred by cattle over local leucaena; was less affected by psyllids; provided better dry season growth; and produced poles suitable for construction. In on-farm Bali bull feeding demonstrations, Tarramba leucaena doubled weight gains compared with traditional practices, enabling the most progressive farmers to win local bull-fattening competitions. Owing to strong demand for seed, the East Nusa Tenggara Assessment Institute for Agriculture Technology, in collaboration with the Provincial Livestock Department, assisted smallholders to establish seed orchards to ensure that professionally produced and packaged Tarramba seed was available for commercial sale. By the end of the ACIAR involvement, approximately 2,000 kg of Tarramba seed had been distributed to farmers, in addition to farmer-to-farmer seed sales. Approximately 800,000 ha of land in East Nusa Tenggara Province is suitable for Tarramba leucaena so the potential for this legume to contribute to beef production in the region is huge. Tarramba is now contributing to forage development in other parts of Indonesia as well as in Timor-Leste. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - Objective. To determine the effectiveness of mycorrhizal-arbuscular fungi (AMF) of soils with different agricultural uses, in the middle valley of the Sinú river, Colombia . Materials and methods. The experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions, where Leucaena leucocephala was used as the indicator plant, which was planted in masons with an Andisol soil (horizon B) used as a substrate. This substrate was inoculated separately with samples from seven soils (Ap horizon), as a source of AMF, from the Turipaná Research Center in Agrosavia. As controls we included inoculation with HMA Glomus fasciculatum and one non-inoculated one. The effect of mycorrhizal inoculation was evaluated by monitoring the foliar P content in L. leucocephala plants, as a function of time to 64 days, when the dry mass of its aerial part and mycorrhizal colonization was determined. Results. The growth of L. leucocephala and the foliar P content was significantly higher when the soil was inoculated with G. fasciculatum, in comparison to that observed with the other treatments. Likewise, mycorrhizal colonization was very high in the roots of L. leucocephala that grew in the soil inoculated with G. fasciculatum and lower in the other treatments. Conclusions. The results indicate that the native AMF of soils with different uses, from Turipaná, exhibited low potential to develop mycorrhizal symbiosis, which limited the growth and concentration of leaf P in the host plant. © The Author(s), Journal MVZ Cordoba 2019.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is an invasive exotic tree plant, and because of these characteristics, it becomes an environmental problem. In this sense, the main objective of the present study was to evaluate the adsorption capacity of 5G blue dye, using dry L. leucocephala leaves under different temperatures. Drying kinetic, centesimal composition and micrographs after drying of the leaves were also evaluated. For drying, the Valcan model best described the process kinetics, presenting a correlation coefficient of 99.4% and an average error of 1.41%. For the centesimal composition, 3.9% of moisture, 7.5% of ash, 23.8% of crude protein, 29.5% of crude fiber, 3.9% of ethereal stratum and 31.4% of soluble carbohydrate were obtained. In the evaluation of the adsorptive capacity, the temperature of 40 °C was the one that produced the largest adsorbed amount of dye mass/leaf mass, 9.4 mg g-1. The qualitative results obtained agreed with the one observed in the micrographs, so that the leaves of L. leucocephala have, therefore, industrial application with biosorbent. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Departamento de Quimica.

AB  - In Australia's central and southern Queensland regions, Leucaena leucocephala-grass pastures produce substantially more beef and higher profits than grass-only pastures and annual forage crops. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a rapid and cost-effective approach to assessing quality of available forage as well as the quality of the diet selected by cattle, but existing calibrations have not been comprehensively validated for leucaena-grass pastures. This study examined the reliability of existing northern Australian calibrations for NIRS to predict the crude protein (CP) concentration of the edible fraction of the leucaena plant, and the proportion of leucaena in the diet of grazing cattle. Samples of edible leucaena and cattle feces were analyzed by NIRS and the predictions plotted in a linear regression and fitted to a 1:1 line with Dumas analysis of CP for leucaena forage, and mass spectrometry of δ13C for cattle feces. Results demonstrated that prediction of the CP concentration of leucaena forage and the proportion of leucaena in the diet of grazing cattle using current broad northern Australian NIRS forage calibrations were associated with substantial error. However, it is likely that these errors can be reduced with the inclusion in the calibration data set of more samples representing leucaena forage and feces of cattle grazing leucaena from varying locations, seasonal conditions and management strategies. © 2019.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted at the research farm of ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India during summer and rainy (kharif) seasons of 2015 and 2016 to study the effect of in-situ and ex-situ green manuring crops and zinc fertilization strategy on growth, yield attributes and productivity of Basmati rice (Oryza sativa L.). The experiment was conducted in a split-plot design, keeping 2 in-situ green manuring crops viz. Sesbania aculeata Poir (dhaincha) and Vigna umbellata Thunb. (rice bean), 1 ex-situ green manuring crop viz. Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) and summer fallow as main-plot treatments and 4 zinc (Zn) fertilization treatments viz. 5 kg Zn through chelated Zn-EDTA as soil application, 2.5 kg Zn through chelated Zn-EDTA as soil application + 1 foliar application of 0.5% solution of chelated Zn-EDTA at flowering, foliar application of 0.5% solution of chelated Zn-EDTA at active tillering + flowering + grain filling, foliar application of 0.5% solution of chelated Zn- EDTA at 20, 40, 60 and 80 days after transplanting (DAT) and a control (no Zn) in sub-plots and was replicated thrice. Results showed that the incorporation of Sesbania aculeata green manure @ 34.7 t/ha (based on fresh weight) prior to transplanting of Basmati rice (based on mean of 2 years) produced higher growth parameters, viz. plant height, effective tillers, dry-matter; yield attributes, viz. panicle length, panicle weight and 1,000-grain weight, correlation between yield and yield attributes and yields than Vigna umbellata, Leucaena leucocephala and summer fallow. Foliar application of 0.5% solution of chelated Zn-EDTA at 20, 40, 60 and 80 DAT was better than soil application of Zn with regard to growth parameters and grain yield (5.1 t/ha), correlation between yield and yield attributes like grain yield and panicle length (91.3%), grain yield and panicle weight (75.5%) of Basmati rice. Incorporation of Sesbania aculeata green manure generated highest net income (43.0 × 103/ha) among green manure treatments, while among Zn application treatments application of 0.5% solution of chelated Zn-EDTA at 20, 40, 60 and 80 DAT fetched the highest net returns (64.9 × 103/ha) from basmati rice cultivation. © 2018, Indian Society of Agronomy.

AB  - The perennial legume leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) is grown across the subtropics for a variety of purposes including livestock fodder. Livestock in Australia emit a significant proportion of the methane produced by the agriculture sector and there is increasing pressure to decrease emissions from beef cattle production systems. In addition to direct productivity gains for livestock, leucaena has been shown to lower enteric methane production, suggesting an opportunity for emissions mitigation and Commonwealth Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) methodology development, where leucaena browse is adopted for high value beef production. Determining the proportion of leucaena in the diet may be one of the more challenging aspects in attributing mitigation. Current enteric emission relationships for cattle consuming mixed grass-leucaena diets are based on intensive respiration chamber work. Herd-scale methane flux has also been determined using open path laser methodologies and may be used to validate an on-farm herd-scale methodology for leucaena feeding systems. The methodology should also address increased potential for soil organic carbon storage by leucaena grazing systems, and changes in nitrous oxide production. This paper outlines the background, justification, eligibility requirements and potential gaps in research for an emissions quantification protocol that will lead to the adoption of a leucaena methodology by the Australian beef industry. Development of a methodology would be supported by research conducted in Australia. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

TI  - Quality of leucaena, gliricidia, and pornunça silages with different old man saltbush levels
PY  - 2019

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the quality of leucaena, gliricidia, and pornunça silages with different levels of old man saltbush inclusion in their composition. A completely randomized design was used with five levels of old man saltbush (Atriplex nummularia) inclusion (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%) in leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), and pornunça (Manihot sp.) silages, with 5 replications per treatment, totaling 75 experimental mini-silos maintained in a covered shed and free of opportunistic animals. Silos were opened after 100 days of ensilage, and the silage of the first 15 cm of their ends was discarded. The remaining material was homogenized and sampled for determining the bromatological composition, in vitro digestibility, and fermentation profile. Old man saltbush inclusion levels in leucaena silages promoted a negative linear effect for dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, ethereal extract, pH, and ammoniacal nitrogen, while a positive linear effect was found for mineral matter, in vitro dry matter digestibility, total carbohydrates, non-fibrous carbohydrates, and propionic acid (P < 0.05). This silage also had a quadratic effect for lactic acid. Gliricidia silages showed a positive linear behavior for dry matter, mineral matter, and total carbohydrates, whereas organic matter, crude protein, and ethereal extract presented a negative linear behavior (P < 0.05). The contents of organic lactic, acetic, and propionic acids showed a quadratic effect for gliricidia silage as old man saltbush levels increased (P < 0.05). Regarding pornunça silage, dry matter, mineral matter, total carbohydrates, propionic acid, and butyric acid presented a linear increasing behavior, while organic matter, crude protein, ethereal extract, and non-fibrous carbohydrates presented a linear decreasing behavior (P < 0.05). Lactic acid and acetic acid concentrations for pornunça silage showed a quadratic behavior according to the increasing old man saltbush inclusion levels (P < 0.05). The highest contribution of old man saltbush in the silages promoted changes in the profile of organic acids, allowing an improvement in silage quality, favoring lactic fermentation rather than acetic fermentation. Butyric acid contents were low for all treatments and indicated the control of undesirable fermentation processes. These results indicate that old man saltbush inclusion in silage composition may contribute to bromatological composition and fermentation process of the studied silages. © 2019 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

AB  - The tick Rhipicephalus microplus is known to develop resistance against some commercial acaracides, driving a search for natural alternatives. An evaluation was done of the acaricide activity against adult and larval R. microplus of ethanol extracts from three Leucaena spp. genotypes: L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Native); L. leucocephala (Cunningham); and L. Leucocephala x L. padilla (KX2). Larval immersion and adult immersion tests were used to evaluate acaricide activity. Secondary metabolite profiles of the three genotypes were generated using analytical chromatographic plates. Against the larvae, the 50% extract concentration exhibited 91.68% mortality for the Cunningham genotype, 82.00% for the KX2 and 54.06% for the Native. The Native genotype extract was most effective against adults with a 50% mortality at a 20% concentration. Flavonoids and terpenes were identified in all three genotypes and are probably responsible for their acaricide activity. The Leucaena spp. Cunningham and KX2 extracts were effective against R. microplus larvae, but further research is needed to identify the metabolites that provide this acaricide activity, be it individually or synergistically. © 2019 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

AB  - This study examined the tunneling activity and the behaviour of two subterranean termites, Globitermes sulphurues and Coptotermes gestroi treated with four plant extracts, namely Pyllanthus niruri, Azadirachta indica, Leucaena leucocephala and Andrographis paniculata. All plants were extracted with three different solvents (methanol, hexane and water) and were diluted into three concentrations (500, 5,000 and 10,000 ppm). A group of 50 workers and 2 soldiers were tested and observed daily during the exposure in order to determine their survivorship and behaviour. Both sections were scored to determine their tunneling activities after seven days. There was a significant difference of tunneling activities of C. gestroi on sand treated with plant extracts (X2(2) = 31.790, p < 0.0001) with a mean rank of 8.50 for methanolic extracts and 32.50 for both hexane and water extracts. Meanwhile, no significant difference was observed on tunneling activity of G. sulphureus on treated sand (X2(2) = 2.200, p = 0.333) with a mean rank of 20.72 for methanolic extracts, 26.31 for water extracts and 26.47 for hexane extracts. Results showed that plants extracted with methanol demonstrated strong repellent properties with 0 tunneling activity on the treated sand and low survivorship of both termites. Moreover, both termites did not survive (0%) when they were treated with methanolic extracts at 10,000 ppm. They also displayed a different behaviour post-exposure such as avoidance, gradually losing the ability to walk and low feeding consumption. These results indicate that there is a strong termiticidal activity of plants extracted with methanol against C. gestroi and G. sulphureus. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2019.

AB  - Strategies to breed sterile leucaena for Western Australia include plant breeding and biotechnology tools to generate sterile lines at both the tetraploid and triploid ploidy levels. For tetraploids, the main target species is the commercial Leucaena leucocephala, that is well known for its potential as a high-quality, productive and persistent forage. Gene editing technologies (CRISPR) will be utilized to edit out flowering genes and develop a non-flowering L. leucocephala and/or create male/female genic sterile lines of L. leucocephala. For triploids, the strategy is to cross tetraploid species (L. leucocephala and/or L. diversifolia) with diploid species to generate sterile triploid hybrids. The diploid parents will include species that have good forage attributes such as L. collinsii, L. macrophylla, L. shannonii and L. pulverulenta. Several of these triploid crosses have already been created by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (Perth, Western Australia) and will be evaluated in the Kimberley and Pilbara regions of Western Australia for their agronomic performance and sterility. Vegetative propagation will be required for the tetraploid gene-edited non-flowering L. leucocephala. Triploids can either be vegetatively propagated, once generated, or generated via a seed production nursery. © 2019.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a nutritionally rich forage tree legume that contains a toxic non-protein amino acid, mimosine, from which other toxic compounds 3,4-dihydroxypyridone (3,4-DHP) and 2,3-DHP are formed in the rumen. The rumen bacterium Synergistes jonesii is able to degrade these DHP isomers into non-toxic end products. In this study we developed new PCR-based assays to improve the specificity and sensitivity of detection of S. jonesii in the rumen. Using these new assays in a survey of ruminants from different countries, S. jonesii appeared to be ubiquitous rather than isolated geographically. The bacterium was present as a minor population (< 106 cells/mL) in the rumen and was usually comprised of several genetic variants of the species. Although the indigenous nature of S. jonesii could imply animals are protected from toxicity, the relative abundance of the bacterium, potential variation in DHP-degrading ability of genetic variants, and amount of leucaena in the diet may determine the ability of the resident population in the rumen to protect the animal from toxicity. © 2019.

TI  - Identifying potential distributions of 10 invasive alien trees: implications for conservation management of protected areas

AB  - Tree invasion has the potential to negatively affect biodiversity and ecosystems, with invasive alien trees (IATs) expanding widely in protected areas (PAs) across different habitats. Thus, the effectiveness of PAs might be reduced. Investigation of the distributions of IAT is urgently required to improve the effective conservation management of PAs. We projected the potential distributions of 10 IATs, which included Acacia mearnsii, Ardisia elliptica, Cecropia peltata, Cinchona pubescens, Leucaena leucocephala, Melaleuca quinquenervia, Miconia calvescens, Morella faya, Prosopis glandulosa, and Spathodea campanulata, that have a serious influence on global biodiversity and assessed the distribution possibilities of these IATs in PAs based on the PA categories of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The overall potential distributions of these 10 IATs included Latin America, central and southern Africa, southeastern Asia, eastern Australia and New Zealand, and western Europe. Annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, annual precipitation, and soil bulk density were found to be important environmental variables for the potential distributions of these IATs. Overall, A. mearnsii, A. elliptica, C. peltata, L. leucocephala, M. quinquenervia, M. calvescens, and S. campanulata were distributed mainly in the IUCN PA categories of national parks and PAs with sustainable use of natural resources. We proposed the following for conservation management of PAs: (1) completion of species inventories for PAs, (2) better understanding of factors driving invasions in PAs, (3) assessment of the efficiency of management within particular PAs, and (4) evaluation of changes in trends regarding plant invasions in PAs under climate change conditions. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala ssp. glabrata) is a highly palatable and productive forage used mainly by beef producers on extensive properties in northern Australia. When sown into native or sown grass pastures, leucaena provides significant production, economic, environmental and social benefits. Adoption of leucaena was slow initially due to a range of technical, agronomic and landscape factors. These have now been largely overcome through extensive research, development, producer experience and other advances, resulting in around 130,000 ha of cultivated leucaena being utilized across northern Australia. A range of aspects will need to be addressed if the adoption of leucaena is to be accelerated into the future. These include environmental concerns, especially potential weediness, and a range of technological needs, including soil nutritional requirements, grazing and toxicity management, opportunities for companion fodder systems and conservation options. Advances in technology and the ongoing need for a high-quality, profitable and sustainable perennial forage will ensure the continued adoption of leucaena across northern Australia for the foreseeable future. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - There is considerable interest from Western Australian (WA) pastoralists on the potential role of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) in northern WA, where the potential area for dryland production of species of the genus Leucaena is high. Although it is highly regarded for animal production in other countries and in Queensland, leucaena is a contentious species since its status as an environmental weed currently precludes it from use on pastoral leases in the Kimberley and Pilbara regions of WA. Development of sterile/seedless forms would overcome risks of spread of the species as a weed. The key environmental constraints to growth of leucaena are likely to be the length of the dry season and low fertility of most soils other than the grey/black cracking clays (vertosols). Psyllid resistance and cool temperature tolerance are likely to be of secondary importance. Opportunities for irrigated production are also emerging and may allow leucaena species to be used in environments previously considered well outside their home-range. It is desirable now to re-examine the diversity of the wider leucaena genus for adaptation to WA conditions generally and for the purpose of selecting elite parent material for use in a sterile/seedless leucaena breeding program. These perennial species that can be under production for 30 to 40 years need to be evaluated in the target environments for at least 3-5 years to fully understand their potential as adult plants. © 2019.

TI  - Productivity and profitability of alternative steer growth paths resulting from accessing high-quality forage systems in the subtropics of northern Australia: A modelling approach

AB  - Beef producers have to determine the best allocation of a limited resource of high-quality forage. This analysis assessed the most profitable way of incorporating high-quality forages into the whole-of-life steer growth path on forage systems in central Queensland, using property-level, regionally relevant herd models that determine whole-of-business productivity and profitability over a 30-year investment period. Twenty-two growth paths (liveweight change over time) from weaning to marketing were investigated for steers grazing buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) pastures with and without access to leucaena-grass pastures (Leucaena leucocephala spp. glabrata + perennial, tropical grass (C4) species) or forage oats (Avena sativa) for varying intervals throughout their growth path. The production, economic and financial effect of each growth path was assessed by comparison to a base scenario that produced finished, slaughter steers (605 kg) from buffel grass pastures. The relative profitability of marketing steers at feedlot entry (feed-on) weight (474 kg) instead of slaughter weights was also assessed. The growth paths were applied within two beef enterprises, namely (1) steer turnover and (2) breeding and finishing. For both enterprises, grazing steers on leucaena-grass pastures from weaning until they achieved feedlot entry weight (474 kg) was substantially more profitable than any other growth path. Compared with the base scenario, this optimal growth path improved profitability by 121% and 37% for the steer turnover and the breeding and finishing enterprises respectively. The purchase of additional breeders for the latter enterprise was required to optimise utilisation of the leucaena-grass pastures immediately. Incorporating leucaena-grass pastures at any steer age improved the profitability of the steer turnover enterprise (AU$7368-AU$106 508 extra profit/annum), and similarly for the breeding and finishing enterprise (AU$1754-AU$31 383 extra profit/annum) except for two scenarios where leucaena-grass pastures were provided to older steers targeted at the feed-on market (AU$4816 and AU$23 886 less profit/annum). However, incorporation of leucaena-grass into steer growth paths also resulted in increased peak deficit levels and financial risk to the business compared with buffel grass-only production systems, with payback periods for the most profitable growth path of 8 and 14 years for the steer turnover and the breeding and finishing enterprise respectively. All growth paths that incorporated forage oats and leucaena-grass resulted in lower economic and financial performance than did comparable growth paths that incorporated leucaena-grass only. Furthermore, incorporating oats into buffel grass-only growth paths always reduced the enterprise profitability. There was no relationship, across scenarios within an enterprise, between change in profit and the number of extra weaners produced or the amount of extra beef produced per hectare. © CSIRO.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate fermentation and chemical characteristics and the in situ degradability of sorghum silages enriched with dried Leucaena. The experiment was conducted as completely randomized design with four treatments (0 - control silage, silage without leucaena; 10.0, 20.0, or 30.0% inclusion of Leucaena) and five replicates, totaling 20 experimental units. The inclusion levels of leucaena influenced (P <0.05) the pH values, and for each 1% inclusion there was a reduction of 0.0023 points in the pH value, and in all silages presented values. Dry matter recovery did not show effect (P > 0.05), with all silages having values above 90%. Gas loss decreased (P < 0.05) as the level of leucine increased in sorghum silage. A linear increase was observed for dry matter (P ≤ 0.0001) and crude protein (P = 0.0008) contents in response to Leucaena inclusion. There was a linear (P < 0.05) linear effect on neutral detergent fiber, hemicellulose and acid detergent fiber. As leucaena inclusion levels increased, for each 1% inclusion a reduction of 0.179 was observed; 0.059 and 0.119% for the values of neutral detergent fiber, hemicellulose and acid detergent fiber respectively. The inclusion of leucaena influenced (P < 0.05) the increase of silage lignin levels, probably due to the higher lignin content of the legume. The soluble fraction (a) of the silages increased along with the Leucaena inclusion levels, with highest values observed at the inclusion of 20 and 30% of the legume, respectively. Potential degradation (A) increased linearly with the levels of Leucaena added to the silage; the highest value for this variable was observed at 30% inclusion. Effective degradability (ED) increased up to the inclusion level of 20% (46.77%). Degradation rate (c) decreased markedly with the use of 30% Leucaena. The use of the forage part of Leucaena dried for three hours leads to reduced gas production, increased dry matter and crude protein contents, and decreased fiber contents. The degradability of dry matter increases up to the inclusion level of 20%. © 2019 Universidade Estadual de Londrina. All rights reserved.

TI  - Daily variation in feeding and ingestive behaviour of sheep and goats grazing and browsing on grass-legume pastures
PY  - 2019

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the feeding and ingestive behaviours of sheep and goats grazing on grass-legume pastures. Three 2-year female Nguni x Boer goats and three 3-year female Damara sheep were randomly allocated to grass-Lespedeza cuneata (grass-Lc) and grass-Leucaena leucocephala (grass-Ll) pastures. Times spent on browsing, grazing and idling were recorded from 0700 to 1600 h every 2 minutes for 3 consecutive days. Ingestive behaviour of each animal was observed for 10 minutes at 1000, 1200 and 1400 h for 6 days. Bite count and bite weight were used to determine intake rates during browsing. Goats spent 3.24 and 3.93 times longer than sheep in browsing, while sheep spent 2.75 and 2.27 times longer in grazing than goats on grass-Lc than grass-Ll pastures, respectively. Goats idled for longer periods than sheep on both pastures. Sheep had faster bite rates than goats, while Lespedeza cuneata elicited lower bite rates than L. leucocephala. Fastest feeding and bite rates were observed at mid day (1200 h) and lowest during the afternoon (1400 h). Intake rates of fresh herbage are higher at mid day than in the morning and afternoon. In conclusion, based on time spent browsing, L. leucocephala is better preferred as a forage browse compared to L. cuneata. © 2019 Indian journals.

AB  - With increasing cattle production in East Nusa Tenggara Province there is an urgent need to increase plantings of high quality forage such as Tarramba leucaena. This requires stakeholders to acquire knowledge and practical skills to achieve reliable plant establishment. As part of a study of Tarramba leucaena adoption in East Nusa Tenggara, it became clear that the best method to establish leucaena was by transplanting 1-2-month-old seedlings at the beginning of the rainy season that had been pre-prepared in poly-bags at a nursery. However, with varied conditions at the study locations, such as the absence of a dry season water source, farmers have used other methods, including: direct seeding; poly-bag seedlings planted later in the wet season; or older bare-root seedlings harvested from a high-density nursery or from volunteer seedlings growing between rows of established leucaena. This paper elaborates on the different methods of establishment in farmer plantings in Kupang District (West Timor region of East Nusa Tenggara Province), Indonesia. © 2019.

TI  - In vitro evaluation of ruminant feed from West Sumatera based on chemical composition and content of rumen degradable and rumen undegradable proteins
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072754458&doi=10.14202%2fvetworld.2019.1478-1483&partnerID=40&md5=48b49f47e5d77a097214ed8ec70a3d43
AB  - Aim: This research aimed to discover the chemical composition, as well as the content of the degradable and undegradable protein of the ruminant feed commonly used as cattle feed by Indonesian farmers. Materials and Methods: In this study, Pennisetum purpureum, Leucaena leucocephala, Indigofera zollingeriana, Gliricidia sepium, cassava, maize, palm kernel cake, and rice bran were used as feed. Chemical composition was determined by proximate and Van Soest analyses performed in triplicate. Dry matter and organic matter digestibility, as well as the rumen degradable proteins (RDP) and rumen undegradable proteins (RUP) contents, were determined in vitro using the Tilley and Terry method. Results: The results showed that more proteins can be obtained from legumes than from grass or concentrates. The highest protein amount was obtained from I. zollingerian (31.22%), while the lowest protein amount was obtained from cassava (3.59%). Dry matter digestibility ranged from 18.53% (rice bran) to 49.21% (G. sepium). Organic matter digestibility ranged from 35.71% (cassava) to 59.57% (I. zollingerian). Rice bran had the highest RDP from concentrate (73.26%), whereas I. zollingerian had the highest RDP from forage (74.72%). The highest RUP from concentrate was obtained from palm kernel cake (61.01%), and the highest RUP from forage was obtained from L. leucocephala (49.23%). Conclusion: The preparation of ruminant livestock rations must be based on RDP and RUP to meet the needs of both the rumen microbes and host animals. Information regarding the RDP and RUP of feeds is still limited, making this study useful in the preparation of ruminant livestock rations based on RDP and RUP ratios. © 2019 Putri, et al.

TI  - The efficacy of a cultured Synergistes jonesii inoculum to control hydroxypyridone toxicity in Bos indicus steers fed leucaena/grass diets

AB  - An experiment was conducted to investigate the efficacy of a cultured Synergistes jonesii inoculum in degrading the Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) toxins: 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone and 3-hydroxy-2(1H)-pyridone (3,4- and 2,3-DHP). Sixteen stall-housed Bos indicus steers naïve to leucaena were fed varying combinations of forage-harvested leucaena and Chloris gayana (Rhodes grass). Dietary treatments, offered at 25 g dry matter/kg LW.day, were: 25% leucaena; 50% leucaena; 100% leucaena; and 50% leucaena, switched to 50% Medicago sativa (lucerne) after 6 weeks at time of inoculation. The experiment was 10 weeks in duration, consisting of a 6-week pre-inoculation period, followed by inoculation with cultured S. jonesii, and a 4-week post-inoculation period. Mean daily dry matter intake was recorded. Twenty-four-hour urine collections and rumen fluid samples were obtained weekly for estimation of total urinary DHP, and detection of S. jonesii using nested polymerase chain reaction analysis including presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), respectively. In the pre-inoculation period, total urinary DHP increased quickly to high levels, then gradually declined after Week 3 with 2,3-DHP the dominant isomer through to Week 6. Indigenous strains of S. jonesii were sporadically detected by PCR analysis, indicating S. jonesii was present before inoculation but at the lower limits of detection. After inoculation there was no change in the rate of total DHP degradation or the frequency of detection of S. jonesii, although there was increased rate of degradation of 2,3-DHP. SNP indicated the presence of different strains of S. jonesii in both indigenous and cultured S. jonesii. DMI was low, especially in the 100% treatment, due in part to the high stem content of the forage-harvested leucaena and probable DHP toxicosis. It was concluded that the cultured S. jonesii inoculum did not fully protect animals against leucaena toxicity. © 2019 CSIRO.

TI  - Molecular weight of condensed tannins of some tropical feed-leaves and their effect on in vitro gas and methane production
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073621570&doi=10.1071%2fAN17749&partnerID=40&md5=4a7525d47213734a75f62260631d1fc5
AB  - The concentration and molecular weights (MW) of condensed tannins (CT) of three locally available tropical plant species leaves which have potential to be used as ruminant feed, and their effects on in vitro gas, including methane, production were investigated. Leaves of three plant species, namely, leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), cassava (Manihot esculenta, Cranzt), and Siamese neem (Azadirachta indica A.Juss. var. Siamensis Valeton) were used in the present study. CT contents ranged from 1.2% in the leucaena to 5.0% in Siamese neem. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of the purified CTs, determined using gel-permeation chromatography, were 3222, 3409 and 3612 Da for leucaena, cassava and Siamese neem respectively. The above values were within the range reported for CTs of various tropical plant species. We know of no published data on MW of CTs from leaves of cassava and Siamese neem and, thus, this research, for the first time, reported the MWs of the above two plant materials. Subsequently, two CT extracts with differing MWs, such as CTs extracted from leaves of Siamese neem and leaves of leucaena, were selected as the representative of high and low MWs of CT respectively, and used for investigation of the effect of the MW of CT on in vitro gas production and fermentation parameters. Supplementation of CTs of a higher MW extracted from leaves of Siamese neem (at 2-6 mg/100 mg DM) significantly inhibited in vitro total gas and methane production, while supplementation of CTs with a lower MW extracted from leaves of leucaena had no effect, except for total gas production at the highest level (6 mg/100 mg DM) of supplementation. Similarly, CT from Siamese neem leaves had a stronger inhibitory effect (P < 0.001) on in vitro volatile fatty acid, acetic acid and butyric acid production. The above results indicated that concentrations and the MW of CT varied among the plant species in addition, the efficacy of CTs to inhibit ruminal CH4 emission are influenced by their MW. © 2019 CSIRO.

AB  - The present study was carried out during 105 days in Pilagás (Formosa, Argentina) to evaluate the effect of Leucaena sp consumed by weaned calves on the gastrointestinal parasitic load. Thirty calves were divided into two groups: grazing Leucaena (TREATED with/L; n=15) or without consumption of Leucaena (TREATED without/L; n=15). This essay was performed in a direct grazing system and animals were naturally infected under the conditions of Pilagás forage. Animals in the TREATED with/L group grazed in an interseeding of Leucaena leucocephala with Brachiaria brizantha while the TREATED without/L group grazed only on B. brizantha. Eggs per gram (EPG) were determined from feces. Fecal culture and identification of larvae were also performed for each experimental group. Hemotocrit (Ht) was measured and animals were weight. The main genera recovered in the fecal samples were: Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, and Bunostomum. Oesophagostomum, Cooperia and Strongyloides were less abundant. Since the second sampling, animals with Ht ≤ 22% required albendazole administration since health was compromised. During the whole study, only one calf under TREATED with/L required treatment, whereas in the other group (TREATED without/L) nine animals needed treatment. In relation to EPG, significant differences were registered for the second and forth sampling (p value of 0.3 and 0.006, respectively) in favor of TREATED without/L group. We conclude that under the conditions for the present study, L. leucocephala intake exerts an effect over EPG. Therefore, future assays should be performed for a better understanding regarding an alternative integral control of parasites. © 2019 Universidad Nacional de Nordeste (UNNE). All rights reserved.

AB  - The activated carbon from Leucaena leucocephala seed shell was prepared by chemical activation, characterized and used as adsorbent for the removal of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] from aqueous solution via batch mode adsorption. The variables affecting the adsorption process, initial adsorbate concentration, pH, adsorbent dosage and temperature were optimized using central composite design (CCD) of the response surface methodology (RSM) at fixed contact time of 60 min. Equilibrium adsorption isotherm and kinetic were also studied. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that all the variables studied had significant effects on the removal efficiency of Cr(VI). The obtained data showed that 71.49 mg/L initial Cr(VI) concentration, 4.22 solution pH, 0.57 g adsorbent dosage and 26.2 °C temperature resulted in 95.62% adsorption. Equilibrium adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies showed that Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitted well to the experimental data. The activated carbon from Leucaena leucocephala seed shell was found to be efficient for Cr(VI) adsorption. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Leucaena feeding systems in Argentina. II. Current uses and future research priorities

AB  - This paper presents the current status of Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) feeding systems and proposes research priorities for leucaena development in Argentina. Although research on leucaena as forage for cattle production began in the late 1960s, it was not widely adopted until 2010 (5 decades later). The recent adoption is related to the incorporation of the 'Australian technology package', previously adapted for use by farmers in the neighboring region of the Paraguayan Chaco. In June 2018, we surveyed 8 properties with about 2,400 ha of leucaena in silvopastoral systems for beef cattle production in the Argentinean Chaco region, as well as 10 smallholder farms with about 10 ha of leucaena protein banks for dairy cattle in the northeast of Argentina. In the silvopastoral systems, leucaena condition was excellent on most properties in the 750-1,350 mm/year rainfall zone and low/poor on only 1 farm due to low rainfall (600 mm/year). In protein banks, leucaena condition was excellent or good on 6 of the properties and low/poor on the remaining 4, attributed to ingress of weeds and/or overgrazing. Grass condition was good in most of the systems but was low/poor in 2 silvopastoral systems due to very high stocking rates imposed to restrict leucaena height. Although there is high potential for leucaena development in Argentina, expansion should take place carefully with leucaena planted only on areas suitable for successful establishment, and using appropriate management practices to reduce establishment failures and costs, restrict leucaena height, enhance grass persistence, improve grazing strategies and manage mimosine toxicity problems. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - The impacts of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) feeding systems on cattle production, environmental services and animal welfare in Mexico are discussed. A total of about 12,000 ha of leucaena have been established in the tropical regions of México, where most of the information for the current review was obtained. Incorporating leucaena in a grass pasture increases dry matter intake of grazing cattle and reduces the level of methane produced. This results in improved liveweight gains and milk yields as well as a reduction in the level of greenhouse gas released. Additional benefits are increases in soil carbon and nitrogen levels and less stress on animals as the leucaena plants provide shade and reduce environmental temperatures. While these benefits are substantial, the area developed to leucaena represents less than 0.1% of the area which could potentially be developed. Strategies to increase adoption of these grass-legume systems by farmers need to be developed to make effective use of the systems for increasing beef and milk production while reducing the undesirable environmental outcomes normally associated with ruminant production. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - India is one of the major producers/consumers of paper and pulp products (3-4% of global share). Approximately one-fourth of industry raw material has come from wood-based plantations from the 1990s onwards. The greatest development challenge faced by the industry since that time is sourcing robust raw material from agroforestry on private lands. Following genetic improvement of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and realization of its potential as a multiple-use species, it was introduced into India in 1980 under an international cooperation effort with support from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA). It has since spread across the country as a panacea for rural needs of fuel wood, small timber and cattle forage. The paper industry has found that it has potential as raw material for paper making. One of the largest Indian paper companies is JK Paper Ltd, which has an annual production capacity of 550,000 t/yr with 3 integrated pulp and paper plants located at Songadh (Gujarat), Rayagada (Orissa) and Kagaznagar (Telangana) producing writing and printing paper and virgin packaging boards. This case study describes the leucaena farm forestry plantation program initiated by JK Paper Ltd, Unit CPM (Central Pulp Mills). The unit, under its agroforestry and farm forestry plantation approach, planted leucaena plantations in 2009-2010 in parts of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh States. To motivate farmers in the mill's catchment area, and to build confidence in on-farm plantations, exposure visits were arranged to Andhra Pradesh, where huge tracts of agricultural land were under leucaena plantations. As a result, to date, this unit has engaged > 7,800 farmers who have established leucaena plantations covering an area of > 18,400 ha. A robust plantation R & D network addressed issues such as seed treatment, seed germination, rhizobial inoculation, geometry of plantations, agro-forestry models, selection and development of high production clones, establishment of clonal seed orchards, genetic improvement through mutation techniques and hybridization programs for wood quality improvement. © 2019.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala subsp. leucocephala was introduced to Hawaii after European settlement and spread widely for cattle fodder and fuelwood. As in many other tropical locations where it has been introduced, it has naturalized and spread in disturbed and drier habitats. While it is common in disturbed areas, it is much less common in intact native dry forests. It is resilient to wildfire and mammalian grazing, which conversely threaten the integrity of remnant native dryland forest. The successional trajectory of areas dominated by leucaena has not been well studied in Hawaii, but it is probable that other non-native rather than native species will replace it. As a result of its widespread distribution, especially on steep slopes, priority for its eradication or control is low. Current biocontrol options are limited in effectiveness. Control of leucaena can and should be given greater priority to protect native dryland forests and inhibit spread of seeds. Restoration of dryland habitats requires intensive, sustained efforts, usually involving volunteers. Combining cultural and/or use values in restoration projects holds promise for stimulating and sustaining community involvement. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

TI  - Effect of a mixed silage of king grass (Cenchrus purpureus) and forage legumes (Leucaena leucocephala or Gliricidia sepium) on sheep intake, digestibility and nitrogen balance
PY  - 2019
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072113130&doi=10.1071%2fAN18559&partnerID=40&md5=6fbdfb9d84c5c35583fc9b0e5049838c
AB  - Ensiled king grass (Cenchrus purpureus (Schumach.) Morrone) is commonly used as feed in tropical ruminant production. However, ruminant performance can be limited by low nitrogen (N) content in tropical grass silage. A mixed feed of legume-king grass silage may be an option to improve ruminant production. We investigated the effects of feeding an ensiled mixture of king grass forage and foliage of a browse tree legume, either leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) or gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp), on dry matter (DM) intake, DM digestibility, organic matter (OM) digestibility and N balance of Pelibuey sheep. Twelve male lambs 9-11 months old were blocked by initial bodyweight (33 ± 3 kg, mean ± s.d.) into three groups of four lambs and randomly assigned to one of three feed treatments: king grass silage (KS) mixed king grass and leucaena silage (KLS) and mixed king grass and gliricidia silage (KGS). Results showed that DM and OM were similar among silages. The N content was higher (P < 0.001) in KLS and KGS than in KS. DM intake and DM digestibility were higher (P < 0.001) in KLS and KGS than in KS. OM digestibility was higher (P < 0.001) in KLS than in KS. Nitrogen intake, faecal N, urine volume, urinary N, digested N, N digestibility, N retention and retained N: N intake ratio from KLS and KGS treatments were higher (P < 0.05) than from KS. A lower (P < 0.01) urinary N: N intake ratio was detected from KGS and KLS than from KS. This study demonstrated that, compared with silage made from king grass alone, legume-king grass silage mixtures can improve intake and nutrient digestibility in Pelibuey lambs. Further, N retention can be enhanced when legume-king grass silages are used as feed compared with king grass silage alone. © 2019 CSIRO.

TI  - Effectiveness of inoculation with rumen fluid containing Synergistes jonesii to control DHP toxicity in ruminants in eastern Indonesia
PY  - 2019

AB  - The feasibility and efficacy of inoculating with rumen fluid as a method to control hydroxypyridone (DHP) toxicity in ruminants on high leucaena diets in eastern Indonesia were investigated. Rumen fluid collected from 2 buffalo identified as 'protected', due to low levels of DHP excretion in urine, was orally administered to animals identified as 'unprotected' and concentrations of urinary DHP monitored. Control animals were dosed with water only. Treatments were randomly allocated to 10 recipient animals: 3 goats and 7 cattle. All animals were fed a diet containing freshly cut 100% leucaena during the 18 day study period. Measurement of urinary DHP via colorimetric analysis commenced 8 days prior to animals being drenched with rumen fluid or water and continued for 10 days afterwards. Urinary DHP levels in animals that received the inoculum did not differ from those in the control group 10 days post-inoculation (mean 425 mg DHP/L; P = 0.50). Unexpectedly, DHP levels in all animals (rumen fluid and water) declined with time, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.12), and remained above considered safe threshold levels. These results suggest that transfer of rumen fluid to overcome leucaena toxicity in animals in eastern Indonesia may not be effective despite great care having been taken to ensure the viability of the anaerobic organisms during the inoculation process; this methodology is also not a practical solution to replicate on a commercial scale. The findings suggest that inoculation may not be necessary if animals previously naïve to leucaena are able to adapt to DHP toxicity by other means. © 2019 Tropical Grasslands-Forrajes Tropicales.

AB  - The use of location-specific and underutilized organic residues (OR) as soil amendments in small-holder agro-ecosystems is promising. Six ORs (Leucaena leucocephala, Centrosema pubescens, Gliricidia sepium, Pueraria phaseoloides, Azadirachta indica, and Theobroma cacao) were amended to three tropical soils each at 24 mg g−1 dry soil in 120-day incubation study to estimate their nitrogen (N) mineralization and microbial biomass carbon (C) dynamics. Inorganic N contents varied among ORs, soil type and incubation days. Regardless of soil type, Gliricidia had the highest inorganic N among the studied ORs. Mineralization rate of 1.4 to 1.5 mg N kg−1 soil day−1 was observed for Lego and Tec soils, respectively, and was twice higher than Nya soil. However, Nya soil released higher inorganic N than Tec and Lego soils, implying high N mineralization efficiency in the former. Consistent soil pH increase was respectively observed for Theobroma and Pueraria treatments in all soils. Moreover, Theobroma and Pueraria amendments showed the highest soil microbial biomass C (MBC) at the end of the incubation. The assessed soil properties likely affected by the dominant edaphic factors and management influenced differences in MBC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) while OR quality indices controlled N mineralization. Thus, we conclude that soil properties and OR type are important factors for optimal utilization of organic resources. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In livestock production systems, the combination of pasture and woody perennials improves the yield and reduces the negative environmental impact. In 2006, a silvopastoral system was established at the experimental station (Posta Zootécnica: PZ) of the Universidad Veracruzana. It contained 791 native tropical trees of the following species: quickstick (Gliricidia sepium; Glse), cópite (Cordia dodecandra; Codo), West Indian elm (Guazuma ulmifolia; Guul), (Diphysa robinioides; Diro) and tihuixtle (Caesalpinia cacalaco; Caca). Starting from the second year after the trees were planted, livestock was brought into the PZ to browse on them. The objective of this study was to quantify the development and survival of five native species, 11 years after they were planted. The resulting support data was gathered from August to November 2017. Due to their specific characteristics, the survival and development of the said species is expected to be different under similar conditions. The experimental design was a series of blocks, with five treatments (species) and 156 replicates per treatment. Thirteen rows of trees were planted in a 2-ha surface, using the following repeated arrangement: Glse+Codo+Guul+Diro+Cala. The trees were planted 3 m apart from each other and the distance between rows was 5 m. Eleven years after they were planted, the specimens of each species were counted, the diameter of their trunks or main branches was measured and the height at which this measurement was carried out was recorded. The overall survival rate was 57.7% (p=0.02); there was a difference between species in the diameter of the trunk or main branch (p=0.03) and the height at which they were measured (p=0.003). Eight species of trees that had grown naturally in the system or that were planted to provide shade or serve as windbreak were identified: Indian siris (Albizia lebbeck), Australian pine (Casuarina equisetifolia), Spanish cedar (Cedrela odorata), lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala), Elephant-ear tree (Enterolobium cyclocarpum), trumpet tree (Tabebuia rosea), teak (Tectona grandis) and sea grape (Coccoloba uvifera). Native tropical trees maintain the silvopastoral system and they are available for browsing. © 2019, Colegio de Postgraduados.

AB  - Cellulose synthase (CesA) plays a major regulatory role in the cellulose synthesis pathway in plants and is an important factor in controlling wood fiber quality and yield. In this study, two cellulose synthase genes, AmCesA1 and AmCesA2, were cloned from Acacia mangium using transcriptome de novo sequencing analysis and RACE. In silico analysis revealed that AmCesA1 cDNA was 3793 bp in size, had a 3249 bp ORF, and encoded a 1082 amino acid protein; AmCesA2 cDNA was 3743 bp in size, had a 3228 bp ORF, and encoded a 1075 amino acid protein. AmCesA1 was determined to have six transmembrane regions, and AmCesA2 was determined to have eight transmembrane regions. Cluster analysis showed that AmCesA1 had high degrees of similarity with Glycine max GmCesA1 and Arachis duranensis AdCesA1. AmCesA2 had high degrees of similarity with Leucaena leucocephala LlCesA7 and LlCesA8. Southern blot analysis showed that multiple copies of AmCesA1 were present in the Acacia mangium genome, but only a single copy of AmCesA2 was present. Real-time RT-PCR showed that both genes were widely expressed in roots, stems, and leaves, but AmCesA2 was more highly expressed in stems. The two genes responded to GA3, 6-BA, and MeJA treatments, and the response to GA3 was relatively strong. Here, we presume that the two genes are involved in the formation of primary cell walls and that AmCesA2 is also involved in the formation of secondary cell walls. The expression of both genes was upregulated under different hormone treatments, which indicated that the two genes positively regulate the hormone response. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The water film due to rain falling on a radome surface causes severe losses in radio wave transmission. Hydrophobic coatings have been applied as a remedy to reduce the film thickness and to minimize the losses. However, quantitative accounts of the wave scattering are mostly based on empirical estimates of the film thickness. We describe a fluid-mechanical theory for the film under steady rain falling on a textured surface formed by a square array of pillars. assuming the water surface on top of the pillars to be in the Cassie-Baxter state, the analysis is carried out by making use of the sharp contrast of length scales between the film thickness and the radome radius. The textured surface is viewed as a periodic array of cells around pillars. The macro-scale flow is simple and linear but the micro-scale flow in a typical lattice period is fully nonlinear. These two problems are coupled and are solved iteratively to obtain the slip length and the spatial variation of the film thickness. Numerical results are presented to show the effect of solid fraction on local flow field, the slip length and the non-uniform reduction of the film thickness. To examine the influence of the macro-scale geometry on film formation, the theory is also modified for a hydrophobic roof top formed by two inclined planes. © © 2019 Cambridge University Pressa.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Leucaena) is a woody fodder legume with extensive use as livestock feed in the tropics becasuse of its adaptation and productivity in tropical environments. This review discusses benefits of Leucaena as feed for bovines in realtion to tropical grasses, among these benefits are: lower methane (CH4) emission; higher intake of protein, Ω3 fatty acids and minerals; incorporation of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to the soil-plantanimal chain; and, higher N efficiency by the bovine. Mimosine and concentration of condensed tannins above 5% might cause digestive disorders in bovines, then Leucaena intake has to be controlled and use of Leucaena populations with lower mimosine and condensed tannins concentrations. Silvopastoral systems are an option to have Leucaena available for grazing cattle, row tree planting has shown higher animal production than scattered trees and cluster. Silvopastoral system with Leucaena can increase total available forage by 8.7 t of DM ha-1 yr-1, this additional forage can have 22 to 25% and 55 to 61% crude protein and in vitro dry matter digestibility, respectively. Planned incorporation of Leucaena to the grazing areas has shown to yield 9.1 to 9.8 kg of milk cow-1 day-1 or 11957 to 14403 kg milk ha-1 yr-1; and, 693 to 851 g of live-weight gain animal-1 day-1 or 788 to 1337 kg of live-weight ha-1 yr-1. Leucaena inclusion on grazing areas improves livestock productivity in tropical areas with lower environmental impact than tropical grasses alone; however, more reaserch is needed to overcome some Leucaena agronomic and nutritional limitations. © 2019 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

AB  - Acidity, solubility and chemical properties of eleven years old of Leucaena leucocephala stem bark were investigated. The bark was peeled from the stem of tree and gentle washed in tap water to remove dirt before air-dried in the laboratory at room temperature (24 + 3°C) for 2-3 weeks. The bark was minced into coarse powder and grind to pass BS 250μm mesh sieve. After air-dried for several days, the samples were conducted to chemical analyses (ash content and pH value; solubility in 1%NaOH, hot and cold water solubility; extractive, cellulose and lignin content) based on ASTM standard methods. The results show that L. leucocephala stem bark considered as least acidic (pH value 6.04) and high ash content (15.76%). The solubility of bark components was higher in 1% NaOH (41.36%) compared to hot water (14.45%) and cold water (11.06%). Holocellulose and hemicellulose was 132.85% and 103.66%, respectively. Lignin was the major composition in L. leucocephala stem bark (38.4%) followed by cellulose (29.19%) and extractive (8.39%). This study indicated that the bark of L. leucocephala had less acidity.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala ssp. glabrata) is a highly productive tropical perennial legume used primarily in extensive beef grazing systems across northern Australia. Its productivity provides substantial benefits to grazing businesses and economically significant areas of leucaena have been established in Queensland, with much smaller areas in both the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Specific environmental conditions (particularly soil type) and management practices are required to obtain reliable establishment and high productivity from leucaena-grass grazing systems. Significant research, development and extension have been undertaken in northern Australia, particularly in central Queensland, resulting in management packages which ensure establishment reliability and long-term productivity. However expansion into new areas can be constrained by regionally-specific establishment issues. Adaptation of known establishment and management practices together with research and development are required for leucaena-grass grazing systems in new regions. © 2019.

The study indicated higher biomass production potential of Gmelina arborea, Dalbergia sissoo and Leucaena leucocephala. Higher photosynthetically active radiation value below tree canopy indicates compatibility of trees with a majority of agricultural crops. In the present study, a significant increase in pH and decrease in EC of trees were observed. The significant reduction in nutrients in different trees indicated a need for replenishment of nutrients in soil for maintaining soil fertility in agroforestry systems on long-term basis. © 2019 Indian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala has played a key role in the development of sustainable cattle ranching in Latin America. This species is the backbone of the so-called Intensive Silvopastoral Systems (ISPS) that combine high-density cultivation of leucaena as fodder shrubs (4,000-40,000 plants/ha) with grasses and trees. The layers of vegetation added by shrubs and trees increase the system's capacity for transforming solar energy into biomass and enhance habitat complexity. Although part of the biomass is transformed into livestock products, a significant amount is deposited as litter on the soil and, along with the nitrogen fixed by leucaena and other trees, has positive effects on soil properties and grass production. The increased complexity of the system has measurable effects on biodiversity. ISPS with leucaena support more species of birds, ants, dung beetles and woody plants than conventional pasture monocultures, contribute to landscape-scale connectivity and provide environmental services. They also enhance animal welfare through reduced heat stress and improved availability and quality of fodder resources. ISPS contribute to climate change mitigation by improving above- and below-ground carbon sequestration and by cutting down greenhouse gas emissions per units of dry matter consumed and cattle product. Although these systems have been successfully implemented in Colombia, Mexico and other countries, their adoption is still limited in relation to the area suitable for their introduction. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - In Malaysia, the depletion of raw materials has begun to impact mills, as their production could decrease or cease. This will impact the Malaysian wood-based economy, both locally and globally. Usage of trees with fast-growing characteristics is essential to add feedstock sources to mills. This study investigated the mechanical properties (MOR, MOR, IB, and screw withdrawal) of particleboard (density = 660 kg/m3) made of Leucaena leucocephala, rubberwood, and mixed tropical trees with different species ratios. The wood species ratios for the particleboards were 100% Leucaena, 50% Leucaena and 50% rubberwood, and 50% rubberwood and 50% mixed tropical wood. Boards with the dimensions 3680 mm × 2465 mm × 25 mm were produced. The results showed that all of the species ratios passed the minimum requirements for commercial use. The performance of the Leucaena particleboard was 17.40 MPa (MOR), 2654 MPa (MOE), 0.68 MPa (IB) and 623 N (Screw withdrawal). The Leucaena board performance matched that of the board made from the current raw materials used commercially (mixed tropical wood and rubberwood). © 2019, North Carolina State University.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala became naturalized in Paraguay long ago. However, due to cases of toxicity in horses and cattle, now identified as mimosine toxicity, leucaena was considered a weed until the beginning of this millennium. At this time the mimosine toxicity problem was overcome by the introduction of ruminal fluid from Australia containing the mimosine-degrading and -detoxifying bacterium Synergistes jonesii. As long as an internationally funded technical assistance project was operating (offering technical advice, provision of seed, seed scarification service and transmission of ruminal fluid containing Synergistes), the area sown to leucaena (either in twin rows into grass pastures or as fodder banks) increased rapidly in Paraguay, particularly in the Chaco area. However, the powdery fluvisols of the drier parts of the Chaco were not well suited to growth of leucaena, as persistence was restricted due to the impact of rodents, termites and also leaf-cutting ants, which prosper particularly well in this part of the Chaco. In more humid areas with usually heavier soils, currently leucaena represents an integral part of the feeding systems in hundreds of Paraguayan farms (large-scale as well as smallholders), mainly for steer fattening and dairy cow supplementation. After taking into account the above-mentioned setbacks, the total area of leucaena is currently estimated at about 10,000 ha. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - The introduction of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), apart from increasing animal production, improves soil fertility through biological nitrogen (N) fixation and its deep-rooted system. There is limited information on carbon and N dynamics in hedgerow silvopastoral systems, particularly in the subsoil profile. The concentrations and vertical distribution of organic carbon (OC) and total N , and their fractions (particulate and associate forms) in the profile (0?100 cm) of a 4-year-old leucaena stand in a Urochloa brizantha-Chloris gayana pasture were compared with those in the adjacent pure tropical grass (U. brizantha) pasture. Leucaena introduction increased the OC concentration in the subsoil (20?100 cm) by 45%, particularly the stable form (associate OC) in the deepest horizon (50?100 cm). This was attributed to a greater abundance of leucaena roots deeper in the profile than for grass. Leucaena also enhanced by 7.6% the N concentration (from 0.131 to 0.141%) in the topsoil (0?20 cm) associated with an increment in the labile form (particulate organic N), due to leaf deposition, recycling of animal feces and nodule-N turnover from N fixation. Leucaena establishment has the potential to improve soil fertility and hence availability of N to companion grass growth, and can be utilized as a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is native to Mexico and Central America and is currently naturalized in the majority of Latin American countries. Over the last 2 decades, considerable research and promotion of leucaena have been carried out in Colombia, Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. Research focused on the agronomic and management options for feeding beef, dairy or dual-purpose animals, with some studies on germplasm, weediness issues, toxicity, organic fertilizer application and environmental services. Over the past 10-15 years, establishment and management of leucaena feeding systems in Latin America have varied according to country. For instance, intensive Silvopastoral Systems (iSPS) models are widely promoted and successfully adopted in Colombia, Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela and Northeast Brazil. In iSPS, leucaena is planted at high density (>10,000 trees/ha), in combination with improved tropical grass and high-value timber species (200-400 trees/ha), and intensively managed employing rotational grazing. In Paraguay and Argentina, leucaena is planted in single or double hedgerows with inter-row alleys of 6-8 m, following the configuration used in Australia and mainly focused on beef production. In Mexico, leucaena is also cultivated with Tithonia diversifolia or lemon trees. Meanwhile, in other countries such as Cuba, leucaena has been established as protein banks using single/twin rows with inter-row spacing of 2-4 m for feeding beef, dairy or dual-purpose animals. Overall, paddock sizes for protein banks and iSPS range between 0.3 and 50 ha, while single and twin hedgerow systems are generally established over larger areas (20-500 ha). Despite the significant benefits demonstrated by research on leucaena feeding systems over the past 2 decades, coupled with successful outcomes for farmers who have adopted these systems, total area sown remains low across Latin America. This review provides a comparison between Latin American and Australian leucaena pasture systems, and recommendations for future collaborative research between countries. © 2019.

AB  - Legume is a feed ingredient that contains high protein for ruminants. The tannin content in legumes can provide a bypass protein for ruminants. This study was done to find out the effect of legume supplementation (Leucaena leucocephala) on fiber digestibility, characteristic rumen, protozoa population and methane production from total mixed ration (TMR) based on ammoniated rice straw. The study was conducted in vitro using a randomized block design with 3 treatments and 5 replications. The treatment was A. 40% ammoniated rice straw + 60% concentrate, B. 40% ammoniated rice straw + 50% concentrate + 10% L. leucocephala, C. 40% ammoniated rice straw + 40% concentrate +10, + 20% L.leucocephala.The results showed that the addition of L. leucocephala increased digestibility of NDF, ADF, and Cellulose, RUP (rumen undegradable protein) and reduced protozoa population and methane production (p < 0.05). Increased doses of L.leucocephala up to 20% reduce fiber digestibility of feed substances compared to a dose of 10% but are still higher than controls. The results of this study concluded that L.leucocephala supplementation in TMR based on ammoniated rice straw in vitro improved digestibility, fermentability, and reduced methane gas production. Supplementation of 10% and 20% L. leucocephala needs further research, to see the effect on livestock in vivo. © 2019 International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology.

AB  - Although semiarid regions present a poor rainfall distribution throughout the year, the most frequently used mathematical model describing the litter decomposition rate (LDR) predicts the same behavior of crop residues behavior in dry and rainy seasons. The aim of this study was to design a mathematical model to describe the LDR by a means of piecewise continuous function depending on the rainfall quantity. A field experiment was conducted from October 2009 to September 2010 at Brejo Paraibano, Paraíba, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 6 × 12 factorial arrangement, with six plant residues, brachiaria (Brachiaria decumbens Stapf), corn (Zea mays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis L.), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Hunth), and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam.), and 12 collection periods. Using data obtained from an experimental field, a mathematical model was developed. The proposed model is based on the concept of infinite series. It was verified that in dry seasons the LDR can be well described by a linear function whereas in rainy ones an exponential function describes it better. Statistical analysis showed good agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical model. For the model, the decomposition coefficients for each culture and each period are proposed. © 2018 Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a potential source of polyphenols widely available in southern Mexico. This work highlights the extraction of polyphenols from Leucaena leucocephala leaves waste (LLEPs) and the evaluation of their efficiency to remove the single and multicomponent Pb(II) and Cd(II) metal ions from aqueous solutions. Batch test conditions were carried out to examine the effects of contact time, initial metal ion concentration, and adsorbent dosage on the biosorption process. The surface textures and the composition of the LLEP biosorbent was characterized using pH of point of zero charge (pHPZC), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, respectively. Further analysis using ATR-FTIR after adsorption contact of biosorbent was also investigated. The highest Langmuir saturation monolayer adsorption capacity, qm, for the removal of Pb(II) by LLEPs was obtained as 25.51 and 21.55 mg/g in mono- and bimetal solutions, respectively. The pseudo-second-order model provided the best fit for the kinetic data obtained for the removal of Pb(II), Cd(II), and their mixture, and the k2 values depend on the adsorbent mass. This implied that the chemisorption process might be the mechanism of the solute ions-LLEPs interaction in this study. Furthermore, nearly 100% removal of lead and cadmium individually and 95% of their mixture was found using 0.9 g of LLEPs. © 2019 C. A. Cimá-Mukul et al.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala, which originates from Central America, has severely invaded the western Hengchun Peninsula and the Penghu Archipelago in Taiwan. This study conducted several physical and chemical control experiments aimed at preventing invasion by this species. Regarding physical control, although adult L. leucocephala trees were cut down and new sprouts were cut out once a month for 12 times, sprouting could still not be inhibited. After felling adult trees, the stumps were covered with a thick black plastic sheet. No sprouting occurred in the covered area, yet new sprouts emerged from an uncovered area nearby. Shading treatment using shading nets to reduce the relative light intensity to 5% significantly reduced 63% of the amount and 30% of the length of the sprouts, and rendered L. leucocephala seedlings unable to survive. Girdling treatment caused the upper trunk and branches above the girdled area to wither; however, sprouts still grew from the lower edge of the girdled area. Regarding chemical control, smearing herbicide (glyphosate) either on the cut surface of the stumps or on the girdled area of trunks did not inhibit sprouting. However, injection of 3 ml of glyphosate into the trunk of L. leucocephala during the dry season considerably inhibited the crown sprouting ratio (to < 10%), but during the rainy season, the injection was less effective (with a sprouting ratio of > 22%). Thus, this study suggests that injection of glyphosate into the trunk is the most effective method to eliminate L. leucocephala. However, if herbicide usage is not an option, further investigation could focus on the effectiveness of felling adult trees, shading the stumps, and intensively cutting out new sprouts to inhibit the sprouting of L. leucocephala. © 2019 Taiwan Forestry Research Institute.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a multipurpose tropical tree-legume that is highly resistant to many biotic and abiotic stresses. Leucaena is used primarily as an animal fodder owing to its protein-rich foliage. However, leucaena foliage also contains mimosine, a toxic non-protein amino acid that can cause alopecia, goiter and other thyroid problems, infertility and fetal death. Considering its toxicity and abundance in leucaena, it is important to quantify the mimosine concentrations in leucaena under different environmental conditions. Mimosine was extracted from various types of leucaena tissue exposed to a range of environmental conditions and then quantified by HPLC. The mimosine concentrations in leucaena treated with NaCl increased after 6 days of treatment and remained relatively high when treatment continued for 18 days. Interestingly, leucaena exposed to complete darkness for up to 5 days had a higher mimosine concentration than control plants exposed to normal light/dark photoperiods. On the other hand, drying leucaena leaflets or macerating them in an alkaline buffer significantly lowered their mimosine concentration. Mature leaflets that had fallen off the plant and dried out also contained significantly less mimosine than fresh leaflets. The results of this study indicate that mimosine concentrations in leucaena are affected by environmental conditions and this knowledge can assist in managing to prevent toxicity. © 2019.

AB  - Intensive silvopastoral systems are being increasingly disseminated in the tropical areas of Mexico, Central and South America, so it is important to know the quality of the animal products generated in these systems. Fatty acid profile of fresh soft cheese (Domiati type) produced from milk of cows grazing Leucaena leucocephala associated with Cynodon nlemfuensis in an intensive silvopastoral system (ISS) was evaluated and compared with a cheese produced from cows grazing a traditional monoculture system (MS) of C. nlemfuensis. The legume L. leucocephala contains phenolic compounds that could affect the fatty acid biohydrogenation in the rumen and therefore the fatty acid profile of resultant milk and cheese. Milk samples from cows in both diets (systems) were processed monthly for cheese making and cheese samples were analyzed for fatty acid profile. The experimental period lasted for 10 months covering the rainy and dry season of a tropical area in Mexico. The results showed that the cheese produced in ISS had significantly lower content (P<0.05) of the saturated fatty acids lauric, myristic and palmitic and significantly higher content (P<0.05) of stearic, linoleic and γ-linolenic acids. Additionally, higher content (P<0.05) of the polyunsaturated fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids were found in the cheese from ISS. The results suggest that fresh soft cheese produced from silvopastoral systems based on L. leucocephala has a better fatty acid profile than that produced from the traditional MS with grass only. © 2019 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

AB  - In sheep silvopastoral systems, forage legumes are promising alternatives to commercial feed since they can lower costs. An evaluation was done comparing productive and ingestive behavior parameters in hair sheep in silvopastoral and stabled systems for four months. Nine variables were evaluated: dry matter intake (DMI); organic matter intake (OMI); crude protein intake (CPI); neutral detergent fiber intake (NDFI); daily weight gain (DWG); feeding time (FT); rumination (RT); walking (WT); and other activities time (OAT). Experimental animals were eighteen sheep (initial weight= 16.83 x 2.57 kg) distributed in a completely random design, with three treatments: a silvopastoral system (SPS) including the legume Leucaena leucocephala and the grass Cynodon plectostachyus (L+E); another SPS including L. leucocephala and the grass Panicum maximum (L+M); and a stabled weight-gain system (SWS). Orthogonal contrasts were applied to compare the SWS vs SPSs and the two SPSs. Compared to the two SPSs, all intakes (DMI= 1246.2 g; OMI= 1073.0 g; CPI= 157.1 g; and NDFI= 364.0 g animal d-1) and DWG (195 g animal d-1) were higher (P<0.001) in the SWS. Daily weight gain did not differ between the SPSs (102 and 114 g animal d-1), but all intakes were higher (P<0.001) in L+M (DMI= 772.2 g; OMI= 662.7 g; CPI= 124.0 g; and NDFI= 334.2 g animal d-1) than in L+E (DMI= 548.9 g; OMI= 86.20 g; CPI= 483.0 g; NDFI= 252.3 g animal d-1). Feeding time (FT) was shortest (P<0.001) in the SWS (148.33 min). Between the SPSs, FT was shortest (P<0.05) in the L+E (318.3 min) than in the L+M (344.6 min). Time dedicated to other activities was longer (P<0.001) in the SWS (247.9 min) than in the SPSs. Silvopastoral systems combining legumes and grasses provided sufficient growth in hair sheep although the stabled weight gain system produced faster growth in the studied time period. © 2019 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

AB  - Greenhouse experiment was conducted for four months using Leucaena leucocephala and Pleurotus tuber-regium to determine their bioremediation potentials. Leucaena leucocephala, Pleurotus tuber-regium and Leucaena leucocephala combined with Pleurotus tuber-regium were tested for their ability to improve nutrient (N, P, K, total organic carbon) and reduce heavy metals (Zn, Ni, Pb, Cu) of soil polluted with spent engine oil [5% (v/w)] and soil without spent engine oil was used as control. Bioaccumulation of nutrients and heavy metals in Leucaena leucocephala and Pleurotus tuber-regium were also determined. The highest reduction in Zn, Ni, Pb and Cu (41%, 48.39%, 61.60 and 52.72% respectively) were recorded in soil remediated with Leucaena leucocephala alone, reduction of 30.40%, 26.53%, 48.07% and 39.60% respectively were recorded in soil remediated with Pleurotus tuber-regium alone while in soil remediated with combined Pleurotus tuber-regium and Leucaena leucocephala, reductions of 32.7%, 33.43%, 88.41% and 46.22% respectively were recorded. Bioaccumulation of Zn, Ni, Pb and Cu in Leucaena leucocephala increased by 73.41%, 85.46%, 3366.04% and 125.53% respectively, similarly in Pleurotus tuber-regium by 30.16%, 21.67%, 71.11% and 53.21% respectively. These studies have shown that Pleurotus tuber-regium and Leucaena leucocephala are capable of bioremediating spent engine oil polluted soil although, treatment with Leucaena leucocephala alone tends to be most effective of these treatments. © 2019 University of Tehran.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the productive potential and mineral composition of the forage cactus IPA-Sertânia (Nopalea cochenillifera Salm Dyck). This species was analyzed both in monoculture and intercropped with leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit.] and gliricidia [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq. Steud.], and was assessed with different sources of manure (cattle, sheep, goat, and broiler litter) serving as fertilizer. The experiment was conducted at the Experimental Station of the Instituto Agronômico de Pernambuco in Caruaru, PE, Brazil. Treatments were allocated in a split-plot arrangement in a randomized complete block design, with four replications. Main plots consisted of cropping systems, while the split-plots were dedicated to manure sources. Cactus harvest was carried out after two years of regrowth. Response variables included both production and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) concentrations. No differences were observed for cactus production between the cropping systems, with an average value of 22.1Mg dry matter ha-1 2 years-1. In the intercropped systems, greater proximity to the legumes increased the production of the cactus in the treatments with the cattle and sheep manure, and increased the concentrations of P, K, and Mg, but not of N. The introduction of tree legumes, along with the application of manure, contributes to an increase in production and nutrient concentration of IPA-Sertânia cactus. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Identification of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) to be used as a bio-inoculum during the revegetatior process of mine spoil dumps becomes necessary since they can aid in the successful establishment of the plants which leads to healthy plant microbe interaction in the rhizosphere. In this study, the potential metabolites pro duced by a predominant PGPR strain of Bacillus subtilis isolated from Leucaena leucocephala (C.N-Subabul family Leguminaosae) from lignite mines of Neyveli, Tamil Nadu were assessed. In addition to the production of indole acetic acid (41//g/mL) and gibberellic acid (75.15//g/mL) in substantial amounts, the organism was able tc produce phytochemical constituents, like phenols, proteins, amino acids and various other secondary metabolites as revealed by FTIR, HPLC and GC-MS analysis. The study of the contribution of rhizobacteria in stabilizing the plant microbe interaction can further lead to the development of biofertilizers to improve soil productivity in i disturbed ecosystem, like mine soil dumps. © 2019 Scientific Publishers.

AB  - While Leucaena leucocephala grows wild in Thailand, some Leucaena spp. have been introduced and evaluated for their edible forage yield and quality. Experiments on appropriate management were performed in different environments and productivity was found to be affected by species or cultivar. Environmental conditions, plant spacing, age of plant and cutting height significantly affected growth and performance. Edible forage yield was in the range of 5?6 t DM/ha/yr. Most species and cultivars contain high protein concentrations and are suitable for use as feed supplements as well as total ration for livestock. The effects of leucaena feeding on livestock are shown in lower mortality and increased productivity. While the leaf meal processing of leucaena for livestock feeding is increasingly recognized and practiced, cultivation of this crop is still minimal and insignificant. The role and importance of leucaena for livestock production, as well as its nutritional quality and factors which limit its use, are reviewed. The need for increased cultivation and integration of leucaena into local farming systems is emphasized. There is an urgent need to increase research support for the efficient cultivation of leucaena and an education campaign to dispel concerns about toxicity aspects. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - Tithonia diversifolia is a bushy forage plant with high biomass production, rapid post-harvest recovery, and good feed composition values (especially protein levels). It is a promising alternative raw material for incrementing protein content in livestock feeds, but its response to different fertilization regimes has received limited attention. An evaluation was done of this species’ yield, composition and nutritional quality values at six different fertilization levels. Experimental design was a completely random block design with six treatments to measure nutrient extraction and its relationship to plant agronomic parameters (biomass production, leaf:stem ratio, plant height at cut, stem count per plant), nutritional value and in vitro digestibility. Fertilization produced an overall improvement in T. diversifolia agronomic and composition values: compared to the control, biomass increased five-fold in response to fertilization, protein production four-fold and energy production was significantly higher. The best overall response was observed with fertilization using 28.1 g urea, 15.8 g DAP and 10.1 g KCl after each harvest cut. © 2019 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria. All rights reserved.

AB  - Clonal propagation method was developed for Leucaena clones (L. leucocephala and L. diversifolia) using lateral shoots which gave many advantages over the conventional method of using nodal stem cuttings. Lateral shoots of 25–30 cm length with apical buds emerging at 30–60° angle from stock plants maintained in sand beds gave higher rooting than nodal stem cuttings. Anatomical configuration of stem cuttings taken at positions 1–4 from shoot apex differed significantly between lateral and nodal cuttings and E. camaldulensis used as control. Rooting was significantly higher (87%) at 25–30 cm length (position 4) in lateral shoots (where vessel frequency was highest) compared with other positions (28–43%) and nodal cuttings (16–53%), whereas Eucalyptus stem cuttings had higher frequency of vessels of lower diameter and > 80% rooting at all positions. Rooting occurred in Leucaena lateral shoots within 20 days of misting with roots emerging all around the stem along a length of 2 cm from base of the cutting. Lateral cuttings produced significantly higher number of roots (22 roots per plant) than nodal cuttings (6 roots per plant) with significant reduction in nursery period (60 days), better rooting (> 80%) and root architecture. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - Many browse plants are undervalued due to insufficient knowledge about their potential feeding value. The study was conducted to evaluate the chemical composition, in vitro ruminal dry matter degradability (DRD) and dry matter intake of Melia azedarach, Leucaena leucocephala, Searsia lancea, Moringa oleifera and Acacia hebeclada. Matured leaves were collected and dried at room temperature and then analyzed in a completely randomized design. Chemical composition, ruminal dry matter degradability and dry matter intake were determined and estimated, respectively. The crude protein (CP) content ranged from 108.0 to 258.3 g/kg DM and neutral detergent fiber from 306.1 to 492.7 g/kg DM. In vitro dry matter degradability at all incubation periods for M. oleifera was significantly higher than those of other browse plants. There was a negative correlation between metabolizable energy and fiber content and a positive correlation to crude protein content. All browse species had CP values of above 10% which is above the minimum required in diet for adequate digestive activities. M. oleifera, L. leucocephala and M. azedarach leaves had the highest metabolizable energy, dry matter intake, total digestible nutrients, relative feed value and dry matter degradability compared to other browse plants. The results from the study suggest that M. oleifera, M. azedarach and L. leucocephala can be recommended to be used as a supplement during dry season and in case of low-quality forage feeding. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Melissopalynology was used to determine the botanical origin of honey, which is important for its traceability. Forty samples of honey from the counties of Santa Helena (20) and Terra Roxa (20), the western region of Paraná, Southern Brazil, were analyzed according to the pollen types and comparisons with pollen catalogs and specialized literature. Regarding analytics quality, 300 grains of pollen per sample were identified. In the samples from Santa Helena, 71 pollen types of 24 families were found, classified as Hovenia dulcis monofloral honey (8) and the remainder as polyfloral (12). In the samples from Terra Roxa, 64 pollen types belonging to 29 families were classified as monofloral Glycine max (7), Mimosa scabrella Benth (2), Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth (1), Mimosa verrucosa Benth (1), Mikania (1), and Senecio (1) and as polyfloral (7). The two locations have a high similarity index; however, the predominance of some pollen types indicates the botanical specificity of the locality. For Santa Helena, a greater significance was observed for H. dulcis pollen, Eucalyptus, Parapiptadenia rigida, and Leucaena leucocephala; in Terra Roxa, the pollen types G. max, M. scabrella, and Eucalyptus had more incidents. Despite the similarity index, the indicators show differences between the producing areas. The samples of honey from Santa Helena presented higher pollen diversity in relation to the samples of Terra Roxa, reflecting the predominant vegetative cover of riparian forests and agricultural crops, respectively, in each county. © 2019 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

AB  - Forage legumes such as Leucaena leucocephala, besides being a rich source of protein for animal feed, its inclusion in silvopastoral systems provides fundamental components to improve soil properties. These plants have the ability to establish symbiotic association with the genus Rhizobium sp. and fix biologically atmospheric nitrogen favoring growth and development, being reflected in production increases. The objective of this research was to evaluate the capacity of native isolates of Rhizobium sp. and a commercial strain in biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in L. leucocephala plants. Two separate bioassays to evaluate the efficiency of the FBN of the native isolates and the commercial strain under greenhouse conditions, followed by a randomized complete block design with 7 × 2 factorial arrangement, seven treatments, two factors: native isolates and commercial strains and bacterial concentrations (106 and 108 cells.ml-1), with three repetitions and five experimental units. The first bioassay was carried out with seeds, determining the percentage of germination, the length and thickness of the stem, number of leaves, dry weight of the aerial part, number of nodule/plant and the percentage of nitrogen accumulated in the area part of the plant. In the second bioassay with 30-day-old seedlings, the same variables of the first bioassay were determined, with the exception of the percentage of germination. In the first bioassay, a greater stimulation was found in the germination of L. leucocephala seeds at a concentration of 108 cells.mL-1. Regarding stem length and thickness, accumulated dry matter, leaf development and nitrogen accumulation, better results were found in the treatments with the native isolates L27, L36 and L38 in a concentration of 106 cells.mL-1 above the commercial strain in concentration of 108 cells.mL-1. The native isolates of Rhizobium sp. exert a positive effect on the FBN and the germination of plants of L. leucocephala, which will allow to conduct future field studies that allow to potentiate the culture of L. leucocephala and silvopastoral systems for bovine feeding. © 2019 Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - The Center for Research in Sustainable Systems of Agricultural Production (CIPAV) has worked since 1991 on the establishment and management of intensive silvopastoral systems (ISPS) involving leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). The initial work was carried out in the Valle del Cauca department, and afterwards in other regions of Colombia and abroad. This document presents the main characteristics of the work carried out on various farms in the tropical lowlands of Colombia, located between 0 and 1,300 masl, with 22-28 °C average annual temperature. The leucaena ISPS integrate this species with grasses, mainly Cynodon plectostachyus, C. nlemfuensis and Megathyrsus maximus, although other species have been used, such as Dichanthium annulatum, Urochloa humidicola (including cv. Llanero, formerly classified as Brachiaria dictyoneura) and Urochloa hybrids. Leucaena is planted at densities in excess of 10,000 plants per ha, in rows 1 to 1.5 m apart with 0.3-0.6 m between plants within rows. These ISPS are grazed by Bos indicus and B. taurus cattle and their crosses, in beef, dairy (tropical lowlands) and dual-purpose systems. The proper management of an ISPS requires a rotational grazing strategy with each paddock grazed for 1-3 days (ideally 1 day) followed by a 42-46 day rest period. Stocking rates are 2.5-4.5 head/ha. Average daily gains by beef cattle are 650-800 g/head (2-3 kg/ha/d). Production in dairy systems (tropical lowlands) fluctuates between 5 and 14 L milk/cow/d, depending on genetic makeup, season (dry or rainy) and supplementation, with up to 17,000 L milk/ha/yr. Information from various farms that use ISPS is presented including main ecological characteristics and animal performance. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - Since its introduction to India in 1976 Leucaena leucocephala ssp. glabrata has spread rapidly, especially in the last couple of decades, mainly due to its use as either firewood or pulpwood. Use of its foliage for feeding livestock has been mainly a by-product of this activity. The foliage is highly nutritious because it has high protein concentration and good palatability, and the tree can withstand repeated defoliation. Research carried out by Indian scientists on leucaena has focused on mainly agronomic management, agroforestry studies of mixed cropping systems, mimosine toxicity, germplasm testing and economic evaluation. Feeding leucaena has had a positive impact on the dairy industry in particular. It is rarely purchased for fodder and is usually poached by smallholders from existing plantations, most of which are established by animal rearers for their own purposes. More widespread use of leucaena for fodder could be achieved in India by introducing varieties with either reduced seed production or sterile ones, which can be easily propagated vegetatively. In addition, psyllid resistance, suitable mechanized harvesting methods and training livestock owners in proper management of leucaena trees should help in making this high quality fodder more popular in India. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - Understanding carbon (C) dynamics of the silvopastoral systems can help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the C concentration and storage in above- and belowground tree biomass as well as in the soils of fodder banks of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) or a combination of the both species. The above- and belowground biomass was quantified by the destructive sampling. We also obtained samples from soil pits, 20-cm deep, and determined bulk density and organic carbon concentration. The mixed species banks produced more foliage dry matter (DM) (6.3 t DM/ha) than the pure fodder banks. The total living biomass stocks ranged from 31.5 to 33.5 t DM/ha and did not differ between fodder bank types. The tissue C concentration was greater in stems (45.1%) and roots (44.9%) compared to the foliage component (43.4%). Total soil carbon (TSC) in the 5–10 cm layer was greater in the fodder banks with legumes alone than in mixed species banks (35.7 vs. 30.8 t C/ha). TSC storage in the 15–20 cm layer was greater in the nonlegume fodder bank than in the legume fodder bank (39.8 vs. 34.5 t C/ha). However, to the 0–20 cm layer, TSC was similar for all fodder banks. Thus, the three types of fodder banks had similar total C storage in plant biomass and soil, but the production of foliage biomass was higher in the mixed species banks. © 2018 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - Attributes of the shrub and tree species components of the tropical deciduous forest within the Municipality of Querétaro, Querétaro are described. We used a random sampling of 36 sites of natural vegetation with exclusion criteria. Sites were delimited to a 25 m × 25 m quadrant. Within the quadrant, the species of all individuals of the tree and shrub species greater than 150 cm were identified, not taking into account the Cactaceae and Succulents. Measurements were made of the trees: basal diameter, diameter at breast height, total tree height, canopy height and diameter; carbon capture by species was estimated taking into account the climatic site variables, where they grow. Twenty-two species of shrubs and trees were observed, with Acacia schaffneri, Bursera fagaroides, Forestiera phillyreoides, Karwinskia humboldtiana, Dodonaea viscosa and Ipomea murucoides being the most abundant, while the ones with the highest carbon content are species such as: Prosopis laevigata and Leucaena leucocephala and the less abundant were Randia thurberi and Erytrina coralloides. These results are indispensable for developing and designing proposals for reforestation and conservation of the tropical deciduous forest. © 2019, Instituto de Ecologia, A.C.. All rights reserved.

AB  -                              The aim of this study to measure adaptation of callus Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Tarramba) after gamma irradiation on regenerative media. Lamtoro plant breeding in the form of callus with gamma ray irradiation is required for the development of a new plant-tolerant strain line with a gene mutation approach in tissue culture. The experimental design in this study was a complete randomized design (CRD). There were 13 treatments consitsing of control (M0). 6-benzyl amino purine (BAP) media (M1-M4). kinetin media (M5-M8). and combination of BAP and kinetin media (M9-M12) during 8 weeks. The measured variables were viability of callus. the addition of diameter and height callus. colour and texture callus. Data were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and continued with Duncan test if there were a significant difference among treatment. Data of viability colour and texture used descriptive analysis. The data showed that formulation media M12 (combination 1 mg L                             -1                              BAP and 1 mg L                             -1                              kinetin) was significantly different (P < 0.05) in 8 week after plant (WAP). It was concluded that the best regenerative media for adaptation of callus lamtoro was combination of BAP and kinetin media.                          © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Improving the nitrogen cycling in livestock systems through silvopastoral systems
PY  - 2019

AB  - Conventional livestock are monoculture systems where the major species are native grasses or African grasses, with biomass production being limited by seasonality of rainfall and low soil fertility. In animal production systems, the pasture degradation is associated with the nitrogen (N) cycle. Therefore, if farmer applied no subsequent fertilizer, milk production or live weight gains have been gradually reduced. As animals slowly gain weight, they produce more methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). This has led to the search for strategies to help minimize the impacts of livestock, and the excessive application of fertilizers, on the environment and natural resources. One strategy with promising results that has been developed in Latin America is the conversion of traditional livestock systems to silvopastoral systems (SPS), which include the establishment of shrub legumes at high densities and forage grasses aimed at increasing livestock profitability. With the association of legumes and forage grasses, forage quality can increase, more than 100%, compared to monoculture-based pastures and, consequently, production costs related to the purchase of imported cereal grains and nitrogen fertilizers are reduced. On the other hand, changes in climate and graz-ing pressure to increase stocking rate have resulted in extensive degradation of existing vulnerable pastures, which favour poorly palatable, perennial species affecting directly livestock production and enhancing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the loss of soil carbon and nitrogen stock severely affecting soil fertility. The importance of the association of species of legumes with grasses and Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala L., (Lam.) de Wit) is an environmentally friendly proposal of positive interactions to improve soil fertility and animal productivity. Overall, improving forage quality and N efficiency of dietary nutrients is an effective way of decreasing GHG. Silvopastoral systems (SPS) are used successfully in many regions around the world, and there is considerable evidence that SPS can increase production efficiency, increase carbon sequestration and improve N cycling on land used for livestock production. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the impact of one of tannin-rich legumes, Leucaena leucocephala, on lactating small ruminant performance. To do this, twenty two late pregnant Blackbelly ewes (17 days before lambing) were randomly divided into two groups. First group received mixed diet consist of hay + 750 g of leucaena pellets + 1000 g of green banana, for the second group, leucaena was replaced by alfalfa pellets as a control diet. After lambing, animals were divided into four groups to feed alfalfa, alfalfa+banana, leucaena, leucaena+banana in present of hay for all animals. No significant differences were observed on dry matter intake, milk production (632 vs 582 ml), weight loss (0.16 vs 1.69 kg) and lambs daily weight gain (201 vs 193.4 g/day) for alfalfa vs leucaena comparisons with a slight decrease of colostrum production (430 vs 324 ml) for the leucaena (P=0.124). The presence of banana in leucaena and alfalfa diets did not show a significant effect on the studied parameters. It was concluded that leucaena could replace alfalfa in rations with no depressive effect on lactating ewe's performance. © 2019 Wageningen Academic Publishers. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of incorporating different protein sources (oil seed cakes versus Leucaena leucocephala hay) in a total mixed ration (TMR) on intake, digestibility, growth and carcass meat quality of Saanen goats. Sixteen Saanen male goats were allocated to TMR diets formulated with or without L. leucocephala hay at 25% of total dry matter (DM). The TMRs were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous, iso-caloric and iso-neutral detergent fibre using two sources of crude protein from Leucaena hay or oilseed cake meal (OSCM), which is a blend of soybean, sunflower and cottonseed cake meal. Data were collected on nutrient digestibility and carcass quality parameters. The goats fed TMR with Leucaena had greater (P <0.05) dry matter intake compared with those fed the control diet. In contrast, the digestibility of DM, organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and feed conversion ratio did not differ (P >0.05) between the two dietary treatments. Between treatments, no differences were detected for slaughter bodyweight, empty bodyweight carcass weight, and dressing percentage. Nor were differences detected (P >0.05) for cooking loss percentage, back fat cover, and area of eye muscle (longissimus dorsi) and Warner-Bratzler shear force between goats fed the two TMR diets. Replacing a portion of oilseed cake meal at 15% DM with Leucaena hay at 25% DM in TMR for Saanen goats would help rural farmers to reduce the cost of feeding. © 2019 South African Bureau for Scientific Publications.

AB  - Corrosion inhibition analysis of Leucaena leucocephala leaves extract (LLE) as an additive incorporated into a commercialized coating to protect mild steel when immersed in seawater has been successfully conducted. The procedures involve the utilization of multiple techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization and scanning electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). The result of FTIR identified both hydroxyl (–OH) and carbonyl (C=O) groups indicating the presence of phenolic compounds in the extract whereas the analysis obtained from UV-Vis showed a peak absorption spectrum at 268 nm. The electrochemical analysis indicated an excellent inhibition efficiency up to 96.12% for the immersed mild steel coated with 6% of LLE coating. Furthermore, based on the study of polarization, a drastic decrease of corrosion rate at 0.2791 mm/year was observed for the same coating as compared to the uncoated substrate, which was 2.3991 mm/year. The study also confirmed that LLE acts as a mixed type inhibitor, as shown in the polarization curve. The morphological evaluation displayed a smooth and homogenous surface with less salt precipitation for 6% of LLE coating as compared to other types of coating affirming it to be the optimum concentration for this evaluation study. © 2019, Russian Association of Corrosion Engineers.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) is widely recognized in many countries as a commercially valuable plant, particularly when used as a nutritious fodder in subtropical and tropical regions. However, it is also considered an environmental weed in some countries due to its ability to form dense infestations in disturbed areas, where it is not proactively managed or grazed. These different perspectives have made leucaena a contentious species. Ideally, landholders and relevant jurisdictions in charge of invasive species need to work together to minimize its spread as a weed and manage existing infestations. To date, the response has been varied, ranging from no action through to some jurisdictions formally recognizing leucaena as an environmental weed within relevant legislation and applying requirements to minimize its impact. Between these extremes, there are initiatives such as an industry Code of Practice (i.e. The Leucaena Network in Australia), recommending that those growing leucaena adhere to certain principles and practices to minimize the risk of spread from their operations. The biology of weed leucaena (e.g. large seed production, relatively long-lived seed banks) and the situations in which it spreads (e.g. roadsides and riparian systems) pose management challenges to landholders and relevant jurisdictions. Adaptive management and experimental research are necessary to identify effective control strategies for a range of situations. © 2019, Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT).

AB  - Wood of the Lead tree (Leucaena Leucocephala) is pyrolyzed in an Iwasaki kiln to produce charcoal with a graphitic-like structure with a surface area of 329 m2/g. The charcoal is ground into 3 different particle sizes (large, medium, and small) and activated with carbon dioxide to produce activated carbon. The structure, morphology, elemental composition, porosity, and functional groups of the activated carbon samples are compared with the charcoal precursor. The larger particle size of the charcoal gives activated carbon with a larger surface area, up to 609 m2/g. In addition, wood vinegar is collected during the pyrolysis at 3 temperature ranges and extracted by n-hexane, diethyl ether, and ethyl acetate. The compositions depend on the collecting temperature. The main components are ketones, organic acids, furan and pyran derivatives, esters, phenols and derivatives, alcohols, and alkanes. © 2006 Institue of Research and Development, Suranaree Unvercity of Technology.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide many environmental services and its study is the basis for strategies of conservation and recovery. Its plant structure is the result of the spatial arrangement of the species based on environmental conditions and the availability of resources. The bay of Xpicob, Campeche, Mexico is a critical habitat for protected species of marine fauna. To describe its vegetation, a representative strip of 3.5 km along the coast was chosen, dividing it into four zones based on altitude, terrain relief and degree of human intervention. In total, 1,406 individuals were sampled, distributed in 30 species grouped into 17 representative families of the medium subdeciduous forest and wetlands, confirming their ecotone character. The most abundant family was Fabaceae and Leucaena leucocephala the most representative species, with an abundance of 450 individuals and a density of 14.62 ind ha-1. The alpha diversity analyzes reflect that the richness of species and families is related to an altitude gradient; it was higher in less elevated sites and contiguous to the jungle, where the equity of species was also greater. The beta diversity analysis and cluster reflected a partial replacement of endemic plant species influenced by human activity. The results show that the coastal zone of Xpicob is subject to strong anthropogenic pressure that must be considered for restoration and conservation work. © 2018 Los Autores.

AB  - Leucaena planting on private land is increasing due to declining carrying capacity of native pastures in Timor Leste, and feeding 100% leucaena to cattle have started to be a common practice. However, feeding 100% leucaena for cattle fattening may not be economical, therefore it should be combined with crop residues such as maize stover, the most commonly available energy source in Timor Leste. The aim of this experiment was to determine feed intake, feed digestibility, rumen ammonia concentration and live weight gain of fattening Bali bulls feed different combinations of leucaena and maize stover. 12 male Bali cattle were allocated based on body weight into three treatment groups and each group fed either 100% leucaena, 75% leucaena and 25% maize stover or 50% leucaena and 50% maize stover. Feed intake (g OM/kg BW) was significantly higher in the bulls fed 100% leucaena compared to those fed 75% leucaena and 25% maize stover or 50% leucaena and 50% leucaena and 50% maize stover (26.8±1.1, 24.9±1.2 and 22.6±0.2 respectively). Digestibility of organic matter did not differ significantly with declining level of leucaena in the diet (60.6±1.6%, 58.8±2.4% and 53.1±10.2% for diets with 100%, 75% and 50% leucaena respectively). Rumen ammonia concentrations significantly decreased with decreasing level of leucaena in the diet (222±33, 169±5 and 157±24 mg N/L respectively). Live weight gain (kg/d) was significantly higher in bulls consuming 100% leucaena (0.50±0.08) than those fed 75% (0.46±0.07) and 50% leucaena (0.39±0.05). The lowest live weight gain recorded in this experiment was higher than the 0.2 kg/d for growing bulls fed grass only (Dahlanuddin et al 2012). Feed conversion ratio was lower (6.8±0.6 kg DMI/kg ADG) when maize stover was fed at 50% of diet, compared to 6.5 ± 0.6 and 6.2 ± 0.7 for the bulls fed 100% Leucaena and 75% Leucaena + 25% maize stover respectively. The minimum level of leucaena inclusion needed in the leucaena: maize stover combinations was 55% allowing up to 45% maize stover to gain a moderate growth rate. © 2018, Fundacion CIPAV.

TI  - Supplementing water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) with foliage of Mimosa pigra or Leucaena leucocephala and coconut oil; effects on N retention and enteric methane emissions in growing goats
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057720153&partnerID=40&md5=2738a5c15efcc255a0aa274493a0f1de
AB  - Four growing male goats (12.6±1.42kg) were used in a 4*4 Latin square arrangement to compare effect of two factors on feed intake, digestibility, N retention and methane emissions. The first factor was source of tannin (fromMimosa pigra or Leucaena leucocephala); the second factor was coconut oil supplementation with or without at 10g/kg DM intake. Replacing Leucaena with Mimosa pigra as the supplement to water spinach reduced the DM intake, tended to increase the DM digestibility and N retention (p=0.058 and 0.075), improved the biological value of the N (N retained as % of N digested) and the feed conversion (DM intake/N retention) and reduced the ratio of methane to carbon dioxide in expired breath. By contrast, supplementing the diets with coconut oil led to a reduction in rumen methane but had no effect on performance traits. It is hypothesized that the improvements in performance traits (N retention and DMI to N conversion ratio) when Mimosa pigra replaced Leucaena were the consequence of the greater rumen bypass characteristics of the protein in Mimosa pigra associated with the increase in energy metabolism efficiency as a consequence of the reduction in rumen methane. In contrast, the coconut oil although effective in reducing rumen methane did not improve performance traits as measured by daily N retention and N retained per unit DM intake. The condensed tannins, present in a 64% higher concentration in Mimosa pigra than in Leucaena, thus appear to confer two benefits on the host animal: (i) an improvement in rumen bypass characteristics of the protein; and (ii) a reduction in the production of rumen methane. © 2018, Fundacion CIPAV.

Materials and methods: The seeds were sown and six treatments were applied: Rhizophagus intraradices (Schenck & Sm.) Walker & Schüßler (1), the collections “Caracoles” (2), “Rosario Izapa” (3), “Té limón” (4) and “San Rafael” (5), fertilization 15N-15P-15K (6) and a control. Morphological and physiological variables, root colonization and P content were recorded at 120 days. Data were subjected to an analysis of variance and Tukey’s range test (P ? 0.05). Results and discussion: AMF improved plant characteristics in comparison with the control and fertilization. Rhizophagus intraradices caused the highest growth values in the aerial part, mycorrhizal colonization and P content, and the lowest growth in the root system. The “Caracoles” and “Rosario Izapa” isolates promoted height, root biomass and P content higher than “Té limón” and “San Rafael”. Conclusion: AMF allow decreasing chemical fertilization without detriment to the growth of L. leucocephala.

TI  - Improving maize production through nitrogen supply from ten rarely-used organic resources in Ghana
PY  - 2018

AB  - Where there is limited availability of conventional fertilizers, the use of organic materials is considered a viable alternative to increase the productive capacity of soils. Many potential plant residues remain underutilized due to limited research on their use as a nutrient source. In this study, the nitrogen supplying capabilities of ten rarely-used leaf biomass sources (Acacia auriculiformis, Baphia nitida, Albizia zygia, Azadirachta indica, Senna siamea, Senna spectabilis, Tithonia diversifolia, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Zea mays) were tested based on their nutrient content, N mineralization patterns and effect on maize yield (in comparison with inorganic fertilizer). N mineralization was studied in the laboratory using an incubation experiment. Field trials were also established using a randomized complete block design. Plant residues were applied at 5 t dry matter ha−1 a week before planting maize while fertilizer was split-applied at 90 kg N ha−1 on designated plots. From the results on plant residue chemistry, most of the plant residues recorded relatively high N concentration (≥24.9 g kg−1) and low C/N ratio (≤20.1) although neither N content nor C/N ratio significantly (p > 0.05) affected their N mineralization patterns. Leaf biomass application of B. nitida, A. auriculiformis, A. zygia and maize stover resulted in an initial net N immobilization that lasted for 14 days. Application of all plant materials significantly increased the biological yield and N uptake of maize with G. sepium and T. diversifolia producing the greatest impact especially in the major rainy season. Relative to the control, total grain yield after four cropping seasons was comparable between inorganic fertilizer (9.2 t ha−1), G. sepium (8.8 t ha−1) and T. diversifolia (9.4 t ha−1) treatments. The results on maize biological yield were significantly correlated with the effects of the treatments on N uptake. The findings suggest that in locations where inorganic fertilizers are limited, leaf biomass from G. sepium and T. diversifolia could offer the most suitable option in comparison with the other species used in this study. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - As a direct effect of its rapid growth, Leucaena leucocephala tree could be a leading raw material for bio-based composite panels. This fast growing tree and lesser used species in the wood industry can expand the choice of raw material for production of value added products. In this study, board properties of OSB using smaller strand size of Leucaena leucocephala as core layer, physical and mechanical properties were found to be affected significantly by board density and resin content except for MOR in minor axis. However, strand size did not affect physical and mechanical properties except for MOR in major axis. Effects of board density on the mechanical properties were found to affect significantly different. The board density showed a significant effect on thickness swelling with a positive correlation. There is no significant difference on bending properties, internal bond strength and thickness swelling between combination of strand size of S1+S3 and S2+S3. Effect of resin content on bending properties showed significant difference of MOR in major axis and MOE values in both major and minor axis. Generally all treatment of OBS passed the general requirement of general purpose OSB even when the resin is as low as 5%. © 2018 Authors.

AB  - The effect of management was evaluated to prevent leucaena becoming an invasive plant. For five years, the evolution of two systems was studied: 1) tree legume Leucaena leucocephala c v. Peru in silvopastoral system, where it occupied 100 % of the area, associated with Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandú for cattle fattening; 2) tree legume Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru, where it occupied 100 % of the area, associated with Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandú without being grazed. A random block design was applied, with five replications. Indicators in the leucaena-brachiaria system with animal grazing were better, at the beginning and at the end of the experiment, with a decrease in the depopulation of 1 plant/m2 (P = 0.0012), higher grass population 11.2/m2 (P = 0.0014) and low presence of weeds 1 plant/m2 (P = 0.0039), which was better in the system without grazing. Leucaena component had a different performance, according to the studied system. In the system under grazing, yield of brachiaria base grass was always superior (2.2 and 3.0 t/ha DM) with respect to the non-managed system, at the beginning (P = 0.0028) and at the end of the experimental stage. The same happened with the presence of natural grass 0.40 t/ha DM (P=0.0011), which disappeared at the end. Weeds had a higher presence in the non-managed area 0.31 t/ha DM (P = 0.0101) at the beginning of the study. It is concluded that the technological proposal for the management of systems with Leucaena leucocephala in silvopastoral systems is a functional and feasible option to apply so that this species does not become invasive. © 2018 Salisbury State University.

AB  - Overcoming shortage of raw material for particleboard manufacturing in Malaysia is crucial. Using fast growing forest plantation species such as Leucaena leucocephala provide a possibility. The study investigates the physical and mechanical properties of particleboard (density 700 kgm3) from Leucaena leucocephala with variables of resin content (10, 12 & 14 %). and particle size (1.0 mm, 2.0 mm & Unscreen). Resin used was melamine urea formaldehyde, for high moisture resistance particleboard. It is aimed for use at flooring and wet kitchen cabinet. Resin content influence physical and mechanical properties of particleboard with increase of resin content. Bigger particle size contributes to better mechanical properties, but higher in absorption of water. The result shows treatments passing minimum requirements of BS EN standard. © 2018 Authors.

AB  - Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men around the world. It is a complex and heterogeneous disease in which androgens and their receptors play a crucial role in the progression and development. The current treatment for prostate cancer is a combination of surgery, hormone therapy, radiation and chemotherapy. Therapeutic agents commonly used in the clinic include steroidal and non-steroidal anti-androgens, such as cyproterone acetate, bicalutamide and enzalutamide. These few agents have multiple adverse effects and are not 100% effective. Several plant compounds and mixtures, including grape seed polyphenol extracts, lycopene and tomato preparations, soy isoflavones, and green tea extracts, have been shown to be effective against prostate cancer cell growth. In vivo activity of some isolated compounds like capsaicin and curcumin was reported in prostate cancer murine models. We prepared a library of plant extracts from traditional Mayan medicine. These plants were selected for their use in the contemporaneous Mayan communities for the treatment of different diseases. The extracts were assessed in a phenotypic screening using LNCaP prostate cancer androgen sensitive cell line, with a fixed dose of 25 μg/mL. MTT assay identified seven out of ten plants with interesting anti-neoplastic activity. Extracts from these plants were subjected to a bioguided fractionation to study their major components. We identified three compounds with anti-neoplastic effects against LNCaP cells, one of which shows selectivity for neoplastic compared to benign cells. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Present emphasis on sustainable agriculture requires successful soil resources management geared towards quality soil environment and crop production. Mulching and application of poultry manure (PM) are easy ways to enhance natural soil-nutrient build-up and soil quality protection. Field experiments were carried out to determine effects of mulching and poultry manure on soil properties, growth and yield of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). The legume mulch types derived from Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, and Acacia auriculiformis, rates of PM (0 or 10.0 t ha-1) were tested over 2015 and 2016. Legume mulch materials, with or without addition of PM, reduced bulk density and soil temperature and increased porosity, moisture content and soil chemical properties compared with the initial soil status before application of treatments. In both years, with or without addition of PM to mulch, Acacia improved soil physical properties and increased soil organic matter (SOM) compared with Leucaena and Gliricidia mulches that increased N, P, K, Ca and Mg compared with Acacia mulch without PM. In 2015, without addition of PM, Gliricidia increased tomato growth and yield compared with Leucaena and Acacia. Acacia with addition of PM had the highest value of growth and yield. In 2016, with or without addition of PM, Acacia increased growth and yield compared with Leucaena and Gliricidia. In 2015, addition of PM to Leucaena, Gliricidia and Acacia mulches increased tomato fruit yield by 40.0, 9.2 and 84.9%, respectively. Also in 2016, addition of PM with Leucaena, Gliricidia and Acacia mulches, increased fruit yield of tomato by 43.0, 45.0 and 52.8%, respectively. Leucaena and Gliricidia mulches enhanced tomato growth and yield through direct nutritional contributions, whereas Acacia mulch did so through mulching effects on soil microclimate. Acacia+PM produced significantly higher yield, therefore adequate application of PM to mulches should be encouraged, especially where farmers use Acacia legume materials as mulch to maximize their contribution to soil and crop productivity. © 2018, University of Zagreb.

AB  - The effective symbiotic activity of rhizobia can contribute increment of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), which is of great importance in low technology regions. This study aimed to evaluate the symbiotic efficiency of native rhizobia from Brazilian Northeast soils for selection of the most efficient and competitive strains for Leucaena leucocephala plant. The greenhouse test was conducted in factorial scheme (7x3), with seven fertilization treatments and three soil classes (Luvisol, Ultisol and Oxisol). The fertilization treatments were: (a) four native rhizobia isolates, obtained from nodules of L. leucocephala grown in Brazilian semiarid soils; (b) recommended strain (SEMIA 6069); (c) control without rhizobia inoculation and without N fertilization; (d) control without rhizobia, but with N fertilization (100 mg kg-1). The plants were harvested at 90 days and the following characteristics were determined: plant height, diameter, shoots dry matter, roots dry matter and nodules dry matter, number of nodules, nitrogen concentration and accumulation in shoots, and efficiency of nitrogen fixation. The isolates 36F and 45G are very promising on Biologic Nitrogen Fixation (BNF). They showed high symbiotic efficiency (higher than 90%). These selected strains provided the best characteristics such as plant height (57 and 52 cm), diameter (4.03 and 4.02 mm), dry matter of shoot (3.2 and 3.6 g plant-1) and nitrogen accumulation in shoots (60 and 65 mg plant-1). © 2018 Southern Cross Publishing.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit subsp. glabrata (Rose) Zarate) in combination with grass pasture is one of the most persistent, productive and sustainable grazing systems used in Queensland, Australia. Nevertheless, a better understanding of the competitive interactions that determine the proportions of leucaena and grass components is needed to optimise the design and management of the hedgerow pasture system. In a water-limited environment, belowground interactions between species are especially influential. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of leucaena plant density and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Kunth) competition on root distribution, evapotranspiration, patterns of soil-water use and the resulting water-use efficiency (WUE) of the leucaena and grass components. Results showed that although leucaena had deeper roots than Rhodes grass, the majority of fine roots of both leucaena and Rhodes grass were in the upper 1.5 m of the soil profile suggesting a high level of competition for water resources. A major factor favouring Rhodes grass was that its root abundance was 8-10 times greater than leucaena, allowing it to compete more effectively for water resources and limit the lateral spread of leucaena roots. Higher cumulative evapotranspiration values were recorded from leucaena grown with Rhodes grass than from leucaena grown in absence of grass. However, this difference was negligible at the highest leucaena density owing to the reduced yield of grass caused by shading and increased water uptake of leucaena. The findings of this study also confirmed the hypothesis that at low tree densities, leucaena-grass pasture will have higher WUE (13.8 kg DM mm -1) than sole leucaena, but this difference was reduced with increments of leucaena density. Highest WUE (65.9 kg DM mm -1) occurred at highest leucaena density with or without grass. © CSIRO.

AB  - This study attempted to examine the acute effect of purified minosine extracted from Leucaena leucocephala on male reproductive system. Adults male mice were divided into 4 groups (n =8); control and 3 experimental groups treated with purified mimosine at different doses of 15, 30, and 60 mg/KgBW, respectively for 7 consecutive days. The morphological features and weights of body and reproductive organs including testis, epididymis plus vas deferens, and seminal vesicle were compared among groups. In addition, epididymal sperm concentration and the changes of histopathology of testicular tissues in all groups were observed. The results showed that mimosine in all doses did not affect mice body weights. However, all doses of mimosine could significantly reduce the absolute and relative weights of testis and seminal vesicle but not of epididymis plus vas deferens. Significantly, mimosine at doses of 30, and 60 mg/KgBw could decrease sperm concentration. Moreover, the seminiferous atrophy and degeneration were obviously found in mimosine treated mice as compared to the control. In conclusion, consumption of Leucaena leucocephala edible parts containing mimosine could damage male reproductive organs which may cause acute male subfertility or infertility. © 2018, Universidad de la Frontera.

AB  - The germination velocity of guaje (Leucaena leucocephala) after planting should be considered in the reforestation of spaces dedicated to grazing in the intertropical zone of hot climates. In the present study scarification treatments were compared in guaje seeds with the objective of evaluating its effect on germinative energy and germination value. The experimental design was completely randomized, with three replications per treatment, and the experimental units were groups of 100 seeds. The treatments were as follows: 1) without scarification; 2) immersion in water at 80 °C for 3 min (hydrothermal); immersions for 12 h in 3) water at 24 °C; 4) ethylic alcohol of 70 °GL; 5) organic thinner diluent, and 6) hydrogen peroxide diluted to 2 %. The seeds were deposited in a clay loam soil substrate and remained exposed to the weather protected by shade mesh. Total germination was higher with hydrothermal scarification (55%) with respect to the other treatments, except for immersion in water (p > 0.05), but with this treatment the germinative energy and viability was the lowest. Immersion in water presented the highest germinative energy (31.66 %), thus it improved germination velocity of the guaje seeds without affecting their germination value and viability. The hydrothermal scarification stimulated total germination and germination value, but it reduced germination velocity with respect to the other treatments, which showed intermediate values of germinative energy. Scarification with organic diluent caused the lowest value of germination (4 %) and total germination (31 %), respectively. The present study makes it possible to conclude that in guaje seeds scarification by immersion in water at 24 °C for 12 h and in water at 80 °C for 3 min favored total germination, but immersion in water increased germination velocity. © 2018, Colegio de Postgraduados.; La velocidad de germinación del guaje (Leucaena leucocephala) después de la siembra debe tenerse en cuenta en la reforestación de espacios dedicados al pastoreo en la zona intertropical de climas cálidos.

Los tratamientos fueron: 1) sin escarificación; 2) inmersión en agua a 80 °C por 3 min (hidrotérmico); inmersiones por 12 h en 3) agua a 24 °C; 4) alcohol etílico de 70 °GL; 5) diluyente orgánico thinner, y 6) peróxido de hidrógeno diluido a 2 %. Las semillas se depositaron en un sustrato de suelo tipo franco arcilloso y permanecieron expuestas a la intemperie protegidas con malla sombra. La germinación total fue mayor con la escarificación hidrotérmica (55 %) respecto a los demás tratamientos excepto para la inmersión en agua (p > 0.05), pero con este tratamiento la energía germinativa y viabilidad fue la más baja. La inmersión en agua presentó la mayor energía germinativa (31.66 %), por lo que mejoró la velocidad de germinación de las semillas de guaje sin afectar su valor de germinación y viabilidad. La escarificación hidrotérmica estimuló la germinación total y valor de germinación, pero redujo la velocidad de germinación con respecto a los otros tratamientos, los cuales mostraron valores intermedios de energía germinativa. La escarificación con diluyente orgánico causó el valor más bajo de germinación (4 %) y de germinación total (31 %), respectivamente. Este estudio permite concluir que en semillas de guaje la escarificación por inmersión en agua a 24 °C por 12 h y en agua a 80 °C por 3 min favorecieron la germinación total, pero la inmersión en agua incrementó la velocidad de germinación. © 2018, Colegio de Postgraduados.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence and abundance of mites in the soil beneath cultivated coffee trees (Coffea arabica L.). In particular, we compared mite communities in three different soil environments: 1) native forest; 2) soils from underneath the coffee trees “under full sun” (i.e. areas that received no additional shade or organic treatment); 3) soils that incorporated organic matter from four leguminous windbreak plant species — acacia, Acacia mangium Wild.; pigeon pea, Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.; gliricidia, Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp.; and leucaena, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Sampling was conducted at the ends of the dry and rainy seasons, in São Sebastião do Paraíso, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Undisturbed soil samples were acquired using a cylinder and a Berlese-Tullgren funnel was used to extract the mites in the laboratory. A total of 1,014 mite specimens, assigned into 143 different species, were collected. The forest soil had the greatest richness and total abundance of edaphic mites, while the coffee plantation soils, enriched with acacia, had the lowest richness and abundance. The mite communities of treated soils were less than 18% similar to that of the forest soil. These results suggest that the substitution of native forests with cultivated systems can cause significant changes in the abundance, richness and structuring of edaphic mite communities, particularly of oribatid mites. Maintenance of mite communities should be one of the goals of agricultural practices, since these organisms are important for maintenance of biological cycles, especially for the decomposition of organic matter. © Acarina 2018.

AB  - Feeding roughage to cattle can produce a high methane emission from fermentation process in the rumen which pollute the environment. The objective of this study was to investigate the ruminal fermentability modification through the utilization of feed supplement to reduce methane emission from cattle. In vitro study was conducted using ruminal fluid to assess the fermentation characteristics of the three experimental rations. The basal ration consisted of field grass, urea and molasses. Urea and molasses were given in the ratio 1:5 to fulfil the requirement of ruminal microbes. The other two experimental rations were obtained by adding soybean meal as protein feed supplement and ketepeng leaves-Cassia alata (defined as SBM-K) or leucaena leaves (Leucaena leucocephala) as protein feed supplement and ketepeng leaves (defined as LL-K) to basal ration at the amount of 20 g/kg body weight0.75. Ketepeng leaves contain quinone which can bind the hydrogen, thus, it may reduce the hydrogen used for methane formation. The cattle ruminal fluid was used as inoculum source. Gas production was measured according to gas test procedure with three replicates. The parameters of microbial fermentation included NH3 concentration and total gas production were not affected by the rations. The synthesis of microbial protein of the basal ration was higher than SBM-K and LL-K (P<0.05). Total volatile fatty acids production was not affected by the rations (Table 3). However, the SBM-K and LL-K produced lower propionate and ratio of acetate:propionate than the basal ration (P<0.05). The LL-K generated numerically lower methane than basal ration. The utilization of feed supplement could maintain fermentation under normal condition and modification of ruminal fermentation has the potential to reduce the methane emission from cattle. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - Multipurpose trees and shrubs (MPTS) establishment plays important role in accelerating natural restoration and productivity of degraded soils for ecosystem stability, biological diversity, and most importantly for agricultural uses. Multipurpose tree plantation with a mixed stands of Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia zygia, Faidherbia albida, Acacia auriculiformis, Senna siamea, Azadiractha indica, and Gliricidia sepium was established to reclaim degraded mined-out Ferric acrisol in a semi-deciduous forest zone of Ghana, West Africa. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of the age of MPTS on some physical and chemical properties of degraded mined-out soil of the Oweri Mines Company, Ltd., Konongo (6°37′56.8″N, 1°13′39.02″W). The study determined soil total nitrogen (tN), soil organic carbon (SOC), acidity (pH), aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), and mercuric (Hg) contents and the relationship between these soil parameters. Soils were sampled at two depths: 0–30 and 30–60 cm from four different age groups of MPTS plantation: non-reclaimed (NR), 5-year-old MPTS plantation, 10-year-old MPTS plantation, and adjacent undisturbed natural forest (NF). The pH, SOC, tN, Al, As, and Hg contents and bulk density were significantly influenced by age of MPTS plantation. The 10-year-old MPTS soil had 53%, and the NF soil had 57%, higher SOC than NR soil. Soil tN in the top 0–30 cm depth for the 5-year-old was 33%, 10-year-old MPTS was 59%, and the NF was 69%, higher than tN in the NR soil. Whereas soil pH had positive significant relationship with soil Hg and As, the reverse was observed with soil Al content. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - To improve the process economy of reactivity improvement, crude cellulase from Bacillus subtilis was employed for the treatment and significant dissolving pulp properties were analyzed. With increase in enzyme dose from 0.25 to 2 U/g o.d. pulp, improvement in Fock reactivity and alkali solubilities (S10 and S18) were observed with simultaneous reduction in viscosity and yield. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to observe the molecular level effects on dissolving grade pulp. The most suitable cellulase dose for reactivity improvement with lowering of viscosity was 0.25 U/g o.d. pulp. With increases in enzyme dose, alkali solubilities (S10 and S18) of dissolving pulp showed continuous increment, while alpha-cellulose of pulp showed reduction due to chain scission of long cellulose fiber fraction. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) seed is one of the leguminosae which have high level of protein but it contains toxic compound such as mimosine and some anti nutritional compounds such as phitic acid and tannin. The objectives of the research was to investigate the sensory characteristic and the changes onanti nutritional compounds and mimosine level in Leucaena leucochepala seed during fermentation. Lamtoro tempeh processing was carried out by boiling the seed, crushing to separate the hull, soaking, boiling, and fermentation. The best concentration inoculum in lamtoro tempeh processing was determined by hedonic test. Fermentation was carried out in 36 hours and every 6 hours mimosine, tannin, and phitic acid content was analyzed. From hedonic test, inoculum concentration of 1% was used in lamtoro tempeh processing. During 36 hours fermentation, phytic acid content and mimosine content was decreased significantly, from 0.0558 % to 0.0453 % and from 0.00393 % to 0.00173 % respectively. Whereas tannin content was increased signifacantly, from 0.0822 % to 0.00173 %. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Grass pasture rundown results from a depleted store of soil mineral nitrogen (N) over time. In these systems, mineral N is retained in the standing plant biomass, and /or immobilized in the soil organic matter. Leucaena leucocephala spp. glabrata is a leguminous shrub which is incorporated into grazing systems to provide a high protein fodder for beef cattle production. Leucaena can also enhance the soil N status through biological N2 fixation and easily mineralisation of labile leucaena residues. However, there is limited information on the soil N dynamics of leucaena-grass system especially in the subsoil layers of the soil profile, including the primary N source for leucaena, and the effect of leucaena residue on accompanying green panic (Panicum maximum var. trichoglume). We quantified the effect of pasture-type, soil-type and leucaena stand age on soil N stocks and δ15N values at different depths. A chronosequence of leucaena stands (0–40 years) and paired grass sites were sampled to 1.0 m depth. Using the δ15N natural abundance technique, it was estimated that 73% of leucaena N originated from atmospheric N2-fixation. Total soil N stocks were 45% higher beneath leucaena rows compared to the paired grass sites at 0–0.1 m depth. In addition, total soil N stocks increased by 32% in the surface at 0–0.3 m depth, attaining a maximum in the 40-year old stand. The N dynamics beneath the leucaena rows and mid-rows suggest a tight cycling of available N within the system. This study further highlights the importance of incorporating legumes into grazing systems to increase plant available N and mitigate pasture rundown. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Attempts were made to ameliorate sodic black calcareous soils by using different crop residues (composted cotton stalk and biomulch 5 t ha−1, respectively) and green manures (in-situ Crotalaria juncea, Sesbania aculeata, Vigna unguiculata, Vigna radiata, and ex-situ Leucaena leucocephala loppings 5 t ha−1) and gypsum 2.5 t ha−1. The organic amendments were outperformed with respect to improvement in soil microbial biomass carbon and dehydrogenase activity, not gypsum. The application of dhaincha significantly improved the mean weight diameter by 14% over control. The application of gypsum and dhaincha recorded a significant drop in pHs (0.1 and 0.07 units) and exchangeable sodium percentage (26.7% and 20.6%) over control. After 2 years of experiments, dhaincha (14.8%) and sunhemp (15.5%) also showed the commensurable potential of improving yields of chickpea as compared to gypsum (14.8%) over control. Hence, dhaincha and sunhemp can be a better alternative choice to gypsum in sodic soils. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This research investigated the effectiveness of leucaena leucocephala as a natural coagulant for chromium removal. Leucaena leucocephala is a permanent non-climbing shrub tree which is wild and abundant in Malaysia and commonly known as petai belalang. Coagulation experiment using jar test were performed where the effect of coagulant dosage and pH were examined. The parameters investigated were suspended solid (SS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), turbidity and chromium content. The optimum of leucaena leucocephala coagulant dosage for removal of suspended solid, turbidity, COD, BOD and Chromium is at range 400-600 mg/L which yielded 45, 31.4, 38.5, 27.5 and 4.05% removal respectively. While the optimum pH is at pH 2-4 (acidic) which give 33.3, 26.8, 33.75, 31.4 and 14.06% removal of suspended solid, COD, BOD, turbidity and chromium content respectively. It is concluded that the leucaena leucocephala showed tremendous potential for chromium removal. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Transvaccenic acid (TVA), c9t11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) in bovine milk are associated with human health benefits. The effect of nutritional supplementation without (NSO) or with sunflower seed oil (63.3% linoleic acid and 28.3% oleic acid) at 20 g/kg (SO20) of dry matter (DM) and 40 g/kg of DM (SO40) was evaluated in milk cows foraging on Leucaena leucocephala in intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS). Two experiments were performed, the first on a specialized tropical dairy farm (STDF) and the second on a dual-purpose tropical farm (DPTF), where cattle are fed an average of 5.8 kg/d and 2.0 kg/d of concentrate, respectively, in addition to grazing on pasture. Sunflower seed oil supplementation tended to decrease forage intake but did not affect milk yield or the milk protein and lactose percentages in either experiment. The proportion of fat, total solids, and milk urea nitrogen (MUN) decreased with oil supplementation on the STDF. However, on the DPTF, these three variables did not change significantly when SO20 or SO40 were compared to NSO, but the values were higher for SO20 compared to SO40. The proportion of CLAc9t11 and TVA linearly increased with the two levels of supplementation in both experiments. Furthermore, the atherogenic FAs decreased, and the milk had greater amounts of unsaturated FAs (UFAs) and a lower atherogenic index. Supplementing cows under an ISS with sunflower seed oil increases the proportion of beneficial milk FAs. On the STDF oil supplementation produced milk with a lower fat content and a greater proportion of high-quality fatty acids, presenting an interesting possibility for fat restricted diets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Antibacteria, a subtance inhibiting the growth of bacteria, can be obtained from tropical-almond (Terminalia catappa), morinda (Morinda citrifolia), and white leadtree (Leucaena leucocephala) plants, since the plants have phytochemical content functioning as antibacterial agent. Commonly, part of plant that contains higher antibacterial substances is its leaf. The objectives of this study were to determine antibacterial activity of tropical-almond, morinda, and white leadtree leaves extracts, and to analyse the potency of the three extracts as natural bactericide for soaking of skin or hide. The responses measured in this study were phytochemical contents, total flavonoid, tannin content, the inhibition zone, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Phytochemical contents containing the three leaves extracts were alkaloid, flavonoid, tannin, saponin, phenolic, and glycoside. Total flavonoid and tannin contents of the three extracts were tropical-almond extract of 1.14 % and 1.51 %, respectively; morinda extract of 0.61 % and 0.36 %, respectively; and white leadtree extract of 0.60 % and 4.82 %, respectively. White leadtree leaf extract gave the highest inhibition zone against B. subtilis, S. aureus and E. coli, i.e. 1.50, 1.3, and 1.65 cm, respectively; and the lowest MIC and MBC against B. subtilis, S. aureus and E. coli, i.e. 1500, 3000, and 1500 μg/ml, respectively. Therefore, the white leadtree leave extract had more potential as bactericide for soaking of skin or hide compared to those of the tropical-almond and morinda leaves extracts. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is an introduced species, which has been widely used in mountain ecological restoration in southwestern China. To investigate the allelopathic effects of decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter, the photosynthetic physiology of seedlings of two recipient plants, Cynodon dactylon and Medicago sativa, were measured in this controlled study. As the amount of decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter increased, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), and stomatal conductance (Gs) decreased continuously, and the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) increased continuously in both recipient plants. In M. sativa, all abovementioned indices differed significantly compared with the control group: Pn, Gs, and Tr decreased by 41.69, 59.35, and 48.02%, respectively, and Ci increased by 28.53%. In C. dactylon, Gs decreased significantly by 27.27%. Analysis of the photosynthesis–light response curve indicated that the maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pnmax) and dark respiration rate (Rd) of C. dactylon, as well as Pnmax and light saturation point (Lsp) of M. sativa, decreased significantly as the amount of decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter increased. These results indicated that the photosynthetic traits, light adaptation ability and physiological metabolism of recipient plants were affected by the treatment. The decreased photosynthesis was caused by the changes in pigments and soluble sugar contents induced by L. leucocephala leaf litter and is therefore considered to be associated with non-stomatal limitations. In addition, as the amount of decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter increased, M. sativa showed decreased chlorophyll (Chla) and carotenoid (Car) contents, while C. dactylon showed decreased Chla and Chl(a + b) contents. However, both recipient plants exhibited significantly increases in their soluble sugar content. Overall, M. sativa was more sensitive than C. dactylon to the allelopathic effects induced by decomposing L. leucocephala leaf litter. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Seeds from Leucaena leucocephala or commonly known as white leadtree are rich in galactomannan, a reserved polysaccharide composed of d-mannose and d-galactose residues. Galactomannan was isolated from the mature seeds of L. leucocephala using water extraction followed by precipitation with ethanol and purified using ion-exchange chromatography. Pure galactomannan was successfully isolated with a yield of 50.31% (w/w). It was chemically analyzed by UV, NMR, FT-IR, GPC, and HPLC. The polysaccharide was further hydrolyzed and derivatized with 3-methyl-1-phenyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) for determination of its monosaccharide composition using a pre-column derivatization HPLC–UV technique. It consisted of d-mannose and d-galactose with mannose:galactose (M/G) ratio of 1.01. The molecular weight of the galactomannan was found to be 64 kDa. Galactomannan obtained from this present work is soluble in water. FT-IR analysis, 1H, and 13C NMR of the galactomannan produced are similar to those reported in the literatures. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the mimosine level and examine the male reproductive toxicity effects of Leucaena leucocephala (LL) shoot tips plus young leaf extract. Mimosine level in LL extract was determined by thin layer chromatography before administration in animals. Male rats were divided into control and LL (1,500 mg/KgBW) groups (n = 6). After 60 days of experiment, serum sex hormones, sperm quality, and testicular histopathology were assayed and observed. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level and expressions of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) and phosphorylated proteins in testicular lysate were examined by western blotting. Results showed that mimosine levels in LL extract was 17.35 ± 1.12 % of dry weight. LL significantly decreased FSH & LH levels, sperm qualities, and seminiferous tubule diameter compared to the control (p<0.05). Seminiferous tubular atrophies, germ cell sloughing, and degenerations were observed in LL group. In addition, testicular MDA level and StAR protein expression were significantly decreased in LL group. LL extract could increase the expression of a 50 kDa phohorylated protein in testicular lysate. In conclusion, LL extract has mimosine and reproductive toxicity effects on males. © 2018, Universidad de la Frontera. All rights reserved.

AB  - Allelopathic effects of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. were confirmed in Petri dish and pot experiments in our previous studies. However, the degree to which such effects under controlled experiments exist in more complex ecological settings remains to be tested. Thus, the present study was carried out by incorporating different proportions of ground litter of E. camaldulensis in soil. The growth of three agricultural crops: falen (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), and arhor (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.), and two tree species, kala koroi (Albizia procera (Roxb.) Benth.) and ipil ipil (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) were tested. There were inhibitory effects of leaf litter on germination, shoot and root growth, leaf number, and collar diameter as well as a reduction of nodulation by legume crops (25–80% reduction). The extent of the effects was dependent on the proportion of leaf litter, the species and the type of traits. In contrast to shoot growth, the effect on root growth was more severe. No effect on germination was found with the agriculture crops while the two tree species showed reduced germination. The effect was greater in the presence of higher proportions of leaf litter mixed in soil while in some cases lower proportions stimulated growth. Not all species were suppressed; A. procera, C. cajan, V. unguiculata showed compatible growth while C. arietinum and L. leucocephala were found incompatible. This study provides evidence that E. camaldulensis has allelopathic potential under field conditions and a careful selection of associated crops in agroforestry systems is highly recommended. © 2017, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate methods to effect seed dormancy breaking of Flemingia macrophylla (flemíngia) and Leucaena leucocephala (leucena). The seeds were submitted to the following treatments: a) Manual scarification with sandpaper; b) Immersion in 98% H2SO4for five minutes; c) Immersion in H2O at 80° C for 3 minutes; d) Preheating at 60 °C for 150 minutes; e) Potassium nitrate (KNO3 0.2%); f) Gibberellic acid (AG3 0.5%); g) Control (without breaking dormancy). For the seeds of flemingia, treatment with H2SO4 obtained a higher percentage of germination, followed by immersion in H2O at 80°C and manual scarification with sandpaper. Leucena seeds submitted to immersion in water at 80°C and H2SO4 showed a higher percentage of germination in relation to the other treatments. Thus, the use of hot water for leucena seeds and immersion in H2SO4for flemíngia seeds were the most adequate methods to overcome the dormancy of their seeds. © 2018, UCOPress.

AB  - Reconstructions of vascular plant mitochondrial genomes (mt-genomes) are notoriously complicated by rampant recombination that has resulted in comparatively few plant mt-genomes being available. The dearth of plant mitochondrial resources has limited our understanding of mt-genome structural diversity, complex patterns of RNA editing, and the origins of novel mt-genome elements. Here, we use an efficient long read (PacBio) iterative assembly pipeline to generatemt-genome assemblies for Leucaena trichandra (Leguminosae: Caesalpinioideae: mimosoid clade), providing the first assessment of non-papilionoid legume mt-genome content and structure to date. The efficiency of the assembly approach facilitated the exploration of alternative structures that are common place among plantmitochondrial genomes. A compact version (729 kbp) of the recovered assemblies was used to investigate sources of mt-genome size variation among legumes and mt-genome sequence similarity to the legume associated root holoparasite Lophophytum. The genome and an associated suite of transcriptome data from select species of Leucaena permitted an in-depth exploration of RNA editing in a diverse clade of closely related species that includes hybrid lineages. RNA editing in the allotetraploid, Leucaena leucocephala, is consistent with co-option of nearly equal maternal and paternal C-to-U edit components, generating novel combinations of RNA edited sites. A preliminary investigation of L. leucocephala C-to-U edit frequencies identified the potential for a hybrid to generate unique pools of alleles from parental variation through edit frequencies shared with one parental lineage, those intermediate between parents, and transgressive patterns. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Objective: The research to investigate that the source of Leucaena leucocephala can lower blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic mice. Methods: In this study, 42 mice were divided into 7 groups each consisted of 6 mice: Normal Group I, Group II (metformin positive control), Group III (negative control), Group IV (sauce of L. leucocephala at a dose of 0.1 ml), Group V (sauce of L. leucocephala at a dose of 0.2 ml), Group VI (sauce of L. leucocephala with doses of 0.4 ml), and Group VII (sauce of L. leucocephala at a dose of 0.8 ml). The dosage of Group II, IV, V, VI, and VII was orally administered. Blood glucose levels in mice were observed during normal conditions and after administration of 200 mg/kg bw alloxan intraperitoneally (alloxan-induced mice). On day 0, 3, 7, and 14, blood was taken from the tail and glucose levels were measured with a glucometer. Results: Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by LSD test. Based on the results, the sauce at a dose of 0.8 ml was able to lower the blood glucose levels up to normal blood glucose levels. Conclusion: There was not significantly different between the groups given sauce of L. leucocephala at a dose of 0.8 ml with the group given metformin (positive control). © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Galactomannan (GM) is a biomoleculer polymer present as a storage carbohydrate in endosperm of many leguminous plant and fungal cell wall. Commercial GMs were obtained from plants such as guar gum (Cyamoposis tetragonolobus), locust beans (Ceratonia siliqua) and tara gum (Caesalpinia spinosa). In this project GM was extracted from seeds of a local plant 'petai belalang' scientifically known as Leucaena leucocephala. The GM was further conjugated with acryloyl groups for further crosslinking reactions. We report here the structural properties of the modified analogue of GM based on several spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR, NMR and XRD. The morphology of the galactomannan analogue (aGM) was identified from SEM images at several magnifications. We also included discussions on comparisons of the aGM from its parent structure. GM was successfully conjugated with the acryloyl group as verified by the presence of vinyl stretching bands and vinyl protons in the FTIR and H1 NMR spectrum of aGM respectively. This is supported with SEM images that show distribution of granules along the aGM surfaces as compared to a smooth surface of its parent compound. The successfulness of the conjugation process was further verified from data obtained from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). © 2018 Authors.

AB  - The adsorption properties of Leucaena leucocephala biomass to clean malachite green contaminated water were investigated in this work. BET surface analysis showed a surface area of 0.5724 m²/g. Batch adsorption studies and isothermic studies determined that the best time and temperature for the adsorption process to become efficient were 60 min of contact time and 25 °C, respectively. The KF value of 0.3372 mg adsorbed per mg of adsorbent of the L. leucocephala biomass for malachite green was the highest at 50 °C. It was shown that the n values were n <1 which suggested that malachite green dye adsorption on L. leucocephala biomass is favorable. Values of the correlation coefficient (R2) indicated that the Freundlich isotherm can be used for the adsorption of malachite green on L. leucocephala. The results also suggest that L. leucocephala biomass can be utilized as an adsorbent for malachite green dye from wastewater at a lower cost. © 2018, Prince of Songkla University.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a shrub rich in proteins and mimosine. This high-density crop is cultivated to increase protein intake in cattle production systems. Mimosine is an antimitotic and its effect on the endometrium is still unknown. It is presumed that it could accumulate in the endometrial tissue, inhibiting the development of the endometrial glands, which are in charge of nurturing the embryo. The objective of this study was to determine mimosine accumulation in the endometrial tissue as a result of the consumption of L. leucocephala and to observe its effect in the development of the endometrial glands of early postpartum cows in a silvopastoral system. Twenty-four Bos indicus-Bos taurus cows were divided in two treatments: grazing in a silvopastoral system (SSP, n=12), formed by the association of Cynodon nlemfuensis and L. leucocephala, var. Cunningham; and grazing in a monoculture system (SM, n=12) of C. nlemfuensis. Mimosine consumption per kilogram of live weight was estimated based on the daily consumption of mimosine per cow. Mimosine concentration in the uterine tissue was determined using HPLC. A Student's t test (p ≤ 0.05) was applied to contrast the differences between the mimosine concentration in the endometrial tissue of functional and non-functional glands. Mimosine accumulated in the endometrial tissue of SSP cows. Its concentration ranged from 51.02 to 63.45 μg g-1 of endometrial tissue (TE). The endometrial glands had a normal development, with -53.73 μg g-1 mimosine concentration in TE. By contrast, with 60.81 μg g-1, or higher, TE concentrations, endometrial glands showed signs of atrophy. Daily mimosine consumption in the SSP was 0.019 g kg-1 live weight. Mimosine from L. leucocephala consumption accumulates in the endometrial tissue and can cause endometrial glands atrophy in early postpartum cows. © 2018, Colegio de Postgraduados.; Leucaena leucocephala es un arbusto rico en proteína y mimosina que se cultiva en altas densidades para incrementar la ingesta de proteína en sistemas de producción bovina. La mimosina es un antimitótico cuyo efecto sobre el endometrio no es bien conocido. Se presume que podría acumularse en el tejido endometrial, inhibiendo el desarrollo de las glándulas endometriales responsables de nutrir al embrión. El objetivo de este estudio fue determinar la acumulación de mimosina en el tejido endometrial, por consumo de L. leucocephala, y observar su efecto en el desarrollo de las glándulas endometriales de vacas en postparto temprano en un sistema silvopastoril. Veinticuatro vacas Bos indicus-Bos taurus se dividieron en dos tratamientos: pastoreo en sistema silvopastoril (SSP, n=12), conformado por asociación de Cynodon nlemfuensis y L. leucocephala var. Cunningham; y pastoreo en sistema de monocultivo (SM, n=12), de C. nlemfuensis. El consumo de mimosina por kilogramo de peso vivo se estimó a partir del consumo diario de mimosina por vaca. La concentración de mimosina en tejido uterino se determinó con HPLC. La prueba de t de Student (p≤0.05) se utilizó para contrastar diferencias entre la concentración de mimosina en el tejido endometrial con glándulas funcionales y no funcionales. La mimosina se acumuló en el tejido endometrial de vacas en el SSP y su concentración varió de 51.02 a 63.45 μg g-1 de tejido endometrial (TE). El desarrollo de las glándulas endometriales fue normal con concentraciones de mimosina iguales o menores a 53.73 μg g-1 de TE. Por el contrario, con concentraciones de 60.81 μg g-1 de TE o más se observó atrofia de las glándulas endometriales. El consumo diario de mimosina en el SSP fue 0.019 g kg-1 de peso vivo. La mimosina proveniente del consumo de L. leucocephala se acumula en el tejido endometrial y puede causar atrofia de las glándulas endometriales en vacas en postparto temprano. © 2018, Colegio de Postgraduados.

AB  - Six carbonizing wood vinegars consisting of Dendrocalamus asper (Bamboo), Hevea brasiliensis (Rubberwood), Jatropha curcas (Jatropa), Leucaena leucocephala (White popinac), Eucalyptus camaldulensis (Eucalyptus), and Azadirachta indica (Neem) were assessed for their antioxidant activity by measuring their capability for scavenging1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, hydroxyl free radical, superoxide anion radical, as well as ferric reducing power, and anti-lipid peroxidation capacity. Total phenol content was also evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteu assay expressed as gallic acid equivalent. All wood vinegars exhibited better DPPH radical scavenging capacity than positive controls, ascorbic acid and BHT. The wood vinegars from bamboo and rubberwood exhibited good antioxidant capacity in all assays tested comparable or better than a positive control, BHT. In addition the DPPH radical scavenging capacity, hydroxyl free radical scavenging capacity, ferric reducing power and anti-lipid peroxidation capacity showed good correlations with their total phenolic contents with correlation, R2 values ranging from 0.92-0.99. The results of the present study suggested that wood vinegars have high potential to be useful as beneficial natural antioxidant compound in feed additives and veterinary medicine. In addition the total phenol content in wood and bamboo vinegars have a potential quality index to evaluate the scavenging ability of DPPH radical, hydroxyl free radical capacity, ferric reducing power and anti-lipid peroxidation. © 2018, Chiang Mai University.

AB  - The aim of this study was to optimize the energetic use and extraction of hemicelluloses by hydrolysis with dilute acid of three different lignocellulosics materials from rapid growth biomass using a factorial experimental design and multiple regression models. For that, calorific power value and chemical composition of solid phases after acid hydrolysis of three different lignocellulosic materials were determined (Chamaecytisus proliferus or tagasaste-, Leucaena leucocephala, and a dihybrid of Paulownia (fortunei and elongata). These solid phases were assessed for obtainment of energy, sugars and other by product. Superior calorific value at constant volume over dry basis and lower calorific value at constant pressure was determinated for energy purposes. The proposed acid hydrolysis process allows increased yield and xylan under more selective extraction conditions. Also higher values of superior calorifc power values that raw materials are reported. The operational ranges are especially suitable for the extraction of xylose, which was virtually quantitative at 170 ºC The selective extraction of hemicelulloses alows to have a solid part with a high content in glucan a lignin and the value of superior calorimetric is suitable for obtain energy. © 2018, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - In higher plants, multiple copies of the cysteine synthase gene are present for cysteine biosynthesis. Some of these genes also have the potential to produce various kinds of β-substitute alanine. In the present study, we cloned a 1275-bp cDNA for cytosolic O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (cysteine synthase) (Cy-OASTL) from Leucaena leucocephala. The purified protein product showed a dual function of cysteine and mimosine synthesis. Kinetics studies showed pH optima of 7.5 and 8.0, while temperature optima of 40 and 35 °C, respectively, for cysteine and mimosine synthesis. The kinetic parameters such as apparent Km, kcat were determined for both cysteine and mimosine synthesis with substrates O-acetylserine (OAS) and Na2S or 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (3H4P). From the in vitro results with the common substrate OAS, the apparent kcat for Cys production is over sixfold higher than mimosine synthesis and the apparent Km is 3.7 times lower, suggesting Cys synthesis is the favored pathway. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The higher heating value (HHV) plays a significant role in determining of the energy potential of biomass. The method to receive this value using a bomb calorimeter takes a long time approximately of 15 minutes. The implementation of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) technique by generating a prediction model can be replaced the former method in order to reduce time into 2 minutes. Therefore, the precision of both techniques have to be concerned in order to get the reliable values. The repeatability and reproducibility processes were carried out to evaluate the precision of both methods. It was found that the percentage difference of standard deviation (SD) from the mean of repeatability for the NIR was less than 5 % and for reproducibility was slightly over 5 % (but not over than 10%). The SD of repeatability and reproducibility of the bomb calorimeter were 54.6 J/g (0.3 % difference of average HHV value) and 81.3 J/g (0.5 % difference of average HHV value) respectively. The average HHV from the bomb calorimeter was 18,166.77±236.29 J/g. Both techniques showed very low percentage difference of the SD from the mean that revealed very high reliability and precision of measurements. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.

AB  - Effect of feeding complete pellet feed containing tree leaves on methane emission was studied in male Barbari goats. Three types of complete pellet feed was formulated, viz. control pellet (C) having gram straw (60%) and concentrate mixture (40%), treatment 1 (T1) and treatment 2 (T2) containing dried Leucaena leucocephala and Ficus infectoria leaves respectively. All types of pellets were isonitrogenous. Growing male Barbari goats (12; 3–4 month-old; average body weight 11.01±0.49 kg) were divided into 3 groups (Gr 1, Gr 2 and Gr 3) as per completely randomized design. Gr 1 was fed with control pellet while Gr 2 and Gr 3 was fed with T1 and T2 pellet respectively. After 6 weeks of experimental feeding, a digestion trial of 6-day duration was conducted. There was no difference in the DMI (g)/day between the 3 groups. Dry matter digestibility and digestibility of other nutrients were comparable among all groups of goats. Rumen liquor was collected from each animal to study rumen fermentation metabolites. Rumen pH, ammonia-N and nitrogenous fractions (total nitrogen, TCA-ppt N, NPN) were statistically similar in all the groups. Total volatile fatty acids (mmol/dl) was significantly higher in Gr 3 (10.57) and Gr 2 (9.52) as compared to control group (8.67). Fractions (%) of volatile fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid) were similar in different groups. In vivo methane emission in different groups of goats was estimated by SF6 technique as per procedure standardized in our lab. Methane production (g/day) was 8.29 in Gr 1, 7.47 in Gr 2 and 6.72 in Gr 3. There was 9.89 and 18.93% lower methane production in Gr 2 and Gr 3 as compared to control group of goats fed with complete pellet feed. From the present study, it can be concluded that incorporation of dried L. leucocephala and Ficus infectoria leaves in the complete pellet feed can reduce the methane production in goats. © 2018 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

AB  - Cyclobalanopsis glauca is a constructive or dominant species of forest vegetation in karst region of south China, which has strong adaptability to rocky desertification mountain area. An experiment was conducted to explore the effects of three pioneer tree species, i.e., Delavaya toxocarpa, Leucaena leucocephala, and Zenia insignis, on seedling growth and twig and leaf traits of 1-3 years old C. glauca seedlings in rocky desertification area of southwest Guangxi, China. The results showed that the facilitative effect of three pioneer species on the survival and growth of C. glauca seedlings were distinct, which was enhanced with the increases of seedling age. The facilitative effect on seedling height growth was greater than on basal diameter growth. The facilitation by D. toxocarpa was greater than by Z. insignis. Some parameters of C. glauca seedlings such as ratio of plant height to basal diameter, average internode length of stems, SPAD value of leaves, average area of single leaves and N content of leaves were larger under three pioneer tree species canopy than that outside canopy, whereas the C/N ratio of leaves was smaller. All these parameters of C. glauca seedlings were significantly different (P<0.05) between beneath D. toxocarpa or L. leucocephala and outside canopy. The specific leaf area of C. glauca seedlings was significantly greater beneath D. toxocarpa than outside canopy. According to the results of this study and previous studies, D. toxocarpa, L. leucocephala and Z. insignis can be chosen as the nurse plants to improve the establishment of C. glauca seedlings and thus the efficiency of vegetation restoration in rocky desertification region of southwest Guangxi, China. © 2018, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

TI  - Free light fraction carbon and nitrogen, a physically uncomplexed soil organic matter distribution within subtropical grass and leucaena-grass pastures
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056119737&doi=10.1071%2fSR18162&partnerID=40&md5=dc3dfaf4442e7ba44372fe95c5609cec
AB  - Quantifying the size and turnover of physically uncomplexed soil organic matter (SOM) is crucial for the understanding of nutrient cycling and storage of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the C and nitrogen (N) dynamics of SOM fractions in leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala)-grass pastures remains unclear. We assessed the potential of leucaena to sequester labile, free light fraction (fLF) C and N in soil by estimating the origin, quantity and vertical distribution of physically unprotected SOM. The soil from a chronosequence of seasonally grazed leucaena stands (0-40 years) was sampled to a depth of 0.2 m and soil and fLF were analysed for organic C, N and δ13C and δ15N. On average, the fLF formed 20% of SOC and 14% of total N stocks in the upper 0.1 m of soil from leucaena rows and showed a peak of fLF-C and fLF-N stocks in the 22-year-stand. The fLF δ13C and fLF δ15N values indicated that leucaena produced 37% of fLF-C and 28% of fLF-N in the upper 0.1 m of soil from leucaena rows. Irrespective of pasture type or soil depth, the majority of fLF-C originated from the accompanying C4 pasture-grass species. This study suggests that fLF-C and fLF-N, the labile SOM, can form a significant portion of total SOM, especially in leucaena-grass pastures. © 2018 CSIRO.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is divided into two subspecies: (i) L. leucocephala subsp. leucocephala, which is known as "common leucaena" or "koa haole, " and (ii) L. leucocephala subsp. glabrata, which is known as "giant leucaena. " Common leucaena is a small bushy shrub that forms a lot of seeds, because of which it can spread easily and is considered invasive. Giant leucaena, on the other hand, is a tree with large branches. It produces much less seeds and is not considered invasive. Giant leucaena can grow to become big trees of up to ~20 m in height, or it can be grown as a legume fodder by maintaining the plants as dwarf bushes through repeated harvest of foliage, up to ten times a year. The wood of giant leucaena can be used for timber, paper pulp, or biofuel production. In the Hawaiian Islands, many eroded habitats, such as roadsides, hill slopes, and barren lands, are generally occupied by common leucaena. Replacing common leucaena with giant leucaena in these locations may create new opportunities for cattle farming, animal feed production, and development of other related industry. Dr. James Brewbaker and his colleagues at the University of Hawaii developed many high-yielding cultivars of giant leucaena suitable for both fodder and wood production. Besides growing in Hawaii, these cultivars are also widely grown in many other tropical and subtropical countries. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

AB  - Vegetation changes in abandoned farmland that deviates from locally targeted states pose conservation and restoration problems in various parts of the world. Here, we review the patterns of vegetation change after upland field abandonment in Japan. Inconsistent invasiveness and weediness of exotic species such as Phyllostachys edulis and Leucaena leucocephala in rural habitats indicated that even if an exotic species is present in a focal area, its impacts on revegetation pathways vary depending on the local species pool, species recruitment order, and interspecific competition. Improved soil nutrients for crop production before abandonment decreased the presence of native grasses and forbs during early successional stages. Buried seeds and resprouting plants maintained under slash-and-burn cultivation led to the dominance of native tree species. After the recent abandonment of conventional farming in warm-temperate regions of Japan, competitive clonal native species such as a dwarf bamboo (Pleioblastus chino) and kudzu (Pueraria lobata) became dominant and limited the seedling establishment of various native tree species. The drastic decrease of grassland areas in the past century suggests that many fewer seeds of Miscanthus sinensis, which serves as a facilitator of various plants in grassland systems, are dispersing into abandoned fields than in the past. Studies of wildlife in abandoned farmland in Japan indicated that herbivore damage by rodents, Japanese hare, and sika deer are potent factors affecting forest recovery. These results suggest that vegetation change after upland field abandonment occurs in diverse ways, reflecting historical differences in environmental factors such as local flora and fauna, agricultural technologies and practices, and landscape mosaics. This implies that revegetation pathways after upland field abandonment tend toward novel states and that deterministic predictions of upland field succession will be easily violated in many cases. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2017.

AB  - The nutritive and tannin content of tree forages (Kleinhovia hospita, Leucaena leucocephala, and Gliricidia sepium and their effects on in vitro rumen fermentation, digestibility and gas production were examined. Rumen fluid was obtained from three fistulated Boer goats with an average weight range of 31-32 kg fed forages. The fluid was incubated with 0.2 g of each forage at 39 °C for 48 h to determine the in vitro gas production, DM digestibility, metabolizable energy and volatile fatty acid. The proximate composition and the polyphenol composition of the forage were also evaluated. The experimental design was a completely randomized design and the treatments were K. hospita, L. leucocephala and G. sepium. The chemical composition, percentage of total polyphenol, non-tannin polyphenol, condensed tannin and hydrolysable tannin differed (P < 0.05) among the forages. The K. hospita had higher (P < 0.05) net gas production and in vitro dry matter digestibility compared with other forages. Similarly, K. hospita had higher (P < 0.05) concentration of total volatile fatty acid and propionic acid followed by L. leucocephala and G. sepium. The molar proportion of acetic and butyric acid did not differ among the forages. The outcome of this study present K. hospita as a good potential forage to be used in ruminant diet as a result of better nutrient composition, moderate anti-nutritive value and best ivDMD in comparison with L. leucocephala and G. sepium. © 2018 Tropical Animal Science Journal.

AB  - Stabilisation and protection of soil organic carbon (SOC) in macroaggregates and microaggregates represents an important mechanism for the sequestration of SOC. Legume-based grass pastures have the potential to contribute to aggregate formation and stabilisation, thereby leading to SOC sequestration. However, there is limited research on the C and N dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) fractions in deep-rooted legume leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala)-grass pastures. We assessed the potential of leucaena to sequester carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil aggregates by estimating the origin, quantity and distribution in the soil profile. We utilised a chronosequence (0-40 years) of seasonally grazed leucaena stands (3-6 m rows), which were sampled to a depth of 0.3 m at 0.1-m intervals. The soil was wet-sieved for different aggregate sizes (large macroaggregates, >2000 μm; small macroaggregates, 250-2000 μm; microaggregates, 53-250 μm; and <53 μm), including occluded particulate organic matter (oPOM) within macroaggregates (>250 μm), and then analysed for organic C, N and δ13C and δ15N. Leucaena promoted aggregation, which increased with the age of the leucaena stands, and in particular the formation of large macroaggregates compared with grass in the upper 0.2 m. Macroaggregates contained a greater SOC stock than microaggregates, principally as a function of the soil mass distribution. The oPOM-C and-N concentrations were highest in macroaggregates at all depths. The acid nonhydrolysable C and N distribution (recalcitrant SOM) provided no clear distinction in stabilisation of SOM between pastures. Leucaena-and possibly other legume-based grass pastures have potential to sequester SOC through stabilisation and protection of oPOM within macroaggregates in soil. © 2018 CSIRO.

This study was conducted in November 2015 and located in Humusu Sainiup, Timor Tengah Utara Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province. The method used in collecting data was applied in three different land-use, namely monoculture Gliricidia sepium, polyculture between Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala, and polyculture between Gliricidia sepium and Zea mays. We used the allometric equation from Ketterings namely B = 0.11ρD2+0,62 and C = 0.5 x B. The results showed that the different land-use will give different value of carbon stocks which is in this study the biggest value of carbon stocks was found in monoculture of Gliricidia sp (35.35 tC ha-1) compared with Gliricidia sp + Leucaena sp (18.83 tC ha-1), and Gliricidia sp + Zea mays (13.79 tC ha-1). The value of biomass and carbon stocks was influenced by wood density, trees density, and diameter at breast height (dbh). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Leucaena is a perennial fodder crop that can significantly improve beef production across substantial parts of the world's grazing lands. We surveyed leucaena cultivations across 350000km2 of Australia's prime leucaena-growing region, using a new approach to quantify leucaena coverage and distribution. This approach uses high resolution imagery to detect leucaena by the distinctive alley cultivation pattern that is typical in the region and in many other parts of the world. We estimated there are ∼123500ha of leucaena in the study region. Although no prior estimate of leucaena coverage has been based on exactly the same geographic area, our data strongly suggest that recent published estimates of leucaena coverage for Queensland and Australia are substantial overestimates. In addition to providing robust estimates of total leucaena coverage, we demonstrate how the method can also contribute to other survey objectives such as comparison of actual with potential spatial distribution, and assessment of statistical sampling power. We also discuss the potential application of the new method in international contexts. © Australian Rangeland Society 2018.

AB  - A common realisation of superhydrophobic surfaces is based on a periodically grooved solid substrate, with air bubbles trapped in a Cassie state within the grooves. Following Baier, Steffes & Hardt (Phys. Rev. E, vol. 82 (3), 2010, 037301) we consider the thermocapillary flow of a liquid bounded between two such surfaces, driven by a macroscopic temperature gradient. Assuming zero protrusion angle of the free menisci, the periodic geometry is described by two parameters, namely the ratio of the groove-array period to the channel depth and the gas fraction of the surface. The flow and heat transport depend upon both these parameters, as well as the Marangoni number , which quantifies the relative magnitudes of advection and conduction. This paper is concerned with the longitudinal problem, where the temperature gradient is applied along the grooves. The temperature within the highly conducting solid substrate varies linearly with distance and may be regarded as prescribed. For any non-zero value of , however, advection necessitates the formation of an excess temperature profile in the liquid domain, above and beyond that linearly varying distribution. The associated Marangoni forces, in turn, imply the formation of flow in the cross-sectional plane. The nonlinearly coupled problem governing the excess temperature and cross-sectional flow is independent of the longitudinal flow. Conversely, the latter satisfies an independent problem in the Stokes limit, and accordingly possesses the standard thermocapillary scaling. A simple transformation reveals a linkage between the longitudinal velocity in the present problem and that in the comparable pressure-driven flow. In studying the coupled problems governing the excess temperature and cross-sectional velocity components, we focus upon deep channels, where . Towards this end, we employ matched asymptotic expansions, with two -deep inner regions adjacent to the surfaces and an outer region in the remaining fluid domain. The small- limit is compatible with two possible scalings of , the first where it is and the second where it is . In the first scaling, the excess temperature in the outer region is driven by a balance between longitudinal advection and conduction perpendicular to the bounding surfaces. In the inner region, the excess temperature is governed by pure conduction; the cross-sectional flow it animates, which possesses the thermocapillary scaling, is linear in . In the second scaling, the cross-sectional velocity becomes large relative to the thermocapillary scaling; a boundary layer, of dimensionless width, is formed within the inner region. In that layer the excess temperature is governed by a dominant balance between conduction perpendicular to the surface and cross-sectional advection. The dependence upon is inherently nonlinear. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Invasive plant species (IPS) have a high potential for expanding within biodiversity hotspots and threatening global plant diversity. Hence, it is urgent to assess the expansion risk of IPS in regions of high plant diversity and their potentially negative effects throughout the world. We used the world's 36 worst IPS as focal study species and applied species distribution modeling to project the suitable habitat distributions of these IPS in centers of plant diversity at the global scale. Subsequently, we assessed the expansion risk of IPS based on habitat suitability across biomes and nature reserves. We found that IPS, particularly Chromolaena odorata, Eichhornia crassipes, Leucaena leucocephala, and Mimosa pigra, have high expansion potential in Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests, Tropical & Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests, and Mangroves within global regions of high plant diversity. Furthermore, IPS such as Imperata cylindrica and L. leucocephala may expand dramatically into Vulnerable and Critical or Endangered biome areas, including nature reserves across Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests and Tropical & Subtropical Coniferous Forests. We suggest that effective conservation management should be enhanced in order to reduce the expansion risk of IPS in the Vulnerable and Critical or Endangered biome areas, that temperature changes should be carefully monitored, and that conservation policies of nature reserves should be reviewed, particularly regarding IPS with high potential to naturally disperse into the nature reserves. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of the physical and chemical recovery of the substrates of waste dumps of different ages undergoing natural regeneration, in a calcary mining in Salto de Pirapora - SP, Brazil. Characterization of the vegetation, vegetation and physical and chemical cover of the substrates of the abandoned waste dumps since 1994 and 2013 and the soil of a native forest fragment adjacent to the mining was carried out. Twelve plots of 10x10m were allocated in each environment. It was verified that the soil cover rate with herbaceous, grassy, regenerating and litter of the sterile stacks are similar to the native forest fragment. The same was observed for the physical characterization of soil resistance to penetration, soil moisture content and relative light index. For the chemical characteristics, in all areas sampled there is aluminum deficiency which, consequently, presented low potential acidity and alkaline pH. The CEC of the substrates of the waste dumps presented values similar to the CEC of the native forest fragment, with abundance in some essential nutrients, indicating the possibility of vegetation development in the sterile stacks and the contribution of the natural regeneration to the substrates. Thus, the plant-soil relationship via natural regeneration in the sterile piles contributed to the improvement of the edaphic quality of the substrates over time, being a potential form of recovery in calcary mining. Thereby, the Fabaceae predominated on the waste dumps, especially Leucaena leucocephala, which, despite being an exotic species, is relevant for the current recovery stage of the substrates. © 2018, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - Non-destructive and high performance analyses are highly desirable and important for assessing the quality of forest seeds. The aim of this study was to relate parameters obtained from semi-automated analysis of radiographs of Leucaena leucocephala seeds to their physiological potential by means of multivariate analysis. To do so, seeds from five lots collected from parent trees from the region of Viçosa, MG, Brazil, were used. The study was carried out through analysis of radiographic images of seeds, from which the percentage of damaged seeds (predation and fungi), and measurements of area, perimeter, circularity, relative density, and integrated density of the seeds were obtained. After the X-ray test, the seeds were tested for germination in order to assess variables related to seed physiological quality. Multivariate statistics were applied to the data generated, with use of principal component analysis (PCA). X-ray testing allowed visualization of details of the internal structure of seeds and differences regarding density of seed tissues. Semi-automated analysis of radiographic images of Leucaena leucocephala seeds provides information on seed physical characteristics and generates parameters related to seed physiological quality in a simple, fast, and inexpensive manner. © 2018, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - Given that phosphate supplies may diminish and become uneconomic to mine after 2020, there is a compelling need to develop alternative industries to support the population on Christmas Island. Former mine sites could be turned into productive agricultural land, however, large-scale commercial agriculture has never been attempted, and, given the uniqueness of the island, the diversity of rhizobia prior to introducing legumes needed evaluation. Therefore, 84 rhizobia isolates were obtained from nine different hosts, both crop and introduced legumes, located at seven sites across the island. Based on 16S rRNA and recA gene sequence analysis, the isolates grouped into 13 clades clustering within the genus Bradyrhizobium, Ensifer, Cupriavidus and Rhizobium. According to the sequences of their symbiosis genes nodC and nifH, the isolates were classified into 12 and 11 clades, respectively, and clustered closest to tropical or crop legume isolates. Moreover, the symbiosis gene phylogeny and Multi Locus Sequence Analysis gene phylogeny suggested vertical transmission in the Alpha-rhizobia but horizontal transmission within the Beta-rhizobia. Furthermore, this study provides evidence of a large diversity of endemic rhizobia associated with both crop and introduced legumes, and highlights the necessity of inoculation for common bean, chickpea and soybean on the Island. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Relationship between near-surface morphological traits of familiar plants and their ability for sediment retention in a dry-hot valley
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064965439&doi=10.19675%2fj.cnki.1006-687x.2018.01024&partnerID=40&md5=64f3cdec2fb04594c9faa213c2366946
AB  - To explore the sediment interception capacity of plants and its relationship with the surface morphological traits of plants, we used laboratory simulations and off-site flume experiments to study the ability for sediment retention of six familiar species: Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Melia azedarach (MA), Dodonaea viscosa (DV), Coriaria sinica (CS), Heteropogon contortus (HC), and Eulaliopsis binata (EB) aver two growth periods in the dry-hot river valley of the Jinsha River. We analyzed the relationship between near-surface morphological traits of individuals of six species and their ability for sediment retention. Our study resulted in three main observations. (1) In the flume experiment, three-month seedlings and one-year old seedlings of the six species showed different abilities for sediment retention. In the three-month seedlings, the ability for sediment retention of CS was the highest, followed by MA and LL, whereas it was the lowest in HC and EB. However, in one-year old seedlings, the ability for sediment retention of CS was the highest, but the ability for sediment retention of HC and EB was better than those of MA and LL. Hence, the ability for sediment retention of the six species fluctuated between different growth periods. (2) The three-month old and one-year old seedlings of all six species showed different near-surface morphological traits. (3) The sediment mass was significantly and positively correlated with near-surface leaf areas, crown lengths, crown widths, stem dry matter densities at the intersection volume, and above-ground biomass, but significantly and negatively correlated with the angle between stem and ground, indicating that these latter are the main near-surface morphological traits able to affect sediment retention. In addition, the sediment mass was also correlated (positively and negatively) with the stem epidermal crack number, stem dry matter content, leaf dry matter content at the intersection volume, and dry mass per unit volume of the intersection volume, which could also reflect the ability of sediment retention. We conclude that in the areas where plant measures are used to control soil erosion and intercept sediment, the key, above-mentioned plant morphological factors should be taken into account in order to select the optimal plant species. © 2018 Science Press.

AB  - Key message: A number of drought-induced genes have been identified from giant leucaena. Abstract: Leucaena leucocephala subspecies glabrata (leucaena), which is also known as ‘giant leucaena’, is a multipurpose tree legume that can be grown and maintained as a woody tree for wood and paper pulp production, or as a shrubby legume through repeated harvest of foliage for use as a fodder. Leucaena is naturally resistant to most biotic and abiotic stresses including drought. The objective of this research was to identify drought-responsive genes in leucaena seedlings through microarray and qRT-PCR analyses. Ten thousand cDNA sequences selected from a leucaena transcriptome were screened for higher expression in a 4 × 180 k microarray using RNA isolated from drought-treated and untreated leucaena seedlings. Microarray analysis identified 73 and 39 drought-responsive genes sequences that were upregulated in the root and shoot, respectively. qRT-PCR analyses confirmed the root- and shoot-specific upregulation of some of the most highly expressed gene sequences identified in the microarray analysis. The proteins encoded by these genes could be grouped into four classes: (1) receptors that sense osmotic and oxidative stresses, (2) transcription factors, (3) degradation pathway enzymes, and (4) biosynthetic enzymes and structural proteins. The functions of these four classes of proteins can be used to explain the drought response in leucaena. The NB-LRR class of disease-resistance proteins may serve as receptors for detecting osmotic and oxidative stresses induced by drought, leading to induction of transcription factors such as zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein and TCP14. As result, the genes for some degradative pathway enzymes, such as GDSL esterase/lipase, lipid acyl hydrolase patatin, and serine carboxypeptidase, were induced. Similarly, the expression of certain biosynthetic enzymes and structural proteins such as flavonoid 3-O-galactosyl transferase, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, 9-cis-epoxy carotenoid dioxygenase, β-amyrin synthase, pentatricopeptide-containing protein, GPI-anchored protein COBRA, and peroxin, were also induced. High expression of some of these drought-inducible genes in leucaena seedlings may be used as a selection criterion in future breeding programs for drought resistance in leucaena and other legumes. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated sites using trees may be preferred over crops due to capacity of trees to accumulate heavy metals in the wood which is biologically non-hazardous. An investigation was undertaken to assess the cadmium (Cd) phytoextraction potential of four multipurpose tree species viz. eucalyptus (Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm.), subabul [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit], dhrek (Melia azedarach L.) and shisham (Dalbergia sissoo Roxb.) at six rates of Cd applied in solution form through CdCl2·H2O (0, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 120 mg Cd kg−1 soil) and harvested after 18 months of growth in an alkaline loamy sand soil in earthen pots. Dry matter (DM) of leaves, stems and roots, Cd content of these constituents and that of soil before planting and after harvesting the tree species were determined. Subabul had the highest and eucalyptus the lowest total DM production at all levels of Cd. Total DM did not decrease significantly up to application of 40 mg Cd kg−1 soil (P > 0.05). The highest Cd level resulted in 49, 41, 26 and 43% reduction in total DM of eucalyptus, subabul, dhrek and shisham, respectively over control. Cadmium concentration was higher in leaves whereas uptake was higher in stems than the other components. Subabul had significantly highest uptake (0.05–71.4 mg pot−1) of Cd at various levels due its higher biomass whereas shisham had the lowest (0.05–28.2 mg pot−1) (P ≤ 0.05). Available Cd in the soil after harvesting of plants was the lowest in subabul and the highest in shisham pots. The upper critical level of available Cd in the soil at 20% reduction in DM was the highest for dhrek (85 mg kg−1) and the lowest for eucalyptus (46 mg kg−1). Therefore, dhrek was more tolerant to Cd but subabul had the greatest potential for phytoextraction of Cd from the soil. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Structure Elucidation and Evaluation of Antioxidant and Tyrosinase Inhibitory Effect and Mechanism of Proanthocyanidins from Leaf and Fruit of Leucaena Leucocephala
PY  - 2018

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the structural features, antioxidant activity, tyrosinase inhibitory effect, and mechanism of proanthocyanidins from leaf and fruit of Leucaena leucocephala. MALDI-TOF-MS, thiolysis coupled with HPLC-ESI-MS, and 13C-NMR confirmed that these proanthocyanidins were complex mixtures of propelargonidins, procyanidins, and prodelphinidins. (Epi)catechin, (epi)gallocatechin, (epi)catechin gallate, and (epi)gallocatechin gallate were the main constitutive units. The findings obtained from enzyme analysis revealed that the proanthocyanidins had inhibitory effects on both monophenolase and diphenolase of tyrosinase. The IC50 values of leaf and fruit proanthocyanidins were 73.5 ± 2.7 and 52.3 ± 3.5 µg/mL for monophenolase activity, and 27.2 ± 1.4 and 16.1 ± 1.1 µg/mL for diphenolase activity, respectively. The inhibition of diphenolase by proanthocyanidins were proved to be reversible and mixed type. In addition, it was also found from various antioxidant methods that the proanthocyanidins in leaf and fruit possessed potent DPPH radical scavenging activity with IC50 values of 103.4 ± 0.8 and 87.8 ± 1.1 µg/mL, ABTS radical scavenging activity with IC50 values of 72.9 ± 0.4 and 65.7 ± 0.9 µg/mL, and ferric reducing antioxidant power with FRAP values of 3.74 ± 0.03 and 4.02 ± 0.15 mmol AAE/g, respectively. The results obtained suggested that the proanthocyanidins from leaf and fruit of L. leucocephala might have the potential to be exploited as natural tyrosinase inhibitors and antioxidants. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Feed resource selection of Criollo goats is the result of an interaction between plant resources, condensed tannins and Haemonchus contortus infection
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054176755&doi=10.1016%2fj.applanim.2018.08.003&partnerID=40&md5=2cc56d7c6f0e3c7f354c5d02a2a94e13
AB  - The tropical deciduous forest (TDF) is an ecosystem with a heterogeneous array of plant species containing different condensed tannin (CT) content. Recent studies explored the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) or Haemonchus contortus infection on the intake and feed resource selection of goats. These factors have not been investigated simultaneously. The present study evaluated the role of infection with the abomasal parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus and the effect of neutralizing CT with PEG on the feed resource selection of Criollo goats in a cafeteria trial. A group of 22 Criollo goats (31.7 ± 4.8 kg) habituated to browse the TDF, were assigned to four groups: two groups were artificially infected with H. contortus (6000 L3 per os) and received PEG (50 mg/day) (INF + PEG group) or no PEG (INF group) and the other two groups were kept free of infection with moxidectin (0.4 mg/kg BW sub-cutaneously) and received either PEG (MOX + PEG) or no PEG (MOX). Intake and resource selection of four shrub plant species (Havardia albicans, Gymnopodium floribundum, Leucaena leucocephala and Piscidia piscipula) by goats, and the dynamics of faecal H. contortus egg excretion were determined daily. Intake varied depending on the interaction between plant resource and the infection level (P < 0.001), and between plant resource and whether goats were dosed with PEG (P < 0.001). Excretion of H. contortus eggs was decreased by 69% and 72% for groups with and without PEG administration, respectively. Infected groups had a higher CT intake. The use of PEG reduced intake of L. leucocephala and increased the selection of H. albicans, a high-CT and high crude protein (CP) resource. Animals infected with H. contortus ingested more high-CT resources. Furthermore, CP intake was lower in PEG dosed goats, possibly to reduce the energetic cost associated with urinary nitrogen excretion. Selection of feed resources varied depending on parasite infection, PEG dosage and plant resource. We concluded that biological interactions influencing intake and selection of feed resources in goats are complex, rather than arising from a single factor such as parasite infection or secondary compounds such as CT. These findings support that goats’ resource selection is a complex process aimed at nutritional optimization. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate chemical composition and methane emission of some tropical forage legumes from Indonesia, namely Acacia mangium, Acacia villosa, Calliandra calothyrsus, Albizzia falcataria, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena diversifolia, and Sesbania grandiflora. These leaves were oven dried at 60°C, ground by a hammer mill (1 mm screen size), and subjected to chemical composition analyzes and in vitro incubation. Determination of chemical composition included crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), lignin, and tannin. Samples (200 mg DM) were incubated in vitro with 10 ml of ruminal fluid and 20 ml of buffer solution at 39°C for 24 h in four replicates. Parameters measured were total gas production, methane emission, volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiles, ammonia concentration, microbial population (total bacteria and total protozoa), and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD). Data were subjected to analysis of variance and Tukey's test. Results showed that a number of forages contained CP of more than 30% DM, i.e. Acacia villosa, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena diversifolia, and Sesbania grandiflora. Exceptionally high tannin content was found in Acacia villosa in which the value was above 20% DM. The lowest total gas production was observed in the in vitro incubation of Acacia villosa, whereas the highest gas production was observed in that of Sesbania grandiflora. This pattern was also observed for the IVOMD parameter. The lowest and the highest methane emissions were observed in the incubation of Acacia villosa and Sesbania grandiflora, respectively. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - We investigated the constituents of Leucaena leucocephala foliage collected from Guangdong province in China and isolated 17 diverse flavonoids (1-17), including flavones (5-9, 11, and 12), flavonols (1, 10, and 16), flavanone 4, flavanonol 15, and flavonol glycosides (2, 3, 13, 14, and 17). Flavonoids quercetin (1), quercetin-3-O-α-rhamnopyranoside (2), and myricetin-3-O-α-rhamnopyranoside (17) were the major flavonoids components in L. leucocephala leaves, at a total concentration of about 2.5% of dry matter. pHRE-Luc inductive activity to mimic the activation of erythropoietin (EPO) gene, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and antioxidant activities of isolated flavonoids (1-17) were evaluated. Flavonoids 7, 10, and 13 could strongly induce the transcriptional activity of pHRE-Luc, which indicated their potential to induce the expression of EPO. Flavonoids 7, 10, 13, and 17 displayed strong anti-inflammatory activity, relatively equal to the positive control dexamethasone. Flavonoids 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 16, and 17 showed stronger antioxidant activities of DPPH radical scavenging capacity than ascorbic acid. Flavonoids 1, 2, and 10 showed weak cellular antioxidant activities against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) induced ROS formation. Flavonoid rhamnoside 2 and arabinoside 3 undergone deglycosylation to the aglycone quercetin under anaerobic incubation with cattle rumen microorganisms. Furthermore, the potential health benefits for ruminant of flavonoids, which was rich in L. leucocephala foliage, was also discussed. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Inoculation of Sinorhizobium saheli YH1 leads to reduced metal uptake for leucaena leucocephala grown in mine tailings and metal-polluted soils
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052623168&doi=10.3389%2ffmicb.2018.01853&partnerID=40&md5=a499faf7e18f76a3e76e200cd4a8eef7
AB  - Metalliferous mine tailings have a negative impact on the soil environment near mining areas and render cultivable lands infertile. Phytoremediation involving the synergism of legume and rhizobia provides a useful technique in tackling this issue with cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and easy-to-use features under adverse soil conditions. Leucaena leucocephala has been found to build symbiotic relationships with native rhizobia in the iron-vanadium-titanium oxide (V-Ti magnetite) mine tailing soil. Rhizobia YH1, isolated from the root nodules of L. leucocephala, was classified as Sinorhizobium saheli according to similarity and phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA, housekeeping and nitrogen fixation genes. Besides nitrogen fixation, S. saheli YH1 also showed capabilities to produce indole-acetic acid (IAA) (166.77 ± 2.03 mg l-1s) and solubilize phosphate (104.41 ± 7.48 mg l-1). Pot culture experiments showed that strain YH1 increased the biomass, plant height and root length of L. leucocephala by 67.2, 39.5 and 27.2% respectively. There was also an average increase in plant N (10.0%), P (112.2%) and K (25.0%) contents compared to inoculation-free control. The inoculation of YH1 not only reduced the uptake of all metals by L. leucocephala in the mine tailings, but also resulted in decreased uptake of Cd by up to 79.9% and Mn by up to 67.6% for plants grown in soils contaminated with Cd/Mn. It was concluded that S. saheli YH1 possessed multiple beneficial effects on L. leucocephala grown in metalliferous soils. Our findings highlight the role of S. saheli YH1 in improving plant health of L. leucocephala by reducing metal uptake by plants grown in heavy metal-polluted soils. We also suggest the idea of using L. leucocephala-S. saheli association for phytoremediation and revegetation of V-Ti mine tailings and soils polluted with Cd or Mn. © 2018 Kang, Yu, Zhang, Cui, Tu, Wang, Li, Hu, Gu, Zhao, Xiang, Chen, Ma, Zou, Zhang and Kang.

TI  - Feed resource selection of Criollo goats artificially infected with Haemonchus contortus: Nutritional wisdom and prophylactic self-medication
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033369076&doi=10.1017%2fS1751731117002634&partnerID=40&md5=855a0f728e1539e910db69a2343bdbbf
AB  - Previous cafeteria studies suggested that a moderate natural gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infection did not modify the resource selection of adult Criollo goats towards tannin-rich plants compared with worm-free goats. A higher infection with Haemonchus contortus could trigger a change in the resource selection behaviour towards tannin-rich foliage. Alternatively, goats might select plant species solely to meet their nutritional requirements. A cafeteria study investigated the effect of a high artificial infection with H. contortus on the feed resource selection of goats. Adult Criollo goats (37.5±4.8 kg BW) with browsing experience were distributed in two groups: the infected group (IG) with six animals artificially infected with H. contortus (6000 L3/animal); and the non-infected group (NIG) with six animals maintained worm-free. The experiment included two 5-day periods with additional 5-day adaptation period. In the first period, animals were offered foliage of five plant species with a decreasing gradient of condensed tannins (CT) (Mimosa bahamensis, Gymnopodium floribundum, Havardia albicans, Acacia pennatula, Lysiloma latisiliqum), and three plant species with negligible CT content (Leucaena leucocephala, Piscidia piscipula and Brosimum alicastrum). In the second period the foliage of B. alicastrum was withdrawn. A grain-based concentrate feed was offered daily at 1% BW in DM basis. Dry matter and nutrient intake was determined. Foliage selection of each experimental group was determined using the Chesson selection index. The H. contortus egg count per gram of faeces (EPG) was determined for infected goats twice daily. Chesson index showed a similar pattern of foliage selection on periods 1 and 2. Mean EPG of goats in IG was 2028±259 EPG during period 1 and 1 293±198 EPG during period 2 (P>0.05). During period 1, the selection pattern was highest for B. alicastrum (tannin-free), followed by a tannin-rich plant (M. bahamensis). These two plants remained as highly selected during period 2. The Chesson index showed that both experimental groups (IG and NIG) selected the same plant species in both periods. Thus, a high H. contortus infection did not affect selection of goats fed with CT-rich plants. Apparently, goats balanced their nutrient intake with the plants selected, showing evidence of nutritional wisdom. This balance may have helped to prevent excess protein in the diet and also to maintain a low GIN infection, both considered as examples of prophylactic self-medication. © The Animal Consortium 2017.

AB  - Oxidative stress can induce vascular endothelial dysfunction in diabetic and hyperlipidemia patients. Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit has been reported of possessing antioxidant, antidiabetic and anticholiesterase activity; as well as the toxic substance called mimosine. Aims:To determine antioxidant effects of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit Leave extracts in oxidative stress induced vascular endothelial function. Methods and Material: Leave extracts were determined for antioxidant activity. Either or both of oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and glucose were applied to induce oxidative stress condition in human umbilical vein cultured (HUVCs) to observe superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, nitric oxide (NO) level and morphological changes. Results: Total polyphenol and flavonoid were 51.04 ± 0.91 mg GAE/g and 0.13 ± 0.01 mg catechin/g of dried weight (DW), respectively. Free radical reduction efficiency of crude extract observed by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay showed IC50 value of 329.6 µg of vitamin C equivalent/mg of extracts. Frap value was showed 428.54 ± 15.32 mM FeII equivalent/g of DW. The result observing in HUVCs showed that comparing to the control, SOD activity, NO and MDA level were maintained in 0.05 mg/mL of L. leucocephala treated group, but NO and MDA level were lowered when comparing with oxLDL and glucose-induced oxidative stress. No change was observed in 0.05 mg/mL of L. leucocephala treated group, comparing with control group. Conclusion: This study has been performed to exhibit the antioxidant activity of L. leucocephala in endothelium functions and has been found to have an appropriate concentration at 0.05 mg/mL in reducing oxidative stress condition in impaired fasting blood glucose patients. Nevertheless, the optimal level for toxic activity in inhibition of cancer angiogenesis should be further investigated. © 2018 Phcog.Net.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and Banana flour (Musa cavendishii) on performance of laying hens. Fifty laying hens (3 months of age) were randomly distributed into five experimental groups, each consisting of 10 laying hens. The groups were control (10 laying hens); L6 (Leucaena, 6 g/day (10 laying hens)); L8 (Leucaena, 8.0 g/day (10 laying hens)); L10 (Leucaena, 10 g/day (10 laying hens)); and L12 (Leucaena, 12 g/day (10 laying hens)), in addition, five levels of Banana flour control (10 laying hens); 25% (10 laying hens); 50%, (10 laying hens); 75% (10 laying hens); and 100% (10 laying hens), were assessed respectively. The experimental period lasted from 4 to 8 weeks. The results of this study showed that there were no significant differences between of treatments L6, L8, L10, and L12 for body weight during the first 30 days compared with the control, whereas for weight gain, statistically significant differences were observed between the control compared with the treatments L6, L8, L10, and L12 for days 10, 20 and 30 (p<0.05). Additionally, statistically significant differences were found between different levels of Banana flour for weight gain (g) between the control with the levels 25, 50 75, 100%, respectively for days 20 and 30. In the case of feed intake (g) statistically significant differences were found during day 30 between the control and 100%, also between the control and levels 25, and 75%, respectively. From the results, it can be concluded that the inclusion of Leucaena and banana flour have effects on weight gain, body weight and feed intake of laying hens. © 2018, Fundacao APINCO de Ciencia e Tecnologia Avicolas.

AB  - Methanogenesis is part of the energetic metabolism of ruminants, however there are legumes that have specific characteristics, which help reduce the production of anthropogenic methane. The objective was to determine the in vitro greenhouse gas (GHG) production of tree legumes from the Mexican dry tropics. The substrates were dry pods of Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Samanea saman and Acacia cochliacantha; as well as, dry pods and green leaf of Guazuma ulmifolia y Leucaena leucocephala. The biodigester contained 0.5 g of type substrate and 50 mL of incubated culture medium at 39 ° C. In the biodigesters, the gas production kinetics were determine by measuring the gas displacement at 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h for calculate maximum gas volume (Vm) and gas production rate (S). The mL displaced gas was used for estimate GHG moles at 24, 48 and 72 h. The methane moles were calculated at 24, 48 and 72 h. Statistical analysis was a completely randomized design. The E. cyclocarpum pod showed better Vm and S (P<0.05). The S. saman pod quantified less (P<0.05) Vm than E. cyclocarpum, but S did not show differences (P>0.05). E. cyclocarpum pod produced 43.8 and 29.9 % more total GHG and methane than S. saman pod. The GHG and methane total production of L. leucocephala pod and leaf did not show differences (P>0.05) and methane represented on average 17 % of GHG. Under these conditions concluded: The pods of E. cyclocarpum and S. saman have good fermentation parameters and proportion of methane produced is smaller with the rest of the evaluated legumes. © 2018, UCOPress.

AB  - The above and below–ground biomass (AGB and BGB) relationship is often used to assess the impact of biotic and abiotic effects on the growth and development of individual plants. The AGB and BGB relationship of the same tree species in different habitats can change significantly because of environmental stress. To investigate how the tree size, the biomass allocation and BGB/AGB ratio of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit varied according to spacing and mixed plant patterns in a valley–type savanna of southwest China, we examined the growth of L. leucocephala, and sampled 23 individuals for biomass measurement in each of four treatments (close/wide spacing of Leucaena leucocephala monocultures, mixed plantation of Leucaena leucocephala and Eucalyptus camaldulensis, and mixed plantation of Leucaena leucocephala and Eucalyptus citriodora), and then determined the regression relationships between AGB and BGB of L. leucocephala in different plant stands. Our results indicated that mixed planting significantly reduced all growth metrics for the tree sizes of L. leucocephala and increased the value of BGB/AGB. Changing plant spacing in monocultures had a significant impact on AGB and TB (Total Biomass) of L. leucocephala, but it had no significant effect on the other metrics. Within mixed plant schemes, L. leucocephala significantly reduced the biomass allocation to leaves and small roots and increased the allocation to coarse root biomass. There were no significant differences in tree size and biomass allocation of L. leucocephala between different spacing regimes in monocultures or between different mixtures in mixed plant stands. The correlation between BGB and AGB of L. leucocephala in all plant stands was consistent with the model of allometric growth, and AGB can be used to accurately estimate BGB. Interestingly, the correlations were not exactly the same. BGB and AGB in monoculture showed isometric growth, and their values in mixed plant stands showed allometric growth. BGB also increased faster than AGB. The findings indicated that L. leucocephala allocated more biomass to the root system when it was planted with Eucalyptus. © 2018 Liu et al.

AB  - The present article aims to evaluate the biostimu-lating effect of Trichoderma harzianum Rifai in the seedling production of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit., Cedrela odorata L., and Pithecello-bium saman (Jacq.) Merr. An experiment for each specie was carried out under nursery conditions. A totally randomized design was used with four parcels by treatment. The treatments were: Trichoderma harzianum to reason of 20 g.L-1 and to 40 g.L-1, and a control. The germination percentage was evaluated, and the morphometric variables diameter of the shaft, height and dry matter of the root and the air part of the plant. The treatments with Trichoderma didn’t increase the germination percentage in cedar, saman and leucaena. T. harzianum increased the height, the number of leaves and the dry biomass of the foliar area in the cedar seedlings, while in leucaena and saman only it incremented the basal diameter of the seedlings. © 2018 Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas.

AB  - The effect of feeding graded levels of detoxified Leucaena leucocephala meal (LLM) basal diet on carcass and meat quality attributes of broiler chickens was investigated. Seven isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets were formulated both for starter and finisher phases, designated TI, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6 and T7. The control diet no Leucaena meal (T1) was maize-soybean based diet, while 5% soaked Leucaena meal (T2), 10% soaked Leucaena meal (T3), 5% boiled Leucaena meal (T4),10% bolied Leucaena meal (T5), 5% raw Leucaena meal (T6) and 10% raw Leucaena meal (T7) were incorporated into the diets and were supplemented with 0.3% methionine. 140 day old broiler chicks (Marshall Strain) purchased from Obasanjo Farm (Ota in Nigeria) were used for this study. Completely randomized design (CRD) with statistical model Yij=µ+Ti + random error was employed. At the end of 8 weeks of feeding trial, 56 birds (8 birds from each group) were randomly selected, slaughtered and processed. Carcass cut - up parts were weighed and their percentages calculated, meat quality was measured through physical variables and sensory evaluation using a taste panel and the scores were analysed with a 9-point hedonic scale where 1 = dislike extremely and 9 = like extremely. The results showed that T5 had higher life (1787± 0.59g), eviscerated (943.67±1.00g), thigh (71.98±1.00g) and back (189.92±1.00g) weights as well as carcass (63.43±0.10), thigh (7.55±0.10), back (19.92±0.58) and wing (6.65±0.08) dressing percentages. Meat cooking loss (46.54±1.00) and thermal shortening (63.59±1.00) were higher in meat from T6, but meat from T4 had higher cooking yield (68.08±1.00) and water holding capacity (51.33±1.00). Meat samples from T1 (5.23±1.00), T3 (5.25±1.00), T6 (5.29±0.52) and T7 (5.36±1.00) Shear force values while meat samples from T4 had higher colour (5.90±0.06), flavour (5.73±0.10) and overall acceptability(5.77±1.00) scores, however, T4 and T5 elicited higher tenderness (5.40±1.00), (5.20±1.00) juiciness (5.60±0.11), and texture (5.50±0.11), (5.43±0.11) scores. Feeding broiler chicken with boiled L. leucocephala in meal was recommended since it furnished high carcass and meat attribute of broiler chicken in this study. © 2018 Trop. Agric. (Trinidad).

AB  - The aim of the experiment was to determine the chemical composition, in vitro gas and methane production and rumen degradable substrate of pods from five leguminous tree species (Leucaena leucocephala, Albiza julibrissin, Robinia pseudoacacia, Acacia karroo and Gleditsia triacanthos) fed to small ruminant animals in Turkey.The pods had adequate levels of crude protein (13-21% in DM), high levels of water soluble DM (30-50% in DM) and moderate levels of NDF (33-51% in DM). Concentrations of condensed tannin were relatively low (0.56-4.3% in DM) except for Gleditsia triacanthos (7.99%). In anin vitro rumen incubation, there was a close relationship (R 2=0.75)) between level of condensed tannin in the pods and methane concentration in the gas for four of the five species. Gleditsia triacanthos with the highest level of condensed tannin (8.0%) and the highest level of methane in the gas (6.2%) did not fit this relationship; the high content of sugars reported for this species may have been the factor contributing to the atypical relationship between the condensed tannin content and methane production. Methane content of the gas was linearly related with rate of gas production (R2=0.91, dry matter mineralized over the 24 h incubation (R2=0.97) and with the content of waCer soluble dry matter in the pods (R2=0.99). The NDF content in the pods was a less reliable measure of methane production (R2=0.78). © 2018, Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.

AB  - The exploitation of wood energy purposes (firewood and charcoal) has caused reduction in native vegetation, added to this, problems are generated for fauna, flora and soil. The objective of the research was to evaluate the energy characteristics of charcoal Aroeira (Myracrodruon urundeuva Allemão) and Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) R. de Wit). Suppression of five specimens of urundeuva Myracrodruon and Leucaena leucocephala was performed, following quality, phenological and health criteria. Carbonization was performed in duplicate, using anhydrous wood. Also, it was carried out the coal chemical analysis and the determination of true and bulk densities. The gross calorific value was determined by adiabatic calorimeter. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design (DIC) and the values were submitted to analysis of variance by the test “F” at 5% of probability level. The Myracrodruon urundeuva wood and Leucaena leucocephala showed no statistical differences, with 41.22% and 40.59% of charcoal. The apparent density of charcoal Myracrodruon urundeuva (0.59 g/cm3) was higher than that of Leucaena leucocephala (0.39 g/cm3), but the species were similar to the true density of charcoal, with 1.21 g/cm3 and 1.11 g/cm3, respectively. Similarly, the gross calorific value of charcoal showed no difference between species the wood, Myracrodruon urundeuva (6869 kcal/kg) and Leucaena leucocephala (6977 kcal/kg). The amount of released volatiles and ash produced was higher on the wood Myracrodruon urundeuva with 33.87% and 3.79%. The fixed carbon content was higher in Leucaena leucocephala (67.15%). The species showed similar energy characteristics so the wood of Leucaena leucocephala can be used for the production and the use of charcoal when compared to the native species which are already known and are used for the same purposes. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Our understanding of the processes influencing the storage and dynamics of carbon (C) in soils under semi-arid agroforestry systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is limited. This study evaluated soil C pools in woodlot species of Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Melia azedarach (L.), and Gmelina arborea Roxb.; and in farmland and Ngitili, a traditional silvopastoral system in northwestern Tanzania. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was analyzed in the whole soil to 1 m depth and to 0.4 m in macroaggregates (2000–250 μm), microaggregates (250–53 μm), and silt and clay-sized aggregates (<53 μm) to provide information of C dynamics and stabilization in various land uses. Synchrotron-based C K-edge x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy was also used to study the influence of these land use systems on the soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry to understand the mechanisms of soil C changes. Whole soil C stocks in woodlots (43–67 Mg C ha−1) were similar to those in the reserved Ngitili systems (50–59 Mg C ha−1), indicating the ability of the planted woodlots on degraded lands to restore SOC levels similar to the natural woodlands. SOC in the woodlots were found to be associated more with the micro and silt-and clay-sized aggregates than with macroaggregates, reflecting higher stability of SOC in the woodlot systems. The continuous addition of litter in the woodlots preserved recalcitrant aromatic C compounds in the silt and clay-sized aggregates as revealed by the XANES C K-edge spectra. Therefore establishment of woodlots in semi-arid regions in Tanzania appear to make significant contributions to the long-term SOC stabilization in soil fractions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the experiment was to assess the effect of increasing amounts of Leucaena leucocephala forage on dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI), enteric methane production, rumen fermentation pattern and protozoa population in cattle fed Pennisetum purpureum and housed in respiration chambers. Methods: Five crossbred heifers (Bos taurus×Bos indicus) (BW: 295±6 kg) were fed chopped P. purpureum grass and increasing levels of L. leucocephala (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of dry matter [DM]) in a 5×5 Latin square design. Results: The voluntary intake and methane production were measured for 23 h per day in respiration chambers; molar proportions of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were determined at 6 h postprandial period. Molar concentration of VFAs in rumen liquor were similar (p>0.05) between treatments. However, methane production decreased linearly (p<0.005), recording a maximum reduction of up to ∼61% with 80% of DM incorporation of L. leucocephala in the ration and no changes (p>0.05) in rumen protozoa population were found. Conclusion: Inclusion of 80% of L. leucocephala in the diet of heifers fed low-quality tropical forages has the capacity to reduce up to 61.3% enteric methane emission without affecting DMI, OMI, and protozoa population in rumen liquor. © 2018 by Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences.

TI  - Sapling biomass allometry and carbon content in five afforestation species on marginal farmland in semi-arid Benin
PY  - 2018

AB  - Allometric equations are routinely used in the estimation of biomass stocks for carbon accounting within forest ecosystems. However, generic equations may not reflect the growth trajectories of afforestation species that are introduced to degraded farmland characterized by water and nutrient limitations. Using sequential measurements of the height, basal diameter, and above- and belowground biomass of juvenile trees, we developed allometric equations for five woody species (Moringa oleifera Lam., Leucaena leucocephala Lam., Jatropha curcas L., Anacardium occidentale L. and Parkia biglobosa Jacq.) subjected to a gradient of water and nutrient availability in an afforestation trial on degraded cropland in the semi-arid zone of Benin, West Africa. For three of the species studied, the allometric relationships between basal diameter and biomass components (i.e. leaves, stems and roots) were described best by a simple power-law model (R2 > 0.93). The incorporation of species-specific height–diameter relationships and total height as additional predictors in the power-law function also produced reasonable estimates of biomass. Fifteen months after planting, roots accounted for 10–58% of the total biomass while the root-to-shoot ratio ranged between 0.16 and 0.73. The total biomass of the saplings ranged between 1.4 and 10.3 Mg ha−1, yielding 0.6–4.3 Mg C ha−1, far exceeding the biomass in the traditional fallow system. The rate of stem carbon sequestration measured ca. 0.62 Mg C ha−1 year−1. Overall, the allometric equations developed in this study are generally useful for assessing the standing shoot and root biomass of the five afforestation species during the juvenile growth stage and can help in reporting and verifying carbon stocks in young forests. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Jasmonate-Elicited Stress Induces Metabolic Change in the Leaves of Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041374191&doi=10.3390%2fmolecules23020188&partnerID=40&md5=ca66f83410bc6085a51f97720205f5ed
AB  - The plant Leucaena leucocephala was exposed to four jasmonate elicitors, i.e., jasmonic acid (JA), methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA), jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) and 6-ethyl indanoyl glycine conjugate (2-[(6-ethyl-1-oxo-indane-4-carbonyl)-amino]-acetic acid methyl ester) (CGM). The treatment was to mimic the herbivores and wounding stresses. By using NMR spectroscopy along with chemometric analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), the changes of metabolites in the leaves of L. leucocephala were determined under the stress as induced by the four elicitors. The challenge of JA-Ile caused an accumulation of lactic acid (6), β-glucose (10), alanine (12), threonine (13), steroids (18), 3,4-dihydroxypyridine (19) and an unidentified compound 20. The chemometric analysis of the PCA and PLS-DA models indicated that the alternation of metabolites triggered by JA, MeJA, and CGM treatments were very minimum. In contrast, the treatment by JA-Ile could induce the most significant metabolic changes in the leaves. Moreover, there was very minimal new metabolite being detected in responding to the jasmonate-induced stresses. The results showed some metabolite concentrations changed after application of the elicitors, which may be related to a high level of tolerance to stress conditions as well as the strong ecological suitability of L. leucocephala.

AB  - In this study, Leucaena leucocephala wood was pretreated with aqueous glycerol having H2SO4 as the catalyst. Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to optimize the process parameters, catalyst concentration (1–3%), duration (120–300 min) and temperature (100–150 °C). ANN gave more accurate predictions for total reducing sugar yield than RSM. ANN also had lower values for error functions. Severity index (SI) was calculated based on the temperature, duration and catalyst concentration. Increase in SI from 0.21 * 103 to 2.06 * 103 increased total reducing sugar (TRS) production from 39.97 g/kg to 321.8 g/kg. Further increase in SI reduced the TRS and this change positively correlates with the loss of cellulose content. Correlation analysis showed that severity index can also be used to describe pretreatment process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nitrogen is an essential macro-nutrient for plant growth and is indispensable for high agricultural food productivity and quality. Shortage of good quality forage under the dry winter season and low soil fertility conditions are the major constraints in rural farming systems in the Moist Tall Grassveld of the Upper Thukela, South Africa. The effect of legumes on inorganic soil nitrogen was assessed in an agroforestry trial (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit, Acacia karroo Hayne, Dactylis glomerata L., Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), by soil sampling method. In the agroforestry trial, total inorganic soil nitrogen accumulation was significantly greater under intercropping than under sole crop treatments and, irrespective of the treatments, significantly more nitrate than ammonium nitrogen was measured. The study demonstrated that intercropping grasses with tree legumes could provide important ecosystem services of nitrogen supply in the soil. The results suggested that introducing legume intercrops might constitute a relevant cropping strategy to improve the soil fertility status with regard to nitrogen while at the same time providing forage in smallholder farming systems in South Africa’s Moist Tall Grassveld regions. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Aim: The study was conducted to evaluate eight tree leaves based on polyphenolic content and rumen in vitro incubation and gas production technique (RIVIGPT) for their nutritive potentiality. Materials and Methods: Eight selected tree leaves, namely Sesbania grandiflora, Melia dubia, Dillenia spp., Artocarpus heterophyllus, Commiphora caudata, Moringa oleifera, Leucaena leucocephala, and Acacia auriculiformis, were selected for proximate composition, forage fiber fractions, total phenolics (TPs), non-tannin phenols (NTPs), total tannins (TTs), condensed tannins (CTs), and hydrolysable tannins (HTs); RIVIGP with and without polyethylene glycol (PEG); and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) (modified in vitro two stage) analysis was conducted. On the basis of RIVIGPT, the in vitro digestible organic matter (IVDOM) and dry matter intake (DMI) was calculated. Results: Crude protein (CP) content of tree leaves ranged from 9.59 to 25.81%, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) 28.16 to 53.33%, acid detergent fiber (ADF) 21.26 to 41.7%, acid detergent lignin (ADL) 3.62 to 21.98%, TP 1.83 to 17.35%, TT 0.40 to 15.47%, and CTs 0.02 to 15.26%. IVDMD (%) was ranged from 64.95 to 88.12. The mean metabolizable energy (ME) (MJ/Kg) of tree leaves estimated with and without PEG was 7.75±0.56 and 8.75±0.39, in vitro gas production at 24 h (IVGP24) (ml) 31.06±4.14 and 37.09±2.64, initial gas production (a) (ml) 0.49±0.63 and 1.33±0.72, potential gas production (D) (ml) 38.74±4.27 and 43.79±2.44, rate of gas production (k) (h−1) 0.11±0.02 and 0.11±0.013, t1/2 (ml) 9.81±2.41 and 7.42±0.80, in vitro gas production at 96 h IVGP96 (ml) 39.50±4.430 and 45.14±2.65, the predicted IVDOM (%) 55.44±4.15 and 61.98±3.03, and DMI (g/Kg W0.75) 103.1±14.76 and 104.3±10.16, respectively. The addition of PEG showed an improvement in IVGP24, IVGP96, ME, predicted IVDOM, and predicted DMI. CP was positively correlated with ME, IVGP24, IVGP96, a+b, k (r=0.749, p<0.05), IVDMD, IVDOM, and DMI (r=0.838, p<0.05) and negatively correlated with a and t1/2. NDF, ADF, and ADL contents were negatively correlated with ME (r=0.899, p<0.05), IVGP24 (r=−0.867, p<0.05), IVGP96 (r=−0.858, p<0.05), a+b (p<0.05), k (r=−0.828, p<0.05), IVDMD, IVDOM (r=−0.853, p<0.05), and DMI and positively correlated with a and t1/2. TP, TT, and CT were negatively correlated with ME, IVGP, IVGP96, a+b, k, IVDMD, IVDOM, and DMI and positively correlated with a (r=0.808, p<0.05) and t1/2. ME (MJ/Kg) was positively correlated with IVGP24 (r=0.938, p<0.05), IVGP96 (r=0.875, p<0.05), a+b (r=0.813, p<0.05), k (r=0.731, p<0.05), IVDMD, IVDOM (r=0.985, p<0.05), and DMI (r=0.727, p<0.05) and negatively correlated with a and t1/2. Conclusion: In the present study, the potentiality of tree leaves was assessed based on CP, ADF, ADL, TP, CT, IVGP, ME, IVDMD, predicted IVDOM, and predicted DMI. Based on this, it can be concluded that S. grandiflora, M. dubia, M. Oleifera, and L. leucocephala were graded as best; A. heterophyllus and C. caudata as moderate; and Dillenia spp. and A. auriculiformis as lowest potential ruminant feed. © 2018 Veterinary World.

AB  - The laboratory acclimatized Clarias gariepinus (80 ± 10 g) were divided into six groups and five subgroups each containing 10 fish. A fish feed was reconstituted by adding 33% powder of Leucaena leucocephala seed in place of fish trash. Group B, C and E were fed on reconstituted feed and group A, D and F were fed on artificial feed containing animal protein for 7 days prior to start of experiments. Then Group B was challenged with BSA while other groups were challenged with Vibrio harveyi (Group C, D) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Group E, F). Group A was used as negative control (not challenged with antigen). The fish were challenged on weekly intervals till 28th day. Blood was collected from one subgroup of each group on day 7, 14, 21 & 28 and finally sacrificed on day 35. Change in body weight, liver function tests (SGOT, SGPT) and serum ALP levels were monitored. The phagocytic index, percentage phagocytosis and nitric oxide levels were measured in macrophages isolated from spleen and head kidney. The levels of total fish immunoglobulin were also measured following indirect ELISA. The results showed improved immune response in fish fed on 33% L. leucocephala pod seed reconstituted feed; however their specific growth rate was low. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Potential anti-flavivirus herbals: A better and safer heath alternatives
PY  - 2018
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047543594&doi=10.5958%2f0975-6892.2018.00015.1&partnerID=40&md5=6e2b262549ccd34881eed5c810ead3f2
AB  - Flaviviral infections are increasing at an alarming rate creating a global health concern. As a result, targeted and focused research for developing suitable diagnostics and therapeutics against the re-emergent infection have become the need of the hour. The targeted search of natural antiviral measures surged, as such ancient practices have been used to treat different vector borne infections like malaria, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Antivirals can serve to be safer, cheaper and more importantly non-toxic than the chemical alternatives. This article encompasses and elucidate the potential antiflaviviral activities of herbals (medicinal plants), which are geographically distributed around the world, and have significant potential to be used or are being screened to treat similar existent infections. Medicinal plants under trials for their antiflaviviral properties are also covered in this review. Ongoing studies suggest that medicinal plants can be a rich source for flaviviral combating compounds but further more investigations are needed to establish the potentiality of these medicinal herbs for new emergent flavivirus infection control. Enormous scope is available in these herbals, which can result in bringing out viable alternatives and long term resistance against the emerging and re-emerging flaviviral diseases. © 2018, IndianJournals.com.

TI  - Exploration of various indonesian indigenous plants as natural coagulants for synthetic turbid water
PY  - 2018

AB  - The availability of clean water is one of the biggest global problems, especially in developing countries. The simplest way to treat turbid water is by using coagulation. However, the utilization of chemical coagulants such as alum and ferrum has several drawbacks, including a high sludge volume and negative health impact when the water is consumed. Natural coagulants offer a better option, especially because of their availability, low price, lower sludge volume, and effectiveness comparable with chemical coagulants. In this study we utilize Moringa oleifera, Carica papaya and Leucaena leucocephala seeds, which are indigenous plants in Indonesia, as natural coagulants. An FTIR study was conducted to qualitatively identify the possible active coagulant agent in the seeds. The coagulant performance in removing turbidity of synthetic kaolin water was studied using jar test apparatus at various levels of coagulant dosage and pH. Functional groups of -OH, N-H, C=O, and primary, secondary and tertiary amides were identified in all the seeds. Neither the dosage nor the pH had an effect on turbidity removal when M.oleifera was used as the natural coagulant, but did have some effect on papaya and leucaena. The turbidity removal obtained in this study was comparable with other reported results, therefore it can be concluded that these seeds have the potential to be used as natural coagulants. © IJTech 2018.

AB  - The use of green manures as alternatives to minimize the usage of chemical fertilizers that are very expensive and also environmentally unfriendly is considered as a good agronomic practice. However, the effect of each green manure on soil properties and crop yield depends on its chemical composition. Hence field experiments were conducted in sandy soil during 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 to compare impacts of green manures (GM) and N15:P15:K15 fertilizer on soil properties, growth, root yield, mineral, starch and hydrocyanic acid (HCN) contents of cassava. The GM from leaves of: Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.), Moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam.), Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp.) and Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) were applied at 5 t ha-1, and the NPK fertilizer was applied at 400 kg ha-1. There was a no fertilizer (control). Application of GMs reduced soil bulk density and increased soil organic matter (OM), N, P, K, Ca, Mg, growth and fresh root yield of cassava compared with the control. The NPK fertilizer had no effect on soil bulk density and soil OM, but increased soil N, P, K, Ca, Mg, growth and fresh root yield of cassava compared with the control. Gliricidia increased growth and fresh root yield of cassava compared with other GMs and NPK fertilizer. In the first year (2015/2016) and compared with control; Gliricidia, Moringa, Leucaena, Neem and NPK fertilizer increased fresh root yield of cassava by 53, 33, 30, 29 and 28%, respectively. In the second year (2016/2017), these treatments increased fresh root yield of cassava by 85, 65, 61, 60 and 36%, respectively. The GMs and NPK fertilizer increased mineral and starch contents and reduced HCN content in the cassava tuber roots compared with the control. Use of GM has potential to improve soil properties, and growth, fresh root yield and nutritional contents of cassava than does NPK fertilizer. The Gliricidia treatment best improved soil properties and cassava productivity as indicated by the benefit:cost ratio. For those growing cassava for fresh root quantity Gliricidia is recommended as green manure. Moringa is recommended as green manure for those that desire fresh root quality. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of feeding bull Bali Cattle kept in extensive husbnadry system with concentrates contained gliricidia sepium leaf meal and banana strach tuber meal in their feed consumptions and dried organic matter digestibility. Three bull Bali cattle aged 1 - 2 years old with an initial body weight of 135.5 kg - 168.0 kg were used in this study. The three treatments used were T0 = local feeds (consisted of Leucaena leucocephala, Acasia leochophloea, and Ficus sp. leaves as commonly used by local farmers); T1 = T0 + 1 kg concentrate (contained banana strach tuber meal + gliricidia sepium leaf meal); T2 = T1 +2 kg concentrate (contained banana strach tuber meal + gliricidia sepium leaf meal). The results showed that the dry matter intake were: 2.40, 3.52, and 4.14; organic matter intake were: 2.17, 3.32, and 3.62; dry matter digestible was 64.63%, 72.45%, 77.28% and organic matter digestible was 66.79%, 74.66%, 79.33% for T0, T1, and T2, respectively. There was no effect (P>0.05) of treatments on the three parameters observed on bull Bali cattle kept in extensive husbandry system and fed with concentrates contained leaf gliricidia sepium meal and banana starch tuber meal. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is an arboreal legume with many applications in agriculture (forage, wood production, charcoal, soil improvement, shading, windbreak, and hedge). Its seeds show dormancy, which is caused by physical blockade through resistant and impermeable integument. The aims of this study were to evaluate and determine efficient methods for overcoming dormancy in Leucaena leucocephala seeds. The experiment was carried out in Tangará da Serra city, Brazil, adopting a completely randomized design, with four replications. The treatments consisted of no scarification (T0), scarification with sandpaper (T1), immersion in concentrated H2SO4 for 5 min (T2), 10' (T3), 15' (T4), and 20' (T5), and immersion in water at 80°C for 5' (T6), 10' (T7), 15' (T8) and 20' (T9). The seeds were placed in germination chamber at a temperature of 25°C and photoperiod of 12 hours day/night over a period of 10 days, for all treatments, using 50 seeds per replicate. The experimental data were submitted to analysis of variance (type I error) by F test (p < 0.05) with comparison of averages performed by Tukey test (p < 0.05). The treatment that showed best efficiency in overcoming seed dormancy was immersion in concentrated H2SO4 (density of 1.84 and purity of 95%) for 20 min, with 93.0% of viable seed germinated. Immersion of seeds in water at 80°C for 20 min (0.0% seed germination) showed lowest efficiency in overcoming dormancy of Leucaena leucocephala seeds. It was concluded that treatment with immersion in concentrated H2SO4 for 20 min is the most efficient in overcoming dormancy of Leucaena leucocephala seeds, showing higher values of first germination count, germination percentage, germination speed index and average time of germination. © 2018, Southern Cross Publishing.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) is an arboreal species of wide use in the world, mainly for feeding ruminants in semiarid climate regions. Given its relevance, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of water and thermal stress on the germination and vigor of L. leucocephala seeds. The experiment was installed in 3 x 4 factorial arrangement, considering the water potential (0.0,-0.3 and-0.6 MPa) and temperature (25, 30, 35 and 40 °C) factors on the seeds germination performance. The variables evaluated were: germination, abnormal seedlings, first germination count, germination speed index and seedling performance (length and dry mass weight of root and aerial part). The reduction of the water potential from-0.3 MPa reduced the germination and seed vigor, indicating that the tolerance of the species to water stress in the germination phase is low. The temperature range of 25-30 °C is ideal for germination and seedlings initial growth, but the seeds continue to germinate under a temperature elevation to 35 °C. The L. leucocephala seeds are poorly tolerant to water and thermal stresses and, consequently, the germinative capacity and vigor are reduced with decreasing water potential from-0.3 MPa and temperatures above 30 °C. © 2018 Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

TI  - Effect of tree density on competition between Leucaena leucocephala and Chloris gayana using a Nelder Wheel trial. I. Aboveground interactions

AB  - Silvopastoral systems with the tree legume leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) and grass pastures are widely used for ruminant feeding in subtropical and tropical regions. Different densities and planting configurations of leucaena will influence relative yields of both species because of intra- and interspecific competition. With the aim to describe the effects of competition between leucaena and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Kunth), a Nelder Wheel trial with 10 different leucaena tree densities (100-80 000 trees ha -1) growing with and without Rhodes grass was established in a subtropical environment at Gatton, south-east Queensland, in November 2013. From 2014 to 2016, the biomass of leucaena (six harvests) and Rhodes grass (seven harvests) was measured by using allometric equations and the BOTANAL sampling procedure over 742 and 721 days, respectively. No complementary or facilitative aboveground interactions were observed between the leucaena and Rhodes grass components of the pasture system. Increasing leucaena tree density resulted in greater aboveground intra- and interspecific competition. Average maximum individual tree yield (38.9 kg DM tree -1 year -1) was reached at 100 trees ha -1 without grass competition and was reduced by 60% with grass competition. Rhodes grass biomass yield was negatively affected by shading from the leucaena canopy, with negligible grass yield at tree densities ≥8618 trees ha -1. Therefore, there was effectively no grass competition on individual tree yield at higher leucaena densities. Accordingly, edible leucaena biomass per unit area was positively related to log 10 leucaena density (R 2 = 0.99) regardless of grass competition, reaching 21.7 t DM ha -1 year -1 (2014-15) and 27 t DM ha -1 year -1 (2015-16) at the highest leucaena density of 80 000 trees ha -1. By contrast, the yield of Rhodes grass was linearly and inversely correlated with log 10 tree density (R 2 = 0.99). Practical implications for the design and management of commercial leucaena-grass pastures are discussed. © CSIRO.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Petai Belalang) is a worldwide success as a long-lived and highly nutritious forage tree. The benefits of L. Leucaena was mainly used as food for both human and animal. This plant also was proposed for being applied in medical and cosmetic. However, there are still no commercial used, and no serious intention in discovering the scientific proof for the present of bioactive compound inside L. Leucocephala. Therefore, this work come out with the scope to analyze the antioxidants contains in seeds of L. Leucocephala. Phytochemical screening assay involved in this study is free radical diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, folin-ciocalteu method, colorimetric assay and a molybdenum blue method. Through all testing, the antioxidant activity, total phenolic content, total flavonoid content and total phosphorus content were been determined. Antioxidant activities are higher under extraction using methanol (dried sample) which is 593.09 mg/L, total phenolic content are higher under extraction using deionized water (dried sample) which is 5587.50 mg/L, total flavonoid content are higher under extraction using methanol (dried sample) which is 445.05 mg/L, and phosphorus analysis are higher under extraction using methanol (dried sample) which is 73.817 mg/L. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - White yam (Dioscorea rotundata) was planted in the abandoned quarry to determine the growth and yield effects of mycorrhizal fungi, green manure, and other soil amendments. Seed yams were planted on the heaps (1 m x 1 m) in three replicates and three blocks. Data collected were analyzed using analysis of variance and Duncan multiple range test. The results showed that Glomus mosseae, Glomus etunicatum, green manure of Gliricidia sepium (GS), poultry manure, and NPK fertilizer influence yam's shoot, root, and tuber weights. It was further observed that the combined treatments of GS and Leucaena leucocephala had better enhancement of growth and yield characters of yam. Biofertilizers together with plant and animal remains are therefore recommended for the bioremediation of quarry and other areas affected by natural, human, or ecological activities. © 2018 AEXTJ.

AB  - This paper presents a review of relevant literature and research on the potential of silvopastoral systems for milk and meat production in Cuba. This work emphasizes the contribution of trees in pasture systems, which are known to improve the plant community as well as increase the productive efficiency of steers, reproductive females and dairy cattle. Results from this research suggest that, due to the association effect, both the availability of dry matter and the total protein content of gramineous plants is increased in pastoral systems that incorporate trees while also maintaining pasture. In systems of gramineous plants that have been mixed with Leucaena leucocephala and that support cows of average potential, it is possible to obtain milk production of 10 kg/cow/day in addition to live-weight gains of 0.500-0.600 kg/animal day-1 in Cebú cattle. This work concludes that the use of silvopastoral systems is a viable option for the production of milk and meat under low-input conditions, such as those in Cuba. © 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: The objective of this work was to prepare a highly efficient adsorbent from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit via pyrolysis and chemical activation (H3PO4) with a modification (MnO4                             − and Fe3+) process for HAsO4                             2− removal from aqueous solution. It has been found that the activated carbon prepared by pyrolysis activation at a temperature of 500 °C for 2 h (502) exhibited the best performance for the adsorption of the I2 number (505.69 mg g−1) and Fe3+ (28.18 mg g−1). After carbonized carbon (CC) and 502 were modified by using MnO4                             − and Fe3+, the HAsO4                             2− adsorption capacity was increased up to 100 times when compared with CC and 502 without chemical modification. The pH range of about 6–7 was appropriate for Fe3+ and the HAsO4                             2− adsorption. For the regeneration of adsorbent, the Fe3+ and HAsO4                             2− could be successfully desorbed from the CC surface by using 1.0 mol L−1 HNO3 solution. The adsorption data were well described by the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order kinetic models, which could be confirmed by R2 close to 1. Moreover, the adsorption behaviors were physisorption, spontaneous and endothermic, confirmed by Themkin and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherms as well as thermodynamic studies. This research was expected to help to understand the adsorption behavior of As(V) and to provide a suitable process with high adsorption capacity.

AB  - The aimed of the study was to explore the presence of Rhizobium bacteria along the northern coast of Central Java, to develop a saline-resistant legumes. Rhizobium bacteria is a mutualistic bacterium capable of symbiosis with legumes so that legumes crop yields increase. The research begins with sampling of soil and root nodule of forage legumes along the Northern Coast of Central Java including Tegal, Pekalongan, Semarang, Demak, Pati. Soil samples were analysed for salinity, Total Dissolved Solids, and pH. Rhizobium bacteria were isolated from the acquired root nodule, then identified by biochemical test to ensure that the isolates obtained were Rhizobium bacteria. The results showed that the five districts/municipal sites sampled by the soil have very low salinity to very high levels. The highest level of soil salinity was found in Demak (Sayung) which has an electrical conductivity value (EC) of 17.77 mmhos/cm. The EC values of legumes overgrown soils showed a low salinity level while bare soils have high salinity levels. Feed crops legumes that could be found in the northern coast of Central Java were Centrosema pubescens, Calopogonium mucunoides, Leucaena leucocephala, and Sesbania grandiflora. The study obtained 6 kinds of isolates of rhizobium bacteria isolated from forage legumes, included 1) Centrosema pubescens isolated from Pekalongan, 2) Centrosema pubescens isolated from Tegal, 3) Calopogonium mucunoides isolated from Pekalongan, 4) Leucaenaleucocephala isolated from Tegal, 5) Leucaena leucocephala isolated from Semarang, 6) Sesbania grandiflora isolated from Tegal. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Overabundant ungulate populations can alter forests. Concurrently, global declines of seed dispersers may threaten native forest structure and function. On an island largely devoid of native vertebrate seed dispersers, we monitored forest succession for 7 years following ungulate exclusion from a 5-ha area and adjacent plots with ungulates still present. We observed succession from open scrub to forest and understory cover by non-native plants declined. Two trees, native Hibiscus tiliaceus and non-native Leucaena leucocephala, accounted for most forest regeneration, with the latter dominant. Neither species is dependent on animal dispersers nor was there strong evidence that plants dependent on dispersers migrated into the 5-ha study area. Passive restoration following ungulate removal may facilitate restoration, but did not show promise for fully restoring native forest on Guam. Restoration of native forest plants in bird depopulated areas will likely require active outplanting of native seedlings, control of factors resulting in bird loss, and reintroduction of seed dispersers. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - Background and Objective: Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) is one of the potential legumes that is a source of protein feed for ruminants. Leucaena has approximately 24% protein. Leucaena usage is restricted because it contains the anti-nutrient mimosine (7.19%). Mimosine causes hair loss in sheep and inhibits the action of the hormone thyroxine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the concentration of mimosine in the blood, rumen, urine, faeces, blood metabolites and thyroid hormones of sheep fed rations containing different levels of leucaena leaf meal. Methodology: There were two kinds of treatments: P1 = Napier grass 60+15% Gliricidia sepium+15% Leucaena leucocephala+10% Pollard and P2 = Napier grass 60+30% Leucaena leucocephala+10% Pollard. This experiment used a randomized block design. The variables observed in this study were the concentration of mimosine in the blood, rumen, urine, faeces, blood metabolites and thyroid hormones. Results: The results showed that different levels of leucaena leaf meal did not have significant effects on the mimosine concentration in the rumen, blood, urine, faeces, blood metabolites and thyroid hormones. Mimosine disappearance from consumption to excretion was between 34-68%. Conclusion: The addition of 30% Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal could be used without a negative effect on blood metabolites and thyroid hormones of sheep. © 2018 Sri Suharti et al.

AB  - Relatively previous researches on Leucaena Leucocephala (L.leucocephala) were undergone by using traditional method such as hydro-distillation and soxhlet extraction methods which have their own disadvantages such as long extraction time and non-solvent free oil extract. Thus, a clean extraction method of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) method using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) with ethanol as co-solvent was proposed for the extraction of L.leucocephala pods to produce oil with pharmaceutical components. The SC-CO2 extraction of L.leucocephala was studied by using measurement of yield of oil extracted and component identification. The extraction was conducted at constant CO2 flowrate of 24mL/min and constant ethanol flowrate of 2.4mL/min at extraction time of 60 minutes within a range of temperature (40°C, 50°C and 60°C) and range of pressure (3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000 psi). The component in L.leucocephala oil with the highest oil yield was determined using Gas Chromotography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The highest extraction oil yield of 4.92% (g oil/ g sample) was obtained at pressure 6000 psi and temperature 60°C. The component in the oil extract with the highest oil yield was determined based on the major components identified comprised of pentanoic acid, phosphonic acid, ecgonine, oleic acid and octadecadienoic acid. © 2018 Authors.

AB  - Potential vegetation in a small island ecologically plays an important role towards life sustainability of wild animals in the island. To find out the compositions, structures, and benefits of vegetation in forest ecosystem of small islands, a vegetation analysis was needed. The result of analysis was beneficial, helping to find out the condition of forest community balance, as well as to explain the interactions inside and between species. Vegetation observation was needed in Utilization and Protection block in Ontoloe Island, from littoral to terrestrial until the center of the island. A combination of Judgemental and Systematic Random Sampling was applied to determine the research sites in 2 blocks. In the Utilization block, 3 sites were identified, while in the Protection block, other 4 sites were determined. The distance of each site was 100 meters. In every site, there were 3 replicas at a distance of 50 meters. The vegetation data obtained was analyzed the Importance Value Index (IVI). The result of the research based of IVI obtained showed that Leucaena leucocephala dominated the tree, pole, and stake levels, Imperata cylindrica dominated in seddling level, whereas Rhizphora mucronata dominated the littoral area. The domination of invasive species of Leucaena leucocephala and Imperata cylindrica has threatened and reduced the vegetation diversity in Ontoloe Island. Biological controlling both 2 species could be used by introducing ruminant animals such as timor deer (Cervus timorensis), which in turn would conserve the ancient Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis Ouwens, 1912) in Ontoloe Island, by providing enough feeds of Timor deer for komodo. © 2018 Universitatea "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" din Iasi.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted in a split plot design at the research farm of ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi during summer and kharif seasons of 2015 and 2016 to study the influence of in-situ and ex-situ green manuring and zinc fertilization on nutrient uptake, yield attributes, correlation between yield and yield attributes, and yield of Basmati rice (Oryza sativa L.). Results of this study revealed that the incorporation of Sesbania aculeata green manure @ 33.8 and 35.6 t/ha prior to transplanting of Basmati rice during 2015 and 2016, respectively resulted in higher yield attributes and yield of Basmati rice compared with Vigna umbellata, Leucaena leucocephala and summer fallow during both the years. Foliar application of 0.5% solution of chelated Zn-EDTA at 20, 40, 60 and 80 days after transplanting (DAT) was better than soil application of Zn with regard to yield attributes and yield of Basmati rice and uptake of nutrients by the crop. In general, there was significant and positive correlation of grain yield with yield attributes. The uptake of nutrients by the crop was highest with incorporation of Sesbania aculeata and lowest in summer fallow. © 2018 Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Eight forages of tannin sources(Leucaena leucocephala, Arachis hypogaea, Mimosa pudica, Morus alba L, Swietenia mahagoni, Manihot esculenta, Gliricidia sepium, and Bauhinia purpurea)were evaluated their tannin content and protein binding capacity. The protein binding capacity of tannin were determined using precipitation of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Swietenia mahagonihas higest total tannin level and condensed tannin (CT) compared with other forages (P<0.01). The Leucaena leucocephala has highest hydrolysable tannin (HT) level (P<0.01). The total and condensed tannin content of Swietenia mahagoni were 11.928±0.04 mg/100 mg and 9.241±0.02mg/100mg dry matter (DM) of leaves. The hydrolysable tannin content of Leucaena leucocephala was 5.338±0.03 mg/100 mg DM of leaves. Binding capacity was highest in Swietenia mahagoni and Leucaena leucocephala compared to the other forages (P<0.01). The optimum binding of BSA to tannin in Leucaena leucocephala and Swietenia mahagoniwere1.181±0.44 and 1.217±0.60mg/mg dry matter of leaves. The present study reports that Swietenia mahagoni has highest of tannin content and Leucaena leucocephala and Swietenia mahagoni capacity of protein binding. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.
