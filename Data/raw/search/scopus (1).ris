AB  - Aims: To evaluate the effects of condensed tannins (CTs) fractions of differing molecular weights (MWs) from a Leucaena leucocephala hybrid-Rendang on the rumen protozoal community in vitro. Methods and Results: The effects of unfractionated CTs (F0) and CT fractions of different MWs (F1 > F2 > F3 > F4 > F5) on protozoal population and community were evaluated in vitro using rumen microbes and ground guinea grass as the substrate. Higher-MW CT fractions F1 and F2 significantly (P < 0·05) decrease the number of ciliate protozoa. The real-time PCR analysis showed that the total protozoa was significantly (P < 0·05) lower in F0 and all CTs with fractions F1 and F2 having the lowest value. High-throughput sequencing of the partial 18S rRNA gene showed that the genus Entodinium significantly (P < 0·05) decreased with increasing MWs of CT, whereas Anoplodinium-Diplodinium were significantly (P < 0·05) increased. Inclusion of the highest MW CT fraction F1 decreased the relative abundance of the minor genera such as Eudiplodinium and Polyplastron compared to the control and CT fractions F2–F5. Conclusion: CTs of differing MWs could reduce and alter the rumen protozoa population in vitro. This effect was more pronounced for higher-MW CTs. Significance and Impact of the Study: The high MW CTs should be considered as a feed supplement in the ruminant diet to reduce the protozoal population which are known to be associated with methanogens as a means to mitigate methane production in the rumen. © 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - Durability is a long-standing challenge in designing liquid-repellent surfaces. A high-performance omniphobic surface must robustly repel liquids, while maintaining mechanical/chemical stability. However, liquid repellency and mechanical durability are generally mutually exclusive properties for many omniphobic surfaces - improving one performance inevitably results in decreased performance in another. Here we report well-defined porous membranes for durable omniphobic surfaces inspired by the springtail cuticle. The omniphobicity is shown via an amphiphilic material micro-textured with re-entrant surface morphology; the mechanical durability arises from the interconnected microstructures. The innovative fabrication method - termed microfluidic emulsion templating - is facile, cost-effective, scalable and can precisely engineer the structural topographies. The robust omniphobic surface is expected to open up new avenues for diverse applications due to its mechanical and chemical robustness, transparency, reversible Cassie-Wenzel transition, transferability, flexibility and stretchability. © The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - Effects of selected Palestinian plants on the in vitro exsheathment of the third stage larvae of gastrointestinal nematodes
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032743411&doi=10.1186%2fs12917-017-1237-7&partnerID=40&md5=5718cd4910e69566b7577331a7d9be74
AB  - Background: Gastrointestinal parasites are one of the main restrictions to small ruminant production. Their pathological importance is primarily related to the major production losses, in quantity or quality, induced by the direct action of worms. Control of these parasites is based exclusively on the frequent use of anthelmintic drugs. However, the resistance to anthelmintics in worm populations after commercialisation of chemical drugs is now widespread. Therefore, there is a need to find new natural resources to ensure sustainable and effective treatment and control of these parasites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anthelmintic activity, as minimum inhibitory concentration (IC  50  mg/mL), of different plant extracts using larval exsheathment inhibition assay using a two-species but steady population of parasitic nematodes (ca. 20% Teladorsagia circumcinta and 80% Trichostrongylus colubriformis). Results: The study showed that the ethanolic extracts of 22 out of the 48 plant extracts, obtained from 46 plant species, have an inhibitory effect >50% (at concentrations of 100 mg/mL) on the third stage larvae (L3) of the nematodes exhibited the strongest inhibition activity (94%) with IC  50  of 0.02 mg/mL, where other members of the Rhamnaceae family have shown to possess strong anthelmintic activity (70-89%). Conclusions: Plant extracts are potential rich resources of anthelmintics to combat helminthic diseases. Our results suggest that extracts from Rhamnus elaternus, Epilobium hirsutum, Leucaena leucocephala and Rhamnus palaestinus have promising anthelmintic activity, with potential applications in animal therapeutics and feed. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The research was conducted (i) to evaluate the effect of application of organic fertilizer in saline soil on forage production of Panicum maximum and Sesbania grandiflora; and (ii) to evaluate the use of Panicum maximum and Sesbania grandiflora foliage for growing goats. The study was conducted during the dry season (June – October 2016) in saline soil (EC = 4.1 dS/m) in Kaliori sub-district area, Rembang Regency, Central Java Province, Indonesia. Experiment 1 was to measure production of P. maximum and S. grandiflora at different dosages of organic fertilizer (0, 10 tonnes/ha and 20 tonnes/ha) planted solely or inter planted. Experiment 2 was the use of the forages for growing goats: native grass and Leucaena leucocephala (80 % : 20%) and P. maximum and S. grandiflora (80% : 20% and 60% : 40%). Organic fertilizer (cow dung) application on saline soil increased dry matter production of P. maximum and S. grandiflora planted solely or inter-planted. There were increases in DM intake of 60%, in live weight gain of 100%, and improvements in DM feed conversion of 23%, for combinations of P. maximum : S. grandiflora (80 : 20) and (60 : 40) compared with Native grass : L. leucocephala (80 : 20). © 2017 Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - The factors that limit maize production in Yucatán, México are decreasing yields and a constant increase of weedy species. A strategy to deal with these problems is to develop diversified productive schemes, such as agroforestry systems (SAF). This study determined the cover dynamics and biomass of weeds in an SAF composed of forage trees and maize during two cropping cycles (CC). Leucaena leucocephala, Guazuma ulmifolia, and Moringa oleifera, associated with maize, and a plot of maize monocrop were evaluated with a complete random block design with three replications. Weed cover, biomass, diversity and density were measured at the beginning, middle and end of the two CC. The weeds were collected in squares delimited by 50×50 cm frames distributed randomly in each experimental unit, separated by species and dried. With this data, an ANOVA was performed, and when significance was detected, the Tukey test (p≤0.05) was used. At the beginning of the first CC, the SAF Guazuma + maize had lower weed cover (41 %), while Moringa + maize was higher at the middle and end (71 and 49 %). At the beginning of the second CC, the Guazuma + maize SAF had less weed cover, and Guazuma + maize and Leucaena + maize were lower (54 and 48 %). In both CC, weed biomass in the SAF was almost half that of monocropped maize. At the end of both CC, the Guazuma + maize system had less weed diversity than the maize monocrop. At the beginning and end of the two CC, weed density was greater in the monocrop. Eighteen botanical families were identified and, of these, 21 % were leguminous. The suppression of weeds in the SAF was 23 to 36 %. Woody species in SAF reduce weed cover and biomass, relative to maize monocrop.

TI  - The Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 NodD2 protein regulates the production of Nod factors under salt stress in a flavonoid-independent manner
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019064909&doi=10.1038%2fsrep46712&partnerID=40&md5=d55ffa6aeb38bb346f101b747c3a6cc3
AB  - In the symbiotic associations between rhizobia and legumes, NodD promotes the expression of the nodulation genes in the presence of appropriate flavonoids. This set of genes is implied in the synthesis of Nodulation factors, which are responsible for launching the nodulation process. Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 is the most successful symbiont of Phaseolus vulgaris and can nodulate a variety of legumes. This strain produces Nodulation factors under abiotic stress such as acidity or high concentration of salt. Genome sequencing of CIAT 899 allowed the identification of five nodD genes. Whereas NodD1 is essential to nodulate Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus japonicus and Macroptilium atropurpureum, symbiosis with P. vulgaris and Lotus burtii decreased the nodule number but did not abolish the symbiotic process when NodD1 is absent. Nodulation factor synthesis under salt stress is not regulated by NodD1. Here we confirmed that NodD2 is responsible for the activation of the CIAT 899 symbiotic genes under salt stress. We have demonstrated that NodD1 and NodD2 control the synthesis of the Nod factor necessary for a successful symbiosis with P. vulgaris and L. burtii. This is the first time that NodD is directly implied in the activation of the symbiotic genes under an abiotic stress. © Author(s) 2017.

TI  - Utilization of Moringa oleifera Lam. in animal production

UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019935951&doi=10.17660%2fActaHortic.2017.1158.54&partnerID=40&md5=f69d1a48e5220750e3c8ef995d697226
AB  - Moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam.) is commonly known to Filipinos as "Malunggay". This tree is abundant in the rural areas, and is a rich source of digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, which are essential components of animal feeds. Thus, it has great potential as feed resource, especially for livestock and poultry smallholder farmers. Using livestock and poultry species, feeding experiments were conducted to determine the effects of moringa on the growth performance of goats and broiler chickens; and on the laying performance of chickens and quails and on the quality of their eggs. A grass-legume (60:40) diet consisting of para grass (Brachiaria mutica) in combination with either moringa or Ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala) or katuray (Sesbania grandiflora) were fed to goats for 60 days. Dry matter intake was measured daily, while the body weight (BW) was measured monthly. Dry matter intake was higher in goats fed with para grass and moringa (P<0.05), which resulted in higher weight gains (P<0.05). In other experiments, moringa leaves and seeds in different preparations, i.e., fresh, extract and meals were investigated in poultry. Effects on egg production, egg weight, and percentage of broken eggs, yolk color and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were assessed in quail and layer chickens, while the influence on live weight and return on income were evaluated in broiler chickens. Egg production was higher, while egg weight was heavier, yolk color was darker and the FCR was better in layer quail supplemented with 5% moringa leaf meal (All, P<0.05) as well as in White Leghorns provided with 100 mL moringa leaves extract added L-1 of water (P<0.05). On the other hand, the supplementation of moringa seed meal in the diet of Babcock layers reduced the percentage of broken eggs (0.017 vs. 0.032; P<0.05). Meanwhile, the ad libitum feeding of fresh moringa leaves to broiler chickens, did not affect body weight gain; however, the net income per bird increased by 6 Philippine pesos. Based on the findings, moringa leaves and seeds can be used as a supplement in the diet of livestock, layers and broilers because it increased production performance and income, and improved the quality of eggs produced.

TI  - Phytoremediation potential of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. for heavy metal-polluted and heavy metal-degraded environments
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035049813&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-10-3084-0_7&partnerID=40&md5=8b4d337e677090a98a498baf9e0e3255
AB  - Regeneration of heavy metal-polluted and heavy metal-degraded sites has remained a global challenge despite the existence of numerous conventional physico-chemical techniques that can be applied. In view of the large size of the degraded areas and the cost implications, the application of the inexpensive “green” and sustainable technique of phytoremediation is unrivalled by any other possible alternative techniques. However, its effectiveness is largely dependent on judicious selection of the plant to be used. We thus assessed the suitability of Leucaena leucocephala for phytoremediation of heavy metal-polluted and heavy metal-degraded sites. L. leucocephala has numerous inherent characteristics that can be exploited to augment phytoremediation and lower the cost of regeneration. The species can survive in harsh environmental conditions with the exception of heavily frosted conditions and occurs in a wide range of ecological settings. The species is fast growing, capable of reaching maturity in 6 to 7 months to produce a vast amount of seeds that can germinate into numerous seedlings to carry on further remediation of the polluted site. It can produce large quantities of phytomass that can accumulate heavy metals and can repeatedly be harvested to regenerate a polluted area through phytoextraction. Heavy metal-laden phytomass of L. leucocephala moulds into furniture and is used for construction to preclude contamination at the site of use. It is excellent on coppicing, thus eliminating the costs of replanting during the phytoremediation programme. The species is endowed with high proficiency for nitrogen fixation through nodule formation and can substantially revitalize microbial mass and micro-bioactivities to pave way for re-establishment of self-sustaining plant communities over the polluted sites. Its flexibility to nodulate with rhizobia of other legumes and its rhizobia to nodulate with other legumes could optimize nitrogen content revitalization of the polluted soils. However, the species is invasive and could be adopted under stringent measures to avoid its spread. It is also very palatable to animals and may thus be of limited application in the phytoremediation of areas accessible to animals. Suitability of the species in heavily polluted areas is minimal as many of the inherent characteristics may not fully be expressed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

TI  - Replacement of alfalfa hay (Medicago sativa L.) with subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf meal in diets of Najdi goats: effect on digestion activity of rumen microorganisms
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020734088&doi=10.1007%2fs11250-017-1330-8&partnerID=40&md5=64dd1a624318566563367fa4938f2dfd
AB  - This study investigated the effect of replacing alfalfa hay by subabul leaf meal (SLM) on digestion, fermentation parameters and rumen bacteria and fungi activity of Najdi goats. Six Najdi goats (150 ± 15 days of age and initial body weight of 35 ± 1.1 kg) were randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatments in a balanced completely randomized design (three goats per treatment) for 56 days. Experimental treatments included alfalfa hay as control group and diet containing SLM (SLM replacing alfalfa hay at 50% level). Bacterial and fungi activity and rumen fermentation parameters of animals fed experimental diets were determined. Dry matter disappearance (DMD) was unaffected by replacing SLM with alfalfa hay for both rumen bacteria and fungi in different incubation times, except for 48 h of incubation in specific culture medium of mixed rumen bacteria, which decreased for SLM group (P > 0.05). NDF disappearance (NDFD) and ADF disappearance (ADFD) after 24 and 48 h of incubation in specific culture medium of mixed rumen bacteria was not affected by experimental diets (P > 0.05). However, 72 h after incubation, NDFD in SLM treatment decreased (P > 0.05). Gas production parameters of rumen bacteria were similar for both experimental diets, but partitioning factor (PF), efficiency microbial biomass production (EMBP), microbial protein production (MP), and organic matter truly digested (OMTD) decreased (p < 0.05) in specific culture medium of mixed rumen fungi for SLM diet. There was significant decrease in total protozoa population for diet containing SLM (p < 0.05). Results indicated that replacement of alfalfa hay by SLM had no major effect on rumen microorganisms’ activity of Najdi goats, so it may be used as an alternative for alfalfa (at 50% level) in susceptible areas. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Flood tolerance of Glyceria fluitans: The importance of cuticle hydrophobicity, permeability and leaf gas films for underwater gas exchange
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032460938&doi=10.1093%2faob%2fmcx083&partnerID=40&md5=c8a1ba42ad68ea3cfd9a89f5add38fa4
AB  - Background and Aims Floating sweet-grass (Glyceria fluitans) can form aerial as well as floating leaves, and these both possess superhydrophobic cuticles, so that gas films are retained when submerged. However, only the adaxial side of the floating leaves is superhydrophobic, so the abaxial side is directly in contact with the water. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of these different gas films on underwater net photosynthesis (PN) and dark respiration (RD). Methods Evolution of O2 was used to measure underwater PN in relation to dissolved CO2 on leaf segments with or without gas films, and O2 microelectrodes were used to assess cuticle resistance of floating leaves to O2 uptake in the dark. Key Results The adaxial side of aerial leaves was more hydrophobic than the abaxial side and also initially retained a thicker gas film when submerged. Underwater PN vs. dissolved CO2 of aerial leaf segments with gas films had a Km of 172 mmol CO2 m-3 and a Pmax of 7-1 lmol O2 m-2 s-1, and the leaf gas films reduced the apparent resistance to CO2 uptake 12-fold. Underwater PN of floating leaves measured at 700 mmol CO2 m-3 was 1-5-fold higher than PN of aerial leaves. The floating leaves had significantly lower cuticle resistance to dark O2 uptake on the wettable abaxial side compared with the superhydrophobic adaxial side. Conclusions Glyceria fluitans showed high rates of underwater PN and these were obtained at environmentally relevant CO2 concentrations. It appears that the floating leaves possess both aquatic and terrestrial properties and thus have 'the best of both worlds' so that floating leaves are particularly adapted to situations where the plant is partially submerged and occasionally experiences complete submergence. © The Author 2017.

TI  - Silicone based superhydrophobic coating efficient to reduce ice adhesion and accumulation on aluminum under offshore arctic conditions
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033402961&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2017.08.022&partnerID=40&md5=99191189e492b9eb886396d3cd731988
AB  - A cost-effective superhydrophobic coating has been developed by chemical etching and spray coating of a commercially available co-polymeric silicone, composition of which was confirmed by Infrared. Morphological studies by scanning electron microscope show a micro-nano rough pattern that increased with the wt.% content of the sprayed silicone film after drying. At an optimum 5 wt.% of silicone, contact angle reached a maximum of 154 ± 2° for which value a roughness Rrms of 2.7 ± 0.2 μm was measured. This superhydrophobic coating gave interesting icephobic properties. Ice adhesion measured by centrifuge testing were up to 12 times lower, as compared to bare aluminum. In addition ice accumulation tests performed under two kinds of laboratories frozen sea spray, the first named white cap spray (WCS) and the second interaction spray (IS) show that the mass of ice over the best optimized superhydrophobic coating is reduced by 5% and 45%, respectively. Those reductions in ice adhesion and accumulation can be interpreted, according to Cassie-Baxter's model, by an air fraction of 85% entrapped at the superhydrophobic interface. This cost-effective superhydrophobic coating is looking promising for offshore applications under Arctic icing conditions, as it reduces ice adhesion and accumulation on metal structures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of solid organic fertilizer in closed agricultural production system must be combined with foliar application to improve fertilizing effectiveness. Nutrient contents in tissues of green biomass determine the quality of liquid organic fertilizer. Six potential green biomasses, Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) A. Gray, Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp., Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit, Ageratum conyzoides L., Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, and banana corms were identified its nutrient contents. Samples were dried at 60°C for 48 hours, grinded, analyzed for N, P, K, Ca-ex, Mg-ex, C, cellulose and lignin contents. Results indicated that T. diversifolia and A. conyzoides had the highest N content compared to other biomasses. A. conyzoides had the highest P content, followed by T. diversifolia. A. conyzoides had the highest K content, followed by G. sepium. The highest Ca-ex content was in L. leucocephala, followed by A. conyzoides. The highest Mg-ex content was found in A. conyzoides, followed by L. leucocephala. The highest C content was found in E.crassipes, followed by G. Sepium. T. diversifolia had the highest cellulose content, followed by E.crassipes. Lignin content of all biomasses was similar. Lastly, E.crassipes had the highest C/N compared to other biomass, and both T. diversifolia and A. conyzoides had the lowest C/N. It is concluded that A. conyzoides is the most promising green biomass for production of liquid organic fertilizer, followed by T. diversifolia and G. sepium.

AB  - The objective of this research is to assess the growth and physiological characteristics of lettuce in the delivery of different N-organics. Research was conducted at Faculty of Animal and Agricultural Sciences, Diponegoro University, Indonesia. The materials used were seeds of lettuce (Lettuce sativa L) on Oxisol soil types, with the total N content of 0.18 %, P (18 mg. g-1), K (23 mg. g-1) and C (1.52 %) were utilized. The organic fertilizers applied were cow-, sheep-, and guano manures, and compost and green manure (Leucaena leucocephala). The experimental design was a randomized block design with four replications and five treatments. The treatment dose of fertilizer applied is equivalent to 100 kg N/ha, namely: cow-manure; sheep-manure; guano manure; compost and green manure. Green manure, set into the ground is Leucaena leucocephala. The variables measured were the number of leaves, leaf area, leaf area index(LAI), the rate of photosynthesis, Chlorophyll total, anti-oxidant activity, fresh weight of lettuce per plot. The data obtained were analyzed using an ANOVA followed by the Duncan test. Guano fertilizer provided the most excellent effect on leaves, LAI, the rate of photosynthesis and biomass lettuce. Fertilizers derived from animal manure (guano, cattle, goats) gave a more excellent effect on the rate of photosynthesis of plants. Compost origin gave the lowest effect on leaf area, LAI, and the rate of photosynthesis. The number of leaves, total chlorophyll, and antioxidant content were not influenced by the different organic N fertilizers. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of feed restriction on intake of Moringa oleifera and Leucaena leucocephala and growth performance of rabbits
PY  - 2017

AB  - Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of feed restriction on intake of Moringa oleifera (MO) or Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and growth of rabbits. In experiment one, 45 rabbits (male and female) weighing 1.18 ± 0.15 kg were used. They were randomly distributed to three feed restriction treatments (20, 30, and 40%) with 15 rabbits each (9 females and 6 males) and they were offered M. oleifera (MO) ad libitum. In experiment two, 45 growing male rabbits weighing 0.63 ± 0.113 kg were used. They were randomly assigned to 0, 20, and 30% feed restriction diets, and they have free access to L. leucocephala (LL). Intake of MO increased (P < 0.05) conforming feed restriction increased (40.6, 52.9, and 55.2 g/day of MO for 20, 30, and 40%, respectively). Daily liveweight gain and feed conversion did not differ (P > 0.05), and economic efficiency was similar among treatments. Consumption of LL increased (P < 0.05) in rabbits under the 30% restriction treatment in comparison to that of rabbits restricted 20% (46.0 and 44.4 g/day, respectively). Total feed intake (LL + feed) was highest in 20% restricted rabbits (108.0, 100.8, and 93.2 g/day for 20, 30, and 0%, respectively). Daily liveweight gain and feed conversion were not affected by feed restriction (P > 0.05). Economic efficiency improved twice in feed-restricted rabbits (2.0 and 2.3 for 20 and 30%, respectively) in contrast to that of the control 0% group (1.1). The results suggest that rabbits restricted up to 30% and supplemented with either MO or LL did not affect growth performance and reduced feed cost. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Shoot and root responses of woody species to silvicultural management for afforestation of degraded croplands in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Benin
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85003955349&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2016.11.018&partnerID=40&md5=6519c83fdbf002d2a807e4fb77f34063
AB  - In the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa, where deforestation and cropland soil degradation occur at alarming rates, the (re-)introduction of trees on degraded lands can improve and sustain farming systems and landscapes. The shoot and root morphological traits of five woody species introduced to degraded cropland were assessed with a particular focus on the survival, early establishment and growth of saplings subjected to manuring (1 kg per plant) and drip irrigation (0.5 L of water per plant per day). Functional traits of the woody above- and belowground organs of field-grown plants were monitored for the first 15 months after planting, covering two growing (rainy) seasons and one dry season. The high survival rate (>60%), combined with a very low incidence rate (<1%), for all species was evidence of successful establishment overall. The highest survival rates (94–100%) were observed in Jatropha curcas L., Leucaena leucocephala Lam. and Moringa oleifera Lam. The mortality rate of the most drought-sensitive species Parkia biglobosa Jacq. could be reduced ten-fold through supplemental irrigation during the dry season. The fast-growing L. leucocephala, M. oleifera and J. curcas had higher values for shoot-level traits than did the slow-growing Anacardium occidentale L. and P. biglobosa. Fertilization and irrigation enhanced the shoot growth of both the fast and slow growers during the dry and growing seasons. In contrast, belowground development was either increased or reduced by fertilization and irrigation during the growing and dry seasons, but the slow growers demonstrated a more plastic response to these treatments than did the fast growers. Among the studied traits, the relative growth rate of plant as a whole (i.e. shoots and roots combined) exhibited the greatest plastic response to resource availability, thus suggesting its application in screening candidate species for afforestation efforts. Overall, the five studied species were considered suitable for the afforestation of degraded croplands, while the early growth and establishment of saplings could be boosted by irrigation and a supply of manure. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research was carried out with the objective to evaluate the effect of including the biological product VITAFERT® (VTF), as microbial additives in the cattle fattened in silvopastoral system with Leucaena leucocephala supplemented with 6 g MS.kg PV-1 of sugar cane. Fifteen animals Zebu cross by trial were used during 165 days of rainy period. The treatments were: 1) grazing ad libitum + sugar cane, 2) grazing ad libitum + sugar cane + 6 mL.kg PV-1 VTF and 3) grazing ad libitum + sugar cane + 9 mL.kg PV-1 VTF. A random regression models were applied starting from a PROC MIXED, a trial were included as fixed effect and the animal nested inside treatment as aleatory effect and the residual error. Growth models of weight x age were used. Several indicators of the productive performance were determined. There were difference (P > 0.001) for the daily half gain (GMD) in the treatments with inclusion of the VTF regarding the control. Also, there was difference (P > 0.001) in the increment of live (IP) and the hectare yield in the treatments where VTF was given with relationship to the control. The non-lineal model (Logistic) showed adequate adjusted for the first and second treatment. However, the lineal model presented appropriate adjusted in the third treatment. It is concludes that the use of the VTF as microbial additives in the fattened of beef cattle in silvopastoral systems with leucaena, complemented with sugar cane generated a productive effect contrasting on the GMD, the IP and the hectare yield in the treatments where VTF was given.

AB  - Bruchine beetles are highly host-specific seed feeders during the larval stage. Although some specific parasitoid families have been recorded attacking bruchine beetles, most studies have been done at small spatial scales. Therefore, the current knowledge about the diversity and the geographic distribution of parasitoid species parasitizing bruchines is scarce, especially at a wide geographic area that extends over large distances through a latitudinal cline (i.e. large-scale spatial structure). The present study determined the species richness and evenness of parasitoids attacking the bruchine beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus feeding on Leucaena leucocephala seeds, examined their geographic distribution, and characterized the large-scale spatial structure in parasitoid species composition. A total of 1420 parasitoids (all Hymenoptera) belonging to four families, five subfamilies and eight species were collected (genera: Horismenus, Paracrias, Urosigalphus, Stenocorse, Chryseida, Eupelmus). Most parasitoid species showed wide spatial distribution, high evenness in species abundance and the species richness estimators were close to stabilization (approximately eight species). Overall, greater similarity was observed in the species composition of plant populations near to each other than those farther apart, revealing a large-scale spatial structure in parasitoid species composition.

AB  - Two contour hedgerow (Gliricidiasepium and Leucaena leucocephala) systems with and without miniature trenches were evaluated as conservation measures in the shifting cultivated degraded Eastern Ghats Highlands of Odisha, India. Staggered planting of hedgerows at 0.5 × 0.5 m spacing in two parallel lines with miniature trenches (0.3 m width and 0.3 m depth) in between two lines were laid out across 5 and 10 % slopes. The treatment Gliricidia + miniature trench (G+MT) reduced runoff by 23.3–32.5 %, soil loss by 49.5–52.7 %, loss of soil organic carbon (SOC), N, P, and K by 44.1–47.6, 61.5–62.2, 54.8–58.1, and 53.1–56.3 %, respectively, over no conservation treatment (control), whereas the same for the treatment Leucaena + miniature trench (L+MT) was 18.6–18.9, 42.4–43.7, 30.9–40.2, 41.9–56.3, 47.3–47.9, and 38.5–47.8 %, respectively, over control. Within 0–20 cm soil profile, G+MT sequestered 1.62 Mg ha−1 year−1 SOC, of which 0.93 Mg ha−1 year−1 was sequestered due to soil reclamation and 0.69 Mg ha−1 year−1 was retained due to the barrier effect, whereas L+MT sequestered 1.21 Mg ha−1 year−1 SOC. The trench treatments with Gliricidia and Leucaena hedgerows were 3.8–4.7 and 3.7–5.3 % more efficient to stock SOC within 40 cm soil profile than no trench treatment. The decrease of SOC stock by 40–102 kg ha−1 year−1 in the control plots from the initial level indicated the ongoing erosion process in unprotected lands. The findings will help to promote hedgerow based agroforestry for resource conservation and improved SOC sequestration in sloping lands. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Seed yield and quality enhancement of pollarded subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) by nutrient supplementation
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978062668&doi=10.1007%2fs10457-016-9984-1&partnerID=40&md5=bcdc068047b3d50e9280f6d3d38c5d83
AB  - Agroforestry species Leucaena leucocephala (subabul), a multipurpose leguminous tree, is one of the most suitable species for silvipasture system. Its seeds, a good protein source to livestock, also have lot of industrial application. Subabul responds well to pollarding, a practice that helps growth of understory crops but reduces seed yield of main tree species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nutrient application on fruit and seed characters, seed yield, germination and vigour of pollarded subabul trees. The study was conducted on three important salvodar type subabul varieties (K8, K636 and S24) with different fruit and seed characters. Three nutrient mixtures (SSP @ 150 kg/ha + ZnSO4 @ 20 kg/ha; CuSO4 @ 0.25 % + Borax @ 0.15 % + KNO3 @ 1 % in 500 l spray volume per ha and KNO3 @ 4 kg/ha) were applied before anthesis. The nutrient treatments have enhanced fruit length and weight without affecting the fruit width. Similarly, seed characters responded positively to nutrient applications resulting in enhanced mean yield across varieties and years. The seed viability measured as germination percentage varied among varieties with maximum viability in small-seeded K 636. The application of nutrients enhanced the germination and vigour in all three varieties irrespective of the seed size. Among the nutrient mixtures, potassium nitrate @ 4 kg/ha has better effect on seed yield and its attributing characters as well as on seed quality across the varieties over the years. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Plants respond to wounding caused by mechanical stress or herbivory by synthesizing defense proteins. There are no studies reporting the action of induced plant proteins against ticks. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mechanically wounded Leucaena leucocephala leaves against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. Initially, we carried out time course experiments to evaluate the impact of mechanical wounding on the protein content and the peroxidase, catalase and protease inhibitor activities in L. leucocephala. We then evaluated the acaricidal activity on R. (B.) microplus from protein extract collected from L. leucocephala after mechanical wounding. L. leucocephala leaves were artificially wounded, and after 6, 12, 24 and 48h, the leaves were collected for protein extraction. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proteins were performed. The protein content and peroxidase and protease activities increased 12h after wounding, and the acaricidal activity of this protein extract was evaluated using engorged R. (B.) microplus females. The protein extract obtained after wounding reduced egg production (8.5%) compared to those without wounding. Furthermore, the extract reduced egg hatching by 47.7% and showed an overall efficacy of 56.3% at 0.1 mgP/mL of the protein. We demonstrated that L. leucocephala defensive proteins could be effective against R. (B.) microplus. © 2017 Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology. All rights reserved.

TI  - Is there a negative association between the content of condensed tannins, total phenols, and total tannins of tropical plant extracts and in vitro anthelmintic activity against Haemonchus contortus eggs?
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031757624&doi=10.1007%2fs00436-017-5650-4&partnerID=40&md5=d9b863e13ec842c98a05d96c81831bf5
AB  - In vitro studies using plant extracts suggest a relationship between their polyphenol contents and their anthelmintic (AH) activity against Haemonchus contortus. High polyphenol content appears to increase the efficacy of plant extracts against H. contortus as assessed by the larval exsheathment inhibition assay (LEIA) while appearing to reduce the AH efficacy measured using the egg hatch assay (EHA). In addition, some plants lack AH activity. Therefore, the present study investigated the relationship between the contents of condensed tannins (CT), total phenols (TP), and total tannins (TT) in methanol:water extracts (70:30) obtained from ten tropical plant species consumed by small ruminants as well as their AH activity against H. contortus evaluated by LEIA and EHA. Extracts of Acacia collinsii, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Havardia albicans, Senegalia gaumeri, Mimosa bahamensis, Piscidia piscipula, Acacia pennatula, Gymnopodium floribundum, Leucaena leucocephala, and Bunchosia swartziana were examined. Positive correlations were found between the effective concentration 50% (EC50) (EHA) of extracts and their CT (r = 0.6809, P < 0.05, n = 10) and TP (r = 0.9152, P < 0.05, n = 10) content, suggesting that their concentration negatively affected AH activity against eggs. Based on the LEIA, there was no significant association between the EC50 and the CT, TP, or TT of all extracts evaluated. Thus, if sheep and goats consume a complex feed mixture with high amounts of CT, TP, and TT, it might be difficult to observe an AH effect against H. contortus egg hatching. However, the AH effect upon L3 establishment might be feasible. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - This study measured forage biomass production, diet quality, cattle liveweight gain, and economic performance of six forage types at 21 sites across 12 commercial beef cattle properties in the Fitzroy River catchment of Queensland during 2011-2014 (28 annual datasets in total). The forages were annual forage crops (oats (Avena sativa), sorghum (Sorghum spp.) and lablab (Lablab purpureus)), sown perennial legume-grass pastures (leucaena-grass (Leucaena leucocephala spp. glabrata + perennial, tropical grass (C4) species) and butterfly pea-grass (Clitoria ternatea + perennial, C4, grass species)), and perennial, C4, grass pastures. The sown forages resulted in 1.2-2.6 times the annual cattle liveweight gain per ha than perennial grass pastures. Annual cattle liveweight gain per ha, forage establishment and management costs, and cattle price margin (sale price less purchase price, $/kg liveweight) all influenced gross margin, however, none was an overriding factor. The average gross margins ($/ha.annum) calculated using contractor rates, ranked from highest to lowest, were: leucaena-grass pastures, 181; butterfly pea-grass pastures, 140; oats, 102; perennial grass, 96; sorghum, 24; and lablab, 18. It was concluded that the tendency towards greater average gross margins for perennial legume-grass pastures than for annual forage crops or perennial grass pastures was the result of the combined effects of lower average forage costs and high cattle productivity. © CSIRO 2018.

AB  - Leucaena Leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Petai Belalang) is a medium plant which belong in group of tropical breed that can survived in hot, dried and warm environment. In Malaysia, the plant is available abundantly. As there are still no commercial used, and no serious intention in finding the benefits of L. Leucocephala, this work come out with the idea to analyze the antioxidants contains in leaves of the plant by undergoes different extraction and chemical testing method. The phytochemical screening assay involved in this study are antioxidant activity by using free radical diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, total phenolic content by using Folin-Ciocalteu method, total flavonoid content by using colorimetric assay with ascorbic acid and quercetin were used as reference standards while for phosphorus analysis, a molybdenum blue method or also known as ascorbic acid method was used. For antioxidant activity by using free radical diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, higher concentration was recorded by extraction using methanol (dried sample) which is 8247.0 mg/L, for total phenolic content higher concentration was recorded by extraction using deionized water (dried sample) which is 4276.0 mg/L, for total flavonoid content by using colorimetric assay higher concentration was recorded by extraction using methanol (dried sample) which is 4439.0 mg/L, and for for phosphorus analysis higher concentration was recorded by extraction using methanol (dried sample) which is 71.057 mg/L. © 2017 Author(s).

AB  - Torrefaction, also known as mild pyrolysis, is proven to convert raw biomass into a value-added energy commodity particularly for application in combustion and co-firing systems with improved storage and handling properties. This paper aims to compare the characteristics of Malaysian bituminous coal i.e. Silantek coal with raw and torrefied biomass pellet originated from oil palm frond and fast growing tree species, Leucaena Leucocephala. Biomass samples were initially torrefied at 300 °C for 60 minutes. Resulting torrefied biomass pellets were analysed using a number of standard fuel characterisation analyses i.e. elemental analysis, proximate analysis and calorific content (high heating values) experiments. Investigations on combustion characteristics via dynamic thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), grindability and moisture uptake tests were also performed on the torrefied biomass pellets. Better quality bio-chars were produced as compared to its raw forms and with optimal process conditions, torrefaction may potentially produces a solid fuel with combustion reactivity and porosity equivalent to raw biomass while having compatible energy density and grindability to coal. © 2017 Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: A fundamental challenge to the integrity of tropical dry forest ecosystems is the invasion of non-native grass species. These grasses compete for resources and fuel anthropogenic wildfires. In 2012, a bulldozer from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority cleared a 570-m trail from a state road into a mature dry forest section of Guánica Forest to control a wildfire. We monitored colonization by a non-native invasive grass (Megathyrsus maximus), a highly invasive tree (Leucaena leucocephala), and a native grass (Uniola virgata), as well as natural regeneration, along the bulldozer trail. We determined whether bulldozing facilitated colonization by these species into the forest and the extent of spread. Results: Distance from propagule source and temporal variations strongly influenced colonization by our three focal species. Megathyrsus maximus invaded along the trail from source populations by the state road. The establishment of new colonies of M. maximus seedlings went as far as 570 m inside the forest (i.e., at the end of the bulldozer trail), but we found most new colonies within 270 m of the road. Leucaena leucocephala exhibited a similar spreading pattern. Before disturbance, Uniola virgata was distributed widely across the forest, but the highest densities were found in areas near the latter portion (> 401 m) of the bulldozer trail. Subsequently, the species formed new clumps along more than half of the trail (250 to 570 m), apparently colonizing from undisturbed patches nearby. Conclusions: Bulldozing facilitated the invasion of non-native vegetation. The projected community assemblage will be more fire-prone than before since M. maximus carries fire across the landscape better than U. virgata, emphasizing the capacity of invasive plant colonization to alter local ecological processes after only a single wildfire and bulldoze event. Our results provide a valuable baseline for short-term vegetation response to anthropogenic disturbances in tropical semi-deciduous dry forests. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Among main ways to provide an environmentally friendly energy and platform chemicals are the lignocellulosic conversion processes. The proper execution of this way will depend on the correct selection of lignocellulosic materials. A compelling plant is Leucaena leucocephala because its great variety of uses, its high biomass production and its leguminous nature. In this study, acid hydrolysis (130–170°C and 0.5–2% H2SO4, to extract valuable hemicelluloses) as pretreatment and pyrolysis of the solid residue (to get a gaseous fuel) as treatment have been used in its valorization. A laboratory-scale reactor was used for the pyrolysis experiments (550°C, N2) for both Leucaena leucocephala, as raw material, and the solid residues after hydrolysis process and raw material. The amounts of CO, CO2 and H2 found in the raw material are similar to those found in the solids obtained after the different studied hydrolysis conditions. Moreover, the thermal behavior of studied solids has been studied by thermogravimetric analysis under nitrogen atmosphere at different heating rates (5, 10, 15 and 20°C min−1). Activation energy for all samples has been obtained by the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method. The optimum value, in which a high relationship between recoverable hemicelluloses fraction and H2 concentration is found, under medium hydrolysis temperature (150°C) has been obtained and was independent of the amount of acid added to the hydrolysis process. © 2017

AB  - The pods of trees from tropical deciduous forest are relevant in the dry season due to their high availability. Whole pods from seven plant species Acacia pennatula (Schltdl. & Cham.) Benth., Caesalpinia gaumeri (Britton & Rose) Greenm., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Lysiloma latisiliquum (L.) Benth., Mimosa bahamensis Benth., Piscidia piscipula (L.) Sarg. and Senegalia gaumeri (S. F. Blake) Britton & Rose which are reported as consumed by small ruminants were evaluated. Their nutritional value, phenolic compounds, in vitro dry matter (IVDMD) and organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) and metabolizable energy (ME) with and without the inclusion of polyethylene glycol (PEG) were evaluated. The pods from P. piscipula showed the highest crude protein content. The pods of L. leucocephala, C. gaumeri, and A. pennatula resulted with the highest IVDMD (46.3 and 44.5%), IVOMD (44.8 and 45.4%) and ME (6.8 and 6.7 MJ) (P<0.05). The phenolic compounds were not detected in C. gaumeri, L. latisiliquum and S. gaumeri pods. The IVDMD, IVOMD and ME on pods of L latisiliquum and P. piscipula (P<0.05) was lower when PEG was added. Pods from A. pennatula, C. gaumeri and L. leucocephala showed acceptable nutritional value for their use as supplement for ruminants.

AB  - Different species of Xylaria are often reported as an endophyte in different groups of plants starting from liverworts to angiosperms. In the present study, Xylaria hypoxylon isolated from branch stubs of living trees was utilised for in vitro decay test to investigate the pattern of cell wall alterations in sound wood blocks of Azadirachta indica, Leucaena leucocephala, and Tectona grandis. Naturally infected as well as in vitro decayed wood showed cavities and erosion troughs at the lumen surface. In laboratory decay test, vertical invasion of mycelia occurred through the lateral wall pits of the vessels and vessel-associated parenchyma while ray cells enabled radial movement of mycelia. At the end of 60 days, the progression of degradation in the fibre cell wall was evident by the formation of transverse boreholes in the cell walls, erosion troughs at the lumen surface, and larger cavities in the S2 layer of secondary wall. The erosion channels were angular to round (i.e. V-shaped or U-shaped). Fungus was also tested for polyphenol oxidase (Bavandemm's test) production by on-plate assay and was found to be positive. Confocal microscopy revealed delignification pattern during degradation of cell wall of different cell types in all the three woody species. The SEM analysis of degraded wood showed the ultrastructural changes in the cell wall particularly penetration of hyphae through the S2 layer of the cell walls forming tunnels through it. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. (Fabaceae) is an arboreal species suitable for the composition of agroforestry systems and animal feeding in semiarid climates. Given its importance, the aim of this study was to adapt the methodology of the accelerated aging test to evaluate the vigor of L. leucocephala seeds. To this end, they proceeded to implementation of accelerated aging at 41 °C for 0, 48, 72 and 96 h in seed lots, with evaluation of the percentage of post aging germination and simple correlation with the variables germination, first count, speed of germination, electrical conductivity and seedling emergence. After 48 h of aging was no difference found on the percentage of germination of the lots, and only the 96 h exposure period showed a significant correlation with the seedling emergence test. The accelerated aging test conducted at 41 °C for 96 h is effective to differentiate lots of L. leucocephala seeds in vigor levels.

AB  - A study was conducted in three different soils (Toje, Hatso and Alajo) to evaluate the effectiveness of the indigenous rhizobia that nodulate five indigenous/or introduced tree legumes (Albizia lebbeck, Acacia mangium, Acacia auriculiformis, Mellitia thonningii and Leucaena leucocephala,) as well as their ability to nodulate other legumes (Cajanus cajan, Crotalaria ochroleuca and Vigna unguiculata) other than their host legumes. The results indicate that, indigenous rhizobia capable of nodulating each of the five tree legumes were present in all the three soils used for the study with the native rhizobia population ranging from 22 cells/g soil in Alajo soil to 5200 cells/g soil in either Hatso or Toje series. Rhizobia isolates from Mellitia thonningii were specific as they nodulated only their host legumes whilst that from Leucaena leucocephala, Crotalaria ochroleuca and Cajanus cajan were moderately promiscuous, with NGR 234 being highly promiscuous. Over 63% of the 200 rhizobia isolates were found to be ineffective on the five legume trees tested, whilst almost 18% were either found to be moderately effective or effective. The majority of the isolates from the five tree legumes were found to be ineffective on their respective host plant with ineffectiveness ranging from almost 43% in the case of Acacia auriculiformis to 88% in the case of Acacia mangium isolates. The high proportion of ineffective isolates (63%) and relatively low proportion of effective (18%) or moderately effective (18%) isolates call for the need for inoculation of the tree legumes in this study with an effective and competitive strains for maximum nodulation and nitrogen fixation. © 2017 Trop.

AB  - This study was carried out to investigate the potential and role of leguminous fodder trees Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Gliricidia sepium (GS) under small scale dairy production system and their carbon storage potentials. Structured questionnaires were used in data collection and a total of 120 farmers in 3 zones of Muheza district were included in the study. Above ground biomass was calculated from different tree components (stem and branches) in t ha-1, 29% of stem biomass was taken as biomass of branches. Carbon storage was calculated as 49% of the total tree species biomass. Data from the survey and biological data were analyzed using SPSS and SAS statistical software, respectively. Only 46.7% respondents do allocate land for fodder trees equivalent to 0.05 — 3.4% of their farm land. About 32.5% of them cultivated LL alone and 7% cultivated GS while 11% cultivated both species. Size of the farm land influenced (P>0.05) area allocated for fodder production. Generally, (81.7%) of the farmers were using leaf meal (LM) to feed their dairy cows. About 71% and 5% of the respondents used Leucaena leaf meal (LLM) and Gliricidia leaf meal (GLM), respectively, while 3.3% used both LLM and GLM. The use of LM differed between the target zones and the protein supply potential from LLM was 250g CP/kg DM. Carbon density (CD) of LL was estimated to be 5.06 t onnes C ha-1 at 16169 trees per ha, whereas GS had 10.24 tonnes C ha-1 at 1334 tree density per ha which is equivalent to emissions from 3 and 5 cattle, respectively. Hence one cow requires 0.3 and 0.2 ha or 5390 and 269 trees of LL and GS to be carbon emission neutral. The CD for both species differed between zones. Carbon stock above the ground in the two species were sufficient and therefore planting at 6000 and 1000 trees of LL and GS respectively per cow can save as a mitigation option for offsetting CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. © 2017 Fundacion CIPAV.

TI  - Ants show that the conservation potential of afforestation efforts in Chinese valley-type savanna is dependent upon the afforestation method
PY  - 2017

AB  - China has the largest afforestation effort in the world, which was implemented in response to large-scale deforestation that has occurred over centuries. Although the outcomes for vegetation coverage are clear, it remains unclear if these efforts also translate into broader conservation outcomes for fauna. Here we use ant communities to assess the conservation potential of vegetation undergoing natural regeneration and subject to afforestation plantings in valley-type savanna in the Hengduan Mountains of southwest China. Species richness was almost always highest in the oldest (30 year) sites irrespective of habitat type. The two sites that were monocultures of Leucaena leucocephala had notably low species richness (1 and 6 species respectively). Plant species richness had a significant positive relationship with total ant abundance and richness. The number of exotic ant species present had a negative relationship with total species richness. Multivariate analysis of species presence/absence data found no distinction between ant communities of plantation and rehabilitating sites, except for the two Leucaena plantation sites. PCA analysis of abundance data found that the separation of the sites was dependent upon the analyses conducted. We conclude that afforestation efforts are a useful conservation tool, regardless of whether these are of regenerating purely native vegetation or the creation of novel ecosystems using non-native species. However, for plantations the conservation benefits are dependent upon the species that are planted. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Pods and leaves of legumes trees are used as feed supplements, these are used to diminish the deficiency of nitrogen present in pastures in the dry tropic. The objective was to characterize the chemical composition and the in vitro degradations of pods of Leucaena leucocephala, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Samanea saman, Acacia cochliacantha, Guazuma ulmifolia and leaves of L. leucocephala and G. ulmifolia. Dry matter, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), dry matter degradation (DMDEG), neutral detergent fiber degradation (NDFDEG), volatile fatty acids, ashes and total concentration of bacteria, were determined. The experimental design was completely randomized. The pod of E. cyclocarpum (19.50 %), the pods (19.83 %) and leaves (21.57 %) of L. Leucocephala had the highest content of CP. The E. cyclocarpum pod presented 28.38 % of NDF. The leaf of L. leucocephala (24.22 %) and the pods of S. saman (25.06 %) and E. cyclocarpum (20.40 %) had the lowest contents of ADF (P>0.05). E. cyclocarpum (73.06 and 38.68 %) and S. saman (66.01 and 35.86 %) pods quantified the highest DMDEG and NDFDEG (P>0.05). Therefore, the pods of E. cyclocarpum and S. saman are a viable alternative for feeding ruminants in the dry tropic given their chemical and fermentative characteristics.

AB  - Leucaena Leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Petai Belalang) is a medium plant which belong in group of tropical breed that can survived in hot, dried and warm environment. In Malaysia, the plant is available abundantly. As there are still no commercial used, and no serious intention in finding the benefits of L. Leucocephala, this work come out with the idea to analyze the antioxidants contains in leaves of the plant by undergoes different extraction and chemical testing method. The phytochemical screening assay involved in this study are antioxidant activity by using free radical diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, total phenolic content by using Folin-Ciocalteu method, total flavonoid content by using colorimetric assay with ascorbic acid and quercetin were used as reference standards while for phosphorus analysis, a molybdenum blue method or also known as ascorbic acid method was used. For antioxidant activity by using free radical diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, higher concentration was recorded by extraction using methanol (dried sample) which is 8247.0 mg/L, for total phenolic content higher concentration was recorded by extraction using deionized water (dried sample) which is 4276.0 mg/L, for total flavonoid content by using colorimetric assay higher concentration was recorded by extraction using methanol (dried sample) which is 4439.0 mg/L, and for for phosphorus analysis higher concentration was recorded by extraction using methanol (dried sample) which is 71.057 mg/L. © 2017 Author(s).

AB  - The intensification of beef cattle production in dryland areas of East Indonesia has the potential to substantially raise the incomes of smallholder farmers that dominate the sector. In this study we assess the potential for intensifying beef production on Sumbawa Island, by introducing a household feedlot production system (2–20 animals) based on the Leucaena leucocephala (leucanea) tree legume as an improved source of feed. We used a system dynamics approach to model the entire value chain, accounting for herd dynamics, demand dynamics and seasonality. Our findings complement the growing body of biophysical evidence about the potential success of this intervention, by simulating improvements in the annual profitability for beef farmers in the project area of up to 415% by 2023. Increases in farm profit were shown to depend near equally on the higher productivity of the leucaena feeding system and an associated price premium, demonstrating the importance of supporting improved agricultural production with better marketing practices. The intervention was also shown to generate positive or neutral benefits for the main post-farm value chain actors. Importantly, it also reduced the GHG emission intensity of outputs from the beef herd by 16% by 2020. We explored number of scale-out pathways, including a relatively moderate pace of autonomous adoption for our main analysis, resulting in the accumulation of 3,444 hectares of leucaena 20-years after the initial project phase, which could sustain the fattening of 37,124 male cattle per year. More ambitious rates of scale-out were found to be possible without exceeding the animal and land resources of the island. © 2017 Dahlanuddin et al.

TI  - Naturalized alien flora of the world: Species diversity, taxonomic and phylogenetic patterns, geographic distribution and global hotspots of plant invasion
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85024130972&doi=10.23855%2fpreslia.2017.203&partnerID=40&md5=7952010be895cd8e9dd1d44e1c5adede
AB  - Using the recently built Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database, containing data on the distribution of naturalized alien plants in 483 mainland and 361 island regions of the world, we describe patterns in diversity and geographic distribution of naturalized and invasive plant species, taxonomic, phylogenetic and life-history structure of the global naturalized flora as well as levels of naturalization and their determinants. The mainland regions with the highest numbers of naturalized aliens are some Australian states (with New South Wales being the richest on this continent) and several North American regions (of which California with 1753 naturalized plant species represents the world's richest region in terms of naturalized alien vascular plants). England, Japan, New Zealand and the Hawaiian archipelago harbour most naturalized plants among islands or island groups. These regions also form the main hotspots of the regional levels of naturalization, measured as the percentage of naturalized aliens in the total flora of the region. Such hotspots of relative naturalized species richness appear on both the western and eastern coasts of North America, in north-western Europe, South Africa, south-eastern Australia, New Zealand, and India. High levels of island invasions by naturalized plants are concentrated in the Pacific, but also occur on individual islands across all oceans. The numbers of naturalized species are closely correlated with those of native species, with a stronger correlation and steeper increase for islands than mainland regions, indicating a greater vulnerability of islands to invasion by species that become successfully naturalized. South Africa, India, California, Cuba, Florida, Queensland and Japan have the highest numbers of invasive species. Regions in temperate and tropical zonobiomes harbour in total 9036 and 6774 naturalized species, respectively, followed by 3280 species naturalized in the Mediterranean zonobiome, 3057 in the subtropical zonobiome and 321 in the Arctic. The New World is richer in naturalized alien plants, with 9905 species compared to 7923 recorded in the Old World. While isolation is the key factor driving the level of naturalization on islands, zonobiomes differing in climatic regimes, and socioeconomy represented by per capita GDP, are central for mainland regions. The 11 most widely distributed species each occur in regions covering about one third of the globe or more in terms of the number of regions where they are naturalized and at least 35% of the Earth's land surface in terms of those regions' areas, with the most widely distributed species Sonchus oleraceus occuring in 48% of the regions that cover 42% of the world area. Other widely distributed species are Ricinus communis, Oxalis corniculata, Portulaca oleracea, Eleusine indica, Chenopodium album, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Stellaria media, Bidens pilosa, Datura stramonium and Echinochloa crus-galli. Using the occurrence as invasive rather than only naturalized yields a different ranking, with Lantana camara (120 regions out of 349 for which data on invasive status are known), Calotropis procera (118), Eichhornia crassipes (113), Sonchus oleraceus (108) and Leucaena leucocephala (103) on top. As to the life-history spectra, islands harbour more naturalized woody species (34.4%) thanmainland regions (29.5%), and fewer annual herbs (18.7% compared to 22.3%). Ranking families by their absolute numbers of naturalized species reveals that Compositae (1343 species), Poaceae (1267) and Leguminosae (1189) contribute most to the global naturalized alien flora. Some families are disproportionally represented by naturalized aliens on islands (Arecaceae, Araceae, Acanthaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae, Convolvulaceae, Rubiaceae, Malvaceae), and much fewer so on mainland (e.g. Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Boraginaceae). Relating the numbers of naturalized species in a family to its total global richness shows that some of the large species-rich families are over-represented among naturalized aliens (e.g. Poaceae, Leguminosae, Rosaceae, Amaranthaceae, Pinaceae), some under-represented (e.g. Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae), whereas the one richest in naturalized species, Compositae, reaches a value expected from its global species richness. Significant phylogenetic signal indicates that families with an increased potential of their species to naturalize are not distributed randomly on the evolutionary tree. Solanum (112 species), Euphorbia (108) and Carex (106) are the genera richest in terms of naturalized species; over-represented on islands are Cotoneaster, Juncus, Eucalyptus, Salix, Hypericum, Geranium and Persicaria, while those relatively richer in naturalized species on the mainland are Atriplex, Opuntia, Oenothera, Artemisia, Vicia, Galium and Rosa. The data presented in this paper also point to where information is lacking and set priorities for future data collection. The GloNAF database has potential for designing concerted action to fill such data gaps, and provide a basis for allocating resources most efficiently towards better understanding and management of plant invasions worldwide.

AB  - The development of dependable, environmentally benign methods for the synthesis of nanoscale material is an important concern of nanotechnology. In this work, it explores and finds the synthesis of highly dispersed silver nanoparticles (Ag-NP's) with the help of Leucaena Leucocephala leaf extract (LLLE) as reducing agent. The synthesized Ag-NP's was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV–vis Spectroscopy (UV–vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Moreover, the synthesized Ag-NP's show the circular shape with average particle size of 40 nm. Also the synthesized Ag-NP's show better activity towards degradation of aqueous hexavalent chromium solution under visible light irradiation. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (B.E.T) surface area analysis was done to explain the photodegtadation of chromium in aqueous solution. The short term invitro cytotoxicity of the biosynthesized Ag-NP's was tested against DLA cell lines using trypan blue dye exclusion technique and thus the synthesized Ag-NP's show 100% inhibition with concentration of 100 μg/ml. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is known to feed on nearly 900 host plants causing significant crop damage worldwide. Research was led to record the dispersal frequency of seven known endosymbionts namely Portiera, Rickettsia, Wolbachia, Cardinium, Fritschea, Hamiltonella and Arsenophonus among the field populations of B. tabaci collected from two medicinally important host plants, viz., Subabool (Leucaena leucocephala) and China rose (Hibiscus rosasinensis). Individuals collected from each host were scanned for their endosymbiont diversity. The primary endosymbiont, Portiera aleyrodidarum was present in all the samples of B. tabaci but dispersal of secondary endosymbionts varied. This unbalanced distribution of secondary endosymbionts fortifies the hypothesis that each endosymbiotic bacterium not only has a role in the existence but may also have a role in the polyphagus nature of B. tabaci. © Global Science Publications.

AB  - The study was conducted throughout two seasons (2013 and 2014) at Xmatkuil farm at Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, to determine the relationships and the interactions between chemical compositions of condensed tannins and mimosine and their effects on the susceptibility of four Leucaena genotypes: Cunningham and K636 (L. leucocephala), and Nativa and KX2 (L. leucocephala × L. pallida) to the infestation of the most destructive insect pests; Leucaena Psyllids, Heteropsylla cubana Crawford, 1914 (Homoptera: Psyllidae), and Onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman, 1889 (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). Mimosine showed insignificant effect on the population of both pests. However, tannins exhibited a significant effect for Psyllid population on Nativa and K636, and highly significant effect on thrips for the same respective genotypes. The insignificant relationships of tannin effect were found for Cunningham and KX2 to the population fluctuations of Psyllid and Thrips. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Nusselt numbers for Poiseuille flow over isoflux parallel ridges accounting for meniscusÂ curvature
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027929849&doi=10.1017%2fjfm.2016.760&partnerID=40&md5=8e7f306168d129a0a03f5a69d18f0ebe
AB  - We investigate forced convection in a parallel-plate-geometry microchannel with superhydrophobic walls consisting of a periodic array of ridges aligned parallel to the direction of a Poiseuille flow. In the dewetted (Cassie) state, the liquid contacts the channel walls only at the tips of the ridges, where we apply a constant-heat-flux boundary condition. The subsequent hydrodynamic and thermal problems within the liquid are then analysed accounting for curvature of the liquid-gas interface (meniscus) using boundary perturbation, assuming a small deflection from flat. The effects of this surface deformation on both the effective hydrodynamic slip length and the Nusselt number are computed analytically in the form of eigenfunction expansions, reducing the problem to a set of dual series equations for the expansion coefficients which must, in general, be solved numerically. The Nusselt number quantifies the convective heat transfer, the results for which are completely captured in a single figure, presented as a function of channel geometry at each order in the perturbation. Asymptotic solutions for channel heights large compared with the ridge period are compared with numerical solutions of the dual series equations. The asymptotic slip length expressions are shown to consist of only two terms, with all other terms exponentially small. As a result, these expressions are accurate even for heights as low as half the ridge period, and hence are useful for engineering applications. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.

TI  - Immunofluorescence localization of β-(1-4)-D-galactan and xylans in tension wood and normal wood fibres of Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2017

AB  - The distribution pattern of β-(1-4)-D-galactan and xylans in the fibres of tension wood and normal wood of Leucaena leucocephala was investigated using immunofluorescence microscopy. Light microscopic observation of tension wood fibres revealed that they are characterized by the presence of typical non-lignified, tertiary wall layer. LM-5 labelling of normal fibres showed weak labelling from the cell wall, indicating less concentration of β-(1-4)-D-galactans or masking effect due to co-polymerization of other polymers. Both less substituted (LM-10) and highly substituted (LM-11) xylans found to be distributed more in the secondary wall region, while compound middle lamella showed weak labelling. In tension wood fibres, LM-5 labelling revealed strong signals from tertiary wall layer, indicating that gelatinous layer contains more amount of β-(1-4)-D-galactans. The lignified secondary wall and compound middle lamellae showed weak labelling with LM-5. Labelling of xylans with LM-10 showed intense fluorescence signals from the lignified secondary wall, while gelatinous layer showed weak labelling, indicating less concentration of xylans in the gelatinous layer. In conclusion, in addition to the generalized concept that the G-layer in tension wood fibre is rich in cellulose, our results showed that constitution of pectins and xylans is also different compared to the secondary wall of normal wood fibres. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

TI  - Rapidly growing vegetables as new sources for lignocellulose nanofibre isolation: Physicochemical, thermal and rheological characterisation
PY  - 2017

AB  - Rapidly growing vegetables could be an abundant and cheap sources of lignocellulose biomass for lignocellulose nanofibre (LCNF) production. The aim of this work is to study the feasibility of using Chamaecytisus proliferus and Leucaena leucocephala for LCNF isolation by mechanical, enzymatic and TEMPO-mediated oxidation pre-treatments. Characterisation of the nanofibres shows that there are significant differences in the production of LCNF depending on the raw material and pre-treatment used. XRD and FTIR analysis show that homogenisation has a strong negative effect on the crystallinity index; however, the higher lignin content of tagasaste (10%) protects the fibre, causing a smaller decrease in crystallinity. The thermal stability of LCNF is also affected by the high lignin content in the case of tagasaste, which exhibited maximum degradation temperatures of 340–315 °C, that were higher than those for leucaena (330–310 °C). A strong shear thinning behaviour was observed in most of the LCNF, which revealed a great degree of interconnectivity in the gel like-network. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala commonly known as 'Petai belalang' locally and well known as the miracle tree and it has other variety of usage such as pulp and wood productions and reforestation. The main objectives of this study is to determine the chemical composition of small diameter wild Leucaena leucocephala species and to compare its chemical composition at 3 different stem portions (bottom, middle and top) and 2 different parts (bark and wood). The chemical composition, sampling and preparation of samples for these analyses were carried out according to the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI) standards except for hemicellulose which is the data collected through equation. For chemical composition, Leucaena leucocephala wood and bark were analyzed for extractives, holocellulose, A-cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin for each portion which are bottom, middle and top. Based on the results obtained, it shows that the extractives are the highest for top wood (1.41%) and top bark (4.11%). For the holocellulose, the middle wood (90.61%) and bottom bark (73.14%) are the highest. Meanwhile, for a-cellulose, bottom wood (61.18%) and top bark (66.65%) showed the highest percentages. For the hemicellulose percentages, the middle wood (34.74%) and top bark (5.39%) obtained the highest percentages while lignin percentages are the highest for bottom wood (25.22%) and middle bark (19.12%). This study unveiled the chemical composition of Leucaena leucocephala species and thus showing species can be used in paper production and reforestation.

TI  - Native rhizobia from Zn mining soil promote the growth of Leucaena leucocephala on contaminated soil
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007152856&doi=10.1080%2f15226514.2016.1207600&partnerID=40&md5=84b93cec3ec027d9a64576c07daddf49
AB  - Plants on contaminated mining soils often show a reduced growth due to nutrient depletion as well as trace elements (TEs) toxicity. Since those conditions threat plant's survival, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs), such as rhizobia, might be of crucial importance for plant colonization on TE-contaminated soils. Native rhizobia from mining soils are promising candidates for bioaugmented phytoremediation of those soils as they are adapted to the specific conditions. In this work, rhizobia from Zn- and Cd-contaminated mining soils were in vitro screened for their PGP features [organic acids, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and siderophore (SID) production; 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity; and Ca3(PO4)2 solubilization] and Zn and Cd tolerance. In addition, some type and reference rhizobia strains were included in the study as well. The in vitro screening indicated that rhizobia and other native genera have great potential for phytoremediation purposes, by exerting, besides biological N2 fixation, other plant growth-promoting traits. Leucaena leucocephala–Mesorhizobium sp. (UFLA 01-765) showed multielement tolerance and an efficient symbiosis on contaminated soil, decreasing the activities of antioxidative enzymes in shoots. This symbiosis is a promising combination for phytostabilization. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This research was conducted to analyze the effect of legume wafer supplementation on the performance of post weaning Ettawa Grade goats. A total of 16 post weaning Ettawa Grade goats (average body weight 13.10±0.91 kg) were grouped into 4 group treatments and 4 blocks as replicate in a completely randomized block design. The treatments were T0 (basal diet/control), T1 (supplementation of 12.12% wafer supplement of Indigofera zollingeriana), T2 (supplementation of 13.54% wafer supplement of Leucaena leucocephala) and T3 (supplementation of 12.37% wafer supplement of Calliandra calothyrsus). The feed intake, nutrient digestibility, average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency (FE), and income over feed cost (IOFC) were observed. The results showed that supplementation of legume wafer increased (P < 0.05) the feed intake, organic matter digestibility, ADG, FE, and IOFC. Supplementation of I. zollingeriana wafer increased ADG by 55.08%, FE by 34.91%, and IOFC by 14.53%; L. leucocephala wafer increased ADG by 66.18%, FE by 41.63%, and IOFC by 19.09%; and C. calothyrsus wafer increased ADG by 32.62%, FE by 11.30%, and IOFC by 14.34%. In conclusion, the addition of legume wafer supplements into the rations could increase the feed utility value of legumes and L. leucocephala wafer at 13.54% showed the best performance in post-weaning Ettawa Grade goats.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the nutrient digestibility of cassava leaf meal (CLM), Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM), Stylosanthes guianensis grass meal (SGM) Moringa oleifera leaf meal (M.LM) and Trichanthera gigantea leaf meal (T.LM) in Luong Phuong broiler chickens. The study was carried out based on the nutrient digestibility of 2 diets: 1) The basal diet without the inclusion of leaf meals and 2) the experimental diet consisting of 80% basal diet and 20% leaf meals. Based on the nutrient digestibility and the total digestible matter of the 2 diets, the nutrient digestibility of leaf meals was calculated. The results showed that crude protein, lipid, fiber, non - nitrogen extract digestibility of CLM was 63.35; 75.91; 22.02 and 68.30%, respectively. That of LLM was 68.27; 79.76; 24.67 and 70.89%, respectively. That of SGM was 65.18; 69.23; 18.89 and 67.58%, respectively. That of MLM was 67.97; 78.15; 25.48 and 72.84%, respectively. And that of TLM was 65.43; 72.73; 23.08 and 68.90%, respectively. The formulation of a diet based on the nutrient digestibility of the feed ingredients was recommended in order to obtain optimum performance of broiler chickens. © 2017, National Centre for Agrarian Sciences.

AB  - For a better understanding of the strategies that are used by Prosopis glandulosa in heavy metal tolerance, the present study evaluated the gene expression of three metallothioneins (MTs; PgMt2-1, PgMt2, and PgMt3) in plants exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of copper. The PgMt2-1, PgMt2, and PgMt3 sequences were homologous to the MT type 2 (isoform 1), Mt2, and Mt3 sequences of other plant species found in GenBank. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that treatment with 100 mM Cu2+ induced a significant increase in PgMt2 and PgMt3 expression during the first 4 h of exposure compared to that of PgMt2-1. However, after 8 h of exposure, the expression levels of PgMt2 and PgMt3 were significantly lower than those of PgMt2-1. PgMt transcript levels only increased significantly during the first hour after exposure to copper, suggesting that PgMts could play a key role in the plant’s detoxification mechanism. However, additional studies are required to confirm MTs as a mechanism of heavy metal tolerance and accumulation in this species. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze oxidative stress produced in cucumber seeds and seedlings when exposed to aqueous extract from dried leaves of leucaena, as well as its effect on the germination behavior, early growth and the antioxidant enzymes activity. It was evaluated the percentage, the speed index, the average time, the frequency and germination synchronization, the root length and shoot, as well as the catalase and peroxidase enzymes activity. There was no significant inhibitory effect of the leaf extracts on the germination percentage. However, there was delay in the seeds germination, as the extract proportion increased. A stimulatory effect of the extract compared to the shoot length was observed, however the root growth was significantly reduced. The catalase activities had a peak at 24 hours after soaking the seeds, however, the activities were reduced in seedlings. The peroxidase activity was low in the seeds and increased in the seedlings at 168 hours after immersion. The results suggest that there was oxidative stress due to allelochemicals present in the leaves extracts from leucaena, verified by germination and initial growth changes, causing alterations in the plants rootlets. © 2017, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - This study evaluated a 5-year-old riparian forest in an anthropogenically affected region along the Das Velhas River in southeastern Brazil, restored with the purposes of erosion control and other ecosystem functions and to monitor indicators of structure and composition. The forest was monitored via data collection of the diameter and height of trees for phytosociological analysis, including the identification of species and their classification with regard to life form, origin, weed-status, and successional stage. The forest was not very structurally developed and, overall, 111 species were recorded consisting of 65.8% herbs, 24.3% trees, and 9.9% other types of life forms. About 70.9% of species were natives, 29.1% exotics, and 65% weeds. The high abundance of exotic species and weed species (some aggressive such as Leucaena leucocephala) of various life forms may negatively affect the restoration success in terms of seedling recruitment and diversity of native species, but may constitute a neutral or even positive accomplishment for erosion control (with species composition as a secondary effect). Results also reinforce the knowledge that choice of species for restoration must be in accordance with major local filters (e.g., floods), and areas within urban matrices may deserve special attention, including periodic management actions to control undesirable species. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Angola is one of the most neglected African countries in terms of botanical research, in respect of both native and naturalized species. We conducted a rapid assessment of invasive plant species in western Angola during August 2014. In thirteen primary vegetation types, we recorded populations of 44 naturalized plant species, nineteen of which are conclusively invasive (spreading far from introduction sites). Dense invasive populations of Chromolaena odorata, Inga vera and Opuntia stricta pose the greatest environmental and economic threats. Some species with known taxonomic and/or biogeographic uncertainties (e.g. Chromolaena odorata and Ageratina adenophora) or which lacked key characteristics for identification such as flowers during our survey (e.g. Eucalyptus spp.) were subjected to DNA barcoding for comparisons with available genetic data from other studies. This approach allowed us to confirm the identity of taxonomically challenging taxa such as Inga vera, Opuntia stricta and Prosopis chilensis, to conclusively differentiate Chromolaena odorata from Ageratina adenophora, and identify the subspecific identity of Acacia saligna. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to assess the presence and abundance of invasive plant species with respect to the major abiotic factors and vegetation types. Three fairly distinct groups of species emerge from this analysis: (i) species of dry lowland habitats (Calotropis gigantea, Leucaena leucocephala and Opuntia stricta); (ii) species of relatively wet habitats at mid elevations (Ageratum conyzoides, Bidens pilosa, Cardiospermum grandiflorum, Chromolaena odorata, Solanum mauritianum and Tithonia diversifolia); and (iii) upland species (Ageratina adenophora, Galinsoga parviflora and Tagetes minuta). Several invasive species that are widespread in other tropical and subtropical African countries are currently either missing (e.g. many Australian Acacia species, Azolla filiculoides, Broussonetia papyrifera, Clidemia hirta, Parthenium hysterophorus, Rubus rosaefolius, Salvinia molesta), have only very localized populations in Angola (e.g. Lantana camara, Prosopis chilensis) or exist only as planted individuals (e.g. Acacia mearnsii and A. saligna subsp. saligna). © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Five promising tanniferous tree leaves viz. Acacia nilotica, Eugenia jambolana, Ficus religiosa, L. leucocephala and Psidium guajava were selected for in vitro antioxidant and anticoccidial properties against avian Eimeria species. Condensed tannins (CT) extracts of above tree leaves were prepared in 70 % acetone and then freeze dried in lyophilizer. Antioxidant property of lyophilized acetone extract of different CT sources was evaluated by in-vitro methods. The 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity was significantly higher in P. guajava as compared to other CT sources. However, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging activity was significantly (P<0.05) lower in L. leucocephala compared to other CT sources. The CT extract of A. nilotica, E. jambolana, F. religiosa and P. guajava showed significantly (P<0.05) higher reducing power than that of L. leucocephala. Sporulation inhibition (%) of Eimeria spp. was significantly (P<0.05) higher in E. jambolana and P. guajava, followed by A. nilotica, L. leucocephla and least in F. religiosa, while, E. jambolana and P. guajava showed maximum sporulation inhibition activity @ 4 mg/ml. It was concluded that CT extracts of A. nilotica, E. jambolana, F. religiosa, L. leucocephala and P. guajava leaves possess the antioxidant and anti-coccidian property. It may be eco-friendly socioeconomic alternative, natural antioxidant, anti-coccidian agent and/ or natural feed additive for organic meat production. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

TI  - Maintenance of air layer and drag reduction on superhydrophobic surface
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85002637557&doi=10.1016%2fj.oceaneng.2016.11.028&partnerID=40&md5=de820501af20fc0dac7280b32da2dba8
AB  - Hydrophobic surface for drag reduction on marine vehicles and structures has been proposed for many years. However, the drag reduction effect has been found to be unstable under high flow speed/pressure conditions because of the destruction of air-water interface. In this paper, an air layer was maintained experimentally by continuous air injection on hydrophobic surfaces. Good hydrophobicity was found to benefit the spread of air bubbles and the formation of a wide and flat air layer on solid surfaces. Based on this recognition, a method combining air injection and surface hydrophobicity adjustment was proposed to maintain the air layer. Through flow field analyses, it has been found that the roughness of irregular micro-structures on superhydrophobic surfaces became dominant and the frictional drag was increased in the Wenzel state. However through air injection, the Cassie state was able to be recovered and the slip could also be re-formed at the solid surface. Because of the slip effect, vortices and shears in the turbulent boundary layer were restrained, and a drag reduction up to 20% was obtained in the study. This method was promising to maintain a robust air-water interface on superhydrophobic surfaces and sustain the drag reduction effect in engineering applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Invasiveness and biomass production of leucaena leucocephala under harsh ecological conditions of north-central Namibia
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026804584&doi=10.26525%2fjtfs2017.29.3.297304&partnerID=40&md5=82c80cee4975fb645d212d70d4e2f072
AB  - Very few agroforestry species perform well in the Cuvelai Basin of north-central Namibia due to the harsh climatic and edaphic conditions. Leucaena leucocephala is one of these species and has many ecological and economic benefits but it tends to be invasive. To evaluate the suitability of this species for agroforestry in Namibia, two experiments were conducted at the Ogongo Campus of the University of Namibia. As indication of invasiveness, seed germination and survival of seedlings under different management were monitored for 44 weeks and growth rates of 33-month-old sprouts were used to estimate the potential wood biomass production. Watering and tilling the land gave the highest number of surviving seedlings. Death of seedlings was highest during the dry cold and dry hot months. Height growth rate of sprouts was 1.98 m year-1 and sun dried wood production was 15.8 tonnes ha-1 year-1. Low temperature, soil surface hard pan and extreme lack of moisture could limit seedling survival and hence invasiveness. Biomass production compares favourably with productivity of L. leucocephala grown elsewhere. The likelihood of the species becoming invasive is viewed as high only in cultivated, irrigated areas. Leucaena leucocephala could be utilised as an agroforestry species under proper management to minimise chances of it becoming invasive. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - Under laboratory conditions, we assayed the phytotoxic potential of L. leucocephala seed leachates from (1 to 5 d after start of imbibitions) on germination and seedling growth of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.). The chemical composition of L. leucocephala seed leachates was also determined. The L. leucocephala seed leachates did not affect the germination, while root and shoot lengths were significantly reduced. In the beginning of imbibition the mimosine, abscisic acid, sugars, phenolics, proteins and amino acids were found in L. leucocephala seed leachates. The mimosine was very inhibitory to seedling growth of tomato than rice. The presence of mimosine in seed leachates could explain the high toxicity of L. leucocephala on the development of assayed crops. © 2017, International Allelopathy Foundation. All rights reserved.

AB  - In a study to evaluate enteric methane production and nutritional quality of locally available forages in dry season of Malawi’s central region, legume forages such as Arachis hypogaea (hay) and fodder tree leaf meals were found to produce less methane than the non- legumes. Out of the non-legumes, Richardia scabraa shrub which is locally available in both dry and rainy season had the least methane production and was not significantly different from the fodder tree leaf meals according to the following P-values; 0.411, 0.970 and 0.984 for Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania sesban and Acacia anguistissima respectively. Arachis hypogaea hay had the least methane production as compared to all forages under study, however, the P-values show no significant differences from Leucaena leucocephala, Sesbania sesban and Acacia anguistissima; 0.746, 0.162, 0.133 respectively but rather different from the Rechardia scabra(P-value= 0.02).Therefore, supplementation of Richardia scabra and fodder tree leaf meals in the dry season could be the best option not only for protein but also to reduce dietary energy losses through enteric methane. © 2017, Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - Exotic species are species established outside of their natural range and include invasive species, which are the second most important cause of biodiversity loss worldwide and a high risk factor for fragile ecosystems. The exotic species Leucaena leucocephala, a high-risk invasive species, has been introduced to Andean tropical dry forests of Colombia. Here, we compare the complexity and structure of the arthropod trophic networks of the seeds of two legume species, Senegalia riparia (native) and L. leucocephala (exotic), and also evaluate seed germination potential after Bruchinae emergence in comparison with that of undamaged seeds. We found 16 species of arthropods associated with both legume seeds, but the native species had more parasitoids, causing its network to be more dense and complex than that of the exotic species. Four arthropod species connected the two networks. The native species seeds already used for beetle development had the lowest germination percentage, whereas those of the exotic species exhibited the highest. Comparing the structure of seed feeder communities and their effects on germination in exotic and native legumes is essential for understanding how exotic species relate to native communities and how anthropogenic changes affect species diversity, ecosystem dynamics, and community structure and interactions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reports the main clinical changes of natural and experimentally poisoning by Leucaena leucocephala in horses. Outbreaks of poisoning occurred in São Paulo and Goiás States, where six horses after ingestion of bark and/or leaves of the plant showed alopecia mainly in mane and tail. The diagnosis was based on the observation of plant intake and clinical signs. In horses experimentally poisoned, clinical examination was performed and skin biopsies were taken from mane, back and tail regions, and triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) serum levels were assayed. Alopecia in mane and tail was the main clinical sign, accompanied by anorexia, weight loss and lethargy in all horses. T3 and total T4 showed significant decrease in serum levels (p=0.05) in the third week of leucaena intake compared with baseline levels. Marked telogenization of hair follicles at the end of the experiments were observed in skin biopsies. The clinical and pathological findings in poisoned horses are similar to those observed in ruminants. Experimental poisoning of horses by the plant highlights the marked decline in levels of thyroid hormones, suggesting goitrogenic effect of mimosine and its derived compounds, with transient hypothyroidism and alopecia due to accentuated reduction in follicular activity.

AB  - The nutritive value of forage resources from natural grazing land as dry season feed supplements for grazing animals was evaluated through their chemical composition and in vitro gas production. The forage resources include conserved forages (hay and silage), browse plant (Leucaena leucocephala leaves) and the forages in the natural pasture during the dry season served as the control. Crude protein (CP) contents of the forage resources ranged from 59 to 171 g/kg dry matter (DM), with L. leucocephala leaves having the highest (p<0.05) CP contents. Neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) contents of the forage resources ranged from 560 to 705 g/kg DM and 363 to 440 g/kg DM, respectively. The highest in vitro gas production of 38.7 ml/200 mg DM was recorded for L. leucocephala leaves which was followed by silage and hay while forages in the natural pasture during the dry season recorded the least gas production. The volume of gas production significantly (p<0.05) ranged from 13.7 ml/200 mg DM in natural pasture to 38.7 ml/200 mg DM in L. leucocephala leaves. The fractional rate of gas production value of 0.10 h-1 was highest in L. leucocephala leaves and lowest in the silage with the value of 0.07 h-1. L. leucocephala leaves had the highest (p<0.05) values of ME, OMD and SCFA (16.8 MJ/ kg DM, 64.7% and 0.8 μmol respectively while natural pasture recorded lowest values of 5.3 MJ/kg DM, 32.8%, 0.2 μmol for ME, OMD and SCFA respectively. The study showed that conserved forages (hay and silage) and browse plant (L. leucocephala leaves) were superior to forage in natural pasture during dry season in terms of CP and gas production, thus indicating higher nutritive potential. They may therefore be used as supplements for ruminants that are grazing on poor quality roughages during the dry season. © 2017, Universidad de Cordoba,Servicio de Publicaciones.

AB  - Nine fodders commonly offered to the guinea pigs by the breeders in Lubumbashi (Democratic Republic of Congo) were compared for chemical composition and for both daily dry matter intake and palatability indices by using 13 three-month-old guinea pigs. Four different plant families were provided to each guinea pig, and each animal was exposed to all the experimental diets studied for 8 consecutive days. The fodder species were three grasses: Trypsacum laxum, Panicum maximum, and Pennisetum purpureum; three trees or bushes Moringa oleifera, Leucaena leucocephala, and Bauhinia variegata; and three flowering plants Bidens oligoflora, Bidens pilosa, and Commelina diffusa. Dry matter content varied from 14 to 44/100 g FM, and CP from 13 to 28/100 g DM. B. variegata and P. purpureum showed the lowest CP value and L. leucocephala the highest. The grasses and the Commelina had higher levels of hemicelluloses than the tree fodders, especially P. maximum (45/100 g DM). High levels of K were found in the grasses and Bidens, and high Ca in the tree fodders and Bidens. The guinea pigs preferred, in a descending order, P. purpureum (0.79), B. pilosa (0.78), C. diffusa (0.78), T. laxum (0.77), P. maximum (0.76), B. oligoflora (0.75), M. oleifera (0.45), L. leucocephala (0.37), and B. variegata (0.33). The DMI and the palatability index were strongly correlated to the ash (r = 0.82; p ˂ 0.05) and the potassium (r = 0.88; p ˂ 0.05) contents in fodders. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Seed coat-imposed dormancy in seeds of the leguminous forage Leucaena leucocephala is an important impediment to rapid, uniform and high germination rates. Thus to test the effectiveness of several presowing treatments on germinability of L. leucocephala seeds, the following treatments were imposed under a Completely Randomized Design with 4 replications of 100 seeds each; (1) mechanical chipping with a nail clip, (2) soaking in hot water at 80oC for 5 minutes, (3) preheating at 600C for 150 minutes in an air-circulating oven, (4) immersion in concentrated sulphuric acid for 5 minutes as well as (5) untreated seeds as control. Final germination percentage was highest for mechanical clipping (97.8%) and the hot water (84.3%) treatments. The untreated seeds (control) attained only 2% final germination with low values for dry heat (22.8%) and sulphuric acid (5%) treatments. Mechanical scarification greatly reduced germination time as most seeds (87.5%) sprouted in the first 4 days and germination was complete by day 7 whilst the hot water, dry heat and sulphuric acid treatments had 14, 5 and 3.25% germination count respectively by day 4. It is therefore concluded that, while mechanical scarification gave the highest final germination percentage and rate, the hot water treatment was still highly effective in overcoming physical dormancy in L. leucocephala seeds when compared to untreated seeds. Practically, this is especially important when considering the labour intensiveness of mechanical scarification when bulk pretreatment of seeds is required. © 2018, Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - We report the effect of rank and lithotype on the wettability of coal in microfluidic experiments in two types of artificial microchannels: (1) reactive ion etched (RIE) channels and (2) die-cast channels prepared by pressing powdered lithotype concentrates. Five coals from the Bowen Basin with ranks in the Rmax% range 0.98–1.91% were examined. Contact angles and entry pressures of air and water in the artificial cleats were measured in imbibition experiments performed with a Cleat Flow Cell (CFC). The relative contact angles measured in CFC imbibition experiments were in the range 110 –140° in the RIE channels and 85°–115° in the pressed discs, which are larger contact angles than measured on the flat bulk surfaces of these samples by the conventional sessile drop technique (58°–85°). The CFC observations also show the surface roughness of coal in inertinite-rich dull bands effects contact angle and the entry pressure of the air-water interface differently to the vitrinite-rich bright bands. Drainage experiments in the CFC revealed a thin residual water film on the inertinite cleat wall, yet not on the smooth vitrinite channel. The experimental observations are used to present a modified Cassie Equation model to predict coal contact angles based on the fractions of dull and bright bands, mineral content, and cleat surface roughness. The results of this study provide the basis to consider an improved relative permeability model that explicitly accounts for the effect of coal lithotype. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ability of a Generalist Seed Beetle to Colonize an Exotic Host: Effects of Host Plant Origin and Oviposition Host
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023617111&doi=10.1007%2fs13744-016-0476-9&partnerID=40&md5=3642b258354f0bd27ebfc4ee74de8538
AB  - The colonization of an exotic species by native herbivores is more likely to occur if that herbivore is a generalist. There is little information on the life-history mechanisms used by native generalist insects to colonize exotic hosts and how these mechanisms are affected by host properties. We examined the ability of the generalist seed beetle Stator limbatus Horn to colonize an exotic species. We compared its host preference, acceptability, performance, and egg size when ovipositing and developing on two native (Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth and Senegalia riparia (Kunth)) and one exotic legume species (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.)). We also analyzed the seed chemistry. We found that females recognize the exotic species as an unfavorable host for larval development and that they delayed oviposition and laid fewer and larger eggs on the exotic species than on the native species. Survivorship on the exotic host was 0%. Additionally, seeds of the native species contain five chemical compounds that are absent in the exotic species, and the exotic species contains three sterols, which are absent in the native legumes. Genetically based differences between beetles adapted to different hosts, plastic responses toward new hosts, and chemical differences among seeds are important in host colonization and recognition of the exotic host. In conclusion, the generalist nature of S. limbatus does not influence its ability to colonize L. leucocephala. Explanations for the colonization of exotic hosts by generalist native species and for the success of invasive species must be complemented with studies measuring local adaptation and plasticity. © 2017, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

AB  - Five species each of grass, shrubs and tree leaves were evaluated for nutritive value by in vitro gas production (IVGP) techniques using sheep and/or goat rumen inoculums. Average CP of shrubs and tree leaves was (P<0.05) higher than grasses. NDF, ADF and cellulose contents were lower (P<0.05) in shrubs and tree leaves than grasses. Mean cumulative gas production (ml/g) at 72h was (P<0.05) higher on shrubs than grasses in sheep and goat inoculums. IVGP from grasses, shrubs and tree leaves was more on goat than sheep inoculum. IVGP was more on Dichanthium annulatum (DA), Securengia virosa (SV) and Anogeissus pendulla (AP) on either sheep or goat inoculum. Average CP degradability of shrubs and tree leaves was higher (P<0.05) than grasses in goat inoculum. Mean in vitro degradability of NDF and ADF in rumen inoculums of sheep and goat was higher (P<0.05) for grasses than shrubs and tree leaves. Mean IVDMD of shrubs and tree leaves was higher (P<0.05) than grasses in goat rumen inoculum. The IVDMD of grasses; Cenchrus ciliaris (CC) and DA, shrubs; SV and Helictris isora (HI) and tree leaves; Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Grewia optiva (GO) was higher (P<0.05) in rumen inoculums of sheep and goat. In vitro TVFA production in sheep and goat inoculums was higher (P<0.05) from grasses than shrubs and tree leaves. Total-N and NH3-N concentration was lower (P<0.05) for grasses than tree leaves and shrubs. DA, CC among grasses, SV, HI among shrubs and LL, GO among tree leaves found nutritionally superior and may be used for silvi-pastures. © 2017, Range Management Society of India. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Phytophagous Insects, Natural Enemies, and Pollinators on Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) Trees in the Cerrado
PY  - 2017

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) is widely used to regenerate degraded landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions and serves as a protein source for animals in agrosilvopastoral systems. Thus, our objective was to assess the spatial distribution of insects on the tree crown (vertical: upper, middle, and basal canopy; horizontal: north, south, east, and west) and leaf surfaces (adaxial and abaxial) of L. leucocephala. Phytophagous insects, natural enemies, and pollinators were quantified fortnightly in 20 trees for 2 yr. North-facing tree branches had the greatest numbers of phytophagous insects, natural enemies, and pollinators. Branches facing west had the most species-rich and biodiverse phytophagous and pollinator assemblages, whereas for natural enemies, species richness and biodiversity were greatest on branches facing north or south. The greatest numbers of individuals and highest levels of species richness of phytophagous insects, natural enemies, and pollinators were observed in the upper and middle parts of the L. leucocephala canopy. The most individuals and highest levels of species richness and biodiversity for phytophagous insects, natural enemies, and pollinators were observed on the abaxial face of L. leucocephala leaves. The species with the highest abundance and k-dominance (common or constant species) on L. leucocephala trees were the phytophagous insects Trigona spinipes F. (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponinae) and Tropidacris collaris Stoll (Orthoptera: Romaleidae) and the natural enemies Camponotus sp.2 (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and Brachymyrmex sp. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). These results can inform strategies related to pest control and maintenance of natural enemies and pollinators in L. leucocephala plantations. Biopesticide application, for example, may be more effective at eliminating target organisms if directly applied on their preferred sites, and a targeted application can minimize negative effects for non-target organisms.

AB  - To evaluate dendrometric characteristics, physical and chemical properties of Myracrodruon urundeuva and Leucaena leucocephala was done suppression of five samples of each species. The dendrometric parameters evaluated were: DAP; height; volume. It was evaluated basic density and chemical analysis of wood were made. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design (DIC), with values analyzed by the test "F" at 5%. The species had a mean DAP 10.00; 14.08 cm; overall height 8.20; 12.93 m; commercial height 4.90; 10.07 m; volume shelled (C/C) 0.032; 0.104 m3; volume not shelled (S/C) 0.025; 0.095 m3 M. urundeuva and L. leucocephala, respectively. The M. urundeuva has a higher basic density. The ash content found in M. urundeuva was superior. Now, the total extractive content and holocelulose of M. urundeuva and L. leucocephala were similar. The L. leucocephala got higher total lignin content and higher calorific power. Therefore, the two species have good physical, chemical and energy characteristics.

TI  - On the degree of wetting of a slit by a liquid film flowing along an inclined plane
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018251137&doi=10.1017%2fjfm.2017.190&partnerID=40&md5=0326c1722b5184752e6664f1f164bac6
AB  - Liquid film flow along an inclined plane featuring a slit, normal to the main direction of flow, creates a second gas-liquid interface connecting the two side walls of the slit. This inner interface forms two three-phase contact lines and supports a widely varying amount of liquid under different physical and geometrical conditions. The exact liquid configuration is determined by employing the Galerkin/finite element method to solve the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations at steady state. The interplay of inertia, viscous, gravity and capillary forces along with the substrate wettability and orientation with respect to gravity and the width of the slit determine the extent of liquid penetration and free-surface deformation. Finite wetting lengths are predicted in hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates for inclination angles more or less than the vertical, respectively. Multiple steady solutions, connected by turning points forming a hysteresis loop, are revealed by pseudo-Arclength continuation. Under these conditions, small changes in certain parameter values leads to an abrupt change in the wetting length and the deformation amplitude of the outer film surface. In hydrophilic substrates the wetting lengths exhibit a local minimum for small values of the Reynolds number and a very small range of Bond numbers; when inertia increases, they exhibit the hysteresis loop with the second limit point in a very short range of Weber numbers. Simple force balances determine the proper rescaling in each case, so that critical points in families of solutions for different liquids or contact angles collapse. The flow inside the slit is quite slow in general because of viscous dissipation and includes counter-rotating vortices often resembling those reported by Moffatt (J. Fluid Mech., vol.Â 18, 1964, pp.Â 1-18). In hydrophobic substrates, the wetting lengths decrease monotonically until the first limit point of the hysteresis loop, which occurs in a limited range of Bond numbers when the Kapitza number is less than 300 and in a limited range of Weber numbers otherwise. Here additional solution families are possible as well, where one or both contact points (Cassie state) coincide with the slit corners. © 2017 Cambridge University PressÂ.

AB  - This paper reviewed research on the use of non-conventional protein sources of plant origin for poultry in Nigeria and other neighbor countries. As the cost of compounded feed continues being a burden for the Nigerian farmers due to the current high cost of conventional protein sources such as fishmeal, groundnut cake and soybean meal, it is very urgent to explore the potentials of non-conventional alternative sources of protein, especially the leaf meals of some plants, such as Moringa oleifera, Leucaena leucocephala, Manihot esculenta, Carica papaya and other leguminous fodders which can, to some extent, replace the inclusion of the conventional sources of proteins. These non-conventional alternative protein sources have excellent nutritive value and therapeutic properties. Their crude protein contents are excellent. It is apparent from the previous several studies that inclusion of these non-conventional protein sources in poultry diets improves performance of chickens in terms of growth rate and egg production. However, their recommended inclusion levels should strictly adherein order to avoid any form of deleterious effects they may likely confer on poultry. For instance, the up to 10% inclusion of Moringa oleifera leaf meal (MOLM) in the diets of laying hens has been regarded to be safe. Hence, their inclusion in poultry feeds without posing any deleterious effects to the birds’ performances as well as the consumers of the products, and ultimately, leading to better profitability on the part of the farmers, will be a novelty. © 2017, Universidad de Cordoba,Servicio de Publicaciones.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify the species of pollen supplying plants that constitute the trophic niche of Melipona mandacaia in an urban area in the Caatinga domain (a tropical arid landscape). The collection of pollen in the colonies was carried out every 15 days, from October 2014 to September 2015. The pollen was removed directly from the storage pots in three distinct colonies. A total of 24 samples were analyzed and compared with the reference pollen collection, pollen catalogs and specialized literature. For the quantitative analysis, at least 1000 pollen grains per sample were identified. A total of 39 pollen types were identified, distributed in 17 botanical families, being one an indeterminate type. The most represented family was the Fabaceae (n = 16). The most frequent types were Leucaena leucocephala, Mimosa pudica and Melochia sp. There was a significant positive correlation between temperature and the number of pollen types throughout the study. Relative humidity and rainfall were abiotic variables that did not present a significant correlation. The rarefaction curve showed that probably most of the pollen types collected by the bees studied were sampled, since the accumulation curve showed a progressive tendency to stabilization, indicating that there was sample adequacy of the pollen types. The analysis of similarity revealed a high sharing of pollen sources between colonies.

AB  - The study was conducted to investigate the effect of supplementing the basal diet of freshly cut Panicum maximum (PM) with 20% fresh Leucaena leucocephala (LL), treated with 0, 1 or 2 per cent saline solution, on the growth response of grower-finisher grasscutters (Thryonomys swinderianus). Twenty-four grasscutters, with an initial live weight of 2.0±0.06 kg were allocated in a Completely Randomized Design to four treatments namely: PM alone, PM + LL, PM + LL treated with 1% saline solution and PM + LL treated with 2% saline solution. The trial lasted for a period of 75 days. Forage intake, apparent digestibility, nitrogen balance and daily weight gains were measured during this period. Supplementing the basal diet with 20% L. leucocephala significantly (P=0.0001) increased CP intake by 31% (5.2 v. 6.8 g/day). Apparent digestibility coefficients were similar (P>0.05) among the treatments for all chemical constituents measured. However, treating the supplemented L. leucocephala with 2% salt solution increased (P=0.0329) biological value of nitrogen and reduced (P=0.005) urinary nitrogen excretion. Average daily gains differed (P=0.001) among treatments, being lowest on PM alone diet and highest on PM+LL treated with 2% saline solution. It can, therefore, be concluded that treating freshly cut L. leucocephala with 2% common salt solution and using it as a supplement of the sole P. maximum diet could increase CP intake and also reduce urinary nitrogen excretion leading to improved daily live weight gain of grower-finisher grasscutters under captive conditions. © 2017, Fundacion CIPAV.

TI  - Potential allelopathic effects of the tropical legume Sesbania virgata on the alien Leucaena leucocephala related to seed carbohydrate metabolism
PY  - 2018

AB  - Allelopathy has been considered a key mechanism to explain the invasiveness of some species. It is well known that invasive plants can affect native plants by producing novel allelochemicals but some exotic plant species may be also sensitive to allelochemicals released by native species, providing a tool to reduce growth and impacts of invasive exotic species. Here, using growth chamber experiments we tested the mutual potential allelopathic effects of Sesbania virgata (a native dominant species) and the alien Leucaena leucocephala seeds. S. virgata was unaffected by seed leachates of L. leucocephala, indicating that, under lab conditions, this legume presents resistance to the phytotoxic compounds produced by seeds of this alien species. In contrast, germination and seedling growth of L. leucocephala were strongly affected by the phytochemicals produced by seeds of S. virgata. A delay in endospermic mobilization of storage carbohydrates (raffinose-family oligosaccharides and galactomannan) was observed in the alien species. These potential allelopathic effects could not be attributed sole to the presence neither of the phytoxic catechin nor of ABA in seed leachates of S. virgata. Our findings indicate that the in vitro behavior of S. virgata is consistent with its aggressiveness in natural environment and suggest sesbanimide as a potential candidate as implicated in the noxious effects of S. virgata on the alien species. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Many of scientific evidences suggest that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables can prevent chronic diseases. In Northern Thailand, there are many vegetables that are usually consumed by local people. In this study, 17 local vegetables were selected and extracted with 95% ethanol. The extracts were screened for 5α-reductase inhibitory activity, total tannin and flavonoid contents, astringent and antioxidant activities. The results showed that Spondias pinnata and Ocimum americanum had the highest tannin and flavonoid content, respectively. Neptunia oleracea was the most potent 5α-reductase inhibitor. For antioxidant activities, S pinnata was the most potent ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) radical scavenger and the most potent ferric reducer. Polygonatum odoratum was the most potent hydrogen peroxide scavenger and Leucaena leucocephala was the most potent DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenger among the tested samples. This suggests that local vegetables in Northern Thailand have a health promotion potential, which can be further developed as nutritional supplements, preventive medicines, and topical products for cosmetic purposes. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - Effect of inclusion of different levels of Leucaena silage on rumen microbial population and microbial protein synthesis in dairy steers fed on rice straw
PY  - 2017

AB  - Objective: Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) is a perennial tropical legume that can be directly grazed or harvested and offered to ruminants as hay, silage, or fresh. However, Leucaena contain phenolic compounds, which are considered anti-nutritional factors as these may reduce intake, digestibility and thus animal performance. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine effects of Leucaena silage (LS) feeding levels on rumen microbial populations, N-balance and microbial protein synthesis in dairy steers. Methods: Four, rumen fistulated dairy steers with initial weight of 167±12 kg were randomly assigned to receive dietary treatments according to a 4×4 Latin square design. Treatments were as followings: T1 = untreated rice straw (RS; Control), T2 = 70% RS+30% LS, T3 = 40% RS+60% LS, and T4 = 100% LS. Dairy steers were fed rice straw and LS ad libitum and supplemented with concentrate at 0.2% of body weight/d. Results: Results revealed that the rumen microbial population, especially cellulolytic, proteolytic bacteria and fungal zoospores were enhanced in steers that received 60% of LS (p<0.05), whereas the amylolytic bacteria population was not affected by treatments (p>0.05). Protozoal population was linearly decreased with increasing level of LS (p<0.05). Moreover, N-balance and microbial protein synthesis were enhanced by LS feeding (p<0.05) and were the highest in 60% LS group. Conclusion: Based on this study, it could be concluded that replacement of RS with 60% LS significantly improved microbial population and microbial protein synthesis in diary steers.

AB  - Antioxidative ability of 50% ethanol extract from leaves of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit was investigated. The extraction yield, total polyphenols and total flavonoids of the ethanol extract were 18.3±0.40%, 121.3±11.04 µg gallic acid equivalents/mg and 105.2±2.77 µg quercetin equivalents/mg, respectively. The ethanol extract possessed the antioxidative activities such as free radical, cation radical, and nitrite scavenging activities as well as reducing power and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity. These antioxidative activities of the ethanol extract increased in proportion to the extract concentration. EC50 values for free radical scavenging, cation radical scavenging nitrite scavenging, and reducing power were 133.51 µg/mL, 667.22 µg/mL, 2.58 mg/mL, and 250.00 µg/mL, respectively. Polyphenols and flavonoids are suggested to be the key contributors for the antioxidative ability of the ethanol extract from Leucaena leucocephala leaves. © The Korean Society for Applied Biological Chemistry 2017.

AB  - Today it is important to make estimations and calculations of different indicators of sustainability in livestock systems that consider all the components, which are related to the use of sources of energy, and nitrogen for the execution of the present production flows and outputs of these elements in the system products. This work was carried out with the objective of determining the influence of Silvopastoral Systems livestock using nitrogen and energy balances, data were used directly in units, which has a total area of 24 hectares, 102 cattle hybrids of Holstein-Zebu, Brown Swiss-Zebu, Gyrolando Sahiwal and Jersey. Grass species that predominate are Savoy (Panicum maximum, Jacq) and cv African Star (Cynodon nlemfuensis, Vanderyst) and other species such as Tejano grass (Paspalum notatum, flügge). Among the native creeping legumes dominated by species of the genera Centrosema, Desmodium, Macroptilium, and Teramnuz. Shrubs and forage resources include Prosopis juliflora, Gliricidia sepium, Guazuma ulmifolia, Leucaena leucocephala. The investigation was not experimental, because it is an evaluation based on productive and reproductive records of livestock of the system. It is concluded that the balance of nitrogen from the unit were positive, since the amount of nitrogen that joined the system was higher (86.01 kg of N2/ha/year) while outputs were lower (32.47 kg of N2/ha/yr), was also obtained good results in terms of energy balance getting an efficiency of 0.67%. © 2017 Veterinary Organization.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted to study the influence of three tree species viz., Albizia lebbeck, Grewia optiva and Leucaena leucocephala on the growth and yield of green gram (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek) under rainfed conditions. Association of tree species in agri- silviculture system reduced the growth parameters, yield attributes and grain yield of green gram as compared to control (sole green gram). The yield reduction was maximum under Leucaena leucocephala, minimum with Albizia lebbeck and moderate under Grewia optiva. The yield of green gram got reduced to the tune of 16.72,24.23 and 33.69 per cent under Albizia lebbeck, Grewia optiva and Leucaena leucocephala, respectively. The reduction in Incidental Solar Radiation (ISR) underthe canopy of tree species also followed the similartrend.

AB  - Sexual shape dimorphism is the differentiation of male and female organisms based on their shape variation; this definition was proposed for the use of geometric morphometrics analysis where the geometric features of the shape are analyzed without the influence of the size. Macaria mirthae (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) is a moth that inhabits different valleys in the north of Chile principally associated to Acacia macracantha and lately Leucaena leucocephala both trees of the Fabaceae family. The Sexual dimorphism was analyzed in this species in order to corroborate studies on the use of wing as a sexual differentiation trait, and specific influence of localities was also evaluated. A clear shape variation was found where the male wings are more contracted compared to female wings. A climate influence is also suggested that could differentiate the wing shape from the individuals that inhabit two different valleys in the neotropical region of the north of Chile. This research supports previous studies identifying a clear Sexual shape dimorphism in the wing, as a selected trait, suggesting that oviposition and male competition of this group of moths is reflected in their wings. These differences raise the question whether Sexual shape dimorphism can be modulated by natural selection. © 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Entomologia

AB  - An experiment was carried out to study the effect of spacing of tree species on native AM fungi and microbial biomass C in the soil in an alley cropping system. The treatments comprised of 3 spacings (4, 8 and 12 m) as main plots, two perennial leguminous plant species (Gliricidia—Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena—Leucaena leucocephala) as subplots and three field crops (finger millet—Eleusine coracana, peanut—Arachis hypogea and pigeonpea—Cajanus cajan) as sub–sub plot treatments laid out in a split–split plot design with four replications. Growing finger millet, pigeonpea and peanut in between Leucaena supported mycorrhizal parameters like spore numbers and infective propagules of AM fungi in the rhizospheric soil compared to those grown in between Gliricidia. The microbial biomass C in soil was more in all the three alleyed crops grown in between Gliricidia. Spacing of 12 m between trees supported all the microbial parameters studied (except mycorrhizal spore numbers) and also the yield of finger millet, pigeonpea and peanut. Growing finger millet as an alley crop in between Gliricidia spaced 12 m apart considerably improved the yield of finger millet. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - At present, there is a need to supplement with leguminous foliage Pelibuey sheep. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the productive behavior of this species during lactation, supplemented with Leucaena leucocephala (Ll). The experiment covered a period of five months, 63 breeding animals were used. In the control group, the main source of protein was the concentrate, in the second and third were supplemented with 25 and 35%, respectively, of the aforementioned plant, distributed in a completely randomized design with three treatments according to the level of inclusion of the leguminous and three repetitions (seven animals for each one); The data were processed using a simple classification variance analysis. The indicators of live weight of the pups at weaning and breeding were evaluated at the beginning and end of lactation and milk production (MP). The results showed that the MP peak was in the fourth week with values of 1.30; 1.29 and 1.38 for treatments I; II and III, respectively, and began to fall in the octave to 16 (0.50, 0.50 and 0,49 L for I, II and III, respectively). It was concluded that feeding system with Leucaena leucocephala constitutes an efficient alternative in the nutrition of the sheep favoring the productive indicators at the end of lactation and of the weaned offspring.

AB  - Flavonoids are a group of metabolites in Ginkgo biloba thought to provide health benefits. R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) play key roles in the transcriptional regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis in plants. In this study, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor gene, GbMYBFL, was isolated from G. biloba and characterized. Results of bioinformatic analysis indicated that GbMYBFL is more closely related to the R2R3-MYB involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and displayed high similarity to MYB from other plants. The genmomic sequence of GbMYBFL had three exons and two introns, with its upstream sequence containing cis-acting regulatory elements Myb binding site, Myc recognition sites, and light, SA, MeJA responsive elements. Subcellular localization analysis indicates that GbMYBFL was located in the nucleus. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that GbMYBFL was expressed in leaves, stems, roots, young fruits, male flower and female flower, and the level of transcription in male flower and leaves were higher than that in female flower, stems, roots, and young fruits. During G. biloba leaf growth, the transcription of GbMYBFL is positively correlated with the flavonoid content, suggesting that the GbMYBFL is involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis. Overexpression of GbMYBFL under the control of the CaMV35S promoter in Ginkgo callus notably enhanced the accumulation of flavonoids and anthocyanin compared with non-transformed callus. This finding suggested that GbMYBFL positively related to flavonoid biosynthesis, and the overexpression of GbMYBFL was sufficient to induce flavonoids and anthocyanin accumulation. © 2017, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Forage sorghum, supplemented with meal concentrate or fresh leucaena on goat performance was studied, using 15 male crossbred Anglo-Nubian and Native goats. They were allocated into 3 treatments; Treatment 1: fresh forage sorghum with an amount of 2% (as fed basis) meal concentrate of animal body weight; Treatment 2: fresh forage sorghum with an amount of 1% (as fed basis) meal concentrate, and an amount of 1% fresh leucaena of animal body weight, and Treatment 3: fresh forage sorghum with an amount of 2% fresh leucaena of animal body weight, under the completely randomized design (CRD). The results showed that total dry matter intake was not significantly different among treatments. However, dry matter intake of forage sorghum was significantly different among treatments (p < 0.05), where the highest intake of roughage was found in treatment 3. Total crude protein intake was significantly different among treatments (p < 0.05), where the highest intake of crude protein was found in Treatment 1, affecting weight gain and average daily gain among treatments with significant difference (p < 0.05). The essential fatty acid contents of linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6; omega 6) and conjugated linoleic acid (C18:2 cis-9, trans-11, CLA) in the Longissimus dorsi muscle of goats were not significantly different while omega 3 fatty acid as linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3; omega 3) was significantly different among treatments (p < 0.05) where the highest amount (0.94 g/100 g fatty acid) was found in Treatment 3. © 2017, Walailak University.

AB  - The effect of three regrowth ages (4, 8 and 12 weeks) on forage yield, nutritional quality and fatty acid profile were evaluated in herbaceous legumes: Clitoria ternatea, Pueraria phaseoloides, Canavalia brasiliensis, Centrosema molle, Centrosema macrocarpum, Alysicarpus vaginalis, y Lablab purpureus; in shrubby legumes: Cratylia argentea, Gliricidia sepium, Desmodium velutinum, Cajanus cajan, Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae); and in a non-leguminous shrub: Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae). A split-plot design with random blocks was used, in which the forage species was the main plot and the regrowth age the subplot. The main fatty acids found in the species were palmitic acid (C16:0), linolenic acid (C18:3) and linoleic acid (C18:2). However, the fatty acid concentration differed between herbaceous and shrubby legumes compared to non-leguminous species, and decreased with regrowth age in both groups. The herbaceous legumes evaluated had a higher C18:2/C18:3 proportion than shrubby legumes, which could in turn result in a higher conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content in milk fat. The legume Cajanus cajan showed the highest (p<0.05) linolenic acid (C18:3) and CLA precursors content in the three regrowth ages evaluated, suggesting that its use as bovine feed in dual-purpose systems can result in higher c9 t11 CLA concentrations in milk fat compared to other species. © 2017 Corporación Colombiana de Investigación Agropecuaria.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala on dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility, nitrogen (N) balance and energy utilization in cattle fed a basal ration of Pennisetum purpureum and housed in metabolic crates. Five crossbred (Bos taurus × Bos indicus) heifers (BW: 295 ± 6 kg) were fed chopped P. purpureum grass and five increasing levels of L. leucocephala (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80% of DM) in a 5 × 5 Latin square design. The intake of DM was similar (P > 0.05) among treatments, with an average of 7.03 kg of DM/day. While the crude protein intake (CPI) linearly increased (P < 0.001) with the inclusion of L. leucocephala, the DM digestibility (average 492.3 g/kg DM) and OM digestibility (average 501.6 g/kg OM) were not affected (P > 0.05) by the incorporation of L. leucocephala into the ration. The N intake and excretion in the urine increased linearly (P = 0.0001, 0.0001) as the level of L. leucocephala in the ration increased. In addition, methane energy loss as a percentage of that in the control ration, was of only 61% (P = 0.0005) with 80% incorporation of L. leucocephala in the ration. We concluded that the inclusion of L. leucocephala has the capacity to reduce energy losses in the form of methane emissions. Nevertheless, the energy losses in the urine increased with the addition of L. leucocephala to the ration, with the optimal levels of incorporation in the ration fluctuating between 20 and 40% of the ration DM, which had no effects on the dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI) or the digestibility of dry matter (DMD). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of different levels of Leucaena leucocephala and Manihot esculenta leaves’ supplementation on in vitro gas production, rumen fermentation and microbial populations and urinary purine derivatives (PD) were investigated. Seven treatment groups – T1:C/rice straw (RS) (40:60) (Control); T2:C/RS/leucaena leaves (40:45:15); T3:C/RS/leucaena leaves (40:30:30); T4: C/RS/leucaena leaves (40:15:45); T5:C/RS/cassava leaves (40:45:15); T6:C/RS/cassava leaves (40:30:30) and T7:C/RS/cassava leaves (40:15:45) – were used in this experiment. In the in vitro study, acetate, propionate, butyrate and total VFA were found to increase significantly in T7. No significant difference was observed in in vitro gas production except the control diet although in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) was recorded significantly decreased. Determination of urinary PD, rumen fermentation and microbial population were done using 21 local Boer goats. Rumen NH3-N, acetic and total VFA production were found to improve (P <.05) in all supplemented group. Significant (P <.05) reduction was noted in the urinary allantoin production and total PD at T7. The populations of total protozoa and Ruminococcus flavefacien had significantly increased (P <.05) while Ruminococcus albus, and Fibrobacter succinogenes were significantly reduced (P <.05) in supplemented group. In conclusion, the result from the present study suggested that 25% of L. leucocephala leaves diet and 50% of M. esculenta leaves diet can be incorporated in the goat diet so as to improve the nutritive value of poor quality diet. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Some agricultural residues such as wheat or barley straw, as well as certain fast-growing plants like Leucaena leucocephala and Chamaecytisus proliferus, could be used as raw materials for the paper industry as an alternative to traditional plants (eucalyptus, pine, etc.). In the present study, four types of lignin obtained from the spent liquors produced by the pulping processes using the abovementioned feedstocks were isolated and characterized. Lignin samples were acquired through an acid precipitation from these spent liquors. The characterization of the precipitated lignin samples were performed using a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and both liquid- and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to analyse the chemical structure, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for determining the thermal properties. Additionally, chemical composition of lignin fractions was also measured. Even though they were of different botanical origin, all the studied samples except for wheat straw lignin had a similar chemical composition and thermal behaviour, and identical chemical structure. Wheat straw lignin showed a greater amount of Klason lignin and lower carbohydrate content. Furthermore, this lignin sample showed a higher thermal stability and significantly different cross-peak patterns in the 2D-NMR experiments. The molecular structures corresponding to p-coumarate (PCA), ferulate (FA) and cinnamyl aldehyde end-groups (J) were only detected in wheat isolated lignin. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of Leucaena leucocephala on the metastasis and invasion of human oral cancer cells

AB  - Oral cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and metastasis is recognized as a major factor causing its low survival rate. The inhibition of metastasis progress and the improvement of the survival rate for oral cancer are critical research objectives. Leucaena leucocephala from the mimosa branch Leucaena genus is native to Central and South America and has been used as a traditional remedy for treating various disorders. Previous studies have demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory as well as anticancer properties of L. leucocephala plant materials. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the anticancer effect induced by L. leucocephala remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of L. leucocephala extract (LLE) on SCC-9 and SAS oral cancer cells and examined the potential inhibitory mechanisms involved. The results indicated that LLE attenuated the migration and invasion abilities of both SCC-9 and SAS cells by reducing the activity and protein expression of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2). Regarding mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 exhibited a significant inhibitory effect in the presence of LLE. The application of ERK inhibitor and p38 inhibitor confirmed that both signalling transduction pathways were involved in the inhibition of cell metastasis. These data indicate that L. leucocephala could be a potent therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of oral cancer and a prominent plant source for anticancer research in the future. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In vitro study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of condensed tannins (CT) containing aqueous extract of Acacia nilotica, Eugenia jambolana, Ficus religiosa, Leucaena leucocephala and Psidium guajava. Antioxidant activity of CT extract was evaluated using in vitro methods which include 1, 1 Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and total reducing power activities and antibacterial activity was evaluated against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The results showed a varied level of DPPH radical scavenging and total reducing power activities. The extract of P. guajava showed the highest antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging and total reducing power activity), while F. religiosa and Leucaena leucocephala showed least antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activity increased with increasing the concentration of CT extracts. The CT extract of each source revealed antibacterial activity but the mean MIC and MBC values were found to be lower for P. guajava, E. jambolana and A. Nilotica as compared to F. religiosa and L. leucocephala. E. coli, S. aureus and S. enteritidis were more sensitive to CT extract which showed lower mean MIC and MBC valuese than that of E. faecalis. It was concluded that P. guajava leaf extract possess potent natural antioxidant and antibacterial activity against pathogenic E. coli, S. aureus and S. enteritidis. © 2017, Veterinary Practitioner.

AB  - Four rumen-fistulated male swamp buffaloes, 5-year-old with initiated live weight at 360 ± 12 kg, were randomly assigned according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design to investigate the effect of feeding high level of dried Leucaena leaf (DLL) on feed intake, fermentation efficiency and microbial protein synthesis. The dietary treatments were the feeding levels of DLL at 0, 2, 4 and 6 kg/head/day. All buffaloes were supplemented with concentrate mixtures at 0.1% of body weight, and rice straw was fed ad libitum with the availability of water and mineral block at all time. The results revealed that the total feed intake and nutrient digestibility were significantly improved with the increasing levels of DLL feeding, and the highest was in the buffaloes consuming DLL at 6 kg/head/day. Feeding high levels of DLL did not affect on ruminal pH and temperature, while ammonia nitrogen, blood urea nitrogen and volatile fatty acid concentration were significantly enhanced. Moreover, methane production was dramatically reduced by increasing levels of DLL feeding. Total direct counts of the micro-organism population were increased with the increasing levels of DLL feeding. According to the application of quantitative PCR to quantity cellulolytic bacteria (16S rRNA) targets, it was found that the population of total bacteria and Fibrobactor succinogenes was affected by treatments, while Ruminococcus flavefaciens and methanogen population were significantly decreased as buffaloes were fed with DLL. The nitrogen balance and microbial nitrogen supply were remarkably improved with the increasing levels of DLL feeding. Based on this study, it could be concluded that high levels of DLL feeding at 6 kg/head/day could enhance feed intake, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation efficiency and microbial protein synthesis in swamp buffaloes fed on rice straw without any adverse effect.

TI  - Biomass allocation in five semi-arid afforestation species is driven mainly by ontogeny rather than resource availability
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036514310&doi=10.1007%2fs13595-017-0676-4&partnerID=40&md5=5f0b32d9800a9de3b6ad9d671b6a2cdc
AB  - Key message: The changes in the relative biomass allocation to roots in juvenile stands of fast-growing (Leucaena leucocephalaLam.,Moringa oleiferaLam., andJatropha curcasL.) and slow-growing (Anacardium occidentaleL. andParkia biglobosaJacq.) afforestation species are driven mainly by ontogeny rather than resource availability. However, silvicultural management aiming at increasing availability of water and particularly nutrients enhances biomass production in all species. Context: Understanding the patterns of biomass allocation among tree species in response to ontogeny and to variation in resource availability is key to the successful restoration of degraded land using forest plantations. Aims: This study assessed the effects of resource availability and ontogeny on biomass accumulation and partitioning in five semi-arid afforestation species. Methods: The aboveground and belowground biomass production of fast-growing Leucaena leucocephala Lam., Moringa oleifera Lam., and Jatropha curcas L. and slow-growing Anacardium occidentale L. and Parkia biglobosa Jacq. was monitored following the application of manure (1 kg plant−1) and/or supplemental irrigation (0.5 L per sapling daily) during the first two rainy seasons and the intervening dry season on degraded cropland in Northern Benin. Results: Biomass accumulation in the fast-growing species was positively impacted by fertilization and irrigation during both rainy seasons. The slow-growing species responded positively to the silvicultural treatments during the dry and second rainy season. The application of fertilizer alone increased the biomass of P. biglobosa by up to 335% during the dry season. Fifteen months after planting, manure-treated L. leucocephala accumulated the most biomass (2.9 kg tree−1). The root fraction decreased with increasing tree size in all species. The comparison of root versus shoot allocation in trees of equal size indicated that the treatment-induced shifts in biomass partitioning were controlled by ontogeny, which explained 86–95% of the variation in root-shoot biomass relationships. Conclusion: While ontogeny was the main driver of biomass partitioning, increased resource availability induced a larger production of biomass, overall leading to greater aboveground production in all species. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Ensifer shofinae sp. nov., a novel rhizobial species isolated from root nodules of soybean (Glycine max)
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012255107&doi=10.1016%2fj.syapm.2017.01.002&partnerID=40&md5=bbae2afd745617a7afa5d06bcf658ab7
AB  - Two bacterial strains isolated from root nodules of soybean were characterized phylogenetically as members of a distinct group in the genus Ensifer based on 16S rRNA gene comparisons. They were also verified as a separated group by the concatenated sequence analyses of recA, atpD and glnII (with similarities ≤93.9% to the type strains for defined species), and by the average nucleotide identities (ANI) between the whole genome sequence of the representative strain CCBAU 251167T and those of the closely related strains in Ensifer glycinis and Ensifer fredii (90.5% and 90.3%, respectively). Phylogeny of symbiotic genes (nodC and nifH) grouped these two strains together with some soybean-nodulating strains of E. fredii, E. glycinis and Ensifer sojae. Nodulation tests indicated that the representative strain CCBAU 251167T could form root nodules with capability of nitrogen fixing on its host plant and Glycine soja, Cajanus cajan, Vigna unguiculata, Phaseolus vulgaris and Astragalus membranaceus, and it formed ineffective nodules on Leucaena leucocephala. Strain CCBAU 251167T contained fatty acids 18:1 ω9c, 18:0 iso and 20:0, differing from other related strains. Utilization of L-threonine and D-serine as carbon source, growth at pH 6.0 and intolerance of 1% (w/v) NaCl distinguished strain CCBAU 251167T from other type strains of the related species. The genome size of CCBAU 251167T was 6.2 Mbp, comprising 7,581 predicted genes with DNA G+C content of 59.9 mol% and 970 unique genes. Therefore, a novel species, Ensifer shofinae sp. nov., is proposed, with CCBAU 251167T (=ACCC 19939T = LMG 29645T) as type strain. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Sixteen (16) crossbred (White Fulani, Muturu & Keteku) calves aged 7-10 months and with an average weight of 69.78 ± 8.81 kg were sampled in a 12-week experiment to evaluate the response of calves to supplementation of legume - based concentrate diets. These calves graze on natural pastures. The sampled calves were allotted in a completely randomised design into four treatment groups and offered 25% Leucaena leucocephala, Enterolobium cyclocarpum and Glricidia sepium based concentrate diets and natural pastures (control) for treatments 1 - 4 respectively. Data were collected on feed intake, weight gain, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen balance, blood profile and faecal egg count of calves. The supplementation of forage legume concentrate diets improved (P < 0.05) DM intake and weight gain of calves with best results were observed in calves fed Glricidia sepium concentrate diets with 450.56 g/day and 188.45 g/day respectively. Nutrient digestibility (%) and nitrogen balance varied (P < 0.05) across treatment groups. Blood parameters did not differ (P > 0.05) across treatments and falls within the normal range for healthy calves, while the supplementation of forage legume concentrate diets reduced (P < 0.05) faecal egg count (egg/g) to ascertain the level of worm burden in calves. The study concluded that supplementation with legume concentrate diets improved the performance of calves with Gliricidia forage supplemented concentrate diet recommended for calves' optimum performance. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

TI  - Xanthine oxidase inhibitors from Archidendron clypearia (Jack.) I.C. Nielsen: Results from systematic screening of Vietnamese medicinal plants
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021305173&doi=10.1016%2fj.apjtm.2017.06.002&partnerID=40&md5=6347be6d5cd0f223a7ac5471a48151e0
AB  - Objective To screen Vietnamese medicinal plants for xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory activity and to isolate XO inhibitor(s) from the most active plant. Methods The plants materials were extracted by methanol. The active plant materials were fractionated using different organic solvents, including n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. Bioassay-guided fractionation and column chromatography were used to isolate compounds. The compounds structures were elucidated by analysis of spectroscopic data, including IR, MS, and NMR. Results Three hundreds and eleven methanol extracts (CME) belonging to 301 Vietnamese herbs were screened for XO inhibitory activity. Among these plants, 57 extracts displayed XO inhibitory activity at 100 μg/mL with inhibition rates of over 50%. The extracts of Archidendron clypearia (A. clypearia), Smilax poilanei, Linociera ramiflora and Passiflora foetida exhibited the greatest potency with IC50 values below 30 μg/mL. Chemical study performed on the extract of A. clypearia resulted in the isolation of six compounds, including 1-octacosanol, docosenoic acid, daucosterol, methyl gallate, quercitrin and (−)-7-O-galloyltricetiflavan. The compound (−)-7-O-galloyltricetiflavan showed the most potent XO inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 25.5 μmol/L. Conclusions From this investigation, four Vietnamese medicinal plants were identified to have XO inhibitory effects with IC50 values of the methanol extracts below 30 μg/mL. Compound (−)-7-O- galloyltricetiflavan was identified as an XO inhibitor from A. clypearia with IC50 value of 25.5 μmol/L. © 2017 Hainan Medical University

TI  - Effects of dietary Kleinhovia hospita and Leucaena leucocephala leaves on rumen fermentation and microbial population in goats fed treated rice straw
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028578351&doi=10.1007%2fs11250-017-1388-3&partnerID=40&md5=c0acc0c62a8b4f9221ac62858b2aa5a5
AB  - The effects of partial replacement of dietary protein by forages on rumen fermentation and microbiology in goats were examined. Four fistulated Boer bucks were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. The goats were fed 60% of urea-treated rice straw and 40% dietary treatment (Kleinhovia hospita (KH), Leucaena leucocephala (LL), mixture of K. hospita with L. leucocephala (KHLL)) and concentrate as the control. Rumen fluid from the animals was collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 12 h postprandial for analysis. The KHLL diet had a greater (P < 0.05) molar proportion of acetate than the control diet throughout the sampling period. At 6 h postprandial, the KHLL goats had a significantly lower (P < 0.05) ammonia nitrogen than the goats fed other diets. The molar proportion of propionate (24.7 and 25.8 mol/100 mol) was greater in the rumen of KHLL goats compared with those fed other diets at 2 and 12 h postprandial, respectively. The KHLL diet had lower (P < 0.05) butyrate than other dietary treatments. At 4 h postprandial, the control goats had a lower (P < 0.05) population of total bacteria while the KHLL goats had a greater (P < 0.05) population at 4 and 12 h postprandial compared with those fed other diets. The LL, KH, and KHLL goats had lower (P < 0.05) populations of protozoa and methanogens and a greater (P < 0.05) population of Ruminococcus albus compared with the control goats. The KHLL leaves could be fed to goats without compromising rumen metabolism. © 2017, The Author(s).

TI  - Effect of thermocapillary stress on slip length for a channel textured with parallel ridges
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011692289&doi=10.1017%2fjfm.2017.8&partnerID=40&md5=37a41800b91e956bdcf45a538d573da8
AB  - We compute the apparent hydrodynamic slip length for (laminar and fully developed) Poiseuille flow of liquid through a heated parallel-plate channel. One side of the channel is textured with parallel (streamwise) ridges and the opposite one is smooth. On the textured side of the channel, the liquid is in the Cassie state. No-slip and constant heat flux boundary conditions are imposed at the solid-liquid interfaces along the tips of the ridges, and the menisci between ridges are considered to be flat and adiabatic. The smooth side of the channel is subjected to no-slip and adiabatic boundary conditions. We account for the streamwise and transverse thermocapillary stresses along menisci. When the latter is sufficiently small, Stokes flow may be assumed. Then, our solution is based upon a conformal map. When, additionally, the ratio of channel height to half of the ridge pitch is of order 1 or larger, an accurate but less cumbersome solution follows from a matched asymptotic expansion. When inertial effects are relevant, the slip length is numerically computed. Setting the thermocapillary stress equal to zero yields the slip length for an adiabatic flow. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Indonesia is one of the richest countries with respect to plants resources. People from various ethnic, language, and religious groups have used the plants as alternative medicines, health foods and beverages for hundreds of years. To establish modern application for these understudied plant resources, ethnopharmacological data from more than 40 leguminous plants in Indonesia, spanning the western to the eastern parts of the Indonesian archipelago, were reviewed. In particular, bioactive secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, were described in detail to promote research into these plants as functional foods, nutraceuticals, and medicines.

TI  - The sequestration and turnover of soil organic carbon in subtropical leucaena-grass pastures
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026353190&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2017.07.020&partnerID=40&md5=48d3a1d0a9f8c4fcc378c236c52732e9
AB  - The sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural systems has the potential to partially mitigate climate change by removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Furthermore, incorporating forage legumes into a grazing system may aid in C storage, as mature unfertilized pasture soils are typically nitrogen (N) limited. Leucaena leucocephala, a leguminous shrub, is often incorporated into grazing systems to provide a source of protein for cattle production. Additionally, leucaena improves the N fertility of grazing lands. Despite this, there is limited research on the C and N dynamics beneath leucaena-grass pastures, particularly at depth in the soil profile (1 m). We assessed the potential of leucaena to sequester SOC by estimating the origin (C3 or C4), quantity and vertical distribution of SOC stocks. A chronosequence of seasonally grazed leucaena stands (0, 9, 22, 34, 40 years) were sampled for organic C and natural δ13C abundance. Pasture type affected SOC stocks within the upper 0.2 m (grass < leucaena mid-row = leucaena row). SOC stocks were also affected by leucaena stand age. In the 0–0.3 m zone, SOC increased by 17–30% over 40 years, equating to a sequestration rate of 280 kg ha−1 year−1. Soil δ13C values were depleted below the C3 leucaena rows (−16‰) compared to the C4 grass pasture (−13‰). However, the majority of SOC displayed a C4[sbnd]C signature. Hence, SOC sequestration primarily occurred due to N accretion by leucaena (36 kg N ha−1 year−1) contributing to the increased C4 grass productivity, humus formation and slowed SOC decomposition. Therefore, there is a need to maintain soil fertility in grazed pastures to ensure SOC stocks are accreted and conserved. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aims of this study were to evaluate forage production and nutritional quality of the elephant grass, leucaena and pigeon pea beans, grown in monocrop or in intercropping systems in Cerrado/Pantanal ecotones in both, dry and rainy, seasons. Experimental design was completely randomized with five treatments and five repetitions. The treatments were: elephant grass, leucaena and pigeon pea all of these in monocrop; intercropping elephant grass with Leucaena; intercropping elephant grass with pigeon pea. During the rainy season, it was carried out three cuts at intervals of 60 days, and in the dry season a single cut with 180 days. In the rainy season, the biomass produced of the forages elephant grass, leucaena and pigeon pea corresponded respectively to 72, 64, 76% of the annual production. Under intercropping system, fodder behaves similarly, with the average of 72% of annual production. During this period, the nutritional quality of the forages was also higher than the dry season. In the dry period, there was decreased the production of biomass and a reduction in the proportion of leaves in all the forage, regardless of cultivation system. In both seasons (rainy and dry), the forage grown under intercropping system showed higher dry matter production in relation to monocrop system, with most of this production coming of elephant grass. The intercropping elephant grass with the pigeon pea has the highest production of dry matter, while the intercropping elephant grass with Leucaena has better nutritional quality. © 2017, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia.

AB  - Traditional literature on regional flora and important values was used to select the flora and important values for this research. Usually, the research design for such studies is to first analyze the composition of flora in the region and then analyze the important value of a dominant species in the regional flora. However, such design is not intuitive enough and cannot fully reflect the different flora of different species in the community composition and participate in community building, such as defects. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, we calculated the species community index for woody plants in the natural seasonal forests in Leizhou Peninsula.The data were obtained from different areas of eight fixed natural forest plots in Leizhou Peninsula. The species community indexes were calculated, with plant floristic composition and important values, to analyze the plant community composition for the plots. (1) The Yunjiao village and Huguang area in Zhanjiang, Yingfeng ridge and Zurong village in Leizhou, Shuangyang village in Xuwen, and Gaoqiao village and Xiexie mountain in Lianjiang showed a dominant tropical flora distribution, with species community indexes greater than 0.8. The Genzhuzhang mountain peak in Lianjiang was a unique location, in that the dominant species were from flora 9, with species community index close to 0.5.(2)The species community index of flora 2 in the Huguang area in Zhanjiang was the highest (0.4261), with Leucaena leucocephala and Celtis sinensis as the dominant species. The flora 3 and flora 6 species were at a disadvantage in the species community. The species community index of flora 4 was at a dominant position in the community, with the highest value of 0.3339 and olive as the dominant species. Flora 5 was also in a dominant position, with the highest species community index of 0. 3787 and Cinnamomum burmannii and Cinnamomum bodinieri as the dominant species. The tree species distribution of flora 7 in the Leizhou Peninsula community was more balanced and generally adapted to the various plots. Our research showed that the Leizhou Peninsula showed distinct tropical flora characteristics. The species community index can better reflect community characteristics of the floristic species in the plant community composition. © 2017, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.

TI  - A safe, efficient and environment friendly biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using Leucaena leucocephala seed extract and its antioxidant, antimicrobial, antifungal activities and potential in sensing
PY  - 2017

AB  - One step green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from silver nitrate (AgNO3) using Leucaena leucocephala seeds extract as the reducing agent at room temperature was performed. The bioreduced NPs were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. Qualitative information of major components in the seed extract was obtained through its phytochemical screening. The phytochemical data of L. leucocephala revealed the presence of terpenes, flavonoids, coumarins and sterols. The reaction was optimized for AgNO3, extract concentration and time duration for the reaction. The obtained NPs showed a characteristic UV peak of AgNPs at 420 nm. TEM and SEM images showed the spherical shaped NPs over which the extract coating was very prominent. The binding of L. leucocephala seeds extract onto NPs was tested using FTIR and TGA. The antifungal activity of the as-synthesized NPs against two fungal species, namely Phlebiopsis gigantea and Echinodontium taxodii, was studied. The antimicrobial effect of the as-synthesized NPs was ascertained against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The antioxidant potential of the AgNPs was tested with 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging. Also, the sensitivity of the NPs towards Fe3+ ions was tested in aqueous media. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.

AB  - Lignin, an abundant plant biopolymer, is known to possess antioxidant and UV protectant properties in its native state. Nanoparticles exhibit either improved or different properties corresponding to their bulk materials or parent polymers. In the present study, using nanoprecipitation method, dioxane lignin nanoparticles (DLNP) and alkali lignin nanoparticles (ALNP) are fabricated from two different sources of lignin, i.e., hardwood dioxane lignin (DL) extracted from subabul stems and softwood alkali lignin (AL) which is available as a commercial source. Both DLNP and ALNP were fabricated in spherical shape with mean size of 80–104 nm. Analysis of radical scavenging activity revealed that both DLNP and ALNP possess higher antioxidant activity when compared with their parent polymers DL and AL, respectively. UV protectant potential of DLNP and ALNP was validated by monitoring the survival rates of Escherichia coli upon UV-induced mortality. DLNP and ALNP were more efficient than DL and AL in protecting E. coli against UV-irradiation-induced mortality. However, upon irradiation for different time periods, DLNP offered pronounced protection for E. coli against UV when compared with ALNP. Thus, the present study demonstrates that the antioxidant and UV protection properties of DLNP can be exploited further in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Modulatory effects of condensed tannin fractions of different molecular weights from a Leucaena leucocephala hybrid on the bovine rumen bacterial community in vitro
PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84982091386&doi=10.1002%2fjsfa.7674&partnerID=40&md5=eb57257276dadafb800a6d0819c0f3d2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Condensed tannin (CT) fractions of different molecular weights (MWs) may affect rumen microbial metabolism by altering bacterial diversity. In this study the effects of unfractionated CTs (F0) and five CT fractions (F1-F5) of different MWs (F1, 1265.8 Da; F2, 1028.6 Da; F3, 652.2 Da; F4, 562.2 Da; F5, 469.6 Da) from Leucaena leucocephala hybrid-Rendang (LLR) on the structure and diversity of the rumen bacterial community were investigated in vitro.; RESULTS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay showed that the total bacterial population was not significantly (P > 0.05) different among the dietary treatments. Inclusion of higher-MW CT fractions F1 and F2 significantly (P < 0.05) increased the Fibrobacter succinogenes population compared with F0 and CT fractions F3-F5. Although inclusion of F0 and CT fractions (F1-F5) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the Ruminococcus flavefaciens population, there was no effect on the Ruminococcus albus population when compared with the control (without CTs). High-throughput sequencing of the V3 region of 16S rRNA showed that the relative abundance of genera Prevotella and unclassified Clostridiales was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased, corresponding with increasing MW of CT fractions, whereas cellulolytic bacteria of the genus Fibrobacter were significantly (P < 0.05) increased. Inclusion of higher-MW CT fractions F1 and/or F2 decreased the relative abundance of minor genera such as Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, Clostridium XIVa and Anaeroplasma but increased the relative abundance of Acinetobacter, Treponema, Selenomonas, Succiniclasticum and unclassified Spirochaetales compared with the control and lower-MW CT fractions.; CONCLUSION: This study indicates that CT fractions of different MWs may play an important role in altering the structure and diversity of the rumen bacterial community in vitro, and the impact was more pronounced for CT fractions with higher MW. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Predicted range expansion of the invasive plant Leucaena leucocephala in the Hengchun peninsula, Taiwan
PY  - 2016

AB  - We integrated correlative (species distribution) and process-based (agent-based) modeling approaches—to predict future range expansion of an invasive plant (Leucaena leucocephala) in the lowland rainforest and tropical coastal forest ecosystems of the Hengchun peninsula, Taiwan. We simulated range expansion to the year 2027 using a spatially-explicit, agent-based model representing invasion rate as a function of habitat quality and propagule pressure. We developed an index of habitat quality by relating 1988 plant distribution data to geo-referenced data on climatic conditions, landscape features, and anthropogenic factors via logistic regression. We represented propagule pressure using a lognormal dispersal kernel. We evaluated model performance by simulating range expansion from 1988 to 2007 and comparing simulated distribution patterns to those observed in 2007. Results of logistic regression indicated that L. leucocephala is more likely to occur in warm, dry areas containing a higher percentage of natural landscape (forest or grassland), areas adjacent to the forest edge, and areas disturbed by human activities such as a main road or an abandoned sisal plantation. Model evaluation showed that the prediction performance is excellent with AUC > 0.9 and Mantel’s r = 0.77. Our results indicated that L. leucocephala will continue from the western portion toward the southern and central portions of Checheng township, and throughout the southern portion of Hengchun and Manjhou townships, with about 2500 ha of new area invaded within the next 20 years. Our predictions should allow managers to develop proactive management plans for the areas most likely to be invaded. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Milk yield and blood urea nitrogen in crossbred cows grazing Leucaena leucocephala in a silvopastoral system in the Mexican tropics
PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028708482&doi=10.17138%2fTGFT%284%29159-167&partnerID=40&md5=f46f0c30ee20360822c902945a66641c
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess milk yields, estimate the intake of crude protein (CP) and determine the concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in early post-partum crossbred cows grazing irrigated Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) in a silvopastoral system relative to those in an irrigated grass monoculture. Twenty-four multiparous cows were randomly allotted at calving on the basis of previous milk yields to 2 grazing treatments: grass monoculture system (MS) of Cynodon nlemfuensis (n=12); and an intensive silvopastoral system (ISS) composed of leucaena and C. nlemfuensis (n=12). Cows were supplemented with sorghum grain (ISS) or a conventional concentrate (MS) during milking to ensure availability of metabolizable energy (ME) and CP required for milk production. Mean estimated intake of leucaena was 5.1±1.3 kg DM/d and estimated CP intakes were 1,479±3.3 and 1,258±3.3 g/d for ISS and MS, respectively (P > 0.05), while estimated intakes of ME were 161±1.3 and 131±1.4 MJ/d for ISS and MS, respectively (P < 0.05). Milk yields were 13.5 and 14.5 kg/cow/d for cows on ISS and MS, respectively (P > 0.05). Concentrations of BUN were 19.1 mg/dL for cows in ISS and 15.3 mg/dL for cows in MS (P < 0.05). We conclude that intake of leucaena and sorghum grain in an irrigated silvopastoral system was sufficient to substitute for expensive concentrate in the diets of lactating cows grazing irrigated grass monoculture. However, the higher levels of BUN found in ISS suggest a lower efficiency of N utilization in this treatment. Restricting consumption of leucaena might be a means of improving efficiency of its use and this warrants investigation. © 2016.

TI  - Nutritive value of common tree leaves for livestock in the semi-arid and arid rangelands of Northern Pakistan
PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957601925&doi=10.1016%2fj.livsci.2015.12.009&partnerID=40&md5=045a95be1d8607d23261d920ba0fbe1d
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a database on nutrients and mineral profile, in vitro dry matter digestibility (DMD) and in situ ruminal degradability characteristics of leaves from 21 fodder tree species commonly fed to livestock in semi-arid and arid zones of Northern Pakistan. Leaves from 13 fodder tree species: Albizia lebbeck, Ailanthus altissima, Bauhinia variegata, Butea frondosa, Celtis australis, Ficus carica, Grewia oppositifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Mallotus philippensis, Melia azedarach, Morus alba, Morus papyrifera and Ziziphus mauritiana were sampled from semi-arid zone. Leaves from 8 fodder tree species: Acacia modesta, A. lebbeck, Capparis aphylla, Olea cuspidata, Prosopis juliflora, Tecomella undulata, Ziziphus jujuba and Ziziphus mauritiana were sampled from arid zone. Within each ecological zone, leaves of each tree species were collected at four sub-locations, from three randomly selected trees. The results showed a large variation in the concentration of all measured chemical components, DMD and ruminal degradation characteristics among the tree species. The contents of crude protein (CP) varied from 8.76% (T. undulata) to 24.0% (M. alba); ash from 7.41% (O. cuspidata) to 22.4% (C. australis); and neutral detergent fibre from 20.6 (L. leucocephala) to 56.5% (C. aphylla). Except for T. undulata, leaves from all tree species had CP content of >10%, and 60% of the species had leaves with >15% CP, demonstrating that leaves from majority of tree species can be used as low-cost CP supplement. The mineral composition revealed that, except for C. aphylla, leaves from all tree species were rich sources of Ca, whilst most of the species were deficient in P, Na and Cu. The DMD of the majority (66%) of tree leaves were <50.0%, ranging from 33.1% (M. philippensis) to 67.6% (M. alba). The in situ data further showed that a large fraction of ruminal degradable dry matter was instantaneously degraded (soluble). The potentially rumen degradable (D) fraction and rate of degradation (kd) was highly variable, ranging from 0.234 to 0.958 and 0.026 to 0.99/h, respectively. The effective ruminal dry matter degradability (EDDM) was higher than the in vitro DMD, ranging from 0.34 to 0.84, at an outflow rate of 0.05/h. This information on nutrients and mineral profile, in vitro DMD and in situ ruminal degradability characteristics of leaves from 21 fodder tree species, obtained under well replicated and uniform experimental conditions can be used to optimize diet formulation in terms of nutrients supply to the animals that will ensure better utilization of this nutrients-rich feed resource and will increase economic profitability of subsistence livestock farmers in the region. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Soil quality index for evaluation of reclaimed coal mine spoil
PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84945571046&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2015.10.035&partnerID=40&md5=ec91b3bceb97063ac983865cc8715368
AB  - Success in the remediation of mine spoil depends largely on the selection of appropriate tree species. The impacts of remediation on mine soil quality cannot be sufficiently assessed by individual soil properties. However, combination of soil properties into an integrated soil quality index provides a more holistic status of reclamation potentials of tree species. Remediation potentials of four tree species (Acacia auriculiformis, Cassia siamea, Dalbergia sissoo, and Leucaena leucocephala) were studied on reclaimed coal mine overburden dumps of Jharia coalfield, Dhanbad, India. Soil samples were collected under the canopies of the tree species. Comparative studies on the properties of soils in the reclaimed and the reference sites showed improvements in soil quality parameters of the reclaimed site: coarse fraction (- 20.4%), bulk density (- 12.8%), water holding capacity (+ 0.92%), pH (+ 25.4%), EC (+ 2.9%), cation exchange capacity (+ 46.6%), organic carbon (+ 91.5%), N (+ 60.6%), P (+ 113%), K (+ 19.9%), Ca (+ 49.6%), Mg (+ 12.2%), Na (+ 19.6%), S (+ 46.7%), total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (- 71.4%), dehydrogenase activity (+ 197%), and microbial biomass carbon (+ 115%). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify key mine soil quality indicators to develop a soil quality index (SQI). Selected indicators include: coarse fraction, pH, EC, soil organic carbon, P, Ca, S, and dehydrogenase activity. The indicator values were converted into a unitless score (0-1.00) and integrated into SQI. The calculated SQI was significantly (P. <. 0.001) correlated with tree biomass and canopy cover. Reclaimed site has 52-93% higher SQI compared to the reference site. Higher SQI values were obtained for sites reclaimed with D. sissoo (+ 93.1%) and C. siamea (+ 86.4%). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Formulation of Fish Feed with Optimum Protein-bound Lysine for African Catfish (Clarias Gariepinus) Fingerlings
PY  - 2016

AB  - Earthworm powder is a potential source of lysine, a first limiting amino acid which is essential in fish diet. The incorporation of other feed ingredients with acceptable composition of lysine can help to enhance lysine content in fish feeds. The focus of this study is to optimize lysine content in fish feeds with difference percentages of each selected feeds ingredients. The optimization study was conducted using central composite design (CCD) as statistical tool. The optimum lysine content was obtained at 25.00%, 20.88%, 10.00% and 20.00% of earthworm powder, soybean waste, leucaena leucocephala leaves and fish meal, respectively. The lysine content in formulated fish feeds was significantly affected by the composition of earthworm powder and fish meal in fish feed formulation. Earthworm powder and fish meal have contributed the largest portion of lysine in fish feed due to high lysine content which were 4.48% w/w and 3.60% w/w, respectively. The optimized fish feed shows high lysine content of 23.39% w/w which doubles the lysine content in commercial fish feed (11.21% w/w). The composition of fish feed obtained from this study can be used as guidelines for formulation of high lysine fish feeds for African catfish fingerlings. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Nitrogen-use efficiency can be enhanced through an understanding of the nitrogen (N) mineralization behavior of organic sources. An incubation study was conducted to assess the impact of organic manures on N mineralization. The manures, farmyard manure (FYM), Leucaena leucocephala, and poultry manure, were applied to the soil alone or along with urea. There was a rapid increase in the amount of mineral N released with a peak appearing either at 14 days (+urea treatments) or 21 days (manure only) of aerobic incubation. Thereafter the net N mineralized decreased gradually and levelled off beyond day 56. Overall the cumulative net N mineralized after 98 days of incubation was in the order urea > Leucaena + urea > poultry manure + urea > FYM + urea > Leucaena > poultry manure > FYM > zero N. The potentially mineralizable N (N0) was lower in treatments where urea was not applied. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Evaluation of soil anti-erodibility at different ages of Leucaena leucocephala forests in the area with high-frequency debris flow
PY  - 2016

AB  - Soil anti-erodibility is one of the important parameters for evaluating the ability of soil resistance to soil erosion. Aiming to understand the effect of vegetation restoration on soil erosion durability in the area with high-frequency debris flow, we determined the soil anti-erodibility at different ages of Leucaena leucocephala forests by using principal component analysis based on the data collected from the field and analyzed in the laboratory. The results showed that: 1) as the age of L. leucocephala forest increased, soil permeability, structure stability and soil nutrient decreased except for the content of fine particle; 2) the comprehensive indexes of soil anti-erodibility followed the rule as 10 a > 16 a > 27 a, indicating that the soil anti-erodibility decreased with forest age in Jiangjia gully; 3) according to Pearson's correlations, all the 13 anti-erodibility indicators could be simplified to 5 indicators which were soil density, maximum water-holding capacity, the content of water-stable aggregates at size > 0.25 mm, clay content and silt content. Taking 5 selected indicators (X) as independent variables and soil anti- erodibility indicator (Y) as dependent variable, the soil anti-erodibility model was built by linear regression analysis as Y =-8.691X1 +0.054X2 +0.700X3-0.425X4-0.189X5-12.511. This result could provide a reference for the building of soil anti-erodibility assessment indicator system and its future research in the area with high-frequency debris flow. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Forestry University.

TI  - Ethnopharmacological appraisal of culturally important medicinal plants and polyherbal formulas used against communicable diseases in Rodrigues Island
PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84996607129&doi=10.1016%2fj.jep.2016.10.041&partnerID=40&md5=4313e0ab4edc802a5217ae21777f2027
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance The tropical island of Rodrigues is one of three islands that constitute the Mascarene archipelago in the Indian Ocean. Currently considered as a biodiversity hotspot, the island has also a resilient history in the use of traditional medicine. However, there has been no ethnopharmacological study to document quantitatively such traditional practice against communicable diseases (CD), which currently accounts for 6.61% annual death and 30.7% attendances in public hospitals. The aim of the present study was to collect, analyse, and document traditionally used medicinal plants (MP) and polyherbal formulas from key informants and traditional medicine practitioners (TMP) in Rodrigues to treat and/or manage common CD. Materials and methods Data was collected via face-to-face interviews with MP users (n=113) and TMP (n=9) from 17 key sites. Seven quantitative ethnopharmacological indices, namely family use value (FUV), use value (UV), informant agreement ratio (IAR), relative frequency of citation (RFC), fidelity level (FL), relative importance (RI), and ethnobotanicity index (EI) were calculated. Results Ninety-seven plants belonging to 49 families were recorded to be in common use as monotherapy (80 plants) and/or as part of polyherbal preparation (23 plants) for the treatment and/or management of 16 different CD. Thirteen MPs were found to have a maximum FL of 100% for CD. The highest IAR (0.98) was observed for diseases of the eye and adnexa and skin and subcutaneous tissue. The highest FUV was for Arecaceae. Ayapana triplinervis (Vahl) R.M. king et H.Rob. scored the highest UV (UV=2.72). Seven endemic medicinal plants have been recorded to be employed in cultural rituals for the management of common CDs, whereas 14 polyherbal preparations were used to treat and/or manage 6 different types of CDs. Side effects were also reported following use of some these medicinal plants. Conclusion Given the dearth of updated information on traditional medicine from Rodrigues, this work has provided an opportunity to establish valuable primary information on the different MP used by the local people. Further research is needed to probe into the possible active constituents that could open new perspectives for further pharmacological research and hence be the basis of an evidence-based investigation to discover new drugs. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

AB  - The use of plant materials as soil amendments is an uncommon practice amongst major farming communities in Ghana, although it is necessary for soil fertility improvement. An examination of the effects of soil amendments is necessary to encourage the use of under-utilized organic resources in Ghana. Thus, a field experiment was conducted using 8 different tropical plant materials mixed with chicken manure as soil amendments for growth of tomato as a test crop. The plant materials included Leucaena leucocephala, Centrosema pubescens, Sesbania sesban, Gliricidia sepium, Mucuna pruriens, Pueraria phaseoloides, Azadirachta indica, and Theobroma cacao. There were two other treatments: one with equivalent amounts of chemical fertilizers and the other with no-fertilizer input (control). Plant materials were mixed with chicken manure to obtain a uniform carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio of 5:1. Except the no-fertilizer control, all treatments received the same amount of nitrogen (N). To clarify the decomposition pattern of the plant materials in soil, an incubation experiment was conducted using only the plant materials before the field experiment. The Gliricidia treatment released significantly more mineral N than the other plant materials in the incubation experiment. However, the tomato fruit yield was not enhanced in the Gliricidia treatment in the field experiment. The known quality parameters of the tested plant materials, such as total N, total carbon (C), C:N ratio, and total polyphenols, had minimal effects on their mineralization dynamics. Azadirachta showed the best synergistic effect with chicken manure through significantly increasing soil microbial biomass and fruit yield of tomato. This result provides insights into the possible adoption of Azadirachta in combination with chicken manure as a soil amendment in small-scale agricultural holdings. © 2016 Soil Science Society of China.

AB  - Rapid growth of non-linear loads in distribution network has attracted power system engineers' attention from power quality point of view. Electric arc furnace (EAF) is one of the typical industrial non-linear loads responsible for deteriorating the power quality in the distribution network by introducing harmonics, propagating voltage flicker and causing unbalance in voltages and currents. Therefore, the EAF model is required to be studied and the power quality required to be analyzed in the distribution network. This paper presents a novel time domain EAF model to study power quality problems. The proposed model is a combination of two previous EAF models called-exponential and hyperbolic model-using transition functions. The functioning of the proposed model has been validated by comparing its various performance characteristics with the existing Cassie-Mayr's EAF model and with real measured data available. Current harmonics, voltage harmonics along with voltage flickers are considered as power quality problems for study and analysis. Simulation is carried out in SIMULINK/MATLAB environment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rice fields provide not only a staple food but are also bio-diverse and multi-functional ecosystems. Wild food plants are important elements of biodiversity in rice fields and are critical components to the subsistence of poor farmers. The spatial and seasonal distribution of wild food plants were analysed across different sub-systems occurring within paddy ecosystems in two adjacent rice farming villages in Kalasin, Northeast Thailand. Data were collected in 102 sampling sites corresponding to seven sub-systems including tree rows, mounds, field margins, shelters, ponds, pond margins and levees. Frequency of occurrence and absolute abundance were quantified for each species in the two seasons of two years, and data on uses of wild food plant species were collected through focus group discussions. A total of 42 species from 28 botanical families were reported, and one third of these have been classified as weeds of rice by other authors. Results show that species abundance, frequency of occurrence and diversity varied seasonally and spatially within paddy rice ecosystems. Higher diversity indexes were observed in the monsoon in most sub-systems. The most diverse sub-systems in the monsoon were shelters, mounds and pond margins, and tree rows and mounds in the dry season. Field margins, ponds and levees presented lower diversity, but are habitat of aquatic species important for the local diet, such as Ipomoea aquatica and Marsilea crenata. The herbs Lobelia sp. and Glinus oppositifolius, classified as rice weeds, were most abundant species in the dry season and frequently consumed. Leucaena leucocephala, of which the roots, leaves and fruits are commonly consumed as vegetable, was the most abundant tree in most sub-systems. More than half of the species were specific to one or two sub-systems due to particular niche requirements. Three quarters of wild food plant species had additional uses besides food; with ten different types of use and multiple use categories occurring in the different sub-systems. This study highlights that the development of more productive lowland rice systems may jeopardize the diversity of wild food plant species in the rice landscape, which is important for the food security of the rural poor. © 2016 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences

AB  - Heterologous expression of eukaryotic genes in bacterial system is an important method in synthetic biology to characterize proteins. It is a widely used method, which can be sometimes quite challenging, as a number of factors that act along the path of expression of a transgene to mRNA, and mRNA to protein, can potentially affect the expression of a transgene in a heterologous system. Here, we describe a method for successful cloning and expression of mimosinase-encoding gene from Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) in E. coli as the heterologous host. Mimosinase is an important enzyme especially in the context of metabolic engineering of plant secondary metabolite as it catalyzes the degradation of mimosine, which is a toxic secondary metabolite found in all Leucaena and Mimosa species. We also describe the methods used for characterization of the recombinant mimosinase. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.

AB  - The effect was evaluated of energy supplementation with ground maize grain on the performance and behaviour of Anglo-Nubian goats under a silvopastoral system of leucena and tropical grasses. The experiment was carried out in an area of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit.) intercropped with a herbaceous layer having a predominance of tropical grasses (Tifton 85, Andropogon and Guinea). A completely randomised design with four treatments and five replications was adopted. Growing goats were used; the control group being fed only on pasture, and the other groups supplemented with ground maize at 0.5, 0.9 and 1.3% of live weight. Supplementation reduced grazing time and increased rumination and idle time; although the goats spent approximately 85% of the time grazing on grasses, indicating a preference for this forage. Energy supplementation increased the weight gain per animal per unit area. Under a silvopastoral system of leucaena and tropical grasses, goats prefer the grasses, however, grazing on the legume results in a protein intake that justifies additional energy input. The supplementation of goats under a silvopastoral system of tropical grasses and leucaena, with maize as an energy source at a rate of up to 1.3% of live weight, influences feeding behaviour, having a favourable effect on animal performance.

AB  - Lignin biodegradation potential of Schizophyllum commune Fr. is studied by using sound wood blocks of Ailanthus excelsa, Azadirachta indica, Tectona grandis, Eucalyptus sp. and Leucaena leucocephala. Initially, in vitro wood decay test showed minor weight loss, but it became rapid after one month. After 120 days of incubation, weight loss was minimum in T. grandis (24.05%) whereas it was maximum in A. excelsa (34.44%). Treated test blocks were characterised by enlargement of pits on ray cell wall, formation of additional boreholes in rays, separation of fibres and cell wall thinning and formation of ‘U’-shape notches. Fungal hyphae moved through the xylem cell lumen, and intercellular spaces formed in response to separation of fibres. Hyphae traverse in adjacent cell through the cell wall pits or by making additional boreholes. In all the species studied, xylem fibres and parenchyma (axial and ray) cells were more susceptible while vessels were resistant to fungal attack. In advanced stage of decay, fibres and axial parenchyma lost their rigidity while vessel walls showed uneven thinning. In the tension wood, G-fibres remained unaffected initially but loosening and separation of gelatinous layer facilitated fungal action and showed similar pattern of cell wall deterioration. Among the wood of different species studied, Tectona was more resistant whereas Ailanthus was more susceptible to fungal attack. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A survey of the productivity and nutritional status of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata) pastures of different ages was conducted in subtropical Queensland from 2006 to 2008. Four leucaena stands (aged 8, 20, 31 and 38 years) growing on the same Vertosol soil type at Brian Pastures Research Station were surveyed. In the higher rainfall season of 2007-2008, leucaena yields and rainfall-use efficiency were highest in 8-year-old stands [2128 kg total dry matter (DM)/ha or 4.0 kg DM/ha.mm] and lowest in 38-year-old stands (978 kg total DM/ha or 1.9 kg DM/ha.mm). The reduced productivity in the 38-year-old leucaena pasture was associated with a decline in stem number/plant and leucaena plant density due to observed plant mortality. The reduced yield and vigour of aging leucaena was associated with nitrogen deficiency related to declining phosphorus and sulfur availability for adequate symbiotic N2 fixation and leucaena plant growth. Nutrient deficiencies of phosphorus and sulfur in leaf tissue were related to low to medium initial soil fertility (7-27 mg/kg of bicarbonate extractable phosphorus in the top 20 cm), coupled with inherent subsoil constraints (shallow soils, sodicity and high pH), and exacerbated by both long-term removal of nutrients by grazing animals and a reduction in soil phosphorus and sulfur availability over time. To maintain the productivity of leucaena pastures, plant nutritional status needs to be monitored in order to determine strategic fertiliser application. © CSIRO 2016.

TI  - Effects of condensed tannin fractions of different molecular weights on population and diversity of bovine rumen methanogenic archaea in vitro, as determined by high-throughput sequencing
PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963737226&doi=10.1016%2fj.anifeedsci.2016.04.005&partnerID=40&md5=8710f077e6e80b72123db4c08d7d63e3
AB  - It has been suggested that condensed tannin (CT) fractions of different molecular weights (MWs) affect the level of methane (CH4) production in ruminant by altering the ruminal methanogenic diversity. In this study, the effects of unfractionated CTs (F0) and five CT fractions (F1-F5) of different MWs from Leucaena leucocephala hybrid-Rendang (LLR) on the population and diversity of rumen methanogenic archaea in vitro were investigated using real-time PCR and high throughput sequencing. Real-time PCR analysis showed that higher-MW CT fractions (fractions F1 and F2) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased more total methanogens and methanogens from the order Methanobacteriales than the control (without CTs), unfractionated CTs F0 and lower-MW CT fractions (fractions F3-F5). Population of methanogens from the order Methanomicrobiales was not significantly (P > 0.05) different among all CT fractions and the control. Amplification of archaeal 16S RNA genes (targeting the V3 region) of seven samples (obtained from in vitro gas production test) using Illumina Miseq sequencer, recovered 642,244 sequences (mean of 91,763 sequences per sample) which consisted of a number of OTUs ranging from 91 to 155 and were assigned to 12 genera. Bioinformatic analysis illustrated that the natural rumen archaeal community of a cattle (without supplementation of CTs) was predominated by an unclassified genus, VadinCA11 gut group which is Thermoplasmata-associated (56.3% of the total sequence reads), followed by Methanobrevibacter (25.1%) and Methanomicrobium (15.3%), while the remaining genera were below 1% of relative abundance. Relative abundance of the unclassified Thermoplasmata-associated group (VadinCA11 gut group) increased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing MWs of the CT fractions, whereas the predominant methanogen genus Methanobrevibacter was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. Condensed tannin fraction F4, but not the other CT fractions, significantly (P < 0.05) increased the second predominant methongen genus Methanomicrobium. Condensed tannin fractions of different MWs from LLR could alter the size of populations and diversity of rumen methanogenic archaea in vitro, which could contribute to the reduction of CH4 production, and the impact was more pronounced for CT fractions with higher-MWs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to estimate the in vitro biological effect of tannins within moringa (Moringa oleifeira cv. Super Genius), mulberry (Morus alba Linn cv. Cubana), trichanthera (Trichanthera gigantea) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Perú) foliage meals on ruminal fermentation indicators, the in vitro gas production was measured and the kinetics parameters were estimated according to Gompertz model, the in vitro degradability of the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and the nitrogen. The biological effect was estimated as the quotient between the value of each indicator when the tannins are inactive and active, expressed as increase percent. A random block design was applied, with four incubations as repelicates and the biological effect of tannins as treatment. At the beginning of fermentation (4h), the trichanthera tannins had little effect on gas production (P < 0.05). At 12h, the mulberry and moringa tannins showed the lowest biological effects, while those of leucaena and trichanthera the highest (P < 0.01). After 24 h of incubation, the moringa and leucaena tannins had similar effects and lower to the trichanthera tannins (P <0.001). From 48 h, the performance of the biological effect of tannins was trichanthera> leucaena> moringa> mulberry (P <0.001). There was only moderate biological effect on the kinetic parameters for leucaena and trichanthera tannins (P <0.001). Only the trichanthera tannins showed effect on the organic matter degradability (12%) and NDF (17.3%, P <0.01).The leucaena tannins had moderate biological effect in the NH3 concentration (11.3 %). The highest effects were observed for trichanthera tannins (29.4%, P <0.001). It is concluded that trichanthera tannins showed higher biological effect on the analyzed ruminal fermentation indicators, while in leucaena tannins were more moderate; those of moringa and mulberry did not influence on the nutritional value of them.

AB  - Brazilian Semiarid region is the natural environment of many herbaceous and shrubby plants that can be consumed by ruminants. Our objective was to estimate nutritional potential and CH4 production of forages from Brazilian Semiarid region for ruminant diets. We evaluated Manihot pseudoglazziovii, Mimosa caesapiniifolia, Bauhinia cheilantha, Leucaena leucocephala, Clitorea ternatea and Gliricidia sepium by chemical composition, digestibility and degradation parameters and ruminal fermentation. The fractionation of carbohydrates and proteins was performed based on the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. The evaluation of the degradation of organic matter and ruminal fermentation products was performed by the semi-automatic in vitro gas production technique. The ruminal degradability and intestinal digestibility of protein were estimated using the in vitro three stage simulation technique. Clitorea, followed by Leucaena, had the highest concentration of the fraction B2 (potentially digestible fiber) while the concentration did not differ (P>0.05) between the other species. The fractions C were found in greater quantities (P<0.05) in the Mimosa and Bauhinia species. Manihot, Gliricidia and, to a lesser extent, Leucaena, resulted in higher (P<0.05) true degradation of organic matter (g/kg organic matter) and higher partitioning factor (ratio of degradability and gas production). Leucaena showed greater intestinal protein digestibility (g/kg dry matter), especially as a protected source of protein ruminal degradation and available in the intestine. Gliricidia, Leucaena and Manihot showed potential for reducing the production of enteric methane, without compromising the degradation of nutrients, with high digestibility and readily fermentable carbohydrates. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to evaluate the saponins presence in plant extracts in methanol (50%), obtained from the tropical shrub legumes Enterolobium cyclocarpum (enterolobium), Acacia cornigera (acacia), Albizia lebbekoides (Albizia) and Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena), a methodology based on two in vitro assays was applied: foam test and blood agar test. In both a completely randomized experimental design was applied, with five extracts per treatment (legume) and three repetitions per extract. The average value of the three repetitions per extract of each legume was considered the experimental unit. The enterolobium extracts were positive to both tests, while the other three legumes were negative (P < 0.0001). With the use of this methodology, based on the combination of these two tests, the presence of active saponins in E. cyclocarpum extracts was confirmed. Moreover, it could state that in the extracts of acacia, albizia and leucaena there were not presence of these compounds or tannins able to hydrolyzing the membrane of red blood cells.

AB  - SUMMARY The short term nutrient supply of Leucaena leucocephala, Calliandra calothyrsus, Acacia angustissima and Acacia karoo prunings with or without supplemental inorganic nitrogen were tested using rape (Brassica napus L.) in a field trial. Prunings were applied at a rate of 5 t ha-1 to soil, alone or with supplemental N at 37.5 kg N ha-1 (14 of recommended N). The respective decomposition and N release constants of the prunings were 9.15 and 9.70% for L. leucocephala; 6.15 and 6.40 for A. angustissima; 4.50 and 4.90 for C. calothyrsus; and 2.20 and 2.10 for A. karoo. These constants were best described by the (lignin+polyphenol)-to-nitrogen ratio of the prunings. Total biomass over the two seasons ranged from 1.40 to 17.28 t DM ha-1 and total growth rates ranged from 2.34-26.70 g plant-1 week-1. The cumulative N recovery at week 9 ranged from 21.1-66.1 %. Legume tree leaves can be used as a source of N for vegetable production. Farmers who use high tannin leaf litter are recommended to supplement with mineral N in order to assure adequate N availability during plant growth. © Cambridge University Press 2015.

AB  - In this study Schizophyllum commune ISTL04 was grown on Leucaena leucocephala wood (LLW) for secretome analysis and schizophyllan production. There is no report on extracellular protein profile and schizophyllan production on woody biomass by this fungus under submerged fermentation conditions. Leucaena leucocephala, a promising bioenergy crop having high holocellulose content was used as substrate without pretreatment. The maximum sugar, extracellular protein and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production during fermentation was found to be 8.53 ± 0.07 mg mL−1, 391 ± 7.51 mg L−1 and 4.2 ± 0.1 g L−1 or 0.21 g g−1 LLW on day 18 respectively. The secretome profile was dominated by glycoside hydrolases followed by carbohydrate esterase and other oxidative enzymes. EPS was further characterized by FTIR and GC–MS for functional group, monomer composition and linkage analysis and was identified as schizophyllan. The result indicated that LLW can be utilized as a low cost substrate for enzyme cocktail and schizophyllan production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The adsorptive removal of Cr(VI) was studied using activated carbon derived from Leucaena leucocephala (ACLL). The physico-chemical properties of ACLL were determined using proximate analysis and N2 BET surface area analysis. The N2 BET surface area of ACLL was determined to be 1131 m2 g−1. The point of zero charge (pHpzc) of 5.42 indicated that ACLL surface was positively charged for pH below the pHPZC, attracting anions. The effect of experimental operating parameters such as time of contact, ACLL dose, pH, initial concentration and temperature was investigated. The optimum values of parameters such as concentration of 100 mg L−1, 300 mg of ACLL dose, time of contact of 60 min, pH of 4 indicated the maximum Cr(VI) uptake of 13.85 mg g−1. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model best fitted with the Cr(VI) adsorption data. Adsorptive removal of Cr(VI) onto ACLL satisfactorily fitted in the order of Redlich–Peterson > Freundlich > Langmuir > Temkin adsorption isotherm model. The thermodynamic parameters showed the adsorption of Cr(VI) onto ACLL was an endothermic and spontaneously occurred process. © 2016, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - The present study evaluated for the first time, some strength properties and the chemical compositions of seven hardwood species grown in Northeast Egypt, namely, Acacia saligna, Delonix regia, Erythrina humeana, Ficus elastica, Leucaena leucocephala, Melia azedarach, and Meryta sinclairii. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated that the effect of wood species on the mechanical properties and chemical compositions was significant (P<0.01). The parameters used to describe the mechanical properties and chemical compositions of the wood of the seven species differed from one species to another. The cellulose contents of the studied species, except for L. leucocephala (43.2 %), M. azedarach (44.1 %), and M. sinclairii (44.0 %), were found to be lower than those of common hardwood species. The variations in MOR, MOE, Cmax, and tensile strength among the seven species were expected given the differences in wood density and chemical compositions. Except for E. humeana, the other hardwood species studied could be considered to have moderate hardness and are suitable for making floor parquets. Overall, based on the studied mechanical properties, the wood of M. azedarach and M. sinclairii showed good MOR, MOE, and Cmax values, whereas E. humeana wood had the lowest such values. In terms of mechanical properties, the seven hardwood species studied in the present investigation can thus be concluded to have the following order: M. azedarach>M. sinclairii>L. leucocephala>D. regia>F. elastica>A. saligna>E. humeana. © 2015 by ASTM International.

TI  - A putative 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase is required for efficient symbiotic nitrogen fixation in Sinorhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium fredii NGR234
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006751490&doi=10.1111%2f1462-2920.13570&partnerID=40&md5=deb081fa8aca8479ea98b70e0b166e42
AB  - We report that the smb20752 gene of the alfalfa symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti is a novel symbiotic gene required for full N2-fixation. Deletion of smb20752 resulted in lower nitrogenase activity and smaller nodules without impacting overall nodule morphology. Orthologs of smb20752 were present in all alpha and beta rhizobia, including the ngr_b20860 gene of Sinorhizobium fredii NGR234. A ngr_b20860 mutant formed Fix− determinate nodules that developed normally to a late stage of the symbiosis on the host plants Macroptilium atropurpureum and Vigna unguiculata. However an early symbiotic defect was evident during symbiosis with Leucaena leucocephala, producing Fix− indeterminate nodules. The smb20752 and ngr_b20860 genes encode putative 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA (HIB-CoA) hydrolases. HIB-CoA hydrolases are required for l-valine catabolism and appear to prevent the accumulation of toxic metabolic intermediates, particularly methacrylyl-CoA. Evidence presented here and elsewhere (Curson et al., PLoS ONE 9:e97660) demonstrated that Smb20752 and NGR_b20860 can also prevent metabolic toxicity, are required for l-valine metabolism, and play an undefined role in 3-hydroxybutyrate catabolism. We present evidence that the symbiotic defect of the HIB-CoA hydrolase mutants is independent of the inability to catabolize l-valine and suggest it relates to the toxicity resulting from metabolism of other compounds possibly related to 3-hydroxybutyric acid. © 2016 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Performance of cattle reared on rangelands supplemented with farm-formulated diets during the dry season in Zimbabwe

AB  - Feed quality in rangelands reaches an all-time low during the dry season thus affecting animal performance. The use of farm-formulated supplements is an alternative which can be adopted to minimise the effects of nutritional stress. However, the effects of supplementing nursing cows, twice a week with farm-formulated diets; on cow maintenance, calf weaning weight and conception rate is little known. Thirty indigenous Mashona cows were allocated to five treatments of a commercial supplement known as beef survival meal, urea-treated maize stover, Leucaena leucocephala meal, mixed forage meal and without supplements. The study was repeated with a new set of nursing cows each year for 3 years. Nutrient composition of treatment diets varied with Leucaena leucocephala having more crude protein than the other diets. Forage-supplemented groups had higher (P < 0.05) rate of weight increase and weaning weights with Leucaena leucocephala and beef survival meal having better results among the groups. Nursing cows that were in protein-supplemented groups had significantly higher (P < 0.05) conception rate than the group of nursing cows, which were not offered the protein supplements. We concluded that, with farm-formulated supplements given twice per week, nursing cows can maintain better body condition, wean heavier calves and successful conceive every year thus improving animal productivity. © CSIRO 2017.

TI  - Potential of mimosine of Leucaena leucocephala for modulating ruminal nutrient degradability and methanogenesis
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007427977&doi=10.1016%2fj.anifeedsci.2016.11.003&partnerID=40&md5=7ada48e0cb92edec18eb00eb96d14018
AB  - Two in vitro assays were accomplished to assess whether low or high mimosine naturally found in leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), contribute to methane (CH4) suppression. The first assay aimed to detect the effects of leucaena samples containing low or high mimosine levels on tannin bioactivity and ruminal CH4 production. Samples containing 43.9 ± 1.9 g condensed tannin (CT)/kg DM were divided into two groups based on their mimosine contents (n = 4/group): low (2.3 ± 0.1) and high (11.1 ± 1.5) g mimosine/kg DM. Leucaena incubations were made with or without polyethylene glycol (PEG). In the second assay, two leucaena samples similar in CT content and chemical composition were selected from the first assay to examine the effect of level of mimosine naturally found in leucaena, as well as the direct effect of mimosine when added to Tifton (Tifton 85; Cynodon dactylon (L.) and lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) hays on ruminal fermentation and nutrient degradation. The results of the first assay showed that leucaena containing low mimosine with or without PEG decreased (P < 0.01) gas production (GP), but presented higher values of the percent increase in gas (P = 0.03) and CH4 (P < 0.01) production after PEG addition compared to leucaena containing high mimosine. The addition of PEG in the second in vitro assay enhanced GP (P = 0.007) and CH4 (P < 0.05) by both types of leucaena, while decreased (P = 0.01) propionate, and increased (P = 0.003) C2/C3 and NH3[sbnd]N (P = 0.02) concentrations by leucaena containing low mimosine compared with PEG non-supplemented leucaena. However, such an effect did not occur by leucaena containing high mimosine. L-mimosine recorded 27% (P = 0.02) and 10% (P = 0.08) CH4 reduction when supplemented at a high level with Tifton and lucerne, respectively, while enhanced (P < 0.05) the true degradability of organic matter (TDOM), acetate and NH3[sbnd]N, compared with zero mimosine supplementation. Forages without any supplementation also affected the ruminal fermentation; similar reduction (P < 0.05) of CH4 production was found for both leucaena samples compared to Tifton and lucerne. Leucaena containing high mimosine enhanced TDOM (P < 0.01), acetate (P = 0.01) and NH3[sbnd]N (P = 0.05). These results indicated that leucaena containing high mimosine modulated ruminal fermentation in a different way than did the leucaena containing low mimosine. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Traditional fruit homegardens are units of production of high richness of species with value in use. The objective was to analyze the relationship between the arboreal structure of 30 homegardens of Coatetelco, Morelos and the value in use of the species. The structure was quantified through the Importance Value Index (IVI). The Cultural Value Index (CVI) identified the preference of the community. The arboreal variety includes 24 botanical families, 49 genera and 65 species; 45 % were introduced and 55 % were native of America from which 23 % belonged to dry tropical deciduous forest. Ecologically and culturally, the most important species are the multiple use ones (Leucaena leucocephala, and L. esculenta), self-supply and sale ones (Mangifera indica, and Citrus x aurantium), and the ones produced during dry season (Spondias purpurea and Pithecellobium dulce). The size of homegardens, specific richness and density are positively related. Importance value and cultural value index correlated 86 %. The structure of the homegardens was organized because of cultural reasons. The preferred species are the ones with the highest value in use. Native trees such as Amphipterygium adstringens, Swietenia humilis, Jacaratia mexicana, Enterolobium cyclocarpum and also some other species introduced as Citrus maxima, Ficus carica and Moringa oleifera which could be lost because of lack of space.

TI  - The effect of seed traits on geographic variation in body size and sexual size dimorphism of the seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus
PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991442279&doi=10.1002%2fece3.2364&partnerID=40&md5=14d2d4693d6372a9e55c2c821bb2739e
AB  - Explaining large-scale patterns of variation in body size has been considered a central question in ecology and evolutionary biology because several life-history traits are directly linked to body size. For ectothermic organisms, little is known about what processes influence geographic variation in body size. Changes in body size and sexual size dimorphism (SSD) have been associated with environmental variables, particularly for Bruchinae insects, which feed exclusively on seeds during the larval stage. However, the effect of important seed traits on body size variation has rarely been investigated, and whether SSD varies substantially among populations within bruchine species is poorly known. Using the seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus infesting its host plant Leucaena leucocephala, we investigated whether specific seed traits (hardness, size, water content, carbon/nitrogen ratio, and phenolic content) were determinant in generating geographic variation in body size and SSD of A. macrophthalmus. We also examined the relationships between body size and SSD with latitude and altitude. The body size of both sexes combined was not related to latitude, altitude, and any of the physical and chemical seed traits. However, the female body size tended to vary more in size than the males, generating significant variation in SSD in relation to latitude and altitude. The females were the larger sex at higher latitudes and at lower altitudes, precisely where seed water content was greater. Therefore, our results suggest that water content was the most important seed trait, most severely affecting the females, promoting geographic variation in SSD of A. macrophthalmus. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The MC (moisture content) and HHV (higher heating value) of Leucaena leucocephala pellets using NIR (near infrared) spectroscopy was investigated in this study. The MC of the pellets was adjusted by subjecting the samples to different relative humidity environments. The samples were scanned in diffuse reflection mode at wavenumbers of 12,500-4000 cm-1. Partial least squares regression models correlating the MC and HHV with the NIR spectra were developed and validated by full cross validation. The model for MC and HHV provided coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.995 and 0.964, a root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) of 0.187%wb and 79.2 J g-1, bias of -0.0008%wb and 1.29 J g-1 and a RPD (ratio of prediction to deviation) of 13.9 and 5.30, respectively. The models had excellent accuracy. This rapid quality evaluation method may be used for trading of biomass pellets. An equation related MC and HHV was also developed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the antioxidant capacity of the Leucaena leucocephala aqueous shoot tips plus young leaves (LL-spl) extracts among three different fractions (LL-spl 10, 20, and 40 min) and to examine its acute toxicity on male reproductive parameters. The amount of the total phenolics in LL-spl extract was determined using a Folin-Ciocalteu reagent method and its antioxidant capacity was analyzed using 1, 1-diphenyl l-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant powder methods. The LL-spl extract fraction with highest antioxidant capacity was used in animal treating. Male rats were divided into three groups (n= 5); control and groups treated with LL-spl 400 and 600 mg/Kg body weight for consecutive 40 days. The results showed that the LL-spl 40 min fraction possessed the highest antioxidant capacity. In addition, the LL-spl 400 and 600 groups showed no differences in weights of body, testis and epididymis, serum testosterone levels, and expression of testicular steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein. Significantly, LL-spl extract reduced the weight of seminal vesicle, sperm concentration, and seminiferous diameters compared with control. Moreover, LL-spl extract had adverse effect on testicular histology in inducing of seminiferous atrophy and degeneration including dilated blood vessels in interstitial tissue. It was concluded that although LL-spl extract possessing antioxidant capacity, in short term consumptions, it could be toxic to some male reproductive organs especially damaging testicular tissues. © 2016, Universidad de la Frontera.

(white popinac) and Acacia confusa (Formosa acacia) are used in this study. The axial forces developed in plant roots in soil that is subject to shear rely on the root location and orientation with respect to the shear direction. The majority of the roots in front of the tree stem, with respect to the shear direction, develop compressive forces during the shearing process, as the root orientation is low. Roots on the side of the tree stem tend to develop tensile forces during the shearing process. Most of the measured root forces at the back of the tree stem with respect to the shear direction are in tensile modes. Post-peak root forces continue to develop with increasing shear displacements. The percentage of the maximum mobilized root force in tensile modes during shear in this study reaches to approximately 68% of its ultimate tensile resistance at a shear displacement of 10-25. cm, whereas most of the instrumented data are less than approximately 45%. The maximum mobilized stress level for roots in front of the tree stem during the shearing process is low with respect to the ultimate tensile resistance of the root, and the maximum mobilized stress level for roots on the side and at the back of the tree stem is moderate. This study provides an in-depth look at the root forces developed in a plant root system subjected to shear. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study was conducted in order to determine the effect of different particle size and pretreatment temperature to the crystallinity of leucaena leucocephala. The leucaena was pretreated by ionic liquid [1-ethyl-3 methylimidazolium acetate [Emim]Ac. There were three different particle sizes that have been tested in this experiment; less than 0.3 mm, 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm. In the other hand, the pretreatment temperature tested were 30°C, 60°C and 90°C. The effect of particle size and pretreatment temperature to the crystallinity of leucaena was investigated by using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The crystallinity index of the sample represents the percentage of crystalline materials. A lower in the cristallinity index indicated that the material has lower crystillinity, hence give more benefit to the cellulose hydrolysis. From XRD analysis, it shows that the cristallinity index of leucaena decreased with decreasing particle size and increasing pretreatment temperature. SEM analysis also shows that the structure of leucaena has more irregular, porous and destroyed structure with decreasing particle size and increasing pretreatment temperature. Thus, the result from this experiment shows that the smaller particle size and higher pretreatment temperature would provide a more accessible surface area to enhance the cellulose hydrolysis. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2016.

AB  - Desiccation tolerance (DT) is the ability to tolerate dehydration to levels below 0.1 g(H2O) g−1(dry mass) and subsequent rehydration without lethal damage. Here, it is proposed that Leucaena leucocephala, a tree species, has potential to be model tolerant species in seed research. Using flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy, cytological changes related to loss of DT in Leucaena primary roots were followed during germination. Leucaena seeds lost their DT at the end of germination and this coincided with an increase in cellular 4C DNA content. A negative correlation between the 8C DNA content and the capacity of germinating Leucaena seeds to tolerate desiccation was also observed. Apparently, the seeds of Leucaena underwent extra cycles of endoreduplication and accumulated a high content of DNA — an event not previously linked to DT. The ultrastructural damage imposed by drying overcame Leucaena primary root cell resilience and their ability to resume normal growth. Nuclear DNA content may be used as indicator of progress of germination and loss of DT in Leucaena. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - An assessment of alien plant invasive and is very important to control the them at protected areas of tropical forest. Sixty-four alien invasive plant species belong to twenty-three families were recorded at six conservation areas of West Sumatra. The species composition of invasive plant were different among those six conservation areas. Kebun Raya Solok had the highest number of species and genera (41 and 39, respectively) and G. Talamau had the lowest one, with ten species and ten genera. Increasing the number of species and genus of invasive plant concordance to disturbance of the studied areas. More than 50% of invasive plant species in School forest for biological research and education, Limau Manis, were similar to those invasive plant species in Kebun Raya Solok, West Sumatra. In contrast, only 13% of invasive plant species from Kebun Raya Solok were similar to G. Talamau. It is very important to note that three invasive tree species (Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia mangium & Arenga obtusifolia) were detected in three conservation areas and the latest one was dominantly distributed in Lembah Anai and Rimbo Panti Natural Reserve. The existance of these invasive species: Imperata cylindrica, Clydemia hirta, Lantana camara, Leucaena leucocephala, Mikania micrantha and Mimosa pigra into conservation areas in West Sumatra have to be warned cause of the severe effect to the biodiversity. The invasive species from family Asteraceae (except Ageratum conyzoides), Leguminosae and Graminae tend to had the xenogamy breeding system that implied the high level of genetic diversity and well adapted various habitats.

AB  - Globally, dengue has become one of the major public health concerns. However, the threat of dengue virus (DENV) has been overlooked due to lack of continuous surveillance. The four DENV serotypes are the reason for this serious illness and for its treatment till date no commercial drug is available. The increase in demand of plant based medicine and lack of anti-dengue drug and therapy has triggered to review available literature of potential anti-dengue plants against DENV serotypes. Therefore, the twin objective of this study aims to explore the current dengue data in India (2011–2016) and to review potential anti-dengue plants for their inhibition activity on DENV serotypes. Dengue data from time period 2011–2016 has been reviewed and analysed state, region and year wise in India and studies from 2002–2016 related to potential anti-dengue plant have been reviewed for their inhibition activity on DENV serotypes. It was observed that Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Gujarat, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Karnataka are highly and most consistently affected states. South region of India, most affected by DENV and 2015, 2013 reported the highest number of dengue cases. Moreover, the reviewed potential anti-dengue plants majorly show inhibition activity against DENV 2. Study revealed the current scenario of DENV and identified the largely affected areas and regions in India for development of health initiatives and future studies are encouraged to identify plant species showing inhibition activity against DENV 3, 4. © 2016 Asian Pacific Tropical Medicine Press

AB  - In North Uruguay, in Colonia Gestido, we have identified problems in the sustainability of production systems, mainly due to inadequate animal-plant integration and scarce presence of multipurpose trees and shrubs. To overcome these restrictions, our aim was to evaluate alternatives in production systems designs that integrate animals, crops, fodder shrubs in high-density, high-productivity grasses and trees for shade and timber. This paper presents the design and management of three intensive silvopastoral modules during the first years of installation, the achieved learnings, as well as the aspects to be improved. From a participatory research approach with a group of producers, two legume trees (Leucaena leucocepha and Parapiptadenia rigida) and elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) were planted in different arrangements and densities, combined with the natural grassland vegetation and, in one case, with vegetable crops. The evaluated variables included: plant height, biomass production, resistance and resilience to frost, pest incidence, chemical nutritional characterization, grazing calves’ weight gain, chemical properties of the soils, and labor requirements. The results were superior to those obtained in traditional systems, in terms of biomass production (particularly elephant grass) and nutritional quality (leucaena), as well as for the weight gain of the calves in rotational grazing systems, superior than average gain in traditional production systems. These proposals should be further adjusted to the agro-ecological conditions and specific characteristics of each production system. © 2016, Fundacion CIPAV. All right reserved.

AB  - Saline and alkaline groundwater can be used for irrigation of pastures. Using leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Tarramba) and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Topcut), the effects of saline (electrical conductivity [EC], 0-20 dS m-1), sodic (sodium absorption ratio [SAR], SAR 5-30), and alkaline (0-855 mg L-1 CaCOj equivalent) water on seed germination was investigated, with seedling root growth also measured in leucaena. For leucaena, germination decreased at EC > 15 dS m1, but SAR at values of up to 30 had no effect on germination. Alkalinity was found not to influence germination of leucaena (up to 855 mg L-1 CaCO3 equivalent). Germination of 'Topcut' Rhodes grass was not reduced significantly with any EC, SAR or alkalinity treatment used in this study. Root growth in leucaena was inhibited by salinity > 5 dS m-1, SAR > 5 and alkalinity (as CaCO3) > 24 mg L-1. It was found that the inhibition of root elongation of leucaena at high SAR values could be attributed to Ca deficiency, i.e. activity of Ca2+ at the root cell plasma membrane. Germination of leucaena and Topcut Rhodes grass was highly tolerant of the salinity and alkalinity found in alkaline and saline groundwater (including water extracted from coal seams) when used for irrigation.

AB  - The initial performance of the simultaneous association between high sowing density of tree species and Cuba CT-115 (Pennisetum purpureum) was characterized through a random blocks design with a factorial arrangement (4 x 5) and four replications. Factors were determined by treatments and growth from 15 to 75 days old: T1) alternate furrows of CT-115 - leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) cv. Peru; T2) CT-115 - leucaena - CT-115 - gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium); T3) CT-115 - leucaena- CT-115 - moringa (Moringa oleifera) and T4) CT-115 -leucaena - CT-115- caesealpinia (Caesealpinia platyloba). Results showed interaction for all variables corresponding to trees. The highest number of plants m-1 (P ≤ 0.001) corresponded to moringa at 45 d from sowing (8.65) and it did not differ from leucaena at 60 d. The lowest population (P ≤ 0.001) was shown in leucaena at 15 d, without differences from gliricidia, except at 15 d. Moringa reached the highest height (P ≤ 0.001) with 104.69 cm at 75 d. The lowest height was found in leucaena at 15 d with a mean value of 3.71 cm. Leucaena showed the lowest insertion values of the first branch (P ≤ 0.001), while moringa reached 30.35 cm long. In CT-115, there were no differences among treatments, only among growth ages. It can be concluded that moringa had the best performance during the initial development stage in the simultaneous association with CT-115.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of feeding dried foliage (leaves and petioles) of Acacia saligna, Leucaena leucocephala or Moringa oleifera on the performance, digestibility, N utilisation, caecal fermentation and microbial profiles in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. One hundred weaned male NZW rabbits weighing 819.2±16.6 g and aged 35±1 d were randomly allocated into 4 groups of 25 rabbits each. Rabbits were fed on pelleted diets containing 70% concentrate mixture and 30% Egyptian berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum) hay (Control diet) or one of the other 3 experimental diets, where 50% of berseem hay was replaced with A. saligna (AS), L. leucocephala (LL) or M. oleifera (MO). Compared to Control diet, decreases in dry matter (DM; P=0.004), organic matter (P=0.028), crude protein (CP; P=0.001), neutral detergent fibre (P=0.033) and acid detergent fibre (P=0.011) digestibility were observed with the AS diet. However, DM and CP digestibility were increased by 3% with the MO diet, and N utilisation was decreased (P<0.05) with AS. Rabbits fed AS and LL diets showed decreased (P=0.001) average daily gain by 39 and 7%, respectively vs. Control. Feed conversion was similar in Control and MO rabbits, whereas rabbits fed AS diet ate up to 45% more feed (P=0.002) than Control rabbits to gain one kg of body weight. Caecal ammonia-N was increased (P=0.002) with LL, while acetic acid was decreased (P=0.001) with AS diet vs. other treatments. Caecal E. coli and Lactobacillus spp. bacteria counts were decreased with MO by about 44 and 51%, respectively, vs. Control. In conclusion, under the study conditions, tree foliage from M. oleifera and L. leucocephala are suitable fibrous ingredients to be included up to 150 g/kg in the diets of growing rabbits, and can safely replace 50% of berseem hay in diets of NZW rabbits without any adverse effect on their growth performance. Foliage from M. oleifera had a better potential as a feed for rabbits than that from L. leucocephala. Although foliage from A. saliga may be also used at 150 g/kg in the diets of growing rabbits, this level of inclusion may result in reduced feed digestibility and growth performance. © WRSA, UPV, 2003.

AB  - Leucaena is a genus of 22 recognized species of leguminous trees native to North America. The genus is recognized internationally as a source of multipurpose trees, of great significance for wood and for forage and green manure. The most widespread species, L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (2n = 104), is the focus of most improvement by plant breeders. An arboreal subspecies glabrata commonly referred to as the "giant leucaena" is exclusively used for genetic improvement. A highly forked subspecies leucocephala is seedy and often invasive, giving the entire species a bad reputation. Hawaii's "40-year-old" collection of 474 provenances of Leucaena, including 125 accessions of glabrata and 347 of leucocephala, which are easily distinguished, makes it clear that treating the entire species as an invasive weed is an error. The subspecies leucocephala is the "weed" and has been of no use at all to breeders. Many other species resulting from provenance collections notably by the University of Hawaii, University of Queensland, and Oxford University have become of great interest individually or as parents with giant leucaena. Notable among these are L. diversifolia and L. Pallida, both of which are 2n = 104. Early concerns about mimosine toxicity have been dispelled for ruminant animals by use of suitable ruminant bacteria. Notable challenges to breeders have been tolerance to psyllid insects, to acid tropical soils, and to cool sub-temperate climates. The psyllid problem has essentially been solved by genetic tolerance and increased presence internationally of numerous predators. Outstanding cultivars worldwide include "K636" from Hawaii and "Tarramba" and "Wondergraze" from Australia. About half the million-plus hectares in commercial leucaena production are for beef fodder and half for fuelwood and paper. © 2016 Wiley-Blackwell. All rights reserved.

AB  - ABSTRACT: A field study was conducted to evaluate the nitrogen status and yield of spinach grown in soils amended with prunings of Leucaena leucocephala, (applied at a rate of 3, 5, 7 or 11 t ha−1). A ‘no fertilizer’ 0 nitrogen (N) and 150 kg N ha−1 (recommended) were the control treatments. SPAD readings were recorded for the top six leaves. Nitrogen sufficiency indices were used to indicate the N status of plants. Application of L. leucocephala prunings increased spinach yields (8.98–13.86 t DM ha−1) relative to the 0N treatment (1.35 t DM ha−1) and yields increased with increasing rate of pruning application. SPAD readings showed a linear increase with the increase in applied prunings. There was preferential distribution of N to upper leaves. The relationship between shoot N concentration and SPAD readings was linear and strongest for the top three leaves (r2 = 0.84–0.92). The results indicate the potential of chlorophyll meter readings in assessing N status of leafy vegetables grown on soils amended with different levels of legume tree prunings. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biochar fuel (CH0.50O0.19N0.06) was prepared from Leucaena leucocephala bark (CH2.80O0.53N0.03) through the slow pyrolysis process adopting design of experiments technique. Modelling and optimization of the slow pyrolysis process was respectively carried out implementing five level central composite design and numerical technique under response surface methodology. Pyrolysis temperature and time were taken as independent parameters while biochar fuel yield, bulk density, higher heating value, energy density and energy yield were chosen as dependent parameters. The optimal pyrolysis temperature and time were estimated to be 367.47 °C and 135.38 min respectively. These optimum values of temperature and time gave biochar yield 47.29%, bulk density 319.73 kg/m3, higher heating value 23.30 MJ/kg, energy density 1.21, and energy yield 56.55%. The developed quadratic models were checked using ANOVA (analysis of variance) technique for their validity and degree of fitness. The high values of 'Adequate precision',R2 and its negligible difference with 'AdjustedR2' as well as 'PredictedR2' for each model indicated that the fitted empirical models can be used for prediction with reasonable precision. The quadratic models revealed strong interaction between pyrolysis temperature and time towards preparation of biochar fuel. It was further observed that desirability of pyrolysis temperature (0.91) is more than pyrolysis time (0.63). Comparison of Van Krevelen diagram of present biochar fuel with several other biochar fuels and coals showed that prepared biochar has better fuel properties in comparison to raw bark. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biomass is nowadays a very important alternative to energy consumption, since it provides less environmental harms. Briquettes come as an option since they include logistical and efficiency advantages. This study aimed to characterize Leucaena leucocephala (leucena) and Gonoacantha piptadenia (pau-jacaré) biomass, to define their energy potential and verify the briquettes’ moisture content and the mechanical resistance. Six treatments were provided: 2 species and three different moisture contents (10%, 12% and 15%). Fifteen briquettes were produced for each treatment. The results showed that moisture content changes the stability of the briquettes. The pau-jacaré showed a better performance, in every aspect analyzed, superior chemical characteristics (ash content of 1.83%), higher heating value (18,956 kJ kg−1) and better mechanical resistance (0.5255 MPa). However, both species provided fine results toward this proposal. Therefore, they can be used in every moisture content tested here, offering satisfactory results for bioenergy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Eradication of feral goats enhances expansion of the invasive shrub Leucaena leucocephala on Nakoudo-jima, an oceanic island
PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959330042&doi=10.1111%2fwre.12198&partnerID=40&md5=24de0276d0297d312022f8db875d18e8
AB  - Summary: Many introduced species can co-exist within the same ecosystem and sometimes interact with each other. Under such situations, eradication of one species may cause unexpected negative effects. Nakoudo-jima in the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands is an oceanic island that had feral goats that were introduced in the 1880s, but eradicated in 1999. Following their eradication, the alien invasive shrub Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) was predicted to increase drastically. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the eradication of feral goats enhanced the expansion of L. leucocephala using four time-series aerial photographs and validation work based on current field surveys of Nakoudo-jima. Our results showed that following feral goat elimination, bare ground areas decreased and forest cover increased. This was particularly true of areas dominated by L. leucocephala. Thus, feral goats appear to have limited the expansion of L. leucocephala on Nakoudo-jima. Grassland cover also increased following feral goat elimination, but this may have occurred prior to L. leucocephala expansion. These results suggest that L. leucocephala-dominated forest might invade grassland areas and that grasslands may have mediated the expansion of L. leucocephala after feral goat elimination. Future management of L. leucocephala should target the species in the high-risk expansion zones adjacent to grasslands. Weed Research © 2016 European Weed Research Society.

TI  - NrcR, a new transcriptional regulator of rhizobium tropici ciat 899 involved in the legume root-nodule symbiosis
PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978959410&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0154029&partnerID=40&md5=f5e2a5709fb5b2d5e709304d9584f8a4
AB  - The establishment of nitrogen-fixing rhizobium-legume symbioses requires a highly complex cascade of events. In this molecular dialogue the bacterial NodD transcriptional regulators in conjunction with plant inducers, mostly flavonoids, are responsible for the biosynthesis and secretion of Nod factors which are key molecules for successful nodulation. Other transcriptional regulators related to the symbiotic process have been identified in rhizobial genomes, including negative regulators such as NolR. Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 is an important symbiont of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), and its genome encompasses intriguing features such as five copies of nodD genes, as well as other possible transcriptional regulators including the NolR protein. Here we describe and characterize a new regulatory gene located in the non-symbiotic plasmid pRtrCIAT899c, that shows homology (46% identity) with the nolR gene located in the chromosome of CIAT 899. The mutation of this gene, named nrcR (nolR-like plasmid c Regulator), enhanced motility and exopolysaccharide production in comparison to the wild-type strain. Interestingly, the number and decoration of Nod Factors produced by this mutant were higher than those detected in the wildtype strain, especially under salinity stress. The nrcR mutant showed delayed nodulation and reduced competitiveness with P. vulgaris, and reduction in nodule number and shoot dry weight in both P. vulgaris and Leucaena leucocephala. Moreover, the mutant exhibited reduced capacity to induce the nodC gene in comparison to the wild-type CIAT 899. The finding of a new nod-gene regulator located in a non-symbiotic plasmid may reveal the existence of even more complex mechanisms of regulation of nodulation genes in R. tropici CIAT 899 that may be applicable to other rhizobial species. © 2016 del Cerro et al.

TI  - Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) alleviate heavy metal-induced toxicity in Leucaena leucocephala seedlings: A physiochemical analysis

AB  - The present study describes the role of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) in reversing oxidative stress symptoms induced by heavy metal (Cd and Pb) exposure in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Seedling growth was significantly enhanced with the augmentation of ZnONPs following Cd and Pb exposure. Heavy metal accumulations were recorded as 1253.1 mg Cd per kg DW and 1026.8 mg Pb per kg DW for the respective treatments. Results demonstrated that ZnONPs augmentation caused an increase in photosynthetic pigment and total soluble protein contents while a significant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA-lipid peroxidation) content in leaves. Antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX) were, in turn, elevated in heavy metal-exposed leaves amended with ZnONPs. The ameliorating effect of ZnO nanoparticles on oxidative stress induced toxicity was also confirmed by the reduced MDA content and the elevated level of antioxidative enzyme activities in leaf tissues of L. leucocephala seedlings. Further, addition of ZnONPs in combination with Cd and Pb metals induced distinct genomic alterations such as presence of new DNA bands and/or absence of normal bands in the RAPD pattern of the exposed plants. This study uniquely suggests a potential role of zinc oxide nanoparticles in the remediation of heavy metal contaminated media. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Lignin is the second most abundant renewable biopolymer on earth after cellulose. It is being used in many industrial applications due to its abundance. In the present study, lignin was isolated from the stems of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit., a high biomass yielding plant using acidic dioxane under N2 atmosphere. Structural characterization of isolated dioxane lignin (DL) was performed by analytical techniques: UV, FT-IR, 1H NMR and 13CNMR. Their monolignol content was determined by nitrobenzene oxidation followed by HPLC-MS/MS analysis. The data was compared with commercial alkali lignin (AL). The results showed that DL is of hardwood guaiacyl-syringyl (GS) type, whereas AL is softwood type with more guaiacyl units and trace amounts of p-hydroxyphenyl units (H). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of DL showed two stage thermal degradation profile similar to AL. The DTGmax for DL and AL were found in the second major loss event of second stage of TGA at 424ºC and 404ºC, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study exhibited the glass transition temperatures (Tg) at 132ºC and 122ºC for DL and AL, respectively. The results from thermal stability studies suggest that dioxane lignin isolated from the "miracle tree" (subabul) can be exploited in various thermoplastic industrial applications. © 2016, National Institute of Science Communication.

AB  - Ingestion of seeds by vertebrates may influence seed germination and dispersion. However the mechanisms responsible by these effects and the importance of turtles in these interactions are still poorly understood. This study aims to evaluate how Chelonoidis carbonarius influences the germination process of Leucaena leucocephala using an experiment conducted at the Federal University of Ceará, Fortaleza-CE, Brazil, that simulates the passage of the seeds of this plant through the digestive tract of C. carbonarius: stomach acidic condition and seeds sown in feces. We demonstrated that sowing the seeds in feces of Chelonoidis carbonarius has a negative effect on the germination of Leucaena leucocephala, decreasing the germination speed index of the seeds, while the acidic conditions have a neutral one. This study is a first attempt to understand how turtles and tortoises may influence the seed germination, and the implications of these findings in natural environments deserve further investigations.

AB  - Bioactive plants might represent an alternative for Cooperia punctata control in grazing cattle. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the ovicidal activity of extracts from 4 plant species against C. punctata, (2) to determine the role of the polyphenols in the plants’ anthelmintic (AH) activity, and (3) to evaluate the best plant extraction procedure when searching for ovicidal activity. The egg hatch assay was used with different extraction procedures, aqueous (AQ), acetone:water (AW) and acetonic (AC), to evaluate the ovicidal activity of Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Guazuma ulmifolia and Cratylia argentea. Eggs of C. punctata were exposed in quadruplicate to 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 4.8 and 9.6 mg mL-1 of each plant extract. The roles of the polyphenols were assessed using polyethylene glycol (PEG). The 12 plant extracts inhibited egg hatching in a dose-dependent manner. Best-fit LC50 values were 1.03 ± 0.17 and 7.90 ± 1.19 mg mL-1 for G. sepium-AC and L. leucocephala-AQ, respectively. Differences in AH activity were found among the extraction procedures (P < 0.05). At the highest concentration, L. leucocephala-AQ inhibited more than 50% of C. punctata hatching. The G. sepium-AC extract fully inhibited egg hatching. The addition of polyethylene glycol revealed the role of the polyphenols in the bioactivity of most plant extracts; however, for G. sepium-AC, the polyphenols were not the main bioactive compounds. Overall, acetone:water extraction represented the best extraction procedure to obtain both ovicidal activity and higher yield. The inhibition rates suggested that L. leucocephala and G. sepium should be evaluated as a means of reducing larval density in pastures. © 2016 Elke von Son-de Fernex et al.

AB  - Mesquite (Prosopis sp.) and Leucaena leucocephala are widespread legumes, widely used to feed several livestock species and as food source for human populations in several countries. Both mesquite and Leucaena contain several phytoestrogens which might have potential estrogenic effects. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of mesquite pod and Leucaena extracts on several aspects of behavior and reproductive physiology of the male rat.The effects of the extracts were compared with those of estradiol (E2) and of two isoflavones: daidzein (DAI) and genistein (GEN). The following treatments were given to groups of intact male rats: vehicle; mesquite pod extract; Leucaena extract; E2; DAI; GEN. The results indicate that mesquite pod and Leucaena extracts disrupt male sexual behavior in a similar way to DAI and GEN, but less than E2. The main disruptor of sexual behavior was E2, however after 40 and 50 days of administration, both extracts and phytoestrogens disrupted sexual behavior in a similar way to E2. The extracts also increased testicular germ cell apoptosis, decreased sperm quality, testicular weight, and testosterone levels, as phytoestrogens did, although these effects were less than those caused by estradiol. The number of seminiferous tubules with TUNEL-positive germ cells increased in extracts treated groups in a similar way to phytoestrogens groups, and E2 caused the greatest effect. The number of TUNEL-positive cells per tubule increased only in Leucaena extract and E2 groups, but not in mesquite- and phytoestrogens-treated groups. Spermatocytes and round spermatids were the TUNEL-positive cells observed in all experimental groups. This effect was associated with smaller testicular weights without atrophy in experimental groups compared with control. Testicular atrophy was only observed in estradiol-treated males. Testosterone decreased in males of all experimental groups, compared with control, this androgen was undetectable in E2 treated males. These results suggest that mesquite pod and Leucaena extracts cause effects similar to those of phytoestrogens in male rat reproduction, these effects were lower than those caused by E2. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The present work is a contribution to knowledge of polen recovered from six Apis mellifera honey samples and six pollen loads samples, in order to characterize their botanical and geographical origin. Samples were collected from central and northern Guerrero -both regions of beekeeping importance- during November-December 2005 and March 2006. Honeybee foraging behavior was also analyzed. Melissopalynological results showed a total of 43 pollen types belonging to 27 families; only 15 taxa of native flora were considered of importance, and their palynological descriptions are included: Cosmos sulphureus, Dyssodia papposa, Taraxacum campylodes, Tithonia tubaeformis, and Vernonia sp. (Asteraceae), Coutoubea sp. (Gentianaceae), Dalea sp. and Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae), Quercus sp. (Fagaceae), Miconia sp. (Melastomataceae), Pisonia sp. (Nyctaginaceae), Dodonaea viscosa and Paullinia sp. (Sapindaceae), Solanum sp. (Solanaceae), and Heliocarpus donnellsmithii (Malvaceae) as well as Zea mays (Poaceae), an abundant crop. Two oligofloral and four multifloral honey samples were characterized. Diversity indexes varied from 1.7 to 2.3 in honey samples, while the pollen loads registered 1.6 to 2.1 values in diversity, the evenness index in honey samples varied from 0.8 to 0.9, whereas pollen load samples registered a range from 0.6 to 0.9. Apis mellifera showed polylectic behavior; the herbaceous stratum was the most foraged, followed in importance by tree and shrub strata. © 2016, Sociedad Botanica de Mexico, A.C. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the influence of green fertilization and the compost on the production of radish, cv. ‘Cometa’. The experimental design was randomized blocks with 6 treatments and 4 replicates: T1-Leucaena, T2-‘Madeira-nova’, T3-Compost (maize straw and composted cattle manure), T4-‘Sempre verde’ grass + compost and T5-‘Sempre verde’ grass and T6-control without fertilization, totaling 24 experimental plots. The total area of the experimental plot was 1.44 m2, with useful area of 0.80 m2 and 21.0 t ha-1 of fertilizer (dry basis) were incorporated in each treatment. The radish crop was directly sown in the beds, in 2-to 3-cm-deep holes, leaving one plant at spacing of 20 cm between rows and 5 cm between plants. Twenty-nine days after planting, plants were evaluated for total yield, commercial yield, percentages of commercial roots (%) and waste roots (%), fresh and dry matter of shoots and roots, total and individual leaf area and the SPAD index. The incorporation of Leucaena at the amount of 21.0 t ha-1 (dry basis) promoted the highest increments for the analyzed characteristics. © 2016, Departamento de Engenharia Agricola - UFCG/Cnpq.

AB  - Spatial distribution pattern of Populus euphratica and P. pruinosa clonal ramets at three sites was studied, including natural mixed forest of P. euphratica and P. pruinosa in Awati County located in the downstream of Yarkant River, natural P. pruinosa forest in Group 16 of Nongyishi in the Tarim River upstream area, and natural P. euphratica forest in Luntai County located in the middle reach of the Tarim River. The clonal ramets of the three sites showed a cluster distribution pattern at eight sampling scales, i.e., 5 m×5 m, 5 m×10 m, 5 m×15 m, 10 m×10 m, 10 m×15 m, 15 m×15 m, 15 m×20 m, and 20 m×20 m. This pattern revealed that the cluster distribution was a basic property in the spatial distribution pattern of P. euphratica and P. pruinosa populations. At 5 m×5 m scale, negative binomial parameter was minimum, while Cassie index, patchiness index and aggregation strength were maximum for the two ramet populations at the three sites. © 2016, Science Press.

TI  - Trypsin inhibitor from Leucaena leucocephala seeds delays and disrupts the development of Aedes aegypti, a multiple-disease vector
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971328508&doi=10.1002%2fps.4284&partnerID=40&md5=1ff2e1df24d91a59bc1f6879803fce7f
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the Aedes aegypti mosquito represents a serious public health issue in view of the large outbreaks of the arboviral diseases zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. This holometabolous insect has midgut digestive enzymes that are trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like proteins. Protease inhibitors are able to bind to proteolytic enzymes and promote a blockage in digestion and nutrition, leading to death. Thus, we investigated the effect of trypsin inhibitor of Leucaena leucocephala (LTI) seeds on egg hatching, larval development and digestive midgut proteases. RESULTS: LTI was obtained by trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by a single chromatography step on anhydrous trypsin sepharose. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate showed a single protein band with a molecular mass close to 20 kDa. After exposure of Ae. aegypti eggs to LTI (0.3 mg mL−1), egg hatching was reduced (50%). LTI did not show acute toxicity on newly hatched larvae incubated under the same conditions, but after 10 days of exposure a high mortality rate (86%) was observed and the surviving larvae had a 25% delay in development. LTI was able to inhibit in vitro the midgut enzymatic activity (70%), and when larvae were incubated with LTI solution we observed an inhibition of 56%. CONCLUSIONS: LTI is a promising new tool to control critical points of Ae. aegypti development. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The research was developed in the growth phase of 80 males bovine (5/8Holstein x 3/8Zebu) cross during the dry period, with the objective of evaluate the effect of including Vinasse of distiller on the animals productive performance with leucaena. There were evaluated the following indicators: daily half gain, Vinasse intake, dry matter intake and pH of the rumen. A mixed lineal model was used. They were considered as fixed effect: fringes, paddocks and random effect, the animals in the system. There was difference (P<0.01) and higher dry matter intake in the grassland strips associated with leucaena. However, the Vinasse intake (P<0.01) was higher in the grassland strips. Therefore, the daily half gain was bigger (P<0.001) with 0.645 kg in the fringes associated with leucaena. There was not affectation of the ruminal pH. It is concludes that in the silvopastoril system the animal manifested a favorable behavior during the evaluated period. © 2016, Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.

TI  - Level of Leucaena leucocephala silage feeding on intake, rumen fermentation, and nutrient digestibility in dairy steers
PY  - 2016

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to determine effects of Leucaena silage (LS) feeding on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and rumen fermentation in dairy steers. Four rumen fistulated dairy steers, 167 ± 12 kg body weight (BW), were randomly assigned to receive dietary treatments according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Treatments were as follows: T1 = 100 % untreated rice straw (RS), T2 = 70 % RS + 30 % LS, T3 = 40 % RS + 60 % LS, and T4 = 100 % LS, respectively. All animals were fed rice straw and LS ad libitum with concentrate mixture supplemented at 0.2 % BW. The results found that dry matter intake and nutrient digestibility were the highest in dairy steers fed 60 % LS (P < 0.05). Ruminal temperature and pH were not affected by LS feeding (P > 0.05) while ruminal ammonia nitrogen and blood urea nitrogen concentration were linearly increased with increasing levels of LS feeding (P < 0.01). On the other hand, total volatile fatty acids and propionate (C3) were improved by LS feeding especially in steers fed 60 % LS (P < 0.05) whereas acetate (C2) production and C2/C3 ratio were decreased. Moreover, methane production was reduced together with increasing LS feeding level (P < 0.05). Based on this study, it could be concluded that 60 % LS feeding could enhance feed intake, digestibility, and rumen fermentation end-product while reducing methane production in dairy steers. This study suggested that LS could be used as high-quality roughage for ruminant feeding in the tropical region. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The productive performance of growing females of the Cuban Charolais breed under a silvopastoral system with Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru, in a 3 x 5 sowing frame, associated with an improved grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) was studied compared to a monoculture. The experiment was conducted at the Empresa de Genética y Cría "Manuel Fajardo", Granma province, Cuba. Thirty animals per cycle were used and the experiment lasted three years. Data were processed through a multivariate analysis and measurement of the impact index. The best live weights gains with 0.55 kg.animal.d-1 and age at incorporation to reproduction of the females of 19 months of age were obtained in the leucaena silvopastoral system. The best gain and the lowest cost per animals were recorded in the silvopastoral system. It is recommended using this leucaena sowing density for maintaining favorable total pasture productions, live weight gains and adequate weight for age relationship at the incorporation in rearing systems of replacement Cuban Charolais growing females.

TI  - Making a bad situation worse: An invasive species altering the balance of interactions between local species

AB  - Biological invasions pose a significant threat to biodiversity, especially on oceanic islands. One of the primary explanations for the success of plant invaders is direct suppression of competitors. However, indirect interactions can also be important, although they are often overlooked in studies on biological invasion. The shrub Leucaena leucocephala is a widespread island invader with putative allelopathic effects on the germination and growth of other species. We quantified the impact of Leucaena on plant communities richness on an oceanic Brazilian island and, through nursery experiments, investigated the potential for allelopathic effects on the germination of Erythrina velutina, a native species that is often absent from stands of Leucaena. Additionally, in a manipulative field experiment, we examined the direct and indirect effects (mediated by the native species Capparis flexuosa) of the invader on the development of Erythrina. The species richness in invaded sites was lower than in uninvaded sites, and Capparis was the only native species that was frequently present in invaded sites. In the nursery experiments, we found no evidence that Leucaena affects the germination of Erythrina. In the field experiments, the odds of Erythrina germination were lower in the presence of Leucaena litter, but higher in the presence of Leucaena trees. However, the survival and growth of Erythrina were considerably inhibited by the presence of Leucaena trees. The isolated effect of native Capparis on the germination and growth of Erythrina varied from positive to neutral. However, when Capparis and Leucaena were both present, their combined negative effects on Erythrina were worse than the effect of Leucaena alone, which may be attributed to indirect effects. This study provides the first empirical evidence that the balance of the interactions between native species can shift from neutral/positive to negative in the presence of an exotic species. © 2016 Mello, Oliveira.

TI  - Efficiency of sample-based indices for spatial pattern recognition of wild pistachio (Pistacia atlantica) trees in semi-arid woodlands
PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84952657630&doi=10.1007%2fs11676-015-0205-y&partnerID=40&md5=bb00151dc7a0e30d709d08ee98830361
AB  - The efficiency of sample-based indices proposed to quantify the spatial distribution of trees is influenced by the structure of tree stands, environmental heterogeneity and degree of aggregation. We evaluated 10 commonly used distance-based and 10 density-based indices using two structurally different stands of wild pistachio trees in the Zagros woodlands, Iran, to assess the reliability of each in revealing stand structure in woodlands. All trees were completely stem-mapped in a nearly pure (40 ha) and a mixed (45 ha) stand. First, the inhomogeneous pair correlation function [g(r)] and the Clark–Evans index (CEI) were used as references to reveal the true spatial arrangement of all trees in these stands. The sampled data were then evaluated using the 20 indices. Sampling was undertaken in a grid based on a square lattice using square plots (30 m × 30 m) and nearest neighbor distances at the sample points. The g(r) and CEI statistics showed that the wild pistachio trees were aggregated in both stands, although the degree of aggregation was markedly higher in the pure stand. Three distance- and six density-based indices statistically verified that the wild pistachio trees were aggregated in both stands. The distance-based Hines and Hines statistic (ht) and the density-based standardised Morisita (Ip), patchiness (IP) and Cassie (CA) indices revealed aggregation of the trees in the two structurally different stands in the Zagros woodlands and the higher clumping in the pure stand, whereas the other indices were not sensitive enough. © 2015, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sources and rates of organic waste and their interaction on the growth of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, in the Southeast region of Piauí State. The treatments consisted of two sources (Copernicia prunifera (Mill.) H.E. palm residue and plant compound) and six organic waste rates. The study was conducted in the period of March-June 2011 and the following parameters were evaluated: stem diameter, height, number of leaves, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, total dry matter, root volume, shoot dry weight/root dry weight ratio, height/stem diameter ratio and the Dickson Quality Index. The Copernicia prunifera (Mill.) H.E. palm residue and plant compound showed a great potential to be used in the manufacture of substrates for the production of seedlings Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, since their initial development was influenced by the sources and proportions of these organic residues and by the interaction between these treatments. The substrate containing 50% of plant compound produced better quality of plants of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in their initial development stage. © 2016, Departamento de Engenharia Agricola - UFCG/Cnpq.

AB  - We numerically investigate bouncing and non-bouncing of droplets during isothermal impact on superhydrophobic surfaces. An in-house, experimentally validated, finite element method-based computational model is employed to simulate the droplet impact dynamics and transient fluid flow within the droplet. The liquid–gas interface is tracked accurately in Lagrangian framework with dynamic wetting boundary condition at three-phase contact line. The interplay of kinetic, surface and gravitational energies is investigated via systematic variation of impact velocity and equilibrium contact angle. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the droplet bounces off the surface if the total droplet energy at the instance of maximum recoiling exceeds the initial surface and gravitational energy, otherwise not. The non-bouncing droplet is characterized by the oscillations on the free surface due to competition between the kinetic and surface energy. The droplet dimensions and shapes obtained at different times by the simulations are compared with the respective measurements available in the literature. Comparisons show good agreement of numerical data with measurements, and the computational model is able to reconstruct the bouncing and non-bouncing of the droplet as seen in the measurements. The simulated internal flow helps to understand the impact dynamics as well as the interplay of the associated energies during the bouncing and non-bouncing. A regime map is proposed to predict the bouncing and non-bouncing on a superhydrophobic surface with an equilibrium contact angle of 155°, using data of 86 simulations and the measurements available in the literature. We discuss the validity of the computational model for the wetting transition from Cassie to Wenzel state on micro- and nanostructured superhydrophobic surfaces. We demonstrate that the numerical simulation can serve as an important tool to quantify the internal flow, if the simulated droplet shapes match the respective measurements utilizing high-speed photography. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Overhead-irrigation with saline and alkaline water: Deleterious effects on foliage of Rhodes grass and leucaena
PY  - 2016

AB  - Saline and alkaline water represents a potentially valuable resource provided its irrigation does not decrease plant growth. Although the adverse effects of salts within the rooting environment are well-studied, comparatively little is known regarding the direct effects of overhead-irrigation of saline and alkaline water on plant foliage. The present study examined the potential deleterious effects of saline (electrical conductivity, EC, ≤15 dS m-1) and alkaline (≤2000 mg L-1, CaCO3 equivalent) water on foliage of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Reclaimer) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala ssp. glabrata cv. Tarramba) under a range of growing-conditions. Foliage of leucaena was sensitive, with necrosis and chlorosis evident for saline water at an EC ≥3 dS m-1 and alkaline water containing ≥500 mg L-1 (CaCO3 equivalent). For leucaena, this damage to the foliage reduced relative shoot fresh mass and chlorophyll fluorescence for saline-treatments, but alkalinity did not reduce relative shoot fresh mass or chlorophyll fluorescence in any treatment. In contrast to leucaena, relative shoot fresh mass of Rhodes grass was not reduced by foliar-applied salinity in any treatment (nor did alkalinity reduce growth of Rhodes grass). It was noted that growing conditions influenced the magnitude of the deleterious effects, with salinization of the soil slightly increasing tolerance to foliar-applied saline water for leucaena. This study has demonstrated that whilst saline and alkaline water can potentially be used for overhead irrigation, differences in observed tolerance exist between plant species, and are influenced by growing conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit has been used for various purposes such as treatment of stomach diseases, facilitation of abortion, contraception and the treatment of diabetes. Scientific information about this plant is limited. Therefore, this study investigated the antidiabetic and antioxidant activities and also the toxicity of seed extract from L. leucocephala (LLSE). Antidiabetic activity testing was carried out by giving LLSE at an oral dose of 250 mg/kg body weight to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats daily for 6 wk. The results revealed that LLSE significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the fasting blood glucose and the blood chemistry consisting of: albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total protein and red blood cells in the diabetic-treated rats compared to those in diabetic-untreated rats. LLSE slightly increased the serum insulin level in the diabetic-treated rats. Using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay showed that LLSE exhibited relatively low antioxidant activity with the concentration of a sample required for 50% scavenging of the DPPH free radical of 839.56 ± 37.34 μg/mL compared to vitamin C (1.48 ± 0.07 μg/mL). A spectrophotometric technique, based on the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent, revealed that the total phenolic compound contents of LLSE were 37.38 ± 0.49 mg GAE/g. LLSE at doses of 1000 mg/k body weight, 1500 mg/k body weight and 2000 mg/k body weight did not produce any symptoms of acute toxicity or mortality in the rats. These results indicated that seed extract from L. leucocephala has antidiabetic and antioxidant activities. The antioxidant activity is likely due to the phenolic content. An application of this extract should be considered as it can affect renal function by reducing the levels of albumin, ALP and total protein. © 2017 Kasetsart University

AB  - Water soluble gums also known as hydrocolloids are increasingly finding applications in the pharmaceutical and food industry due to their versatile functional properties. They possess considerable use in food and pharmaceutical industries as emulsifying, thickening and gelling agents. In the present investigation a heteropolysaccharide galactomannan was extracted from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) seeds by an aqueous method, characterized for its compositional analysis (mannose: galactose ratio), physicochemical and functional properties (solubility), and mechanical properties. The extracted gum was derivatized to form its carboxymethyl derivative and the method of its derivatization was optimized by varying the reaction parameters. The native and derivatized gum was characterized by FTIR, XRD, DSC, NMR, SEM and elemental analysis, etc. The yield of Leucaena leucocephala galactomannan (LLG) was found to be 20% (w/w). The optimized parameters for carboxymethylation reaction (degree of substitution 0.805) were found to be 6.0 g NaOH, 10.0 g MCA, at 60 °C for 4 h. The physicochemical and functional characteristics of native and derivatized gum suggest its potential role in food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Condensed tannins (CTs) are one of the promising compounds due to their potentially health-promoting qualities. In this study, CTs were extracted from a Leucaena leucocephala hybrid-Rendang and subjected to various biological studies including antioxidant (using Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assay), anti-microbial (against different pathogens) and cytotoxic activities (toward human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), human colon carcinoma (HT29), human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) and human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines) in cancer cells through in vitro experiments. The structural characteristics and purity of CTs extract were determined using 13C NMR. The results showed that CTs exhibited higher in vitro antioxidant activities (2257.12 ± 80.55 mg TEAC/g extract, 605.3 ± 1.82 mg TEAC/g extract and 1014.03 ± 1.20 mg TEAC/g extract in FRAP, ABTS and DPPH assay, respectively) and demonstrated anti-microbial activities toward selected Gram's positive and Gram's negative bacteria tested with MIC and MBC value at 6.25–50 mg/mL. Furthermore, among other selected cancer cells, CTs also demonstrated cytotoxic activity toward human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) (IC50 = 38.33 ± 2.08 μg/mL). Characteristic of apoptosis such as cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation and apoptotic bodies were shown in MCF-7. These preliminary investigations have provided scientific rationale to use CTs as an alternative therapy for various oxidative and inflammatory associated diseases. © 2016 Beijing Academy of Food Sciences

PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964715446&doi=10.1002%2fjobm.201500590&partnerID=40&md5=ba379d48dead8fda990c17d72eb445e0
AB  - The presence of the toxic amino acid mimosine in Leucaena leucocephala restricts its use as a protein source for ruminants. Rumen bacteria degrade mimosine to 3,4- and 2,3-dihydroxypyridine (DHP), which remain toxic. Synergistes jonesii is believed to be the main bacterium responsible for degradation of these toxic compounds but other bacteria may also be involved. In this study, a commercial inoculum provided by the Queensland's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry was screened for isolation and characterization of mimosine, 3,4- and 2,3-DHP degrading bacterial strains. A new medium for screening of 2,3-DHP degrading bacteria was developed. Molecular and biochemical approaches used in this study revealed four bacterial isolates - Streptococcus lutetiensis, Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacillus vitulinus, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens - to be able to completely degrade mimosine within 7 days of incubation. It was also observed that C. butyricum and L. vitulinus were able to partially degrade 2,3-DHP within 12 days of incubation, while S. lutetiensis, was able to fully degrade both 3,4 and 2,3 DHP. Collectively, we concluded that S. jonesii is not the sole bacterium responsible for detoxification of Leucaena. Comprehensive screening of rumen fluid of cattle grazing on Leucaena pastures is needed to identify additional mimosine-detoxifying bacteria and contribute to development of more effective inoculums to be used by farmers against Leucaena toxicity. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - In present study 20 diets were formulated using Heteropogon contortus (HC) grass with 5 tree leaves (Hardwickia binata-HB, Albizia lebbek-AL, Grewia optiva-GO, Anogeissus pendulla-AP and Leucaena leucocephala-LL) and 5 shrubs (Dichrostachys cineria-DC, Securengia virosa-SV, Zizyphus xylophyrus- ZX, Helictris isora-HI and Acacia catechu-AC) in 75:25 and 50:50 ratios, which were evaluated for their nutritional composition and in vitro nutrients digestibility, fermentation and gas production in sheep and goat rumen inoculums to select grass: tree leaves/shrubs species and their ratio for silipastoral system of small ruminants. Diets differed significantly (P < 0.05) in CP, NDF, ADF, cellulose and lignin contents. Diets with 50:50 and 75:25 ratios of HC grass with foliage also differed significantly (P < 0.05) in CP and fiber contents. Nutrients degradability differed significantly (P < 0.05) amongst diets in rumen inoculums of both sheep and goats and were similar between HC-foliage diets in 50:50 and 75:25 ratios. Sheep and goats had similar nutrients degradability, while sheep and goats tended to degrade more nutrients at 75:25 than 50:50 ratios, respectively. Diets degradability values for DM, CP, NDF and ADF were 62.73, 57.90, 47.22 and 42.75 in sheep and 63.22, 62.06, 49.22 and 42.77% in goats, respectively. Diets differed significantly (P < 0.05) for in vitro TVFA, total N and ammonia N concentration in rumen inoculum of sheep and goats. Total-N and ammonia-N was higher (P < 0.05) from diets with 50:50 ratio of HC grassfoliage diets than 75:25 ratio. Mean TVFA, total-N and ammonia-N contents were 62.38, 40.20 and 9.31 in sheep and 63.40 meq/l, 41.72 mg/100 ml and 9.45 mg/100 ml in goat's rumen liquor. Diets differed significantly (P < 0.05) in IVDMD, gas production and partition factor in both species. Gas production tended to be more in sheep (156.73) than goats inoculums (142.76 ml/g). Results showed that HC:LL and HC:GO diets are superior in nutrients content, digestibility and metabolites production, while sheep and goat exhibited relatively higher nutrients utilization and more total volatile fatty acid production at 75:25 and 50:50 ratios of HC-tree foliage diets, respectively.

TI  - Potential of different AM fungi (native from As-contaminated and uncontaminated soils) for supporting Leucaena leucocephala growth in As-contaminated soil

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi inoculation is considered a potential biotechnological tool for an eco-friendly remediation of hazardous contaminants. However, the mechanisms explaining how AM fungi attenuate the phytotoxicity of metal(oid)s, in particular arsenic (As), are still not fully understood. The influence of As on plant growth and the antioxidant system was studied in Leucaena leucocephala plants inoculated with different isolates of AM fungi and exposed to increasing concentrations of As (0, 35, and 75 mg dm−3) in a Typic Quartzipsamment soil. The study was conducted under greenhouse conditions using isolates of AM fungi selected from uncontaminated soils (Acaulospora morrowiae, Rhizophagus clarus, Gigaspora albida; and a mixed inoculum derived from combining these isolates, named AMF Mix) as well as a mix of three isolates from an As-contaminated soil (A. morrowiae, R. clarus, and Paraglomus occultum). After 21 weeks, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) were determined in the shoots in addition to measuring plant height and mineral contents. In general, AM fungi have shown multiple beneficial effects on L. leucocephala growth. Although the activity of most of the stress-related enzymes increased in plants associated with AM fungi, the percentage increase caused by adding As to the soil was even greater for non-mycorrhizal plants when compared to AM-fungi inoculated ones, which highlights the phytoprotective effect provided by the AM symbiosis. The highest P/As ratio observed in AM-fungi plants, compared to non-mycorrhizal ones, can be considered a good indicator that the AM fungi alter the pattern of As(V) uptake from As-contaminated soil. Our results underline the role of AM fungi in increasing the tolerance of L. leucocephala to As stress and emphasize the potential of the symbiosis L. leucocephala-R. clarus for As-phytostabilization at moderately As-contaminated soils. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Torrefaction, also known as mild pyrolysis, is often carried out between temperature ranges of 200 and 300oC in anoxic conditions. It is a type of thermo-chemical pre-treatment process applicable to biomass in order to convert it into compatible energy fuels. Torrefaction has favorable effects on biomass, which includes increasing its energy density and eliminating problems commonly associated with raw biomass such as high moisture content, hygroscopic behavior and low calorific value. In this study, torrefaction of agricultural residue, oil palm frond (non-woody biomass) and short rotation energy crop, Leucaena Leucocephala (woody biomass) were conducted in a horizontal tube furnace at five temperatures and holding time of 60 min. High heating values, elemental and proximate analyses results, thermal degradation profiles of torrefied fibrous products were compared to its raw forms. It was concluded that as torrefaction conditions became more severe, this led to a more qualified and energy-dense solid fuel with higher fixed carbon content, increased calorific values and reduced hydrogen and oxygen contents. The results gained from this study may provide basic information for torrefied products application in combustor and/or gasifier design. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Water use, root activity and deep drainage within a perennial legume-grass pasture: A case study in southern inland Queensland, Australia
PY  - 2016

AB  - Water use and depth of water extraction of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) pasture, irrigated with desalinated coal seam water (a by-product of the coal seam gas industry), were monitored to provide background information on root activity, spatial and temporal water use and deep drainage over a 757-day period from August 2011 to August 2013. Methodology comprised measurement of soil water from surface to 4 m depth using 8 EnviroSCAN probes connected to dataloggers positioned within leucaena twin rows and within the Rhodes grass inter-row. Just over 581,000 individual moisture measurements were collated and are reported here. Water extraction (and by inference root activity) of leucaena and Rhodes grass showed marked seasonal fluctuation with deepest and highest water extraction occurring during the first growing season; water extraction was greatly diminished during the following drier and cooler seasons due to the negative influences of lower soil moisture contents, lower temperatures and increased defoliation on pasture growth. The highest values of deep drainage below 4 m depth occurred when high rainfall events corresponded with high soil water storage in the entire profile (0-4 m depth). Given that water usage by both leucaena and Rhodes grass was greatest in the upper layers of soil (< 1.5 m), future research should focus on how the level of competitive interaction might be managed by choice of row spacing and frequency of irrigation. Further studies are needed, including: (a) physical sampling to determine the depth of active roots; (b) how defoliation affects rooting behaviors and water use of leucaena; and (c) modelling of the water and salt balances of leucaena and grass inter-row systems using data from this study, with various levels of irrigation, to investigate the risks of deep drainage over an extended climate sequence. © 2016.

TI  - RNA-seq analysis of the Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 transcriptome shows similarities in the activation patterns of symbiotic genes in the presence of apigenin and salt
PY  - 2016
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007595791&doi=10.1186%2fs12864-016-2543-3&partnerID=40&md5=b855fb19c974ad916d3e6bdcad282041
AB  - Background: Rhizobium tropici strain CIAT 899 establishes effective symbioses with several legume species, including Phaseolus vulgaris and Leucaena leucocephala. This bacterium synthesizes a large variety of nodulation factors in response to nod-gene inducing flavonoids and, surprisingly, also under salt stress conditions. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes in the presence of both inducer molecules, and analyze the promoter regions located upstream of these genes. Results: Results obtained by RNA-seq analyses of CIAT 899 induced with apigenin, a nod gene-inducing flavonoid for this strain, or salt allowed the identification of 19 and 790 differentially expressed genes, respectively. Fifteen of these genes were up-regulated in both conditions and were involved in the synthesis of both Nod factors and indole-3-acetic acid. Transcription of these genes was presumably activated through binding of at least one of the five NodD proteins present in this strain to specific nod box promoter sequences when the bacterium was induced by both apigenin and salt. Finally, under saline conditions, many other transcriptional responses were detected, including an increase in the transcription of genes involved in trehalose catabolism, chemotaxis and protein secretion, as well as ribosomal genes, and a decrease in the transcription of genes involved in transmembrane transport. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first time that a transcriptomic study shows that salt stress induces the expression of nodulation genes in the absence of flavonoids. Thus, in the presence of both nodulation inducer molecules, apigenin and salt, R. tropici CIAT 899 up-regulated the same set of symbiotic genes. It could be possible that the increases in the transcription levels of several genes related to nodulation under saline conditions could represent a strategy to establish symbiosis under abiotic stressing conditions. © 2016 Pérez-Montaño et al.

AB  - A study was conducted to assess the carcass characteristics of rabbits fed with tree fodders. Thirty two weaned bunnies of New Zealand White breed aged between seven to nine weeks were individually weighed and were randomized into 4 treatments with eight replicates (four males and four females) in each. The treatment groups were concentrate feed 50% of dry matter intake with Desmanthus virgatus (T1); Leucaena leucocephala (T2); Erythrina indica (T3) and Artocarpus heterophyllus (T4). The rabbits were slaughtered after eight weeks of growth trial and found that Erythrina indica could be included up to 50 % level since the carcass characteristics are comparable with desmanthus. The level of inclusion of Artocarpus heterophyllus and Leucaena leucocephala can be reduced (less than 50 %) to obtain better results on carcass characteristics.

AB  - Protein is a polypeptide, which is composed of a series of amino acids, with a relatively very large molecular weight, which ranges from 8,000 to 10,000 Da. Separation of protein can be done by chemical, enzymatic or using an ultrafiltration membrane. Applications of protein concentrates product depends on its functional properties such as water absorption, oil absorption capacity and power emulsions, and foaming power which will affect the quality of product. Food product that use protein concentrates in the form of sausages, meatballs, bakery and beverages. Techniques of membrane separation are generally based on particle size and molecular weight of the thrust in the form of pressure differences, and different electric field concentration. This study aims to determine the role of membrane ultrafiltration to separate proteins and produce the characteristic functional properties. This study used two main factors, ultrafiltration membrane pressure (2.33 atm, 3.66 atm) and the separation time (15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes). The resulted showed leucaena seed protein concentrates obtained from the best treatment of 3.66 atm pressure and separation time 45 minutes. Concentrates of leucaena seed had the functional properties of the water absorption capacity of 3.3 g water/g of solid, oil absorption capacity of 1.43 g of oil/g solid, Bulk density of 0.55 g/ml, power emulsion 51.11% and power foam 9.8%. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2016.

AB  - ABSTRACT: A diazotrophic bacterial strain denominated 11B isolated from the rhizosphere of a banana plant (Musa spp.) was characterized morphologically, biochemically, and phylogenetically, whereas the symbiotic potential of the strain was assessed through tests of host range, interstrain nodulation competitiveness, and capacity to synthesize indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and solubilize phosphate. Based on morphological and physiological–biochemical properties, as well as 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) sequence and phylogenetic analysis, the strain 11B belonged to the genus Rhizobium with 100.0% sequence similarity with Rhizobium tropici CAF440. The optimum growth temperature and pH for strain 11B are 28°C and 7.2, respectively. This strain was able to produce IAA, solubilize phosphate, and fix large amounts of nitrogen (N2) and form effective nodules on the legumes Acaciella angustissima, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Lysiloma acapulcensis, and Phaseolus vulgaris. The rhizobial strain 11B was used successfully as a biofertilizer in agriculturally important legumes, forest trees, and agroindustrial plants. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Reproductive behavior of crossbred dairy cows grazing an intensive silvopastoral system under tropical dry forest conditions
PY  - 2017
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016217101&doi=10.1590%2f1678-4162-8712&partnerID=40&md5=a32fda9aa9d2217f2289e49e217b3593
AB  - It is widely accepted that selection for high milk yield in dairy cows has negatively affected their reproductive performance. After calving, dairy cows experience a nutritional imbalance due to an asynchrony in the occurrence of the lactation and dry matter intake peaks. In the tropics, this situation is exacerbated due to poor quality and/ or availability of the diet. A study was carried out to describe the nutritional and reproductive behavior of two-to-four parturition crossbred cows (Gyr (Bos indicus) x Holstein (Bos taurus) divided in two groups according to their calving to first service interval (CFSI): Group 1: ≤50 days CFSI, n=7; Group 2: ≥50 days CFSI, n=8. Animals were grazing in an intensive silvopastoral system (ISS) based on Leucaena leucocephala and Cynodon plectostachyus and also received protein, energy and mineral supplementation. Dry matter (DMI) and nutrient intake were individually estimated and correlations between reproductive and nutritional parameters were performed. Additionally, serum progesterone concentration was monitored. Group 2 had greater forage and total DMI and milk production than Group 1 (P<0.05). Hence, Group 2 had greater nutrient intake from forages than Group 1 (P<0.05). Group 1 had a positive nutritional balance and an optimum reproductive performance compared to Group 2, which had a negative energy balance and lengthier days with open intervals (P<0.05). It was corroborated that protein and energy are required in adequate levels, to ensure that uterus undergoes involution correctly and ovarian activity starts soon in the postpartum period.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The amendment effect of Leucaena biochar was investigated in incubation study in acidic soil (pH (water (H2O)) = 4.5) of northwest India. The biochar (BC) was mixed at 2%, 4%, and 6% with soil and change in soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), ammonium (NH+         4) and nitrate nitrogen (NO-         3–N), exchangeable bases (calcium + magnesium, potassium, sodium) (Ca + Mg, K, Na), aluminum (Al), and Bray’s phosphorus (P) were measured periodically. The mean increase in soil pH was 0.65, 1.35, and 2.0 unit at 2%, 4%, and 6% (w/w) of biochar incorporation, respectively. Application of biochar significantly (P < 0.01) reduced ammonium (NH+         4–N) content of soil, whereas NO3-N concentration increased by threefold and fivefold by application of 2% and 4% (w/w) of biochar, respectively. Exchangeable soil potassium (K) and Ca + Mg concentrations increased with the application of biochar. Application of biochar above 2% (w/w) reduced exchangeable Al concentration to nondetectable limit. The study suggests Leucaena biochar may serve as an amendment for N transformation in highly acidic soil. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - An ex situ germplasm collection of the endangered Cycas micronesica was established in a transition zone between biodiverse native forest and mature stands of the invasive species Leucaena leucocephala. Soil chemical properties were determined for the 2 tree cover types to inform management decisions. Total carbon, total nitrogen, calcium, and net ammonification were greater in native forest cover than in L. leucocephala patches. Net nitrification and net mineralization were greater under L. leucocephala cover. Trace metals also differed between the 2 forest cover types, with chromium, cobalt, and nickel accumulating to greater concentration under L. leucocephala cover and zinc accumulating to greater concentration under native forest cover. The results indicated that L. leucocephala cover generated substantial changes in soil chemical properties when compared with native forest tree cover, illuminating one means by which understory vegetation may be affected by changes in invasive tree cover. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - A rapid growth of the meat production industry is necessary to satisfy increased demand for this commodity, which might have negative impacts on the environment. The objective of this study was to assess enteric methane (CH4) emissions when a forage legume is introduced in the diet of animals consuming a tropical grass. Eight Lucerna heifers, 218±18 kg live weight with an average age of 19±3 months were used in two experiments following a changeover design. The diets evaluated were 100% star grass (Cynodon plectostachyus, S) or 76% star grass plus 24% leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala, S+L). Throughout the experiment, animals were housed in two chambers, in which the diet was offered four times daily. Each chamber had a small wind tunnel, which housed a fan set to a constant speed of extraction. Air samples were obtained every hour during 24 h both inside and outside (ambient) the tunnel. Methane concentration in these samples was determined by gas chromatography. Temperature and relative humidity both inside and outside the tunnel were recorded using a thermo-hygrometer. The S+L diet had greater protein content whereas the S diet had greater content of neutral detergent fiber. Average intake (kg/d) of fresh forage and dry matter (DM) was significantly greater (23.7 and 5.6) for the S+L than for the S diet (18.9 and 4.7), respectively (P<0.05). The maximum recorded temperature and humidity inside the chamber was 35.5 °C and 99%, respectively, but the minimum values were 19.1 °C and 38%, respectively. Methane production (L/kg DMI) was 37.7 for the S+L treatment and 43. 6 for the S treatment. The energy loss in the form of methane emitted was 8.0% for S+L and 9.4% for the star grass based diet (P=0.32). These results suggest that while increasing animal productivity by increasing dry matter intake, the inclusion of leucaena does not increase methane emission per animal, thus significantly decreasing methane emissions per kg of meat or milk produced. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of biomass as raw material in renewable energy production has been studied as alternative source to fossil fuels. The aim of the current study is to physicochemical characterization of the biomass of Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) tree species in order to produce briquettes. Leucaena wood treated with three moisture levels - T1 (10%), T2 (12%) and T3 (15%) - was used to produce briquettes. The study was divided in the following stages: Analyzing the grinding material and the lignin and cellulose particle size distribution, chemical analysis, calorific value determination, briquetting and mechanical testing. The results were statistically analyzed through ANOVA and Tukey tests. The species showed satisfactory performance in the following assessed aspects: lignin content (22.61%), ash content (2.15%), and calorific value (4442.29 kcal.kg-1). As for the influence of the moisture content, the best results were found in treatment T2 (12%), wherein the mean maximum force was 51.22 kgf, the maximum strain was 0.41 MPa, and friability was 4.07%. It was shown that the moisture content Changes briuettes' stability and strength. The species showed satisfactory features regaeding the purpose suggested for all treatments, as well as its potential to be used in bioenergy production.

AB  - The heavy reliance on non-renewable energy sources from fossil fuel such as petroleum, natural gas and coal has led to the scarcity of these sources and occurrence of global warming. This phenomenon raises the public concerns to diversify the energy sources to sustain energy availability. To address these predicaments, biomass is among the prominent alternative energy sources since it is renewable and possesses minimal harms to the environment. Leucaena leucocephala, or locally known as 'Petai Belalang' is one of the potential energy crops. In thi study, 3 portions of Leucaena leucocephala stem which are bottom, middle and top have been divided and 2 different particle sizes which are 0.5 and 1.5 mm were used to determine their influences on the properties of the samples. Proximate analysis (moisture content, volatile matter, ash content and fixed carbon), physical analysis (specific gravity and bulk density) plus calorific value of Leucaena leucocephala were conducted as the parameters to determine the properties of the samples. Among the proximate parameters, portions differ significantly (p < 0.01) in moisture content, volatile mater and ash content except for fixed carbon. Whereas, particle sizes shown significant differences (p < 0.01) in moisture content, ash content and fixed carbon while differing (p < 0.05) in volatile matters. Both independent factors differ significantly (p < 0.01) in the physical parameters, including specific gravity and bulk density. The highest calorific value was observed in the bottom portion with particle size 0.5 mm which is 18.56 MJ/kg, whereas calorific values are significantly differing (p < 0.01) for both independent factors. In conclusion, Leucaena leucocephala species show a good result to be as potential biomass energy sources. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN). All rights reserved.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems can be a good alternative for sustainable livestock production because they can provide ecosystem services and improve animal welfare. Most farm animals live in groups and the social organization and interactions between individuals have an impact on their welfare. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe and compare the social behaviour of cattle (Bos indicus×Bos taurus) in a silvopastoral system based on a high density of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) combined with Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus), star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) and some trees; with a monoculture system with C. nlemfuensis, in the region of Merida, Yucatán. Eight heifers in each system were observed from 0730 to 1530 h each day for 12 consecutive days during the dry season and 12 consecutive days during the rainy season. The animals followed a rotation between three paddocks, remaining 4 days in each paddock. The vegetation was characterized in the paddocks of the silvopastoral system to estimate the average percentage of shade provided. To make a comparison between systems, we used a t test with group dispersion, and Mann-Whitney tests with the frequency of affiliative and agonistic behaviours. We assessed differences in linearity and stability of dominance hierarchies using Landau's index and Dietz R-test, respectively. The distance of cows with respect to the centroid of the group was shorter, and non-agonistic behaviours were 62% more frequent in the intensive silvopastoral system than in the monoculture one. Heifers in the silvopastoral system had a more linear and non-random dominance hierarchy in both seasons (dry season: h'=0.964; rainy season: h'=0.988), than heifers in the monoculture system (dry season: h'=0.571, rainy season: h'=0.536). The dominance hierarchy in the silvopastoral system was more stable between seasons (R-test=0.779) than in the monoculture system (R-test=0.224). Our results provide the first evidence that heifers in the silvopastoral system maintain more stable social hierarchies and express more sociopositive behaviours, suggesting that animal welfare was enhanced. © 2015 The Animal Consortium.

AB  - A study on the chemical composition of Albizia lebbeck, Leucaena leucocephala, Morinda lucida and Senna siamea at various harvesting periods was conducted at the “Institut National Supérieur d’Agronomie et de Biotechnologies”, Franceville (Gabon) and the Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, University of Dschang, Cameroon (analysis) from June to December, 2014. The leaves of each species were collected on various sites at Franceville on three different periods separated by 45 days, at the beginning, at mid-season and the end of the dry season. They were dried and crushed to determine their chemical composition. The results showed that the variations of dry matter (DM), ashes and organic matter (OM) content, were not significantly different (p>0.05) between the 4 species, at each harvesting period. But in the first harvest, the crud protein (CP) content of A. lebbeck (30.29% DM) was significantly higher than the other ones. Also, at the end of the dry season the CP of A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala were comparable (p>0.05) and significantly higher (p<0.05) than those of M. lucida and S. siamea. In addition, condensed tannins contents of M. lucida were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those of A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala at each collecting period. Moreover, gallic tannins were not present in A. lebbeck and M. lucida leaves. In conclusion, those ligneous species can constitute alternative forages in complement of grass in dry season for livestock feeding, mainly A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala. © 2017 Fundacion CIPAV.

AB  - The role of β-carbonic anhydrases (CAs) in C3 plant carbon assimilation is not clear. In this study, the primary role of C3 plant β-CAs in carbon assimilation was investigated for which, a chloroplastic β-CA gene (cacp) and a cytoplasmic β-CA gene (cacyt) from a C3 tree-legume of tropics, Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) were overexpressed in Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco). The cacp and cacyt β-CA isoforms from leucaena were overexpressed separately and also together in tobacco resulting in three types of transgenic tobacco plants (i) expressing cacp only (ii) expressing cacyt only and (iii) co-expressing both cacp and cacyt. These transgenic plants exhibited significantly higher activity of β-CAs as compared with wild-type plants. The percent increase in the CA activity of transgenic plants expressing leucaena cacyt or cacp was found to be ∼51 and ∼55%, respectively. The transgenic tobacco expressing both the leucaena β-CA isoforms exhibited ∼63% increase in CA activity as compared with the wild-type. However, despite notable increase in the CA activity of transgenic tobacco plants, no difference was observed in their phenotype, chlorophyll content and the overall dry weight compared with that of wild-type suggesting that C3 β-CAs are not involved in active accumulation of inorganic carbon. © 2015 Società Botanica Italiana.

TI  - Gastrointestinal nematode infection does not affect selection of tropical foliage by goats in a cafeteria trial

AB  - It is important to determine whether gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) affect foliage choice of goats leading to confirm the expression of a self-medication behavior. This study investigated the effect of GIN infection on tropical foliage selection by goats. During experimental stage 1 (10 days), goats had a natural mixed GIN infection, and at stage 2 (10 days), goats were treated with effective anthelmintics to maintain them free of GIN infection. During stage 1 the twelve adult goats (32 ± 2.3 kg live weight [LW]) were assigned to three groups (n = 4) according to their initial GIN infection status: HI group, with fecal egg count (FEC) between 1450 and 2150 eggs per g/feces (EPG); MI group, medium FEC (592–1167 EPG); and the NI group, free from GIN infection. Fresh foliage of four tropical plants were offered to goats ad libitum for 1 h daily: Gymnopodium floribundum (high condensed tannin [CT] content, 37–40 %), Mimosa bahamensis (medium CT content, 16–17 %), Leucaena leucocephala (low CT content, 3–5 %), and Viguiera dentata (negligible CT content, 0.6–0.9 %). Jacobs’ selection indexes (JSIs) were estimated for the experimental foliage based on dry matter (DM), CT, or crude protein (CP) intake. During both study stages, individual fecal egg counts were estimated. The JSI patterns of different plant species, based on DM, CT, or CP, were similar irrespective of infection level during stage 1 (HI, MI, and NI) or no GIN infection (stage 2). Thus, irrespective of GIN infection, goats actively selected M. bahamensis (high CT, low CP content) and V. dentata (negligible CT, high CP content) but avoided G. floribundum (high CT, low CP content) and L. leucocephala (medium CT and high CP content). Thus, natural GIN infection did not influence goats’ foliage selection. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Intensive silvopastoral system (ISS) is a successful sustainable grazing system for dual-purpose cattle with growing adoption in the tropics; however, there is a concern on the quality of dairy products from this system. The aim of this study was to compare the ISS with the traditional monoculture system (MS) in terms of milk composition, soft cheese composition and yield, and the sensory acceptability of cheese during two seasons of a tropical area in Mexico. Twenty-four cows at the first 3 months postpartum were allocated evenly to two groups. The cows in ISS grazed in paddocks of Leucaena leucocephala associated with Cynodon nlemfuensis whereas the cows in MS grazed in C. nlemfuensis. Milk samples were collected weekly during the rainy and dry seasons for chemical analysis and fresh soft cheese making. The cheese was analyzed chemically, and cheese acceptability was evaluated for the sensory attributes of appearance, texture, flavor, color, and overall acceptability. Milk percentages of fat, protein, SNF, and lactose did not differ significantly between systems being, 3.5, 3.0, 8.1, and 4.4 in ISS and 3.6, 2.9, 8.0, and 4.4 in MS, respectively. Similar results were obtained for cheese content of fat/DM and protein/DM. In the rainy season, adjusted cheese yield from ISS (24.2%) was higher compared with MS (20.8%). Cheese texture in the dry season showed more acceptability for ISS. This study provide absence of adverse effect of ISS on milk and cheese composition; moreover, ISS improve the yield and acceptability of soft cheese. © 2015, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.

TI  - Potential of tannin-rich plants, Leucaena leucocephala, Glyricidia sepium and Manihot esculenta, to reduce enteric methane emissions in sheep

AB  - An in vivo trial was conducted in sheep to investigate the effect of three tropical tannin-rich plants (TRP) on methane emission, intake and digestibility. The TRP used were leaves of Glyricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Manihot esculenta that contained, respectively, 39, 75 and 92 g condensed tannins/kg DM. Methane was determined with the sulphur hexafluoride tracer technique. Eight rumen-cannulated sheep of two breeds (four Texel, four Blackbelly) were used in two 4 × 4 Latin square designs. Four experimental diets were tested. They consisted in a tropical natural grassland hay based on Dichanthium spp. fed alone (C) or in association with G. sepium (G), L. leucocephala (L) or M. esculenta (M) given as pellets at 44% of the daily ration. Daily organic matter intake was higher in TRP diets (686, 984, 1054 and 1186 g/day for C, G, L and M respectively; p < 0.05) while apparent organic matter total tract digestibility was not affected (69.9%, 62.8%, 65.3% and 64.7% for C, G, L and M respectively; p > 0.05). Methane emission was 47.1, 44.9, 33.3 and 33.5 g/kg digestible organic matter intake for C, G, L and M, respectively, and was significantly lower (p < 0.05) for L and M than for G and C. Our results confirm the potential of some TRP to reduce methane production. The strong decrease in methane and the increase in intake with TRPs may be due to their presentation as pellets.

AB  - Amirta R, Mukhdlor A, Mujiasih D, Septia E, Supriadi, Susanto D. 2016. Suitability and availability analysis of tropical forest wood species for ethanol production: a case study in East Kalimantan. Biodiversitas 17: 544-552. Fifteen species of woody biomass from tropical forest of East Kalimantan, Indonesia and identified as Acacia mangium, Aleurites moluccana, Alstonia scholaris, Anthocephalus cadamba, Artocarpus altilis, Artocarpus elasticus, Cananga odorata, Gmelina arborea, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Leucaena leucocephala, Macaranga gigantea, Macaranga tanarius, Paraserianthes falcataria, Shorea leprosula and Swietenia macrophylla were characterized and studied to find out and discover their potential utilization as suitable feedstocks for biofuel (ethanol) production. Characterization was done by evaluation of lignin, holocellulose and cellulose contents of woody biomass including the yield of reducing sugar (saccharification) after pretreated with alkaline (NaOH) at moderate temperature. Among 15 species of tropical forest wood biomass evaluated, our findings showed that M. gigantea was gave the highest yield of saccharified sugar (42.22%, weight of original wood dry basis) and also yield of theoretical ethanol (± 273 L/ton). We also found growth of M. gigantea was very fast to produce approximately 26,119 kg ha-1 dry biomass within 3 years. In general, the tropical wood biomass such as M. gigantea, A. moluccana, G. arborea, A. cadamba, and P. falcataria are suitable and potentially to be used as feedstocks for ethanol production due to their fast growing ability, availability and attractive chemical composition to produce high saccharified sugar and yield of ethanol. © 2016, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - With the objective to evaluate the factors that affect performance related to the association of a mixture of pasture and Leucaena leucocephala ‘Perú’ for the end of cattle fattening, 22 fattening cycles were assessed in zebu bulls at the Represa #1 unit of Rectángulo de ceba in Camagüey, Cuba, from 2002 to 2012. Soil is brown without carbonates. The climate is savannah tropical wet (Aw) with 1183 mm of annual rainfall. The factors evaluated were: stocking rate (a/ha) and years assessed. The changes in the percentage of the pasture and Leucaena populations were recorded through plant counting. Daily weight gain indexes, income and expenses per operation were assessed. Leucaena ‘Perú’ reached final values of 93% (p<0.05) in its population, with an increase in the populations of Guinea grass and other pastures. High income was reached for the lowest charge (p<0.05) with 0.981 kg/a/d. Silvopastoral technology with the association of Leucaena leucocephala ‘Perú’-dryland grasses, allowed to obtain average daily weight gains over 0.800 kg/a/d at the end of the fattening of bulls which were held for ten years of evaluations with very suitable economic results according to such technology and the inputs levels applied. © 2016, Universidad de Cordoba,Servicio de Publicaciones.

AB  - The initial growth of moringa (Moringa oleifera), cañafistula (Peltophorum dubium) and leucena (Leucaena leucocephala) fertilized with increased dose of pig biofertilizer was studied. A complete randomized design with 12 repetitions per treatment was used. The experiment was conducted in the field using a distance of 3 × 3 m for planting and two applications of biofetilizer dose were made at 2 and 11 months after planting, always applied on the surface. For the three species the use of pig biofertilizers was efficient. The growth in height and diameter for moringa, increased linearly with the increasing doses of pig biofertilizer up to the maximum dose (12.4 liters/plant). In case of leguminous species, caña fistula and leucaena, this increase was only found until doses up to 6.2 liters/plant. It is concluded that the use of pig biofertilizers can be efficient in the initial culture of the tree species studied. © 2016, Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.

AB  - Superhydrophobicity facilitates the development of self-cleaning, anti-biofouling, and anti-corrosion surfaces. The leaves of the lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) and taro (Colocasia esculenta) plants are well known for their self-cleaning properties. A hierarchical structure comprising papillae epidermal cells superimposed with epicuticular wax crystalloids of varying shapes, sizes, and orientations is an important aspect of the surface of these plant leaves. We fabricated two types of hierarchical structures biomimicking the surface topography of the lotus leaf. The hierarchical patterns successfully demonstrated the superhydrophobic state in comparison with nano and micro patterns. We used the finite element method (FEM) to simulate and understand the wetting process. The FEM simulations showed good correlation with the experimental results. FEM was helpful in understanding the wetting of enormously complex biological surfaces with relative ease, and it qualifies as a potential tool for designing superhydrophobic surfaces. Using the FEM framework, we further designed surfaces to optimize the order of the shapes in hierarchy. The results showed that the superhydrophobic surface with the lowest wetted area was obtained by placing shapes with smaller geometric angles at the top of the hierarchy. This arrangement of shapes provides the optimum combination of superhydrophobicity and surface integrity. This observation explains why the hierarchical structure of many superhydrophobic leaves follows this order. We also investigated the complex hierarchical structure of Salvinia minima. Owing to its remarkable ability to entrap air and pin the contact line, it exhibits superhydrophobicity along with the much-required Cassie state. These properties of Salvinia minima make it an excellent candidate for developing omniphobic surfaces. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Invasive white leadtrees (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) are contributing to the destruction of coastal ecosystems and biodiversity in humid subtropical and tropical regions. Sudden clearcutting of invasive tress can lead to substantial soil loss, which subsequently reduces the efficiency when indigenous vegetation is restored. Soil samples (n=142) were collected using the grid method to measure soil properties and to spatially analyze the soil erosion potential in the studied area after clearcutting of the invasive trees. Results indicated that the soil erosion rates ranged from 21 to 249 tons ha-1 yr-1, and the eroded soil depths ranged from 0.30 to 3.40 cm yr-1 after clearcutting. The network measurements for determining the mortality ratio of the restored indigenous vegetation demonstrated that Ficus benjamina L., Macaranga tanarius, and Scaevola taccada (Gaertner) Roxb were likely to be susceptible to damage from the substantial amount of soil loss and low SOC content. During the period between clearcutting and establishing the next stand of plants for reforestation, the network measurements for determining the soil properties and estimating the spatial heterogeneity of soil erosion potential are regarded as a major issue of concern regarding the efficiency of subsequent restoration efforts. © 2015 Shih-Hao Jien et al.

AB  - Thirty root-nodulating bacteria isolates were obtained from the roots of Acacia ampliceps (Maslin), A. ehrenbergiana (Hayne.), A. saligna (Labill.), A. seyal (Del.), A. tortilis (Forssk.), A tortilis subsp. raddiana (Savl.), Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) and Vicia faba (L.) trees growing In the Riyadh region. The isolates' phenotypic and biochemical properties were characterized by assessing colony appearance, growth rate, resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals, and tolerance to salinity, elevated temperature and pH. All Isolates had same colony morphology and grew on yeast extract mannltol and tryptone yeast agar, but not MGS media. The results also revealed considerable diversity among the Isolates, which exhibited different patterns of resistance to abiotic stresses. Most isolates tolerated temperatures up to 37°C and could grow from pH 5.5-8.5 and at a high NaCI concentration (2% w/v). The majority of isolates could utilize a variety of carbohydrates. Most of the isolates displayed resistance to antibiotics in the 75 μg ml-1 range, with ∼100 μg ml-1 the maximum concentration at which growth was observed. All Isolates were sensitive to aluminum and resistant to other heavy metals tested, and they were able to reduce nitrate and hydrolyze urea. ©Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

AB  - Here we examine the concordance among emissions, production and gross margins of extensive beef farming systems by modelling a range of scenarios for herd management, animal genotype and pasture nutritive quality. We based our simulations on a case-study farm in central Queensland, Australia, and studied the influence of interventions designed for emissions mitigation, increasing productivity, or increasing gross margin. Interventions included replacing urea supplementation with nitrate, finishing cattle on the perennial forage leucaena (L), herd structure optimisation (HO), higher female fecundity (HF), and a leucaena finishing enterprise that had net farm emissions equal to the baseline (leucaena equal emissions; LEE). The HO intervention reduced the ratio of breeding cows relative to steers and unmated heifers, and lowered the ratio of costs to net cattle sales. Gross margin of the baseline, nitrate, L, LEE, HO and HF scenarios were AU$146000, AU$91000, AU$153000, AU$170000, AU$204000 and AU$216000, respectively. Enterprises with early joining of maiden heifers as well as HO and HF further increased gross margin (AU$323000), while systems incorporating all compatible interventions (HO, HF, early joining, LEE) had a gross margin of AU$315000. We showed that interventions that increase liveweight turnoff while maintaining net farm emissions resulted in higher gross margins than did interventions that maintained liveweight production and reduced net emissions. A key insight of this work was that the relationship between emissions intensity (emissions per unit liveweight production) or liveweight turnoff with gross margin were negative and positive, respectively, but only when combinations of (compatible) interventions were included in the dataset. For example, herd optimisation by reducing the number of breeding cows and increasing the number of sale animals increased gross margin by 40%, but this intervention had little effect on liveweight turnoff and emissions intensity. However, when herd optimisation was combined with other interventions that increased production, gross margins increased and emissions intensity declined. This is a fortuitous outcome, since it implies that imposing more interventions with the potential to profitably enhance liveweight turnoff allows a greater reduction in emissions intensity, but only when each intervention works synergistically with those already in place. © CSIRO 2016.

AB  - The legume Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) is widely used to supplement forage in silvopastoral livestock systems in Latin America. Little is known about its possible effects on the cow reproductive dynamic. The aim was to evaluate the effect of Leucaena foliage intake on re-establishment of ovarian activity and estrus behavior in early postpartum (7–90 days) cows. Twenty-four multiparous Bos taurus × Bos indicus cows were divided into two homogenous groups and assigned to one of two treatments: a silvopastoral system (SS, n = 12), consisting of an association of Cynodon nlemfuensis grass and L. leucocephala; and a control system (CS, n = 12), consisting of C. nlemfuensis alone. Intake of Leucaena in the SS ranged from 3.80 to 6.43 kg DM/cow/day. Plasma mimosine concentrations ranged from 1270 to 1530 μg/mL, and those for 2,3-dihydroxypyridine (DHP) from 147 to 729 μg/mL. No 3,4-DHP was detected in plasma. No difference (P > 0.05) between treatments was observed for the number of cows exhibiting small, medium, or dominant follicles, or estrus behavior. The number of cows which re-established ovarian cyclicity (n = 6) was lower (P < 0.05) in the SS than in the CS (n = 9). Corpus luteum lifespan was longer (P < 0.05) in the SS than in the CS. Intake of Leucaena affected the number of cows exhibiting ovarian cyclicity and extended corpus luteum life, but did not affect follicular development and estrus behavior. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Integrated soil fertility management systems with inclusion of woody fallow species have been intensively investigated in tropical West Africa during the last few decades as a resource management alternative to the traditional bush fallow. Traditional farmers have integrated woody species in multistory home gardens, agroforests, alley cropping, and intercropped systems in the humid zone and in parkland agroforestry in the subhumid zone. Woody species play a significant role in maintaining soil fertility and productivity in these systems. In the humid zone, the effect of woody species in fallow system on soil fertility varies with species and soil factors. The effect is more pronounced on the high base status than on the low base status and acidic soil. Most of the plant nutrients in planted fallow are held in the biomass and will only be released following land clearing and burning. Agroforestry systems, such as the home garden, can have high fertility even on acidic soils. Traditional farmers readily plant woody fallow species if there is sufficient incentive as shown by the oil palm system in the Benin Republic and Togo. More effort is therefore needed to increase the productivity of the traditional agroforestry systems which play a significant role on environmental stability and to avoid their demise in the future. Among the agroforestry systems, the alley cropping system is the most researched and tested in the last two decades. There now exist a vast literature on the biophysical interactions of crops and hedgerow species and on the performance and limitations of the technology. The technology performs best for the humid and moist savanna zones on high base status soils with the currently available hedgerow species. Further research is needed to better assess the potential and suitability of the technology for low fertility and acidic soils. On high base status soils alley cropping can provide large amount of biomass and nutrient yield, necessary to maintain long-term productivity of the low activity clay (LAC) soils and supplement nutrients for the associated crops. Long-term trial data with N2 fixing hedgerows such as Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and Gliricidia sepium H.B. & K. demonstrate that reasonable maize (Zea mays L.) yield can be obtained with no N input, and higher yields of maize have been sustained surpassing the fertilized control with moderate N fertilizer input. Despite some reservations raised about the alley cropping technology, the vast literature available gives evidence that alley cropping is a sustainable agriculture technology for the LAC soils. With the increased knowledge gained from research over the past decade, it should be possible to better design alley cropping systems that are more efficient at supplying nutrients to, and compete less with crops. Compared to other fallow improvement technologies, the slow adoption rate for alley cropping in West Africa is not unusual and was originally based on unrealistic expectations. Evidence from recent studies shows that earlier skepticism about the potential adoption of the technology appears to be unjustified. Despite an initial low level of interest in alley farming, the technology is being adopted in Benin Republic, Cameroon, and Nigeria. Integration of farmers' modification of the technology and better targeting to areas where incentives for land use changes exist or are likely to occur in the near future could enhance adoption of the technology. A main research challenge in the new millennium is to increase efforts to find viable and acceptable interventions that can be of direct benefit for the farmers. © 2001.

AB  - This work evaluated the effect of the different ages of regrowth of Leucaena leucocephala, associated with forage grasses on forage intake and the goats behavior in silvopastoral system. We adopted a completely randomized design with three treatments and five replications. Reviewed by three regrowth ages of leucaena 45; 60 and 75 days, with five days of occupation. The herbaceous layer was managed aged 30 days of regrowth; females were crossbred Anglonubian the race, whose behavior in grazing was observed every ten minutes, from 8h to 17h. During the activities of the animals as rumination, idle, movement and grazing, was identified which the food supply if leucaena or herbaceous. Every two hours were measured bite rate, taking into account the time spent by the animals to carry out 20 arrests. For the evaluation of consumption was carried out grazing test in three days of paddock occupation. The grazing time was the most activity performed by animals with 7,34h and did not differ significantly (P>0.05) between the ages of regrowth, followed by travel times (1,36h), rumination (0,51h) and leisure (0,39h). There was no significant difference (P>0.05) for the bite rate, mass total forage intake rate, and daily consumption. The management of regrowth ages of leucaena in silvopastoral system contributes to the satisfaction of the production of forage grasses and leucaena and does not interfere with grazing behavior and ingestive goats. The grasses are in the most preferred component of the diet of goats in silvopastoral system: leucaena-grass forage.

TI  - Two types of Cassie-to-Wenzel wetting transitions on superhydrophobic surfaces during drop impact
PY  - 2015

AB  - Despite the fact that superhydrophobic surfaces possess useful and unique properties, their practical application has remained limited by durability issues. Among those, the wetting transition, whereby a surface gets impregnated by the liquid and permanently loses its superhydrophobicity, certainly constitutes the most limiting aspect under many realistic conditions. In this study, we revisit this so-called Cassie-to-Wenzel transition (CWT) under the broadly encountered situation of liquid drop impact. Using model hydrophobic micropillar surfaces of various geometrical characteristics and high speed imaging, we identify that CWT can occur through different mechanisms, and at different impact stages. At early impact stages, right after contact, CWT occurs through the well established dynamic pressure scenario of which we provide here a fully quantitative description. Comparing the critical wetting pressure of surfaces and the theoretical pressure distribution inside the liquid drop, we provide not only the CWT threshold but also the hardly reported wetted area which directly affects the surface spoiling. At a later stage, we report for the first time to our knowledge, a new CWT which occurs during the drop recoil toward bouncing. With the help of numerical simulations, we discuss the mechanism underlying this new transition and provide a simple model based on impulse conservation which successfully captures the transition threshold. By shedding light on the complex interaction between impacting water drops and surface structures, the present study will facilitate designing superhydrophobic surfaces with a desirable wetting state during drop impact. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.

AB  - Anticipated increases in the frequency of heat waves and drought spells may have negative effects on the ability of leguminous trees to fix nitrogen (N). In seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala inoculated with Mesorhizobium loti or Rhizobium tropici, we investigated how the developmental stage and a short drought influenced overall biomass and the accumulation of carbon and N in plant tissues. In early developmental stages, the number of nodules and nodule biomass were correlated with total plant biomass and δ15N, and nodules and roots contributed 33%-35% of the seedling total N. Seedlings associated with R. tropici fixed more N and exhibited higher overall biomass compared with M. loti seedlings. Four and a half months after inoculation (140 days after inoculation, DAI), a short (15-day) drought inhibited seedling growth and caused a decline in total plant N, with the smallest decline in R. tropici seedlings. After 15 days of drought, i.e., 155 DAI, the nodules had accumulated proline, but the total amino acid concentration did not change. Our results indicate that N-fixation is independent of seedlings growth. In addition, R. tropici is a better choice than M. loti as a symbiont for Leucaena seedlings for forest restoration and agroforestry applications under increasingly drier conditions. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - The leucaena is a leguminous that has high protein content and digestibility, can be supplied fresh or made into hay. The objective was to verify the influence of dehydration time of leaves and fine stems of leucaena and storage time on their chemical-bromatological characteristics. Cutting the fractions to be haymaking (leaves and stems smaller than one centimeter) was deposited on a plastic canvas for dehydration, being collected samples of the material at 0, 4th, 8th, 24th and 48th hours of dehydration to determine the levels of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), total carbohydrates (TC), not fibrous carbohydrates (NFC), ether extract (EE) and mineral matter (MM). The bales of hay were made using a manual baler and were kept stored in environment shaded, ventilated and protected of rain for 90 days. In that bales also were collected samples monthly to determine if occurred losses in nutritional quality. The dehydration time for 24 hours and storage for 30 days in water and allowed to dry to obtain the best chemical-bromatological composition of leucaena hay. The levels of CP, NDF, EE and MM decrease as function of drying time and storage both during the rainy as in the dry season, while the DM, TC and NFC increased due to these variables for both periods. © 2015, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia.

AB  - Liquid water can become metastable with respect to its vapor in hydrophobic confinement. The resulting dewetting transitions are often impeded by large kinetic barriers. According to macroscopic theory, such barriers arise from the free energy required to nucleate a critical vapor tube that spans the region between two hydrophobic surfaces-tubes with smaller radii collapse, whereas larger ones grow to dry the entire confined region. Using extensive molecular simulations of water between two nanoscopic hydrophobic surfaces, in conjunction with advanced sampling techniques, here we show that for intersurface separations that thermodynamically favor dewetting, the barrier to dewetting does not correspond to the formation of a (classical) critical vapor tube. Instead, it corresponds to an abrupt transition froman isolated cavity adjacent to one of the confining surfaces to a gap-spanning vapor tube that is already larger than the critical vapor tube anticipated by macroscopic theory. Correspondingly, the barrier to dewetting is also smaller than the classical expectation. We show that the peculiar nature of water density fluctuations adjacent to extended hydrophobic surfaces- namely, the enhanced likelihood of observing low-density fluctuations relative to Gaussian statistics-facilitates this nonclassical behavior. By stabilizing isolated cavities relative to vapor tubes, enhanced water density fluctuations thus stabilize novel pathways, which circumvent the classical barriers and offer diminished resistance to dewetting. Our results thus suggest a key role for fluctuations in speeding up the kinetics of numerous phenomena ranging from Cassie-Wenzel transitions on superhydrophobic surfaces, to hydrophobically driven biomolecular folding and assembly.

AB  - Background and aims: A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the effects of a rock phosphate-solubilizing fungus (Mortierella sp.) and an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Claroideoglomus claroideum (N. C. Schenck & G. S. Sm.) C. Walker & A. Schüßler comb. nov.) on enhancing plant phosphate (P) uptake and growth of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) in three tropical soils that exhibited contrasting soil P sorption capacities.; Methods: For this purpose, the three soils (Mollisol, Oxisol and Andisol) were amended with Huila rock phosphate (RP) at a P rate of 300 mg kg−1 and inoculated with neither, one, or both fungi.; Results: The results indicate that a three-way interaction occurred for all variables studied and that the effectiveness of the PSM in increasing plant P uptake and growth was limited by the soil P sorption. For instance, PSM inoculation was ineffective in the Andisol (very high P sorption capacity) even when the mycorrhizal association was present, while in the Oxisol (medium P sorption) the PSM was only effective when the plant was concomitantly inoculated with the AMF (dual inoculation). In contrast, both individual PSM inoculation and individual AMF inoculation were effective in promoting plant P uptake and growth in the Mollisol (low soil P sorption); however, the effect was even higher in the presence of both (dual inoculation).; Conclusions: Although the PSM effect was limited by soil P sorption, this limitation likely was overcome by the mycorrhizal association, which permitted a more efficient capture of the P released from RP dissolution. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Performance of animals in smallholder farming systems is hindered by feed availability and feed costs that make up 60-70% of total variable cost in a farming system. The use of non-conventional feedstuffs is an alternative which can be adopted to minimize feeding costs. The study was conducted to evaluate performance of animals fed with supplements formulated on-farm in comparison with a commercial prepared supplement. Thirty Mashona cows were grouped according to age and subjected to five treatments, given twice a week from the 1st of September until 31st December for three subsequent years. The five treatment diets, beef survival meal (BSM), urea treated maize stover (UTS), Leucaena leucocephala meal (LLM), mixed forage meal (MFM) and natural pastures (NP) were randomly assigned to cows in a complete randomised design (CRD). Average weight gains were determined. Performance in the first year was not significantly different across treatments. In the subsequent years, performance remained low in the NP. Average weight gains increased in the second and third years and was significantly different across treatments (P<0.05). Performance of animals supplemented with non-conventional feed was comparable to those offered commercial BFM; hence LLM and UTS can be used as alternative protein supplements especially in resource-constrained farming systems.

AB  - In order to reduce the impacts occasioned by cattle farming systems on the environment, strategies focused on the inclusion of legume species within these systems have been promoted because of their potential for improving soils conditions. The symbiotic association between bacteria from genus Rhizobium eases the nitrogen undertaking by legume plants and therefore their growth and productivity may be improved. Even though bacteria from this genus naturally occur, they also may be inoculated to plant seeds. Silvopastoral systems (SPS) are an alternative for cattle farming where trees are incorporated to spatial arranges. In this sense, woody legumes have been used as a possibility of being integrated to SPS. In order to evaluate changes associated with the availability of nitrogen and other nutriments within soils as well as the presence of rhizome nodules, in this work, the woody species Leucaena leucocephala was established within silvopastoral systems with high density (over 10,000 trees per ha) in aa cattle farm , located in Balboa, Colombia. For assessing changes in soils after the establishment an experiment with a randomize complete block design and two treatments (inoculation and not inoculated) was used. Measurements were carried out during 7 months after the establishing the experiment, being the response variables the total and ammonia nitrogen as well as the amount of active nodules of Rhizobium on roots. Under the ecological conditions occurred during the experiment the presence of nodules did not show significant differences between treatments (P>0.05), however a total amount of 249, 31 kg/ha of nitrogen was provided to soils while the experimental period.

AB  - Fast growth and high N2 -fixation make multipurpose trees attractive in agroforestry. We assessed the effects of N and P fertilizer application on nodulation and growth of Millita thonningii native to West Africa and compared its attributes with five known multipurpose leguminous trees Acacia auriculiformis, A. mangium, Albizia lebbeck, Albizia zygia, Leucaena leucocephala, and two shrubby legumes, Cajanus cajan and Crotalaria ochroleuca in Hatso and Toje soils. They all were nodulated without inoculation, with nodulation being higher in Toje soil. Up to 90 kg P ha -1 enhanced nodulation and growth, but further increase to 120 kg P ha -1 caused from 53% to 600% reduction in nodules on M. thonningii and A. zygia, respectively and significant reduction in tree growth. Nitrogen fertilization decreased nodulation in the tree legumes more in the two shrubs and also more when the N fertilizer was combined with 90 kg P ha -1. M. thonningii had highest yield in both un-amended and amended soils, almost 3 and 7 times more than the lowest, A. zygia, in the un-amended Toje and Hatso soils, respectively. M. thonningii used less P for growth, on average 22 and 18 mg P g -1 dry matter in the Toje and Hatso soils, compared to 50 and 39 mg P g -1 for the six trees. Thus M. thonningii with its high yield, nodulation and P use efficiency has great potential in agroforestry. © 2015 Kerala Agricultural University. All rights reserved.

TI  - Systemic effects of Leucaena leucocephala ingestion on ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929074956&doi=10.1002%2fajp.22386&partnerID=40&md5=dc06dce00eeadf9458b3e546cc69a14a
AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) is a leguminous tree that is nutritious forage for domestic livestock when ingested in limited amounts. Unfortunately, leucaena contains mimosine, a plant amino acid, that can be toxic when ingested at higher concentrations. Reported toxic effects include alopecia (fur loss), poor body condition, infertility, low birth weight, thyroid gland dysfunction, and organ toxicity. Originally native to Mexico and Central America, leucaena has been introduced throughout the tropics, including Berenty Reserve, Madagascar where it was planted as supplemental browse for livestock. In Berenty, a seasonal syndrome of alopecia in ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta) is associated with eating leucaena. Although much is known about the toxic effects of leucaena and mimosine on domestic animals and humans, the systemic effects on wildlife had not been studied. In a comparison of lemurs that include leucaena in their diet and those that do not, we found that animals that ingest leucaena absorb mimosine but that ingestion does not affect body condition, cause kidney or liver toxicity, or affect the intestinal tract. Alopecia is due to mimosine's interference of the hair follicle cycle. Leucaena ingestion is associated with higher serum albumin, α-tocopherol, and thyroxine concentrations, suggesting that leucaena may provide some nutritional benefit and that lemurs can detoxify and convert mimosine to a thyroid stimulating metabolite. The primary conservation consequence of leucaena ingestion at Berenty may be increased infant mortality due to the infants' inability cling to their alopecic mothers. The widespread introduction of leucaena throughout the tropics and its rapid spread in secondary forest conditions mean that many other leaf-eating mammals may be including this tree in their diet. Thus, exposure to leucaena should be considered when wildlife health is being evaluated, and the potential effects on wildlife health should be considered when contemplating leucaena introduction into or near wildlife habitat. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Left–right asymmetry and morphological consequences of a host shift in the oligophagous Neotropical moth Macaria mirthae (Lepidoptera: Geometridae)
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930927843&doi=10.1007%2fs10841-015-9779-0&partnerID=40&md5=a711b3ee3825667741bebc08aa232757
AB  - Phytophagous insects are excellent model organisms to study the genetic and ecological components of adaptation and morphological divergence, because their host plants are one of the main environmental factors influencing their early life stages. Although many lepidopterans are highly specialized in their host use, shifts to exotic plants have been reported for some species. Macaria mirthae is a native moth from Northern Chile that feeds preferentially on the Fabacea species Acacia macracantha, however due to habitat loss a host shift has recently been observed to the introduced fabacean Leucaena leucocephala. We studied the impact that different host plants have on the developmental instability levels in the moth’s wing morphology evaluating both fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and directional asymmetry (DA). FA measures the small random deviations existing between the left and right sides of bilaterally symmetrical traits and it widely used as a biomonitor of environmental quality. DA refers to the tendency for a trait to be consistently developed in a different manner on the right and left sides of the body. It has been recently shown that subtle DA patterns seem to be a ubiquitous phenomenon among bilaterian animals. Our results confirmed the presence of FA in M. mirthae forewings by applying geometric morphometric techniques. Furthermore, it was found that the individuals feeding on the endemic tree (A. macracantha) showed marked DA levels, while the specimens inhabiting the exotic plant (L. leucocephala) did not. The absence of DA in the individuals occupying the exotic plant is striking, because it has been established that this asymmetry pattern is widespread among insect wings. This phenomenon could be related to the influence of L. leucocephala on normal wing development. Despite the reduced quality of L. leucocephala as host plant, its wider presence in the Azapa valley (Chile) could explain the host shift made by M. mirthae. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The determination of the dry matter intake (DMI) of animals is essential to determine the productive ability and nutritional status of domestic animals. Many techniques exist for estimating DMI and that of n-alkanes has shown special appeal, since it also allows the determination of the selectivity of the fodder consumed. The present study aimed to estimate voluntary feed intake and fecal nutrient excretion in Zebu steers fed in an intensive silvopastoral system (ISS). The study was conducted at the Cotové Research Center of the National University of Colombia in Santa Fe, Antioquia. Six steers with an average weight of 381.16±12.1 kg were evaluated and the n-alkane technique was used to determine DMI. The average forage DMI intake was 9.54 kg day-1 of which, 75.24% corresponded to intake of grasses and 24.76% to legume intake. Nutrient intake (kg) was 1.33, 5.8, 4.02, 1.13, 0.058 and 0.021 for CP, NDF, ADF, ashes, Ca and P, respectively. These intakes were adequate for the type of animals evaluated and provided a diet of good nutritional quality. The digestibility was 53% for the diet without supplementation and 58% for the diet with supplementation, which together with the DMI data, suggests that animals met their requirements of key nutrients. In turn, nutrient excretion (kg) was 4.15, 0.44, 2.56, 1.78, 0.8, 0.054 y 0.02 for DN, CP, NDF, ADF, ashes, Ca and P, respectively. Faecal N excretion was calculated at 29,9 kg per animal per year, and this contributes to the biomass production of the ISS grasses. © 2015, Universidad de Cordoba. All rights reserved.

AB  - Feasibility of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for developing multi-species model for plantation timber was explored for estimation of holocellulose in un-extracted milled wood samples. Six commonly planted species of Eucalyptus tereticornis, E. camaldulensis, E. grandis, Leucaena leucocephala, Dalbergia sissoo and Populus deltoides from a wide range of locations and varying age groups were taken for the present study. Few samples of E. hybrid between E. tereticornis and E. camaldulensis were also included in the study to make the model useful for practical application. NIR models were evaluated using partial least squares regression (PLSR-1—full cross-validation, PLSR-2—cross-validation which leaves more than one out) and by dividing the samples into calibration and prediction (test) sets and interchanging them from calibration to prediction sets. The predictive ability of the model was assessed by calculating four ratios of multivariate statistics for individual species model and combined species models. A final combined model for all the species having component range of 76.14–63.03 % and standard deviation of 2.586 % was developed in the spectral range of 7502–4246 cm−1 wave number using 1st derivative plus multiplicative scatter correction using factor of nine by removing samples with outliers found in all the PLSR-2 evaluation steps and in most of the models. The model remained stable even when 30 % of the samples were left out with no outlier detected. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Ground-dwelling ants as bioindicators during 30-year vegetation restoration in a savanna area, Yunnan
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942303591&doi=10.5846%2fstxb201401200155&partnerID=40&md5=1f462dfa48e57b52bd2e9c3680bd2fcd
AB  - Savanna is a type of vegetation influenced by dry and hot climate. Savanna vegetation in Yunnan is distributed in arid and semi-arid valleys of the Hengduan Mountains area, which has an extraordinarily fragile eco-environment. Many artificial forests were planted in these areas in order to restore the vegetation. However, there are few studies on biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration. Ant communities are considered useful indicators of the changing environment and have been used successfully in the evaluation of ecological environments around the world. In order to reveal the bioindicator role of ground-dwelling ants in the savanna of Yunnan, exploring the importance of artificial forests in biodiversity conservation. We investigated the ground-dwelling ants by pitfall traps in plantations and natural vegetation within savanna area, Yunnan, China in 2005 and 2011. The main results were as follows: (1) Ant community composition: 40467 individual ants were collected, representing 5 sub-families, 19 genera, and 47 species. Iridomyrmes anceps was the most common species in well-protected natural vegetation, while Monomorium mayri was the most common one in disturbed natural vegetation and most plantations.(2) Ant abundance and a-diversity: there were no significant differences between the shrub grassland and secondary forest of natural vegetation. Among all vegetation, Azadirachta indica had the greatest abundance of ants and a-diversity, which was close to that of natural vegetation, followed by Eucalyptus spp., and Leucaena leucocephala ranked the lowest. Among all afforestation models, the Azadirachta indica-Acacia mangium plantation had the most a-diversity. Ant abundance was greatest in the Azadirachta indica plantation, and the Eucalyptus spp. plantation was the lowest on both indexes. (3) Community similarity and β-diversity: Only the ant community composition in the Azadirachta indica plantation was similar to that in widely distributed scrub grassland. However, β-diversity in the Leucaena leucocephala plantation was the highest; its βCs value ranged from 0.481 to 0.935; the Azadirachta indica plantation had the lowest diversity, with βCs values ranging from 0.200 to 0.478. (4) Relationship analysis: Both ant species richness and its the ACE value had a significant positive relationship with herb species richness and its ACE value. In total, the most abundant ant species in the ant community in the Yunnan savanna were from Myrmicinae and Camponotus compared with other families and genera, which was similar to that of other savannas in the world. Azadirachta indica and Eucalyptus spp. plantations had a high level of a-diversity that was close to that of the natural forest, which has a positive role in local biodiversity protection. Even with a relative lower a-diversity, the Leucaena leucocephala plantation was a good inhibiting desertification model in an area of extreme degradation with higher β-diversity. All of the artificial forests played an important role in restoring ecological environment in savanna areas. We conclude that the a-diversity in ant communities could be a good indicator of biodiversity, which can reflect the biodiversity situation during vegetation restoration in savanna areas. In order to improve the ecological consequences of artificial forests, more research is needed on the effects of restoration models with mixed tree species and plantation modification. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

AB  - The structural changes in the cell wall and delignification pattern caused by Trametes versicolor and Trametes hirsuta in the sap wood of Leucaena leucocephala were examined by light and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The in vitro decay test was conducted for 12 weeks. Both species of Trametes used in this study caused anatomical characteristics specific to simultaneous white rot. Formation of boreholes, erosion troughs, erosion channels with U-shaped notches in tangential sections and thinning of cell walls were evident in the wood inoculated with each of the fungal species. Cell separation due to removal of middle lamellae occurred at the early stages of infection (30 d) with T. versicolor. In contrast, middle lamellae remained intact in wood inoculated with T. hirsuta and showed cell separation due to degradation of the outer layer of the secondary wall and degradation of the middle lamellae observed only in severely decayed wood at late stages. Confocal microscopy revealed the delignification pattern particularly from cell corners and vessel walls at an advanced stage of decay, indicating strong ligninolytic activity of both species in the sapwood of L. leucocephala. © 2015 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

TI  - Estimating apparent nutrient digestibility of diets containing Leucaena leucocephala or Moringa oleifera leaf meals for growing rabbits by two methods

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the nutrient digestibility of growing rabbits fed diets with different levels of either Leucaena leucocephala (LLM) or Moringa oleifera (MOLM) leaf meals and also to compare total collection and TiO2 marker methods for estimating digestibility. A total of 30 California growing rabbits (1.81±0.19 kg live weight on average) were randomly distributed into five experimental groups of six rabbits each and were housed in individual cages. The groups were control, 30% LLM, 40% LLM, 30% MOLM, and 40% MOLM. All groups received pelleted diets for two weeks; diets also contained 4 g/kg titanium dioxide as dietary marker. Daily feed intake was recorded during the whole experimental period and total feces were collected daily and weighed individually during four days. The results showed that there were no difference (p>0.05) in feed, dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), digestible energy, and crude fiber (CF) intake between the control group and the other experimental groups. The apparent digestibility values of DM, OM, CP, CF, acid detergent fiber, and gross energy were the highest for control group (p = 0.001), meanwhile MOLM diets had generally higher nutrient digestibility coefficients than LLM diets. Increasing the inclusion level of leaf meal in the diet from 30% to 40% improved the digestibility of CF from 45.02% to 51.69% for LLM and from 48.11% to 55.89% for MOLM. Similar results for apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients were obtained when either total collection or indigestible marker method was used. In conclusion, the digestibility of MOLM containing diets were better than LLM diets, furthermore TiO2 as an external marker could be used as a simple, practical and reliable method to estimate nutrients digestibility in rabbit diets.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to study the effects of lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf supplementation in fermented kumpai grass (Hymenachne amplexiacalis) based rations on the productivity of Bali cattle. Variables measured were dry matter and organic matter intakes, nutrient digestibility (dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, and crude fiber), body weight gain, and feed efficiency. The types of rations were: Ration A= 45% fermented kumpai grass + 40% benggala grass + 15% concentrate + 0% lamtoro leaf, Ration B= 45% fermented kumpai grass + 30% benggala grass + 15% concentrate + 10% lamtoro leaf, Ration C= 45% fermented kumpai grass + 20% benggala grass + 15% concentrate + 20% lamtoro leaf, and Ration D= 45% fermented kumpai grass + 10% benggala grass + 15% concentrate + 30% lamtoro leaf. The supplementation of lamtoro leaf up to 30% into the ration could increase (P<0.05) dry matter and organic matter intakes, and crude protein digestibility. The highest body weight gain and feed efficiency were found in Bali cattle fed ration with 20% lamtoro leaf supplementation. The level of lamtoro leaf supplementation in the ration did not affect the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and crude fiber. It was concluded that the supplementation of lamtoro leaf in the ration could increase dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein intakes. Addition of 20% lamtoro leaf gave the best effect on the increased body weight gain and feed efficiency in Bali cattle.

AB  - This paper mainly reports the wetting state of liquid droplets on a Ti6Al4V micro-nanoscale hierarchical structured hydrophobic surface. In this work, the detailed action mechanism of the secondary nanostructure in the hierarchical structure on the wetting-state transition (from the Wenzel state to the Cassie state) was revealed and discussed. The variation of micro-morphology of the sample surface was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Furthermore, the apparent contact angle and sliding angle of the droplets on the surfaces were measured via a contact angle measurement instrument. The theoretical and experimental results indicated that the one-dimensional nanowire structure, which was planted on the microstructure surface by the hydrothermal method, effectively changed the wetting state of liquid droplets on the surface from the Wenzel state to the Cassie state owing to its good size synergies with microscale structure. This process not only increased the apparent contact angle of liquid droplets on the solid surface (to 161°), but also decreased the sliding angle significantly (to 3°) and contact angle hysteresis (to ∼2°), demonstrating the robust non-wetting property. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.

AB  - Background: Nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation are mediated by several genes, both of the host legume and of the bacterium. The rhizobial regulatory nodD gene plays a critical role, orchestrating the transcription of the other nodulation genes. Rhizobium tropici strain CIAT 899 is an effective symbiont of several legumes-with an emphasis on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)-and is unusual in carrying multiple copies of nodD, the roles of which remain to be elucidated. Results: Phenotypes, Nod factors and gene expression of nodD1 and nodD2 mutants of CIAT 899 were compared with those of the wild type strain, both in the presence and in the absence of the nod-gene-inducing molecules apigenin and salt (NaCl). Differences between the wild type and mutants were observed in swimming motility and IAA (indole acetic acid) synthesis. In the presence of both apigenin and salt, large numbers of Nod factors were detected in CIAT 899, with fewer detected in the mutants. nodC expression was lower in both mutants; differences in nodD1 and nodD2 expression were observed between the wild type and the mutants, with variation according to the inducing molecule, and with a major role of apigenin with nodD1 and of salt with nodD2. In the nodD1 mutant, nodulation was markedly reduced in common bean and abolished in leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum), whereas a mutation in nodD2 reduced nodulation in common bean, but not in the other two legumes. Conclusion: Our proposed model considers that full nodulation of common bean by R. tropici requires both nodD1 and nodD2, whereas, in other legume species that might represent the original host, nodD1 plays the major role. In general, nodD2 is an activator of nod-gene transcription, but, in specific conditions, it can slightly repress nodD1. nodD1 and nodD2 play other roles beyond nodulation, such as swimming motility and IAA synthesis. © del Cerro et al.

AB  - Biological invasions are one of the great threats of our time, and the accumulation of knowledge of invasive species is essential for invasive species management. In this study, aspects of the population ecology of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit were investigated in a seasonal semi-deciduous forest remnant (23°1528S, 51°0152W - centre of the remnant) in Southern Brazil to evaluate whether the species is invading the remnant. In the first season, 1974 individuals, distributed heterogeneously in the remnant, were sampled. The population height structure fitted a negative exponential growth curve function (r2≤0.9), indicating that the population was persisting through recruitment. The population also had a grouped spatial pattern and high recruitment rate. The species invaded the disturbed areas of the remnant. Gradual eradication is recommended for L. leucocephala for the remnant. © CSIRO 2015.

AB  - Reconstruction of plant communities on superhighway side slopes using native shrubs is an important ecological practice that is employed for stabilization of the slopes. To advance the ecological restoration process of slope vegetation, we evaluated the impacts of the life form composition of indigenous plant species on soil and water conservation properties on the slopes using three representative ecosystems, Miscanthus sinensis + Buchloe dactyloides, Neosinocalamus affinis + Indigofera pseudotinctoria, and Cupressus funebris + Leucaena leucocephala, in southwest China. Four ecological models represented by tree-, shrub-, and herb-dominated experimental plots (AAXi, SSXi, and HHXi, respectively), which were composed of one of the three ecosystems and one of the indigenous dominant species (Buchloe dactyloides, Lolium perenne, Vitex negundo, Amorpha fruticosa, Ailanthus altissima, and Robinia pseudoacacia), and by herb-shrub-tree-dominated experimental plots (HSA), which were composed of three dominant species, were reconstructed via a three-species assembly experiment in April, 2009. The generation of surface runoff and soil erosion were investigated in the plots and the correlation between the life forms of indigenous species, species diversity, and levels of soil and water conservation in the ecosystems were analyzed from 2010 to 2014. The results showed that the fluctuation in plant species richness between communities of the same age decreased in the order of AAXi > SSXi > HAS > HHXi from 2010 to 2014. Shannon-Wiener index and Pielou’s index indicated that life forms of the indigenous species growing on the slopes affected plant species diversity, which fluctuated with community phases. From 2010 to 2011, these indices varied in the following order HHXi> HSA > SSXi > AAXi, and from 2012 to 2014, they varied in the order of HSA > HHXi > SSXi > AAXi. Of the four ecological models tested, the runoff coefficient and erosion in the period from 2010 to 2011 was the lowest in HHXi plots, followed by HSA plots, whereas from 2012 to 2014, the HSA plots manifested a more prominent soil and water conservation compared to other ecological models, while these properties continued being the lowest in HHXi plots. The plant species diversity of the slope vegetation was closely related to its capacity for soil and water conservation as indicated by the determination coefficient of more than 0.951; the higher species diversity in a given community, the smaller the runoff coefficient and erosion modulus. The results from this study suggested that the life form of indigenous species plays an important role in increasing plant species diversity and improving soil and water conservation properties of side slopes. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - Effects of vegetation restoration on the amelioration of degraded soil in a dry-hot valley
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939517145&doi=10.5846%2fstxb201312122939&partnerID=40&md5=12ea8cf14337fb722613f3dd4dd65ff4
AB  - Land degradation and soil deterioration are key environmental problems in dry-hot valleys of southwestern China, where vegetation deterioration and soil erosion have reached critical levels in these fragile ecological zones. Restoration programs in these valleys depend on scientific information about which tree species are best for rehabilitation programs, as well as the responses of edaphic constraints to these tree species. To date, knowledge about the amelioration effects of different plantation types on degraded soils in dry-hot valleys is scarce. In this study, we evaluate five monospecific tree plantations (Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia kalkora, Acacia auriculiformis, Azadirachta indica, and Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and one self-repair treatment established to restore a degraded dry-hot valley. We conducted this study to improve our understanding of the effects of vegetation restoration on the soil amelioration process and to provide a theoretical basis for the selection of tree species and restoration practices for rehabilitation programs in dry-hot valleys. Soil characteristics associated with each of the six regeneration treatments were investigated four times over the last 22 years of vegetation restoration. Results show that both regeneration treatment type and elapsed time have significant effects on the soil characteristics of the degraded soils during restoration. Although most properties of the soils associated with the six regeneration treatments improved substantially over the last 22 years, soil fertility and particularly the soil structure were still less well developed than those of undisturbed soils at equivalent sites. After 22 years of vegetation restoration, soil microbial and chemical properties of the degraded soils had ameliorated to >90% and >60%, respectively, compared with those of undisturbed soils; whereas soil physical properties ameliorated < 30% in all six treatments. During the entire restoration period, soil physical properties were only enhanced by 3.0%—20.0%, which is significantly less than that observed for soil microbial and chemical properties. The percent of soil amelioration success via self-repair mechanisms was 63.6%, which was higher than the amelioration success for plantings of Albizia kalkora (54.3%), Azadirachta indica (54.9%), and E. camaldulensis (53.2%) but was less than that recorded for plantings of L. leucocephala (68.2%) and Acacia auriculiformis (67.3%). Thus, the different tree species clearly affected soil amelioration processes to different extents. During the process of soil amelioration, soil microbial properties were regenerated first, followed by improvements in chemical properties, while physical properties improved only slightly over the 22-year study period. This study also shows that manual restoration of vegetation (i.e., afforestation) did not always accelerate soil amelioration relative to natural restoration (i.e., self-repair) in dry-hot valleys. We conclude that L. leucocephala and Acacia auriculiformis are the most suitable species as pioneer trees for soil amelioration of degraded soils in these regions. Cost-free self-repair of degraded soils is also a practical option for soil amelioration in regions where afforestation is difficult to carry out. The results of this study need to be further evaluated using a wider range of vegetation types and other degraded valley-type savannas with different soil characteristics to test the general applicability of our conclusions. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

AB  - Objective. Quantify the effects of mixing Leucaena (L) with King grass forage, fresh (K) or wilted (Kp), on the fermentation process and chemical composition of mixed silages. Materials and methods. Silos were produced mixing several proportions (kg:kg) K:L and Kp:L (100:0; 75:25; 60:40; 50:50; 40:60 and 0:100) of both types of plants, under a completely randomized design of four replications. The quantity of organic acids (butyric, acetic, lactic), pH, ammonia nitrogen percent and some of the typical bromatologic nutrients of the forage before and after ensiling were measured. The treatment effects were evaluated through variance and regression analysis. Results. The results clearly proved the differences (p<0.05) between King grass and Leucaena which promote its mixing and wilting: better legume contents of crude protein (24 vs. 7%), dry matter (33.77 vs. 22.05%) and crude fiber (26.53 vs. 32.5%). Clear benefits on the conservation process of mixed silages were also measured: higher lactic productions and less butyric, acceptable pH (4.02-4.8) and protein degradation (<8%). In addition, a positive effect on the chemical composition of the aforementioned silages was quantified (crude protein, dry matter and crude fiber progressive improvement). Conclusions. Mixed K+L silages are better than pure K if L is included below 25% in KL and up to 40% when K has been wilted. Higher inclusions of L will worsen the conservation process and will limit its elaboration.

AB  - Wood is a highly organized material from macroscopic to micro level. Wood is a natural complex biomaterial. Analytical methods are described for the determination of major, minor, and trace elements in wood. The present study deals with micro chemical elements characterization of wood samples (Leucaena leucocephala, Syzium Cumini, Mangifera indica L, Prosopis juliflora and Eucalyptus melliodora) by energy dispersive X-ray analysis using OXFORDLINK-ISIS EDX fitted to Hitachi S-520 scanning electron microscope. Variations in major and minor chemical elements are observed from one species to other. It is interesting to note that very low amount of trace elements have been observed in different wood species shows to be essential to the growth of tree.

AB  - Cellulosic fibers from cotton fibers (CF), recycled writing papers (RWP), recycled newspapers (RN), and macerated woody fibers of Leucaena leucocephala (MWFL) were acetylated by heterogeneous reactions with glacial acetic acid, concentrated H2SO4, and acetic anhydride. The resultant cellulose triacetate (CTA) was characterized for yield and solubility as well as by using 1H-NMR spectroscopy and SEM. The acetylated product (AP) yields for CF, RWP, RN, and MWFL were 112, 94, 84, and 73%, respectively. After isolation of pure CTA from the AP, the CTA yields were 87, 80, 68, and 54%. The solubility test for the CTA's showed a clear solubility in chloroform, as well as mixture of chloroform and methanol (9:1v/v) and vice versa for acetone. The degree of substitution (DS) values for the CTA's produced were nearly identical and confirmed the presence of CTA. In addition, the pore diameter of the CTA skeleton ranged from 0.072 to 0.239 μm for RWP and RN, and within the dimension scale of the CTA pinholes confirm the synthesis of CTA. Accordingly, pouring of the AP liquor at 25 °C in distilled water at the end of the acetylation and filtration did not hydrolyze the CTA to cellulose diacetate.

AB  - Dietary combinations of Sehima-nervosum-SN grass with tree leaves and shrubs 5 each in 50:50 and 75:25 proportions were evaluated for in vitro fermentation, nutrients degradation, metabolites production, gas production and partition factor in sheep and goat inoculums. SN at 50: 50 ratio with tree leaves and shrubs had higher (P<0.05) CP and lower NDF, ADF and cellulose than at 75:25 ratio. Mean nutrients degradability of diets differ (P<0.05) in both sheep and goat inoculums, while mean CP digestibility of diets was higher at 50:50 ratio of SN-tree foliage in both species. SN-SV (Securengia virosa) diets had highest nutrients digestibility against the lowest from SN-HB (Hardwickia binata) and SN-DC (Dichrostachys cineria) diets in both species inoculums. SN-DC diet had higher nutrients digestibility in goat inoculum while nutrients digestibility from other diets was at par with sheep inoculums. Mean concentration of TVFA (meq/l), total-N and NH3-N (mg/100ml) from SN-SV and SN-LL (Leucaena leucocephala) diets was more both in sheep (79.50, 50.40 and12.60; and 73.50, 43.40 and 10.50) and goat inoculums (73.50, 57.40 and 13.65; and 77.50, 44.80 and 10.15), while SN-AC (Acacia catechu), SN-DC and SN-HB diets had lower production of these metabolites in rumen liquor of both species. Diets with SN: leaves of trees/shrubs in 50:50 ratio had higher total-N contents in goat inoculum. Mean gas production (ml/g/ 24 h), IVDMD and partition factor (PF) varied (P<0.05) amongst the SN-tree foliage based diets. Sheep had higher gas production at 75:25 ratio (143.11) than 50:50 ratio of grass-tree foliage diets (130.24 ml/g). Mean gas was higher at 75:25 ratio of grass-tree foliage diets in both species. Results revealed that dietary combinations of SN grass with SV, LL and GO had higher nutrients digestibility and more metabolites (TVFA, total-N and ammonia-N) production on fermentation in rumen inoculums of both sheep and goats. © 2015, Range Management Society of India.

AB  - The methanogenic potential and nutritional quality of nineteen plants adapted to the dry and rainy seasons of the Arauca floodable savannas was evaluated. Each plant was incubated anaerobically with rumen fluid at 39 °C for 24h, after incubation period, gas production, methane, volatile fatty acids and dry matter degradation was determined. Among the plants, crude protein values ranged between 6.87-28.22%; neutral detergent fiber was between 35.2-71.26%, while the ether extract, ash and nonstructural carbohydrate levels ranged between 1.35-6.65, 2.43-5.27 and 11.47-35.64%, respectively. Gas production and methane were significant correlated (r = 0.84). The species Galactia jussiaeana, Belencita nemorosa, Ambrosia peruviana and Enterolobium schomburgkii showed high values of dry matter degradation (45.40-49.13%), VFA (0.84-1.37 mmol) and low methane production (2.18-6.90 ml/g DM degraded). These parameters were similar or better to those found in the species Leucaena leucocephala. The results suggest that these plants present useful compounds to reduce ruminal methanogenesis without affecting the diet digestibility, however further studies are required to assess the persistence of antimethanogenic effect, dosage, consumption and animal performance.

AB  - Pyroligneous acids, i.e. by-products from the manufacture of charcoal by carbonisation of Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Azadirachta indica, Hevea brasiliensis (rubberwood) and Dendrocalamus asper (bamboo) along with two commercial products were studied. Characterisations of their compositions were performed qualitatively by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and quantitatively by gas chromatography with flame ionisation detector. Twenty-three components were identified, of which acetic acid was the major component, followed by 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol and 2-methylphenol. Antifungal activity and efficacy of pyroligneous acids as wood preservatives were conducted using Petri dish bioassay and soil block test respectively against two white rot fungi (Trametes versicolor and Rigidoporopsis amylospora), a brown rot fungus (Gloeophyllum trabeum) and a sapstain fungus (Botryodiplodia theobromae). All pyroligneous acids exhibited antifungal activity (growth inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration) especially those from bamboo and rubberwood, which had higher total phenolic concentrations. Soil block experiments for 12 weeks showed that pyroligneous acids from bamboo and rubberwood were more effective as wood preservatives. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - Plant community structure, soil nutrients and soil enzyme activity have a coupling relationship in relation to the vegetation types. This research aimed to find the relationship between structure of plant community and soil nutrients and enzymes in an area with frequent debris flow. We took as the main research object of 5 typical vegetation types in the Jiangjia Gulley including Heteropogon contortus, Salix myrtillacea and Leucaena leucocephala of 9 years, 15 years and 26 years. We analyzed the characteristics and correlation of plant diversity with soil nutrients and soil enzyme activity by methods of field investigation and laboratory analysis. The results showed a sequence of plant diversity as Salix myrtillacea > Heteropogon contortus > 26-year Leucaena leucocephala > 15-year Leucaena leucocephala > 9-year Leucaena leucocephala. The contents of the soil organic matter, the C:N and C:P were all higher in Heteropogon contortus and Salix myrtillacea than in Leucaena leucocephala of all three ages (P < 0.05). The Simpson and Shannon-Wiener plant diversity indices showed a significant positive correlation with soil organic matter and Invertase (P < 0.05). Finally, the organic matter showed an extremely significant positive correlation with Invertase (P < 0.01). The results indicated that higher plant diversity index in different vegetation communities can help the accumulation of soil fertility and can improve soil biological activity in areas with frequent debris flow.

AB  - Contact-angle hysteresis of a liquid suspended on surface microstructures, namely in a Cassie-Baxter state, is determined mainly by the receding contact line although not fully understood. Existing modified Cassie-Baxter models predict some but not most experimental data in the literature. Noting that most models were based on the two-dimensional (2-D) principle whereas the experiments were under three-dimensional (3-D) conditions, here we develop a 2-D experiment. While 3-D experiments measure the receding contact lines averaged over space and time, 2-D experiments eliminate the spatial averaging and can further eliminate the temporal averaging by high-speed visualization. The resulting details of the contact line motion lead us to propose a 2-D model, which incorporates the contact-line friction. The new 2-D model matches the 2-D experimental results excellently while all existing models show significant deviation. By introducing a line solid fraction term, the 2-D model is further generalized to a 3-D model, which successfully predicts a wide range of 3-D data in the literature regardless of their distinct microstructures and receding modes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.

AB  - We compared the C storage of two nitrogen-fixing trees in mixed and monospecific plantations to investigate the C sequestration potential after 10 years of their establishment. The study was carried out in three types of plantation, Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. ex DC. pure (P1DS), Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit pure (P2LL) and mixed plantation of D. sissoo and L. leucocephala (P3DS.LL). The results of the study indicated that, P3DS.LL sequestered 34.30 ± 0.24 t yr-1 ha-1 CO2 compared to 27.35 ± 0.19 t yr-1 ha-1 in P1DS and 19.81 ± 0.44 t yr-1 ha-1 in P2LL. Total carbon storage was also maximum in P3DS.LL (93.47 ± 0.67 t ha-1) followed by P1DS (74.54 ± 0.53 t ha-1) and P2LL (53.98 ± 1.21 t ha-1). This indicates that L. leucocephala has synergetic effect with D. sissoo to enhance the carbon sequestration potential when interplanted together. The study revealed that mixed plantation of N–fixer trees have potential to sequester more carbon than same species in monoculture. The study concluded that in reforestation or afforestation program the synergic effect of N-fixer trees can be helpful projects to offset more C emissions. © 2015 Estonian University of Life Sciences.

AB  - The nutritive values of eleven tree leaves viz. Citrus limon, Ficus bengalensis, Ficus relegiosa, Ricinus communis, Ziziphus mauritiana, Azadirachta indica, Musa acuminatea, Acacia nilotica, Leucaena leucocephala, Prosopis julifora and Albizia samanm were evaluated by chemical analysis and in vitro gas production test. There were significant (P<0.05) differences among tree species in terms of chemical composition. Crude protein contents ranged from 7.98 to 19.96%. The ether extract content varied from 1.45 to 6.04% and crude fibre content from 13.77 to 26.86%. Neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre contents were in the range of 27.78 to 51.84 and 21.79 to 33.70%, respectively. In vitro evaluation revealed lower methane production (mL/g OM) in Ficus bengalensis, Acacia nilotica, Albizia samanm, Ficus relegiosa and Azadirachta indica compared to the control at 10 and 20% inclusion level of selected leaves. The in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVMOD) ranged from 53.98 to 64.92 and 61.14 to 67.81%, respectively at 10 and 20% inclusion. The total volatile fatty acids (mM) ranged from 35.01 to 45.52 and 32.46 to 44.47 at 10 and 20% inclusion, respectively. Results revealed that most of tree leaves studied in this experiment have potential nutritive values indicated by high crude protein content, IVOMD and low fiber values.

AB  - Sulfuric acid treated Petai belalang (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf powder (SLLP) was used as an adsorbent for Pb(II) ions removal. The experimental adsorption parameters investigated include pH, dosage and initial Pb(II) concentration. Pb(II) removal was more favored at a higher adsorbent dosage, pH and temperature. Adsorption kinetics conformed to the pseudo-second order model while Langmuir isotherm model recorded the value of maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of 222 mg/g. The major functional groups involved in the adsorption process were identified as hydroxyl, amino and ether as revealed by the FTIR analysis. The prepared adsorbent demonstrated a potential application for efficient removal of Pb(II) ions from industrial wastewater. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2015.

AB  - A quantitative and qualitative survey of airborne pollen was performed in the city of Karachi, and the pollen counts were correlated with different climatic conditions. The aim of the study was to determine the possible effect of meteorological factors on airborne pollen distribution in the atmosphere of Karachi city. Pollen sampling was carried out by using Burkard spore Trap for the period of August 2009 to July 2010, and a total of 2,922 pollen grains/m3 were recorded. In this survey, 22 pollen types were recognized. The highest pollen count was contributed by Poaceae pollen type (1,242 pollen grains/m3) followed by Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae (948 pollen grains/m3), Cyperus rotundus (195 pollen grains/m3) and Prosopis juliflora (169 pollen grains/m3). Peak pollen season was in August showing a total of 709 pollen grains/m3 and lowest pollen count was observed in January-2010. Pearson's chi-square test was performed for the possible correlation of pollen counts and climatic factors. The test revealed significant positive correlation of wind speed with pollen types of Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae; Brassica campestris; Asteraceae; and Thuja orientalis. While the correlation of "average temperature" showed significant positive value with Asteraceae and Tamarix indica pollen types. Negative correlation was observed between humidity/ precipitation and pollen types of Brassica campestris; Daucus carota; Ephedra sp.; and Tamarix indica. In the light of above updated data one could identify various aeroallergens present in the air of Karachi city. Copyright © Winter 2015.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of protein extracts obtained from the plant Leucaena leucocephala on the nematode parasite Haemonchus contortus. The seeds, shell and cotyledon of L. leucocephala were separated and their proteins extracted using a sodium phosphate buffer, and named as TE (total seed extract), SE (shell extract) and CE (cotyledon extract). Soluble protein content, protease, protease inhibitory and chitinase activity assays were performed. Exsheathment inhibition of H. contortus larvae were performed at concentrations of 0.6 mg mL–1, and egg hatch assays were conducted at protein concentrations of 0.8, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 mg mL–1. The effective concentration for 50% hatching inhibition (EC50) was estimated by probit. Different proportions of soluble proteins, protease and chitinase were found in TE and CE. Protease inhibitory activity was detected in all extracts. The EC50 of the CE and TE extracts were 0.48 and 0.33 mg mL–1, respectively. No ovicidal effects on H. contortus were detected in SE extracts, and none of the protein extracts demonstrated larvicidal effects on H. contortus. We therefore conclude that protein extracts of L. leucocephala had a detrimental effect on nematode eggs, which can be correlated with the high protease and chitinase activity of these extracts. © 2015, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology.

AB  - Knowledge of forage intake and grazing selectivity is vital to improve the use of feed resources by grazing animals. To estimate forage selectivity and intake by steers grazing in intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) under tropical dry forest (bs-T) conditions, intake was evaluated using the n-alkane technique in: 1) a Leucaena leucocephala (over 10000 shrubs/ha) and Megathyrsus maximus ISS system and, 2) a M. maximus monoculture system. Eight steers with an average weight of 248±23.1 kg live weight were evaluated. Animals grazing in the ISS system had greater dry matter intake (26.1 vs. 20.4 g kg-1 d-1 of BW, P = 0.044) and had greater intake (g d-1; P < 0.02) of crude protein (954 vs. 499), calcium (62.1 vs. 36.2) and fat (94.2 vs. 69.6) than those grazing in the M. maximus monoculture system, respectively. Compared to conventional pastures, DMI of animals grazing in ISS increases, contributing to greater animal productivity.

AB  - Aerated whey protein gels were formed using calcium chloride, magnesium chloride or iron (II) chloride induced gelation of pre-denatured protein dispersions. The structure of the obtained gel surface depends on the type and concentration of added salt. Higher cation concentration produced gels a with higher quadratic mean of the surface roughness and maximum roughness height. Aerated gels of optimal properties for retaining air bubbles were characterized by similar surface roughness. The surface topography is mainly responsible for changes in the wettability. The contact angle of the probe liquid sample depends on the liquid surface tension components. An approach based on the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) is suitable for determining the total value of the apparent surface free energy of such materials. An approach based on the components of apparent surface free energy (LWAB) only allows the calculation of the dispersion component and electron donor parameter of energy in the case of added magnesium and iron salt. Wettability, depending on the nature of the surface, can be described for the hydrophilic surface by the Wenzel model, and for the hydrophobic surface by the Cassie – Baxter model. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - This research studied the leaf nutrient content before and after senescing, nutrient resorption efficiency (RE) and C:N:P stoichiometry of 9, 15 and 26 years Leucaena leucocephala in hot and dry valley, using one way analysis of variance and Pearson correlation analysis. The results showed the leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content in an order of 15 a > 26 a > 9 a, and an increase of N and P content of litter along with the forest age. N and P resorption efficiency (42.76-55.90% and 26.35-40.60% respectively) decreased with the forest age, with the N resorption efficiency greater than P resorption efficiency. Leaf C:N and C:P were less than that of litter, but leaf N:P was greater than that of litter and both of them bigger than 20. Except the N:P of litter, N resorption efficiency was significantly and positively correlated to other stoichiometric ratio, while P resorption efficiency was significantly and positively correlated only to C:N and C:P of the litter. On the whole, the nutrient resorption efficiency of Leucaena leucocephala decreased along with forest age in the hot and dry valley, indicating that the ability of nutrient conservation decreases with the forest age. Besides, we also found that P is the main limiting factor of Leucaena leucocephala growing. © 2015, Science Press. All rights reserved.

PY  - 2015

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a perennial legume shrub of subtropical regions that has forage characteristics favourable for livestock production, often delivering ruminant liveweight gains that are superior to most other forage systems. Recent work suggests that leucaena mitigates ruminant enteric methane emissions, implying that the shrub may also reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the whole farm level. However, the high crude protein content of leucaena relative to endemic grasses can increase livestock urine nitrogen concentration and may increase soil nitrous oxide emissions, potentially offsetting benefits of enteric methane mitigation. Here we examine the effects of leucaena on emissions, production and profitability at the whole farm level by modelling a property in northern Australia, assuming enterprises that specialise in cattle breeding and finishing. To contrast leucaena with a baseline property with Rhodes grass, we modelled three equivalent leucaena scenarios by matching (1) annual average stocking rate, (2) total liveweight production or (3) net farm emissions with that of the baseline, assuming all animals had access to leucaena.To maintain average annual stocking rate or liveweight production, scenarios 1 and 2 carried 5% and 12% less cattle than the baseline because animals on leucaena grew faster and had greater liveweight. In contrast, the number of animals carried and liveweight production in scenario 3 increased by 15% and 31% relative to the baseline, respectively, due to enteric methane abatement and greater liveweight gains. Grazing of leucaena increased soil nitrous oxide emissions by more than 38% in all scenarios, but this did not substantially offset net emissions abatement because nitrous oxide constituted a far smaller proportion of emissions than did methane (<10% and >90%, respectively). In all scenarios, emissions intensity (net farm emissions per unit liveweight sold) caused by grazing leucaena was reduced by more than 23% relative to baseline emissions intensities.This work shows that whilst income from carbon offsets associated with grazing leucaena is small, leucaena has significant potential to increase both animal production and gross margin, whilst reducing emissions intensity. Provided net farm emissions are maintained or reduced, these results suggest that leucaena is conducive to sustainable intensification of beef production in subtropical grazing systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aiming to understand the effect of vegetation type on soil quality in the area of fragile ecological environment, this research studied the soil quality of different vegetation types at Jiangjia Gully, Yunnan, China in the provenance slope of the area of high-frequency debris flow. The physical and chemical properties and enzyme activities of the soil of Arachis hypogage (AH), Punica granatum (PG), Heteropogon contortus (HC), Dodonaea viscose (DV) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL) were analyzed and investigated their soil quality by the integrated soil quality index. The results showed that: (1) The soil permeability and structure stability were better in HC and DV than in LL, AH and PG; the water retention was the best in DV but inferior in LL and AH. (2) The contents of soil organic matter, total-N, and alkali-hydrolysable-N were significantly higher in DV and HC than in LL, PG and AH; the contents of available-P and available-K was the highest in PG. (3) The situation of redox was the best in HC and the worst in AH. (4) The integrated soil quality index was in the order of DV (0.68) > HC (0.60) > PG (0.56) > LL (0.45) > AH (0.33). The results indicated that DV and HC are more helpful in improving the soil quality, and it is advisable to take shrub (DV) and grass (HC) into priority consideration for vegetation restoration in the area of high-frequency debris flow. Besides, we should focus on reducing tillage and protecting the fertilizer of soil in this area.

TI  - Invasive trees in Singapore: Are they a threat to native forests?
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925355342&doi=10.1177%2f194008291500800116&partnerID=40&md5=c922bd0f7235588b06bf109159209638
AB  - Asian tropical forests are under extreme stress from clearance, fragmentation, and logging. Because Singapore suffered these same impacts in the 19th century, it can act as an early warning system for the region. We identified invasive exotic tree species from a comprehensive survey, assessed their survival and growth in the open and under a forest canopy, and compared their traits with native pioneers and widely planted exotic species that have failed to naturalize. Nine species were invasive: Acacia auriculiformis (ear-leaf acacia), Cecropia pachystachya (trumpet tree), Falcataria moluccana (Moluccan albizia), Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena), Manihot carthaginensis subp. glaziovii (Ceara rubber tree), Muntingia calabura (Jamaican cherry tree), Piper aduncum (spiked pepper), Pipturus argenteus (white mulberry), and Spathodea campanulata (African tulip tree). Under the forest canopy, all grew little and suffered high (75-100%) mortality, with Spathodea surviving best. At the open site, mortality was low (0-25%) and height growth rapid (1.6-8.6 cm wk-1), with Leucaena growing fastest. The only significant trait difference between native pioneer trees and invasive exotics was the dispersal syndrome; none of the common native pioneers are wind dispersed, while two invasive species are. Among exotics, there were highly significant differences between invasive and non-invasive species in wood density and seed size, with invasive species having only 54% of the mean wood density and 19% of the dry seed mass of non-invasive species. Invasive exotics were also significantly farther from their native ranges than non-invasive species. None of these invasive tree species is a direct threat to the integrity of native closed-canopy forest, but they dominate on newly abandoned land and may pre-empt the recovery of native forest on such sites. © Le T.

AB  - Novel lipase from model mushroom Schizophyllum commune strain ISTL04 produced by solid state fermentation of Leucaena leucocephala seeds, was immobilized onto Celite for enzymatic FAMEs production from cyanobacterial endolith Leptolyngbya ISTCY101. The isolate showed vigorous growth and produced remarkable lipase activity of 146.5Ug-1 dry solid substrate, without any external lipase inducer. Single-factor experiments were carried out to study the effects of various reaction parameters on the FAMEs yield. The best conditions for enzymatic transesterification as revealed by the results were: 1:3 oil to methanol molar ratio, added at 3h intervals, 12% water content, 1581.5Ug-1 immobilized lipase, temperature 45°C, and time 24h. Under these conditions, the maximum FAMEs yield reached 94%. The immobilized lipase was able to produce >90% of the relative FAMEs yield after four repeated transesterification cycles. This immobilized lipase exhibited potential for application in biodiesel industry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A theoretical approach to the relationship between wettability and surface microstructures of epidermal cells and structured cuticles of flower petals
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928966792&doi=10.1093%2faob%2fmcv024&partnerID=40&md5=6f0826ab8af7c1325cb366fa3d954cac
AB  - Background and Aims The epidermal surface of a flower petal is composed of convex cells covered with a structured cuticle, and the roughness of the surface is related to the wettability of the petal. If the surface remains wet for an excessive amount of time the attractiveness of the petal to floral visitors may be impaired, and adhesion of pathogens may be promoted. However, it remains unclear how the epidermal cells and structured cuticle contribute to surface wettability of a petal. Methods By considering the additive effects of the epidermal cells and structured cuticle on petal wettability, a thermodynamic model was developed to predict the wetting mode and contact angle of a water droplet at a minimum free energy. Quantitative relationships between petal wettability and the geometries of the epidermal cells and the structured cuticle were then estimated. Measurements of contact angles and anatomical traits of petals were made on seven herbaceous species commonly found in alpine habitats in eastern Nepal, and the measured wettability values were compared with those predicted by the model using the measured geometries of the epidermal cells and structured cuticles. Key Results The model indicated that surface wettability depends on the height and interval between cuticular steps, and on a height-to-width ratio for epidermal cells if a thick hydrophobic cuticle layer covers the surface. For a petal epidermis consisting of lenticular cells, a repellent surface results when the cuticular step height is greater than 0·85μm and the height-to-width ratio of the epidermal cells is greater than 0·3. For an epidermis consisting of papillate cells, a height-to-width ratio of greater than 1·1 produces a repellent surface. In contrast, if the surface is covered with a thin cuticle layer, the petal is highly wettable (hydrophilic) irrespective of the roughness of the surface. These predictions were supported by the measurements of petal wettability made on flowers of alpine species. Conclusions The results indicate that surface roughness caused by epidermal cells and a structured cuticle produces a wide range of petal wettability, and that this can be successfully modelled using a thermodynamic approach. © 2015 The Author.

AB  - Photoconductive antenna (PCA) is promising devices that are most frequently used in Terahertz (THz) generation and detection system. However, THz PCA has limitation due to low output power (μW) and inefficient sources. Substrate material is one of parameters considered to enhance the THz output power radiation of PCA. This paper is aimed to investigate the electron mobility in Leucaena Leucocephala (Local Malaysian name Petai Belalang) Wood Plastic Composite for THz PCA radiation enhancement using Hall-effect measurement system (ECOPIA HMS-3000) equipment by 300 Kelvin room temperature with variance input currents. Data gathered by this material is compared with material made of 100% polypropylene polymer relatively with the same data input and supported by the literature research results. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Aboitic stress such as drought and salinity are class of major threats, which plants undergo through their lifetime. Lignin deposition is one of the responses to such abiotic stresses. The gene encoding Cinnamoyl CoA Reductase (CCR) is a key gene for lignin biosynthesis, which has been shown to be over-expressed under stress conditions. In the present study, developing seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala (Vernacular name: Subabul, White popinac) were treated with 1 % mannitol and 200 mM NaCl to mimic drought and salinity stress conditions, respectively. Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) based expression pattern of CCR protein was monitored coupled with Phlorogucinol/HCl activity staining of lignin in transverse sections of developing L. leucocephala seedlings under stress. Our result suggests a differential lignification pattern in developing root and stem under stress conditions. Increase in lignification was observed in mannitol treated stems and corresponding CCR protein accumulation was also higher than control and salt stress treated samples. On the contrary CCR protein was lower in NaCl treated stems and corresponding lignin deposition was also low. Developing root tissue showed a high level of CCR content and lignin deposition than stem samples under all conditions tested. Overall result suggested that lignin accumulation was not affected much in case of developing root however developing stems were significantly affected under drought and salinity stress condition. © 2015, Prof. H.S.

AB  - The disposal of poultry processing industry waste into the environment without proper care, can cause contamination. Agricultural monitored application is an alternative for disposal, considering its high amount of organic matter and its potential as a soil fertilizer. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of poultry processing industry waste to improve the conditions of a degraded soil from a desertification hotspot, contributing to leguminous tree seedlings growth. The study was carried out under greenhouse conditions in a randomized blocks design and a 4×2 factorial scheme with five replicates. The treatments featured four amounts of poultry processing industry waste (D1=control 0kgha-1; D2=1020.41kgha-1; D3=2040.82kgha-1; D4=4081.63kgha-1) and two leguminous tree species (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit). The poultry processing industry waste was composed of poultry blood, grease, excrements and substances from the digestive system. Plant height, biomass production, plant nutrient accumulation and soil organic carbon were measured forty days after waste application. Leguminous tree seedlings growth was increased by waste amounts, especially M. caesalpiniaefolia Benth, with height increment of 29.5cm for the waste amount of 1625kgha-1, and L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, with maximum height increment of 20cm for the waste amount of 3814.3kgha-1. M. caesalpiniaefolia Benth had greater initial growth, as well as greater biomass and nutrient accumulation compared with L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. However, belowground biomass was similar between the evaluated species, resulting in higher root/shoot ratio for L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Soil organic carbon did not show significant response to waste amounts, but it did to leguminous tree seedlings growth, especially L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Poultry processing industry waste contributes to leguminous tree seedlings growth, indicating that it can be part of a long-term strategy to increase soil organic carbon in degraded soil from a desertification hotspot. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present study Leucaena leucocephala Seed Shell Waste used as a precursor for the preparation of activated carbon. The characteristic of the prepared activated were analysed using SEM, FTIR and XRD analysis. The equilibrium studies were carried by isotherm models namely, Langmuir and Freundlich model. The equilibrium adsorption result was best fitted with Langmuir isotherm model and its maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was 72.34 mg/g for acid orange 7. Adsorption kinetics studies showed that the pseudo second-order kinetic model yield the best fit. An intraparticle diffusion model suggested that the intraparticle diffusion was not rate-controlling step. Thermodynamics studies revealed that the spontaneous and exothermic nature of the sorption process. The results indicate that the Leucaena leucocephala seed shells could be utilized as a potential adsorbent for the adsorption of acid orange 7. © Research India Publications.

AB  - We performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the equilibrium and flow properties of a liquid in a nano-channel with confining surfaces coated with a layer of grafted semiflexible polymers. The coverage spans a wide range of grafting densities from essentially isolated chains to dense brushes. The end-grafted polymers were described by a bead spring model with a harmonic potential to include the bond stiffness of the chains. We varied the rigidity of the chains, from fully flexible polymers to rigid rods, in which the configurational entropy of the chains is negligible. The brush-liquid interaction was tuned to obtain a super-hydrophobic channel, in which the liquid did not penetrate the polymer brush, giving rise to a Cassie-Baxter state. Equilibrium properties such as brush height and bending energy were measured, varying the grafting density and the stiffness of the polymers. We also studied the characteristics of the brush-liquid interface and the morphology of the polymer chains supporting the liquid for different bending rigidities. Non-equilibrium simulations were performed, moving the walls of the channel in opposite directions at constant speed, obtaining a Couette velocity profile in the bulk liquid. The molecular degrees of freedom of the polymers were studied as a function of the Weissenberg number. Also, the violation of the no-slip boundary condition and the slip properties were analyzed as a function of the shear rate, grafting density and bending stiffness. At high grafting densities, a finite slip length independent of the shear rate or bending constant was found, while at low grafting densities a very interesting non-monotonic dependence on the bending constant is observed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Nutrition is a major component in livestock production. The use of alternative feed resources which are adaptive to long dry seasons is important. A study was conducted to establish options of improving nutrition, palatability and to determine the performance of goats fed on cactus-browse hay as dry season supplements. Sixteen castrated goats were housed in individual metabolism cages for sixty-three days in a randomised design with four replicates for the four treatment diets. The experimental and basal diet intakes were measured daily while live weights were taken weekly. Daily feed intakes measured were significantly different (p<. 0.05) among treatments. Kids that were supplemented with Cactus- Leucaena leucocephala meal (CACT-LL) consumed more than those on Cactus- Acacia angusitissima meal (CACT-AA) and Cactus- Macroptilium atropurpureum meal (CACT-MA) but not significantly different from the commercial growers meal. Pennisetum purpureum (bana) grass hay was offered as basal diet. It was observed that all diets were readily palatable. However, the commercial diet had significantly higher basal diet intake compared to other experimental diets. Average daily weight gains were higher in CACT-LL and commercial diet. Moreover, all treatment diets led to increased growth rates and live-mass gains in goats. Animals that were given commercial diet and CACT-LL performed better than those supplemented with CACT-AA and CACT-MA. The weights were significantly different. Fresh cactus can be mixed with different browse legume hay and provide cover for dry season quality feed deficit and at the same time improve growth rate and overall weight gain. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Modelled greenhouse gas emissions from beef cattle grazing irrigated leucaena in northern Australia
PY  - 2016

AB  - Agriculture produces an estimated 14.5% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gases, with livestock emissions being the largest source of enteric methane. Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production and processing of beef cattle will become increasingly important with time, particularly in line with global efforts to mitigate rising GHG emissions. The present study compared several GHG emission scenarios from beef cattle grazing on irrigated Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit cv. Cunningham (leucaena) in Queensland, Australia. Animals began grazing the leucaena paddocks when they were 16 months old and continued until ∼240 days, before being sold to market. Three scenarios were modelled with cattle grazing leucaena and the resulting GHG emissions calculated, representing (1) the current leucaena paddock (current leucaena scenario), (2) clearing native vegetation and extending the leucaena paddock (extended leucaena scenario) and (3) extending the leucaena paddock onto previously cleared paddocks (alternative leucaena scenario). These were compared with a pre-scenario baseline, where the steers grazed on native vegetation until the time of sale. Herd GHG emission intensities (EI) were reduced in comparison with the baseline (EI of 8.4 tCO2-e/t liveweight sold) for all the leucaena scenarios, where reductions were modelled for the current, extended and alternative leucaena scenarios, which had an EI of 3.9, 3.7 and 3.6 tCO2-e/ t liveweight sold, respectively. Reductions were attributed to the higher growth rates of the steers on leucaena and the anti-methanogenic potential of leucaena. Where leucaena was planted on previously cleared paddocks, carbon stocks (t C/ha) nearly doubled a decade following planting, with most carbon sequestered in the soil. However, total carbon stocks on the property reduced over the modelled period (112 years), where native vegetation, e.g. eucalyptus woodland, was cleared for leucaena planting, but soil carbon yield increased. The combined sequestration of leucaena and the reduction of GHG emission intensities resulted in overall net reductions of GHG emissions for the three leucaena scenarios compared with the baseline. These results demonstrated that the use of leucaena for grazing can be an effective means for farmers to reduce the GHG emissions and increase productivity of their herds. The study also demonstrated that it would take 9 years of reduced emissions to compensate for the carbon lost as emissions from clearing the eucalyptus woodland, suggesting that farmers should use other methods of intensifying production from existing leucaena paddocks if their sole purpose is short-term emissions abatement. © CSIRO 2016.

AB  - The use of arboreal legume phytomass in coffee cropping appears as an alternative way to improve the soil chemical properties and also to reduce production cost. The present paper aims to evaluate the effect of surface application of four arboreal legume phytomass (Cajanus cajan, Mimosa scabrella, Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia mangium) on soil chemical quality and verify the potential to substitute the use of chemical fertilizers (NPK) in coffee cropping under this management. This study was carried out at EPAMIG, in Sao Sebastiao do Paraíso, MG, a Southern Brazilian experiment coffee cropping station. The phytomass of all legumes improved the soil chemical quality, especially Leucaena leucocephala, which also showed potential to reduce costs of NPK fertilizers on coffee cropping. © 2015, Editora UFLA.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the biomass production of elephant grass and leucaena in Paraná state, Brazil, for the generation of renewable energy. Two field studies were conducted in the municipality of Ibiporã (23° S, 51° 01'W). In the first study, the dry matter accumulation curves were calculated, with sampling at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 days after cultivation. The second study was conducted in a randomized complete block design with split plots. The total aboveground biomass production of elephant grass and leucaena was estimated in the main plot. Cutting times of 60 and 120 days after cultivation were evaluated in the subplots. The productivity of dry matter (kg.ha-1) was estimated using the biomass data. In addition, the potential production of energy from the burning of elephant grass biomass, and the potential production of total aboveground biomass and energy of elephant grass (in Paraná) was estimated using an agrometeorological model. Elephant grass can be potentially used as an alternative energy source. Leucaena has slow initial growth, and it must therefore be evaluated over a longer period in order to determine its potential. Simulation analyses of the capability of power generation, conducted based on the annual dry matter production, revealed that elephant grass could be an important source of renewable energy in the state of Paraná.

TI  - A tannin-blocking agent does not modify the preference of sheep towards tannin-containing plants
PY  - 2015

AB  - Sheep have been suggested to use their senses to perceive plant properties and associate their intake with consequences after ingestion. However, sheep with browsing experience do not seem to select against tannin-rich browsing materials in cafeteria trials. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the chemical composition, selectivity index (SI), preference and intake rate (IR) of tannin-containing forage trees offered to sheep in cafeteria experiments. Four trees were selected for their condensed tannin content and their varying biological activities. Havardia albicans (high biological activity), Leucaena leucocephala (medium biological activity), Acacia gaumeri (low biological activity) and Brosimum alicastrum (very low biological activity) were used in this study. Ten hair sheep (23.7. kg ± 1.43. LW) with eight months of browsing experience in native vegetation were used in this study. Polyethylene glycol (PEG 3600. MW) was administered to five sheep during all experiments. In experiment 1, fresh foliage from all trees was offered ad libitum for 4. h. In experiment 2, B. alicastrum was withdrawn and the preference was determined again. The forage preference in experiment 1 was A. gaumeri (14.77 g DM/kg LW) > B. alicastrum (11.77 g DM/kg LW) > H. albicans (3.71 g DM/kg. LW) = L leucocephala (1.87 g DM/kg LW) (P< 0.05). The preference in experiment 2 was A. gaumeri> H. albicans= L. leucocephala. PEG administration had no effect on the preference or IR. The intake rate seemed to have been affected by the plant density. Moreover, fiber compounds were found to be better predictors of DM intake than polyphenolic compounds at levels typically found in the evaluated forages. It was concluded that tannins and PEG did not modify the preferences of sheep in cafeteria trials. Thus, tannins are not involved in the preference regulation of animals with browsing experience. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of various sawdust substrates, namely Ficus carica (Fig tree, T2), Albizia saman (Rain Tree, T3), Swietenia mahagoni (Mahogany tree, T4), Leucaena leucocephala (Ipil ipil tree, T5), Eucalyptus oblique (Indian gum tree, T6) and mixture of mentioned five trees sawdust (T1) supplemented with 30% wheat bran and 1% lime on the mineral content and nutritional composition analyses of Plurotus florida mushroom. The highest amount of carbohydrate (43.68mg/100g), dry matter (9.87%), nitrogen (4.43%), potassium (1.39%), magnesium (19.96mg/100g) and iron (44.69mg/100g) were obtained from T4 sawdust substrate. The highest amount of phosphorous (0.89%) was obtained from T1 substrate. The highest amount of lipid (4.21%), protein (27.68%), ash (13.67%), moisture (90.27%) and molybdenum (9.76mg/100g) were obtained from T2 sawdust substrate. The lowest amount of lipid (3.42%) was found for T6 substrate. The highest amount of crude fiber (19.78%), calcium (33.35mg/100g) and selenium (9.10 mg/100g) were obtained from T5 substrate. The highest amount of cobalt (21.07mg/100g) and zinc (30.26mg/100g) were obtained from T3 sawdust substrate. Thus, they could be an excellent source of many different nutraceuticals and might be used directly in human diet to promote health for the synergistic effects of all the bioactive compounds present. The study proved beneficial for effective management of agricultural wastes as well as production of nutraceutical effective fruiting bodies for balanced diet. © 2015, University of Dhaka.

AB  - The autumn migration of Skylarks Alauda arvensis along the southern Tyrrhenian coast of Italy from 1998 until 2014 is described, with respect to timing and phenology, sex-specific migration patterns and population trends. In total, 21,610 fully grown birds were captured and ringed, using mist nets, from October to mid November. The frequency distribution of wing length shows a clear bimodality due to sexual dimorphism, with males having longer wings than females. Wing length was used to determine sex in 20,622 individuals using Harding–Cassie plots: 57.1% were identified as females, 38.3% as males and 4.6% were undetermined. Autumn migration of Skylarks peaked during the second and third 10-day periods of October. Females migrated earlier than males: the median date of migration, based on combined data for all years, was 19 October for females and 25 October for males. The main migration period, expressed as the interquartile range, fell between 12 and 26 October for females and between 17 and 29 October for males. Based on capture numbers, we infer a fairly stable population migrating through the Volturno Plain, but with significant year-to-year fluctuations. © 2015 British Trust for Ornithology.

TI  - A new index to estimate reactivity and biological effect of tannins, using tropical browse legumes as a model
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929655086&doi=10.1016%2fj.anifeedsci.2015.04.007&partnerID=40&md5=96fdf48d3f9862520709b0de6dcf5673
AB  - The aim of this paper was to propose a new approach to evaluate the effect of tannins on rumen microbial fermentation in terms of biological effect (proportion of the response if tannins are inactivated, BE) and reactivity (capability of tannins to bind chemically with different amounts of a reagent), by recording gas production in 24. h in vitro incubation of substrates with increasing levels (0.025-1. g/g substrate) of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Three tropical browse legumes with different tannin contents (Acacia cornigera, Albizia lebbekoides and Leucaena leucocephala) were chosen as model substrates. The reactivity index (RI, mg PEG) and absolute reactivity index (aRI, mg PEG/ml gas) were estimated from the rate coefficient of fitting gas production per unit of added PEG to an exponential equation for each incubation time. The RI characterises each specific tannin source, and depends on the potential fermentation of the plant. The average RI values of A. cornigera, L. leucocephala and A. lebbekoides were 70.4, 36.3 and 55.7. mg PEG, respectively. The aRI is a tool for species comparison, because it is referred to the total volume of gas produced. It was higher in A. lebbekoides, intermediate in A. cornigera and lowest in L. leucocephala (1.57, 0.76 and 1.14. mg. PEG/ml gas, respectively; P=0.012). This index was higher at 6. h than at 12 and 24. h (1.62, 0.96 and 0.89. mg PEG/ml gas, P<0.001). The estimation of these indexes is a simple and inexpensive tool that gives a more complete view of the biological activity pattern of tannins in practical conditions, complementing that of other biological effect indexes and avoiding the biases that arise from their chemical analysis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives. To relate the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus tick loads on cows grazing either in intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) (Lucerna) or in grass pastures associated with sugarcane plantations (La Isabela). Materials and methods. Tick counts were performed on 27 Lucerne breed animals that were in different physiological states, six of which were grazing on forage grass paddocks associated with commercial sugarcane plantations and the remaining animals grazed in an ISS based on Leucaena leucocephala and Cynodon plectostachyus. The tick counts were made every 15 days. The data of temperature, humidity, and radiation were taken from a weather station that was inside the ISS. Results. There was a weak relationship between saturation deficit and tick load (R2=0.34) and another between UV radiation and tick load (R2=0.205) for animals grazing in ISS. There were differences in tick counts when comparing animals of similar productivity from both systems evaluated: in La Isabela (sugarcane grass paddocks) average counts were 311 ticks perceptible to the touch (TPT) and in Lucerna (ISS farm) average counts were 206 TPT (p= 0.02). Additionally, there were greater tick counts in high productivity cows compared to low productivity cows. Conclusions. The abiotic and biotic factors of the ecosystem and animal productivity can affect the TPT counts. In ISS systems, tick counts can be lower than those observed in monoculture grazing systems.

AB  - High temperature and rainfall contribute in turning most of the slope soils acidic in countries like Malaysia. Acidic slope again contributes in a low plant coverage, high eroding potential and instability of slopes. In this context, this study aims at investigating the effects of pre-Aluminum treatment on the growth and development of selected plants on acidic slope. The acidic-tolerant characteristics of Acacia mangium, Leucaena leucocephala and Melastoma malabathricum were determined by subjecting them into pre-Aluminum treatment at germination phase. The results showed that M. malabathricum exhibited the highest morphological parameters; root length and dry weight partitioning and physiological performance including photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and leaf Aluminum analyses. Within ten weeks of observation, the Al-pretreated M. malabathricum showed the highest photosynthetic and transpiration rates as compared to L. leucocephala and A. mangium. Simultaneously, stomatal conductance was found to be the highest in M. malabathricum. Moreover, within ten weeks, soil pH planted with M. malabathricum increased by 23.8% and was found to be the highest among the species studied, implying the rehabilitation capacity of this species. The Al-pretreated M. malabathricum also displayed the longest root length in acidic soil exhibiting a tolerance mechanism towards soil acidity. Amongst the species studied, M. malabathricum, either treated or non-treated, exhibited the best morphological and physiological performances on acidic conditions.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) was introduced to Ethiopia in the early 1980s. Even though this plant is not yet problematic, nor categorized as an invasive species in the country, there are several reports that place leucaena as an extremely damaging weed elsewhere, raising warning signs regarding the potential impacts of the plant in Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to make a preliminary assessment of the impact of a pre-dispersal seed feeding bruchid associated with L. leucocephala and determine its impacts on seed germination in Ethiopia. The study demonstrated that the bruchid Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae) was present at all sites surveyed and damaged up to 44 % of seeds of L. leucocephala at the study sites. Damaged seeds showed reduced germination performance resulting in seedlings with weak, yellow and fragile root systems compared to healthy seeds. This is the first report on the presence of A. macrophthalmus in Ethiopia. Therefore, future studies need to focus on the level of infestations of the plant and the impacts of the plant across the country.

AB  - Renewable energy produced from biomass is a green way to reduce the greenhouse effect. Fast-growing wood species, as the energy source, create independent and fast harvesting cycle for energy fuel stock. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of tree diameter at breast height (DBH) of a local wood species i.e. leucaena leucocephala, on char yield during pyrolysis. The calorific value (CV) of bio char was also determined in order to analyse the bio char product produced by pyrolysis process. The tree samples were classified into three DBH i.e. 4, 8 and 12 cm and only tree stem was selected for pelletization. The wood pellets were pyrolyzed at 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 °C with 40 °C/min of heating rate and holding time of 30 min in inert condition. The largest difference percentage of bio char yield production is only 1 % while the largest difference of CV is 0.7 MJ/kg which happened at temperature 300 °C. In this study, it was found that any DBH does not give any significant effect to the production of bio char as well as its CV. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Self-cleaning materials have gained considerable attention for both their unique properties and practical applications in energy and environmental areas. Recent examples of many TiO2-derived materials have been illustrated to understand the fundamental principles of self-cleaning hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. Various models including those proposed by Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter and Miwa-Hashimoto are discussed to explain the mechanism of self-cleaning. Examples of semiconductor surfaces exhibiting the simultaneous occurrence of superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains on the same surface are illustrated, which can have various advanced applications in microfluidics, printing, photovoltaic, biomedical devices, anti-bacterial surfaces and water purification. Several strategies to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic self-cleaning property have been discussed including doping with metals and non-metals, formation of hetero-junctions between TiO2 and other low bandgap semiconductors, and fabrication of graphene based semiconductor nano-composites. Different mechanisms such as band-gap narrowing, formation of localized energy levels within the bandgap and formation of intrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies have been suggested to account for the improved activity of doped TiO2 photocatalysts. Various preparation routes for developing efficient superhydrophilic-superhydrophobic patterns have been reviewed. In addition, reversible photo-controlled surfaces with tuneable hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties and its technological applications are discussed. Examples of antireflective surfaces exhibiting self-cleaning properties for the applications in solar cells and flat panel displays have also been provided. Discussion is provided on TiO2 based self-cleaning materials exhibiting hydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic properties and their utilities in water management, antifouling applications and separation of oil in water emulsions are discussed. In addition, ISO testing methods (ISO 27448: 2009, ISO 10678: 2010 and ISO 27447: 2009) for analysing self-cleaning activity and antibacterial action have also been discussed. Rapid photocatalytic self-cleaning testing methods using various photocatalytic activity indicator inks such as resazurin (Rz), basic blue 66 (BB66) and acid violet 7(AV7) for a broad range of materials such as commercial paints, tiles and glasses are also described. Various commercial products such as glass, tiles, fabrics, cement and paint materials developed based on the principle of photo-induced hydrophilic conversion of TiO2 surfaces have also been provided. The wide ranges of practical applications of self-cleaning photocatalytic materials suggest further development to improve their efficiency and utilities. It was concluded that a rational fabrication of multifunctional photocatalytic materials by integrating biological inspired structures with tunable wettability would be favorable to address a number of existing environmental concerns. © 2015.

AB  - Litterfall and its subsequent decomposition in the soil are two essential ecosystem processes. In order to determine the biological potential of a species to aid soil restoration, it is necessary to evaluate litter production, its temporal variation, and rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling. In this study, we examined patterns of litterfall production, quality, and decomposition of two slow-growing (Crescentia alata and Eysenhardtia polystachya) and two fast-growing (Leucaena leucocephala and Pithecellobium dulce), multi-purpose indigenous species from seasonally dry tropical forest, in a 10-year-old plantation in Morelos, Mexico. Average litterfall was 7.82 ± 2.69 Mg ha−1 year−1 and varied significantly among species as follows: P. dulce > L. leucocephala > C. alata = E. polstachya. Leaf litter comprised the highest fraction in all species studied. In a litterbag experiment, all species had fast mass loss in the first 183 days of decomposition, coinciding with the rainy season. L. leucocephala had significantly higher decomposition than the other species. Nitrogen percentages increased significantly as decomposition progressed for all species except for E. polystachya while Carbon percentages during decomposition significantly decreased only in C. alata and L. leucocephala. C. alata had the highest average C/N ratio and L. leucocephala the lowest. We recommended for soil biological restoration, P. dulce because it is a fast-growing tree, with a rapid canopy closure and a high litter production and L. Leucocephala, which produces large amounts of rapidly decomposing mulch with high amount of nutrients, which can be rapidly released into the soil. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Through one-to-one interaction with the traditional healers, the present study has identified 15 medicinal plant species traditionally used as remedies to control diabetes. Materials and methods: The methanolic extracts were screened for their a-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Hypoglycemic activity was assessed following glucose, sucrose and starch tolerance test on normal and STZ induced diabetic rats. Results: Ficus cunia extract had the highest a-glucosidase inhibitory potency with IC50 1.397 0.74 μg mL-1 followed by Schima wallichi (IC50 1.43 7 0.20 μg mL-1) and Wendlandia glabrata (IC50 1.67 7 0.33 μg mL-1). In STZ induced diabetic rat model, F. cunia and Wglabrata extracts reduced blood glucose concentration to near normal up to 14 days when administered 48 h after STZ. Conclusion: The present study supports the traditional use of some of these medicinal plants in antidiabetic remedies. The present study contributes to evidence for use of traditional medicine. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to determine the effect of germination time on the antioxidant activity of Leucaena leucocephala (lmk.) de Wit (lead tree) sprouts. Determination of antioxidant activity was carried out on ethanol extract of germinated seeds using β-carotene bleaching assay. The results showed that the antioxidant activity of germinated seeds were affected by germination time. Germination for 4 days affected the greatest enhancement in antioxidant activity by 2.78 fold and caused a significant increment in total phenolic content by 7.29, β-carotene by 3.27, ascorbic acid by 3.81 and a-tocopherol by 4.58 fold, respect to imbibed seeds. The total phenolics content was 53.42±0.22 mg CAE/g dw, β-carotene was 530.99±71.13 10-3 mg/100 g, ascorbic acid was 152.37±2.06 mg/100 g, and α-tocopherol was 59.27±0.10 mg/100 g sample. The findings suggested that the L. leucocephala sprouts could be considered as a source of natural antioxidant. © All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Macaria mirthae Vargas et al (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) is a geometrid moth native to the northern Atacama Desert of Chile. Its oligophagous larvae are associated with native hosts of the plant family Fabaceae, the most important of which is Acacia macracantha. The invasive tree Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) was recently recorded as a host plant for M. mirthae based on morphology. The taxonomic status of larvae collected on A. macracantha and L. leucocephala was assessed using sequences of the DNA barcode fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Genetic divergence between samples from the host plants was found to be 0%–0.8% (Kimura 2-parameter model). Neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood analyses were also performed, including additional barcode sequences of Neotropical geometrid moths from GenBank and BOLD databases. Sequences of the larvae from both host plants clustered in a single clade with high statistical support in both analyses. Based on these results, it is concluded that M. mirthae has effectively expanded its host range and its larvae are currently feeding on the exotic tree L. leucocephala. Additionally, the importance of this new host association in a highly disturbed habitat is briefly discussed in terms of the field biology of this native geometrid moth. © 2015, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

AB  - Climate change is the environmental problem that has received most attention in recent decades and this is of particular interest to livestock production, as this activity contributes significantly to the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly methane, and also suffers the consequences of climate change. The aim of this study was to compare the enteric (in vivo) methane emissions and dry matter consumption of Lucerne heifers fed diets from an intensive silvopastoril system (ISS) with leucaena with heifers fed in a traditional production system. The ISS diet consisted of star grass (Cynodon plectostachyus), guinea (Megathyrsus maximus) and the legume leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), while the traditional system diet contained only the two grasses. Methane productions were measured using the polythnnel technique in a cross over arrangement, with ten days of adaptation to the diet and one day of measurements. Forage samples were analyzed for their nutrient content. Gas was measured every hour for 24 consecutive hours and the methane concentration was determined by gas chromatography. Leucaena had higher contents of protein, while both grasses were characterized by their greater dietary contributions of neutral detergent fiber. The average dry matter intake was significantly higher (P = 0.01) in the ISS diet (2.9% of live weight) than in the traditional diet (2.4% of LW). Methane production per kg of degraded dry matter was 37.6 g and 55.7g (p=0.01) and the energy lost as methane was 6.74% and 9.09 (P = 0.04) for the ISS and traditional diets, respectively. We conclude that in ISS allows for an increment in nutrient intake and production without increasing enteric methane emissions. © 2015 Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agricultural Solid waste was used for the recovery of valuable materials like Leucaena leucocephala seed shell find a significant role in the adsorption. Activated carbon samples are prepared by different activation process and SEM, XRD, FTIR analysis. Owing to the high active surface properties of the activated carbons are due to he functional groups present in it and Surface morphology also plays a vital role in the sorption properties. The caron samples were analysed for their Physico-Chemical characteristics. The results show that an activated carbon with high adsorptive properties can be conveniently prepared from Leucaena leucocephala seed shell waste impregnation with H3PO4 solution process followed by activation at 800 oC yields with more porosity and high surface area. Suitability of the effective adsorbent was analysed for the various dye solutions. ©2015 RASAYAN. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cultivating maize under systems of alley cropping results in improvements to the soil, a reduction in weeds and an increase in yield. Studies using ground cover from tree shoots produce similar results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on weed growth and maize yield of ground cover made up of 30 t ha-1 (fresh matter) of branches from the tree species: neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss), gliricidia [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp.], leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.] and sabiá (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth.). Two treatment groups (cultivars and weed control) were evaluated. The cultivars AG 1041 and AL Bandeirantes were subjected to the following treatments: no hoeing, double hoeing, and ground a cover of branches of the above species when sowing the maize. A randomised block design was used with split lots (cultivars in the lots) and ten replications. The cultivars did not differ for green ear or grain yield. Double hoeing was more effective than ground cover at reducing the growth of weeds. However, both weeding and ground cover resulted in similar yields for green ears and grain, which were greater than those obtained with the unweeded maize.

AB  - Planting tree species with desirable traits may catalyze forest regeneration in increasingly common degraded lands by restoring soil properties and attracting seed dispersers. We sampled forest regeneration in an experimental plantation of Albizia lebbek, an introduced N-fixing species, on a degraded pasture in northern Puerto Rico, 27. years after its establishment. We hypothesized that the abundance of animal-dispersed tree species within this unmanaged plantation would be (1) greater than in adjacent pastures; (2) higher at distances closer to secondary forest; and (3) increased over the 20. years since floristic surveys were last conducted in the site. We sampled forest structure and tree species composition, and compared the abundance of animal-dispersed tree species on plots located within the adjacent pasture and the A. lebbek plantation, within the plantation in plots distanced at 10, 35, and 60. m from secondary forest, and within the plantation at 7 vs. 27. years after plantation establishment. We found higher abundance of animal-dispersed tree species in the A. lebbek plantation than in the pasture. Distance from secondary forest had no effect on the abundance of animal-dispersed species. The abundance of animal-dispersed species increased by 14% between 7 and 27. years after plantation establishment. In all, these results indicate that A. lebbek trees facilitated the establishment of native animal-dispersed species by shading out tall grasses and acting as perches for animals throughout the plantation. We found that A. lebbek lost its dominance in the site to another introduced N-fixing species, Leucaena leucocephala, possibly due to unfavorable traits such as susceptibility to pathogens. Our findings document a transition from an experimental plantation to a novel urban forest that harbors an array of native tree species, largely due to the dispersal of seeds by animals. A noteworthy example is the presence of Guaiacum officinale, an animal-dispersed and endangered tree species native to the dry forests of southern Puerto Rico. Our results highlight how monocultures of introduced tree species with desirable traits can catalyze the regeneration of native tree species in chronically degraded lands. © 2015.

AB  - Agroforestry, a land-use system, is receiving wider attention not only in terms of agricultural sustainability but also in issues related to climate change. The potentiality to sequester carbon by agroforestry species in sub-tropical regions like Bangladesh is promising. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the carbon sequestration potentiality of three agroforestry species (Albizia lebbeck, Leucaena leucocephala and Melia azedarach) in the northern part of Bangladesh. The carbon sequestration potential of three agroforestry species varied from 115 to 135 Mg C/ha/year at the age of seven years after plantation. Among the agroforestry tree species, L. leucocephala sequestrated maximum amount (135 Mg C/ha/year) of carbon from the atmosphere followed by M. azedarach (120 Mg C/ha/year) and A. lebbeck (115 Mg C/ha/year). Therefore, carbon sequestration potentiality of the studied agroforestry species can be ranked as L. leucocephala>M. azedarach>A. lebbeck.

AB  - The study aimed to identify the chemical constituents of Leucaeana leucocephala leaves and evaluate the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the extract and compounds. An acylated flavanol glycoside, quercetin - 3-O-(2''-trans-p-coumaryl)-α-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''→6'')-β-glucopyranoside (1) in addition to quercetin-3-O-α- rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''→2'')-β-glucopyranoside (2), quercetin-7-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''→2'')-β-glucopyrano side(3), quercetin-3-O-α- rhamnopyranoside(4), quercetin-3-O-β-glucopyranoside (5), isovitexin( 6), vitexin (7) and quercetin (8) were isolated for the first time from the Leucaeana leucocephala. The antioxidant activity of the extract and the isolated compounds 1, 3 & 4 were evaluated by Reducing Power, FRAP, DPPH, Metal chelating and ABTS assays. Compound (3) recorded the highest antioxidant activity in comparison with the extract and other compounds. The extract and compound 1, 2, 3 and 5 were studied for their antimicrobial activity. Both the extract and compound 1 have significant activity against gm-ve bacteria, moderate to gm +ve and Candida and inactive towards fungi. The structures of compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectral analysis. L. leucocephala possess good antioxidant, antibacterial properties and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavengers, acting possibly as primary antioxidants and have to be investigated for antiinflammatory and anticancer activities. © 2015 Reda S.

AB  - Highly porous activated carbons were resource-recovered from Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. wood through combined chemical and physical activation (i.e., KOH etching followed by CO2 activation). This invasive species, which has severely damaged the ecological economics of Taiwan, was used as the precursor for producing high-quality carbonaceous electrodes for capacitive deionization (CDI). Carbonization and activation conditions strongly influenced the structure of chars and activated carbons. The total surface area and pore volume of activated carbons increased with increasing KOH/char ratio and activation time. Overgasification induced a substantial amount of mesopores in the activated carbons. In addition, the electrochemical properties and CDI electrosorptive performance of the activated carbons were evaluated; cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements revealed a typical capacitive behavior and electrical double layer formation, confirming ion electrosorption in the porous structure. The activated-carbon electrode, which possessed high surface area and both mesopores and micropores, exhibited improved capacitor characteristics and high electrosorptive performance. Highly porous activated carbons derived from waste L. leucocephala were demonstrated to be suitable CDI electrode materials. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In present study 20 Dichanthium annulatum-DA grass based diets formulated with browse foliage from 5 tree leaves (Hardwickia binata-HB, Albizia lebbek-AL, Grewia optiva-GO, Anogeissus pendulla-AP and Leucaena leucocephala-LL) and five shrubs (Dichrostachys cineria-DC, Securengia virosa-SV, Zizyphus xylophyrus-ZX, Helictris isora-HI and Acacia catechu-AC) in 50:50 and 75: 25 ratios were assessed for in vitro nutrients degradation, metabolites and gas production using sheep and goat rumen liquor. CP, NDF, ADF and cellulose contents differ significantly (P<0.05) amongst the diets. CP contents were higher in DA: LL (9.55) and DA: AL (8.58) diets and lowest in DA: HB diet (4.87%), while NDF, ADF and cellulose contents were higher in DA: AL (62.86, 42.09 and 32.82%) and lowest in DA: LL (55.15, 31.75 and 24.24 %). Mean values of DM, CP, NDF and ADF degradability varied significantly across diets in rumen inoculum of both species. DA: LL, DA: SV and DA: GO diets had higher DM, CP, NDF and ADF degradability in rumen liquor of both animal species. TVFA, total-N and ammonia-N contents were higher in sheep and goat from DA: LL, DA: SV and DA: GO diets. Sheep and goat rumen liquor had higher mean total-N contents at 50:50 ration of grass-foliage diets (45.36 and 47.57) than at 75: 25 ratio (36.00 and 36.96 mg/dl), respectively. Mean values of IVDMD (%), gas (ml/g) and partition factor differed across the diets in both species. Diets mean values for IVDMD and gas tended to be more for goats (167.50 and 54.13) than sheep (142.99 ml/g and 52.25%), while partition factor values tended to be more for sheep (3.58) than goats (3.01). DA: LL, DA: GO and DA: SV diets had higher gas and IVDMD in rumen liquor of both species and lowest for DA: DC diet. Results showed that DA: LL, DA: GO and DA: SV have higher nutrients digestibility with higher metabolites concentration on fermentation in sheep and goat rumen liquor.

TI  - Turning Leucaena leucocephala bark to biochar for soil application via statistical modelling and optimization technique
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928243138&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoleng.2015.04.078&partnerID=40&md5=ac8710ad910741e326aa6fd649ecd6f3
AB  - Soil applicable biochar has been prepared from bark of Leucaena leucocephala wood which is a waste generated during its pulping and papermaking process. The slow pyrolysis process adopted for this purpose has been modelled and optimized employing central composite design and desirability function under response surface methodology taking temperature (308-592. °C) and time (35-205. min) as independent variable while yield, loss on ignition, stable organic matter, oxidisable carbon and carbon liability index as dependent variable. L. leucocephala bark was characterized in terms of proximate analysis (moisture 4.90%, ash 7.20%, fixed carbon 18.10%, volatile matter 69.80%), elemental analysis (carbon 45.78%, hydrogen 10.67%, nitrogen 1.77%, oxygen 32.08%, sulphur 0.09%), lignocellulosic composition (holocellulose 45.86%, hemicellulose 15.01%, lignin 34.75%) and compared with a wide range of feedstocks to find its suitability towards biochar production. The optimum pyrolysis temperature and residence time were found to be 350. °C and 60. min respectively which gave biochar yield 53.16%, loss on ignition 88.17%, oxidisable carbon 28.82%, stable organic matter 38.48%, and carbon liability index 0.32. The biochar produced at optimum conditions were characterized by proximate analysis (moisture 0.65%, ash 11.83%, fixed carbon 40.2%, volatile matter 47.57%) and elemental analysis (carbon 62.91%, hydrogen 3.12%, nitrogen 2.65%, oxygen 20.74%, sulphur 0.05%). The O/C ratio of 0.25 and H/C ratio of 0.60 confirmed its life between 100-1000 years and appropriateness for soil application as well as carbon sequestration. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory, anticholinesterase and antioxidant activity of leaf extracts of twelve plants used traditionally to alleviate pain and inflammation in South Africa
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84918824419&doi=10.1016%2fj.jep.2014.11.034&partnerID=40&md5=5d21949dc059131b71f2a3ab07f225d1
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance Oxidative stress and inflammatory conditions are among the pathological features associated with the central nervous system in Alzheimer's disease. Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used to alleviate inflammation, pains and also other symptoms possibly associated with Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine the in vitro anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticholinesterase activity of twelve South African medicinal plants traditionally used to alleviate pain and inflammation. Materials and Methods Nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages and 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory assay were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity. Acetylcholinesterase inhibition was assessed by using a modification of the Ellman's method. Antioxidant activity, total phenolic and total flavonoids contents were determined using standard in vitro methods. Results The extract of Burkea africana had the highest anti-15-lipoxygenase activity with 85.92% inhibition at 100 μg/mL. All the extracts tested inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production in a dose dependant manner in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. However, extracts from Leucaena leucocephala, Lippia javanica inhibited the production of NO by 97% at a concentration of 25 μg/mL. In addition, both Leucaena leucocephala and Englerophytum magaliesmontanum had strong activity against acetylcholinesterase with IC50 values of 118 μg/mL and 160 μg/mL respectively. Hight levels of phenolics and flavonoids were found in Leucaena leucocephala, Lippia javanica and Burkea africana. The correlation with antioxidant activities was not strong indicating that other metabolites may also be involved in antioxidant activity. Conclusions The results obtained in this study validate the use of leaf extracts of these plants in South African traditional medicine against inflammation. Extracts of these plants species might be of value in the management of various diseases emerging from oxidative stress and related degenerative disorders. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Elucidation of Leucaena leucocephala anthelmintic-like phytochemicals and the ultrastructural damage generated to eggs of Cooperia spp.
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953224673&doi=10.1016%2fj.vetpar.2015.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=2554a355cf769286e0c7cc87d85e1d03
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a tropical forage legume suggested as an alternative method to control gastrointestinal parasitism in ruminants. This study: (1) performed a bio-guided fractionation of an aqueous extract of L. leucocephala using the egg hatch assay (EHA) to identify the anthelmintic (AH)-like phytochemicals present in fresh leaves, and (2) assessed the ultrastructural damage to eggs of Cooperia spp. after incubation with the final fraction. Phytochemicals were isolated using silica gel columns and identified using high performance liquid chromatography and standards for comparison. The final fraction was evaluated using EHA at 0.06, 0.125, 0.250, 0.500 and 1.1mgml-1. The lethal concentration to inhibit 50% of Cooperia spp. egg hatching (LC50) was calculated using a Probit analysis. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed the ultrastructural changes present in Cooperia spp. eggs. Bio-guided isolation procedures led to the recognition of an active fraction (LlC1F3) mainly composed of quercetin (82.21%) and caffeic acid (13.42%) which inhibited 90.49±2.8% of Cooperia spp. egg hatching (P<0.05), and an LC50 of 0.06±0.14mgml-1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed eggs exposed to the active fraction had an irregular external layer with small projections and ruptures of lateral eggshell walls. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed changes to Cooperia spp. eggs in electro-density, including the thickness of the eggshell layers and fractures after incubation with the final fraction (LlC1F3).Changes in bioactivity after purification suggest synergistic interactions between quercetin and caffeic acid. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Three novel strains, RITF741T, RITF1220 and RITF909, isolated from root nodules of Acacia melanoxylon in Guangdong Province of China, have been previously identified as members of the genus Mesorhizobium, displaying the same 16S rRNA gene RFLP pattern. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the three strains belong to the genus Mesorhizobium and had highest similarity (100.0%) to Mesorhizobium plurifarium LMG 11892T. Phylogenetic analyses of housekeeping genes recA, atpD and glnll revealed that these strains represented a distinct evolutionary lineage within the genus Mesorhizobium. Strain RITF741T showed.73% DNA-DNA relatedness with strains RITF1220 and RITF909, but <60% DNA-DNA relatedness with the closest type strains of recognized species of the genus Mesorhizobium. They differed from each other and from their closest phylogenetic neighbours by presence/absence of several fatty acids, or by large differences in the relative amounts of particular fatty acids. While showing distinctive features, they were generally able to utilize a wide range of substrates as sole carbon sources based on API 50CH and API 20NE tests. The three strains were able to form nodules with the original host Acacia melanoxylon and other woody legumes such as Acacia aneura, Albizia falcataria and Leucaena leucocephala. In conclusion, these strains represent a novel species belonging to the genus Mesorhizobium based on the data obtained in the present and previous studies, for which the name Mesorhizobium acaciae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is RITF741T (=CCBAU 101090T=JCM 30534T), the DNA G + C content of which is 64.1 mol% (Tm). © 2015 IUMS.

AB  - The in vitro fermentation kinetics of forage mixtures used in intensive silvopastoral systems (SSPI) was determined, using seven treatments with different proportions of the grasses Cynodon plectostachyus (TTO1) and Megathyrsus maximus (TTO2), as well as the forage legumes Leucaena leucocephala (TTO3) and Guazuma ulmifolia (TTO4). The organic matter degradation, the total cumulative gases production, the fermentation and degradation kinetics of organic matter and some other indicators was determided through the in vitro gas production technique. The TTO3 cumulative gas production was smallest (144,7mL) while TTO6 had the greatest (340,23 mL). Colonization time was higher in TTO4 (10,31 horas). TTO5 (L. leucocephala 20%, C. plectostachyus 30%; M. maximus 50%) and TTO6 (G. ulmifolia 20%, C. plectostachyus 30%; M. maximus 50%), had the highest percentages of degradation (73,90 y 65,51) without difference between them. After 96 hours, the greatest organic matter degradation was observed in TTO1 (61,5%) and the lowest in TTO3 (45,6%). It was estimated that the soluble fraction was higher in TTO3 and TTO7 (G. ulmifolia 20%, L. leucocephala 20%, C. plectostachyus 20%; M. maximus 40%), 23,8% and 26,3% respectively; the degradable fraction was the greatest in TTO6 (56,4%) than TTO3 with the lowest (24,0%). The indigestible degradable fraction was lower for TTO5 (19,4%). These results suggest that forages typically used in SSPI when mixed into the diet, have associative effects that modify their fermentation profile. © 2015, Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas (INIA).

AB  - Nowadays, industry is searching for an alternative to reduce the usage of petroleum-based non-degradable conventional seedling plant pots. In this study, three different types of bioplastic pots incorporated with newspaper pulp fibres (the ratio of B75%:N25%, B50%:N50% and B25%:N75% denotes percentage of bioplastic to percentage of newspaper pulp fibres) were produced while B0%:N100% acted as the control. All cylinder square shape moulded bioplastic pots with 100 mm height and 2 mm thickness were planted with Leucaena leucocephala seedlings for 60 days in two ground levels (below ground and above ground). Weight loss for bioplastic pots was evaluated. Results showed that bioplastic pots tested below ground had a higher percentage of weight loss than those planted above ground. For percentage of weight loss of bioplastic pots, most bioplastic pots that were tested in both ground levels only showed a significant difference at p ⩽ 0.05 after 30 days. Bioplastic pots B75%:N25% that were tested below ground have the highest percentage of weight loss with 77.93%. As conclusion, B50%:N50% is the most suitable ratio for the production of bioplastic pot. © 2013

AB  - Climate and stands management have an effect on the process of wood formation via resource availability. To improve knowledge of wood quantity and physical structure, increment cores of ponderosa pine were taken in high- and low-density stands growing in Patagonia, Argentina. Microdensity profiles were performed on trees for which sapflow density (Qs) data were available over two consecutive years (2004 and 2005, dry and wet years, respectively). Conventional and non-conventional microdensity variables were analyzed in the segment of the microdensity profile where Qs was measured. Trees in the low-density stand showed a greater capacity for water transport than trees in the high-density stand, even if no constraints in the soil water availability were confirmed, as was the case for the wet year. Minimum and earlywood density were significantly higher in the high-density stand in several analyzed years. These differences were not reflected in mean density of the whole radial profile. The structural changes in physical wood properties in relation to silvicultural treatments appear to affect plant water status, even in the wet growing season: greater wood density in the first part of the tree-ring may contribute to the observed Qs decrease found in the high-density stand. This fact may lead trees to lack the coordinated mechanisms of response to drought observed in more xeric sites. The increase of wood density in the first part of the tree-ring in ponderosa pine could be not conducive to acclimation, exposing trees to an increasing "dilemma" facing drought. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effect of Leucaena leucocephala inclusion in sheep diets upon rumen function was evaluated. Nine Pelibuey sheep, 32.6 ± 5.33 kg live weight (LW), fitted with rumen cannula were used. A complete randomized block design was employed. Two experimental periods of 60 days each, with 60-day intervals between them, were used. Experimental treatments were as follows (n = 6): T1 (control), 100 % Pennisetum purpureum grass; T2, 20 % L. leucocephala + 80 % P. purpureum; T3, 40 % L. leucocephala + 60 % P. purpureum. In situ rumen neutral detergent fiber (aNDF) and crude protein (CP) degradation, dry matter intake (DMI), volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, estimated methane (CH4) yield, rumen pH, ammonia nitrogen (N-NH3), and protozoa counts were measured. The aNDF in situ rumen degradation of P. purpureum and leucaena was higher (P < 0.05) in T2 and T3. Leucaena CP degradation was higher in T2 and T3 but for P. purpureum it was only significantly higher in T3. Leucaena aNDF and CP degradation rate (c) was 50 % higher (P < 0.05) in T2 and T3, but only higher in T3 for P. purpureum. Voluntary intake and rumen (N-NH3) was higher in T2 and T3 (P = 0.0001, P = 0.005, respectively). Molar VFA proportions were similar for all treatments (P > 0.05). Protozoa counts and in vitro gas production (48 h) were lower in T2 and T3 (P < 0.05, P < 0.0001). Estimated methane yield (mol CH4/day) was higher in sheep fed leucaena (P < 0.0001). However, CH4 yield relative to animal performance (mol CH4/g LW gain) was lower in T2 and T3 (P < 0.0001). In summary, these results indicate that including L. leucocephala in sheep diets did not modify rumen fermentation pattern (same VFA ratios) nor reduce the amount of CH4 per unit of DMI (mol CH4/g DMI). However, leucaena inclusion does increase rumen N-NH3, aNDF and CP digestibility, and voluntary intake. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Ficus benghalensis and Leucaena leucocephala are perennial trees commonly known for their wide medicinal use in India. Immuno-stimulatory effect of F. benghalensis (aerial root) or L. leucocephala (pod seeds) 5 % powder as supplementary ingredients in the artificial fish feed of Indian spotted snakehead, Channa punctata, was compared with control group (fish fed with non-supplemented artificial feed). Fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila, a major disease causing bacteria in freshwater fish on weekly intervals for four consecutive weeks. Blood and tissue samples were collected on 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day after challenge. The specific immunity (antibody response) and non-specific immunity (lysozyme activity, phagocytic response, nitric oxide and SOD levels) of the fish were evaluated. The increase in the levels of SGOT and SGPT in liver of fish fed with non-supplemented feed indicated damage of most targeting organs by A. hydrophila. However, the levels did not changed significantly in fish fed with experimental feed till the end of experiment. Higher levels of nitric oxide and superoxide dismutase indicated lower stress in fish fed with supplementary feed compared to control group. Fish fed with supplementary feed also showed increase in lysozyme and phagocytic activity. The levels of immunoglobulin in the serum were determined by sandwich ELISA. Higher antibody production in fish fed with supplementary feeds indicated enhanced immune response. The present study highlights the potential immuno-stimulatory response of powder of F. benghalensis and L. leucocephala when supplemented in the artificial feed of C. punctata. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted to determine the effect of Sulfur (S) and Phosphorus (P) fertilizer on the growth, biomass production and wood quality of leucaena for use as a bioenergy crop at the Buriram Livestock Research and Testing Station, Pakham, Buriram province, Thailand during 2011–2013. The experiment was arranged in a split plot design with two rates of S fertilizer (0 and 187.5 kg/ha) as a main plot and five rates of P (0, 93.75, 187.5, 375 and 750 kg/ha) as a sub-plot, with four replications. The results showed that the plant height, stem diameter, total woody stem and biomass yield of leucaena were significantly increased by the application of S, while the leaf yield was not influenced by S addition. The total woody stem and biomass yield were also proportionately greatest with the maximum rate of P (750 kg/ha) application. The addition of S did not result in any significant differences in fuel properties, while the maximum rate of P application also showed the best fuel properties among the several rates of P, especially with low Mg and ash contents compared with the control (0 kg/ha). © 2016 Kasetsart University

AB  - Two pot experiments were conducted in the screenhouse of Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria, Ibadan (7° 30′ N and 3° 54′ E), southwestern Nigeria, to assess seven nitrogen-fixing shrub and tree legumes (NFTs) for their biomass production, N2-fixing potentials, and tissue nutrient concentration in two soil types. The purpose of the study was to identify an NFT that has the greatest potential for agroforestry alley cropping system and biochar production for sustainable soil productivity and crop production. The results indicated that plant growth rate, biomass production, and N2-fixing potential of the plants differed significantly with plant species but not with soil types, while the concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in plant tissues, in most cases, varied significantly with plant species, plant parts, and soil types. Total biomass was greatest for Gliricidia sepium in both Ultisol and Alfisol, whereas Acacia auriculaeformis produced the smallest biomass in both soils. Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala had the least %NdfF (percent N derived from fertilizer), 4.8 and 4.2, respectively, in the two soils, whereas Faidherbia albida and Acacia auriculaeformis had the highest %NdfF of 9.6 in the Ultisol and 7.4 in the Alfisol respectively. Significant negative correlations were established between plant biomass and %NdfF in the Ultisol (−0.888**) and Alfisol (−0.898**). Based on total biomass, shoot N concentration and %NdfF, the NFTs were ranked with Gliricidia rated highest in the two soils as having the greatest potential for alley cropping and biochar production, closely followed by Leucaena, while Acacia auriculaeformis had the lowest potential in both soil types. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Forage resources deficiency is considered one of the basic constraints to improving animal productivity in arid and semi-arid regions in Egypt. Utilization the marginal resources, i.e. saline soils and salt affected water for producing unconventional animal feed ingredients to be used when the traditional forage crops are not available or in short supplies. To achieve the aforementioned objectives, six halophytic plants were transplanted at 6 February 2014 (Atriplex nummularia, Sueada fruticosa, Lucaena leucocephala, Myoporum serratum, Artemisia monosperm and Kochia scoparia) in the model farm of National Research Centre, Al Tour, South Sinai, under drip irrigation system with saline water (EC: 8.7 dSm-1). Vegetative samples were taken 100 days after transplanting. Results showed that, these plants attained a wide range of crude protein content (CP) varying from 9.68% in Leucaena leucocephala to 13.68% in Atriplex nummularia. These halophytic plants could be considered as good fodders because of their palatability for all animal species, in addition to their moderate content of protein. Meanwhile the highest values of crude fiber (CF) amounted to 25.57% was recorded in Myoporum serratum, the highest values of Ash and ADF amounted to 30.11 and 27.36% were recorded in Kochia scoparia, the highest values of NDF amounted to 16.35% was recorded in Atriplex nummularia, the highest values of EE and NFE amounted to 4.32 and 47.02% was recorded in Sueada fruticosa respectively. On the other hand, Sueada fruticosa recorded the lowest values for CF, Ash, ADF, NDF as compared with the other plant species. These grasses are salt tolerant with high bioreproductive mass to produce ligno-cellulosic biomass of good quality (20.02–32.65% cellulose, 18.44–24.78% hemi-cellulose for ethanol production. therefore, these species –and other halophytes with similar characteristics are promising candidates for bioethanol production. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular weights (MWs) and their chemical structures are the primary factors determining the influence of condensed tannins (CTs) on animal nutrition and methane (CH4) production in ruminants. In this study the MWs of five CT fractions from Leucaena leucocephala hybrid-Rendang (LLR) were determined and the CT fractions were investigated for their effects on CH4 production and rumen fermentation. RESULTS: The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of fraction F1 (1265.8 Da), which was eluted first, was the highest, followed by those of fractions F2 (1028.6 Da), F3 (652.2 Da), F4 (562.2 Da) and F5 (469.6 Da). The total gas (mL g-1 dry matter (DM)) and CH4 production decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing MWs of the CT fractions, but there were no significant (P > 0.05) differences between the CT fractions and control on DM degradation. However, the in vitro N disappearance decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with the inclusion of CT fraction F1 (highest MW) compared with the control and other fractions (F2-F5). The inclusion of CT fraction F1 also significantly decreased (P < 0.05) total volatile fatty acid and acetic acid concentrations compared with the control. The acetic/propionic acid ratio was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) by fraction F1 but not by the control and other fractions (F2-F5). CONCLUSION: The CT fractions of different MWs from LLR could affect rumen fermentation and CH4 production, and the impact was more pronounced for the CT fraction with a higher MW. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Opening the "black box" of nodD3, nodD4 and nodD5 genes of Rhizobium tropici strain CIAT 899
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84945247182&doi=10.1186%2fs12864-015-2033-z&partnerID=40&md5=1361f2fb676d0f2b24bda1f0b974e929
AB  - Background: Transcription of nodulation genes in rhizobial species is orchestrated by the regulatory nodD gene. Rhizobium tropici strain CIAT 899 is an intriguing species in possessing features such as broad host range, high tolerance of abiotic stresses and, especially, by carrying the highest known number of nodD genes-five-and the greatest diversity of Nod factors (lipochitooligosaccharides, LCOs). Here we shed light on the roles of the multiple nodD genes of CIAT 899 by reporting, for the first time, results obtained with nodD3, nodD4 and nodD5 mutants. Methods: The three nodD mutants were built by insertion of Ω interposon. Nod factors were purified and identified by LC-MS/MS analyses. In addition, nodD1 and nodC relative gene expressions were measured by quantitative RT-PCR in the wt and derivative mutant strains. Phenotypic traits such as exopolysaccharide (EPS), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), swimming and swarming motilities, biofilm formation and indole acetid acid (IAA) production were also perfomed. All these experiments were carried out in presence of both inducers of CIAT 899, apigenin and salt. Finally, nodulation assays were evaluated in up to six different legumes, including common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Results: Phenotypic and symbiotic properties, Nod factors and gene expression of nodD3, nodD4 and nodD5 mutants were compared with those of the wild-type (WT) CIAT 899, both in the presence and in the absence of the nod-gene-inducing molecule apigenin and of saline stress. No differences between the mutants and the WT were observed in exopolysaccharide (EPS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profiles, motility, indole acetic acid (IAA) synthesis or biofilm production, either in the presence, or in the absence of inducers. Nodulation studies demonstrated the most complex regulatory system described so far, requiring from one (Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus burtii) to four (Lotus japonicus) nodD genes. Up to 38 different structures of Nod factors were detected, being higher under salt stress, except for the nodD5 mutant; in addition, a high number of structures was synthesized by the nodD4 mutant in the absence of any inducer. Probable activator (nodD3 and nodD5) or repressor roles (nodD4), possibly via nodD1 and/or nodD2, were attributed to the three nodD genes. Expression of nodC, nodD1 and each nodD studied by RT-qPCR confirmed that nodD3 is an activator of nodD1, both in the presence of apigenin and salt stress. In contrast, nodD4 might be an inducer with apigenin and a repressor under saline stress, whereas nodD5 was an inducer under both conditions. Conclusions: We report for R. tropici CIAT 899 the most complex model of regulation of nodulation genes described so far. Five nodD genes performed different roles depending on the host plant and the inducing environment. Nodulation required from one to four nodD genes, depending on the host legume. nodD3 and nodD5 were identified as activators of the nodD1 gene, whereas, for the first time, it was shown that a regulatory nodD gene-nodD4-might act as repressor or inducer, depending on the inducing environment, giving support to the hypothesis that nodD roles go beyond nodulation, in terms of responses to abiotic stresses. © 2015 del Cerro et al.

TI  - Utilization of Leucaena leucocephala in traditional fattening program of bali cattle in amarasi
PY  - 2015
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84982102696&doi=10.5398%2fmedpet.2015.38.1.64&partnerID=40&md5=0ac418e2f982d917f1d1ff2b69993dfe
AB  - This field study was aimed to evaluate the availability and the utility of forage on Bali cattle in Amarasi system in dry land area such as Kupang. Amarasi system is a fattening production system (paronisasi), which traditionally utilizes Leucaena leucocephala forage in dry season of Amarasi region. This field study was conducted during the period of July to December 2013 in Oesena and Merbaun Villages. The method used in this research was field survey. This type of survey was used to identify the forage availability and utility for Bali cattle, including determining the level of feed intake, measuring carrying capacity of both observe villages, and recording body weight of cattle. Cluster random sampling was applied in this study to determine sample used in the research, those were two villages with different altitudes, namely Oesena Village and Merbaun Village. Data were analyzed descriptively to describe the related existing conditions in the field. T-test was conducted to determine leucaena consumption and Bali cattle body weight in both villages. The results showed that during observation period, availability of leucaena forage for cattle was low based on dry matter intake 3.60 and 3.58 kg/head/day, which led to low consumption of cattle. Nevertheless, the use of leucaena in this system increased average body weight gain of Bali cattle up to 0.77 kg/day, due to high crude protein consumption. The conclusion of this study was the availability of leucaena as Bali cattle feed did not meet the cattle needs, but the use of leucaena increased the average of Bali cattle body weight gain.

AB  - The modeling of the curve of live weight per age in non-castrated male bovines under a silvopastoral system with Leucaena leucocephala during four productive cycles was evaluated. For that purpose, four genetic groups were used: Zebu, crossbred Zebu, crossbred Zebu and dairy crossbreds, with 74, 80, 90 and 90 animals, respectively. Monthly weighing was carried out in all the cycles. For deciding the goodness of fit, the following criteria were proposed: mean square of the error, fitted R2, model significance, parameter significance and graphic distribution of residues. The non-linear models (Gompertz and Logistic) were only fitted in the second and third productive cycle under the specific conditions of the study. The simple linear model showed adequate adjustments in every cycle, and showed lower values of mean square of the error than the non-linear models in the second and third cycles. There were no marked differences of liveweight increase among the four genetic groups evaluated, with daily mean gains around and superior to 0.700 kg. This indicates the need of developing specific strategies for the ending stages of male bovines under silvopastoral conditions. Further studies on modeling with higher liveweight at sacrifice of Zebu and crossbred animals are suggested, which will allow to predict the productive performance of these animals. Interpreting the results and controlling the indicators, like food balance and management, could substantially improve the indicators of liveweight at sacrifice in a silvopastoral system with leucaena and grasses.

AB  - Four tropical tree species viz., Cassia siamea, Anthocephalus cadamba, Melia dubia and Leucaena leucocephala along with Eucalyptus tereticornis were subjected to physical and chemical analysis coupled with pulping characteristic studies in order to evaluate their feasibility as alternate pulpwood. The physical and chemical analysis of wood indicated that the lignin content was moderate for all the tree species which proved their suitability as pulp wood. The tree species differ significantly in holo cellulose content which is an essential factor for paper production. Considering this factor, the superiority of Melia dubia was evidenced due to maximum holo-cellulose content when compared to all other species. The pulping results indicated that Melia dubia exhibit high pulp yield and low kappa number at similar chemical and black liquor analysis conditions. The strength properties of pulp also indicated the superiority of Melia dubia in terms of tensile, burst and tear properties. Considering all these parameters, the new species Melia dubta is found to be an ideal pulpwood for papermaking. Further, successful results with resped to pulp yield, chemical requirement, bleaching response and strength properties were also obtained during plant scale trials. Hence these studies clearly prove that Melia dubia is an ideal alternate pulpwood species amenable to high density and short rotation forestry. © 2015 Indian Pulp and Paper Technical Association.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This study was conducted to identify potential energy plants as biodiesel feedstocks atan Indonesian university campus. Plant identification and selection of the most potential oil-plant were done by purposive sampling and goal achievement methods, respectively. Some plant oil properties, i.e., seed-oil content, water content, free fatty acid content and fatty acid profile, were evaluated by laboratory analysis. It was found out that five common energy plants were identified as existing plants, i.e. Terminelia cattapa Linn, Mimusops elengi Linn, Vitex pubescens Vahl, Leucaena leucocephala Lam and Swietenia mahagoni Jacq. The seed-oil content varies from 10.83-70.19 wt%, while the water contents were in the range of 1.56 and 3.75 wt%. As for the free fatty acid content was between 1.67 and 3.64 wt%. According to the evaluation of seed and plant-oil properties, Terminelia cattapa Linn. is recommended for planting in unused space of Andalas University with the total area of approximately 9.04 ha. The planting of Terminelia cattapa Linn at the unused area together with the existing energy plants is estimated to produce 5,546.040 L year-1, oil that can potentially be converted into biodiesel. © 2015 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

TI  - Performance of goats fed on low quality veld hay supplemented with fresh spiny cactus (Opuntia megacantha) mixed with browse legumes hay in Zimbabwe

AB  - Nutrition is a major constraint in smallholder livestock production; hence, the use of alternative sources which are adaptive to long dry seasons is imperative. The study was conducted to establish options of improving nutrition and palatability and also to determine the performance of goats fed on cactus–browse hay as dry season supplements. Palatability and adequacy of nutrition was investigated using 32 castrated male goat kids. The kids were housed in individual metabolism cages for 84 days in a complete randomised design (CRD) with eight replicates for the four treatment diets. Daily experimental diet, basal diet and water intake were measured, and live mass was measured at weekly intervals. Daily diet intake was significantly different (P < 0.05) among treatments. Kids that were supplemented with cactus–Leucaena leucocephala meal (CLLM) consumed more than those on cactus–Acacia angustissima meal (CAAM), cactus–Gliricidia sepium meal (CGSM) and cactus–Pennisetum purpureum meal (CPPM) in that order. CGSM was not readily palatable as goat kids refused to take it when mixed with fresh cactus. Animals that were not supplemented with a source of nitrogen together with those that were supplemented with less palatable diet of CGSM lost weight significantly (P < 0.05) initially but gained weight slightly towards the end of the study. Significantly higher weight gains (P < 0.05) were observed in animals in CLLM and CAAM treatment. It was concluded that fresh cactus could be used to improve poor quality roughage intakes in goats, and therefore, there is need to promote its use in periods of feed deficit especially in smallholder sector. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Germination characteristics and seedbank of the alien species Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) in Brazilian forest: ecological implications
PY  - 2014
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941108801&doi=10.1111%2fwre.12107&partnerID=40&md5=8cfa54b0fb05ed2fe5691ca5033920ce
AB  - Plant species invasiveness is frequently associated with rapid proliferation and production of seeds that can persist in the soil for long periods of time. Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) is an alien and invasive species, for example in Brazilian forest and savannah ecosystems. This study quantified the invasive potential of this species by analysing its seed rain (using seed collectors), seed longevity in the soil (stored in buried bags) and the germination capacity of the soil seedbank (by collecting soil samples in the study area). Our results showed that seed rain occurred throughout the year, although more intensely from July to September, with about 5500 seeds m−2year−1 being released. The numbers of seeds in the buried bags diminished over time and intact seeds showed low germinability (approximately 15%), although their viability remained >80% of the recovered seeds after two years of in situ storage. The germinability of seeds collected directly from the soil was approximately 40%, indicating that more than half of the seeds of soil seedbank were dormant (physical dormancy). Leucaena leucocephala produces large numbers of seeds and is able to form a persistent short-lived seedbank (viability 1–5 years). These factors may contribute significantly to its invasive potential, which makes it difficult to control this species once it becomes established. As control costs become higher over time, immediate public efforts are needed to counter this threat. © 2014 European Weed Research Society

TI  - Steady state fluorescence studies of wild type recombinant cinnamoyl CoA reductase (Ll-CCRH1) and its active site mutants

AB  - Fluorescence quenching and time resolved fluorescence studies of wild type recombinant cinnamoyl CoA reductase (Ll-CCRH1), a multitryptophan protein from Leucaena leucocephala and 10 different active site mutants were carried out to investigate tryptophan environment. The enzyme showed highest affinity for feruloyl CoA (Ka =3.72×105 M-1) over other CoA esters and cinnamaldehydes, as determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. Quenching of the fluorescence by acrylamide for wild type and active site mutants was collisional with almost 100 % of the tryptophan fluorescence accessible under native condition and remained same after denaturation of protein with 6 M GdnHCl. In wild type Ll-CCRH1, the extent of quenching achieved with iodide (fa=1.0) was significantly higher than cesium ions (fa=0.33) suggesting more density of positive charge around surface of trp conformers under native conditions. Denaturation of wild type protein with 6 M GdnHCl led to significant increase in the quenching with cesium (fa=0.54), whereas quenching with iodide ion was decreased (fa=0.78), indicating reorientation of charge density around trp from positive to negative and heterogeneity in trp environment. The Stern-Volmer plots for wild type and mutants Ll-CCRH1 under native and denatured conditions, with cesium ion yielded biphasic quenching profiles. The extent of quenching for cesium and iodide ions under native and denatured conditions observed in active site mutants was significantly different from wild type Ll-CCRH1 under the same conditions. Thus, single substitution type mutations of active site residues showed heterogeneity in tryptophan microenvironment and differential degree of conformation of protein under native or denatured conditions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Increase in wedge-tailed shearwaters and changes in soil nutrients following removal of alien mammalian predators and nitrogen-fixing plants at kaena point, Hawaii
PY  - 2014

AB  - A predator-proof fence was built at Kaena Point Natural Area Reserve, Hawaii in 2010 as part of an ecosystem restoration project. All non-native mammalian predators were removed and are now excluded. Non-native plants are being removed and native species are being outplanted. We monitored abundance and reproduction of Puffinus pacificus (wedge-tailed shearwaters), collected soil samples before and after fence construction, and examined the relationship between changes in shearwater numbers and soil nutrients. Shearwater numbers increased over time, from 11 young produced in 1994 to 3,274 in 2012. The average number of shearwaters produced during the 3 years before and after fence construction increased from 614±249 to 2,359±802 (384% increase). The average number of shearwater pairs attempting to nest also increased during the same periods, from 3,265±827 to 4,726±826 (45% increase). Soil samples from 2010 to 2013 showed an overall decline in concentration of ammonium (NH4+) and no change in concentration of nitrate (NO3-) or orthophosphate (PO43-). However, there was a positive relationship between changes in shearwater numbers and changes in ammonium. Examination of spatial patterns in nutrient abundance showed that the highest nutrient concentrations occurred in areas dominated by the non-native nitrogen-fixing plants Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis pallida. Removal of these plants caused local nutrient declines, but increases in shearwater numbers have countered this at some points. We anticipate that shearwaters and other seabirds will replace non-native plants as the dominant source of nitrogen and phosphorous and facilitate recovery of a native-dominated plant assemblage. © 2014 Society for Ecological Restoration.

TI  - The co-occurrence of two pyridine alkaloids, mimosine and trigonelline, in Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2014
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901438198&doi=10.5560%2fZNC.2013-0137&partnerID=40&md5=bd6f9de8ea5a6b33542c291750fbe552
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a nitrogen-fixing tropical leguminous tree that produces two pyridine alkaloids, i. e. mimosine [β-(3-hydroxy-4-pyridon-1-yl)-L-alanine] and trigonelline (1- methylpyridinium-3-carboxylate). Mimosine has been detected in leaves, flowers, pods, seeds, and roots, and it is one of the principal non-protein amino acids that occurs in all organs. Asparagine was the most abundant amino acid in flowers. The mimosine content varied from 3.3 μmol/g fresh weight (FW) in developing flowers to 171 μmol/g FW in mature seeds. Trigonelline was also detected in leaves, flowers, pods, and seeds, but not roots. The trigonelline content was lower than that of mimosine in all organs. It varied from 0.12 μmol/g FW in developing seeds to 2.6 μmol/g FW in mature seeds. [2-14C]Nicotinic acid supplied to the developing seeds was incorporated into trigonelline but not mimosine. This indicates that the pyridine and dihydroxypyridine structures of these two alkaloids are derived from distinct precursors. The physiological functions of mimosine and trigonelline are discussed briefly. © 2014 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen.

AB  - One of the many control mechanisms of serine proteinases is their specific inhibition by protein proteinase inhibitors. An extract of Acacia schweinfurthii was screened for potential serine proteinase inhibition. It was successfully purified to homogeneity by precipitating with 80% (v/v) acetone and sequential chromatographic steps, including ion-exchange, affinity purification and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Reducing sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis conditions revealed an inhibitor (ASTI) consisting of two polypeptide chains A and B of approximate molecular weights of 16 and 10kDa, respectively, and under non-reducing conditions, 26kDa was observed. The inhibitor was shown to inhibit bovine trypsin (Ki of 3.45nM) at an approximate molar ratio of inhibitor:trypsin (1:1). The A- and B-chains revealed complete sequences of 140 and 40 amino acid residues, respectively. Sequence similarity (70%) was reported between ASTI A-chain and ACTI A-chain (Acacia confusa) using ClustalW. The B-chain produced a 76% sequence similarity between ASTI and Leucaena leucocephala trypsin inhibitor. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

TI  - Influence of the enclosed fluid on the flow over a microstructured surface in the Cassie state
PY  - 2014
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902437351&doi=10.1017%2fjfm.2013.647&partnerID=40&md5=5d4e77b8e4fc3e6356bfc55b78c76906
AB  - Analytical expressions for the flow field as well as for the effective slip length of a shear flow over a surface with periodic rectangular grooves are derived. The primary fluid is in the Cassie state with the grooves being filled with a secondary immiscible fluid. The coupling of the two fluids is reflected in a locally varying slip distribution along the fluid-fluid interface, which models the effect of the secondary fluid on the outer flow. The obtained closed-form analytical expressions for the flow field and effective slip length of the primary fluid explicitly contain the influence of the viscosities of the two fluids as well as the magnitude of the local slip, which is a function of the surface geometry. They agree well with results from numerical computations of the full geometry. The analytical expressions allow an investigationÂ of the influence of the viscous stresses inside the secondary fluid for arbitrary geometries of the rectangular grooves. For classic superhydrophobic surfaces, the deviations in the effective slip length compared to the case of inviscid gas flow are pointed out. Another important finding with respect to an accurate modelling of flow over microstructured surfaces is that not only the effective slip length, but also the local slip length of a grooved surface, is anisotropic. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Extracts of brown lead (Leucaena leucocephala) seed prepared using different extraction solvents were determined for antioxidative activities using different assays. The highest yield (3.4–4.0%) was obtained when water was used as an extraction solvent, compared with all ethanolic extracts used (1.2–2.0 %) (P < 0.05). Much lower chlorophyll content was found in the water extract. When hot water was used, the resulting extract contained lower total phenolic and mimosine contents (P < 0.05). In general, 60–80 % ethanolic extracts had higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging activities, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and metal chelating activity than water extracts (P < 0.05). When brown lead seed was dechlorophyllised prior to extraction, the water extract had slightly increased yield with lower chlorophyll content. Nevertheless, prior chlorophyll removal resulted in the increase in antioxidative activities but lower total phenolic and mimosine contents (P < 0.05). Generally, phenolic compounds and mimosine were more released when water was used as the extraction solvent, while the lower amount of chlorophyll was extracted. Oven-drying exhibited the negative effect on antioxidative activities and mimosine content. The higher antioxidative activities with concomitant higher total phenolic and mimosine contents were found in water extract dried by freeze drying. Thus, extraction solvent, dechlorophyllisation and drying methods directly influenced the yield and antioxidative activity of lead seed extract. © 2012, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).

AB  - The fabrication of single square patch antenna for proposed Leucaena Leucocephala ("Petai Belalang") Wood Plastic Composite (WPC) substrate board (PB Substrate board) and FR4 substrate board is presented in this paper. The experiment objective is to measure the performance of an antenna fabricated on the FR4 and PB substrate (proposed substrate) by comparing the performance in terms of material's dielectric constant and electron mobility and antennas' loss tangent, return loss (S11), radiation pattern and practical antenna transmitting performance. The new substrate compositions of Leucaena Leucocephala stem and polypropylene (PP) are 30% and 70% consecutively. The result for 150μm (sample B) indicates stability on most dielectric constant ("r = 3:02), loss tangent (tan±=0:029) and electron mobility (5:31£103 cm2/Vs), with the consistency of antenna result, between simulation and measurement. All results obtained will be analyzed and displayed in the form of data and graphs.

AB  - The seasonal dynamics of foliage arthropod populations are poorly studied in tropical dry forests despite the importance of these studies for understanding arthropod population responses to environmental change.We monitored the abundance, temporal distributions, and body size of arthropods in five naturalized alien and one native tree species to characterize arthropod seasonality in dry novel Prosopis-Leucaena woodlands in Puerto Rico. A branch clipping method was used monthly to sample foliage arthropod abundance over 39 mo. Seasonal patterns of rainfall and abundance within various arthropod taxa were highly variable from year to year. Abundance for most taxa did not show significant seasonality over the 3 yr, although most taxa had abundance peaks each year. However, Homoptera displayed high seasonality with significant temporal aggregations in each year. Formicidae, Orthoptera, and Coleoptera showed high variation in abundance between wet and dry periods, whereas Hemiptera were consistently more abundant in the wet period. Seasonal differences in mean abundance were found only in a few taxa on Tamarindus indica L., Bucida buceras L., Pithecellobium dulce, and (Roxburgh) Benth. Mean arthropod abundance varied among tree species, with highest numbers on Prosopis juliflora, (Swartz) De Candolle, Pi. dulce, Leucaena leucocephala, and (Lamarck) de Wit. Abundance of Araneae, Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera larvae, and all arthropods showed weak relationships with one or more climatic variables (rainfall, maximum temperature, or relative humidity). Body size of arthropods was usually largest during the dry periods. Overall, total foliage arthropod abundance showed no consistent seasonality among years, which may become a more common trend in dry forests and woodlands in the Caribbean if seasonality of rainfall becomes less predictable. © The Author 2014.

AB  - Lucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) is a valuable fodder tree, but it contains high contents of anti-nutritional factors, such as mimosine and tannins. The present study investigated the silage fermentation characteristics and ensiling effects on the degradation of mimosine and tannins of leucaena. Mimosine and tannins gradually reduced during ensiling, and sucrose and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) addition promoted their degradation. The highest degradation rate of mimosine was 49.0% in sucrose treatment and the lowest was 25.5% in the control. The highest degradation rate of tannins was 54.7% in the combined treatment of sucrose and LAB and the lowest was 40% in the control. The degradation rates of mimosine and tannins had negative correlation with the pH value and had positive correlation with lactic acid content in silage. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

TI  - Does the size of the seeds and seed pods of the invasive tree Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) affect their utilization by the biological control agent Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae)?
PY  - 2014
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84919967867&doi=10.4001%2f003.022.0412&partnerID=40&md5=346740575b47307107139ab8b516306f
AB  - The Neotropical tree Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae), which was introduced worldwide for agroforestry, has become invasive in several countries. In an attempt to reduce its invasiveness in South Africa, the seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was released in 1999 as a biological control agent. The beetle oviposits on seed pods and on loose seeds of its host. Hatching larvae burrow into the seeds to consume the contents, emerging as adults. Since L. leucocephala seeds and seed pods display considerable variation in size (i.e. resource quality) in the field, a laboratory study was conducted to determine whether size affects utilization by A. macrophthalmus. A seed-switching trial was also carried out to determine whether seed pod or seed size was the most consistent oviposition cue. The beetles displayed strong oviposition preferences for larger resources, with significantly higher egg loads on the largest seeds and seed pods. The seed-switching trials suggested that seed pod size was a more important oviposition cue than seed size. These results were verified by field surveys which revealed significant positive relationships between egg loads and seed pod size at two of the three sites surveyed. Since seed size is positively correlated with germination success and seedling fitness in leguminous plants, these oviposition patterns suggest that, in situations where dehisced seeds are utilized, A. macrophthalmus may be targeting the fittest seeds in L. leucocephala populations. This may have positive, albeit subtle, implications for biological control.

TI  - Tree legume supplementation improves mineral status of grazing does and growth performance of their kids

AB  - A total of 35 crossbred does (50% Native x 50% Anglo Nubian) were used in an on-farm trial to develop use of inexpensive mineral sources using locally available foliages (Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidium sepium) in a typical lowland-rain-fed area in villages in the Province of Pangasinan, Philippines. The animals were raised by small-holder farmers by either free-grazing or tethering without any concentrate supplementation. Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium leaves were fed to 17 does and their blood and plasma mineral levels monitored and compared to the unsupplemented group (Control) with 18 animals. Bi-monthly blood samples of the grazing does were collected through the jugular vein and forage samples from the pasture areas were taken for macro and micro mineral assay. The beneficial effect of tree-legume supplementation was manifested by higher blood Se level of does fed with Leucaena and Gliricidia than those in the Control during the rainy season but not during the dry season. Some of the animals that were lactating in the dry season had blood Se below the critical level (20 ng/ml) despite the feeding of tree-legumes. Although tree-legumes were effective in improving the Se status of the animals during the rainy season, the serious problem of feed scarcity during dry lean months resulted in subclinical symptoms of Se deficiency despite the feeding intervention. On the other hand, other plasma mineral levels were not affected by tree-legume supplementation, indicating that sulfur (S), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) contents of feed resources under this agro-climatic condition are sufficient to meet daily needs. Aside from improving the Se status, does fed with tree-legumes produced bigger kids at birth. Moreover, growth performance of their kids was better than for those kids born from does in the Control group.

TI  - Physicochemical characteristics of wood vinegars from carbonization of leucaena leucocephala, azadirachta indica, eucalyptus camaldulensis, hevea brasiliensis and dendrocalamus asper
PY  - 2014
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84923649074&partnerID=40&md5=7b96f2a779a8b584ace92a7027b0c1bc
AB  - The physicochemical characteristics were evaluated of eight wood vinegars from the carbonization of five wood species—Leucaena leucocephala (Katin), Azadirachta indica (Sadao), Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Hevea brasiliensis (rubber wood) and Dendrocalamus asper (bamboo). The vinegars were produced by heating wood samples up to 400 °C in a Thai-Iwate kiln and were compared with two commercial products. The quality assessments of all wood vinegars were determined according to criteria from the Charcoal Handbook. The results showed that all wood vinegar samples appeared to be good quality in terms of odor, color and transparency. The pH (2.9–3.5) and total soluble tar (0.325–0.963% by weight) also met the standard criteria for the pH (around 3) and total soluble tar (not more than 3%). The values of the specific gravity of only two products, from rubber wood (1.012 g.mL-1) and bamboo (1.010 g.mL-1) were within the acceptance criteria of 1.010–1.050 g.mL-1. Chemical compositions of wood vinegars as determined qualitatively by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and quantitatively by gas chromatography/flame ionized detector consisted of acetic acid as the largest component (30.45–70.60 mg.mL-1). A high number of phenol derivatives (16 compounds) were found and those in higher concentrations were 4-propyl-2-methoxyphenol (5–11 mg.mL-1) followed by 2-methylphenol (2–4 mg.mL-1). An acetic acid concentration from the eight samples whose presence was indicated by pKa at 4.7 was mainly responsible for the pH values as shown in the good correlations of plots between pH and acetic acid concentrations (Correlation coefficient, R = 0.92). The total acid contents of the ten wood vinegars as determined by titration with 0.1 N sodium hydroxide showed poor correlations with pH (R = 0.65) due to the presence of a variety of organic acids and phenolic compounds which may have affected proton transition. The specific gravity showed good correlations with total soluble tar and degree Brix (R = 0.87 for both); in turn the degree Brix showed good correlation with the total soluble tar (R = 0.87). Thus, the degree Brix which was easy to determine could be used as a general indicator of total soluble tar. The amount of total soluble tar signified the presence of phenolic compounds, of which previous studies suggested antifungal activity and usefulness as wood preservatives. Phenolic compounds were also confirmed by the ultraviolet absorption maximum (λmax) at 268–274 nm. © 2014 Kasetsart J. (Nat. Sci.). All right received.

AB  - Condensed tannins (CTs) form insoluble complexes with proteins and are able to protect them from degradation, which could lead to rumen bypass proteins. Depending on their degrees of polymerization (DP) and molecular weights, CT fractions vary in their capability to bind proteins. In this study, purified condensed tannins (CTs) from a Leucaena leucocephala hybrid were fractionated into five different molecular weight fractions. The structures of the CT fractions were investigated using 13C-NMR. The DP of the CT fractions were determined using a modified vanillin assay and their molecular weights were determined using Q-TOF LC-MS. The protein-binding affinities of the respective CT fractions were determined using a protein precipitation assay. The DP of the five CT fractions (fractions F1-F5) measured by the vanillin assay in acetic acid ranged from 4.86 to 1.56. The 13C-NMR results showed that the CT fractions possessed monomer unit structural heterogeneity. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of the different fractions were 1265.8, 1028.6, 652.2, 562.2, and 469.6 for fractions F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5, respectively. The b values representing the CT quantities needed to bind half of the maximum precipitable bovine serum albumin increased with decreasing molecular weight-from fraction F1 to fraction F5 with values of 0.216, 0.295, 0.359, 0.425, and 0.460, respectively. This indicated that higher molecular weight fractions of CTs from L. leucocephala have higher protein-binding affinities than those with lower molecular weights. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - The present investigation reports a novel thermoalkalotolerant lipase producing Basidiomycetes, Schizophyllum commune ISTL04 for the first time. Abundantly available Leucaena leucocephala seeds were exploited as a cheap fermentable source for the feasible production of extracellular lipase. The isolate ISTL04 grew vigorously on Leucaena seeds in comparison to Soybean meal and Wheat bran exhibiting a lipase activity of 146.5 U/g. The S. commune ISTL04 (SCI) lipase was purified to 35.76 folds with a specific activity of 238.13 U/mg and an estimated mass of 60 kDa. The temperature and pH optima for lipolytic activity were 60 °C and 11, respectively. The enzyme exhibited remarkable stability in the presence of non-polar and polar organic solvents (50%, v/v), retaining more than 90% and 40% activity, respectively. The lipase activity increased significantly in the presence of Mg2+ (154%), Ca2+ (109.7%), Mn2+ (106%) and Tween 80 (240%). The distinctive and broader operational properties of the SCI lipase make it a promising biocatalyst for various industrial processes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To evaluate the productive and economic performance of the feedlot of Morada Nova crossbred sheep fed different protein sources in concentrate ration to replace soybean meal this study was conducted. Three different alternatives protein sources were used replacing soybean meal: Leucaena leucocephala leaflet hay (FFL) and urea, both replacing 100%, and cottonseed cake, replacing in 51.8% (TA51,8), based on the dry matter. Was evaluated the finale weight (PF), total weight gain (GPT) and average daily gain (GMD), the number of days for the lamb gain 12kg (D12) and the economic performance of confined lambs and fed with different alternatives proteins source replacing the soybean meal. The initial body weight was similar in lambs fed different proteins sources. When analyzing the finale weight PF, GPT e GMD, could be verify that the lambs fed with TA51,8 obtained the highest values, combined with a smaller D12. Regarding economic indicators, the gain of activity in R$/kg BW (body weight) was greater in feedlot that used the TA51,8 (R$0.76/kg PC), followed by that used soybean meal (R$0.64/kg PC), urea (R$0.33/kg PC) and FFL (R$0.21/kg PC). It is concluded that cottonseed cake in replacing the soybean meal in 51.8% is the alternative food more attractive among the evaluated in this study, because it allows a greater turnover of the system, promoting a better economic viability.

AB  - Vegetation is an essential tool to reinforce soil and improve slope stability. Two legume species, lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala) and copperpod (Peltophorum pterocarpum), were tested in terms of their capacity for soil reinforcement using a modified laboratory shear box. In addition, morphological parameters of the plant and root tensile strength were measured, while root composition also was analysed. Root system significantly contributed to increase the shear strength and residual strength of soil. The soil-root matrix of both species significantly affected the cohesion but not the angle of friction. Overall effects varied with soil depth and plant species. Lead tree showed higher soil shear strength and residual strength compared to copperpod. It also exhibited higher root biomass, root length, fine roots, root tensile strength and concentration of cellulosic components in root than copperpod, indicating a higher contribution to soil-root matrix, soil shear strength and soil reinforcement. A positive correlation (r = 0.99) was observed between root biomass and soil shear strength of the species studied. Likewise, root cellulosic components and soil shear strength were positively correlated. Overall, lead tree exhibited exceptional root profiles and mechanical properties and can be the best suited plant for soil reinforcement.

AB  - By using affinity and reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) chromatographies two chymotrypsin-trypsin inhibitors were isolated from seeds of Acacia karroo, a legume of the subfamily Mimosoideae. The primary structure of one of these inhibitors, named AkCI/1, was determined. The inhibitor consists of two polypeptide chains, 139 and 44 residues respectively, which are linked by a single disulfide bridge. The amino acid sequence of AkCI/1 is homologous to and showed more than 60% sequence similarity with other protease inhibitors isolated earlier from the group of Mimosoideae. AkCI/1 inhibits both chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) and trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) in a 1:1 M ratio with Ki values of 2.8 × 10-12 M and 1.87 × 10-12 M, respectively. The P1-P1′ residues for trypsin were identified as Arg68-Ile69 by selective hydrolysis of the inhibitor at this site, with bovine trypsin and human trypsin IV. The cleavage did not affect the inhibition of trypsin, but fully abolished the chymotrypsin inhibitory activity of AkCI/1. This finding together with our studies on competition of the two enzymes for the same combining loop suggests that the same loop has to contain the binding sites for both proteases. The most likely P1 residue of AkCI/1 for chymotrypsin is Tyr67. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The generation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals in human is suggested to contribute to the wide range of pathological disturbances such as, inflammations, cancer, diabetes and arthritis. Therefore the present study was performed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of Acokanthera oppositifolia and Leucaena leucocephala. Methods:Three different solvent extractsof both plants were used in thestudy toevaluate their TPC by using Folin Coilteau reaction and flavonoid contents were determined by AlCl3 assay. The antioxidant potential was determined using four different test including metal chelation, reducing power, superoxide anion scavenging and by hydroxyl radical scavenging assay. Results:Total phenol content ranged from 7.51±.02 to 12.06±.03 mg GAEg-1 (Gallic acid equivalent) for A.oppositifoliaand13.40±.08 to 28.49±.02mg GAEg-1for L. leucocephalawhile total flavonoid ranged 0.373±0.04 to 1.325±0.08 mgQEg-1 (Quercetin equivalent) for A.oppositifoliaand 2.806±0.05 to 3.587±.003 mg QEg-1for L. leucocephala. All the extractsunder study exhibited good antioxidant activity in concentration dependent manner. Among all extracts methanolic extract of A. oppositifolia andchloroform extract of L. leucocephala exhibited better Fe2+ chelating activity with IC50 0.065 and 0.112 mg/ml respectively,Fe (III) to Fe (II) reducing capacity with IC50 0.23 and 0.42 mg/ml and superoxide anion scavengingpotential with IC500.425 and 0.675 mg/ml. In scavenging of hydroxyl radical A. oppositifolia acetone and L. leucocephala methanolic extract was most effective one with an inhibitory effect of 83.22% ±.03 and 85.47% respectively at 1.0 mg/ml (IC50 0.12 & 0.25 mg/ml). Conclusion:All the extractsA.oppositifoliaand L. leucocephalaleaves is potentiallygood source of antioxidant, which are found to be quite promising as a multipurpose medicinal agent. Phenolic and flavonoids contents are suggested to be responsible for antioxidant potential. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemical Research. All rights reserved.

TI  - Potential of tannin-rich plants for modulating ruminal microbes and ruminal fermentation in sheep
PY  - 2015

AB  - The objective of this work was to study nutritional strategies for decreasing methane production by ruminants fed tropical diets, combining in vitro and in vivo methods. The in vitro approach was used to evaluate the dose effect of condensed tannins (CT) contained in leaves of Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Manihot esculenta (39, 75, and 92 g CT/kg DM, respectively) on methane production and ruminal fermentation characteristics. Tannin-rich plants (TRP) were incubated for 24 h alone or mixed with a natural grassland hay based on Dichanthium spp. (control plant), so that proportions of TRP were 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0. Methane production, VFA concentration, and fermented OM decreased with increased proportions of TRP. Numerical differences on methane production and VFA concentration among TRP sources may be due to differences in their CT content, with greater effects for L. leucocephala and M. esculenta than for G. sepium. Independently of TRP, the response to increasing doses of CT was linear for methane production but quadratic for VFA concentration. As a result, at moderate tannin dose, methane decreased more than VFA. The in vivo trial was conducted to investigate the effect of TRP on different ruminal microbial populations. To this end, 8 rumen-cannulated sheep from 2 breeds (Texel and Blackbelly) were used in two 4 × 4 Latin square designs. Diets were fed ad libitum and were composed of the same feeds used for the in vitro trial: control plant alone or combined with pellets made from TRP leaves at 44% of the diet DM. Compared to TRP, concentration of Ruminococcus flavefaciens was greater for the control diet and concentration of Ruminococcus albus was least for the control diet. The methanogen population was greater for Texel than for Blackbelly. By contrast, TRP-containing diets did not affect protozoa or Fibrobacter succinogenes numbers. Hence, TRP showed potential for mitigating methane production by ruminants. These findings suggest that TRP fed as pellets could be used to decrease methane production. © 2015 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - The enzymatic hydrolysis of lead tree seed protein with alcalase to obtain Lead Tree Seed Hydrosylate (LTSH) was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). A threetiered, factor face centered, central composite design (CCD) was used to study the influence of four independent variables namely: pH (7-9); hydrolysis temperature (50°C, 55°C, 60°C); hydrolysis time (30 min, 60 min, 90 min); and enzyme/substrate (1%, 2%, 3%) ratio on both yield and antioxidant activity. The CCD consisted of twenty-four experimental points and six replicates of central points. All data were analyzed using Design-Expert Software. The optimum conditions obtained from experiments were a pH of 9; an enzyme to substrate ratio of 2%; a hydrolysis time of 90 min; and a temperature of 55°C. Results showed that LTSH derived from optimized hydrolysis exhibited effective ferrous ion chelating activity (92.79%) and strong reducing power (A700 = 3.82) at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. LTSH also demonstrated high DPPH radical scavenging activity (76.21%; IC50 1.99 mg/ml), as well as hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (66.72%; IC50 2.45 mg/ml). Superoxide anion scavenging activity was 55.71% (IC50 3.89 mg/ml) at 20 mg/ml. These results suggest that LTSH has potential as a natural antioxidant of functional food and for use in food processing.

AB  - Okhla Bird Sanctuary (OBS) has been well known as the home of migratory birds and most of the studies have been so far focused on bird diversity and aquatic vegetation. The present study was conducted to find out the structure and composition of terrestrial vegetation of sanctuary in two Nature trails. The total number of terrestrial plant species recorded in the study area is 106, of which 48 are trees, 9 shrubs and 49 herbs. The density of tree species were recorded in Nature Trail 1 and Nature Trail 2 had almost similar value with 7.10 and 6.68 stems per ha while density of shrub species found were 5.51 and 6.29individuals/m2. The density of herbaceous species in both the trails enumerated were 50.93 and 46.89individuals/mm2, respectively. In terms of importance value index, Leucaena leucocephala (IVI- 24.49; SDI-0.0067) was the dominant tree species in the Nature Trail 1, followed by Ficus benghalensis (IVI- 19.90; SDI- 0.0044), Ficus sp (IVI- 17.45; SDI- 0.0034) and Melia azedarach (IVI-14.35; SDI- 0.0023). In shrub layer, Tabernaemontana divaricata (IVI- 42.04; SDI- 0.0442), followed by Abutilon indicum (IVI- 39.98; SDI- 0.0400) and Lantana camara (IVI- 35.63; SDI-0.0317) were the most dominant species in Nature Trail 1. Among the herbaceous species, Cynodon dactylon (IVI- 65.9; SDI- 0.1087) was found to dominate the entire stretch of Nature trail 1, followed by Cannabis sativum (IVI- 20.8; SDI- 0.0108), Oxalis corniculata (IVI- 14.6; SDI- 0.0053) and Chenopodium album (IVI- 10.3; SDI- 0.0026). In case of basal area Nature Trail 2 was significantly higher (6.13 m2ha-1) than Nature Trail 1 (6.03 mm2ham-1).

AB  - Three forages (Adenodolichos rhomboideus, Leucaena leucocephala, and Stylosanthes guianensis) were evaluated for their chemical composition, and for both voluntary intake and apparent in vivo digestibility of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), and acid detergent fibre (ADF) as estimated by six goats (17.1 kg ± 0.7) used in a 3 × 3 double Latin square design. Forage from S. guianensis had a lower (p < 0.001) CP content than L. leucocephala forage and A. rhomboideus leaves. Fibre content (ADF and NDF) was lower (p < 0.001) in L. leucocephala (35%) forage than in A. rhomboideus (59.5%) and S. guianensis forages (56.5%). Leucaena leucocephala forage presented higher CP, ash, and ether extract levels, and higher digestibility and voluntary intake of CP. Adenodolichos rhomboideus leaves had lower (p < 0.05) apparent digestibility and intake of DM. Digestible CP content was similar for A. rhomboideus leaves and S. guianensis forage. Leucaena leucocephala appears to be the most adequate forage for goat production. Low digestibility and voluntary intake of A. rhomboideus leaves may be due to negative effect of an anti-nutritional factor such as tannin.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of suckling calves fed diets with and without legume hay. The experimental period was of 60 days, with solid food being offered ad libitum and available from the 10 th day of the life of the animal, and milk in natura restricted to 4 litres per day, divided into two equal meals. The following diets were evaluated: concentrated feed, concentrated feed and leucaena hay (Leucaena leucocephala Lam. De Wit) and concentrated feed with alfalfa hay (Medicago sativa L.). Fifteen Girolando animals were used, distributed over three treatments in an unbalanced random block design. The parameters under evaluation were: initial body weight (at birth - IBW), final body weight (FBW), average daily gain (ADG), wither height (HW), croup height (HC), thoracic perimeter (PT), dry matter intake (DMI) and feed conversion (FC). No difference was seen in animal performance in relation to the treatments, with averages of 32.9 (+2.9) kg, 67.7 (+1.2) kg, 0.58 (+0.02) kg, 13.1 (+0.5) cm, 13.7 (+0.3) cm, 20.6 (+0.7) cm, 0.46 (+0.1) and 0.79 kg (+0.1) for the parameters IBW, FBW, ADG, HW, HC, PT, DMI and FC respectively. The nutritional requirements of suckling calves are met by supplying milk and concentrated feed; there being no need to include legume hay in the diet.

TI  - A ripening associated peroxidase from papaya having a role in defense and lignification: Heterologous expression and in-silico and in-vitro experimental validation

AB  - Fruit ripening associated full length cDNA of a peroxidase from papaya was cloned and heterologously expressed. The expressed peroxidase was activated by in-vitro re-folding in the presence of hemin and calcium. The purified recombinant peroxidase exhibited broad substrate affinity in the order of o-dianisidine > pyrogallol > guaiacol and was found to be a homotetramer of 155. kDa with each subunit having a size of 38. kDa. The basis of the distinctive preferences for various substrates was investigated through in-silico molecular modeling approaches. Thus, when the modeled papaya peroxidase-heme complex was docked with these substrates, the in-silico binding efficiency was found to be in agreement with those of wet lab results with the involvement of Arg37, Phe40, His41, Pro137, Asn138, His139, His167, and Phe239 as the common interacting residues in all the cases. However, the binding of the different substrates were found to be associated with conformational changes in the peroxidase. Thus, in the case of o-dianisidine (the most efficient substrate), the protein was folded in the most compact fashion when compared to guaiacol (the least efficient substrate). Protein function annotation analyses revealed that the papaya peroxidase may have biological roles in oxidation-reduction processes, stresses, defense responses etc. In order to further validate its role in lignifications, the papaya peroxidase was compared with a lignin biosynthetic peroxidase from Leucaena leucocephala, a tree legume. Thus, based on 3D structure superimposition and docking, both peroxidases exhibited a great extent of similarity suggesting the papaya peroxidase having a role in lignification (defense response) too. The predicted functions of papaya peroxidase in defense response and lignification were further validated experimentally using qRT-PCR analyses and measurement of oxidation of coniferyl alcohol. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Land use legacy effects on structure and composition of subtropical dry forests in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands
PY  - 2014
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908658166&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2014.09.033&partnerID=40&md5=78cc7b0a1a76eee299b76372181ea759
AB  - Tropical dry forests are subject to intense human pressure and land change, including conversion to agricultural crops, pasture or agroforestry, and urban encroachment. Decades, and even centuries, of conversion, expansion, regrowth, and changing land-use practices can result in a mosaic of secondary growth patches with different land-use histories. Whereas post-agricultural landscapes may appear as contiguous areas of forest regeneration, the successional trajectory of forest patches from historic land cover to their current state may differ substantially, with consequences for species composition and ecosystem structure and function. We examined the effect of different land-use histories on current forest structure, biomass, and composition in subtropical dry forests in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. We sampled three types of secondary forests that followed different regeneration pathways after centuries of sugarcane agriculture: 40-year old secondary forests that naturally regenerated after sugarcane abandonment, 40-year old secondary forests that were reforested with timber plantations before management ceased and they were overtaken by natural succession, and 10-year old secondary forests that were intensive pasture prior to recent forest regeneration. Secondary forests that naturally regenerated after sugarcane had similar structural characteristics, in terms of basal area, stem density, aboveground biomass, and species diversity compared to secondary forests of the same age that were former plantations. Species composition, however, remained distinct. Compositional differences between the two types of 40-year old secondary forests could be partially attributed to plantation species, specifically Swietenia mahagoni, whereas naturally regenerated forests were dominated by common secondary forest species, such as Melicoccus bijugatus and Cordia alba. The effects of hurricane damage helped to explain structural similarity and compositional dissimilarity between naturally regenerated secondary forests and former plantations. Forest age had a significant effect on forest structure and composition. Differences between 10-year old and both types of 40-year old secondary forests were driven by a dominance of the nitrogen-fixing species Leucaena leucocephala, which rapidly established in 10-year old secondary forests and resulted in greater stem density and lower basal area, biomass, and species richness. Our results show that land-use history plays an important role in shaping species composition, especially in post-agricultural tropical dry forests. Although forests with differing land-use histories may structurally resemble one another within decades of abandonment, species composition may remain distinct for much longer. Understanding the legacy of human land use is important for dry forests that have a long history of disturbance and for predicting their response to future environmental change. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of the woody forage silage in the completely randomized design with six treatments and four replications. The treatments consisted of forage species: Prosopis juliflora, Mimosa tenuiflora, Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Caesalpinia ferrea. It was found that the silages jurema preta, jucá and sabiá, showed higher levels of DM more than 35 %. Leucena silage presented a higher content of CP (22.40 %) and higher pH (5.5), while the algaroba silage presented lowest level of EE (2.83 %). Higher levels of N-NH3 (10.93 %) and TDN (66.94 %) and lowest content of lignin (3.79 %) were found for gliricidia silage. Sabia silage presented a higher content of NDF (64.09%), while its ADF valor (35.54%) was similar to jurema preta silage (35.76 %). Algaroba and gliricidia silages presented highest levels of NFC (28.32 and 26.86%, respectively) and lower hemicellulose (13.39 and 12.65%, respectively). Leucena and gliricidia silages showed lower levels of cellulose with 14.77 and 15.53%, respectively. The woody forage silages studied in this work shown a good quality and can be used as sources in animal feed.

TI  - Host shift capability of a specialist seed predator of an invasive plant: Roles of competition, population genetics and plant chemistry

AB  - Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus is a seed predator that has become widely distributed along with its native host, Leucaena leucocephala (Mimosoideae), which is a neotropical leguminous tree and one of the most invasive plants worldwide. Previous studies revealed that A. macrophthalmus is able to host-shift to several mimosoid species. Here, we aim to test the host-shift potential to other mimosoid and non-mimosoid plants and possible roles of interspecific competition, genetic background, and plant chemistry in host-shift. First, we found that A. macrophthalmus predator completed development on two new hosts: pigeon pea Cajanus cajan and Cajanus scarabaeoides (Faboideae), by rearing from seeds collected in South/Southeast Asia and Hawaii. In contrast, in most regions, both Cajanus species were infested only by other beetle species. Second, we performed no-choice tests using 11 leguminous plants, covering all three subfamilies as potential hosts, including the two new hosts. A Taiwanese A. macrophthalmus population reared in the laboratory on Leucaena did not deposit eggs on any of the seeds of each tested species. To compare host-shift responses between populations, we also used a Hawaiian A. macrophthalmus population that had completed its development on freshly collected Leucaena seeds from the field. This population deposited eggs onto and hatching larvae burrowed into C. cajan seeds, although none developed beyond the larval stage. Third, the surface chemical composition of seed-pods of L. leucocephala and the two Cajanus species was dissimilar, although that of seeds was highly similar. Finally, all of the host-shifting A. macrophthalmus populations shared the same haplotypic group. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Leucaena leucocephala in ruminant nutrition

AB  - It is a common situation in extensive ruminant production systems in tropical countries to have low production indicators due to nutrient deficiencies in the diet. An economic alternative to increase animal production is the incorporation of legumes (fodder and fruits) in the diet. This review, presents an analysis of the positive and negative effects of Leucaena leucocephala consumption by ruminants, with particular emphasis on the secondary compound mimosine. Leucaena due to its high nutrient content, rumen by-pass protein supply and its possible effect on the reduction of greenhouse gas (attributed to tannins) has become one of the legumes most commonly used in ruminant feeding practices. However, in countries where leucaena has been introduced, its use is still limited to levels below 30% inclusion in the diet, due to the secondary compound mimosine and its isomers (3,4 and 2,3 DHP), which can induce toxicity, even when animals are inoculated with rumen fluid containing the bacteria Synergistes jonesii reported as responsible for degrading these compounds in the rumen. In the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, ruminants consuming leucaena can tolerate more than 50% inclusion in the diet, without having a negative impact on production, attributed intake to mimosine and its isomers. We conclude that in animals not adapted, the intake would be limited to low inclusion levels (less than 30% inclusion in the diet), mainly because of mimosine and its derivatives. The decrease in intake or diet digestibility seem to better explain the reduction in methane production, however, in vivo studies are required to clearly establish the mechanism of action. It has been reported the presence of different bacteria to S. jonessi that would have the ability to degrade mimosine and its derivatives, however, the activity of these bacteria and its effectiveness must be confirmed in vivo. © 2014, Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

TI  - Determination of tropical forage preferences using two offering methods in rabbits

AB  - Two methods of feed preference trials were compared to evaluate the acceptability of 5 fresh foliages: Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa oleifera, Portulaca oleracea, Guazuma ulmifolia, and Brosimum alicastrum that was included as control. The evaluation included chemical analyses and forage intake by rabbits. The first method was a cafeteria trial; 12 California growing rabbits aged 8 wk, allocated in individual cages, were offered the five forage plants at the same time inside the cage, while in the second trial 60 California growing rabbits aged 8 wk, allocated individually, were randomly distributed into 5 experimental groups (n = 12/group); for each group just one forage species was offered at a time. The testing period for each method lasted for 7 d, preceded by one week of adaptation. The results showed that B. alicastrum and L. lecocephala were the most preferred forages while on the contrary G. ulmifolia was the least preferred one by rabbits. The results also revealed that the CV% value for the 2nd method (16.32%), which the tested forages were presented separately to rabbits, was lower and methodologically more acceptable than such value for the 1stst method (34.28%), which all forages were presented together at the same time. It can be concluded that a range of tropical forages were consumed in acceptable quantities by rabbits, suggesting that diets based on such forages with a concentrate supplement could be used successfully for rabbit production. However, growth performance studies are still needed before recommendations could be made on appropriate ration formulations for commercial use. © 2014 by Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences.

AB  - Information on intoxication of livestock by plants in Brazil, in terms of cause, clinical signs and pathology, is compared with information on livestock poisoning by plants in South Africa. Plant poisoning, including mycotoxicosis, is considered to be one of three major causes of death in livestock in Brazil, which is one of the top beef producing countries in the world, with a cattle population of more than 200 million. Cattle production in South Africa is on a more modest scale, but with some 600 species of plants and fungi known to cause toxicity in livestock, as opposed to some 130 species in Brazil, the risk to livestock in South Africa appears to be much greater. The comparisons discussed in this communication are largely restricted to ruminants. © 2015. The Authors.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance Poisonous plants comprise the third largest category of poisons known around the world. Other than affecting the humans directly, they are the major cause of economic losses in the livestock industry since the advent of civilisation. Aim of the present study was to collect and systematically document the traditional knowledge of poisonous plants of Udhampur District for the benefit of humanity before it is entombed forever. Material and methods Direct interviews of the informants were conducted and the plants identified as poisonous by them were collected, identified and herbarium sheets were prepared. The data collected through interviews was analysed with two quantitative tools viz. The factor informant consensus and fidelity level. Results A total of 90 toxic plants were listed from the study site. Most dominant toxic families were Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Solanaceae, Apocynaceae and Euphorbiaceae. Most of the poisonous plants were herbs (57.1%) and the whole plant toxicity was reported to be the highest (32.4%) followed by leaves (23.1%). According to the factor informant consensus, gastrointestinal category had the greatest agreement closely followed by the death category. The most important species on the basis of fidelity level for gastrointestinal category were Cannabis sativa, Cassia occidentalis, Cuscuta reflexa, Euphorbia helioscopia and Euphorbia hirta, for death category were Anagalis arvensis, Embelia robusta and Prunus persica, for dermatological category Euphorbia royleana, Leucaena leucocephala, Parthenium hysterophorus and Urtica dioica, and for sexual illness category were Calotropis procera and Carica papaya. Conclusion Further phytochemical and pharmacological studies are required to ascertain the toxic components of the poisonous plants, so that they may be utilised for the betterment of future generations. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Plantations are important REDD+strategies for increasing carbon sequestration while enhancing local livelihoods. Reforestation along roads and highways under participatory forest management in southwestern Bangladesh could contribute to REDD+. This study assessed the diversity and structure of roadside plantations in order to develop a basal area based generalized allometric model for estimating above- and below-ground tree biomass carbon in Southwestern Bangladesh. All woody plants with d.b.h. ≥2cm were identified and their diameters measured in 108 systematically selected zigzag plots of equal size (2×10m). A total of 36 species in 17 families were recorded. Leguminosae accounted for 28% of species and 94% of the total estimated biomass carbon. We estimated a mean stem density of 4528ha-1, basal area of 52.6m2ha-1 and biomass carbon of 192.80Mgha-1. Samanea saman, Dalbergia sissoo, Acacia nilotica, and Leucaena leucocephala accounted for most density, basal area, and carbon. We developed and validated three allometric models with equal strength (R2 0.94-0.98) using generalized linear regression. Roadside plantations in Bangladesh can now surely participate in the UNFCCC's carbon mitigation and adaptation mechanism, but challenges to their long-term sustainability must be addressed. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The present investigation was envisaged to study the structural parameters and plant diversity of the protected and natural ecosystems of Attappady by the quantitative analysis of plant communities to provide information on the diversity status and factors responsible for degradation process. Structural features of the various plant communities of Attappady hills were studied by quadrates of 20 X 20 m size determined using species area curve method and were established in a minimum distance of 200 m along the transect made in each community. The numerical data obtained was analyzed for obtaining various diversity indices. Of the various ecosystems under protected and natural areas of Attappady, 3 randomly chosen areas namely plantations, biomass and natural forests were studied and the structural analysis of vegetation was carried out. Floristic analysis of Mulli plantation indicated the occurrence of a total 44 tree species belonging to 19 families. The vegetation analysis revealed that Albizia amara and Erythroxylum monogynum were the two natural species established well in this low rainfall habitat as indicated by their highest Importance Value Index (IVI) values. Vertical distribution of various tree species showed that there are 15 trees which are stratified in three strata in which top canopy was occupied by Albizia amara, Leucaena leucocephala, Chloroxylon swietenia and Erythroxylum monogynum. Cheerakadavu biomass depicted species characteristics of a southern tropical dry deciduous forest indicating the occurrence of a total 40 tree species belonging to 21 families. Vegetation analysis revealed that though Tarenna asiatica represented maximum density and frequency, Ficus religiosa recorded highest IVI due to highest basal area. This biomass area was represented by 16 tree species wherein the upper storey was constituted mainly by Gevotia moluccana and Anogeissus latifolia. Floristic analysis of Muthikulam natural forest indicated the occurrence of a total 42 tree species belonging to 25 families. IVI was maximum for Cullenia exarillata. Vateria macrocarpa is a rare and endemic species, which is naturally present only in the Muthikkulam forest in the whole world. Natural forests show stratification with 25-tree species, arranged in four strata. The top canopy was occupied mainly by Vateria macrocarpa and Cullenia exarillata.Thus it has been found that plantations respond positively to the protection. However, soil erosion triggered degradation process. Gap filling with most promising species like Albizia amara and Erythroxylum monogynum may be undertaken urgently. The density of various species was relatively less in Biomass areas where severe infestation of weeds affected the natural regeneration of principal species. In the case of natural forests, degradation initiated in the adjoining areas of Siruvani dam. © 2014, CESER Publications.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate, animal behavior, quality, and composition of the diet selected by cattle grazing on stargrass (Cynodon plectostachyus) in monoculture and associated with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit. and Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) in the dry tropics of Chiapas, Mexico. For this purpose, animalśbehavior was observed for 24 h. It was estimated quality as well as botanical composition of the diet selected. Data were analyzed by variance with a completely random design. Comparison of means was carried out using Tukeýs test. Non significant differences were reported for the animal behavior data (P>0.05). In the associated grassland, it was found that more time was dedicated to browsing during the dry season (P<0.05). The best diet selected, in terms of crude protein was found in the associated grassland (P<0.001), for both seasons. In this grassland, woody plants were found in the diet selected during both seasons. Nevertheless, more woody species contributed to the diet during the dry as compared to the rainy season (52.1 versus 26.9 %, respectively).

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the intake of leucaena, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, fruits and a mixture of both feeds on in vitro gas production and in vivo sheep productive performance. The experiment was conducted at the University of Yucatan, Mexico. Twenty-four Pelibuey sheep, 20.28 ± 2.99 kg average liveweight (LW), were used. Animals were randomly assigned to the following experimental treatments: T1: 100% Pennisetum purpureum, T2: 30% Leucaena leucocephala foliage + 70% P. purpureum, T3: 30% E. cyclocarpum fruits + 70% P. purpureum, T4: 30% L. leucocephala foliage + 30% E. cyclocarpum fruits + 40% P. purpureum. Voluntary intake was higher in T4 (grass + leucaena + E. cyclocarpum) (P ≤ 0.0001). Higher LW gain was observed in animals fed with T4 (P ≤ 0.0001) and the lowest LW gains were recorded with grass (T1) and grass + leucaena (T2) (78.9 and 99.2 g/day, respectively). Similarly, the feed conversion efficiency was improved with treatment T4 (P ≤ 0.0030). The in vitro gas production (48 h) was lower by 30 mL/0.5 g fermented DM in T4 compared with the other treatments (P ≤ 0.0001). Apparent DM digestibility was higher in T3 and T4 (P ≤ 0.0005). The protozoa counts were lower in T2, T3 and T4 (P ≤ 0.0001). Higher intake, digestibility and sheep performance with diets containing grass + leucaena + E. cyclocarpum mixture arise from an improved nutritional diet as these sources have higher protein, lower cell walls and higher DM digestibility. © CSIRO 2014.

AB  - Rumen fermentation and methanogenesis are vital metabolic processes in cattle and are carried out by microbial populations that are affected by dietary factors such as secondary metabolites, nutritional composition and degradability. The aim of this study was to monitor populations of total bacteria, total methanogens and Butirivibrio fibrisolvens in the rumen of Lucerne heifers fed on diets typical of intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) or of a traditional (control) system. Rumen contents (RC) were collected orally from eight heifers consuming 100% Cynodon plectostachyus (control) and 76% C. plectostachyus + 24% Leucaena leucocephala (ISS) following a crossover design and DNA was extracted and quantified by quantitative PCR. Populations [Log10 (ng g−1 RC)] were 5.6 and 5.8 for total bacteria (p = 0.5343), 3.6 and 3.5 for B. fibrisolvens (p = 0.4742) and 5.0 and 5.3 for total methanogens (p = 0.2661) respectively in control and ISS diets. However, when measured in a separate parallel study, enteric methane emissions (g kg−1 of fermented dry matter) were significantly reduced with the inclusion of L. leucocephala. This fact indicated the importance of investigating the structure, function and interactions of populations beyond quantitative analysis to determine how diet affects rumen microbial populations and their function. © 2015, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - Below ground biomass is a major determinant of soil carbon (C) storage in semi-arid ecosystem. An extended laboratory incubation study for a period of 323 days was carried out to ascertain the decomposition kinetics of fine roots of major trees (Jatropha curcas, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica and Prosopis juliflora) and a grass species (Cenchrusciliaris) in the semi-arid region of India with the hypothesis that species with a slower decomposition rate will increase stability of soil organic carbon and will have higher potential to rehabilitate degraded sites in terms of soil quality. The results were confirmed by analyzing bio-chemically stabilized carbon pool of soils under different species. Decay constant (k) for fine roots carbon ranged from 0.14 to 0.21 year−1 under different tree species and followed the order; Acacia > Jatropha > Grass- C.ciliaris > Leucaena > Azadirachta > Prosopis. Acid non-hydrolysable C (biochemically stabilized C pool) of soil was maximum in P. juliflora (1.84 g kg−1) followed by Azadirachta (1.79 g kg−1). Results emanating from the present investigation suggest that fine roots of A. indica have greater carbon stabilization potential than other species of the region. © 2014, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

AB  - The species Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) R. de Wit., known as leucaena, is originally from Central America. It has been considered a pioneer with high densities of individuals in its populations that could prevent the development of native species. The present study aims to understand the reproductive biology of L. leucocephala, synthetizing information about its reproductive success. The study was conducted in Trindade, central Brazil, from July to November 2012. All areas contained specimens in bloom. We selected four study areas containing populations of leucaena with at least six individuals with flowering. Observations were made of floral visitors and we did tests of first, second and third visit, and cross-pollination between plants, self-pollination and control group (without human intervention). There was a predominance of Apis mellifera and Trigona spinips as flower visitors in these areas. The flowers undergo senescence at the end of the day, however, there is a decrease in flower visiting by insects after 10 am. We found 342 visitors belonging to 12 insect species. After assessing the number of visits of pollinators and their influence on fruit production, we found that the number of visits of the main pollinator (A. mellifera) does not influence the production of fruits, showing the efficiency of this bee in its first visit to flowers. Leucaena leucocephala combines several attributes to be considered an invasive species, such as the efficient action of generalist pollinators as Apis mellifera, being able to produce considerable amounts of fruits and seeds that contribute to the potential dispersal and reproductive success of the plant. © 2014 by Unisinos.

AB  - Vertical gradient and soil environment are the key factors affecting mountain vegetation community structure. However little is known about the relationship between vegetation community and soil environmental factors. This paper aimed to determine the spatial distribution of vegetation community in typical area with high-frequency debris flow. SPSS principle component analysis, Pearson correlation analysis and CANOCO5.0 Two-dimensional ordination method were applied to determine the vertical gradient differentiation of the soil environmental factors and vegetation community as well as the relationship between them. The vertical zonal soil distribution rules were similar to latitude zonal distribution rules. The order from high to low was Temperate zonal soil, North subtropical zonal soil and Subtropical soil. The shrub-grassland community could be divided into three types, namely Potentilla anserina - Heteropogon contortus community, Oxalis corniculata-Artemisia dubia community and Hyparrhenia bracteata community. In the seriously degraded ecological environment caused by geological disasters and human disturbances, native arbor community was scarcely distributed. The main vegetation types of alpine zone were artificial forests composed of Pinus yunnanensis and Pinus armandii; those of subalpine zone were mixed forests of pine and cypress; and those of lower mountain belt were artificial forests composed of Eucalyptus robusta and Leucaena leucocephala. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested a significant relationship between vegetation and soil environmental factors. The results suggested that the main factors affecting the vegetation distribution in the typical area with high frequency debris flow are elevation gradient, soil organic matter, soil total phosphorus and heavy metals.

TI  - Characterization of Rhizobium grahamii extrachromosomal replicons and their transfer among rhizobia
PY  - 2014
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892174271&doi=10.1186%2f1471-2180-14-6&partnerID=40&md5=df25028c323b3f9766b08c2b998789e0
AB  - Background: Rhizobium grahamii belongs to a new phylogenetic group of rhizobia together with Rhizobium mesoamericanum and other species. R. grahamii has a broad-host-range that includes Leucaena leucocephala and Phaseolus vulgaris, although it is a poor competitor for P. vulgaris nodulation in the presence of Rhizobium etli or Rhizobium phaseoli strains. This work analyzed the genome sequence and transfer properties of R. grahamii plasmids. Results: Genome sequence was obtained from R. grahamii CCGE502 type strain isolated from Dalea leporina in Mexico. The CCGE502 genome comprises one chromosome and two extrachromosomal replicons (ERs), pRgrCCGE502a and pRgrCCGE502b. Additionally, a plasmid integrated in the CCGE502 chromosome was found. The genomic comparison of ERs from this group showed that gene content is more variable than average nucleotide identity (ANI). Well conserved nod and nif genes were found in R. grahamii and R. mesoamericanum with some differences. R. phaseoli Ch24-10 genes expressed in bacterial cells in roots were found to be conserved in pRgrCCGE502b. Regarding conjugative transfer we were unable to transfer the R. grahamii CCGE502 symbiotic plasmid and its megaplasmid to other rhizobial hosts but we could transfer the symbiotic plasmid to Agrobacterium tumefaciens with transfer dependent on homoserine lactones. Conclusion: Variable degrees of nucleotide identity and gene content conservation were found among the different R. grahamii CCGE502 replicons in comparison to R. mesoamericanum genomes. The extrachromosomal replicons from R. grahamii were more similar to those found in phylogenetically related Rhizobium species. However, limited similarities of R. grahamii CCGE502 symbiotic plasmid and megaplasmid were observed in other more distant Rhizobium species. The set of conserved genes in R. grahamii comprises some of those that are highly expressed in R. phaseoli on plant roots, suggesting that they play an important role in root colonization. © 2014 Althabegoiti et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of an intensive silvo-pastoral system (ISPS), which is based on free access to Panicum maximum and Leucaena leucocephala, on the texture profile (TP), physico-chemical properties and ripening process of the Artisanal Tepeque Cheese (ATC), and to compare it with the ATC made with milk from the traditional production system (TPS). A batch of 48 cheeses was made, from this batch, 24 cheeses were made with milk from the ISPS and 24 with milk from the TS; then they were divided into groups of six cheeses each and subjected to four periods of ripening (10, 45, 80 and 165 days). All cheeses were subjected to a texture profile analysis (TPA). A completely randomized experimental design was used in order to determine the effect of the feeding system and ripening period on the TPA. No significant differences (P>0.05) were observed for most of the parameters of the TPA but hardness, which was higher in the ISPS (P<0.01). It is envisaged that the higher hardness in ISPS cheese could be attributed to the high content of polyphenols in leucaena forage. Polyphenols can be transported to the serum and the milk and therefore to the cheese. It is hypothesized that the presence of these antioxidant compounds probably reduced the proteolysis by the endogenous micro-flora of cheese, keeping for longer time its protein matrix, which is the main barrier to cheese deforma-tion. Thus, it is suggested that the action of polyphenols resulted in a harder cheese. Significant differences (P<0,01) were observed between ripening periods as the ATC passes from a soft and sticky cheese to a hard and not sticky one. It is concluded that the ISPS has no significant effects on the overall TPA and its physico-chemical properties.

AB  - This work explored the activity of biomass pyrolyzed char on the pyrolysis and hydrogasification of Giant Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) wood. The effect of char preparation condition, as a slow or fast heating pyrolysis at three different temperatures (650, 750, or 850 °C), on carbon conversion and gas product distribution was investigated. The presence of external hydrogen (H2) had a minor effect on carbon conversion but a significant influence on the gas product distribution. The addition of H2 without pyrolyzed char favored carbon monoxide hydrogenation, followed by water-gas shift reaction and resulted in higher levels of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). In the presence of pyrolyzed char, the addition of H2 had a different effect on gas composition with an increased CH4 via the carbon-hydrogen reaction. Moreover, the slow heating pyrolysis at moderate temperature (∼750 °C) during char preparation provided the most reactive char resulting in tar reduction and increase in CH4 production. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala had been traditionally used to treat diabetes. The present study was designed to evaluate in vitro "insulin-like" activities of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) deWit. aqueous fruit extract on lipid and glucose metabolisms. The ability of the extract to stimulate adipogenesis, inhibit lipolysis, and activate radio-labeled glucose uptake was assessed using primary rat adipocytes. Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR was performed to investigate effects of the extract on expression levels of genes (protein kinases B, AKT; glucose transporter 4, GLUT4; hormone sensitive lipase, HSL; phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases, PI3KA; sterol regulatory element binding factor 1, Srebp1) involved in insulin-induced signaling pathways. L. leucocephala aqueous fruit extract stimulated moderate adipogenesis and glucose uptake into adipocytes when compared to insulin. Generally, the extract exerted a considerable level of lipolytic effect at lower concentration but decreased gradually at higher concentration. The findings concurred with RT-PCR analysis. The expressions of GLUT4 and HSL genes were upregulated by twofold and onefold, respectively, whereas AKT, PI3KA, and Srebp1 genes were downregulated. The L. leucocephala aqueous fruit extract may be potentially used as an adjuvant in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and weight management due to its enhanced glucose uptake and balanced adipogenesis and lipolysis properties. © 2014 Umah Rani Kuppusamy et al.

AB  - MYB1 transcription factor plays significant role in regulating plant secondary metabolisms. microRNA is a class of endogenous small non-coding RNA and negatively regulates gene expression by inhibiting translation of the target mRNA. In this study, MYB 1 from four plant species including Morella rubra. Orobanche ramosa, Leucaena leucocephala and Epimedium sagittatum, was investigated via bioinformatic tools and methods. We analyzed their chemical formulas, physico-chemical properties, subcellular localization, transit peptides, transmembrane domains, hydrophobicity, molecular phylogenetic tree, protein structures and predicted the upstream target regulatory miRNA. The results showed that MYB1 genes contained a 5′, 3′ untranslated region and an ORF, respectively. MYB1 proteins were hydrophobic, localized in cytoplasmic matrix with no transit peptides, and their secondary structures were mainly comprised of random coil and a-helix. 3-D models of the four MYB 1 were constructed and four upstream target regulatory miRNAs, miR159, miR5658, miR5021 and miR828, were predicted using the latest miRBase database.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the productive and reproductive performance of dual-purpose (DP) cows with a restricted concentrate allowance and access to a forage association of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and Stargrass (Cynodon nlemfuensis). Twenty-four multiparous Holstein × Zebu cows were used during the first 98 days postpartum. Treatments were control (CT): nightly grazing of Stargrass + commercial concentrate (3.97 kg dry matter [DM]/d), and Leucaena (LT): nightly grazing of Stargrass + commercial concentrate (1.97 kg DM/d) + 4 h grazing on an association of Leucaena/Stargrass. The actual time spent browsing Leucaena represented 38% of the total time of consumption. The bite rate of Leucaena was 22 5 bites/min with a bite size of 0.541 ± 0.08 g DM. The estimated intake of Leucaena per cow was 503 ± 228 g DM/d. Milk yield per cow was similar (P > 0.05) between treatments (CT = 12.28 ± 0.6 kg/d, LT = 11.97 ± 0.6, TL = 11.9 0.6) with a similar composition (P > 0.05). There were no differences (P > 0.05) between treatments for changes in live weight (CT-29.6 kg, LT-33.3 kg) and body condition (CT-1.3, LT-1.4, in a 1-9 scale). Population of ovarian follicles per cow was similar between treatments throughout the experiment. Pregnancy rate was 33% for CT and 25% for LT, with no significant differences (P > 0.05). Grazing an association of Leucaena and Stargrass can replace part of the concentrate without detrimental effects on production and reproduction in DP cows. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - This study explores the chemical composition, buffer N solubility, in vitro ruminal N degradability and in vitro ruminal biological activity of tannins in leaves from Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Morus alba and Trichanthera gigantea trees. These tree leaves are a potential protein source for ruminants, but their site-influenced nutritive value is largely unknown. Leucaena leucocephala leaves had the highest N content (42.1 g/kg DM), while T. gigantea leaves had the least (26.1 g/kg DM). Leucaena leucocephala had the highest buffer solubility index (20%), while 10% of the total N in leaves of the other three species was soluble. The rapidly fermentable N fraction 'a' was highest in M. alba leaves (734.9 g/kg DM) and least in T. gigantea leaves (139.5 g/kg DM). The rate of fermentation (c) was highest for M. alba (7%/hours) leaves. No significant correlations were recorded between buffer solubility index of N and in vitro ruminal N degradability parameters: a, b, and c. The highest response to tannin inactivation using polyethylene glycol, in terms of percentage increase in 36-hours cumulative gas production, was recorded in M. alba (39%) and T. gigantea (38%) leaves. It was concluded that buffer solubility of N is not a good indicator of ruminal N degradation in the leaves of these tree species. Leaves of M. alba could be more valuable as a source of rapidly fermentable N when animals are offered low-protein, high-fibre diets compared with other tree species evaluated in the current study. However, when feeding M. alba leaves, the role of tannins must be considered because these secondary plant compounds showed significant in vitro ruminal biological activity. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

TI  - Layers of air in the water beneath the floating fern salvinia are exposed to fluctuations in pressure

AB  - Superhydrophobic, hierarchically structured, technical surfaces (Lotus-effect) are of high scientific and economic interest because of their remarkable properties. Recently, the immense potential of air-retaining superhydrophobic surfaces, for example, for low-friction transport of fluids and drag-reducing coatings of ships has begun to be explored. A major problem of superhydrophobic surfaces mimicking the Lotus-effect is the limited persistence of the air retained, especially under rough conditions of flow. However, there are a variety of floating or diving plant and animal species that possess air-retaining surfaces optimized for durable water-repellency (Salvinia-effect). Especially floating ferns of the genus Salvinia have evolved superhydrophobic surfaces capable of maintaining layers of air for months. Apart from maintaining stability under water, the layer of air has to withstand the stresses of water pressure (up to 2.5 bars). Both of these aspects have an application to create permanent air layers on ships' hulls. We investigated the effect of pressure on air layers in a pressure cell and exposed the air layer to pressures of up to 6 bars. We investigated the suppression of the air layer at increasing pressures as well as its restoration during decreases in pressure. Three of the four examined Salvinia species are capable of maintaining air layers at pressures relevant to the conditions applying to ships' hulls. High volumes of air per surface area are advantageous for retaining at least a partial Cassie-Baxter-state under pressure, which also helps in restoring the air layer after depressurization. Closed-loop structures such as the baskets at the top of the "egg-beater hairs" (see main text) also help return the air layer to its original level at the tip of the hairs by trapping air bubbles. © 2014 The Author.

AB  - Fine root is critical to restrain soil erosion and its distribution pattern is of great influence on the restraining effects. This study studied the fine root biomass (Br) distribution of different aged Leucaena leucocephala (5, 10, 15 years) in debris flow source area in Jiangjia Gully by digging downward to the bottom at different distances to stem in three directions on slope. The results showed the Br increased dramatically by 143% from 5 years to 10 years and then rose slowly by 38% from 10 years to 15 years. The Br of 5 years was significantly asymmetric between uphill and alonghill directions, but there was little difference among directions for other ages, and a concentration trend appeared to exist in downhill and alonghill directions. Moreover, fine root (D≤1 mm) was significantly heavier than that of fine root (1mm<D≤2 mm), playing a leading role in the vertical distribution of the whole fine root, with a logarithmic or an exponential function. The results presented may shed light on fine root distribution pattern and evaluation of its effect on slope stability in debris flow source area. © 2014 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Vermicompost was prepared from leaf materials of Gliricidia sepium + Cassia auriculata + Leucaena leucocephala with cow dung (1: 1: 2) using Eudrilus eugeniae (Kinberg) and Eisenia fetida for 60 days. Nineteen bacterial strains which have the capability to fix nitrogen, solubilize inorganic phosphate, and produce phytohormones were isolated from vermicompost, vermisources, and earthworm (fore, mid, and hind) guts and tested for plant growth studies. Among the bacterial strains only five strains had both activities; among the five Bacillus spp. showed more nitrogen fixing activity and Pseudomonas spp. showed more phosphate solubilizing activity. Hence these bacterial strains were selected for further molecular analysis and identified Bacillus cereus GGBSTD1 and Pseudomonas spp. GGBSTD3. Plant growth studies use these two organisms separately and as consortium (Bacillus cereus + Pseudomonas spp.) in (1: 1) ratio at different concentrations using Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. at different day intervals. The germination percent, shoot length, root length, leaf area, chlorophyll a content of the leaves, chlorophyll b content of the leaves, total chlorophyll content of the leaves, fresh weight of the whole plant, and dry weight of the whole plant were significantly enhanced by the consortium (Bacillus cereus + Pseudomonas spp.) of two organisms at 5 mL concentrations on the 15th day compared to others.  © 2014 Balayogan Sivasankari and Marimuthu Anandharaj.

AB  - Many insect pests have crossed over the geographical boundaries and became cosmopolitan in distribution through anthropogenic migration and import and export of the comestible consignments. Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchidae) a recently reported well known pest of Leucaena leucocephala (Lamark) de Wit (Fabaceae) from Indian subcontinent has been studied for life history traits under laboratory conditions. Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus utilizes aphagously developing and developed seeds for oviposition and larval development. Eggs were laid either on the pod surface, over a seed, or directly on exposed seeds. Female laid an average of 38.3±8.01 eggs and produced 27.4±6.77 offsprings. Larvae grew and molted inside the host seed and adult bruchid emerged out after cutting a circular window in testa of the seed and pod as the case may be. Total development was completed in 41.6±7.18 days and newly emerged insects became sexually mature after one hour of emergence. All the four larval instars were studied Scanning Electron Microscopically (SEM) and head, antenna, clypeolabial complex, leg etc., were described separately and taxonomically important structure like setae, sensillae trichodea, microtrichia etc., beared by integumentry system were projected accordingly. © 2015 Academic Journals Inc.

AB  - Plant helps to stabilize the masses of soil via hydrological and mechanical means. The effects of vegetation on soil depend on the overall root growth, architecture and its hydro-mechanical functions. Three leguminous plants, Leucaena leucocephala, Pterocarpus indicus and Peltophorum pterocarpum were evaluated in terms of their hydro-mechanical characteristics and root architecture for soil reinforcement. The results show that L. leucocephala exhibited the highest hydrological properties such as diurnal transpiration, water absorption capacity and soil matric suction (SMS). Regarding mechanical characteristics, L. leucocephala exhibited the highest root tensile strength and cellulosic components in the root. Interestingly, L. leucocephala also showed a higher root length, volume and tips than Pterocarpus indicus and Peltophorum pterocarpum. The SMS was strongly (r = 0.79) correlated with leaf area index (LAI), indicating that high LAI improved SMS. In conjunction with the cellulosic composition, root tensile strength of the species studied was highly correlated with the alpha-cellulose content (r = 0.9) and showed that high alpha-cellulose content of roots improved mechanical properties of plants to provide reinforcement in the soil. The highroot tensile strength, root cellulosic composition and VH-type root of L. leucocephala make the species special for growing as a soil reinforcing plant. In conclusion, L. leucocephala properties revealed that it possessed excellent hydro-mechanical properties and root architecture and can be planted on slopes for soil reinforcement.

PY  - 2014

AB  - Land degradation and soil deterioration are key environmental problems in the savanna of southwestern China. Restoration programs require scientific information about tree species that represent the best options for rehabilitating degraded lands and about the responses of key edaphic constraints to these tree species. Five plantations (Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia kalkora, Acacia auriculiformis, Azadirachta indica and Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and one self-repair treatment were established to restore a degraded savanna, and soil properties associated with these treatments were investigated four times during 22. years of vegetation restoration.The results showed that treatment and sampling time have significant effects on the soil properties of the degraded savanna following vegetation restoration. Soil physical properties improved slowly relative to its microbial and chemical properties. After 22. years of vegetation restoration, soil amelioration via self-repair mechanisms was more successful than via the planting of A kalkora, A indica and E camaldulensis but was inferior to or close to the planting of L leucocephala and A auriculiformis.The tree species control the soil amelioration process in the degraded savanna. The manual restoration of vegetation (i.e., afforestation) could not always accelerate soil amelioration relative to natural restoration (i.e., self-repair) in the savanna. L leucocephala and A auriculiformis are recommended as pioneer trees for soil amelioration of the degraded savanna. The cost-free self-repair of the degraded savanna is also a recommended approach to soil amelioration. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Leucaena leucocephala is native to Southern Mexico and Northern Central America, but is now naturalized throughout the tropics. The phyto-chemical data of L. leucocephala revealed the presence of terpenes, flavonoids, coumarins and sterols. Various parts of L. leucocephala have been reported to have medicinal properties. Materials and Methods: Flavonoids were isolated from the aerial parts of L. leucocephala. Antioxidant activity of the extracts and the isolated compounds was evaluated using (DPPH), as well as their cytotoxic activity using a single tumor [Ehrlish ascites carcinoma cells]. Results: The flavonoidal constituents isolated from chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions of the aqueous alcoholic extract of aerial parts of Leucaena leucocephala were identified as Caffeic acid, Isorhamnetin, Chrysoeriol, Isorhamnetin 3-O-galactoside, Kaempferol-3-O-rubinoside, Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside and Luteolin-7-glucoside. Chemical structures of the isolated compounds were identified by TLC, PC and spectral techniques (UV,1 H-NMR and MS). The ethyl acetate fraction and the isolated flavonoidal compounds showed high antioxidant activity compared to Trolox (standard antioxidant compound). The different fractions and isolated compounds of Leucaena leucocephala exhibited no cytotoxic activity against Ehrlichascitis carcinoma cell line at the tested concentrations. Conclusion: This is the first record of the flavonoids in the aerial parts of Leucaena leucocephala (L.) except Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside. © 2014, African Traditional, Herbal Medicine Supporters Initiative.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether the inoculation of plant growthpromoting bacteria to plants, vegetated in soil irrigated with textile effluent, influences plant biomass production, and soil remediation. Three different plant species (Acacia ampliceps, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, and Leucaena leucocephala) with and without bacterial inoculation were grown in soil irrigated with secondary treated textile wastewater for one year. An endophytic bacterium, Burkholderia sp. strain PsJN, possessing plant growthpromoting 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity was inoculated to plants. There was more plant biomass production (up to 12%) and contaminants removal (up to 29%) from soil with bacterial inoculation as compared to soil having noninoculated plants. Enhanced plant growth and soil remediation activity are associated with the survival and colonization of the inoculated bacterium in the rhizosphere and endosphere of plants. The highest plant biomass production and contaminants removal from soil were observed in the treatment, in which A. ampliceps was inoculated with Burkholderia sp. strain PsJN. These results suggest that plant-bacteria partnerships can be applied to improve plant growth and soil remediation during the application of industrial effluent for plant biomass production in the arid regions. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Pot experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions to evaluate the impacts of salinity and drought stress on the growth and symbiosis of seedlings of Acacia gerrardii subsp. negevensis. Rhizobium isolates KSA5, KSA6 and KSA8 were obtained from root nodules of Acacia ampliceps (Maslin), Acacia tortilis subsp. tortilis (Forssk.) and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) grown in the Dirab Valley south of Riyadh City in Saudi Arabia. The seed of Acacia gerrardii subsp. negevensis was obtained from Al Marbaa Park at Asser region South of Kingdom and planted in greenhouse of the Range and Forestry Applied Research Unit at Experimental Station of Faculty of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Tolerance to temperature, pH and salt were assessed for each isolate. The results showed that the Rhizobia isolates tolerated temperatures of up to 30°C and grew at pH 5.5 to 8.5 as well as in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl up to 2% w/v. Salinity and drought stress had negative effects on seedlings growth but even stronger negative impacts on nodulation. Under these stresses, the isolates were able to modify the nodules on the roots of A. gerrardii subsp. negevensis, but this ability declined as salinity increased and drought progressed. Rhizobium isolate KSA5 was a superior competitor in its ability to cope with these stresses compared with isolates KSA6 and KSA8. Hence, it can be concluded that inoculating seedlings with indigenous Rhizobium isolates may improve the tolerance of Acacia gerrardii subsp. negevensis seedlings to salinity and drought stress in the nursery stage.

TI  - Phenotypic, molecular and symbiotic characterization of the rhizobial symbionts of Desmanthus paspalaceus (Lindm.) burkart that grow in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina
PY  - 2014

AB  - Desmanthus paspalaceus (Lindm.) Burkart belongs to the D. virgatus complex, subfamily Mimosoidae. The known potential as livestock fodder of several of these legumes prompted us to undertake a phenotypic, molecular, and symbiotic characterization of the D. paspalaceus symbionts in the Santa Fe province, Argentina. The rhizobia collected - containing isolates with different abiotic-stress tolerances - showed a remarkable genetic diversity by PCR fingerprinting, with 11 different amplification profiles present among 20 isolates. In selected isolates 16S-rDNA sequencing detected mesorhizobia (60%) and rhizobia (40%) within the collection, in contrast to the genus of the original inoculant strain CB3126 - previously isolated from Leucaena leucocephala - that we typified here through its 16S rDNA as Sinorhizobium terangae. The results revealed the establishment by diverse bacterial genera -rhizobia, sinorhizobia, and mesorhizobia- of full N2-fixing symbiotic associations with D. paspalaceus. This diversity was paralleled by the presence of at least two different nodC allelic variants. The identical nodC alleles of the Mesorhizobia sp. 10.L.4.2 and 10.L.5.3 notably failed to group within any of the currently described rhizo-/brady-/azorhizobial nodC clades. Interestingly, the nodC from S. terangae CB3126 clustered close to homologs from common bean nodulating rhizobia, but not with the nodC from S. terangae WSM1721 that nodulates Acacia. No previous data were available on nod-gene phylogeny for Desmanthus symbionts. A field assay indicated that inoculation of D. paspalaceus with the local Rhizobium sp. 10L.11.4 produced higher aerial-plant dry weights compared to S. teranga CB3126-inoculated plants. Neither the mesorhizobia 10.L.4.2 or 10.L.5.3 nor the rhizobium 10L.11.4 induced root nodules in L. leucocephala or P. vulgaris. The results show that some of the local isolates have remarkable tolerances to several abiotic stresses including acidity, salt, and temperature; while exhibiting prominent N2 fixation; thus indicating suitability as candidates for inoculation of D. paspalaceus. © 2014 Fornasero et al.

AB  - This experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of including either Leucaena leucocephala (LLM) or Moringa oleifera leaf meal (MOLM) as tropical feed resources at two levels (30 or 40 %) on growth performance, carcass traits, and economical efficiency of growing rabbits. A total of 60 California growing rabbits were randomly distributed into five experimental groups, each consisting of 12 rabbits and were allocated individually; the groups were control, 30 % LLM, 40 % LLM, 30 % MOLM, and 40 % MOLM. The experimental period lasted from 6 to 12 weeks of age. The results showed that rabbits fed control and 30 % MOLM diets had significantly the highest final body weight and daily weight gain being 2,040 and 2,000 g and 31.6 and 30.6 g/day, respectively. Similarly, the best feed conversion ratio was associated with 30 % MOLM and control groups (3.2 and 3.4), while the worst value was for 40 % LLM group (5.2). MOLM treatments recorded significantly the highest dressing percentage along with control group. The inclusion of MOLM by 30 and 40 % improved the economical efficiency (2 and 1.5) in comparison with the control group (1.1). The results suggest that MOLM can be included in growing rabbit diets up to 40 % without any adverse effect on growth performance or carcass traits with higher economical efficiency of growing rabbits. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Effects of Reduced Soybean-Meal Diets Containing Moringa oleifera or Leucaena leucocephala Leaf Meals on Growth Performance, Plasma Lysozyme, and Total Intestinal Proteolytic Enzyme Activity of Juvenile Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, in Outdoor Tanks
PY  - 2014

AB  - Leaf meals are potential alternatives to soybean meal (SBM) in fish diets in developing countries because they are cheaper. Moringa oleifera (MOR) and Leucaena leucocephala (LEU) reduced nutrient digestibility of diets compared with SBM in an earlier study. However, fish raised outdoors consume natural foods, which might offset the negative effects of leaf-meal diets. We conducted a feeding trial using mixed-sex Nile tilapia (5.2g) to assess performance of fish fed 36% protein diets with different concentrations of MOR and LEU leaf meals in place of SBM. Fish in static pools were fed daily to apparent satiation for 59d. Individual weight gain (30.4-34.7g), survival (91.8-97.3%), feed conversion ratio (FCR, 1.6-1.9), proximate composition, plasma lysozyme activity, and intestinal proteolytic enzyme activity were similar among diets. However, fish fed diets containing leaf meals had higher concentrations of n-3 fatty acids than those fed the SBM control. Despite lower nutrient availability of the leaf-meal diets compared with the soy diet, MOR or LEU could replace up to 30% of the SBM protein without reducing fish performance. Inclusion of poultry meal in the diets and probable nutrient supplementation from natural foods appeared to compensate for the lower nutritional value of the leaf meals compared with SBM. © by the World Aquaculture Society 2014.

TI  - An O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase from leucaena Leucocephala is a cysteine synthase but not a mimosine synthase

AB  - In plants, the final step of cysteine formation is catalyzed by O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OAS-TL). The purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize an OAS-TL from the tree legume Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena). Leucaena contains a toxic, nonprotein amino acid, mimosine, which is also formed by an OAS-TL, and characterization of this enzyme is essential for developing a mimosine-free leucaena for its use as a protein-rich fodder. The cDNA for a cytosolic leucaena OAS-TL isoform was obtained through interspecies suppression subtractive hybridization. A 40-kDa recombinant protein was purified from Escherichia coli and used in enzyme activity assays where it was found to synthesize only cysteine. The enzyme followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the K m was calculated to be 1,850±414 μM sulfide and the V max was 200.6±19.92 μM cysteine min-1. The N-terminal affinity His-tag was cleaved from the recombinant OAS-TL to eliminate its possible interference in binding with the substrate, 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone, for mimosine formation. The His-tag-cleaved OAS-TL was again observed to catalyze the formation of cysteine but not mimosine. Thus, the cytosolic OAS-TL from leucaena used in this study is specific for only cysteine synthesis and is different from previously reported OAS-TLs that also function as β-substituted alanine synthases. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - The guaje (Leucaena spp.), a leguminous plant with edible seeds, is a traditional resource underutilized by Mesoamerican peoples. The nutritional and nutraceutical value of the guaje is unknown despite being consumed by rural people today in mainly central and southern Mexico. The aim of this study was to assess the mineral, nutritional and antioxidant contents of the red guaje (L. esculenta Benth.) and green guaje (L. leucocephala Lam.) in order to contribute to a reevaluation of their food properties. Their anthocyanin, flavonoid, total phenol, and tannin contents, as well as their antioxidant activity and proximate and mineral composition, were quantified. Red guaje seeds outperformed green guaje ones in N, Mg, Mn, P and Zn contents; by contrast, green guaje seeds had higher Na and Fe levels. Crude fiber content was 10.55 and 10.07 % in red and green guaje, respectively, while protein content was 33.12 % and 31.7 %, respectively. The high content of phenolic compounds was greater in the fresh red guaje seeds (1,088.70 mg gallic acid equivalents [GAE]•100 g-1 FW) than in the green ones (969.09 mg GAE•100 g-1 FW), but the latter had a greater amount of tannins. The high free radical scavenging activity (97.22 to 98.11 %) obtained by the ABTS (2.2 '-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid) method may be associated with the content of phenolic compounds. In conclusion, guaje seeds could be considered as a functional food, but mainly the red guaje ones due to their nutritional quality and higher antioxidant activity.

TI  - Biological effect of tannins from different vegetal origin on microbial and fermentation traits in vitro

AB  - The biological effect of tannins (proportion of the response in different parameters when tannins were inactivated with polyethylene glycol, PEG) as an easy, rapid way to estimate the magnitude of their effect on rumen microbial fermentation, was estimated in vitro for the tropical browse legumes Albizia lebbekoides, Acacia cornigera and Leucaena leucocephala, which differ in their phenolic and tannin content. Samples were incubated in rumen fluid for 24 h in four runs. The inactivation by PEG of tannins from A. lebbekoides increased gas production from 1.62-to 2.83-fold, with this biological effect increasing up to 8 h incubation, then being maintained and increasing after 16 h. In A. cornigera and L. leucocephala, the magnitude of the improvement of gas production was lower (from 1.1-to 1.32-fold and from 1.29-to 1.56-fold) and constant. The inclusion of PEG increased total volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration (P ≤ 0.019), reduced the molar proportion of acetate (P < 0.001) and increased that of butyrate (P < 0.001) and branched-chain VFA (P < 0.001). Microbial protein mass in A. lebbekoides increased with PEG in a higher extent (P < 0.001) than in L. leucocephala, but it was reduced in A. cornigera. No biological effect was observed on the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis when it was related to VFA concentration (P > 0.10), but when related to the gas produced it was lowest with A. lebbekoides (P ≤ 0.023). The biological effect of tannins, either in total extent or along the incubation period differed according to their origin. Irrespective of their amount or chemical nature, the biological effect gives a direct idea of how tannins affect both the extent and pattern of forages fermentation. © 2014 CSIRO.

AB  - The study investigated the physical, chemical and combustion properties of wood pellets from forest residues. Wood shavings from mixed Dipterocarpaceae species and branch wood of Gmelina arborea and Leucaena leucocephala were used as feedstock. Ultimate, proximate, elemental and combustion analyses were performed to assess pellet quality in accordance with DIN 51731 (1996) for compressed solid fuel. In general, forest biomass used in this study formed pellets that were homogenous with uniform size and shape. Moisture content, particle density, bulk density and abrasion resistance were all within guiding values of the standard. Pellet samples used in this study showed relatively low levels of ash forming elements and heavy metals with calorific values suitable for industrial and residential heating applications. Combustion analyses of pellets from shavings and branch wood also showed that these materials burned freely and continuously while maintaining their integrity during the burning cycle. Low levels of pollutant emissions were detected when pellets were burned from biomass samples used in this study. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - The silvopastoral system (SPS) has been suggested to ensure sustainability in animal production systems in tropical ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate pasture characteristics, herbage intake, grazing activity and milk yield of Holstein×Zebu cows managed in two grazing systems (treatments): SPS dominated by a graminaceous forage (Brachiaria decumbens) intercropped with different leguminous herbaceous forages (Stylosanthes spp., Pueraria phaseoloides and Calopogonium mucunoides) and legume trees (Acacia mangium, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala), and open pasture (OP) of B. decumbens intercropped only with Stylosanthes spp. Pastures were managed according to the rules for organic cattle production. The study was carried out by following a switch back format with 12 cows, 6 for each treatment, over 3 experimental years. Herbage mass was similar (P>0.05) for both treatments, supporting an average stocking rate of 1.23 AU/ha. Daily dry matter intake did not vary (P>0.05) between treatments (average of 11.3±1.02 kg/cow per day, corresponding to 2.23±0.2% BW). Milk yield was higher (P<0.05; 10.4±0.06 kg/cow per day) in the SPS than in the OP (9.5±0.06 kg/cow per day) during the 1st year, but did not significantly differ (P>0.05) in subsequent years. The highest (P<0.05) values for herbage mass and milk yield were observed during the 3rd year. In the SPS, with moderate shade (19% shade relative to a full-sun condition), the grass CP was higher (P<0.05) than in the OP, although the NDF content and digestibility coefficient were not modified. The animals spent more time (P<0.05) idling in the SPS than in OP. The higher legume proportion in the SPS was associated with the higher CP level in B. decumbens relative to the OP, which could explain the better (P<0.05) performance of the cows in silvopastoral areas during the 1st year. However, during the 2 nd and 3rd years, similarities in the legume percentages of both systems resulted in similar (P>0.05) milk yields. Low persistence of Stylosanthes guianensis was observed over the experimental period, indicating that the persistence of forage legumes under grazing could be improved using adapted cultivars that have higher annual seed production. The SPS and a diversified botanical composition of the pasture using legume species mixed with grasses are recommended for organic milk production. © The Animal Consortium 2014.

AB  - Laccase from a tree legume, Leucaena leucocephala, was purified to homogeneity using a quick two-step procedure: alginate bead entrapment and celite adsorption chromatography. Laccase was purified 110.6-fold with an overall recovery of 51.0% and a specific activity of 58.5 units/mg. The purified laccase was found to be a heterodimer (∼220 kDa), containing two subunits of 100 and 120 kDa. The affinity of laccase was found to be highest for catechol and lowest for hydroquinone, however, highest Kcat and K cat/Km were obtained for hydroquinone. Purified laccase exhibited pH and temperature optima of 7.0 and 80 °C, respectively. Mn 2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Cu2+ and Na + activated laccase while Ca2+ treatment increased laccase activity up to 3 mM, beyond which it inhibited laccase. Co2+, Hg2+, DTT, SDS and EDTA showed an inhibition of laccase activity. The Leucaena laccase was found to be fairly tolerant to organic solvents; upon exposure for 1 h individually to 50% (v/v) each of ethanol, DMF, DMSO and benzene, more than 50% of the activity was retained, while in the presence of 50% (v/v) each of methanol, isopropanol and chloroform, a 40% residual activity was observed. The purified laccase efficiently decolorized synthetic dyes such as indigocarmine and congo red in the absence of any redox mediator. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hays of graminaceous species (I. cylindrica and S. palidefusca) of low quality (30g/kg dry matter (DM) Crude Protein (CP) was offered to 16 goats (8 males, 8 females), alone or with one of three tropical leguminous plants (153g/kg, 104g/kg and 305,6g/kg DM respectively). The supplementation increased total DM, energy and CP intakes and consequently allowed the weight of the goats to increase. The fodder of L. leucocephala gave the best results, while that of S. guianensis gave the lowest.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) has been recently reported as a host plant of the polyphagous whitefly Bemisia tabaci(Gennadius) from India. A study was carried out on the population dynamics of this whitefly on leucaena for two years and it revealed that its populations reached a peak (121.58 and 134.83 adults per two leaves) in September. The spatial distribution pattern revealed that it is always an aggregated dispersion (Taylor's Power Law) in all the strata but more aggregation in the middle leaves (b = 3.123). Linear association between population and weather factors revealed that maximum and minimum temperature had a significant positive correlation (r = 0.60, 0.54). The sex ratio in the field varied from 1:1.9 to 1:4.9 (male: female).The present observations indicate that incidence of B. tabaci on L. leucocephala, is an adaptation to a suitable host so as to survive during the winter season when the lowest temperature is about 2-4̊C.

AB  - In recent years, the tropical coastal forest of the Siangjiaowan Ecological Reserve has been severely invaded by shade-intolerant species and Leucaena leucocephala due to road construction which created adverse edge effects along the forest. In addition, many valuable tree species lack new recruits. The composition and structure of this forest are dramatically altered compared to those 40 yr ago. To understand the current status of this coastal forest, we established a 1.55-ha sampling plot (300 m long, 40∼60 m wide) in the forest in January 2012. Each individual of a woody species was identifed and tagged, and its height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and location were recorded. In total, 1765 trees ha-1 belonging to 58 species with a DBH of ≥ 1 cm were recorded; among them, Aglaia formosana and Macaranga tanarius had the highest species abundances. For trees with a DBH of < 1 cm, a total of 3023 stems ha-1 belonging to 53 woody species was recorded, with 934 stems belonging to Agl. formosana. Among the 58 species with individuals with a DBH of ≥ 1 cm, e.g., Hernandia nymphiifolia and Barringtonia asiatica, most of them appeared to have a fuctuating diameter structure, indicating that many disturbance events had occurred during their regeneration process. Sorted by the Importance Value Index (IVI) of this stand, Bar. asiatica and Her. nymphiifolia were listed as nos. 1 and 3. However, Mac. tanarius and Melanolepis multiglandulosa, both very shade-intolerant species, were nos. 2 and 6 in the IVI. Furthermore, Mac. tanarius and Leu. leucocephala rapidly occupy tree-fall gaps created by disturbances from typhoons. From 1974 to 2012, species abundances of Her. nymphiifolia and Bar. asiatica were respectively reduced by 31 and 21%, and those of Murraya paniculata and Morinda citrifolia were reduced 51 and 55%, while those of Mac. tanarius and Mel. multiglandulosa increased 56-and-4 fold. The leaf area index of this tropical forest decreased from 3.96 to 1.73 after 2 typhoons hit in August 2012, but had rebounded to 3.02 in only 75 d after the second typhoon. Preliminary ecological restoration efforts of this forest were initiated in July 2012. We reduced the density of 3 invasive shade-intolerant species in a wind-disturbed site and planted Bar. asiatica and other native species of this coastal forest, in an effort to improve the stand structure of this tropical coastal forest.

AB  - Abundance, richness and composition of the community of the litter macro-fauna were preliminarily characterized, with emphasis on the Coleoptera order, in an agro-forested system with a silvopastoral management and association of the tree leguminous Leucaena leucocephala and the grass Megathyrsus maximus, and in another system of grassland, only with M. maximus. Both were located in San José de las Lajas, Mayabeque province. The study was carried out during the rainy periods of 2009 and 2010, in June and October, respectively. The epigeous macro-fauna was collected with pitfall traps. Eight traps were examined per system during the first sampling and 16 during the second. Curves of richness and curves of range/abundance were built for data processing. Two indexes of similarity were calculated. A total of 7,818 macro-invertebrates belonging to 20 orders were collected from the litter. From them, 321 were adult Coleopterans, grouped into 18 families and 33 morpho-species. The macro-fauna had higher values of richness of orders and abundance in the silvopastoral system of leucaena, mainly in October, 2010. The predominant orders, in both systems and moments of study, were Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. From the last one, the Formicidae family was mainly the predominant. The analysis of the Coleoptera order, at the level of morpho-species, showed higher richness and abundance in the silvopastoral system of leucaena, and the dominant morpho-specie, in both systems, was Scolytidae sp. 1.

AB  - The present study was investigated for soil bioremediation through sababul plant biomass (Leucaena leucocephala). The soil contaminated with textile effluent was collected from Erode (chithode) area. Various physico-chemical characterizations like N, P, and K and electrical conductivity were assessed on both control and dye contaminated soils before and after remediation. Sababul (L. leucocephala) powder used as plant biomass for remediation was a tool for textile dye removal using basic synthetic dyes by column packing and eluting. The concentration of the dye eluted was compared with its original concentration of dye and were analyzed by using UV-vis spectrophotometer. Sababul plant biomass was analyzed for its physico-chemical properties and active compounds were detected by GC-MS, HPTLC and FTIR. Plant growth was assessed with green gram on the textile contaminated soil and sababul had the potential of adsorbing the dye as the contaminated soil and also check the growth of green gram. © 2014.

AB  - We analyzed the symbiotic efficiency and genetic diversity of rhizobia isolated from Leucaena leucocephala in Liangshan Prefecture of SichuanProvince. We studied genetic diversity of these isolates with 16S rRNA RFLP, BOX-PCR and AFLP fingerprinting, and constructed phylogenetic tree based on the concatenated sequences of the four housekeeping genes 16S rRNA, recA, atpD and glnII. The nodulation ability and the symbiotic efficiency of the isolates were tested by plant inoculation assay on their original host plant. Genetic diversity and phylogenetic tree indicate that 26 isolates were assigned as Sinorhizobium, 3 Bradyrhizobium, 3 Rhizobium and 1 Mesorhizobium. SCAU203 might represent a new Rhizobium group, SCAU211 might represent a new Bradyrhizobium group, the other three representative strains were located in three phylogenic branches and closely related to S. americanum, M. plurifarium and R. huautlense, respectively. In the nodulation and symbiotic efficiency assay, only 2 of the 20 isolates promoted the growth of L. leucocephala, but 3 isolates had a growth slowing effect on the host, while the other isolates (84%) were ineffective on symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The majority of rhizobia isolated from L. leucocephala in Liangshan Prefecture were ineffective on symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

TI  - Manipulation of the energy metabolism of ruminants in the tropics: Options for improving meat and milk production and quality
PY  - 2014

AB  - Ruminant feeding in tropical regions is characterized by grass grazing. Throughout the year, grasses show variations in their availability and quality. Therefore, modern feeding systems must consider the energy requirements of the animal and the degree in which a feed or a combination of several of them could cover the nutritional requirements of the different species and physiological conditions. The central reaction for obtaining energy is carry out in the rumen in the anaerobic fermentation of the carbohydrates present in the feed. This process is developed by the ruminal microorganisms, with the purpose of generating energy for the microbial growth and the concomitant production of volatile fatty acids, methane, carbon dioxide and fermentation heat. For improving meat and milk production and quality in tropical regions, different options have been created for manipulating the energy metabolism of ruminants. Silvopastoral systems, based on Leucaena leucocephala and Panicum maximum association, allow attaining live weight gains of 770 g/d in growing cattle. It is essential the identification of Bos indicus cattle breeds or crosses with lower requirements of metabolizable energy (ME) for maintenance, so as the energy efficiency of meat production could be increased. For milk, it is possible to increase the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids (CLA's) by the tannin presence in the foliages that due to its beneficial effect on human health, could supply aggregate value to the cow's milk. Feeding practices are necessary for reducing the caloric increase of the feeding and that decrease methane emissions from the rumen through the effect of some foliages and fruits that possess secondary metabolites capable of affecting ruminal fermentation.

AB  - Plants have considerable hydrological and mechanical impacts on soil. However, there are lack of documentation and limited understanding on the hydrological and mechanical impacts of tropical legume trees. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the hydrological and mechanical properties of three selected legume plants, Leucaena leucocephala, Adenanthera pavonina and Peltophorum pterocarpum. Regarding hydrological aspect, the study results indicated that soil on which the L. leucocephala was grown had the highest transpiration rate, water absorption rate (WAR) and soil matric suction (SMS). In terms of mechanical characteristics, L. leucocephala exhibited the highest root tensile strength and cellulosic components in the root. Interestingly, L. leucocephala also showed a higher root biomass, root length and fine roots than A. pavonina and P. pterocarpum. The leaf area index (LAI) strongly correlated with SMS (R2 = 0.74), indicating that high LAI improved SMS. The high root tensile strength and fine roots of L. leucocephala make this species special for growing as a soil reinforcing plant. Overall results suggested that L. leucocephala exhibited outstanding hydrological and mechanical properties and can be a potential plant for the soil reinforcement program. © 2014, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This research aimed to evaluate the influence of diazotrophic bacteria on initial development of Peltophorum dubium and Leucaena leucocephala in greenhouse. The experimental design was a randomized block in factorial 2 × 4 with four replications, with the first factor formed by the two forest species P. dubium and L. leucocephala, while the second factor was related to microbiolization seeds by strains of diazotrophic growth promoting bacteria Azospirillum brasilense, Bradyrhizobium elkanii, association between the two bacteria and non-microbiolization control. The microbiolization seeds of forest species with A. brasilense, B. elkanii and association between the bacteria A. brasilense and B. elkanii improved seedling emergence of canafistula and leucaena. In canafístula, the A. brasilense, B. elkanii alone or in combination increased the dry weight of shoot, length of shoot and root length, and reduced diameter collect. In leucaena, B. elkanii increased the root dry weight and reduced diameter collect, and A. brasilense increased the dry weight of shoot and root system length, with higher dry shoot than association of A. brasilense and B. elkanii.

TI  - Rhizobium paranaense sp. nov., An effective N2-fixing symbiont of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with broad geographical distribution in Brazil
PY  - 2014

AB  - Nitrogen (N), the nutrient most required for plant growth, is key for good yield of agriculturally important crops. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) can benefit from bacteria collectively called rhizobia, which are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen (N2) in root nodules and supplying it to the plant. Common bean is amongst the most promiscuous legume hosts; several described species, in addition to putative novel ones have been reported as able to nodulate this legume, although not always effectively in terms of fixing N2. In this study, we present data indicating that Brazilian strains PRF 35T, PRF 54, CPAO 1135 and H 52, currently classified as Rhizobium tropici, represent a novel species symbiont of common bean. Morphological, physiological and biochemical properties differentiate these strains from other species of the genus Rhizobium, as do BOX-PCR profiles (less than 60% similarity), multilocus sequence analysis with recA, gyrB and rpoA (less than 96.4% sequence similarity), DNA-DNA hybridization (less than 50% DNA-DNA relatedness), and average nucleotide identity of whole genomes (less than 92.8.%). The novel species is effective in nodulating and fixing N2 with P. vulgaris, Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena esculenta. We propose the name Rhizobium paranaense sp. nov. for this novel taxon, with strain PRF 35T (=CNPSo 120T=LMG 27577T=IPR-Pv 1249T) as the type strain. © 2014 IUMS.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the efficiency of CCB-oxide on the resistance of Leucaena leucocephala wood to Nasutitermes corniger termite under food preference test. A total of 12 trees with diameters at breast height ranging from 6.0 to 12.0 cm were harvested in the municipality of Patos, Parai´ba state, Brazil. The trunks were severed into 2.0 m parts and peeled. A solution of 2% active ingredients of CCB-oxide was used. The pieces were submerged (50 cm from the base) in the treatment solution for 3, 6, 9 and 12 days and the penetration and retention of the solution was determined at 50 and 100 cm from the base. Samples of 1.5 × 1.5 × 15.0 cm were collected between these positions and submitted to termite attack for 45 days. The treatment has improved the resistance of Leucaena leucocephala wood to xylophagous termites, and the 12-day-long treatment promoted adequate protection to the wood.

AB  - Migratory birds are a group with complex ecology because they are affected by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors throughout their annual cycle. Although a lot of research has been conducted, further information on basic aspects such as feeding ecology is needed. From September 2011 to April 2012, a study was done on habitat use by Yellow Warbler (Setophaga petechia) and Red Tanager (Piranga rubra) on the campus of Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia. The recorded data included species, activity and its duration, foraging method, tree species, substrate, and height. "Foraging" was the activity with the largest proportion of time spent by birds; "Gleaning" was the most common foraging method used by the Yellow Warbler, while the Red Tanager used "Hovering" and "Sallying." Of 50 plant species used, Samanea saman, Pithecellobium dulce, Guazuma ulmifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Clitoria fairchildiana, and Jacaranda caucana were preferred. The most used height interval was 4-6 m, and substrates where birds were observed most frequently were "Twig," "Leaves, flowers and fruits," and "Secondary branch." The present study demonstrates that an area with abundant trees can provide habitat for migratory birds, despite being located in an urban environment. © 2014 The Neotropical Ornithological Society.

AB  - A laboratory experiment was conducted to study the allelopathic effects of the aqueous extract of the leaf and seed of Leucaena leucocephala. The aqueous extracts were individually tested on three selected weed species, namely goatweed (Ageratum conyzoides), coat buttons (Tridax procumbens) and lilac tasselflower (Emilia sonchifolia). The allelopathic effects of the leaf and seed extracts on germination, shoot length, root length and fresh weight of each of the selected weed species were determined. Germination of goatweed, coat buttons and lilac tasselflower were inhibited by the aqueous extracts of both the leaf and seed of L. leucocephala and was concentration dependent. Different concentrations of the aqueous extracts showed various germination patterns on the selected weeds species. Seedling length and fresh weight of goatweed, coat buttons and lilac tasselflower were reduced in response to respective increasing concentrations of the seed extracts. Maximum inhibition by the aqueous seed extract was observed more on the root rather than the shoot growth. The aqueous seed extract at T3 concentration reduced root length of goatweed, coat buttons and lilac tasselflower by 95%, 86% and 91% (of the control) respectively. The aqueous seed extract showed greater inhibitory effects than that of the aqueous leaf extract. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB  - The feeding programs for naked neck chickens in semi-intensive production system from brazilian equatorial semi-arid environment, must consider regional food availability and respective nutritional values. Thus, to evaluate the digestibility and metabolizable energy of alternative forages, it was used 240 naked neck pullets (Isa Label lineage) receiving water and ration ad libitum, pair-housed in cages for total collection of excreta on conventional warehouse. It was used a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement (5x2): one control ration (corn and soy meal) and other four experimental rations with silk flower hay (Calotropis procera), cassava leafs hay (Manihot esculenta), kills pasture hay (Senna obtusifolia) or leucaena leafs hay (Leucaena leucocephala), and all rations were balanced for two growing phases, between 8 and 10 weeks (young pullets) and between 14 and 16 weeks of age (old pullets). The values of apparent digestibility of nutrients for all experimental rations were lower than control ration (P <0.05) and it was observed general means of 72.18% for dry matter, 78.12% for crude protein, 66.90% for ether extract, 28.08% for neutral detergent fiber, 18.51% for the acid detergent fiber, 71.64% for gross energy and availability of 15.61% for mineral matter. The general mean of apparent and corrected metabolizable energy of alternative forages was 1217 kcal/ kg and 1108 kcal/kg, respectively, and the higher value was determined for leucaena hay and the lower value for silk flower hay (P <0.05). © 2014, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arid.

TI  - Distribution and phytoavailability of heavy metal chemical fractions in artificial soil on rock cut slopes alongside railways

AB  - Artificial soil is often sprayed onto cut slopes alongside railroad tracks to promote revegetation. This study evaluated the heavy metal content and the distribution of heavy metal chemical fractions in the soil, as well as the uptake of heavy metals by plants. The soil at four sites was determined to be considerably contaminated with Cd and Pb. The concentrations of Cd and Pb increased with the length of time the railway had been in use and decreased further away from the railway tracks. Pb primarily existed in reducible form but as residual fractions, whereas Cd was predominantly in exchangeable form. A correlation analysis indicated that pH, organic matter, and total phosphorus levels were important factors affecting the distribution of the heavy metal chemical fractions. The amounts of exchangeable Pb and Cd in the soil were highly correlated with their amounts in the plants sampled, indicating that the exchangeable fraction is a better indication of heavy metal phytoavailability than the total amount of heavy metals in the soil. Bioaccumulation and translocation factors indicated that Indigofera amblyantha had moderate tolerance and bioaccumulation capability for Pb, as did Leucaena leucocephala for Cd. These two plant species can serve as ideal slope remediation plants. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the use of woody legumes (Albizia lebbeck, Cratylia argentea, Dipteryx Allata (Baru), a Leucaena hybrid (L. leucocephala + L. diversifolia), and Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham) and herbaceous legumes (Arachis pintoi) intercropped with Panicum maximum cv. Massai, simultaneously implanted in a maize crop. The study made use of a randomized block experimental design with four replications. Assessments of biomass accumulation and forage nutritional value were made after the maize harvest, between June 2008 and October 2010. It was found that the residues of maize provided better growing conditions for Massai grass during the dry season. L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham and the Leucaena hybrid had the highest accumulation of all forage legumes evaluated, and provided the best nutritional value of all the arrangements tested. Of all woody legumes tested in this system, Leucaena was considered feasible for intercropping with Massai grass. The intercrop of perennial woody Baru with maize is not recommended. Albizia lebbeck and Cratylia argentea require further study, especially the yield assessment at different cutting intervals and cutting heights. Arachis pintoi had a low participation in the intercropping, showing greater performance over time, indicating slow thriving in this experimental condition. © 2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia.

AB  - This study evaluated the toxic effects of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) on growth of the legumes Crotalaria incana L. and Leucaena leucocephala Lam., and on the development of nitrogen-fixing soil microorganisms, using biological toxicity indices and the toxicity potential index (TPIc), which enable comparison of effects of exposure time and concentration. Growth and biomass accumulation in both plant species decreased with high pollutant concentrations. The EC50 and the NOEC were not identified for either species. The Phytotoxicity Relative Index showed that root length was most strongly affected by the oil, and the Impact Index on Nitrogen Fixer Microorganisms indicated that, despite damage to the root system, L. leucocephala rhizosphere bacteria doubled at 10,000 mg kg-1 TPH after of 240 days of exposure. Finally, the TPIc revealed that C. incana was more sensitive than L. leucocephala to chronic TPH toxicity and might strongly depend on beneficial soil bacteria. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to investigation the effect of method of inoculations, type as well as source of bacteria strains on growth response of two woody tree species Acacia saligna and Leucaena leucocephala, the present study was carried out at the nursery of the Department of Forestry and Wood Technology at Experimental Station, Faculty of Agriculture, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt. The main objective of the study is to evaluate growth, ability to inoculation with different strains in presence of NPK fertilizers as well as method of inoculations. The mineral fertilizer included treatments viz., application PK, NPK and inoculation with Rhizobium as well as control (without NPK and Rhizobium). Inoculation was used as soil and seed inoculations. The results indicated that the seedlings of A. saligna and L. leucocephala inoculation with Rhizobium in combination with mineral fertilizers were significantly affected on the growth and nodulation of seedlings. The soil inoculation surpassed seed inoculation. The native Rhizobium strains were highly significant effect than the foreign Rhizobium strain. Whereas, NGR234. Leucaena leucocephala was more responded to inoculate with Rhizobium strains in presence of mineral fertilizer treatments as compared to Acacia saligna. Concurrent use of fertilization and inoculation in the nursery may provide opportunity to produce larger seedlings that have high potential to reduce the time needed to achieve canopy closure and thereby help achieve restoration objectives. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.

AB  - The inhibitory activities of the methanol extracts from 20 selected medicinal plants on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were evaluated. The major compound from the most active plant extract was also investigated. The inhibitory effect of the methanol extracts on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was tested by incubating PBMCs with the sample and then stimulating by lipopolysaccharide at 0.1 μg/ml. The level of cytokines was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among the extracts tested, Andrographis paniculata extract demonstrated the strongest inhibition of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1α, and IL-6 release, with IC50 values of 1.54, 1.06, and 0.74 μg/ml, respectively. The IC50 value of A. paniculata extract was significantly higher than that of andrographolide on IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (p < 0.001) release. The IC50 values of andrographolide for IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of dexamethasone. Cymbopogon citratus and Zingiber officinale strongly inhibited the release of IL-1β, with IC50 values of 3.22 and 3.17 μg/ml, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report that A. paniculata extract and its major compound andrographolide strongly inhibited the release of IL-1α, whereas previous studies only showed their inhibitory effect on the release of another IL-1 family member, IL-1β. The results show that these extracts and this compound have potential effects as anti-inflammatory agents by inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. © 2014 The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer.

AB  - The performance of the edaphic macrofauna was evaluated in a Leucaena leucocephala-Cynodon nlemfuensis silvopastoral system at the Cattle Breeding Enterprise "Manuel Fajardo", located in the municipality of Jiguaní, Granma province. An area of 6.71 ha distributed in six paddocks was used in a completely randomized design with six replications in a carbonated brown soil. The study was conducted in the litter strata, 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm depth. The taxonomical composition, density and biomass of the macrofauna organisms were determined. The taxonomic composition consisted of 216 individuals, represented by three types, five classes and seven orders. From them, the most represented was the class Insecta. In the density of individuals there were differences (P < 0.05), from the litter of 8.08 individuals/m2 to 1.83 individuals/m2, at the 20-30 cm depth. For the biomass, there were differences (P < 0.05) and varied from 0.16 to 0.03 g/m2 for the litter at 20-30 cm, respectively. Also, in total density there was growth, following tree incorporation (6.07 ind./m2) and after total biomass grew by 0.18 g/m2, thus proportional abundance increased with the appearance of Hymenopterous, Diplopodous and Lepidopterous. The silvopastoral system improved the macrofauna with advantages for their exploitation as time went by.

AB  - Laboratory experiments were conducted to explore the potential of the yellow netted ladybeetle (Heteroneda billardieri Crotch) to control populations of the mango leafhopper (Idioscopus clypealis Lethierry). We studied the preference of the predatory beetle for the mango leafhopper and its host selection behavior on a three-prey-host plant system, using leafhopper (I. clypealis) on Mangifera indica, psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana Crawford) on Leucaena leucocephala and aphid (Aphis craccivora Koch) on Vigna unguiculata. In prey-host selection behavior, H. billardieri adults were found to land significantly more often on M. indica plants than on V. unguiculata or L. leucocephala, even when M. indica flowers were pestinfested or non-infested. The adults also selected V. unguiculata to a lesser extent regardless of whether V. unguiculata was pest-infested or not. However, the predator preferred the pest-infested L. leucocephala over the non-infested. In terms of preference for prey, H. billardieri preferred H. cubana to I. clypealis and A. craccivora. H. cubana comprised 64-68% of the total consumption. Copyright © 2017 The Philippine Agricultural Scientist.

AB  - A study was conducted to assess the effect of planting geometry viz., 0.75 × 0.75 m, 1 × 1 m, 1.25 × 1.25 m and 1.5 × 1.5 m on growth, biomass partitioning and productivity of Leucaena leucocephala. The results showed that planting of L. leucocephala at 1.25 × 1.25 m spacing brought about significantly higher plant height (12.25 m), dbh (9.18 cm) and branches/plant (136) thus plant accumulated higher biomass of leaves, stem and branches by 205.9, 247.3, 250.4 and 97.5,94.3, 87.3% over planting at spacing 0.75 × 0.75 m and 1 × 1 m, respectively. Planting at wider spacing i. e. 1.5 × 1.5 m failed to bring significant gain in biomass over 1.25 × 1.25 m. The total biomass of leaves, stem and branches was also higher in 1.25 × 1.25 m spacing (151.2 t/ha), while it was lowest in 1.5 × 1.5 m (99.5 t/ha). The annual increment in total biomass of 50.4 t/ha/year was also higher in the spacing 1.25 × 1.25 m.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala was introduced into Panxi, Sichuan, China, in the 1980s and 1990s for afforestation and preventing water loss and soil erosion in this area. The co-introduction of rhizobial symbionts of introduced plants has drawn attention since they may influence local soil communities. We studied the phylogenetic position of the L. leucocephala isolates and assessed if the rhizobia were introduced together with the host to Panxi, Sichuan, China. The glnII and atpD genes of fifteen representative isolates were sequenced and analyzed, and applied multilocus sequence analyses in which the housekeeping genes recA, glnII and atpD were included. Furthermore, we estimated the within species diversity directly with 23S rDNA and IGS RFLP and indirectly through phenotypic analysis of forty L. leucocephala isolates. The isolates represented seven species and 38 diversified strains in the genera Ensifer, Mesorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium. The within species diversity of the Ensifer isolates was large, proposing a potential to occupy novel niches. There was not conclusive evidence to show that any of the strains would have been co-introduced with L. leucocephala. On the contrary, we came to a conclusion that the possible introduction should not be inferred from sequence data alone. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Introduced into several countries worldwide for agroforestry, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit is a typical 'conflict species' that invades several riparian, forested and disturbed habitats in South Africa. The seed beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was subsequently deployed as a seed-reducing agent to offset its excessive seed output. However, exploratory egg-exposure trials, in which native Acacia s.l. trees were used as 'surrogate host plants', suggested that high egg mortality is reducing the beetle's impact. The aims of this study were to (1) verify this suspicion by comparing the mortality of eggs exposed in L. leucocephala and Acacia nilotica (L.) Willd ex Del. stands and (2) determine whether height of exposure in the canopy (i.e. oviposition site selection) influences the different mortality factors. Although lower than in the exploratory trials, egg mortality was considerable, ranging from 30 to 50% in most instances. While unaffected by height of exposure, the overall egg mortality (i.e. all factors) was significantly lower in seeds exposed on L. leucocephala. Mortality was not only mostly attributed to parasitism (51% of mortality), but also predation (30%) and unknown factors (19%). While unexplained mortality and predation were not influenced by tree species or height of exposure, parasitism increased significantly with height above ground and was significantly lower in seeds exposed on L. leucocephala. Egg mortality is thus one of several factors that appears to be limiting the efficacy of A. macrophthalmus in South Africa. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The nutrition of genetic cattle is extremely important for the animals to express their potential, especially when feeding is based on pastures and forages. Therefore, the objective of this work was to compare the gains of Charolaise heifers in a silvopastoral system with a monocrop. An area of 27 ha of a brown soil with carbonates in the Cuban eastern region was used and 12 replicates were distributed in a completely randomized design to compare: A) silvopastoral system of Leucaena leucocephala-Cynodon nlemfuensis and B) monocrop of Cynodon nlemfuensis. A group of 30 growing heifers with 160 kg of average live weight, 10-11 months old, were used between June 2009 and May 2010, with a stocking rate of 1,11 LAU/ha and occupation time of 7-10 days. The weight and gain, as well as the agronomic performance and feeding balance of both treatments, were determined. The availability was 12,3 t/ha in the monocrop and 21,3 kg/ha in the silvopastoral system (HB); live weight gains were 15,4 and 18,06 kg/animal in the monocrop and silvopastoral system, respectively, during the rainy season, although the feeding balances suggest that the ME, PDIN and P requirements were not covered. The best weight results for the growing Charolaise heifers were obtained in the silvopastoral system of Leucaena-Cynodon with a positive economic effect of 2086.28 Cuban pesos as compared with the Cynodon monocrop.

AB  - Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 catabolizes mimosine, which is a toxic non-protein amino acid present in Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena). The objective of this investigation was to study the biochemical and catalytic properties of the enzyme encoded by midD, one of the TAL1145 genes involved in mimosine degradation. The midD-encoded enzyme, MidD, was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and used for biochemical and catalytic studies using mimosine as the substrate. The reaction products in the enzyme assay were analyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. MidD has a molecular mass of ~45 kDa and its catalytic activity was found to be optimal at 37 C and pH 8.5. The major product formed in the reaction had the same retention time as that of synthetic 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (3H4P). It was confirmed to be 3H4P by MS/MS analysis of the HPLC-purified product. The K m, V max and K cat of MidD were 1.27 × 10-4 mol, 4.96 × 10-5 mol s-1 mg-1, and 2,256.05 s-1, respectively. Although MidD has sequence similarities with aminotransferases, it is not an aminotransferase because it does not require a keto acid as the co-substrate in the degradation reaction. It is a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme and the addition of 50 μM hydroxylamine completely inhibited the reaction. However, the supplementation of the reaction with 0.1 μM PLP restored the catalytic activity of MidD in the reaction containing 50 μM hydroxylamine. The catalytic activity of MidD was found to be specific to mimosine, and the presence of its structural analogs including l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan and l-phenylalanine did not show any competitive inhibition. In addition to 3H4P, we also identified pyruvate and ammonia as other degradation products in equimolar quantities of the substrate used. The degradation of mimosine into a ring compound, 3H4P with the release of ammonia indicates that MidD of Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 is a C-N lyase. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Plant communities get disturbed due to open cast coal mining as large amount of overburden is dumped at the nearby areas of the mines. The vegetation on different age series of six overburden dumps (0,4,8,12, 16 and 20 years) were analyzed during the post monsoon period of 2011 in Sonepur Bazari area, West Bengal, India. The plant species and other relevant criteria were recorded using randomly placed quadrats. Species richness, Diversity indices and Importance value index (IVI) were calculated using standard methods. Among monocots, the IVI of Saccharum spontanium was highest at all the over burden dumps. Among dicotyledons, Croton bonplandianum was the most important on OBD-4 and 8. On OBD-12 both Croton bonplandianum and Lantana camara were somewhat equally important. On OBD-16, Croton bonplandianum, Tephrosia perpurea and Evolvulus nummularis were most important where as on OBD-20 maximum importance value was shown by Chromalaena odorata and Hyptis suaveolens. Among tree species Leucaena leucocephala and Zizyphus mauritiana had highest IVI value on OBD-12 and Butea monosperma, Dalbergia sissoo and Lagerstoemia strictus on OBD-16. Finally Butea monosperma and Dalbergia sissoo showed highest IVI values on OBD-20. Diversity indices and species richness of non-grasses species was found getting increased with the age of OBD. Interestingly the grasses, specially Saccharum spontanium, were seen to grow as pioneers and got established under the prevailing high environmental adversity. On the contrary, other herbaceous and tree species were seen getting established at later stages of succession. © 2014 Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

AB  - Taking bare land as the control, this paper studied the effects of different planting modes on the soil permeability of sloping farmlands in purple soil area. For the test six planting modes, the soil permeability was in the order of Eriobotrya japonica > Citrus limon > Vetiveria zizanioides hedgerows+corn > Leucaena leucocephala hedgerows+corn > Hemerocallis fulva > corn > bare land, and decreased with increasing depth. The eigenvalues of soil infiltration were in the order of initial infiltration rate > average infiltration rate > stable infiltration rate. The soil permeability had significant positive linear correlations with soil total porosity, non-capillary porosity, initial moisture content, water holding capacity, and organic matter content, and significant negative linear correlation with soil bulk density. The common empirical infiltration model could well fit the soil moisture infiltration processes under the six planting modes, while the Kostiakov equation could not.

AB  - The growth characteristics of 20-year-old Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehuh and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) Dewit in the monocultures and their mixed-species plantations in the Yuanmou Dry-hot Valley of southwestern China were investigated by a stem analysis. The results showed that all the DBH, height and volume of timber of E. camaldulensis in the mixed-species plantations grew faster than those in monoculture. The average increment and current annual increment of height of both the species declined. DBH of the two species declined during 5-10 years but increased during 10-15 years beside E. camaldulensis in the mixed-species plantations, and then all decreased. The changing rates of Logistic growth curve could scale 5-10, 10-25, and > 25 years as the early growth period, rapid growth period and stationary growth stage, respectively. Based on this model, E. camaldulensis in the monoculture and mixed-species plantations will obtain the quantitative maturity at the 23 years and 25 years after the trees were planted, respectively, and both the 24 years for L. leucocephala in the monoculture and mixed-species plantations. Some management measures such as thinning and increasing water and fertilizer supply in the early and rapid growth period were recommended based on this study.

TI  - 'Universal' spray droplet adhesion model - accounting for hairy leaves
PY  - 2013

AB  - The adhesion of a spray droplet upon initial contact with a leaf surface is extremely important to spray efficacy and is dependent on dynamic interactions between droplets (formulation, size, velocity) and leaf (micro-topography, surface chemistry, veininess, hairiness and orientation). A 'universal' spray droplet adhesion model has previously been developed, using 50% aqueous acetone contact angles as a measure of leaf surface properties; this model satisfactorily predicts initial adhesion over a range of formulation surface tensions, droplet sizes and velocities. However, it failed to fit data from hairier leaves. This study investigates initial spray droplet adhesion on hairy leaves. Two categories of hairy leaves were identified by how the droplets penetrate the leaf hairs, Wenzel (hairy) and Cassie-Baxter (super hairy). For the Wenzel-type, a simple constant accounted for the increased droplet shatter caused by the hairs. For the Cassie-Baxter-type, a cushioning factor was introduced to account for the absorption of kinetic energy at impact by the hair mat. The cushioning factor was estimated by measuring the relative height of the hair mat. By including these two parameters, the new model successfully predicted the mean adhesion of non-hairy, hairy and super-hairy plants (R2 = 0.96). This model and the underlying principles determining hairy leaf adhesion developed in this article will help develop spray formulations effective at targeting hairy-leaved weed and crop species. © 2013 European Weed Research Society.

AB  - Environmental pollution, as a consequence of the industrialization process, is one of the major problems that have to be solved and controlled. The heightened awareness regarding the high toxicity and biochemical behavior of the different arsenic species required to develop cost effective technologies for the speciation of arsenic species. Electrochemical techniques are found to be comparatively better tools for arsenic speciation. As (III) is electrochemically stable in the presence of ascorbic acid as supporting electrolyte, while As (V) is electrochemically inactive at the electrode surface. The present piece of work is an attempt to measure the two arsenic species in the elution of arsenic sorbed Leucaena leucocephala seed powder (LLSP), using square wave anodic stripping voltammetry. The strategy employed in this work is based on the determination of As (III) directly, while determining As (V) after reduction with sodium thiosulfate into As (III). The removal percentage of As (III) and As (V) using LLSP biomaterial was 83.18 and 95 %, respectively. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In areas of the Institute of Animal Science during the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 was determined the soil carbon storage in three tropical cattle raising systems under exploitation with bovine cattle: A) silvopastoral based on Panicum maximum and Leucaena leucocephala; b) monoculture of Panicum maximum and c) grass association with a mixture of creeping legumes. In each one of the systems soil carbon storage (SCS), organic matter and apparent density were determined. Botanical composition, frequency of species appearance and soil cover were evaluated in each system. In all systems, the highest carbon deposit occurred from 0 to 15 cm depth. The silvopastoral system and that of the legume mixture increased the SCS with the time of exploitation, which varied from 54.4 to 65.3 t ha-1 and from 50.6 to 60.4 t ha-1, respectively. The system with guinea grass monoculture decreased the SCS with the time of exploitation, which was of 60.4 to 43.7 t ha-1. It is concluded that SCS contents are in function of the use and management of the soil and directly related to the organic matter content. In the depth from 0 to 45, the greatest accumulation of CSC occurred in the first 15 cm. The silvopastoral system and that of the creeping legume mixture had a gradual increase in the SCS with the exploitation time, which turns them into viable alternatives for carbon capture in grassland agricultural ecosystems. The monoculture system showed decline signs, with which were related their lower values in the SCS. It is recommended to use silvopastoral systems and of creeping legume mixtures to improve the soil C storage and to attain systems of stable and productive improved grasses.

AB  - Cassava peels (CaPe) were ensiled in mixtures with Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala, and the utilization of the mixed silages by West African dwarf (WAD) goats was assessed. Five silages were composed, comprising of 100 % ensiled CaPe (control), CaPe + G. sepium 2:1 (w/w; 2CGS), CaPe + G. sepium 1:1 (w/w; CGS), CaPe + L. leucocephala 2:1 (w/w; 2CLL) and CaPe + L. leucocephala 1:1 (w/w; CLL). All diets were supplemented with molasses (40 g/kg) before ensiling which lasted 3 months. Fifteen WAD goats (8.01 ± 0.12 kg body weight) were fed one of the experimental diets (50 g/kg body weight) for 8 weeks. The control had the lowest hydrocyanic acid content (0.05 mg/kg DM), while others ranged from 6.2 to 81.3 mg/kg. Condensed tannin concentration ranged from 1.7 to 8.4 mg/kg DM, while mimosine levels were 11.6 and 12.4 mg/kg DM in 2CLL and CLL, respectively. After fermentation, all silages showed low pH (<4.5) and were different (P < 0.05) in the lactic, acetic and butyric acid concentrations. Ratio of foliage supplementation influenced DM intake (P < 0.05). Daily weight gains ranged from 17 (CLL) to 24 g/day in control. The digestibility coefficients of nutrients and fibre fractions differed (P < 0.05) among diets. The values for packed cell volume, haemoglobin, red blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes were also different (P < 0.05) across the dietary treatments. Ensiling CaPe with foliages of G. sepium and L. leucocephala can be recommended for feeding WAD goats especially during the dry spells when there is little or no available forage for the animals. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Earthworm casts are known to contribute significantly to surface soil fertility in agroecosystems. Knowledge of their role in maintaining soil fertility is of primary importance in keeping a healthy soil ecosystem. Thus physicochemical properties of earthworm casts and their production rate were studied for a period of three years (2002 to 2004) in two agroforestry sites, Sakawrtuichhun (SKT) and Pachhunga University College (PUC), in the state of Mizoram in northeast India. Plants including Leucaena leucocephala, pineapple (Ananas comosus) and manadarin orange (Citrus reticulata) were present in both sites. Sampling of earthworm casts was done on the basis of occurrence of fresh worm casts. Four species of earthworms, viz. Metaphire houlleti, Perionyx excavatus, Eutyphoeus mizoramensis and Drawida sp., were common to both study sites, whereas Perionyx macintoshi was recorded only at PUC. Earthworm casts were mainly produced from June to September. Maximum cast production was recorded in October 2002 at SKT and July 2003 at PUC. Annual cast production declined from the first year to the third year by 18% and 25.5% at SKT and PUC, respectively. This may be attributed to a decrease in population and food supply due to local weeding practices. Among the physico-chemical parameters studied, only phosphorus levels showed significant correlation with worm cast production. Potassium showed the highest degree of difference between worm casts and its adjacent soil, while nitrogen showed the least difference. Our results show that worm cast production coincides with the rainy season and earthworm cast contains higher levels of inorganic nutrient compared to adjacent soil. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.

AB  - The chemical analysis of plants and soils is a frequently used approach in understanding a serpentine ecosystem. Studies on vegetation growth in serpentine soils focused on various plant species for remediation purposes of soil contamination with heavy metals, emphasizing their role in the metal extraction or stabilization in the soil. The aims of this study were to measure the concentrations of Cr, Mn, and Ni in the soils and plants and to elucidate the phytoremediation potential of the studied plants. This study was performed at an abandoned site of serpentine mining in eastern Taiwan. Seven plant species were collected for analysis of Cr, Mn, and Ni, including Crotalaria micans, Miscanthus floridulus, Leucaena leucocephala, Bidens pilosa, Pueraria lobata, Melilotus indicus, and Conyza canadensis. The Cr and Ni concentrations in all studied plants were higher than those in general plants. In all species, the mean concentrations of Cr, Mn, and Ni in the shoots were lower than those in the root. None of the collected specimens exhibited hyperaccumulation of Cr, Mn, and Ni. All studied species may be used to remediate contaminated soils through phytostabilization of Cr and Mn, whereas M. floridulus and M. indicus are appropriate plants for phytostabilization of Ni. However, C. micans, L. leucocephala, B. pilosa, P. lobata, and C. canadensis have the potential to remove Ni from contaminated soils for the purpose of phytoextraction. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Citrus limon peel (kitchen waste) and Leucaena leucocephala seeds (agricultural waste) were used as a modifier for fabrication of modified carbon paste electrode for determination of mercury in aqueous sample using differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry. Mercury was adsorbed on electrode surface at open circuit and anodic stripping voltammetric scan was run from -0.5 to 0.5 V. Various electrochemical parameters including amount of modifier, supporting electrolyte, accumulating solvent, pH of the accumulating solvent, and accumulation time were investigated. The effect of presence of other metal ions and surfactants was also studied. In comparison C. limon peel proved to be a better modifier than L. leucocephala seed biomass. This was justified by electrode characterization using cyclic voltammetry that indicated decrease in resistance of electrode when C. limon peel was used as modifier and increase when modifier was L. leucocephala seeds. Maximum current response was obtained using 5 % C. limon peel biomass, hydrochloric acid as supporting electrolyte, acetate buffer of pH 6 as an accumulating solvent, 10-min accumulation time, and scan rate of 50 mV/s. Linear calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range 100 to 1,000 μg L-1 of mercury for accumulation time of 10 min with limit of detection of 57.75 μg L -1 and limit of quantification of 192.48 μg L-1. This technique does not use mercury as electrode material and, therefore, has a positive environmental benefit. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Twenty weeks forage re-growth from 20 multipurpose trees and shrubs (MPTS) species (Albizia ferruginea, Albizia gummifera, Albizia niopoides, Berlinia grandiflora, Bauhimia monandra, Dialium guineense, Dalbergia sissoo, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Leucaena leucocephala, Lonchocarpus sericeus, Milletia griffoneanus, Milletia thoningii, Napoliana imperialis, Parkia bicolor, Pterocarpus santalinoides, Senna spectabilis, Treculia africana, Terminalia superba, Tetrapluera tetraptera and Xylia xylocarpa) were investigated for their feed value. The MPTS were grown on an ultisol in southeastern Nigeria and were subjected to proximate analyses, nylon bag degradability studies and cluster analysis. Among species, crude protein (CP) ranged from 104 g kg-1 DM in P. bicolor to 205 g kg-1 DM in A. gummifera, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) ranged from 498 g kg-1 DM in L. leucocephala to 771 g kg-1 DM in L. sericeus, acid detergent fibre (ADF) ranged from 303 g kg-1 DM in T. superba to 661 g kg-1 DM in L. sericeus, acid detergent lignin (ADL) ranged from 75 g kg-1 DM in T. superba to 305 g kg-1 DM in L. sericeus. Also, ADF-ash ranged from 0.78 g kg-1 DM in E. cyclocarpum to 15.58 g kg-1 DM in D. guineense. Except E. cyclocarpum and S. spectabilis, the remaining 18 MPTS studied had effective degradabilities (ED) less than 500 g kg-1 DM effective degradability. Eight MPTS (A. ferruginea, A. niopoides, B. monandra, D. sissoo, E. cyclocarpum, L. leucocephala, S. spectabilis, T. superba) were classified as high quality, another eight (A. gummifera, B. grandiflora, L. sericeus, N. imperialis, P. bicolor, P. santalinoides, T. tetraptera and X. xylocarpa) as medium quality while, the remaining four (D. guineensis, M. griffoneanus, M. thoningii, T. africana) fell into the low quality class based on their nutrient composition and ruminal DM degradability. The results indicate that most of the MPTS could be used as good quality feed for small ruminants in Nigeria. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Prediction of invasive species distributions from survey data is widely recognized as a significant component of forest management and conservation planning. Leucaena leucocephala is the most aggressive invasive shrub and tree in the Hengchun peninsula in southern Taiwan. We analyzed geo-referenced data to identify potential variables of invasion and to predict likelihood of further invasion using boosted regression trees. Our results, which classified 92% of the cells correctly with regard to species presence and absence, indicated probability of invasion is correlated with climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation), landscape features (altitude; slope ratio and aspect; percentages of natural or secondary forest, agriculture land, developed area, and water bodies; and distances to the nearest forest edge and river), and anthropogenic factors (length of forest edge, and distances to the nearest road and agriculture land). The most influential variables are average annual temperature, altitude, precipitation, and slope. Continued range expansion by L. leucocephala is most likely to proceed (1) from the eastern and western portions toward the central portion of Hengchun township and (2) throughout the southern and toward the eastern portions of Manjhou township. Our model should provide useful information to aid forest managers in the development of long term monitoring and control strategies for L. leucocephala, in the early detection and eradication of newly established invasions, and also a framework for the integration and analysis of new presence and absence field data as they become available. © Weed Science Society of America.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (coffee bush) is a strictly tropical species that requires warm temperatures for optimal growth. It is drought-tolerant (even during establishment) and can withstand up to 7 months of dry season. L. leucocephala oil extracted from seeds was analyzed to determine it possible uses. The oil content of the seeds was 5.44% and mainly consisted of linoleic acid (51.65%), oleic acid (21.40%), palmitic acid (13.21%) and stearic acid (5.92%). This oil has high vitamin E activity because of its concentration of α-tocopherol (175.47mg/100g). The weak acid and peroxide values (0.6% and 3.56mequiv.·O2/kg oil, respectively) were indicators of the good quality of the oil. L. leucocephala showed high thermal stability (up to 255.47°C) and some absorbance in the UV-B and UV-C ranges. The results showed that this new seed oil can be used as an ingredient in cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Antioxidant activity of brown lead (Leucaena leucocephala) seed extracts with and without prior chlorophyll removal was studied in comparison with mimosine. Both extracts showed similar hydroxyl radical (HO•) scavenging activity, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging activity, singlet oxygen inhibition and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) scavenging capacity (p > 0.05). Nevertheless, the extract without prior chlorophyll removal had higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity than that with prior chlorophyll removal (p < 0.05). Generally, lead seed extracts with and without prior chlorophyll removal possessed a lower antioxidant activity, compared with mimosine. When lead seed extract without prior chlorophyll removal (100 and 200 ppm) was used in different lipid oxidation model systems, including β-carotene-linoleic acid and lecithin liposome systems, the preventive effect toward lipid oxidation was dose-dependent. At the same level of use, mimosine exhibited a higher efficacy in prevention of lipid oxidation in both systems as indicated by the lower increases in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. A similar result was obtained in minced mackerel. Therefore, lead seed extract containing mimosine could act as a natural antioxidant to prevent lipid oxidation in foods. © The Author(s) 2012.

AB  - Iron mining is an important activity for the world's economy; however, it raises environmental concerns associated with difficulties in revegetating mine tailings. The addition of amendments and the right choice of plant species have been assumed to be important steps in promoting plant growth in degraded lands. This study was carried out to evaluate the potential of organic waste from shrimp farms to amend mine tailings and thereby improve both plant growth and nutrient accumulation. An experiment was set up in randomised blocks with a 5×3 factorial scheme and four replicates. The treatments featured five different quantities of organic waste (0, 2, 4, 8 and 12Mgha-1) and three plant species (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and Mimosa hostilis Benth). Seedlings were grown for 90 days in pots filled with mine tailings mixed with organic waste. Above- and belowground dry matter and macro- and micronutrient accumulation were evaluated. Low levels of aboveground dry matter and higher root/shoot ratios were observed in L. leucocephala, which also presented low aboveground Na accumulation. An increase in plant dry matter was observed with the addition of 12Mgha-1 of organic waste, whereas an increase in N accumulation was observed with the addition of 8Mgha-1 of organic waste. The relative magnitudes of aboveground macro- and micronutrient accumulations were N>Ca>K>Mg>P and Fe>Mn>Zn>Cu, respectively. The relative magnitudes of belowground macro- and micronutrient accumulations were N>K>Ca>Mg>P and Mn>Fe>Zn>Cu, respectively. The species with the best potential to stimulate nutrient cycling and salt extraction were M. caesalpiniaefolia and M. hostilis, whereas L. leucocephala presented the best adaptation to drought conditions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The nutritive value of 20 forage plants commonly used for feeding pigs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was studied to determine chemical composition, protein amino acid profiles, mineral content, and in vitro digestibility using a two-step method combining an enzymatic pepsin and pancreatin hydrolysis followed by a 72. h gas-test fermentation. The highest protein contents (270-320. g/kg DM) were obtained for Vigna unguiculata, Psophocarpus scandens, Leucaena leucocephala, Manihot esculenta, and Moringa oleifera. Grasses, Acacia mangium, and Eichhornia crassipes, showed the lowest crude protein (CP) and highest NDF contents. Cajanus cajan and Trypsacum andersonii had the most balanced amino acid profile, being deficient in lysine and slightly deficient in histidine, while Megathyrsus maximus displayed the highest number of essential amino acids deficiencies. High mineral contents were obtained from, in ascending order, with M. oleifera, V. unguiculata, E. crassipes, Ipomea batatas and Amaranthus hybridus. In vitro dry matter digestibility ranged from 0.25 to 0.52, in vitro CP digestibility from 0.23 to 0.80, in vitro energy digestibility from 0.23 to 0.52. M. esculenta, M. oleifera, I. batatas, Mucuna pruriens, V. unguiculata, P. scandens and A. hybridus showed high digestibilities for all nutrients. Gas production during fermentation of the pepsin and pancreatin-indigestible fraction of the plants varied from 42. ml/g DM for A. mangium to 202. ml/g DM for I. batatas (P<0.001). Short-chain fatty acid production during fermentation varied from 157 to 405. mg/g of the pepsin and pancreatin indigestible fraction. It is concluded that some of these species are interesting sources of proteins and minerals with a good digestibility that might be used more economically than concentrate, especially in smallholder production systems, to improve pig feeding, mineral intake and intestinal health in pigs reared in the tropics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Influence of different cutting positions and rooting hormones on root initiation and root-soil matrix of two tree species

AB  - The soil bioengineering technique, vegetation through stem cutting, is highly effective for soil reinforcement as well as in controlling surface erosion. But the success of this technique depends on the suitable plant species, their stem cutting position and their rooting ability. This study aimed at investigating the effects of different cutting positions and hormones on the formation of rooting of stem cuttings and root-soil matrix. According to the observations, Leucaena leucocephala was not suitable for propagation through stem cuttings. Even stem cuttings were treated by rooting hormones. In case of Peltophorum pterocarpum stem cuttings, a higher survival rate with higher stem number, leaf area index (LAI) and root initiation were observed in basal position cuttings than apical position. The soil moisture content was negatively correlated with root biomass and matric suction. Moreover, higher root length, volume and biomass were found in IBA treated stems than NAA and control, which presumably reduce more soil moisture content and increase matric suction. It can be concluded that stem cuttings should be taken from basal cutting position and IBA hormone should be applied to induce adventitious roots of P. pterocarpum. This technique will be suitable for practical application on soil bioengineering sites to improve root-soil matrix and reinforce soil. © 2013 Friends Science Publishers.

AB  - The study described the current plant community structure of a secondary forest in Barangay Camias, Porac, Pampanga. A general floristic list of species was constructed, life forms were determined, most important species were identified, and species diversity in the area was computed. Forty-three (43) undershrub and eighteen (18) tree species were recorded in the area, most of which are members of Fabaceae and Poaceae. A significant difference was observed between the proportion of life forms present and that of Raunkiaer's categories. The most important undershrub species were Chromolaena odorata, Mikania micrantha, and Lantana camara, while the most important tree species were Leucaena leucocephala, Mangifera indica, and Albizia saman. Relatively low species diversity was recorded in the area measured using Simpson's Index of Diversity (0.927 for undershrub species, 0.855 for tree species) and Shannon-Wiener Index (3.00 for undershrub species, 2.28 for tree species). The dominance of Fabaceae and Poaceae species, the significant difference between the expected and observed proportion of life forms, and the prevalence of the most important species being invasive alien species (IAS) are indicative of a very disturbed area. The site is currently in its initial phase of regeneration from an ash and lahar covered area to a secondary forest.

AB  - Availability of water, soil conditions and recurring disturbances are the main factors that limit plant establishment in disturbed sites in tropical dry forests. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of applying compost and of plastic mulch on survival and initial plant growth of the woody species Dodonaea viscosa, Leucaena leucocephala and Lysiloma divaricatum, in a degraded pasture in northwestern Morelos. In 2009, 121-124 plants of each species were planted; 500 mL of compost, made from cattle manure, grass and tomato plant residues, and later, a plastic mulch (40 × 40 cm square) were applied to plants of each species selected at random. The following treatments were obtained: 1) compost, 2) plastic mulch, 3) compost and mulch, and 4) control (without compost or mulch). Survival and growth were recorded bi-monthly for one year. Survival was analyzed with a generalized linear model, and analyses of variance were performed for growth variables. The species with the highest survival rate was L. divaricatum (61 %) and that with the lowest was D. viscosa (8 %). Plastic mulch increased survival by 17 % to 31 %, depending on the species. Addition of compost had a significant effect (p≤0.05) only on growth in diameter of L. leucocephala. Use of plastic mulch increased restoration success and can be used in other sites where soil characteristics and water stress limit establishment of woody species.

AB  - This study investigated the effects on digestibility and growth when West African Dwarf (WAD) sheep were fed a basal diet of Tripsacum laxum with Leucaena leucocephala or dried poultry waste as supplement. Fifteen WAD sheep (12 rams and 3 ewes) were randomly allocated to three dietary treatments of 5 animals each, namely T1-basal diet of chopped T. laxum (control), T2-basal diet plus dried poultry waste, and T3-basal diet plus L. leucocephala. Animals had access to drinking water and a mineral mix ad libitum. They were weighed weekly after a 2-week adaptation period, for a duration of 12 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, three rams randomly selected from each treatment group were used for the digestibility study. Results revealed that average daily intake of L. leucocephala (350. 0 ± 0. 3 g/animal) was higher than that of dried poultry waste (260. 0 ± 0. 1 g/animal). The supplemented groups, T2 and T3, gained 21. 4 and 31. 0 g daily respectively, while animals of the control group (T1) lost 6. 0 g daily. There was a significant difference (P < 0. 01) in dry matter intake between the control and supplemented groups, with T2 recording the highest intake. Organic matter intake of treatment 3 was significantly (P < 0. 01) higher than that of T1 and T2. The differences in crude fibre (CF) ingestion between T2 and T1 as well as T3 and T1 were significant (P < 0. 01), with the highest ingestion of CF occurring in T1. The dry matter digestibility of the supplemented groups was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than that of the control. The organic matter digestibility of T2 and T3, as well as T1 and T3 were significantly different (P < 0. 05), being highest in T3 (77. 0 ± 2. 1 %) and lowest in T2 (58. 1 ± 1. 0 %) It was concluded from the study that T. laxum can be better utilized in West African Dwarf sheep when supplemented with dried poultry waste or L. leucocephala. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Many studies demonstrate the potential application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for remediation purposes, but little is known on AMF potential to enhance plant tolerance to arsenic (As) and the mechanisms involved in this process. We carried anatomical and ultrastructural studies to examine this symbiotic association and the characteristics of shoots and roots of Leucaena leucocephala in As-amended soils (35 and 75mgAsdm-3). The experiment used 3 AMF isolates from uncontaminated soils: Acaulospora morrowiae, Glomus clarum, and Gigaspora albida; a mixed inoculum derived from combining these 3 isolates (named Mix AMF); and, 3 AMF isolates from As-contaminated areas: A. morrowiae, G. clarum and Paraglomus occultum. Phytotoxicity symptoms due to arsenic contamination appeared during plant growth, especially in treatments without AMF application. Inoculation with G. clarum and the mixture of species (A. morrowiae, G. albida, and G. clarum) resulted in better growth of L. leucocephala in soils with high As concentrations, as well as significant As removal from the soil, showing a potential for using AMF in phytoextraction. Light microscopy (LS), transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopies (SEM) studies showed the colonization of the AMF in plant tissues and damage in all treatments, with ultrastructural changes being observed in leaves and roots of L. leucocephala, especially with the addition of 75mgdm-3 of As. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The tree legume Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a high quality ruminant feed, vitally important for livestock pro-duction in the tropics, despite the presence of mimosine in the leaves. This toxic non-protein amino acid has the poten-tial to limit productivity and adversely affect the health of animals. In the 1980s, the ruminal bacterium Synergistes jonesii was discovered and subsequently distributed in Australia as an oral inoculum to overcome these toxic effects. However, in recent times, a number of factors, including: surveys of the status of toxicity worldwide; improved under-standing of the chemistry and mode of action of the toxins; new techniques for molecular sequencing; and concerns about the efficacy of the in vitro inoculum; have cast doubt on some past understanding of leucaena toxicity and pro-vide new insights into the geographical spread of S. jonesii. There is also confusion and ignorance regarding the occur-rence and significance of toxicity in many countries worldwide. Ongoing research into the taxonomy and ecology of the Synergistetes phylum, improved methods of inoculation, and improved management solutions, along with aware-ness-raising extension activities, are vital for the future success of leucaena feeding systems. © 2013.

AB  - Assessing the progress of alien plant invasion is pivotal for weed management. In this study, we develop a spatially explicit logistic regression imbedded cellular automaton (CA)-based species expansion model to estimate the invasion of a Central American Mimosoid tree Leucaena leucocephala (LELE) in a tropical coastal region of Taiwan.We delineated the LELE infested areas in 1988, 1997 and 2007 using the Satellite Pour L'observation de la Terre (SPOT), and refined the classifications using high spatial resolution aerial photographs or Formosat-2 satellite images (Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research, Taiwan). Dynamics of LELE by referring to 1988-1997 LELE spatial distributions were ingested into a logistic model to build transition rules for CA simulation. The results showed that the enhanced CA model can precisely (95% overall accuracy by comparing with the 2007 LELE distribution) model the population expansion of LELE. This study highlights the strength of this spatially explicit predictive model, and sheds the light on the management of alien invasive species management. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This research aimed to test particleboard with leucena (Leucaena leucocephala) wood particles and polyurethane resin castor oil based. The response variables are: modulus of rupture (MOR), internal adhesion (AI), apparent density (dap) and wood moisture content (um). The experiments were developed based on the methodological procedures of the ABNT NBR 14810:2002 standard. The particleboards were manufactured by hot-pressing at 4MPa and 90°C, using timber particles with 5% of moisture content and 10% of monocomponent and bicomponent polyurethane resin. The higher moisture content was achieved when the monocomponent polyurethane resin was used. The bicomponent polyurethane resin provided a percent increase of 43.7% and 22.7% on the modulus of rupture and apparent density, respectively, when compared to the standard limit. The internal adhesion of the panels manufactured with monocomponent resin was 2.45 times higher than the standard limit. The confidence interval between means revealed that the internal adhesion and apparent density exhibited statistical equivalence. A good correlation between the internal adhesion and apparent density was found, for this reason it was possible to estimate the internal adhesion of the panels based on the apparent density data.

AB  - The study was conducted to determine the long-term impact of different land uses on carbon sequestration, soil fertility, and microbial indices and to establish their interrelationship in a light-textured hyperthermic Udic Ustochrept. Soil samples were collected from existing land-use systems of (1) Eucalyptus tereticornis, (2) Terminalia chebula, (3) Acacia nilotica, (4) Leucaena leucocephala, (5) Embilica officinalis, (6) Zizyphus spp., and (7) maize-wheat rotation from depths of 0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm and examined for pH; organic carbon (OC); electrical conductivity (EC); available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K); micronutrients; microbial biomass carbon (MBC); microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN); and microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP). High-density plantations of Eucalyptus teriticornis had a greater potential in sequestering aboveground carbon (472.37 Mg ha-1), compared to widely spaced trees of Acacia nilotica (376.05 Mg ha-1). Eucalyptus teriticornis exhibited the greatest impact in increasing soil OC in all depths, followed by Acaccia nilotica and Terminalia chebula, and the lowest was in agriculture (0.778, 0.749, 0.590, and 0.471%, respectively, in surface soil). Available zinc and iron contents were greatest under Eucalyptus tereticornis, followed by Acacia nilotica, Zizyphus mauritiana, Embilica officinalis, Terminalia chebula, and Leucaena leucocephala. The MBC and MBN were greatest in Eucalyptus tereticornis, followed by Acacia nilotica, and lowest in agriculture. Correlation matrix revealed significant and positive relationships between carbon sequestered with OC, MBC, MBN, and MBP. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We selected 28 populations of Leucaena leucocephala from different geographical locations in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Orissa of India on the basis of height and girth at breast height (GBH). We evaluated fiber length, optical density, wall thickness, vessel element length, vessel element diameter, specific gravity and lignin of these populations of L. leucocephala in different sites. Populations had significant variations for all growth, wood and paper parameters. Girth at breast height (GBH) and specific gravity were the most important parameters for heritability and genetic gain, respectively. The minimum heritability was reported for vessel element length and genetic gain for fiber length. The populations were grouped into six clusters, cluster II had maximum number of populations (14) and clusters IV and VI had one population each. GBH contributed maximum of 34.39 % towards total divergence followed by specific gravity (14.02%). An economic technique to produce quality seed by establishing seed orchards with genetically divergent parents was suggested. The hybridization among the populations selected from diverse clusters could produce greater heterosis needed for higher growth and suitable wood and paper manufacturing parameters. © 2013 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) from the secondary xylem of Leucaena leucocephala has been purified to homogeneity through successive steps of ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE cellulose, Sephadex G-75, and Blue Sepharose CL-6B affinity column chromatographies. CAD was purified to 514.2 folds with overall recovery of 13 % and specific activity of 812. 5 nkat/mg. Native and subunit molecular masses of the purified enzyme were found to be ∼76 and ∼38 kDa, respectively, suggesting it to be a homodimer. The enzyme exhibited highest catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km 3.75 μM-1 s-1) with cinnamyl aldehyde among all the substrates investigated. The pH and temperature optima of the purified CAD were pH 8.8 and 40°C, respectively. The enzyme activity was enhanced in the presence of 2.0 mM Mg 2+, while Zn2+ at the same concentration exerted an inhibitory effect. The inclusion of 2.0 mM EDTA in the assay system activated the enzyme. The enzyme was inhibited with caffeic acid and ferulic acid in a concentration-dependent manner, while no inhibition was observed with salicylic acid. Peptide mass analysis of the purified CAD by MALDI-TOF showed a significant homology to alcohol dehydrogenases of MDR superfamily. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - The effect of Leucaena leucocephala hybrid-Bahru (LLB), which contains a high concentration of condensed tannins, on cellulolytic rumen fungal population in goats was investigated using real-time PCR. The fungal population in goats fed LLB was inhibited during the first 10 days of feeding, but after 15 days of feeding, there was a tremendous increase of fungal population (157.0 μg/ml), which was about fourfold more than that in control goats (39.7 μg/ml). However, after this period, the fungal population decreased continuously, and at 30 days of feeding, the fungal population (50.6 μg/ml) was not significantly different from that in control goats (55.4 μg/ml). © 2013 The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - With current advances in genomics, several technological processes have been generated, resulting in improvement in different segments of molecular research involving prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. A widely used contribution is the identification of new genes and their functions, which has led to the elucidation of several issues concerning cell regulation and interactions. For this, increase in the knowledge generated from the identification of promoters becomes considerably relevant, especially considering that to generate new technological processes, such as genetically modified organisms, the availability of promoters that regulate the expression of new genes is still limited. Considering that this issue is essential for biotechnologists, this paper presents an updated review of promoters, from their structure to expression, and focuses on the knowledge already available in eukaryotic systems. Information on current promoters and methodologies available for studying their expression are also reported. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.

TI  - Effects of supplementing Leucaena leucocephala and conserved forages from natural pasture on the performance of grazing calves
PY  - 2014

AB  - Twelve white Fulani × N'dama cross-bred calves weighing 83.79±1.16 kg were used in an 84-day experiment to investigate the utilization of forage resources from natural grazing land. The experimental diets were sole grazing, grazing + hay, grazing + silage and grazing + Leucaena leucocephala leaves. The calves were divided into four groups of three animals each and were randomly assigned to the four experimental diets. Crude protein (CP) contents of the forages ranged from 59 to 171 g/kg dry matter (DM). Neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) contents of the forages ranged from 560 to 705 g/kg DM and 363 to 440 g/kg DM, respectively. Significantly (P <0.05) higher values inmineral contents (Ca, K, P and Mg) were recorded for L. leucocephala leaves compared to other forage resources. Variations (P <0.05) were observed in the average daily gain. Animals on grazing + L. leucocephala leaves diet had the highest (113 g/day) average daily gain, while those on sole grazing showed the least value (26.2 g/day). Packed cell volume (PCV), total serum protein, urea and calcium concentration showed significant differences (P <0.05). Effective utilization of forage resources from the natural pasture by the calves was attained on supplementation with conserved forages and L. leucocephala leaves without any deleterious effects on the haematological and serum parameters. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - The tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) is an omnivorous fish native to the Amazon basin, which has high commercial value. Characteristics of rusticity and desirable growth in farming highlight this species for breeding in captivity. However, in commercial fish breeding, feed costs may represent 60-80% of total costs of production, being the protein the most expensive nutrient in the diet. The objective of this study was to evaluate the growth of juvenile tambaqui fed with diets containing leucaena leaf flour as protein source. A total of 240 juveniles were distributed in 12 experimental aquaria (350 L) in a completely randomized design with four treatments (0%, 8%, 16%, 24% of inclusion of leucaena leaf flour in diet) and three replications. Weight gain, feed conversion ratio, specific growth rate, protein efficiency rate and cost of production per kilogram of live weight gained were calculated. For the studied variables, there was no significant difference (p> 0.05) among treatments, indicating that it is possible to include up to 24% of leucaena leaf flour in diets for juveniles of tambaqui, without compromising the variables studied, although the replacement has not represented reduction in cost of production per kilogram of fish.

AB  - Nature demonstrates beautiful examples of superhydrophobic surfaces, which always exhibit hierarchical roughness. We demonstrate a simple biomimetic route to the formation of hierarchical roughness on paraffin wax surfaces by the successive deposition of waxes of increasing molecular weight (Mw). By means of this procedure the lower Mw waxes grow larger crystals, forming higher micro-roughness, the subsequently deposited higher Mw waxes produce lower submicron/nano-roughness, and the overall result is roughness of a higher hierarchical order. We show that, compared to unary wax crystal surfaces, these hierarchical structures have the advantage of increased surface stability expressed by the ability to maintain smaller drops in the Cassie-state, as well as the ability to support liquids having lower surface tensions with contact angles exceeding 150°. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In the present study, the sawdust of Leucaena leucocephala was examined to understand its suitability as substratum for the production of oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus). The sawdust contained 86.1, 25.8, 46.9, 27.56, 0.18, 45.36, 20.58, 27.3 and 1.9% of organic carbon, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, total lipids, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and ash, respectively. Higher growth rate of the fungus was recorded after incubation for eight days on the sawdust of L. leucocephala in Petri dishes. However, the weekly production of fruiting bodies (FB) decreased with increase in incubation period, but the accumulated production increased significantly. On the other hand, total production decreased with increase in incubation periods. The contents of ash, fiber, lipid, and nitrogen (crude protein) decreased significantly with increase in growth periods. The alterations in both fatty acid and amino acid contents of FB showed a negative correlation and visible catabolic metabolism with extension of the incubation period.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of extract of plants containing tannin on in vitro CH4 production, fermentation characteristics and nutrient degradability. Six of plant leaves i.e. Gliricidia sepium, Acacia mangium, Leucaena leucocephala, Desmodium intortum, Camellia sinensis, Calliandra calothyrsus and seed of Areca catechu were extracted by using water. Experimental treatments consisted of P. purpureophoides (300±5 mg) incubated alone or added with 1.2 mL of plant extracts. The in vitro neutral detergent fibre (NDF) degradability was determined using the first stage technique of Tilley and Terry. The results showed that total tannin concentration of plant extract ranged from 34 to 95 g/kg DM, and was lowest in D. intortum and highest in A. mangium. Methane production was significantly (P<0.001) lower with addition of A. mangium, L. leucocephala, A. catechu, C. sinensis and C. calothyrsus extracts compared to control. Total tannin had a close relationship with CH4 production (r=-0.79). There was strong correlation between CH4 production and NDF degradability (r=0.61). It was concluded that water extracts of A. mangium, L. leucocephala, A. catechu, C. sinensis and C. calothyrsus have potential to be used as rumen manipulator in order to reduce CH4 production in ruminants. © 2013 Diponegoro University.

AB  - Twenty Katahdin×Pelibuey crossbreed male lambs, 3 to 4 months of age and 24±0.3 kg of body weight, were used to study the anthelmintic effects of administering extracts of Salix babylonica L. (SB) and Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (LL). Lambs had not been treated with anthelmintics previously and were randomly allocated into four groups of five lambs each in a completely randomized design. Treatments were as follows: control (lambs fed on total mixed ration without extracts), SB (as control plus S. babylonica L. extract at 30 ml/day), LL (as control plus L. leucocephala Lam. extract at 30 ml/day), and SBLL (as control plus 30 ml/day of S. babylonica L. and L. leucocephala Lam. extracts in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture) for 63 days. Extracts were orally administered before the 8:00 a.m. feeding to each lamb. Rectal fecal samples were collected from each lamb at day 22 (P1), day 43 (P2), and day 63 (P3) of the experiment. Adult worm and egg counts were determined in each fecal sample immediately after collection. Plant secondary metabolites of total phenolics, saponins, and the aqueous fraction were 50 % lower in the SB versus LL extracts. Overall, the oral administration of extracts has improved the egg and worm count reductions in lamb feces by 54, 47, and 40 % for LL, SB, and SBLL, respectively, versus the control lambs. Reductions of worm egg counts in lamb feces were higher (P <0.05) in P2 and P3 versus P1. Extracts of SB and LL or possibly isolated bioactive compounds could be a promising alternative to conventional anthelmintics to treat gastrointestinal parasites of small ruminants. Such treatments could be used in control strategies against gastrointestinal nematodes in organic and conventional production systems. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - Galactomannan nanoparticles possess attractive properties such as biodegradable and biocompatible; significant in biomedical applications. Galactomannan (GA) isolated from the mature seed of a local plant, petai belalang known scientifically as Leucaena leucocephala were modified to acrylated galactomannan (AcGA) which acted as a precursor molecule for the preparation of crosslinked galactomannan nanoparticles (CL-GA). AcGA was synthesized using acryloyl chloride (AC) as a chemical modifier through esterification process. Trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) was used as the crosslinker for the preparation of CL-GA. Successful conjugation of GA with acrylates was verified by 1H NMR and FTIR spectroscopies. Thermal properties of pure galactomannan, AcGA and CL-GA were measured using DSC to complement spectroscopic results. TEM images revealed the particle size of AcGA to be in the range of 30-100 nm; and increased to 200-850 nm range after the crosslinking process. Efficiency of CL-GA to trap crystal violet dye as a model drug was followed by UV Vis Spectroscopy. Results showed that CLGA is capable of trapping crystal violet dye and has the potential to be used as a drug carrier. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the effect of inversion of Prosopis juliflora and Leucaena leucocephala fence posts, in distribution, penetration and retention of copper chrome borate (CCB) solution applied by sap displacement method. The Prosopis juliflora was collected in Brazilian Agricultural Research Company (EMBRAPA) and the Leucaena leucocephala at the Federal University of Campina Grande in Patos, Paraíba state, Brazil. Trees with DAP from 5.0 to 10.0 cm were employed. Disks of 2.0 cm of thickness were retired on the top and on the base of pieces. The external disks were then discarded and the intern ones were employed to determine the wood characteristics, being the round pieces with 2.0 m. A solution of 2% of active ingredients of CCB was used to treated woods. A total of 10 pieces of each species were treated, and five of them remained in the solution for 8 days and the five ones had their tops inverted after the sixth day of treatment. The pieces were seasoned; disks of 2.0 cm of thickness were taken in 5 positions along of pieces and the analyses for determination of copper and boron penetration took place. The values of wood characteristics indicated that the pieces were homogeneous. The absorption of the solution was of 19.9 liters (Prosopis juliflora) and of 17.0 liters (Leucaena leucocephala). The nominal retentions of CCB were 7.72 and 5.34 kg active ingredients (a.i.)/m3, respectively. In general, the inversion of the pieces in the preservative solution is recommended, by providing a better distribution, penetration and retention of CCB on treated pieces.

AB  - To develop silvicultural methods for dipterocarp species in degraded lands in a tropical monsoon climate, we examined uneven-aged forest management, in which dipterocarp trees were planted under nurse trees, by monitoring their growth for 20 years. In 1989, seedlings of four dipterocarp species (Dipterocarpus alatus, D. turbinatus, Hopea odorata and Shorea henryana) were planted beneath a 3-year-old Leucaena leucocephala plantation and in an open site in Sakaerat, north-east Thailand. The survival rate and tree size of the dipterocarp seedlings were monitored at both sites until 1995. Surand svival rates of the dipterocarp trees were significantly better under the Leucaena plantation. However, no apparent difference was observed in basal area between both sites, since saw vigorous growth of the surviving seedlings compensated for the loss of dead seedlings at the open site. Our results showed that D. alatus and H. odorata could be planted in an open site due to the vigorous growth of the seedlings, but that it was preferable to plant D. turbinatus beneath nurse trees. The Leucaena plantation was partially thinned to 50, 75 and 100% (clear-cut) in 1993, and the survival rate and growth of the dipterocarps was monitored until 2009. Thinning had no apparent effect on the survival rates of the dipterocarp seedlings. Although relative growth rates (RGR) of the dipterocarps reduced after thinning, thinning rates did not affect the growth of the dipterocarps. After thinning, dipterocarp trees overtook Leucaena in height at all thinning rates, possibly from 1999. An uneven-aged system combining Leucaena and dipterocarp trees is likely to be applicable to several dipterocarp species.

AB  - Forest trees are renewable sources of food, fodder, fuel wood, timber and other valuable non-timber products. The ever increasing human and livestock populations have put heavy demands for plant products, resulting in over exploitation of forest trees. Therefore, there is an urgent need for conservation of germplasm and also for propagation of a sustainable utilization of forest trees. Micropropagation of tree species offers a rapid means of producing clonal planting stock for afforestation, woody biomass production and conservation of elite and rare germplasm. This review provides an overview of the success achieved on in vitro work done for a number of important forest trees. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

AB  - To solve the water pollution problem by arsenic contamination resulting from human technological activities has for long presented a challenge. Biosorbents shows better efficiency and multiple reuses to increase their economic attractiveness. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) technology is a robust artificial intelligence technology that can handle the complex and dynamic nature of adsorption processes. A single layer ANN model was developed to predict the sorption efficiency of arsenic species from water bodies using Leucaena leucocephala seed powder. Batch experiments resulted into standardization of optimum conditions: biosorbent dosage (4.0 g), arsenic concentration (25 mg/L), volume (200 mL) at pH 7.5 for As (III) and 2.5 for As (V). Back-Propagation and Lenvenberg-Marquardt techniques are used to train various neural network architectures and the accuracy of the obtained models have been examined by using test data set. The optimal neural network architectures of this process contain 14 neurons with minimum mean squared error. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was found best of BP algorithms with a minimum mean squared error for training and cross validation as 1.63694 × 10-5 and 0.000157767 respectively. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Angiospermic caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) conventionally catalyzes the methylation of caffeic acid as well as 5-hydroxy ferulic acid to ferulic acid and sinapic acid, respectively, using S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) as methyl group donor. A cDNA of OMT from Leucaena leucocephala (LlOMT) was cloned, expressed and purified. The expressed protein was purified to homogeneity on Ni-NTA agarose column with specific activity of 450 nmol of ferulic acid formed/min/mg protein. Native molecular weight of the purified enzyme was found to be 80 kDa and that of subunit molecular weight was found to be 40 kDa, suggesting the homodimeric nature of the enzyme. The optimum temperature and pH was found to be 37 °C and pH 8.0, respectively. Apparent Km of enzyme for caffeic acid and SAM was found to be 220 μM and 2.12 μM, respectively. In view of overlapping/metabolic grid concept of methylation of substrates in phenyl propanoid pathway, an in silico approach was used to look into it. Accordingly, the LlOMT protein was modeled and docked with 16 putative substrates (intermediates of phenyl propanoid/monolignol biosynthesis pathway). In silico analyses revealed that the Co-A ester substrates were most favored among those of substrates, analyzed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We estimate the effective Navier-slip length for flow over a spray-fabricated liquid-repellent surface which supports a composite solid-air-liquid interface or 'Cassie-Baxter' state. The morphology of the coated substrate consists of randomly distributed corpuscular microstructures which encapsulate a film of trapped air (or 'plastron') upon contact with liquid. The reduction in viscous skin friction due to the plastron is evaluated using torque measurements in a parallel plate rheometer resulting in a measured slip length of bslip ≈ 39 μm, comparable to the mean periodicity of the microstructure evaluated from confocal fluorescence microscopy. The introduction of a large primary length-scale using dual-textured spray-coated meshes increases the magnitude of the effective slip length to values in the range 94 μm ≤ bslip ≤ 213 μm depending on the geometric features of the mesh. The wetted solid fractions on each mesh are calculated from free surface simulations on model sinusoidal mesh geometries. The trend in measured values of bslip with the mesh periodicity L and the computed wetted solid-fraction rs are found to be consistent with existing analytic predictions. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The effects of including leucena leaf (FFL) or cunhã (FC) hay into diet on performance and egg quality of 100 Hisex Brown (64 weeks old) laying hens were compared. Birds were distributed into a completely randomized design with five treatments and five replicates of 4 birds each. The treatments were designed in a factorial 2 × 2 + 1, which evaluated the factors energy source (corn or sorghum) and type of hay (leucena or cunhã) and an a control diet based on corn and soybean meal without inclusion of hay. The trial lasted 63 days (three periods of 21 days), during which the birds received feed and water ad libitum. Treatments did significantly affect, neither production, weight, mass, component proportion and Haugh units of eggs, nor feed conversion. However, laying hens fed ration without hay (control diet) had the lowest consumption. The inclusion of FFL, in the diet containing corn or sorghum, resulted in higher yolk pigmentation than inclusion of FC. The inclusion of FFL or FC, independent of the grain utilized as an energy source, results in a similar performance, but FFL increased yolk pigmentation capacity.

AB  - Conventional cattle ranching in Latin America has been based mostly on extensive pasture monocultures planted with minimum tree cover. The current trend towards replacing treeless pastures with silvopastoral systems that include tree and shrub species enhances productivity and provides environmental services within these systems. We studied the ant fauna in cattle farms at La Vieja river basin, Colombia, with the aim of analyzing the relations between tree cover and ant species diversity and composition in different land uses in this cattle-dominated landscape. Monitoring was performed between 2004 and 2007 in 21 plots representing seven contrasting land uses characteristic of this Andean landscape. Ants were sampled with baits (arboreal and ground) and pitfall traps. A total of 68,860 individuals belonging to 227 ant species was recorded. Ant diversity was positively related to the presence of woody vegetation. The largest number of ant species was found in secondary forests followed by improved pastures with trees. Pastures without trees had less than half the number of ant species in pastures with trees. Ant species richness in intensive Leucaena leucocephala (Mimosaceae) silvopastoral systems also surpassed that recorded in treeless pastures. This study provides evidence supporting the conservation value of silvopastoral systems at the landscape level in the Colombian Andes. The conservation of forest fragments in this area is vital, as they provide refuge for a unique regional ant fauna. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of temperature and adult nutrition on the development of Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus, a natural enemy of an invasive tree, Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2013

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabales: Fabaceae; leucaena) is an exceptionally invasive weed in South-East Asia (due to its long flowering period and excessive seed output) causing considerable economic losses in Taiwan. A seed predator originating from Central America and inadvertently introduced to South-East Asia, Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae), is considered to be a potential augmentative biocontrol agent to check the spread of leucaena. To evaluate the feasibility of using A. macrophthalmus for biological control we investigated its development under six constant temperatures (15-35°C). The relationship between temperature and developmental rate was evaluated using three developmental models of which the Brière model was the best fit for the empirical data. The lower developmental threshold (T0), estimated by linear regression, was 12.8°C. The thermal constant was 632.8 degree-days (DD) for total development (egg to adult emergence). The proportion of females was highest and lowest at the extreme temperatures, 15°C (100%) and 31°C (36.4%), respectively. Given the compatibility between its bionomic parameters (the optimal temperature for development and highest proportion of females) and the local daily average temperatures in Taiwan, augmentative annual releases of beetles to restrict the spread of L. leucocephala appear to be a promising solution. Given the finding that the adult of A. macrophthalmus can effectively elongate its life span and increase its population densities by feeding on nutrient supplements in the field (e.g., saccharose), we infer that A. macrophthalmus can be used effectively for restricting the expansion of L. leucocephala in an integrated control program. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Dengue fever causes mortality and morbidity around the world, specifically in the Tropics and subtropic regions, which has been of major concern to governments and the World Health Organization (WHO). As a consequence, the search for new anti-dengue agents from medicinal plants has assumed more urgency than in the past. Medicinal plants have been used widely to treat a variety of vector ailments such as malaria. The demand for plant-based medicines is growing as they are generally considered to be safer, non-toxic and less harmful than synthetic drugs. This article reviews potential anti-dengue activities from plants distributed around the world. Sixty-nine studies from 1997 to 2012 describe 31 different species from 24 families that are known for their anti-dengue activities. About ten phytochemicals have been isolated from 11 species, among which are compounds with the potential for development of dengue treatment. Crude extracts and essential oils obtained from 31 species showed a broad activity against Flavivirus. Current studies show that natural products represent a rich potential source of new anti-dengue compounds. Further ethnobotanical surveys and laboratory investigations are needed established the potential of identified species in contributing to dengue control. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the effects of a phosphate-solubilizing fungus (Mortierella sp.) and an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Glomus fistulosum (Skou and Jakobsen)) in enhancing plant Pi uptake and growth of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) grown in an Oxisol fertilized with graded amounts of rock phosphate (RP). For this purpose, a surface soil sample was fertilized with four levels of the Huila RP (P = 0, 150, 300, and 600 mg·kg-1) and inoculated with none, one, or both fungi. In the unfertilized soil, leucaena plants grew poorly and there was no plant response to individual or dual inoculation. When RP was added G. fistulosum significantly increased plant Pi uptake and growth, the effect of inoculation was significantly higher at the P levels of 300-600 mg·kg-1. Mortierella sp. was highly effective in increasing plant P uptake and growth of mycorrhizal leucaena, but it was ineffective in nonmycorrhizal leucaena across the RP gradient. The synergistic effects of dual inoculation were more evident on plant Pi uptake than on growth. The results indicate that the phosphate-solubilizing fungus effect was limited by soil Pi sorption. This limitation likely was overcome by the mycorrhizal association, which allowed a more efficient capture of the Pi released due to RP dissolution.

AB  - The nipple array is a submicrometre-scale structure found on the cuticle surfaces of various invertebrate taxa. Corneal nipples are an antiglare surface in nocturnal insects, but the functional significance of the nipple array has not been experimentally investigated for aquatic organisms. Using nanopillar sheets as a mimetic model of the nipple array, we demonstrated that significantly fewer bubbles adhered to the nanopillar surface versus a flat surface when the sheets were hydrophilic. Many more bubbles adhered to the hydrophobic surface than the hydrophilic surfaces. Bubbles on the body surface may cause buoyancy problems, movement interference and water flow occlusion. Here, bubble repellence is proposed as a function of the hydrophilic nipple array in aquatic invertebrates and its properties are considered based on bubble adhesion energy. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - The allelopathic effect of leaf exteracts of of selected terrestrial plants on seed germination of some agricultural crops were investigated. For certain plants, the seed germination decreased in comparison with control (treated with distilled water) while in some cases it increased or remained the same as that of control.The plants which exhibited a decreased seed germination in comparison with the control were proposed to posess allelopathic effect . Thus it can be concluded that the plants that exhibited an allelopathic effect can be used as a potential candidate for isolation and identification of allelochemicals, which would be helpful to be developed as organic herbicides that are environmentally safe and less cost effective. © 2009, JGPT.

AB  - The present study was conducted to assess the supplementary effect of tropical browse species leaves on feed intake, nutrients utilization, rumen metabolites and water kinetics of goats fed Dichanthium annulatum grass based diets. In an experiment 4 adult male local goats, weighing 30.0±2.1 kg, were fed Dichanthium annulatum-Hardwickia binata (DAHB), Dichanthium annulatum-Securegeia virosa (DA-SV), Dichanthium annulatum-Leucaena leucocephala (DA-LL) and Dichanthium annulatum-Helectris isora (DA-HI) grass: tree leaves diets in 50: 50 ratios in 4 separate feeding trials. A digestion-cum-metabolism trial was conducted to determine intake, nutrients utilization and nitrogen (N) balance. Rumen liquor was collected at 0 and 4 h feeding after 60 and 90 days of feeding to estimate rumen metabolites, while for water kinetics rumen liquor was drawn once at 90 days of feeding from an individual goat in each trial. DMI of goats was highest on DA-HI and lowest on DA-HB diet. Goats exhibited higher digestibility of CP, NDF, ADF and cellulose on DA-HI than other diets. Faecal N loss was higher from DA-LL, while urinary N loss was more from DA-HI and DALL. N balance (g/d) was highest in DA-LL and lowest in DA-HB. Goats had higher eating rate at first and fourth hour of feeding on tested diets, while meal consumption was highest on DA-LL and lowest on DA-HB diet. Goat rumen liquor had higher TVFA and N metabolites on DA-LL. Goats exhibited higher dilution rate and out flow rate on DA-HI and DA-LL diets than DA-SV and DA-HB diets. Results revealed that goats had higher DMI and nutrients digestibility on DA-HI and DA-SV diets, while N balance and rumen metabolites production was more on DA-LL diets.

AB  - This study indicates that coal ash contains micro and macro nutrients that improve physical and morphological properties of the soil for plantation of forest tree species. The prospects of using Thermal power Plant coal ash/Fly ash in forestry species with fly ash and pond ash as source of plantation is the key objective of current study. The Physico-chemical analysis of plant species for dykes and controlled areas done with regard to their different body parts (i.e. Leaf, Branch and Root). Usually fly ash contains essential plant nutrients except N, at higher concentration than that in ordinary cropland soils. Water retention capacity of soil, together with release of nutrient elements such as Na, Ca, Mg, N, P, K, Cu and Zn have increased considerably by admixing appropriate quantity of coal ash with soil. An attempt was made with the help of current study by physico-chemical analysis of some Tropical forest tree species such as Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala), Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) and Sisam (Dalbargia sisso) in Thermal Power Plant Fly Ash Dyke area as well as in controlled area. Overall the density of those more or less matches with that of biomass results. The results, in totality, are reflections of very complex metabolic activity and outcome in two very contrasting nourishing media, i.e. normal soil and Fly Ash. Three different species were compared together for their surviving and sustainable growth in fly ash gives us clear results, that Dalbargia sisso has better adoptability as compare to Azadirachta indica and Leucaena leucocephala. © EM International Printed in India.

TI  - Efficacy, persistence and presence of Synergistes jonesii in cattle grazing leucaena in Queensland: On-farm observations pre- and post-inoculation
PY  - 2013
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883731041&doi=10.1071%2fAN12301&partnerID=40&md5=eb07aef688ecafc0f225ade06a76c8a8
AB  - A study of eight commercial cattle herds grazing leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata) pastures was undertaken to determine (1) the efficacy of in vitro Synergistes jonesii inoculum (produced in an anaerobic fermenter) in degrading the dihydroxypyridone (DHP) isomers produced during digestion of leucaena forage; and (2) the persistence of the inoculum in the rumen of cattle following a period grazing non-leucaena pastures. Cattle were introduced to the leucaena pastures for an initial period varying from 17 to 71 days. Fourteen to fifteen animals were then sampled for (1) urine and blood plasma to determine toxicity status as indicated by concentration of DHP; (2) faeces for estimation of diet composition; and (3) rumen fluid for detection of S. jonesii by nested polymerase PCR analysis. After a further 42-56 days, animals were resampled as before to confirm toxicity status and inoculated with the in vitro S. jonesii inoculum; the herds were then sampled a third time (42-60 days after inoculation) to test the effectiveness of the inoculum in degrading DHP. Five of the herds were then removed from leucaena pastures for periods ranging from 80 to 120 days and returned to leucaena pastures for 21 days to check persistence of the inoculum as indicated by retention of capacity to degrade DHP. The data indicated (1) a very slow build up of capacity to degrade DHP isomers on some properties before inoculation; (2) frequent occurrence of high levels of 2,3-DHP in urine indicating partial toxin degradation, both before and after inoculation; (3) a low incidence of detection of S. jonesii in rumen fluid after inoculation based on nested PCR analysis; (4) failure of inoculation to degrade DHP on one of two properties tested; and (5) loss of capacity to degrade DHP on some properties after <4 months on alternative non-leucaena pastures. It was concluded that while most herds showed some capability to degrade DHP due to some residual capability from previous exposure, they did not achieve the same rapid and complete DHP degradation reported in the 1980s. Nevertheless, it was concluded that the in vitro inoculum was at least partially effective and should continue to be used by graziers until improved sources of inoculum and/or inoculation methodologies are demonstrated. © CSIRO 2013.

TI  - Rhizobium freirei sp. nov., a symbiont of Phaseolus vulgaris that is very effective at fixing nitrogen
PY  - 2013

AB  - Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) can establish symbiotic associations with several Rhizobium species; however, the effectiveness of most strains at fixing nitrogen under field conditions is very low. PRF 81T is a very effective strain, usually referred to as Rhizobium tropici and used successfully in thousands of doses of commercial inoculants for the common bean crop in Brazil; it has shown high rates of nitrogen fixation in all areas representative of the crop in the country. Here, we present results that indicate that PRF 81T, although it belongs to the 'R. tropici group', which includes 10 Rhizobium species, R. tropici, R. leucaenae, R. lusitanum, R. multihospitium, R. miluonense, R. hainanense, R. calliandrae, R. mayense, R. jaguaris and R. rhizogenes, represents a novel species. Several morpho-physiological traits differentiated PRF 81T from related species. Differences were also confirmed in the analysis of rep-PCR (sharing less than 45% similarity with the other species), MLSA with recA, atpD and rpoB genes, and DNA-DNA hybridization. The novel species, for which we propose the name Rhizobium freirei sp. nov., is able to establish effective root nodule symbioses with Phaseolus vulgaris, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena esculenta, Crotalaria juncea and Macroptilium atropurpureum. The type strain is PRF 81T (5CNPSo 122T5SEMIA 4080T5IPR-Pv81T5WDCM 440T). © 2013 IUMS.

TI  - Induction of fine roots in Leucaena leucocephala using Agrobacterium rhizogenes
PY  - 2013
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878022895&partnerID=40&md5=09ae216fbee28c7c2bf2b80bd8d63cb4
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala has been previously documented to be a potential slope plant due to its prominent tap root system. However, this plant lacks of fine roots which arguably contribute to reinforce the soil. Thus, this experiment was aimed to induce fine roots of L. leucocephala by infecting Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The A. rhizogenes was cultured under optimum nutrient conditions and injected into the hypocotyls of L. leucocephala, seedlings. The infected seedlings were transplanted into PVC pipes filled with garden soil. The plant infected by A. rhizogenes having 1.09 × 109 cfu/mL (T1) concentrations showed the highest root length of 1018 cm (83.2% fine roots) as compared to the control. The increased of overall root volume provides a greater surface area which increased (55%) the Water Absorption Capacity (WAC) significantly. The number of fine roots and root tips were increased by 106 and 261%, respectively by T1 treatment. The photosynthetic and transpiration rate also exhibited significant increment (98% at p< 0.05) in T1 than the control plants. The above findings have referred a better understanding of the effects of A. rhizogenes infection on hairy root initiation, WAC and physiological aspects of the L. leucocephala, potential slope plant. Hence, it is suggested that A. rhizogenes infection can be applied to initiate extensive fine roots, enhancing the root system of potential slope plants.

PY  - 2013
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878354711&doi=10.1007%2fs11033-012-2169-8&partnerID=40&md5=b3948ea45ffa158d02a56d023519788a
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a leguminous tree species accounting for one-fourth of raw material supplied to paper and pulp industry in India. Cinnamate 4-Hydroxylase (C4H, EC 1.14.13.11) is the second gene of phenylpropanoid pathway and a member of cytochrome P450 family. There is currently intense interest to alter or modify lignin content of L. leucocephala. Three highly similar C4H alleles of LlC4H1 gene were isolated and characterized. The alleles shared more than 98 % sequence identity at amino acid level to each other. Binding of partial promoter of another C4H gene LlC4H2, to varying amounts of crude nuclear proteins isolated from leaf and stem tissues of L. leucocephala formed two loose and one strong complex, respectively, suggesting that the abundance of proteins that bind with the partial C4H promoter is higher in stem tissue than in leaf tissue. Quantitative Real Time PCR study suggested that among tissues of same age, root tissues had highest level of C4H transcripts. Maximum transcript level was observed in 30 day old root tissue. Among the tissues investigated, C4H activity was highest in 60 day old root tissues. Tissue specific quantitative comparison of lignin from developing seedling stage to 1 year old tree stage indicated that Klason lignin increased in tissues with age. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Glycosyl hydrolase family 1 β-glucosidases are important enzymes that serve many diverse functions in plants including defense, whereby hydrolyzing the defensive compounds such as hydroxynitrile glucosides. A hydroxynitrile glucoside cleaving β-glucosidase gene (Llbglu1) was isolated from Leucaena leucocephala, cloned into pET-28a (+) and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The recombinant enzyme was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The optimal temperature and pH for this β-glucosidase were found to be 45 C and 4.8, respectively. The purified Llbglu1 enzyme hydrolyzed the synthetic glycosides, pNPGlucoside (pNPGlc) and pNPGalactoside (pNPGal). Also, the enzyme hydrolyzed amygdalin, a hydroxynitrile glycoside and a few of the tested flavonoid and isoflavonoid glucosides. The kinetic parameters K m and V max were found to be 38.59 μM and 0.8237 μM/mg/min for pNPGlc, whereas for pNPGal the values were observed as 1845 μM and 0.1037 μM/mg/min. In the present study, a three dimensional (3D) model of the Llbglu1 was built by MODELLER software to find out the substrate binding sites and the quality of the model was examined using the program PROCHEK. Docking studies indicated that conserved active site residues are Glu 199, Glu 413, His 153, Asn 198, Val 270, Asn 340, and Trp 462. Docking of rhodiocyanoside A with the modeled Llbglu1 resulted in a binding with free energy change (ΔG) of -5.52 kcal/mol on which basis rhodiocyanoside A could be considered as a potential substrate. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Mineral elements stored in seed reserves meet the nutrient demands of seedlings during their initial development and growth. We experimentally examined when seed reserves become insufficient to meet demands for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, a tropical woody legume. Seedlings were grown from seeds with four nutrient treatments: receiving all nutrients; all nutrients except N, all nutrients except P or deionised water. Growth curves were compared to quantify the time course of the onset of N and P deficiency during 8 weeks. N deficiency became significant for leaf area and biomass growth after 11 and 16 days, respectively, whereas P deficiency became significant after 31 days for both leaf area and biomass growth. Thus, seed reserves alone could support the P demands of seedlings for more than twice as long as N demands. As nutrient deficiency developed, seedlings adjusted increased relative biomass allocation to roots, diluted organ N and P concentrations but conserved 100% of the initial nutrient pool derived from the seed. © 2013 CSIRO.

AB  - The availability of local feed resources in various seasons can contribute as essential sources of carbohydrate and protein which significantly impact rumen fermentation and the subsequent productivity of the ruminant. Recent developments, based on enriching protein in cassava chips, have yielded yeast fermented cassava chip protein (YEFECAP) providing up to 47.5% crude protein (CP), which can be used to replace soybean meal. The use of fodder trees has been developed through the process of pelleting; Leucaena leucocephala leaf pellets (LLP), mulberry leaf pellets (MUP) and mangosteen peel and/or garlic pellets, can be used as good sources of protein to supplement ruminant feeding. Apart from producing volatile fatty acids and microbial proteins, greenhouse gases such as methane are also produced in the rumen. Several methods have been used to reduce rumen methane. However, among many approaches, nutritional manipulation using feed formulation and feeding management, especially the use of plant extracts or plants containing secondary compounds (condensed tannins and saponins) and plant oils, has been reported. This approach could help todecrease rumen protozoa and methanogens and thus mitigate the production of methane. At present, more research concerning this burning issue - the role of livestock in global warming - warrants undertaking further research with regard to economic viability and practical feasibility. © 2013 Wanapat et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The corrosion of the mild steel in 1 mol/L H2SO4 was investigated using Leucaena leucocephala pod extract (LLPE) as corrosion inhibitor by weight loss and electrochemical techniques. Inhibition efficiency of 95% was achieved with 500×10-6 of LLPE at 308 K. The polarization studies showed that LLPE acted as mixed type inhibitor. The adsorption of the studied inhibitor on mild steel obeyed Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Protective film formation against acid attack was confirmed by FT-IR, XRD and SEM techniques. © The Chinese Society for Metals and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The toxicity effects of heavy metals (lead and cadmium) on germination, root length and dry biomass of tree species viz., Thespesia populneoides, Leucaena leucocephala and Delonex regia were evaluated. Cadmium was found to be more toxic than lead. The results further showed that dose response of heavy metals were inversely proportional to germination, root growth and dry biomass. The percentage germination and higher % DFC values showed that the seeds of L. leucocephala were least affected by lead and cadmium toxicity while scoring the best germination response among the three tree species. Exposure to high concentration (125ppm) of Cd decreased the root size of L. leucocephala, T. populneoides and D. regia by 89.79, 71.8 and 62.26% respectively. However, at the same concentration, lead inhibited the root growth (39.62%) in case of D. regia while much higher reduction was observed for L. leucocephala and T. populneoides around 62.7%. Furthermore, the % phytotoxicity and tolerance index confirmed that D. regia appeared to be the most tolerant species whereas, T. populneoides and L. leucocephala were moderately tolerant and less tolerant species respectively against the Pb and Cd treatment. This study gives an insight to the possible mechanism of hypertolerance, signifying that trees can be successfully used for phytoremediation.

AB  - The intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance and energetic balance were evaluated in sheep diets consisting of hay from Tifton 85 grass at two ages of regrowth (28 and 42 days) and hay from leucaena at 40 days of regrowth, in the proportions of 20 and 40%. Twenty Santa Inês sheep, kept in metabolic cages, were used in a randomised block design according to body weight. The hay from the Tifton 85 grass, processed at 28 days of regrowth, resulted in a higher CP intake than when processed at 42 days of regrowth. There was higher protein intake for the 40% proportion of leucaena hay in relation to that of 20%, regardless of the regrowth age of the grass. Diets containing Tifton 85 grass processed at 28 days resulted in greater values for both DE and ME. There was greater intake, absorption and urinary excretion of N, and a lower Nfaecal to Nurinary ratio, with diets containing Tifton 85 grass processed at 28 days, as well as with those diets containing 40% leucaena hay. When formulating sheep diets containing hay from Tifton 85 grass processed at 28 days of regrowth and combined with 20% hay from leucaena, the grass, despite showing good energetic value, is not enough to provide full use of the nitrogen available to the ruminant, making it necessary need to find combinations with concentrated food sources which are able to optimise the use of nitrogen, reduce environmental impact and maximise sheep production.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a new introduction into Pakistan, as a fast growing tree with many properties of economic importance. In this it was decided to produce some mutants of the species with the help of X-rays radiations, with the object that, (a) any of the mutants may prove to be more suitable and useful than the original parents and (b) the mutants thus raised may provide breeding material to the future breeders. With this object, young seedlings, moist seeds and dry seeds of the species were subjected to the X-rays treatment. The young seedlings died after the treatment, the moist seeds failed to germinate; in both these cases X-rays were lethal enough to cause the death. However, in the third lot where treatment was given to the dry seeds 61% of the seeds germinated, but only 36% finally survived. The surviving 36% exhibited certain morphological anatomical and physiological variations, indicating occurrence of some degree mutation of their genetic material. If these mutants survived, then, in the year to come more variation will appear in them as they will reach maturity. At this stage, it will be quite premature to speculate about their values of economic importance and usefulness, except that they may probably provide genetic material to any of the interested plant breeders in future.

TI  - Leguminous plants nodulated by selected strains of Cupriavidus necator grow in heavy metal contaminated soils amended with calcium silicate

AB  - Increasing concern regarding mining area environmental contamination with heavy metals has resulted in an emphasis of current research on phytoremediation. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficiency of symbiotic Cupriavidus necator strains on different leguminous plants in soil contaminated with heavy metals following the application of inorganic materials. The application of limestone and calcium silicate induced a significant increase in soil pH, with reductions in zinc and cadmium availability of 99 and 94 %, respectively. In addition, improved nodulation of Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia, Leucaena leucocephala and Mimosa pudica in soil with different levels of contamination was observed. Significant increases in the nitrogen content of the aerial parts of the plant were observed upon nodulation of the root system of Leucaena leucocephala and Mimosa pudica by strain UFLA01-659 (36 and 40 g kg-1) and by strain UFLA02-71 in Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia (39 g kg-1). The alleviating effect of calcium silicate resulted in higher production of dry matter from the aerial part of the plant, an increase in nodule number and an increase in the nitrogen fixation rate. The results of the present study demonstrate that the combination of rhizobia, leguminous plants and calcium silicate may represent a key factor in the remediation of areas contaminated by heavy metals. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Structure, histochemistry and chemical composition of tension (TW), opposite (OW) and normal wood (NW) of Leucaena leucocephala have been studied using histological, histochemical and biochemical methods. TW vessels are longer and have a larger diameter than NW vessels, and the rays are shorter and thinner. The G-layer replaced S3 and parts of S2 wall layers in TW fibres. TW further contained less lignin that also had a lower syringyl-to-guaiacyl ratio. The lignin was also more condensed. The content of α-cellulose was high in TW. TW contains hemicelluloses and pectins composed of more galactose, and less xylose, mannose, 4-O-methylglucuronic acid and galacturonic acid compared to that of OW. This study suggests that in the TW of Leucaena, the amount and composition of lignin, hemicelluloses and pectins differ considerably from that in OW and NW. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Nutrient Digestibility of Reduced-Soybean-Meal Diets Containing Moringa or Leucaena Leaf Meals for Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus
PY  - 2014

AB  - Vegetable leaf meals are cheaper feed ingredients than soybean meal (SBM) in developing countries, and leaf meals are less important as human food. We evaluated the nutrient digestibility of practical diets containing reduced levels of SBM in combination with leaf meals made from Moringa oleifera and Leucaena leucocephala in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Five isonitrogenous diets (32% crude protein) were made: the control diet contained 50% SBM, and the test diets were made by substituting 15 or 30% of SBM protein with either Moringa or Leucaena. Dry matter, protein, and lipid digestibility decreased with increasing Moringa or Leucaena in the diet. Protein and lipid digestibility were high across diets (75-90%). Ash digestibility of the control diet was similar to that of both Moringa diets, while the ash digestibility of the Leucaena diets was lower than other diets. Overall, nutrient digestibilities of Moringa diets exceeded those of Leucaena diets. Dry matter, protein, and lipid digestibilities decreased with increasing dietary fiber, which increased with increasing leaf meals. Ash digestibility was generally low for all diets. Better digestibility of practical diets containing Moringa compared to Leucaena indicates greater potential for Moringa to replace SBM in Nile tilapia diets without compromising fish performance. © by the World Aquaculture Society 2014.

AB  - The rhizobium-legume symbiosis is a model system for studying mutualistic interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes. Sinorhizobium sp. NGR234 is distinguished by its ability to form either indeterminate nodules or determinate nodules with diverse legumes. Here, we presented a high-resolution RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of NGR234 bacteroids in indeterminate nodules of Leucaena leucocephala and determinate nodules of Vigna unguiculata. In contrast to exponentially growing free-living bacteria, non-growing bacteroids from both legumes recruited several common cellular functions such as cbb3 oxidase, thiamine biosynthesis, nitrate reduction pathway (NO-producing), succinate metabolism, PHB (poly-3-hydroxybutyrate) biosynthesis and phosphate/phosphonate transporters. However, different transcription profiles between bacteroids from two legumes were also uncovered for genes involved in the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, T3SS (type three secretion system) and effector proteins, cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase, PQQ (pyrroloquinoline quinone), cytochrome c550, pseudoazurin, biotin, phasins and glycolate oxidase, and in the metabolism of glutamate and phenylalanine. Noteworthy were the distinct expression patterns of genes encoding phasins, which are thought to be involved in regulating the surface/volume ratio of PHB granules. These patterns are in good agreement with the observed granule size difference between bacteroids from L. leucocephala and V. unguiculata. © 2013 Li et al.

TI  - A carbon-nitrogen lyase from Leucaena leucocephala catalyzes the first step of mimosine degradation
PY  - 2014
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893439756&doi=10.1104%2fpp.113.230870&partnerID=40&md5=e165e9a9c75177d6e1423498b52486ae
AB  - The tree legume Leucaena leucocephala contains a large amount of a toxic nonprotein aromatic amino acid, mimosine, and also an enzyme, mimosinase, for mimosine degradation. In this study, we isolated a 1,520-bp complementary DNA (cDNA) for mimosinase from L. leucocephala and characterized the encoded enzyme for mimosine-degrading activity. The deduced amino acid sequence of the coding region of the cDNA was predicted to have a chloroplast transit peptide. The nucleotide sequence, excluding the sequence for the chloroplast transit peptide, was codon optimized and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme was used in mimosine degradation assays, and the chromatogram of the major product was found to be identical to that of 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (3H4P), which was further verified by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. The enzyme activity requires pyridoxal 5′-phosphate but not α-keto acid; therefore, the enzyme is not an aminotransferase. In addition to 3H4P, we also identified pyruvate and ammonia as other degradation products. The dependence of the enzyme on pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and the production of 3H4P with the release of ammonia indicate that it is a carbon-nitrogen lyase. It was found to be highly efficient and specific in catalyzing mimosine degradation, with apparent Km and Vmax values of 1.16 × 10-4 M and 5.05 × 10-5 mol s-1 mg-1, respectively. The presence of other aromatic amino acids, including L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, and L-tryptophan, in the reaction did not show any competitive inhibition. The isolation of the mimosinase cDNA and the biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzyme will be useful in developing transgenic L. leucocephala with reduced mimosine content in the future. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

AB  - Soil erosion has resulted in serious land degradation in Yuanmou dry-hot valley, Yunnan province, China. Vegetation restoration had been widely developed in this hot and arid area. In this work we investigate the quality of rhizosphere soils under four restoration species in the towns of Zuolin (gully bed) and Yuanma (slope area). The vegetation included two trees [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. and Eucalyptus camaldulensis L.] for the slope area, one shrubland [Dodonaea viscosa (Linn.) Jacq. Enum.] and one native, natural grassland [Heteropogon contortus (L.) Beauv.] for gully bed. Soil physical (bulk density and soil moisture content), chemical [pH, soil organic matter, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) contents], and microbial (microbial biomass and microbe quantity) properties and soil enzyme (catalase, protease and urease) activities were determined. Compared to the soils collected from other vegetation types, the soil under Leucaena leucocephala had the highest content of soil organic matter, total N, available N, total P, available P, available K, microbial biomass carbon (C), and the highest microbe quantity and enzyme activities. Five parameters (organic matter, pH, microbial biomass N, total K and protease activity), which had the greatest weight in the principal components analysis, were selected to calculate the soil quality index (SQI). The final SQI values implied that restoring Leucaena leucocephala greatly improved the soil quality, while restoration with Eucalyptus camaldulensis decreased the soil quality of the slope area. Plant recovery with Dodonaea viscosa and Heteropogon contortus on the gully bed affected the population of soil microbial communities but didn't improve the SQI values. It can therefore be seen that types of plants used for recovery in gully-developed regions in dry-hot valleys must be chosen cautiously: Leucaena leucocephala is a good choice for soil revegetation of the slope area, but the revegetation patterns on the gully bed still need further study. © 2013 Copyright Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.

AB  - To predict the properties of superamphiphobic layers we analyzed the wetting of a square and a hexagonal array of vertical pillars composed of spheres (radius R) partially sintered together. Apparent contact angles above 150°are obtained by pinning of a non-polar liquid surface at the underside of the top sphere resulting in a Fakir or Cassie state. Analytical equations are derived for the impalement pressure in the limiting case A0 ≫ R2, where A0 is the area of the regular unit cell containing a single pillar. The case of close pillars is investigated numerically. By balancing forces at the rim of a drop, we calculate the apparent receding contact angle. To describe drag reduction of a flowing liquid we calculate the apparent slip length. When considering pressure-induced flow through cylindrical capillaries of radius rc, significant drag reduction occurs only for thin capillaries. The mechanical stability with respect to normal forces and shear is analyzed. Nanoscopic silica glass pillars would be able to sustain the normal and shear stresses caused by capillary and drag forces. For a high impalement pressure and good mechanical stability A 0 should be small and R (respectively the neck diameter) should be large, whereas a large A0 and a small R imply low contact angle hysteresis and high slip length. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

AB  - The effect of exogenous ethephon on cambial activity, xylem production and ray population in young shoots of Leucaena leucocephala was investigated anatomically. The application of ethephon showed a diphasic effect on cambial activity and xylogenesis in a dose dependent manner. Lower concentration of ethephon enhanced cambial activity while high concentrations reduced cambial cell divisions and daughter-cell differentiation. High ethephon concentration also resulted in shorter vessel elements, thick walled fibers and phenolic accumulation in ray cells and vessel elements, whereas low concentration allowed elongation of fibers and vessel elements. The density of rays increased significantly with increase in ethylene concentration. The evaluation of longitudinal sections of cambial zone in ethephon treated plants showed high frequency of transformation of fusiform initials into ray initials through divisions and segmentation, resulting in high ray frequency in both xylem and phloem. The present study demonstrates that ethylene plays an important role in regulating secondary vascular tissue composition by reducing the population of fusiform initials in the cambium. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The effect of exogenous application of growth regulators (IAA, NAA, GA 3 and BAP) on xylogenesis has been investigated in actively growing shoots of Leucaena leucocephala by anatomical methods. Auxins are (both IAA and NAA) found to be the key regulators of differentiation of narrow lumen vessels and tracheids. These elements were derived not only from fusiform cambial cells, but also from axial parenchyma through transdifferentiation. The exogenous feeding of GA3 induced differentiation of gelatinous fibres, deformed vessels, elongated thin walled fibres and a high fibre/vessel ratio. BAP application decreased the cambial activity and cell differentiation process resulting in development of thick walled fibres and vessel elements, and also delayed lignification of cell walls. The application of combination of hormones showed both synergistic and antagonistic nature of interaction among different hormones. Combination of GA3 and auxins induced cambial cell division and relatively fast differentiation of xylem, while increasing concentrations of GA3 over auxins induced differentiation of gelatinous fibres. The combination of high concentration of BAP either with auxins or with GA 3 slowed down cambial activity and xylem differentiation. Moderate concentrations of BAP and GA3 induced gelatinous fibres with thick gelatinous layer indicating the synergistic effect of both hormones.

TI  - Leucaena leucocephala leachate compromised membrane integrity, respiration and Antioxidative Defence of water hyacinth leaf tissues

AB  - Background: Water hyacinth is an invasive aquatic weed in many regions of the world. In this study, the bioherbicidal potential of allelopathic plant Leucaena leucocephala against water hyacinth was investigated using a leaf disc assay. Results: L. leucocephala leachate enhanced electrolyte leakage from water hyacinth leaf discs in a concentrationdependent manner. Control experiments eliminated the possibilities that increased membrane permeability in the leachate-treated leaf discs was due to pH or osmotic effects of the leachate. Thus, the loss of membrane stability in the leachate-treated leaf discs was likely due to phytotoxins detected in the leachate, namely mimosine and phenolic constituents. Decline in tissue respiration was detected in leachate-treated water hyacinth leaf discs. This suggests that the L. leucocephala leachate may contain compounds which acted as respiratory inhibitors. Enhanced reactive oxygen species production coincided with inhibition of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activities in the leachate-treated water hyacinth leaf tissues. The injurious effects of L. leucocephala leachate on water hyacinth leaf discs probably involved direct inhibition of antioxidant enzymes in addition to direct involvement of some allelochemicals in reactive oxygen species formation. Conclusion: In summary, the toxic effects of L. leucocephala leachate on water hyacinth leaf discs likely lay in its ability to effectively compromise the membrane integrity, tissue respiration and antioxidant defence of the latter. © 2013 Chai et al.; licensee Springer.

TI  - Effects of biochar on soil properties and erosion potential in a highly weathered soil
PY  - 2013

AB  - Highly weathered soils in humid Asia are characterized by low soil fertility and high soil erosion potential. This study evaluates the influences of biochar made from the waste wood of white lead trees (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) on the physicochemical and biological properties of long-term cultivated, acidic Ultisol. This study used three application rates (0%, 2.5%, and 5% (wt/wt)) of the biochar with an incubation time of 105d for all cases. Soils were collected at 21d, 42d, 63d, 84d and 105d during the incubation period to evaluate changes in soil properties over time. A simulated rainfall event (80mmh-1) was performed to estimate soil loss for all treatments at the end of the incubation time. Experimental results indicate that applying biochar improved the physicochemical and biological properties of the highly weathered soils, including significant increases in soil pH from 3.9 to 5.1, cation exchange capacity from 7.41 to 10.8cmol (+) kg-1, base cation percentage from 6.40 to 26.0%, and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) from 835 to 1262mgkg-1. Compared with the control (i.e., no biochar), biochar application decreased bulk density from 1.4 to 1.1Mgm-3, increased Ksat by 1.8 times and increased the mean weight diameter (MWD) of soil aggregates from 2.6cm to 4.0cm. Incorporating biochar into the soil significantly reduced soil loss by 50% and 64% at 2.5% and 5% application rates, respectively, compared with the control. The formation of macroaggregates in the biochar-amended soils is the critical factor to improve soil erosion potential. Based on these results, a 5% application rate of biochar is considered as suitable for highly weathered soil because this application rate efficiently improves soil physiochemical properties and reduces soil loss. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - A long-term experiment was conducted to assess the performance of stocker ram lambs utilizing stockpiled foliage and forage from established Leucaena leucocephala-based silvopastoral system vis-à-vis natural pasture. The treatments were: (1) stockpiled foliage and forage in a L. leucocephala-based silvipasture (silvipasture) and (2) stockpiled forage in a natural grasslands (natural) consisting primarily Sehima nervosum, Heteropogon contortus, Dichanthium annulatum and Chrysopogon fulvus. Deccani ram lambs (36) were allowed to graze in both the treatment pastures from mid September to late March during 2006-09. Each treatment was replicated three times in a completely randomized design. Total forage production, nutrient contents and lambs average daily gain (ADG) was significantly (P<0.01) higher in silvipasture than natural pasture. Silvipasture system (4.11 t/ha) produced more (P<0.01) forage than the natural pasture (1.36 t/ha). When the foliage of L. leucocephala was excluded, the silvipasture system still produced higher (P<0.01) crude protein (CP) than natural pasture. Average daily gain (P<0.01) was 87.2 g for the ram lambs in the silvipasture and 59.1 g for the ram lambs in the natural pasture. Lambs weight gain per ha was greater (P<0.01) in the silvipasture than in the natural pasture (236 vs. 160 kg) over the grazing season. The study showed that the stockpiled foliage and forage from the silvopastoral system would meet the nutrient requirements of ram lambs even during drier months of the year.

AB  - A laboratory study was used to compare the food consumption and survival of Oncideres pustulata LeConte adults that fed on huisache, Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd., leucaena, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, or both host plants. Longevity and food consumption differed significantly only among food plants, and no significant two-or three-way interactions were found. Longevity of O. pustulata was significantly greater on leucaena (77.6 days) than huisache (35.4 days). However, adults fed both host plants survived longer (90.3 days) than those that fed on either host plant alone. Total food consumption was more than two-fold greater in leucaena alone and leucaena + huisache than in huisache alone. However, daily consumption did not differ significantly among food regimes. When both huisache and leucaena were provided simultaneously, leucaena comprised an average of 67% of the total food consumed. Adult size was positively associated with average daily consumption, but not with longevity. Greater survival of O. pustulata on leucaena was attributed to better nutritional value and greater energy content compared to huisache. The greater longevity of O. pustulata fed on both leucaena and huisache probably reflects complementarity among amino acids and minerals contained in each host plant.

AB  - This study presents the first results from Brazil using SF6 tracer technique adapted from cattle to evaluate the capability of condensed tannin (CT) present in three tropical legume forages, Leucaena leucocephala (LEU), Styzolobium aterrimum (STA), and Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth (MIM) to reduce enteric CH4 production in Santa Inês sheep. Twelve male lambs [27. 88 ± 2. 85 kg body weight (BW)] were allocated in individual metabolic cages for 20-day adaptation followed by 6 days for measuring dry matter intake (DMI) and CH4 emission. All lambs received water, mineral supplement, and Cynodon dactylon v. coast-cross hay ad libitum. The treatments consisted of soybean meal (710 g/kg) and ground corn (290 g/kg) [control (CON)]; soybean meal (150 g/kg), ground corn (30 g/kg), and Leucaena hay (820 g/kg) (LEU); soybean meal (160 g/kg), ground corn (150 g/kg), and Mucuna hay (690 g/kg) (STA); and soybean meal (280 g/kg), ground corn (190 g/kg), and Mimosa hay (530 g/kg) (MIM); all calculated to provide 40 g/kg CT (except for CON). DMI (in grams of DMI per kilogram BW per day) was lower for LEU (22. 0) than CON (29. 3), STA (31. 2), and MIM (31. 6). The LEU group showed emission of 7. 8 g CH4/day, significantly lower than CON (10. 5 g CH4/day), STA (10. 4 g CH4/day), and MIM (11. 3 g CH4/day). However, when the CH4 emission per DMI was considered, there were no significant differences among treatments (0. 37, 0. 36, 0. 33, and 0. 35 g CH4/g DMI/kg BW/day, respectively, for CON, LEU, STA, and MIM). The sheep receiving STA had shown a tendency (p = 0. 15) to reduce methane emission when compared to the CON group. Therefore, it is suggested that tropical tanniniferous legumes may have potential to reduce CH4 emission in sheep, but more research is warranted to confirm these results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Conformational transitions of cinnamoyl CoA reductase, a key regulatory enzyme in lignin biosynthesis, from Leucaena leucocephala (Ll-CCRH1) were studied using fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The native protein possesses four trp residues exposed on the surface and 66% of helical structure, undergoes rapid structural transitions at and above 45. °C and starts forming aggregates at 55. °C. Ll-CCRH1 was transformed into acid induced (pH 2.0) molten globule like structure, exhibiting altered secondary structure, diminished tertiary structure and exposed hydrophobic residues. The molten globule like structure was examined for the thermal and chemical stability. The altered secondary structure of L1-CCRH1 at pH 2.0 was stable up to 90. °C. Also, in presence of 0.25. M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), it got transformed into different structure which was stable in the vicinity of 2. M GdnHCl (as compared to drastic loss of native structure in 2. M GdnHCl) as seen in far UV-CD spectra. The structural transition of Ll-CCRH1 at pH 2.0 followed another transition after readjusting the pH to 8.0, forming a structure with hardly any similarity to that of native protein. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Functional relationships of nodulation response and biomass production at nursery stages of two fast-growing, leguminousmultipurpose tree species in Bangladesh: Albizia saman and Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2013

AB  - This study was carried out to assess the relationship of the status of nodulation (i.e., the number of nodules, their shape and size) in root and biomass production of plant growth parameters (i.e., number of leaves, root and shoot lengths, root biomass and shoot biomass) in Albizia saman and Leucaena leucocephala. The assessment started 60 days after seeding. The study revealed that nodulation response and biomass production in both species showed significant differences over time (p < 0.05) in all variables except in the root-shoot ratio (oven-dry) of L. leucocephala. The study also showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in nodule formation and biomass production at the end of the study period between the two species except in the number of nodules and leaves and the green root-shoot ratio. There were strong positive correlations between nodule formation and biomass production, i.e., the number of nodules and the age of plants, the number of nodules and leaves, as well as the number of nodules and biomass (root biomass and shoot biomass) in both species. The results obtained using principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation coefficients of the different characteristics of nodulation and biomass production were similar in both species. The PCA showed that shoot biomass (shoot green weight and shoot oven-dry weight) is positively correlated with PC1 (with an eigenvalue of 7.50) and root length is positively correlated with PC2 (with an eigenvalue of 0.19) in the case of A. saman. In the case of L. leucocephala, the PCA revealed that root biomass (root green weight and root oven-dry weight), shoot biomass and shoot length are also positively correlated with PC1, while nodule formation and the number of leaves are positively correlated with PC2 (with an eigenvalue PC1 of 6.92 and PC2 of 0.49). © 2013 Beijing Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Cost reduction and an increased efficiency in the utilization of nutrients are essential for establishing agricultural systems in the tropics. The combined effects of calcined Al phosphate (ALP) and leucaena prunings (L) on the agronomic efficiency and on the efficiency of physiological use of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in maize were assessed. The treatments consisted of 160 kg ha-1 of P2O5 from ALP and 100 kg ha -1 of N from urea (ALP+U); 160 kg ha-1 of P 2O5 from ALP and 6 Mg ha-1 of L (ALP+L); 160 kg ha-1 of P2O5 from single superphosphate (SSP) and 100 kg ha-1 of N from U (SSP+U); 160 kg ha-1 of P 2O5 from SSP and 6 Mg ha-1of L (SSP+L); and a control without fertilization. The decreasing order of effectiveness among treatments was SSP+L > ALP+L > SSP+U > ALP+U > control. Both leucaena-phosphate combinations had beneficial effects on the growth of the maize, the N and P recovery, and the agronomic efficiencies. Both ear weight and grain weight were higher under the SSP+L treatment than under the SSP+U treatment and higher under the ALP+L treatment than under the ALP+U treatment. The low N and P agronomic efficiency in maize grown under the ALP+U treatment made the combined use of these fertilizers undesirable. The satisfactory efficiency of grain production shown by the maize grown under ALP+L indicated that this treatment could replace processed fertilizers for use in agrosystems management in the tropics. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - By using layering harvest method, a comparative study was conducted on the biomass allocation and its spatial distribution of 20-year-old Eucalyptus camaldulensis plantation, Leucaena leucocephala plantation, and E. camaldulensis-L. leucocephala plantation in Yuanmou dry-hot valley of Yunnan Province, Southwest China. The stand biomass in the mixed E. camaldulensis-L. leucocephala plantation (82.99 t·hm-2) was between that of monoculture E. camaldulensis plantation (60.64 t·hm-2) and L. leucocephala plantation (127.79 t·hm-2). The individual tree biomass of E. camaldulensis in the mixed plantation (44. 32 kg) was 49. 8% higher than that in monoculture plantation (29.58 kg). The branch and leaf biomass of L. leucocephala (25.4%) in monoculture plantation was larger than that of E. camaldulensis (8.9%) in monoculture plantation, and the aboveground biomass distribution ratio (78.0%) of L. leucocephala (25.4%) was also higher than that of E. camaldulensis (73.4%). The roots of L. leucocephala in both monoculture and mixed plantations were mainly distributed in 0-40 cm soil layer, while those of E. camaldulensis in monoculture and mixed plantations were mainly found in 0-80 cm and 0-60 cm, respectively. The proportion of biomass allocated to roots including medium roots, small roots, and fine roots of L. leucocephala in mixed plantation was higher than that in monoculture plantation, but it was contrary for E. camaldulensis. It was suggested that introducing L. leucocephala in E. camaldulensis plantation promoted the growth of E. camaldulensis, especially for its aboveground biomass, and increased the amount of lateral roots in 0-20 cm soil layer, which had significance in soil and water conservation in the study area.

AB  - Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase is a broad substrate specificity enzyme catalyzing the final step in monolignol biosynthesis, leading to lignin formation in plants. Here, we report characterization of a recombinant CAD homologue (LlCAD2) isolated from Leucaena leucocephala. LlCAD2 is 80kDa homo-dimer associated with non-covalent interactions, having substrate preference toward sinapaldehyde with Kcat/Km of 11.6×106 (M-1s-1), and a possible involvement of histidine at the active site. The enzyme remains stable up to 40°C, with the deactivation rate constant (Kd*) and half-life (t1/2) of 0.002 and 5h, respectively. LlCAD2 showed optimal activity at pH 6.5 and 9 for reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively, and was stable between pH 7 and 9, with the deactivation rate constant (Kd*) and half-life (t1/2) of 7.5×10-4 and 15h, respectively. It is a Zn-metalloenzyme with 4 Zn2+ per dimer, however, was inhibited in presence of externally supplemented Zn2+ ions. The enzyme was resistant to osmolytes, reducing agents and non-ionic detergents. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Forage yield and quality of Leucaena leucocephala and Guazuma ulmifolia in mixed and pure fodder banks systems in Yucatan, Mexico

AB  - In tropical areas of Mexico, Leucaena leucocephala is widely used in silvopastoral systems. However, little information exists on other native woody species of high forage potential, such as Guazuma ulmifolia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the components of biomass, forage yield and quality, and availability of N in fodder banks of L. leucocephala, G. ulmifolia, and a mixture of both species during dry and rainy seasons, under sub-humid tropical conditions. The experimental unit was a 5 × 10 m plot, containing three rows with 2 m between rows; each row had 20 plant positions with 0.50 m between plants. Within each plant position there was either a single plant, in the case of pure-crop, or two plants, in the case of mixed of both species. A complete randomized block design with three repetitions was used. In both seasons, there were a significantly greater proportion of leaves in the G. ulmifolia fodder banks (71 %) and in mixed fodder banks (69 %) than in L. leucocephala fodder banks (64 %). Consequently, these systems had leaf-to-stem ratios of 2.4, 2.2 and 1.9, respectively. The forage yield of fodder banks was not influenced by season. The mixed fodder bank had greater forage yield (5.1 t DM ha-1) than the L. leucocephala fodder bank (3.4 t DM ha-1) in each season. Additionally, the mixed fodder bank accumulated more forage yield during the experimental period (10.2 t DM ha-1year-1) than G. ulmifolia (9.0 t DM ha-1 year-1) or L. leucocephala (6.9 t DM ha-1 year-1). The concentrations of CP, C and C:N were not influenced by season. Forage NDF and ADF concentrations were greater in the rainy season (476 g kg-1 DM) compared with the dry season (325 g kg-1 DM). Mixed fodder banks had the greatest N yield (185.9 kg ha-1) and consequently the greatest availability of N (371.8 kg N ha-1year-1). We conclude that mixed fodder banks of L. leucocephala and G. ulmifolia are a better option for improving productivity and forage quality in comparison with pure fodder banks in Yucatan, Mexico. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Superhydrophobic silver nanocoatings with feather-like morphology are fabricated on copper substrates by electroless galvanic deposition. The coating exhibit superhydrophobicity with a contact angle of 156.4° and glide angle of 4° without any further surface modification. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and contact angle measurements are used to investigate the morphology, crystal structure and superhydrophobicity, respectively, of the coatings. The coatings exhibit high thermal stability; their water contact angle did not change when the coatings were heated to 200°C for 2 h. The mechanism of superhydrophobicity of the silver coating is discussed based on the work of Amirfazli, Wenzel and Cassie. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), a leguminous shrub promising to cope with feed scarcity in the tropics, may help in mitigating ruminal methane (CH4) emission in the tropics as well. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of Leucaena and major secondary compounds of this plant in ruminants. At first, effects of Leucaena tannins and mimosine on ruminal CH4 and nutrient degradability were tested in vitro. Incubations were made with Leucaena without or with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to exclude the tannins effects, as well as with Bermuda grass (Tifton) and lucerne hays, both either untreated or supplemented with mimosine at the same concentration that has been provided by the tested Leucaena (6.52 mg/g DM). Furthermore, in an in vivo experiment a control diet (per kg DM 700 g Tifton hay) and Leucaena diets (per kg DM 350 g Tifton hay and 350 g Leucaena), either with or without 20 g PEG/d per head, were evaluated in six Santa Inês sheep following a double Latin square design. In vitro, Leucaena resulted in the lowest (p < 0.05) gas and CH4 production and the highest (p < 0.05) partitioning factor, a measure for microbial efficiency, whereas the amount of truly degraded organic matter (TDOM) was lowest (p < 0.05) with Tifton among the experimental forage plants. Mimosine addition to lucerne and Tifton as well as PEG addition to Leucaena had no effect on ruminal CH4 and TDOM. In vivo Leucaena, compared to the Tifton diet, enhanced (p < 0.05) intake, faecal nitrogen excretion, body nitrogen retention and the excretion of urinary purine derivatives as an indicator for microbial protein synthesis and availability. This was independent of PEG addition. Leucaena also decreased (p < 0.001) CH4 emission per unit of digested organic matter by 14.1% and 10.8%, without and with PEG, respectively. No significant diet differences were observed in total-tract nutrient digestibility. The study demonstrated efficiency of Leucaena to mitigate in vivo methane emission of sheep, but did not reveal which constituent of Leucaena was primarily responsible for that since no clear efficiency of either tannins or mimosine could be demonstrated. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Accelerated nutrient cycling via leaf litter, and not root interaction, increases growth of Eucalyptus in mixed-species plantations with Leucaena
PY  - 2013
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883676222&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2013.08.021&partnerID=40&md5=d0e7437bd1aa93cc142db1a6d5fa0393
AB  - In the farmland/forest ecotone of southwest China, many areas are experiencing afforestation or reforestation by Eucalyptus in pure or mixed-species plantations for economic and ecological objectives. Compared with Eucalyptus monocultures, introducing nitrogen-fixing trees to Eucalyptus plantations with appropriate mixture proportions have the potential to increase productivity while maintaining soil fertility. Two mechanisms account for the improved nutrient availability: litter decomposition and root interaction. We hypothesise that the former mechanism may primarily contribute to the improvements in some arid regions where the soil is highly rocky. To test our hypothesis, the effects of admixed litter decomposition and root interaction on Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Leucaena leucocephala growth were investigated in a valley-type savanna.After 10. years, E. camaldulensis growth in the mixed-species plantations was unaffected by root overlapping with L. leucocephala. E. camaldulensis grew significantly faster in the plots with admixture of litters in the mixed-species plantations than those without admixture.The admixed litter decomposition, rather than root interaction, is a primary contributor to E. camaldulensis growth in plantations with L. leucocephala in the valley-type savanna. The rocky soils in the savanna may block root overlapping by greatly inhibiting root extension of both tree species. The admixture of litters produces an increase in the supply and availability of soil nutrients that are returned to the E. camaldulensis rows via the admixed litters, due to the enhancement of the quantity, quality and decomposition rates of the leaf mixtures. These factors promote the growth of E. camaldulensis, and this effect may have implications for the necessity of litter management for Eucalyptus plantations in certain regions with arid climate and rocky soil. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sixteen growing Katahdin×Pelibuey lambs (24±0.3kg body weight) were used to study the effects of oral administration of extracts of Salix babylonica (SB) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL) leaves on ruminal pH, total and individual volatile fatty acids (VFA) and NH3-N concentrations, as well as ruminal protozoal counts, urinary purine derivatives (PD) excretion and estimated microbial protein synthesis. Lambs were fed a total mixed ration (TMR) containing 219 and 141gkg-1 of CP and NDF, respectively. Four treatments (4lambs/treatment) were Control (no extract added), SB (SB extract at 30mld-1), LL (LL extract at 30mld-1) and SBLL (mixture of SB at 15mld-1+LL at 15mld-1). Extracts were administered orally to each lamb before the morning meal daily. Measurements were on days 22 (P1), 43 (P2) and 63 (P3) of the experiment. Ruminal pH increased (P=0.014) with SBLL extract and decreased with SB. The ratio of acetate to propionate was higher (P=0.042) with SBLL compared to the control. Ruminal NH3-N concentration was not affected by extract administration (P=0.309) or experimental period (P=0.087). Protozoal counts were not affected (P=0.489) by extract addition but decreased (P<0.001) in P3 compared with P1 and P2. Uric acid concentration increased (P<0.001) with individual extracts of SB and LL compared with the control or SBLL. Excretion of other purine derivatives (allantoin, xanthine, and hypoxanthine), creatinine and microbial protein synthesis were not changed (P>0.05) by extracts administration. Overall, oral administration of S. babylonica and L. leucocephala extracts, or their 1:1 mixture, to lambs for 63d had only minor effects on ruminal fermentation, urinary purine derivative excretion and microbial protein synthesis. © 2014 .

AB  - Drop behaviour during impact affects retention. Increasing adhesion is usually seen as an objective when applying crop protection products, while bouncing and shattering are seen as detrimental to spray retention. However, observation of drop impacts on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) using high speed shadowgraphy shows that bouncing and fragmentation can occur in Cassie-Baxter as well as in Wenzel wetting regimes. In this last regime, a part of the drop may remain stuck on the surface, contributing to retention. Using simultaneous measurements of drop impacts with high speed imaging and of retention with fluorophotometry for spray mixtures on excised barley leaves using a Teejet 11003 nozzle at 0.2MPa, it was observed that about 50% of the drops that fragmented in the Wenzel state remain on the horizontal leaf. Depending on the spray mixture, these impact outcomes accounted for 28-46% of retention, the higher contribution being correlated with bigger VMD (Volume Median Diameter). This contribution is not negligible and should be considered when modelling spray retention processes.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The experiment was conducted to determine the effect of dried Leucaena leaf supplementation on rumen ecology, nutrient digestibility and urinary excretion of 2,3-dihydroxy pyridone (2,3-DHP) and 3,4-dihydroxy pyridone (3,4-DHP) in swamp buffaloes. Four rumen fistulated swamp buffaloes were assigned according to a cross-over design to receive 3.0 kg/hd/d dried Leucaena leaf supplementation. Swamp buffaloes were fed with rice straw ad libitum and dried Leucaena leaf was supplemented at 3.0 kg/hd/d. Apparent digestibility of CP were increased (P< 0.05) in buffaloes supplemented with Leucaena leaf. The average values of BUN were 1.26, 13.08 mg/dl and NH3 were 8.9, 16.1 mg/dl in control and in the supplemented group, respectively. Moreover, there were differences in total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) in Leucaena leaf supplemented than in the control group. The efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (EMPS) were increased by Leucaena leaf supplemented group. Population sizes of the target total bacteria, predominant cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen were influenced by dietary treatments (P<0.05), as enumerated by real-time PCR assays. The strain of Synnergistes jonesii was pesented in swamp buffaloes fed supplemented with Leucaena leaf. Moreover, total DHP concentration was related to Leucaena and mimosine intake. Based on this study, it could be concluded that supplementation of dried Leucaena leaf at 3 kg/hd/d could be a good protein source for swamp buffaloes to improve nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation and microbial protein synthesis.

AB  - Leucaenaleucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. is native to Central America and Mexico, but now grows naturally in most tropical areas globally. It is a neglected and underutilized; medium to small sized tree of multiple values. It is commonly known as wild tamarind in English and subabul in Hindi. In recent years, Leucaena has gained a great attention for its utilization as raw material on large scale for pulp and paper industries and manufacturing of packaging material. Present paper deals with distribution, morphological description, current utilization, future prospective and propagation of this species. During the present study we have standardized macro-propagation technique for L. leucocephala. We used fly ash amended sand to develop rooting media for vegetative propagation of L. leucocephala and assess its potential as a rooting media. Root formation was significantly high (p < 0. 05) in 10 % FA amended sand in comparison to other used media. Rooted plants showed nutrient deficiency symptoms after 40-50 days in sand while in 10 % FA amended sand they were healthy, greener and do not showed nutrient deficiency symptoms. On the basis of present study, it is concluded that 10 % fly ash amended sand is a suitable rooting media for vegetative propagation of L. leucocephala. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Berenty Reserve is a privately owned reserve established in 1936. At 200 ha, it holds the largest remaining gallery forest on the Mandrare River. Scientists of many nationalities have studied there: research follows their diverse interests rather than being coordinated overall. One finding which emerged from long-term monitoring concerns the importance of both within- and between-troop competition for female Lemur catta and their inheritance of territory in the female line, at least in this islanded population. This may play a role in the maintenance of female dominance over males. Another aspect of long-term study is the changes brought by introduced species, including Leucaena leucocephala, a favored, but toxic, forage tree. The growth of leucaena stands paralleled population growth of the L. catta troops with access to these stands, although highly affected females lost fur and had low infant survival; eradication produced a local population crash. Introduced Eulemur rufus x collaris have grown from about 16 individuals in 1975-1980 to almost 600 in 2009. They are taking over the central gallery forest. L. catta troops maintain their original sleeping areas in the gallery forest but increasingly forage on the periphery, recreating the niche separation described for Lemur and Eulemur in natural sympatry. Overall, Berenty Reserve is drying out, with closed-canopy gallery forest giving way to more open scrub. Research on Berenty's lemurs is thus the study of evolved adaptations confronted with a changing environment. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012. All rights are reserved.

TI  - Chemical composition and ruminal degradation kinetics of crude protein and amino acids, and intestinal digestibility of amino acids from tropical forages

AB  - The objective of this research was to determine the chemical composition and ruminal degradation of the crude protein (CP), total and individual amino acids of leaves from tropical forages: perennial soybean (Neonotonia wightii), cassava (Manihot esculenta), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and ramie (Boehmeria nivea), and to estimate the intestinal digestibility of the rumen undegradable protein (RUDP) and individual amino acids of leaves from the tropical forages above cited, but including pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan). Three nonlactating Holstein cows were used to determine the in situ ruminal degradability of protein and amino acids from leaves (6, 18 and 48 hours of ruminal incubation). For determination of the intestinal digestibility of RUDP, the residue from ruminal incubation of the materials was used for 18 hours. A larger concentration of total amino acids for ramie and smaller for perennial soybean were observed; however, they were very similar in leucaena and cassava. Leucine was the essential amino acid of greater concentration, with the exception of cassava, which exhibited a leucine concentration 40.45% smaller. Ramie showed 14.35 and 22.31% more lysine and methionine, respectively. The intestinal digestibility of RUDP varied from 23.56; 47.87; 23.48; 25.69 and 10.86% for leucaena, perennial soybean, cassava, ramie and pigeon pea, respectively. The individual amino acids of tropical forage disappeared in different extensions in the rumen. For the correct evaluation of those forages, one should consider their composition of amino acids, degradations and intestinal digestibility, once the amino acid composition of the forage does not reflect the amino acid profiles that arrived in the small intestine. Differences between the degradation curves of CP and amino acids indicate that degradation of amino acids cannot be estimated through the degradation curve of CP, and that amino acids are not degraded in a similar degradation profile. © 2012 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia.

AB  - Residues of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (L), Senna siamea (S) and maize stover (M) were tested to evaluate their effect on soil organic matter accumulation and composition under sub-humid tropical conditions. On an Imperata cylindrica (I) dominated grass fallow, a total amount of 30 Mg ha -1 DM were applied within 18 months. Two months after the last application, changes in the light and heavy soil organic carbon fraction (LF and HF) and in the total soil organic carbon content (LF + HF) in the topsoil were observed. All organic materials increased the proportion of the LF fraction in the soil significantly. The increase in HF was 39 to 51% of the increase in total organic carbon, depending on the source of the organic material. The potential of the tested organic materials to increase total soil organic carbon content (including all soil organic carbon fractions) was in the order L > S > M > I, whereas the order of increase of the HF fraction was L = S > I > M. Cation exchange capacity of the newly formed heavy soil organic carbon was highest with L and lowest with M. Ranking of the transformation efficiency of applied plant residues into the heavy soil organic carbon fraction was I > L = S > M. Transformation efficiency of the residues could neither be explained by lignin nor lignin/N ratio, but rather by extractable polyphenols (Folin-Denis extraction). The results show that accumulation of the HF fraction in tropical soils is feasible through the application of large quantities of plant residues, but depends strongly on the composition of the applied materials. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Nature offers exciting examples for functional wetting properties based on superhydrophobicity, such as the self-cleaning surfaces on plant leaves and trapped air on immersed insect surfaces allowing underwater breathing. They inspire biomimetic approaches in science and technology. Superhydrophobicity relies on the Cassie wetting state where air is trapped within the surface topography. Pressure can trigger an irreversible transition from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state with no trapped air - this transition is usually detrimental for nonwetting functionality and is to be avoided. Here we present a new type of reversible, localized and instantaneous transition between two Cassie wetting states, enabled by two-level (dual-scale) topography of a superhydrophobic surface, that allows writing, erasing, rewriting and storing of optically displayed information in plastrons related to different length scales.

TI  - Immunostimulatory effect of artificial feed supplemented with indigenous plants on Clarias gariepinus against Aeromonas hydrophila
PY  - 2013

AB  - The antibacterial activity of methanol extracts of Ficus benghalensis (prop-root) and Leucaena leucocephala (pod seed) was evaluated by measurement of zone of inhibition against pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila. Control artificial feed and artificial feed supplemented with 5% powder of F.benghalensis and L.leucocephala were prepared. Juvenile Clarias gariepinus were divided into four groups, acclimatized to laboratory conditions and fed with respective feeds for 20 days prior to the experiment. Immunomodulatory response of supplementary feed was studied by challenging the fish intraperitoneally at weekly intervals, with A.hydrophila. One set of fish, not challenged with A.hydrophila was used as a negative control, to analyze any detrimental effect of supplementary feed, while positive control, comprised of challenged fish fed with non-supplemented feed. Other two groups of fish were challenged with A.hydrophila and fed with respective supplementary feeds.Blood was collected on weekly intervals for four weeks and serum samples were analyzed to evaluate the damage of fish by A.hydrophila through liver function tests. The increase in the levels of Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) in positive control group indicated the damage of liver & kidney. However the levels did not change significantly in fish fed with supplementary feeds when compared to negative control group. Nitric oxide, SOD, ALP and lipid peroxidase indicated lower stress levels in these fish compared to positive control. Fish fed with supplementary feed showed increased lysozyme activity and phagocytic index indicating an increase in non-specific immune response. The immunoglobulin levels of in serum were analyzed by homologous sandwich ELISA, which showed higher antibody production in fish fed with supplementary feed.The current study suggests conclusively, immunostimulatory role of F.benghalensis (prop-roots) and L.leucocephala (pod seed) in C. gariepinus when supplemented in artificial feed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - How the change of contact angle occurs for an evaporating droplet: Effect of impurity and attached water films
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872744213&doi=10.1039%2fc2sm26559a&partnerID=40&md5=cd61aae49ce6eccb5c910ca5b57553f9
AB  - On a hydrophobic surface, the contact angle of an evaporating droplet decreases with time and becomes much smaller than its receding contact angle; the rate of decrease is accelerated with time. When we use impurity-concentrated water produced by partial distillation, the decrease in contact angle is remarkably accelerated with time. In contrast, for purified water, the decrease in contact angle is significantly reduced and the start of stage 3 is delayed. These results indicate that the submicron-sized impurities cause the decrease in contact angle. Also, we found that a number of attached thin films of water are generated around the periphery of impure droplets. We derived the contact angle equation under the Cassie-Baxter model by regarding the water film as a heterogeneous layer. We compared the theoretical model to the experimental data, and these results suggest that the attached film should be considered as one of the direct causes for the large deviation from the Young's angle of evaporating droplets. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Maize (Zea mays) intercropping in a silvopastoral system with Brachiaria hybrid cv. Mulato and Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru
PY  - 2012

AB  - The effect of maize (Zea mays) intercropping on the establishment of a simultaneous silvopastoril grass-leucaena sowing was studied. A completely randomized design with two treatments was used: A) Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru and Brachiaria hybrid cv. Mulato plus maize and B) leucaena plus mulato grass. Sowings were made at the beginning of June, 2007 in the rainy season, on a carbonated brown soil. Indicators studied were: number of plants, number of stalks plant-1, height and yield in leucaena and height, number of plants and yield in mulato grass. Botanical composition, availability and bromatological composition of the grassland were determined. SAS 9.1 software was used for the statistical analysis of the evaluated indicators. In treatment A, leucaena showed higher height values (P < 0.01) (108.67 cm vs. 93.73 cm), yield (P < 0.01) (90.20 vs. 75.10 g DM plants-1), number of stalks plant-1 (P < 0.001) (12.91 vs. 10.61) and number of plants (P < 0.001) (4.96 vs. 3.83). In this treatment, mulato grass showed higher number of plants (P < 0.01) (8.50 vs. 6.10) and yield (P < 0.001) (300.15 vs. 250.02 g DM plants.1). Percentage of mulato grass was also higher (66% vs. 50%) with this treatment. The remaining grasses did not differ. There was a higher availability (P < 0.05) in the treatment with maize (7.8 vs. 5.8 t DM ha-1). It is concluded that maize intercropping in a simultaneous sowing of leucaena and mulato grass favors leucaena establishment and does not affect the grass. Results indicate the possibility of establishing silvopatoral systems with leucaena and mulato grass of recent introduction in our country through maize intercropping in the sowings, with the advantage of grain harvesting and possible sale to cover the establishment expenses.

AB  - Molecular diversity of protists from bovine rumen fluid incubated with condensed tannins of Leucaena leucocephala hybrid-Rendang at 20 mg/500 mg dry matter (treatment) or without condensed tannins (control) was investigated using 18S rRNA gene library. Clones from the control library were distributed within nine genera, but clones from the condensed tannin treatment clone library were related to only six genera. Diversity estimators such as abundance-based coverage estimation and Chao1 showed significant differences between the two libraries, although no differences were found based on Shannon-Weaver index and Libshuff. © 2012 International Society of Protistologists.

TI  - Infestation of heteropsylla cubana (hemiptera: Psylloidea) on leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae) in Cameroon
PY  - 2012

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae), originating from Central America, was introduced into Cameroon in the 1960s as a shade tree and for soil improvement. The tree is strongly infested by Heteropsylla cubana (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), also native to Central America. The purpose of this study is to record the presence of the psyllid in Cameroon, and assess its infestation pattern in order to provide the necessary data for an integrated pest management strategy. Data were collected at two sites, Koutaba (Western Highlands) and Yaounde (Southern Plateau), respectively, with three plots (K1, K2, K3) at the former site and one (Y) at the latter. The relative abundance of psyllids varied significantly between the four plots (K = 97.6, d.f. = 3, P < 0.0001). The Yaounde plot with a mean of 4013.71 individuals/100 leaves was more infested than any of those in Koutaba (with 1888.10, 314.60 and 2546.92 individuals/100 leaves, respectively). At both sites, the spatial distribution of psyllid populations globally followed an aggregated pattern with the dispersion index k ranging from 0.082 to 5.32. The infestation rate observed was influenced by plot age rather than climatic factors. In fact, the Yaounde plot was younger than those in Koutaba.

TI  - Over-expression of a subgroup 4 R2R3 type MYB transcription factor gene from Leucaena leucocephala reduces lignin content in transgenic tobacco

AB  - Key message: LlMYB1, a subgroup 4 R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene fromLeucaena leucocephalaappears to be a repressor of lignin biosynthesis pathway by regulating the transcription of general phenylpropanoid pathway genes. R2R3MYB transcription factors are known to play a wide role in regulating the phenylpropanoid pathway in plants. In this study, we report isolation, cloning and characterization of an R2R3MYB transcription factor gene (LlMYB1) from an economically important tree species, Leucaena leucocephala. LlMYB1 consists of 705 bp coding sequence corresponding to 235 amino acids. Sequence alignment revealed that the N-terminal (MYB) domain of the gene shares up to 95 % similarity with subgroup 4 (Sg4) members of R2R3Myb gene family functionally known to be lignin repressors. Highly divergent C-terminal region of the gene carried an ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, another characteristic of the Sg4. The gene was phylogenetically grouped closest with AmMYB308, a known repressor of monolignol biosynthetic pathway genes. Spatio-temporal expression studies at different ages of seedlings using quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) showed highest transcript level of the gene in 10 day old stem tissues. Over-expression of the gene in transgenic tobacco showed statistically significant decline in the transcript levels of the general phenylpropanoid pathway genes and reduction in lignin content. Our study suggests that LlMYB1 might be playing the role of a repressor of lignin biosynthesis in L. leucocephala. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation, performed by diazotrophic bacteria, plays an important role in the maintenance of agricultural systems, as it contributes with significant amounts of the nitrogen (N) needed for plant growth, totally or partially exempting the use of industrial N fertilisers. Twenty-five bacterial strains isolated from nodules of Leucaena leucocephala and Phaseolus vulgaris trap plants were studied. These nodules were formed after inoculation with suspensions of soil samples collected close to the root system of Sesbania virgata. In previous studies, these bacteria were identified as Cupriavidus necator. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of these strains to fix N 2 in the free-living state and to use carbon (C) sources; their resistance to antibiotics; growth in media with different pH values and salt concentrations and symbiotic efficiency with L. leucocephala and P. vulgaris. In each test, these strains were compared to C. taiwanensis LMG 19424T. Although a high variability regarding antibiotic resistance, salt tolerance and use of C sources were observed among the 25 C. necator strains, a large group behaved similar regarding salt tolerance (20 strains) and antibiotic resistance (22 strains). C. necator strains behaved in a different way of LMG 19424T. Only one of the 25 strains studied, UFLA02-69, was not able to establish symbiosis with its trap species, P. vulgaris. Only the strains LMG19424T and UFLA01-672 were efficient in symbiosis with L. leucocephala. The ability to use C sources, grow in different pHs and salt concentrations and resistance to several antibiotics, may grant high saprophytic competence and greater competitivity to these strains in relation to the native Leguminosae-nodulating bacterial β-populations, suggesting potential use in inoculant strain selec- selection studies for legumes cultivated in soils with a wide range of pH and salt concentrations.Keywords: symbiosis, β-proteobacteria, antibiotic resistance.

AB  - The direct seeding is presented as an economically viable technique for easy deployment and recovery of degraded areas, however problems in the emergence and early seedling growth are limiting factors for their application. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using physical protector in the emergence and early growth of three tree species, Anadenanthera colubrine, Leucaena leucocephala e Sena pendula. For the protection of the species used were 400 mL plastic cups with the bottom removed, and, within 45 days were examined emergence, survival and seedling height. It was observed that the use of physical protector was not significant for the survival and emergence of the species, but the initial growth of plant height showed the best results with floating seeds when compared to no protection for the species L. leucocephala and A. colubrina. It can be concluded that dismissal is the use of protective emergency and to increase the survival of the species studied, but this is indicated when it is desired to obtain a greater increase in height.

AB  - Cogongrass (Imperata cylindria) is an invasive weed and harmful to ecological systems and agricultural production in many countries. It was found that plant extracts and root exudates of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) exhibit allelopathic potential and inhibit the growth of cogongrass to a greater extent than either barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli), Indian goose-grass (Eleushine indica), or lettuce (Lactuca sativa) in bioassays. Greenhouse trials indicated that sweet potato soil reduced the emergence of the noxious weed by 50 %, yet exhibited either weaker inhibition or the promotion of barnyardgrass, Bidens (Bidens pilosa), and Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), while the desired growth of upland rice (Oryza sativa) was not affected. In cogongrass fields, the incorporation of 1-2 tons aboveground parts and cultivation of sweet potato provided 80-85 % weed control. On the other hand, the reduction of congograss in fields may be offset by the alternate invasion of B. pilosa which multiplied its biomass by 2-6 times with sweet potato amended soils. The findings of this study indicate that sweet potato is an effective crop in the biologic management of the invasive cogongrass in agricultural fields, thus the interactive mechanism between sweet potato and the invasive weed demands further investigation. Ecologically, this study highlights the specificity of allelopathic interactions between cogongrass and sweet potato that is helpful to minimize the disturbance from infestation of this invasive weed against native species and crops. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro development of Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, the symbiotic fungus of Atta sexdens rubropilosa in culture medium added with extracts of 24 plant species. The fungus was inoculated in PDA added with vegetables extracts and four controls, in Petri dishes. The dishes were maintained in climate chambers at temperature of 25±1°C in the dark, to period of 42 days. The fungal growth was evaluated weekly by diameter of the colony. The results showed that the symbiotic fungus of these ants has differentiated growth when compared to the extracts provided in the dishes, and the medium supplemented with extracts of aricá (Physocalymma scaberrimum), cerejeira (Amburana acreana), cedro (Cedrela fissilis), timbó (Magonia pubescens), leucena (Leucaena leucocephala) e mogno (Swietenia macrophylla) hampered the development, however the extracts of genipapo (Genipa americana), seringueira (Hevea brasiliensis), ingá (Inga edulis) e cambará (Vochysia divergens) had better conditions for the development of the symbiotic fungus.

AB  - The Leucaena leucocephala has been amply affected and has demonstrated your high potential for the feeding of the ruminants in the tropic. With the objective to determine the nutritive value, with emphasis on the content of secondary metabolites at different sprout ages during the two seasons of the year, a 0.5-ha plot was used, and a 1- meter- high uniformity cut was applied at the beginning of each season. The evaluated ages were 60, 120 and 180 days. Furthermore, the PB, fibrous fractioning, glucose, fructose, sucrose, tannin, oligosaccharides, flavonoids, alkaloids, and saponins were evaluated. A a random- brick design with three treatments and four repetitions was utilized, by means of a double classification analysis, and the average were compared through a Duncan parametric multiple range test. The statistic program utilized was the statistical package "STATISTICA" for Windows, version 6.0. The resulting data show that the FND, FAD, LAD, Hemicellulose, FT, Flv, Alc and Sap increased their content (61,66 %; 31,48 %; 20,73 %; 30,18 %; 43,54; 77,5; 3,05 and 10,7 g/kg respectively) at the age of 180 days, whereas the raw protein and the cellulose decreased with their highest value (31,74 and 13,91 %) at the age of 60 days, and at 120 they showed their highest values with (29,03; 3,02 and 32,85 μg/g). Concluding that age had a remarkable effect on the evaluated indicators behavior, this effect highlighted during the rainy season.

TI  - Productive performance and urinary excretion of mimosine metabolites by hair sheep grazing in a silvopastoral system with high densities of Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2012

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate daily weight gain (DWG), total dry matter (DM) intake, rumen degradability of forage, and urinary excretion of mimosine metabolites by hair sheep in a silvopastoral system with high densities of Leucaena leucocephala. A completely randomized design was carried out with two treatments: treatment 1 (T1) silvopastoral system with leucaena at a density of 35,000 plants/ha and treatment 2 (T2), leucaena at a density of 55,000 plants/ha. Leucaena was associated with tropical grasses Panicum maximum and Cynodon nlemfluensis. Twenty-four male Pelibuey lambs of 23.2 ± 3.4 kg live weight (LW) were used (12 lambs per treatment). Results showed differences (P < 0.05) in DWG of T1 (106.41 ± 11.66 g-1 sheep-1) with respect to that of T2 (81.33 ± 11.81 g-1 sheep). Voluntary intake was higher in lambs from T1 (83.81 ± 04.07 g DM/kg LW0.75) with respect to that from T2 (71.67 ± 8.12 g DM/kg LW0.75). There was a difference in color of urine between sheep of T1 and T2, the latter giving positive results for the presence of metabolites derived from mimosine (3-4 dihydroxypyridine and 2-3 dihydroxy pyridone). Rumen degradability of DM of L. leucocephala was higher (P < 0.05) compared to that of P. maximum and C. nlemfluensis (72.94 ± 0.40 vs. 67.06 ± 1.50 and 63.25 ± 1.51 %, respectively). It is concluded that grazing at high densities of L. leucocephala affects daily weight gain of hair sheep, possibly due to ingestion of high amounts of mimosine which may exert an adverse effect on voluntary intake. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Focusing on drug discovery non-proteinogenic amino acids have often been used as important building blocks for construction of compound libraries in the filed of combinatorial chemistry and chemical biology. Highly homogeneous l-mimosine, α-amino-β-(3-hydoxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridin-1-yl)- propanoic acid, a non-proteinogenic amino acid, has been successfully isolated and purified on an industrial scale from wild leaves of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala de Wit) which is a widely distributed legume in Okinawa, a sub-tropical island in Japan. Optical purity determinations used for quality control have been established through diastereomer formation. Physico-chemical properties and biological properties of purified mimosine have been clarified. Mimosine is sparingly soluble in water and organic solvents but can be dissolved in aqueous alkaline solution. The tyrosinase pathway is of particular interest in the cosmetic field, since mimosine is an analog of tyrosine. Thus the present purified mimosine have been tested in tyrosinase inhibitory assays. The IC 50 for tyrosinase inhibitory activity of purified Mim was compared with kojic acid. Mimosine shows significant inhibition of melanin production in murine melanoma cells. The derivatization of mimosine has been investigated with a focus on its use in conventional peptide syntheses to generate mimosyl peptides. N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy)-mimosine and resin-bound mimosine for solid-phase syntheses have also been performed. Highly homogeneous Mim is a useful material for the development of functional cosmetics or active pharmaceutical ingredients. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the replacement of alfalfa clover by blue panic grass (Panicum antidotale) as a sub-tropical browse in Saudi Arabia on rumen fermentation characteristics, methane emission and productivity of dairy cows in late lactation. Two experiments were conducted, the first experiment was in vitro assay using semi-automatic system of gas production to compare the ruminal fermentation pattern and methane emission of alfalfa clover and blue panic grass, while the second experiment was tested the complete replacement of alfalfa clover by blue panic grass on dry matter intake, milk yield and composition in dairy cows. The results of the first experiment revealed that there are wide variations in crude protein (CP) content of alfalfa clover (20.3%) and blue panic grass (8.4%). The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was higher in blue panic grass (62.3%) than in alfalfa clover (51.0%). The secondary compound analysis showed higher contents of blue panic grass than alfalfa clover of total phenol (TP; 27 vs. 11 eq-g tannic acid/kg DM), total tannins (TT, 17 vs. 3.6 eq-g tannic acid/kg DM) and condensed tannins (CT, 2.6 vs. 0.5 eq-g leucocyanidin/kg DM). The cumulative gas production at 24 h was higher (P<0.05) for alfalfa clover than blue panic grass. The results of methane emission showed a decline (P<0.05) in methane emission in blue panic grass compared with alfalfa clover. There were no significant differences between alfalfa clover and blue panic grass in rumen pH, NH3-N concentration and protozoa number. The true degradation of organic matter (TDOM), short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and partitioning factor (PF) were lower in blue panic grass than in alfalfa clover. The results of the second experiment revealed that the group of lactating dairy cows fed blue panic grass produced less (P<0.05) milk yield (6.74 vs. 5.44 kg/d) and fat corrected milk (5.58 vs. 4.62 kg/d) than alfalfa clover group. Blue panic grass group revealed that milk fat was higher than in alfalfa group, while milk protein, lactose, non-fat solid (SNF) and ash percentages had no differences between two groups. Blood metabolite measurements showed that dairy cows fed blue panic grass had lower (P>0.05) total protein, globulin, glucose, urea and cholesterol compared to alfalfa group except creatinine, which was higher (P>0.05) in blue panic grass group. It can be concluded that although blue panic grass reduced methane emission in vitro, complete replacement of blue panic grass instead of alfalfa clover affects negatively on the productivity of lactating dairy cows in semi-arid regions.

AB  - Current understanding of non-wettability of surfaces is presented and discussed. Three types of non-wettability are analysed: superhydrophobicity (drops on rough, hydrophobic surfaces), superhygrophobicity (drops on rough, hygrophilic surfaces), and under-water superhydrophobicity (rough, hydrophobic surfaces submerged in water). It is shown, based on quantitative work, that non-wettability must indeed be associated with the Cassie-Baxter state, and may be qualitatively defined by requiring the wetted area to be minimal. A quantitative definition is yet to be developed. The analysis is presented in terms of thermodynamic equilibrium and stability. To gain thermodynamic stability, the roughness geometry has to conform to a certain mathematical condition (for example, convex protrusions enable it while concave dents do not). The problem of optimal roughness geometry, including the issue of multi-scale roughness, is also discussed, concluding that the detailed optimal topography of non-wettable surfaces is yet to be elucidated. Finally, the fundamental principles underlying non-wettability are shown to be useful as design-guiding principles. ©  The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - It is a great challenge for researchers to select plant species in terms of their physiological and root properties for vegetation on slope. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the physiology and root profile of four selected tropical plants namely Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Adenanthera pavonina (AP), Peltophorum pterocarpum (PP) and Pterocarpus indicus (PI). The species studied were grown in three different types of soil; slope, clay and sandy, under greenhouse conditions. Outstanding physiological performance, as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence, the photosynthetic rate, the biomass production and growth rate were observed to be the highest in LL, followed by PP, AP and PI. In terms of the root profiles, LL exhibited a higher root length (450%), volume (500%), and root biomass (600%) than PI. The root biomass values of the species studied was highly correlated with the soil moisture content (R2=0.83). Overall results suggested that L. leucocephala exhibited outstanding physiological performance and root profiles and can be a potential plant for soil reinforcement.

AB  - A water soluble galactomannan isolated from Leucaena leucocephala seeds gave an intrinsic viscosity of 3.5 dl/g and viscosity average molecular mass, Mv, of 6.98 × 105 g/mol. This was in reasonably good agreement with the value of the weight average molecular mass, Mw, of 5.44 ± 0.20 × 105 g/mol determined by GPC-MALLS coupled to RI. The onset of polymer coil overlap occurred at c*[η] of 2.1, with slope of 3.0 above and 1.3 below the point of polymer coil overlap. The shear viscosity of the polysaccharide was temperature dependent and decreased with increasing temperature. The activation energy for viscous flow of 3.0% polysaccharide concentration obtained by Arrhenius plot of zero shear viscosity as a function of temperature was 26.4 kJ/mol. Both the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) showed strong dependence on frequency indicating the presence of entangled coils. The Cox-Merz plot gave close superimposition of the complex and shear viscosities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Invasive species such as Leucaena leucocephala have disturbed the forest ecosystem in Hengchun Peninsula, Taiwan. This study applies remote sensing and GIS to analyze the landscape pattern of Leucaena leucocephala dispersal in Hengchun Peninsula. The research processes include (1) applying remote sensing and GIS to generate the land use map of Hengchun Peninsula and the distribution map of Leucaena Leucocephala in 1994 and 2006; (2) analyzing the landscape pattern of Leucaena Leucocephala based on landscape structure indices; (3) monitoring the effect of Leucaena Leucocephala dispersal on Hengchun Peninsula landscape from 1994 to 2006 using Shannon diversity t-test. The result is as follows. The land use map and the distribution map of Leucaena Leucocephalag in 1994 and 2006, generated by remote sensing and GIS techniques, are acceptable after accuracy assessment. From the generated distribution map of Leucaena Leucocephala and the calculated landscape indices, obviously the dispersal of Leucaena leucocephala continues to expand from 1994 to 2006. However, the dispersal effect of Leucaena leucocephala on the landscape of Hengchun Peninsula is not significant according to the result of Shannon diversity t-test. The above result is concluded that the integration of remote sensing and GIS is a timely and useful technique to study the pattern analysis of Leucaena leucocephala dispersal. Meanwhile, the result obtained from this study can be a reference for Forest Unit or National Park to monitor and control the dispersal of Leucaena Leucocephala in Hengchun Peninsula, Taiwan.

AB  - Lectins are plant secondary metabolites (PSM) found in many forages and which may confer anthelmintic properties to gastrointestinal parasites through disrupting the development of parasitic larvae throughout its life cycle. In experiment 1, the ability of the plant lectins jacalin (JAC), concanavalin A (Con A), phytohemagglutinin E2L2 (PHA-E2L2), phytohemagglutinin L4 (PHA-L4), phytohemagglutinin E3L (PHA-E3L), kidney bean albumin (KBA), Robinia pseudoacacia agglutinin (RPA), Maackia amurensis lectin (MAA), Maclura pomifera agglutinin (MAA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) to disrupt the feeding of the first stage larvae (L 1) of the sheep gastro-intestinal nematodes (GIN) Teladorsagia circumcincta, Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis was investigated using a larval feeding inhibition test (LFIT). Only PHA-E3L, WGA and Con A had a potent effect on disrupting larval feeding of all of the three species of GIN investigated. The lectin concentration required to inhibit feeding in 50% of L 1 (IC50) was 7.3±1.2, 8.3±1.4 and 4.3±1.7μg/ml for PHA-E3L; 59.1±32.4, 58.7±11.9 and 8.1±7.0μg/ml for Con A and 78.9±11.2, 69.4±8.1 and 28.0±14.1μg/ml for WGA for T. circumcincta, H. contortus and T. colubriformis larvae, respectively (P=0.006). The addition of the lectin inhibitors fetuin, glucose/mannose or N-acetylglucosamine for PHA-E3L, Con A and WGA, respectively, caused an increase in the proportion of larvae that had fed at all concentrations for PHA-E3L only. In experiment 2, the effect of extracts from the tropical plants Azadiractha indica, Trichanthera gigantea, Morus alba, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala on the feeding behaviour of H. contortus L 1, was examined. A. indica, T. gigantea and M. alba failed to inhibit 50% of larvae from feeding at concentrations up to 10mg plant extract per ml. In contrast, both G. sepium and L. leucocephala demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on larval feeding with respective IC50 estimates (mean±s.e.) of 0.015mg/ml±0.001 and 3.465mg/ml±0.144, effects which were partly reversed by the inclusion of either the tannin inhibitor polyethylene glycol or the lectin inhibitor Fetuin. These studies demonstrate that plant lectins can have an inhibitory effect on the feeding behaviour of first stage larvae of ovine GIN in vitro. Moreover they also provide novel evidence that lectins may contribute to the anthelmintic properties of some tropical forage plant extracts, such as G. sepium and L. leucocephala. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of soil properties on restoring indigenous plants in coral reef landscapes
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883710439&partnerID=40&md5=7972544d8820b622beac0870939de9bd
AB  - Restoring indigenous plants is an urgent concern in coral reef landscapes severely invaded by white leadtrees (Leucaena leucocephala). The efficiency of restoration is largely influenced by the spatial heterogeneity of soils and selecting suitable species. In this study, we evaluated the relationships of soil properties with the mortality and growth performance of restored seedlings, and clarify suitable species on the basis of some specific soil properties. Seventeen species of indigenous plant seedlings were randomly planted in the study area after clearcutting white leadtrees in southern Taiwan. At the beginning of seedling planting, 142 surface soil samples were collected in a grid for analysis, including the soil depth, bulk density, water content, organic matter contents, and soil texture. Mortality and physiological characteristics of the planted seedlings, including the plant height and root collar diameter, were also investigated at 22 mo after seedling planting. Based on analytical results of a principal components analysis (PCA) and correlations, the survival rate of seedlings was determined by the soil depth, soil texture, and soil water contents in the dry season (October to April of the following year). There were significant correlation of the survival rate of seedlings with soil depth (r = 0.58, p < 0.05), sand fraction (r = 0.63, p < 0.05), and clay fraction (r = -0.63, p < 0.05). During the dry seasons, soil water contents were always below the permanent wilting coefficient, especially in clayey soils (≥ 30% clay fraction contents) in the study area. Additionally, the investigation results indicated that the growth of plants responding to soils was species specific. Pandanus odoratissimus, Aglaia formosana, Cerbera manghas, Ficus superba var. japonica, Thespesia populnea, and Calophyllum inophyllum were independent of soil properties and were most suitable for restoration in coastal coral reef landscapes. Pongamia pinnata, Pittosporum pentandrum, Premna serratifolia, Hibiscus tiliaceus, and Planchonella obovata were sensitive to soil texture and moisture stress, and should be planted in the areas with sandy soils. Ficus septica and Hernanadia nymphaeifolia were susceptible to soil depth, and these 2 species should be planted in areas with thick soil depths (≥ 30 cm). Macaranga tanarius and Scaevola taccada were species favored to grow in high-pH (≥ 7.2) areas. Furthermore, F. benjamina. and Terminalia catappa are unsuitable species for restoration of coral reef landscapes.

TI  - In vitro ruminal fermentation parameters of tanner grass (Brachiaria arrecta) supplemented with leaves from three forage trees
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862886960&partnerID=40&md5=2b3b46f36f6e3488b13fd6dbb0704763
AB  - Grasses in the tropics are generally low in nitrogen (N) and this tends to negatively affect their utilization as ruminant feeds. Protein supplementation using tree forage leaves has the potential to increase the feeding value of grasses and animal productivity. The utility of tree leaves as protein supplements varies with chemical composition, which is in turn influenced by the prevailing biotic and abiotic growth environment of the tree. This study, therefore investigated the effect of incremental levels of Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, and Trichanthera gigantea leaves, grown in a river estate loam soil (pH 5.0 - 6.2) in Trinidad, on in vitro ruminal fermentation parameters of Brachiaria arrecta (tanner grass) utilizing the Reading Pressure Technique (Mauricio et al 1999). The objectives were to determine which supplement is superior and which inclusion level is the most effective. Tanner grass was supplemented in vitro with incremental levels (7.5, 15, 22.5 and 30% w/w) of L. leucocephala (T+Leuc), G. sepium (T+Glir), or T. gigantea (T+Trich) leaves. Gliricidia sepium supplementation promoted the highest increase (126%) in gas production from the immediately soluble fraction (a) when included at 15% level while L. leucocephala promoted the least increase (109%) at the same level. Gas production from the insoluble fraction (b) declined when leaves of G. sepium, L. leucocephala and T. gigantea were supplemented at 15%. Gas production rate constant for the insoluble fraction (c) increased by 100% as the leaves of G. sepium, L. leucocephala and T. gigantea were included at 15%. Potential gas production (a+b) showed a decline of 87, 86 and 83% when leaves of G. sepium, L. leucocephala and T. gigantea were included at 15%. There was a decrease in the lag phase (l) when leaves of all species were used as supplements. At 48-h post inoculation, cumulative gas production and in vitro organic matter degradability (iOMD) were highest (708 ml/g OM) and (545 g/kg DM) respectively, when G. sepium leaves were used as a supplement. Partitioning factors (PF) and predicted ME were highest when leaves of L. leucocephala and T. gigantea were supplemented at the 30% level. It is concluded that G. sepium is superior to the other tree species when supplemented at the 15% level.

AB  - Techniques of participative diagnosis for the identification and selection of promising species were used to conduct a prospective study of phytogenetic resources with animal feeding potential in two mountainous regions of Guantanamo province. Semi-structured surveys were made to farmers of this region, and a panel was created with the participation of nine experts on animal feeding and nutrition. The statistical analysis of the data was performed through contingency tables and the comparison of chi square proportions (ψ2). The species most used in animal feeding were the leaves of Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena), Gliricidia sepium (gliricidia), Guazuma ulmifolia (bastard cedar), and Brosimum alicastrum Swarts (breadnut), but also the fruit of Pithecellobium dulce (Madras thorn) as another alternative. The principal supply forms in El Salvador municipality were fresh forage (90 %) to housed animals (92 %) and daily grazing (85 %), from eight to ten hours, on species of the Panicum and Paspalum genera in gardens, backyards, or fallow or arable lands, considered as areas of little management. In the Baracoa municipality, the plant most (78%) used in animal feeding is coconut (Cocos nucifera). Sheep and goats are the ones consuming plant varieties the most (70 %). It was concluded that El Salvador and Baracoa municipalities, in Guantanamo province, have important species of high forage potential, able of complementing animal feeding in this area. In the Baracoa municipality, compared with El Salvador, there was lower use of the phytogenetic resources, as alternative source of animal feeding.

AB  - Two novel related Rhizobium species, Rhizobium grahamii sp. nov. and Rhizobium mesoamericanum sp. nov., were identified by a polyphasic approach using DNA-DNA hybridization, whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic and phenotypic characterization including nodulation of Leucaena leucocephala and Phaseolus vulgaris (bean). As similar bacteria were found in the Los Tuxtlas rainforest in Mexico and in Central America, we suggest the existence of a Mesoamerican microbiological corridor. The type strain of Rhizobium grahamii sp. nov. is CCGE 502T (=ATCC BAA-2124T =CFN 242T =Dal4T =HAMBI 3152T) and that of Rhizobium mesoamericanum sp. nov. is CCGE 501T (=ATCC BAA-2123T =HAMBI 3151T =CIP 110148T =1847T). © 2012 IUMS.

AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize the nutritional value of forage legumes Mimosa caesalpiniifolia (Benth.), Bauhinia cheilantha (Bong.) and Leucaena leucocephala (Lan.) and evaluate the anatomy of plants incubated and not incubated in the rumen. The experiment was conducted from September 2007 to November 2008. The experimental plot consisted of three useful plants, totaling three plots per block, and four repetitions. Plants were cut at 1 m height at intervals of 70 days; samples of leaf plus stem with a diameter smaller than 4 mm were collected for determination of dry matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, insoluble protein bound to acid detergent fiber and in vitro dry matter digestibility. The anatomical characterization occurred through theanalysis of the proportion of plant tissue nonincubated and incubated in the rumen for a period of 48 hours. The legumes had high crude protein, with an average of 26.1% to Leucena, 22.4% to Sabiá and 18.5% to Mororó, and low levels of in vitro digestibility of dry matter, with an average of 47.3% to Leucena, 42.8% to Mororó and37.2% to Sabiá. In the leaf blade of Sabiá plants, much lignified tissues that differed from plants of Leucena andMororó were observed. The degradation process was more visible in the leaves of the Leucena, Sabiá and Mororó plants. The degradation was more pronounced in the spongy parenchyma, leaving the incubated material intact. The average proportion of the epidermis in the incubated and not incubated leaves was 15.8 and 16.4% in Leucena, 16.8 and 19.2% in Mororóand 27.2 and 25.5% in Sabiá, respectively. There are differences in the digestion and nutritional value of leaf tissues of the evaluated legumes. © 2012 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia.

AB  - A commercial variety of Leucaena leucocephala K360 was used for pulp production and papermaking employing the soda-anthraquinone process. Also, the chemical and energy contents of the resultant black liquors were determined to simultaneously optimize: pulp and paper production and energy generation. A process temperature of (185°C), an operating time of (120min) and an active alkali concentration of (21%) provided sheets of paper with good strength (tensile index of 12.12Nm/g, burst index of 0.38kPam2/g, tear index of 1.29mNm2/g and a Kappa number of 20.5) and black liquor with a greater calorific value (14.1MJ/kg) than that obtained with higher active alkali concentrations.However, reducing the active alkali concentration to a level in the low operation range led to less marked degradation of cellulose and allowed paper sheets with good properties to be obtained and energy to be optimally produced from the black liquor. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Alopecia (i.e. hair loss) in ring-tailed lemurs, or "bald lemur syndrome", appeared in Berenty Reserve in the 1990s. The consumption of the leaves of Leucaena leucocephala , an introduced tree rich in toxic mimosine, has been linked to hair loss. Here, we show that individuals respond differently to the toxin, and bad fur condition is also in fluenced by other factors, particularly dietary diversity and social stress. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - This experiment in the Ord River Irrigation area (ORIA) of north Western Australia evaluated the liveweight gain of cattle rotationally grazing leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham)/pangola (Digitaria eriantha cv. Steudel) pastures alone, or supplemented with four levels of molasses (1.25, 2.50, 3.75, 5.00 kg molasses/head.day, as fed or fresh weight basis) or two levels of cracked maize supplementation (0.75, 1.50 kg/head.day, as fed or fresh weight basis). Seventy Bos indicus cross heifers [∼12 months of age, mean initial weight 252±3.8 (s.e.) kg] were allocated to the seven treatments and two replicates of each treatment (five cattle per replicate plus five additional similar heifers) with the stocking rate set at 6.25 head/ha. The experiment was conducted over 106 days of the dry season (AugustNovember). Each replicate paddock of 0.4 ha was rotationally grazed with 10 animals with a 7-day grazing period and a 21-day regrowth period for each rotation. The mean herbage mass, residual herbage mass and herbage allowance for the experiment were 3.78 t DM/ha, 3.07 t DM/ha and 7.32 kg DM/100 kg liveweight, respectively. Pangola contributed a mean of 0.79 of the herbage mass. There was a significant quadratic response of liveweight gain to level of molasses supplement (P<0.0087) with an optimum liveweight gain of 1.08 kg/head.day at a supplement level of 2.65 kg molasses/head.day or 8.9 g/kg LW.day derived from the quadratic equation. The quadratic equation was: Liveweight gain = 0.763(±0.0644) + 0.241(±0.0658)*M 0.046(±0.0126) *M2 (where M is level of molasses supplement kg/head.day). There was no significant response to level of maize supplement. There were no significant differences between treatments in the concentration of rumen ammonia N or volatile fatty acids or in the molar proportion of volatile fatty acids. It was concluded that molasses can be used effectively to increase the liveweight gain of cattle grazing leucaena/pangola pasture at a level of ∼8.9 g/kg LW.day. © 2012 CSIRO.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the livestock areas of a community that borders on a nature reserve in Chiapas. Pasturing units were classified, net aerial primary production was calculated as well as the digestibility of the predominant grass species (Brachiaria brizantha). Additionally, grazing burden was calculated and compared to the carrying capacity of the pastures. Three types of pastoral units were identified in relation to their tree density: Low Tree Density Pasture (24%), Medium Tree Density Pasture (54%), and High Tree Density Pasture (22%). Tree community composition mainly included citrus species such as orange (Citrus cinensis) and mandarine (Citrus aurantium), as well as forage trees such as Guazuma ulmifolia, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala. The grass species Brachiaria brizantha was identified in 85% of the pasture areas. In order to evaluate the effect of the type of pastoral unit and the cutting date on the primary production year-1 ha-1 of B. brizantha, a divided parcel design was designed with random complete blocks. No significant differences were found between types of pastoral units, but they were found between distinct cutting dates (15, 30 and 45 days), with the primary production reaching its height at 45 days (11 398 year-1 ha-1). Dry matter content and in vitro digestibility of B. brizantha were not influenced by the cutting date, but were influenced by the type of pastoral unit. The greatest dry matter content was obtained in Open pasture (37.9%), while the Medium tree density had the highest Digestibility (41.1%). The optimum point for grass use efficiency (found by combining highest primary production and digestibility) was found at 24 days. A total of 547 bovines were identified in the community, which represent 497 animal units and an apparent animal burden of 1.34 AU ha-1. Taking the carrying capacity of pastures and an assignation of 5% as a reference, each hectare of pasture can sustain a maximum of 1.17 AU per day. Results suggest that 45% of producers overgraze their pastures, 43% underuse them, and 12% achieve an appropriate use of pastures. These data can be used by conservation institutions to plan and regulate livestock raising activities in areas of conservation and high diversity.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of replacing noug (Guizotia abyssinica) (L. f.) Cass. seed cake by dried Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit leaves on feed intake, live weight gain, nutrient digestibility, and nitrogen balance of highland sheep in Tigray Region in northern Ethiopia. Twenty intact yearling male highland sheep weighing16. 9 ± 1. 62 kg were used in a randomized complete block design and included the following four treatments: T1 (control, wheat straw ad libitum + 200 g noug seed cake (NSC) + 150 g wheat bran (WB)); T2 (wheat straw ad libitum + 170 g NSC + 44. 3 g dried L. leucocephala (DLL) + 150 g WB); T3 (wheat straw ad libitum + 140 g NSC + 87. 3 g DLL + 150 g WB); and T4 (wheat straw ad libitum + 110 g NSC + 130. 2 g DLL + 150 g WB). Sheep fed on T4 diet consumed higher total dry matter (658 g/head/day) and recorded the highest average daily weight gain (59 g/head/day). Sheep fed on T4 diet had higher dry matter (61 %), organic matter (63 %), and crude protein (75 %) digestibility values than the other treatments. Sheep fed on T3 diet demonstrated higher feed conversion ratio (11. 93) than sheep kept on the other treatments. All sheep exhibited positive nitrogen balance, with the highest nitrogen retention being measured in T4 (12 g/head/day). It is concluded that partially replacing NSC by DLL can improve total dry matter intake, digestibility of nutrients, and body weight gain in highland sheep fed on wheat straw as the basal diet. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Tropical tree foliage and shrubs as feed additives in ruminant rations
PY  - 2013
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84895215319&partnerID=40&md5=a50b4f8abc7c1cf8715e1de36f4411d2
AB  - In the tropical regions of Mexico there are available many types of foliage and pods of trees and shrubs which hold potential to be used for ruminant feeding during critical periods of the year. This vegetation usually contains good concentrations of crude protein and fermentable carbohydrates but some are only seasonally available or may contain different types of secondary metabolites with potentially deleterious effects on animal health and productivity. This chapter presents some of the data obtained in this laboratory concerning the effect of the addition of several levels of foliage on intake, digestibility and productive performance of tropical sheep. When high quality foliage such as Brosimum alicastrum and Leucaena leucocephala are consumed by ruminants, they usually increase ammonia nitrogen concentration in the rumen and thus microbial protein synthesis in this organ. Dry matter intake was generally increased when highly fermentable foliage were added to the ration of sheep, increasing passage rate from the rumen. Types of tropical legumes such as pods of Enterolobium cyclocarpum and Acacia pennatula were added to the rations of growing sheep at various levels and the daily weight gain recorded was comparable to that obtained with concentrate rations, although feed conversion efficiency was lower. It is concluded that foliage and pods of tropical trees and shrubs have ample potential to improve ruminant production in the tropics, being able to even improve the quality of meat and milk by increasing the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids (conjugated linoleic acid or CLA) in ruminant products. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Effects of tropical high tannin non legume and low tannin legume browse mixtures on fermentation parameters and methanogenesis using gas production technique
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867542053&doi=10.5713%2fajas.2012.12219&partnerID=40&md5=46336abab86d448cbe21200796b7ddb3
AB  - In vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the suitability of several mixtures of high tanniniferous non legumes with low tanniniferous legumes on in vitro gas production (IVGP), dry matter degradation, Ammonia-N, methane production and microbial population. Eight treatments were examined in a randomized complete block design using four non-legumes and two legumes (Carallia integerrima×Leucaena leucocephala (LL) (Trt 1), C. integerrima×Gliricidia sepium (GS) (Trt 2), Aporosa lindeliyana×LL (Trt 3), A. lindeliyana×GS (Trt 4), Ceiba perntandra×LL (Trt 5), C. perntandra×GS (Trt 6), Artocarpus heterophyllus×LL (Trt 7), A. heterophyllus×GS (Trt 8). The condensed tannin (CT) content of non legumes ranged from 6.2% (Carallia integerrima) to 4.9% (Ceiba perntandra) while the CT of legumes were 1.58% (Leucaena leucocephala) and 0.78% (Gliricidia sepium). Forage mixtures contained more than 14% of crude protein (CP) while the CT content ranged from 2.8% to 4.0% respectively. Differences (p<0.05) were observed in in vitro gas production (IGVP) within treatments over a 48 h period dominated by C. perntandra×G. sepium (Trt 6). The net gas production (p<0.05) was also high with Trt6 followed by A. heterophyllus×L. leucocephala (Trt 7) and A. heterophyllus×G. sepium (Trt 8). Highest (p>0.05) NH3-N (ml/200 mg DM) production was observed with the A. heterophyllus×G. sepium (Trt 8) mixture which may be attributed with it's highest CP content. The correlation between IVGP and CT was 0.675 while IVGP and CP was 0.610. In vitro dry matter degradation (IVDMD) was highest in Trt 8 as well. Methane production ranged from 2.57 to 4.79 (ml/200 mg DM) to be synonimous with IVGP. A higher bacteria population (p<0.05) was found in C. perntandra×G. sepium (Trt 6) followed by Artocarpus heterophyllus+G. sepium (Trt 8) and the same trend was observed with the protozoa population as well. The results show that supplementing high tannin non leguminous forages by incremental substitution of legume forage increased gas production parameters, NH3-N, IVDMD and microbial population in the fermentation liquid. Methane production was not significantly affected by the presence of CT or different levels of CP in forage mixtures. Among non legumes, Ceiba perntandra and Artocarpus heterophyllus performed better in mixture with L. leucocephala and G. sepium.

AB  - Contour hedgerow can efficiently improve soil structure and its ecological performance, retain soil nutrients and prevent non-point pollutants in sloping land. Effects of Leucaena Leucocephala hedgerow on the physical properties in 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layer were evaluated under two kinds of land utilization patterns in 1.471%, 1.504% plots on sloping land in the purple soil area. Results indicate that in cropland plots, hedgerow had great influence on vertical distribution of soil microaggregates of both 1.471% and 1.504% slope plots. Hedgerows affects soil microaggregates of both slopes in 0-20 cm soil layer much better than that of 20-40 cm soil layer. © 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Impact of weed control on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in a tropical agroecosystem: A long-term experiment
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867997297&doi=10.1007%2fs00572-012-0443-1&partnerID=40&md5=e0db6033196c8216fb0e4b2158e38b38
AB  - Cover crop species represent an affordable and effective weed control method in agroecosystems; nonetheless, the effect of its use on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has been scantily studied. The goal of this study was to determine root colonization levels and AMF species richness in the rhizosphere of maize plants and weed species growing under different cover crop and weed control regimes in a long-term experiment. The treatment levels used were (1) cover of Mucuna deeringian (Muc), (2) "mulch" of Leucaena leucocephala (Leu), (3) "mulch" of Lysiloma latisiliquum (Lys), (4) herbicide (Her), (5) manual weeding (CD), (6) no weeding (SD), and (7) no maize and no weeding (B). A total of 18 species of AMF belonging to eight genera (Acaulospora, Ambispora, Claroideoglomus, Funneliformis, Glomus, Rhizophagus, Sclerocystis, and Scutellospora) were identified from trap cultures. Muc and Lys treatments had a positive impact on AMF species richness (11 and seven species, respectively), while Leu and B treatments on the other hand gave the lowest richness values (six species each). AMF colonization levels in roots of maize and weeds differed significantly between treatment levels. Overall, the use of cover crop species had a positive impact on AMF species richness as well as on the percentage of root colonized by AMF. These findings have important implications for the management of traditional agroecosystems and show that the use of cover crop species for weed control can result in a more diverse AMF community which should potentially increase crop production in the long run. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This review provides a broad view of the processes and parameters involved in applying agrochemicals to the leaves of field crops. Treatment efficiency is assessed using macroscopic and microscopic approaches to investigate spray retention. With the macroscopic approach, aspects related to spray coarseness, carrier volume, leaf wettability, plant architecture, crop density and additives are addressed. Comparative studies have highlighted the wide variability in spray retention as a function of these parameters. They have failed, however, to describe the underlying physical relationships clearly enough to generalize the results. These relationships are better investigated using a microscopic approach, where drop impact behavior is established in relation to target surface and fluid properties. The wetting regime (either Wenzel or Cassie-Baxter) depends on the leaf surface microscopic roughness ratio (r) and chemical nature, fluid dynamic surface tension and drop impact energy. Adhesion, rebound and disintegration have been observed successively with increasing drop impact energy. Transitions between impact outcomes are influenced by fluid rheology and the dynamic surface tension of the fluid. The effect of surface orientation remains poorly explored, but it seems to have a limited influence on retention. Recent fundamental studies on superhydrophobicity and wetting should help practitioners in their search for an ever more rational application of agrochemicals. They could also drive the development of new systematic retention testing methods.

TI  - Anatomical Changes During Transition from Juvenile to Adult Wood in Branch and Main Trunk Xylem of Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala [Lam.] de Wit)

AB  - The anatomical changes occurring during transition from juvenile to mature wood were studied in the branch and main trunk of Leucaena leucocephala. To confirm the wood maturity in the 5-yr-old tree, the anatomical features were compared with the adult wood collected from the main trunk of a 15-yr-old tree. In both the branch and wood of the trunk, most of the anatomical features-such as increase in dimensions of fibers and vessel elements, and decrease in frequency of vessel elements and rays-were gradual during radial growth from pith to periphery. A noticeable anatomical change is observed in the transition of triseriate rays to multiseriate rays in the region of wood which is about 5.5 cm away from the pith. The ray dimensions and anatomical features of other elements from the periphery of the branch and 5-yr-old trunk xylem match with that of 15-yr-old main trunk wood. This indicates that in both the branches and main trunk of Leucaena, transition from juvenile to adult or mature wood occurs after the trees have attained 14 cm radial growth. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Three legumes (Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Enterolobium cyclocarpum) and elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) were ensiled with different proportions of cassava peel (0, 25 and 50% on a wet basis). Physical characteristics of silage, pH and chemical composition were assessed at 21 days of ensiling. Twelve zebu heifers were used to assess preference for the silages. All silages were firm in texture while smell was greatly influenced by the original fresh forage. The color varied from light green with elephant grass to brown with leucaena. The pH ranged from 3.6 to 5.4, the silage with cassava peel had the lower values. Crude protein level varied from 6.7 to 22.9 and crude fibre from 12.0 to 24.0%. The addition of cassava peel to the legumes greatly reduced silage pH, while protein levels were maintained at acceptable levels for ruminants. The order of preference was: elephant grass > leucaena > gliricidia > enterolobium. Legume forages with their high protein ensiled with cassava peel can contribute to solving the problem of poor nutrition and low milk production in zebu cattle in Nigeria.

AB  - The fabrication of single patch antenna for proposed Leucaena Leucocephala ('Petai Belalang') Wood Plastic Composite (WPC) substrate board and FR4 substrate board is presented in this paper. The experiment objective was to measure the performance of an antenna fabricated on the proposed board by comparing the performance in term of Dielectric Constant value, Tangent Loss value, Return Loss, Radiation Pattern and Gain with antenna fabricated onto FR4 material substrate board. The idea is to find the potential alternative board replacing conventional printed circuit board (PCB) using commercial FR4 material. The dielectric constant and tangent loss value for both proposed and FR4 substrate board were analyzed with Agilent 85070E Dielectric Probe Kit method. The Fabricated proposed boards were studied in the frequency range of 2.2 to 3.3 GHz since this board will be used in ISM band application that occupied 2.45 GHz frequency spectrum. The parameter composition of proposed board on this paper was focused only on one density composition that is 70% of polypropylene and 30% of leucaena leucocephala filler wood with particle size maintained at 150 μM and moisture content of the filler is less than 5%. The indoor Practical Antenna Measurement method was used to prove the proposed antenna can be used as transmitting antenna and all result obtained were form as data and graph analysis. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Red soil is an important rural soil in Taiwan. Long-term cultivation and unsuitable chemical fertilizer application accelerate soil degradation. Therefore, sustainable maintenance of soil quality and crop productivity is an urgent issue for agriculture now. This study used a forestry waste, woods of white leadtree (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit), to prepare a wood biochar as an soil amendment, which was incorporated into the acicic red soils for 3 months incubation. This study aimed to evaluate the variation of soil fertility and the dynamic changes of nutrients. The experimental results indicated that applying biochar into the soil significantly increased soil pH from 4.0 to 5.1, organiccarbon contents increased at least 7.0 g kg-1 and base saturation percentages were 2 times at least than those of un-amended soils. Furthermore, microbial biomass carbon, exchangeable nitrogen and available phosphorous contents were also increased with increasing applying rate of biochar. The increasing amounts of mentioned-above properties were positively related to applying rates of biochar. As a whole, applying biochar into the red soil could improve soil qualities and retain soil fertility efficiently.

AB  - Ruminal, intestinal and total tract digestibility of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), Madras thorn (Pithecellobium dulce) and moringa (Moringa oleifera) fodders were measured in this study, using nylon bag and mobile bag techniques. Three cattle were fitted with permanent rumen and duodenal cannulae. Intestinal digestibility was measured using the mobile nylon bag (MNB) technique with or without incubation in a pepsin-HCl solution, and a three-step in vitro technique. The rate of ruminal disappearances of DM and CP, and the potential degradation of CP from nylon bags of both Madras thorn and moringa fodders were significantly higher than that for leucaena fodder. Potential degradation (A+B) values of CP were 45.6%, 54.2% and 52.8% for leucaena, Madras thorn and moringa fodders, respectively. Average DM and CP digestibility in the intestine and total tract for both Madras thorn and moringa fodders were significantly higher than for leucaena fodder. Average digestibility of DM and CP in the intestine and total tract measured using MNB without pepsin-HCl solution was significantly lower than with pepsin-HCl and with the three-step methods. These data suggest that the results of in vivo and in vitro methods for estimating intestinal digestibility are similar, though in all methods the incubation in a pepsin-HCl solution is necessary. © Copyright resides with the authors.

AB  - Pastures are the fodder supply of Brazilian livestock, and are exhaustively degraded by nitrogen (N) deficiency. Intercropping with legumes, aside from nitrogen fixation, may have secondary effects on soil fertility, such as acidification or nutrient movement from deeper to the surface soil layers. This study evaluated the soil litter stock and fertility of degraded Brachiaria decumbens pastures after planting leguminous shrubs and forage trees. For this purpose, we sampled (March 2010) degraded Brachiaria decumbens pasture planted in July 2008 in an intercropping experiment with sabiá (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), mororó (Bauhinia cheilantha) and gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), as well as N-fertilized and unfertilized brachiaria. Soil and litter was sampled (layers 0-10, 10-20 and 20-40 cm) in three transects, at alternating points covered by grasses and by legumes, totaling seven composite samples per plot to determine soil pH, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Al and calculate sum of bases, effective cation exchange capacity and aluminum saturation. Litter was visually separated in legumes, grasses and unidentified material to quantify dry matter, organic matter, N, P, C, acid-detergent fiber, and lignin. The use of legumes increased the levels of total N in litter and reduced the C: N ratios, especially of gliricidia and sabiá, although the lignin levels in the latter were high. There was a significant effect of legume soil cover, with no differences between them, on pH and K (layer 0-10 cm) and on pH, K and Al (layer 10-20 cm).

AB  - The quality of cattle feed supplements may be enhanced by the addition of certain vegetable components which improve its nutritional value. However, these structural components may vary according to the climate conditions prevalent during the seasonal changes in temperate or subtropical areas. Leaves and pods of Gliricidia sepium and Leucaenas leucocephala are integrated with food and pasture crops and considered important forage complements into ruminant feeding. In order to determine the effectiveness of the use of G. sepium and L. Leucocephala as fodder, samples of leaves were collected for estimation of some of their chemical characteristics, cell wall components and mineral composition. The highest value of crude protein (24.6%) and lowest gross energy (4.095 Meal kg" 1) were exhibited by L. leucocephala while the highest NDF (45.8%), ADF (24.5%), cellulose (14.6%) and cellular content were observed in G. sepium. Results from the proximate analysis revealed significant (p<0.05) differences in Crude Protein (CP), P, Mg, Fe, Na, Gross Energy (GE), ash, Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Acid-Detergent Lignm (ADL), cellulose, hemicellulose contents and IVDMD among the species. © 2012 Medwell Journals.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to evaluate milk yield, postpartum (pp) ovarian activity and pregnancy rate in dual-purpose cows grazing Cynodon nlemfuensis and browsing L. leucocephala, with or without energy supplementation. Twenty-four Bos taurus × B. indicus cows were divided in two groups from calving to 70 days post-calving: supplemented group (SG) with ground sorghum grain offered at 0.4% of live weight at calving and control group (CG) without supplement. There was a trend for milk yield (kg day -1) to be greater (p = 0.08) for SG (10.55 ± 0.51) compared to CG (9.53 ± 0.61), although without differences in fat (0.42 ± 0.02 vs. 0.38 ± 0.03 kg day -1), protein (0.29 ± 0.02 vs. 0.29 ± 0.02 kg day -1) or lactose (0.49 ± 0.02 vs. 0.49 ± 0.03 kg day -1) concentration. Populations of large, medium and small follicles were similar between treatments. Percentage of cows which showed corpus luteum tended to be greater in SG (50%), compared to CG (33%). Supplemented cows tended to have a shorter calving-first corpus luteum interval (40 ± 10 vs. 51 ± 10 days) and had a significantly higher (χ 2 = 0.03) pregnancy rate (42% vs. 0%). It is concluded that energy supplementation helped to improve ovarian activity and pregnancy rate. Since supplementation did not avoid loss of body condition, the higher pregnancy rate in SG suggests beneficial effects of supplementation probably mediated by metabolic hormones. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Litterfall from trees enriches the organic matter and nutrient content of soil under the trees. The influence of four tree species was evaluated on soil organic carbon (OC), available macro- (N, P and K) and DTPA- micronutrient (Zn, Fe, Mn and Cu) content in the soil profile. Depthwise (0-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-90 and 90-120 cm) soil samples were collected from 17 years old Leucaena leucocephala (subabul), Dalbergia sissoo (shisham), Acacia catechu (khair) and Acacia nilotica (kikar) spaced at 3 m x 3 m and adjoining open area considered as control, from PAU Research Station, Ballowal Saunkhri in sub-montane zone of Punjab. The samples were analysed for OC and nutrient content and the results stated that the accumulation of soil OC and nutrients was higher under trees than control. Soil OC and nutrient content decreased with increase in depth irrespective of tree species. The soil OC increased by 107% under shisham followed by kikar (92.4%) over control (3.30 g kg-1) in the surface soil layer. The N content was higher under subabul (87.9 mg kg-1 in surface layer); whereas P and K were higher under kikar (9.5 and 142 mg kg-1, respectively in surface layer) than other tree species. Available micronutrients were higher beneath subabul and kikar than shisham and khair in the surface layer as well as whole soil profile. Therefore, the tree plantations can improve the nutrient availability in the soil profile.

TI  - Feeding of tropical trees and shrub foliages as a strategy to reduce ruminal methanogenesis: Studies conducted in Cuba
PY  - 2012

AB  - The aim of this paper was to present the main results obtained in Cuba on the effects of feeding tropical trees and shrubs on rumen methanogenesis in animals fed with low quality fibrous diets. More than 20 tree and shrub foliages were screened for phytochemicals and analyzed for chemical constituents. From these samples, seven promising plants (Samanea saman, Albizia lebbeck, Tithonia diversifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Trichantera gigantea, Sapindus saponaria, and Morus alba) were evaluated for methane reduction using an in vitro rumen fermentation system. Results indicated that the inclusion levels of 25% of Sapindo, Morus, or Trichantera foliages in the foliages/grass mixtures (grass being Pennisetum purpureum) reduced (P < 0.01) methane production in vitro when compared to Pennisetum alone (17.0, 19.1, and 18.0 versus 26.2 mL CH 4/g fermented dry matter, respectively). It was demonstrated that S. saman, A. lebbeck, or T. diversifolia accession 23 foliages when mixed at the rate of 30% in Cynodon nlemfuensis grass produced lower methane compared to the grass alone. Inclusion levels of 15% and 25% of a ruminal activator supplement containing 29% of L. leucocehala foliage meal reduced methane by 37% and 42% when compared to the treatment without supplementation. In vivo experiment with sheep showed that inclusion of 27% of L. leucocephala in the diet increased the DM intake but did not show significant difference in methane production compared to control diet without this foliage. The results of these experiments suggest that the feeding of tropical tree and shrub foliages could be an attractive strategy for reduction of ruminal methanogenesis from animals fed with low-quality forage diets and for improving their productivity. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The effect of exogenous ethephon and its combination with gibberellic acid (GA3), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and benzyl amino purine (BAP) on tension wood formation in the vertically growing shoots of Leucaena leucocephala has been studied using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The application of exogenous ethephon induced tension wood formation. The percentage of tension wood severity in the shoots was directly proportional to the concentration of ethephon applied. SEM studies revealed the replacement of S2 and S3 fibre wall layers with the gelatinous layer (G-layer) in response to high concentration of ethephon. Ethephon exhibited synergistic interaction with GA3 and BAP in tension wood formation. Fibres and vessel elements in tension wood, induced by ethylene and its combination with other hormones showed increase or decrease in their dimensions irrespective of their concentration and combination. The density of rays increased in all the treatments except in the combination of ethephon and IAA. The anatomical data indicate that ethylene plays a major role in tension wood formation and it interacts synergistically with gibberellins and cytokinin. On the other hand, such synergistic interaction was not found between ethephon and IAA in tension wood formation. © 2012 Indian Academy of Wood Science.

AB  - A study was conducted on a soil with loamy-sandy texture to assess the agronomic, physiological and productive performance of Leucaena leucocephala in high sowing density under coconut tree. A random block design was used with factorial fit. The factors analyzed were: sowing density, with three levels of 40, 60 and 80 thousand plants of leucaena/ha, and tree age, at 5, 40, 55, 70, 85 and 100 d, with three replicates. The sowing was conducted on February 2009, at depth from 2 to 3 cm. The seeds were scarified and inoculated with rhizobium and mycorrhizae. After 20 d the tree emerged, the treatments were fertilized with the formula 00-20-10-20, provided by diatom land in dosages of 700 kg/ha. The manual control of weeds in the area was conducted. In all the variables studied there was interaction effect (P < 0.001). The best values found at 100 d of age were for the treatment with 80 thousand plants of leucaena/ha in stem diameter (1.27 cm), dry weight of leaves (49.54 g), dry weight of plant (72.61 g), biomass production (6159 kg/ha), productive rate (61.59 kg DM/d/ha) and water use efficiency (6.84 kg DM/m3). These numbers were statistically similar to those obtained with 60 thousand plants of leucaena/ha, for plant height (133.67 and 138.28 cm) and number of leaves (23.94 and 24.72). The sowing of 80 thousand plants of leucaena/ha associated with coconut tree, as high density system, could be proposed as alternative for intensifying the agrosilvopastoral systems in the tropical area.

AB  - This paper reports a fabrication method generating biomimetic hierarchical structures simulating the lotus leaf's surface resulting in superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning functions. The surface micro-patterns were imprinted on a hard sol-gel protective coating by a template made by the laser direct ablation technique. Bump structures were precisely controlled. The nano-structures were superimposed by self-assembled surface modified silica nanoparticles, forming two scale hierarchical structures. The water contact angle of the micropatterned surface after imprinting was 138°, which was further increased to 160.3° with hysteresis of 0.9° by superimposing nanoparticles. The superhydrophobicity is comparable to the natural lotus leaf and the hierarchical structure is an optimal combination of micro- and nano-structures, which mimics the lotus leaf's surface. A comprehensive theoretical model which combines Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter states including the transition mode and the roughness factor predicted the air-trapping fraction as being 83% on the optimum structure. This fabrication method is fast, cost effective and reproducible for large areas. This paper also provides a design guideline for predetermined experimental parameters to achieve the lotus leaf effect. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Four swamp buffaloes (Bubalus Bubalis) with average body weight of 238±27 kg were randomly assigned to receive four dietary treatments according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. The treatments were supplemented with Leucaena leucocephala leaves (LLP) and were as follows: Treatment (T1) = LLP supplementation at 0 g/h/d (control); T2 = LLP supplementation at 150 g/ h/d; T3= LLP supplementation at 300 g/ h/d; T4= LLP supplementation at 450 g/ h /d. All animals were fed with concentrate (14.2 % CP, 76 % TDN) at 0.5% BW and offered with rice straw ad libitum. It was found that dry matter intake and ruminal NH3-N (16.2 mg/dl) were increased at highest LLP supplementation, but no effect on rumen pH. Apparent digestibilities of DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF were significantly increased (P<0.05) when increasing LLP supplementation and was highest at 450 g/h/d. Ruminal NH3-N concentration was significantly different among treatments (P<0.05), and was highest when buffaloes were fed at 450 g/ h /d (16.2 mg/dl). Blood urea-nitrogen (BUN) concentrations were not significantly different (P>0.05) among treatments but tended to be increased with enhancing levels of LLP supplementation (9.0-11.6 mg/dl), respectively. Total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) and proportion of propionic acid (C3) were differed among treatments and ranged from 88.6 to 100.8 mmol/l and 23.4 to 27.7 mmol/l, respectively. The concentrations of acetic acid (C2) and butyric acid (C4) were found decreased when increasing level of LLP from 300 to 450 g/ h /d while the ratio of acetic acid to propionic acid were decreased when supplementation of LLP from 300- 450 kg/ h /d. Based on this study, it could be concluded that supplementation of LLP at 450 g/ h /d with rice straw can improve voluntary intake, digestibility and rumen fermentation parameters in swamp buffaloes.

AB  - In this study, seed predation rates imposed by bruchines and the composition of bruchine species and their host plants were assessed in a heterogeneous landscape in southeastern Brazil. Fruits were collected from 49 plants from 16 species belonging to four families, primarily Fabaceae. The five bruchine species collected emerged from four plant species as follows: Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) from Leucaena leucocephala (Lamarck) de Wit, Acanthoscelides sp. from Senna hirsuta (L.) Irwin and Barneby, Ctenocolum podagricus (F.) from Lonchocarpus mehlbergianus Hassler, and Gibbobruchus polycoccus (Fhraeus) and Gibbobruchus speculifer (Gyllenhal) from Bauhinia forficata Link. Bauhinia forficata is here recorded for the first time as a host for G. polycoccus. Only 1/4 of the local flora that was surveyed hosted bruchines. Bruchine and plant species composition varied among habitats, with most beetles found in plants located in the most disturbed habitat. Because of the economic importance of L. leucocephala in the tropics, we compared germination percentages between attacked and unattacked seeds of this species. The unattacked seeds had an average germination rate of 59%, and none of the attacked seeds germinated, showing that the germination of L. leucocephala seeds was drastically affected by predation.

AB  - This paper studied effects of vetiver hedgerow and leucaena leucocephala hedgerow on fractal characteristics and erodibility of the purple soil. It took fractal dimension of PSD (particle-size distribution) to describe soil fractal characteristics, and EPIC (erosion-productivity impact calculator) to calculate values of soil erodibility factor K. Results showed that:(1) hedgerows affected spatial distributions of soil particles as small ones reduced in CK (check) plots, but increased in hedgerow plots.(2) Variations of PSD fractal dimension had negative linear correlation with variations of sand content with correlation coefficient of 0.828, but had positive linear correlations with variations of silt content and clay content with correlation coefficients of 0.638, 0.898.(3) Values of K decreased in 10° plots with hedgerows, especially with vetiver hedgerows.(4) Variations of K had significant positive correlations with variations of sand content and dispersion coefficient of micro-aggregate (particle size < 0.002mm), and their correlation coefficients were 0.980 and 0.836. Variations of K had negative correlation with variations of silt content, clay content, organic carbon content and aggregation rate, and their correlation coefficients were 0.925, 0.833, 0.787 and 0.716. (5) Vetiver is more suitable than Leucaena leucocephala for popularization and application on control of the purple soil erosion. © 2012 TSI Press.

TI  - Developing a soil quality index for ravinous ustifluvents of the semi-arid region of India
PY  - 2012

AB  - Understanding impacts and processes involved induced by changes in land use pattern is a key issue for management policies which helps in formulation of land restoration and reclamation strategies. A study was conducted at ravinous landform of the Ustifluvents of the Yamuna region to select the most sensitive soil quality indicators, which may reflect on the state of soil condition. Three different land use systems (forest, agriculture and uncultivated ravinous wasteland-reference land) were selected for the study. In forest land use the most prevalent species (Jatropha curcas, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica and Prosopis juliflora) of the semi-arid regions were selected. An uncultivated ravinous wasteland located adjacent to agriculture and forest land uses was selected as reference site for comparison. The entire data of soil properties under different land use systems were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) for identification of sensitive indicators. Correlation analyses amongst the highly weighed variables were done to remove the redundant parameters. In order to develop the soil quality index and assess the relative degradation status of different land uses, the sensitive indicators were normalized to 0-1 scale by different scoring functions and finally an index was developed by using an additive model. The sensitive indicators (minimum dataset) under the ravinous Ustifluvent in descending order of importance as revealed by factor analysis were as follows: exchangeable Na > available N > sand content > active carbon > available K > available P. The soil quality index developed for the site could be used as a decision making tool for formulation of policies leading to land restoration and reclamation of ravinous wasteland of the semi-arid region of India.

TI  - Effects of energy level and Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal as a protein source on rumen fermentation efficiency and digestibility in swamp buffalo
PY  - 2012

AB  - Four Thai - rumen fistulated male swamp buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), about 3 years old with 360±18kg liveweight, were randomly assigned according to a 2×2 factorial arrangement in a 4×4 Latin square design to receive four dietary treatments. The treatments were as follows: a cassava based supplement (CS) at 1g/kg BW and Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM) at 300g/d (T1); CS at 2g/kg BW with LLM at 300g/d (T2); CS at 1g/kg BW and heat treated LLM (HLLM) at 300g/d (T3); and CS at 2g/kg BW and HLLM at 300g/d. During the experiment, urea-calcium hydroxide treated rice straw was given on ad libitum basis. The results revealed an increase in roughage and total dry matter (DM) intake (P<0.05) by CS at 2g/kg BW (T2 and T4) as compared with CS at 1g/kg BW (T1 and T3). Digestion coefficients of DM, organic matter (OM), and crude protein (CP) were increased by CS at 2g/kg BW, while neutral detergent fiber (aNDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were similar among treatments. However, there was no effect of neither energy level nor HLLM on ruminal pH and temperature (P>0.05). Concentration of ruminal ammonia nitrogen (NH 3-N) was decreased by HLLM as compared with LLM (P<0.05), while blood urea-nitrogen was not altered. There was an increase (P<0.05) in total volatile fatty acid (TVFA), acetic acid (C2), propionic acid (C3), and butyric acid (C4) concentrations and the highest were found in CS at 2g/kg BW with HLLM (T4), while the lowest was in T1 and T3. However, no changes in C2-C3 ratio were found in this study. Total bacterial direct counts were found different (P<0.05), whereas fungal zoospores and protozoal populations were similar among treatments. Nevertheless, viable bacterial counts were found affected by both concentrate level and HLLM. The treatments with HLLM were lower than those in LLM and CS at 2g/kg BW were higher than those supplemented at CS at 1g/kg BW (P<0.05). In addition, efficiency of rumen microbial CP synthesis tended to be higher in treatment with higher level of energy and HLLM. Based on this study, it could be concluded that LLM could be used as a protein source, while the combination of HLLM and CS at 2g/kg BW could enhance the voluntary feed intake, nutrient digestibility and rumen fermentation in swamp buffalo fed on treated rice straw (urea-calcium hydroxide treatment). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of mimosine (MI), which is an amino acid that is derived from Leucaena leucocephala, were evaluated on the growth of ascitic Ehrlich tumors, and the effects of the combination treatment of MI and cyclophosphamide (CY) on tumor growth were also assessed. Mice were divided into groups that received the following treatments over the course of 20 days: phosphate buffer solution (CO), MI, Ehrlich cells (E), E plus CY (EC), E plus MI (EM) and E plus MI and CY (EMC). No signs of toxicity were detected in the mice from the MI group. The mice from the EMC group showed reductions in body weights when compared with those from the E group. The animals from the EC, EM and EMC groups showed reductions in ascitic volume compared with those from the E group. The mice from the EMC group showed reductions in total cell numbers of ascitic fluid compared with those from the E, EC and EM groups. The combination of MI and CY was the most effective treatment for Ehrlich tumor ascites.

AB  - Tanniferous forages may have bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal effect on different rumen microbial populations. We investigated the influence of the tropical tanniferous plants Styzolobium aterrimum (STA), Styzolobium deeringianum (STD), Leucaena leucocephala (LEU), and Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia (MIC) containing 20, 64, 56, and 105 g condensed tannis (CT)/kg dry matter (DM) and Cynodon spp. cv. Tifton 85 (CYN) as control on Fibrobacter succinogenes and methanogenic microbes in rumen liquor from sheep using the in vitro gas production technique (Hohenheim gas test). The relative gene expression of F. succinogenes at t1/2 (time point when 50% of the maximal gas production has been reached) analyzed by quantitative PCR was 0.20- and 0.28- fold lower than the control when LEU and STA was applied and 0.91- and 0.85-fold lower with MIC and STD. Methanogenic population was 0.29- and 0.58- fold reduced with STA and LEU compared to the control, but 5.50- and 1.43- fold higher with MIC and STD. At 24 h, F. succinogenes was reduced for all legumes as well as methanogenic bacteria, except for MIC which increased 4.15-fold. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the methanogenic community resulted in different band patterns: CYN presented some strong bands, which became weaker in the analyzed treatments. Some bands appeared weaker, especially in MIC and STD, but not in STA and LEU. MIC seemed to increase the total number of weak bands. Overall, the tannin-rich plants negatively affected the F. succinogenes population and caused changes in the structure of the methanogenic community.

TI  - Determinants of tree species preference for foraging by insectivorous birds in a novel Prosopis-Leucaena woodland in Puerto Rico: The role of foliage palatability
PY  - 2013
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84881027696&doi=10.1007%2fs10531-013-0529-x&partnerID=40&md5=83f540df44709fdf8657e3f122c2d8ae
AB  - The foliage palatability hypothesis predicts that avian insectivores will preferentially forage in tree species with the greatest abundance of their arthropod prey, which in turn are associated with the tree's foliage nutrition and palatability. We tested this hypothesis in a novel Prosopis-Leucaena woodland in Puerto Rico by determining foraging preferences of five insectivorous bird species for six tree species (five alien, one native) and relating preferences to foliage arthropod biomass and leaf chemistry. The most frequently preferred tree species for foraging were the alien Prosopis juliflora (preferred by five bird species) and Pithecellobium dulce (preferred by four bird species). Both species had high foliage arthropod biomass, high N content, low lignin/N ratios, and low hemicellulose content. Compounds, previously known to affect herbivore responses to Albizia lebbeck and Leucaena leucocephala, may explain low arthropod biomass despite high N content in Albizia and avoidance of Leucaena by four bird species despite its high arthropod biomass. The native Bucida buceras had tough leaves with low N content, low arthropod biomass, and only one bird species showed a weak preference for foraging in it. Biomass of predaceous arthropods showed strong negative correlations with the ratios of lignin/N and hemicellulose/N. Some alien tree species had highly palatable foliage with high arthropod biomass and hence were preferred for foraging by avian insectivores as predicted by the foliage palatability hypothesis. High foliage palatability of some alien tree species may weaken the effect of enemy release in some novel plant communities. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

PY  - 2012

AB  - Background: Plant tannins as rumen modifiers are better than chemicals or antibiotic-based modifiers since these compounds are natural products which are environmentally friendly and therefore have a better acceptance with regard to feed safety issues. Tropical plants containing phenols such as tannins were found to suppress or eliminate protozoa from the rumen and reduce methane and ammonia production. The screening of these plants is an important step in the identification of new compounds and feed additives which might contribute to mitigate rumen methanogenesis. The present study was carried out to determine the efficacy of tannins from tropical tree leaves for their methane reduction properties. Results: Activity of tannins, as represented by the increase in gas volume with the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000 as a tannin binder (tannin bioassay) was highest in Ficus bengalensis (555%), followed by Azardirachta indica (78.5%). PEG addition did not alter (P > 0.05) methane percentage in Ficus racemosa, Glyricidia maculata, Leucena leucocephala, Morus alba and Semaroba glauca, confirming that tannins in these samples did not affect methanogenesis. The increase (P < 0.05) in protozoa population with PEG was maximal in Ficus religiosa (50), followed by Moringa oleifera (31.2), Azardirachta indica (29.9) and Semaroba glauca (27.5). There was no change (P > 0.05) in the protozoa population in Autocarpus integrifolia, Ficus bengalensis, Jatropha curcus, Morus alba and Sesbania grandiflora, demonstrating that methane reduction observed in these samples per se was not due to defaunation effect of the tannin. The increase in total volatile fatty acid concentration in samples with PEG ranged from 0.6% to > 70%. The highest increase (%) in NH3-N was recorded in Azardirachta indica (67.4), followed by Ficus mysoriensis (35.7) and Semaroba glauca (32.6) leaves, reflecting strong protein binding properties of tannin. Conclusion: The results of our study established that in vitro methanogenesis was not essentially related to the density of protozoa population. Tropical tree leaves containing tannins such as Autocarpus integrifolia, Jatropha curcus and Sesbania grandiflora have the potential to suppress methanogenesis. Therefore tannins contained in these plants could be of interest in the development of new additives in ruminant nutrition. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - This paper aimed to select species with potential for phytoremediation of soils contaminated with the herbicide sulfentrazone. Eight species were evaluated: Arachis pintoi, Eleusine coracana, Crotalaria spectabilis, Crotalaria ochroleuca, Cajanus cajan, Leucaena leucocephala, Stizolobium cinereum, and Raphanus sativus. The experiment was set-up inside a greenhouse, using pots with a capacity of 6dm3 filled with soil samples collected at a depth of 0-20cm. The experimental design was arranged into randomised blocks in a factorial scheme (8 × 5) with four replications, which consisted of the combination between the species and five doses of sulfentrazone (0, 200, 400, 800, and 1,600g ha-1). The herbicide phytotoxicity, plant heights, and dry masses of shoots and roots were evaluated. The species Cajanus cajan and Leucaena leucocephala had a higher tolerance to sulfentrazone up to a dose of 400g ha-1, showing minor symptoms of phytotoxicity and smaller decreases in plant heights and in dry matter accumulation, both in the shoots and roots, when compared to the control treatment, indicating, thus, the potential to be used for further studies on phytoremediation of sulfentrazone in soil.

AB  - The present objective of the work is to investigate the efficiency of freshly extracted natural mucoadhesive mate-rials Caesalpinia pulcherrima (NMM01) and Leucaena leucocephala (NMM02) were compared with synthetic and semi synthetic mucoadhesive polymers like hydro propyl cellulose (HPC) and sodium alginate respectively. The tablets were prepared by wet granulation method and followed by evaluation of granules and tablets were carried out by possible methods like, angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density, compressibility index and hausner's ratios showed that the granules good to compress, gelling and mucoadhesive strength of natural materials were studied by swelling index and ex vivo methods, NMM01 was showed more adhesion, 0.1535 neutons at 30 min-utes of time, greatest retardation of drug release was observed. In vitro drug release mechanism was found out by fitting the cumulative percentage drug release against time in hours to higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppa's first and zero order. The drug release studies reveals that best formulation was follows non-fickian diffusion, due to erosion of the matrices. There is no significant difference in drug release between the marketed sustained release product and natural mucoadhesive materials incorporated best formulation. © JK Welfare & Pharmascope Foundation.

The research design used Randomized Completely Block of Design (RCBD) with 7 treatments, 3 replications and each replication consist of 6 laying duck. The treatment of this research were RO (control), R1 (10% leucaena leaf meal without fermentation), R2 (10% leucaena leaf meal fermented by Bacillus laterosporus), R3 (20% leucaena leaf meal fermented by Bacillus laterosporus), R4 (10% leucaena leaf meal fermented by Trichoderma viride), R5 (20% leucaena leaf meal fermented by Trichoderma viride), R6 (10% leucaena leaf meal fermented by Bacillus laterosporus+10% leucaena leaf meal fermented by Trichoderma viride). Parameter which are observed like: feed consumption, egg production, egg weight and feed conversion. The results showed that the ration treatment influenced different highly significant (p<0.01) for feed consumption, egg weight and egg mass ration treatment but influenced different significantly (p<0.05) on egg production and feed conversion treatment. The use of the product leucaena leaf fermentation with Trichoderma viride and Bacillus laterosporus as much as 20% in Pitalah ducks rations and R2 treatment increase feed consumption (897.47g/bird/week), egg production (59.66%), egg weight 56.23 g/grain, egg mass (234.86g/head/week) and feed conversion (3.58 for R6 treatment). Treatment ration (R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6) is better than control ration and can improve performance of Pitalah ducks. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2013.

AB  - Antillean dry forests have experienced high levels of human impact for almost five centuries. Economic changes in the second half of the 20th century have facilitated forest recovery in Puerto Rico. We quantified the extent of forest cover and the community composition of representative forest fragments in the subtropical dry forest life zone (sensu Holdridge, 1967) in southwestern Puerto Rico. Forest cover, which was largely eliminated by the 1940s, stood at 48% in the western dry forest life zone in 1993. Fragments varied in land-use history and supported from 1% to 86% of the reference species sampled in Guánica Forest, a 4000-ha protected area. Reference species were well represented in forest fragments, even those smaller than 1. ha, if they had never been completely cleared, but were uncommon in forests regenerating on previously cleared sites. The studied fragments are novel ecosystems which combine native and introduced elements; Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit, an introduced legume, was the most common species, regardless of land-use history. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cyclic-β-glucans (CβG) consist of cyclic homo-polymers of glucose that are present in the periplasmic space of many Gram-negative bacteria. A number of studies have demonstrated their importance for bacterial infection of plant and animal cells. In this study, a mutant of Rhizobium (Sinorhizobium) sp. strain NGR234 (NGR234) was generated in the cyclic glucan synthase (ndvB)-encoding gene. The great majority of CβG produced by wild-type NGR234 are negatively charged and substituted. The ndvB mutation abolished CβG biosynthesis. We found that, in NGR234, a functional ndvB gene is essential for hypo-osmotic adaptation and swimming, attachment to the roots, and efficient infection of Vigna unguiculata and Leucaena leucocephala. © 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

TI  - Symbiotic efficiency and phylogeny of the rhizobia isolated from Leucaena leucocephala in arid-hot river valley area in Panxi, Sichuan, China

AB  - In search of effective nitrogen-fixing strains for inoculating Leucaena leucocephala, we assessed the symbiotic efficiency of 41 rhizobial isolates from root nodules of L. leucocephala growing in the arid-hot river valley area in Panxi, China. The genetic diversity of the isolates was studied by analyzing the housekeeping genes 16S rRNA and recA, and the symbiotic genes nifH and nodC. In the nodulation and symbiotic efficiency assay, only 11 of the 41 isolates promoted the growth of L. leucocephala while the majority of the isolates were ineffective in symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Furthermore, one fourth of the isolates had a growth slowing effect on the host. According to the 16S rRNA and recA gene analyses, most of the isolates were Ensifer spp. The remaining isolates were assigned to Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium. The sequence analyses indicated that the L. leucocephala rhizobia had undergone gene recombination. In contrast to the promiscuity observed as a wide species distribution of the isolates, the results implied that L. leucocephala is preferentially nodulated by strains that share common symbiosis genes. The symbiotic efficiency was not connected to chromosomal background of the symbionts and isolates carrying a similar nifH or nodC showed totally different nitrogen fixation efficiency. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Comparison of the formation of nicotinic acid conjugates in leaves of different plant species
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866068592&doi=10.1016%2fj.plaphy.2012.08.007&partnerID=40&md5=288aa34a0c44e5406a173b690b7a24d9
AB  - There are three metabolic fates of nicotinic acid in plants: (1) nicotinic acid mononucleotide formation for NAD synthesis by the so-called salvage pathway of pyridine nucleotide biosynthesis; (2) nicotinic acid N-glucoside formation; and (3) trigonelline (N-methylnicotinic acid) formation. In the present study, the metabolism of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide was investigated in leaves of 23 wild plant species. All species readily converted nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, and only a fraction of nicotinic acid was utilised for NAD and NADP synthesis. The remaining nicotinic acid is converted to the nicotinic acid conjugates. Only one plant species, Cycas revoluta, produced both nicotinic acid N-glucoside and trigonelline; the other 22 species produced one or other of the conjugates. The nicotinic acid N-glucoside-forming plants are Cyathea lepifera, Arenga trewmula var. englri, Barringtonia racemosa, Ilex paraguariensis, Angelica japonica, Scaevola taccada and Farfugium japonicum. In contrast, trigonelline is formed in C. lepifera, Ginkgo biloba, Pinus luchuensis, Casuarina equisetifolia, Alocasia odora, Pandanus odoratissimus, Hylocereus undatus, Kalanchoe pinnata, Kalanchoe tubiflora, Populus alba, Garcinia subelliptica, Oxalis corymbosa, Leucaena leucocephala, Vigna marina, Hibiscus tiliaceus and Melicope triphylla.The diversity of nicotinic acid conjugate formation in plants is discussed using these results and our previous investigation involving a few model plants, various crops and ferns. Nicotinic acid N-glucoside formation was restricted mostly to ferns and selected orders of angiosperms, whereas other plants produce trigonelline. In most cases the formation of both nicotinic acid conjugates is incompatible, but some exceptions have been found. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Using the main components analysis (ACP) were evaluated the variability and the relationship of variables related with the behavior of mulberry (Morus alba), in different association modalities with leucena (Leucaena leucocephala) and grasses during three years of exploitation in Trujillo state, Venezuela. 27 associated variables to the morpho structural behavior, the biomass availability and the chemical composition were evaluated. In the ACP corresponding to the morpho structure and the availability variables three components were formed, with 80.435% of the total variability extracted. The BT, BC and leaves availability, the number of branches, the survival and the symptoms of illnesses; all positively related to each other, explained the variance better. In the ACP associated with the chemical composition, five components were formed and 86.763% of the experimental variance was extracted. The contents of crude protein, true protein, bound protein to the fibrous fraction and the fibrous fraction (FDN), all related positively to each other, excepting the FDN, explained the numeric fluctuations better. To evaluate the behavior of the mulberry as grazing plant in a silvopastoral context could be measured the number of branches, the availability of biomass, the survival and the appearance of illnesses. From the chemical point of view should only be considered some variables associated with the protein profile or the FDN. However, the majority secondary metabolites did not exhibit relevance, excepting to the saponins content, to characterize the species under silvopastoral conditions.

AB  - A large area of Indian soils is of marginal quality with high pH and alkalinity especially in semiarid conditions. Such soils contain excessive sodium salts and possess impermeable hard pan of calcium carbonate below the soil which affects the survival of crops. Currently, these soils are reclaimed by using chemical amendments and mechanical means which exert higher costs, and this practice is repeated every year prior to sowing of crop. In India, per capita land is decreasing every year due to steep rise in population which requires more food to ful fi l their requirements. The land is limiting factor. The only way to increase land is through reclamation of abandoned saline and sodic lands and their use for crop production. Permanent reclamation of alkaline soils (high pH) is possible by the adoption of agroforestry system in which trees and crops are grown together which sustain agricultural production and productivity. Keeping in view the seriousness of the problem, an experiment was conducted to improve soil characteristics through agroforestry system for Central Plain Zone of Uttar Pradesh, India. The project was undertaken during the year 1989–2002, at Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. The key objective of the experiment was the selection of suitable multipurpose trees which can improve soil quality of high pH (alkaline soils) for crop The experiment consists of ten multipurpose tree species, namely, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia sissoo, Albizia procera, Terminalia arjuna, Eucalyptus hybrid, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia nilotica, Acacia catechu, Morus alba and Cassia siamea, and in between two rows of trees, agricultural crops were planted. The initial average soil pH, organic carbon and electric conductivity were 10.5, 0.41% and 0.73 dS m -1, respectively. After 12 years experimentation, it was concluded that the planting of multipurpose trees improved the soil organic carbon up to 0.59% and reduced the soil pH up to 8.10 and EC 0.31 dS m -1. The agricultural crops, namely, rice in Kharif (rainy season) and wheat in Rabi (winter season), were found suitable with trees. Among the trees, Eucalyptus hybrid reduces the soil pH and EC drastically as compared to other trees, whereas higher carbon was estimated with Leucaena leucocephala followed by Dalbergia sissoo, Acacia nilotica and Morus alba. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - Recombinant cinnamoyl CoA reductase 1 (Ll-CCRH1) protein from Leucaena leucocephala was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain and purified to apparent homogeneity. Optimum pH for forward and reverse reaction was found to be 6.5 and 7.8 respectively. The enzyme was most stable around pH 6.5 at 25°C for 90min. The enzyme showed Kcat/Km for feruloyl, caffeoyl, sinapoyl, coumaroyl CoA, coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde as 4.6, 2.4, 2.3, 1.7, 1.9 and 1.2 (×106M-1s-1), respectively, indicating affinity of enzyme for feruloyl CoA over other substrates and preference of reduction reaction over oxidation. Activation energy, Ea for various substrates was found to be in the range of 20-50kJ/mol. Involvement of probable carboxylate ion, histidine, lysine or tyrosine at the active site of enzyme was predicted by pH activity profile. SAXS studies of protein showed radius 3.04nm and volume 49.25nm3 with oblate ellipsoid shape. Finally, metal ion inhibition studies revealed that Ll-CCRH1 is a metal independent enzyme. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The kinetics of adsorption of Congo red (acidic dye) on Leucaena leucocephala seed pods has been investigated. It has been observed from experiments that adsorbent prepared from seed pods of Leucaena leucocephala plant was effective, for the removal of Congo red from aqueous solutions at room temperature. Adsorption of Congo red was dependent on pH, initial concentration, adsorbent dose and contact time. The result indicated that, the adsorption of Congo red was 91% at the optimum pH of 5. The optimum contact time was 120 minutes and the adsorbent dose was 2 g/l of Leucaena leucocephala seed pods. The Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm equations were applied for the equilibrium adsorption data and the various isotherm parameters were evaluated. The Congo red adsorption on the Leucaena leucocephala seed pods follows pseudo second-order rate kinetics.

AB  - Environmental contamination due to anthropogenic and natural sources is increasing day by day because of increase in population, industrialization and urbanization. Arsenic species released into the environment tend to persist indefinitely, circulating and eventually accumulating throughout the food chain, thus becoming a serious threat to the environment. The present study explores the effectiveness of Leucaena leucocephala seed powder (agricultural waste) in removing arsenic ions from aqueous solution. Batch studies were carried out to characterize As (III) and As (V) removal capability of L. leucocephala seed powder. Maximum biosorption capacity for As (III) and As (V) was found to be 81. 88 and 92. 61 %, respectively. Amino acid-arsenic interaction has been highlighted on the basis of shifting of FTIR bands of native LLSP. Morphological changes and reduction in pore area have been observed in modified LLSP. Modification on the native LLSP results into the increase in percentage sorption of As (III) and As (V) up to 85 and 99 %, respectively. Enhancement in the percentage sorption is due the increase in the stability of the biosorbent due to increase in the final decomposition temperature of the modified LLSP. The findings showed that L. leucocephala seed powder can easily be envisaged as a new, vibrant, low-cost biosorbent for arsenic clean-up operations. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Principles to determine dielectric constant and loss tangent measurement using Agilent 85070E Dielectric Probe Kit 200 MHz to 50 GHztechnique is presented in this paper. The experiment objective was to measure the dielectric constant and loss tangent of Leucaena Leucocephala (Local Malaysian name Petai Belalang) material that laminated by Polypropylene Polymer. The Fabricated proposed boards were studied in the frequency range of 2.2 to 3.3 GHz since later this board will be used in ISM band application that occupied 2.45 GHz frequency spectrum. The parameter composition of proposed board on this paper was focused only one density composition that is 70% of polypropylene and 30% of leucaena leucocephala filler wood. The overall moisture content of the filler was maintained less than 5%. The proposed board were only be analyzed in term of filler particle size of 100μM, 150μM, 200μM and 500μM. All proposed board with different particle size were analyzed and compared with fabrication of 100% of polypropylene board, Teflon and commercial FR4 material board to find the best potential and all the board were thoroughly been analyzed in a room temperature of 26 degree Celsiusand humidity about 30% to 50% at relativehumidityand all result obtained were form as data and graph analysis. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a small tree originated in Mexico and escaped as a weed in tropical and warm temperate region of other countries. In India, it is mostly cultivated for its fodder and other important uses like hedge plant, green manure, food for animal, timber and as a bio energy crop. The plant is also used in phytoremediation. The plant has high nutritive contents like protein, carbohydrates and fat as that of alfalfa. As a timber, it is used as a raw material for making agricultural implements and the seed oil could be used as a biofuel by blending with the conventional diesel. In the present study, the nutritive value and potential uses of this plant were collected and discussed.

TI  - Methane production from jack fruit, muntingia, leucaena, gliricidia (gliricidia sepium), mimosa (mimosa pigra) and acacia auriculoformis foliages in an in vitro incubation with potassium nitrate as source of NPN

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of potassium nitrate on methane production from the leaves of a range of fodder trees (Jack fruit [Artocarpus heterophyllus], Muntingia calabura, Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Mimosa pigra and Acacia auriculoformis) an in vitro incubation system. The incubation was for 24 h with measurements of total gas and per cent methane at intervals of 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours and determination of residual unfermented substrate at the end of each interval. Gas production increased with length of incubation (Table 4) and was lower when nitrate was added to the substrate. Percent methane in the gas and methane production increased with length of incubation and were always lower when nitrate was added to the substrate. The percentage DM solubilized and methane produced per unit DM solubilized increased with incubation time, varied among the foliages and were lower when nitrate was present in the substrate. In the absence of nitrate, methane production from Mimosa was only some 50% of that from Gliricidia and Jackfruit. Both percentage DM solubilized at 24h and methane production per unit DM solubilized were linearly and positively related with the solubility of the crude protein (N*6.25) in the foliages.

TI  - Biologically inspired tunable hydrophilic/hydrophobic surfaces: A copper oxide self-assembly multitier approach
PY  - 2012

AB  - In this study, a fabrication method for biologically inspired superhydrophobic micro- and nano-structured tier surfaces, each made of a self-assembled copper oxide, is presented. The method is controllable and applicable to bulk production when compared to existing high-end fabrication techniques. By modulating wet chemistry, different shapes and scales of tier structures were created. We demonstrated that their wetting behaviors are closely related to morphological information such as pitch, height and shape. To characterize their wetting behaviors, several experiments were designed and executed. In static water contact angle (WCA) measurements, morphological modulation led to wide WCA range (17°-95°). After hydrophobic self-assembly monolayer of 1-dodecanethiol, their WCA was escalated into superhydrophobic regime. In dynamic WCA, the contact angle hysteresis is greatly reduced by hybridizing the micro- and nano-tier (multiple tiers) when compared to utilizing a single tier. Also, the modification of the surface structure influences the rate of evaporation. In an analytical approach, the multiple tiers show a lower surface free energy compared to that of the single tier. By hybridizing different scales and shapes of tiers-such as hemispheric and conic shapes-the multiple tiers can efficiently reduce the surface energy barrier. Eventually, these manipulations lead to a subtle WCA hysteresis during the liquid motion testing. The analytical results are consistent with the dynamic WCA measurements. The multiple tiers also stabilize the Cassie regime and result in an increased hydrophobicity, which is more than when a single tier is employed. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Lack of three dimensional crystal structure of cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR) limits its detailed active site characterization studies. Putative active site residues involved in the substrate/NADPH binding and catalysis for Leucaena leucocephala CCR (Ll-CCRH1; GenBank: DQ986907) were identified by amino acid sequence alignment and homology modeling. Putative active site residues and proximal H215 were subjected for site directed mutagenesis, and mutated enzymes were expressed, purified and assayed to confirm their functional roles. Mutagenesis of S136, Y170 and K174 showed complete loss of activity, indicating their pivotal roles in catalysis. Mutant S212G exhibited the catalytic efficiencies less than 10% of wild type, showing its indirect involvement in substrate binding or catalysis. R51G, D77G, F30V and I31N double mutants showed significant changes in Km values, specifying their roles in substrate binding. Finally, chemical modification and substrate protection studies corroborated the presence Ser, Tyr, Lys, Arg and carboxylate group at the active site of Ll-CCRH1. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Five tropical multi-purpose tree species (MPTS), Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Moringa oleifera, Millettia griffoniana, Pterocarpus santalinoides and Treculia Africana, and one exotic species (Leucaena leucocephala), which acted as the control, planted in a randomized complete block design, were selected to evaluate the potentials as feed supplements for herds in dry seasons of south-western Nigeria. Samples of the MPTS leaves were collected in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, weighed, dried and milled for estimation of biomass production, chemical analysis and measurement of in vitro gas production. Results showed significant differences (P < 0·001) in the biomass production of the MPTS. E. cyclocarpum consistently recorded the highest biomass production, height and collar diameter throughout the experimental period. There were also differences (P 0·001) in dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE) and ash contents of the MPTS across species and years after planting. M. oleifera recorded the highest CP content of 240 g/kg DM. Interactions were observed between species and year for neutral detergent fibre (NDFom), acid detergent fibre (ADFom) and lignin contents of the MPTS. M. griffoniana and M. oleifera had lower tannin contents, whereas E. cyclocarpum, P. santalinoides, T. africana and L. leucocephala had higher tannin contents. The values reported for mineral contents showed that their levels in the MPTS were adequate for ruminants and there were no differences in the contents of most minerals. In vitro gas production results showed that the potential gas production 'b' was highest in M. griffoniana and lowest in P. santalinoides and there were species and year interactions (P 0·001) for volatile fatty acid profiles of the supernatant after 96 h incubation. The estimated organic matter digestibility (OMD) and metabolizable energy (ME) of the MPTS were generally high. The high biomass production, CP and low fibre contents, as well as in vitro fermentation characteristics found for the MPTS evaluated in the current study suggest that these are better alternatives in comparison with L. leucocephala. It can be concluded that the MPTS evaluated have potential as sources of feed supplements for ruminants in dry seasons, especially in south western Nigeria. © Cambridge University Press 2012.

AB  - Cupriavidus taiwanensis forms proficient symbioses with a few Mimosa species. Inactivation of a type III protein secretion system (T3SS) had no effect on Mimosa pudica but allowed C. taiwanensis to establish chronic infections and fix nitrogen in Leucaena leucocephala. Unlike what was observed for other rhizobia, glutamate rather than plant flavonoids mediated transcriptional activation of this atypical T3SS. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (LEU) and three under-utilized tanniferous legumes, Styzolobium aterrimum L. (STA), Styzolobium deeringianum (STD), and Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth (MIC) were chemically characterized and the biological activity of tannins was evaluated using in vitro simulated ruminal fermentation through tannin-binding polyethylene glycol (PEG) and compared with a non-tanniferous tropical grass hay, Cynodon spp. (CYN). The Hohenheim gas test was used and gas production (GP) was recorded at 4, 8, 12, 24, 32, 48, 56, 72, 80, and 96 h incubation with and without PEG. Kinetic parameters were estimated by an exponential model. STA, STD, and LEU contained higher (P < 0.05) crude protein than MIC, which had greater neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre. Total phenols, total tannins, and condensed tannins (CT) were consistently the highest in MIC. Gas production was the lowest from MIC (P < 0.05) and the highest in LEU and STA. MIC + PEG largely reduced (P < 0.05) the lag phase and the fractional rate of fermentation and increased potential GP. Kinetic parameters of STA + PEG and LEU + PEG were not affected. LEU + PEG produced greater gas increment (P < 0.05) than STD + PEG, although both legumes had the same CT. All legumes except MIC were more extensively degraded than CYN. However, fermentation of the legumes was differently affected by the presence and proportions of CT, indigestible fibre or both.

AB  - This work has followed the protocols of the IPCC and used secondary information to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) alone and associated with timber trees. Additionally, emissions were calculated for two baseline scenarios: degraded pastures and improved pastures in order to estimate the contribution of different GHG's emissions in livestock systems and determine if the ISS could be an alternative for GHG sequestration and hence be considered as a technology that can mitigate climate change. Degraded and improved pasture generated net GHG emissions of 3153 and 3259 kg CO 2 eq /ha/year respectively; while ISS removed GHG from the atmosphere, with positive balances of 8800 and 26,565 kg CO 2 eq/ha/year alone or associated with timber trees, respectively. It is concluded that the ISS is a technology that can contribute to mitigate climate change due to its production capacity (both plant biomass and animal productivity) that enables this system to have a positive GHG balance.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine if adaptation of lambs to ingestion of tree leaf extracts of Salix babylonica and Leucaena leucocephala can modify in vitro gas production of Celtis ehrenbergiana, Ficus trigonata, Fraxinus excelsior and Prunus domestica. Samples of leaves were collected in triplicate (i.e., three individual samples of each tree leaf). Rumen inoculum was collected from 8 growing lambs fed a total mixed ration ad libitum (control; RC). Incubations were repeated with the rumen fluid collected from another 8 growing lambs of the same breed fed the same ration, but fed a daily dose of 30ml/d of S. babylonica and L. leucocephala extracts in a 1:1 (v:v) mixture (treatment; RX). Leaf samples were incubated with each rumen fluid (i.e., RC and RX inoculums) in 3 runs on different weeks. Data of each of the three runs within sample replicate were averaged and used as the mean value of each individual sample within tree species for statistical analysis in a 4 (tree species)×2 (rumen inoculum) factorial design. In vitro gas production was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 and 72h of incubation. After 72h, the incubation was stopped and supernatant pH was determined, and then filtered to determine apparent degraded substrate (ADS). Fermentation parameters, such as the 72h partitioning factor (PF 72), 24h gas yield (GY 24), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), metabolizable energy (ME), short chain fatty acids concentration (SCFA), and microbial protein production (MP) were estimated. The crude protein content of the leaves ranged from 147 (F. trigonata) to 241 (C. ehrenbergiana) g/kg dry matter. The lowest fiber fraction values was in P. domestica, while F. excelsior had the highest, and C. ehrenbergiana and F. trigonata were intermediate. Secondary metabolites (i.e., total phenolics, saponins, aqueous fraction) were lowest in P. domestica and highest in F. trigonata. Accumulated gas production was highest (P<0.05) in F. excelsior during the first 24h of incubation. All fermentation parameters (i.e., ADS, SCFA, GY 24, PF 72, IVOMD, ME, MP) varied (P<0.01) among tree leaves. The ADS, SCFA and MP were highest (P<0.01) in F. excelsior, lowest (P<0.01) in F. trigonata, and intermediate in P. domestica and C. ehrenbergiana. Incubation of tree leaves with RX inoculum did not affect gas production in the first 6h, but it was lower (P<0.05) at 24-72h, except for F. trigonata. C. ehrenbergiana had the highest (P<0.05) potential gas production, but rate of gas production and the discrete lag time did not differ among leaves. As incubation of tree leaves with RX inoculum lowered (P<0.05) all fermentation parameters, oral administrated extracts of S. babylonica and L. leucocephala did not seem to adapt the rumen microbial population to better utilize these tree leaves. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The potential of 6 tree species (Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia mangium, Peltophorum pterocarpum, Pterocarpus macrocarpus, Lagerstroemia floribunda, Eucalyptus camaldulensis) for phytoremediation of Pb in sand tailings (total Pb >9850 mg kg -1) from KEMCO Pb mine in Kanchanaburi province, Thailand, were investigated employing a pot experiment (3 months) and field trial experiment (12 months). In pot study E. camaldulensis treated with Osmocote fertilizer attained the highest total biomass (15.3 g plant -1) followed by P. pterocarpum (12.6 g plant -1) and A. mangium (10.8 g plant -1) both treated with cow manure. Cow manure application resulted in the highest root Pb accumulation (>10000 mg kg -1) in L. floribunda and P. macrocarpus. These two species also exhibited the highest Pb uptake (85-88 mg plant -1). Results from field trial also showed that Osmocote promoted the best growth performance in E. camaldulensis (biomass 385.7 g plant -1, height 141.7 cm) followed by A. mangium (biomass 215.9 g plant -1, height 102.7 cm), and they also exhibited the highest Pb uptake (600-800 μg plant -1). A. mangium with the addition of organic fertilizer was the best option for phytostabilization of Pb-contaminated mine tailing because it retained higher Pb concentration in the roots. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study evaluated the establishment of the symbiosis between Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) under contaminated systems with naphtalene (NAF) and phenanthrene (FEN), as well as the physiological plants responses such as total content of phenolic compounds (CFT), total antioxidant activity (AAT) and the content of chlorophylls (CloroT) and carotenoids (CaT). After 31 days, NAF had more significant negative effects on nodulation by delaying the formation of nodules until the day 25 at 100 mg/L. In the presence of 20 mg FEN/L, L. leucocephala plants did not show significant differences on the number of nodules when compared to the control, while nodulation decreased 52 % at 60 and 100 mg FEN/L. Inoculation with R. tropici resulted in significant increases of PST (>150 %) in comparison to non-inoculated plants. The foliar content of CFT was significantly greater at non-inoculated treatments in respect to those with R. tropici, and significantly higher in plants exposed to FEN than NAF. For both hydrocarbons, the concentration of 100 mg/L resulted in greater CFT and AAT when compared to 20 or 60 mg/L. For roots, treatments without contamination and R. tropici had more content of CFT and AAT. The AAT in nodules significantly increased due to NAF, while a significant reduction was observed in FEN treatments. Either NAF or FEN did not significantly affect the content of CloroT, although this content was significantly greater in plants with R. tropici than non-inoculated plants. The CaT content significantly increased at non-inoculated plants exposed to NAF and/or FEN.

AB  - A field study was conducted to investigate the effect of water deficit on the morphology, productivity, and quality of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit. Five main irrigation levels were applied based on actual evapotranspiration (AET): 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 00, and 1. 25 of the AET. Plant height, number of leaves and branches, and root length and diameter were measured. Fresh and dry weights were recorded at harvest, and crude protein was analyzed in leaves and roots. The results showed that morphological and yield characteristics were affected by the amount of water applied. The number of leaves remaining at the end of 21 weeks of growth was 65, 84, 93, 87 and 102 at 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 00, and 1. 25 AET. Root length and diameter increased with increasing irrigation. The greatest root length (66. 5 cm) at 1. 00 AET did not differ significantly from that at 1. 25 AET (58. 8 cm). The dry yield at 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 00 AET showed an increased trend per plant in each treatment. Similarly, leaf crude protein showed a trend of increase with increasing irrigation although values were not significantly different between the levels of irrigation. The moisture content ranged from 60 to 63 % in leaves and 32-35 % in branches across the five treatments. The analysis of water use efficiency showed that the 0. 50 AET plants produced 2. 6 kg ha -1mm -1 of dry forage compared to 1. 8 kg ha -1mm -1 at 0. 75 AET. The results showed that 0. 50 or 0. 75 AET represents the best irrigation level for L. leucocephala cultivation, producing a total dry yield of 0. 68 and 0. 72 t ha -1, respectively, in our study. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Klason lignin estimation in Leucaena leucocephala by near infrared spectroscopy for selection of superior material for pulp and paper

AB  - Near infrared spectroscopy partial least squares (PLS) regression calibrations were developed for estimation of Klason lignin content in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (commonly called Subabul in India) belonging to the family Fabaceae and sub-family Mimosoideae with solid radial-longitudinal strip and milled samples for trees having diameter ranging from 3.5 to 34.1 cm and age between 4 and 20 years. Samples were conditioned to 10-12 % moisture content. Two separate models were developed for milled samples having particle sizes of 250-400 μm (screened-1) and 420-1,000 μm (screened-2). Regression model using PLS regression with full cross validation were test validated on a separate set of samples. The three multisite calibrations gave RPD (ratio of performance to deviation) between 2.24 and 2.97 with lowest for solid radial strip samples (2.24) and highest for screened-1 powder (2.97). Screened-1 milled sample gave highest r p 2 of prediction (0.92) with four factors compared to four that were used for solid strips and eight for screened-2 samples. Model with solid strips gave lowest r p 2 of prediction (0.86). Results indicate that properly mixed milled samples having particle size 250-400 μm (screened-1) help in construction of PLS models with higher RPD and less number of factors compared to screened-2 samples (2.48) and solid strips (2.24). Particle size played an important role in construction of the model. Lower RPD with solid strips could be due to variation of chemical constituents from pith to bark. The standard error of calibration (SEC), standard error of cross validation (SECV) and standard error of prediction (SEP) were less than 1 % for Screened-1 samples. For screened-2 samples SEC and SECV were less than 1 % while SEP was 1 %. In case of radial solid strip SEP was slightly above 1 % (1.16) while SEC and SECV were less than 1 %. For constructing models of high accuracy with radial solid strips separate models may be constructed for juvenile and mature wood. © 2012 Indian Academy of Wood Science.

AB  - Xiaojiang drainage basin is one of the regions suffering from serious erosion and ecological degeneration due to the climate, geological and geomorphological conditions and the heavy human activities. Reforestation, which has been done since 1980s in the region, is an effective measure for the ecological restoration. Four types of plantations, i.e., Eucalyptus spp., Acacia mearnsii, Leucaena leucocephala and Pinus yunnanensis are investigated in the sample plots. Development processes and community structures of the tree layers, shrub layers and grass layers are studied with the "ergodic hypothesis" method and the index of species richness, coverage, importance value and Shannon-Wiener index et al, and erosion control abilities of the four types of plantations are compared in this paper. The result shows that the plantations of Acacia mearnsii and Leucaena leucocephala grow faster, which have higher crown coverages and stronger erosion control abilities than that of Pinus yunnanensis and Eucalyptus spp. The Pinus yunnanensis plantation has a higher secondary understory biodiversity, the Eucalyptus spp. plantation has a high secondary understory biodiversity, but the plantations of Acacia mearnsii and Leucaena leucocephala have low secondary understory biodiversities. Study in this paper shows that the four types of plantation have distinct effects in promoting plant diversity and have different erosion control abilities. So plantation species selection and association mode should be considered in the process of reforestation for ecological restoration. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - The Okhla Bird Sanctuary (OBS), a man-modified floodplain wetland having high human impact, is located in an urbanized landscape. Its location in the Central Asian Flyway of migratory birds makes it an ideal transit and wintering ground for birds. This paper describes the vegetation composition and significance of the Sanctuary as a bird habitat. A floristic survey was carried out from winter 2009 to spring 2010 while preparing a management plan for OBS. 192 species of plants belonging to 46 families were recorded from the area. Thirteen species of weeds were observed covering 70% of the sampled area in peak summer. Among trees, highest density was found for two exotic species viz., Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis juliflora. The aquatic system is facing threat from proliferation of Eichhornia cressipes and Typha angustifolia. Strategic eradication of invasive and plantation of native species in the sanctuary are needed for better management. © 2013 Check List and Authors.

TI  - Long-term integrated soil fertility management in south-western nigeria: Crop performance and impact on the soil fertility status
PY  - 2012

AB  - Crop response, tree biomass production and changes in soil fertility characteristics were monitored in a long-term (1986-2006) alley-cropping trial in Ibadan, Nigeria the systems included two alley cropping systems with Leucaena leucocephala and Senna siamea on the one hand and a control (no-trees) system on the other hand, all cropped annually with a maize-cowpea rotation. All systems had a plus and minus fertilizer treatment. Over the years, the annual biomass return through tree prunings declined steadily, but more drastically for Leucaena than for Senna. In 2002, the nitrogen contribution from Leucaena residues stabilized at about 200 kg N/ha/year, while the corresponding value for Senna was about 160 kg N/ha/year. On average, the four Leucaena prunings were more equal in biomass as well as in amounts of N, P and cations, while the first Senna pruning was always contributing up to 60% of the annual biomass or nutrient return. Maize crop yields declined steadily in all treatments, but the least so in the Senna + fertilizer treatment where in 2002 still 2.2 t/ha of maize were obtained. Nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency was usually higher in the Senna treatment compared to the control or the Leucaena treatment. Added benefits due to the combined use of fertilizer N and organic matter additions were observed only for the Senna treatment and only in the last 6 years. At all other times, they remained absent or were even negative in the Leucaena treatments for the first 3 years. Most chemical soil fertility parameters decreased in all the treatments, but less so in the alley cropping systems the presence of trees had a positive effect on remaining carbon stocks, while they were reduced compared to the 1986 data. Trees had a positive effect on the maintenance of exchangeable cations in the top soil. Exchangeable Ca, Mg and K-And hence ECEC-were only slightly reduced after 16 years of cropping in the tree-based systems, and even increased in the Senna treatments. In the control treatments, values for all these parameters reduced to 50% or less of the original values after 20 years. All the above points to the Senna-based alley system with fertilizers as the more resilient one. This is reflected in all soil fertility parameters, in added benefits due to the combined use of fertilizer nitrogen and organic residue application and in a more stable maize yield over the years, averaging 2.8 t/ha with maximal deviations from the average not exceeding 21%. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The Berenty Reserve is part of a 400-ha forest fragment bordered by the Mandrare River, sisal plantations and pasture lands. It was founded in 1936 by the de Heaulme family in negotiation with local Tandroy clans, and the forest has been preserved through political changes for over 75 years. Exotic trees have been planted on the western side, and the forest is in filtrated by trails which facilitate assault by invasive plants, particularly sisal and Cissus quadrangularis . Pressure is aggravated by high lemur density, especially introduced hybrid brown lemurs Eulemur ru fifrons × E. collaris , which are displacing native Lemur catta. Alopecia of Lemur catta is directly linked to ingestion of the exotic plant Leucaena leucocephala . Successive forest managers have attempted to resolve these problems. Predicted scenarios of global warming and a lower water table will exacerbate both biological and social stress. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

AB  - Studies were conducted to assess the social and economic feasibility of using selected browses in goat feeding in central Tanzania. In the first study, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in four villages of Kongwa and Mpwapwa districts. A total of 141 households (farms) were individually visited in order to determine the factors influencing the use of native and exotic tree species for goat feeding. Results indicated that common indigenous browses including Acacia tortilis, Ecborium spp, Grewia spp, Ficus spp, Tamarindusindica and Leucaena leucocephala were fed to goats and their importance was ranked diferently among farmers (P < 0.01) between districts. Palatability was an important factor as indicated by 29% of the respondents (n= 123). Other factors were associated with improved animal conditions / health (28%) and milk yields of dairy goats (18%). In a separate on-station study, an economic analysis of feeding browse leaf meals showed that the use of browse-based supplements were relatively cheaper than the use of cotton seed cake (CSC). The highest profit margin was obtained with T. indica due to higher live-weight gain, followed by Lablab. Nevertheless, work is needed to train farmers to establish exogenous species and to sustainably manage the abundant multipurpose indigenous trees and shrubs.

AB  - The aim of this experiment was to study the effect of adding S. cerevisiae and leaf of L. leucocephala in diet rice straw-based of nutrients digestibility and body weight gain of cattle. The experiment was conducted in Ruminant Nutrition Laboratory of the Faculty of Animal Science, Andalas University, Padang. Experimental design used is a Latin Square Design (LSD) with four treatments and four periods. This experiment used 175.±10.53 kg male ongole crossbreed. The treatments were (A) grass+concentrates (B) rice straw+concentrates (C) was the treatment of B plus 0.5% S. cerevisiae and (D) was the treatment C+15% L. leucocephala. The results showed that the dry matter digestibility of treatment B (61.03%) were significantly lower than treatments A, C and D respectively (68.05, 63.01 and 68.15%) and supplementation of S. cerevisiae was able to improve nutrient digestibility and body weight gain of cattle but still low as compared to control (A). Addition of L. leucocephala in treatment D (850.7 g/day) was able to provide digestibility and body weight gain similar to the control ration (775.7 g/day). It can be concluded that the use of rice straw as a substitute for grass would give the same results with the grass when added 0.5% S. cerevisiae and 15% L. leucocephala. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2013.

AB  - The aim of this study was to improve the quality of bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala trunks via catalytic deoxygenation using Pt/Al2O3 (Pt content=1.32% (w/w)). The minimum molar ratio of oxygen/carbon (O/C) at 0.14 was achieved when the amount of catalyst was 10% (w/w, bio-oil) and was applied under 4bar of initial nitrogen pressure at 340°C for 1h. The reaction mechanism of the catalytic deoxygenation, in terms of reforming, water-gas shift and dehydration reactions, was proposed. To consider the effect of different biomass types on the efficiency of catalytic deoxygenation, the bio-oils obtained from the pyrolysis of sawdust, rice straw and green microalgae were likewise evaluated for direct comparison. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Agroforestry systems have the potential to contribute significantly to climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, data on tree and soil organic carbon (SOC) pools for most agroforestry systems are lacking because reliable methods for estimating ecosystem carbon (C) pools are scarce. This study quantified the effects of five Leucaena species (L. leucocephala, L. macrophylla, L. diversifolia, L. collinsii and L. pulverulenta) on vegetal and soil C stocks and on mean annual increment (MAI) in aboveground tree C stocks. Specifically, it tested the validity of the CO2FIX model using empirical data from 7 year-old woodlots at Msekera, Zambia, and assessed the impact of converting a degraded agricultural ecosystem to woodlots on C stocks. Measured above- and below-ground tree C stocks and MAI of aboveground biomass differed significantly among the Leucaena species. Measured stem and total aboveground tree C stocks in seven-year old woodlots ranged from 17.1 to 29.2 and from 24.5 to 55.9 Mg ha -1, respectively. Measured SOC stocks at 0-200 cm depth in Leucaena stands ranged from 106.9 (L. diversifolia) to 186.0 Mg ha -1 (L. leucocephala). Modeled stem and branch C stocks closely matched measured stocks, but the soil module of CO2FIX did not predict the soil C. The soil C data are inconclusive at this stage. We recommend that a fractionation and a soil aggregate hierarchy study backed by C dating is carried out to explain soil C dynamics in these soils. However, the model can be used only for estimating changes in aboveground tree C stocks in woodlots until soil C module is proven to predict SOC stocks. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Methane production and energy loss of 12 green forages were investigated in vitro in a completely randomized design using inoculum from buffaloes. The forages, which included Hordeum vulgare, Avena sativa, Trifolium alaxendrinum, Medicago sativa cv. Anand-2, Medicago sativa cv. T-9, Pennisetum purpureum, Panicum maximum, Saccharum officinarum (SOT), Arachis hypogea (AHL), Grewia optiva leaves (GOL), Leucaena leucocephala leaves and Sorghum bicolor were also partitioned into crude protein (CP) and carbohydrate (CHO) fractions using the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. In vitro gas production and dry matter (DM) digestibility were estimated using rumen fluid from 2 fistulated buffaloes. Correlation analysis was used to establish relationships between measured variables and CH4 production. Crude protein contents of the forages were lowest (P<0.001) in the grasses/cereals and highest (P<0.001) in the legumes. Accumulation of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber (ADF) and cellulose was higher in the grasses and cereals, whereas the reverse occurred with legumes. The proportion of degradable CP fractions ranged from 0.70 to 0.83 of total CP, with higher (P<0.001) CP fractions for legumes vs. grasses/cereals. Overall, legumes had a higher unavailable CHO fraction than the grasses or cereals. Legumes were more fully degraded in vitro than in grasses and cereals, being highest (P<0.001) in GOL and least in SOT. After 24h of incubation, CH4 production (g/kg DM) was higher (P<0.001) in legumes than grasses or cereals. Loss of energy as CH4 was higher (P<0.001) in AHL and GOL than in the other forages, although there were no differences among the groups; cereals, grasses and legumes. Only ADF and cellulose were positively correlated (P<0.05) with CH4 production (g/kg DM). Because of the substantial amount of dietary gross energy lost in CH4, knowledge of the CH4 potential of these forages will help in formulating low CH4 producing diets for ruminants. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The performance of Prosopis juliflora and Leucaena leucocephala was investigated at plant spacings of 1 × 0.5, 1 × 1, 1 × 1.5, 1 × 2 and 1 × 2.5 m corresponding to a tree density of 20,000, 10,000, 6,666, 5,000 and 4,000 ha-1, respectively, to identify the most suitable plant spacing for the optimum biomass harvest per unit area. The overall performance of L. leucocephala was superior to P. juliflora under most parameters measured, except for the calorific value. The performance of both species in terms of the plant height, stem diameter and number of trunks was affected by the population density at age 6 mths and there were significant increases at wider spacings (1 × 2 and 1 × 2.5 m) when the age advanced to 12 mth. There were significant differences in the biomass production per tree and better total above ground biomass results were obtained with plantings at wider spacings at both 6 and 12 mth of age. However, the total above ground biomass yield per hectare of both species increased markedly with increasing plant density at both 6 and 12 mth of age and this revealed that both species can be grown at closer spacing (1 × 0.5 m).

TI  - Effect of plant extracts from several tanniferous browse legumes on in vitro microbial fermentation of the tropical grass Pennisetum purpureum
PY  - 2011

AB  - To what extent microbial fermentation of tropical grasses is affected by tannins from browse legumes was studied in vitro using acetone extracts from tanniferous plants in four 48. h incubation experiments. A proportion of plant extracts equivalent to 240. mg of Acacia cornigera (AC), Albizia lebbekoides (AL) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL) were added to each bottle with 800. mg Pennisetum purpureum as substrate, and contrasted with P. purpureum alone (PP) or with 64. mg quebracho tannins (QT). Gas production was lowest with QT and AL (P<0.05), and AC and LL reduced gas volume compared to PP from 10 to 24. h (P<0.001) and from 4 to 8. h (P<0.01), respectively. Compared with PP, total VFA concentration was reduced with AL and QT after 12. h (P<0.01), and the same trend (P=0.06) occurred with AC and AL after 24. h. Acetate molar proportion at 24. h was reduced, and that of propionate increased, with AC and AL compared with PP (P<0.05), whereas AL and QT reduced butyrate proportion (P<0.05). Estimated methane concentration per unit fermented organic matter after 24. h was lower with AC and AL than with PP (P<0.01). Proportion of R. albus was reduced with LL, AC and AL compared with PP at 12. h (P<0.01) and 24. h (P<0.001) of incubation, and the relative concentration of F. succinogenes tended (P=0.08) to be reduced with QT at 12. h, whereas there was no effect on R. flavefaciens. Plant extracts from A. cornigera, A. lebekkoides and L. leucocephala affected microbial fermentation of the tropical grass P. purpureum, reducing the rate of gas production from 4 to 16. h and increasing propionate at the expense of acetate, to the largest extent with A. lebbekoides. A reduction of methanogenesis, and therefore an increase in efficiency of energy utilisation, is consequently expected. No major effect on the bacterial population attached to the substrate occurred, but concentrations of R. albus seemed to be sensitive to tannins. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Tamilnadu, one of the important States in India, a large number of tannery industries operate and release huge volume of the tannery effluent and sludge that contaminate the nearby agricultural lands as well as the underground water. Besides, there is always a pungent and foul smell in and around the industry installations. From the perusal of literature, it is evident that an in-depth study is totally lacking with regard to reclamation of the tannery polluted soil for raising fast growing tree species either for fire wood or timber. Therefore, in the present study using pot culture method, the effect of tannery sludge on the growth of fast growing tree species was investigated as a prelude to employ right type of tree species in reclamation of tannery polluted soil. The plants raised in pots containing the garden soil served as the control. The morphometric parameters of the 12 months old tree saplings showed enormous proliferation of aboveground biomass and the overall growth was not affected at all. Copyright © EM International.

TI  - Oviposition patterns and egg mortality in acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae), a biological control agent of Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) in South Africa
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860335537&doi=10.4001%2f003.020.0114&partnerID=40&md5=b8b49e093e8034dd2aaef59aad87e844
AB  - Deliberately introduced for agroforestry, the invasive tree Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) is naturalized in several countries worldwide, including parts of South Africa. The seed beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was inadvertently introduced to several countries via contaminated seed, but was released as a biological control agent in South Africa. Although widely established in South Africa, its efficacy may be curtailed because damage is reputed to be confined to canopy-held seeds, with dehisced seeds escaping damage on the ground. To clarify the beetle's potential, we investigated: (i) its selection of oviposition sites when presented with pods bearing seeds, loose seeds and empty pods in different locations (canopy-versus ground-held); and (ii) the effect of seed location on egg mortality. The beetles oviposited on pods bearing seeds, loose seeds and empty pods in both locations but showed significant preferences for pods bearing seeds, regardless of location. Egg mortality was high (66% overall) and caused largely by predation, but did not differ between canopy-and ground-held seeds. Dehisced seeds are thus more likely to escape damage due to the beetle's greater association with pods bearing seeds, which occur mostly in the canopy. While not affected by seed location, egg predation could affect beetle population densities. Although oviposition patterns and egg predation may constrain the efficacy of A. macrophthalonus, seed damage in relation to seed availability still needs to be quantified in the field.

TI  - Subtropical dry forest regeneration in grass-invaded areas of Puerto Rico: Understanding why Leucaena leucocephala dominates and native species fail
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84855269277&doi=10.1016%2fj.foreco.2011.12.015&partnerID=40&md5=4e5d3dc68709f0e83d20bd68aaf08b62
AB  - Throughout the tropics, non-native grasses invade, dominate, and persist in areas where subtropical and tropical dry forests have been highly degraded. In Central America and the Caribbean Islands, forests that regenerate in grass-invaded areas are generally composed of one to a few tree species, usually of the Fabaceae family and often non-native. We investigated the ecological factors that drive these successional patterns in southwestern Puerto Rico, where African grasses dominate extensive areas that are maintained by fires. The non-native legume tree Leucaena leucocephala commonly establishes in these areas and forms persistent, mono-dominant stands. We planted 455 saplings of 13 native tree species and Leucaena in native forest understory and in grass-invaded areas that were either subjected to or protected from prescribed fires 4. months later. We measured growth and survival to test the following hypotheses: (1) saplings of native species are suppressed in grass-invaded areas compared to the forest understory, (2) Leucaena saplings outperform native species in grass-invaded areas, but not in the forest understory, and (3) Leucaena saplings are less susceptible to wildfires than native species. After 20. months, 50%, 40%, and 3% of native saplings survived in the forest, unburned-grass, and burned-grass treatments, respectively. Over the same period, 90%, 80%, and 25% of Leucaena survived in the same treatments. The fires immediately killed 65% of native saplings and 50% of Leucaena saplings. The majority of unburned native saplings died during a seasonal drought, when high irradiance and reduced soil organic matter content likely led to higher mortality in grass-invaded areas than in forest understory. Native species' growth was low in all treatments, yet diameter growth was slightly higher in the unburned grass than the forest understory. Leucaena saplings grew faster than the native saplings in all three treatments, especially in the unburned grass. Slow growth and high mortality of native saplings in grass-invaded areas contribute to the dominance of Leucaena in forests that regenerate on these sites and suggest that Leucaena may play a beneficial role in dry forest restoration in the Caribbean. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chemical constituents in the extracts of Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit. and Salix babylonica L. foliage were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and their relative concentrations determined. L.leucocephala extract contained 44 compounds: 2(H)-benzofuranone-5,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,4,7a-trimethyl (23.1%), pentadecanoic acid-14-methyl-methyl ester (8.2%), and 6,10,14- trimethyl-2-pentadecanone a ketone (4.2%) were the principal constituents. Fifty nine compounds were identified in S. babylonica leaves, but the main constituents were tritetracontane (15.2%), octadecenoic acid-1,2,3-propanetriyl ester (11.1%), hexadecanoic acid-methyl ester (10.5%), and 1,3-dioxane-4-(hexadecyloxy)-2-pentadecyl (10.3%). Results suggest that the alcohol extract is mainly composed of oxygenated hydrocarbons of C10 to C60 compounds and contains predominantly phenolic hydrocarbons.

AB  - A method for efficient in vitro regeneration of Leucaena leucocephala cv. K636 was developed using immature zygotic embryos as the explant. Multiple shoot induction was achieved by culturing the explants on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with thidiazuron (TDZ) (0.03 to 1.5 μM). The maximum number of shoots per explants was achieved in 0.26 μM TDZ-supplemented media. TDZ concentration significantly influenced the induction of multiple shoots as well as the shoot-length. TDZ at 0.35 μM or higher concentrations resulted in abnormal stunted shoots. Full-strength MS media devoid of any plant growth regulator were used for shoot elongation. In vitro root induction was achieved in half-strength MS media supplemented either with 0.54 μM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or with 14.76 μM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) in combination with 0.23 μM kinetin (Kn). Media supplemented with 14.76 μM IBA in combination with 0.23 μM Kn induced twofold-threefold more roots than media supplemented with 0.54 μM NAA. However, the average root length was lower in 14.76 μM IBA in combination with 0.23 μM Kn than in 0.54 μM NAA. Regenerated plants were maintained under normal condition after hardening. Plants, which were rooted on media supplemented with 14.76 μM IBA in combination with 0.23 μM Kn showed higher survival rate during hardening than those rooted on 0.54 μM NAA supplemented media. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - The influences of an invasive plant species (Leucaena leucocephala) on tree regeneration in Khao Phuluang forest, northeastern Thailand

AB  - The influence of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) on tree regeneration was studied in a natural forest in the Khao Phuluang Ecotourism Development Project, northeastern Thailand. In total, three belt transects of 10 × 150 m were established perpendicular to the edge of the remnant forest (RF) and Leucaena plantation (LP) to study the changes in vegetation structure and species composition along a gradient from the RF into the adjacent LP. The vegetation transect census recorded the living numbers of seedlings, saplings and trees, excluding lianas, and the stem diameter and height were measured for saplings and trees. Light and soil conditions were also investigated. The results showed that the species composition in the LP was very low and only 16 species of 16 genera in 11 families were found. Leucaena had a high stem density and basal area cover of 1,196.7 stems.ha -1 and 13.92 m 2.ha -1, respectively. The high density created a closed canopy which reduced the relative light intensity measured as mean ± SD on the floor (18.5 ± 5.5%) which was similar to that of the RF (15.56 ± 2.8%). The distribution of the diameter at breast height of Leucaena fitted a negative exponential growth curve function (r 2 = 0.94), indicating the species had successful natural regeneration which was not only from seedlings but also from coppiced stems. The natural regeneration of native species from the RF towards the LP was highly significantly (ANOVA, P < 0.001) different for both the stem density and species number. The stem densities of trees, saplings and seedlings of native species were greater in the RF than in the LP. In addition, not only the native climax species but also pioneer species had less success in establishment in the LP. This would suggest that Leucaena plays an important role in restricting natural forest regeneration by its invasive growing habit which reduces light transmittance to the forest floor.

AB  - A survey on toxic plants for ruminants and equidae was performed on the municipalities of Juazeiro do Norte, Crato, Barbalha, and Missão Velha on the Ceará state, Northeastern Brazil. Twenty one interviews were realized with farmers, veterinary practitioners, agronomists and agriculture technicians. Poisonings by Ipomoea asarifolia mentioned in 38% and 19% interviews as toxic for bovines and sheep, respectively, and Enterolobium contotisiliquum, mentioned as toxic for cattle (47.6% of the interviews) and sheep (4.7%), were more frequent. Also occur in the region poisonings by Mascagnia rigida (38% of the interviews), Anadenanthera colubrina var. cebil (=A. macrocarpa) (14%), Ricinus communis (14%), Thiloa glaucocarpa (9%), and Sorghum halepense (4%) in cattle, Mimosa tenuiflora in cattle, sheep, and goats (38%), Brachiaria decumbens in sheep and cattle (38%), Manihot spp. in cattle and goats (28%), and Leucaena leucocephala in sheep and horses (4%). Several plants previously unknown as toxic, but mentioned by the respondents as poisonous, were given to experimental animals at different doses. Only Casearia commersoniana was toxic to goats at the daily doses of 20g kg-1 body weight during 2-4 days. Clinical signs, similar to those reported by the farmers, were stiffness, mild bloat, polaquiuria, vocalization, jugular engorgement and pulsation, swaying gait, falling, spasticity, paddling movements, opisthotonos, and tachyicardia and dyspnea followed by bradycardia and bradypnea. Deaths occurred 6 and 19 hours after first clinical signs. No significant gross or histologic lesions were observed. It is concluded that poisonings by plants are important cause of losses in the region, which has a population of 53,473 bovines, 4,799 goats, 9,149 sheep, and 7,060 equidae.

Results showed that the seedlings had a good ability to keep water as its LWC, and did not decrease significantly until 12d draught. The chlorophyll content increased significantly meanwhile the Chlorophyll (a/b) ratio decreased; The Pn, Tr and stomatal Gs of leaves significantly decreased, but the WUE increased; These results showed that L. leucocephala seedlings could maintain a reasonable physiological activity by keeping LWC, increasing chlorophyll content and reducing photosynthetic activity when subjected to drought stress. Therefore, it displays considerable tolerance to draught stress and could be selected as a suitable pioneer species for the ecological restoration of degraded ecosystem in Southwest China. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A cDNA encoding cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), catalyzing conversion of cinnamyl aldehydes to corresponding cinnamyl alcohols, was cloned from secondary xylem of Leucaena leucocephala. The cloned cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Temperature and Zn 2+ ion played crucial role in expression and activity of enzyme, such that, at 18 °C and at 2 mM Zn 2+ the CAD was maximally expressed as active enzyme in soluble fraction. The expressed protein was purified 14.78-folds to homogeneity on Ni-NTA agarose column with specific activity of 346 nkat/mg protein. The purified enzyme exhibited lowest Km with cinnamyl alcohol (12.2 μM) followed by coniferyl (18.1 μM) and sinapyl alcohol (23.8 μM). Enzyme exhibited high substrate inhibition with cinnamyl (beyond 20 μM) and coniferyl (beyond 100 μM) alcohols. The in silico analysis of CAD protein exhibited four characteristic consensus sequences, GHEXXGXXXXXGXXV; C 100, C 103, C 106, C 114; GXGXXG and C 47, S 49, H 69, L 95, C 163, I 300 involved in catalytic Zn 2+ binding, structural Zn 2+ binding, NADP + binding and substrate binding, respectively. Tertiary structure, generated using Modeller 9v5, exhibited a trilobed structure with bulged out structural Zn 2+ binding domain. The catalytic Zn 2+ binding, substrate binding and NADP + binding domains formed a pocket protected by two major lobes. The enzyme catalysis, sequence homology and 3-D model, all supported that the cloned CAD belongs to alcohol dehydrogenase family of plants. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thirty two Katahdin×Pelibuey crossbreed male lambs 3-4 months of age and 24 ± 0.3. kg body weight (BW) were used to study effects of administration of extracts rich in secondary compounds from Salix babylonica (SB) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL) on feed intake, nutrient digestibility and growth. After 2 weeks of adaptation consuming a total mixed ration (TMR; 219 and 141. g/kg of crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fibre (NDFom), respectively), lambs were weighed and distributed by BW into 4 pens of 8 lambs/pen in a completely randomized design with: Control group TMR; SB group TMR (as Control plus S. babylonica extract at 30. ml/d); LL group TMR (as Control plus L. leucocephala extract at 30. ml/d); SBLL group TMR (as Control plus 30. ml/d of S. babylonica and L. leucocephala extracts in a (1:1, v:v) mixture) for a 63 days experiment. Weekly stock volumes (2. l each) of the individual extracts as well as their 1:1 mixture were prepared for daily administration. Extracts were orally administered before the 08:00. h feeding to each lamb. Feed intake was recorded daily and BW was recorded at d 22 (P1), d 43 (P2) and d 63 (P3) of the experiment. Each experimental period ended with a digestibility measurement. Average daily gain (ADG), metabolizable protein (MP) intake and metabolizable energy (ME) intake were calculated. Plant secondary metabolites of total phenolics, saponins and the aqueous fraction were 50% lower in SB versus LL extracts. An extract×experimental period interaction occurred for intake of all nutrients (SB > LL = Control > SBLL, P<0.05). Intake of DM, OM, CP and ADFom were lowest in P3 than other periods, whereas the highest nutrients intake were in P2 and P1 (P<0.05). Individual extracts improved (SB > LL, P=0.05) the digestible DM, OM, EE and CP more than their 1:1 mixture compared with control or SBLL. Digestible DM was improved (P=0.03) by 5 and 3% with SB and LL extracts respectively, compared to control, whereas digestible CP was improved (P=0.005) by 7 and 5%, respectively, compared to control. Digestible ADFom was drastically lower in P1 and increased steadily in periods P2 and P3 (P<0.001). Feed intake was not affected by extract addition although it was reduced from P1 and P2 to P3. Relative to control, addition of extracts increased (P=0.024) ADG while the other performance parameters (i.e., MP intake, ME intake) had a tendency (P=0.05) to improve with extract addition. ADG was improved by about 22 and 21% with SB and LL extracts respectively, while their mixture (i.e., SBLL) was 2% compared to control (i.e., SB = LL > Control = SBLL, P=0.024). MP and ME intakes were decreased (P<0.0001) from P1 and P2 to P3. Results show that daily administration of individual extracts of S. babylonica and L. leucocephala improved lamb performance by 22 and 21%, but that a mixture of both had a much lower benefit. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The seed oil of Leuconia leucocephala was investigated for its antimicrobial activity and the pharmaceutical properties of its lotion formulation determined. The oil was extracted from the pulverised dried seeds of the Leuconia leucocephala plant by cold maceration in n-hexane. The oil was tested against four bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Esherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and four fungi (Aspergilus niger, Rhizopus stolon, Penicillum notatum and Candida albicans) isolates. Gentamycin and tioconazole were the reference drugs respectively. The oil was later formulated as a lotion and the pharmaceutical properties of the formulation determined.The oil was found to have a concentration-dependent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, while showing no activity against the fungi tested. The lotion formulation of the oil containing oleic acid had good pharmaceutical properties and was stable over the test period. Leucaena leucocephala seed oil extract had a concentration-dependent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the lotion formulation had good pharmaceutical properties.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the distribution of fauna as a function of soil moisture in different fodder-production management systems of Tifton 85 grass (Cynodon dactylon Pers. x C. niemfuensis Vanderys), Tanzania grass (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Tanzania), Andropogon Grass (Andropogon gayanus Kunth) and Leucena plants (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) R. de Wit.), with a coca-crop forest used as control. Sampling of the fauna was accomplished using "pitfall" traps in two periods of the year: September 2007 and March 2008, the dry and wet seasons respectively. Those systems with Tifton grass, Tanzania grass and Leucaena plants showed a higher number of individuals in both periods. The fire which occurred in the Andropogon grass before the first harvest resulted in a reduction in the amount and diversity of the soil fauna. The highest values for wealth, diversity and uniformity of fauna, were obtained from samples collected during the wet season. The forest presented a greater diversity and balance for both periods assessed. In a situation of water-stress, some groups, such as Collembola and Formicidae, predominated in the management systems, decreasing uniformity, while in the wet season, several groups were well represented, favouring uniformity. Principal-component multivariate analysis showed that systems of forest, Tifton grass, Tanzania grass and Leucaena plants were associated with several groups of soil fauna in the two periods evaluated, while the system of Andropogon grass, which suffered a fire, showed an affinity only with the Hepteroptera group during the dry season.

AB  - Carbon management index (ICM) is used to evaluate the scientificity of soil management. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and readily oxidized carbon (ROC) contents under Leucaena leucocephala stand, Acacia glauca stand, Acacia auriculiformis stand, Azadirachta indica stand, wasteland and dry cropland were determined and their ICM were calculated. The results showed that the SOC and ROC contents under the 6 land use types were 4.22-5.92 g · kg-1 and 1.34-2.33 g · kg-1, respectively. No significant differences in SOC contents among these land uses were observed. The ROC contents under the 4 types of woodland, however, were significantly higher than these under dry cropland or wasteland (P < 0.05). The ROC were high significantly (P < 0.001) correlated (R is 66.3%) with SOC. Compared with wasteland, the ICM ranged from 1.77 to 2.36 under these woodlands, and 0.99 under dry cropland. It is revealed that the litter quantity and land management under these land uses may be the key factors resulting in the variation of ROC. At ecological fragile region of Dry-hot Valley, closure management is useful to sequestrate C in woodland soils. However, the management systems for soil carbon pool under dry cropland are not in a sound way.

AB  - We developed site-specific allometric models for Leucaena leucocephala × pallida var. KX2 trees in a shaded coffee agroecosystem in Hawaii to predict above- and belowground biomass and the regrowth potential of pollarded trees. Models were used to compare tree growth rates in an experimental agroforestry system with different pollarding frequencies and additions of tree pruning residues as mulch. For all allometric equations, a simple power model (Y = aXb) provided the optimal prediction of biomass or regrowth after pollarding. For aboveground biomass components (stem, branches, leaves, and seed and pods), stem diameter alone was the best predictor variable. Stump diameter provided the best prediction of coarse root biomass and aboveground regrowth after pollarding. Predictions of biomass from generalized allometric models often fell outside the 95% confidence intervals of our site-specific models, especially as biomass increased. The combination of pollarding trees once per year plus the addition of tree mulch resulted in the greatest aboveground regrowth rates as well as accumulation of biomass and C in the stump plus coarse roots. Although optimal prediction required the development of site-specific allometric relationships, a simple power model using stem or stump diameter alone can provide an accurate assessment of above- and belowground tree biomass, as well as regrowth potential under specific management scenarios. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - A sixteen-week study was conducted to investigate the effects of mimosine and tannin toxicity on rabbits (Orytolagus cunniculus) fed processed Leucaena leucocephala leaves (LLL). Thirty-six growing rabbits (mixed breed) of average weight of 625 g were used for the experiment. The rabbits were randomly allotted to nine experimental groups of four rabbits each in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement. LLL were either sun dried (SDLLL), hot water processed (HWLLL) or ensiled (ELLL) for six weeks and included in three diets at 0, 10 and 20% levels respectively. Data were collected on feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio and other performance characteristics of the fed rabbits. The data collected were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) while the significant means were separated using Duncan's multiple range test. The anti-nutritional analysis showed that SDLLL contained highest tannin (1.20%) and mimosine (1.64%) contents but HWLLL had the least tannin (0.77%) and mimosine (1.25%) respectively. The best feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 4.41b and the highest (P < 0.05) weight gain were recorded by rabbits fed diets containing ELLL. The interaction effects showed that rabbits fed diets containing 20% SDLLL had alopaecia, necrotic spots, liver congestion, edema and highest percentage mortality. It was concluded that diets containing more than 1% of mimosine and tannin impaired the growth performance and had deleterious effects on liver of the rabbits. © 2011 Academic Journals.

AB  - This research determine the total phenol and flavonoids content as well as the fungistatic activity of hot water wood sawdust and bark extracts on Coniophora puteana and Trametes versicolor. Extracts tested were taken from Condalia hookeri M.C. Johnst., Ebenopsis ebano (Berl.) Britton et Rose, Helietta parvifolia (Gray) Benth, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, and Prosopis laevigata (Humb. et Bonpl. ex Willd). The extraction was developed with soxhlet aparats, phenol concentration was determined with Folin-Ciocalteu method and flavonoide was determined by Heimler procedure. Phenol concentration ranged between 50±11 to 827±23 mg g-1 and flavonoids content between 15±2 to 708±30 mg g-1. All extracts tested inhibited growth of the fungal species. The highest inhibition effect (88%±1) occurred on C. puteana with L. leucocephala wood sawdust extracts at 2 mg ml-1, this species also reduced the growth on T. versicolor by 75%±12 when used at 10 mg ml-1, wood sawdust extracts of H. parvifolia and C. hookerii at same concentration reduced the growth of T. versicolor in 43%±3 and 40%±4 respectively. Inhibition of bark extracts of E. ebano was 84±5 and 80±7 % for H. parvifolia. A negative relationship between growing inhibitory activity and the content of total phenolics in the extracts was obtained.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) is a typical 'conflict species', possessing both useful and damaging attributes, that has become naturalized in several countries worldwide, following deliberate introductions for agroforestry. Considered one of the 'World's 100 Worst Invaders', the plant in South Africa is an incipient or 'emerging weed', with infestations mostly occurring in the eastern subtropical regions of the country. Deliberate biological control efforts have been confined to South Africa, although these have been opportunistic, unfunded and, given the plant's propensity for prolific seed production, have focused exclusively on the seed beetle, Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae). Following confirmation of host specificity, and after several low-intensity releases, the beetle has become widely established in KwaZulu-Natal, where releases were mostly made, but also in Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the North West provinces. A sap-sucking psyllid, Heteropsylla cubana Crawford (Psyllidae), was inadvertently introduced into South Africa, but has not had any impact on weed infestations. The biological control programme against L. leucocephala in South Africa is reviewed, including: (i) aspects of the target plant that are pertinent to its invasiveness and management; (ii) details pertaining to the two natural enemies that have featured so far; (iii) progress that has been achieved; and (iv) the direction of future research efforts.

AB  - The issue of invasive species has been growing concerns recently. In Taiwan, Leucaena Leucocephala has invaded the native ecosystems and caused a serious problem in Hengchun Peninsula. Therefore, this study focuses on applying remote sensing and GIS to study the dispersal of Leucaena Leucocephala in Hengchun Peninsula. The research process includes (1) generating the land use map and the distribution map of Leucaena Leucocephala in 1994 and 2006 based on the integration of remote sensing and GIS; (2) investigating the effect of Leucaena Leucocephala dispersal on the landscape of Hengchun Peninsula via landscape structure indices and Shannon diversity t-test; (3) analyzing the significant landscape factors which are related to the dispersal of Leucaena Leucocephala through the logit model. The result is as follows. The land use map and the distribution map of Leucaena Leucocephala in 1994 and 2006 generated by remote sensing and GIS are acceptable after the accuracy assessment of test area. The result of Shannon diversity t-test indicates that the dispersal of Leucaena Leucocephala from 1994 to 2006 has significant effect on the landscape of Hengchun Peninsula. As for the selection of significant landscape factors using the logit model, the result shows that the dispersal of Leucaena Leucocephala are strongly related to four landscape factors such as slope, the distance from the seashore, the distance from the road, and the distance from Leucaena Leucocephala. Those factors are very important for the occurrence of Leucaena Leucocephala. The above results can be extended to the related forest units and National Park for a reference of the dispersal of Leucaena Leucocephala in Hengchun Peninsula.

AB  - Established the optimum plant density in forest trees is one of the difficult practices. It is of particular importance in chemical composition of wood because it is a very important approach for identifying wood uses. Thus the present study was carried out to investigate the influence of different planting spacing viz., 0.7m, 1,4m and 2.1m of Leucaena leucocephala and log height levels at breast height (BH), 25, 50 and 75% of total stem height. The study was carried out at Derab, College of Food and Agriculture Science, King Saud University Saudi Arabia. Results exhibited significant effect of spacing on chemical composition. Wide spacing had the highest average values of extractives, cellulose and ash contents, while narrow spacing gave higher average values of hemicellulose than either 1,4m or 2.1m highly significant variations in chemical composition among height levels were recorded. In general, the height level at 75% of total stem height recorded the highest average values of extractives, hemicellulose and lignin contents, whereas breast height had the highest average values of cellulose and ash contents. The increase in hemicellulose content at narrow spacing highlights another usage of wood in cattle fodder and it can be concluded that the utilization of wood from breast height is recommended than wood from the top for furniture and pulp. In addition, the wood from the top is recommended to turn the wood to furfural and ethanol. © IDOSI Publications, 2011.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to identify a collection of 35 Cupriavidus isolates at the species level and to examine their capacity to nodulate and fix N 2. These isolates were previously obtained from the root nodules of two promiscuous trap species, Phaseolus vulgaris and Leucaena leucocephala, inoculated with soil samples collected near Sesbania virgata plants growing in Minas Gerais (Brazil) pastures. Phenotypic and genotypic methods applied for this study were SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins, and 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequencing. To confirm the ability to nodulate and fix N 2, the presence of the nodC and nifH genes was also determined, and an experiment was carried out with two representative isolates in order to authenticate them as legume nodule symbionts. All 35 isolates belonged to the betaproteobacterium Cupriavidus necator, they possessed the nodC and nifH genes, and two representative isolates were able to nodulate five different promiscuous legume species: Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia, L. leucocephala, Macroptilium atropurpureum, P. vulgaris and Vigna unguiculata. This is the first study to demonstrate that C. necator can nodulate legume species. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted in the western Himalayan mid hills for two consecutive years to study the hedgerow intercropping of Leucaena leucocephala with Ocimum basilicum. Leucaena hedgerows were spaced seven meters apart with three different plant spacing within the hedgerows and three different organic manures were applied to the intercrop. The results showed that closely spaced (0.50 m) Leucaena hedgerows negatively influenced various growth and yield attributes like plant height, number of inflorescence and economic yield of the associated herb as compared to its wider spacing (0.75 m and 1.50 m). The use of organic manures benefited the intercrop by improving the growth even in the presence of hedgerows as compared to control plots (without trees). Irrespective of the tree spacing the growth of O. basilicum was suppressed to a greater extent at a distance closer to the hedgerows in all the treatments.

AB  - Interfacing nanowires and living cells is highly interesting in various fields including biomedical implants, biosensors or drug delivery. Vertically aligned silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays prepared by the stain etching technique were investigated in this study. Chemical modification with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) led to the formation of superhydrophobic SiNW surface with a contact angle around 160°. A micropatterned superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic SiNW surface was fabricated using standard optical lithography techniques. Here we report on Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO) cell culture on patterned superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic silicon nanowire surfaces. It was found that the cells adhered selectively to the superhydrophilic regions while cell adhesion was almost completely suppressed on the superhydrophobic surface. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the cell cytoplasmic projections penetrate the hydrophilic silicon nanowires layer and coat the nanowires, leading to an intimate surface contact and thus a strong adhesion. On the superhydrophobic surface, the cell cytoplasmic projections remained on the top of wires. The nonfouling of the superhydrophobic SiNW substrate was attributed to a stable Cassie-Baxter state, limiting the contact with the culture medium. Another interesting finding from this study is the corrosion of the superhydrophilic SiNW surface in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Effect of Leucaena leucocephala on soil organic carbon conservation on slope in the purple soil area
PY  - 2012

AB  - Hedgerow has been widely used to reduce soil erosion. However, little information is available concerning the effect of hedgerow on soil organic carbon sequestration for various land utilization patterns in purple soil. Long-term field experiment was carried out to study the effects of Leucaena leucocephala hedgerows on soil organic carbon sequestration. Surface soil samples (0-20 cm) were collected from six south-facing standard runoff plots, with reddish-brown purple soil, were selected from Soil and Water Conservation Experiment Station of in Anju District, Suining City, SichuanProvince, China for experiment. Hedgerows(Leucaena leucocephala)were planted on contour in plotII,IV,V, and plot I, III, VI without hedgerows were selected as the control group. Plots I and II were 10°cropland, plots III and IV were 10° economic forest, and plots V and VI were 15°cropland. The crop planting model of cropland was spring-wheat and spring- corn continuous cropping, and economic forest land was nectarine colonization. Leucaena leucocephala hedgerows has been established since 2006. Soil organic carbon (SOC), respiration rate, soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), and soil nutrient were measured. Results showed that soil organic carbon density of 10°cropland cropland (2. 85 kg/m2), 15° cropland (2. 37 kg/m2) and 10°economic forest land (3. 27 kg/m2) with hedgerows planting for three years were 41. 5%, 43. 3%, 32. 2% higher than those of control (2. 01, 1. 79, 2. 28 kg/m2) respectively. Meanwhile,soil organic carbon content,organic carbon density and respiration rate in 10°economic forest land were more greater than that of 10°cropland. Moreover, 10°cropland increased SOC content,respiration rate and SMBC than those of 15°cropland significantly;Results indicated that cropland was more efficient for conservation of SMBC than economic forest land. In addition,SOC and respiration rate on downhill were significantly higher than those of uphill for the same treatment. However,neither slope position nor land utilization patterns had significant effect on microbial quotient,which may imply that effects of cropland and economic forest on the soil conversation and did not differ significantly. The correlation between SOC and soil physicochemical properties varied with different treatments. Significant positive correlations were found between SOC and SMBC for 10°cropland, 15°cropland and 10°economic forest land,while SOC and SMBC were negatively correlated with pH. In addition, significant positive correlations were also observed between respiration rate and SOC for 10°cropland, 15° cropland with hedgerows, while significant correlation between the respiration intensity and soil organic carbon of 10° economic forest land with hedgerows. The variation of soil microbial parameters accorded with that of SOC, which may reflect a change of soil quality. The results indicated that Leucaena leucocephala hedgerows was beneficial to soil organic carbon sequestration,microbial activity enhancement and improving soil quality.

AB  - A floor pen trial was conducted for evaluating antiparasitic efficacy and feed additive effect of Leucaena leucocephala seed extract (LLS) in broiler chicken. Subabul seed extract is moderately effective in controlling coccidiosis in broiler chicken at 10% concentration. But higher concentration also resulted in reduced weight gain, decreased feed intake and increased mortality as compared to control group which may be due to presence of mimosine in LLS.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia farnesiana are tree species used for several agricultural purposes in the Mediterranean region. The seeds of these species exhibit dormancy, causing delayed germination. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of pre-sowing treatments (scarification, hot water, or soaking) on seed germination of L. leucocephala and A. farnesiana. In one experiment, seeds were exposed to three pre-sowing treatments: control, sandpaper scarification, or soaking in 70°C water for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, or 24 min. In another experiment, seeds were soaked in 70°C water for 20 min, and then soaked in water at room temperature for an additional 24, 48, or 72 h or blade scarified. In general, soaking the seeds of the two species in hot water was more effective in breaking seed dormancy than scarification. Sandpaper scarification was not effective for either species. Blade scarification increased A. farnesiana seed germination to 56%, indicating that seed dormancy was mainly a consequence of hardseededness. L. leucocephala seeds collected from Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) site and soaked in 70°C water for 20 min and then soaked for 24, 48, or 72 h had germination rates above 97%. Our results suggest that blade scarification of A. farnesiana seeds and soaking of L. leucocephala seeds in 70°C water for 20 min are effective treatments to break seed dormancy and enhance seed germination of these vital species. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - We propose robust engineering superlyophobic surfaces (SLS) as a universal microfluidic platform for droplet manipulation enabling electric actuation, featured with characteristics of highly nonwetting, low adhesion, and low friction for various liquids including water and oil. To functionalize SLS with embedded electrodes, two configurations with continuous and discrete topologies have been designed and compared. The discrete configuration is found to be superior upon comparison of their fabrication, microstructures and nonwetting performances. We also present new formulation of SLS pressure stability for linear, square and hexagonal pattern layouts, and propose a criterion for three wetting states (the Cassie-Baxter, partial Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states) by introducing two dimensionless parameters, which are supported by our experimental data. Droplet manipulation experiments including deformation and transport on electrode-embedded SLS were performed, showing that present SLS reduce adhesion and flow resistance of oil droplets respectively by 98% and 73% compared with a smooth hydrophobic surface, and the excellent hydrodynamic performances are applicable for a wide range of droplet velocity. Simulation of an oil droplet electrically actuated on SLS predicts the significantly increased droplet motion for a low solid fraction and a relatively large droplet size. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The samples were separated in different depths 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm. The macrofauna samples were separate, counted and classified until family level. No significant interaction was observed. However, effect of all factors studied was obtained, except of the pruning strategy, among individues/m2 density. Significant differences among the second (57.8) and third (66.5) year of exploitation, compared with the establishment (15.9) and in the first year of exploitation (20.9) were observed. During the rainy season (44.78) the biggest quantity in individuals was observed by area unit, as well as in the tree systems (M+P: 31.31; M+L+P: 36,95), with the most spaced grazing frequency (39,40) and in the first 10 cm of depth (56.00; P<0.01). Bigger qualitative wealth in terms of species in the associate systems was observed. The mulberry and leucaena presence favored the colonization in the associate systems and the biggest phylum, classes, orders and families of edaphic organisms were counted.

TI  - Reclassification of Rhizobium tropici type A strains as Rhizobium leucaenae sp. nov

AB  - Rhizobium tropici is a well-studied legume symbiont characterized by high genetic stability of the symbiotic plasmid and tolerance to tropical environmental stresses such as high temperature and low soil pH. However, high phenetic and genetic variabilities among R. tropici strains have been largely reported, with two subgroups, designated type A and B, already defined within the species. A polyphasic study comprising multilocus sequence analysis, phenotypic and genotypic characterizations, including DNA-DNA hybridization, strongly supported the reclassification of R. tropici type A strains as a novel species. Type A strains formed a well-differentiated clade that grouped with R. tropici, Rhizobium multihospitium, Rhizobium miluonense, Rhizobium lusitanum and Rhizobium rhizogenes in the phylogenies of the 16S rRNA, recA, gltA, rpoA, glnII and rpoB genes. Several phenotypic traits differentiated type A strains from all related taxa. The novel species, for which the name Rhizobium leucaenae sp. nov. is proposed, is a broad host range rhizobium being able to establish effective root-nodule symbioses with Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena esculenta, common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and Gliricidia sepium. Strain CFN 299T (=USDA 9039T=LMG 9517T=CECT 4844T=JCM 21088T=IAM 14230T=SEMIA 4083T=CENA 183T=UMR1026T=CNPSo 141T) is designated the type strain of Rhizobium leucaenae sp. nov. © 2012 IUMS.

AB  - Lead (Leucaena leucocephala) seed extract was prepared using distilled water as a medium. An extraction yield of 26.16 g/100 g of seed was obtained after extraction at room temperature for 12 h. Total phenolic and mimosine contents in the lead seed extract powder (LSEP) were 17.4 g GAE/100 g and 8.8 g/100 g, respectively. LSEP at different concentrations (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1%, w/v) showed inhibitory activity towards polyphenoloxidase (PPO) of Pacific white shrimp in a dose dependent manner. When the whole Pacific white shrimp were treated with 0.25% and 0.5% (w/v) LSEP, the shrimp treated with 0.5% LSEP had the lower melanosis score throughout the storage of 12 days and showed a higher score for colour and odour, as well as overall likeness, compared with the control (without treatment) and 1.25% sodium metabisulphite treated samples at day 12 (P < 0.05). Meat of shrimps treated with LSEP at both levels had the increase in mimosine content up to 8 days, suggesting the migration of mimosine into shrimp muscle during extended storage. Therefore, 0.5% LSEP can be used as a novel melanosis inhibitor for Pacific white shrimp. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant hydrocolloids dominate the food industry as thickeners, gelling agents and viscosity modifiers. These hydrocolloids are mostly sourced from tropic plants. Nigeria, by virtue of its location in the tropics, is a harbinger of these plants which are distributed across its six ecological zones, from the mangrove rain forest to the arid zone. These hydrocolloid-rich plants are under-utilized having only served as thickeners in local cuisines. Lack of information on the properties of the hydrocolloids from these plants has made them to remain largely commercially unexplored. Among the plants studied are Brachystigia eurycoma, Prosopis africana, Afzelia africana, Mucuna flagellipes, Detarium microcarpum, Adansonia digit at a, Irvingia gabonensis, Gliricidia sepium, Peltrophorum pterocarpum, Bauhinia monandra, Cola milleni, Caesalpinea pulcherrima, Delonix regia and Leucaena leucocephala. This study evaluates the potential of these plants as sources of industrial hydrocolloids. We have examined the endosperm-seed ratio, yield, rheological and molecular properties of the hydrocolloids. Our results show that some of these hydrocolloids possess novel properties which can be exploited in the food industry. © The Royal Socicty of Chemistry 2012.

AB  - The litter production, decomposition and N release from leaves of three woody species, Leucaena leucocephala, Guazuma ulmifolia and Moringa oleifera, in pure fodder banks and the association of L. leucocephala + G. ulmifolia and L. leucocephala + M. oleifera, as mixed fodder banks, were evaluated. Twenty plots (200 m2) in a completely randomized block design with four replicates were used. Litter production was estimated using traps installed in the middle row of each plot. For decomposition, were used fresh leaves of L. leucocephala, G. ulmifolia y M. oleifera and their mixtures. 120 litter bags of 30 × 30 cm each were used and randomly distributed within the plots (6 bags per plot). Two bags were removed from each plot at 4, 8 and 16 weeks. The remained material was weighed, dried, ground and N content was determined. To determine decay constant (κ), we used the model Y = a · e -κ·t .The litter accumulation was different among treatments (P < 0.05). The fodder banks of L. leucocephala + G. ulmifolia had the higher production, while that the M. oleifera bank had the minor. L. leucocephala, associate with G. ulmifolia presented a lower litter production (385 kg DM ha-1), which when associated with M. oleifera or was alone (623.3 and 653.2 kg DM ha-1, respectively). Litter production of M. oleifera associated with L. leucocephala, was superior, compared to monoculture (124.1 vs. 58.0 kg DM ha-1). At 4 weeks, litter from the banks of M. oleifera, L. leucocephala y G. ulmifolia registered a decomposition of 88, 76 and 73%, respectively; while L. leucocephala + G. ulmifolia y L. leucocephala + M. oleífera showed a decomposition of 76 and 83%, respectively. Fodder banks of M. oleifera, L. leucocephala y G. ulmifolia at 4 weeks, release the 90, 86 and 74% of the N content in ztheir foliages, respectively. The accumulate litter production was higher in the mixed fodder banks. Most decomposition occurred in the banks that included M. oleífera. The N release from the foliage was faster in pure fodder banks.

TI  - Agronomic and economic evaluation of mulching in rainfed maize-wheat cropping system in the western Himalayan region of India
PY  - 2011
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79961140372&doi=10.1080%2f15427528.2011.574498&partnerID=40&md5=c4aef054bf5184ed468a03dace7ba7d5
AB  - Mulching is highly beneficial for resource conservation under rainfed conditions, but non-availability of organic biomass and easy availability of fertilizers and herbicides has led to a gradual discontinuation of this practice. Various vegetative materials, including some troublesome weedy perennials, are available locally, which can be recycled for enhanced soil moisture and nutrient conservation. A field experiment was conducted at Dehradun, India, from 2001-2004 to study the effect of mulching with kudzu (Peuraria hirsuta), wild sage (Lantana camara), and subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) applied at 30 and 60 days of growth of maize (Zea mays), maize harvest, and sowing of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Application of 10 t/ha (fresh biomass) added 1.6-2.3 t dry matter through Peuraria, 2.5-3.2 t through Lantana, and 2.9-3.9 t/ha through Leuceana, which contributed 47.7-60.9 kg N, 58.4-70.9 kg N, and 118.4-148.4 kg N/ha, respectively. All mulching materials were beneficial and improved productivity of maize significantly by 16.6-20.6% over no mulching. Wheat yield also increased because of mulching in previous maize (+11.2%), and the beneficial effect was relatively greater (12.4-25.1%) when mulching was done at maize harvest or wheat sowing. Mulching showed improvement in organic C and total N status, and a decrease in bulk density associated with an increase in infiltration rate across three cropping cycles. Wheat gave three to five times more net profit than maize, and the net benefit-cost ratio of the system was the highest (1.34-1.35) when mulching was done at 60 days of maize growth with Peuraria and Leucaena. It was concluded that mulching with available vegetative materials in standing crop of maize or after harvest was beneficial for improving moisture conservation, productivity, and profitability of a maize-wheat cropping system under Doon valley conditions. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Effects of species and season on chemical composition and ruminal crude protein and organic matter degradability of some multi-purpose tree species by West African dwarf rams

AB  - Seasonal chemical composition and ruminal organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) degradabilities were determined in four tropical multi-purpose tree species (MPTS) namely; Pterocarpus santalinoides, Grewia pubescens, Enterolobium cyclocarpum and Leucaena leucocephala. Three West African dwarf (WAD) rams fitted with permanent rumen cannula were used for the degradability trials. Foliage samples were collected four times to represent seasonal variations as follows: January - mid dry; April - late dry; July - mid rainy and October - late rainy seasons. Leaf samples were randomly collected from the trees for estimation of dry matter (DM) and chemical composition. Ruminal in sacco OM and CP degradabilities were estimated from residues in nylon bags. All samples had high CP (161-259g/kg DM) and moderate fibre concentrations [neutral detergent fibre (without residual ash], 300-501g/kg DM; acid detergent fibre (without residual ash), 225-409g/kg DM and acid detergent lignin, 87-179g/kg DM across seasons. Interaction effects of species and season on chemical composition were highly significant (p=0.001) except for trypsin inhibitor (p=0.614). The MPTS recorded more than 60% OM and CP degradability at 24h, which implied that they were all highly degradable in the rumen. Their incorporation into ruminant feeding systems as dry season forage supplements is therefore recommended. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

TI  - Amino acid profile of the protein from whole saliva of goats and sheep and its interaction with tannic acid and tannins extracted from the fodder of tropical plants

AB  - The foraging response of goats and sheep to tannin-rich plants (TRP) could be influenced by their physiological adaptation to eat fodder from a specific ecological niche. The aims of this study were: (1) to describe the amino acid profile of the protein from whole saliva of adult goats and hair sheep browsing/grazing native vegetation, (2) to measure the interaction of whole saliva from goats and hair sheep with tannic acid, (3) to compare the tannin-binding capacity of lyophilized whole saliva from goats and sheep to precipitate tannins extracted from the fodder of tropical TRP (Acacia pennatula, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Leucaena leucocephala and Piscidia piscipula). Fresh whole saliva was obtained from 42 adult goats and 51 adult hair sheep. A second batch of saliva (obtained from 75 adult goats and 93 adult hair sheep) was lyophilized whole saliva. Protein from whole saliva in both animal species had a similar pattern of amino acid composition. Histidine and arginine were found, accounting for 30% and 24% of the amino acid content, respectively. Whole saliva from goats and sheep showed a linear dose response to increasing concentrations of tannic acid at each time point measured (P<. 0.001). Saliva from goats was able to precipitate higher quantities of TRP extracts from A. pennatula and L. latisiliquum than from P. piscipula and L. leucocephala (P<. 0.05). Saliva from sheep precipitated higher quantities of L. latisiliquum and P. piscipula extracts (P<. 0.01). Also, salivary proteins from goats had higher capacity to precipitate tannins from A. pennatula than sheep, while salivary protein from sheep had higher capacity to precipitate tannins from P. piscipula than goats (P<. 0.05). The results provide evidence of the differences between goats and sheep in the capacity of their saliva to interact with local sources of tannins, which could explain the different feeding behaviour of goats and sheep. The presence of histatins may help to explain the in vivo AH effects of TRP fodder. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Facile creation of hierarchical PDMS microstructures with extreme underwater superoleophobicity for anti-oil application in microfluidic channels

AB  - Composition modification and surface microstructures have been widely utilized in interface science to improve the surface performance. In this paper, we observed a significant improvement of oil contact angle (CA) from 66 ± 2° to 120 ± 4° by introducing a radical silanol group on a flat PDMS surface through oxygen plasma pretreatment. By combining surface microstructures and plasma modification, we produced three kinds of superoleophobic surfaces: 20 μm pitch micropillar arrays, 2.5 μm pitch micropillar arrays and gecko foot-like hierarchical microstructures. Among them, the hierarchical surface with high surface roughness showed extreme underwater superoleophobicity, which featured ultrahigh CA (175 ± 3°) and ultrasmall sliding angle (<1°). Quantitative measurements demonstrated that these superoleophobic surfaces exhibited distinct adhesive behaviors, by which they were interpreted as Wenzel's, Cassie's and the Lotus state, respectively. A microfluidic channel with superoleophobic microstructures was further created by novel curve-assisted imprint lithography, and the characterization based on anti-oil contamination applications was carried out and discussed. We believe that the superoleophobic surfaces will power broad applications in oil microdroplet transportation, anti-oil channels and droplet microfluidic systems. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Moisture-dependent wettability of artifi cial hydrophobic soils and its relevance for soil water desorption curves
PY  - 2012

AB  - Soil wettability is strongly affected by the soil water content. In turn, wettability infl uences water distribution in soil pores and thereby soil water retention characteristics. In this study, soil water desorption curves (SWDC) for naturally occurring hydrophilic sand, loam, and silt loam samples and for corresponding artifi cially hydrophobized sand, loam, and silt loam samples were measured in the pF range from 0 to 4.2. Moisture-dependent wettability was described with the contact angle (CA) method and the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test. One objective was to directly measure the phenomenological CA of the soils at different water contents and to compare the results with that from the WDPT test. A second objective was to show differences of soil water desorption curves for the hydrophilic materials as compared to the silanized hydrophobic materials. All experiments were done on soil samples with time-stable water repellency to study directly the impact of water content without further time dependent factors. Soil wettability as a function of water content was generally comparable, indicating that CA and WDPT could be used to indicate the moisture-dependent wettability. The SWDCs were separated into three domains. Domain I was characterized by the Wenzel wetting regime, and Domains II and III were described by the Cassie-Baxter wetting regime. Water repellency showed insignifi cant impacts on the SWDCs in Domains I and III, but it reduced soil water retention capacity in Domain II, which was supported by the monotonical increase of CA from zero to a maximum as soil water content decreased to a critical point near the permanent wilting point. Water repellency had clear and important infl uences on soil water desorption curves. © Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - There are two main threats to biodiversity in the world. One of them is the direct inadvertent destruction of habitats by people which is done basically through inappropriate resource use or pollution the other highly serious but under estimated problem is the threat to natural and semi-natural habitats by invasion of alien organisms it is the lasting threat as compared to the first one because when exploitation stops the existing aliens do not disappear but continue to spread and consolidate. Our planet is quickly being taken over by hundreds of hardy aggressive species spread either knowingly or accidentally by human hands these are considered the second most significant threat to biodiversity after habitat destruction. These weeds are causing damages worth billions of dollars world wide and Pakistan being no exception. The countries rich repository of 6,000 of vesicular plants is highly threatened by a number of alien weeds among those some are worth mentioning such as Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus), Lantana (Lantana camara), Paper mulberry (Brossonetia papyrifera), Mesquet (Prosopis juliflora), Wild tamarind (Leucaena leucocephala), Khakiweed (Alternanthera pungens) etc. These weeds especially P. hysterophorus are highly noxious plant species and threatening the natural and agriculture ecosystem of the country. Parthenium is allergenic to both humans and animals and after invading Punjab is quickly moving towards NWFP. This is primarily because of unawareness about this plant and secondly that it is being constantly used in floral bouquets. Similarly there are many more in the list developed by IUCN in the year 2000 for Pakistan. Though it is difficult to manage these aggressive alien organisms but success stories have been documented regarding biological/chemical control and other integrated approaches. More over a careful revision of legislation regarding quarantine and enforcement of the same may prove useful to mitigate the threats of these weeds. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Determination of mimosine and 2, 3-dihydroxypyridine in Leucaena Leucocephala by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-82655176942&doi=10.4028%2fwww.scientific.net%2fAMM.140.296&partnerID=40&md5=f003cd6a1e8b720d9d7d318286df712e
AB  - A reversed high performance liquid chromatography method was developed for the quantitative determination of mimosine and 2, 3-DHP in leaves of Leucaena Leucocephala. Mimosine and 2, 3DHP were extracted using 0.1N HCl. The chromatograph conditions were investigated and optimized. The optimal HPLC conditions as follows: Agilent HC-C18 column (4.6×150mm, 5μm) was used at 30°C. The method used a variable wavelength UV detector at 280nm, the mobile phase consisted of 0.2 % (w/v) orthophosphoric acid and methanol, the gradient elution was adopted. The injection volume was 10μL. The linearity is favorable in the range of 1.0 to 50μg mL- 1 with a correlation coefficient of 0.99998 for mimosine and 0.99902 for 2, 3DHP. Under the optimal conditions, the method limit of detection (LOD) of mimosine and 2, 3DHP were 0.40mg/kg and 0.55mg/kg respectively. The recovery of mimosine was 87.00-94.70% with the RSD (n=5) of 2.75-3.81% in the spiked levels 0, 1, 5, 20mg/g. At the same time, the recovery of 2, 3DHP was 88-95.4% with the RSD (n=5) of 2.24-4.90%. The method was found to be simple, sensitive, fast and accurate, and has been applied successfully for the quantitative detection of mimosine and 2, 3-DHP in leaves of Leucaena Leucocephala, plasma and excretion of ruminant.

TI  - Comparing the sensitivity of two in vitro assays to evaluate the anthelmintic activity of tropical tannin rich plant extracts against Haemonchus contortus
PY  - 2011
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80052546174&doi=10.1016%2fj.vetpar.2011.03.052&partnerID=40&md5=96971b1b6be6ef004d5148e7fae0f7ea
AB  - The present trial aimed at comparing the sensitivity of two in vitro methods, i.e. the larval migration inhibition assay (LMIA) and the larval exsheathment inhibition assay (LEIA), to evaluate the anthelmintic (AH) properties of tannin-rich plant extracts against Haemonchus contortus infective larvae. The two assays were applied on the same batch of H. contortus infective larvae exposed to water/acetonic extracts obtained from four tropical plants with different tannin contents: Acacia gaumeri, Brosimum alicastrum, Havardia albicans and Leucaena leucocephala. Increasing concentrations (0, 75, 150, 300, 600, 1200μg/ml PBS) of lyophilized extracts were used in both in vitro assays. A general lineal model test was used to determine the dose-effect in the LMIA or the difference in the percentage of exsheathed larvae between the respective control and treated groups. The LMIA showed a dose-dependent AH effect for H. albicans (P<0.001) and A. gaumeri (P<0.05), but not for L. leucocephala and B. alicastrum. In contrast, the exsheathment process was significantly affected by all doses of H. albicans and A. gaumeri extracts and a significant dose-dependent effect was found for B. alicastrum and L. leucocephala. Calculation of lethal dose (LD) was possible with LEIA using B. alicastrum and L. leucocephala but not with H. albicans and A. gaumeri as the lowest tested concentration was achieving more than 50% inhibition. Calculation of LD with the LMIA results was not feasible. These results suggest that tannin-rich plant extracts are more potent inhibitors of the exsheathment of H. contortus L 3 larvae than their motility. This information underlines the difference of sensitivity between methodological procedures to evaluate the AH properties of plant extracts on the same nematode stage. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Galactomannan thin films as supports for the immobilization of Concanavalin A and/or dengue viruses
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-83555165001&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijbiomac.2011.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=ca9cf97ee44e59b2009029189bb7f571
AB  - The immobilization of the glucose/mannose-binding lectin from Concanavalia ensiformis seeds (ConA) onto a monolayer made of a galactomannan extracted from Leucaena leucocephala seeds (GML), which was adsorbed onto - amino-terminated surfaces, was investigated by means of ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. The mean thickness of GML monolayer, which polysaccharide consists of linear 1 → 4-linked β- d-mannopyranosil units partially substituted at C-6 by α- d-galactopyranosyl units, amounted to (1.5 ± 0.2). nm. ConA molecules adsorbed onto GML surfaces forming (2.0 ± 0.5). nm thick layers. However, in the presence of mannose the adsorption failed, indicating that ConA binding sites were blocked by mannose and were no longer available for mannose units present in the GML backbone. The GML film was also used as support for the adsorption of three serotypes of dengue virus particles (DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3), where DENV-2 formed the thickest film (4 ± 2). nm. The adsorbed layer of DENV-2 onto ConA-covered GML surfaces presented mean thickness values similar to that determined for DENV-2 onto bare GML surfaces. The addition of free mannose units prevented DENV-2 adsorption onto ConA-covered GML films by ∼50%, suggesting competition between virus and mannose for ConA binding sites. This finding suggests that if ConA is also adsorbed to GML surface and its binding site is blocked by free mannose, virus particles are able to recognized GML mannose unities substituted by galactose. Interactions between polysaccharides thin films, proteins, and viruses are of great relevance since they can provide basis for the development of biotechnological devices. These results indicate that GML is a potential polysaccharide for biomaterials development, as those could involve interactions between ConA in immune system and viruses. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to investigate the diversity of 179 bean isolates recovered from six field sites in the Arcos de Valdevez region of northwestern Portugal. The isolates were divided into 6 groups based on the fingerprint patterns that were obtained. Representatives for each group were selected for sequence analysis of 4 chromosomal DNA regions. Five of the groups were placed within Rhizobium lusitanum, and the other group was placed within R. tropici type IIA. Therefore, the collection of Portuguese bean isolates was shown to include the two species R. lusitanum and R. tropici. In plant tests, the strains P1-7, P1-1, P1-2, and P1-16 of R. lusitanum nodulated and formed nitrogen-fixing symbioses both with Phaseolus vulgaris and Leucaena leucocephala. A methyltransferase-encoding nodS gene identical with the R. tropici locus that confers wide host range was detected in the strain P1-7 as well as 24 others identified as R. lusitanum. A methyltransferase-encoding nodS gene also was detected in the remaining isolates of R. lusitanum, but in this case the locus was that identified with the narrow-host-range R. etli. Representatives of isolates with the nodS of R. etli formed effective nitrogen-fixing symbioses with P. vulgaris and did not nodulate L. leucocephala. From sequence data of nodS, the R. lusitanum genes for symbiosis were placed within those of either R. tropici or R. etli. These results would support the suggestion that R. lusitanum was the recipient of the genes for symbiosis with beans from both R. tropici and R. etli. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Hydroforages are considered as feed of a high nutritive value. The main aim of this survey was to determine the indictors of the Leucaena leococephala hydroforage (LHF) nutritive value to be used in feeding rabbits. The fallowing aspects were taken into account to reach such objective: feed chemical composition, aminoacid profile, presence of secondary metabolites, physical properties and invitro digestibility. In an experiment it was used a completely aleatorized design. LHF showed a 23 % of dry matter with high levels of gross protein (27.2 %) and the ash contained were 8.13 %, it is outstanding the level of calcium (1.42 %). This food exhibit proper aminoacid concentration considered as essentials for rabbits. Tannins are found in leucaena seeds in an amount of 9 % and at the age of 25 days the LHF concentration was of 1.1 %. Besides mimosine was found in seeds of the plant at 4.5 % but it was not found at an age of 25 days in LHF. As the age of LHF increased secondary metabolites content decreased to the 25 days. LHF fiber solubility was 26.6% with 11.98 (gg-1NDF) water absorption capacity. Dry matter digestibility reached in LHF was 67.73 %. LHF showed a high digestibility of dry matter, high values of gross protein with the elements of cell wall in a position of equilibrium, also it showed high levels of solubility and adsorption water capacity, such feed should be used in feeding rabbits.

AB  - The study was carried out on the determination of the zootechnical parameters and the economic effectiveness of sheep fattening in the Sheep-goat National Program (PNOC) of Kolokope in Togo. The study has concerned 75 rams of Djallonke race, separated into three batches of 25 animals of 15 to 17 months old and of average live weight of 27.53 ± 1.45 kg. After 6 hours of daily pasture, these rams received three rations of supplementary feeding stuffs. The fattening was carried out in rainy season during 142 days. The rams of batch I were complemented with cotton seeds (Ration GC). Those of batch II received a mixture of cotton seeds and wheat bran (Ration GC-SC). The rams of batch III received a mixture of cotton seeds, wheat bran and leaves of Leucaena leucocephala (Ration GC-SC-L). At the end of the experimentation, the daily average weight gains were 43.22±22.49; 55.91±28.45 and 66.37±19.97 g respectively for rations GC, GC-SC, and GC-SC-L and the indices of consumption were respectively 12, 11.85 and 10.98. These zootechnical results show that the performances of the sheep in fattening depends on the food factors. The clear margin varied from 4,222 to 1,800 F CFA per animal for rations GC-SC-L and GC-SC.

AB  - This study consisted of two experiments aimed to evaluate the dietary digestibility by Rhode Island Red (RIR) hens fed different levels of Leucaena leucocephala (LLM) or Moringa oleifera (MOLM). In each experiment, four groups each of nine birds were assigned to four dietary treatments containing 0, 5, 10 and 15 % of LLM (Exp 1) or MOLM (Exp 2). All groups received smashed diets, containing similar metabolizable energy and crude protein for six weeks and during the last four days, feed intake was recorded daily and excreta was totally collected twice a day and weighed individually. The dietary treatments had no significant effects on the intake of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), gross energy (GE), crude protein (CP) or neutral detergent fiber (NDF) in both experiments, while the acid detergent fiber (ADF) intake increased linearly with the increase of LLM and MOLM levels. The apparent digestibility of DM, CP, ADF, and OM decreased linearly with the increase of LLM and MOLM levels. The apparent digestibility of gross energy decreased linearly in LLM experiment, while it was not affected in MOLM experiment. LLM and MOLM could be recommended for RIR hens between 5 and 10% of the diet.

AB  - Biology, morphometrics and analyses of non-specific esterases were carried out for populations of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) collected from leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] in New Delhi, India and compared with those for cotton populations. The developmental periods of the egg, and the first to fourth instars of the leucaena populations were 6.7 × 0.18, 4.2 × 0.18, 3.8 × 0.14, 3.0 × 0.0 and 5.2 × 0.18 days, respectively, with a total life-cycle duration of 22.9 × 0.58 days; fecundity (62.60 × 61.53 eggs per female) and longevity (male: 13.50 × 0.12 days, female: 16.50 × 0.12 days) were higher than those recorded for the cotton population, with a sex ratio (male:female) of 1:3.7 in cotton and 1:4 in leucaena. Morphometrics revealed significant differences in the length of egg, second, third and fourth instars (P-<-0.05). Of the 62 measurements of the puparia analysed, 70% of those of the head, 44% of those of the thorax and 51% of those of the abdomen showed significant differences between the cotton and leucaena populations. Mapping of the host association of samples onto principal component ordination showed their significant separation according to host plants, with the first three principal components accounting for 66% of the total variation. The analysis of non-specific esterases showed two bands at Rm E0.18 and E0.23 in the cotton populations but not in the leucaena populations. So far, B. tabaci is known on leucaena only from Taiwan. The present study reports it as a new host record from India in addition to documenting the biology, morphometrics and esterases of this and a cotton population. © 2011 ICIPE.

AB  - The design of sustainable agroecosystems requires knowledge of plant species impacts on soil functioning. To address this need, we manipulated plant species diversity in pastures of eastern Amazonia. Four plant species (. Arachis pintoi, . Brachiaria brizantha, . Leucaena leucocephala and . Solanum rugosum) were grown alone and in every possible combination on experimental plots within three replicate farms. After 28. months, soils were sampled to determine impacts on 5 categories of variables: soil macrofauna, aggregate morphology, chemical fertility, water storage and compaction. No clear effects of plant species richness were observed on any of the soil properties measured. However, individual plant species had significant impacts on variables in all 5 categories. Most notably, the herbaceous legume, . A. pintoi, promoted both earthworm and ant densities and a corresponding 87% increase in biogenic aggregates in plots with vs. without . A. pintoi. Meanwhile, . B. brizantha increased the proportion of root-derived aggregates, while negatively impacting ant densities. Significant covariation was observed among many of the 5 data sets (categories), namely soil aggregate morphology and soil macrofauna, as well as aggregate morphology and soil compaction. This research demonstrates that plant species composition can impact soil properties through faunal-mediated effects, and stresses the necessity of considering soil macrofauna in agroecosystem management. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Four Thai-rumen fistulated swamp buffaloes male (Bubalus bubalis), about 3 years old with 360±18kg liveweight were assigned according to a 2×2 factorial arrangement in a 4×4 Latin square design to receive dietary treatments. The treatments were as follows: TI) level of concentrate at 0.1% BW with Leucaena leucocepholo Leaf Meal (LLLM) at 300 gihdlday; T2) concentrate at 0.2%BW with LLLM at 300 gihdlday; 13) concentrate at 0.1%BW with heated Leucoeno leucocepholo Leaf Meal (HLLLM) at 300 gihdlday and T4) concentrate at 0.2%BW with HLLLM at 300 g/hd/day. The results revealed a significant increase in roughage and total DM intake (p<0.05) by concentrate level at 0.2%BW (T2 and T4) as comparedwith concentrate level at 0.1%BW (TI and T3). Digestion coefficient (%) ofDM, OM and CP were increased by level of concentrate at 0.2%BWwhile NDF and ADF were similar among treatments. However, there was no effect of neither energy level nor HLLLM onnnninal pH and temperature (p>0.05). Concentration of nnninal NH3-N was decreased by HLLLM as compared withLLLM (p<0.05) while blood urea-nitrogen wasnot changed and was in normal range. Total bacterial direct counts were found significantly different (p<0.05) whereas fungi zoospores and protozoal populations were similar among treatments. Nevertheless, viable bacterial counts were found affected by both concentrate level and HLLLM. The treatments with HLLLM were lower than those in LLLM and concentrate level at 0.2%BW were higher than those supplemented at 0.1%(p<0.05). Based on this study, it could be concluded that HLLLM could be used as a protein source in terms of nnnen undegradable protein while the combination ofHLLLM and concentrate levelat 0.2%ofBW could enhance the voluntary feed intake, nutrient digestibility, nnnen fermentation and ecology in swamp buffalo fed supplementation on 2+2%urea-lime treated rice straw. © Medwell Joumals, 2011.

TI  - Isolation of cinnamoyl CoA reductase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase gene promoters from Leucaena leucocephala, a leguminous tree species, and characterization of tissue-specific activity in transgenic tobacco

AB  - Promoter sequences of a 795 bp cinnamoyl CoA reductase (LlCCR) and 1,882 bp cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (LlCAD) genes were isolated from Leucaena leucocephala, a leguminous tree species by genome walking, and analysed using bioinformatics tools. This revealed presence of cis-elements such as AC-boxes, XYLAT, WRKY, and MYB binding sites in addition to CAAT and TATA boxes. For functional characterization, each of LlCCR and LlCAD promoter sequences were fused to β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, immobilized into pBI101 plasmid, and introduced into tobacco via Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404. Histochemical observations of transgenic lines indicated tissue-specific expression of GUS in the vascular tissues of leaves, stems, and roots. These results demonstrate that GUS expression driven by either LlCCR or LlCAD promoters were involved in lignifying tissues, and more specifically in differentiating xylem cells. This observed tissue-specific expression driven by either LlCCR or LlCAD promoters is sufficient for reducing the lignin content only in vascular tissues, thus overcoming the risks and challenges associated with down-regulation of lignin content in whole plants. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - From an economic perspective, a set of indicators was studied for cattle fattening technologies in Leucaena leucocephala (variety Peru) grazing, with supplementation and without it. The research was developed at the Institute of Animal Science, in systems with lots of 150 animals of the genotypes 3/4 Holstein x 1/4 commercial Zebu and Cuban Charolais: five with natural pasture and CT-115 (Pennisetum purpureum cv.), and two with star grass (Cynodon nlemfuencis). Cost records per treatment were elaborated and the cost/animal, the cost/kg LW, the cost/ha, the cost/$, the benefit/cost (B/C), and the point of equilibrium (kg meat and animals) were calculated. As financial indicators, the gross margin, the gross income and the direct costs per hectare and the profitability and the recovery of the investment (years) were estimated. The American dollar (USD) was used as pattern, to make the analysis of technology transference and the safe of importations. The utilization of the silvopastoral system with leucaena was positive, regardless the handling of inputs and applied systems. Nevertheless, the best indicators corresponded to the non-supplemented systems with lower costs/kg, per ha, animal and LW produced and higher B/C, although the Charolais showed similar indicators, due to the favorable economic response to the application of supplements. The most intensive systems presented the highest gross margins and gross incomes per hectare and higher level of direct costs. The profitability and recovery of investments were favorable to the use of lower inputs. The analysis shows the utility of the use of these indicators to make viable the selection of productive alternatives, the optimization of resources and the potential safe of importations to Cuba.

TI  - The potential influence of plant-based feed supplements on sperm quantity and quality in livestock: A review
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861716655&doi=10.1016%2fj.anireprosci.2012.04.002&partnerID=40&md5=c2db76d4ee789143f4ff5bdec3cd7c52
AB  - The reproductive performance of male livestock is of economic importance, and improving semen quantity and quality, especially for artificial insemination, additionally helps to avoid the loss of valuable genotypes. The review focuses on the impact of oxidative stress on sperm production and quality in livestock, and the potential role of plant based anti-oxidants to control this impact. From scientific reports dealing with livestock, the paper compiles evidence on effective dietary measures affecting sperm production and quality. Where little or no data are available on livestock, it refers to sources regarding other mammals, including man. The review concentrates on the use of distinct plants as feed supplements rather than on ways to treat deficiencies and imbalances in energy or macro- and micronutrients. Feeding of maca (Lepidium meyenii) and khat (Catha edulis) has been shown to positively affect sperm production and quality in animals. Some evidence points to favourable effects of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena pallida), sesbania (Sesbania sesban), pomegranate (Punica granatum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) as well, but studies are either superficial or results are partially contradictory. Finally, the review considers the potential usefulness of medicinal herbs. The list of such plants includes Chinese herbs such as Lycium barbarum, Astralagus membranaceus, Acanthopanacis senticosi, Magnolia officinalis, Cornus officinalis and Psoralea corylifolia and the Indonesian plant Eurycoma longifolia. European candidate plants are Tribulus terrestris and Pendulum murex. Future research should include the screening of other plants, concentrating on the large number of plants rich in metabolites because of their presumed effectiveness. The modes of action often require clarification for the plants with demonstrated effects. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The biological control agent Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) inflicts moderate levels of seed damage on its target, the invasive tree Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae), in the KwaZulu-Natal coastal region of South Africa
PY  - 2012

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae), an agroforestry tree with invasive properties, was targeted for biological control in South Africa. The seed beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was released in 1999 to curb its excessive seed production without negating its beneficial properties. The adult beetles oviposit on the seed pods and loose seeds of L. leucocephala and the hatching larvae enter the seeds and destroy them during their development. Although the beetle has become widely established in South Africa, its contribution to the weed's management is unknown. The aims of this pilot study were to assess: (i) the levels of seed damage inflicted by A. macrophthalmus on L. leucocephala populations and; (ii) the extent to which the endophagous immature stages have recruited native parasitoids. The study was carried out over seven months at three sites in the KwaZulu-Natal coastal region, where L. leucocephala is abundant. Mean seed damage was inconsistent, with considerable variation (262 %) between sites and time of collection. On average, <30 % of available seeds was damaged at each site. Five species of parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) were consistently reared from beetle-damaged seeds, two of which (both Pteromalidae) were most commonly associated with the beetles. Mean mortality resulting from parasitism was similarly inconsistent and variable (122 %) between sites and time of collection. Although parasitism increased with increased seed damage, on average only 79 % of larvae/pupae were parasitized at the three sites. The modest levels of seed damage recorded in this study appear insufficient to regulate populations of L. leucocephala in South Africa.

TI  - Incidence of subclinical toxicity in goats and dairy cows consuming leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) in Thailand
PY  - 2012

AB  - A survey of the leucaena toxicity status in four major goat-producing provinces of Thailand where leucaena is fed as the principal dietary component was conducted. Three adjacent dairy farms in one province where leucaena silage was being fed were also sampled. Urine samples were collected from 63 animals on six goat farms and from 32 cows on three dairy farms. Samples were acidified, cleaned and analysed by high performance liquid chromatography for 3,4-DHP and 2,3-DHP concentrations, using a modified procedure developed at the University of Queensland. Total DHP concentrations varied from 375 to 3357 μg/mL on goat farms, and from 142 to 182 μg/mL on dairy farms. These concentrations are indicative of subclinical toxicity that might cause reduced feed intake and productivity. The impact of high DHP on productivity needs to be further studied because leucaena is a readily available source of high-protein forage for ruminant industries in Thailand. © 2012 CSIRO.

AB  - An in vitro rumen batch culture study was completed to compare effects of common grasses, leguminous shrubs and non-leguminous shrubs used for livestock grazing in Australia and Ghana on CH 4 production and fermentation characteristics. Grass species included Andropodon gayanus, Brachiaria ruziziensis and Pennisetum purpureum. Leguminous shrub species included Cajanus cajan, Cratylia argentea, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Stylosanthes guianensis and non-leguminous shrub species included Annona senegalensis, Moringa oleifera, Securinega virosa and Vitellaria paradoxa. Leaves were harvested, dried at 55°C and ground through a 1 mm screen. Serum bottles containing 500 mg of forage, modified McDougall's buffer and rumen fluid were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 39°C for 24 h. Samples of each forage type were removed after 0, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h of incubation for determination of cumulative gas production. Methane production ammonia concentration and proportions of VFA were measured at 24 h. Concentration of aNDF (g/kg DM) ranged from 671 to 713 (grasses), 377 to 590 (leguminous shrubs) and 288 to 517 (non-leguminous shrubs). After 24 h of in vitro incubation, cumulative gas, CH 4 production, ammonia concentration, proportion of propionate in VFA and IVDMD differed (p<0.05) within each forage type. B. ruziziensis and G sepium produced the highest cumulative gas, IVDMD, total VFA, proportion of propionate in VFA and the lowest A:P ratios within their forage types. Consequently, these two species produced moderate CH 4 emissions without compromising digestion. Grazing of these two species may be a strategy to reduce CH 4 emissions however further assessment in in vivo trials and at different stages of maturity is recommended.

AB  - This study assessed the effect of 150, 50000 and 78000 mg kg-1 of fresh crude oil (FO) and 78456 mg kg-1 of weathered crude oil (WO) on the growth of Brachiaria mutica and Leucaena leucocephala. The variables measured were plant height, dry biomass, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) contents in soil and plant, density of rhizospheric bacteria and fungi, and FO and WO degradation. Statistical differences were found (P ≤ 0.05) in all variables. Leucaena leucocephala was more sensitive to oil toxicity than B. mutica. In L. leucocephala FO caused the death of the plant from the second month, while WO led to a 6-fold reduction in height. The FO had no effect on biomass accumulation of B. mutica but it reduced it in L. leucocephala, whereas WO decreased biomass in both species; N, P and K accumulation decreased in B. mutica in soil with WO and in L. leucocephala in soils with FO and WO. Density of rhizosphere bacteria was inhibited by WO in both species; there were fewer fungi in soil with FO in B. mutica and in soil with WO in L. leucocephala. Degradation of FO and WO was higher in B. mutica rhizosphere soil, so this grass may be an alternative for decontaminating soils polluted with FO and WO.

AB  - Densified feed blocks of wheat straw (64.2%) along with Stylosanthes hamata meal (13.8%), Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (13.8%) and Guar gum waste powder (8.2%) were prepared using densifying machine. Average size of the blocks was 30 cm×33 cm×42 cm and average density of blocks was 323.2 kg/m3. Digestibility trial was conducted after one month feeding on two groups (n=6) of Bhadawari male buffaloes (mean weight 230 ± 19 kg). Group 1 was fed with leaf meal added feed blocks (G1) and group 2 with wheat straw and concentrate in the ratio 60:40 in mesh form as a control (G2). DMI was almost comparable (2.51 vs 2.27 kg/100kg bw) however, the DMD (%) was significantly higher G1 (59.2) compared to G2 (51.4). Digestibility coefficients for OM, CP, NFE, NDF, DCP and TDN followed the trend of DM digestibility in Bhadawari buffaloes. Addition of leaf meal with crop residue significantly improved the nutrient digestibility and nutritive value of feed blocks.

AB  - Seedlings of two Acacia species; Acacia ehrenbergiana (Hayne.) and Acacia tortilis (Forssk.), grown in Dirab Valley (N.24° 24′ 33″, E.46° 39′ 40″), South Riyadh, KSA, were inoculated with four Rhizobium strains; (AER), isolated from nodulated roots of Acacia ehrenbergiana, (ASR) strain isolated from Acacia saligna, (ATR) strain, isolated from Acacia tortilis and (LLR) strain isolated from Leucaena leucocephala to evaluate growth response and ability of such species to form root nodules under salt stress and to obtain an indication of nitrogen fixation potential during two successive seasons. Results demonstrated that, salt concentration affects growth parameters of seedling, root nodulation and nitrogen fixation of Acacia ehrenbergiana (Hayne.) and Acacia tortilis (Forssk.). Increasing of salt concentration led to decrease growth, nodulation and nitrogen fixation. The harmful concentration of salt was 3% NaCl, since Rhizobium strains were affected by salt stress in the soil, yet the most salinity-tolerant strain was AER followed by strain ASR and the least tolerant strain of salinity was LLR. Acacia ehrenbergiana displayed the highest tolerance of salt stress than Acacia tortilis. Our experiment suggested that the inoculated legume trees with salinity-tolerant Rhizobium strains in the nurseiy should establish an effective nitrogen fixing symbiosis, which may be more tolerant of salinity after outplanting. It has been emphasized that the selection of legume host from highly saline or non saline habitats appeared to be the most important factor governing compatible Rhizobium strains to nodulation and N2 fixation under salinity hazards. © IDOSI Publications, 2011.

AB  - The evaluation of nonconventional water resources on seed germination and seedling growth performance at early growth stages is still in progress, especially on multipurpose forest trees. This study was designed to test the effect of four water qualities [treated wastewater, industrial, gray and distilled water (control)] on germination and early seedling vigor of Leucaena leucocephala. The results showed that germination was not significantly affected by different water qualities. Seed germination reached a maximum after 17, 14, 14 and 21 days under gray, industrial, treated wastewater and control irrigation, respectively. The highest mean of shoot length was scored under gray water irrigation. Likewise, the highest mean of root length was scored under control, which was not significant from gray water. The means of shoot fresh and dry weight were the highest under treated wastewater. The means of root fresh weight and root dry weight were not significantly different under water treatments. The shoot/root ratios under all water qualities treatments were significantly higher than the control. Growth performance was in progress with no mortality during 21 days of growth. The best nonconventional water quality alternatives based on cleanness, nutrients and toxicity are the gray, treated wastewater and industrial water, respectively. © 2012 CEERS, IAU.

AB  - Biomass is an important source of renewable energy which is derived from the living mechanism such as photosynthesis of plant due to the lower contents of sulfur and nitrogen in the biomass. Pyrolysis is a technology that can directly produce a liquid fuel from biomass which can be readily stored or transported. However, many researches have reported the negative properties of the bio-oils compare with the conventional fuel oil. The undesirable properties of the bio-oils included low heating value, low pH value, incompatibility with conventional fuels, high viscosity, and chemical instability. These undesirable properties of the bio-oils are mainly brought about by the high oxygen content in the biomass. On the other hand, it is known that the oxygen content in the biomass could be reduced by the torrefaction at the temperatures below 300°C. So, in this study we try to upgrade the biomass first by torrefaction at the temperatures below 300°C. It was found that the oxygen content of Leucaena leucocephala decreased from 46.2 wt% to 36.7 wt% when torrefy at 303°C whereas the torrefied lecaena yields decreased with the increase in torrefaction temperature. Then, the torrefied leucaena will be pyrolysed at 550°C to produce bio-oils. The bio-ols were fractionated into light oil and heavy oil fractions which were analyzed by GC-MS to examine the effect of fraction on the bio-oils properties. It was found that the acetic acid and furans were decreased in light oil fraction with the increase in torrefaction temperature. The pH value of bio-oils was slightly increased that was consistent with decreasing of acetic acid in light oil fraction. These results indicated that torrefaction process could improve bio-oils properties prior pyrolysis process. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the tolerance of Cupriavidus necator strains to zinc, cadmium, copper and lead, as well as to determine the symbiotic efficiency of the most tolerant ones in legume species suited for use in revegetation. Tolerance was evaluated in LB medium supplemented with 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15 mmol L-1 of ZnSO4.7H2O, CdSO4.8H2O, CuSO4.5H2O and PbCl2, respectively, in comparison to a control without metal. The symbiotic efficiency of the four C. necator most metal-tolerant strains (UFLA02-71, UFLA02-73, UFLA01-659 and UFLA01-663) was determined, and these strains were inoculated in the species: Leucaena leucocephala, Enterolobium contortisiliquum, Acacia mangium, Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, M. pudica, M. pigra and M. acutistipula. Leucaena leucocephala, M. pudica and M. caesalpiniifolia and the strains UFLA02-71 and UFLA01-659, which presented the high symbiotic efficiency, were evaluated in pots with soil. UFLA02-71 provided increments of 870% in shoot dry matter of M. caesalpiniifolia, and UFLA01-659 provided 885% in M. pudica and 924% in L. leucocephala. These strains should be assessed for potential use in programs to restore degraded areas, since they showed high efficiency in nitrogen fixation and were competitive with indigenous rhizobia populations, besides being highly tolerant to heavy metals.

AB  - Torrefaction is the thermal treatment techniques performed at relatively low temperature (<60; 300°C) in an inert atmosphere, which aims to improve the fuel energy density and the fuel grindability. In this study, woody biomass (Leucaena leucocephala) was torrefied at various temperatures and holding times and the pyrolysis behaviors of the torrefied wood was examined in detail by using TG-MS technique. It was found that the carbon content and the calorific value of the torrefied leucaena increased significantly when increase the temperature and holding time during the torrefaction. From the TG-MS analysis, the pyrolysis behaviors of the torrefied leucaena were significantly different from that of the raw leucaena. The char yield at 800°C for the torrefied leucaena was increased when increasing the holding time during the torrefaction. On the other hand, the tar yield during the pyrolysis decreased significantly with the increase in the holding time during the torrefaction. Through the results from the TG-MS analysis, it was concluded that the structure of leucaena was changed by the torrefaction at temperature below 275 oC and the cross-linking reactions occurred during the pyrolysis resulting in increase in char yields and decrease in tar yields. It was also suggested that the longer the holding time during the torrefaction, the more the cross-linking reactions proceed during the pyrolysis. The results obtained from the study provide the basic information for the pyrolyser and/or gasifier design by using torrefied biomass as a fuel. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Recently developing bioinspired super-hydrophobic surfaces to achieve self-cleaning properties has been driving numerous researches. However, hydrophilicity is one of the most important features of garment comfort. Therefore, accomplishing self-cleaning and stain repellency on hydrophilic surfaces would be a high topic of interest. This research is concerned with wettability mechanism; static and dynamic study of contact angle through water droplet absorption on the multiple scale nano-roughness covered by different weight ratio of oppositely charged inorganic nanoparticles and amino-functionalized polysiloxane. The results revealed that the second layer of the resin formed on the surface can show an amphiphilic hybrid block copolymer-like feature whose dual action can be intensified during water droplet absorption by the created multiple size nano-roughness. This unique structure can create a stain repellent but hydrophilic surface with exceptional advantages. The mechanism has been deeply discussed according to the evidence on droplet edge interfacial energy changes as a driving force to overcome meta-stable Cassie state on the multiple size nano-roughness with amphiphilic feature. A lotus-like nano-roughness has been also observed on the SEM micrographs. Based on a statistically approached experimental design, the effect of variant factors on droplet absorption time, static, advancing, receding contact angles and self-cleaning properties has been mathematically modeled according to the response surface methodology (RSM). © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the discriminate use of plant chemicals and their resultant negative impact on the environment, researchers are interested in monitoring plant behavior as modified by various nonchemical influences such as magnetic fields. A pot experiment was designed to assess the growth potential of Albizia procera Roxb. (Sufed Sirin) and Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (Ipil Ipil) seedlings, established from seeds exposed to a magnetic field (MF) of 75 millitesla for 3 different time intervals, 5 min, 10 min, and 15 min respectively. After the seeds were exposed to a MF of 75 mT for 15 min, A. procera plants showed 49% more germination than in the control (41%), whereas L. leucocephala plants gained 37% more germination in the same treatment. A. procera had maximum plant height (13.1 cm) when seeds were exposed to a MF of 75 mT for 15 min, while the height gained by the control was only 7.1 cm. Similarly, L. leucocephala gained maximum plant height (17.8 cm) when seeds were treated with MF for 15 min, i.e. 137% greater than the height gained from nontreated seeds (7.5 cm). Seed exposure to MFs also resulted in higher collar diameter in both plants. In high-MF-treated A. procera (18.6 cm) seedlings, root length was 3 times longer than in the control (6.5 cm); MF-treated L. leucocephala seedlings gained maximum (63% longer) root length (18.9 cm), as well. A. procera had its maximum root-to-shoot ratio (R/S) (1.9) in the seedlings treated with low MF (5 min), whereas L. leucocephala had its maximum R/S (1.6) in nontreated seeds. Seeds exposed to MF for 5 min resulted in minimum R/S (0.9). The results clearly suggested that by increasing the time intervals for seed exposure to the fixed MF of 75 mT, the sowed seeds of both species showed higher growth rate.

AB  - Objective: to evaluate voluntary intake of four forage species by collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) under confinement. Methods: four peccaries underwent a consumption test to assess their preference among four forages (Leucaena leucocephala, Guazuma ulmifolia, Brosimum alicastrum and Pennisetum purpureum). The experiment was divided into two phases. The first consisted of an adaptation period of 4 days during which they were offered 1 kg of each forage in different feeders for 4 hours, then removing and weighing the remaining forage to determine consumption. The voluntary intake test was assessed in the second phase using a Latin square design (4x4). Forage intake was analyzed using the Statgraphics 5.1 software. Results: highly significant differences (p <0.01) between consumption of each forage were observed, being G. ulmifolia the most consumed (170.18 g dry matter), followed by L. leucocephala, and B. alicastrum (132.19 and 98.37 g dry matter, respectively). The least consumed was P. purpureum (21.65 g dry matter). Conclusions: considering its high consumption and moisture content, G. ulmifolia could be successfully used as cut fodder for peccaries under confinement.

Non-irradiated feathers demonstrate pronounced Cassie-Baxter (" fakir" ) wetting characterized by high apparent contact angles and low sliding angles. Plasma-irradiated feathers are superhydrophilic. Plasma treatment does not affect the barbs/barbules keratin-built network constituting pigeon pennae, but it changes the Young, advancing and receding angles of the tissue. The mechanism of wetting transition is discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study, based on different investigative documents and analytical methods, elucidates spatial distribution of habitats for major invasive exotic plants, Leucaena leucocephala, in Taiwan. Results show that Leucaena leucocephala is most harmful to broad-leaved trees and its invasion directly relates to changes in the physical environment. Leucaena leucocephala can bloom and bear fruits all year round and during the period of seeds sprouting and saplings, the invasion varies greatly among different soil types. Leucaena leucocephala prefers weakly acidic soil, though it grows well with other soil textures and nutrients as well. The average spreading rate of Leucaena leucocephala is 3.55 ha year-1 on abandoned farm land calculated from the aerial photographs taken in 1982, 1992, 2003, and 2007.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, locally known as "petai belalang", is widely used in Malaysia as livestock forage, reforestation material, as well as furniture and construction timber. This study investigated the properties of strand from L. leucocephala wood. Beside no study has been carried out on the strand properties of this species to date. Strand properties help to support the suitability and effective use of raw materials in wood composite. The main objective was to determine the strand properties of L. leucocephala as a raw material in the manufacturing of oriented strand board (OSB) under laboratory conditions. The study also aimed to determine the recovery and effect of age and strand size on bulk density, and to evaluate the effects of age and tree portion on strand properties of L. leucocephala from eight and sixteen-year-old trees. A total of 28 trees used in this study were randomly selected. Stranding process separated the fines and sorted the strands into 4 sizes; S0 (25 to 3.2 mm), S1 (19 to 12.7 mm), S2 (12.7 to 6.3 mm) and S3 (6.3 to 3.2 mm). Strand sizes of more than 25 mm and below 3.2 mm were rejected. Results showed that the recovery of strands from eight and sixteen-yearold wood was approximately 75.01 and 70.15%, respectively. Age and strand size were found to affect bulk density significantly. Strand size of S3 from sixteen-year-old gave the highest bulk density (436 g/L) while the lowest bulk density (321 g/L) was shown by strand size of S1 from eight-year-old. The correlation analysis revealed that bulk density showed a positive correlation with increase in age (r = 0.69*). Bulk density also showed a positive correlation with decrease in strand size from S0 to S3 (r = 0.43*). On average, strands from eight-year-old wood (65.90 mm) are longer than that of sixteen-year-old wood (57.64 mm). The average strand thickness from eight and sixteen-year-old wood was 0.90 and 1.00 mm, respectively. The interaction effects of age and strand size also showed significant interaction in area, rectangularity, slenderness ratio and aspect ratio. ©2011 Academic Journals.

TI  - Charcoal ash and volatile matter effects on soil properties and plant growth in an acid ultisol

AB  - There is a growing interest in converting organic wastes to charcoal for use as a sustainable soil amendment with a potential to improve soil productivity and sequester C. Three consecutive greenhouse experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of charcoal with different ash and volatile matter (VM) contents on soil properties and maize (Zea mays) growth and to evaluate the effect of time on charcoal performance. Five charcoal amendments (high-VM corncob, low-VM corncob, Kiawe, Binchotan, and a gasification charcoal of Leucaena leucocephala) applied at a 2.5% (wt/wt) rate were compared with a zero-charcoal control with and without fertilization. Only the gasification charcoal significantly increased maize growth without fertilization. The low-VM corncob charcoal with fertilization significantly increased maize growth by 164% compared with the fertilized control in the first planting cycle. Maize growth in the high-VM corncob charcoal supplemented with fertilizer treatment was significantly lower than that of the fertilizer-alone treatment in the first planting cycle. The negative effect of the high-VM charcoal on the fertilizer was caused by bioavailable carbon in the charcoal, which increased soil microbial activity and could have caused N immobilization. Both the beneficial and detrimental effects of charcoal did not persist beyond the first planting cycle, suggesting that charcoal impacts are temporary. Whereas charcoal ash and VM content seem to be important parameters for predicting charcoal behavior in the short-term, more research is needed to examine a broader spectrum of feedstocks exposed to varying thermal treatments.

TI  - Cloning, characterization and impact of up- and down-regulating subabul cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) gene on plant growth and lignin profiles in transgenic tobacco
PY  - 2012

AB  - Both cDNA including 5′UTR and 3′UTR and genomic clones of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) were isolated and characterized from a pulp-yielding leguminous tree Leucaena leucocephala (LlCAD1). The deduced amino acid sequence shared high identity with orthologous sequences of Acacia mangium × Acacia auriculiformis (83%), Medicago sativa (83%), Nicotiana tabaccum (83%) and Araliacordata (81%). Full length cDNA contained 78 bases of 5′UTR and 283 bases of 3′UTR, while the genomic clone contained 5 exons and 4 introns. Western blot analysis revealed elevated expression of LlCAD1 in seedling roots and shoots compared to leaves. Sense and antisense CAD tobacco transgenics showed increased and reduced CAD activity accompanied by a change in monomeric lignin composition. Histochemical staining of lignin in down-regulated plants suggested an increase in aldehyde units and a decrease in S/G ratio. Down-regulation of CAD resulted in accumulation of syringic, ferulic, p-coumaric and sinapic acids compared to untransformed controls. These observations were validated by anatomical studies of down-regulated transgenic stems which showed thin walled, elongated phloem and xylem fibres, accompanied by a reduction in the density of vessel elements and amount of secondary xylem when compared to untransformed plants. Furthermore, Klason lignin analysis of CAD antisense transgenics showed 7-32% reduced lignin and normal phenotype as compared to untransformed plants. Such a reduction was not noticed in up-regulated transgenics. These results demonstrate a unique opportunity to explore the significant role that down-regulation of CAD gene plays in reducing lignin content thereby offering potential benefits to the pulp and paper industry. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

PY  - 2011
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863078147&partnerID=40&md5=f472a54b1c6a6a6ea1672fc7707ab128
AB  - Four adult male sheep of local breed each with mean body weight 29.0±4.03 and 22.32±2.14 kg were fed Cenchrus ciliaris-Leucaena leucocephala (CC-LL) and Cenchrus ciliaris-Grewia optiva (CC-GO) diets separately. Grass (CC) and tree leaves (LL and GO) were fed in 75:25 proportions, respectively for 90 days on each diet. Rumen liquor samples were drawn at 0 and 4 h post feeding twice at 60 and 90 days feeding on each diet to enumerate the rumen microbes and enzymes and for water kinetics once at 90 days feeding. Total protozoa, entodiniomorphs and holotrichs counts were comparable in rumen liquor of sheep on CC-LL and CC-GO diets. Sheep rumen liquor had similar activity/number of total viable bacteria, cellulolytic and amylolytic bacteria on both diets, while proteolytic bacteria activity was higher (P<0.05) on CC-GO diet. Entodiniomorphs and holotrichs constituted 80.05 & 19.95% and 78.5 & 21.5 % of total protozoa on CC-LL and CC-GO diet, respectively. In rumen liquor Isotricha and entodinium occurrence (%) was highest, and that of polyplastron and ophryoscolex was least. Rumen liquor of sheep fed CC-GO had (P>0.05) higher glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Sheep rumen liquor had higher (P<0.05) cellulase activity and outflow rate (l/d) on CC- LL diet. Inclusion of GO at 25 % level in grass based diet of sheep produced response similar to LL on microbes number, enzyme activity and water kinetics except rumen dilution rate.

AB  - Superhydrophobic nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (alumina) surfaces were prepared using treatment with vapor-phase hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). Nanoporous alumina substrates were first made using a two-step anodization process. Subsequently, a repeated modification procedure was employed for efficient incorporation of the terminal methyl groups of HMDS to the alumina surface. Morphology of the surfaces was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, showing hexagonally ordered circular nanopores with approximately 250 nm in diameter and 300 nm of interpore distances. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance analysis showed the presence of chemically bound methyl groups on the HMDS-modified nanoporous alumina surfaces. Wetting properties of these surfaces were characterized by measurements of the water contact angle which was found to reach 153.2 ± 2°. The contact angle values on HMDS-modified nanoporous alumina surfaces were found to be significantly larger than the average water contact angle of 82.9 ± 3° on smooth thin film alumina surfaces that underwent the same HMDS modification steps. The difference between the two cases was explained by the Cassie-Baxter theory of rough surface wetting. © 2011 Tasaltin et al.

TI  - Effects of condensed tannins from Leucaena on methane production, rumen fermentation and populations of methanogens and protozoa in vitro
PY  - 2011
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80053053708&doi=10.1016%2fj.anifeedsci.2011.07.004&partnerID=40&md5=b78783d355b1c9dc34efa83fcadec499
AB  - Different levels of purified condensed tannins (CT) extracted from Leucaena leucocephala hybrid-Rendang (LLR) were investigated for their effects on CH4 production, rumen fermentation parameters such as pH, dry matter (DM) degradability, N disappearance and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, as well as on populations of rumen methanogenic archaea and protozoa in vitro. Purified CT concentrations of 0 (control), 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30mg, and 500mg of oven dried guinea grass (Panicum maximum) with 40ml of buffered rumen fluid were incubated for 24h using an in vitro gas production procedure. Total gas (ml/g DM) decreased at a decreasing rate (linear P<0.01; quadratic P<0.05) with increased levels of CT inclusion. CH4 production (ml/g DM) decreased at a decreasing rate (linear P<0.01; quadratic P<0.01) with increasing levels of CT. Total VFA concentration (mmol/L) decreased at a decreasing rate (linear P<0.01; quadratic P<0.01) with increasing CT inclusions. In vitro DM degradation and N disappearance declined linearly (P<0.01) with increasing levels of CT. Estimates of rumen methanogenic archaea and protozoa populations using microbiological methods and real-time PCR assay showed linear reductions in total methanogens (P<0.01) and total protozoa (P<0.01) with increasing levels of CT. Methanogens in the order Methanobacteriales also declined, but with quadratic and cubic aspects. Results suggest that CT from LLR at a relatively low level of 15mg of CT/500mg DM reduce CH4 production by 47%, with only 7% reduction in degradation of feed DM. However, higher CT inclusions, while further reducing CH4 emissions, have substantive negative effects on DM digestibility. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..

TI  - Utilization of Moringa oleifera fodder combinations with Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium fodders by West African Dwarf goats
PY  - 2011
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80053158570&doi=10.3923%2fijar.2011.607.619&partnerID=40&md5=44d1b0534776e45261887b9165768360
AB  - Unlike Leucaena (LEU) and Gliricidia (GLI) fodders and in spite of its globally acclaimed nutritive values, Moringa (MO) fodder is yet to receive adequate research attention in Nigeria as a protein supplement for ruminants. The nutritional synergies between equal but separate combinations of MO with LEU and GLI fodders, respectively, relative to a sole MO fodder were evaluated with West African Dwarf (WAD) goats. Three male WAD goats, weighing 10±1 kg, were used in a feed intake and nutrient digestibility study consisting of three experimental periods of 24 days each. Three experimental diets; 50 MO:50 LEU, 50 MO:50 GLI and 100 MO were investigated using a 3*3 Latin Square within a complete randomized design. Performance indices were Dry Matter Intake (DMI), nutrient digestibility, nitrogen utilization and Relative Feed Value (RFVs). DMI and nutrient digestibility values were high with no (p>0.05) diet effects. Nitrogen in the three diets was well utilized. It was however better (p<0.05) utilized in 100 MO with minimal losses in faeces (5.47%) and urine (14.15%), leading to better nitrogen balance and retention. RFVs were generally high but significantly (p<0.05) highest for 100 MO. Based on the RFVs, 50 MO:50 LEU and 50 MO:50 GLI fodder combinations appeared promising as protein supplements for WAD goats, with a better prospect of utilization of 50 MO:50 GLI based on nitrogen utilization. The fodder combination will also allow for an optimal utilization of the available moringa fodder as its availability is still limited in Nigeria. © 2011 Academic Journals Inc.

TI  - Prevalence of mimosine and DHP toxicity in cattle grazing Leucaena leucocephala pastures in Queensland, Australia
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858785695&doi=10.1071%2fAN11236&partnerID=40&md5=b37758bdd7ebc01ffbcd2b2b40c46405
AB  - A postal survey of the level of awareness of leucaena toxicity and an on-farm study of the toxicity status of Queensland cattle herds grazing leucaena were conducted to investigate the prevalence of mimosine and dihydroxypyridine (DHP) toxicity in Queensland. In total, 195 of 356 graziers surveyed responded to the postal survey. Sixty-three percent had inoculated their cattle with in vitro Synergistes jonesii inoculum (produced in an anaerobic fermenter) and 30% of these had inoculated more than once. The remainder used inappropriate procedures. Many graziers (43%) had occasionally observed toxicity symptoms of hair loss and poor animal growth rates. In the on-farm study, the toxicity status of 385 animals in 44 individually managed herds on 36 properties was determined by urine analysis of mimosine and DHP concentrations. No animals were experiencing mimosine toxicity, based on low concentrations of this compound found in the urine. Using the criterion that average herd urine concentrations of DHP>100 μg/mL was indicative of subclinical toxicity, 48% of herds were exposed to subclinical toxicity due to dominant 3,4-DHP (21%) or dominant 2,3-DHP (27%) toxicity; many of these herds had been inoculated with S. jonesii and were thought to be protected. The finding that 27% of herds were excreting high concentrations of 2,3-DHP was unexpected. Statistical analysis of herd-management data revealed that the method used by graziers to inoculate their herds was significantly (P<0.05) but weakly linked to herd protection status. It was concluded that subclinical 3,4-DHP and 2,3-DHP toxicity remains a problem in Queensland and is likely to be limiting animal production in a significant number of cattle grazing leucaena-grass pastures. © 2012 CSIRO.

AB  - The seed oils from Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis africana were evaluated for their chemical composition, mineral metals and fatty acid composition. The mineral metal and proximate composition of their seeds were also checked. The oil yield of the seed of L. leucocephala was found to be 6.80 ± 0.71 g/100 g of seed while that of P. africana was, 4.22 ± 0.40 g/100 g of seed. The crude protein was higher in L. leucocephala (45.40 ± 0.60 g/100 g of seed) than P. africana (40.20 ± 0.80 g/100 g of seed). The moisture content was also found lower in L. leucocephala (2.10 ± 0.20 g/100 g of seed) than in P. africana (3.00 ± 0.40 g/100 g of seed). K was found to be most abundant in the seed as well as the oils of L. leucocephala and P. africana while Cd had the least concentration in both seeds and oils. The iodine value of L. leucocephala was 113.00 ± 2.10 g/100 g while that of P. africana was 118.30 ± 1.00 g/100 g. Neutral lipids were the dominant lipid class in both L. leucocephala and P. africana. Linoleic acid was the dominant fatty acid (CI8:2) ini. leucocephala while oleic (CI8:1) was the dominant fatty acid found in P. africana.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a tropical tree-legume, known for its high level of tolerance to various stress conditions including drought and diseases. We hypothesised that leucaena contains a specific set of genes for tolerance to various abiotic and biotic stresses, which may be either absent or not expressed in other legumes that are susceptible to these stress conditions. Interspecies suppression subtractive hybridisation (iSSH) was used to identify some leucaena-specific genes using cDNAs from leucaena and Acacia confusa (acacia) as the tester and driver, respectively. Ninety-six leucaena genes showing homologies to various plant genes with known functions and 46 other genes encoding hypothetical proteins (hyps) were identified. Twenty-two genes encoded various stress-related proteins including chitinase, PR-10 protein, type 2 metallothionein, thaumatin-like protein, germin-like protein (GLP), molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (MCSU), aldehyde dehydrogenase, cysteine proteinase and Kunitz trypsin inhibitor. Conserved domain (CD) and position-specific iterative (PSI)-BLAST analyses predicted the possible functions of 15 hyps. The possible functions of the remaining hyps were predicted on the basis of various linear motifs. Six stress-related genes and 22 hyps were identified that expressed at higher levels under drought conditions in leucaena. The stress-related genes of leucaena identified through iSSH provide a foundation for future studies of molecular bases of stress tolerance in leucaena. These genes may also serve as a useful source of stress-tolerant genes for crop improvement in the future. © 2011 Association of Applied Biologists.

AB  - We report on our study of the static and dynamic wetting property of hydrophobic surfaces with micro- and dual micro/nano-scale structures. Simulations based on the lattice Boltzmann method showed that the apparent contact angle of water droplets on hydrophobic surfaces with micro-scale structures increases as solid area decreases, whereas dual micro/nano-scale structures not only increase surface hydrophobicity but also greatly stabilize the Cassie state of droplets. Droplets falling on a superhydrophobic surface distort and, depending of free energy, sometimes bounced on the surface before finally adhering to the surface. These phenomena are in agreement with experimental observations. Simulated results also show that micro/nano-scale surface structures can increase droplet rebound height, which depends on static apparent contact angle. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Chemical composition, microbial rumen fermentation, energetic values and degradation of some Saudi Arabia sub-tropical browses were investigated in comparison with alfalfa hay as a high quality roughage using Hohenheim gas test in vitro. A gas test technique was performed using buffered rumen fluid collected from three rumen fistulated sheep. Cumulative gas production was recorded at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h of incubation in vitro. The investigated sub-tropical plants were blue panic (Panicum antidotale), moringa (Moringa peregrina), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), prosopis (Prosopis juliflora), casuarina (Casuarina glauca) and acacia (Acacia saligna). The sub-tropical plants were collected at the dry season in Saudi Arabia. Alfalfa and leucaena plants had the highest crude protein (CP) content, while the blue panic and moringa had the lowest value. The ether extract (EE) content of moringa and casuarina plants was 5.4 and 3.0%, respectively. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were higher in blue panic, acacia and moringa, while the prosopis and casuarina plants showed the lowest content of the fiber constituents. The secondary compounds analysis showed negligible contents of these feeds for total phenol (TP), total tannins (TT) and condensed tannins (CT) except moringa plant.The potential gas production was highest (p<0.05) for prosopis, alfalfa and blue panic plants, while the moringa plant recorded the lowest gas production. Leucaena, casuarina and moringa plants had the longest lag time (L, h-1) and lowest rate of gas production (μ h-1). The longest L value (2.339 and 1.95 h-1) was noted with leucaena and casuarina plants, while prosopis plant showed the short L value (0.617 h-1). There were wide variations among investigated plants in rumen fermentation characteristics, degradation and energetic values.The ranking order of the investigated plants on the basis of their true degradation of dry and organic matter was prosopis>leucaena>casuarina>blue panic>moringa>acacia. Concentration of NH3-N was high (p<0.05) in prosopis, blue panic and alfalfa hay, while in moringa plant appeared the low concentration (26.0 mg/100 g buffered rumen fluid) of NH3-N. The prosopis showed the highest (p<0.05) volatile fatty acids concentration. In conclusion, significant variations in in vitro fermentation and degradation were observed among different browse species collected from Saudia Arabia through the dry season. The results suggest that prosopis, leucaena and blue panic plants might be promising alternative feed resources and it could be incorporated in ruminants feed mixtures to replace conventional roughage sources (alfalfa) without major problems.

AB  - Degraded sites like mine spoils on hillslopes are characterized by poor soil physico-chemical environments and instability. Reclamation of such areas using low cost bioengineering and vegetative methods were carried out in an abandoned limestone mine in the lower western Indian Himalayas and the impact of these measures on vegetation diversity, secondary succession and growth of seeded Acacia catechu Willd. after two decades of protection are reported in this paper. Results reveal that introduction of fast growing leguminous species affected species diversity and hampered the regeneration and growth of native vegetation, due to the dense shade of the over-storey component. Species diversity (H') levels increased with the opening of the canopy at different elevations, with the highest diversity (1·624) being recorded on the hilltop with Acacia catechu and Wedlandia exserta dominating the area. Enumeration of various species in the growth stages indicated a large population in the pole stage followed by tree and sapling stage indicating scattered regeneration mostly by 1-2 species. Tree associations in the lower, middle and upper reaches were of Leucaena leucocephala-A. catechu, A. catechu-Boehemeria rugulosa and A. catechu-W. exserta, respectively. Seeded A. catechu plants now in the tree stage have attained an average height of 5·5m and dbh of 10·44cm with an average wood volume of 0·027m 3 in a period of 16-21 years. At current prices of heartwood (US $435 per m 3) of A. catechu which is used in the manufacture of 'kattha', the investments made two decades ago (US$ 13043) in the rehabilitation of the limestone mine are fairly justified. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..

TI  - Soil-root shear strength properties of some slope plants

AB  - Rapid development in hilly areas in Malaysia has become a trend that put a stress to the sloping area. It reduces the factor of safety by reducing the resistant force and therefore leads to slope failure. Vegetation plays a big role in reinforcement functions via anchoring the soils and forms a binding network within the soil layer that tied the soil masses together. In this research, three plant species namely Acacia mangium, Dillenia suffruticosa and Leucaena leucocephala were assessed in term of their soil-root shear strength properties. Our results showed that Acacia mangium had the highest shear strength values, 30.4 kPa and 50.2 kPa at loads 13.3 kPa and 24.3 kPa, respectively. Leucaena leucocephala showed the highest in cohesion factor, which was almost double the value in those of Dillenia suffruticosa and Acacia mangium. The root profile analysis indicated Dillenia suffruticosa exhibited the highest values in both root length density and root volume, whilst Leucaena leucocephala had the highest average of root diameter.

TI  - Methane yields from Brahman cattle fed tropical grasses and legumes

AB  - In the national greenhouse inventory, methane emissions from the Australian tropical beef herd are derived from cattle fed two diets. In the experiments reported here, methane production was measured by open-circuit gas exchange from 13 Brahman cattle offered 22 diets from combinations of five tropical grass species and five legumes, with a minimum of three steers per diet. All diets were offered daily ad libitum, with the exception of three legume diets fed without grass and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) mixed with grass, which were offered at 15 g dry matter per kg liveweight. Diets were fed as long-chopped dried hay, with the exception of leucaena, which was harvested and fed within 2 days. For the data from cattle fed diets of grass and grass mixed with legumes, methane production could be predicted as 19.6 g/kg forage dry matter intake (residual standard deviation 12.3). Observed methane yields were not predictable from a stoichiometry, which used volatile fatty acid proportions in rumen fluid. Mean methane emission rates across all diets were equivalent to 8.6-13.4% of digestible energy intake, and 5.0-7.2% of gross energy intake. The latter values are comparable to IPCC (2006) recommendations (5.5-7.5%) for large ruminants fed low-quality crop residues and by-products. Methane yields per unit of ingested dry matter or digested organic matter were variable across diets but were related to digestibility and contents of fibre and protein. These results constitute a significant downward revision of the methane emissions attributable to the northern Australian beef herd grazing tropical pastures. © 2012 CSIRO.

AB  - Two experiments in vitro were conducted to evaluate four Egyptian forage legume browses, i.e., leaves of prosopis (Prosopis juliflora), acacia (Acacia saligna), atriplex (Atriplex halimus), and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), in comparison with Tifton (Cynodon sp.) grass hay for their gas production, methanogenic potential, and ruminal fermentation using a semi-automatic system for gas production (first experiment) and for ruminai and post ruminai protein degradability (second experiment). Acacia and leucaena showed pronounced methane inhibition compared with Tifton, while prosopis and leucaena decreased the acetate:propionate ratio (P<0.01). Acacia and leucaena presented a lower (P<0.01) ruminai NH3-N concentration associated with the decreasing (P<0.01) ruminai protein degradability. Leucaena, however, showed higher (P<0.01) intestinal protein digestibility than acacia. This study suggests that the potential methanogenic properties of leguminous browses may be related not only to tannin content, but also to other factors.

AB  - Bionomic data usually hold the key for understanding the life history of the target insect species. Here, we provide morphological characteristics of different larval instars of Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer), a leucaena bruchine beetle species that is a potential biocontrol agent for the notoriously invasive plant Leucaena leucocephala. The scanning electron micrographs of the head capsule, antenna, clypeolabrum, maxilla, labium, leg, spiracle, and anus of the larval stage of A. macrophthalmus also are provided for the first time for this species, with most of the traits reflecting the taxonomic placement of A. macrophthalmus in the genus Acanthoscelides. Successive instars are determined accurately by using a model of the distribution of the width of the larval head capsule. Therefore, the data generated from this study represent baseline information for further biological control programs involving A. macrophthalmus. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.

AB  - Through experiments in standard runoff plots, this paper studied effects of leucaena leucocephala hedgerow and vetiver hedgerow on bulk density, particle distribution and nutrient loss of the surface soil (the soil depth was 0-20 cm) of sloping farmland in the purple soil area, Sichuan, China. Results showed that: (1) the two hedgerows can reduce soil bulk density, and vetiver hedgerow had a bigger decline of 12 percent. (2) in plots with hedgerows, silt and clay enriched in the bottom and middle of slopes, and the increment of silt or clay of vetiver hedgerow plot was bigger that of leucaena leucocephala hedgerow plot. (3) on intercepting soil particles, the two hedgerows showed as sand>silt>clay. (4) the two hedgerows had a better conservation effect on total nitrogen and total potassium. (5) on total nitrogen, available phosphorus and total potassium, vetiver hedgerow's effects were stronger than leucaena leucocephala hedgerow's; on organic matter, alkalined-nitrogen, total phosphorus and available potassium, leucaena leucocephala hedgerow's effects were stronger than vetiver hedgerow's. (6) in plots with hedgerows, organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and available potassium showed an obvious enrichment in slope bottom and in the front of hedgerow. Therefore, increasing the amount of nitrogenous fertilizer and reducing the amount of potash fertilizer were important in this area. And strengthening soil fertilities of slope top and portions faraway from hedgerow were also important. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - In this study, we have demonstrated that different wetting behavior of regular pillar-like patterned PDMS can be achieved by controlling the mixing ratio of polydimethylsiloxane's (PDMS's) prepolymer base and curing agent. The dynamic contact angles and sliding angles of water droplet on these patterned surfaces are carefully measured. It is found that the experimental results for PDMS substrates prepared at the mixing ratio of base to curing agent 10:1 are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the Wenzel model and Cassie model. However, for the PDMS substrates prepared at the mixing ratio of base to curing agent 20:1, the wetting behavior would change due to the deformation of the structure - collapse of pillars due to the softness. In addition, the dynamic phenomenon of the impregnating process of water penetrating into the pillars is observed through the optical microscope when a water droplet is placed on the regular pillar-like patterned PDMS substrates prepared at the mixing ratio of base to curing agent 20:1. The pillars are pushed down by water flow one after another like dominoes. The flow pattern of the impregnating process is discussed. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - A combination of forage species with different responses to drought can increase year-round productivity in seasonally dry silvopastoral systems

AB  - In seasonally dry environments maintaining year-round production of silvopastoral systems can be challenging due to drought effects on vegetation. Different tree species native to dry forests may show contrasting strategies to deal with drought, which could impact silvopastoral productivity. We assessed the differential effect of drought on seedlings of five tree species from a dry tropical forest with high forage potential. The species were subjected to three irrigation schemes (well-watered, mild drought, severe drought) in order to evaluate the effect of water stress on 12 growth and morpho-physiological traits involving above and below ground responses. The species comprised four species of the family Fabaceae (legumes) Albizia lebbeck, Leucaena leucocephala, Piscidia piscipula, and Lysiloma latisiliquum and one of the family Sterculiaceae, Guazuma ulmifolia. This one was the most productive species when well-watered, with the highest forage potential due to high leaf area, leaf mass and fast growth rates. This species was also the most vulnerable to drought, reducing leaf area and other growth parameters dramatically. In contrast, L. latisiliquum showed low leaf area and leaf mass, but was highly resistant to drought. An intermediate species was P. piscipula, which was the most productive of the legume species and exhibited adjustment mechanisms to drought which allowed reduced leaf excision during the severe drought. We propose that combining species with contrasting mechanisms in response to drought can promote year-round productivity in seasonally dry environments. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a woody species widely used in silvopastoral systems as a source of forage and other benefits associated with nitrogen fixation, shade for cattle and firewood. Consequently, leucaena has become an important component within silvopastoral systems in the central Andean region of Colombia in the framework of strategies developed for cattle environmental reconversion. Benefits associated with nitrogen fixation have attributed to theses systems, however information is currently scarce, especially in Colombia. In order to assess the changes on leaf and soil nitrogen in the early stages of leucaena development, we established an experiment. The experiment was carried out in the municipality of Montenegro, coffee region of Colombia, where five treatments consisting in different equivalents doses of urea between 0 to 1 t ha-1 and inoculation with Rhizobium were applied on leucaena plants established in pots. The efficiency of Rhizobium nodulation and changes in soil and leaves nitrogen were measured during the first 25 weeks of growth. The number of nodules was manually estimated by count determinations while both soil and foliar nitrogen was performed by using the semimicro Kjeldahl technique. Nodulation was significantly (p<0.05) affected by the presence of urea and tended to decrease with higher urea doses. Total nitrogen in soil did not show significant differences between treatments and the highest value was estimated in 240 kg/ha under the treatment with inoculation and without urea, whereas foliar nitrogen resulted more stable in treatments without urea although with lower values than those treatments with urea where nitrogen showed changes between low and high values along the time.

TI  - Rehabilitation of a debris-flow prone mountain stream in southwestern China - Strategies, effects and implications

AB  - Rehabilitation of Shengou Creek, a small, steep mountain stream in southwestern China that is prone to debris flows, started more than 30. years ago through an integrated program of engineering applications (check dams and guiding dikes), biological measures (reforestation), and social measures (reducing human disturbance). Small and medium-sized check dams and guiding dikes were constructed on key upper and middle sections of the creek to stabilize hillslopes and channel bed. Meanwhile, Leucaena leucocephala, a drought-tolerant, fast-growing, and highly adaptive plant species, was introduced to promote vegetation recovery in the watershed. The collective community structure of tree, shrub, and herb assemblages in the artificial L. leucocephala forest, which developed after 7. years, enhanced soil structure and drastically reduced soil erosion on hillslopes. Cultivation of steep land was strictly controlled in the basin, and some inhabitants were encouraged to move from upstream areas to downstream towns to reduce disturbance. These integrated measures reduced sediment supply from both hillslopes and upstream channels, preventing sediment-related hazards. The development of natural streambed resistance structures (mainly step-pool systems) and luxuriant riparian vegetation aided channel stability, diversity of stream habitat, and ecological maintenance in the creek. These findings are compared with Jiangjia and Xiaobaini Ravines, two adjacent non-rehabilitated debris-flow streams which have climate and geomorphologic conditions similar to Shengou Creek. Habitat diversity indices, taxa richness, biodiversity, and bio-community indices are much higher in Shengou Creek relative to Jiangjia and Xiaobaini Ravines, attesting to the effectiveness of rehabilitation measures. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Down-regulation of Leucaena leucocephala cinnamoyl CoA reductase (LlCCR) gene induces significant changes in phenotype, soluble phenolic pools and lignin in transgenic tobacco
PY  - 2011

AB  - cDNA and genomic clones of cinnamoyl CoA reductase measuring 1011 and 2992 bp were isolated from a leguminous pulpwood tree Leucaena leucocephala, named as LlCCR. The cDNA exhibited 80-85% homology both at the nucleotide and amino acid levels with other known sequences. The genomic sequence contained five exons and four introns. Sense and antisense constructs of LlCCR were introduced in tobacco plants to up and down-regulate this key enzyme of lignification. The primary transformants showed a good correlation between CCR transcript levels and its activity. Most of the CCR down-regulated lines displayed stunted growth and development, wrinkled leaves and delayed senescence. These lines accumulated unusual phenolics like ferulic and sinapic acids in cell wall. Histochemical staining suggested reduction in aldehyde units and increased syringyl over guaiacyl (S/G) ratio of lignin. Anatomical studies showed thin walled, elongated xylem fibres, collapsed vessels with drastic reduction of secondary xylem. The transmission electron microscopic studies revealed modification of ultrastructure and topochemical distribution of wall polysaccharides and lignin in the xylem fibres. CCR down-regulated lines showed increased thickness of secondary wall layers and poor lignification of S2 and S3 wall layers. The severely down-regulated line AS17 exhibited 24. 7% reduction of Klason lignin with an increase of 15% holocellulose content. Contrarily, the CCR up-regulated lines exhibited robust growth, development and significant increase in lignin content. The altered lignin profiles observed in transgenic tobacco lines support a role for CCR down-regulation in improving wood properties of L. leucocephala exclusively used in the pulp and paper industry of India. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Native plants of northeastern Mexico: Their potential in the restoration of damaged ecosystems
PY  - 2012
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892857428&partnerID=40&md5=f60f5c03f824aae5262fd31f941cf43e
AB  - Native plants naturally occur in the region in which they evolved and adapted to the physical and biotic processes characteristic of that region, e.g. climate, soil, time of rainfall, drought, and frost as well as interactions with other species inhabiting the local community. Thus native plants possess certain traits that make them uniquely adapted to local conditions providing a practical and ecologically valuable alternative for landscaping, conservation and restoration of degraded ecosystems. Mexico's ecosystem is a vast one as the country covers a wide variety of terrains, soils and climates with different geography characteristics which favor the development of native species. For instance, in those arid and semiarid regions of northeastern Mexico there is an extensive native plant list of more than 3,100 species. Regions of the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico are dominated by a dense diversity of native plants. The vascular flora comprises 159 families, 1034 genera, 3181 species and 109 intraspecific taxa. The most diverse families are: Asteraceae (148 genera and 481 species), Poaceae (97 genera and 301 species), Fabaceae (76 genera and 258 species), Cactaceae (37 genera and 139 species) and Euphorbiaceae (15 genera and 85 species) among others. Native plant inventory in northeastern Mexico is mostly composed of deciduous and evergreen or perennial species which are characterized by a wide range of growth patterns, diversity in leaf longevity, dynamics of growth and contrasting phenological developments. This resource is used by the inhabitants of the region in various ways such as forage for livestock, coal, timber, shelving, food, herbal, medicine and seed supply for reforestation and ecological restoration. Additionally, the native plant provides a habitat for wildlife and a cover layer that prevent soil erosion. For these reasons native plants develop various morphological and physiological characteristics suitable for adaptation to adverse environmental factors, particularly drought stress and high temperatures.Numerous vegetal species account for the bulk of the bush vegetation providing a characteristic landscape. The most important of these plants consist of various species of Acacia including A. rigidula, A. farnesiana, A. berlandierii, A. smallii and A. tortuosa, and some other important species such as Prosopis laevigata, P. glandulosa, Leucaena leucocephala, Celtis pallida (desert hackberry), Condalia ericoides (javelina bush), Leucophyllum frutescens (cenizo or sometimes called purple sage), and Aloysia wrightii (common bee-brush or white brush). These species favor the retention of soil due to their high sprouting potential, ease of regeneration after frost and forest fires in addition to being accepted by the people so they may be used successfully to restore degraded areas and initiate programs aimed to the protection and conservation of forest elements in northeastern Mexico. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Four Thai swamp buffaloes (SB) and four Murrah buffaloes (MB) fed a based diet of fresh ruzi grass (Bachiaria ruziziensis) with an increased proportion of fresh leucaena leaves. Intake of nutrients in animals increased when ruzi grass was mixed with leucaena. Digestibility of nutrients were the highest in SB and MB fed diets containing 25% and 50% of leucaena, respectively, and nitrogen (N) balances in both animal breeds were varied among diets. The regression equation coefficient of mimosine + DHP in the urine was twice as high in SB than in MB. Urinary purine derivatives excretion rate in SB was higher than that in MB. Plasma triiodothyronine and thyroxine declined in both animal breeds fed a diet containing >1 g mimosine intake/kg BW0.75/day. Plasma urea-N was the lowest in SB, but the highest in MB when fed a diet containing 84% of leucaena. Plasma β-HBA in SB have declined when diets contained >50% of leucaena but that in MB was not affected by any diet. In conclusion, the effect of leucaena in diet upon buffalo breeds depends on the proportion of leucaena in the diet, mimosine contents and condensed tannins components. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This study assesses the toxic effects produced by a Gleysol molic soil contaminated with crude oil on seedlings of two species of legumes. A phytotoxic impact index (IIF) was generated, which includes fve parameters measured by relative rates of impact (IRIF(x)) for variables; emergency, height, root length, aboveground biomass and root biomass. Bioassays were conducted under a completely randomized design with three replications under semi-controlled conditions, to assess the sensitivity of Leucaena leucocephala and Crotalaria incana at different concentrations of HTP (total petroleum hydrocarbons). Effects were highly signifcant (P ≤ 0.01) with increasing concentrations of HTP in substrate. The emergence of L. leucocephala was 29% lower with 80 000 mgkg-1 HTP, while C. incana decreased 30% with 32 000 mgkg-1 HTP respect to control. Both species showed a fve-day delay in the emergence of seedlings when exposed to high levels of HTP. A signifcant decrease in the accumulation of dry matter (DM) at concentrations above 20 000 mgkg-1 HTP was observed in both species. The respective IIF declined of 50% with 80 000 and 25 000 mgkg-1 TPH, but L. leucocephala had no signifcant effect with 10 000 mgkg-1 TPH. Finally, the EC50 in L. leucocephala, is presented with 80 000 mgkg-1 TPH whereas in C. incana this parameter is noted from 25 000 mgkg-1 TPH.

TI  - Effects of temperature and holding time during torrefaction on the pyrolysis behaviors of woody biomass

AB  - Torrefaction is the thermal treatment techniques performed at relatively low temperature (<300 °C) in an inert atmosphere, which aims to improve the fuel properties attractively. In this study, woody biomass (Leucaena leucocephala) was torrefied at various temperatures and holding times and the pyrolysis behaviors of the torrefied wood were examined in detail by using TG-MS technique. It was found that the carbon content and the calorific value of the torrefied leucaena increased significantly when temperature and holding time during the torrefaction increased. From the TG-MS analysis, the pyrolysis behaviors of the torrefied leucaena were significantly different from those of the raw leucaena. The char yield at 800 °C for the torrefied leucaena was increased when increasing the holding time during the torrefaction. On the other hand, the tar yield during the pyrolysis decreased significantly with the increase in the holding time during the torrefaction. Through the results from the TG-MS analysis, it was concluded that the structure of leucaena was changed by the torrefaction at temperature below 275 °C and the cross-linking reactions occurred during the pyrolysis resulting in increase in char yields and decrease in tar yields. It was also suggested that the longer the holding time during the torrefaction, the more the cross-linking reactions proceed during the pyrolysis. The results obtained from the study provide the basic information for the pyrolyser and/or gasifier design by using torrefied biomass as a fuel. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A total of 12 crossbred (Boer × Anglo-Nubian) goats were chosen from a commercial farm on the basis of similar body weight (25.0 ± 3.1 kg). The goats were housed in individual pens and allowed 3 weeks to adapt to experimental conditions. The goats were randomly allocated to three treatments in a 3 × 3 Latin square experiment (replicated four times). Within each period, each goat was given rice straw as roughage plus the respective treatment diet. The diets were iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic containing cassava pulp, molasses, urea and commercial mineral and vitamin mix. The experimental treatments were (i) soybean meal (SBM), (ii) partial substitution of SBM with Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) foliage and (iii) partial substitution of SBM with Madras thorn (Pithecellobium dulce) foliage. Nutrient intakes, ruminal characteristics (pH, ammonia nitrogen and volatile fatty acids), nitrogen balances, plasma urea nitrogen and microbial N supply were not significantly different among treatments. The results of this study indicate that protein foliages from locally grown shrubs and trees can substitute imported feedstuff concentrates (e.g. SBM) as protein supplement for goat production. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

TI  - Probing surface tension additivity on chemically heterogeneous surfaces by a molecular approach
PY  - 2011

AB  - Surface free energy of a chemically heterogeneous surface is often treated as an approximately additive quantity through the Cassie equation [Cassie ABD (1948) Discuss Faraday Soc 3:11-16]. However, deviations from additivity are common, and molecular interpretations are still lacking. We use molecular simulations to measure the microscopic analogue of contact angle, θc, of aqueous nanodrops on heterogeneous synthetic and natural surfaces as a function of surface composition. The synthetic surfaces are layers of graphene functionalized with prototypical nonpolar and polar head group: methyl, amino, and nitrile. We demonstrate positive as well as negative deviations from the linear additivity. We show the deviations reflect the uneven exposure of mixture components to the solvent and the linear relation is recovered if fractions of solvent-accessible surface are used as the measure of composition. As the spatial variations in polarity become of larger amplitude, the linear relation can no longer be obtained. Protein surfaces represent such natural patterned surfaces, also characterized by larger patches and roughness. Our calculations reveal strong deviations from linear additivity on a prototypical surface comprising surface fragments of melittin dimer. The deviations reflect the disproportionately strong influence of isolated polar patches, preferential wetting, and changes in the position of the liquid interface above hydrophobic patches. Because solvent-induced contribution to the free energy of surface association grows as cosθc, deviations of cosθc from the linear relation directly reflect nonadditive adhesive energies of biosurfaces.

AB  - Tree cover and species composition were surveyed in 1998, 2003, and 2010 after the elimination of grazing and fire on the lower 32 hectares of the Tinaja tract at Laguna Cartagena National Wildlife Refuge in south-western Puerto Rico. Surveys of the secondary subtropical dry forest showed that stems increased 3.9 times, trees 6.7 times, basal area 3.3 times, and biomass 4.4 times between 1998 and 2010. Notable differences occurred by site. Greater numbers of stems and trees, greater basal areas, and usually biomass were tallied on 10 plots along the southern boundary closer to residual tree cover than on the northern 22 plots in all three years of measurement. Four plots situated in arroyos and one plot along a fence-line also showed greater values when compared to the respective mean values for all 32 plots on lower Tinaja. Other major trends between 1998 and 2010 were: exotics increased from 70 to 84% of the stems and from 70 to 86% of the trees; the ratio of stems to trees declined from 2.3 to 1.3; Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) DeWit increased from 7 to 53% of the stems and from 14 to 64% of the trees; Pilosocereus royenii (L.) Byles & Rowley decreased from 10 to 2% of the stems and from 7 to 1% of the trees, largely due to attack by the cactus mealybug, Hypogeococcus pungens; and tree species richness increased from 30 to 34.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the in vitro acaricidal effects of lyophilized extracts of four tannin rich plants (Acacia pennatula, Piscidia piscipula, Leucaena leucocephala and Lysiloma latisiliquum) against diverse stages of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, and to asses whether tannins were involved in the acaricidal effect using polyethylene glycol (PEG) to block tannins. Larval immersion (LIT) and adult immersion (AIT) tests were used to evaluate the acaricidal effect of each of the lyophilized extracts against larval and adult stages of R. microplus respectively. Larvae and adult ticks were exposed to increasing concentrations of each plant extract (0, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600 and 19,200μgml-1) for 10min. Larval mortality was recorded at 48h post-incubation. Adult mortality was recorded daily over 14 days, at which point their reproductive efficiency was evaluated. PEG was added to the extracts to verify whether tannins were involved in the acaricidal effect. The effect on egg laying inhibition and larval mortality was analyzed using the GLM procedure in SAS. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the effect of PEG on LIT results. Calculation of the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) was performed using a probit analysis. All extracts reduced the viability of R. microplus larval stages (P<0.001), and viability was restored with the addition of PEG suggesting an important role of tannins in the acaricidal effect (P<0.001). The LC50 values of L. latisiliquum and P. piscipula plant extracts were 6.402 and 2.466μgml-1. None of the tannin-rich plant extracts affected adult mortality (P>0.05). Lysiloma latisiliquum extract inhibited egg hatching of R. microplus (P<0.01). Tannin-rich plant extracts from A. pennatula, P. piscipula, L. leucocephala and L. latisiliquum showed potential acaricidal activity. Further in vivo studies are needed to confirm this finding. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Do combined applications of crop residues and inorganic fertilizer lower emission of N2O from soil?
PY  - 2010

AB  - Emissions of N2O were measured following addition of 15N-labelled residues of tropical plant species [Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), Mucuna pruriens and Leucaena leucocephala] to a Ferric Luvisol from Ghana at a rate of 100-mg-N/kg soil under controlled environment conditions. Residues were also applied in different ratio combinations with inorganic N fertilizer, at a total rate of 100-mg-N/kg soil. N2O emissions were increased after addition of residues, and further increased with combined (ratio) applications of residues and inorganic N fertilizer. However, 15N-N2O production was low and short-lived in all treatments, suggesting that most of the measured N2O-N was derived from the applied fertilizer or native soil mineral N pools. There was no consistent trend in magnitude of emissions with increasing proportion of inorganic fertilizer in the application. The positive interactive effect between residue- and fertilizer-N sources was most pronounced in the 25:75 Leucaena:fertilizer and cowpea:fertilizer treatments where 1082 and 1130-mg N2O-N/g-residue were emitted over 30-days. N2O (loge) emission from all residue amended treatments was positively correlated with the residue C:N ratio, and negatively correlated with residue polyphenol content, polyphenol:N ratio and (lignin-+-polyphenol):N ratio, indicating the role of residue chemical composition in regulating emissions even when combined with inorganic fertilizer. The positive interactive effect in our treatments suggests that it is unlikely that combined applications of residues and inorganic fertilizer can lower N2O emissions unless the residue is of very low quality promoting strong immobilisation of soil mineral N. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - On-farm experiments were conducted in Khammam district of Andhra Pradesh from 2001 to 2006 to evaluate the biomass productivity, intercrop yields and profitability of Eucalyptus tereticornis clonal and Leucaena leucocephala variety K-636 based systems. Trees were planted at a spacing of 3 × 2 m and evaluated at three locations. Height growth was significantly higher in leucaena during the 4 year where as difference in diameter growth was not significant. Biomass partitioning to the bole was high in case of leucaena, ranged from 83% in 2. 5-5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) trees to 89% in 12. 5-15 cm DBH trees and in eucalyptus clones the corresponding values were 71% in 2. 5-5 cm DBH trees and 83% in 12. 5-15 cm DBH trees. Marketable biomass productivity was higher with leucaena (95 Mg ha-1) in comparison to eucalyptus (87 Mg ha-1). Competition effects of trees on intercrops were observed from the 2 year (2002 post-rainy season). Intercrop yields were 45% of the sole crop in eucalyptus system and 36% in leucaena system during the 2 year. Sole eucalyptus and leucaena plantations and intercropping systems recorded higher gross and net returns over arable cropping. Therefore, it can be concluded that leucaena variety K636 and eucalyptus clonal based agroforestry systems are profitable alternatives to arable cropping under rainfed conditions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The experiment objective was to quantify seed rain distance and germination from pure leucaena stands located on the western region of Parana state. Seed traps were placed up to 30 meters externally and 15 meters internally from the leucaena boundaries. Seeds were gathered from the collectors weekly for 53 consecutive weeks. Leucaena seeds were collected during all the study. The highest percentage of leucaena seeds 97.58% and 93.18% from stand 1 and 2, respectively was collected from seed traps 10 meters outside the stands while seed dispersed inside the stand was uniform among the tested distances. Seed germination under laboratory conditions showed seasonal effect with higher values (from 85% to 95%) for seed collected during the summer, and lowest for those collected during fall (30%) and winter (24%) seasons.

AB  - Background: Thornscrubs are a vegetation type from Northeast Mexico, consisting of 60 to 80 tree and shrub species that are used for a wide range of constructive, decorative and energy purposes. However, basic research of the physical and mechanical wood properties are still needed to establish additional uses and, thereby, increase their value in the timber industry. Method: In this research, wood from fourteen native species were studied with regard to their basic density (BD), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and modulus of rupture (MOR), as well as the relationships between these three properties. Results:Results showed that the BD range was 0.48 g cm -3± 0.06 to 0.93 g cm -3±0.07, the lowest being for Leucaena leucocephala and the highest for Condalia hookeri. MOE range was 6.42 GPa±1.23 to 15.13 GPa±2.72, corresponding to Diospyros texana and Acacia schaffneri respectively. MOR range was 101 MPa±16 to 207 MPa±33 for Parkinsonia texana and Acacia schaffneri respectively. Correlations between BD and MOE, BD and MOR, and MOE and MOR were as follows: r=0.67, r=0.64 and r= 0.87 respectively. Conclusion: Values of modulus elasticity and rupture of studied species make them a promising general utility wood that can be recommended for a variety of structural and non-structural uses. © INRA and Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

AB  - A selection of the best wood raw materials for cellulose pulp and papermaking from five varieties of the Leucaena has been made (Leucaena diversifolia, Leucaena collinsii and three varieties of Leucaena leucocephala) with growth periods of one, two and three years. In accordance with biomass production and the features of the raw materials and cellulose pulp obtained, L. diversifolia in its second year of growth was selected as the most suitable material for pulp and papermaking. Pulping of L. diversifolia by soda-ethanol was studied using an experimental design in order to investigate the effects of cooking variables: temperature, time, soda concentration, ethanol concentration and wash-disintegrate temperature on the chemical composition of the obtained pulps (yield, kappa number, viscosity, solubles substances, lignin, holocellulose and α-cellulose contents) and the physico-chemical characteristics of paper sheets (tensile index). The results were evaluated using the response surface methodology. The optimum pulping conditions were established for this lignocellulosic material, using the model predictions. The pulp obtained at these conditions has suitable chemical (pulp) and physical (paper sheets) characteristics: yield (46.5%), 1%NaOH solubles (3.04%), hot water solubles (0.63%), ethanol-benzene extractives (0.44%), holocellulose contents (96.7%), α-cellulose contents (75.8%), lignin contents (0.85%), viscosity (1367) kappa number (15.2) and tensile index (19.2. kN. m/kg). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The nodulation of alfalfa by the acid-tolerant Rhizobium sp. strain LPU83 does not require sulfated forms of lipochitooligosaccharide nodulation signals
PY  - 2011
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650078519&doi=10.1128%2fJB.01009-10&partnerID=40&md5=cf9ef469bf39cc244cb038bcc19af566
AB  - The induction of root nodules by the majority of rhizobia has a strict requirement for the secretion of symbiosis-specific lipochitooligosaccharides (nodulation factors [NFs]). The nature of the chemical substitution on the NFs depends on the particular rhizobium and contributes to the host specificity imparted by the NFs. We present here a description of the genetic organization of the nod gene cluster and the characterization of the chemical structure of the NFs associated with the broad-host-range Rhizobium sp. strain LPU83, a bacterium capable of nodulating at least alfalfa, bean, and Leucena leucocephala. The nod gene cluster was located on the plasmid pLPU83b. The organization of the cluster showed synteny with those of the alfalfanodulating rhizobia, Sinorhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium medicae. Interestingly, the strongest sequence similarity observed was between the partial nod sequences of Rhizobium mongolense USDA 1844 and the corresponding LPU83 nod genes sequences. The phylogenetic analysis of the intergenic region nodEG positions strain LPU83 and the type strain R. mongolense 1844 in the same branch, which indicates that Rhizobium sp. strain LPU83 might represent an early alfalfa-nodulating genotype. The NF chemical structures obtained for the wild-type strain consist of a trimeric, tetrameric, and pentameric chitin backbone that shares some substitutions with both alfalfa- and bean-nodulating rhizobia. Remarkably, while in strain LPU83 most of the NFs were sulfated in their reducing terminal residue, none of the NFs isolated from the nodH mutant LPU83-H were sulfated. The evidence obtained supports the notion that the sulfate decoration of NFs in LPU83 is not necessary for alfalfa nodulation. Copyright © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - The aims of this study is to develop fodder of Moringa oleifera and Leucaena leucocephala as proteins source in the concentrate in pellets to feed cricétomes (Cricetomys gambianus) reared in narrow captivity. Almost,¶ 24 growing male cricétomes with 316±9.5g average live weights, grouped into three batches of eight were used. The experimentation lasted of 94 days. ¶The results indicate that the average consumption of the concentrates in pellet represents 5.2 % of the live weight. Feed digestibility varying from 57.4 to 62.8 %. The live weight gain of cricétomes is better with concentrate containing Moringa oleifera (5.5 g/j). ¶The average consumption index recorded do not present significant differences (value however lower with cricétomes that diet containing Moringa oleifera). ¶It arises, that the incorporation of Moringa oleifera or of Moringa oleifera and Leucaena leucocephala in the concentrate in pellets presents high performance for the breeding of cricétomes in narrow captivity. ¶This technology could be tested by the breeders.

AB  - Thirty- six samples of 12 feed stuffs were evaluated for nutritive value by in vitro gas production technique using rumen fluid collected from camel and cattle. The results found indicated that the highest rate of gas production during 3 - 96h readings was significantly (p<0.05) recorded with feed stuffs that incubated with buffered rumen fluid from camels. In the soluble fractions (a-values) of Ipomoea cordofana, Sonchus oleraceus, Clitoria temala and Pleplmris edulis had significantly (p<0.05) more a-values when incubated with buffered rumen fluid from camel compared to that of cattle, while there was no significant differences among the rest plant species. Six out of 12 studied plants, Convolulus fatmensis, Pleplmris edulis, Leucaena glauca, peanut cake, sesame cake and baggasse reached significantly (p<0.05) high (b-values) when incubated with buffered rumen fluid from camel compared to that of cattle, whereas there was no significant variation among the rest plant species except Acacia seyal which had significantly (p<0.05) higher values (a and a+b) when incubated with buffered rumen fluid from cattle. The (a+b) values of Convolulus fatmensis, Sonchus oleraceus, Clitoria temata, Plepharis edulis, groundnut cake and baggasse were found significantly (p<0.05) higher when incubated with buffered rumen fluid from camel compared to that of cattle. The c-values were only found higher (p<0.05) in Clitoria temata and Pleplmris edulis when incubated with buffered rumen fluid from cattle while, Convolulus fatmensis, Ipomoea cordofana, Sonchus oleraceus, Acacia seyal, sorghum grain and sesame cake recorded highest C-values (p<0.05) on camel fluid. No significant variation between the other plant species was detected. It was observed that there are considerable differences between cattle and camel in terms of a, b, a+b, and c values. The predicted metabolisable energy (ME) profile of camel are varied widely (4.12 - 9.59 MJ/KG DM) when compared to that of cattle, which ranged between (3 - 7.29 MJ/KG DM). The organic matter digestibility (OMD %) of studied individual feed stuffs, which incubated with buffered rumen fluid from cattle ranged between (24.07-63.54%) and that from camel ranged between (31.33 - 71.07%). OMD% of camel was significantly (p<0.05) higher in sesame cake, while, there are no significant differences between the rest studied plant species except in both Acacia seyal and baggasse which significantly (p<0.05) had lower values of OMD% in both cattle and camel trials. It is noticeable that, there are considerable variations in metabolisable energy contents and organic matter digestibilities values of camel compared to that of cattle.

AB  - The present study was carried out to evaluate the effects of alternative feedstuffs as partial substitutes of corn and soybean in free-range broiler diets on performance, carcass yield and technical-economic viability. A total of 400 Pescoço Pelado broilers were distributed in a completely randomized experimental design (CRD), with four treatments (treatment 1:Control; treatment 2: 10% rice bran inclusion; treatment 3: 10% ground cassava leaves; and treatment 4: 10% ground lead tree hay) with four replicates per treatment. Each replicate consisted of a group of 25 birds per paddock, separated per sex. Initial weight (IW), final weight (FW), body weight (BW), daily weight gain (DWG), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were evaluated. Carcass, cuts (breast, thigh, drumstick, back, neck, leg and wings), abdominal fat and giblets (gizzard, heart and liver) yields were determined. The technical-economic viability of each treatment was assessed by determining the cost of feed per kg body weight, economic efficiency index and cost. The highest final weights were obtained with the use of rice bran. Rice bran and cassava leaves promoted higher carcass yield, as well as lower back and abdominal fat yields. The use of cassava leaves showed better economic efficiency among the treatments with alternative feedstuffs. The use of alternative feedstuffs at 10% inclusion in substitution of corn and soybean meal did not not result in major changes in performance and carcass parameters, and economic efficiency, and therefore, their use is recommended when the availability or the price of key ingredients, such as soybean meal and corn, increase.

AB  - A study was conducted to find out the performance and carcass characteristics of sheep fed diet in which biscuits waste (BWM) and Leucaena leucocephala leaf hay (L/h) mixture were used to replace maize and wheat offal mixture at zero (control), 25, 50, 70 and 100% replacement levels. In a completely randomize design, the experimental diet where designated B0, B1, B2, B3, B4, respectively. The 20 growing Yankasa rams aged between 9 to 11 months with an initial average life weight of 12.17 ± 0.33 kg were randomly assign to the 5 dietary treatment with four rams per treatment. Data were collected to estimate dry matter intake (g/d /W 0.7 kg), daily mean life weight gain (g/d), feed efficiency and carcass indices. Dietary replacement of maize and wheat offal mixture with biscuit waste meal and L. leucocelphala leaf hay mixture significantly (P< 0.05) influenced the entire variable measured. However, animal on diet B1 and B2 in which biscuits waste and L. leucocephala leaf mixture replaced 25 and 50% maize and wheat offal mixture, were better when compared to the control (B0) and other test diet in terms of performance and carcass characteristics. This was evident by higher DMI (77.18 and 76.84 g/d/W 0.75 kg), ADWG (134.40 and 129.52 g/d), feed efficiency (0.199 and 0.195), live shrunk weight (21.50 and 20.10 kg), dressing percentage (85.81 and 84.33%), chilled carcass weight (18.33 and 16.83 kg), wholesale cuts leg (9.18 and 8.73%), rack (3.11 and 2.78%), BSF (4.53 and 3.83%), neck added (2.51 and 1.78%) and rib eye area (6.06 and 8.29) which were obtained from the animal on these two diets. Broadly, the result in the present study indicated that 25 and 75% replacement level of maize and wheat offal mixture with biscuits waste and L. leucocephala leaf hay mixture are ideal for ruminant animal production because it improve both the performance and carcass characteristics of rams. © 2011 Academic Journals.

AB  - The evaluation of non-conventional water resources on seed germination and seedling growth performance at early growth stages is still in progress especially in forage crops. This study was designed to test the effect of four types of water qualities (treated wastewater (TWW), industrial water (IW), grey water (GW), and Distilled water (DW)) on germination and early seedling vigor of Leucaena leucocephala. The results showed that the germination was not significantly affected by the different water qualities. Seed germination reached maximum after 17, 14, 14, and 21 days under GW, IW, TWW, and DW treatments, respectively. The highest mean of shoot length was scored under the GW treatment. And, the highest mean of root length was scored under DW which was not significant from GW treatment. The means of shoot fresh was the highest under the TWW. The means of root fresh weight was not significantly different from each other's under different treatments. The growth performance was in progress with no mortality during 21 days of growth. Thus, the best non-conventional water qualities alternatives based on the cleanness, nutrients, and toxicity are the GW, TWW and IW, respectively.

TI  - Assessment of phytochemical content, polyphenolic composition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Leguminosae medicinal plants in Peninsular Malaysia
PY  - 2011
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79751528506&doi=10.1186%2f1472-6882-11-12&partnerID=40&md5=e675e32c3ee27dba48c1b3674932bd80
AB  - Background: Many medicinal plants from Leguminosae family can be found easily in Malaysia. These plants have been used as traditional medicines by local ethnic groups, where they are prepared as decoction, pastes for wound infections, and some have been eaten as salad. This paper focused on the assessment of antioxidant potential, antibacterial activity and classes of phytochemicals of nine plants from the Leguminosae family.Methods: Acacia auriculiformis, Bauhinia kockiana, Bauhinia purpurea, Caesalpinia pulcherrima, Calliandra tergemina, Cassia surattensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Peltophorum pterocarpum, and Samanea saman were extracted with aqueous methanol and dichloromethane:methanol mixture to test for antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The Folin-Ciocalteu assay was conducted to quantify the total phenolic content and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was used to determine the free radical quenching capacity. Antibacterial activity was assessed using disc diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) assay. Screening for major classes of phytochemical was done using standard chemical tests.Results: B. kockiana flowers and C. pulcherrima leaves contained high total phenolic content (TPC) and strong DPPH radical scavenging ability with TPC of 8280 ± 498 mg GAE/100 g, IC50 of 27.0 ± 5.0 μg/mL and TPC of 5030 ± 602 mg GAE/100 g, IC50 of 50.0 ± 5.0 μg/mL respectively. Positive correlation was observed between TPC and free radical scavenging ability. Most extracts showed antibacterial activity against Gram positive bacteria at 1 mg, while none showed activity against Gram negative bacteria at the same dose. All extracts (except Samanea saman flower) showed antibacterial activity against two strains of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with MID values ranging between 100 μg/disc and 500 μg/disc.Conclusion: The potential source of antioxidant and antibacterial agents, especially for MRSA infection treatments were found in B. kockiana, C. pulcherrima, C. tergemina and P. pterocarpum. These preliminary results would be a guide in the selection of potential candidates for further pharmacological study and in search of new drug candidate in treating MRSA infections. © 2011 Chew et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Water is considered an important factor in the arid and semi-arid areas because water shortage affects the agricultural production. The current study aimed to investigate the influence of water application level on the dry matter yield, water use efficiency (WUE), and plant water status in Leucaena leucocephala. The treatments consisted of five levels of water applications based on actual evapotranspiration (AET): 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25 AET respectively. The production was increased from 306.4, 676.3, 724.1, 838.5, to 1172.7 kg/ha as the water application levels increased. The estimated WUE was 2.32, 2.57, 1.83, 1.59 and 1.78 kg/ha/mm for 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25 AET, respectively. Increasing the water application level did not increase the WUE. Using the irrigation level at 0.50 AET can be used to irrigate Leucaena crop without leaving any significant change in dry matter yield compared with 0.75 and 1.00 AET, respectively. There was no significant effect of water application level on each of the leaf water potential (Ψw) and leaf relative water content (LRWC). The means of Ψw was -2.3, -2.1, -2.2, -2.3, -2.2 MPa at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 and 1.25 AET, respectively. The means of leaf relative water content were 75, 74, 77, 77 and 78% at the water treatment levels, respectively. Under different water application levels, a poor correlation between the Ψw and LRWC existed. It is recommended to use 50% of AET as the best irrigation water management treatment for Leucaena production. ©2010 Academic Journals.

AB  - Based on the data from the fields, the patterns of dominant populations of plants in islets of Poyang Lake were investigated by using dispersal index ratio method, canonical correspondence analysis method and clump intensity indexes (the intensity index k of negative binomial distribution, clump intensity, Cassie index, patchiness index and mean crowding). The cause involved with the pattern was analyzed and the relationship between these indexes was surveyed by their correlation coefficients. The results showed that the patterns of those populations were all clumped but apparently different in clump intensity, while Carex scabrifolia has the highest and Lapsana apogonoides has the lowest clump intensity respectively, the clump intensity of perennial plants with rhizome propagation was greater than that of the annual species with seed propagation. Moreover, there was a relationship to some extent between the regular distribution pattern of wetland vegetation in islets of Poyang Lake along water gradient and depositional types of wetland soils. The characteristic of clone reproduction and the dependence of water gradient could be explained for the formation of distribution patterns of islet plants.

AB  - Legume specificity is encoded in rhizobial genetic elements that may be transferred among species and genera. Dissemination (by lateral transfer) of gene assemblies dictating host range accounts for the existence of the same biological variant (biovar) in distinct microbiological species. Different alternative biovars may exist in a single species expanding their adaptation to different niches (legume nodules). A review of all reported biovars is presented. Instead of the term biovar, symbiotic variant (symbiovar) is proposed as a parallel term to pathovar in pathogenic bacteria. Symbiovars should be determined based on the symbiotic capabilities in plant hosts, distinguished by the differences in host range and supported by symbiotic gene sequence information. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Three-layered cement-bonded particleboards (CBPs) from 8- and 16-year-old Leucaena leucocephala trees were manufactured in the laboratory and examined for suitability as a construction material. Four wood-cement ratios, i.e. 1:1.75, 1:2.0, 1:2.25 and 1:2.5 were used. A combination of aluminium sulphate and sodium silicate was used as cement accelerator. Wood particles retained at 2 mm sieve size were used for the core layer and a combination of 1 and 0.5 mm were used for the outer layers. The mechanical and physical properties of the boards were evaluated based on MS 544: 2001. The modulus of rupture ranged from 7.68 to 11.22 MPa and modulus of elasticity, 2981 to 4002 MPa. The internal bond ranged from 0.59 to 0.90 MPa. The water absorption and thickness swelling after 24 hours soaking in water ranged from 12.42 to 19.04% and 0.38 to 0.70% respectively. Generally, the CBPs produced from 8-year-old trees gave better mechanical strength than the 16-year-olds. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - To investigate the changes in soil microbial biomass and its differentiation characteristics under different land use in wet/dry alternate conditions, the study chose 7 kinds of land use with the same altitude at valleys in downstream of Jinsha river in Ningnan county in Sichuan though experimental and statistical analysis. 7 kinds of land use included Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit cv. Salvador land, Zea mays land, Morus alba land, Saccharum sinense land, Camptotheca acuminate land, natural grassland and Zanthoxylum bungeanum land. The results showed that soil microbial biomass and respiration change significantly after land changed from Camptotheca acuminate natural forest to others. All the lands generally presented a decreasing trend on soil microbial biomass, the natural grassland and Leucaena leucocephala land showed a small decline while Zea mays land, Morus alba land, Saccharum sinense land and Zanthoxylum bungeanum land exhibit a great decline. Soil basal respiration in all lands decreased significantly except for natural grassland, the decline in decreasing order was Leucaena leucocephala land, Zea mays land, Morus alba land, Saccharum sinense land and Zanthoxylum bungeanum. Soil induced respiration (SIR)behaves similarly to the basal respiration, while that of Leucaena leucocephala land was higher than that of natural grassland. soil microbial biomass and respiration in wet season was higher than that in dry season. Metabolic quotient (qCO2) was greatly higher in natural grassland while there was no significant difference among Leucaena leucocephala land, Zea mays land, Morus alba land and Camptotheca acuminate land. Metabolic quotient in Saccharum sinense land and Zanthoxylum bungeanum land was significantly smaller than that in Camptotheca acuminate land. The response of qCO2 to dry/wet season was different under different land use. Difference in tillage tradition, plant species under different land use results in a difference in soil microbial biomass, thus to promote the development of soil ecosystem in dry hot valley, more human activity should be avoid to improve soil quality.

AB  - Eighteen crossbred (Thai native x Anglo-Nubian) goats were chosen from a Suranaree University of Technology's farm on the basis of similar bodyweight (15.5 ± 3.5 kg). The goats were randomly allocated to three treatments in randomized complete block design. Each goat was given urea-treated rice straw as roughage plus the respective treatment diets. The diets were iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic containing cassava pulp, molasses, urea, and commercial mineral and vitamin mix. The experimental treatments were (1) soybean meal (SBM), (2) partial substitution of SBM with Streblus aspe Lour foliage, or (3) partial substitution of SBM with Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) foliage. Nutrient intakes, ruminal characteristics (pH, ammonia nitrogen, and volatile fatty acids), nitrogen balances, and plasma urea nitrogen were not significantly different among treatments. The present results indicate that protein foliages from locally grown shrubs and trees can substitute imported feedstuffs concentrate (e.g., SBM) as protein supplement for goat production. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Tanniferous plants represent a promising alternative for controlling gastrointestinal nematodes of small ruminants. This experiment evaluated the effects of extracts from the leaf and stem of Anadenanthera colubrina, Leucaena leucocephala and Mimosa tenuiflora on larval exsheathment of Haemonchus contortus in vitro and verified the role of tannins in this process. Third-stage larvae of H. contortus were incubated with extracts for 3 hours and were exposed to sodium hypochlorite solution. The extracts were tested at 300 μg.mL -1 and accompanied by controls: phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (PVPP). The larval exsheathment was evaluated for 60 minutes, and the results were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05). The six extracts blocked larval exsheathment. After PVPP addition, a tannin inhibitor, the exsheathment percentage was similar to the PBS (p > 0.05), except for L. leucocephala and M. tenuiflora leaf extracts. However, pre-incubation with PVPP of these two extracts significantly changed larval exsheathment when compared to the non-treated extracts (p < 0.05). These results suggest that A. colubrina, L. leucocephala and M. tenuiflora could be useful in gastrointestinal nematode control and that tannins are probably the main compounds involved in the observed effects. However, in vivo and toxicological studies should be conducted.

AB  - In several rhizobia, bacteria that inhabit the soil in free-living conditions and associate in symbiosis with the root of legumes as nitrogen-fixing organisms, plasmid DNA can constitute a high percentage of the genome. We have characterized acid-tolerant isolates of rhizobia-here represented by the strain Rhizobium sp. LPU83-that have an extended nodulation-host range including alfalfa, the common bean, and Leucena leucocephala. In this study we analyzed the plasmids of R. sp. LPU83 in order to characterize their role in the evolution of Medicago symbionts and their involvement in symbiotic behavior. The pLPU83a plasmid was found to be transmissible with no associated phenotypic traits. The symbiotic plasmid pLPU83b could be transferred at very low frequencies under laboratory conditions only when pLPU83a was present; could restore nodulation to a strain cured of its symbiotic plasmid, S. meliloti A818; but could not restore the full nitrogen fixation associated with alfalfa. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In a switch over experiment 4 male adult Muzzafarnagari sheep (mean wt. 26.93 ± 1.74 kg) were fed Dicanthium annulatum-Leucaena leucocephala (DA-LL) and Dicanthium annulatum- Hardwickia binata (DA-HB) in 75:25 ratios, respectively in 2 separate feeding trials to assess the effect of tree leaves supplementation on protozoa population and their generic distribution, bacteria population and fungus counts. Sheep were maintained on each diet for more than 3 months and rumen liquor was collected twice at 0 and 4 h post feeding from each animal to ascertain the rumen microbes. Mean protozoa counts were 5.34 and 3.95 ×105/ml in rumen of sheep supplemented with LL and HB, respectively. Entodiniomophs were the most dominant protozoa species in rumen liquor of sheep on DA-LL (90.82) and DA-HB diets (87.59%). Total viable bacteria and cellulolytic bacteria were significantly (P<0.05) higher in rumen of sheep fed DA-LL (16.05 and 21.46) than DA-HB diet (8.53 × 108/ml and 9.18 × 107/ml). The activity of amylolytic and proteolytic bacteria was 8.84 and 7.70 on DA-LL and 5.04 × 108/ml and 4.45 × 107/ml on DA-HB diet respectively. Mean sporangia counts were comparable in sheep rumen liquor on both diets, while total fungi as thallus forming unit (TFU) were (P<0.05) higher in sheep fed DA-LL (12.87) than DA- HB (6.32 ×104/ml). On both diets bacterial population was more at 0 h post feeding, while fungi was more at 4 than 0 h of feeding. Sheep rumen liquor had higher activities of protozoa, bacteria and fungi on DA-LL diet.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate effects of different doses of Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Salix babylonica (SB) extracts, rich in secondary metabolites, and their mixture (LLSB, 1:1, v/v) on in vitro gas production and some ruminal fermentation patterns such as truly degraded substrate (TDS), short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and microbial protein production (MP) of a high concentrate diet (HCD) fed to growing lambs. The HCD contained (g/kg DM): crude protein (CP), 208; ether extract (EE), 12; neutral detergent fibre (NDFom), 364; acid detergent fibre (aADFom), 41. Plant extracts were prepared at 1g DM/8ml of solvent mixture (methanol:ethanol:water, 1:1:8) and added at levels of 0, 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8ml/g DM. Rumen liquor was collected from 8 growing lambs (Katahdin×Pelibuey, LW 24±0.3kg) fed the same HCD. In vitro gas production (GP) was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 and 72h of incubation. After 72h, the incubation was stopped and the inoculants pH was determined and filtered to determine TDS. Ruminal fermentation parameters such as 24h partitioning factor (PF24), gas yield (GY24), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), metabolizable energy (ME), SCFA, and MP were also estimated. Tree species×extract level interaction (P<0.05) only occurred for gas production at 24 (GP24), 48 (GP48) and 72h (GP72) of incubation, but there were no interactions before 24h of incubation. Relative to control, addition of extracts increased (P<0.05) gas volume GP24, GP48 and GP72, except LLSB extract which had lower (P<0.05) values during the first 48h of incubation versus control (i.e., 0ml/g DM). There was no significant impact of extracts on gas production parameters (i.e., b; asymptotic gas production, c; rate of gas production and L; discrete lag time prior to gas production), while the L tended to decrease (P=0.073) with increasing extract dose only in LL and SB extracts. Addition of either dose of supplemental LL and SB extracts increased (P<0.05) gas production and this increase was higher (P<0.05) for 1.2ml and 1.8ml than 0.6ml extract/g DM for GP24, GP48 and GP72. In general, gas productions were higher (P<0.05) in SB than LL extract. There were no interaction in final ruminal pH, PF24 and GY24, while some fermentation parameters (i.e., TDS, IVOMD, ME, SCFA, and MP) were higher (P<0.05) in LL and SB extract doses versus control. The highest two extract doses (i.e., 1.2 and 1.8ml/g DM) increased (P<0.05) TDS, IVOMD, ME, SCFA and MP values versus 0.6ml/g DM. The SB extract also had higher positive impacts (P<0.05) on rumen fermentation parameters versus LL extract. It is suggested that the individual extracts of LL and SB, but not the mixture, could positively modify rumen gas production and fermentation, which may improve nutrient utilization in growing lambs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The extent to which pretransplant colonization of seedlings with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Glomus aggregatum Schenck and Smith emend. Koske could enhance the post-transplant growth of two cultivars of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (cv. K-8 and cv. K-636) in Al-and Mn-rich acid soils was evaluated in a greenhouse. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization measured at the end of the experiment was significantly stimulated by inoculation in both cultivars at all pH levels tested, although colonization was most stimulated if cv. K-8 was grown in the Al-rich soil at the lowest pH. Symbiotic effectiveness measured as P content of Leucaena pinnules was significantly suppressed in both cultivars if they were grown at the lowest pH. Symbiotic effectiveness measured as pinnule P content and shoot biomass yield was enhanced in both cultivars by liming. The trends in effectiveness were similar in both cultivars, but cultivar effect was significant in the Mn-rich Oxisol (Wahaiawa soil) but not in the Al-rich Ultisol (Leilehua soil). The tolerance of the cultivars to acid soil toxicity in the Wahiawa soil varied with the pretransplant mycorrhizal status of their seedlings. The effect of pretransplant colonization of seedlings was to eliminate the differences in the tolerance of the cultivars to acid soil toxicity. Our data suggest that AMF could offset some of the growth reduction associated with soil acidity and that host genotype could play a role in this regard.

AB  - For incorporating superhydrophobic surfaces in microfluidic systems, it is important to understand the ability of the superhydrophobic state to withstand hydraulic pressure. In this paper we describe experiments to probe the collapse transition on superhydrophobic surfaces completely covered by water, where the air film formed on the surface is closed. Polyethylene foils nanoimprinted with micrometre sized pillars in different geometries and densities are used as the model superhydrophobic surfaces. The pressure required for the transition from Cassie to Wenzel state is measured for all surfaces and also compared to analytical and numerical models. We find that the closed film of trapped air helps stabilise the Cassie state at low pillar densities and that the effect of a small change in pillar sidewall angle can drastically change the collapse behaviour. Finally, the reverse transition, from Wenzel to Cassie state, is observed on densely pillared surfaces at low water pressure. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Water availability is a major constraint to crop production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where agriculture is predominantly rain-fed. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the nitrogen-fixing legume tree Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and inorganic fertilizer on rain use efficiency (RUE), a robust measure of productivity and land degradation, in three long-term (11-12 years) experiments conducted in Zambia and Nigeria. On the two Zambian sites, sole maize (Zea mays) grown continuously (for 11-12 years) with the recommended fertilizer achieved the highest RUE (3.9-4.6kgha-1mm-1) followed by maize intercropped with Leucaena (2.5-3.4kgha-1mm-1). This translated to 192-383% increase in RUE over the control (maize grown without nutrient inputs), which is the de facto resource-poor farmers' practice. RUE was more stable in fully fertilized sole maize on the first Zambian site and not statistically different from the maize-Leucaena associations on the second site. On the Nigerian site, RUE was higher in maize planted between Leucaena hedgerows supplemented with 50% of the recommended fertilizer (3.9kgha-1mm-1), maize grown between Leucaena hedgerows without fertilizer (3.0kgha-1mm-1) and sole maize receiving the recommended fertilizer (2.8kgha-1mm-1), which translated to increases in RUE of 202%, 139% and 85%, respectively, over the control. RUE was more stable in the maize grown between Leucaena hedgerows than in the fully fertilized maize. On all sites RUE was least stable in the control. Yield stability in the maize-Leucaena association was not significantly different from the fully fertilized maize on the Zambian sites. On the Nigerian site, maize yields were more stable in maize grown in Leucaena hedgerows than in fully fertilized sole maize. Supplementation of maize grown in Leucaena hedgerows with 50% of the recommended fertilizers resulted in greater yield stability. It is concluded that intercropping cereals with legume trees and supplementation with inorganic fertilizer can increase rain use efficiency and yield stability in rain-fed agriculture in SSA. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) accumulation in the top 00.15m of leucaenagrass pastures were compared with native pastures and with continuously cropped land. OC and TN levels were highest under long-term leucaenagrass pasture (P0.05). For leucaenagrass pastures that had been established for 20, 31, and 38 years, OC accumulated at rates that exceeded those of the adjacent native grass pasture by 267, 140, and 79kg/ha.year, respectively, while TN accumulated at rates that exceeded those of the native grass pastures by 16.7, 10.8, and 14.0kg/ha.year, respectively. At a site where 14-year-old leucaenagrass pasture was adjacent to continuously cropped land, there were benefits in OC accumulation of 762kg/ha.year and in TN accumulation of 61.9kg/ha.year associated with the establishment of leucaenagrass pastures. Similar C:N ratios (range 12.714.5) of soil OC in leucaena and grass-only pastures indicated that plant-available N limited soil OC accumulation in pure grass swards. Higher OC accumulation occurred near leucaena hedgerows than in the middle of the inter-row in most leucaenagrass pastures. Rates of C sequestration were compared with simple models of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the grazed pastures. The amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2-e) accumulated in additional topsoil OC of leucaenagrass pastures ≤20 years old offset estimates of the amount of CO2-e emitted in methane and nitrous oxide from beef cattle grazing these pastures, thus giving positive GHG balances. Less productive, aging leucaena pastures 20 years old had negative GHG balances; lower additional topsoil OC accumulation rates compared with native grass pastures failed to offset animal emissions. © 2011 CSIRO.

AB  - Success in establishing and colonizing new areas is directly related to germination behaviour of seeds under local environmental conditions. This work aimed to compare germination performance of the exotic invader Leucaena leucocephala to two legumes (Caesalpinia ferrea, native, and C. pulcherrima, exotic) which are not considered invasive. Non-scarified seeds were exposed to constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 oC, within a photoperiod of 12 hours, for 100 days. Both final germination percentage and germination speed showed significant differences among the three species. C. ferrea had low germination percentage, with optimal germination temperature at 25 oC, reaching germination percentage of 59% and germination speed of 0.68 seeds d -1. In contrast, C. pulcherrima had high germination percentages at all temperatures tested, with highest germinability from 20 to 40 oC. Seeds of L. leucocephala had the lowest germination percentage and optimal germination temperature was 35 oC. The germination performance of this exotic is not outstanding, and factors such as propagule pressure, natural scarification and good performance in other life stages must contribute to its invasiveness.

AB  - The use of pioneer plants, mainly nitrogen-fixing leguminous trees, associated to the secondary and climax species, has been making possible good results in the land reclamation. However, it is important to establish the appropriate spacing among the form species obtaining a fast covering and protection of the soil, without there is strong competition of the plants for light, water and nutrients. So, the objective of this work was to evaluate the growth of the Hymenaea courbaril and leguminous trees at, in system quincux, in different spacings. The treatments, in factorial scheme 3 × 3 with three replicates, corresponded to three species of pioneerleguminous trees (Acacia mangium, Senna multijuga and Leucaena leucocephala combined with Hymenaea courbaril) and three spacings among pioneer plants (4 × 2; 4 × 3 and 4 × 4 m). After one and two years of planting determined the height, stem diameter at ground level and crown diameter of pioneer plants and Hymenaea courbaril. Acacia mangium showed growth characteristics superior to those of Senna multijuga and Leucaena leucocephala, however, no influence of spacing between species in relation to the se characteristics. The growth characteristics of the Hymenaea courbaril were not influenced by pioneer species associated, however, the denser spacing between the pioneer species favored the greatest increase.

AB  - The present study was aimed at investigating the metabolic effects of iodine supplementation in goats when fed on a diet containing Leucaena leucocephala, intended to create mild iodine deficiency. Two groups of indigenous adult goats were fed on a leucaena leaf meal-based diet without (CON) or with 0.1 mg iodine per day per animal (EXP) for a period of 180 days. Dry matter intake and dry matter digestibility were higher (P < 0.05) in the EXP group. The retention of nitrogen and phosphorus was higher (P < 0.05) in the EXP group. Retention of calcium was also higher (P = 0.082) in the EXP group. The net loss of bodyweight in the CON group (-1.21 kg) was reversed in EXP goats, which showed a net gain (+1.79 kg). The serum metabolic profile reflected a positive influence of iodine supplementation, which also induced greater (P < 0.001) circulating thyroxine concentration. The cell-mediated immune response was higher (P < 0.05) in the EXP group, whereas humoral immunity remained unaltered. The results suggested that supplementation with extra iodine could be used as an effective strategy to counteract functional disorders of the thyroid and associated adverse effects induced in goats by feeding of leucaena leaf meal. © CSIRO 2011.

AB  - Removal of lignin is a major hurdle for obtaining good quality pulp. Leucaena leucocephala (subabul) is extensively used in paper industry in India; therefore, as a first step to generate transgenic plants with low lignin content, cDNA and genomic clones of CCR gene were isolated and characterized. The cDNA encoding CCR (EC 1.2.1.44) was designated as Ll-CCR; the sequence analysis revealed an Open Reading Frame (ORF) of 1005 bp. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Ll-CCR sequence is highly homologous to CCRs from other dicot plants. The 2992 bp genomic clone of Leucaena CCR consists of 5 exons and 4 introns. The haploid genome of L. leucocephala contains two copies as revealed by DNA blot hybridization. Ll-CCR gene was over-expressed in Escherichia coli, which showed a molecular mass of approximately 38 kDa. Protein blot analysis revealed that Ll-CCR protein is expressed at higher levels in root and in stem, but undetectable in leaf tissues. Expression of CCR gene in Leucaena increased up to 15 d in case of roots and stem as revealed by QRT-PCR studies in 0-15 d old seedlings. ELISA based studies of extractable CCR protein corroborated with QRT-PCR data. CCR protein was immuno-cytolocalized around xylem tissue. Lignin estimation and expression studies of 5, 10 and 15 d old stem and root suggest that CCR expression correlates with quantity of lignin produced, which makes it a good target for antisense down regulation for producing designer species for paper industry. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - The proteinase inhibitors are proteins extensively investigated in tissue storage, but few prospected in other plant tissues. The aim of this study was to detect the presence of serine proteinase inhibitors in leaf extracts from fifteen species of leguminous trees of the Amazon forest. The species studied were Caesalpinia echinata, C. ferrea, Cedrelinga cateniformis, Copaifera multijuga, Dinizia excelsa, Enterolobium contortisiliquum, E. maximum, E. schomburgkii, Leucaena leucocephala, Ormosia paraensis, Parkia multijuga, P. pendula, P. platycephala, Swartzia corrugata and S. polyphylla. Leaves were collected, dried at 30°C for 48 h, crushed and subjected to extraction with NaCl (0.15 M, 10% w/v), resulting in the total extract. Tests were performed to determine the concentration of proteins and to detect of inhibitory activity against bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin. The content of crude and soluble protein in leaf extracts varied from 7.9 to 31.2% and 1.3 to 14.8%, respectively. The inhibitory activity on trypsin and chymotrypsin was observed in all leaf extracts. However, in extracts of E. maximum, L. leucocephala, P. pendula, S. corrugata and S. polyphylla, the inhibition was greater on trypsin, while extract of P. multijuga was more effective against chymotrypsin. We conclude that leaf extracts of leguminous trees have serine proteinase inhibitors and show potential biotecnological applications.

AB  - A series of fertiliser trials were conducted on leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata) pastures growing on a range of soil types in south-east and central Queensland. The primary objective was to determine the extent of phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) deficiencies in leucaena-grass pastures established on either virgin soils or previously cropped soils. Two experiments were conducted across nine sites and confirmed that, for many soils in Queensland, leucaena growth was restricted by P and S nutrient deficiencies, which limited plant growth directly and suppressed symbiotic N2 fixation. The major factors contributing to the P and S deficiencies and thus affecting leucaena response were: (i) inherent low soil fertility, (ii) nutrient removal by cropping and grazing, (iii) shallow soils, (iv) soil acidity, and (v) grass competition for available water and nutrients. A secondary treatment, inter-row cultivation, had little effect on leucaena growth but significantly increased grass growth in some soils. In all these experiments, leaf S concentrations and N:S ratios in index tissue were inconsistent indicators of adequacy of S. Similarly, leaf P concentrations were not useful indicators of P deficiency due to inappropriate (drought) leaf sampling conditions experienced in these experiments. The experiments demonstrate that the productivity of leucaena-grass pastures, especially in older leucaena plantations, will be limited by nutrient deficiencies on many soils in Queensland. While leucaena yield was suppressed, no foliar symptoms of nutrient deficiency were observed. Growers need to monitor the nutrient status of their leucaena-grass pastures by leaf tissue analysis using a new sampling protocol. Strategic fertiliser application has the potential to increase rainfall use efficiency by 50% with an expected parallel increase in cattle liveweight gain. © 2010 CSIRO.

AB  - Three varieties of Leucaena viz., K-8 (L. leucocephala), K-156 (L. diversifolia) and K-743A (L. leucocephala x L. diversifolia) were evaluated for fodder production under silvipastoral system to improve the fodder quality and quantity. The fodder crops viz., Napier bajra hybrid (PBN- 233, perennial), maize (J-1006) + cowpea (Cowpea-88) followed by berseem (BL-10) + Rye grass (Rye grass No.1) were grown in between the rows of Leucaena to study the effect of annuals and perennials on Leucaena fodder production. The variety K-8 was found to perform best among the studied three varieties for height (3.35 m & 3.20 m), collar diameter (8.38 cm & 12.12 cm), fresh leaf biomass (3.70 kg/plant & 3.78 kg/plant), dry leaf biomass (1.18 kg/plant & 1.30 kg/plant), fuelwood biomass (3.17 kg/plants & 3.35 Kg/plant) and fuelwood dry biomass (1.15 kg/plants & 1.19 kg/plants).

AB  - Two experiments were conducted to determine (i) the effects of protein-rich trees (PRTs) and (ii) the effects of leucaena treated with NaOH solution and leucaena plus polyethylene glycol (PEG) on nutrient digestibility, nitrogen (N) balance, urinary purine derivatives excretion and blood metabolites in Thai swamp buffaloes. In Experiment 1, animals were fed with rice straw as a basal diet and one of the four PRT supplements: (i) oven-dried rain tree pods (RTPP, control); (ii) sun-dried leucaena leaves; (iii) sun-dried cassia leaves and (iv) sun-dried mulberry leaves. Fibre digestibility and N balance were lower (P < 0.05), but microbial N in the rumen was higher (P < 0.05) in animals supplemented with RTPP than in those fed with the other supplements. In Experiment 2, animals were fed with rice straw as a basal diet and leucaena were treated in one of three ways: (i) untreated (control), (ii) leucaena treated with NaOH solution and (iii) leucaena + PEG. Fibre digestibility and N balance in the rumen improved (P < 0.05) in animals supplemented with leucaena + PEG, but microbial N was not increased. The study demonstrated a way of using local PRTs for a suitable and worthwhile method to improve the quality of buffalo feeding systems in the tropics. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Lignin, a major constituent of plant call wall, is a phenolic heteropolymer. It plays a major role in the development of plants and their defense mechanism against pathogens. Therefore Lignin biosynthesis is one of the critical metabolic pathways. In lignin biosynthesis, the Cinnamoyl CoA reductase is a key enzyme which catalyzes the first step in the pathway. Cinnamoyl CoA reductase provides the substrates which represent the main transitional molecules of lignin biosynthesis pathway, exhibits a high in vitro kinetic preference for feruloyl CoA. In present study, the three-dimensional model of cinnamoyl CoA reductase was constructed based on the crystal structure of Grape Dihydroflavonol 4-Reductase. Furthermore, the docking studies were performed to understand the substrate interactions to the active site of CCR. It showed that residues ARG51, ASN52, ASP54 and ASN58 were involved in substrate binding. We also suggest that residue ARG51 in CCR is the determinant residue in competitive inhibition of other substrates. This structural and docking information have prospective implications to understand the mechanism of CCR enzymatic reaction with feruloyl CoA, however the approach will be applicable in prediction of substrates and engineering 3D structures of other enzymes as well. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Aim of the study: This review provides a summary of Mexican medicinal flora in terms of ethnobotanical, pharmacology, and chemistry of natural products related to anticancer activity. Materials and methods: Bibliographic investigation was carried out by analyzing recognized books and peer-reviewed papers, consulting worldwide accepted scientific databases from the last five decades. Mexican plants with attributed anti-cancer properties were classified into six groups: (a) plant extracts that have been evaluated for cytotoxic effects, (b) plant extracts that have documented anti-tumoral effects, (c) plants with active compounds tested on cancer cell lines, (d) plants with novel active compounds found only in Mexican species, (e) plants with active compounds that have been assayed on animal models and (f) plants with anti-cancer ethnopharmacological references but without scientific studies. Results: Three hundred plant species belonging to 90 botanical families used for cancer treatment have been recorded, of which only 181 have been experimentally analyzed. The remaining 119 plant species are in use in empirical treatment of diseases consistent with cancer symptomatology. Only 88 of the plant extracts experimentally studied in in vitro cellular models have demonstrated active cytotoxic effects in at least one cancer cell line, and 14 out of the 88 have also been tested in vivo with the results that one of them demonstrated anti-neoplasic effects. A total of 187 compounds, belonging to 19 types of plant secondary metabolites, have been isolated from 51 plant extracts with active cytotoxic effects, but only 77 of these compounds (41%) have demonstrated cytoxicity. Seventeen of these active principles have not been reported in other plant species. However, only 5 compounds have been evaluated in vivo, and 3 of them could be considered as active. Conclusion: Clearly, this review indicates that it is time to increase the number of experimental studies and to begin to conduct clinical trials with those Mexican plants and its active compounds selected by in vitro and in vivo activities. Also, the mechanisms of action by which plant extracts and their active compounds exert anti-cancer effects remain to be studied. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conventional cattle ranching with low plant diversity and a high dependence on chemical fertilisers and herbicides, simplifies ecosystems and negatively affects their functioning. In tropical regions, the cattle ranching systems that use fodder trees and shrubs along with grasses offer a useful landscape management tool that may contribute to the conservation of biodiversity and the stability of ecological processes. Given the functional importance of dung beetles in natural and anthropogenic ecosystems, this study evaluates the recovery of some of the ecological services in which these insects play a role by comparing treeless improved pastures (IP) with those that have been converted into silvopastoral systems (SPS: two species of grass, Cynodon plectostachyus and Pannicum maximum, in association with Leucaena leucocephala trees) in a cattle ranching landscape of the Colombian Andes. The results reveal an increment in the abundance of dung beetles in SPS and, as a consequence, an increase in dung, soil and seed removal, as well as a reduction in the number of adult flies and their larvae compared with IP. 4. This suggests that SPS offer suitable refuges for the dung beetle fauna that complement the role of protected forest remnants, riparian forests and live fences in conserving the integrity of key ecological processes in cattle ranching landscapes. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Soil temperature and soil moisture are the most important environmental factors controlling soil respiration (SR) in ecosystems. However, SR and associated edaphic factors have not been widely studied in semi-arid regions. In this study, SR was measured in a riparian zone and the effect of soil temperature and soil moisture on SR was examined under five forest species of the semi-arid region. The mean daily SR rate was 1.82, 2.08, 2.35, 2.27 and 2.07 g C m-2 d-1 in Jatropha curcas, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica and Prosopis juliflora sites respectively. It was found that SR was significantly and positively correlated with soil moisture. A univariate model of sub-surface soil moisture could explain 77% of temporal variation in soil CO2 efflux, irrespective of species and sites. The logarithmic model could best explain the relationship between SR and soil moisture at 10-20 cm of soil depth (P < 0.001). There were negative correlations between SR and soil temperature under majority of species. Overall, across all species, soil temperature poorly explained 26% variation in SR as independent variable. For SR rate-temperature relationship, a bell-shaped function gave the best fit in this ecosystem. Under all the species, SR increases with increase in soil temperature up to 33°C (± 2); thereafter it decreases gradually under all species. There was strong evidence that deficit of soil moisture rather than soil temperature was the main regulating factor of SR under the semi-arid ecosystems.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the potential of atmospheric carbon storage by Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala, through the quantification of biomass production and carbon content in stem, branches and foliage. This was done to estimate the potential it has to be included in the program whose central axis are silvopastoral systems and supply of environmental services in the study region. This was done -by using allometric equations- to estimate the potential of being included in a local technology innovation program, whose centerpiece is the silvopastoral systems and supply of environmental services in the region of study. The destructive sampling methodology included 30 trees of two forage-potentially species in central Chiapas, by integrating information on the diameter at breast height (DBH), total tree height and weights independent of stem, branches and foliage. We estimated the dry matter of each of the samples by drying them with forced air for 48 hours at 60 °C in a drying oven. We also determined the carbon content with the analizer CHN. With the obtained data, a series of exponential and logarithmic models were adjusted by using statistical software. In the case of L. leucocephala best-fit model was In (ba) = -1,46 + 1,69 In (DBH) and G. sepium model ba = 3,27e0,075 (DAP). The results indicate that L. leucocephala has a higher above- ground biomass production and consequently greater potential to store atmospheric carbon than Gliricidia sepium. This choice favors the establishment of silvopastoral practices and future research aimed at technological innovation to address sustainable farming in Chiapas, Mexico.

AB  - In this work, Leucaena leucocephala K366 was characterized chemical and energy terms, and assessed its potential as a lignocellulosic raw material and energetic and industrial crop specie, and its integral fractionation by autohydrolysis by evaluating its calorific value, holocellulose, glucan, xylan, arabinan, lignin and oligomers and monomers contents in autohydrolysis liquor and solid phase. Also, this paper will consider the influence of the temperature and time of autohydrolysis process from L. leucocephala K366 to obtain valuable liquor and a suitable solid phase to produce energy by combustion. Valuable liquor was obtained from the autohydrolysis of L. leucocephala by simultaneously using operating temperatures and times in the medium-high ranges studied, namely: 172-184 °C and 15-30 min. The optimum processing conditions provided an acceptable yield (16-26%), and high xylose and xylo-oligomer contents in the liquor (10.0 and 58.6%, respectively, of the amounts present in the starting raw material when operating at 184 °C for 30 min) in comparison with other raw materials. The arabinan fraction was extracted virtually completely -only 8.3% remained in the solid fraction-, and the acetyl group fraction was recovered in full. In addition, these conditions reduced the glucose content of the liquor to 2.9% of the amount present in the raw material while largely preserving the integrity of cellulose fibers. Klason lignin was scarcely dissolved under the operating conditions of the autohydrolysis process. This increased the calorific value of the solid phase by 9% (under the most drastic operating conditions) with respect to the starting raw material. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted for ten years in a sandy soil in the north part of the Paraná State, Brazil. The soil samples were collected at 0-10 cm depth, both under the coffee canopy and in the inter row space between the coffee plants, in the following treatments: Control, Leucaena leucocephala, Crotalaria spectabilis, Crotalaria breviflora, Mucuna pruriens, Mucuna deeringiana, Arachis hypogaea and Vigna unguiculata. The legume crops influenced the microbial activity, both under the coffee canopy and in the inter row space. The cultivation of Leucaena leucocephala increased the microbial biomass C, N and P. Although L. leucocephala and Arachis hypogaea provided higher microbial biomass, the qCO2 decreased by up to 50% under the coffee canopy and by about 25% in the inter row space. The soil microbial biomass was enriched in N and P due to green manure residue addition.

AB  - Extensive cattle production currently occupies more than 27% of the rural landscapes in Latin America, and continues to expand. This activity, deeply rooted in the culture and rural economy of the region, requires an urgent transformation if it is to become both more efficient and environmentally friendly. Silvopastoral systems that incorporate native trees and shrubs are instrumental for the productive rehabilitation of cattle production and for biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes. We discuss research progress and adoption of intensive silvopastoral systems in Colombia and Mexico. Intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) are a sustainable form of agroforestry for livestock production that combines fodder shrubs planted at high densities (more than 10,000 plants ha-1), trees and palms, and improved pastures. High stocking and the natural production of milk and meat in these systems are achieved through rotational grazing with electric fencing and a permanent supply of water for the cattle. While milk and meat production and cattle reproduction are enhanced, production costs decline as external inputs are replaced by natural processes related to fertility and biological control. We also discuss the importance of the ISS with native trees for climate change adaptation and mitigation, the barriers for their adoption, and how these have been successfully addressed using payment for environmental services, special credits and technical assistance. Finally, we highlight the need for enhancing landscape connectivity by integrating SPS to conservation corridors with native species to promote biodiversity conservation and other environmental services demanded by society. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Tillage and legume mulching effects on moisture conservation and productivity of rainfed maize (Zea mays)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping system

AB  - A field experiment was conducted at Selakui, Dehradun from 2001 to 2004 to study the effect of tillage, viz. conventional tillage (CT) and minimum tillage (MT); and weed-control practices, viz. chemical and mechanical weeding along with legume mulching, viz. in situ grown sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) and subabul [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] on soil moisture conservation, crop productivity and soil health in maize (Zea mays L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend Fiori & Paol.) cropping system. CT gave higher grain yield of maize (+0.11 to 0.17 t/ha), but wheat performed equally well under CT (2.48 t/ha) and MT conditions (2.36 t/ha). Chemical weeding with herbicides (alachlor in maize and isoproturon in wheat) resulted in 7.8 and 9.9% higher yield of maize and wheat, respectively over mechanical weeding. Beneficial effect of live mulching with sunnhemp or Leucaena was similar (12.3-14.7%), while their combined application increased the maize yield by 19.1% over no mulching. Further, enhanced soil moisture conservation due to mulching at maize harvest led to greater productivity of wheat by 16.1% with sunnhemp or Leucaena, and 27.0% with sunnhemp + Leucaena. Nitrogen uptake of maize and wheat increased significantly with chemical weeding and legume mulching, but tillage practices made no effect on wheat while in maize it was lower under MT. Wheat gave 4-5 times more net returns than maize, and the net B: C ratio of the system was > 1.0 with chemical weeding and legume mulching. Tillage and weed-control practices made no effect on organic C and total N status of soil but legume mulching improved these parameters and reduced bulk density associated with increased infiltration rate. It was concluded that CT along with legume mulching in maize and MT in wheat, and chemical weeding of both the crops was beneficial for improving moisture and nutrient conservation, and achieving higher productivity and profitability of maize-wheat cropping system under Doon valley conditions.

AB  - Rhizobia establish symbiosis with legumes. Bacteroids in indeterminate nodules of Inverted Repeat Lacking Clade (IRLC) legumes undergo terminal differentiation caused by Nodule-specific Cysteine-Rich peptides (NCRs). Microscopic observations of bacteroids and the detection of NCRs in indeterminate nodules of the non-IRLC legume Leucaena glauca were performed. A portion of the bacteroids showed moderate cell elongation, loss of membrane integrity, and multiple nucleoids. The symbiosome contained multiple bacteroids and NCR-like peptides were not detectable. These results indicate that bacteroid differentiation in L. glauca is different from that in IRLC legumes although both hosts form indeterminate nodules.

AB  - A bioengineering technique is gradually being used as an alternative for slope stabilisation design. The effect of vegetation on soil strength, particularly in terms of root reinforcement aspects has therefore become a major interest. However, there is a lack of documentation on the root mechanical properties available especially in Malaysia. In this study, both pull-out and tensile strength of two tropical trees namely Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia mangium were investigated on different stem sizes. L. leucocephala performs the higher pullout strength than A. mangium. The results also show that pullout resistance is much affected by the root than the shoot profiles. In terms of tensile strength, the tensile strength decreases with increasing root diameter, implying the finer root diameter contribute to the higher tensile strength. In both parameters, L. leucocephala exhibits the highest value. The study suggests that L. leucocephala has an added value as a good potential slope plant for slope stabilization work as it exhibits outstanding root mechanical properties. Interestingly, the results also showed that the pullout force was much affected by the tensile strength. It can be concluded that some root and shoot properties do have a great impact on root mechanical properties such as tensile and pullout strengths.

The assays of aldose reductase and a-glycosidase inhibition activities were conducted in in vitro way on the subfractions isolated from the methanol extract of Leucaena leucocephala (lmk) De Wit. This work shows that one of the active subfractions (I-5) can inhibit aldose reductase and a-glycosidase enzyms, with the IC50 of 12.56 ± 1.23 μg/mL dan 7.67 ± 1.32 μg/mL. These IC50 values of I-5 are on par with acarbose.

AB  - The distribution, growth, and seed germination ability of the exotic lead tree in Penghu Islands, Taiwan, were studied. Survey results have shown that all lead tree plants existing throughout these islands belonged to the Hawaii type. Subsequently a comparison of germination requirements between this and the rare Salvador type, which distributes only in the island of Taiwan, was carried out. The objective of this research was to compare the germination requirements of the Salvador- and Hawaii-type lead tree plants. Lead trees in Penghu Islands have formed a pure forest with a height ranging from 2 to 4 m. All growth stages of the lead tree, i.e., vegetative, flowering, podding, and depodding stages, were found simultaneously in fall, but only vegetative and podding stages were observed in summer. Germination of both the Hawaii- and Salvador-type lead tree was evaluated under different environmental conditions, including temperature, pH, osmotic potential, burial depth, and lighting condition.The Salvador-type exhibited more than 60% seed germination after 14 d at temperatures between 20 and 35 C, whereas the seed germination of the Hawaii type increased from 20 to 60% with temperature increases from 20 to 35 C. The optimal temperature for seed germination of these two types of lead tree was 35 C. Increasing burial depth beneath the soil surface and darkness, as well as an osmotic potential below -0.4 MPa, also reduced seed germination. However, the germination of both types was not affected by pH ranging from 4.0 to 9.0. On the basis of the climatic and soil environment conditions in Penghu Islands, it is reasonable to predict that the summer season, in which lead tree seeds readily germinate on the ground or in shallow soils, is the optimal time for controlling this plant. © 2010 Weed Science Society of America.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of various protein sources on digestibility, rumen fermentation, milk yield and milk composition in dairy cows. Four Holstein Friesian native crossbred cows in early lactating were randomly assigned according to a 4x4 Latin square design. The dietary treatments containing different protein sources in concentrate diets were soybean meal (SBM), cassava hay (CH), Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and yeast-fermented cassava chips (YEFECAP), with ad libitum intake of urea-treated rice straw. Digestibility of DM, OM, NDF and ADF was not different among treatments (P>0.05) while CP digestibility was highest (P<0.05) in CH and YEFECAP supplemented groups. Ruminal NH3-N and BUN concentrations varied among protein sources and were highest in SBM and LL fed groups (P<0.05). Ruminal total volatile fatty acid (VFA) and propionic acid were found highest in cows receiving CH and YEFECAP (P<0.05). Ruminal fungi, proteolytic and cellulolytic bacteria were highest when YEFECAP was supplemented. Milk fat and milk protein were significantly increased (P<0.05) in cows fed with CH and YEFECAP. Based on this study, it was concluded that providing CH or YEFECAP as protein source in concentrate diets could improve rumen fermentation and milk production in lactating dairy cows fed on rice straw. © 2011 by Maejo University, San Sai, Chiang Mai, 50290 Thailand.

TI  - Methane emissions from grazing cattle using point-source dispersion
PY  - 2011

AB  - The ability to accurately measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential to gauge our ability to reduce these emissions. Enteric methane from ruminants is an important but often difficult source to quantify since it depends on the amount and type of feed intake. Unfortunately, many of the available measurement techniques for estimating enteric methane emissions can impose a change in feed intake. Our study evaluates a nonintrusive technique that uses a novel approach (point-source dispersion with multiple open-path concentrations) to calculate enteric methane emissions from grazing cattle, reported as the major source of GHG in many countries, particularly Australia. A scanner with a mounted open-path laser was used to measure methane concentration across five paths above a paddock containing 18 grazing cattle over 16 d. These data were used along with wind statistics in a dispersion model (WindTrax) to estimate an average herd methane emission rate over 10-min intervals. Enteric methane emissions from the herd grazing a combination of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Kunth) and Leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.)] averaged (± SD) 141 (± 147) g animal-1 d-1. In a release-recovery experiment, the technique accounted for 77% of the released methane at a single point. Our study shows the technique generates more reliable methane emissions during daytime (unstable stratification).

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is widely used as raw material for the manufacture of paper and packaging material and in biomass based power plants in the state of Andhra Pradesh, Southern India. Experiments were conducted to study the affect of tree density on the growth, biomass partitioning and wood productivity. Six treatments 1 × 1 m, 1.3 × 1.3 m, 3 × 0.75 m, 3 × 1 m, 5 × 0.8 m and 3 × 2 m corresponding to a tree density of 10,000, 6666, 4444, 3333, 2500 and 1666 were evaluated with leucaena variety K636. At 51 months after planting, spacings significantly influenced tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), number of branches and biomass partitioning. Wider tree rows resulted in greater tree height and diameter growth resulting in higher per plant productivity. At harvest, 70% of trees in 3 × 2 m attained a diameter of more than 7.5 cm, while 35% of the trees attained the same DBH in 1 × 1 m spacing. Increased spacing levels decreased the relative amount of growth allocated to the bole of the tree. Marketable biomass yield was highest with 1 × 1 m spacing. Spacing of 3 × 0.75 m produced marketable biomass comparable to that of 1 × 1 m and greater proportion of stems with more than 5 cm diameter. Leucaena can be grown at 3 × 0.75 m spacing either for pulpwood or fuelwood depending on the prevailing market prices and demand. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Compost derived from mix manures, shopped Leucaena leucocephala de Wit, bran of rice, molace, fish fermented juice were studied their humification process by using humic acid quantity and its functional groups, which were phenolic and carboxylic groups. Samples were collected for all analysis at day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 49, 63, 77, 91, 105, and 119. The results showed that the maturity of compost could be divided into 4 steps - the initial phase (day 0), thermophilic phase (day 1-34), end of active phase (day 35), and mature compost (36 days up). After 35 days of mixing, the highest amounts of humic acid, 280.1 mg/g occurred and was higher than the others 4.7-19.9 folds. The relationship of the amounts of phenolic acid during the period of mixing significantly correlated with the total acidity and showed the highest amounts at day 35 as well (r = 0.98; p<0.01) while the amounts of carboxylic acid were not (p>0.01). Pearson correlation coefficients among the four major elements of humic acid: carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) showed that the amounts of O significantly negatively correlated with C and H while C and H were significantly positively correlated to each other (r<0.01). This also supported the appearance of phenolic-OH which contained high C and H and were mostly found in varieties of humic acids while carboxylic group having high O usually was found less. The highest amount of phenolic-OH was also at day 35. Therefore, both humic acid and its functional groups could be applied to estimate the humification process of the compost and helped to select the appropriate day to use compost as fertilizer. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala leaves supplementation resulted in a higher live weight gain and better FCR in goats than those supplemented with Gliricidia sepium and Melia azardirachta leaves. It may be concluded that Leucaena leaves can be used as supplemented feeds to increase feed efficiency in Black Bengal goats. However, optimum level of dietary Leucaena and the extent to which Leucaena can replace concentrate are to be determined.

AB  - The comparative effect of dual inoculation of native N fixer (Rhizobium) and AM fungi consortia with different organic fertilizers (vermicompost and farm yard manure) on fodder production and quality of two leguminous tree species (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de. Wit. and Sesbania sesban (L.) Merr.) in silvopastoral system and their impact on the fodder production of un-inoculated Panicum maximum Jacq. under cut and carry system. After three years of plantation maximum tree survival was in L. leucocephala in all the treatments in comparison to S. sesban while fodder production was more in S. sesban for initial two years and in third year it accelerated in L. leucocephala. Dual inoculation with vermicompost significantly improved fodder production, fodder quality and rhizosphere microflora in L. leucocephala but in S. sesban dual inoculation was at par with single inoculation of N fixer, AM fungi and control (without inoculation). The grass production was higher with L. leucocephala for two years while in third year it was more with S. sesban. The association of Rhizobium with AM fungi in L. leucocephala was better than in S. sesban. © 2011 Triveni Enterprises.

AB  - Hot-dry Valley of Jinsha River is one of the typical serious degenerated regions, The area has abundant sunshine, rich heat resource, low precipitation but high evaporation which leads to severe soil water deficit during the dry season. The adverse environment resulted in lower biological productivity and difficulty in vegetation. A lot of studies proved that vegetation restoration is an effective approach of ecosystem restoration in the dry-hot valleys of Jinsha River. Using double-rings method, principal component analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, the characteristics of soil infiltration and water-holding capacity of three kinds of vegetation restoration models(taking bare land for comparison) were studied in Xiaokuashan watershed of Yuanmou Dry-hot Valley, Yunnan Province. The results indicated that: {circled digit one}Soil saturated water storage, water-holding capacity of non-capillary porosity and water-holding capacity of capillary porosity were all shown as the sequence of Tamarindus indica L. + Paspalum notatum Flugge (1317. 0, 118. 5, 1198. 5 t/hm2) > Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (1152.0, 99.0, 1053.0 t/hm2)> Heteropogon contortus (L.) Beauv. (1108.5, 89.5, 1029.0 t/hm2) > bare land (954.0, 66.0, 888.0 t/hm2). The improvement function played by each model on water-holding capacity of non-capillary porosity was greater than that played by corresponding model on water-holding capacity of capillary porosity. {circled digit two}Infiltration eigenvalues of three models and bare land were shown as initial infiltration rate (T. indica L. + P. notatum Flugge: 7mm/min; H. contortus (L.) Beauv.: 8. 37mm/min; L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit:6. 01mm/min; bare land:0. 62mm/min) >average infiltration rate (T. indica L. + P. notatum Flugge:5. 93mm/min; H. contortus (L.) Beauv.: 5.06mm/min; L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit:3. 94mm/min; bare land:0. 53mm/min) > stable infiltration rate(T. indica L. + P. notatum Flugge:4. 94mm/min; H. contortus (L.) Beauv.: 2.88mm/min; L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit:3. 29mm/min; bare land:0. 27mm/min). Wether in dry season or rainy season, we can integrate estimation about soil permeability values (F) by principal component analysis, soil permeability of different models was presented as T. indica L. + P. notatum Flugge (F:1.2271)> H. contortus (L.) Beauv. (F:0.5365) > L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (F:0.2688) > bare land (F: -2. 0323). {circled digit three}Pearson correlation analysis showed that permeability of three models and bare land had a significant positive linear correlation with soil total porosity, non-capillary porosity and the organic matter content, and a significant negative linear correlation with soil bulk density. Based on which dominant-factor equations were established. {circled digit four} General empirical model was the best one to describe the soil infiltration processes of this area.

AB  - In the industrial and commercial sectors of the Araripe Region in Pernambuco, Brazil, fire wood is the used in processes of dehydration and production of gypsum with different technologies. Thus, this study aimed to find alternatives to supply the demand of firewood in the Gypsun Pole of Araripe in Pernambuco through the implementation of forest with native and exotic species. The experiment was installed at the Experimental Station of the Agronomic Institute of Pernambuco (IPA), using nine species, both native and exotic: (Imburana - Amburana cearense (Allemão) A.C. Sm.; Angico - Anadenanthera colubrina (Vell.) Brenan var. cebil (Griseb.) Altschul; Jurema - Mimosa tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir.; Sabiá - Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth.; Acácia - Senna siamea (Lam.) H.S. Irwin & Barneby; Leucena - Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) R. de Wit.; Algaroba - Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) D.C.; Ipês - Tabebuia sp.1 e Tabebuia sp.2). The design was completely randomized with different numbers of replications. The following parameters were evaluated: Volume in cubic meter (m3) and stereo meters (st) and survival. With regard to the volume in cubic meter, Sabia had the best production. The Jurema and the Sabiá were the heaviest species. In relation to survival, the Ipê 2 and the Imburana had the highest mortalities. Thus, the Sabiá and the Jurema are the species indicated for the production of wood in homogeneous commercial plantations in the Chapada Araripe in Pernambuco.

AB  - Leaf samples of Cassia auriculata and Leucaena Leucocephala were collected from in and around Gandhigram Rural University, Gandhigram, Dindigul, and Tamilnadu, India. The collected leaf samples were predecomposed for 15 days by sprinkling water and regular turning. Two earthworm species such as Eudrilus eugeniae (Kinberg) and Eisenia fetida (Savigny) were used for the study. The vermicomposting trial was made with two leaf samples mixed with cowdung in 1:1:2 ratio using two earthworm species separately for Treatment I and Treatment II. The physico-chemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium were analyzed in different day intervals (0, 15,30,45,60 d). After 60 days the compost was used for 7 day growth studies of Vigna unguiculata L.walp. On 45th day Ec (2.00), organic carbon (35.21 percent) and NPK (1.51, 1.03, 0.71 percent) values were high in the treatment with E.fetida than in treatment with is. eugeniae and in control. The results of plant growth studies on 7th day showed that the germination percentage (100), shoot length (12.71±1.62 cm), root length( 2.5 ±2.87 cm), number of leaves (4.6±1.14), fresh weight of the whole plant(0.86±0.23 g) and dry weight of the whole plant(0.06± 0.02 g) were also significantly enhanced by the compost prepared using E.fetida.

AB  - The objectives of the current study were, firstly to determine the molecular weight of condensed tannins (CTs) of 62-2-8 Leucaena-hybrid Bahru (LLB) and relating it to its protein binding ability, using the local Leucaena leucocephala (LLL) as control and; secondly to evaluate the effect of different levels of CTs of the hybrid LLB on rumen fermentation parameters, including dry matter and nitrogen digestibility and methane gas production. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of purified CTs extracted from hybrid LLB and local LLL, determined using gel permeation chromatography were near similar, being 2737 and 2872Da, respectively. However, the CTs of the hybrid LLB exhibited stronger protein binding ability than the local LLL (0.305 and 0.420mg, respectively, for LLB and LLL to bind half maximum bovine serum albumin). The above results seems to suggest that molecular mass of CTs, at least for Leucaena forages, is not the sole factor in determining their capability to bind protein. Inclusion of about 20-40mg of CT/g DM of the CTs from hybrid LLB effectively decreased (P<0.05) methane production and in vitro nitrogen digestibility. The above results suggested a potential of using CTs from the hybrid LLB to protect dietary protein from rumen degradation for better utilization in the small intestine of ruminant animals, and in addition to mitigate their enteric methane emission, often implicated as a source of greenhouse gases. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Excessive salt can to promote water soil retention, reducing your availability to plants. Besides, they can interfere in protoplasm metabolism. The plants ability to survive in salinity conditions is an important factor to geographic distribution and agriculture in salinized regions. The objective of this work was to verify the effects of the NaCl in the growth, dry matter distribution and N, K, Ca, Mg, Na, and Cl content in young plants. The experiment was conducted in 'Leonard' pots, with nutrient solutions, with NaCl (0, 25, 50 and 100 mmol L-1). Increasing of NaCl concentration reduces growth and total dry matter. There was an increase of N and K content, in shoots, and N and Mg content in roots. There was an reduction in Mg content in shoots, and reduction of Ca content in roots with increasing of NaCl. Leucaena plants were inefficient to exclude Na and Cl, in shoots principally.

AB  - The aim of this field investigation was to study the enrichment of biodiversity of the slope at an early phase of succession, initiated by selected pioneers, and to study how this enrichment related to enhancement of the slope stability. Four experimental plots, with differing plant pioneers and number of species (diversity), were designed in order to assess the effects of plant succession on slope stability. Plant growth pattern was assessed by observing the increment in species diversity (number), species frequency and plant biomass. Higher vegetation biomass in a mixed culture situation (LLSS) in the field with Leucaena leucocephala as a pioneer, marked an increase in species diversity after 24 months of observation. In contrast, G (grasses and legume creepers) plot revealed the slowest rate of succession and the lowest above-ground biomass amongst the plots. The mixed-culture plot without L. leucocephala (SS) had also shown a lower biomass, a similar phenomenon observed in a plot grown by L. leucocephala (LL) with low plant diversity. Consequently, these plant growth patterns gave a positive effect on slope stability where the regression study showed that the shear strength was much affected by plant biomass. Meanwhile, throughout the succession process in LLSS plot, root length density reached the highest value amongst the plots, 23Kmm-3. In relation to this, the saturation level of the slope indicates the unsaturated condition of the soil which resulted in the enhancement of both soil penetrability and soil shear strength of the plot. These attributes reveal a strong positive relationship between the process of natural succession and the stability of slopes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The selection and use of appropriate plant materials to maintain a sufficiently high nutrient supply to meet crop needs remains a major challenge of nutrient management under low input systems. Therefore, research on plant biomass quality as it relates to decomposition and nutrient release has become imperative. This research was conducted at the Agroforestry Research Station of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana to determine the decomposition and nutrient release patterns of Tithonia diversifolia, a rarely used non-traditional species but of research interest in soil fertility improvement practices in Ghana. The decomposition and nutrient release patterns of T. diversifolia was compared with Sennaspectabilis, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia auriculiformis which are commonly used in biomass transfer systems. Results of the study confirmed significantly high N, P, K concentrations in T. diversifolia comparable to levels recorded for the four leguminous species. In addition, T. diversifolia recorded the highest percent decomposition and nutrient release rates which differed significantly (P < 0.05) from rates of the four leguminous species. It was apparent from the study that decomposition and nutrient release rates of species are related to quality of leaf material. Phosphorus and Mg concentration in particular were most influential in decomposition and nutrient release based on significant results. For this reason, it would be imperative to consider the concentrations of P and Mg among other factors in selecting high quality plant materials for green manuring. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Cell microarrays with culture sites composed of individually removable microstructures or micropallets have proven benefits for isolation of cells from a mixed population. The laser energy required to selectively remove these micropallets with attached cells from the array depends on the microstructure surface area in contact with the substrate. Laser energies sufficient to release micropallets greater than 100 μm resulted in loss of cell viability. A new three-dimensional culture site similar in appearance to a table was designed and fabricated using a simple process that relied on a differential sensitivity of two photoresists to UV-mediated photopolymerization. With this design, the larger culture area rests on four small supports to minimize the surface area in contact with the substrate. Microtables up to 250×250 μm were consistently released with single 10-μJ pulses to each of the four support structures. In contrast, microstructures with a 150× 150-μm surface area in contact with the substrate could not be reliably released at pulse energies up to 212 μJ. Cassie- Baxter wetting is required to provide a barrier of air to localize and sequester cells to the culture sites. A second asset of the design was an increased retention of this air barrier under conditions of decreased surface tension and after prolonged culture of cells. The improved air retention was due to the hydrophobic cavity created beneath the table and above the substrate which entrapped air when an aqueous solution was added to the array. The microtables proved an efficient method for isolating colonies from the array with 100% of selected colonies competent to expand following release from the array. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - Contour hedgerow is considered as an effective way of sustainable development of agroecosystem in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. To evaluate the effects of contour hedgerow on soil physical properties, soil properties from different contour hedgerow systems were analyzed. The results showed that soil non-capillary porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, saturated water content and natural water content in the hedgerows treatments were higher than in the rock ridge terrace treatment, while the soil bulk density and field moisture capacity in the hedgerows treatments were lower than in the rock ridge terrace treatment. Based on the same depth, with the extending of the distance to hedgerows (ridge), for the hedgerows treatments soil bulk density and natural water content increased gradually, and soil non-capillary porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity and saturated water content decreased gradually, while no apparent change for the rock ridge terrace treatment. With the deepening of the soil layer, for each treatment soil bulk density and natural water content increased gradually, and soil non-capillary porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity and saturated water content decreased gradually accordingly, and their differences among treatments were also lessened gradually. The distance to hedgerow reflected the degree of effects on soil water and physical properties by hedgerow indirectly. The closer to hedgerow, the greater the effects were. Comparing treatments of white popinac and negundo chaste tree, their effects were equivalent.

AB  - This study focuses on applying remote sensing technique and landscape indices to analyze the landscape structure and the dispersal change of Leucaena leucocephala, and also monitor landscape change in Penghu islands and Henchun peninsula. The research processes include generating the land-use map and the spatial distribution map of Leucaena leucocephala using SPOT images; calculating the quantified landscape indices for analyzing the landscape structure and the dispersal change of Leucaena leucocephala using the FRAGSTATS program; and finally applying the Shannon diversity test to investigate if the landscape structure at both areas are significantly affected by the dispersal change of Leucaena leucocephala. The result is as follows. The land-use classification obtained from Penghu and Hengchun area includes 6 land-use types. The overall classification accuracy in Penghu area was 88.9% in 1993 and 86.8% in 2005, while Hengchun area was 88.41% in 1994 and 86.6% in 2006. The dispersal trend of Leucaena leucocephala within 12 years is in the direction of northeast and southwest, but a slight difference in Penghu and Henchun area. In addition, Leucaena leucocephala did not invade natural forests at high elevation area. As for monitoring landscape change based on Shannon diversity t-test, the result indicated that the landscape at both areas was affected by the dispersal change of Leucaena leucocephala. The result obtained from this study could be a reference for forest units to control the dispersal of Leucaena leucocephala and prevent an ecological crisis at both areas.

AB  - The study deals with phytoextraction of Zn and Cd by Leucaena leucocephala grown on effluent fed and lownitrogen soils collected from S1, S2, and S3 sites, representing decreasing metal content with increasing distance from the effluent drain. Plant nitrogen fixation potential and soil micro-biochemical attributes against metal stress were also assessed. Increasing soil metal content and plant growth enhanced metal accumulation. Relatively greater amount of Zn than Cd was accumulated by L. leucocephala, which exceeded in roots with that of other parts. Remediation factor for Cd was maximum (3.6%) in S2 grown plant. Nodule numbers, their biomass, nitrogenase activity, and leghaemoglobin contentwere maximum in plants grown in S3 andminimum in S1 soil havingmaximummetals.Maximum soil organic C, total N, Cmic, and Nmic, respiration rate, ATP content, and enzymatic activities in response to phytoremediation was recorded in S3 followed by S2 and S1. Phytoremediation for a year enhanced extractable Zn and Cd by 36% and 45%, and their total removal by 20% and 30%, respectively from S2, which suggests the possible application of L. leucocephala for the remediation of metal contaminated sites and their fertility restoration by improving microbial functionalities and N-pool. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Cancer is actually a group of many related diseases that all have to do with cells. Cells are the very small units that make up all living things, including the human body. There are billions of cells in each person's body. Cancer happens when cells that are not normal grow and spread very fast. Normal body cells grow and divide and know to stop growing. Over time, they also die. Unlike these normal cells, cancer cells just continue to grow and divide out of control and don't die when they're supposed to. A number of synthetic anticancer drugs are available in practice, however their effectiveness does not hold true with the entire range of population suffering from this disorder. Moreover the side effects and the drug interactions are major restrictions in its clinical utility. On the other hand, herbal medicines are now attracting attention as potential sources of anticancer agents are widely used across the globe due to their wide applicability and therapeutic efficacy coupled with least side effects, which in turn has accelerated the scientific research regarding the anticancer activity. In this overview we have summarized the current research advancements on plants belongs to different families like Apocyanaceae, Taxaceae, Beriberidaceae, Solanaceae, Cupressaceae etc. having anticancer activities along with their other activities.

AB  - In 4 separate feeding trials, 4 adult male Muzzafarnagari sheep (mean weight of 26.8± 2.0 kg) were fed mixtures of Dichanthium annulatum (DA) grass and leaves of Helictris isora (HI), Securenegia virosa (SV), Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Hardwickia binnata (HB), in 75:25 ratios (DM basis) for 90 days on each diet. Feed intake, nutrient utilization, rumen metabolites and rumen water kinetics were measured. LL had highest CP concentration (20.6%) and HB the lowest CP (11.2%) of the tree leaves, while grass ranged from 4.4 to 5.4% across the feeding trials. Dry matter intake was higher (P<0.05) on DA-HI (3.3% bodyweight and 74.0 g/kgW0.75) than on other diets. DM, CP, NDF, ADF and cellulose digestibility was higher (P<0.05) on DA-HI and DA-SV than DA-HB diet. Faecal N loss was (P<0.05) higher on DA-LL and DA-HB, while urinary N excretion was (P<0.05) more on DA-HI diet. Sheep was in negative N balance on DA-HB diet. Meal size (g/h, % body wt/h and g/kgw0.75/h) was higher (P<0.05) on DA-HI and DA-SV than DA-HB diet. Eating rate (g/h) was higher on DA-HI diet and lowest on DA-HB for 1st and 4th h of eating. In the last 7 and 17 h of feeding sheep eating rate was more on DA-LL and lowest on DA-HB. TVFA and N metabolites concentration was higher (P<0.05) on DA-LL than other diets. Out flow rate (l/d) was more in sheep on DA-HI than other diets, while rumen volume was comparable (P>0.05) on diets. Results revealed that sheep had higher intake, more nutrients digestibility and optimum rumen metabolites concentration on DA-HI and DA-SV diets while feeding of DA-HB diet lowered nutrients digestibility and rumen metabolites production in sheep.

AB  - To evaluate the in vitro digestibility of forage legume from semi-arid northeast region using caecal inoculum liquor of ostriches with Reverse Tilley and Terry technique, the alfalfa hay (Medicago sativa) was used as reference food for comparison between hays of canephori (Senna multijuga), clitoria (Clitoria ternatea), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), kills pasture (Senna obtusifolia) and thrush (Mimosacaesalpiniifolia). There was, by Duncan test (P<0.05), significant difference to in vitro digestibility of the nutritional fractions among the legume hays resulting in general mean value of 49.62% for dry matter (DIVMS), of 23.38% for crude protein (DIVPB), of 17.88% for insoluble protein in neutral detergent fiber (DIVPIDN), of 34.52% for neutral detergent fiber (DIVFDN) and of 42.07% for neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein (DIVFDNcp). The nutritional composition of feedstuffs influenced the fermentative activity of microorganisms from cecum-colon of ostriches in these in vitro incubations, and the better digestibility values were observed for alfalfa hay, followed by kills pasture and leucaena hays, wich were higher than other legumes from semi-arid.

AB  - The wetting behavior of water nanodroplets on homogeneous and phase separated self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) composed of CH3(CH 2)10SH and HOCH2(CH2)10SH on Au(111) was studied using molecular dynamics simulation. A simple model is introduced for the SAM where only the top eight or ten atomic layers are considered. For the homogeneous monolayers the CH3- and HOCH 2-terminated chains are uniformly mixed. With χp denoting the mole fraction of HOCH2-terminated chains, we report the equilibrium contact angles of water droplets composed of 4000 molecules on homogeneous monolayers for χp = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. Good agreement is seen between the simulation results and experimental data for millimetre-size drops. For χp = 0.5, the contact angle and base diameter of the droplet are found to be 51.9 ± 1.3°and 10.2 ± 0.2 nm, respectively. Large deviations from the Cassie model are observed while the Israelachvili-Gee equation gives a better prediction. For the monolayers with χp = 0 and 0.25, we estimate the line tension through the drop-size dependence of the contact angle and find good agreement with theoretical predictions. For the phase separated monolayers, the HOCH 2-terminated chains are organized into randomly-located circular domains which are embedded in a background matrix of CH3-terminated chains. With χp = 0.5, we consider two domain sizes with the diameters of the small and large domains being 1 and 2 nm. The water contact angle is found to be 63.1°for the monolayer with small domains and 68.1°for the monolayer with large domains. The results for the homogeneous and phase separated monolayers with χp = 0.5 indicate that the nanoscale wetting behavior of the SAM is sensitive to its nanostructure. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Framework species are indigenous tree species planted in a mixed stand to accelerate natural regeneration of forest and encourage biodiversity regeneration. In this study we used the framework species method to make multipurpose tree gardens to provide traditional healers with woody species used for medicine and other needs like food and firewood. We specifically determined the phenology, germination behaviour, survival and growth after planting 19 indigenous and 8 introduced woody species. The species were planted in a mixed stand together at a density of 3125 ha-1. Field performance was assessed by monitoring survival, height and crown width once every month for 13 months after planting. Eleven species (Artocarpus heterophyllus, Calliandra calothyrsus, Callistemon citrinus, Carica papaya, Carissa spinarum, Leucaena leucocephala, Markhamia lutea, Sarcocephalus latifolius, Senna siamea, S. spectabilis and Terminalia schimperiana) proved to be excellent framework species. Eight species qualified as 'acceptable' FWS (Albizia coriaria, Ceiba pentranta, Entada abyssinica, Erythrina abyssinica, Eugenia jambos, Ficus sycomorus, Maesopsis eminii and Milicia excelsa), while seven species were ranked as 'marginally acceptable' (Acacia macrothyrsa, Calpurnia aurea, Canarium schweinfurthii, Capparis tomentosa, Ficus natalensis, Senna sp. and Warburgia salutaris). Annona squamosa was the only species rejected since both germination and survival was low. Trees with good reforestation traits could be recommended for planting while the species that were marginally acceptable or rejected require extra research since some of them are important medicinal woody species of conservation concern. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The field experiment was carried out at Regional Agricultural Research Station, Bijapur, during 2008 to 2010 to evaluate performance of four grasses and three legumes grown in association with subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) in shallow vertisols of northern dry zone of Karnataka. Among the grass species Guinea grass var. Samruddhi recorded maximum plant height (112.33 cm during 2008-09 and 107.47 cm during 2009-10) and green fodder yield (22.40 Mt ha 1 during 2008-09 and 29.80 Mt ha1 during 2009-10) followed by Guinea grass var. Nandini, Rhodes grass and Anjan grass. Among the legumes, Stylosanthus ciabrana showed higher yield (9.70 Mt ha1and 12.30 Mt ha1) and plants per m2 (33.83 and 34.28), but more height was recorded in Stylosanthus scabra (62.30 cm and 63.69 cm during 2008-09 and 2009-10, respectively) at a light intensity ratio of 72.10% and 69.58%, respectively. No significant differences were observed for different silvicultural parameters. However, the economic analysis in terms of gross returns exhibited similar trends in line with the performance of different forage components.

TI  - Reproductive capacities and development of a seed bruchid beetle, Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus, a potential host for the mass rearing of the parasitoid, Dinarmus basalis
PY  - 2010

AB  - The reproductive capacities and development of the seed beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), found in Togo, were determined under natural conditions in a Guinean zone for its use as a substitute host for the mass rearing of the parasitoid Dinarmus basalts Rond (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), a biological agent for the control of beetles that are pests of cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walpers (Fabales: Fabaceae). Population dynamics at the field level; and survival, fecundity and offspring production by A. macrophthalmus under laboratory conditions were measured when fed on its natural plant-host Leucaena leucocephala (Lamark) deWit (Fabales: Mimosaceae). The data resulting from the laboratory study were used to calculate the demographic parameters of A. macrophthalmus by establishing its fertility and life tables. Contrary to cultivated leguminous food plants, L. leucocephala is a perennial sub-spontaneous leguminous plant whose pods are available year round. Although A. macrophthalmus was present in nature throughout the year, its infestation rate of the pods fluctuated according to the phenology of the plant. The maximum infestation of L. leucocephala pods was observed between August and December. Four larval stages and one pupal stage of A. macrophthalmus were identified in the laboratory. The total mean development time varied on average 33.75 ± 2.87 days on the mature pods and 33.39 ± 2.02 days on seeds. The adult female lived from one to two weeks. During its life time, the female laid an average of 62.3 ± 19 and 43.1 ± 13 eggs on the mature pods and seeds respectively and produced an average of 36.7 ± 11.3 offspring on the mature pods and 21.8 ± 8.4 offspring on seeds. On seeds, the net reproduction rate was 5.88 females per female and the intrinsic rate of population increase 0.051 per day. The generation time was 34.59 days and the doubling time 13.59 days. The demographic parameters of A. macrophthalmus in this study are close to those of Callobruchus maculatus F. (Bruchidae), the natural host of D. basalts in a previous study. A. macrophthalmus could therefore be used as substitute host for the mass rearing of D. basalts and subsequently its release in farmers' storage containers. The data presented in this study provide some baseline information regarding the reproductive capacities of A. macrophthalmus that may be useful for its promotion as a substitute host for mass rearing of D. basalts.

PY  - 2011

AB  - In this paper, wettability behavior of a rough but intrinsically hydrophilic oxide ceramic, formed via simple thermal oxidation of a commercial metallic alloy in laboratory air, has been analyzed. Drop shape analysis (DSA) revealed static water contact angles for the rough ceramic surfaces up to 128° (greater than for Teflon™). We propose the high apparent contact angles to be a result of surface roughening via the morphological changes of the oxide scale with oxidation conditions. The surface morphological changes occurring during the growth of the oxide film resulted in the formation of vertical platelets that ably shifted the wetting behavior from a Wenzel to an unstable Cassie-Baxter state. The platelet morphology of the ceramic resembles the structure of epicuticular waxes on certain species of superhydrophobic leaves. Moreover, surface textures for very short oxidation times were also found to increase hydrophilicity in the scale and reduce the contact angle by imparting a Wenzel state. Various characterization techniques (XRD, XPS, and SEM) were performed in order to detect the crystallographic phases in the scales, analyze carbon content and determine the morphology of the oxide layer. Morphological features of the oxide platelets were quantified and platelet width, spacing and height were found to correlate well with the apparent contact angle trend as a function of oxidation time. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the nutritional potential and concentrations of antinutritional factors of mixed local fodder diets for goats supplemented with two exotic species namely Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium. A total of five diets were formulated, arranged and analyzed in a completely randomized design with three replicates. The three years (2007, 2008 and 2009) of sample collection and analyses constituted the three replicates. Significant means were separated using Duncan's Multiple Range test. Significant variations (p<0.05) were observed among diets in the proximate, mineral and antinutritional factor compositions. Diets supplemented with the exotic leguminous species had higher protein and mineral contents than the locally - mixed fodder diets (TD), with content increasing with increased supplementation level. Although supplementation of local fodder diets with exotic species is highly recommended, however, further studies on appropriate methods of detoxifying the antinutritionalfactors as well as feeding levels of the toxic species are inevitable.

AB  - Near-infrared spectroscopy has been used to develop calibration models for the rapid determination of kraft pulp yield (KPY) and lignin in Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Leucaena leucocephala. The correlation coefficient for cross-validation is 0.90 for KPY and 0.95 for lignin prediction, while the root mean square error for cross-validation for KPY and lignin prediction are 1.46 and 0.77, respectively. The method has been validated with 37 samples of E. camaldulensis and 18 samples of L. leucocephala. The root mean square error of prediction for KPY (1.53) is higher than for lignin (0.77). The method is rapid and can be used for screening a large number of samples. © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - The present studies were undertaken to evaluate the effect of hydrolysable (HT) and condensed tannins (CT) (at the rate of 1 mg per 26 mg crude protein) on ruminal degradability of protein in locally available tree forages using in vitro gas and ammonia (NH3) production method. The NH3-N content after 24 h incubation decreased with added starch. Gas production (24h) decreased with added HT and CT for all forages except in Albizia stipulata. In vitro ruminal disappearance of nitrogen (IVRDN) calculated by linear regression in untreated forages was observed to be highest (63.2 %) for Grewia optiva and lowest 0 %) for Quercus incana. With added tannins, IVRDN values varied from 4.8% (Acacia lakoocha) to 33.2% (Grewia optiva). Addition of HT resulted in increase in IVRDN values of Acacia catechu, Albizia stipulata, Bauhinia variegata, Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, Ficus roxburghii, Leucaena leucocephala, Morus alba and Quercus incana. Comparatively, addition of HT was more effective in increasing IVRDN than CT. However, the IVRDN values when calculated with blank for NH3-N without added HT decreased with addition of HT in all the forage samples. Tree forages with added CT exhibited an inconsistent response for IVRDN values. The values were maximum (34.4 %) for Morus alba and minimum (6.5 %) for Quercus incana. The correlation between IVRDN and fiber bound tannins was non-significant but positive and significant (P<0.02) between IVRDN and CP content of the forages. A higher slope in the regression equations observed in presence of tannins indicated higher uptake of ammonia by ruminal microbes and possibly to increased microbial protein synthesis.

AB  - The influence of 4 tropical grasses [Panicum maximum, Andropogon gayanus broad- (BL) and narrow-leaf (NL) types and Pennisetum purpureum] and 6 legumes (Aeschynomene histrix, Stylosanthes fruticosa, Centrosema pubescens, Mucuna pruriens var. utilis, Cajanus cajan and Leucaena leucocephala) on fertility of the topsoil in the Sudanian region of Benin over 3 years was investigated. The plants were sown without fertiliser, harvested under a cut-and-carry regime and soil changes were compared with those under a natural fallow. Soil samples were collected before the study commenced and at the end of the 3-year study. These were analysed for pH, organic C, N, available P and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K and Na). N, P and K contents of aerial parts were determined to estimate the exports of these elements. For the grasses, root biomass, depth and distribution were also measured. Three years after grasses and legumes were sown, the pH under the grasses (6.6-6.7) was higher than under the legumes (6.2-6.3) and C and N concentrations had declined from the initial levels. Owing to their deep rooting systems, A. gayanus BL and P. maximum, and probably C. cajan and L. leuco- cephala, appeared able to recycle nutrients from deeper soil layers. While these species could be used for ley pastures in savannah regions of west Africa, maintenance fertiliser applications would be required to prevent nutrient depletion under a cut-and-carry regime. Further studies to test the efficacy of farmyard manure in providing these nutrients and to examine the growth of the legumes when inoculated with appropriate rhizobia seem warranted.

AB  - The fermentation of Pennisetum purpureum, alone (PP) or substituted with 0.30 of the tanniferous legumes Acacia cornigera (AC), Albizia lebbekoides (AL), Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and the saponin-rich Enterolobium cyclocarpum (EC) was studied in vitro, in presence or absence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as tannin binder. Inactivation of tannins with PEG increased (p < 0.05) gas production with AL and LL from 8 and 12 h to the end of the incubation period respectively. When PEG was added, LL and AC promoted a higher (p < 0.05) gas volume than PP in the first 12 h incubation, and there were not differences between PP and AL. Substrate mixtures reduced (p < 0.05) methane volume produced compared with PP, but this was not related to PEG inclusion (p > 0.10). There was a trend (p = 0.06) for a higher 48 h bacterial attachment to the substrate when incubated without PEG. The decrease in fermentation of EC from 12 h incubation onwards could be associated with a negative mid-term effect of saponins over cellulolytic bacterial activity. It is concluded that the effects of tannins on microbial fermentation of mixed forage substrates are variable, depending on their nature, but do not have a marked impact on bacterial adhesion or methane production. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

AB  - Peroxidase was purified to homogeneity from a tree legume Leucaena leucocephala. On SDS-PAGE the purified enzyme exhibited two distinct subunits each of 66 and 58 kDa. Determination of native molecular weight of the purified peroxidase revealed a size of ∼200 kDa suggesting a heterotrimeric structure (consisting of two subunits of 66 kDa and one subunit of 58 kDa) for native peroxidase. Purified peroxidase was found to be a glycoprotein (0.09 mg carbohydrates per mg purified peroxidase protein). Purified enzyme exhibited pH optimum of 5.0 and temperature optimum of 55 °C. The Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) for guaiacol, H2O2, were found to be 2.9 and 5.6 mM, respectively. Divalent cations namely, Ca2+ and Mn 2+ activated peroxidase at lower concentration (up to 50 mM) while inhibited at higher concentration. Monovalent cation namely Na+ did not inhibit peroxidase at concentration as high as 4 M. L. leucocephala peroxidase was found to be unique as it was not inhibited by azide. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land use influences physico-chemical and water transmission properties of soil, which ultimately determine the suitability of land for different purposes. In present study, impact of different land use (forest and agriculture) on selected physicochemical and hydrological properties of soil was evaluated and compared with a reference site (uncultivated ravinous wasteland). Land use influenced infiltration rate, bulk density, mean weight diameter of aggregates and plant available water of soils. After 25 years of plantation of forest species, soil organic carbon content increased by more than twofold and mean weight diameter of aggregates by 2- to 6-fold in comparison to reference site. Significant reduction in soil bulk density (4-18%) and increase in steady state infiltration rate (1.5-2 times) was observed under the forest land use system. Conversion of ravine to forest system resulted in significant improvement in moisture retention capacity of soil. Conversion of ravine landform to agriculture adversely affected the soil bulk density and infiltration rate. The study provided practical information regarding rehabilitation potential of different tree species (Prosopis juliflora, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia nilotica and Azadirachta indica) that could be used for restoration of ustifluvent soil susceptible to gully erosion in the semi-arid region. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Use of a virtual wall valve in polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic devices for bioanalytical applications
PY  - 2011

AB  - A simple method for micromanipulation of liquids and/or small groups of cells is presented in this study. Microfabricated sieving structures composed of PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) were used to segregate aqueous solutions. This microfluidic valving scheme was an application of Cassie-Baxter wetting and was termed "virtual walls" as a nonsolid barrier exists at an air/water interface. The manipulation of the virtual-air-wall valve was accomplished by controlling the strength of surface-tension and hydrostatic-pressure forces. Virtual walls with a range of feature sizes were designed and characterized by monitoring air and water displacement in response to hydrostatic pressure. Thresholds for the virtual-air-wall valves to be turned on or off were quantified. The walls could also be formed or dissipated by the focused microbeam of a pulsed laser. As an illustration of the virtual wall utility, a series of microfluidic applications were demonstrated. First, the capability of virtual walls to temporarily segregate liquids was integrated into a device utilized to establish a chemical gradient. In a second application, the arraying of nonadherent cells within individual aqueous cavities created by the virtual walls was demonstrated. Individual cells were also released from the cavities on demand using a focused microbeam. The virtual walls were simple and easy-to-fabricate without the requirement for surface treatment or precision alignment, and should find usage in bioanalytical applications. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Eighteen crossbred (Thai native x Anglo-Nubian) goats were chosen from a commercial farm on the basis of similar body weight (17.0±3.8kg). The goats were randomly allocated to three treatments in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). Each goat was given corn silage as roughage plus the respective treatment diets. The diets were lso-mtrogenous and iso-energetic containing cassava pulp, molasses, urea and commercial mineral and vitamin mix. The experimental treatments were Soybean Meal (SBM), partial substitution of SBM with Neem (Azadirachta indicd) fodder or partial substitution of SBM with Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) fodder. Nutrients intakes, ruminal characteristics (pH, ammonia nitrogen and volatile fatty acids), nitrogen balances, plasma urea nitrogen were not significantly different among treatments. The present results indicate that protein foliages locally grown shrubs and trees can substitute imported feedstuffs concentrate (e.g., SBM) as protein supplement for goat production. © Medwell Journals, 2010.

AB  - Three newly introduced cultivar/lines of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit.) from Australia (cultivar Tarramba) and Hawaii (lines KU19 and KU66) were compared with current leading cultivars Peru and Cunningham. In 2006-2008, leaf and woody stem production and plant chemical compounds were analyzed for forage and bioenergy utilization. The experiment was conducted at the Kasetsart University Farm, Pak Chong, Nakhon Ratchasima in central Thailand. The results indicated that newly introduced cultivar/lines have a greater dry matter yielding ability than the cultivars Peru and Cunningham. KU19 generated the highest levels of biomass, KU66 was second highest yielder, followed by Tarramba, Cunningham and Peru. Each of the new cultivar/lines produced a superior woody stem yield for biofuel production than Cunningham and Peru. Regarding plant chemical compositions, the new cultivar/lines were similar to Peru and Cunningham, exhibiting an energy value at 4.6-4.7kcalg-1. The cost benefits for farmers to grow Tarramba would result in an increased income and subsequent profit when compared with the current cultivar Peru following this 2-year study. We conclude that the new introduced cultivar/lines of Tarramba, KU19 and KU66 can be a more efficient and a productive energy supplying plant for gasification when compared with currently used cultivars Peru and Cunningham. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - The higher DNA delivery efficiency into plants by gold nanoparticles embedded in sharp carbonaceous carriers is demonstrated. These nanogoldembedded carbon matrices are prepared by heat treatment of biogenic intracellular gold nanoparticles. The DNA-delivery efficiency is tested on a model plant, Nicotiana tabacum, and is further extended to the monocot, Oryza sativa, and a hard dicot tree species, Leucaena leucocephala. These materials reveal good dispersion of the transport material, producing a greater number of CUS foci per unit area. The added advantages of the composite carrier are the lower plasmid and gold requirements. Plant-cell damage with the carbon-supported particles is very minimal and can be gauged from the increased plant regeneration and transformation efficiency compared with that of the commercial micrometer-sized gold particles. This is ascribed to the sharp edges that the carbon supports possess, which lead to better piercing capabilities with minimum damage © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

TI  - The value of Leucaena leucocephala bark in leucaena-grass hay diets for Thai goats
PY  - 2010

AB  - The study assessed the value of Leucaena leucocephala bark in leucaena-grass hay diets fed to Thai goats. Thai goats in metabolism pens were fed diets containing leucaena leaf (55%) + pangola grass hay (hay, 45%); leucaena leaf (48%) + leucaena bark (9%) + hay (43%); leucaena bark (57%) + hay (43%); and hay only. Feed percentages are expressed on a dry weight basis. The digestibilities of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) were measured for the four diets. Leucaena bark had lower CP concentration than the leaf (11.7 vs. 25.9), and the leucaena bark + hay diet had lower DM and CP digestibility than the other diets. The calculated bark digestibilities of DM and CP of 44.1% and 38.2%, respectively, were much lower than the values for the leucaena leaf of 62.9% and 89.1%, respectively. The lower than expected CP digestibility was attributed to higher tannin levels in the bark compared to the leaves. Despite this, the bark was well accepted by the goats and was often preferred to the hay. Stripping of the bark by goats also results in stems that dry quicker and have higher calorific value as fuel. However, if leucaena branches are fed as a sole diet, the goats may consume up to 30% of bark on a DM basis and this would reduce nutritive value and animal productivity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of salinity in the growth and nitrogen fixation in leucaena. Plants were cultivated in Leonard pots containing clean and sterilized sand. The treatments were distributed in a completely randomized design, in a 3×3 factorial, with five replicates. The first factor corresponded to no inoculation and inoculation with Bradyrhizobium sp SEMIA 6070 and SEMIA 6153 strains. The second factor corresponded to NaCl concentrations: 0, 25 and 50 mol m-3. Were analyzed the height and dry matter accumulation, the number of nodules and nitrogen in plants. The inoculation of plants with the strain SEMIA 6070 provided higher growth and greater nitrogen accumulation in plants thar were not subject to salinity. Nodulation was not affected by salinity. Inoculation with SEMIA 6153 strain provided greater tolerance to salinity.

AB  - On oceanic islands, native vegetation disturbed by feral goats has been invaded by an alien shrub, Leucaena leucocephala, after goat removal. We investigated how the distribution of L. leucocephala at the earliest stages of invasion was related to the distance from seed sources and the structure of the herbaceous vegetation. At a fine spatial scale in Nakoudojima Island, Japan, an oceanic island in the western Pacific, we calculated correlations between the presence of L. leucocephala and its distance from a forest dominated by L. leucocephala, the height of the herbaceous vegetation, and the depth of litter accumulation. The occurrences of L. leucocephala plants smaller than 1.3 m in height were negatively correlated with distance from L. leucocephala forest, the height of the herbaceous vegetation, and litter depth. On the other hand, the occurrence of plants larger than 1.3 m in height was correlated only with distance from L. leucocephala forest. Our results suggested that the distribution of smaller individuals of an alien plant at specific sites would be related not only to the distance from its seed sources, but also to the structure of the herbaceous vegetation. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - The study objective was to evaluate the effects of light intensities upon the initial development of Leucaena leucocephala seedlings. The study was conducted inside a preservation area around a drinking water well used to supply Marechal Cândido Rondon residents from September 11th to November 20th, 2007. The seeds collected from mature leucaena trees located on an adjacent county (Toledo) went through break dormancy in vases, in water at 80 Celsius degrees and sown by using 10 units per vase. The vases were distributed in the area obeying an entirely randomized design with 13 light intensities (treatments) and 10 replications (vases), adding up to 130 vases. Five and two seedlings per vase were left after thinning executed 10 and 20 days after the sowing, respectively. Sixty days after the sowing, the seedlings were collected for the measurements of the stem diameter, the plant height, the number and area of leaves as well as the root, the stem and the leaf biomasses. Results indicated that there is a polynomial relationship of the fourth order between biometric parameters and light intensity; the highest significances were calculated for intensities of 643 and 2273 Lux indicating that leucaena can be considered pioneering and tolerant to direct sunlight.

AB  - Twelve taxa under exploration as bioenergy crops in Florida and the U.S. were evaluated for potential invasiveness using the Australian Weed Risk Assessment system (WRA) modified for separate assessment at the state and national scales. When tested across a range of geographies, this system correctly identifies invaders 90%, and non-invaders 70% of the time, on average. Predictions for Florida were the same as for the U.S. Arundo donax, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus grandis, Jatropha curcas, Leucaena leucocephala, Pennisetum purpureum, and Ricinus communis were found to have a high probability of becoming invasive, while Miscanthus × giganteus, Saccharum arundinaceum, Saccharum officinarum, and the sweet variety of Sorghum bicolor have a low probability of becoming invasive. Eucalyptus amplifolia requires further evaluation before a prediction is possible. These results are consistent with reports on other tests of these taxa. Given the economic and ecological impacts of invasive species, including the carbon expended for mechanical and chemical control efforts, cultivation of taxa likely to become invasive should be avoided. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The research aimed at the knowledge on the preference of sheep for Pennisetum purpureum micro silage mixed up with foliage of Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricia sepium and Guazuma ulmifolia. Six hairy sheep (pelibuey race) with an average age of eight months and a weight of 24.6 kg (± 2.3 kg) were used. They were fed with micro-silages (treatments) mixed up with different proportions of tree foliage (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%). Dry matter intake, consumption index and index of preference were evaluated, besides each of the treatments was characterized chemically. A latin square experimental with 6x6 m was used. It was found that values of protein from treatments with fodder trees tended to be higher compared to silage with only Pennisetum purpureum. This supports previous evidences concerning the use of trees improves the quality forage conservation. In the case of treatments based on Guazuma ulmifolia and Gliricidia sepium with 20 and 40% were the most preferred (P<0.05). This was expressed by the higher dry matter intake of animals. However treatments with only grass and only tree forage were the least preferred (P<0.05).

AB  - A study was carried out at Mocochá, Yucatán, México with the objective of determining whether the application of bentazon, imazethapyr or metribuzin would improve postemergence (POST) weed control without damaging a huaxin (leucaena, guaje, leadtree, wild tamarind) {Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit} and insurgente grass (Brachiaria brizantha Richard Stapf) association. In both June 2004 and 2005, insurgente grass (INS) and huaxin (HUA) were seeded in an arrangement of two by one rows, respectively. Herbicide treatments were a single application of bentazon, imazethapyr or metribuzin at three different rates each, and the same herbicides at a single rate but applied sequentially two and three times during the growing season. Metribuzin damaged INS (10 to 95%) and HUA (55 to 100%) in both years. Overall, both forage species were tolerant to bentazon and imazethapyr. In 2004, both bentazon and metribuzin showed a greater weed control (82%) than imazethapyr (70%); in 2005, weed control was similar for all three herbicides (P>0.05), which averaged a moderate 65%. This study shows that an increase in 1,000 kg DM ha-1 of weed biomass, decreases forage yield for this association by 190 kg DM ha-1. Forage yields with bentazon applied three times at a 0.8 kg a.i. ha-1 rate were similar to those in the weed-free control. In tropical areas, bentazon should be an interesting option for weed control in insurgente-huaxin associations.

AB  - Research on the measures to conserve soil water and nutrient in the dry-hot valley areas was conducted in order to realize the vegetation restoration of abandoned dreg site of hydropower station. The experiments indicated that soil in the abandoned dreg site with water retaining agent + water-retaining and slow-released fertilizer could achieve the best effect in compasion with the control. The treatment could stimulate the growth and development of Leucaena leucocephala and improve its survival rate in dry season. The increasing rate in plant height, average leaf number, most leaf area, single weightiness and chlorophyl content increased by 32.74%, 23.86%, 11.51%×14.58%(length×breadth), 53.49% and 7.88% compared with CK. The survival rate of Leucaena leucocephala in dry season increased by 94.97%. The disposals of water retaining agent + water retaining and slow-released fertilizer have certain application value in vegetation restoration of abandoned dreg site of hydropower station in the dry-hot valley.

AB  - With the purpose of evaluating plant height, stem diameter, diameter, number, longitude and diameter of branch, leaves and root quantity of Albizia lebbeck, Leucaena leucocephala, Eritrina fusca, Swietenia macrophylla and Furcraea foetida, an experiment was carried out in the National Institute of Agricultural Research, Trujillo, Venezuela. A completely at random design with time sampling and ten replications by species was used. At the end of evaluation, F. foetida showed the highest plant height (36 cm), stem diameter (1.66 cm), branch diameter (0.78 cm) and branch length (29.92 cm) (P<0.05). However, this specie showed the lowest leaves, branch and root number (3.8, 3.8 and 18, respectively) (P<0.05). The roots length of the evaluated species showed did not showed significant differences among them (18.58-22.54 cm) (P>0.05). Through the principal components analysis could be showed that all variables had high numeric fluctuation except length and root number. In this way, plants height, stem and branches diameter, and branches length showed a negative relationship with leaves, branch and root quantity. The results could conclude that differences on species behavior in nursery are due to each intrinsic morph structural characteristics.

TI  - Complete characterization of bagasse of early species of saccharum officinerum-Co 89003 for pulp and paper making

UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956086106&doi=10.15376%2fbiores.5.2.1197-1214&partnerID=40&md5=ba53e7923b6f921fbc79bdf60afaad86
AB  - Bagasse from early species of Saccharum officinerum-Co 89003 has 71.36% useful, long, and thick-walled fibers with good slenderness ratio, but the rigidity coefficient is less than that of Eucalyptus tereticornis and Leucaena leucocephala. The kink index and kink per mm length are lower in bagasse fiber than E. terticornis, which gives rise to fewer weak points in the fiber. Low alcohol-benzene soluble substances in bagasse induce less pitch problems and favor more homogeneity in the paper. Lignin content in bagasse is comparable to Eucalyptus globulus and Leucaena leucocephala, but α-cellulose, and pentosans are slightly lower. A higher proportion of carbon content compared to hydrogen and oxygen increases the energy value of bagasse. It produces 42.2% pulp yield of kappa number 28.2 at optimum cooking conditions, such as active alkali 12% (as Na2O), temperature 150°C, and time (at temperature) 60 min. An addition of 0.1% anthraquinone at the optimum condition improves pulp yield by 2.6% and mitigates kappa number by 3.9 units.

TI  - Kinetic study on the thermal degradation of a biomass and its compost: Composting effect on hydrogen production
PY  - 2010
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-71549119212&doi=10.1016%2fj.fuel.2009.09.024&partnerID=40&md5=7180be660058ee03c7e56ebafc3d342d
AB  - Compost from vegetable residues is usually used as an organic amendment to soil; however, their thermal degradation characteristics show that it could be used as raw material in air gasification facilities. According to the obtained data, hydrogen production is positively affected by composting, increasing hydrogen concentration in the raw gas from 15.2 to 22.6 vol%. This effect is related with physicochemical changes that occur during thermophilic stage of composting. After this step it does not observes any progress on hydrogen production. On the other hand, in order to compare thermal degradation of a biomass (Leucaena leucocephala) and two composts with different maturation levels, non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) has been used. Under inert atmosphere, data have been adequately simulated assuming three fractions (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) in both biomass and composts. However, under air atmosphere we have used a simplified model that assume two components in biomass (holocellulose and lignin) and three in composts (including humic substances). Using nth-order kinetic equations to describe component degradations, we have calculated a set of kinetic parameters which do not differ of the reported for other lignocellulosic materials. This procedure allows obtaining an approximate composition of samples. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quantitative evaluation of allelopathic potentials in soils: Total activity approach
PY  - 2010
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955618416&doi=10.1614%2fWS-D-09-00085.1&partnerID=40&md5=152e0caa3134cb237ca5aecab14d0429
AB  - The allelopathic potential of a plant has been evaluated on the basis of two indicators: specific activity, which is the specific concentration of the allelochemical to exert a half-maximum effect on a receiver plant (EC50), and total activity in a plant, which is the ratio of the concentration of an allelochemical in the producing plant to its EC50. In the present study, a new indicator, total activity in a soil, which takes into account the effects of a soil on the allelopathy activity, is proposed because allelopathic activity is affected by the presence of soils. The total activity in a soil was calculated by multiplying the "total activity in a plant" with a "soil factor." In this calculation, we assumed simplified cases for comparison, such that the allelopathic plant materials are evenly incorporated in the soils and the allelochemicals are released from the plant materials to the soils at a constant rate. We conducted bioassay experiments in the presence and absence of soils and cited some published data to calculate the specific activities and total activities in a plant and in a soil. The results indicated that the allelopathies of buckwheat caused by ()-catechin, Leucaena leucocephala by l-mimosine, Xanthium occidentale by trans-cinnamic acid, and Brassica parachinensis by cis-cinnamic acid were not significant in a volcanic ash soil, an alluvial soil, and a calcareous soil, but the allelopathy of sweet vernalgrass caused by coumarin and Spiraea thunbergii by cis-cinnamoyl glucosides was highly effective in those soils. The allelopathies of Juglans species caused by juglone plus juglone precursors and Mucuna pruriens by l-DOPA would depend highly on the soil types. Although some limitations exist for this approach, the total activity approach would allow for a better quantitative estimation of the allelopathic potential of plant materials in soils. © 2010 Weed Science Society of America.

AB  - The dry leaves of Psidium guajava Linn., Ficus benghalensis Linn., Codiaeum variegatum Linn., Polyalthia longifolia Sonner., Eucalyptus citriodora Hook., Caesalpinia pulcherrima Linn., Syzygium cumini Linn., Artocarpus heterophyllus Lamk., Musa paradisiaca Linn., Plumeria rubra Linn., Litchi chinensis Gaertn., Pinus insularis Endl., Elaeocarpus sphaericus Gaertn., Bombax ceiba Linn., Streblus asper Lour. and Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. were converted to vermicomposts in about 5 to 8 months while those of Mangifera indica Linn., Terminalia chebula Retz., Lagerstroemia speciosa Linn. and Tectona grandis Linn. took about 10 months. However, Leucaena leucocephala Lamk. leaves took only 2 months to become vermicompost. These vermicomposts contained: N, 0.9 to 1.9; P, 0.5 to 1.2; K, 0.9 to 2.5; Na, 0.8 to 3.5; Ca, 0.9 to 4.9 and S, 0.9 to 2.2%. The vermicompost of Bombax ceiba flowers produced in 3.5 months contained: N, 1.2; P, 0.6; K, 1.8; Na, 1.4; Ca, 0.4 and S, 0.9%. Nutritional status of these vermicomposts varied with the variation of tree species. This information would motivate farmers for vermicomposting of dry leaves instead of burning.

AB  - An in vitro gas production experiment was completed to determine effects of four tropical browse legumes (i.e., Acacia cornigera, AC; Albizia lebbekoides, AL; Enterolobium cyclocarpum, EC; Leucaena leucocephala, LL) at 0.15 or 0.30 of total substrate on microbial fermentation of the tropical grass Pennisetum purpureum CT-115 (PP). Two incubation runs with four bottles per treatment were completed, using two bottles for gas production measurements up to 96 h and two bottles for microbial purine bases (PB) concentration analysis after 24 h. Inclusion of AC, EC and LL linearly increased (P<0.05) gas production from PP alone at an initial stage of fermentation (5 h) because of their higher fermentation rate versus PP. However, whereas the linear increase in gas production was maintained at mid fermentation (i.e., 24 h) with AC, there was no effect with LL and a linear reduction in gas volume at 24 and 96 h with EC, possibly because of its saponin content. Gas production with AL was linearly reduced at 24 and 96 h (P<0.01). There were no differences in microbial concentrations, either estimated from a partitioning factor or PB analysis, but PB concentration in the solid residue increased three-fold when LL were included. Differences among legume species in chemical composition, and in the nature of their secondary compounds, are responsible for the fermentation pattern of mixed substrates. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lime, fertilizers, mycorrhizal fungi, and selected rhizobia strains on the growth of four woody legume species, Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth., Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, and Sesbania virgata (Cav.) Pers. in a low-fertility soil. The experiment was conducted under greenhouse condition in plastic pots (4 kg). Eight treatments and eight replicates per treatment were performed in a completely randomized design. The treatments were: (1) complete treatment (C) (NPK fertilization+micronutrients+liming+MR that is inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia); (2) C minus N (C-N that is as C without the addition of N); (3) C-N-M (as C-N without inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)); (4) C-N-R (as C-N without inoculation of rhizobia); (5) C-N-liming (as C-N without liming); (6) C-N-micro (as C-N without addition of micronutrients); (7) C-N-P (as C-N without addition of P); (8) control without fertilization, liming, and without inoculation with AMF and rhizobia. After 4 months of growth, we determined the yield of individual plants, nodulation, mycorrhizal colonization, and nutrient contents. Phosphorus was the most limiting nutrient for plant growth, followed by nitrogen. L. leucocephala and S. virgata had the most robust response to the addition of micronutrients and liming, showing an increase in nutrient content, plant height, and root and shoot dry matter. When compared to the single inoculation, the dual inoculation increased growth of all plants, except that of A. lebbeck, which did not respond to either rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungi inoculation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In a switch-over experiment, eight male animals, four each of sheep and goats of local breeds with mean body weight of 26. 8±2.0 and 30.0±2.1 kg, were fed Dichanthium annulatum (DA) grass and four browse species viz. Helictris isora, Securengia virosa, Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Hardwickia binnata (HB) in four feeding trials to assess their supplementary effect on activity of rumen enzymes. The sheep and goats were offered DA grass with individual browse in 75:25 and 50:50 proportions, respectively, for more than 3 months during each feeding trial, and rumen liquor samples were collected twice at 0 and 4 h post feeding after 60 and 90 days of feeding. Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) enzymes were determined in the bacteria and protozoa fractions of rumen liquor, while cellulase enzyme activity was measured in mixed rumen liquor. LL and HB had the highest and lowest contents of CP, while fibre contents were lower in early than later browse leaves. Supplementation of browse leaves significantly (P<0.05) affect the specific activity of GDH enzyme in bacteria fraction of rumen liquor of animal species, while GDH activity was similar in protozoa fraction of rumen liquor of sheep and goats on all DA grass-browse-supplemented diets except DA-HB (42.8 units/mg protein), where activity was significantly (P<0.05) low. Specific activities of GOT and GPT enzymes in both bacteria and protozoa fractions of rumen liquor differ significantly (P<0.05) due to supplementation of browse leaves to DA grass. Browse leaves significantly (P<0.05) affect the cellulase enzyme activity in animal rumen liquor, being highest on DA-LL (193.4) and lowest on DA-HB diet (144.8 μg sugar/mg protein). Goat exhibited higher activities of GOT and GPT than sheep in both bacteria and protozoa fraction of rumen liquor, while cellulase activity was similar between the animal species on the grass-browse leaves diets. Results indicate that browse leaves supplementation affect the enzyme activities of sheep and goats rumen, while the goats rumen liquor had higher activities of GOT, GPT and GDH enzyme than sheep. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Seed germination can be influenced by passage through the digestive system of animals, which can act as seed dispersers, depending on how seeds are affected. When passing through the animal digestive tract does not reduce the seeds germination, the dispersal agent is considered legitimate. The effects of ingestion by bovine cattle (Bos Taurus Linnaeus (1758)) on the viability and germination of seeds of the species Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth and Calopogonium mucunoides Desv. was investigated in this study, aiming at evaluating the role of cattle as legitimate dispersers of those forage plants. Seed samples were mixed with the food offered to three B. taurus females, whose feces were collected 36 hours after ingestion, and seeds recovered from the feces were quantified and tested for germination and initial seedling growth. Non-ingested seeds were used as a control. The percentage of undamaged seeds recovered ranged from 12.3 to 17.5%. The germination capacity (germinability) of C. cajan was strongly inhibited by the cattle ingestion, whereas the germinability of C.mucunoides was less affected. The germinability of L. leucephala was not influenced by the ingestion probably due to their hard seed coat. The germination rate of C. mucunoides and L. leucocephala seeds was slightly increased by cattle ingestion, whereas the Emergence Rate Index (ERI) was reduced in the former. The ingestion by cattle also caused a decrease in the growth rate of C. cajan and C. mucunoides seedlings, although this inhibitory effect was smaller in C. cajan. The height of L. leucocephala seedlings was increased by ingestion. The results suggest that bovine cattle aren't legitimate seed dispersers of L. leucocephala, C.mucunoides and C. cajan.

TI  - Use of thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry analysis to explain the origin of volatiles produced during biomass pyrolysis
PY  - 2009

AB  - Pyrolysis of alternative biomasses, which contributes to the recovery of arid soils and does not compete with alimentary biomass, could increase use of biomass as feedstock in energy production facilities. In this sense, in order to optimize this thermal process and gain better insight the origin and evolution of the main produced volatiles, nonisothermal thermogravimetry coupled to mass spectrometry (TG/MS) has been applied for samples of two biomasses [Leucaena Leucocephala (Leucaena) and Chamaecytisus Palmensis (Tagasaste)], which find application as energy crops and contribute to soil restoration. In a first stage, autocatalytic kinetics has been used in order to obtain the mass loss rate profiles (DTG) of each biomass pseudocomponent (hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and extractives) during pyrolysis. In a second stage, the experimental mass spectrometry signals of the main volatiles (CO, CO2, and H 2O) have been simulated using a linear combination of the previously calculated DTG profiles. The accurate fitting obtained, explains the origin of these volatiles from a simple volatization process, mainly from lignin. In a third stage, in order to simulate the hydrogen signal, it has been necessary to consider the char produced during the volatization process. According to the model, the charring process explains close to 77 wt % of the total hydrogen obtained during pyrolysis. Considering the specific char production of each biomass pseudocomponent, it is possible to measure their individual contributions to hydrogen production: hemicellulose, 27.5; cellulose, 9.7; and lignin, 60.9 wt %, for Leucaena. Taking into account the composition of the samples, the relation between the specific hydrogen productions of the single pseudocomponents (hemicellulose: cellulose: lignin) can be calculated: 3.4:1.0:7.6. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Shiitake mushroom was cultivated on sawdust of timber plants babla, champa, garzon, ipil-ipil, jackfruit, mango, segun, shimul, shisoo, rain tree, sawdust mixtures and rice straw to test for growth and fruiting characteristics. Cultivation on jackfruit resulted in significantly faster mycelial growth compared to other substrates. Shiitake mushroom required 43 days to complete mycelial growth on jackfruit sawdust while requiring up to 55 days for other substrates. However with respect to fructification, jackfruit produced the first pinhead (primordium) significantly early compared to other substrates used. Number of primordia and effective fruiting body was also highest in mushroom raised on jackfruit sawdust. Yield attributes of shiitake mushroom such as stalk length, stalk diameter, pileus diameter and pileus thickness were significantly higher in mushroom raised on jackfruit sawdust. Biological efficiency, yields (biological yield, economic yield and dry yield) at first harvest and final harvest were highest on jackfruit substrate. The lowest biological and economic yields were found in mushroom raised on teak chambul. Rice straw, surprisingly, did not produce any fruiting bodies as well as showing no yield attributes. © 2009, American-Eurasian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - The nutritive values of three grasses (Cynodon plectostychus, Panicum maximum, Pennisetum purpureum), three creeping legumes (CL) (Calopogonia muconoides, Macroptilium atropurpureum, Neonotonia wightii) and three multipurpose trees (MPTs) (Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Morus alba) native to Eastern Tanzania, collected during two seasons (i.e. wet and dry) were evaluated. Forages were analyzed for chemical composition including polyphenolics and in vitro gas production characteristics. Tannin bioassay studies were done on CL and MPTs after in vitro incubation with or without addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a tannin binding agent. The forages had variable crude protein contents which were influenced by seasonal variations. The CP content ranged from 120 (Cynodon plectostychus, wet season) to 69 g/kg DM (Pennisetum purpureum, dry season) in grasses; from 217 (Macroptilium atropurpureum, dry season) to 141 g/kg DM (Neonotonia wightii, wet season) in CL and from 317 (Leucaena leucocephala, dry season) to 212 g/kg DM (Morus alba, wet season) in MPTs. Forage type and seasonal interaction affected neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content but not acid detergent (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) levels. Grasses had high levels of NDF and ADF while MPTs had the lowest levels in each season. The ADL contents were highest in CL but lowest in grasses in both seasons. The contents of total extractable tannins (TET) in CL and MPTs were influenced by the type of season and species interaction and ranged from 67.9 (Neonotonia wightii, dry season) to 9.3 mg/g DM (Morus alba, wet season). The season variation had no effect (P>0.05) on the in vitro gas production volumes and fermentation characteristics. At 12h of incubation, grasses produced least gas compared to CL and MPTs. From 24h to 72h of incubation, Calopogonia muconoides produced highest volume of gas. At 96 h of incubation, Cynodon plectostychus produced the highest gas volume whilst Neonotonia wightii produced least gas volume throughout incubation period. The potential gas production was highest (P<0.05) in grasses compared to other forages and the high rate of gas production was observed in MPTs. Addition of PEG improved (P<0.05) 24h gas production, organic matter digestibility (OMD) and metabolisable energy (ME) in CL and MPTs and both in wet and dry seasons. In both seasons, high levels of 24 h gas production, OMD and ME were observed in Calopogonia muconoides. The lowest responses were in Gliricidia sepium. Results indicate that seasonal variation affected protein content but not in vitro fermentation characteristics of the studies species. Creeping legumes (CL) and MPTs were observed to have high CP content (>100 g/kg DM) and moderate NDF levels (< 550 g/kg DM) suggesting their potential to be used as protein supplements. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment improved the digestibility of Neonotonia wightii and Leucaena leucocephala (dry season) previously depressed by tannin's anti nutritive activity, thus, improves their nutritive potential.

AB  - Effects of an invasion of an alien shrub species, Leucaena leucocephala, were investigated on subsequent establishment of a native mid-successional wooden species, Schima mertensiana at early-successional stages after disturbance in a subtropical oceanic island, Chichijima in Japan. Changes in basal areas, densities and size distribution of forests at a site dominated by L leucocephala were compared with those at a site dominated by native shrub species, Trema orientalis at early-successional stages. Effects of L. leucocephala on germination of seeds and growth of seedlings of S. mertensiana were quantified at the sites. There were few recruited seedlings of S. mertensiana and they did not grow at the site dominated by L. leucocephala. On the other hand, there were a few recruited seedlings within a 1 m × 1 m area and they positively grew at the site dominated by T. orientalis. Germination rates of seeds and growth rates of seedlings of S. mertensiana at the site dominated by L. leucocephala were lower than those at the site dominated by T. orientalis. Germination of seeds and growth of seedlings of S. mertensiana were inhibited by L. leucocephala at the disturbed site, which potentially changed an early successional pathway of the plant community.

AB  - A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of charcoal on the development of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) on Leucaena leucocephala roots and the contribution of the symbiosis to the phosphorus (P) nutrition and growth of the legume. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization of plants raised in Mansand (crushed basalt) in the first experiment was reduced if the medium was amended with fine charcoal and not with coarse charcoal. Charcoal amendment had no effect on AM fungal colonization, AM symbiotic effectiveness measured as pinnule (subleaflet) P content, or on growth of L. leucocephala in soil in the first experiment and in Mansand and in soil in subsequent experiments. However, AM fungal colonization of L. leucocephala roots, P content of pinnules, and growth of the legume were significantly enhanced (P, 0.05) by AM fungal inoculation in all experiments regardless of the growth medium used or charcoal amendment. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Gum exudates from Leucaena Leucocephala (Family: Fabaceae) plants grown all over India were investigated for its physicochemical properties such as pH, swelling capacity and viscosities at different temperatures using standard methods. Leucaena Leucocephala bark gum appeared to be colorless to reddish brown translucent tears. 5 % w/v mucilage has pH of 7.5 at 28C. The gum is slightly soluble in water and practically insoluble in ethanol, acetone and chloroform. It swells to about 5 times its original weight in water. A 5 %w/ v mucilage concentration gave a viscosity value which was unaffected at temperature ranges (28-40°C). At concentrations of 2 and 5 %w/v, the gum exhibited pseudo plastic flow pattern while at 10 %w/v concentration the flow behaviour was thixotropic. The results indicate that the swelling ability of Leucaena Leucocephala (LL) bark gum may provide potentials for its use as a disintegrant in tablet formulation, as a hydro gel in modified release dosage forms and the rheological flow properties may also provide potentials for its use as suspending and emulsifying agents owing to its pseudo plastic and thixotropic flow patterns. © JAPTR, All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Effect of a multiple mixture of herbaceous legumes and Leucaena leucocephala on the microbial population and fermentative products in the rumen of Zebu upgraded yearling steers
PY  - 2009

AB  - Twenty-four yearling steers of 134 kg of average LW were handled in a completely randomized design to compare the effect of a multiple mixture of herbaceous legumes and Leucaena leucocephala on the microbial population and fermentative products in the rumen of Zebu upgraded yearling steers. The treatments were: (A) Leucaena leucocephala, and (B) multiple mixture of herbaceous legumes, composed of Neonotonia wightii, Pueraria phaseoloides, Macroptilium atropurpureum, and Centrocema pubescens. The stocking rate was of three animals/ha and the experiment lasted 150 d. The use of the multiple mixture of herbaceous legumes tripled the population of cellulolytic bacteria in rumen (11.1 and 34.2 × 106 cfu/mL for A and B, respectively). The populations of total viable and proteolytic bacteria were higher in the rumen of yearling steers fed the multiple mixture of herbaceous legumes, compared with those on L. leucocephala. There were not differences in the populations of fungi and protozoa. The concentration of ammonia was 13.58 and 18.26 mmol/L for L. leucocephala and herbaceous legumes, respectively. The multiple mixture of herbaceous legumes increased in 12% the concentration of total short-chain VFAs. The concentration of acetic acid was 84.78 and 102.68 mmol/L, and that of propionic, 20.22 and 14.13% for A and B, respectively. It was concluded that the grazing on herbaceous legumes increases the cellulolytic organisms and enhances the microbial composition in rumen, compared with L. leucocephala, although both systems are appropriate to keep an adequate rumen functioning in pre-fattening yearling steers.

AB  - Based on designating quadrats of 5 m×5 m and 10 m×10 m, inter-specific association and spatial distribution pattern of eight arbor-shrub populations in Ebinur Lake Wetland Nature Reserve of Xinjiang were studied by using variance ratio (VR) method, negative binomial parameter (K), diffusion coefficient (C), average congestion (m*) and Cassie index (CA). The results show that within 5 m× 5 m quadrats, the general association among eight populations of Populus euphratica Oliv., Reaumuria songarica (Pall.) Maxim., Halocnemum strobilaceum (Pall.) M. Bieb., Haloxylon persicum Bunge ex Boiss. et Buhse, Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb., Halimodendron halodendron (Pall.) Voss, Halostachys caspica C. A. Mey. ex Schrenk and Haloxylon ammodendron (C. A. Mey.) Bunge is all significantly positive association, showing rare resources competition among populations. The analysis results of K, C and CA values show that spatial distribution pattern of P. euphratica, R. songarica, Halocnemum strobilaceum, Haloxylon persicum, Halimodendron halodendron and Halostachys caspica populations all are aggregation type, T. ramosissima population is uniform type and Haloxylon ammodendron population is random type, but only R. songarica and Halocnemum strobilaceum populations are highly significant aggregation type. Within 10 m ×10 m quadrats, the general association among eight arbor-shrub populations is unsignificantly negative association, showing resources competition among populations but coexisting stably. And spatial distribution pattern of eight populations all are obviously significant aggregation type. With increasing of quadrat area from 5 m×5 m to 10 m×10 m, the order of m* value of eight populations has changes, which show existing changes in abilities of inter-specific competition and intra-specific self-thinness. In which, overall performance of R. songarica, Halostachys caspica and Haloxylon ammodendron populations is more stronger, and that of T. ramosissina population is the worst. It is concluded that quadrat area of 10 m×10 m is suitable for research on spatial distribution pattern of populations in Ebinur Lake Wetland Nature Reserve.

TI  - Green leaf manuring with prunings of Leucaena leucocephala for nitrogen economy and improved productivity of maize (Zea mays)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping system
PY  - 2010
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-72249100364&doi=10.1007%2fs10705-009-9272-9&partnerID=40&md5=50e6ea8c847f6b1e73a4a050bc0170c8
AB  - Green leaf manuring with prunings of Leucaena leucocephala is regarded as a useful source of N to plants but the actual substitution of N fertilizer, release and recovery of N as well as effects on soil fertility are not adequately studied. The present studies investigated the effect of sole and combined use of Leucaena prunings and urea N fertilizer in different proportions on productivity, profitability, N uptake and balance in maize (Zea mays)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping system at New Delhi during 2002-2003 and 2003-2004. Varying quantities of Leucaena green leaf biomass containing 3.83-4.25% N (18.2-20.5 C:N ratio) were applied to provide 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of recommended N (120 kg ha-1) to both maize and wheat before sowing. In general, direct application of urea N increased the productivity of both crops more than Leucaena green leaf manure, but the reverse was true for the residual effect of these sources. The productivity of maize increased progressively with increasing proportions of N through urea fertilizer and was 2.41-2.52 t ha-1 with 60 kg N ha-1 each applied through Leucaena and urea, which was at par with that obtained with 120 kg N ha-1 through urea alone (2.56-2.74 t ha-1). Similarly, wheat yield was also near maximum (4. 46-5. 11 t ha-1) when equal amounts of N were substituted through Leucaena and urea. Residual effects were obtained on the following crops and were significant when greater quantity of N (>50%) was substituted through Leucaena. Nitrogen uptake and recovery were also maximum with urea N alone, and N recovery was higher in maize (33.4-42.1%) than in wheat (27.3-29.8%). However, recovery of residual N in the following crop was more from Leucaena N alone (8.5-10.3%) than from urea fertilizer (1.7-3.8%). Residual soil fertility in terms of organic C and KMnO4 oxidizable N showed improvement with addition of Leucaena prunings, which led to a positive N balance at the end of second cropping cycle. Net returns were considerably higher with wheat than with maize, and were comparatively lower with greater proportion of Leucaena because of its higher cost. Nonetheless, it was beneficial to apply Leucaena and urea on equal N basis for higher productivity and sustainability of this cereal-based cropping system. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

TI  - Effect of replacement of concentrate mixture with isonitrogenous leaf meal mixture on growth, nutrient utilization and rumen fermentation in goats
PY  - 2010

AB  - This study was conducted to examine the effect of replacing concentrate mixture with leaf meal mixture of Leucaena leucocephala-Melia azedarach-Morus alba in equal proportion on growth, nutrient utilization, blood and rumen metabolites in growing goats using completely randomized design. Twelve male non-descript goats were divided into two groups, control and experimental, consisting of six animals in each group. The control group was fed concentrate mixture whereas in experimental group 50% of concentrate mixture was replaced with isonitrogenous leaf meal mixture. The duration of experimental feeding was 45 days. Weekly body weights were recorded to assess growth rate of goats. After 30 days of experimental feeding a metabolism trial of 6 days duration was conducted to determine digestibility of nutrients and nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balance. Blood samples were collected at 0, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 45 days of experimental feeding to study blood metabolites. Rumen liquor was also collected at 0 and 30 days to study rumen metabolites. The average daily gain (g) of control group (51.56) and experimental group (62.22) was statistically (P > 0.05) similar. The goat of control and experimental group had statistically (P > 0.05) similar intake (g/kg W0.75/day) of dry matter (60.70 vs 64.64), concentrate mixture (40.16 vs 41.60) and wheat straw (20.53 vs 23.05), respectively. The digestibility (%) of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and ether extract was significantly (P < 0.05) depressed in experimental group of goat (65.60, 68.90, 65.62 and 63.05, respectively) as compared to control group (75.14, 77.41, 76.06 and 79.14, respectively). The digestibility (%) of neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and hemicellulose was similar in control (66.73, 65.49 and 64.97, respectively) and treatment group (58.21, 51.66 and 64.97, respectively). Animals of both the groups were in positive balance of nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus. Nitrogen balance (g/day) in control and treatment group of goat was similar (3.86 and 4.05, respectively) while calcium and phosphorus balance (g/day) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in control group (2.34 and 1.02) than treatment group (1.06 and 0.22). There was no statistically significant (P > 0.05) effect of collection period and diet composition on the blood biochemical metabolites (hemoglobin, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin and urea nitrogen) of goats. The pH of rumen fluid at 0 and 30 days of experimental feeding was 6.60, 6.60 for control group and 6.69, 6.33 for experimental group of goats. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in nitrogenous fractions (mg/dl) (ammonia nitrogen (19.27 vs 19.30), total nitrogen (101.52 vs 100.14), TCA-ppt nitrogen (50.24 vs 48.84) and non-protein nitrogen (50.06 vs 51.12) of rumen fluid collected at 30 days of experimental feeding of control and treatment group of goats, respectively. From present study it can be concluded that Leucaena-Melia-Morus mixture can replace 50% of concentrate mixture in the ration of growing goats without any adverse effect on growth, nutrient utilization, blood metabolites and rumen fermentation parameters. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objectives of this work were to evaluate the floristic composition and dry biomass of weeds under the canopy of seven perennial species adapted to the Semi-Arid region of Brazil, and correlate these characteristics with growth traits of the perennial species. The following perennial species were evaluated in two experiments (E1 and E2): mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), jucá (Caesalpinia ferrea), white popinac (Leucaena leucocephala), mofumbo (Combretum leprosum), neem (Azadirachata indica), sabiá (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia) and tamarind (Tamarindus indica). In E1, the seven species were evaluated in a random block design with four replicates and nine plants per plot. In E2, evaluation comprised four species (mesquite, jucá, white popinac, and tamarind) in a random block design with eight replicates and nine plants per plot. A circle with an area of 1.77 m2 was established around the trunk of each plant, two years after they were transplanted to the permanent location. The weeds collected within this circle were cut even with the ground, classified and weighed. At this time, plant height, and crown and stem diameters were evaluated in all trees of each plot. In E1 there were no differences between tree species as to weed frequency under their canopies; however, weed growth was smaller under the canopy of sabiá trees. Mesquite and sabiá had the greatest plant height and crown diameter means, but only sabiá had the greatest stem diameter. In E2, the perennial species were not different with regard to weed frequency and growth under their canopies, but mesquite had the greatest growth, as measured by plant height (with significant results for jucá as well) and crown and stem diameter.

AB  - Utilization of plant protein sources in aquaculture have continued to produce more promising results towards alleviating high cost of feeding. This study examined the utilization of Leucaena leucocephala seed meal (LSM) for sustainable fish production. Six isonitrogenous; 40% crude protein diets were formulated where LSM replaced Soya bean meal (SBM) at 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% inclusions. Catfish fingerlings (5.21±0.14g) stocked at 25 fish/70 liters tanks were fed diets in triplicates three times daily for 112 days. Solid wastes were siphoned everyday before feeding while total water exchange with fresh clean water was done when data on fish growth and haematology were collected. Chemical analysis of diets and feeds were carried out before experiment and that of fish alone was repeated after the experiment. Data from the completely randomized experiment were subjected to ANOVA and correlation analysis and L.S.D. was separated at 5% probability level. Mean weight gain (MWG) and Specific growth rate (SGR) of fish fed 20% LSM were statistically different (p<0.05) from those fish fed LSM at higher inclusion rates. Fish MWG, SGR, PER and FCR significantly (p<0.05) correlated negatively with LSM inclusion rates in fish diet r= -0.62,-0.57,-0.78 and -0.64 respectively. Fish carcass protein, packed cell volume and haemoglobin counts of fish were statistically the same for 0%, 20% and 40% LSM fed fish. In the present study processed leucaena seed meal can be considered as a good alternative raw material in substitution to soya bean meal for Clarias gariepinus fingerlings' diets at 20% inclusion level.

AB  - Eight tropical seeds from browse, shrubs and pulses plants were assessed for their nutritive value using in vitro gas production technique. Dry Matter (DM), Crude Protein (CP), crude fibre, ash, ether extract and Neutral Detergent Fibre (NDF) were analyzed. Milled seeds were incubated using 200 mg/30 ml inoculum for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 h. At post incubation, the total gas volume was measured for methane using 4 ml of 10 M NaOH. Dynamics of gas production characteristics over time were described by equation Vt = Vf × [1 + exp {2-4 × S × (t-L)}] - 1. Metabolizable Energy (ME; MJ/kg DM), Organic Matter Digestibility (OMD; %) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA; μmol/200 mg DM)) were estimated. DM was lowest (88.1%) in Leucaena leucocephala and was the best (95.6%) in Tephrosia bracteolata seeds. CP ranged from 25-38.9% being the least (25.0%) for Lablab purpureus and the highest (38.9%) for Tehprosia candida. NDF of the seeds varied from 27.1% in Tephrosia bracteolata to 49.1% in Leucaena leucocephala. The volume of gas produced by the seeds consistently increased (p<0.05) and was significantly (p<0.05) highest in pulse legumes. Potential extent (Vt) of gas production ranged from 36.8-53.6 and that of fractional rate of gas production from 0.043-0.07. The ranged values 7.5-10.4, 50.7-70.4 and 0.751-1.185 for ME, OMD and SCFA respectively were significantly (p<0.05) highest in Tephrosia bracteolata seeds. The CH4 production varied from 148 μml in Albizia lebbeck to 300 μml in Carnavalia ensiformis. The result showed that the seeds were high in nutrients, digestible and metabolizable energy with relatively low methane production and therefore could be used for ruminants as feedstuffs. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2009.

AB  - Water striders demonstrate an amazing talent which enables them to effectively "row" across water surfaces without immobilization. This ability has previously been ascribed to the wax-like chemistry of the small hairs (setae) found on the legs, and theoretically attributed to the nano/microscaled hierarchical architecture of individual seta using the Cassie-Baxter equations. Here we show experimentally the strength of the contribution of the seta surface architecture to superhydrophobicity by maintaining identical surface chemistry (thin and thick coating of the setae with polydimethylsiloxane). Atomic force microscopy-based force and adhesion measurements of single uncoated and coated seta interacting with water quantitatively demonstrate the efficiency of the topographical component of the setae for repelling water. © 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB  - The adsorption of Rhodamine B (Basic dye) on Leucaena leucocephala seed shell waste carbon was investigated to assess the possible use of this adsorbent for the processing of dyeing industry wastewater. The influence of various factors such as initial dye concentration, agitation time and temperature on the adsorption capacity has been studied. The percentage removal of dye is observed to decrease with the increase in initial dye concentration. With increase in temperature the adsorption of dye also increases, indicating endothermic nature of the reaction. Adsorption isothermal data could be interpreted by the Langmuir and Freundlich equations. Kinetic data have been studied using Elovich and Pseudo-second order equations for understanding the reaction mechanism.

AB  - In order to clarify the translocation and metabolism of glyphosate in lead tree, a mixture of glyphosate (0.5 mmol) and 14C-glyphosate was injected into mini tree plants (1.5-cm trunk diameter and 120 cm tall), simulating a grown lead tree in a greenhouse experiment. Within 6 d after treatment (DAT), all leaves on the lead tree plants dropped. Analysis of nonlabeled glyphosate in both xylem and phloem every 15 d showed that glyphosate residues accumulated mainly in phloem, similar to the findings in established lead tree. In this experiment, glyphosate concentration in the phloem of three parts of the trunk, i.e., upper (15 cm above the upper injection hole), middle (between the two injection holes), and lower (15 cm below the lower injection hole) parts, increased rapidly within 45 DAT, and decreased thereafter. Obviously, significant glyphosate metabolism occurred during the latter period. Further 14C radioactivity measurement also exhibited similar time-course changes of glyphosate dissipation, except that a low level of radioactivity in the phloem of the upper part and a high level of radioactivity in the lower part were detected from 45 to 90 DAT, suggesting that more glyphosate metabolites in the phloem of the upper part might have translocated with photosynthetic assimilates and reallocated to the lower part of the mini tree. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis of metabolites derived from 14C-glyphosate also revealed that about 70% of the radioactivity recovered in the phloem of the lower part comprised the unknown metabolites M1 (retention factor [Rf ] : 0.83) and M2 (Rf : 0.94), with nearly 28% of the radioactivity from sarcosine (Rf : 0.76), and less than 2% of the radioactivity from aminomethylphosphoric acid (AMPA) (Rf : 0.49) and glyphosate (Rf : 0.36). It is concluded that active metabolism of glyphosate in this 90-d simulation experiment occurred mainly from 45 to 90 DAT, and the primary metabolism was modulated by C-P lyase.

AB  - Wettability of soil affects a wide variety of processes including infiltration, preferential flow and surface runoff. The problem of determining contact angles and surface energy of powders, such as soil particles, remains unsolved. So far, several theories and approaches have been proposed, but formulation of surface and interfacial free energy, as regards its components, is still a very debatable issue. In the present study, the general problem of the interpretation of contact angles and surface free energy on chemically heterogeneous and rough soil particle surfaces is evaluated by a reformulation of the Cassie-Baxter equation, assuming that the particles are attached on to a plane and rigid surface. Compared with common approaches, our model considers a roughness factor that depends on the Young's Law contact angle determined by the surface chemistry. Results of the model are discussed and compared with independent contact angle measurements using the Sessile Drop and the Wilhelmy Plate methods. Based on contact angle data, the critical surface tension of the grains were determined by the method proposed by Zisman. Experiments were made with glass beads and three soil materials ranging from sand to clay. Soil particles were coated with different loadings of dichlorodimethylsilane (DCDMS) to vary the wettability. Varying the solid surface tension using DCDMS treatments provided pure water-wetting behaviours ranging from wettable to extremely hydrophobic, with contact angles > 150°. Results showed that the critical surface energy measured on grains with the highest DCDMS loadings was similar to the surface energy measured independently on ideal DCDMS-coated smooth glass plates, except for the clay soil. Contact angles measured on plane surfaces were related to contact angles measured on rough grain surfaces using the new model based on the combined Cassie-Baxter Wenzel equation, which takes into account the particle packing density on the sample surface. © 2009 British Society of Soil Science.

AB  - Milk production has increased steadily in East Africa over the last three decades. Much of the production increase has come from smallholder dairy farmers, typically with one-to-three cows on farms no bigger than two hectares. The overall impact of the technology, in Kenya alone, is that some 86,000 farmers earned an additional net income from milk, ranging from $19.7 million to $29.6 million over the past 15 years. The first trials in Kenya were designed by researchers but managed by farmers. The trials assessed three promising species- Calliandra calothyrsus, Sesbania sesban and Leucaena leucocephala. The researchers recommend that additional studies are carried out to improve understanding of the use and impact of fodder trees in the region, especially in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. The technology has been only recently introduced in these countries, so farmers are still learning how to use the fodder trees in combination with other feeds.

AB  - Lentinus edodes (Berk.), the shiitake mushroom, is worldwide one of the most widely cultivated mushrooms. Sawdust is the most popular basal ingredient used in synthetic substrate formulations for producing shiitake spawn. However, the best sawdust for this uses needs to be determined. Shiitake mushroom was cultivated on sawdust from the woody plants Babla (Acacia nilotica L.), Champa (Michelia champaca L.), Garzon (Dipterocarpus alatus Roxb.), Ipil-ipil [Leucaena glauca (Linn) Benth], Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam), Mango (Mangifera indica L.), Raintree [Albizia saman (Jacq.) F Müll], Segun (Tectona grandis L), Shimul (Bombax ceiba L), Shisoo (Dalbergia sissoo Roxb) or mixtures of sawdust from all of the trees with equal ratio or rice straw to determine growth and fruiting characteristics. Cultivation on Jackfruit resulted in significantly faster mycelial growth compared to other substrates. With respect to fructification, culture on Jackfruit produced the first pinhead (primordium) earlier compared to other substrates. Numbers of primordial and effective fruiting bodies was highest on Jackfruit sawdust. Rice straw, surprisingly, did not produce any fruiting bodies as well as showing no yield attributes. Yield attributes including stalk length, stalk diameter and diameter and thickness of the pileus were significantly higher on Jackfruit. The lowest biological and economic yields were found when culture was on Champa. Biological efficiency and biological yield, economic yield and dry yield at the first and final harvests were highest with culture on Jackfruit and its use is recommended in the production of shiitake mushroom in the tropics. © 2009 Academic Journals.

AB  - Five experimental diets B0 (0%, control), B1 (25%), B2 (50%), B3 (75%) and B4 (100%) were formulated with combined biscuit waste and Leucaena leucocephala meals and fed to 20 Yankasa rams for 91 days to evaluate their effects on non-carcass components of the rams. The rams were slaughtered at the expiration of the experiment and non-carcass components were measured which included external and internal offals, blood, bones and diaphragm. The results revealed that there were significant (P < 0.05) differences in the non-carcass components of all the rams fed different diets. It was further observed that diets B1 (25%) and B2 (50%) biscuit waste inclusion had the best (P < 0.05) effects on non-carcass components of the rams followed by diets B3 (75%) and B4 (100%) biscuit waste inclusion in that order compared with control diet B0 (0%) biscuit waste inclusion. It was therefore recommended that diets B1 and B2 be utilized for optimum results if non-carcass variables are desired in Yankasa rams. © 2010 Academic Journals.

AB  - A study was conducted on antidiabetic test of active fractions of methanol extract from Leucaena leucocephala (lmk)DeWit seeds using alloxan-induced rats. Fractionation was conducted on active fractions using column chromatograph. The most active fractions in the previous study were analyzed with thin layer chromatography (TLC) using mobile phase of chloroform-methanol (5:1), chloroform-methanol (2: 1), chloroform-methanolwater (5: 5: 1) on the isolates yielded with oral glucose tolerance test and identification. The result findings show that methanol extracts have a greater antidiabetic activity; and 5 isolates resulted from the isolation of methanol extracts. The result of bioactive compound identification was glycoside compounds with monosaccharide galactose clusters and many other saccharides. It was concluded that active fractions of Leucaena leucocephala (lmk)DeWit seeds had antidiabetic activities and their bioactive compounds constitute glycoside compounds with monosaccharide galactose clusters and many other saccharides. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2010.

TI  - Flying foxes prefer to forage in farmland in a tropical dry forest landscape mosaic in Fiji
PY  - 2010

AB  - To test flying fox adaptations to a habitat mosaic with extreme deforestation, the abundance, habitat choice and feeding behavior of the Pacific flying fox, Pteropus tonganus, were investigated across 16 islands of the Yasawa archipelago, Fiji. The habitat mosaic is formed by 4.3 percent tropical dry forest and 3.3 percent farmland, leaving exotic grasslands and stands of Leucaena leucocephala to overrun the vast majority of land. Pteropus tonganus abundance was high (5757 bats) despite deforestation and hunting. Roosting sites were restricted to native forest fragments. Grasslands and stands of L. leucocephala were completely void of bats at all times. The mean foraging density in farmland was four times higher than in forests and foraging competition was routinely observed in farmland but was extremely rare in forests. The author suggests that during the study, extensive foraging in farmland was supporting the high P. tonganus population. Additionally, the preferential foraging in farmland was responsible for the low foraging densities within forests and dramatically less intraspecies competition for forest resources. Further research is needed on seed dispersal within forests and to test for seasonal variations in bat abundance and feeding. © 2009 The Author(s).

AB  - (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae): invader or ruderal?) Exotic species have not been recommended for degraded lands reforestation, since they are reported to invade natural ecosystems in the surrounding areas. Leucena leucocephala, a leguminous N fixing species, was introduced in Brazil and has been widely cultivated, especially to recover degraded soils. The potential of L. leucocephala to expand over the landscape and its persistence in the plant community in the long term was analyzed. A stand planted in 1983 was assessed, which was installed on a rocky soil, immerse in an agricultural matrix, where some native and planted forest patches exists. Over a 200 ha area, eleven distinct patches were surveyed, where all individuals from arboreal species (minimum height 50 cm) were identified and measured (dbh), to verify if the exotic species is expanding over areas where it has not been planted. In the stand where the species was planted, the community structure was assessed on the basis of relative density in size classes to verify if the proportion of the exotic species tends to increase with time, confirming persistence. Since, among the total of 4,599 individuals surveyed, not even a single individual of the species was recorded beyond the limits of the planted stand, invasion of natural ecosystems by Leucena leucocephala was refuted, the species being locally considered as ruderal. Even though a huge number of young individuals of L. leucocephala are regenerating under the planted trees, the relative density of the exotic species in the understorey tends to decrease with time. Apparently, some shade tolerant native species can slowly dominate the community in the future, taking advantage under light competition.

TI  - Potential of three legume species for phytoremediation of arsenic contaminated soils
PY  - 2009
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865443112&partnerID=40&md5=f868ef0424fefeb5b2dbcda60de1a3cf
AB  - Phytoremediation strategies utilize plants to decontaminate or immobilize soil pollutants. Among soil pollutants the metalloid arsenic (As) is the one of primary concern. Elevated soil As results from anthropogenic activities such as use of pesticides (herbicides and fungicides), use of certain fertilizers, metal mining, iron and steel production, coal combustion, and from co-production during natural gas extraction. This study evaluated the potential of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), wand riverhemp (Sesbania virgata), and lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala) for phytoremediation of soils polluted by As. Soil samples were placed in plastic pots, incubated with different As doses (0, 50, 100 and 200 mg dm -3) and then sown with seeds of these three species. Ninety days after sowing, the plants were evaluated for height, collar diameter and dry matter of young, intermediate and basal leaves, stems and roots. Arsenic concentration was determined in different aged leaves, stems and roots to establish the translocation index (TI) between plant roots and aerial plant components. The evaluated species showed distinctly different characteristics with respect to As tolerance, since the lead tree and wand riverhemp were significantly more tolerant than pigeon pea. High As levels found in wand riverhemp roots suggest the existence of an effective mechanism of accumulation and compartmentalization in order to reduce As translocation to aboveground tissues. Pigeon pea is a sensitive species and could serve as a potential bioindicator plant, whereas the other two species have potential for phytoremediation programs in As polluted areas. However, further studies are needed with longer exposure times in actual field conditions to reach definitive conclusions on the relative phytoremediation potentials on these species.

TI  - Engineering and validation of a novel lipid thin film for biomembrane modeling in lipophilicity determination of drugs and xenobiotics
PY  - 2009
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79961244774&doi=10.1186%2f1754-1611-3-14&partnerID=40&md5=704451aa0685b3b12119dfb458ccfa46
AB  - Background: Determination of lipophilicity as a tool for predicting pharmacokinetic molecular behavior is limited by the predictive power of available experimental models of the biomembrane. There is current interest, therefore, in models that accurately simulate the biomembrane structure and function. A novel bio-device; a lipid thin film, was engineered as an alternative approach to the previous use of hydrocarbon thin films in biomembrane modeling.Results: Retention behavior of four structurally diverse model compounds; 4-amino-3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (ADBA), naproxen (NPX), nabumetone (NBT) and halofantrine (HF), representing 4 broad classes of varying molecular polarities and aqueous solubility behavior, was investigated on the lipid film, liquid paraffin, and octadecylsilane layers. Computational, thermodynamic and image analysis confirms the peculiar amphiphilic configuration of the lipid film. Effect of solute-type, layer-type and variables interactions on retention behavior was delineated by 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR). Validation of the lipid film was implemented by statistical correlation of a unique chromatographic metric with Log P (octanol/water) and several calculated molecular descriptors of bulk and solubility properties.Conclusion: The lipid film signifies a biomimetic artificial biological interface capable of both hydrophobic and specific electrostatic interactions. It captures the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) in the determination of lipophilicity of molecules unlike the pure hydrocarbon film of the prior art. The potentials and performance of the bio-device gives the promise of its utility as a predictive analytic tool for early-stage drug discovery science. © 2009 Idowu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - A pot experiment was conducted to determine the effect of four rates of nitrogen (N) in the form of leucaena leaves and the time of application on the performance of sorghum plants using the 15N isotopic dilution technique. Results showed that leucaena green manure (LGM) increased dry matter and N yield of sorghum. Nitrogen recoveries of LGM ranged between 23 and 47%. An additional beneficial effect of LGM was attributed to the enhancement of soil N uptake. The best timing of LGM incorporation for obtaining more N derived from LGM, less soil N uptake, and greater dry matter and N in sorghum leaves seemed to be at planting. However, the appropriate timing and rate of LGM to obtain greater dry matter and N yield in panicles, as well as in the whole plant of sorghum, appeared to be at 30 days before planting, particularly a rate of 120 kg N ha-1.

AB  - Phytoremediation strategies utilize plants to decontaminate or immobilize soil pollutants. Among soil pollutants, metalloid As is considered a primary concern as a toxic element to organisms. Arsenic concentrations in the soil result from anthropogenic activities such as: the use of pesticides (herbicides and fungicides); some fertilizers; Au, Pb, Cu and Ni mining; Fe and steel production; coal combustion; and as a bi-product during natural gas extraction. This study evaluated the potential of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), wand riverhemp (Sesbania virgata), and lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala) as phytoremediators of soils polluted by As. Soil samples were placed in plastic pots, incubated with different As doses (0; 50; 100 and 200 mg dm-3) and then sown with seeds of the three species. Thirty (pigeon pea) and 90 days after sowing, the plants were evaluated for height, collar diameter and dry matter of young, intermediate and basal leaves, stems and roots. Arsenic concentration was determined in different aged leaves, stems and roots to establish the translocation index (TI) between the plant root system and aerial plant components and the bioconcentration factors (BF). The evaluated species showed distinct characteristics regarding As tolerance, since the lead tree and wand riverhemp were significantly more tolerant than pigeon pea. The high As levels found in wand riverhemp roots suggest the existence of an efficient accumulation and compartmentalization mechanism in order to reduce As translocation to shoot tissues. Pigeon pea is a sensitive species and could serve as a potential bioindicator plant, whereas the other two species have potential for phytoremediation programs in As polluted areas. However, further studies are needed with longer exposure times in actual field conditions to reach definite conclusions on relative phytoremediation potentials.

TI  - A grazier survey of the long-term productivity of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala)-grass pastures in Queensland

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata (leucaena)-grass pastures are productive, perennial and long-lived (40 years). However, little is known about changes in the productivity of these pastures as they age even though they are grazed intensively and are rarely fertilised. A postal survey of beef cattle producers in Queensland who grow leucaena pastures was conducted. The questionnaire gathered information regarding: property location; extent and age of leucaena pastures; soil type; leucaena and grass establishment methodology; grazing and fertiliser management; and grazier perceptions of changes over time in leucaena productivity, grass growth and ground cover, prevalence of undesirable grasses and weeds, and livestock productivity. Graziers were asked to report on both young (≤10 years old) and aging (10 years old) pastures under their management. Eighty-eight graziers responded describing 124 leucaena paddocks covering 11750 ha. The survey results described the typical physical and management characteristics of leucaena pastures in Queensland. Graziers reported a decline in leucaena productivity in 58% of aging pastures, and declines in grass growth (32%) and livestock productivity (42%) associated with declining leucaena growth. Leucaena decline was greater in soil types of marginal initial fertility, particularly brigalow clay, soft wood scrub, downs and duplex soils. Maintenance fertiliser was not applied to most (98%) leucaena pastures surveyed despite significant amounts of nutrient removal, particularly phosphorus and sulphur, occurring over prolonged periods of moderate to high grazing pressure. It is predicted that large areas of leucaena pasture will continue to suffer soil nutrient depletion under current management practices. Research is needed to develop ameliorative actions to reinvigorate pasture productivity. © 2010 CSIRO.

TI  - Influence of cultivation site and fertilisation on the properties of condensed tannins and in vitro ruminal nutrient degradation of Calliandra calothyrsus, Flemingia macrophylla and Leucaena leucocephala
PY  - 2010
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77950338175&doi=10.1016%2fj.anifeedsci.2010.01.005&partnerID=40&md5=c055637f37420b761aa56a2a60ed8980
AB  - Samples obtained from two planting experiments with tropical shrub legumes rich in condensed tannins (CT) (Calliandra calothyrsus, Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala) were analysed in detail for CT concentration, composition and properties, as well as for in vitro degradability. The factors evaluated included cultivation site (fertile mollisol with pH 7.8 and bimodal rainfall vs. infertile oxisol with pH 5.0, high Al saturation and unimodal rainfall) and different levels of mineral fertilisation. In vitro ruminal degradability, CT concentration and properties were affected by cultivation site or fertiliser application or both. In Calliandra and Flemingia, the CT concentration showed a trend (P < 0.1) to be higher at the site with the infertile soil. This was consistent with the increased (P < 0.001) astringency of CT extracts found in Calliandra when plants were cultivated at this site. In Flemingia, however, astringency was reduced (P < 0.001) on the infertile soil. There were certain effects of the cultivation site on the anthocyanidin profile of CT from Calliandra and Flemingia, but these were relatively small and could not explain the differences in astringency observed between sites. Fertilisation did not affect (P > 0.05) total CT concentration in Calliandra and Flemingia but clearly increased (P < 0.01) astringency of the CT extracts. This suggests that not only CT concentration but also properties of CT may be affected by cultivation site and fertilisation. Leucaena did not grow on the infertile soil and site effects could therefore not be evaluated in this species. Fertilisation did not affect (P > 0.05) CT concentration and astringency of CT extracts of Leucaena but reduced (P < 0.05) the cyanidin proportion in CT. Cultivation site affected several variables describing fermentation dynamics. Foliage of the legumes grown on the infertile soil exhibited lower (P < 0.05) gas production rates. Dry matter degradation was lower (P < 0.001) and the proportion of dietary N remaining undegraded after in vitro incubation was higher (P < 0.001) when Calliandra was grown on the infertile compared to the fertile soil. The present results indicate that the cultivation site may affect the feeding value of CT-containing legumes. Fertilisation could not compensate the negative effects of the cultivation site on CT properties and ruminal nutrient degradation. Selecting appropriate cultivation sites (with higher soil fertility) may contribute to improve the feeding value of certain tanniniferous tropical shrub legumes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This part introduces quantitative studies on the impacts of invasive alien animals and plants on native ecosystems on the Bonin Islands. Predation by alien predatory flatworms such as Platydemus manokwari has caused the rapid decline or extinction of many endemic land snails. In addition, predation by black rats can cause micro-evolutionary changes in shell morphology and habitat use of endemic land snails. Feral cats prey upon land birds as well as seabirds characteristic to the Bonin Islands. An introduced lizard, the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), has caused serious damage to many insect populations, resulting in changes in the pollination systems of many native plants. Grazing and trampling by feral goat s has caused destruction of vegetation, leading to accelerated soil erosion on some islands. An alien tree, Bischofia javanica, has replaced native trees due to its greater survival and seedling growth than those of native tree species. Invasion and dominance of an exotic shrub, Leucaena leucocephala, have prevented the establishment of some native woody species. Scientific understanding of the impacts of invasive species and their interactions with native species is essential for conservation and restoration of the native Bonin Island ecosystems. © Springer 2010.

AB  - Microbial biomass and activity are useful indices for assessing changes in soil ecosystems. The impact of different pastures on microbial biomass and activity was studied in a long-term experiment in Northeast Brazil. For our study the pastures were divided into plots: a) Brachiaria brizantha; b) Leucaena leucocephala; c) Cynodon dactilon; d) Panicum maximum. An adjacent area with native vegetation was used as reference. Soil samples were collected in 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths. No significant differences in soil organic C (Corg) was found among all plots at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depth. Soil microbial C (Cmic) values were higher in native forest and P. maximum when compared to the other plots. The soil basal respiration (CO2) values were similar among all plots evaluated. However, respiratory quotients (qCO2) were significantly lower in native forest and P. maximum when compared to other plots, at 0-10 cm depth. Values of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis were significantly higher in native forest and P. maximum, while values of dehydrogenase activity were found to be signif icantly higher in native forest, C. dactilon and P. maximum. Soil microbial biomass and activity changed when a native forest was converted to pastures. These changes were positive with the inclusion of P. maximum by the high input of C sources.

AB  - This research aimed to evaluate co-inoculation of Bradyrhizobium and Bacillus subtilis on nodulation, N fixation and growth of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) grown in a red Oxisol. Treatments consisted by: a) control; b) NPK; c) inoculation with Bradyrhizobium + PK; d) co-inoculation Bradyrhizobium + Bacillus subtilis + PK. There was an increase in nodulation of cowpea with co-inoculation. The shoot dry weight, N accumulation and chlorophyll were higher in both coinoculated and fertilized (NPK) treatments. For leucaena, there were not differences between NPK, inoculated and co-inoculated treatments. The dry weight roots of cowpea and leucaena increased with co-inoculation. The co-inoculation Bradyrhizobium and Bacillus subtilis favored the increase in nodulation of cowpea and it has potential to increase biological N2 fixation and plant growth.

AB  - To offer alternatives for the climatic instability of the Brazilian semi-arid an experiment was accomplished to evaluate the bromatologic composition and the dry matter in situ degradability of arboreal legumes from brazilian semi-arid. The appraised legumes were Muquem (Albizia polyantha), Tamboril (Enterolobium contortisiliquum) and Leucena (Leucaena leucocephala). Samples were collected at three forests of the municipal district of Bom Jesus da Lapa, in the Bahia state, a sample composed in each forest. There were determined the dry matter content, crude protein, detergent neutral fiber, acid detergent fiber, hemicelulose, organic matter, mineral matter and dry matter in situ degradability. The studied legumes presented 45% around of dry matter. The crude protein content of the Muquem legume and Leucena in spite of the statistical difference were very close (17.00%). there was difference for the quality of the fibers with the smallest detergent neutral fiber value observed for the Leucena, following by the Muquem and Tamboril. The Leucena, during the whole incubation period, presented larger digestibilidade ruminal following by the Muquem and of the Tamboril. We can conclude that in spite of the superiority of the Leucena the leguminosa Tamboril and Muquem can be alternative for the feeding of the flock in the ecosystem of Savanna.

AB  - The growth of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de-Wit., were studied in soils collected from four sites viz., Khan Towel, Tanveer Garment, One Tech Rubber and One Tech Ply Board factories in the vicinity of Korangi and Landhi industrial areas under natural environmental conditions. L. leucocephala plants grown in 25, 50 and 75% soils of all of the industries demonstrated reductions in many of the growth parameters as compared to plants grown in Garden soil. Principally, 75% Khan Towel factory soil and 50% other factories soils exhibited great inhibition in most of growth characters than Garden soil. Plant cover, leaves and leaflets numbers, leaf area, leaf, total plant dry weights and root/shoot ratio were noticeably suppressed (p<0.05) in 25, 50 and 75% Khan Towel factory soil than Garden soil. Substantial retardation (p<0.05) in root/shoot and leaf weight ratios were recorded in 25, 50 and 75% Tanveer Garment factory soil. 25, 50 and 75% One Tech Rubber and One Tech Ply Board factories soils literally diminished (p<0.05) plant cover and leaf dry weight as compared to Garden soil.

AB  - Leucaena (Leucena leucocephala) is a feed source which has high protein and carotenoid, but its utilization as feed was limited by the presence of mimosine (β-N-(3-Hydroxy-4 pyridone)-α amino propenoic acid as a toxin. Experiment was carried out using completely randomized design with 4 detoxification treatments and 5 replications. Detoxification treatments of leucaena leaf consisted of (1) non treated leucaena leaf, (2) steamed heating at 70 oC for 15 minutes, (3) dry heating at 70 °C for 12 h, (4) soaking with fresh water for 12 h, (5) spray with NaOH 5%, incubated for 12 h. Variables measured were mimosine and xanthophylls contents. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and duncan multiple range test was further done to test the signifi cant differences between means. The results showed that soaking leucaena leaf with fresh water for 12 h gave the highest reduction for both mimosine and xanthophylls contents and steamed heating at 70°C for 15 minutes had the highest xanthophylls content post detoxifi cation. It was concluded that steamed heating at 70°C for 15 minutes was the best detoxification methods for mimosine in leucaena leaf.

AB  - Biomass based power generation system having power rating of 10 kW was established at Department of Un-conventional Energy Sources, College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Agriculture University, Akola. The system was evaluated for power generation using Prosopis juliflora (Vilaytee babool) and Leucaena leucocephala (Subabool) wood. During long term testing specific biomass consumption was found to be decreased from 3.9 to 1.7 kg/kWh at different loading conditions. Biomass was characterized by conducting Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). Thermo gram of Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis juliflora are found better for getting sufficient amount of tar in case of gasification of this material. The quantum of lighter volatile for Leucaena leucocephala (Subabool), and Prosopis juliflora ranged from 55 and 52 per cent, respectively. Heavier volatile for Leucaena leucocephala (Subabool) and Prosopis juliflora during gasification range from 15 and 17 per cent, respectively. However, on the basis of TGA analysis biomaterial can be gasified effectively. © 2006-2010 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - Microbial biomass, β-glucosidase and β-glucosaminidase activities, and availability, storage, and age of soil organic C were investigated after 26 years of conversion from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) to forest (Eucaliptus robusta or Leucaena leucocephala), pasture (mixture of tropical grasses), and to vegetable cropping (agriculture) in a vertisol in Puerto Rico. Soil organic C (SOC) at 0-100 cm was similar under Leucaena (22.8 kg C/m2), Eucalyptus (18.6 kg C/m2), and pasture (17.2 kg C/m2), which were higher than under agriculture (13.0 kg C/m 2). Soil organic N (SON) at 0-100 cm was similar under the land uses evaluated which ranged from 1.70 (under agriculture) to 2.28 kg N/m2 (under Leucaena forest). Microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN) of the 0-15-cm soil layer could be ranked as: pasture > Leucaena = Eucalyptus > agriculture. The percentages of SOC and SON present as MBC and MBN, respectively, were nearly 1% in pasture and less than 0.50% in forest under Leucaena or Eucalyptus and agricultural soil. The activity of β-glucosidase of the 0-15-cm soil layer could be ranked as: Leucaena = Eucalyptus > pasture > agriculture; while β-glucosaminidase activity was ranked as: Eucalyptus > Leucaena = pasture > agriculture. The soil δ 13C changed from 1996 to 2006 in forest under Eucalyptus (18.7‰ to 21.2‰), but not under Leucaena (20.7‰ to 20.8‰). The soil under Leucaena preserved a greater proportion of old C compared to the forest under Eucalyptus; the former had an increased soil mineralizable C from the current vegetation inputs. The soil under agriculture had the lowest enzyme activities associated with C cycling, lowest percentage of SOC as MBC, highest percentage of SOC present as mineralizable C, and highest percentage of MBC present as mineralizable C compared to the other land uses. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The in vitro anthelmintic (AH) effect of Acacia pennatula, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Piscidia piscipula and Leucaena leucocephala tannin rich extracts on three Mexican strains of Haemonchus contortus L3 larvae was evaluated. Water/acetone extracts were obtained from the fodder of A. pennatula, L. latisiliquum, P. piscipula and L. leucocephala collected in the vegetation of Yucatan, Mexico. Increasing concentrations of lyophilized extracts (300,600, 1, 200, 1,800 and 2,400 μg/ml PBS) were screened for their in vitro A H effect using the larval migration inhibition (LMI) assay. Three unrelated H. contortus Mexican strains were used (CENID-INIFAP, UADY and UNAM). The role of tannins on the AH effect was confirmed by means of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (PVPP), an inhibitor of tannins. The different H. contortus strains showed different responses to the extracts. Only one plant extract (L. latisiliquum) affected the larval migration of the H. contortus strain obtained from Yucatan (UADY). Two plants extracts (A. pennatula and L. latisiliquum) inhibited the larval migration of the CENID-INIFAP strain. Meanwhile, three plant extracts affected larval migration of UNAM strain (A. pennatula, L. latisiliquum, P. piscipula). Furthermore, UNAM strain was affected by extracts at lower doses than CENID-INIFAP and UADY strains. These results indicated that the larvae obtained from Yucatan, Mexico, were less sensitive to extracts of TRP from the same region suggesting a possible adaptation to tannins.

AB  - The utilization of grain legumes such as Leucaena leucocephala by the feed industry is limited because of uncertainty about their nutritional quality. Although the analyzed total amino acid and energy contents of many grain legumes are quite similar, their protein qualities and metabolizable energy values are quite variable. Leucaena leucocephala seeds were analyzed for chemical composition and amino acids profile. The analyzed nutrient composition indicated that leucaena seeds are potential source of protein and energy. The protein content was 31.1% and the calculated metabolizable energy of the seeds was 2573.26 kcal/kg. Amino acids profile of leucaena seeds were 1.39% lysine%, 0.36% methionine, 0.35% cystine, 2.62% arginine, 4.63% glutamic acid, 0.87% threonine, 1.38% glycine, 1.11% alanine, 1.11% valine, 0.93% isoleucine, 1.81% leucine and 0.71% methionine + cystine. Antinutritional Factors (ANFs) were 0.75% tannin and 697.50 mg/100g phytate. Leucaena seed was incorporated at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12% in broiler chicks' diets. One hundred twenty one-day old unsexed broilers (Ross 308) were used. The performance revealed that, the overall feed intake and body weight gain were significantly (p≤0.01) depressed with the inclusion of 6, 9 and 12% leucaena seeds in the diet. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2009.

AB  - In the prospect of the Leuceana leucocephala leaves meal using as a protein ingredient source for indigenous Senegal chickens diets, a study was carried out to determine their nutrient utilization and nutritional value when incorporated at various levels in the diets. Twenty adult indigenous chickens with an average body weight of 1.22 kg were conducted in metabolic cages and allocated in four groups of five birds each. The groups were corresponded to four dietary treatments (LL0, LL7, LL14 and LL21) containing respectively 0, 7, 14 and 21% of Leuceana leaves meal. During the trial, birds were weighed at the beginning and at the end. Feed offered and refused, collected fresh excreta were weighed daily and the droppings were oven-dried at 60°C and ground per bird for six days. The ingredients and experimental diets used and collected excreta were subjected to chemical analyses. Results showed that the Leuceana leaves were relatively rich in protein (24.9% DM), ether extract (6.4% DM), crude fiber (14.2% DM) and Neutral detergent fiber (22.4% DM). It contained respectively 43.1% and 11.4% DM of nitrogen free extract and ash, particularly calcium (1.8%) and potassium (1.1% DM) and 2573.8 kcal/kg DM of metabolizable energy. The results of the trial showed that the inclusion of L. leucocephala leaves meal in the diet at 21% level, has no significant adverse effect on feed intake, average daily weight gain, feed conversion ratio and nutrients utilization (except ether extract) of adult indigenous Senegal chickens. It has significantly (p<0.05) improved the crude protein and metabolizable energy utilization in birds fed the 7% level inclusion diet (LL7). © Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - One hundred and fifty-five extracts from 93 terrestrial species of plants in Peninsula Malaysia were screened for in vitro photo-cytotoxic activity by means of a cell viability test using a human leukaemia cell-line HL60. These plants which can be classified into 43 plant families are diverse in their type of vegetation and their natural habitat in the wild, and may therefore harbour equally diverse metabolites with potential pharmaceutical properties. Of these, 29 plants, namely three from each of the Clusiaceae, Leguminosae, Rutaceae and Verbenaceae families, two from the Piperaceae family and the remaining 15 are from Acanthaceae, Apocynaceae, Bignoniaceae, Celastraceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Irvingiaceae, Lauraceae, Lythraceae, Malvaceae, Meliaceae, Moraceae, Myristicaceae, Myrsinaceae, Olacaceae and Sapindaceae. Hibiscus cannabinus (Malvaceae), Ficus deltoidea (Moraceae), Maranthes corymbosa (Chrysobalanaceae), Micromelum sp., Micromelum minutum and Citrus hystrix (Rutaceae), Cryptocarya griffithiana (Lauraceae), Litchi chinensis (Sapindaceae), Scorodocarpus bornensis (Olacaceae), Kokoona reflexa (Celastraceae), Irvingia malayana (Irvingiaceae), Knema curtisii (Myristicaceae), Dysoxylum sericeum (Meliaceae), Garcinia atroviridis, Garcinia mangostana and Calophyllum inophyllum (Clusiaceae), Ervatamia hirta (Apocynaceae), Cassia alata, Entada phaseoloides and Leucaena leucocephala (Leguminosae), Oroxylum indicum (Bignoniaceae), Peronema canescens, Vitex pubescens and Premna odorata (Verbenaceae), Piper mucronatum and Piper sp. (Piperaceae), Ardisia crenata (Myrsinaceae), Lawsonia inermis (Lythraceae), Strobilanthes sp. (Acanthaceae) were able to reduce the in vitro cell viability by more than 50% when exposed to 9.6 J/cm2 of a broad spectrum light when tested at a concentration of 20 μg/mL. Six of these active extracts were further fractionated and bio-assayed to yield four photosensitisers, all of which are based on the pheophorbide-a and -b core structures. Our results suggest that the main photosensitisers from terrestrial plants are likely based on the cyclic tetrapyrrole structure and photosensitisers with other structures, if present, are present in minor amounts or are not as active as those with the cyclic tetrapyrrole structure. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Expression of Rhizobium pydA-pydB fusion gene in Nicotiana tabacum confers resistance to the toxic aromatic compound 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone
PY  - 2009

AB  - The toxic aromatic compound 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone (HP) is an intermediate in both synthesis and degradation of mimosine, which is produced by the tree legume Leucaena leucocephala. The L. leucocephala root-nodule symbiont Rhizobium TAL1145 contains a dioxygenase (pydA) and a hydrolase (pydB) gene that produce enzymes necessary for the degradation of HP. In order to coordinately express both genes in plant tissues under a single promoter, three different pydA-pydB fusion constructs (G0, G3, and G7) with varying glycine linkers between the two genes were developed. Prior to transferring the fusion constructs into L. leucocephala, which is highly recalcitrant to genetic transformation, we tested the expression and activity of the hybrid proteins in Nicotiana tabacum, a model plant system that can be easily transformed and analyzed. Seven independent transgenic tobacco lines were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and stable integration and expression of pydA-pydB in these transgenic lines were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western analysis. Only one of the fusion constructs, G3, containing a 9-nucleotide linker between pydA and pydB, provided significant levels of resistance to 3 mM HP, indicating that the hybrid protein produced by this fusion construct could degrade HP. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Reassessment of the biology and host range of acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae), a seed-feeding beetle released for the biological control of leucaena leucocephala in South Africa

AB  - Introduced for agroforestry, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (Fabaceae) has become naturalized in several countries worldwide and constitutes an 'emerging weed' in South Africa. The seed beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) was inadvertently introduced to many of these countries via contaminated seeds, but was deliberately introduced into South Africa for biological control. Following an isolated report of non-target feeding in the field in southeastern Asia, this study was aimed at re-evaluating aspects of the beetle's biology, in particular the likelihood of non-target attacks on native mimosoid Fabaceae that are closely related to L. leucocephala. A preliminary field assessment of the beetle's susceptibility to native parasitoids was also undertaken. The beetle's life cycle includes several attributes (e.g. rapid reproductive maturation, high rates of oviposition) that favour high population densities in the field. Although adults oviposited on the seeds of all test plant species during no-choice tests, oviposition was significantly higher on L. leucocephala. While several hatching larvae survived to adulthood on L. leucocephala, single adult individuals were reared from the seeds of each of three non-target species. Also, during multichoice tests, the beetles displayed strong oviposition preferences for L. leucocephala. Two hymenopteran parasitoid species were reared from seeds containing larvae which were exposed in the field, but overall levels of parasitism were low. These results confirm that the host range of A. macrophthalmus is largely restricted to the genus Leucaena, that native mimosoid Fabaceae are unlikely to be at risk and that the decision taken in 1999 to release the beetle was justified.

AB  - There are great concerns about degradation of agricultural soils. It has been suggested that cultivating different plant species intercropped with coffee plants can increase microbial diversity and enhance soil sustainability. The objective of this study was to evaluate enzyme activity (urease, arylsulfatase and phosphatase) and alterations in C and N mineralization rates as related to different legume cover crops planted between rows of coffee plants. Soil samples were collected in a field experiment conducted for 10 years in a sandy soil in the North of Paraná State, Brazil. Samples were collected from the 0-10 cm layer, both from under the tree canopy and in-between rows in the following treatments: control, Leucaena leucocephala, Crotalaria spectabilis, Crotalaria breviflora, Mucuna pruriens, Mucuna deeringiana, Arachis hypogaea and Vigna unguiculata. The soil was sampled in four stages of legume cover crops: pre-planting (September), after planting (November), flowering stage (February) and after plant residue incorporation (April), from 1997 to 1999. The green manure species influenced soil enzyme activity (urease, arylsulfatase and phosphatase) and C and N mineralization rates, both under the tree canopy and in-between rows. Cultivation of Leucaena leucocephala increased acid phosphatase and arilsulfatase activity and C and N mineralization both under the tree canopy and in-between rows. Intercropped L. leucocephala increased urease activity under the tree canopy while C. breviflora increased urease activity in-between rows.

AB  - NAZRI WM, JAMALUDIN K, RUDAINI MN, RAHIM S & NOR YUZIAH MY. 2009. Effects of chemical components on properties of oriented strand board from Leucaena leucocephala wood. Chemical components of wood strongly influence the characteristics, properties and opportunities for use of natural composites. The main objective of the study was to determine basic chemical components of Leucaena leucocephala from 8- and 16-year-old trees and to correlate the effects of chemical components with properties of its oriented strand board. Besides age, the effects of tree portions, namely, top, middle and bottom were also studied. Leucaena leucocephala wood was analysed for holocellulose, lignin, ash and ethanol-toluene, cold water, hot water and 1% natrium hydroxide solubles. Oriented strand boards which were produced from the samples were evaluated for their mechanical and physical properties based on two resin levels (7 and 9%), two target board densities (700 and 800 kg m-3) and two strand sizes, namely, S1 (12.7-19.0 mm) and S2 (6.3-12.7 mm). This study revealed that tree portion significantly affected cold and hot water solubles, the solubilities of alkali and alcohol toluene, and also the ash and holocellulose contents of L. leucocephala. Only the solubility of alcohol toluene and lignin and holocellulose contents were affected by age. Although the correlation of some chemical components was significant, the correlation coefficients were relatively small, thus, indicating the loose association between the factors and board properties. It could be deduced that board properties had less association with chemical components but were more dependent on the resin content, board density and strand size used in the study. Generally, 8-year-old wood was found to be a suitable raw material for the manufacture of oriented strand board.

AB  - Aims: To assess the phenotypic, symbiotic and genotypic diversity scope of Mesorhizobium spp. strains associated with Acacia seyal (Del.) isolated from different agro-ecological zones in Senegal, and uses of susceptible microbial inoculum in a reafforestation process. Methods and Results: A polyphasic approach including phenotypic and genotypic techniques was used to study the diversity and their relationships with other biovars and species of rhizobia. The geographical origins of the strains have limited effect on their phylogenetic and phenotypic classification. Nodulation tests indicated promiscuity of the strains studied, because they were capable of nodulating six woody legume species (Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia senegal, A. seyal, Acacia tortilis ssp. raddiana, Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis juliflora). Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of nodA, nodC and nifH genes pointed out that in contrast to nodA gene, the phylogenies of nodC and nifH genes were not consistent with that of 16S rRNA, indicating that these genes of the A. seyal-nodulating rhizobia might have different origins. Microbial inoculation on nonsterile soil had significant effect on the nodules number and the growth of the seedlings, indicating that these strains of rhizobia might be used as inoculum. Conclusions: The results indicated that A. seyal is a nonselective host that can establish effective symbiosis with Mesorhizobium spp. strains from diverse genomic backgrounds and that the selected A. seyal-nodulating rhizobia could enhance plant growth. Significance and Impact of the Study: These results showed the important role that A. seyal could play in the improvement of reafforestation process as a promiscuous host, which can establish effective symbiosis with rhizobia from diverse genomic backgrounds. © 2009 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

AB  - Some native rhizobia nodulating Acacia seyal, Acacia saligna, Dalbergia sisso, Macarium tipu, Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania sesban were isolated from 10 different soil types along the Nile valley, North and South Sinai. While virgin soil samples of South Sinai showed no specific rhizobia nodulating D. sisso, M. tipu, L. leucocephala, and A. seyal, profuse nodulation was recorded with S. sesban and A. saligna in almost all soils. Nodule shape differed according to the host tree from globose to semi globose except L. leucocephala which formed elongated branched nodules. Slow-growing alkaline, producing rhizobia nodulating D. sisso, M. tipu and A. seyal formed small colonies of 1-2 mm diameter. On the other hand, rhizobia isolated from L. leucocephala, A. saligna and S. sesban were fast-growing acid producing candidates forming large-sized colonies of up to 4 mm in diameter. Rhizobia nodulating M. tipu as well as the reference strains R. leguminosarum bv. Viceae (441) and R. meliloti (ARC and A2) showed a minimum inhibitory Na-azide concentration of 15μg/ml. In addition, MIC of around 35 μg/ml Na-azide was recorded for rhizobia nodulating S. sesban and A. saligna as well as the reference strains R. leguminosarum bv. Trifoli (TAL and ARC100) and bv. Phaseoli (1899 and ARC305). However, D. sisso and A. seyal rhizobia were highly sensitive to the presence of 5μg/ml Na-azide in their growth medium. The legume tree rhizobia slightly varied in their resistance to four examined antibiotics and displayed scanty growth at 40oC. Salt (NaCl) concentration up to 4% in the growth medium of the isolates substantially retarded their growth and elongated their mean generation time. The examined tree legume rhizobia displayed high levels of host specificity where D. sisso and M. tipu profusely nodulated merely when inoculated with their specific rhizobial isolates. © 2010, INSInet Publication.

AB  - In this method, Leucaena leucocephala seed pods (LLSP) have been used for removal of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solution. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to study the effect of process parameters like pH, contact time initial Cu(II) ions concentration and adsorbent dose. The maximum adsorption of Cu(II) ions on Leucaena leucocephala seed pods was 94.17% at pH 5. The amount of metal adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent increases with time and reach equilibrium after 30 minutes of shaking time for the different initial metal concentrations. The Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm equations were applied for the equilibrium adsorption data and the various isotherm parameters were evaluated. The obtained plots were linear as evident from R2 values close to unity. The data agreed very well with the pseudo second-order kinetic model.

AB  - The productive performance of twenty-four 5/8 Holstein x 3/8 Zebu crossbred bulls of 490 d of age was evaluated from 228.28 kg of liveweight (LW) until 412.24 kg of LW at slaughter. The animals grazed in 6 ha of a silvopastoral system at 100% association of Leucaena leucocephala and grasses. In the dry season, in alternate days, they had access to 2 ha of biomass bank of Pennisetum purpureum cv. Cuba CT-115. Each area was divided into 8 paddocks. The auto-grazing was used without fertilization or irrigation. The occupation and resting times were of 7 and 49 d, respectively. The stocking rate was of 3 and 4 animals/ha in the silvopastoral system plus the biomass bank and in the silvopastoral system in the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. They consumed 1.50 kg/animal/d of rumen activating supplement. The daily average gain (DAG) of LW was of 519.35 and 609.76 g for the dry and rainy season, respectively. The system guaranteed the fulfillment of the protein requirements and permitted supplying 1.24 t/ha of LW at slaughter, with animals of 26.72 months of age. It was corroborated the need for working with smaller stocking rates and/or supplements with higher nutritive value to increase the DAG of LW and slaughter at early ages and get better market results.

AB  - A sessile (water) drop deposited onto a superhydrophobic surface can stay in two different regimes: the heterogeneous (or Cassie-Baxter) regime, where air or vapour is trapped at the interface, or the homogenous (or Wenzel) regime, where the interface is completely wet. Often, a spontaneous transition from the first to the second regime may occur in time. We report on a study of this phenomenon in a new kind of superhydrophobic surfaces, characterized by a relevant spatial disorder. The observed transition follows a behaviour quite different respect to the one measured in the commonly used periodic artificial arrays. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate the effect of the root architecture on the shear strength increment provided by plant roots in the soil. In situ shear tests were conducted for this purpose. Five plant species - Hibiscus tiliaceus L. (Linden hibiscus), Mallotus japonicus (Thunb.) Muell.-Arg. (Japanese Mallotus), Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb. (Chinese tallow tree), Casuarina equisetifolia L. (ironwood), and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) (white popinac) - were used in this study. Tensile tests on roots of various diameters and surveys on the root system structure were carried out for each of the plant species tested. The shear strength increments (ΔS) provided by the roots of Linden hibiscus, Japanese Mallotus, Chinese tallow tree, ironwood, and white popinac were 0.34tR, 0.462tR, 0.688tR, 0.3tR, and 0.87tR, respectively, when tR was estimated on the basis of the tensile root strength crossing through the shear plane. The shear strength increment provided by plant roots with conspicuous oblique and vertical roots was greater than that of root structures in which lateral roots were dominant. In comparison with other types of root architecture, the R-type root architecture was found to be the most effective root system against shear failure in the soil. Its shear strength increment was slightly greater than that with the V-type root architecture, followed by the VH-type root architecture. The shear strength increment provided by plants with the H-type root architecture was less effective than that contributed by plant species with other types of root architecture. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Using the main components (ACP) and automatic classification (ACA) analysis, the variations of the fodder potential of twenty species in Trujillo state, Venezuela, according to the propagation method (stake and botanical seed) were studied. The production of edible biomass, the relative acceptability by goats and the chemical composition were evaluated. Independently of the propagation form, a high variability for the first three components were detected (64.3-72.8%). The fibre neuter detergent, ash, and phenolic fraction showed the biggest fluctuations among the species. The edible biomass production, proteic and terpenoids levels and preferences showed low inter-specific variations. The species with better integral results were Morus alba, Chlorophora tinctoria, Cordia alba, Pentaclethra macroloba, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Wedelia aff. caracasana, Gliricidia sepium, and Guazuma ulmifolia. However, by the fodder potential index, Pithecellobium pedicellare and Bauhinia cumanensis were identified as promissory. Trichantera gigantea, Tithonia diversifolia, Capparis odoratissima, Moringa oleifera, and Leucaena leucocephala exhibited an intermediate potential. However, the biomass of Acacia spp., Azadirachta indica, Bulnesia arborea, Cassia alata, and Samanea saman presented little use feasibility as forage. The production of edible biomass and the acceptability constituted the most relevant variables to estimate the fodder potential. In the evaluated species the goat acceptability related with the fibre (P<0.05) and terpenoids (P<0.01) levels. No relationship among acceptability and phenolic compounds level were observed.

TI  - Coexistence and transition between Cassie and Wenzel state on pillared hydrophobic surface
PY  - 2009
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-66649112452&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.0902027106&partnerID=40&md5=29d01f8723181ec0af7e833160de5fe7
AB  - Water droplets on rugged hydrophobic surfaces typically exhibit one of the following two states: (i) the Wenzel state [Wenzel RN (1936) Ind Eng Chem 28:988-994] in which water droplets are in full contact with the rugged surface (referred as the wetted contact) or (ii) the Cassie state [Cassie, ABD, Baxter S (1944) Trans Faraday Soc 40:546-551] in which water droplets are in contact with peaks of the rugged surface as well as the "air pockets" trapped between surface grooves (the composite contact). Here, we show large-scale molecular dynamics simulation of transition between Wenzel state and Cassie state of water droplets on a periodic nanopillared hydrophobic surface. Physical conditions that can strongly affect the transition include the height of nanopillars, the spacing between pillars, the intrinsic contact angle, and the impinging velocity of water nanodroplet ("raining" simulation). There exists a critical pillar height beyond which water droplets on the pillared surface can be either in the Wenzel state or in the Cassie state, depending on their initial location. The free-energy barrier separating the Wenzel and Cassie state was computed on the basis of a statistical-mechanics method and kinetic raining simulation. The barrier ranges from a few tenths of kBT 0 (where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T0 is the ambient temperature) for a rugged surface at the critical pillar height to ≈8 kBT0 for the surface with pillar height greater than the length scale of water droplets. For a highly rugged surface, the barrier from the Wenzel-to-Cassie state is much higher than from Cassie-to-Wenzel state. Hence, once a droplet is trapped deeply inside the grooves, it would be much harder to relocate on top of high pillars.

AB  - The use of the tree-legume Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena), which contains high levels of proteins in its foliage, is limited due to the presence of the toxic free amino acid mimosine. The goal of this research was to develop transgenic leucaena with reduced mimosine content. Two genes, pydA and pydB, encoding a meta-cleavage dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.2) and a pyruvate hydrolase (EC 3.7.1.6), respectively, from the mimosine-degrading leucaena symbiont Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145, were used to transform leucaena. These bacterial genes were sequence-optimized for expression in leucaena and cloned into the plant binary vector pCAMBIA3201 for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Using immature zygotic embryos as the start explant material, six pydA and three pydB transgenic lines were developed. The presence and expression of the bacterial genes in the transgenic lines were verified by PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR, and Southern analyses. HPLC analyses of the transgenic plants determined that the mimosine contents of the pydA-expressing lines were reduced up to 22.5% in comparison to the wild-type. No significant reduction in mimosine content was observed in the pydB-expressing lines. This is the first example of using a gene from a bacterial symbiont to reduce the toxicity of a tree-legume. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is well documented that a bioengineering approach has recently regained a global recognition in preventing and controlling surface run-off, erosion and landslides. However, there is a lack of documentation on the root mechanical properties available especially in Malaysia. In this study, both pull-out and tensile strength of some tropical plants namely Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia mangium and Melastoma malabathricum is investigated on different stem sizes. Plots of pull-out capacity against displacement in L. leucocephala exhibit the presence of two peak values. Closer examination concludes that the first peak indicates the failure of the lateral roots and the second peaks is achieved when the tap roots failed. As for the tensile strength tests, results showed that the tensile strength decreases with increasing root diameter. The results also indicate that there is no correlation observed between the tensile strength, root length and root moisture content. Amongst the species, the highest root tensile strength was observed in L. leucocephala, followed by A. mangium and M. malabathricum. Thus, the study suggests that L. leucocephala is the best choice for slope stabilization work as it exhibits outstanding root mechanical properties. © 2010 Academic Journals.

AB  - The layers experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of different levels of leucaena seed (0, 8, 16 and 24%) on 27 weeks of old laying hens. Parameters studied were egg production, external and internal quality characteristics of eggs, haematological indices and plasma constituents. Feed intake, henday egg production, FCR (kg feed/kg egg) and FCR (kg feed/dozens of egg) were depressed with the inclusion of leucaena seeds. Thereafter, birds were placed on control diet for two weeks, which revealed improvement of the performance except for FCR (kg feed/dozens of egg) for birds fed 24% leucaena seeds. Higher egg weight, maximum length and egg shell surface were recorded for birds fed 16% leucaena seeds compared to the others. Maximum width, shell weight and shell% were reduced for birds fed 24% leucaena seeds. Internal quality characteristics of eggs were not significantly affected by the dietary treatments except albumin weight, albumin%, yolk index and yolk color score. Yolk color score consistently increased with the inclusion of leucaena seeds. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2009.

TI  - Supplementary feeding on the nutrient balance of lactating dairy cow at contrasting temperature regimes: Assessment using cornell net carbohydrate and protein system (CNCPS) model

AB  - Dairy cows often do not receive adequate nutrient supply during their lactation period. This condition can even be worse if the environmental temperature is not in comfortable range which may occur especially in tropical regions. The present research was aimed to simulate the effect of supplementary feeding on nutrient balance of lactating dairy cow at contrasting temperature regimes using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) model. Treatments consisted of feeds (R1: Pennisetum purpureum, R2: P. purpureum + concentrate (60:40), R3: P. purpureum + Gliricidia sepium + Leucaena leucocephala (60:20:20), R4: P. purpureum + concentrate + G. sepium + L. leucocephala (60:20:10:10)) and environmental temperatures (T1: 20oC, T2: 30oC). The dairy cow inputs in CNCPS were Holstein breed, body weight of 500 kg, feed intake of 15 kg (dry matter basis) per day and produced milk 15 kg/day. Based on the CNCPS model, there were negative balances of metabolisable energy (ME) and metabolisable protein (MP) if a lactating dairy cow fed only by P. purpureum. The ME balance was worse at higher temperature, while the MP balance was remain unchanged. Addition of concentrate mixture (R2) fulfilled the ME and MP requirements as well as other nutrients. Addition of leguminous tree leaves (R3 and R4) improved the nutritional status of the lactating cow model compared to R1, but did not better than R2. It was concluded that supplementary feeding is necessary for improving the nutrient balance of lactating dairy cow, especially when the cow is maintained under uncomfortable environmental temperature. © 2009 Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture.

TI  - Irradiance, external carbon dioxide concentration and temperature influence photosynthesis in tropical cover crop legumes
PY  - 2010
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77952972296&partnerID=40&md5=190ca89d7d3e7a877e5882347b02c9b6
AB  - In plantation crops, perennial tropical legumes are grown as understory plants, where they receive limited irradiance and can be subjected to elevated levels of CO2. Independent shortterm effects of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), external carbon dioxide concentration [CO2] and temperature on net photosynthesis (Pn), internal CO2 (Ci), stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration (E) were assessed in 5 tropical perennial legume cover crops (calopo, jack bean, mucuna, white lead tree and perennial peanut). These legumes responded differently to changing PPFD, external [CO 2] and temperature. In all legume species studied, reducing PPFD from 1000 to 50 μmol/m2/s reduced Pn to less than 10% of that at the higher light level. Increasing the external [CO2] from 250 to 700 cm3/m3 doubled Pn. Increasing temperature from 30°C to 35°C reduced Pn in calopo, jack bean and mucuna and increased Pn in white lead tree and perennial peanut, but magnitude of the differences was small. Gs increased with PPFD in all species except perennial peanut, but decreased substantially as external [CO2] increased only in white lead tree. Early in the establishment of plantations, soils receive nearly full sunlight. However, with increasing age, the amount of light reaching ground level is decreased drastically, to as low as 80-200 μmol/m2/s. Cover crops that can grow in low light might survive longer and better protect the soil from erosion. Responses of these perennial legumes under the conditions imposed have shown that white lead tree and calopo would perform better than the other species as cover crops in tree plantations, where they would be subjected to high levels of shading. However, management of the tree canopy would be important to allow sufficient light through to achieve acceptable growth rates in the cover crops.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is a fast growing multipurpose legume tree used for forage, leaf manure, paper and pulp. Lignin in Leucaena pulp adversely influences the quality of paper produced. Developing transgenic Leucaena with altered lignin by genetic engineering demands an optimized regeneration system. The present study deals with optimization of regeneration system for L. leucocephala cv. K636. Multiple shoot induction from the cotyledonary nodes of L. leucocephala was studied in response to cytokinins, thidiazuron (TDZ) and N6-benzyladenine (BA) supplemented in half strength MS (1/2-MS) medium and also their effect on in vitro rooting of the regenerated shoots. Multiple shoots were induced from cotyledonary nodes at varied frequencies depending on the type and concentration of cytokinin used in the medium. TDZ was found to induce more number of shoots per explant than BA, with a maximum of 7 shoots at an optimum concentration of 0.23 μM. Further increase in TDZ concentration resulted in reduced shoot length and fasciation of the shoots. Liquid pulse treatment of the explants with TDZ did not improve the shoot production further but improved the subsequent rooting of the shoots that regenerated. Regenerated shoots successfully rooted on 1/2-MS medium supplemented with 0.54 μM α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Rooted shoots of Leucaena were transferred to coco-peat and hardened plantlets showed ≥ 90 % establishment in the green house. © 2009 Prof. H.S. Srivastava Foundation for Science and Society.

AB  - In tropical regions with well-defined wet and dry seasons, repeated wetting and drying cycles can harden exposed soils and inhibit root growth. While this phenomenon has been well documented, the relationships between plant productivity and chemical and physical soil parameters have not been well defined. The current study identifies the abiotic parameters that best relate to measures of plant development, specifically to corn productivity. The primary goal of this research was to provide information to improve agricultural sustainability in humid tropical ecosystems. The effects of using plant residues as a cover on a sandy soil were studied. Four leguminous species were planted in an alley cropping system, Leucaena leucocephala, Cajanus cajan, Clitoria fairchildiana and Acacia mangium, and corn was planted in January 2007 between legume rows. We measured the most important chemical and physical soil parameters. Yield indicators included cob weight and the weight of 100 kernels. The application of plant residues altered soil conditions and increased rootable soil volume. This change was associated with an increase by 10% in water retention above field capacity in the uppermost soil layer of the residue-covered sections of the experiment. In the control sections cobs were up to three times lighter (31.43-93.38 g) in the bare soil control than those from residue-covered sections of the experiment. Dynamic indicators related to nutrient absorption and crop evapotranspiration, such as the number of days with water stress and rootable soil volume, were the most suitable indicators for assessing soil quality. The response of corn was best related to complex physical indicators, including the amount of N applied via legume residues. © 2009 British Society of Soil Science.

AB  - Goats fed Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) at an experimental site in Thailand were shown to be excreting DHP in their urine. This was unexpected as earlier results from another site had shown that goats and cattle fed leucaena did not excrete DHP and so possessed DHP-degrading bacteria. Goats sampled near the earlier sample site excreted no DHP in their urine. Rumen fluid taken from these goats was successfully used to transfer DHP-degrading ability to the goats at the Experimental site some 350 km away that did not show the presence of DHP-degrading bacteria. Degradation of mimosine in-vitro and excretion of DHP in the urine ceased 72 hr after addition of rumen fluid and infusion with rumen fluid from protected goats, respectively. The situation in Thailand may not be unique. Countries where leucaena is fed should check that animals are protected. Fortunately, the ferric chloride urine test is simple to use and effective in detecting the problem and also the recovery after transfer of rumen fluid from protected animals. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The data from 149 Siboney de Cuba upgraded heifers of 128.9 ± 5.01 kg of liveweight (LW) with 9.2 ± 0.4 months of age were used, as well as those from 30 yearlings-heifers of 12 months of age and 227.8 ± 7.01 kg of LW, to study the growth and reproduction in systems of management and feeding with grasses and legumes, in correspondence with the growth stage. The heifers and yearling-heifers were spread in two treatments: A) grazing on a mixture of Pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens) and stylo (Stylosanthes guianensis), and B) grazing of Pangola grass without association for calves; A) mixture of tree legumes (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru) with Guinea grass Likoni (Panicum maximum) and B) Guinea grass Likoni for yearlings-heifers. The calves were grazing in 12 paddocks and the yearlings-heifers, in six. The grazing time was in the afternoon and at night (4:00 p.m. to 10:00 a.m., with 1.3 LAU/ha, in both groups and categories). The pasture availability, was determined both in rainy and dry conditions. The animals were weighed every 30 d. Blood and soil samples were collected for the analysis. The data were analyzed through linear model. In calves, the grass associated had values of crude protein (CP) of 9.75% and the non-associated grass, of 7.03%. The increment in LW of the calves was different (P < 0.001) and favored that grazing in the association. In yearlings-heifers, the association reached yield of 0.478 t of DM/rotation, and during the study there was daily increase of weight of 513.8 ± 22.4. The blood metabolites were kept within the physiological ranges established for the species and category. The content of nitrogen in the grass without association was of 5.1% of CP (SD ± 0.021), whereas in the associated grass it was of 7.37% (SD ± 0.110). The age of incorporation to reproduction was of 21.3 months, the interval incorporation-insemination, of 18.5 d, and the gestation, of 22 months. The results show the potentials of legumes and their contribution to the system under study to attain a quality heifer production, especially when used according to the physiological growth stage.

TI  - Moisture conservation and nitrogen recycling through legume mulching in rainfed maize (Zea mays)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping system
PY  - 2010
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954027320&doi=10.1007%2fs10705-009-9327-y&partnerID=40&md5=fae39a7c0ffc20fef65c5cf26596b769
AB  - Mulching with vegetative materials is a highly beneficial and widely-investigated agro-technique in rainfed areas but the adoption of this practice has been constrained due to non-availability of mulch biomass locally. Live mulching with fast-growing annual green manure legumes like sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea) or prunings of Leucaena leucocephala grown as hedge rows can be done for moisture conservation as well as nutrient cycling in the maize-wheat cropping system, which is predominantly followed in the high rainfall sub-mountainous region of north-western India. A field experiment was conducted at Selakui, Dehradun during 2000-2004 to study the effect of legume mulching, viz. in situ grown sunnhemp and Leucaena prunings, along with varying N levels, viz. 0, 30, 60 and 90 kg N ha-1 (to maize), and 0, 40 and 80 kg N ha-1 (to wheat) on productivity, soil moisture conservation and soil physico-chemical properties. Intercropped sunnhemp added 0.75-1.45 t dry matter and 21.6-41. 3 kg N ha-1 at 30-35 days, while Leucaena twigs added 1.89-4.15 t dry matter and 75. 2-161. 3 kg N ha-1 at 60-65 days of maize growth. Live mulching with sunnhemp or Leucaena biomass improved soil moisture content at maize harvest (+1.15-1.57%) and crop productivity by 6.8-8.8% over no mulching. Combined use of both the mulching materials was more effective in improving the soil moisture content (+2.08-2.29%) and grain yield (15.1%) over their single application. Response of maize to N fertilizer application was significant up to 90 kg N ha-1, and it was relatively more pronounced under the mulching treatments. Residual effect of mulching on wheat showed an increase in yield of 10.2% with sunnhemp or Leucaena, and 27.9% with sunnhemp + Leucaena. There was an improvement in organic C and total N status of soil, and a decrease in bulk density associated with an increase in infiltration rate due to mulching at the end of 4 cropping cycles. It was concluded that legume mulching is a highly beneficial practice for enhanced moisture and nutrient conservation, leading to increased productivity and soil health of maize-wheat cropping system under Doon valley conditions of north-western India. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Potential of short rotation woody crops for pulp fiber production from arable lands in India
PY  - 2009

AB  - Wood fiber is used for the manufacture of various kinds of paper, packaging material, tissues, paperboard etc. The conventional soft woods and hard woods used as raw materials by pulp, paper and cellulose based industries are depleting day by day and the wood imports are draining country's foreign exchange. Short rotation industrial agroforestry plantations with the fast growing tree species are potential sources to fill this gap and to make the nation self reliant in pulpwood supply. Poplar, eucalyptus, leucaena and bamboo are the ideal species that can be grown commercially in private lands for meeting the wood requirements and has the potential to produce a biomass of 18 to 49 t/ha per year. The pulp yield from these species ranges from 40 to 49% of the wood biomass produced. With the expansion of wood markets, high biomass yields and amenability for harvesting in short rotations, short rotation woody crops can be one of the profitable options for fiber production on lands which are not suitable for intensive arable cropping. Some of the important fiber supplying species which are grown under Indian conditions and their agroforestry systems and profitability aspects are discussed in the paper.

AB  - The tetrazolium test is a useful alternative for seed viability and vigor evaluation because besides producing rapid results it can also identify the causes of lost viability. This test is recommended for the evaluation of the viability of seeds that have to be sown soon after harvest and also complements germination tests for seeds that present dormancy. For each species, the efficiency of the tetrazolium test depends on the development of appropriate methodology that includes appropriate methods for pre-conditioning, preparation and staining of the seeds. We evaluated preparation and staining methods for applying the tetrazolium test to leucaena seeds and verified the efficiency of this test for assessing the viability of leucaena seeds using seeds from Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham and the interspecific hybrid (L. leucocephala x diversifolia CPAC 4111. Two seed preparation methods were tested, a lateral cut and a lateral cut followed by immersion in water for one hour at 30 °C and subsequent seed coat removal. The seeds were stained with 0.075%, 0.15% or 1% tetrazolium solution for two or four hours at 35°C and then evaluated. The tetrazolium test results were compared with the results of standard germination and seedling emergence tests. Our results show that subjecting the seeds to a lateral cut and seed coat removal and then submersing them in 0.15% tetrazolium solution for two hours is an efficient method for evaluating leucaena seed viability.

AB  - Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd. is a very important multipurpose species in Egypt and many other countries. It is valued as forestry and as an ornamental tree. Its flowers produce a perfume called "cassie" extensively used in European perfumery. The present study aims to the determination of the effect of helium-Neon (He-Ne) light irradiation on accelerating the germination of A. farnesiana seeds, which have dormancy due to impermeability of seed coat of water. The seeds were exposed to He-Ne laser light for 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 minutes with different irradiance 0.03, 0.20, 0.61, 1.14, and 1.70 W/cm2. Gibberellic acid (GA), indole-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA) as well as phenols were determined after 48h in treated and untreated seeds. Thin sections in the testa were also made. Germination indices: the time to germinate, germination period, germination percentage and germination speed were determined. The results showed that irradiation by the laser beam of the seed coat, (testa or pericarp, the envelope enclosing the seed embryo), succeeded in perforating the seed coat at one or more positions. Generally, an increase in irradiance and exposure time of He-Ne laser light irradiation increased levels of endogenous promoting substances (GA and IAA), and decreased levels of endogenous inhibiting substances (ABA and phenol) in seed coats. We conclude that irradiance of seeds with He-Ne laser light at 1.70 W/cm2 for 9 min. significantly affected germination indices when compared with control seeds.

AB  - Litterfall and fine root production is a major pathway for carbon and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. We investigated leaf litterfall, fine-root mass, production and turnover rate in the upper soil (0-30 cm) under four major tree species (Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, Prosopis juliflora) of the semi-arid region of India. All the four tree species showed an unimodal peak of leaf litterfall with distinct seasonality. Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia nilotica had maximum leaf litterfall between September and December while Azadirachta indica and Prosopis juliflora shed most of their leaves between February and May. Annual leaf litterfall of the four species ranged from 3.3 Mg ha -1 (Leucaena leucocephala) to 8.1 Mg ha -1 (Prosopis juliflora). Marked seasonal variations in amount of fine root biomass were observed in all the four tree species. Fine root production was maximum in Prosopis juliflora (171 g m -2 y -1) followed by Azadirachta indica (169 g m -2 y -1), Acacia nilotica (106 g m -2 y -1) and Leucaena leucocephala (79 g m -2 y -1). Fine root biomass showed a seasonal peak after the rainy season but fell to its lowest value during the winter and dry summer season. Fine root turnover rate ranged from 0.56 to 0.97 y -1 and followed the order Azadirachta indica > Leucaena leucocephala > Prosopis juliflora > Acacia nilotica. The results of this study demonstrated that Prosopis juliflora and Azadirachta indica had greater capability for maintaining site productivity as evidenced from greater leaf litterfall and fine root production. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.

AB  - An experimental trial was conducted at Dhabeji area to see the effect of chemical industry waste (organic with heavy metals) on seed bank of barren area of Dhabeji. An industrial sludge and its ash content were used in different concentrations, 10Kg and 20Kg sludge, 10kg and 20kg ash respectively to see the effect on seed bank, germination and growth of wild plants. After rainfall 17 species appeared in control viz., Gynandropsis gynandra (L.) Briq., Aerva javanica (Burm. f.) Juss, Zygophyllum simplex L., Tribulus terrestris L., Dactyloctenium scindicum Boiss, Chloris barbata Sw., Cyperus rotundus L., Indigofera cordifolia Heyne ex Roth, Salsola baryosma (R.& S.) Dandy, Indigofera hochstetteri Baker and Heliotropium strigosum Willd, while remaining 6 species viz., Digera muricata (L.) Mart., Amaranthus viridis L., Blepharis sindica stocks ex T. Anders, Panicum antidotale Retz., Prosopis juliflora (Swartz) DC. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de-Wit were recorded in control and treated plots. Number of seedlings, height, fresh weight and dry weight of these species were determined. It has been observed that 20kg sludge showed better response on fresh weight and dry weight of D. muricata, A. viridis and P. antidotale while the same treatment seemed to have positive effect on germination and height of L. leucocephala. It is suggested that this particular type of industrial waste is toxic (due to heavy metals) to some species while some species showed better growth due to presence of organic matter.

AB  - Poverty alleviation and environmental preservation are very important issues to many governments. Alley farming is beneficial to the environment because it conserves soil and sustains yields over time. Specifically, alley farming reduces soil erosion, which is a major problem in Thailand. Alley farming was conducted on a farmer's field at Khaokwan Thong, a village in Uthaithani Province, Northern Thailand. We did a two-by-two factorial with and without alley farming, and with and without fertilizer. From this study, we observed that the two species used, Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia auriculiformis, grow well in Thailand, and that alley farming is suitable for Thailand. Few Thai farmers have heard about alley farming. However, it is nevertheless useful to know that there is potential for alley farming in Thailand using the two species. These plants, based upon the diameter and height measurements provided, grew well. © 2010 by the authors.

AB  - The cDNA encoding the 326 amino acids of a Class I basic chitinase gene from Leucaena leucocephala de Wit (KB3, Genbank accession: AAM49597) was cloned under the control of CaMV35S promoter in pCAMBIA 1300 and transferred to Koshihikari. Calli of Koshihikari rice was transformed with agrobacterium with this construct expressing the chitinase and β-glucouronidase (GUS). The frequencies of calli 90% has been obtained from rice seedlings cultured on NB medium. The high regeneration frequencies, 74% was obtained from calli cultured on regeneration medium containing 4 mg/l BAP, and 7 g/l phytagel at 25°C. Various factors were studied in order to establish a procedure for the transformation of Koshihikari Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Supplementation of 50 mM acetosyringone to the medium during coculivation was important to enhance the frequency to transient transformation. The 4 week-old scutellum-derived calli were excellent starting materials. Selection medium based on NB medium supplement with 40 mg/l hygromycin and 400 mg/l cefotaxime were an optimized medium for selection of transformed rice calli. The percentage of transformation 70 was obtained. Recombinant calli and regenerated rice plants were checked the expression of chitinase and gus by PCR, northern blot gel, southern blot gel, and gus assay. Chitinase and gus were expressed in all parts of recombinant rice. The rice line expressing the KB3 chiitnase was more resistant to the blast fungus Fusarium monoliforme than control line.

AB  - Five exotic tree species (Acacia angustissima (Mil.) Kuntze, A. mangium Wild, Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Alp., Leucaena hybrid (L×L), and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) were investigated to determine whether parameters of nursery seedling stock quality could be used to predict their field performance in a plantation irrigated with treated waste-water to produce fodder and wood. Plants were grown in the nursery in two contrasting rooting substrates (ordinary nursery soil and sand), predicted to have different effects on resource allocation. Three categories of morphological indicators were measured, i.e., plant dimensions (height, diameter, root length), plant weights (shoot, root and whole plant weights) and indices (sturdiness quotient 'SQ', shoot:root dry weight ratio 'SRR' and Dickson's quality index 'DQI'). In the nursery, all species performed better in the ordinary nursery soil for all growth parameters except root length. Thus ordinary nursery substrate appeared superior to sand in terms of plant quality. However, a follow up at plantation phase revealed that only some morphological attributes or ratios were suitable to predict field performance for the five tested species in irrigated plantation. In addition, the effect of the substrate observed at the nursery stage had disappeared 12 months after out planting due to the availability of water and nutrients provided by the treated waste water used for the irrigation. The results showed that root collar diameter and DQI appeared to be the most appropriate indicators to predict the outplanting performance of the five tested species in a short-rotation irrigated plantation in semi-arid Burkina Faso. The former measure is simpler and non-destructive. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

AB  - Field trials were conducted for two consecutive years at the Teaching and Research Farm of the Obafemi Awolowo University in the tropical rainforest zone of Nigeria, to investigate the effects of Meloidogyne incognita, Pratylenchus spp., Paratylenchus spp. and Hoplolaimus spp. on three okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) cultivars planted in 4-m alleys between 3-year-old leguminous trees, Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium. A nematode-infested field without L. leucocephala and G. sepium was used as the control field. The leguminous trees were pruned at 3-weekly intervals to prevent shading of okra and the prunings were mulched in the alley field. At the termination of the study, okra cultivars in the non-alley field had higher root-knot nematode galling indices than those in the alley field in both the 2005 and 2006 trials. Fruit yields of okra cultivars were higher in the alley than the non-alley field. In the alley and non-alley fields, okra cv. 47-4 recorded the highest fruit yield in both years of the trial. Soil population densities of four genera of plant-parasitic nematodes increased in both the alley and non-alley fields. However, there was a much greater increase in the non-alley field, suggesting that L. leucocephala and G. sepium planted as alley crops have the potential to suppress nematode populations. © 2009 Australasian Plant Pathology Society.

Although several on-station trials have been done in the subhumid region of Zimbabwe, there have been no studies assessing on-farm yields of the introduced fodder species. This study evaluated productivity in a communal area under varying soil (pH, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) and management conditions (protection and tree density). Leaf productivity was high on farms with relatively higher soil P. Leaf yields ranged from 0.4-3.3 t DM ha-1 for A. angustissima, 0.8-5.6 t DM ha-1 for C. calothyrsus and 0.2-0.7 t DM ha-1 for L. leucocephala, with mean values of 2.2, 2.6 and 0.4 t DM ha-1, respectively. The low yields of L. leucocephala were associated with psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana) infestation. Decrease in tree density (low population) resulted in reduced yield. Poor performance was also attributed to uncontrolled browsing. Influence of soil characteristics could not be confirmed, but there were indications that low soil phosphorus may have adversely affected tree growth. The yields were generally lower than on-station, which implies that there is room for improving fodder tree yields in this subhumid region, through improving the availability of P, planting a high density of trees, and protecting them from uncontrolled browsing. © NISC Pty Ltd.

AB  - Tree and shrub forage production were evaluated during the dry season in three soil within a silvopastoral system (SPS) complementary to traditional, local cattle systems in Yucatan, Mexico. Soils were Epileptic cambisol (CMlep, 24 %), Endoskelectic cambisol (CMnsk, 21.3 %) and Rodic luvisol (LVro, 28.4 %). Three, 100 m2 quadrants were set in each soil and vegetation with >1.0 cm maximun tree diameter at breast height inventoried in each quadrant. Experimental design was a stratified block arrangement with each soil being a block. Nine forage species were identified within the SPS. Bauhinia divaricata was the most abundant overall with 1,148 individuals and had the largest population (577 individuals) in the LVro. Piscidia piscipula (n= 495) had the largest basal area (1.8 m2) of the forage species. After standardization cut, only three species produced new shoots: Leucaena leucocephala, P. piscipula and B. divaricada. Considering these three species, the highest forage yield was observed in the CMlep. In this soil, L. leucocephala produced higher amounts of DM per plant than B. divaricata and P. piscipula. L. leucocephala and P. piscipula had better overall yield in the CMlep. B. divaricata did not perform differently in the three studied soils but had greater yield, better cut response and a higher number of plants than L. leucocephala and P. piscipula. These three species are potentially useful as forage producers during the dry season and their yields could be improved by considering regional pedodiversity.

AB  - Purified condensed tannins (CT) extracted from the legumes Calliandra calothyrsus (var. San Ramón CIAT 22310 and var. Patulul CIAT 22316), Flemingia macrophylla (CIAT 17403) and Leucaena leucocephala (CIAT 734) were added to soybean meal in proportions of 0 (control), 300, 600 or 900 mg/g of the incubated crude protein (CP). Effects on degradation in ruminal fluid and ruminal fluid followed by incubation in HCl/pepsin were evaluated using a modified two-step in vitro method. When CT were added, dry matter (DM) and CP degradation in ruminal fluid were reduced (P<0.001). With the highest concentration of CT (i.e., 900 mg/g CP), ruminal DM degradation was reduced to 30% of the CT-free control. There was a 25-63% reduction in CP degradation in the rumen due to the addition of CT. The extent of the effect was dependent on the CT source (P<0.001). Depending on CT source, an increase in CT concentration also reduced (P<0.001) total DM and CP degradation (ruminal fluid+HCl/pepsin) by 24-73% and 16-55%, respectively. The proportion of incubated CP which was not degraded in ruminal fluid (estimated rumen escape CP) but degraded in HCl/pepsin increased by 18 and 412% depending on CT source and CT concentration (P<0.001). The highest increase was observed with CT from C. calothyrsus and the lowest with CT from L. leucocephala. HCl/pepsin degradability of rumen escape CP was also reduced with CT addition by 10 and 82% depending on CT concentration and source (P<0.001). In ruminal fluid, CT from L. leucocephala seemed to have less effect on degradation of soybean meal than CT from F. macrophylla and C. calothyrsus. In contrast, when HCl/pepsin was added to soybean meal, the complexes formed between CP and CT from L. leucocephala were more resistant to degradation than those formed with the other CT. This suggests that CT from L. leucocephala were less effective in increasing degradable rumen escape CP than CT from either C. calothyrsus or F. macrophylla. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study was conducted at the Regional University Center located in Temozon, north of Yucatan (Mexico). The dietary preferences of 10 white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) subspecies yucatanensis were estimated in the selection of eleven plants growing in the state of Yucatan, using a cafeteria study type. The chemical composition and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of the diet and the different vegetal species were determined, as well as the nutritional balance of the deer (30.2±2.65 kg of BW) fed with those species. The deer selected mainly the arboreal ones (76.52%), with a smaller proportion of forbs (19.37%), herbaceous (5.81%) and a minimum of graminae (0.29%). The legumes Leucaena leucocephala and Brosimum alicastrum constituted 51.20% of the ration. The diet had a composition of 56.97% dry matter, 17.64% crude protein, 42.53% cell walls with an IVDMD of 56.90%. The results of multiple linear regression analyses showed that the arboreal species have a significant impact (P < 0.0006) in the food consumption, whereas the crude protein tended (P < 0.096) to modify it. The analysis of variance showed that dry matter percentage influences the intake (P < 0.0085) in a quadratic form. Although the crude protein did not have an important effect in this analysis (P > 0.1), it presented a significant correlation (r = 0.23; P < 0.05), and none of the other nutrients or digestibility had a significant effect on feed intake. When the vegetal species were evaluated within the same analysis, the arboreal ones showed a significant positive linear effect (P < 0.0012) whereas the herbaceous tended (P < 0.11) to reduce the intake quadratically. It was estimated that the ration meets the maintenance requirements of nitrogen and energy in excess, allowing a maximum of 30% increase in energy for activity over the basal metabolism a reason why the vegetation in Regional University Center can be considered nutritionally excellent due to its protein content and digestibility for the white tailed deer.

AB  - The huge volume of sludge emanating from the tannery effluent treatment plants poses a serious environmental problem. Phytoremediation is an emerging technology in which the plants are employed to reclamate the contaminated soil strewn with heavy metals (metalloids) and toxic compounds. This work focuses the impact of application of tannery sludge on biochemical properties of 6 months old tree saplings of Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (Neem), Melia azedarach Linn. (Wild Neem) and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit (Subabool) raised over the tannery sludge in an attempt to use these plants for phytoremediation. The plants raised over the garden soil served as the control. The porosity and water holding capacity of the tannery sludge were higher. The plant growth supporting elements such as Ca, total N2, NO3 and Mg were higher in the sludge. The plants raised over the sludge were found to be dark green with increased morphometric parameters. Electrophoretic profile revealed amplification of a few polypeptides (100, 105, 49 and 55 KDa). The levels of biomolecules and the CO2 absorption increased in 6 months old plants. There was a significant uptake and transport of chromium in all the three tree species suggesting that these plants could be employed in phytoremediation of soils contaminated with heavy metals. © 2009 Prof. H.S.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC), readily oxidation organic carbon (ROC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents and their allocation ratios were comparatively investigated under Leucaena leucocephala woodland, Acacia auriculiformis woodland, dry cropland and wasteland in dry-hot valley. Results showed that SOC contents were not significant differences among the four land uses with the range of 4.22-5.19 g·kg-1. ROC contents under L. leucocephala (2.14 g·kg-1) and A. auriculiformis woodland (2.03 g·kg-1) were both significantly higher than those under dry cropland (1.38 g·kg-1) and wasteland (1.34 g·kg-1). The highest MBC and DOC contents both presented under dry cropland among the four land uses, whereas the lowest occurred under wasteland. ROC allocation ratios under woodlands were 1.3 to 1.6 times to those under dry cropland and wasteland. MBC and DOC allocation ratios under cropland were higher than those under other three land uses, and the ratios were closely among woodlands and wasteland. Plant residue amounts and management were primarily determined ROC contents, and soil water content and plant residue quantity were mainly affected the variation of MBC and DOC contents under the four land uses. The change of ROC contents could sensitively indicate SOC dynamics in dry-hot valley, but the change of MBC or DOC could not.

AB  - The biomass production and the nutritive value of three tropical shrub legumes with condensed tannins (CT) (Calliandra calothyrsus, Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala) and two without CT (Cratylia argentea, Desmodium velutinum) as nitrogen-rich feed supplements for ruminants were assessed in two field experiments in Colombia. In one experiment, conducted on two different typical tropical soils (mollisol vs. oxisol; pH, 7·8 vs. 5·0; P content, 43 vs. 2 mg kg DM-1), the effects of low and high levels of fertilizer application with P, K, Ca, Mg and S were tested in both the dry and rainy seasons. In a second experiment on the oxisol, the effect of a lower level of application of either P or S fertilizer was assessed. On the oxisol, C. calothyrsus and F. macrophylla had the highest biomass production (93 and 100 g DM plant-1 in 9 weeks respectively) but the dry season caused extremely low DM yields in all species tested. Leucaena leucocephala did not grow on the oxisol but had the highest biomass production on the mollisol (454 g DM plant-1 in 9 weeks). On the oxisol, the mineral concentrations of the forage were below the requirements of ruminant livestock. Fertilizer treatment had no clear effects on the nutrient composition of the forage. The non-CT shrub C. argentea had the highest concentrations of most minerals in its forage. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Effect of modification of tree density and geometry on intercrop yields and economic returns in Leucaena-based agro-forestry systems for wood production in Andhra Pradesh, Southern India
PY  - 2010
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77949774799&doi=10.1017%2fS0014479709990858&partnerID=40&md5=501535ce4cec7da915132761687072a2
AB  - Leucaena leucocephala is cultivated at close spacings that do not permit intercropping. This has been a discouraging factor for small landholders who need regular income to establish leucaena plantations and benefit from the rapidly expanding market for wood. Therefore, on-farm experiments were conducted near Bhadrachalam, Khammam district, Andhra Pradesh, India, from August 2001 to January 2006, to study the effect of reducing tree density and modifying tree geometry on the growth of leucaena and productivity of intercrops. The inter-row spacing of 1.3 m in farmers' practice was increased up to 13 m to examine whether wide-row planting and grouping of certain rows would facilitate extended intercropping without sacrificing wood yield. Tree density treatments tried were 1.3 × 1.3 m, 3 × 0.75 m, 3 × 1 m, 5 × 0.8 m and 3 × 2 m which gives densities of 5919, 4444, 3333, 2500 and 1666 trees ha1, respectively. Tree geometry treatments tested were 7 × 1 m paired row spacing (7 × 1 PR), 10 × 1 m triple row spacing (10 × 1 TR), and 13 × 1 m four rows (13 × 1 FR) with a constant tree population of 2500 trees ha1. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) was the intercrop. While changes in tree density affected diameter at breast height (DBH) significantly, modification of tree geometry did not affect tree height and DBH. Marketable wood and dry biomass productivity was highest with 3 × 0.75 m spacing, and reducing tree density and alteration of tree geometry reduced the biomass considerably. In 2001, 2002 and 2003 seasons, respectively, tree spacing at 3 m produced mean yields of 97, 23 and 11% of the sole crop cowpea yield whereas modified tree geometry treatments produced mean yields of 97, 61 and 20% of sole crop yield. The widest spacing (13 × 1 FR) recorded 95, 73 and 30% of the sole crop yields during 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Net returns from intercropping of leucaena in 3 × 0.75 m spacing was 36% higher than that of the farmers' practice. Although wider tree geometry treatments recorded lower net returns, they provided higher intercrop yields and returns in the first two years of plantation establishment. Therefore, it can be concluded that in regions where annual rainfall is around 1000 mm, leucaena can be planted at a spacing of 3 × 0.75 m for improving intercrop performance, higher tree productivity and returns. © Cambridge University Press 2010.

TI  - Sediment, nutrient and water losses by water erosion under agroforestry systems in the semi-arid region in northeastern Brazil
PY  - 2010

AB  - Inadequate soil management practices adopted in the Brazilian semi-arid region contribute to erosive processes. Agroforestry systems (AFs) have been considered an alternative to reduce water erosion. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of two alternatives AFs, a traditional and an intensive cropping system on the losses of sediments, water, organic carbon and nutrients caused by water erosion in comparison to the natural vegetation (caatinga) in a semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil. The agroecosystems studied were: agrosilvopasture (AGP) which consisted of an alley cropping system, cultivated with Leucaena leucocephala and maize, within an area composed by 22% of native trees (200 native trees per hectare) which was grazed during the dry season; silvopasture (SILV) that was composed by 38% of native trees (260 trees per hectare) with a stocking rate of 20 ewes during whole year; traditional agrosilvopasture (TRAG) being managed as following: total deforestation, burning of the residues, cropped with maize for 2 years (1998 and 1999) and fallow during 8-10 years; and intensive cropping (IC) system which was deforested and burned in 1997 followed by cultivation of maize from 1998 to 2002, and thereafter by a fallow period of 8-10 years similar to TRAG. Two areas of native forest (NF1, NF2) known as 'caatinga', used as grassland during the dry season and as a source of wood, were selected and used as reference of steady state in the comparative study in relation to the cultivated sites. Sediment and water losses as a result of erosion were collected during two rainy seasons, i.e. 2003 and 2004, and nutrients and organic carbon contents were determined. Soil samples were collected and organic carbon, pH in water, pH in KCl, water dispersible clay (WDC) and hydraulic conductivity (K0) were measured. In 2003, sediment and water losses did not differ significantly among all treatments. However, in 2004, TRAG (0.70 Mg ha-1) and NF1 (1.37 Mg ha-1) showed the highest sediment losses, whereas TRAG and IC presented the highest water losses. On average, nutrients losses in cropped areas were lower than in natural vegetation (NF1, NF2). The alternative AFs (AGP, SILV) were efficient to reduce water erosion effects when compared to the most common agricultural practices adopted in the region, being highly recommended as sustainable technical alternatives for food production in the region. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Alley cropping systems may be a solution for land use in tropical regions. How land use is connected to mycorrhizal arbuscular fungi (AMF) is poorly understood, especially in the tropics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of leguminous trees in an alley cropping system in regard to the infectivity and diversity of native AMF species in São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil. Soil samples were collected in an experimental area of the Universidade Estadual do Maranhão (UEMA) - São Luís, in two seasons (July/2006 and April/2007), two distances (0 m and 0.5 m) from the trunk of three leguminous trees (Leucaena leucocephala, Clitoria fairchildiana e Acacia mangium), and in a control area 0-20 cm deep. Soil samples were used to evaluate the infectivity of AMF, density and diversity of glomerospores. The alley cropping systems increased the infectivity of AMF which varied according to the leguminous tree species, raining season and distance from trees. Sixteen AMF species of five genera were identified in the area, and Scutellospora was the most representative genus.

The plants were grown in the greenhouse with the soil collected from agricultural fields which had been enriched with sediment from Lake Jose Antonio Alzate in the upper part of the Rio Lerma, in the state of Mexico. The soil samples were collected at random from different sites in the agricultural fields near the lake and were analyzed for Cu +2. The soils contained copper originating from the industrial, municipal and agricultural residues. These sediments have been incorporated in the agricultural fields by the farmers to take advantage of their organic matter and nutrients such as phosphates and nitrates. The soil samples were collected in each site at three (3) depths and the copper content was analyzed by sequential extraction methodologies for metal speciation. Before filling the experimental pots with the soil, three (3) application levels of copper (0, 20, and 200 mg Cu +2.kg -1 soil) were added in the form of CuS04.5H20 to each sub-sample. The 12 factorial treatments were arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replicates. The measurements of Cu +2 bioaccumulation in the leaves and stems were taken after (30, 60, 90, and 180 days). The index of Cu +2 bioaccumulation in leaves and stems were calculated from each of the first five speciation fractions. The fraction 6 was excluded from the calculations because copper was not available to the plant. The values of the fraction 5 were the most important since they were intimately related to high organic matter. It is concluded that the plant is a good bioaccumulator of Cu +2. However, it seems to have accumulated a higher percentage of the native Cu +2 than of the applied Cu +2. It was also observed that the Cu +2 applied as inorganic salt was not the best option for this study, since the literature and the experience during this project seemed to indicate that Cu +2 complexes with ligands that contain bases of the Lewis protein nitrogen type would provide better results. The results of this study will be a great help in the design of strategies that use the Leucaena leucocephala plants for bioremediation of Cu +" metal toxicity in soils.

AB  - When invasive species establish in new environments, they may disrupt existing or create new interactions with resident species. Understanding of the functioning of invaded ecosystems will benefit from careful investigation of resulting species-level interactions. We manipulated ant visitation to compare how invasive ant mutualisms affect two common plants, one native and one invasive, on a sub-tropical Indian Ocean island. Technomyrmex albipes, an introduced species, was the most common and abundant ant visitor to the plants. T. albipes were attracted to extrafloral nectaries on the invasive tree (Leucaena leucocephala) and deterred the plant's primary herbivore, the Leucaena psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana). Ant exclusion from L. leucocephala resulted in decreased plant growth and seed production by 22% and 35%, respectively. In contrast, on the native shrub (Scaevola taccada), T. albipes frequently tended sap-sucking hemipterans, and ant exclusion resulted in 30% and 23% increases in growth and fruit production, respectively. Stable isotope analysis confirmed the more predacious and herbivorous diets of T. albipes on the invasive and native plants, respectively. Thus the ants' interactions protect the invasive plant from its main herbivore while also exacerbating the effects of herbivores on the native plant. Ultimately, the negative effects on the native plant and positive effects on the invasive plant may work in concert to facilitate invasion by the invasive plant. Our findings underscore the importance of investigating facilitative interactions in a community context and the multiple and diverse interactions shaping novel ecosystems. © 2010 The Author(s).

AB  - This study examined the influence of organic residue quality and N fertilizer on aggregate-associated soil organic matter (SOM) in maize (Zea mays L.) cropping systems of southern Ghana. Six residue treatments of differing quality [Crotalaria juncea L, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, maize stover, sawdust, cattle manure, and a control with no residues added] were applied at 4 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 both with and without fertilizer N additions (120 kg N ha -1 season -1). Soils (0-15 cm) were sampled 3 yr after study implementation and wet sieved into four aggregate size classes (8000-2000, 2000-250, 250-53, and <53 μrn). Small macroaggregates (2000-250 μrn) were further separated into coarse paniculate organic matter (>250 μm), microaggregates within macroaggregates (53-250 μrn), and macroaggregate-occluded silt and clay (<53 μrn). Nitrogen fertilizer additions reduced aggregate stability, as was evident from a 40% increase in the weight of the silt and clay fraction (P = 0.014) as well as a decrease in microaggregates across all residue types (P = 0.019). Fertilizer similarly affected C and N storage within these aggregate fractions, while the effects of residue quality were largely insignificant. Our results suggest that fertilizer effects on soil aggregation may have important implications for long-term SOM dynamics. © Soil Science Society of America.

TI  - Gut microbiology - Broad genetic diversity, yet specific metabolic niches
PY  - 2008
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-42149110227&doi=10.1017%2fS1751731108001687&partnerID=40&md5=2f9a212b1fc3109f2c3cbe91339b4418
AB  - Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-encoding gene sequences from gut microbial ecosystems reveals bewildering genetic diversity. Some metabolic functions, such as glucose utilisation, are fairly widespread throughout the genetic spectrum. Others, however, are not. Despite so many phylotypes being present, single species or perhaps only two or three species often carry out key functions. Among ruminal bacteria, only three species can break down highly structured cellulose, despite the prevalence and importance of cellulose in ruminant diets, and one of those species, Fibrobacter succinogenes, is distantly related to the most abundant ruminal species. Fatty acid biohydrogenation in the rumen, particularly the final step of biohydrogenation of C18 fatty acids, stearate formation, is achieved only by a small sub-group of bacteria related to Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. Individuals who lack Oxalobacter formigenes fail to metabolise oxalate and suffer kidney stones composed of calcium oxalate. Perhaps the most celebrated example of the difference a single species can make is the 'mimosine story' in ruminants. Mimosine is a toxic amino acid found in the leguminous plant, Leucaena leucocephala. Mimosine can cause thyroid problems by being converted to the goitrogen, 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone, in the rumen. Observations that mimosine-containing plants were toxic to ruminants in some countries but not others led to the discovery of Synergistes jonesii, which metabolises 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone and protects animals from toxicity. Thus, despite the complexities indicated by molecular microbial ecology and genomics, it should never be forgotten that gut communities contain important metabolic niches inhabited by species with highly specific metabolic capability. © 2008 The Animal Consortium.

TI  - Bromatological characteristics of Guinea grass (Panicum maximum cv. Likoni) in a silvopastoral system with leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru)

UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70450252159&partnerID=40&md5=da52fc2e17cedd381e02abe78aa6664e
AB  - The bromatological performance of the herbaceous stratum (80 % of Guinea grass) in areas of a silvopastoral system Leucaena leucocephala/ Panicum maximum, sown in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, was studied during the period between 2000 and 2002. The design was complete random. The indicators were: percentage of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), crude fiber (CF), ashes, and digestibility of the organic matter. The results showed decline (P < 0.001) for the DM percentage, with higher time of exploitation of the silvopastoral area. There was stability in the seasons, in both climatic periods, during the sowing in 1995. The protein content in Guinea grass increased significantly with the highest values (12.2, 11.35, 10.68, and 7.56 %) during the rainy season of 2002, for the sowings in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively. However, in the area with lower time of exploitation (1998), the DM percentage did not show differences compared with the sampling during the dry season in 2002. There was decline (P < 0.001) in the CF percentages between the rainy season in 2000 and in 2002, for the sowings in 1995 and 1996. This effect was not seen in the sowings in 1997 and 1998. The digestibility was higher (P < 0.05) with the evolution of the system in the sowing in 1995 (52.97 vs 54.80 %), when comparing the two samplings in the rainy season. In the rest of the sowing years, there were only seasonal differences. It is concluded that, with the evolution of the silvopastoral system, there is important stability in the bromatological characteristics of Guinea grass, which are reflected markedly up to 8th year of exploitation. The presence of leucaena in the system affected the chemical performance of Guinea grass by improving its quality in both climatic periods.

AB  - In order to know the preference of twelve fodder species (Chlorophora tinctoria, Morus alba, Pithecellobium pedicellare, Gliricidia sepium, Guazuma ulmifolia, Cordia alba, Trichantera gigantea, Tithonia diversifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa oleifera, Azadirachta indica and Samanea saman) a cafeteria trial was carried out in goats at Trujillo State, Venezuela. An experimental square latin design with evaluation period of twelve days was used. Measurements included forage intake for species which were chemically analyzed in terms of chemical composition (CP, NDF, ADF, lignin, cellulose, Calcium, Phosphorus, ash, secondary metabolites presences and total phenols, condensed tannins and tripsin inhibitors level). C. tinctoria (0.334 kg DM) showed the greatest preference, with significant differences (P<0.05) in relation to the others. M. alba (0.271 kg DM) and P. pedicellare (0.255 kg DM) followed by G. sepium (0.183 kg DM), G. ulmifolia (0.164 kg DM), C. alba (0.157 kg DM), T. gigantea (0.156 kg DM) and T. diversifolia (0.141 kg DM). L. leucocephala (0.079 kg DM) and M. oleifera (0.067 kg DM) showed low preference. The lowest intake was observed with A. indica (0.025 kg DM) and S. saman (0.022 kg DM). During the experimental period different intake tendencies were observed in the which could be associated to the chemical composition of forages, specifically the presence of secondary metabolites with possible dissuasive properties. The results emphasize the importance of studies of animal preference in the initial characterization of trees and shrubs with fodder potential. © 2009 Universidad del Zulia.

TI  - The impact of season, time of defoliation and dehydration on the concentration of mimosine in Leucaena leucocephala forage
PY  - 2009
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-61849104587&doi=10.2989%2fAJRFS.2009.26.1.7.702&partnerID=40&md5=3996fdb630a2d54127b56670515dbfba
AB  - This study evaluated the variation of the concentration of mimosine in Leucaena forage with season, the time of defoliation and dehydration. Fresh samples were collected randomly from Leucaena regrowth and sorted into four types of samples (primordial tips, young leaves, mature leaves and edible twigs). The samples were divided into two portions and handled as fresh or air-dried. Mimosine was extracted from the fresh and air-dried samples with dilute hydrochloric acid. Chemical analysis was done by indirect spectrophotometric methods. A General Linear Model procedure was used to determine the impact of the variables on the concentration of mimosine. The results showed that air-dried samples in both seasons contained significantly (P < 0.05) more mimosine than the corresponding fresh samples by an average of 34%. Fresh autumn samples collected at 12:00 contained more mimosine (15.43%) than samples collected at 15:00 (9.09%) and 9:00 (4.48%) in comparison with corresponding summer samples. Similarly, air-dried autumn samples collected at 12:00 contained more mimosine (47.15%) than samples collected at 9:00 (43.57%) and 15:00 (40.12%) in comparison with the corresponding summer samples. Dehydration of samples elevated the concentration of mimosine by 39.09%, 31.72% and 31.03% for samples collected at 9:00, 12:00 and 15:00, respectively. It was concluded that dehydration of samples had the most significant impact on the concentration of mimosine followed by the time of defoliation and the season.

AB  - The effect of feeding diets including market crop wastes (sweet potato vines (Ipomoea batatas) and scarlet eggplant (Solanum aethiopicum)) on growth and digestibility was studied using 32 indigenous intact growing male goats. Adding elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum), maize bran and Leucaena leucocephala leaves, four isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets (Sweet potato vines, Solanum, Mixed and Control) were formulated. After the growth trial, 12 goats were randomly selected for a digestibility trial with the same diets, and 8 goats for a feed preference test comparing the market wastes and elephant grass. Crude protein (CP) intake was highest (P∈<∈0.05) for the Control (48 g/day) and lowest for the Sweet potato vines diet (23 g/day). Average daily gain was between 11.0 and 14.2 g/day, and similar between diets. The DM and CP digestibilities of the diets were 0.56 and 0.56 (Control), 0.62 and 0.56 (Mixed), 0.59 and 0.49 (Sweet potato vines), and 0.54 and 0.45 (Solanum), respectively. Faecal and urinary N excretions were highest in goats fed the Sweet potato vines and Solanum diets. Eggplant wastes were the least (P∈<∈0.05) preferred. On average the goats spent 5% of their 8-hour time eating eggplant wastes, 34% on sweet potato vines and 36% on elephant grass. Growth performance and N retention were low due to the low intake of feed, especially eggplant wastes. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - In vitro ruminal fermentation of tanniniferous tropical plants: Plant-specific tannin effects and counteracting efficiency of PEG
PY  - 2008
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-52349083934&doi=10.1016%2fj.anifeedsci.2007.12.009&partnerID=40&md5=2f4988466165411d29f12e12d96c8427
AB  - Two experiments with the gas pressure transducer technique were conducted to investigate the effects of different types and levels of tannins. Forage samples were incubated in batch cultures together with rumen fluid and digestion medium in order to model rumen fermentation dynamics in vitro. In Experiment 1, graded levels (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/g of forage dry matter (DM)) of purified condensed tannins (CT) obtained from four tanniniferous tropical shrub legumes, Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala and two provenances of Calliandra calothyrsus (San Ramón and Patulul), were added to a CT-free mixture of the grass Brachiaria humidicola and the herbaceous legume Vigna unguiculata. The statistical models used for data evaluation included the two main effects (origin and level of CT) and their interaction. Apart from dose-dependent effects (P<0.001) there were clear plant-specific effects (mostly P<0.001) in fermentation dynamics, in vitro DM degradation and apparent degradation of N-containing compounds. Tannins from C. calothyrsus had the most pronounced effects on fermentation dynamics and nutrient degradation, followed by F. macrophylla and L. leucocephala. Within C. calothyrsus, CT from the provenance San Ramón suppressed asymptotic gas production and DM degradation to a larger extent (P<0.05) than CT from the provenance Patulul. Low addition (25 mg/g DM) of CT from C. calothyrsus was only slightly detrimental while high CT levels (75 and 100 mg/g DM) had clearly negative effects on asymptotic gas production and DM degradation. In a first incubation in Experiment 2, the grass in mixtures with foliage of the different tanniniferous shrub legumes was incubated with graded levels of polyethylene glycol (PEG) corresponding to 0/3, 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3 of the contents of CT in these mixtures. In a second incubation, all mixtures based on tanniniferous shrub legumes and mixtures containing non-tanniniferous shrub legumes (Cratylia argentea, Desmodium velutinum) or a herbaceous legume (V. unguiculata) were tested without PEG and with 80 g/kg supplementary PEG. In general, addition of PEG had no effect (P>0.05) on fermentation parameters in non-tanniniferous legumes. With tanniniferous species, response curves in fermentation parameters were mostly non-linear reaching a plateau at a PEG:CT-ratio between 1:3 and 2:3. One exception was that undegraded dietary N decreased (P<0.05) with increasing PEG addition until the highest level. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that to a large extent the effects of CT-rich plants on in vitro ruminal fermentation can be explained by the specific CT properties. Furthermore, apart from binding CT, PEG seems to have no major side-effects on ruminal fermentation, and for most fermentation variables and species, PEG supplementation equivalent to the CT content in the forage mixtures seems sufficient to prevent negative effects of CT on fermentation parameters. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The phenomenon of invasive alien species has become one of the greatest threats to the biological diversity of the planet, placing major constraints on development. In order to provide the tools needed to address this pervasive issue, the current knowledge on invasive species must be further developed with a cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary approach. Recent theories of invasion propose that exotic plants probably produce secondary metabolites which can be allelopathic, anti-herbivore, anti-microbial and which are either unique or underrepresented in the plants' new range. This review attempts to attract the attention of phytochemists to study either the mechanisms of plant invasion or to use this widespread plant resource for humans.

TI  - Some thoughts on superhydrophobic wetting
PY  - 2009
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57849126752&doi=10.1039%2fb811945g&partnerID=40&md5=a7663908f4cd06e26e0b96b08b9ae97e
AB  - Surface roughness has a profound influence on the wetting properties of a material. This fact is especially true with respect to the wetting of superhydrophobic surfaces. As a result of a special surface structure, a drop of water brought into contact with such a material forms an almost perfect sphere and even a very slight tilting of the superhydrophobic object is sufficient to cause the drop to roll off. For the description of the behavior of drops on rough surfaces two theories, namely those of Cassie and Wenzel, are often employed. However, it is currently becoming well established that both models explain the wetting behavior more from a qualitative or practical point of view rather than giving a quantitative description. For a prediction of actual contact angles, a more complex description is required that, next to thermodynamics, takes into account the kinetics of wetting. In this article, we focus on a few key aspects of superhydrophobic wetting, namely the characterization of superhydrophobic surfaces, models for the movement of drops, transitions between the Cassie and Wenzel states, and the behavior of superhydrophobic materials under condensation. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In the current experiment, Leucaena leucocephala seeds were subjected to three treatments (soaking, roasting and supplementation with 40mg/Kg ferrous oxide). Then treated and untreated leucaena seeds were incorporated in boiler diets at 0, 6 and 12%. Soaking and roasting of the seeds reduced phytate, whereas tannin was not significantly affected. Feed intake and weight gain were significantly (p≤0.05) reduced with the inclusion of 12% untreated leucaena seed, 12% soaked or 12% roasted leucaena seeds. However, feeding diets that supplemented with ferrous had no negative effect on feed intake and weight gain compared with control. Dietary treatments did not affect haematological parameters, plasma GOT ALP, K, inorganic phosphorus (Pi), total protein, albumin, globulin, cholesterol, uric acid and tibia P. Plasma glucose for birds fed leucaena seed diets was not significantly different as compared with those fed the control diet. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2008.

AB  - By using a multivariate analysis and hierarchical index determination the fodder potential of twelve species (Chlorophora tinctoria, Morus alba, Pithecellobium pedicellare, Gliricidia sepium, Guazuma ulmifolia, Cordia alba, Trichantera gigantea, Tithonia diversifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa oleifera, Azadirachta indica and Samanea saman) in dry tropical forest area, Trujillo state, Venezuela were studied. The behavior of woody species in nursery conditions, establishment and relative acceptability by ovine, goats and cattle was evaluated in experiment 1. However, edible biomass production, chemical composition, rumen degradability and relative acceptability in confinement condition were determined in experiment 2. A high variability for the first three components (97.71%) was detected. The transplant height, growth rate, the final survival in establishment, the biomass production, NDF total terpenoids content and cattle, sheep and goat acceptability in confinement and grazing conditions were the most relevant variables. Using the automatic classification analysis and fodder potential index M. alba, C. tinctoria, G. ulmifolia, P. pedicellare, L. leucocephala and C. alba showed better results. The rest of species showed little relevance as fodder.

TI  - A two-phase process for revegetation of acidic bauxite tailings in the Amazon Region, Brazil

AB  - This paper presents the methodology developed by the association of Mineração Rio do Norte S.A. with Embrapa/Agrobiologia and the Soil Department of Federal University of Viçosa to promote revegetation of tailings ponds from bauxite mining in Porto Trombetas, Para State, Brazil. The tailings have a fine texture (77% clay), are low in nutrients, have low pH (4.5) and high P-fixation capacity. This technology is based upon a two-phase process. In the first phase, seeds of leguminous trees and shrubs, inoculated with N-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizae (VAM fungi), are hydroseeded over the tailings with fertilizer. This initial phase accelerates the tailings drying and incorporates carbon and nutrients into the tailings surface. In the second phase, after substrate consolidation, native secondary and pioneer species are planted with the objective of ensuring more biological diversity and sustainability in the system. Among the evaluated species, Sesbania virgata, S. exasperata, Cecrópia sp., Parkia discolor, Styphnodendron guinensi, Leucaena leucocephala, Hidrocoria corumbosa and Chamaecrista flexuosa have been used with success in the first phase, and Sclerolobium paniculatum, Clitoria farchildian, Eugenia sp., Tapirira guyanensis, Dalbergia spruceana and Enterolobium maximum have been successful in the second phase. Four years after revegetation of the first tailings pond, monitoring results indicate a significant increase of biological activity in the substrate and the presence of different species from natural invasion and regeneration, indicating that primary successional processes are active. These results indicate that the two-phase revegetation process may be more appropriate for the tailings ponds in Porto Trombetas than conventional reclamation practices.

AB  - The raising of buffaloes has been having a satisfactory development from its introduction in the country, since a relatively a short period of time, and there is the need to improve the conditions of handling and operation. For this reason, it was investigated the effect of the arborisation in the raising of river buffaloes, for which in two units were selected with 30 milk buffaloes each one and their young to compare the effect of the arborization using the technology of rational tree grazing with Leucaena leucocephala compared to a monoculture of grasses without arborization. To compare, an initial diagnostic was done to know the characteristics of each unit and determining both the soil chemical and floristic composition of the areas and monthly determined the availability of dry matter of the grass to regulate the animal rate in the pasture. We proceed this way for the next 4 years in the determination of the productive milk indicators by buffalo, lactancy and area, the reproductive behaviour, and the economic income. The results obtained in the arborizated system were superior in 0.72 kg milk/anim/d, 279.8 kg/ lactancy, 1.49 kg/ha/d and 42 days of lactancy, being reflected more positively in the income by the milk sale by buffalo, hectare, and lactancy in the national currency and convertible Cuban money. All the analyzed indicators favoured the tree production system with Leucaena, with the technology of rational tree grazing. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

PY  - 2008

AB  - To determine the appropriate way to control the lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de. Wit), an invasive plant in Taiwan, 3 concentrations with an equal amount of glyphosate (18.8 mmole) were applied in spring and summer, respectively, and glyphosate residues in the plants and soils were monitored. A good control effect was observed with injecting a commercial product of glyphosate without dilution, especially in spring. Measurements of glyphosate residues in the upper (25 cm above the upper injection hole), middle (between the 2 injection holes), and lower (25 cm below the lower injection hole) parts of the lead tree, as well as in forest soils in spring and summer experiments showed that this herbicide began to sharply dissipate after treatment, which was accelerated by high temperatures and heavy rainfall from typhoons. In the spring experiment, it required ca. 1 yr for glyphosate residues in both the lead trees and soils to drop to a few parts per million, while this period was further shortened in the summer experiment. Thus, there is only a small possibility of glyphosate pollution of the soil environment of lead tree forests. Analysis of glyphosate in xylem and phloem from different parts of the plants revealed that after injection, glyphosate gradually diffused acropetally, basipetally, and laterally from the xylem tissue to the surrounding phloem tissue. Glyphosate appeared to preferentially diffuse to and accumulate in phloem near the injection hole for further long-distance translocation in phloem tissue.

AB  - In order to identify faster-growing non-woody species usable for biomass and paper production, four Leucaena species (L. diversifolia, L. colinsii, L. salvadorensis and three varieties of L. leucocephala) were tested. All the Leucaena species showed a good soil and climatic adaptation to Spain Southwest except for L. salvadorensis. Studied Leucaena species showed biomass productivity ranges from 67.14 to 9.44 t ha-1 (o.d.b.) and 43.6 to 11.4 t ha-1 under Mediterranean conditions for the first and second year sprouts, respectively. The quantity of solubles and extractives shows similar values when compared with wood materials. Relatively lower lignin content in Leucaena (from 15.7% to 21.4%) species has been found with respect to other vegetal species. The α-cellulose contents (39.4-45.3%) are in the range of the normal values expected for the other non-wood raw materials. The study confirms the feasibility of organocell yield pulping process to Leucaena species. Organocell process provides an efficient delignification (kappa number 12.4 and pulp yield 42.2%) for L. leucocephala and suitably physical characteristics of paper sheet (tensile index 20.3 kNm/kg for L. diversifolia). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transpiration of twenty-nine potted afforestation species for vegetation restoration in the dry-hot valleys of the Jinsha River was studied under different drought stress weight on typical sunny day. Five main conclusions were gotten as follows: (1) The transpiring water consumption of different seedlings in the day time presented a sustained descent with the drought stress, the descending extent of different seedlings was obviously different. The seedlings, with the strong water consumption, were more easy and quick to suffer from drought stress. (2) After six-day's drought treatment, the practical water consumption of Acacia mearnsii, Leucaena leucocephala cv. Salvador, Carallia longipes, Eucalyptus globulus descended the most, being 85.78%-93.11%; Schleichera oleosa, Bombax malabaricum, Tephrosia candida, Albizia kalkora, Pinus yunnanensis descended the least, being only 6.37%-17.42%. The classified result by the descended extent of water consumption was identical to the comparison result of slope k. (3) The transpiring water consumption of seedlings in the first day determined the dynamic variation of water losing. With the sustaining of drought stress, the proportion of water consumption in the night to water consumption in the whole day gradually increased. (4) When the seedlings suffered serious drought stress in March, the descending proportion order of transpiring from water consumption of twenty-five species was identical to the size order while suffering from middle-class drought stress. (5) According to the quantitative formula between transpiring water consumption rate of seedlings in the day time, systematically classified method could be used to divide twenty-nine tree species into four classifications including high transpiring water consumption, sub-high transpiring water consumption, sub-low transpiring water consumption and low transpiring water consumption.

AB  - The inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala, Trichanchera gigantea and Morus alba foliage in pelleted rabbits diets in proportions of 10, 20 and 30% was studied. Eighty New Zealand × California rabbits (1124.1 ± 289.7 g of live weight) were individually allocated in 10 treatments according with a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement 3 × 3, the factors were the forages and the inclusion levels. Additionally, a control diet was formulated that didn't contain test foliage, which was compared with the dietary treatments. The average daily gain was higher (P<0.01) in the animals that received diets with L. leucocephala (29.49) and M. alba (26.00) foliage, with regard to T. gigantea (21.85 g/rabbit). Similarly the feed conversion and the relationship benefit feeding cost was higher (P<0.01) in the animals that received L. leucocephala and M. alba with regard to T. gigantea (4.75, 5.34 and 6.30, and 3.28, 2.82 and 2.63 Bs, respectively). The inclusion level and the interaction didn't affect (P>0.05) the studied variables. The rabbits that received the control diet showed 4.21 in feed conversion and 2.76 Bs in the relationship benefit feeding cost, and there were similar (P>0.05) with regard to other treatments; although the average daily gain (31.78 g/rabbit) was higher with the control diet. These results allow to suggest the incorporation until 30% of this forages in fattening rabbits diets.

AB  - In the irrigation District 018, Tulancingo, Hidalgo, Mexico forage for cattle is irrigated with residual water. To evaluate the level of contamination of two plots, one hectare was irrigated with residual water and the other with clean water. Later a greenhouse experiment with Leucaena leucocephala (guaje) to observe its growth with inoculation of Glomus intraradices with different amounts of vermicompost was esatblished. A factorial experiment 7×2 completely randomized design with five replications in the greenhouse was used. The variables measured were plant height, stem diameter, root volume dry weight of biomass, dry weight of roots. The experiment lasted 180 days from planting until harvesting. It is concluded that the inoculation with Glomus intraradices increased the efficiency of Leucaena leucocephala in nutrient adsorption. In soil the contamination of Cu, Cr and Ni are below the established limits for contaminants. Pb was not found. A comparison of soil irrigated with clean water or sewage water indicated that Cu is nearly twice as concentrated in soil irrigated by contaminated water; Ni is slightly greater; Cr is more abundant in soil irrigated with clean water.

AB  - The anthelmintic (AH) effect of Acacia pennatula, Leucaena leucocephala, Lisyloma latisiliquum and Piscidia piscipula was evaluated in the infective larvae (L3) of Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Different concentrations of lyophilized extracts were tested using the larval migration inhibition (LMI) test. An inhibitor of tannins (the polyvinyl polypyrrolidone [PVPP]) was used to verify whether these compounds were responsible for the AH effects. Then, the effect of extracts on larval exsheathment was examined by observing the exsheathment process at 10-min intervals for 70 min. The LMI test showed a dose-dependant AH effect for A. pennatula, L. leucocephala and L. latisiliquum (P < 0.01), but not for P. piscipula. The restoration of L3 migration to values similar to those of controls after the addition of PVPP, indicates that tannins are involved in AH effects. Trichostrongylus colubriformis exsheathment was partially or totally blocked by the four plants extracts. Tropical tanniniferous plants evaluated in the current study may have potential as AH for the control of T. colubriformis if in vivo investigations indicate useful effects. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In a complete random design, 12 commercial Zebu bulls were used with 291.00 ± 4.00 kg of liveweight (LW) to analyze their productive response with the supply of an activator of the rumen fermentation in a silvopastoral system of leucaena and natural pasture. The animals were divided into two groups: one consumed 1.50 kg/animal/d of supplement activating the rumen fermentation and the control group, 50 g of mineral salt/animal/d. Both grazed in 6 ha of association in 100 % of the leucaena area (Leucaena leucocephala), grasses (92 %) and weeds (8 %), divided in 8 paddocks, with stocking rate of 2 animals per ha and time of occupation and rest of 7 and 49 d, respectively. The average daily gain (ADG) of LW was of 0.739 and 0.776 kg, respectively, for the animals of the control group and for those that consumed the activator. There were not differences between treatments. The grazing pressure was of 9.50 kg of DM per each 100.00 kg of LW and the capacity of ingestion estimated, of 7.99 kg/animal/d. The requirements of protein were covered and ME was slightly under the needs. The ADG obtained in the system was favorable, but did not improve with the Utilizatión of this activator of the rumen fermentation. Other evaluations should be developed to validate the use of these activators in the fattening of bulls in silvopasture of leucaena with the increase of the energy level of the ration.

TI  - Methodology for the selection of sustainability indicators of the soil-plant system in grasslands
PY  - 2008
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70450175608&partnerID=40&md5=a978505a9b07325f74c6a9ef6db877c3
AB  - The study was conducted during three continuous years in areas of the Institute of Animal Science to determine a methodology for selecting the variables of the soil-plant system as indicators that allow monitoring the sustainability of grasslands in cattle production. The grasslands under study were: (i) silvopastoral system based on Panicum maximum and Leucaena leucocephala, (ii) monoculture of Panicum maximum, and (iii) association of grasses with a mixture of creeping legumes. The study began with the analysis of the peculiarities for each grassland, the selection of representative paddocks, and the decisions on the variables to be evaluated in each instance. Between 36 and 42 variables were determined in the plants, and 76, in the soil. The statistical evaluation was based on the multivariate analysis of principal components selecting as indicators those variables with preponderance values with±0.78 and comprised in the principal components whose explained variance accumulated, at least, 65 %. Between 7 and 9 indicators (pasture density, biomass availability, plant cover, and botanical composition) were selected in the plants, whereas there were between 9 and 11 in the soil (structure, resistance to penetration, n value, macrofauna, mesofauna, and underground phytomass). These indicators permitted to characterize the performance of the soil-plant system in each grassland. Tables with ranges of values indicating sustainability in the soil-plant system were obtained. They are practical tools to monitor the management effect on each grassland. It is concluded that it is possible to determine sustainability indicators, following this methodology, in different types of grasslands, which are characteristic of each type and permit to control efficiently the management effect. Further studies are recommended in other grassland types including the animal factor, as well as increasing the work time in the grasslands to validate the indicators selected.

TI  - Ethanol technical potential in Hawaii based on sugarcane, banagrass, Eucalyptus, and Leucaena
PY  - 2009

AB  - An assessment of ethanol production potential from dedicated energy crops was conducted for the State of Hawaii considering lands, crop species, and conversion technologies. Evaluation of the spatial distributions of soil types, zoning, and annual rainfall was conducted using geographic information system data. Saccharum officinarum (sugarcane), Pennisetum purpureum (banagrass), Leucaena leucocephala, and Eucalyptus grandis were selected as potential feedstocks for sugar-based and lignocellulosic ethanol production. The analysis shows that only one cropping scenario applied to all available agriculturally zoned lands in the state would be capable of producing enough ethanol to meet the state's current motor gasoline consumption on an energy equivalent basis. State goals of displacing 20% (volume) of highway fuels by 2020 could be met by 14 of the 16 cropping and land use combinations. This indicates that the State of Hawaii could promote energy diversification through its choice of land leases. Distribution of suitable lands among islands is not consistent with motor fuel demand, suggesting that provisions must be made to support development of adequate storage and harbor facilities to enable movement of fuel between points of production and use. Comparison of possible production volumes with economic plant sizes indicates that sufficient feedstocks could be available on Maui, Hawaii, Oahu, and Kauai to realize economies of scale in production facilities. This study should be refined in the future to adequately address issues of environmental preservation, water consumption, and land use to provide additional guidance for policy and economic decision making. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the search of analytical techniques to achieve reliable results in assessing animal feed raw materials and/or forages, in vitro gas production using bovine feces can be a selected procedure to predict digestibility, without any aggression to the animals. Applying such technique, samples of Chamaecrista lineada, Desmodium barbatum, Desmodium incanum, Dichrostachys cinerea, Leucaena leucocephala, and Stylosanthes viscosa were evaluated. The correlation between the influence of PEG4000 on gas production and the concentration of extractable polyphenols was evaluated. The addition of PEG significantly (P<0.01) improved in vitro gas production (mL/200 mg DM) of Ch. lineada (8.5 to 12.3), D. cirenea (17.3 to 27.1), and L. leucocephala (16.8 to 20.0). In the evaluated legumes, there was a positive correlation (r2 = 0.94) between the improvement in gas production because of PEG and the concentration of polyphenols. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - With the objective to evaluate the modulator effect of Leucaena leucocephala on the methanogenic bacteria and other microbial groups in the rumen was conducted a trial according to a completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement (4 × 4, four leucaena proportions and four times of fermentation), under in vitro conditions. The trial consisted of four star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) with leucaena ratios, which were: treatment A=100:0, B=80:20, C=75:25, and D=70:30. The sampling was performed before the incubation (0 hour), and at 4, 8, and 12 h of fermentation. The counts of methanogenic bacteria were 40.22, 38.42, 13.98, and 12.46 × 107 cfu/mL for the treatments A, B, C, and D, respectively. The modulator increased the population of cellulolytic bacteria, compared with the control without supplement, and the best response was found in the ratios 80:20 and 70:30. The populations of cellulolytic fungi were 2.08, 3.49, 3.69, and 4.48 × 103 tfu/mL for A, B, C, and D treatments, respectively. The protoozoa population varied from 1.50 to 2.75 × 105 cell/mL, under the trial conditions. In all cases with L. leucocephala as modulator the populations were significantly small, but the smallest was found when the ratio 80:20 of star grass:modulator was used. It is concluded that the modulator from the fermentation with L. leucocephala is suitable for reducing the population of rumen methanogenic bacteria without affecting the total population of cellulolytic bacteria. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate supplementation of Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) for ruminant and the effects of condensed tannin in rumen fermentation. Eight Santa Inês breed sheep (body weight = 35 ± 2.6 kg), were allocated to four diets mixed in a randomized block design. Animals were kept in individual pens for a seven-day feed adaptation followed by a seven-day intake trial where voluntary dry matter intake (VDMI) was estimated. The sheep were then moved into metabolic cages for a five-day digestibility trial to estimate apparent digestibility and nitrogen balance. The total experiment lasted 70 days divided into tree periods (blocks) of 21 days, leaving two days between periods for animal rest. Experimental diets were based on Tifton 85 hybrid Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon Pers. x Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst) and supplemented with 20 (L20), 40 (L40) and 60% (L60) of leucaena hay related to diet dry matter. Control diet was composed by tifton hay and supplemented with mix protein concentrate. Chemical composition and condensed tannins determination were performed on offered and refused feed and excretion samples. Data were subject to analysis of variance using general procedure of the statistical software package. Means were compared by Student't test (0.05) and linear and quadratic regressions were applied to evaluate the effect of leucaena level. Supplementation with L40 increased 29% VDMI (g/animal.day), while sheep fed L20 presented no difference (P < 0.05) to control and L60 diet. The average responses of apparent digestibility among leucaena diets were 384 (SE=10), 341 (SE=24), 288 (SE=53) and 365 (SE=24) g/Kg for total DM, CP, ADF and NDF, respectively, which were lower (P<0.05) than control diet (504, 630, 557, 459, respectively). It is supposed that the low digestibility found with supplementation was due to condensed tannin effect, high indigestible fibre contend and the additive action of both. Supplementation with L60 and L40 increased faecal nitrogen excretion (FN) and faecal acid detergent soluble nitrogen (P < 0.05). However, animals fed L20 reduced 64% urinary nitrogen (UN) loss related to control diet and presented similar FN than control (P > 0.05). L60 and control diet presented the highest N retention (P < 0.05). In general, the high level of leucaena supplementation (40 and 60%) should be exploited with higher digestible nutrients, in order to synchronize the "excess" protein in rumen and energy. It is concluded that phenolic compounds, especially condensed tannin, present in leguminous may influence positively digestive parameter; however its effect depends on other factor such as presence of lignin, available energy and also its chemical characteristic.

AB  - In this work, we characterized various unconventional pulping raw materials in terms of their contents in hollocelulose, α-cellulose, lignin, ethanol-benzene extractables, ash, and hot water and 1% soda solubles. Also, we characterized pulp obtained from each material by using an ethyleneglycol concentration of 65% at 180 °C for 75 min, followed by beating at 1500 revolutions in a PFI refiner-all of which are compatible with existing facilities for Kraft and soda pulping processes. We characterized vine shoots, cotton stalks, Leucaena leucocephala and Chamaecytisus proliferus as pulping raw materials and found Ch. proliferus and cotton stalks to be the best for the intended purpose on the grounds of their increased contents in holocellulose (79.73 and 72.86%) and α-cellulose (45.37 and 58.48%), and their decreased contents in ethanol-benzene extractables (2.64 and 1.42%), hot water solubles (2.79 and 3.33%) and 1% soda solubles (16.67 and 20.34%). These properties resulted in increased pulp yields and hence in efficient use of these two types of raw material. The paper sheets obtained of different pulps were characterized and those from Ch. proliferus found to be the best overall as they exhibited an increased breaking length (4644 m), stretch (2.87%), burst index (2.46 kN/g) tear index (0.33 mN m2/g) and brightness (49.92% ISO); in addition Ch. proliferus pulp was obtained with a high yield (62.88%). On the other hand, vine shoots provided the poorest results among the studied raw materials. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conditioned taste aversions are a useful tool to reduce livestock consumption of toxic plants. The forage legume Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is both toxic and palatable. The objective of this study was to determine if goats could be aversively conditioned to avoid leucaena. Adult and juvenile female goats, naïve to leucaena, were divided into control and averted groups. Animals were exposed to leucaena, and time(s) spent eating leucaena was measured. During initial conditioning with lithium chloride (LiCl), averted goats spent less time eating leucaena (P < 0.05) than did controls. The averted groups maintained their reduced consumption (P < 0.05) of leucaena compared to controls during open field tests when goats could chose between leucaena and sugar cane. In final tests (two tests per week), averted goats reduced (P < 0.05) the amount of time they spent eating leucaena compared to control animals, but the aversion eventually extinguished. Aversive conditioning was successful in greatly reducing, but not entirely eliminating goats' consumption of leucaena. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dietary combinations of Cryosopogon fulvus (CF) grass with 5 species each of tree leaves (Hardwickia binata-HB, Albizia lebbek-AL, Grewia optiva-GO, Anogeissus pendulla-AP and Leucaena leucocephala-LL) and shrubs (Dichrostachys cinerea-DC, Securengia virosa-SV, Zizyphus xylophyrus-ZX, Helictris isora-HI and Acacia catechu-AC) in 50:50 and 75:25 ratios were evaluated for in vitro nutrients degradation, gas production and metabolites production in sheep and goat inoculums. CF-LL CF-AL, CF-HI and CF-GO diets had (P<0.05) higher CP contents. CF-shrubs/tree leaves diets had higher (P<0.05) CP contents at 50:50 than 75:25, while fibre contents were lower in former than later ratio. CF-LL CF-GO and CF-AL diets revealed more gas production at 3, 6 and 12 h of fermentation both in sheep and goat, while CF-AC, CF-ZX and CF-DC diets revealed higher gas production at later hours (48 and 72h) of incubation in both species. CF-LL and CF-GO exhibited higher gas production at 50:50 and 75:25 ratios in sheep and goat against lowest with CF-DC in both species. CF-LL CF-SV and CF-GO diets had higher DM, CP, NDF and ADF degradability in sheep inoculum, while these nutrients were more degradable in goat inoculum from CF-LL, CF-SV and diets. Species exhibited higher degradability of DM at 50:50 ratio than at 75:25, CP and ADF degradability was comparable in sheep and goat at 50:50 and 75:25 ratios of CF-shrubs/tree leaves. CF-SV, CF-AL and CF-HI diets exhibited higher TVFA in sheep inoculum, while total-N and ammonia-N was more due to CF-GO and CF-HB. CF-SV, CF-ZX and CF-DC diets exhibited higher TVFA production in goat inoculum. Total-N and NH3-N production was higher due to incubation of CF-LL, CF-GO and CF-HB in goat inoculum. Higher total-N and NH3-N concentration was recorded on fermentation of CF-shrubs/tree leaves diets in sheep inoculum at 50:50 man 75:25,while goat revealed higher TVFA and total-N at 50:50 than 75:25 ratio. CF-LL CF-GO, CF-HI and CF-SV diets had higher gas production, nutrients degradability and metabolites concentration in inoculum of both species, while sheep and goat had more nutrients degradability and TVFA production at 75:25 and 50:50 ratios of CF-shrubs/tree leaves diets, respectively.

AB  - An efficient in vitro plant regeneration system in subabul (Leucaena leucocephala), a leguminous pulp wood tree species, was established. The induction of shoots was achieved from selected elite clones of subabul K-8, K-636 and also wild type on MS medium supplemented with 2 % sucrose and different concentrations (0.88 to 24.6 μM) of plant growth regulators (BA, Kn, 2iP & TDZ). The best medium for shoot regeneration was MS with 22.2 μM BA (5 shoots per explant), followed by 22.7 μM TDZ (4.6 shoots per explant). Addition of putriscine (9.3 μM) to MS medium containing 22.2 μM BA enhanced the number of multiple shoots to 7-8 but not the frequency of response. Shoot initials (measuring 1 cm) when separated and transferred on to MS medium containing 1.4 μM GA3 elongated to 2-5 cm in 15-20 d with 80% frequency. The per cent frequency of shoot differentiation was almost identical in the genotypes K-8 and K-636 but it differed significantly from the wild type. Leaf yellowing and abscission in all the genotypes was curtailed by supplementing the medium with 685 μM glutamine or 540 μM adenine. The excised shoots were transferred to root regeneration media containing 2.46 and 4.98 μM IBA or 2.6 and 5.3 μM NAA. Root regeneration was noticed with 100% frequency in all the three genotypes in presence of IBA or NAA. Plantlets were transferred successfully to the pots with 70% survival rate with no visible morphological variations. The protocol can be utilized for mass propagation and genetic transformation studies of this important pulpwood species.

AB  - This study was to evaluate the use of fodder salt (salt and dicotyledon hay mix) on daily intake of fodder salt (IFS) and pangola (Digitaria decumbens) hay, and intakes of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), hemicellulose (HCEL), lignin and water (AGU), in addition to daily weight gain (ADG) and feed conversion tatio of lambs in confinement. Fodder salts were compound by dicotyledon hay meal (90%), mineral salt (5%) and ground maize (5%). Thirty non-castrated male animals, crossbred Santa Inez, were distributed to a completely randomized design, with six fodder salts (mineral salt, fodder salts of: leucaena, (Leucaena leucocephala); aerial part of cassava, (Manihot esculenta); bean bravo (Macroptilium bracteatum); barriguda, (Ceiba samauma); quipé (Piptadenia moniliformis)], each with five replications. Fodder salts of leucaena and aerial part of cassava promoted better performance results, which evidence the potential of this forages in the formulation of fodder salts, used in the supplementation of diet for lambs in confinement. © 2009 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia.

AB  - The legume species Sesbania virgata establishes a specific and efficient symbiosis with Azorhizobium doebereinerae. Previous studies have shown that A. doebereinerae occurrence correlates to the presence of S. virgata. This work aimed to evaluate the occurrence of A. doebereinerae and of other nitrogen-fixing Leguminosae-nodulating bacteria (NFLNB) in soil samples collected adjacent to and 10 m away from the stems of five S. virgata plants in pasture areas. Symbiotic characteristics of isolates from these NFLNB populations were also studied. S. virgata and the four promiscuous legume species Leucaena leucocephala, Macroptilium atropurpureum, Phaseolus vulgaris and Vigna unguiculata were inoculated with soil samples to trap A. doebereinerae and other NFLNB. NFLNB capable of inducing nodulation in at least one of these legumes were found in all samples. M. atropurpureum was the most promiscuous species, as it trapped the highest number of NFLNB cultural types from soil suspensions. The other species were less promiscuous in the following order: V. unguiculata, P. vulgaris, and L. leucocephala. Isolates of the promiscuous legumes were classified into seven cultural groups. One of these groups, isolated from all promiscuous species, showed fast-growth alkali-reaction in culture medium (like Azorhizobium); it was identified as Cupriavidus. This is the first report of symbiosis of Cupriavidus with Papilionoideae species. The symbiotic efficiency of promiscuous hosts with NFLNB varied, but it was always less than that of controls with mineral nitrogen or an inoculant strain. S. virgata was efficiently nodulated only by A. doebereinerae, which occurred mainly in samples collected close to the plant stem, corroborating a high stimulus by its host species. A high diversity of NFLNB occurs as saprophytes close to the S. virgata root system.

AB  - Twelve Charolais Cuban males, of 140 kg of liveweight (LW) and 308 d of age were used for analyzing their productive performance. In the pre-fattening (June-September 2004), they grazed in a multiple association of legumes (Neonotonia wightii, Pueraria phaseloides and Macroptilium atropurpureum) and natural grassland. In the fattening-finalization (October 2004-June 2005) (with 241 kg of LW and 445 of LW at slaughter) they grazed in an association ofLeucaena leucocephala in 100 % of the area and natural grassland; in the dry season, in 2 ha of biomass bank of Pennisetum purpureum vc. Cuba CT-115. The stocking rate in each subsystem associated was of 2 animals ha-1 and 6 animals ha-1 in the biomass bank. During the finalization (≤ 363 kg of LW), the animals received 2 kg of supplement (9.20 % CP and 10.46 MJ ME per kg of DM). The mean daily gain (MDG) was of 0.885 kg in the pre-fattening (113 d), of 0.550 kg during the 58 d in the biomass bank; of 0.878 kg in the period of 102 d in leucaena, in the dry season and of 0.911 kg during the 90 d of silvopastural finalization in the rainy season. The total permanence was of 363 d, with 0.838 kg of LW of MDG and 22 months of age at slaughter. High MDG of LW may be obtained with this livestock, in systems associated of legumes, shrubs and natural grassland, reducing the MDG of LW in the biomass bank during the dry season without fertilization or irrigation.

AB  - Salinization/alkalization of agricultural lands is occurring throughout the world, waterlogging occurs as a result from sodicity generated infiltration. Because salinity, alkalinity and waterlogging induce injury, inhibit seed germination and vegetative, reproductive growth of plants, hence are in a way threatening the existence of life. The need of the hour is to find out some viable solution for handling this menace. Since the mechanical pumping of water is not feasible for vast areas, because of cost factor. The best solution seems to be the use of salinity/alkalinity and waterlogging tolerant tree germplasm, which is known for high transpiration rates. Some of the trees viz., Tamarix articulata, Casuarina equisetifolia, Prosopis juliflora, Acacia nilotica, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Terminalia arjuna and Leucaena leucocephala can be effectively used to pump out the ground water and recovering the valuable lands from all the related problems.

AB  - In Jamaica large quantities of wood are harvested annually for the production of charcoal. In the process, many of the island's native forests have been over-harvested. In an effort to diminish harvesting pressures on local forests, we propose a framework to assist with identifying potential planting sites for five exotic fuelwood species (i.e., Acacia auriculiformis, Casuarina equisetifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Prosopis juliflora, and Senna siamea) intended for the commercial production of biomass energy in Jamaica. Suitable planting sites are identified according to (i) the species' biophysical requirements, (ii) natural life-zone delimitations based, in part, on Digital Elevation Model (DEM)-based calculations of annual biotemperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration, and (iii) soil pH. The paper also provides a detailed scientific analysis of fuelwood growth and yield characteristics, as well as fuelwood-burning and charcoal-yielding characteristics for plants grown in a model fuelwood project on the southwest coast of Jamaica. Mass production of charcoal is considered feasible with two of the five fuelwood species considered, namely A. auriculiformis and L. leucocephala. Both species have high charcoal yields (>20 Mg ha -1), comparatively good charcoal-to-dry weight conversion ratios (>20%), high heating value (>14.4 MJ kg-1), and an abundance of suitable planting sites across the island. S. siamea had a greater number of planting sites identified, but its heating potential (14.2 MJ kg-1) and charcoal yield (14%) were the lowest among the five species evaluated.

AB  - Invasive plants are causing ecological impacts from local to global scale. Remote sensing imagery was used for providing spatial information at landscape level that increased effective management of invasions into native habitats. Leucaena leucocephala (L. leucocephala) have become one of the most invasive plants of Taiwan. The study explores the possibility of using SPOT data for mapping the spatial distribution of L. leucocephala in the Hengchun Peninsula. Field and remote sensing research was conducted in 2007 to determine the potential of multispectral imagery for discrimination and mapping of L. leucocephala in this study area. In fields, L. leucocephala was efficiently discriminated in March and July. Thus SPOT satellite imagery was acquired for wet (March 31) and dry (July 20) seasons to represent the phonological stages of leaf cover and leaf fall respectively. Three classification methods were evaluated using single-wet and dry, and multi-temporal imagery to determine the most accuracy. A maximum likelihood algorithm was used to classify L. leucocephala class. The class accuracy achieved for L. leucocephala using the multi-temporal imagery described in this study was 83.12 % for user's accuracy and 86.20% for producer's accuracy. Furthermore, aerial photography was applied to reduce the commission errors of post-classification map. This technique can provide a powerful tool for prioritizing control programs and for monitoring results of L. leucocephala at landscape level.

AB  - The input of organic matter to the soil by legumes in alley cropping systems may be an alternative for a sustainable soil use in the humid tropics. The objective of this study was to compare the input of oxidizable organic matter in a combination of residues from different legumes in alley cropping systems on an Ultisol. Two legume species were evaluated: leucena (Leucaena leucocephala) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), which have high-quality residues, and Philippine pigeonwings (Clitoria fairchildiana) and acacia (Acacia mangium), with low-quality residues. The residues were combined in the following treatments: Philippine pigeonwings + pigeon pea; leucena + pigeon pea; acacia + pigeon pea; Philippine pigeonwings + leucena; leucena + acacia; an area without legumes was used as control. Soil samples were taken from the layers 0-5 and 5-10 cm in the crop inter-row. Total organic carbon (TOC) was quantified and divided into four fractions (F1, F2, F3 and F4) with decreasing oxidation degrees. In the areas with Philippine pigeonwings/leucena, acacia/leucena and acacia/pigeon pea the TOC content was higher at the depth of 0-5 cm. In the area without legumes the TOC content was the lowest at the depth of 5-10 cm. The highest TOC proportion was observed in the F1+F2 fractions, and the carbon contents for these fractions were lower in the area without legumes. In the acacia/pigeon pea treatment the C content was higher in the F1 fraction at both depths, while the TOC proportions were greater in the treatment leucaena/pigeon pea in the fractions F3 + F4. The results indicate that the combination of high and low quality residues (acacia/pigeon pea) favors the increase of easily decomposable organic matter, while the use of high-quality residues resulted in higher carbon proportions in the more resistant fractions (F3 + F4).

AB  - Caffeoyl coenzyme A O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) is an important enzyme that participates in lignin biosynthesis especially in the formation of cell wall ferulic esters of plants. It plays a pivotal role in the methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group of caffeoyl CoA. Two cDNA clones that code CCoAOMT were isolated earlier from subabul and in the present study; 3D models of CCoAOMT1 and CCoAOMT2 enzymes were built using the MODELLER7v7 software to find out the substrate binding sites. These two proteins differed only in two amino acids and may have little or no functional redundancy. Refined models of the proteins were obtained after energy minimization and molecular dynamics in a solvated water layer. The models were further assessed by PROCHECK, WHATCHECK, Verify_3D and ERRAT programs and the results indicated that these models are reliable for further active site and docking analysis. The refined models showed that the two proteins have 9 and 10 β-helices, 6 and 7 β-sheets respectively. The models were used for docking the substrates CoA, SAM, SAH, caffeoyl CoA, feruloyl CoA, 5-hydroxy feruloyl CoA and sinapyl CoA which showed that CoA and caffeoyl CoA are binding with high affinity with the enzymes in the presence and absence of SAM. It appears therefore that caffeoyl CoA is the substrate for both the isoenzymes. The results also indicated that CoA and caffeoyl CoA are binding with higher affinity to CCoAOMT2 than CCoAOMT1. Therefore, CCoAOMT2 conformation is thought to be the active form that exists in subabul. Docking studies indicated that conserved active site residues Met58, Thr60, Val63, Glu82, Gly84, Ser90, Asp160, Asp162, Thr169, Asn191 and Arg203 in CCoAOMT1 and CCoAOMT2 enzymes create the positive charge to balance the negatively charged caffeoyl CoA and play an important role in maintaining a functional conformation and are directly involved in donor-substrate binding. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

AB  - Four herbaceous (Aeschynomene histrix, Stylosanthes fruticosa, Centrosema pubescens and Mucuna pruriens var. utilis) and 2 browse forage legumes (Cajanus cajan and Leucaena leucocephala) were tested in a complete randomised block design (4 replicates) on infertile soils in the Borgou region of Benin over 3 consecutive rainy seasons (2000-2002). Leaf and stem production were measured as well as crude protein, crude fibre, ash and mineral concentrations in leaves. The number of original plants surviving declined in all species except leucaena as the study progressed. Browse legumes produced more leaf material (including stems < 5 mm in diameter; mean of 4450 kg/ha DM) (P<0.05) than herbaceous legumes (mean of 2370 kg/ha). While leaf production of leucaena increased with time, that of the remaining species declined as the study progressed. The lowest production (P<0.05) was recorded for M. pruriens (1480 kg/ha DM). Leaf:stem ratio for the browse legumes (0.35-0.49:1) was lower (P<0.05) than for the herbaceous legumes (0.87-1.10:1). Leaf material for all species was an acceptable source of crude protein (16-28% DM) tp complement available forage on natural pastures and savannahs, especially during the dry season. However, concentrations of sodium and zinc in the material were below recommended levels for ruminant feeding.

Recent use of the YFEL to diagnose plant nutrient status of Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata (leucaena) pastures has given unreliable results. Two field trials, one irrigated and one dryland, were conducted in subtropical Queensland to investigate the effect of index leaf selection, plant phenology and environmental factors (ambient temperature and water stress) on leaf nutrient concentrations. The YFEL was identified as the best plant part to sample because it was readily identifiable and had consistent concentrations of most nutrients compared to older and younger leaves provided specific conditions were met when sampling. At both sites there was significant (P < 0.05) seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations in leucaena YFEL, which was poorly correlated with ambient temperature but strongly correlated with rainfall in the preceding 28 days and chronological age of YFEL. Advancing plant phenological stage of development increased the chronological age of YFEL from 12 to 73 days under irrigation since no new leaves were produced for prolonged periods during pod filling and maturation. Similarly, YFEL could be 146 days old on plants in vegetative stages of growth under prolonged drought in dryland conditions.YFELof ~21 days of age or less were found to be optimal for analysis. Furthermore, as the calcium (Ca) concentration of YFEL was strongly correlated with leaf chronological age, this parameter could be used to determine the age of the leaves sampled. YFEL with Ca concentrations >0.75% DM were likely to be >21 days in age and should not be used for the diagnosis of plant nutrient status. It was concluded that leaf analysis could be used to confidently assess leucaena plant nutrient status provided the YFEL were sampled from actively growing plants in vegetative development that had received rainfall/irrigation in the preceding 28 days and were <21 days of age. © CSIRO 2009.

AB  - The effect of moisture on seedling growth of Albizzia lebbek Benth., Dalbergia sissoo Roxb., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit., Shorea robusta Gaertn.f. and Tectona grandis L. was evaluated in the Tarai region of Uttarakhand, India during 2002-2004. Seedlings raised in polyethylene bags containing about 4 kg of garden soil were subjected to four watering frequencies by irrigating daily and at 7, 14 and 21 days intervals, respectively designated as no stress, intermediate, high and very high stress. Periodical observations began one month after seedling establishment. Seedling height and dry biomass decreased at very high stress in all species. The reduction (relative to no stress) in height and biomass was maximum in L. leucocephala (75.8% and 99.8%) and minimum in A. lebbek (53.8% and 81.6%). The average single leaf area also decreased significantly with increasing water stress. The specific leaf area increased with increasing water stress in all species except for S. robusta, which showed a reverse pattern. The leaf area ratio increased along with moisture stress (except for S. robusta). A reverse pattern was found in relative growth rate and net assimilation rate in all species (except for S. robusta and T. grandis). Under very high stress, L. leucocephala maintained higher ψ and proline content and A. lebbek showed lower values indicating, respectively, their drought resistance and susceptibility. The osmotic adjustment in different species under very high stress was in the order: L. leucocephala > T. grandis > D. sissoo > S. robusta and > A. lebbek. Generally, net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate decreased and stomatal resistance increased in very high water stress compared to no stress in all species. The percent reduction (relative to maximum) in photosynthesis under severe moisture stress was highest in A. lebbek and lowest in L. leucocephala and T. grandis, whereas transpiration rate was highest in T. grandis and lowest in L. leucocephala indicating that the latter is more drought resistant. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.

TI  - Mesorhizobium gobiense sp. nov. and Mesorhizobium tarimense sp. nov., isolated from wild legumes growing in desert soils of Xinjiang, China
PY  - 2008
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-55849105221&doi=10.1099%2fijs.0.2008%2f000125-0&partnerID=40&md5=b4d4e1d0ec1c1f06dc8ce00d5dd12ba5
AB  - Twenty-four Mesorhizobium strains were isolated from desert soils in the Xinjiang region of China and were characterized by a polyphasic approach. These strains grouped into three clusters in IGS-RFLP, SDS-PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins and BOX-PCR analysis, corresponding to genomic species V, VI and VII as found in a previous study. The results were supported by sequencing analyses of rrs, IGS, atpD and recA genes. Genospecies VII was most related to Mesorhizobium septentrionale, while genospecies V and VI were both most closely related to Mesorhizobium tianshanense, but were distinct from each other and from M. tianshanense. The DNA-DNA hybridization value between the representative strain CCBAU 83284 (genospecies VII) and the type strain of M. septentrionale was 90.1 %. Genospecies VII was thus defined as M. septentrionale. The DNA-DNA relatedness value for representative strains of genospecies V or VI with the related reference strains of recognized species were always lower than 60 %. Low values of DNA-DNA hybridization (32.79 %) between representative strains of genospecies V (CCBAU 83330T) and of VI (CCBAU 83306T) were also observed. Based upon these results, two novel species are proposed: Mesorhizobium gobiense sp. nov. represented by genospecies V (type strain, CCBAU 83330T=LMG 23949T=HAMBI 2974T) and Mesorhizobium tarimense sp. nov. represented by genospecies VI (type strain, CCBAU 83306T=LMG 24338T-HAMBI 2973T). Strain CCBAU 83278 grouped as the most peripheral member with genospecies VI in SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins and BOX-PCR analysis and in the phylogenetic tree of 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (IGS) sequences. The results of analyses of rrs, atpD and recA gene sequences, as well as those of DNA-DNA hybridization studies, strongly supported the suggestion that this strain belonged to a species quite different from genospecies V and VI and from any other recognized species of the genus Mesorhizobium. As only one strain has been isolated to date, strain CCBAU 83278 was not proposed as a novel species in this study. Mesorhizobium gobiense sp. nov. and Mesorhizobium tarimense sp. nov. could be differentiated from each other as well as from recognized species of the genus Mesorhizobium on the basis of phenotypic characteristics. The symbiotic loci (nodC and nifH) of the two novel species formed two phylogenetic branches related to Mesorhizobium loti and M. tianshanense. The type strains of the two novel species were able to nodulate Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Lotus corniculatus, Oxytropis glabra and Robinia pseudoacacia but not Astragalus membranaceus, Leucaena leucocephala, Phaseolus vulgaris, Pisum sativum or Medicago sativa. © 2008 IUMS.

AB  - Longissimus dorsi samples were obtained from 23 Criollo Limonero (CL) steers, that were subjected to supplementation treatments (at 36 months of age), during 158 d of fattening on pasture, as follows: T1= a non-suplemented (control) group, grazing on Echinochloa polystachia grass; T2= grazing plus 1 Kg/d/head of a concentrate to 11% Crude Protein (CP), and T3= grazing plus 1h/d of pruning an arboreal legume (Leucaena leucocephala). After postmortem, muscles samples were removed from their carcasses to study the effects of supplementation on the proximal (content of protein, moisture, total lipids and ash) and mineral composition (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, and P), cholesterol content. Analysis of variance was conducted by the least squares method. The variance analysis did not reveal significant effect (P>0.05) of the supplementation treatments on the proximal composition, cholesterol and mineral content in the longissimus dorsi muscle. Meat derived from Criollo Limonero steers showed low levels of total lipids and cholesterol, which indicated that meat derived from these animals could be marketed as light meat or low in fat. © 2009 Universidad del Zulia.

AB  - The evolution of the biodiversity in plants and soil was studied in the Institute of Animal Science during 2003, 2004, and 2005 in different tropical grasslands under exploitation with cattle presence: a) silvopastoral system based on Leucaena leucocephala-Panicum maximum, b) monoculture of Panicum maximum, and c) mixture of creeping legumes (Pueraria phaseoloides, Macroptilium atropurpureum, and Neonotonia wightii). The total number of individuals, the uniformity of the sample, and the biodiversity were determined. The samplings were performed twice per season by counting individuals from each plant species and edaphic fauna. The silvopastoral grassland showed increasing evolution of the edaphic biodiversity, with values of biodiversity between 1.69 and 2.17 in the rainy season, and without differences in the dry season. Meanwhile, the plants reduced the biodiversity from 1.16 to 0.60 in the dry season, and from 1.46 to 0.88 in the rainy season, due to the disappearance of weeds and the strengthening and increment of Guinea grass as basic pasture. The grassland with monoculture had decline in the edaphic biodiversity in the dry and rainy season, respectively (from 1.83 to 0.78 and from 1.78 to 1.13). The vegetation was diversified by little desired plants and reached 1.76. The grassland with mixture of creeping legumes had similar performance to the silvopastoral. The plant biodiversity in this grassland diminished up to 1.01, and the fauna of the soil increased biodiversity up to 2.97. It is concluded that in silvopastoral grasslands and those with mixtures of legumes, he management and type of grassland favored the biodiversity. Nevertheless, in the system with monoculture, this indicator evolved due to the inadequate management. Further studies are recommended in other types of grasslands to go deeper into the performance of this indicator in our conditions in cattle areas.

AB  - This work was carried out with the objective of performing the izoenzymatic characterization of 23 accessions of Leucaena spp., which included five species of the Leucaena genus (L. leucocephala, L. lanceolata, L. diversifolia, L. macrophylla and L. esculenta), in addition to the commercial cultivars L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham, L. leucocephala cv. Perú, L. leucocephala cv. Ipil-Ipil, and L. leucocephala cv. CNIA-250. For the development of the trial, the isoenzyme analyses of peroxidases, α- and β- esterases, malato dehydrogenases, and alcohol dehydrogenases were made. The data obtained were subject to multivariate statistical analysis. The isoenzymatic systems (esterases and peroxidases) turned out to be polymorphic in the sample studied, mainly esterases, and the analysis of genetic diversity allowed to differentiate L. leucocephala with higher clarity than the rest of the species studied, although there was no gain regarding discrimination within the species. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - Survival, emergence, and branch girdling by Oncideres pustulata LeConte on huisache, Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd., and leucaena, Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, the preferred host plants, were compared in field studies in northeastern Mexico during 2003-2005. Most mortality of medium- to large-sized larvae was attributed to predation by birds, while small larvae were killed by cold temperatures (<4°C) during the winter of 2004. Birds observed preying upon O. pustulata were the bronzed cowbird, Molothrus aeneus (Wagler), and red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus L. Predation by birds was two to three times greater on leucaena than huisache, probably because of the softer wood of leucaena. Consequently, emergence of adults from huisache was 50-80% greater than from leucaena. The relationship between cumulative emergence rate and time was sigmoidal (r2 = 0.99), with 50% emerging during early October, irrespective of host plant or year. The sex ratio of emerging adults throughout the study was skewed toward females (1.6:1) regardless of host plant or year. The relationship between cumulative rates of branch girdling and time was also sigmoidal (r2 ≥ 0.98) with no significant difference between host plants. The number of branches girdled per tree ranged from 4.6 in 2003 to 0.1 in 2005 as a consequence of the impact of subfreezing temperatures during the previous winter. Although the number of branches girdled by O. pustulata was similar in both host plants, the average diameter of girdled twigs was significantly greater in leucaena (2.8 cm) than huisache (2.2 cm), probably because of the softer wood of leucaena. O. pustulata successfully utilized both huisache and leucaena as host plants. However, our results suggested that more O. pustulata survived and emerged on huisache. This probably is because of less predation by birds on larvae in huisache because of its harder wood, as compared to leucaena.

AB  - An endophagous seed predator, Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae), utilizes Neotropical Leucaena (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae). One of its hosts, Leucaena leucocephala, is a fast-growing nitrogen-fixing tree that serves as a multipurpose beneficial plant but eventually becomes an aggressive invader where it was introduced. Herein, we report A. macrophthalmus invasion of the Far East, South Asian tropics and subtropics (Japanese Pacific Islands, Taiwan, Southern China, Northern Thailand and Southern India). Of other field-collected mimosoid legumes, an introduced tree, Falcataria moluccana, in Taiwan was found to be used by the seed predator. Conversely, our published work review revealed that the seed predator had retained high host specificity to Leucaena species in its native and introduced regions. Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus was able to utilize aphagously postharvest mature seeds for oviposition and larval development, which is a trait of post-dispersal seed predators. We confirmed that A. macrophthalmus that was reared on L. leucocephala was able to utilize F. moluccana as well. Although the relatively high host specificity of the oligophagous beetle is suitable for controlling the weedy L. leucocephala, the potential host range expansion confirmed by this study must be cautioned. © 2009 The Entomological Society of Japan.

AB  - With the objective of determining whether in a silvopastoral system (formed by an association of improved grasses and L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham) the morphobotanical characteristics of the predominant species were maintained, a characterization study was performed after 10 years of exploitation. Several quantitative descriptors were used for the grasses as well as the legumes that were present in higher quantity in the system, which were determined through the botanical composition of the pastureland. To process the results, a principal component analysis was used. The botanical composition of the pasture allowed proving the existence of two predominant species: Panicum maximum cv. Likoni and Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham. Both species showed high variability accumulated with regards to the indicators measured: 93.86 and 94.73% for the grass and the legume, respectively. This result is considered to be an encouraging symptom, because in this system with more than a decade of exploitation the morphological characteristics of the two most representatives species are maintained. The characterization activity is important for determining the morphobotanical stability of plants. It is recommended to use these measurements in similar studies. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - In the present study, in vitro regeneration system for a recalcitrant woody tree legume, Leucaena leucocephala (cvs. K-8, K-29, K-68 and K-850) from mature tree derived nodal explants as well as seedling derived cotyledonary node explants was developed. Best shoot initiation and elongation was found on full-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 3 % (m/v) sucrose, 100 mg dm-3 myoinositol, 100 mg dm-3 glutamine, 20.9 μM N 6-benzylamino-purine (BAP) and 5.37 μM 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Rooting was induced in half-strength MS medium containing 2 % (m/v) sucrose, 100 mg dm-3 myoinositol, 14.76 μM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 0.23 μM kinetin. The cultivar K-29 gave the best response under in vitro conditions. Rooted plantlets were subjected to hardening and successfully transferred to greenhouse. Further, somatic embryogenesis from nodal explants of cv. K-29 via an intermittent callus phase was also established. Pronounced callusing was observed on full-strength MS medium containing 3 % (m/v) sucrose, 100 mg dm-3 myoinositol, 40.28 μM NAA and 12.24 μM BAP. These calli were transferred to induction medium and maximum number of globular shaped somatic embryos was achieved in full-strength MS medium fortified with 3 % (m/v) sucrose, 100 mg dm-3 myoinositol, 15.0 μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 5.0 μM BAP and 1.0 mM proline. Moreover, an increase in endogenous proline content up to 28 th day of culture in induction medium was observed. These globular shaped somatic embryos matured in full-strength MS medium with 3 % (m/v) sucrose, 100 mg dm-3 myoinositol, 10.0 μM BAP, 2.5 to 5.0 μM IBA and 0.5 mM spermidine. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to calculate simple allometric equations in order to estimate above and below ground dry biomass from Leucaena leucocephala individuals. Results indicated that biomass components show the following pattern: stem > branches > roots > leaves. Independently from individual size, 24 % of total sampled dry biomass was located below-ground, and 76 % above-ground. Log transformed linear equations using CBH (circumference at breast height) as independent variable was statistically significant (P<0.05) to estimate leucaena total dry biomass.

AB  - Two consecutive feeding trials were carried out on 4 adult male animals each of sheep and goat separately on Cenchrus ciliaris-Leucaena leucocephala (CC-LL) and Cenchrus ciliaris-Grewia optiva (CC-GO) diets. Sheep and goats were fed grass and tree leaves in 75:25 and 50:50 ratios (DM basis), respectively, for 2 months and thereafter a digestion trial was conducted on each diet to assess feed intake and nutrients digestibility. Rumen liquor samples were collected separately on both diets at 0 and 4 h post feeding to determine metabolite concentration in rumen of sheep and goat. CP was higher in LL and lower in fibre than GO. DMI was relatively lower in sheep than in goat on CC-LL diet, while on CC-GO diet both species had identical feed intake. Sheep and goat had 9-10 units higher DM and fibre digestibility on CC-GO than CC-LL diet, while species exhibited no difference for DM digestibility on each diet. Goat had higher CP digestibility than sheep on CC-GO diet, however on CC-LL diet such difference was not evident. Eating rate (g/kg W0.75) was relatively more in sheep up to 4 and 6 h feeding on both CC-LL and CC-GO diets than in goat. TVFA concentration (meq/1) in rumen liquor of sheep was higher on CC-GO than on CC-LL diet. Total-N (mg/100 ml) in rumen liquor of sheep was higher in sheep on CC-LL than on CC-GO diet, while values were comparable in goats on both diets. Results indicated that sheep and goats had relatively higher feed intake, nutrients digestibility and TVFA production on CC-GO than on CC-LL diet.

TI  - Effects of the composting and the heating rate on biomass gasification
PY  - 2009
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-64249149326&doi=10.1021%2fef8005806&partnerID=40&md5=046492dadecff330d6ff92c27f887ebc
AB  - In biomass gasification facilities different biomasses are used, with different proportions of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. Several pretreatments are performed in these installations in an effort to change physical characteristics of the feedstock such as drying, size reduction, size fractionation, and leaching with water. Taking into account that lignin gasification produces more hydrogen than other components of the biomass, it could be of interest as a pretreatment that improves lignin content. Composting is a biological process that modifies biomass composition, increasing lignin content. Without going into any economic details, the present work studies the effect of biomass composting (biological pretreatment) on hydrogen production in air gasification. This laboratory-scale experience was completed, studying the effect of the heating rate on the gasification process. In this study, two different biomasses were used: Leucaena (Leucaena Leucocephala) and Tagasaste (Chamaecytisus palmensis). The experimental results show that combining slow heating rate and biomass composting, hydrogen production increases 20% (into studied range). This result can be related with feedstock composition (inorganic matter and lignin contents) and char properties. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

TI  - In vitro assessment of the suitability of replacing the low-tannin legume Vigna unguiculata with the tanniniferous legumes Leucaena leucocephala, Flemingia macrophylla or Calliandra calothyrsus in a tropical grass diet
PY  - 2008
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-53449085296&doi=10.1016%2fj.anifeedsci.2007.09.012&partnerID=40&md5=80b7021e60098f38cb30ed8ab35ff6b5
AB  - An in vitro experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects on ruminal fermentation and crude protein (CP) degradation of a partial replacement of Vigna unguiculata (CIAT 391), a high quality, herbaceous legume, by tanniniferous shrub legumes of contrasting quality in combination with the tropical grass Brachiaria humidicola. All mixtures consisted of B. humidicola and legume foliage [1:1, on dry matter (DM) basis]. The legume part of the mixtures consisted either of V. unguiculata alone or of mixtures (3:2) of this legume with Leucaena leucocephala, Flemingia macrophylla or Calliandra calothyrsus. Contents of total condensed tannins (g/kg DM) of L. leucocephala, F. macrophylla and C. calothyrsus were 51, 124 and 311, respectively. The experiment was conducted using a rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC) (n = 8). The partial replacement of V. unguiculata by any tanniniferous shrub decreased (P<0.05) ammonia concentration in the fermenter fluid and apparent fibre degradation. However, the decrease was more pronounced with C. calothyrsus and F. macrophylla than with L. leucocephala. Apparent degradation of organic matter and CP decreased (P<0.05) when V. unguiculata was partially replaced by C. calothyrsus or F. macrophylla, but not (P>0.05) when L. leucocephala was included. These results indicate that V. unguiculata may be partially replaced by L. leucocephala without seriously affecting the ruminal fermentation characteristics of the complete diet. In contrast, the same level of inclusion of F. macrophylla or C. calothyrsus, suppressed in vitro fermentation and nutrient degradation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The research on the effect of forages energy level on production and reproduction performances of Kosta female goat was conducted in two phases. The first phase, was observing the growth of Kosta female goat starting from the weaning age of 4 months to first puberty at 7 months and then to mating at 9 months. The variables found at this stage were: daily weight gain, the rations consumed, and the puberty age of the herd. The second phase was observing Kosta female goat from mating until giving birth. The variables determined were: ration consumed, body weight gain, length of pregnancy, litter size, birth weight and weaning weight. The research was conducted in experimental methods by using 24 four months old Kosta female goats weighing 6-7kg, and 3 ram aged at 3-4 years. The design of the experiment used was completely randomized design. The treatments were 3 levels of ration energy 53% TDN (R ), 61% TDN (R2) and 69% TDN (R3), with relatively equal protein percentage of 12% (isoprotein). Each treatment was replicated 8 times. The rations were forage consisted of field grass, leaves of: waru (Hibiscus tiliaceum. L), lamtoro (Leucaena glauca), gamal (Gliricida septium), and jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophylla). Generally, result of this experiment indicated that: (1) the higher the dietary energy up to 61% TDN in the ration, the higher the production performances of Kosta female goats in term of efficiency of ration usage, body weight gain, birth weight, and weaning weight; (2) the higher the dietary energy up to 61% TDN in the ration, the higher the reproduction performances of Kosta female goats in term of age of puberty, length of pregnancy, and litter size. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2009.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the role of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase of symbionts in nodulation and growth of Leucaena leucocephala. The acdS genes encoding ACC deaminase were cloned from Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 and Sinorhizobium sp. BL3 in multicopy plasmids, and transferred to TAL1145. The BL3-acdS gene greatly enhanced ACC deaminase activity in TAL1145 compared to the native acdS gene. The transconjugants of TAL1145 containing the native or BL3 acdS gene could grow in minimal media containing 1.5 mM ACC, whereas BL3 could tolerate up to 3 mM ACC. The TAL1145 acdS gene was inducible by mimosine and not by ACC, while the BL3 acdS gene was highly inducible by ACC and not by mimosine. The transconjugants of TAL1145 containing the native- and BL3-acdS genes formed nodules with greater number and sizes, and produced higher root mass on L. leucocephala than by TAL1145. This study shows that the introduction of multiple copies of the acdS gene increased ACC deaminase activities of TAL1145 and enhanced its symbiotic efficiency on L. leucocephala. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Rhizobium multihospitium sp. nov., isolated from multiple legume species native of Xinjiang, China
PY  - 2008
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-52449101577&doi=10.1099%2fijs.0.65568-0&partnerID=40&md5=7caaa98b9229aab92570289258435c1c
AB  - Thirty-one rhizobial strains isolated from nodules of legumes native of Xinjiang, China, were characterized. These strains were classified as belonging to the genus Rhizobium based on amplified 16S rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). The strains were distinguished from recognized Rhizobium species using analysis of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacers (IGS-RFLP), SDS-PAGE analysis of whole proteins and BOX-PCR; the test strains always formed a distinct cluster with patterns that were quite different from those of the reference rhizobial strains used. According to the phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene, the test strains belonged to the genus Rhizobium, with Rhizobium tropici, Rhizobium rhizogenes and Rhizobium lusitanum as the closest related species, with 99.6, 99.2 and 99.4% sequence similarities, respectively, between the type strains of the three Rhizobium species and strain CCBAU 83401T. Phylogenetic analyses of the representative strains using IGS and atpD, recA and glnII genes all confirmed the phylogenetic arrangements obtained using the 16S rRNA gene. The DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain CCBAU 83401T and strains CCBAU 83364, CCBAU 83345 and CCBAU 83523 ranged from 80.8 to 100 %, showing that they belong to the same species. The DNA-DNA relatedness between strain CCBAU 83401T and R. tropici IIB CIAT 899T, R. tropici IIA CFN 299, R. rhizogenes LMG 150T and R. lusitanum P1-7T were 26.9, 27.7, 38.2 and 22.6 %, respectively, clearly indicating that strain CCBAU 83401T represents a novel species. Phenotypic characterization of four representative strains, CCBAU 83401T, CCBAU 83364, CCBAU 83345 and CCBAU 83523, showed several distinctive features that differentiated them from closely related species. The 31 strains had identical nodD and nifH genes, which were very similar to those of the bean-nodulating R. lusitanum, Devosia neptuniae and R. tropici IIB. Based upon these results, the strains from this study are considered to represent a novel species, for which the name Rhizobium multihospitium sp. nov. is proposed. The DNA G+C content ranged from 65.3 to 66.0 mol% (Tm). The type strain is CCBAU 83401T (=LMG 23946T=HAMBI 2975T), which nodulates Robinia pseudoacacia, but not Leucaena leucocephala, Phaseolus vulgaris, Pisum sativum or Medicago sativa. © 2008 IUMS.

AB  - As nematodes cause great damage to Brazilian coffee production, effective methods to control these parasites are necessary. In a previous work Allium cepa L., Cajanus cajan (L.) Mill., Crotalaria juncea L., Ficus elastica Roxb., Ruta graveolens L., Stylosanthes guianensis Aubl., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) Dewit., Brachiaria decumbens Stapf., Catharanthus roseus G. Don, Tagetes minuta L., Ricinus communis L. and Coffea arabica L. produced active substances against Meloidogyne exigua Goeldi, a nematode widely disseminated through Brazilian coffee fields. Thus, aqueous extracts of such plants, collected in a different season from that of the previous work, as well as crude metabolites produced in liquid medium by Fusarium moniliforme Shelden and Cylindrocarpon magnusianum (Sacc.) Woll., were submitted to in vitro assays with M. exigua second-stage juveniles (J2). All plants and fungi produced active substances against J2. Therefore, their metabolites were applied to six-month-old coffee plants inoculated with M. exigua. After 90 days in a greenhouse, those samples obtained from A. cepa, L. leucocephala, R. graveolens and F. moniliforme inhibited the production of galls and eggs by M. exigua, demonstrating potential to control such parasite.

AB  - For most legumes and other endemic plants for animal consumption, seed requires scarification methods and induction with giberilic acid (AG3), to obtain greater germination and growth of plants in the early stages. The objective of the study was to evaluate methods to improve germination on seeds of guaje (Leucaena leucocephala), guajillo (Leucaena lanceolota), catispa (Gliricidia sepium), guacima (Guazuma ulmifolia), and capomo (Brosimum alicastrum) under 65% of shade with mesh. The study was located in a temperate subtropical climate with rains in summer, average precipitation annual 1,283 mm and average temperature annual 240C. Seeds of high vigor were collected and selected during the low water in localities of the entity. After 30 d of the collection, seed planting was done in a culture box, with a substrate made of sugar cane residues, sawdust, and pumice stone (1:1:0.5). A completely randomized design with eight treatments and three repetitions was used. The results of the variance analysis showed significant differences (P>0.05) among treatments. The highest germination was observed in seeds exposed to 750C for 30 sec and water soaking at 180C for 24 h with AG3 dose from 600 to 2,300 mg/L, and significantly higher (P>0,05) than the other treatments. The control treatment resulted with the smallest amount of germinated seed and the maximum germinative capacity of the species appeared between 3 and 10 d. Plants with doses from 2,300 to 300 mg/L of AG3 started stems, leaves, and roots elongation in all species, although there was a lag when change to plastic pots for establishment. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - Based on the theory of ecology, this article conducted a landscape ecological evaluation on Leucaena leucocephala artificial forest in the arid-hot valley, Yuanmou Xiaokua hill, using a combination method of qualitative analysis and landscape comprehensive evaluation. The comprehensive evaluation indexes of landscape include forest coverage, biodiversity, stability, soil erosion, environmental quality, availability, scientific research characteristic, economic benefits. Using AHP (analytical hierarchy process), determine the grade of ecological evaluation factors and the weight of evaluation index and calculate the CEI (comprehensive evaluation index) on ecological evaluation. Evaluation results showed that the area CEI was 0.714 225, a better quality of the ecological level, but biodiversity indicators was the lowest. To sum up, it was difficult to maintain ecological restoration effectiveness and process but also guarantee a good biodiversity in the arid-hot valleys. We must reasonably arrange the alien species and the native species, in order to obtain a stable and sustainable eco-system. © 2008 Wuhan University and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

Chemical composition, fractions, mineral concentration, amino acid contents, in vitro organic matter digestibility and energy values showed a wide variation among the species. Crude protein (CP) ranged from 8.5 to 23.9%, and M. alba showed the highest and M. indica the lowest. CP, EE, NFE, ash and CF were 26.2, 2.2, 48.5, 9.1 and 13.7% respectively. The CF fractions, viz. NDF, ADF, ADL, cellulose and hemicellulose were 55.1, 43.3, 15.9, 25.7 and 11.8% respectively. Mineral concentration varied among species but all leaves were rich in Ca and P, and moderate in K, Fe and Co. M. indica was inferior in CP but there was very little variation in individual and total amino acid contents. Organic matter digestibility ranged 41.2 to 76.9% with 53.4% digestibility. All the leaves were quite rich in gross and metabolizable energy (ME) but poor in net energy for lactation. In conclusion the tree leaves, especially M. alba, S. sesban, L. leucocephala and S. asper have the great potential to be used as feed for livestock considering nutritive points of view.

AB  - In a semi-arid region in western Venezuela at Zulia state, we studied the effect of four periods of deferment of use (PDU: 42, 84, 126, and 168 days) after the first cut on the accumulation of biomass in an association of buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) and Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), estimating production of its components in the grass (leaves, stems, and dead material) and the legume fine fraction (leaves, leaf stalk, and stems with diameter less than 5 mm) and thick fraction (stems with diameter above 5 mm). Plant samples were taken at three strata for buffel (0-15, 15-30, and > 30 cm) and leucaena (0-60, 60-120, and > 120 cm). After every PDU cut, plots were harvested every 42 days to evaluate regrowth. A randomized block experimental design with three replicates was used. Results indicated yields for both species with values of 1,146 and 1,925 kg DM/ha for buffel and leucaena, respectively. There were found differences among treatments (P>0.05) only on the legume being the best PDU 42 and 0 days. The highest leaf proportion and the lowest dead material content (P<0.05) for the grass was found on the upper layer. Meanwhile, leucaena highest values of fine fraction was found on the medium layer. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - A study was carried out to compare the nutrient faecal digestibility in diets with tropical forages in fattening rabbits, determinated by total collection (direct) and acid-insoluble ash (indirect) methods. Seventy two new Zealand x California rabbits of 45 days of age, fed with diets that contained 30 % of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), trichanthera (Trichanthera gigantea), mulberry (Morus alba), peanut forage (Arachis pintoi) and sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) foliage were used. Rabbits were housed individually in cages of 20 x 30 cm, and distributed according to a completely randomized design with six treatments and 12 repetitions. The values obtained for dry matter (57.62 vs. 57.84 %), organic matter (59.97 vs. 60.21 %), energy (58.85 vs. 59.05 %), raw protein (71.03 vs. 71.15 %), neutral detergent fiber (35.40 vs. 35.82 %), acid detergent fiber (17.95 vs. 18.69 %) and hemicellulose digestibility (52.11 vs. 52.56 %) did not show statistical differences (P>0.10) between direct and indirect methods, respectively. Due to its simplicity and low cost, the acid-insoluble ash method constitutes a practical, reliable and applicable procedure for nutritional valuation of tropical forages for rabbits. © 2008 Universidad Centroccidental "Lisandro Alvarado" (UCLA).

AB  - An on-farm trial was conducted to determine dry matter production of four fodder tree species and their effect on soil water and maize production. The trees were planted in rows intercropped with maize. The four tree species selected were Acacia karroo Hayne (indigenous fodder tree), Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit (nitrogen fixing), Morus alba L. (fodder and fruit), and Gleditsia triacanthos L. (fodder and fuel). Volumetric soil water was measured in the upper 0.3 m of soil in each row of the trial using the time domain reflectometry technique. The neutron probe technique was used for monitoring the water content deeper in the soil. Geostatistical methods were used to analyse treatment differences in the upper 0.3 m of soil. The soil water content did not differ significantly between the maize and tree rows indicating that competition for water in the upper horizon was not the reason for lower maize yields. However, at greater soil depths (75-125 cm) trees in the wide spacing used less water than those in the narrow spacing. Light interception was an important factor in reducing maize yields in the row nearest to the trees. High soil water values recorded during summer indicated that in the current cycle of good rainfall the plants in the agroforestry trial were not stressed. Thus the trees do not compete with the crops for soil moisture in good rainfall seasons. However, this study would need further evaluation for the competition for water for the low rainfall years. Since the trees have access to water at greater depths, they are likely to be more productive into the dry season than shallow rooted crops. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Changes in the relationship between soil erosion and N loss pathways after establishing soil conservation systems in uplands of Northeast Thailand
PY  - 2008
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-48949098587&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2008.06.002&partnerID=40&md5=be590be53d4303f93138dc2f55838dd7
AB  - Slow establishment of green barriers together with competition for nutrients and water between crops and contour hedges hamper their acceptance by rural communities in tropical mountainous regions. Alternatively, a combination of hedges/barriers and minimum tillage may shift the pathway of N losses from water erosion towards leaching. In Northeast Thailand, run-off, soil loss, N leaching (by resin cores) and crop response were monitored in grass barriers (Vetiveria zizanioides, Brachiaria ruziziensis) and hedgerow (Leucaena leucocephala) based soil conservation systems in fertilized/unfertilized treatments from their establishment in 2003 to 2005. In all treatments, maize was grown on a moderate slope gradient (21-28%) under minimum tillage conditions and relay cropped with a legume cover crop (Canavalia ensiformis). After 3 years, maize grain yields increased from 1.5 and 3.2 to 3.8 and 5.5 Mg ha-1 in the unfertilized and fertilized control plots. Over the same period, yield increases were lower for soil conservation treatments reaching yields of 2.0-2.7 Mg ha-1 without fertilizer and 3.9-4.2 Mg ha-1 with fertilizer. After 3 years, runoff (190-264 m3 ha-1) and soil loss (0.2-1 Mg ha-1) in fertilized plots with barriers showed an average decrease of 72% and 98%, respectively, compared to 2003, the reduction being lower in unfertilized plots. The control had a much higher soil loss in the first year (24.5 Mg ha-1), but also showed much reduced erosion (1.6-2.5 Mg ha-1) in the third year, partly due to reduced rainfall but also due to the combined effects of minimum tillage and surface mulch. Runoff, however, did not decrease on the control plots over the years in the same way as it did under soil conservation (runoff only after >12 mm day-1). Average cumulative N losses by runoff, soil loss and leaching were reduced from 55 kg N ha-1 in the control to 37-40 kg N ha-1 in the barrier treatments. The dominant N loss pathway shifted from above ground N losses to leaching with the establishment of barriers and hedges. Due to the positive maize yield development and partial control of soil loss, minimum tillage combined with legume relay cropping under the trial conditions indicates a potential alternative to contour barrier/hedgerow systems for soil conservation on moderate slopes in tropical mountainous regions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In a semiarid region of Zulia state, Venezuela, we studied the effect of five ages of the plant (42, 84, 126, and 168 days) on the levels of crude protein (CP), in vitro digestibility of organic matter (IVDOM) and mineral samples in the fine fraction (pinna, petioles and stems under 5 mm in diameter) of Leucaena leucocephala harvested in the dry season. The experimental design was random blocks with three replications. The IVDOM and content of CP fell significantly at 84 and 126 days, respectively, while maintained their values (P>0.01) at 168 days. The concentrations of minerals Ca, Mg, K, Fe, Mn, Se, Co, and Mo were found at appropriate levels, while P, Na, Cu, and Zn were below the critical level of impairment. Only Na increased (P<0.05) with increasing maturity, while Cu decreased its value. This pattern of digestibility and nutrient content of the OM displayed by L. leucocephala, regarding the maturity of the plant, evidence its massive potential as a resource fodder to be used as a food source in ruminants in the dry season, as it allows management in the use of the legume strategically, given its property to maintain nutritional quality within the optimum levels, without the age of the plant and the drought conditions affect it significantly. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - Superhydrophobic surfaces display water contact angles greater than 150° in conjunction with low contact angle hysteresis. Microscopic pockets of air trapped beneath the water droplets placed on these surfaces lead to a composite solid-liquid-air interface in thermodynamic equilibrium. Previous experimental and theoretical studies suggest that it may not be possible to form similar fully-equilibrated, composite interfaces with drops of liquids, such as alkanes or alcohols, that possess significantly lower surface tension than water (γlv = 72.1 mN/m). In this work we develop surfaces possessing re-entrant texture that can support strongly metastable composite solid-liquid-air interfaces, even with very low surface tension liquids such as pentane (γ/v 15.7 mN/m). Furthermore, we propose four design parameters that predict the measured contact angles for a liquid droplet on a textured surface, as well as the robustness of the composite interface, based on the properties of the solid surface and the contacting liquid. These design parameters allow us to produce two different families of re-entrant surfaces - randomly-deposited electrospun fiber mats and precisely fabricated microhoodoo surfaces - that can each support a robust composite interface with essentially any liquid. These omniphobic surfaces display contact angles greater than 150° and low contact angle hysteresis with both polar and nonpolar liquids possessing a wide range of surface tensions. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

AB  - With the advance of agriculture, there was consequent rising in environment degradation. Therefore, It is interesting the use of plants which have in their chemical composition substances capable of helping in the control of weeds to minimize the use of pesticides. Hence, the objective of this paper was to evaluate solutions of leucena extract on weeds that are frequent on soybean crop. The treatments were leucena extracts at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% at room temperature water and water heated to 80°C. The extracts were obtained by crushing 200g of leucena leaves and mixing them with one liter of distilled water with the help of a blender. Seeds were kept in B.O.D. at a temperature of 25°C, with a photoperiod of 12 hours of light. Evaluations were done on a daily basis, from the first to the last day of the experiment, varying according to the species. Results show a negative interference of the extracts, both hot and cold, in the root length of Ipomoea grandifolia, in the percentage of germination and in the root length of Arrowleaf sida and Hair beggarticks. There was no negative interference in the analyzed parameters for soybean seeds. Thus, the results indicate allelopatic potential of Leucaena leuucocephala as an alternative for the management of weeds without interfering on the development of the soybean crop.

AB  - As for some temperate forage, some tropical tanniniferous plants (TTP) from browsing might represent an alternative to chemical anthelmintic. The anthelmintic effect of four TTP (Acacia pennatula, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Piscidia piscipula, Leucaena leucocephala) on Haemonchus contortus was measured using two in vitro assays. First, the effects of increasing concentrations of lyophilized extracts (150, 300, 600, 1200 μg/ml PBS) were tested on H. contortus larvae (L3) using the larval migration inhibition (LMI) test. An inhibitor of tannin, polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (PVPP), was used to verify whether tannins were responsible for the AH effect. Secondly, the effects of extracts on larval exsheathment were examined. Larvae (L3) were in contact with extracts (1200 μg/ml) for 3 h, and then were exposed to an artificial exsheathment procedure with observations of the process at 10 min intervals. A general lineal model (GLM) test was used to determine the dose effect in the LMI test and the difference of the percentage of exsheathed larvae between the control and the treatment groups. A Kruskal Wallis test was used to determine the effect of PVPP on LMI results. The LMI test showed a dose-dependent anthelmintic effect for A. pennatula, L. latisiliquum and L. leucocephala (P < 0.01), which disappeared after PVPP addition, confirming the role of tannins. No effect was found for P. piscipula on H. contortus in the LMI test. However, all four plant extracts interfered with the process of L3 exsheathment which might be involved as a mechanism of action of tannins on H. contortus larvae. A. pennatula, L. latisiliquum and L. leucocephala could be used as an anthelmintic for the control of H. contortus after confirmation based on in vivo studies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Rumen degradability of Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala foliage in river buffaloes and Zebu bulls

AB  - The in situ rumen degradability of the foliage of the legume trees Gliricidia sepium (gliricidia) and Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena), commonly used in cattle rearing, was determined in river buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) and cattle (Bos indicus). Three buffaloes and three Zebu bulls were fitted with cannula in rumen for the analysis of degradability. They were fed ad libitum fresh star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) and protein supplementation with 1 kg of soybean cake. The nylon bags with 5 g of sample were incubated in rumen and removed at 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post fermentation. The foliages showed high potential of DM rumen degradation, higher than 80 % in gliricidia and than 77 % in leucaena. The soluble DM fraction, determined by washing the bags was of19.49 and 22.33 % for both foliages, respectively. There was breed x type of foliage interaction (P < 0.05) for the fraction potentially degradable in time (B), the rate of degradation (c), and the potential DM degradability (A+B). The A+B fraction of nitrogen in gliricidia was around 94 % in buffaloes, whereas in the Zebu cattle, it was lower (P < 0.05) in 5 percent units. The results indicated that the in situ rumen degradability of the tree foliages is not necessarily similar in buffaloes as in cattle. Thus, care should be paid when extrapolating results from one species to the other. Both plants had high rumen degradability, thus, their use in ruminant feeding systems is recommended.

AB  - The objective of this work was to determine the changes on the intake behavior of ovines when modifying the initial high of grazing of Leucaena leucocephala. The statistical analysis was an analysis of variance using x2 with test of Kruskal-Wallis, for which 10 females of the Pelibuey breed were used and the initial heigh of the treatments were T1 60, T2 100, T3 140, and T4 180 cm. Before and after grazing, biomass both total and in layers of height 0-60, 60 - 100, 100 -140, and 140 - 180 cm were taken. Grazing lasted 4 h per day (from 9:00 to 13:00 h). The activity of the animals was registered and how they consumed the plant, by direct vision for each individual every 10 min. The results showed significant differences (P<0.05) for utilization, time dedicated to the consumption of the legumes, and position of the head to consume plant. An inverse relation was obtained for utilization and initial height, with a decrease in the utilization of 93.2% for T1 to 35.9% for T4, with a similar behavior among layers. The position of the head varied, depending on the availability of the foliage and height.

TI  - First-year biomass production and soil improvement in Leucaena and Robinia stands under different pollarding systems

AB  - The study of biomass production and soil improvement of two fast growing and multipurpose trees, Leucaena leucocephala and Robinia pseudoacacia, was carried out in Mosul Forest, northern Iraq, to examine the impact of pollarding height (0, 15, 30 and 45 cm) and frequency (no pollarding, pollarding every three or six months) on growth responses and soil properties. These species are being studied as part of a larger research programme to develop novel agroforestry systems in Iraq. Leucaena leucocephala showed the greatest response in terms of branching, shoot basal diameter, height, biomass and nitrogen and phosphorus contents of leaves and stems with pollarding every three months at 15 cm. For R. pseudoacacia, pollarding once after six months at 45 cm resulted in the greatest growth response of leaves and stems. Physical soil properties such as bulk density, infiltration rate and chemical properties such as pH, total soil organic matter and nitrogen, available potassium and phosphorus were all improved under L. leucocephala and R. pseudoacacia. Management of these trees in Iraq for soil improvement or in agroforestry systems with different crops such as wheat, barley, corn and cotton should take into consideration optimal pollarding frequency and height as well as planting density to produce the desired levels of shade, soil cover and green manure, as well as animal fodder or wood products.

TI  - Effect of muddy conditions in the field on the liveweight gain of cattle consuming Leucaena leucocephala-Digitaria eriantha pastures in north-west Australia

AB  - Cattle grazing leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham)-pangola grass (Digitaria eriantha cv. Steudel) pastures in the Ord River Irrigation Area in north-west Western Australia, sometimes exhibit higher liveweight gains in the dry season when temperature and humidity are lower. Two factors have been suggested as causing this seasonal difference: the combined effect of the temperature and humidity, and the effect of the muddy conditions in the field associated with rainfall in the wet summer season. An experiment over 81 days, from August to October 1995, was conducted to evaluate the effect of muddy conditions on the liveweight gain of cattle grazing a leucaena-pangola grass pasture. Replicated paddocks were grazed in a normal irrigated system during this dry season whereas other paddocks were flood irrigated twice weekly to create muddy conditions. Cattle grazing the muddy paddocks had a liveweight gain of 0.29 kg/steer.day, which was lower (P < 0.001) than the animals in the dry paddocks (0.57 kg/steer.day). These cattle spent less time grazing (41.9 v. 67.6% of animals grazing at three observation times, 0600, 1100 and 1500 hours, on each day over the whole 81 days; P ≤ 0.001). It was suggested that the muddy condition of the paddock was the primary factor causing this difference in liveweight gain and grazing behaviour. © CSIRO 2008.

AB  - In vivo ileal nutrient digestibility of five tropical foliages was determined in 72 New Zealand x California rabbits (45 days age) fed with diets containing 30% of forage from either leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), trichanthera (Trichanthera gigantea), mulberry (Morus alba), peanut forage (Arachis pintoi) or sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). A completely randomized experimental design was used with six treatments and 12 repetitions. The treatments were conformed by the control diet and those that contained the five test foliages. In vivo ileal nutrient digestibility indices were determined by an indirect method that uses acid-insoluble ash as inner marker. There was not significant effect of the treatment on the dry matter, ash and organic matter ileal digestibility. However, ileal digestibility of protein in the diet with leucaena was significantly lower (P≤0.01) than in the basal diet. In this index, the rest of diets containing the other four tropical forages showed intermediary values, ranging from 37.8% for trichanthera to 50.2% for peanut forage. The dry matter, ash, organic matter and raw protein ileal digestibility of the evaluated forages were similar (P>0.05). The ileal digestibility determination in the diets and forages and the estimate of the caecal degradation, allowed to evidence that the proportion of cecal dry matter disappearance in leucaena and mulberry foliage was highest. The inclusion of leucaena, trichanthera, mulberry and peanut foliage did not cause substantial changes in ileal digestibility indexes in rabbits fed with those diets.

AB  - On a Humic Gley soil of the hydromorphic group, the degree of adaptation of five accessions and a cultivar of leucaena during the establishment and exploitation period was determined. Plant vigor, cover, leafiness, lesions produced by pests, and symptoms caused by diseases were estimated. To obtain the degree of similarity among the accessions during the establishment, a cluster analysis was used and to compare this material during the exploitation period, an ANOVA was used by means of a completely randomized design. According to the degree of contribution of the indicators to the formation of the groups, it was possible to determine that the Cunningham cultivar was the most outstanding accession. This accession was also significantly higher in terms of leafiness, cover, and vigor in the period of exploitation. The divergence among these accessions was concluded to be evident, which reveals the high specificity index. It is recommended to study further the aspects regarding the performance of L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham under grazing-browsing conditions in this particular environment. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

TI  - Planted legume fallows reduce weeds and increase soil N and P contents but not upland rice yields

AB  - Shortened fallows have resulted in declining upland rice yields in slash-and-burn upland rice systems in northern Laos. We studied the benefit of planted legume fallows for rice productivity, weeds, and soil nitrogen and phosphorus availability. Four systems were evaluated over a 5-year period: 1-year fallow with native species, 1-year Cajanus cajan fallow, 1-year Leucaena leucocephala fallow, and continuous annual rice cropping. Rice was grown either once each year as continuous annual cropping or in alternate years of 2001, 2003, and 2005. C. cajan and L. leucocephala were sown with rice during the 2001 growing season. In subsequent years, L. leucocephala regenerated from root stock and did not have to be resown, whereas C. cajan was resown in 2003. Establishment of either C. cajan or L. leucocephala had no significant effect on rice yield in 2001, and rice yields ranged from 2.0 to 2.3 t/ha. Rice yields declined rapidly in succeeding years, and rice yields in the four systems ranged from 0.7 to 1.1 t/ha in 2003 and from 0.3 to 0.5 t/ha in 2005. Although two planted fallow systems increased nitrogen input because of greater biomass accumulation in 2003 and 2005 and soil phosphorus availability was higher following L. leucocephala fallow in 2005, there were no significant differences in rice yields among the four systems in either year. Weed biomass during the rice growing season increased each year in all systems and increased more rapidly for continuous annual rice cropping, in which the dominant weed species was Ageratum conyzoides L. Among the other three systems, there were no significant differences in the weed biomass in 2003 and 2005. We conclude that C. cajan and L. leucocephala as 1-year fallows do not offset the negative effects of increased cropping intensity on rice yield in this region. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Six metabolism trials were conducted using four male goats (local nondescript breed; BW 13.5 kg) in a crossover design to study the supplementary feeding value of fresh foliage of subabul (Leucaena leucocephala), sesbania (Sesbania grandiflora), acacia (Acacia auriculiformis), jack (Artocarpus heterophyllus), yellow gold mohur (Peltophorum ferrugineum) and cashew (Anacardium occidentale). Respective foliages were supplemented @ 300 g/head/day to goats fed ad libitum quantity of Napier Bajra green fodder as basal feed. The crude protein content of NB green fodder, subabul, sesbania, acacia, jack, yellow gold mohur and cashew were, respectively, 10.38, 21.31, 34.44, 15.94, 12.82, 12.69 and 9.69 per cent. Total DM intake (g/day) of goats was 380, 444, 459, 477, 424 and 352, respectively, for the six experimental diets. Digestibility of DM and OM were enhanced (P<0.05) in goats fed on all the tree foliage-supplemented diets, except for that supplemented with cashew leaves. Greatest depression was observed in the digestibility of NDF (38.32%) and ADF (23.86%) when goats were fed on cashew (P<0.05), followed by yellow gold mohur, and jack as supplementary feeds. Based on nitrogen and calcium retention and nutrient intake data, it was concluded that sesbania, subabul, jack and acacia foliage were better than yellow gold mohur and cashew in their supplementary role.

AB  - With the objective of evaluating the effect of the inclusion of foliage of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) on the growth and some biochemical indicators in Cuban Pelibuey sheep during the first 60 days of nursing 36 uniformed sheep was used according to its live weight to the beginning of the reproductive campaign (26.72, 27.40, 27.12, and 26.80 kg). A complete randomized design was used where the animals were assigned to four treatments with 9 animals each one where received different quantities of leucaena: Treatment 1: 1.5 kg/anim/d. Treatment 2: 1.25 kg/anim/d. Treatment 3: 1.0 kg/anim/d. Treatment 4: Control without leucaena. All treatments received ad libitum mineral salt, 0.2 kg of honey-urea at 2%, as well 8 h of grazing. The statistical analysis was carried out by means of an analysis of variance of simple classification. There were determined monthly live weight, corporal condition, and the following biochemical indicators: haemoglobin, glucose, total proteins, albumin, and urea. It was concluded that sheep in treatments 1 and 2 achieved, at 60 days of nursing, higher live weight than those of first time of gestation (36.47 and 33.67 kg), corporal condition above 3, and sanguine indicators within the physiological range for the species. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - The space disposition of the nests of cut ants (Atta insularis) was studied in a silvopastoral system of Lecucaena leucocephala and Panicum maximum. The leucaena plants were sown between 1995 and 1997. The samplings were made in nine paddocks of this system between January and July in 2007. In the grassland, there were subtypes of typical Red Ferrallitic soil, the oxisol and hydrated or the ultisol. The paddocks were subdivided in 56 paddocks of 100 m2. In these subdivisions, the number and distribution of the insect nests, the leucaena plants, and other shrubs were recorded. The variance/mean and Taylor indices were used to know the type of distribution of the nests. The factorial multivariated analysis was applied by multiple correspondences, as well as the Mann Whitney and Friedman tests to determine the effect of the soil, the trees and the paddocks in the leaf-cutting ants nests. The space distribution was of the aggregated type (ID=6.25, a=3.79 and b=1.42) with 99 nests ha-1. The highest concurrence of nests (125 nests ha-1, P < 0.05) of leucaena (679 plants ha-1, P < 0.001) and other trees (22 plants ha-1, P < 0.05) took place in the hydrated red ferrallitic soil. The paddocks with this soil, sown in 1996, coincided with being the highest number of nests and of plants per hectare. It is concluded that the nests of A. insularis showed an aggregated space distribution. The soil and the tree plants affected the space distribution of the bibijagua nests in the leucaena-Guinea grass silvopastoral system.

AB  - Leaves of Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) (CLM), Sesbania (Sesbania grandiflora) (SG), Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) (LL), Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) (GS) and Water hyacinth (Eichorniacrassipes) (WH) were subjected to heating at 60 (control), 100 or 140°C for 2 hours. The experimental treatments were laid out in a 5x3 factorial arrangement with 3 replications. The protein fractions of the leaves were estimated using The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) model. Heating the leaves to temperatures of 140°C for 2 hours reduced the proportion of the protein in the A (NPN) and B2 (some fraction B2 escapes to the lower gut) fractions and increased the B3 (slowly rumen degradable fraction). The highest value for the B3 fraction was in water hyacinth (44% of the total crude protein) while in the other leave it was less than 10%. By contrast, the B2 fraction was low in water hyacinth (less than 20%) and high in the other leaves and especially in cassava leaf meal where it accounted for 66% of the total crude protein. The implication from these findings is that the B2 fraction may be a better indicator of the probable bypass protein value of leaves than the B3 fraction.

AB  - Faecal nutrient digestibility of five tropical foliages was determined in 72 New Zealand x California fattening rabbits of 45 days old fed diets containing forage from either Leucaena leucocephala, Trichanthera gigantea, Morus alba, Arachis pintoi or Ipomoea batatas. Nutrient digestibility indices were determined by a direct method (total collection). There were differences (P<0.01) for the organic matter digestibility (45.41, 37.38, 60.51, 48.25 and 37.58%), content of digestible energy (2092, 1860, 2378, 1981 and 1388 kcal/kg) and digestible protein (14.97, 12.49, 12.79, 13.90 and 6.74 g/kg) for L. leucocephala, T. gigantea, M. alba, A. pintoi and I. batatas, respectively. Overall, diets containing mulberry foliage or sweet potato forage determined the highest and lowest values for faecal digestibility, respectively. The content of energy digestible and protein digestible, and the digestibility of nutriments in L leucocephala, T. gigantea, M. alba and A. pintoi foliage allow to suggest that they present an interesting nutritious potential and constitute usable ingredients in rabbits diets formulation.

AB  - The tree-legume Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is used as a perennial fodder because of its fast-growing foliage, which is high in protein content. The use of leucaena as a fodder is however restricted due to the presence of the toxin mimosine. Improvements in the nutritional contents as well as other agronomic traits of leucaena can be accomplished through genetic transformation. The objective of this research was to develop a transformation protocol for leucaena using phosphinothricin resistance as the plant selectable marker. Explants obtained from immature zygotic embryos infected with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 containing the binary plasmid pCAMBIA3201 produced four putative transformed leucaena plants. Transformation was confirmed by PCR, RT-PCR, Southern blot, Western analyses, GUS-specific enzyme activity and herbicide leaf spraying assay. A transformation efficiency of 2% was established using this protocol. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - A study of the skin diseases in sheep and goats in the semiarid of the states of Paraíba, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte, Northeastern Brazil was performed. From January 2000 to November 2006, 656 cases in goats and 324 in sheep were presented to the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Campina Grande in Patos, Paraíba. Additionally mailed in biopsy or necropsy skin samples from 31 goats and 45 sheep were studied histologically. Skin diseases were diagnosed in 35 goats (5.33% of all cases in this species) and 45 sheep (13.88% of the cases in this species). The most frequent skin disease was myiasis (10 cases in goats and 7 in sheep), followed by contagious echtyma (8 cases in goats and 2 in sheep), squamous cell carcinoma (4 cases in goats and 5 in sheep), dermatophylosis (8 cases in sheep), and allergic dermatitis (1 case in goats and 1 in sheep). Two cases of pythiosis in sheep, two cases of epidermolysis bullosa in goats, one case of poisoning by Brachiaria brizantha (photosensitization) and another by Leucaena leucocephala (alopecia) in sheep, and one case of papillomatosis, one of pemphigus foliaceous, one of protothecosis and one of rhabdomyosarcoma in goats were also diagnosed. In 4 cases in sheep and 19 in goats the etiologic diagnosis was not obtained. With the information of the occurrence and epidemiology of the skin diseases is possible to determine efficient control measures. © 2009 Colégio Brasileiro de Patologia Animal.

AB  - We report the fabrication of a new superhydrophobic surface with dual-scale roughness by coating silica nanoparticles on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomer bilayer film with micro-scaled ripples. The wetting behavior of the surface can be reversibly tuned by applying a mechanical strain, which induces the change in micro-scale roughness determined by the ripples. The dual-scale roughness promotes the wetting transition of the final dual-structure surface from Wenzel region into the Cassie region, thus, reducing the sliding angle at least three times in comparison to that from the surfaces with single-scale roughness (either from the nanoparticle film or the wrinkled PDMS film). In addition, three-times and fast-response tunability of the sliding angle by applying mechanical strain on this dual-roughness surface is demonstrated. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009.

AB  - This research was to evaluate the effect of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in diets for bovines on ruminal metabolism, including pH, volatile fatty acids, and ammonia and methane production. Four crossbred male cattle (800 kg LW) rumen cannulated were distributed to a 4 x 4 Latin Square design, in 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, composed by two levels of Leucaena (20% and 50% DM) and coast-cross grass hay, with or without yeast. No differences were observed in rumen pH (mean 6.82) and ammonia concentrations that varied from 18.71 to 21.28 mg/100 mL of ruminal fluid. There was interaction between Leucaena levels and yeast in the total concentrations of VFA. No differences were observed in the concentrations of acetic acid, but the animals fed 50% of Leucaena with yeast showed higher propionic acid concentration (19.14 mM). Methane emissions were reduced by 12.3% in relation to the same diet without yeast and in 17.2% when the animals were fed 20% of Leucaena with yeast. There was a noticeable associative effect of Leucaena when fed in high level (50% DM) and yeast in the reduction of methane emission and better rumen fermentation with possible reduction of energy loss and better energy efficiency for the animals. © 2008 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia.

AB  - Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) caused by African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and East African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus (EACMCV) is the major constraint to cassava production in Nigeria. Sequences of the DNA-A component of ACMV and EACMCV isolates from leguminous plant species (Senna occidentalis, Leucana leucocephala and Glycine max), castor oil plant (Ricinus communis), a weed host (Combretum confertum) and a wild species of cassava (Manihot glaziovii) were determined. All ACMV isolates from these hosts showed 96-98% nucleotide sequence identity with cassava isolates from West Africa. EACMCV was found only in four hosts (S. occidentalis, L. leucocephala, C. confertum, M. glaziovii), and sequences of these isolates showed 96-99% identity with cassava isolates from West Africa. These results provide definitive evidence for the natural occurrence of ACMV and EACMCV in plant species besides cassava. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The surface shape, structure, biomaterial and wettability of moth wings (10 NOCTUIDAE species) from the northeast region of China were qualitatively and quantitatively studied by means of a stereoscopic microscope, a scanning electronic microscope, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR) and the interface contact angle measurement. The observation shows that there are scales arranged like overlapping tiles on the surface of the moth wings. The shapes of the scales are different between species. They overlap horizontally and there is particular space vertically in the direction of the wing veins. The surface of the scale is structured by micron-class grooves and nanometer-class vertical gibbosities. The biomaterial components of the moth wing scale are mostly made up of protein, lipids and chitin. The observation also shows that the contact angle for wings with scales is in the range from 144.8° to 152.9°, while that for those without scales is from 90.0° to 115.9°. It indicates that the surfaces of the wings with scales are more hydrophobic. According as Cassie model, the equation of wettability on the NOCTUIDAE moth wing surface is established and the hydrophobic mechanism is analyzed. It is concluded that the hydrophobicity of the moth wings is induced by the multivariate coupling of the shape, structures and biomaterial of the scales. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

TI  - Diversity of methanogens in ruminants in Queensland
PY  - 2008

AB  - Methane emissions from ruminant livestock represent a loss of carbon during feed conversion, which has implications for both animal productivity and the environment because this gas is considered to be one of the more potent forms of greenhouses gases contributing to global warming. Many strategies to reduce emissions are targeting the methanogens that inhabit the rumen, but such an approach can only be successful if it targets all the major groups of ruminant methanogens. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of the diversity of these microbes in different breeds of cattle and sheep, as well as in response to different diets, is required. A study was undertaken using the molecular techniques denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, DNA cloning and DNA sequence analysis to define the extent of diversity among methanogens in ruminants, particularly Bos indicus cross cattle, on differing forages in Queensland. It was found that the diversity of methanogens in forage-fed cattle in Queensland was greater than in grain-fed cattle but there was little variability in methanogen community composition between cattle fed different forages. The species that dominate the rumen microbial communities of B. indicus cross cattle are from the genus Methanobrevibacter, although rumen-fluid inoculated digestors fed Leucaena leucocephala leaf were populated with Methanosphaera-like strains, with the Methanobrevibacter-like strains displaced. If ruminant methane emissions are to be reduced, then antimethanogen bioactives that target both broad groups of ruminant methanogens are most likely to be needed, and as a part of an integrated suite of approaches that redirect rumen fermentation towards other more useful end products. © CSIRO 2008.

AB  - In Sudan, tree plantations remain the first choice and are widely used in protecting arable lands from sand movement. Decomposition and nutrient changes from leaves of some agroforestry trees (Eucalyptus microtheca, Ficus spp., and Leucaena leucocephala) and litter fall from guava (Psidium guajava) and mango (Magnifera indica) were monitored (in a 12-week litter-bag experiment). Rate of dry-matter weight loss from guava (0.098 wk-1) was significantly (P < 0.01) faster than from mango residues (0.04 wk-1). Corresponding values for Leucaena, Eucalyptus, and Ficus were 0.0533, 0.0524, and 0.0438 wk-1, respectively. In general, micronutrients tend to accummulate during a decomposition period. Potassium (K) was the only element found to be consistently lost by leaching very rapidly from all litters. Nitrogen (N) was released at a significantly (P < 0.03) higher rate from Leucaena (0.0558 wk-1) compared to Ficus (0.0399 wk-1) and Eucalyptus (0.0301 wk-1). Mobility of nutrients from the litters was in the order of K > phosphorus (P) = N > calcium (Ca) > magnesium (Mg). It is concluded that ficus and mango leaves are suitable for improving quality of arid soils through buildup of soil organic matter and supplying easily released organic sulfur (S) (environmentally sound management practice) whereas litter from guava is suitable for temporary nutrient correction. Mixing of guava and mango residues may slow fast decomposition of the former. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Diet quality and liveweight gain of steers grazing Leucaena-grass pasture estimated with faecal near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (F.NIRS)
PY  - 2008
UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-45849121321&doi=10.1071%2fEA08007&partnerID=40&md5=1e43d0e13a94120ac9959e866b7bbbfb
AB  - Three drafts of Bos indicus cross steers (initially 178-216 kg) grazed Leucaena-grass pasture [Leucaena leucocephala subspecies glabrata cv. Cunningham with green panic (Panicum maximum cv. trichoglume)] from late winter through to autumn during three consecutive years in the Burnett region of south-east Queensland. Measured daily weight gain (DWGActual) of the steers was generally 0.7-1.1 kg/day during the summer months. Estimated intakes of metabolisable energy and dry matter (DM) were calculated from feeding standards as the intakes required by the steers to grow at the DWGActual. Diet attributes were predicted from near infrared reflectance spectroscopy spectra of faeces (F.NIRS) using established calibration equations appropriate for northern Australian forages. Inclusion of some additional reference samples from cattle consuming Leucaena diets into F.NIRS calibrations based on grass and herbaceous legume-grass pastures improved prediction of the proportion of Leucaena in the diet. Mahalanobis distance values supported the hypothesis that the F.NIRS predictions of diet crude protein concentration and DM digestibility (DMD) were acceptable. F.NIRS indicated that the percentage of Leucaena in the diet varied widely (10-99%). Diet crude protein concentration and DMD were usually high, averaging 12.4 and 62%, respectively, and were related asymptotically to the percentage of Leucaena in the diet (R2 = 0.48 and 0.33, respectively). F.NIRS calibrations for DWG were not satisfactory to predict this variable from an individual faecal sample since the s.e. of prediction were 0.33-0.40 kg/day. Cumulative steer liveweight (LW) predicted from F.NIRS DWG calibrations, which had been previously developed with tropical grass and grass-herbaceous legume pastures, greatly overestimated the measured steer LW; therefore, these calibrations were not useful. Cumulative steer LW predicted from a modified F.NIRS DWG calibration, which included data from the present study, was strongly correlated (R2 = 0.95) with steer LW but overestimated LW by 19-31 kg after 8 months. Additional reference data are needed to develop robust F.NIRS calibrations to encompass the diversity of Leucaena pastures of northern Australia. In conclusion, the experiment demonstrated that F.NIRS could improve understanding of diet quality and nutrient intake of cattle grazing Leucaena-grass pasture, and the relationships between nutrient supply and cattle growth. © CSIRO 2008.

AB  - Preference by cattle, sheep and goats for twelve foliage species (Chlorophora tinctoria, Morus alba, Pithecellobium pedicellare, Gliricidia sepium, Guazuma ulmifolia, Cordia alba, Trichantera gigantea, Tithonia diversifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa oleifera, Azadirachta indica, and Samanea saman) in Trujillo state, Venezuela were evaluated. Chemical composition (CP, GE, NDF, total polyphenols, condensed tannins, tannins precipitating proteins, and total terpenoids), ruminal degradability, and intake measurements were determined using a latin square design with evaluation period of twelve days. The preferences of cattle with sheep and sheep with goats were related. No relationships of cattle and sheep intake with chemical composition of the offer were found. However, significant differences in the majority of nutritional variable were observed. Goats preferred the foliage with smaller NDF content and low total polyphenols concentration. C. tinctoria, M. alba and P. pedicellare, followed by G. ulmifolia and C. alba foliage presented the best potentialities. The results showed the importance of preference assay for the selection of species with fodder potential for ruminant production systems. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - Fur condition in wild ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, was recorded during September-November birth seasons 2001-2006 at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar. Body coat condition was scored on a scale from BS 0: full, smooth coat with guard hairs, to BS5: half or more of back and limbs hairless. Tail condition was scored from TS 0: full, to TS 5: half or more hairless. Where troop core areas included stands of Leucaena leucocephala, alopecia was dramatically more frequent than in similar areas without leucaena, including many animals with score BS5 or TS5, "bald lemur syndrome." Female coats were worse than males,' possibly related to female dominance and access to this preferred food. Tails in non-leucaena-feeding females tend to remain full, even if coats deteriorate, but with leucaena-feeding female tails are highly correlated with coat condition and equally bare. Coat and tail condition in L. catta reflected not only the dietary toxin but individual differences as well as differences between adjacent troops that may result from territorially mediated access to the environment. Leucaena contains the non-protein amino acid mimosine, a known cause of alopecia, wasting, and organ damage in livestock, although the effects are usually reversible. This is the first case of its effect in wildlife. Leucaena is an agroforestry tree introduced throughout the tropics. In high dietary concentrations leucaena might potentially affect any browsing mammal. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Soil amendment with organic materials (crop residues animal manure, and green manure) reportedly has positive effects on soil properties, from acidity to plant-nutrient availability. To examine that hypothesis, an incubation study was conducted to assess the changes in some chemical properties of three different tropical soils (Andisol, Ultisol, and Oxisol) amended with chicken manure and green manure (Leucaena leucocephala) at the rate of 10 t ha-1. The results showed that organic amendments raised soil pH and EC, regardless of the type of manure used. Manuring lowered the concentrations of Mehlich-3 extractable Ca, P, Mn and Si in all soils and decreased the concentration of Mg in the Ultisol and Oxisol. However, manure amendment led to increases in the concentrations of Mg and K in the Andisol. Organic amendments caused a decrease in KCl extractable Al. Initial soluble C levels were highest in the Oxisol (60 μmol g-1) and lowest in the Andisol (20 μmol g-1). The concentration of soluble C decreased exponentially with duration of incubation. Three low molecular weight organic molecules (acetic acid, catechol and oxalic acid) out of the eight tested were found in all manure-amended soils. This study quantified the release of some Al chelating organic acids, the reduction of exchangeable Al, and the changes in major plant-nutrients when organic materials were added to nutrient poor, tropical acid soils. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A sustainable management of soils with low natural fertility on family farms in the humid tropics is a great challenge and overcoming it would be an enormous benefit for the environment and the farmers. The objective of this study was to assess the environmental and agronomic benefits of alley cropping, based on the evaluation of C sequestration, soil quality indicators, and corn yields. Combinations of four legumes were used in alley cropping systems in the following treatments: Clitoria fairchildiana + Cajanus cajan; Acacia mangium + Cajanus cajan; Leucaena leucocephala + Cajanus cajan; Clitoria fairchildiana + Leucaena leucocephala; Leucaena leucocephala + Acacia mangium and a control. Corn was used as a cash crop. The C content was determined in the different compartments of soil organic matter, CEC, available P, base saturation, percentage of water saturation, the period of the root hospitality factor below the critical level and corn yield. It was concluded that alley cropping could substitute the slash and burn system in the humid tropics. The main environmental benefit of alley cropping is the maintenance of a dynamic equilibrium between C input and output that could sustain up to 10 Mg ha-1 of C in the litter layer, decreasing atmospheric CO2 levels. Alley cropping is also beneficial from the agricultural point of view, because it increases base saturation and decreases physical resistance to root penetration in the soil layer 0 - 10 cm, which ensures the increase and sustainability of corn yield.

AB  - Though irrigation with sewage water has potential benefits of meeting the water requirements, the sewage irrigation may mess up to harm the soil health. To assess the potential impacts of long-term sewage irrigation on soil health and to identify sensitive soil indicators, soil samples were collected from crop fields that have been irrigated with sewage water for more than 20 years. An adjacent rain-fed Leucaena leucocephala plantation system was used as a reference to compare the impact of sewage irrigation on soil qualities. Soils were analyzed for different physical, chemical, biological and biochemical parameters. Results have shown that use of sewage for irrigation improved the clay content to 18-22.7%, organic carbon to 0.51-0.86% and fertility status of soils. Build up in total N was up to 2,713 kg ha-1, available N (397 kg ha-1), available P (128 kg ha-1), available K (524 kg ha-1) and available S (65.5 kg ha-1) in the surface (0.15 m) soil. Long-term sewage irrigation has also resulted a significant build-up of DTPA extractable Zn (314%), Cu (102%), Fe (715%), Mn (197.2), Cd (203%), Ni (1358%) and Pb (15.2%) when compared with the adjacent rain-fed reference soil. Soils irrigated with sewage exhibited a significant decrease in microbial biomass carbon (-78.2%), soil respiration (-82.3%), phosphatase activity (-59.12%) and dehydrogenase activity (-59.4%). An attempt was also made to identify the sensitive soil indicators under sewage irrigation, where microbial biomass carbon was singled out as the most sensitive indicator. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The experiment was conducted at the UFRRJ and the seed laboratory of PESAGRO-RIO, Seropédica, RJ, Brazil, in order to evaluate the germination of seeds in bovine dung, in field. The legumes used were: Leucaena leucocephala, Clitorea ternatea, Calopogonium mucunoides, Neonotonia wightii and Macrotyloma axillare. Seed administration was carried out through esophagic sounding (200 seeds/animal) of only one specie. The droppings were collected at 6 hours intervals up to 48 hours after ingestion. Feces were placed in plots of 50 × 70 cm of Paspalum notatum. Germinated seeds were counted at 30, 60 and 90 days. The experimental design employed was completely randomised, being 5 treatments (species) with 4 repetitions. The highest germination rate was found in Clitorea ternatea, as approximately 19% from the ingested seeds germinated in the dung. The highest germinated seeds concentration was found at 18 to 24 hrs with 29.56% followed by 24 to 30 hrs with 20.44%, remembering what 100% is equal 102 plants. The results of this study suggests as the bovine can be used for practical and low cost introduction of legumes for improving or recuperation of pastures in Brazil.

AB  - Forty-two percent of the land area in the neighbouring districts (kapubatens) of Wonogiri, Central Java and Ponorogo in East Java is covered with secondary forests of naturalized exotic tree species that are common components of governmental land rehabilitation programs. The seed suppliers operating in the Wonogiri-Ponorogo area represent only 9% of the suppliers in Indonesia yet they account for 80-90% of the national tree seed supply capacity. Wonogiri-Ponorogo suppliers procure and sell 1,510 tons of seed annually. About 24% of this (362 tons) is exchanged between suppliers, 1,148 tons are sold to customers across Indonesia, and less than 1 ton is exported. About 72% of the seed sold (826 tons) is collected in the Wonogiri-Ponorogo area, the remainder originating in Sumatra, Madura and Nusa Tenggara. In Wonogiri-Ponorogo, tree seeds are collected by farmers on contract with seed assemblers or seed companies. Assemblers link farmer collectors with seed companies and middlemen, who sell seed to customers. Government agencies purchase 75% of the seed. Cover crop species, Gmelina arborea, Tectona grandis and Leucaena leucocephala account for the 85% of the total seed sold. The sheer volume of seed collected in Wonogiri-Ponorogo assures that it comes from a large number of unrelated trees over widely dispersed locations. However, research results indicate individual farmers collect seed from a limited number of adjacent trees. Experience indicates simple seed collection guidelines help farmers improve their seed collection practices and the genetic quality of seed collected. A commitment to seed quality by all agents involved in the seed trade and customers is required to make such guidelines functional and acceptable. Seed procurement and diffusion generate significant income for all seed agents. As the dominant agents who facilitate most of the activities and inputs required to move seed through the pathway from forests to customers, seed companies receive the most financial benefits. Farmer seed collectors are the most numerous agents in the seed pathway, with an estimated 22,500 farmers involved in seed collection activities annually. Farmer families living near seed companies earn additional income by processing seed. © Steve Harrison, John Herbohn 2008.

AB  - The Hawaiian Islands hold a unique geographic position that has resulted in plant species with remarkable evolutionary adaptations to island life as well as the highest proportion of plant endemism (90%) in the world. Polynesians and Europeans significantly reduced the extent of native vegetation types, and Europeans introduced non-native plants that have become highly invasive. The Hawaiian Islands have been extremely susceptible to invasion due to the fact that they are oceanic islands; they contain low intensities of competition; they have altered disturbance regimes; and a relatively short time has passed since non-native plant introductions, suggesting that the situation can only get worse. African grasses, Leucaena leucocephala, Psidium sp., Miconia calvescens, and Schinus terebinthifolius, are some of the most aggressive invasive plant species in the Hawaiian Islands. Species databases, remote sensing methods, and geographic information system analyses are currently being developed and will be extremely important for identifying the extent and threat of invasive plants. The three main methods of invasive plant removal include manual/mechanical removal, herbicide application, and biological controls. A number of federal, state, and non-profit organizations are involved with the management of invasive plant species in the Hawaiian Islands. However, much more attention must be paid to protecting some of the most unique and endangered ecosystems on the planet. © 2008 The Authors. Journal Compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - With the objective of determining the accumulation and decomposition of litter and the relationship of these processes with some biotic and abiotic factors present in a pasure of guinea grass, Panicum maximum cv. Likoni, and in a silvopastoral system of Panicum maximum and leucaena, Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham, were carried out at the Experimental Station "Indio Hatuey", Matanzas, Cuba. The results showed that the pasture of P. maximum accumulated 2.66 t DM/ha/yr, while the silvopastoral system produced 12.49 t DM/ha/yr, where L. leucocephala contributed with 75.6% of the total litter. Each pasture showed a different decomposition pattern of the litter. Among the species present, the rate varied in the following order: leucaena higher than guinea grass in the silvopastoral system, and the later higher than pasture of guinea grass. The highest values of density and biomass of individuals, the predominance of oligochaeta, as well as the best indexes of diversity, richness, and uniformity in the silvopastoral system indicated that the presence of leucaena in the grassland allowed enhancing the biological activity of the soil and guaranteeing the stability of the system. © 2009 Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas INIA.

AB  - Fifteen intact male goats of Jamunapari breeds, 12-15 months old weighing 22.0 kg were divided into three groups of five animals in each in a completely randomized design to determine the effect of feeding Leucaena leucocephala leaves and twigs (LLLT) on heat production (HP) and energy balance (EB). Animals in treatment I (Control) was supplied with a conventional ration consisting of a concentrate mixture and vegetative parts of Zea mays and in treatments II and III received similar rations except that LLLT provided about 0.40 and 0.50 parts crude protein (CP) of total protein in ration, respectively by replacing 0.50 and 1.00 parts each of the solvent extracted groundnut cake and wheat bran in the concentrate mixture, respectively. The dry matter (DM) supplemented through LLLT was 0, 121 and 224 g in treatments I, II and III, respectively and it corresponds to 0, 0.19 and 0.34 parts of total DM intake. Supplementation of increasing amount of LLLT did not affect (P=0.303) DM intake but digestibility of DM decreased (P=0.002) linearly. The digestible energy (DE) intake was not affected (P=0.161) due to supplementation of LLLT. Urinary energy (UE) loss per kg metabolic body size per day and as proportion of gross energy (GE) or DE intake increased (P<0.001) linearly with increased LLLT supplementation. Average methane production varied from 15.2 to 17.3 L/d. Methane energy loss per kg metabolic body size per day decreased (P=0.024) linearly with increased supplementation of LLLT, however, as proportion of GE or DE did not show any effect of treatment. Metabolizable energy (ME) intake per kg metabolic body size per day was unaffected (P=0.113) by the treatments which corresponded to 1.63, 1.35 and 1.38 times of maintenance in treatments I, II and III, respectively indicated that animals were in well-fed condition. Heat production (HP) and energy balance (EB) were not affected by the supplementation treatment. It is concluded that supplementation of 224 g of LLLT in the diet of goats, which provided DM at a proportion of 0.34 or CP at a proportion of 0.59, did not affect HP and EB. © 2007.

TI  - Evaluation of tropical tree leaves as ruminant feedstuff based on cell contents, cell wall fractions and polyphenolic compounds
PY  - 2008

AB  - Seven tropical tree leaves were analysed for proximate principles, cell wall fractions on organic matter basis, protein content of NDF and ADF, .non-fibre carbohydrates, calcium and phosphorus, total phenolics, total tannins, condensed tannins and B3 slowly rumen degraded protein content. These trees were Acacia auriculiformis (Australian wattle), cashewnut (Anacardium occidentale), Gliricidia sepium, jack (Artocarpus heterophyllus), Sesbania grandiflora, subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) and yellow gold mohur or copper-pod tree (Peltophorum ferrugineum). Our objective was to use certain discerning chemical constituents (protein, phenolics, ADL, B3) to evaluate these tree leaves for their potential as ruminant feedstuff. The differences between NDF and NDFom (Table 2) reflected the ash content from fibre in NDF analysis, which ranges from 0.71 in case of subabul to 2.93% for acacia leaves. Similarly ash from fibre in ADF analysis ranged between 1.47 in case of jack and sesbania leaves and 2.27% in cashewnut leaves. NFC was calculated in two ways as 100 minus NDF, protein, lipids and ash in a feedstuff with or without NDF corrected for protein. The NFC values derived with NDF corrected for protein are appropriate. Total phenolics of acacia, cashewnut, gliricidia, jack, sesbania, subabul and yellow gold mohur, respectively, were 13.4, 20.3, 5.6, 15.6, 9.4, 11.3 and 12.5%. Sesbania, subabul and gliricidia were kept in best category in view of their higher protein, lower lignin and phenolics, while acacia, jack and yellow gold mohur in the next best category. Cashewnut leaves were kept in the last category in view of relatively lower protein and higher lignin and phenolics, which were responsible for the low nutritive value of them in goats. However, considering the beneficial effect of condensed tannins in protecting protein from rumen degradation, cashewnut or other leaves may be incorporated at appropriate level in the ruminant diet.

AB  - Xiaojiang drainage basin locates in the upper reach of Yangtze River, China, and is one of the regions suffering from serious erosion and ecological degeneration due to the climate, geological and geomorphological conditions and the heavy human activities. Reforestation is an effective measure for the ecological restoration, which has been done sine 1980s in the region. Four kinds of pure plantations, i. e. Eucalyptus spp. , Acacia mearnsii, Leucaena leucocephala and Pinus yunnanensis were investigated in the sample plots. Developing processes of species diversity and community structures of the tree layers, secondary shrub layers, and herbaceous layers were studied with the " ergodic hypothesis" method and the indexes of species richness, coverage, importance value and Shannon-Wiener index et al. And erosion control abilities of the four types of plantation were compared in this paper. The study made clear that Acacia mearnsii and Leucaena leucocephala grew faster, and had higher crown coverage and stronger erosion control ability than Pinus yunnanensis and Eucalyptus spp. Pinus yunnanensis had the highest secondary understory biodiversity, and Eucalyptus spp. had higher secondary understory biodiversity than that of Acacia mearnsii and Leucaena leucocephala mainly due to the different characters of the tree layer coverage. Different kinds of plantation had distinct effect in promoting plant diversity and had different erosion control ability. So plantation species selection and association mode should be considered in the process of reforestation for ecological restoration.
