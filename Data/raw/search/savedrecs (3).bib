Title = {Structural insight of two 4-Coumarate CoA ligase (4CL) isoforms
   in Leucaena suggests targeted genetic manipulations could lead to
   better lignin extractability from the pulp},

Abstract = {4-Coumarate: coenzyme A ligase (4CL) is a key enzyme involved in the
   early steps of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway. It is hypothesized
   to modulate S and G monolignol content in the plant. Lignin removal is
   imperative to the paper industry and higher S/G ratio governs better
   extractability of lignin and economics of the pulping process. This
   background prompted us to predict 3D structure of two isoforms
   of4CLinLeucaena leucocephalaand evaluate their substrate preferences.
   The 3D structure ofLl4CL1andLl4CL2protein were created by homology
   modeling and further refined by loop refinement. Molecular docking
   studies suggested differential substrate preferences of both the
   isoforms.Ll4CL1preferred sinapic acid (- 4.91 kcal/mole), ferulic acid
   (- 4.84 kcal/mole), hydroxyferulic acid (- 4.72 kcal/mole), and caffeic
   acid (- 4.71 kcal/mole), in their decreasing order.
   Similarly,Ll4CL2preferred caffeic acid (- 6.56 kcal/mole, 4 H bonds),
   hydroxyferulic acid (- 6.56 kcal/mole, 3 H bonds), and ferulic acid (-
   6.32 kcal/mole) and sinapic acid (- 5.00 kcal/mole) in their decreasing
   order. Further, active site residues were identified in both the
   isoforms and in silico mutation and docking analysis was performed. Our
   analysis suggested that ASP228, TYR262, and PRO326 forLl4CL1and SER165,
   LYS247 and PRO315 forLl4CL2were important for their functional activity.
   Based on differential substrate preferences of the two isoforms, as a
   first step towards genetically modifiedLeuaenahaving the desired
   phenotype, it can be proposed that over-expression ofLl4CL1gene and/or
   down-regulation ofLl4CL2gene could yield higher S/G ratio leading to
   better extractability of lignin.},

Title = {Soil water conservation and yield of winter sorghum (Sorghum
   bicolor L. Moench) as influenced by tillage, organic materials and
   nitrogen fertilizer in semi-arid tropical India},

Abstract = {Soil water and nutrients play an important role in increasing sorghum
   (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) yields in the Vertisols of semi-arid tropics
   during post-rainy season. The effects of tillage practices, organic
   materials and nitrogen fertilizer on soil properties, water conservation
   and yield of sorghum were evaluated during winter seasons of 1994-1995
   and 1995-1996 on deep Vertisols at Bijapur in the semi-arid tropics of
   Karnataka State (Zone 3) of south India. Conservation and availability
   of water and nutrients during different stages of crop growth were
   increased by deeper tillage resulting in increased grain yield of winter
   sorghum. Medium and deep tillage increased the grain yield by 23\% (1509
   kg ha(-1)) and 57\% (1919 kg ha(-1)) during 1994-1995 and 14\% (1562 kg
   ha(-1)) and 34\% (1835 kg ha(-1)) during 1995-1996, respectively, over
   shallow tillage. Water use efficiency increased from shallow (4.90 kg
   ha(-1) mm(-1)) to deep tillage (7.30 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)). Greater water
   use efficiency during 1994-1995 as compared to 1995-1996 was attributed
   to lower consumptive use of water during 1994-1995. Among organic
   materials, application of Leucaena loppings conserved larger amounts of
   water and increased winter sorghum yield and water use efficiency.
   Application of Leucaena loppings increased the winter sorghum grain
   yield by 9\% (mean of 1994-1995 and 1995-1996) as compared to
   vermicompost. Significantly (P < 0.05) higher water use efficiency of
   6.32 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) was observed in Leucaena loppings incorporated
   plots compared to 5.72 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) from vermicompost. Grain yield
   increased by 245 kg ha(-1) with application of 25 kg N ha(-1) in
   1994-1995, and a further increase in N application to 50 kg ha(-1)
   increased the grain yield by about 349 kg ha(-1) in 1995-1996. Deep
   tillage with application of 25 kg N ha(-1) resulted in significantly
   higher sorghum yield (2047 kg ha(-1)) than control during 1994-1995.
   Deep tillage with integrated nutrient management (organic and inorganic
   N sources) conserved higher amount of soil water and resulted in
   increased sorghum yields especially during drought years. (c) 2005

Abstract = {Strategies to breed sterile leucaena for Western Australia include plant
   breeding and biotechnology tools to generate sterile lines at both the
   tetraploid and triploid ploidy levels. For tetraploids, the main target
   species is the commercial Leucaena leucocephala, that is well known for
   its potential as a high-quality, productive and persistent forage. Gene
   editing technologies (CRISPR) will be utilized to edit out flowering
   genes and develop a non-flowering L. leucocephala and/or create
   male/female genic sterile lines of L. leucocephala. For triploids, the
   strategy is to cross tetraploid species (L. leucocephala and/or L.
   diversifolia) with diploid species to generate sterile triploid hybrids.
   The diploid parents will include species that have good forage
   attributes such as L. collinsii, L. macrophylla, L. shannonii and L.
   pulverulenta. Several of these triploid crosses have already been
   created by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development
   (Perth, Western Australia) and will be evaluated in the Kimberley and
   Pilbara regions of Western Australia for their agronomic performance and
   sterility. Vegetative propagation will be required for the tetraploid
   gene-edited non-flowering L. leucocephala. Triploids can either be
   vegetatively propagated, once generated, or generated via a seed
   production nursery.},

Abstract = {Ecological interactions between trees and crops are examined in terms of
   above and below ground utilizations of physical resources. Above ground
   interactions such as changes in light, temperature, and humidity are
   analyzed in terms of possible effects on understory crops. Our analysis
   shows that atmospheric interactions in alley cropping in the semi-arid
   tropics are positive but of minor importance compared with below ground
   interactions.
   Separation of below ground interactions by a shallow polythene barrier
   (0.5 m) indicated that competition for soil moisture is responsible for
   the negative interactions reported in the semi-arid tropics (SAT).
   Measurements of root distribution showed that roots of Leucaena
   leucocephala Lam. trees are abundant in the top 30 cm of the soil and
   the presence of a root barrier was effective in restricting lateral
   movement of the roots. This evidence is contrary to the assumption that
   trees have deep rooting systems which do not compete with crops.
   A secondary aim is to illustrate the contrasting problems encountered in
   intercropping and agroforestry systems. The importance or root studies
   are highlighted and the ways in which positive interactions could be
   achieved are investigated.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to examine the effect of replacing concentrate
   mixture with leaf meal mixture of Leucaena leucocephala-Melia
   azedarach-Morus alba in equal proportion on growth, nutrient
   utilization, blood and rumen metabolites in growing goats using
   completely randomized design. Twelve male non-descript goats were
   divided into two groups, control and experimental, consisting of six
   animals in each group. The control group was fed concentrate mixture
   whereas in experimental group 50\% of concentrate mixture was replaced
   with isonitrogenous leaf meal mixture. The duration of experimental
   feeding was 45 days. Weekly body weights were recorded to assess growth
   rate of goats. After 30 days of experimental feeding a metabolism trial
   of 6 days duration was conducted to determine digestibility of nutrients
   and nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balance. Blood samples were
   collected at 0, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 45 days of experimental feeding to
   study blood metabolites. Rumen liquor was also collected at 0 and 30
   days to study rumen metabolites. The average daily gain (g) of control
   group (51.56) and experimental group (62.22) was statistically (P>0.05)
   similar. The goat of control and experimental group had statistically
   (P>0.05) similar intake (g/kg W-0.75/day) of dry matter (60.70 vs
   64.64), concentrate mixture (40.16 vs 41.60) and wheat straw (20.53 vs
   23.05), respectively.
   The digestibility (\%) of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and
   ether extract was significantly (P<0.05) depressed in experimental group
   of goat (65.60, 68.90, 65.62 and 63.05, respectively) as compared to
   control group (75.14, 77.41, 76.06 and 79.14, respectively). The
   digestibility (\%) of neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and
   hemicellulose was similar in control (66.73, 65.49 and 64.97,
   respectively) and treatment group (58.21, 51.66 and 64.97.
   respectively). Animals of both the groups were in positive balance of
   nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus. Nitrogen balance (g/day) in control
   and treatment group of goat was similar (3.86 and 4.05, respectively)
   while calcium and phosphorus balance (g/day) was significantly (P<0.05)
   higher in control group (2.34 and 1.02) than treatment group (1.06 and
   0.22). There was no statistically significant (P>0.05) effect of
   collection period and diet composition on the blood biochemical
   metabolites (hemoglobin, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin and
   urea nitrogen) of goats. The pH of rumen fluid at 0 and 30 days of
   experimental feeding was 6.60, 6.60 for control group and 6.69, 6.33 for
   experimental group of goats. There was no significant difference
   (P>0.05) in nitrogenous fractions (mg/dl) (ammonia nitrogen (19.27 vs
   19.30), total nitrogen (101.52 vs 100.14), TCA-ppt nitrogen (50.24 vs
   48.84) and non-protein nitrogen (50.06 vs 51.12) of rumen fluid
   collected at 30 days of experimental feeding of control and treatment
   group of goats, respectively.
   From present study it can be concluded that Leucaena-Melia-Morus mixture
   can replace 50\% of concentrate mixture in the ration of growing goats
   without any adverse effect on growth, nutrient utilization, blood
   metabolites and rumen fermentation parameters. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   regression equations adjusted to the variations of osmotic potential in
   each parameter and the osmotic potential of the extracts. The results
   showed that the pH did not constitute in a source of variation of the
   results. The donor species indicated allelopathic potential that varied
   in function of donor and receiver species and part of the donor plant.
   The aqueous shoot extract of `'mineirao'' and `'calopogonio'' showed
   inhibition potential higher than the extract from seeds, while for
   leucena the effects more evident were obtained with the extract from
   seeds. Comparatively, the radicle elongation was a more sensitive

   Sesbania species had short life-spans (1 year for Sesbania macrantha and
   2.5 years for Sesbania sesban) but had outstanding growth and biomass
   production. This makes them ideal candidate MPTs for improved fallows,

Abstract = {The relationships between cow nutrition, restricted suckling and milking
   patterns and their effect on milk yield, milk composition and calf
   growth were examined under tropical conditions in south east Mexico.
   Eleven Bos indicus X Bos taurus cows, 14 days postpartum, with calves
   weighing on average 37 kg were used in a change-over experimental
   design. All cows were fed Cynodon nlemfuensis hay ad libitum, and either
   4.0 kg Leucaena leucocephala, 2.0 kg sorghum grain and 0.25 kg
   sugar-cane molasses on a fresh weight basis (L1), or twice this amount
   of the same supplement (L2). The calves were offered the same hay ad
   libitum in addition to suckling milk. The milking/restricted suckling
   treatments were: twice-daily milking with suckling after morning milking
   (2 X AM), and once-daily milking in the morning with afternoon suckling
   (1 X PM). The two regimes were examined at L1 and L2 feeding levels. A
   suckling time of 30 min was allowed at each suckling occasion. For 2 X
   AML1, 2 X AML2, 1 X PML1 and 1 X PML2, respectively saleable milk yields
   (SMYs) (kg/day) were 5.43, 5.99, 3.47, 4.09 (S.E.M. 0.174); calf suckled
   milk (CSM) (kg/day) 1.36, 1.46, 3.14, 3.43 (S.E.M. 0.160); and total
   milk yield (kg/day) 6.79, 7.46, 6.62, 7.53 (S.E.M. 0.226). For SMYs, fat
   contents (g/kg) were 30.0, 29.4, 29.0, 28.7 (S.E.M. 1.11), respectively,
   and for CSM 59.6, 63.4, 38.8, 42.4 (S.E.M. 2.46). Protein contents
   (g/kg) for SMYs were 27.5, 29.1, 29.3, 30.4 (S.E.M. 0.67) and for CSM
   27.9, 28.4, 29.1, 30.3 (S.E.M. 0.81). Total food intakes of cows were
   10.84, 12.12, 10.99, 12.16 (S.E.M. 0.331) kg DM/day. Calf growth rates
   were, respectively, 0.17, 0.20, 0.41, 0.52 (S.E.M. 0.029) kg/day, and

   Composting effect on hydrogen production},
Journal = {FUEL},

Volume = {89},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Compost from vegetable residues is usually used as an organic amendment
   to soil; however, their thermal degradation characteristics show that it
   could be used as raw material in air gasification facilities. According
   to the obtained data, hydrogen production is positively affected by
   composting, increasing hydrogen concentration in the raw gas from 15.2
   to 22.6 vol\%. This effect is related with physicochemical changes that
   occur during thermophilic stage of composting. After this step it does
   not observes any progress on hydrogen production.
   On the other hand, in order to compare thermal degradation of a biomass
   (Leucaena leucocephala) and two composts with different maturation
   levels, non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) has been used.
   Under inert atmosphere, data have been adequately simulated assuming
   three fractions (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) in both biomass
   and composts. However, under air atmosphere we have used a simplified
   model that assume two components in biomass (holocellulose and lignin)
   and three in composts (including humic substances). Using nth-order
   kinetic equations to describe component degradations, we have calculated
   a set of kinetic parameters which do not differ of the reported for
   other lignocellulosic materials. This procedure allows obtaining an
   approximate composition of samples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The leucaena psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana Crawford) has severely reduced
   the productivity of Leucaena leucocephala pantropically since spreading
   from its native range in the early 1980s. Quantification of a commonly
   used psyllid damage rating scale in terms of loss of yield showed that,
   at even moderate damage ratings, yield loss of susceptible accessions
   can be greater than 50\%. Psyllid populations have responded
   differentially to a number of climatic variables; psyllid damage was low
   when temperatures were above 33 degrees C or below 10 degrees C. The two
   main approaches to psyllid damage management are biological control and
   genetic resistance. Biological control agents, including the
   coccinellids Curinus coeruleus and Olla v-nigrum and the parasitoid
   Psyllaephagus yaseeni, have reduced the severity of yield reduction due
   to psyllids but damage can still be significant. Genetic resistance in
   Leucaena spp. is therefore an important goal and, when comprehensively
   evaluated in Australia and the Philippines, ranged from highly resistant
   to highly susceptible. There was considerable intraspecific Variation in
   psyllid resistance within species such as L. collinsii, L. diversifolia,
   L. trichandra and L. pallida. L. leucocephala was the most susceptible
   species. Chemical and physical plant factors conferring psyllid
   resistance were reviewed. No single factor was identified and data were
   inconsistent across studies.},

Abstract = {This study addresses sustainability challenges in Southern Thailand,
   particularly the scarcity of biomass fuel and animal feed. It
   investigates the integration of Leucaena leucocephala cultivation with
   hydrothermal carbonization. The research compares the biomass yield and
   economic feasibility of growing Leucaena as a sole crop versus
   intercropping it with Para rubber trees. Sole cropping Leucaena produces
   higher biomass yields and is more economically viable. The wood stem of
   Leucaena is competitive with other biomass fuels used in local power
   plants, while its leaves, with over 14 \% protein content, meet local
   animal feed market standards. Additionally, branches, which constitute
   15.15 \%-30.58 \% of the total biomass, are usually left as residue but
   can be used for hydrochar production. The study examines the effects of
   temperature (235 degrees C and 265 degrees C) and retention time (1, 2,
   and 3 h) on hydrochar properties. Optimal condition (265 degrees C for 1
   h) produces hydrochar with high heating value and energy yield. Using
   these branches for hydrochar can significantly boost total revenue, with
   hydrochar contributing 54.9 \% to overall revenue (4522.00 USD/ha).
   Integrating Leucaena cultivation with hydrothermal carbonization offers
   a sustainable solution, enhancing revenue, supporting local energy and
   feed needs, and promoting environmental sustainability.},

Abstract = {Sexual shape dimorphism is the differentiation of male and female
   organisms based on their shape variation; this definition was proposed
   for the use of geometric morphometrics analysis where the geometric
   features of the shape are analyzed without the influence of the size.
   Macaria mirthae (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) is a moth that inhabits
   different valleys in the north of Chile principally associated to Acacia
   macracantha and lately Leucaena leucocephala both trees of the Fabaceae
   family. The Sexual dimorphism was analyzed in this species in order to
   corroborate studies on the use of wing as a sexual differentiation
   trait, and specific influence of localities was also evaluated. A clear
   shape variation was found where the male wings are more contracted
   compared to female wings. A climate influence is also suggested that
   could differentiate the wing shape from the individuals that inhabit two
   different valleys in the neotropical region of the north of Chile. This
   research supports previous studies identifying a clear Sexual shape
   dimorphism in the wing, as a selected trait, suggesting that oviposition
   and male competition of this group of moths is reflected in their wings.
   These differences raise the question whether Sexual shape dimorphism can
   be modulated by natural selection. (C) 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de

   microbiota for beef cattle.
   Methods. Four rumen-cannulated Nellore cattle grazing a tropical grass
   pasture were used as inoculum donors.
   Key results. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis
   revealed that the abundance ofRuminococcus flavefaciens, methanogenic
   archaea and protozoa populations were reduced (P  pound 0.05), whereas
   total ruminal bacteria were enhanced in the presence of CT. Our study
   also revealed a positive (P  pound 0.05) relationship between CT
   andFibrobacter succinogenesabundance. Reactive CT fromL. leucocephala,D.
   paniculatumandL. procumbensresulted in decreased (P  pound 0.05) isoacid
   content and methane production.
   Conclusions. L. leucocephala, D. paniculatumandL . procumbenshave the
   potential to suppress rumen methanogenesis. However,in vitrofermentation
   of L. leucocephalaresulted in greater (P  pound 0.05) degradability
   percentages than the other two species.
   Implications. CT in legume species will have potential as part of an
   overall nutritional strategy to manipulate rumen microbiota and mitigate
   enteric methanogenesis in livestock production systems.},

Title = {Influence of Different Cutting Positions and Rooting Hormones on Root
   Initiation and Root-soil Matrix of Two Tree Species},

Abstract = {The soil bioengineering technique, vegetation through stem cutting, is
   highly effective for soil reinforcement as well as in controlling
   surface erosion. But the success of this technique depends on the
   suitable plant species, their stem cutting position and their rooting
   ability. This study aimed at investigating the effects of different
   cutting positions and hormones on the formation of rooting of stem
   cuttings and root-soil matrix. According to the observations, Leucaena
   leucocephala was not suitable for propagation through stem cuttings.
   Even stem cuttings were treated by rooting hormones. In case of
   Peltophorum pterocarpum stem cuttings, a higher survival rate with
   higher stem number, leaf area index (LAI) and root initiation were
   observed in basal position cuttings than apical position. The soil
   moisture content was negatively correlated with root biomass and matric
   suction. Moreover, higher root length, volume and biomass were found in
   IBA treated stems than NAA and control, which presumably reduce more
   soil moisture content and increase matric suction. It can be concluded
   that stem cuttings should be taken from basal cutting position and IBA
   hormone should be applied to induce adventitious roots of P.
   pterocarpum. This technique will be suitable for practical application
   on soil bioengineering sites to improve root-soil matrix and reinforce
   soil. (C) 2013 Friends Science Publishers},

Volume = {10},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {One approach to predicting non-target attack by potential biological
   control agents is to first describe their fundamental host ranges and
   then to predict how it will be expressed under postrelease field
   conditions. In this paper, we illustrate how the fundamental host range
   can be estimated experimentally by excluding possible limiting factors
   such as time-dependent effects. The example we use is a host-specificity
   study of a leaf-tying moth (Gelechiidae: Evippe sp. \#1) which was being
   assessed for the biological control of mesquite (Leguminosae Prosopis
   spp.) in Australia. Females oviposited all eggs on plants, mostly into
   cracks and fissures First instar larvae leaf-mined and subsequent
   instars leaf-tied Oviposition was not host-specific in cage trials,
   although ten times more eggs were laid on Prosopis than on non-targets.
   The fundamental host range for initiation of larval feeding was
   restricted to Prosopis and Leucaena leucocephala which both belong to
   the same tribe, and the fundamental host range for complete larval
   development was restricted to Prosopis. We predict that if released in
   Australia Evippe sp. \#1 will only attack Prosopis spp., although low
   levels of `indiscriminate' oviposition might occur on other taxa, and
   might result in initiation of feeding on L. leucocephala.},

   7.1 and 5.5 kg in Experiments 1 and 2 respectively. Additional protein
   did not affect Napier fodder intake, but total intakes of dry matter
   were higher for the cows receiving the protein supplements, differences
   which were significant (P < 0.05) in Experiment 2. Average daily milk
   production from cows fed Napier fodder alone was 6.4 and 4.2 kg in
   Experiments 1 and 2 respectively. The additional 300 g crude protein
   increased milk production by 1.0 to 1.6 kg/day, increases which, except
   that for fishmeal, were significant (P < 0.05). Weight losses of the

Abstract = {In an arid region of India, 4 year old high density ('energy') exotic

   concentration of nitrogen in decomposing litter of L. leucocephala and
   A. nilotica decreased as a result of mineralization; in E. tereticornis,
   it increased as a result of immobilization. Immobilization of phosphorus
   was much higher than that of nitrogen, and it was more pronounced in

Abstract = {The leguminous tropical multipurpose tree Acacia angustissima is a
   potential source of protein for ruminants fed roughage diets. Proximate
   analysis and in vitro techniques were used to evaluate the nutritive
   value of 15 accessions of A. angustissima in comparison with the
   tanniniferous legumes (Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala)
   and lucerne (Medicago sativa). Freeze- and oven-dried (50 degrees C leaf
   samples were used and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was added to some in
   vitro fermentations (5 mg PEG/50 mg plant substrate) to assess the
   effects of tannins on digestion of dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N). The
   acacia accessions were also screened for secondary compounds that could
   effect the nutritive value of the plant.
   Average NDF and ADF content did not differ markedly between A.
   angustissima accessions (417 and 189 g/kg), L. leucocephala (447 and 178
   g/kg), C. calothyrsus (416 and 205 g/kg) and lucerne (399 and 168 g/kg).
   Average N content of A. angustissima (38 g/kg) and C. calothyrsus (36
   g/kg) were similar but tended to be lower than L. leucocephala (43 g/kg)
   and lucerne (50 g/kg). Oven drying at 50 degrees C compared with freeze
   drying did not significantly effect fermentation characteristics of NH3,
   branched chain (BCVFA) and short chain volatile fatty acid (SCVFA.)
   production in the plants. There was a two-fold difference in SCVFA
   production amongst acacia accessions without PEG while variation in NH3
   and BCVFA production was small due to negligible production or a net
   consumption of these metabolites during fermentation. Inclusion of PEG
   in fermentations of A. angustissima resulted in a marked and significant
   increase in DM digestibility and production of SCVFA (2-4.4-fold
   increase), NH3 (> 4-fold increase) and BCVFA (> 10-fold increase).
   All acacia accessions had a high free condensed tannin content which
   ranged from 98 to 180g/kg and only minor amounts of tannin were in a
   bound form (< 2g/kg). Dimethyltryptamine and N-methyltyramine alkaloids
   were present in the acacia accessions in very small quantities
   (1.1-10.2ppm). Several non-protein amino acids were detected in all
   accessions of A. angustissima in the following order of concentration:
   gamma-acetyldiaminobutyric acid > oxalylalbizziin >
   alpha-acetyldiaminobutyric acid > albizzim > oxalyldiaminobutyric acid
   and oxalyldiaminopropionic acid. The main non-protein amino acid was
   gamma-acetyldiaminobutyric acid which ranged in concentration from 181
   to 293 g/kg DM.
   In conclusion, in vitro digestibility was low for all acacia accession
   due to the presence of tannins. These accessions all contained
   significant amounts of non-protein amino acids that need to be evaluated
   further for potential toxicity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The historical and geographical properties of the archipelagos allow a
   detailed study of species diversification, and phenotypic traits can
   indicate the extent of such processes. Eupelmus pulchriceps (Cameron,
   1904) is an exotic species to the Galapagos archipelago, and generalist
   parasitoid that attacks a beetle species that consumes the seeds of the
   invasive shrub Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Despite extensive
   sampling, the wasp is recorded only in Santa Cruz and San Cristobal
   islands of the Galapagos archipelago. Thus, using 112 female wasps, we
   compare body size, proportion, and allometric differentiations within
   and between the two islands. There were no body size differences between
   islands. A PerMANOVA indicates differences between the islands and a
   single differentiation between two localities of one island. Allometric
   differences between islands were not the same for all structures. These
   results are consistent with the greater distance between islands than
   between localities and suggest a differentiation process. The variables
   with allometric differentiation are associated with wings and
   ovipositor, possibly responding to different ecological pressures. It is
   interesting that this parasitoid, recently arrived at the archipelago,
   is already showing differentiation. Also, it is essential to monitor the
   behavior of these wasps in the archipelago, given their potential to
   access other species affecting the trophic interactions of the local
   biota.},

Volume = {145},

Abstract = {Exotic species are species established outside of their natural range
   and include invasive species, which are the second most important cause
   of biodiversity loss worldwide and a high risk factor for fragile
   ecosystems. The exotic species Leucaena leucocephala, a high-risk
   invasive species, has been introduced to Andean tropical dry forests of
   Colombia. Here, we compare the complexity and structure of the arthropod
   trophic networks of the seeds of two legume species, Senegalia riparia
   (native) and L. leucocephala (exotic), and also evaluate seed
   germination potential after Bruchinae emergence in comparison with that
   of undamaged seeds. We found 16 species of arthropods associated with
   both legume seeds, but the native species had more parasitoids, causing
   its network to be more dense and complex than that of the exotic
   species. Four arthropod species connected the two networks. The native
   species seeds already used for beetle development had the lowest
   germination percentage, whereas those of the exotic species exhibited
   the highest. Comparing the structure of seed feeder communities and
   their effects on germination in exotic and native legumes is essential
   for understanding how exotic species relate to native communities and
   how anthropogenic changes affect species diversity, ecosystem dynamics,
   and community structure and interactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) manifest different levels of
   selectivity for different pastures and forages. Knowledge of feed
   selectivity is important to facilitate the design of efficient
   production systems that take into account optimal animal welfare. In
   this study, the selectivity of nine 18-month old female water buffaloes
   for Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium, and
   Moringa oleifera was evaluated. After 12 h of grazing Megathyrsus
   maximum, the animals were housed in individual shelters and 1.2 kg of
   leaves from each of the four tree species were offered to the animals
   simultaneously. The selectivity, measured as the intake of dry matter
   (DM), was highest for A. lebbeck (mean = 0.34 kgDM, SD = 0.05 kg),
   followed by L. leucocephala (mean = 0.30 kgDM, SD = 0.03 kg), M.
   oleifera (mean = 0.11 kgDM, SD = 0.05 kg), and G. sepium (mean = 0.10
   kgDM, SD = 0.02 kg) (P < 0.01). The crude protein intake was highest for
   A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala. Notably, the less selected leaves were
   those of G. sepium and M. oleifera. This study suggests that the
   inclusion of A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala in silvopastoral systems may
   increase both the consumption and well-being of water buffaloes in the
   tropics.},

   one, or both fungi. In the unfertilized soil, leucaena plants grew
   poorly and there was no plant response to individual or dual
   inoculation. When RP was added G. fistulosum significantly increased
   plant Pi uptake and growth, the effect of inoculation was significantly
   higher at the P levels of 300-600 mg.kg(-1). Mortierella sp. was highly
   effective in increasing plant P uptake and growth of mycorrhizal
   leucaena, but it was ineffective in nonmycorrhizal leucaena across the
   RP gradient. The synergistic effects of dual inoculation were more
   evident on plant Pi uptake than on growth. The results indicate that the
   phosphate-solubilizing fungus effect was limited by soil Pi sorption.
   This limitation likely was overcome by the mycorrhizal association,
   which allowed a more efficient capture of the Pi released due to RP

Abstract = {This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of various

   milk composition in dairy cows. Four Holstein Friesian native crossbred
   cows in early lactating were randomly assigned according to a 4x4 Latin

   sources in concentrate diets were soybean meal (SBM), cassava hay (CH),
   Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and yeast-fermented cassava chips (YEFECAP),
   with ad libitum intake of urea-treated rice straw. Digestibility of DM,
   OM, NDF and ADF was not different among treatments (P>0.05) while CP
   digestibility was highest (P<0.05) in CH and YEFECAP supplemented
   groups. Ruminal NH3-N and BUN concentrations varied among protein
   sources and were highest in SBM and LL fed groups (P<0.05). Ruminal
   total volatile fatty acid (VFA) and propionic acid were found highest in
   cows receiving CH and YEFECAP (P<0.05). Ruminal fungi, proteolytic and
   cellulolytic bacteria were highest when YEFECAP was supplemented. Milk
   fat and milk protein were significantly increased (P<0.05) in cows fed

   monomers were hydrolysed by all rumen fluid sources. The conclusion from
   this work was that rumen fluid from goat, gazelle, Gunther's dik-dik,

Abstract = {The relationship between environment and abundance of rhizobia was
   described by determining the populations of root nodule bacteria at 14
   diverse sites on the island of Maui. Mean annual rainfall at the sites
   ranged from 320 to 1,875 mm, elevation from 37 to 1,650 m, and soil pH
   from 4.6 to 7.9. Four different soil orders were represented in this
   study: inceptisols, mollisols, ultisols, and an oxisol. the rhizobial
   populations were determined by plant infection counts of five legumes 
   (Trifolium repens, Medicago sativa, Vicia sativa, Leucaena leucocephala,
   and Macroptilium atropurpureum). Populations varied from 1.1 to 4.8
   log10 cells per g of soil. The most frequently occurring rhizobia were
   Bradyrhizobium spp., which were present at 13 or 14 sites with a maximum
   of 4.8 log10 cells per g of soil. Rhizobium trifolii and R.
   leguminosarum occurred only at higher elevations. The presence of a
   particular Rhizobium or Bradyrihizobium sp. was correlated with the
   occurrence of its appropriate host legume. Total rhizobial populations
   were significantly correlated with mean annual rainfall, legume cover
   and shoot biomass, soil temperature, soil pH, and phosphorus retention.
   Regression models are presented which describe the relationship of
   legume hosts, soil climate, and soil fertility on native rhizobial
   populations.},

Abstract = {Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) is widely recognized in many countries
   as a commercially valuable plant, particularly when used as a nutritious
   fodder in subtropical and tropical regions. However, it is also
   considered an environmental weed in some countries due to its ability to
   form dense infestations in disturbed areas, where it is not proactively
   managed or grazed. These different perspectives have made leucaena a
   contentious species. Ideally, landholders and relevant jurisdictions in
   charge of invasive species need to work together to minimize its spread
   as a weed and manage existing infestations. To date, the response has
   been varied, ranging from no action through to some jurisdictions
   formally recognizing leucaena as an environmental weed within relevant
   legislation and applying requirements to minimize its impact. Between
   these extremes, there are initiatives such as an industry Code of
   Practice (i.e. The Leucaena Network in Australia), recommending that
   those growing leucaena adhere to certain principles and practices to
   minimize the risk of spread from their operations. The biology of weed
   leucaena (e.g. large seed production, relatively long-lived seed banks)
   and the situations in which it spreads (e.g. roadsides and riparian
   systems) pose management challenges to landholders and relevant
   jurisdictions. Adaptive management and experimental research are
   necessary to identify effective control strategies for a range of
   situations.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Although semiarid regions present a poor rainfall distribution
   throughout the year, the most frequently used mathematical model
   describing the litter decomposition rate (LDR) predicts the same
   behavior of crop residues behavior in dry and rainy seasons. The aim of
   this study was to design a mathematical model to describe the LDR by a
   means of piecewise continuous function depending on the rainfall
   quantity. Afield experiment was conducted from October 2009 to September
   2010 at Brejo Paraibano, Paraiba, Brazil. The experimental design was
   completely randomized in a 6 x 12 factorial arrangement, with six plant
   residues, brachiaria (Brachiaria decumbens Stapf), corn (Zea mays L.),
   sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis
   L.), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Hunth), and leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala Lam.), and 12 collection periods. Using data obtained from
   an experimental field, a mathematical model was developed. The proposed
   model is based on the concept of infinite series. It was verified that
   in dry seasons the LDR can be well described by a linear function
   whereas in rainy ones an exponential function describes it better.
   Statistical analysis showed good agreement between the experimental data
   and the theoretical model. For the model, the decomposition coefficients
   for each culture and each period are proposed.},

Abstract = {Reducing costs of implementation and maintenance of restoration
   activities is crucial for a project's success. In order to achieve it,
   direct seeding and the use of green manure species have been proposed as
   potential alternatives. Here, we compare some preliminary results on
   seedlings performance and cost on four restoration techniques including
   these alternatives in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. In 16 plots, we
   established: (1) conventional seedling planting of 20 native species
   (2x3m spacing between plants), (2) direct seeding of Senna alata among
   the seedlings of the 20 native species; (3) direct seeding of Cajanus
   cajan among seedlings of the 20 native species and; (4) direct seeding
   of Leucaena leucocephala in the inter-row of the 20 native species
   seedlings. A year later seedling performance (survival and growth)
   resulted similar among these four techniques. However, costs of using
   Senna and Cajanus were consistently lower, mainly during the maintenance
   phase due to the reduction of fertilization and individual protection
   needs. Introducing green manure species by direct seeding may be a
   useful strategy to complement and eventually replace planting seedlings
   of other high-growth rate species to rapidly cover the soil surface.
   This approach may partially reduce some financial costs, particularly at
   the early stages of projects. Other strategies should be evaluated to
   complement our results.},

Abstract = {Rhizobium tropici is a well-studied legume symbiont characterized by
   high genetic stability of the symbiotic plasmid and tolerance to
   tropical environmental stresses such as high temperature and low soil
   pH. However, high phenetic and genetic variabilities among R. tropici
   strains have been largely reported, with two subgroups, designated type
   A and B, already defined within the species. A polyphasic study
   comprising multilocus sequence analysis, phenotypic and genotypic
   characterizations, including DNA-DNA hybridization, strongly supported
   the reclassification of R. tropici type A strains as a novel species.
   Type A strains formed a well-differentiated clade that grouped with R.
   tropici, Rhizobium multihospitium, Rhizobium miluonense, Rhizobium
   lusitanum and Rhizobium rhizogenes in the phylogenies of the 16S rRNA,
   recA, gltA, rpoA, glnII and rpoB genes. Several phenotypic traits
   differentiated type A strains from all related taxa. The novel species,
   for which the name Rhizobium leucaenae sp. nov. is proposed, is a broad
   host range rhizobium being able to establish effective root-nodule
   symbioses with Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena esculenta, common beans

   completely randomized design with three replications. Each treatment
   consisted of 25 seedlings. The data on height and collar diameter and
   biomass yield indicated that leaf litter had significant effect on these
   parameters. The maximum seedling height (85.6 cm) and collar diameter
   (1.28 cm) was recorded with leaf litter applied at 60 gm kg(-1) of soil,
   which was statistically at par with 40 gm kg(-1). Highest plant height
   (93.0 cm) was recorded with S. grandiflora leaf litter applied @ 40 gm

Abstract = {We studied the influence of the operational variables (viz.

   times of 30-90 min and numbers of PFI beating revolutions of 500-1500)
   on pulp yield and various paper properties (breaking length, stretch,

   pulping of vine shoots, cotton stalks, leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala)

   The fuzzy neural network models used reproduced the experimental results
   with errors less than 15\% and smaller than those provided by
   second-order polynomial models in all cases.
   An ethylene-glycol concentration of 65\% at 180 C for 75 min and 1500
   PFI beating revolutions were found to provide substantial savings in
   energy, chemicals and facility investments as a result of operating
   under milder conditions than the strongest ones studied in this work.
   Tagasaste was found to be the most suitable raw material among those
   tested as it provided the paper sheets with the highest breaking length
   (4644 m), stretch (2.87\%), burst index (2.46 kN/g), tear index (0.33 in
   Nm(2)/g) and brightness (40.92\%); its pulp yield was also high
   (62.88\%), which reflects efficient use of this raw material. (c) 2007

Abstract = {The nodulation genes of rhizobia are involved in the production of the
   lipo-chitin oligosaccharides (LCO), which are signal molecules required
   for nodule formation, A mutation in nodZ of Bradyrhizobium japonicum
   results in the synthesis of nodulation signals lacking the wild-type
   5-O-methylfucose residue at the reducing-terminal N-acetylglucosamine,
   This phenotype is correlated with a defective nodulation of siratro
   (Macroptilium atropurpureum), Here we show that transfer of nodZ to
   Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar (bv) viciae, which produces LCOs that are
   not modified at the reducing-terminal N-acetylglucosamine, results in
   production of LCOs with a fucosyl residue on C-6 of the
   reducing-terminal N-acetylglucosamine. This finding, together with in
   vitro enzymatic assays, indicates that the product of nodZ functions as
   a fucosyltransferase, The transconjugant R. leguminosarum strain
   producing fucosylated LCOs acquires the capacity to nodulate M.
   atropurpureum, Glycine soja, Vigna unguiculata and Leucaena
   leucocephala, Therefore, nodZ extends the narrow host range of R.
   leguminosarum bv. viciae to include various tropical legumes, However,
   microscopic analysis of nodules induced on siratro shows that these
   nodules do not contain bacteroids, showing that transfer of nodZ does
   not allow R. leguminosarum to engage in a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with

   the animals were of the red variety, weaned with four months of age,

   were: A = 250 g of leucena hay (approximately 30\% of the total dry
   matter + elephant grass ad libitum; B = 350 g of leucena hay
   (approximately 40\% of the total dry matter consumption) + elephant

   total dry matter consumption) + elephant grass ad libitum; D = 550 g of
   leucena hay (approximately 60\% of the total dry matter consumption) +
   elephant grass ad libitum. Leucena hay levels showed a positive
   influence on feed consumption. The weight gain, feed conversion and
   carcass yield were considered low. The low level of energy consumption
   probably produced small weight gains. The reduced carcass yield might be
   due to age of animals at the time of slaughter. In conclusion, it can be
   said that during the growing stage forage can be used as the only source
   of food for Morada Nova lambs.},

Abstract = {Plant species possess a huge potential in restoration of fly ash
   ecosystem. Litter deposition and its decomposition in the ash deposited
   sites are two important processes of the fly ash ecosystem. In order to
   identify the biological potential of a plant species to aid restoration
   of fly ash deposited sites, it is needed to assess leaf litter
   decomposition as well as nutrient release pattern. In the present
   investigation, we studied the leaf litter decomposition of the plant
   species (Leucaena leucocephala,Pithecellobium dolceandProsopis
   juliflora) and mix plantation in the fly ash ecosystem. The litter bag
   experiment was conducted in the area of plantation on the fly ash
   deposited site during a period of 365 days. Percentage of C and N was
   higher inL. leucocephala > P. dolce >Mix Plantation > P. juliflorawhile
   C/N ratio was higher inP. juliflora >Mix Plantation > L. leucocephala >
   P. dolce.L. leucocephalaandP. dolceshowed relatively fast decomposition
   rates (k = 1.27, 1.17), respectively while mix plantation (k = 0.82)
   andP. juliflora(k = 0.73) exhibited relatively slower decomposition
   rates. Thus, we noted that the decomposition rate ofL. leucocephalawas
   greater than the other selected species. This shows that the species
   having faster decomposition rate and nutrient release could be a factual
   choice for rehabilitation of fly ash deposited sites.},

Abstract = {Root development, water use and water-use efficiency of 3 sorghum
   {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] varieties, viz. `CSV 13', `CSV 15' and
   `Varsha', raised in alleys formed by different vegetative barriers, viz.
   Sesbania sesban, Leucaena leucocephala, Cajanus cajan, Vetiveria
   zizanoides and Cenchrus ciliaris, and unbarriered (control) were studied
   during the rainy seasons of 1995 and 1996 at Kanpur on light-textured
   alluvial soil. Best root development of sorghum was observed when raised
   in alleys of Sesbania, followed by Leucaena, while the poorest root
   development in alleys of Cenchrus ciliaris. Among the sorghum varieties
   `Varsha' resulted in better root development in terms of depth, breadth,
   number and weight than `CSV 13' and `CSV 15'. Better root development of
   sorghum `Varsha' raised in alleys of Sesbania resulted in higher water
   use and water-use efficiency and yield attributes like 1,000-grain
   weight, grains/panicle, grain and fodder yields where `Varsha' excelled
   `CSV 13' and `CSV 15'. Total water use of sorghum under Sesbania was
   388.5 mm which was 9.6 mm higher than the control (unbarriered) crop.
   The water-use efficiency of sorghum in association with Sesbania was 5.3
   kg/ha-mm as compared with 4.1 kg/ha-mm unbarriered (control).},

Abstract = {Ten multipurpose tree species were planted both in monoculture and
   intercropped with Arachis hypogea (groundnut) in a randomized complete
   block with three replications. The vigour, biomass, nutrient content,
   and coppicing percentage of the trees were evaluated. Intercropping with
   groundnuts during the establishment phase did not affect subsequent
   growth and development of the species. Acacia mangium, Acacia
   auriculiformis, Cassia siamea, Calliandra calothyrsus and Paraserianthes
   falcataria established well, when compared to Gliricidia sepium,
   Leucaena leucocephala, Dialum guineense, Dubocia macrocarpa and Milicia
   excelsa. A. mangium, A. auriculiformis, C. calothyrsus, C. siamea and P.
   falcataria produced the highest leaf (4 to 20 t ha(-1)) and wood (12 to
   37 t ha(-1)) biomass yield (primary growth) at one to three years after
   planting. Coppicing percentage of A. mangium A. auriculiformis and P.
   falcataria were relatively low (35 to 50\%). C. calothyrsus and C.
   siamea showed the highest coppicing percentage (95 to 100\%) and
   produced the greatest coppice biomass (9 to 13 t ha(-1)). Total nitrogen
   and organic matter percentage of soils from under the stands of these
   two species were also significantly higher than that of the rest. The
   two species may thus be considered for use in agroforestry technologies
   for soil improvement on acid soils, which are typical of the moist
   tropics.},

   returned through litterfall. All the plantations studied were generally
   more efficient in N and K nutrient use than certain other plantations.},

Abstract = {A vegetation survey using 109 circular plots (3.4\% sample) of the
   recently acquired 110-ha La Tinaja tract in the Cartagena Lagoon
   Wildlife Refuge disclosed 103 dicotyledonous tree species. Another 58
   tree species were tallied within the tract but outside of the plots. The
   cactus, Pilosocereus royenii (L.) Byles \& Rowley, occurring on 44\% of
   the plots, had the greatest number of stems. Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) DeWit had the greatest number of individual trees. The 10 most
   common tree species accounted for nearly 60\% of the stems, and the 43
   least common species, each with less than or equal to5 individuals, for
   only 2.2\% of the stems. Five species accounted for 58.5\% of the total
   basal area, and 19 species were represented by a single plant. Seven
   endemic, 20 exotic, and three endangered species were tallied. A
   canonical correspondence analysis (CCA version 4, using a direct
   gradient analysis of species densities by plot) showed that land use
   history was the most important factor in explaining species'
   distribution. Slope and distance to drainages also added significantly
   to the explained variability. Aerial photos from 1998 show that the
   current ground cover is about 50\% shrubs, 43\% open canopy forest, and
   7\% grass cover.},

Abstract = {Leaves of nine agroforestry tree species (Grevillea robusta, Erythrina
   abyssinica, Gliricidia sepium, Albizia schimperiana, Acacia nilotica,
   Acacia polyacantha, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena pallida and Entada
   abyssinica) were compared in a glasshouse incubation experiment under
   natural temperature conditions to relate the observed nitrogen
   mineralization pattern to quality factors of the mulch material such as
   N, lignin, phenolic and tannin content and C/N ratio, lignin/N ratio,
   phenolic/N ratio and (lignin + phenolics)/N ratio. Separation of the
   plant material into leaflets and petioles/rachis or into leaves and
   petioles with subsequent chemical analyses revealed large differences in
   the quality of the material not only between species but also amongst
   plant parts within the same species. Erythrina abyssinica, G. sepium, L.
   leucocephala and L. pallida had a rapid nitrogen release especially
   during the early sampling dates and were superior compared with mulch
   treatments of G. robusta, A. polyacantha, and Entada abyssinica.
   Immobilization processes started around 5 weeks after incubation and
   continued up to the end of the experiment, 9 weeks after incubation. N
   and lignin content, C/N ratio, lignin/N ratio, phenolics/N ratio and
   (phenolics + lignin)/N ratio were all significantly correlated with
   mineralized nitrogen after 3 weeks but their influence in driving the
   mineralization pattern decreased with incubation time.},

   control 3 (135 N) > control 1 (45 N) > bare fallow. Mulching also
   affected the population dynamics of predatory microarthropods and
   omnivorous ants. The chemical composition of plant residues probably
   influenced the densities of detritivore and phytophage microarthropods,
   which in addition were also greatly influenced by microclimatic
   conditions imposed by vegetation cover. Extremely low densities of
   microarthropods were recorded in the bare fallow plots probably as a
   result of the combined effects of absence of plant residues and
   vegetation cover. The potential of mulching as a component of farming
   practice for increasing the density of microarthropods and for
   influencing their species composition and population dynamics in
   agroecosystems is discussed.},

   manner},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {In the symbiotic associations between rhizobia and legumes, NodD
   promotes the expression of the nodulation genes in the presence of
   appropriate flavonoids. This set of genes is implied in the synthesis of
   Nodulation factors, which are responsible for launching the nodulation
   process. Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 is the most successful symbiont of
   Phaseolus vulgaris and can nodulate a variety of legumes. This strain
   produces Nodulation factors under abiotic stress such as acidity or high
   concentration of salt. Genome sequencing of CIAT 899 allowed the
   identification of five nodD genes. Whereas NodD1 is essential to
   nodulate Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus japonicus and Macroptilium
   atropurpureum, symbiosis with P. vulgaris and Lotus burtii decreased the
   nodule number but did not abolish the symbiotic process when NodD1 is
   absent. Nodulation factor synthesis under salt stress is not regulated
   by NodD1. Here we confirmed that NodD2 is responsible for the activation
   of the CIAT 899 symbiotic genes under salt stress. We have demonstrated
   that NodD1 and NodD2 control the synthesis of the Nod factor necessary
   for a successful symbiosis with P. vulgaris and L. burtii. This is the
   first time that NodD is directly implied in the activation of the
   symbiotic genes under an abiotic stress.},

Abstract = {Earthworm powder is a potential source of lysine, a first limiting amino
   acid which is essential in fish diet. The incorporation of other feed
   ingredients with acceptable composition of lysine can help to enhance
   lysine content in fish feeds. The focus of this study is to optimize
   lysine content in fish feeds with difference percentages of each
   selected feeds ingredients. The optimization study was conducted using
   central composite design (CCD) as statistical tool. The optimum lysine
   content was obtained at 25.00 \%, 20.88 \%, 10.00 \% and 20.00 \% of
   earthworm powder, soybean waste, leucaena leucocephala leaves and fish
   meal, respectively. The lysine content in formulated fish feeds was
   significantly affected by the composition of earthworm powder and fish
   meal in fish feed formulation. Earthworm powder and fish meal have
   contributed the largest portion of lysine in fish feed due to high
   lysine content which were 4.48 \% w/w and 3.60 \% w/w, respectively. The
   optimized fish feed shows high lysine content of 23.39 \% w/w which
   doubles the lysine content in commercial fish feed (11.21 \% w/w). The
   composition of fish feed obtained from this study can be used as
   guidelines for formulation of high lysine fish feeds for African catfish
   fingerlings. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Seasonal chemical composition and ruminal organic matter (OM) and crude

   multi-purpose tree species (MPTS) namely; Pterocarpus santalinoides,
   Grewia pubescens, Enterolobium cyclocarpum and Leucaena leucocephala.
   Three West African dwarf (WAD) rams fitted with permanent rumen cannula
   were used for the degradability trials. Foliage samples were collected
   four times to represent seasonal variations as follows: January mid dry;
   April late dry; July mid rainy and October late rainy seasons. Leaf
   samples were randomly collected from the trees for estimation of dry
   matter (DM) and chemical composition. Ruminal in sacco OM and CP
   degradabilities were estimated from residues in nylon bags. All samples
   had high CP (161259 g/kg DM) and moderate fibre concentrations
   {[}neutral detergent fibre (without residual ash], 300501 g/kg DM; acid
   detergent fibre (without residual ash), 225409 g/kg DM and acid
   detergent lignin, 87179 g/kg DM across seasons. Interaction effects of
   species and season on chemical composition were highly significant (p =
   0.001) except for trypsin inhibitor (p = 0.614). The MPTS recorded more
   than 60\% OM and CP degradability at 24 h, which implied that they were
   all highly degradable in the rumen. Their incorporation into ruminant
   feeding systems as dry season forage supplements is therefore
   recommended.},

   compounds, neutral sugars and uronic acids) and rumen degradability of
   the dry matter (DMD) and neutral detergent fibre (NDFD) of six crop
   by-products (raw palm oil mill effluent (POME), dried POME, palm kernel
   cake, palm press fibre, cocoa pods and rice straw) and the leaves of two
   legumes (Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium) were measured.
   Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to compare
   and classify the feeds according to chemical composition and
   degradability. Lignin poorly differentiated between feeds and was poorly
   related to 48 h DMD; the major anomalies were with rice straw and
   Gliricidia (low lignin, low DMD) and cocoa pods (high lignin, high DMD).
   The xylose: arabinose ratio, an indicator of hemicellulose digestion,
   was higher in the legumes than in the by-products. The ratio of rapidly
   degradable (arabinose+glucose) to slowly degradable (xylose+uronic
   acids) sugars was not a good indicator of cell wall digestion; the
   correlation with 48 h NDF degradability (NDFD) was only 0.69. Cluster
   analysis showed that conventional classification of the feeds into
   by-products and legumes did not reflect their compositional or
   degradability attributes. These attributes were also poorly related to
   each other. Two unusual feeds were identified, cocoa pods and palm
   kernel cake.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The ability to accurately measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is
   essential to gauge our ability to reduce these emissions. Enteric
   methane from ruminants is an important but often difficult source to
   quantify since it depends on the amount and type of feed intake.
   Unfortunately, many of the available measurement techniques for
   estimating enteric methane emissions can impose a change in feed intake.
   Our study evaluates a nonintrusive technique that uses a novel approach
   (point-source dispersion with multiple open-path concentrations) to
   calculate enteric methane emissions from grazing cattle, reported as the
   major source of GHG in many countries, particularly Australia. A scanner
   with a mounted open-path laser was used to measure methane concentration
   across five paths above a paddock containing 18 grazing cattle over 16
   d. These data were used along with wind statistics in a dispersion model
   (WindTrax) to estimate an average herd methane emission rate over 10-min
   intervals. Enteric methane emissions from the herd grazing a combination
   of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Kunth) and Leucaena {[}Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.)] averaged (+/- SD) 141 (+/- 147) g animal(-1) d(-1).
   In a release-recovery experiment, the technique accounted for 77\% of
   the released methane at a single point. Our study shows the technique
   generates more reliable methane emissions during daytime (unstable
   stratification).},

Abstract = {Aims: Pathogenicity of Exobasidium vexans, causal agent of blister
   blight of tea, was studied in 30 commercially cultivated tea varieties
   by analysing the antigenic patterns of host and pathogen using
   immunological techniques.
   Methods and Results: Whole plant inoculation of tea varieties with E.
   vexans showed that T-78 and T-17/1/54 were most susceptible and most
   resistant respectively. Antigen preparations from tea varieties,
   pathogen, nonpathogen (Fusarium oxysporum) and of nonhosts (Glycine max,
   Leucaena leucocephala and Oryza sativa) were compared by indirect
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and dot-immunobinding assay using
   polyclonal antibodies raised against the pathogen, nonpathogen,
   susceptible and resistant tea varieties. Cross-reactive antigens (CRA)
   were found among susceptible varieties and E. vexans isolates but not in
   resistant varieties, nonhosts or nonpathogen. Indirect staining of
   antibodies using fluorescein isothiocyanate indicated CRA were
   concentrated mainly around epidermal and mesophyll cells in compatible
   host (T-78). This was substantiated by ultrastructural studies using
   gold-labelled antibodies through transmission electron microscopy which
   showed specific localization in the chloroplasts and host cytoplasm.
   Conclusions: Pathogenicity of E. vexans to different tea varieties is
   therefore related to the level of antigenic similarity between host and
   pathogen.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Immunological methods proved to be
   valuable in screening commercially cultivated tea varieties against E.

   in the East Nusa Tenggara region. Species popular among the local
   farmers are Acacia angustissima, Acacia leucophloea, Acacia nilotica,

   Sesbania grandiflora, Sesbania sesban, and leucaena hybrids KX1, KX2,
   and KX3. Most of the smallholders of East Nusa Tenggara have integrated
   food crops, plantation crops, forage crops, and livestock into their
   farming systems. In these systems, the arable land is used for food and
   plantation crops, while the land unsuitable for crops is set aside for
   communal grazing and forage production. Soil fertilty is ensured by
   returning the farmyard manure to the soil, green manuring, and
   fallowing. The land is protected by shrubs and trees planted as Live
   fencing, live terrace, and shade, The woody material from shrubs and
   trees is used for firewood and fencing. The stocking rate is maintained
   by retaining only the younger animals and selling off the others during
   periods of feed shortage. Fodder is generally produced in perennial
   systems such as companion cropping, alley cropping, intensive feed
   garden, fodder bank, live fencing, homestead garden, improved pasture,
   and multi-strata forage systems.},

Abstract = {A study on coppicing capability of some tropical trees, including
   Leucaena leucocephala, Gmelina arborea, Tectona grandis and Pileostigma
   malabaricum var. acidum, was undertaken with particular emphasis placed
   on their initial sprout growth and the factors affecting the production
   of sprouts in Mindanao Island, the Philippines.  The growth of sprouts
   of these species was so outstanding:  it was 5-10 m in height and 4-6 cm
   in diameter in the first year.  This could lead to shorten the rotation
   period to a greater degree compared with temperate trees, provided that
   the site for coppicing is adequately selected.  A stump size was
   recognized to have a positive effect on the initial growth of sprouts. 
   This suggests that larger trees may be cut to produce more and larger
   sprouts.  A reciprocal relation existed between the sprout growth and
   the sprout density regarding the stump of G. arborea and T. grandis.  On
   the basis of this relationship, a threshold density of sprouts was
   estimated in order to identify appropriate criteria in conducting a
   sprout thinning on a given stump.  Concerning the cutting system, a
   clear-cutting or a heavy crown thinning would be suitable for producing
   larger and healthier sprouts to reproduce the stands.},

Abstract = {Artificial soil is often sprayed onto cut slopes alongside railroad
   tracks to promote revegetation. This study evaluated the heavy metal
   content and the distribution of heavy metal chemical fractions in the
   soil, as well as the uptake of heavy metals by plants. The soil at four
   sites was determined to be considerably contaminated with Cd and Pb. The
   concentrations of Cd and Pb increased with the length of time the
   railway had been in use and decreased further away from the railway
   tracks. Pb primarily existed in reducible form but as residual
   fractions, whereas Cd was predominantly in exchangeable form. A
   correlation analysis indicated that pH, organic matter, and total
   phosphorus levels were important factors affecting the distribution of
   the heavy metal chemical fractions. The amounts of exchangeable Pb and
   Cd in the soil were highly correlated with their amounts in the plants
   sampled, indicating that the exchangeable fraction is a better
   indication of heavy metal phytoavailability than the total amount of
   heavy metals in the soil. Bioaccumulation and translocation factors
   indicated that Indigofera amblyantha had moderate tolerance and
   bioaccumulation capability for Pb, as did Leucaena leucocephala for Cd.
   These two plant species can serve as ideal slope remediation plants. (C)

Abstract = {The examination of root architecture and mechanical properties of
   tropical plants are limited. Thus, this study was aimed at investigating
   root architectural and mechanical properties of seven tropical plants.
   Based on root growth pattern, it was observed that Leucaena leucocephala
   and Pterocar pusindicus had taproots and their lateral roots grew
   horizontally and profusely. Therefore, the root systems of L.
   leucocephala and P. indicus were categorised as VH-type and the trees
   were recommended for planting in the middle of the slope. Peltophorum
   pterocarpum and Acacia mangium exhibited R-and H-types root systems
   respectively and were also recommended for planting in the middle of the
   slope. Melastoma malabathricum, Dillenia suffruticosa and Lantana camara
   possessed shallow roots. Their root systems were more similar to the
   M-type and these plants were suggested for planting at the top or toe of
   the slope. Leaf area index and root biomass of the species were
   positively correlated (r(2) = 0.90). Tensile strength decreased with
   increasing root diameter, implying that lower root diameter contributed
   to the higher tensile strength. Different plants have different types of
   root architecture and tensile strength. These rooting characteristics
   can be used as important factors in selecting potential plants for slope

   made by substituting 15 or 30\% of SBM protein with either Moringa or
   Leucaena. Dry matter, protein, and lipid digestibility decreased with
   increasing Moringa or Leucaena in the diet. Protein and lipid
   digestibility were high across diets (75-90\%). Ash digestibility of the
   control diet was similar to that of both Moringa diets, while the ash
   digestibility of the Leucaena diets was lower than other diets. Overall,
   nutrient digestibilities of Moringa diets exceeded those of Leucaena
   diets. Dry matter, protein, and lipid digestibilities decreased with
   increasing dietary fiber, which increased with increasing leaf meals.
   Ash digestibility was generally low for all diets. Better digestibility
   of practical diets containing Moringa compared to Leucaena indicates
   greater potential for Moringa to replace SBM in Nile tilapia diets

Abstract = {This research was to evaluate the effect of Leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in diets for bovines
   on ruminal metabolism, including pH, volatile fatty acids, and ammonia
   and methane production. Four crossbred male cattle (800 kg LW) rumen
   cannulated were distributed to a 4 x 4 Latin Square design, in 2 x 2
   factorial arrangement, composed by two levels of Leucaena (20\% and 50\%
   DM) and coast-cross grass hay, with or without yeast. No differences
   were observed in rumen pH (mean 6.82) and ammonia concentrations that
   varied from 18.71 to 21.28 mg/100 mL of ruminal fluid. There was
   interaction between Leucaena levels and yeast in the total
   concentrations of VFA. No differences were observed in the
   concentrations of acetic acid, but the animals fed 50\% of Leucaena with
   yeast showed higher propionic acid concentration (19.14 mM). Methane
   emissions were reduced by 12.3\% in relation to the same diet without
   yeast and in 17.2\% when the animals were fed 20\% of Leucaena with
   yeast. There was a noticeable associative effect of Leucaena when fed in
   high level (50\% DM) and yeast in the reduction of methane emission and
   better rumen fermentation with possible reduction of energy loss and
   better energy efficiency for the animals.},

Abstract = {The in situ digestibility of crude protein (CP) and effective
   degradability of CP (EDCP) in leaves of seven browse species growing in
   northeastern Mexico are reported. Leaves of Acacia berlandieri, Acacia
   greggii, Acacia rigidula, Cercidium macrum, Desmanthus virgatus,
   Leucaena leucocephala and Zizyphus obtusifolia were collected during
   summer (September 12, 1992), fall (Nov 12, 1992), winter (Feb 20, 1993),
   and spring (May 22, 1993) tin Marin, County, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
   Medicago sativa hay was used for comparison. Twelve rumen cannulated
   male (Pelibuey x Rambouillet) sheep (45 kg BW) were used (4 sheep per
   plant species) to incubate nylon bags (5x10 cm; 53 mm pore size), each
   containing 4 g of ground material (1 mm screen). Bags were incubated for
   0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h. EDCP values were high in winter and spring,
   but low in summer and fall. Plants such as C. macrum (63\% annual mean),
   L. leucocephala (64\%), D. virgatus (60\%), A. greggii (63\%), and
   Zizyphus obtusifolia (64\%) had EDCP values comparable to M. sativa hay
   (64\%). Even though high levels of lignin and condensed tannins in
   leaves affected the EDCP, all species tested - A. rigidula and A.
   berlandieri excepted- may be considered as good available protein
   supplements for grazing ruminants in northeastern Mexico and southern
   Texas, USA.},

Abstract = {Casuarina equisetifolia, Albizia procera, Eucalyptus robusta and two
   varieties of Leucaena leucocephala (K8 and P.R.) were grown for 5.5
   years in an experimental plantation in the Lajas Valley of Puerto Rico
   (18-degrees-N, 67-degrees-W). Rates of biomass accumulation were high,
   resulting in correspondingly high rates of nutrient accumulation in
   harvestable biomass. A comparison among species and among tissue types
   within species indicated that nutrient-use efficiency for N, P, K, Ca
   and Mg varied widely among species (ranging up to 10-fold differences)
   and tissues (up to 15-fold). With the highest growth rate, Casuarina was
   most efficient in using nutrients (N, P, K and Mg) to build biomass.
   With a quarter of Casuarina's growth rate, Leucaena K8 was the least
   efficient (N, K, Ca and Mg). For most of the studied nutrients, stem
   wood and large branches were the most nutrient-efficient tissue,
   followed by small branches, bark and then leaves. Nutrients stored in
   the litter layer below these species varied up to three-fold among
   species. Using a variety of species and biomass harvest scenarios, this
   study demonstrated the potential for significant alterations in the high
   rates of nutrient removal associated with short-rotation, intensively

Abstract = {Microbial biomass and activity are useful indices for assessing changes
   in soil ecosystems. The impact of different pastures on microbial
   biomass and activity was studied in a long-term experiment in Northeast
   Brazil. For our study the pastures were divided into plots: a)
   Brachiaria brizantha; b) Leucaena leucocephala; c) Cynodon dactilon; d)
   Panicum maximum. An adjacent area with native vegetation was used as
   reference. Soil samples were collected in 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths. No
   significant differences in soil organic C (C-org) was found among all
   plots at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depth. Soil microbial C (C-mic) values were
   higher in native forest and P maximum when compared to the other plots.
   The soil basal respiration (CO2) values were similar among all plots
   evaluated. However, respiratory quotients (qCO(2)) were significantly
   lower in native forest and P. maximum when compared to other plots, at
   0-10 cm depth. Values of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis were
   significantly higher in native forest and P maximum, while values of
   dehydrogenase activity were found to be significantly higher in native
   forest, C. dactilon and P maximum. Soil microbial biomass and activity
   changed when a native forest was converted to pastures. These changes
   were positive with the inclusion of maximum by the high input of C

Abstract = {Post-dispersal seed removal is crucial for maintaining plant recruitment
   by influencing secondary dispersal and the mortality of seeds. However,
   data on seed removal in the northern savanna of Ghana is scarce. In this
   study, we applied a rapid assessment method to examine the effect of
   three habitat types (conventional farmland, agroforestry parkland, and
   woodland) and two seed species (Leucaena leucocephala and Faidherbia
   albida) on seed removal by invertebrates and vertebrates in an
   agricultural landscape using selective exclosures in Nyankpala, a town
   located in the northern savanna of Ghana. The exclosures, closed and
   open, were designed to impose restrictions that allow either
   invertebrates or both invertebrates and vertebrates access to seeds.
   Using a generalized linear mixed modelling approach, we showed that
   habitat type and seed species significantly influenced the rate of seed
   removal, with the woodland habitat and F. albida seeds recording the
   highest removal rates. Our results suggest that invertebrates often
   dominated seed removal events compared to vertebrates, possibly due to
   differences in allometry and morphological traits and their effect on
   seed preference. This study adds to the growing evidence that savanna
   habitats and fauna play a critical role in maintaining plant population
   dynamics through seed predation and dispersal events.},

Title = {Quelites in poultry feed},
Journal = {TERRA LATINOAMERICANA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {41},
Abstract = {In traditional poultry farming, the consumption of fresh plants is an
   important part of the diet and a fundamental component of the indigenous
   poultry raising technique. Therefore, the objective is to know the
   studies that have included some quelites for feeding domestic birds.
   Quelite is a term used to refer to edible tender plants which are used
   as a whole plant, sprouts, branches, leaves, petioles, stems or flowers.
   The present review will consider the quelites Amaranth (Amarantus sp.),
   Chepil (Crotalaria longirostrada), Epazote (Dysphania ambrosioides),
   Blackberry (Solanum americanum), Holy grass (Piper autitum), Guaje
   (Leucaena leucocephala), Huazontle (Chenopodium berlandieri subsp.
   nuttalliae) and Purslane (Portuca olerecea). Nutritional and
   nutraceutical characteristics of these chelites are presented. In tests
   of egg and meat production, both in hens and in native turkeys, the main
   results of these studies are presented. The use of quelites in poultry
   farming has begun to be tested in order to reduce production costs,
   without af fecting the productive variables or the quality of eggs or
   meat. Although contradictory information has been reported, there is
   enough evidence to continue this line of study. It is proven that
   quelites have different nutritional and nutraceutical properties, which
   are intended to be used in favor of producers and consumers; however,
   much research is lacking.},

Abstract = {Traditional fruit homegardens are units of production of high richness
   of species with value in use. The objective was to analyze the
   relationship between the arboreal structure of 30 homegardens of
   Coatetelco, Morelos and the value in use of the species. The structure
   was quantified through the Importance Value Index (IVI). The Cultural
   Value Index (CVI) identified the preference of the community. The
   arboreal variety includes 24 botanical families, 49 genera and 65
   species; 45 \% were introduced and 55 \% were native of America from
   which 23 \% belonged to dry tropical deciduous forest. Ecologically and
   culturally, the most important species are the multiple use ones
   (Leucaena leucocephala, and L. esculenta), self-supply and sale ones
   (Mangifera indica, and Citrus x aurantium), and the ones produced during
   dry season (Spondias purpurea and Pithecellobium dulce). The size of
   homegardens, specific richness and density are positively related.
   Importance value and cultural value index correlated 86 \%. The
   structure of the homegardens was organized because of cultural reasons.
   The preferred species are the ones with the highest value in use. Native
   trees such as Amphipterygium adstringens, Swietenia humilis, Jacaratia
   mexicana, Enterolobium cyclocarpum and also some other species
   introduced as Citrus maxima, Ficus carica and Moringa oleifera which

Abstract = {Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) conventionally involve highly concentrated
   sulphuric acid, which typically resulted in the formation of undesirable
   by-products. Although less corrosive mineral acids have been explored as
   alternatives, high concentrations are still required. In this study, CNC
   was successfully isolated from Leucaena leucocephala wood using mild
   sulphuric acid with acetic acid as protic solvent, and it was further
   studied with the addition of Lewis acids in the form of multivalent
   transition metal salts as co-catalyst. Selected divalent and trivalent
   transition metal salts including (Cr(NO3)3, Fe(NO3)3, Co(NO3)2, and
   Ni(NO3)2) were investigated. The morphology, chemical structure,
   particle size, and physicochemical properties of the CNCs were
   determined. Controlled depolymerization of cellulose was observed using
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Rod-like morphology for all CNCs
   was obtained during the hydrolysis process with the smallest CNC
   particles found at an average length of 278.1 +/- 35.1 nm and a diameter
   of 13.4 +/- 3.0 nm. The results showed that higher valence state metal
   ions resulted in better cellulose hydrolysis efficiency. In addition,
   the use of transition metal salt as a co-catalyst improved production
   efficiency and minimised carbonization of CNC while maintaining desired
   crystallinity and thermal properties.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A bioengineering technique is gradually being used as an alternative for
   slope stabilisation design. The effect of vegetation on soil strength,
   particularly in terms of root reinforcement aspects has therefore become
   a major interest. However, there is a lack of documentation on the root
   mechanical properties available especially in Malaysia. In this study,
   both pull-out and tensile strength of two tropical trees namely Leucaena
   leucocephala and Acacia mangium were investigated on different stem
   sizes. L. leucocephala performs the higher pullout strength than A.
   mangium. The results also show that pullout resistance is much affected
   by the root than the shoot profiles. In terms of tensile strength, the
   tensile strength decreases with increasing root diameter, implying the
   finer root diameter contribute to the higher tensile strength. In both
   parameters, L. leucocephala exhibits the highest value. The study
   suggests that L. leucocephala has an added value as a good potential
   slope plant for slope stabilization work as it exhibits outstanding root
   mechanical properties. Interestingly, the results also showed that the
   pullout force was much affected by the tensile strength. It can be
   concluded that some root and shoot properties do have a great impact on
   root mechanical properties such as tensile and pullout strengths.},

Abstract = {P>1. Conventional cattle ranching with low plant diversity and a high
   dependence on chemical fertilisers and herbicides, simplifies ecosystems
   and negatively affects their functioning. In tropical regions, the
   cattle ranching systems that use fodder trees and shrubs along with
   grasses offer a useful landscape management tool that may contribute to
   the conservation of biodiversity and the stability of ecological
   processes.
   2. Given the functional importance of dung beetles in natural and
   anthropogenic ecosystems, this study evaluates the recovery of some of
   the ecological services in which these insects play a role by comparing
   treeless improved pastures (IP) with those that have been converted into
   silvopastoral systems (SPS: two species of grass, Cynodon plectostachyus
   and Pannicum maximum, in association with Leucaena leucocephala trees)
   in a cattle ranching landscape of the Colombian Andes.
   3. The results reveal an increment in the abundance of dung beetles in
   SPS and, as a consequence, an increase in dung, soil and seed removal,
   as well as a reduction in the number of adult flies and their larvae
   compared with IP.
   4. This suggests that SPS offer suitable refuges for the dung beetle
   fauna that complement the role of protected forest remnants, riparian
   forests and live fences in conserving the integrity of key ecological
   processes in cattle ranching landscapes.},

Abstract = {The fermentation of Pennisetum purpureum, alone (PP) or substituted with
   0.30 of the tanniferous legumes Acacia cornigera (AC), Albizia
   lebbekoides (AL), Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and the saponin-rich
   Enterolobium cyclocarpum (EC) was studied in vitro, in presence or
   absence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as tannin binder. Inactivation of
   tannins with PEG increased (p < 0.05) gas production with AL and LL from
   8 and 12 h to the end of the incubation period respectively. When PEG
   was added, LL and AC promoted a higher (p < 0.05) gas volume than PP in
   the first 12 h incubation, and there were not differences between PP and
   AL. Substrate mixtures reduced (p < 0.05) methane volume produced
   compared with PP, but this was not related to PEG inclusion (p > 0.10).
   There was a trend (p = 0.06) for a higher 48 h bacterial attachment to
   the substrate when incubated without PEG. The decrease in fermentation
   of EC from 12 h incubation onwards could be associated with a negative
   mid-term effect of saponins over cellulolytic bacterial activity. It is
   concluded that the effects of tannins on microbial fermentation of mixed
   forage substrates are variable, depending on their nature, but do not
   have a marked impact on bacterial adhesion or methane production.},

Abstract = {We examined the diet of 2 island-dwelling phyllostomids, the brown
   flower bat (Erophyfla sezekorni) and the Greater Antillean long-tongued
   bat (Monophyllus redmani), by analyzing fecal contents and pollen swabs
   from > 100 individuals of each species. Although both bats are putative
   nectar-feeders, their feeding niches were differentiated. A greater
   proportion of M. redmani (9 1 \%) consumed nectar compared with E.
   sezekorni (50\%), but the reverse was true for fruits (22\% versus 85\%,
   respectively); about 75\% of both species included insects in their
   diets. However, insect Consumption in E. sezekorni was dominated by
   coleopterans, whereas in M. redmani, diet was more diverse and included
   soft-bodied prey, Such as lepidopterans and dipterans. Both species
   consumed fruits of Panama berry (Mutingia calabura) and elder (Piper
   aduncum), but E. sezekorni also included turkey berry (Solanum torvum).
   When consuming nectar, E. sezekorni often fed at flowers Of guava
   (Psidium guajava), C, whereas M. redmani visited flowers of guava,
   woman's tongue (Albizia lebbek), myrtle (Eugenia), and wild tamarind
   (Leucaena leucocephala). Interspecific differences in diet are
   consistent with published differences ill craniodental and wing (flight)
   characteristics. The more diverse diet of M. redmani and its lesser
   reliance oil fruit may allow it to survive stochastic events, Such as
   hurricanes, and recover more quickly than Populations of E. sezekorni.},

Abstract = {The potential of Stenotaphrum secundatum (buffalo grass) as a forage
   species for ruminants is reviewed. Buffalo grass has been used as a
   pasture grass to a limited extent in Florida, the Caribbean, the Pacific
   Islands and Australia. From agronomic and animal production data, it is
   concluded that buffalo grass has value as a pasture grass for shaded,
   humid-tropical environments in developing countries, where smallholders
   require a robust, persistent grass. Considerable genetic variation
   exists within the species with the sterile triploid types showing
   greatest potential for grazing. Dry matter productivity is only moderate
   but buffalo grass is tolerant of a wide range of edapho-climatic
   conditions. Its moderate nutritive value can be improved by combination
   with legumes such as Leucaena leucocephala, Arachis pintoi cv. Amarillo,
   Aeschynomene americana cv. Glenn and Desmodium spp. Animal production
   from buffalo grass is highly sensitive to stocking rate. It has been
   well adopted by smallholders grazing cattle under coconuts in the
   Pacific Islands because of its ease of establishment and tolerance of
   long-term heavy grazing. The ability of buffalo grass to form a dense,
   stable and weed-free sward under heavily shaded and heavily grazed
   conditions makes it worthy of consideration for grazing under plantation
   crop systems.},

Abstract = {1. The effect of including Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) leaf meal
   (LLM) in broiler diets was investigated employing LLM at 0, 50, 100, 150
   and 200 g/kg diet. Experiments were also conducted to investigate
   whether reduced food intake of diets containing LLM is responsible for
   the growth depression.
   2. LLM appears to be a good source of protein and calcium.
   3. Food intake was not significantly affected (P < 0.05) with dietary
   LLM inclusion up to 200 g/kg. 4. Inclusion of LLM up to 150 g/kg diet
   did not influence significantly (P < 0.05) the performance of broilers
   in terms of body weight gain and food efficiency. However, inclusion of
   LLM at 200 g/kg diet had an adverse effect on weight gain and food
   efficiency, when compared to other dietary treatments. The profitability
   over food costs was low with the 200 g LLM/kg diet compared to those of
   other diets.
   5. It may be inferred from these experiments that LLM can safely be
   included in broiler diets up to 150 g/kg.
   6. Studies using force-feeding and restricted feeding techniques
   indicated that reduced food intake was not responsible for the growth
   depression in diets containing higher amounts of LLM.},

Abstract = {In northwest Cambodia, the majority of smallholder households own
   livestock. Poor consistency in feed supply throughout the year is a
   major constraint to livestock performance. Another critical challenge,
   livestock roaming in the dry season for forage, results in smallholders
   having few options to protect any post-rice dry season cropping activity
   from free-ranging animals. Living fences have the potential to address
   both these challenges, by providing high-quality feed for livestock
   throughout the year, while also serving as a barrier to protect the land
   from livestock grazing. A mixed-methods approach was used with
   communities in Battambang Province, including household surveys, a
   fodder production experiment, a cattle feeding trial, farmer training
   and data on dissemination and adoption. Results showed that living fence
   species, such as Leucaena leucocephala, can produce 2.5 kg of fresh
   weight per week per 100 trees during the dry season. This biomass volume
   is sufficient to supplement cattle diets so that a smallholder can
   sustain a small percentage weight gain in cows throughout the dry
   season. Critical challenges, including land tenure, physical access to
   paddy lands, and the gendered nature of these farming systems, remain
   for realizing private benefit on paddy lands culturally considered
   public in the dry season.},

Abstract = {Cattle rearing under coconut is a popular farming system in Sri Lanka. A
   constraint of this system is the scarcity of pasture herbage during the
   dry season. This paper discusses the results of studies on integrating
   nitrogen fixing fodder trees with pasture grasses. In an experiment,
   inclusion of Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) between the coconut rows
   and Gliricidia sepium (gliricidia) along the fence produced a fresh
   fodder yield of 9.5 t/ha/year. This fodder, mixed with urea-treated rice
   straw, was adequate to feed four local x Jersey crossbred cattle during
   the dry season without giving concentrates. Animals raised with the
   improved feeding system recorded liveweight gains ranging from 300 to
   600 g/head/day and produced 5.21 milk/day. Furthermore, the coconut
   yield increased by 15\% because of the improvement in the soil fertility
   and nutrition of the palm. In another experiment, gliricidia and
   Calliandra calothyrsus (calliandra) performed well under mature coconut
   plantations, whereas leucaena was more suitable for young plantations.
   In a feeding trial, incorporation of gliricidia with pasture herbage
   improved feed intake of cattle during the wet season. The resultant
   liveweight gain of crossbred cattle was about 700 g/head/day. Among the
   nitrogen fixing trees (NFTs) studied, gliricidia showed the highest
   potential as a fodder species.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated a 5-year-old riparian forest in an
   anthropogenically affected region along the Das Velhas River in
   southeastern Brazil, restored with the purposes of erosion control and
   other ecosystem functions and to monitor indicators of structure and
   composition. The forest was monitored via data collection of the
   diameter and height of trees for phytosociological analysis, including
   the identification of species and their classification with regard to
   life form, origin, weed-status, and successional stage. The forest was
   not very structurally developed and, overall, 111 species were recorded
   consisting of 65.8\% herbs, 24.3\% trees, and 9.9\% other types of life
   forms. About 70.9\% of species were natives, 29.1\% exotics, and 65\%
   weeds. The high abundance of exotic species and weed species (some
   aggressive such as Leucaena leucocephala) of various life forms may
   negatively affect the restoration success in terms of seedling
   recruitment and diversity of native species, but may constitute a
   neutral or even positive accomplishment for erosion control (with
   species composition as a secondary effect). Results also reinforce the
   knowledge that choice of species for restoration must be in accordance
   with major local filters (e.g., floods), and areas within urban matrices
   may deserve special attention, including periodic management actions to
   control undesirable species.},

Abstract = {The toxicity effects of heavy metals (lead and cadmium) on germination,
   root length and dry biomass of tree species viz., Thespesia
   populneoides, Leucaena leucocephala and Delonex regia were evaluated.
   Cadmium was found to be more toxic than lead. The results further showed
   that dose response of heavy metals were inversely proportional to
   germination, root growth and dry biomass. The percentage germination and
   higher \% DFC values showed that the seeds of L. leucocephala were least
   affected by lead and cadmium toxicity while scoring the best germination
   response among the three tree species. Exposure to high concentration
   (125ppm) of Cd decreased the root size of L. leucocephala, T.
   populneoides and D. regia by 89.79, 71.8 and 62.26\% respectively.
   However, at the same concentration, lead inhibited the root growth
   (39.62\%) in case of D. regia while much higher reduction was observed
   for L. leucocephala and T. populneoides around 62.7\%. Furthermore, the
   \% phytotoxicity and tolerance index confirmed that D. regia appeared to
   be the most tolerant species whereas, T. populneoides and L.
   leucocephala were moderately tolerant and less tolerant species
   respectively against the Pb and Cd treatment. This study gives an
   insight to the possible mechanism of hypertolerance, signifying that

Abstract = {Twelve accessions of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan {[}L.] Millsp.) were grown

   after planting (MAP), the primary growth was cut to determine the effect
   of age at first pruning on stump survival and coppice regrowth, and also
   on total herbage yield in a 12-month pruning cycle. It was clear that a
   height of 3 m or more is adequate for pigeonpea to receive its first cut
   with only 10 \% stool mortalities. Cutting the primary shoot at 8 MAP
   (in the dry season) ensured greater stump survival and also stimulated
   rapid coppice shoot regrowth, indicating the advantage of coppicing in
   the dry season and also at maturity. The total leaf and wood dry matter
   (DM) production in a 12-month cycle is greatest if the primary shoot was
   first cut at 8 MAP. This suggests that allowing the trees to become
   established is beneficial in the pruning management of pigeonpea.
   Accessions 11563 and 11575 have the ability to produce 7 t/ha of leaf DM
   from two prunings when first cut at 8 MAP, and significantly

Abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by increased joint pain and
   stiffness, particularly in the morning, which requires medication for
   treatment. Our research described here was aimed to develop, evaluate,
   and optimize coated naproxen pellets for colon-specific delivery using
   the carboxymethyl Leucaena leucocephala gum for the chronotherapy of RA.
   The extrusion-spheronization process was used for the preparation of the
   pellets followed by coating in a fluidized bed processor with materials
   such as Eudragit (R) S 100 and L 100. An 11-run, 2-factor, 3-level,
   randomized full factorial design was used to analyze the impact on the
   responses by varying the levels of independent factors to obtain the
   optimized formulation. The drug release of all the formulation batches
   at the 4th hour varied from 1.24 to 17.22\% in the upper
   gastrointestinal (GI) tract; while the release of the drug at the 10th
   hour varied from 76.87 to 98.39\% at the colonic pH. Furthermore, it was
   observed that the optimized formulation exhibited an increased release
   of naproxen in the presence of cecal matter collected from rats. We
   suggest that the prepared optimized formulation of the coated pellets of
   naproxen shows promise for the chronotherapeutic treatment of early
   morning symptoms associated with RA.},

Abstract = {A study was undertaken to explore the phytotoxicity of volatile

   Bidens pilosa, Amaranthus viridis, Rumex nepalensis, and Leucaena
   leucocephala in order to assess its herbicidal activity. Dose-response
   studies conducted under laboratory conditions revealed that eucalypt
   oils (in concentration ranging from 0.0012 to 0.06 \%) greatly suppress
   the germination and seedling height of test weeds. At 0.06 \% eucalypt
   oil concentration, none of the seed of test weeds germinated. Among the
   weed species tested, A. viridis was found to be the most sensitive and
   its germination was completed inhibited even at 0.03\%. Not only the
   germination and seedling growth, even the chlorophyll content and
   respiratory activity in leaves of emerged seedlings were severely
   affected. In A. viridis chlorophyll content and respiratory activity
   were reduced by over 51\% and 71\%, respectively, even at a very low
   concentration of 0.06\%. These results indicated an adverse effect of
   eucalypt oils on the photosynthetic and energy metabolism of the test
   weeds. A strong negative correlation was observed between the observed
   effect and the concentration of eucalypt oil. Based on the study, it can
   be concluded that oil from E citriodora possess strong inhibitory

Abstract = {An alley cropping plot was established in 1990 on a degraded alfisol on
   sloping land at Ajibode village near the University of Ibadan, Nigeria.
   The influence of Glomus deserticolum on biomass production of three
   hedgerow trees i.e., Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Senna
   siamea, and their nutrient contribution to cassava Manihol esculenta in
   four consecutive cropping seasons were investigated. Inoculation only
   promoted hedgerow leaf-biomass and nutrient (N, P, and K). contribution
   to cassava and consequently cassava tuber yield in the second year but
   did not affect them afterwards despite increased AM infection. Tuber
   yield declined with succeeding cropping seasons in all plots except
   uninoculated plots with Senna where it showed 142\% and 11.5\% increases
   respectively at 2 and 3-months pruning regime when compared with the
   first year's yield. Biomass production increased marginally with age in
   all hedgerows with concomitant increase in leaf production depending on
   partitioning of assimilates between leaf and stem. Generally, hedgerow
   biomass diversion to leaf was higher at 2 than at 3-month pruning regime
   and was in the order Senna Gliricidia Leucaena. Hence, while Senna
   provides sustained adequate leaf mulch to cassava, pruning at quarterly
   interval during the first pruning year and at bimonthly intervals in
   subsequent years is also recommended.},

Abstract = {Plantations are important REDD+ strategies for increasing carbon
   sequestration while enhancing local livelihoods. Reforestation along
   roads and highways under participatory forest management in southwestern
   Bangladesh could contribute to REDD+. This study assessed the diversity
   and structure of roadside plantations in order to develop a basal area
   based generalized allometric model for estimating above-and below-ground
   tree biomass carbon in Southwestern Bangladesh. All woody plants with
   d.b.h. >= 2 cm were identified and their diameters measured in 108
   systematically selected zigzag plots of equal size (2x 10 m). A total of
   36 species in 17 families were recorded. Leguminosae accounted for 28\%
   of species and 94\% of the total estimated biomass carbon. We estimated
   a mean stem density of 4528 ha(-1), basal area of 52.6 m(2) ha(-1) and
   biomass carbon of 192.80 Mg ha(-1). Samanea saman, Dalbergia sissoo,
   Acacia nilotica, and Leucaena leucocephala accounted for most density,
   basal area, and carbon. We developed and validated three allometric
   models with equal strength (R-2 0.94-0.98) using generalized linear
   regression. Roadside plantations in Bangladesh can now surely
   participate in the UNFCCC's carbon mitigation and adaptation mechanism,
   but challenges to their long-term sustainability must be addressed. (C)

Abstract = {As part of an island-wide project to identify and eradicate potentially
   invasive plant species before they become established, a program of
   inventories is being carried out in the urban and agricultural zones of
   the four inhabited islands in Galapagos. This study reports the results
   of the inventory from Puerto Villamil, a coastal village representing
   the urban zone of Isabela Island. We visited all 1193 village properties
   to record the presence of the introduced plants. In addition,
   information was collected from half of the properties to determine
   evidence for potential invasiveness of the plant species. We recorded
   261 vascular taxa, 13 of which were new records for Galapagos. Most of
   the species were intentionally grown (cultivated) (73.3\%) and used
   principally as ornamentals. The most frequent taxa we encountered were
   Cocos nucifera (coconut tree) (22.1\%) as a cultivated plant and
   Paspalum vaginatum (salt water couch) (13.2\%) as a non cultivated
   plant. In addition 39 taxa were naturalized. On the basis of the
   invasiveness study, we recommend five species for eradication (Abutilon
   dianthum, Datura inoxia, Datura metel, Senna alata and Solanum
   capsicoides), one species for hybridization studies (Opuntia
   ficus-indica) and three species for control (Furcraea hexapetala,

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The Mesorhizobiun: loti R7A symbiosis island contains genes encoding a
   VirB/D4 type IV secretion system (T4SS) similar to that of Agrobacterium
   tumefaciens. This system has host-dependent effects on symbiosis that
   probably are due to translocation of two effector proteins, Msi059 and
   Msi061, into host cells. Here we report that, as in A. tume-faciens, the
   M. loti vir genes are transcriptionally regulated by a VirA/VirG
   two-component regulatory system. A virGN54D mutant gene of M. loti
   caused constitutive expression of lacZ reporter gene fusions to virB1,
   virD4, msi059, and msi061. Expression of these gene fusions also was
   activated by a NodD gene product from Rhizobium legumino-sarum in the
   presence of the inducer naringenin, as was a virA::lacZ fusion. This
   activation was dependent on a nod box present 851 bp upstream of virA,
   and a mutant with the nod box deleted formed effective nodules on
   Leucaena leucocephala, the same symbiotic phenotype as other M. loti vir
   mutants. In contrast, the wild-type strain formed small, empty nodules
   whereas a nodD1 mutant was completely Nod(-). These results indicate
   that the M. loti vir genes are induced in a symbiosis-specific manner
   that involves a two-tiered regulatory cascade, and that the vir
   effectors act after Nod factor during infection thread formation.},

Abstract = {A legume introduced into a new area will only form nodules and fix
   nitrogen if compatible rhizobia are present in the soil. Using 25 (60 in
   the case of Sesbania sesban) soils sampled from tropical areas of
   Africa, Asia and Latin America, we examined the nodulation of four
   agroforestry tree species (Calliandra calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium,
   Leucaena leucocephala and S. sesban), their symbiotic interactions with
   the native rhizobial populations, and some of the ecological indicators
   of rhizobial population dynamics. Rhizobial population sizes estimated
   by the legume species ranged from undetectable numbers to 3.16 x 10(4)
   cells per g of soil depending on the trap host species. Although C
   calothyrsus had the highest nodulation rate in the soils used,
   inoculation tests showed L leucocephala to be the most promiscuous
   species while G. sepium had the most effective symbiosis. S. sesban was
   the most specific for both nodulation and symbiotic effectiveness.
   Symbiotic effectiveness did not bear any close relationship with
   specific soil parameters, but rhizobial numbers were highly correlated
   with soil acidity, particle size and exchangeable bases. Soil acidity
   was also the main factor that was highly correlated With genetic

   in the order of Leucaena followed by Acacia and Hardwickia. The
   phosphate application improved the forage yield and P uptake and

   of soil by increasing field capacity and pore space and lowering the
   bulk density, P application to crops at increased rates also reduced the
   ill effects of radiation curtailment under tree canopy to some degree.

Abstract = {Saline and alkaline groundwater can be used for irrigation of pastures.
   Using leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Tarramba) and Rhodes grass

   {[}SAR], SAR 5-30), and alkaline (0-855 mg L-1 CaCO3 equivalent) water
   on seed germination was investigated, with seedling root growth also
   measured in leucaena. For leucaena, germination decreased at EC > 15 dS
   m(-1), but SAR at values of up to 30 had no effect on germination.
   Alkalinity was found not to influence germination of leucaena (up to 855
   mg L-1 CaCO3 equivalent). Germination of `Topcut' Rhodes grass was not
   reduced significantly with any EC, SAR or alkalinity treatment used in
   this study. Root growth in leucaena was inhibited by salinity > 5 dS
   m(-1), SAR > 5 and alkalinity (as CaCO3) > 24 mg L-1. It was found that
   the inhibition of root elongation of leucaena at high SAR values could
   be attributed to Ca deficiency, i.e. activity of Ca2+ at the root cell
   plasma membrane. Germination of leucaena and Topcut Rhodes grass was
   highly tolerant of the salinity and alkalinity found in alkaline and

Abstract = {Tanniferous plants represent a promising alternative for controlling
   gastrointestinal nematodes of small ruminants. This experiment evaluated
   the effects of extracts from the leaf and stem of Anadenanthera
   colubrina, Leucaena leucocephala and Mimosa tenuiflora on larval
   exsheathment of Haemonchus contortus in vitro and verified the role of
   tannins in this process. Third-stage larvae of H. contortus were
   incubated with extracts for 3 hours and were exposed to sodium
   hypochlorite solution. The extracts were tested at 300 mu g.mL(-1) and
   accompanied by controls: phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and polyvinyl
   polypyrrolidonc (PVPP). The larval exsheathment was evaluated for 60
   minutes, and the results were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis test (p <
   0.05). The six extracts blocked larval exsheathment. After PVPP
   addition, a tannin inhibitor, the exsheathment percentage was similar to
   the PBS (p > 0.05), except for L. leucocephala and M. tenuiflora leaf
   extracts. However, pre-incubation with PVPP of these two extracts
   significantly changed larval exsheathment when compared to the
   non-treated extracts (p < 0.05). These results suggest that A.
   colubrina, L. leucocephala and tenuiflora could be useful in
   gastrointestinal nematode control and that tannins are probably the main
   compounds involved in the observed effects. However, in vivo and
   toxicological studies should be conducted.},

Abstract = {As technologies to counter soil fertility decline, alley farming with
   Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium, annual short-season Mucuna
   pruriens var. Utilis fallowing, and perennial Acacia auriculiformis
   fallowing have been tested. With alley farming, timely pruning is a
   critical element in farmers' capacity to match on-station yield levels:
   55\% of the farmers who delayed pruning suffered about 60\% yield
   losses. Farmers are now comparing a new alley band concept, grouping
   trees in bands 20 m apart with Jive times less tree/crop competition.
   However, an improved planted fallow of A. auriculiformis to regenerate
   exhausted soils grew a great deal in popularity because of quick
   regeneration of yields and a profitable bonus of good quality firewood.
   Mucuna, which was grown by 15 farmers in 1987 for Imperata control, is
   now known by almost 100 000 farmers. The regular use for soil fertility
   enhancement is, however, hampered by the lack of known uses for mucuna
   products. We developed recently a farmer-applicable detoxifying method
   for mucuna seeds, allowing incorporation of protein-rich mucuna flour
   into main staple dishes in Benin. We highlight the essential impact of
   farmer interaction an the course of experimentation, results and

Abstract = {Adding biochar to excessive compost amendments may affect compost
   mineralization rate and nitrogen (N) availability. The objective of this
   371-day incubation study was to evaluate the effects of four proportions
   of woody biochar (0\%, 0.5\%, 1.0\%, and 2.0\%) from lead tree (Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de. Wit) biochar produced at 750 degrees C through
   dynamic mineral N and N mineralization rates in three rural soils (one
   Oxisol and two Inceptisols). In each treatment, 5\% poultry-livestock
   manure compost was added to serve as an excessive application. The
   results indicated that the biochar decreased available total inorganic
   nitrogen (TIN) (NO3--N+NH4+-N) by on average 6\%, 9\% and 19\% for
   0.5\%, 1.0\% and 2.0\% treatments, respectively. The soil type strongly
   influenced the impact of the biochar addition on the soil nitrogen
   mineralization potential, especially the soil pH and clay content. This
   study showed that the co-application of biochar and excessive compost
   benefited the agricultural soils by improving NO3--N retention in
   agroecosystems. The application of biochar to these soils to combine it
   with excessive compost appeared to be an effective method of utilizing
   these soil amendments, as it diminished the net N mineralization
   potential and reduced the nitrate loss of the excessive added compost.},

   chloroform and methanol (9: 1v/v) and vice versa for acetone. The degree
   of substitution (DS) values for the CTA's produced were nearly identical

   CTA skeleton ranged from 0.072 to 0.239 mu m for RWP and RN, and within
   the dimension scale of the CTA pinholes confirm the synthesis of CTA.
   Accordingly, pouring of the AP liquor at 25 degrees C in distilled water
   at the end of the acetylation and filtration did not hydrolyze the CTA

   Crotalaria ochroleuca (legume cover crop) and maize (Zea mays) in
   sequential cropping systems. Where no plant residues were applied,
   apparent utilization efficiency (AUE) of PR was 1.0\% in 1999 and 2.7\%
   in 2001. The AUE of PR was improved in many cases with the addition of
   plant residues. The AUE of PR in all treatments with plant residues was
   on average 3.4\% in 1999 and 6.2\% in 2001 with a pronounced effect from
   Flemingia and Gliricidia. Negative values of AUE were observed in
   treatments with Leucaena and maize stover in 1999, and Dactyladenia in
   2001. These results suggest that the choice of plant residues is an
   important step for using plant residues as PR amendment on the

   colored markings. Clutch size was 2-4, with a mode of two. Hatchlings
   were altricial with closed eyelids and devoid of natal down with dark
   gray to black skin. Nestlings examined prior to fledging resembled the
   adult plumage, except for the lack of the yellow supercilium found in
   adults. The nests and eggs have some characteristics similar to those of

Abstract = {Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) cv. Tarramba was first introduced to
   eastern Indonesia (East and West Nusa Tenggara Provinces) as part of an
   ACIAR project in 2001-2003. Its superior value was recognized
   immediately as it: was preferred by cattle over local leucaena; was less
   affected by psyllids; provided better dry season growth; and produced
   poles suitable for construction. In on-farm Bali bull feeding
   demonstrations, Tarramba leucaena doubled weight gains compared with
   traditional practices, enabling the most progressive farmers to win
   local bull-fattening competitions. Owing to strong demand for seed, the
   East Nusa Tenggara Assessment Institute for Agriculture Technology, in
   collaboration with the Provincial Livestock Department, assisted
   smallholders to establish seed orchards to ensure that professionally
   produced and packaged Tarramba seed was available for commercial sale.
   By the end of the ACIAR involvement, approximately 2,000 kg of Tarramba
   seed had been distributed to farmers, in addition to farmer-to-farmer
   seed sales. Approximately 800,000 ha of land in East Nusa Tenggara
   Province is suitable for Tarramba leucaena so the potential for this
   legume to contribute to beef production in the region is huge. Tarramba
   is now contributing to forage development in other parts of Indonesia as
   well as in Timor-Leste.},

   ellipsometric measurements. The influence of pH and ionic strength on
   the adsorption was investigated. A strong dependence of pH on the
   adsorbed amount of CFOX and LLOX was observed. At pH 4, there was a
   maximum in the adsorbed amount caused by strong electrostatic attraction
   between the substrate and the oxidized galactomannans. On the other
   hand, no ionic strength effect on the adsorption of CFOX and LLOX was
   observed. The immobilization of bovine serum albumin onto LLOX and CFOX
   was studied as a function of pH. LLOX proved to be a more attractive
   substrate for BSA than CFOX, indicating that the favorable interactions
   between the carboxylate groups and the BSA segments have driven the
   adsorption process. At the isoelectric point of BSA a maximum in the

   from L. leucocephala) possessed all the normal reactions of fast-growing
   rhizobia but had a single sub-polar flagellum, similar to the 3
   slow-growing strains studied. Certain combinations of amino acids and
   sugars (e.g., glutamine and galactose) induced an acidic reaction in the
   fast-growing organisms while the slow-growing ones changed the media to
   alkaline. Fast-growing organisms utilized more galactose for growth
   compared to slow-growing ones. Both types of organisms synthesized and
   released a wide range of amino acids into the medium. pH changes
   produced by rhizobia growing on yeast-extract mannitol media are caused
   by the preferential utilization of sugars by fast-growing organisms and

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to identify the species of pollen
   supplying plants that constitute the trophic niche of Melipona mandacaia
   in an urban area in the Caatinga domain (a tropical arid landscape). The
   collection of pollen in the colonies was carried out every 15 days, from
   October 2014 to September 2015. The pollen was removed directly from the
   storage pots in three distinct colonies. A total of 24 samples were
   analyzed and compared with the reference pollen collection, pollen
   catalogs and specialized literature. For the quantitative analysis, at
   least 1000 pollen grains per sample were identified. A total of 39
   pollen types were identified, distributed in 17 botanical families,
   being one an indeterminate type. The most represented family was the
   Fabaceae (n = 16). The most frequent types were Leucaena leucocephala,
   Mimosa pudica and Melochia sp. There was a significant positive
   correlation between temperature and the number of pollen types
   throughout the study. Relative humidity and rainfall were abiotic
   variables that did not present a significant correlation. The
   rarefaction curve showed that probably most of the pollen types
   collected by the bees studied were sampled, since the accumulation curve
   showed a progressive tendency to stabilization, indicating that there
   was sample adequacy of the pollen types. The analysis of similarity
   revealed a high sharing of pollen sources between colonies.},

Abstract = {Litterfall production and quality in pure and mixed fodder banks of
   Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. and Moringa
   oleifera Lam. were evaluated during the rainy and dry season, using a
   completely randomized block design with five treatments and four
   replications in densities of 10,000 and 20,000 plants.ha(-1). In each
   experimental unit, a 1.6 m(2) litter mesh collector was installed, and
   the litterfall was collected throughout one year. Dry weight was
   recorded by treatment and seasons to determine the fraction of N, C and
   P and the C:N ratio. The highest litterfall production was in the rainy
   season. L. leucocephala in monoculture and intercropped with G.
   ulmifolia showed the highest production with 1,022 and 1,542 kg
   DM.ha(-1).1yr(-1), respectively, and L. leucocephala had the highest
   total contributions of N, C, and P with 22.0, 443.0 and 0.96 kg

   amounts of N and C (23.2 and 363.8 kg DM.ha(-1).yr(-1). The greatest
   input of phosphorous was by L. leucocephala and G. ulmifolia (0.74 kg
   DM.ha(-1).yr(-1)). It was concluded that the association of species
   promotes greater litter production and nutrient intake compared with
   monocultures.},

Abstract = {The use of multipurpose trees (MPTs) as fodder for ruminants is
   increasing in the smallholder mixed farms in Kenya. Most of the MPTs
   contain tannins that are known to depress feed digestibility. A study
   was therefore undertaken to assess the effect of common forage tannins
   on total tract digestibility of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP)
   in ruminants. The effect of tannins from Leucaena leucocephala,
   Calliandra calothyrsus, and Gliricidia sepium on the total tract
   digestibility of the DM and CP was determined using ruminally and
   duodenally cannulated Holstein cows. Prior to digestion, half of the
   samples were treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to suppress the
   effect of tannin. Feed samples in nylon bags were suspended in the rumen
   for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 hours, one pair for each time. In addition,
   bags that had been incubated for 12 and 24 hours were introduced into
   the small intestine through a duodenal cannula and subsequently
   recovered from faeces. In the three fodder species, PEG increased
   effective degradation of DM and CP in the rumen, reduced the DM and CP
   reaching and subsequently digested in the intestine. Addition of PEG
   also increased the total tract digestibility of DM and CP. However, the
   increase was significantly more pronounced in Calliandra than in
   Leucaena and Gliricidia. Gliricidia was the least affected. Leucaena and
   Gliricidia can therefore be fed to ruminants without treatment.},

Abstract = {The effects of adding two legumes, Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena
   leucocephala, cv. Cunningham, and molasses on the fermentation
   characteristics of silages made from two tropical grasses (Pangola
   grass, Digitaria decumbens, and Setaria sphacelata cv. Kazungula) were
   investigated. Pangola grass silages contained significantly higher
   contents of water-soluble carbohydrates and lactic acid than did setaria
   silages after 100 days fermentation, but there were no significant
   differences between the two silages in populations of lactic acid
   bacteria and contents of total N and NH3-N. Addition of either species
   of legume had no significant effect on fermentation acids and NH3-N
   contents, and numbers of lactic acid bacteria. Addition of both legumes
   reduced NH3-N production in the silages by 59\% after 5 days'
   fermentation. Numbers of lactic acid bacteria were not significantly
   affected by the different treatments. Enterococcus faecalis represented
   60\% of the lactic acid bacteria isolated from the treated herbages
   prior to ensiling. By 100 days of fermentation, only lactobacilli were
   isolated: 82\% homo-fermenters and 18\% hetero-fermenters. Lactobacillus
   mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum was found only in the silage
   supplemented with 33\% (w/w) legume. It was concluded that the low
   quality of tropical grasses used as feeds for ruminants may be
   significantly improved by ensiling these grasses with small amounts of
   molasses and with high-protein tree leaves.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to identify and characterize rumen bacteria
   that are able to degrade the toxic compound, 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone
   (3,4 DHP), that is produced in the rumen from mimosine. Mimosine is a
   non-protein amino acid that is found in leaves and seeds of Leucaena
   leucocephala, a leguminous tree used as a forage crop for ruminants in
   the tropics, and degradation of 3,4 DHP by ruminal microbes is critical
   for protection of animals from leucaena toxicity. Microbes with this
   capacity are, however, not ubiquitous and microbial populations in the
   rumens of animals in some parts of the world are unable to metabolize
   3,4 DHP. Four strains of obligately anaerobic, gram-negative, rod-shaped
   bacteria that degrade 3,4 DHP were isolated from rumen contents from a
   goat in Hawaii. The isolates do not ferment carbohydrates, but are able
   to use both 3,4 DHP and its isomer, 3-hydroxy-2(1H)-pyridone (2,3 DHP),
   as well as arginine and histidine as substrates for growth. Comparisons
   of the 16S rRNA sequence from one of these isolates with sequences from
   a widely diverse group of bacteria agree with other information
   indicating that these isolates do not fit into any existing taxon. Thus,
   we are hereby proposing a new genus and species designation, Synergistes
   jonesii, for these organisms.},

Abstract = {Wild edible trees (WETs) play an important role in the diet of many
   rural communities. Therefore, research on their use and management is
   important to support both food sovereignty and local conservation of
   biocultural resources. We evaluated the different uses of WETs by the
   community of Zacualpan, Colima, in western Mexico, through 32
   semi-structured interviews registering the species richness, plant parts
   consumed, and non-food uses. Additional information was collected on
   their management, availability, and forms of preparation. We used a
   cultural salience index to determine the food importance of the WETs
   mentioned. We registered 33 edible tree species (26 wild, 3 native
   crops, and 4 exotic crops) that were most commonly consumed as fruits or
   seeds. WETs were also used for fuel, live fences, timber, handicrafts,
   medicine, shade, fodder, poles, utensils, construction, tanning, soap,
   and paper. Pithecellobium dulce had the highest food salience, followed
   by Spondias purpurea, Leucaena esculenta, Leucaena leucocephala,
   Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Jacaratia mexicana. Salient wild trees
   were collected in the wild and promoted in agroforestry systems. These
   trees provided food during the dry season and also had the highest
   number of additional uses. Promoting the biocultural value of WETs and
   their sustainable use can favor ecosystem conservation and local food
   sovereignty.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Month = {AUG 27},
Abstract = {The availability of local feed resources in various seasons can
   contribute as essential sources of carbohydrate and protein which
   significantly impact rumen fermentation and the subsequent productivity
   of the ruminant. Recent developments, based on enriching protein in
   cassava chips, have yielded yeast fermented cassava chip protein
   (YEFECAP) providing up to 47.5\% crude protein (CP), which can be used
   to replace soybean meal. The use of fodder trees has been developed
   through the process of pelleting; Leucaena leucocephala leaf pellets
   (LLP), mulberry leaf pellets (MUP) and mangosteen peel and/or garlic
   pellets, can be used as good sources of protein to supplement ruminant
   feeding. Apart from producing volatile fatty acids and microbial
   proteins, greenhouse gases such as methane are also produced in the
   rumen. Several methods have been used to reduce rumen methane. However,
   among many approaches, nutritional manipulation using feed formulation
   and feeding management, especially the use of plant extracts or plants
   containing secondary compounds (condensed tannins and saponins) and
   plant oils, has been reported. This approach could help todecrease rumen
   protozoa and methanogens and thus mitigate the production of methane. At
   present, more research concerning this burning issue - the role of
   livestock in global warming - warrants undertaking further research with
   regard to economic viability and practical feasibility.},

Abstract = {The spatial ecology of sloths was studied in an agricultural landscape
   in Limon Province, Costa Rica. Two sloth species, the three-toed sloth
   (Bradypus variegatus) and the two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni),
   actively used and traveled through a cacao agroforest and its contiguous
   living fence rows and riparian forests. This agroecosystem was embedded
   in an agricultural landscape dominated by banana and pineapple
   plantations and pastures with dispersed trees. The two-toed sloth (C.
   hoffmanni) was found in 101 tree species and used 34 for food; the
   three-toed sloth (B. variegatus) was found in 71 tree species and used
   15 for food. Choice of preferred species differed between the two sloth
   species. Trees commonly used by sloths for food and/or refuge in the
   cacao agroforest included Erythrina poeppigiana, Cecropia obtusifolia,
   Leucaena leucocephala; in the living fence rows, Cordia alliodora,
   Erythrina poeppigiana, Ocotea sinuata and Trophis racemosa; in the
   riparian forests, Coussapoa villosa, Cecropia obtusifolia, Hura
   crepitans, Pterocarpus officinalis and Spondias mombin; and in the
   pastures with dispersed trees, Cordia alliodora, Coussapoa villosa,
   Erythrina poeppigiana, Ocotea sinuata and Hura crepitans. This study
   demonstrates the importance of the cacao agroforest as well as arboreal
   elements in other land uses in providing resources for sloth

Abstract = {Rhizobium-legume symbioses are important for their nitrogen input, but

   Sixteen Rhizobium strains isolated from root nodules of Leucaena trees

   tolerance to salinity and in their symbiotic effectiveness with Leucaena
   leucocephala under saline conditions. Three strains were tolerant to
   >3\% NaCl. L. leucocephala grown in the greenhouse at concentrations of
   NaCl up to 1.0\% and inoculated either with strain DS 78 or strain DS
   158 displayed significantly better growth than those plants grown at the
   same levels of salinity and inoculated with reference strain TAL 583.
   Although nine of the Rhizobium strains grew at 42 degrees C, their mean
   generation times were lengthened two- to fourfold. When daylight growth
   temperatures were elevated from 30 degrees C to 42 degrees C, nodule
   number and mass, nitrogenase activities and shoot top dry weight of

   years, while the F-2 hybrids had intermediate levels of damage. Adult
   psyllid populations were positively correlated with plant damage
   (P<0.05) in 18 of 20 high psyllid-infestation periods, while nymph
   populations were positively correlated with damage (P<0,001) at all 20
   observations. Psyllid damage was positively correlated with edible dry
   matter (DM) and total DM for only 2 of 11 harvests. The lack of

Abstract = {The rhizosphere is an important interface for soil-plant interaction and
   a significant zone for the uptake and removal of heavy metals from
   soils. This study assesses the level of heavy metals contamination in
   the rhizosphere of plants growing at a decommissioned tailings dam in
   Ghana. Concentrations of heavy metals {[}Arsenic, Cadmium, Copper, Iron,
   Manganese and Zinc] and physicochemical parameters {[}pH, conductivity,
   total dissolved solids, phosphate, nitrate, sulfate] of rhizospheric
   soils were determined. The assessment of the extent of rhizospheric
   contamination was conducted using the enrichment factor (EF),
   geo-accumulation index (Igeo), and pollution load index (PLI). Factor
   analysis unveiled the most relevant heavy metal contributors to
   rhizosphere contamination. Results indicate moderate to significant
   enrichment of Cd (1.72 - 8.28) and Mn (1.70 - 8.32) in the rhizosphere.
   The PLI showed that rhizospheres are heavily polluted (18.8 - 29.6) and
   thus require remediation. Principal component analysis revealed
   significant Cd, As, and Fe contamination in the rhizosphere accrues from
   anthropogenic or mining activities. The levels of heavy metal ions in
   the rhizosphere suggest that Mimosa pudica, Centrosema pubescens,
   Leucaena leucocephala, Pueraria phaseoloides, and Tridax procumbens
   could be investigated as candidates for phytostabilization of mine
   tailings. This study emphasizes the importance of effective remediation
   and continual tailing dam monitoring before and after decommissioning to
   avert the spread of heavy metal contaminants.},

Title = {Alley farming: A sustainable technology for crops and livestock
   production},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {131-144},
Abstract = {Sustainable increase in agricultural production was achieved in the past
   through the use of bush-fallow farming system. Extensive land use due to
   urbanization, increase in population and high farming population has led
   to reduction in fallow period. As a consequence, rapid deterioration of
   soil structure and declining productivity constitute major problems of
   agricultural productivity. Amid the efforts for increase in agricultural
   productivity, many developing Countries are concerned about the
   environmental effects of agricultural technologies. The focus is on
   sustainable agricultural technologies that can increase yield as well as
   regenerate soil fertility without fallow. This was achieved through
   alley farming developed by researchers in the International Institute of
   Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, Nigeria. This paper examines the
   impact of alley farming on crops and livestock production. Surveys
   indicate that farmers are adopting the technology and that the initial
   adopters continue to use alley farming. Crops yield increased with alley
   farming and hedgerows reduced erosion and runoff. When prunings from
   Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium planted in alley farms were
   fed to cattle and ruminant animals, there was increased survival and
   body weight. Moreover, dairy cow milk production increased
   significantly.
   Constraints to alley farming adoption include lack of knowledge about
   its benefits and lack of money. The paper concludes with suggestions for
   effective extension of alley farming to enhance adoption.},

Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Pages = {199-220},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {High temperature and rainfall contribute in turning most of the slope
   soils acidic in countries like Malaysia. Acidic slope again contributes
   in a low plant coverage, high eroding potential and instability of
   slopes. In this context, this study aims at investigating the effects of
   pre-Aluminum treatment on the growth and development of selected plants
   on acidic slope. The acidic-tolerant characteristics of Acacia mangium,
   Leucaena leucocephala and Melastoma malabathricum were determined by
   subjecting them into pre-Aluminum treatment at germination phase. The
   results showed that M. malabathricum exhibited the highest morphological
   parameters; root length and dry weight partitioning and physiological
   performance including photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance,
   transpiration rate, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and leaf Aluminum analyses.
   Within ten weeks of observation, the Al-pretreated M. malabathricum
   showed the highest photosynthetic and transpiration rates as compared to
   L. leucocephala and A. mangium. Simultaneously, stomatal conductance was
   found to be the highest in M. malabathricum. Moreover, within ten weeks,
   soil pH planted with M. malabathricum increased by 23.8\% and was found
   to be the highest among the species studied, implying the rehabilitation
   capacity of this species. The Al-pretreated M. malabathricum also
   displayed the longest root length in acidic soil exhibiting a tolerance
   mechanism towards soil acidity. Amongst the species studied, M.
   malabathricum, either treated or non-treated, exhibited the best
   morphological and physiological performances on acidic conditions.},

Abstract = {In order to determine the relative productivity of 16 promising forage
   legumes (12 species, 8 genera) in two major environments of central
   Belize (a neutral heavy cracking clay on an upper river terrace, and an
   acid waterlogged sandy loam on the Low Pine Ridge coastal deposits),
   trials with three replicates were established and 12 harvests for dry
   matter were made at 6-week intervals. The high terrace site was a
   long-established pasture of Coastal Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon).
   The grass and weeds proved to be aggressive and dominated the legumes
   tested, such that many low and viney legumes died out. Codariocalyx
   gyroides, Crotalaria anagyroides and Leucaena leucocephala, which grew
   above the grass, had the best total yields. The Bermuda grass production
   was very poor in the cool and dry seasons. At the waterlogged savanna
   site there was little competition from the native grass Mesosetum
   angustifolium, but very little legume growth until fertilizer was
   applied. Thereafter, C. anagyroides and C. gyroides were very vigorous,
   yielding well through the dry season and producing substantially more in
   the last 9 months of the trial than the high river terrace site. The wet
   soil conditions permitted best legume growth in the dry season. The
   legumes generally were more productive than at the heavy clay site. M.
   angustifolium yields were very low throughout the trial, and
   particularly in the cool season.},

Abstract = {In order to ascertain the influence of supplemental iodine on nutrient
   utilisation by goats fed a leucaena leucocephala leaf meal containing
   diet, 8 adult male goats (2 years; 22.3+/-1.73 kg) were randomly
   allocated into two groups, viz, control and experimental. Both the
   groups were fed a diet comprising of wheat bran, leucaena leaf meal and
   wheat straw ad lib. In addition, the experimental animals were given
   extra iodine at 0.04 mg/head/day (as KI soln.). A metabolism trial of 6
   days duration conducted after 13 weeks of experimental feeding revealed
   that the daily DM intake (g/W-0.75) increased significantly due to
   iodine supplementation Similar was the case with the intakes of DCP and
   ME. The digestibility of CP and EE showed significant improvement in the
   experimental group while that of DM, OM and total carbohydrates did not
   vary significantly between the two groups. The animals of control group
   were in negative nitrogen balance, which improved significantly and
   become positive in the experimental group. Moreover, the control animals
   lose weight apparently in contrast to the experimental animals, who
   maintained their weights. While iodine supplementation tended to enhance
   phosphorus retention that of calcium exhibited significant improvement.
   Conclusively, provision of extra iodine to Leucaena containing diet may
   prove beneficial in augmenting the nutrient utilization of this protein
   rich tropical forage.},

Abstract = {A field trial on alley-cropping was conducted at the University of
   Ibadan research farm in the 1990/91 cropping season to assess the
   contributions of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and hedgerow woody
   legumes to the yield and nutrient uptake of cassava (Manihot esculenta
   Crantz) as an intercrop in an infertile soil. The trial also
   investigated the influence of AM fungi on the interplanting of a
   nonnodulating woody legume Senna siamea (syn. Cassia siamea) with a
   nodulating woody legume (Leucaena leucocephala).
   AM contributions to cassava were greater than the hedgerow
   contributions, which demonstrated that AM associations are an essential
   component in the nutrition of cassava. In contrast to cassava, AM
   inoculation only influenced the leaf dry weight and uptake of nutrients
   of non-interplanted woody legumes but not the above-ground biomass and P
   uptake of interplanted woody legumes. However, non-inoculated
   interplanted Leucaena benefited more from indigenous AM fungi than the
   competing Senna. The negative contributions to the nutrient uptake (K,
   Ca and ME) of cassava by hedgerows and the lack of response to AM
   inoculation in interplanted hedgerow woody legumes could be attributed
   to root competition among the different plant species growing in close
   proximity to each other. The present results show that cassava benefits
   more from AM association than Leucaena which in turn benefits more than
   Senna in an alley-cropping system.},

Abstract = {Soil and plant compositions have been affected by human activities in
   Imo watershed, southern Nigeria. The study examined the responses of
   soil and plants to changes in landscape under different land use. It was
   hypothesized that though forest had higher soil organic carbon (OC) and
   organic matter (OM), it was the most altered land use with substantial
   loss of biodiversity. Data were collected covering soil properties and
   plant compositions. Arable land (AL), forestland (FL), grassland (GL),
   shrubland hills (SL), urban built-up green (UL), Freshwater
   swamp-mangrove wetland (WL) and water bodies (WB) were classified as the
   main land use by using ArcGIS 10.1 and Food and Agricultural
   Organization (FAO) land-use classification system. One-way analysis of
   variance followed by post-hoc test was used to determine the mean
   differences in years and land use for various soil properties and plant
   parameters. Results revealed that soil nutrient concentrations decreased
   by at least 50\% across land use. Leucaena leucocephala, Vernonia
   amygdalina, Panicum maximum, Lablab purpreus, Vernonia nigritiana and
   Elaeis guineensis were dominant with high cover. Species diversity
   showed significantly negative correlations with species evenness and
   R-factor (p < 0.05), but positive correlations with total nitrogen and
   OM and OC (p < 0.001). To restore and increase soil and plant
   biodiversity, human activities need to be regulated by introducing

Abstract = {The chemical analysis of plants and soils is a frequently used approach
   in understanding a serpentine ecosystem. Studies on vegetation growth in
   serpentine soils focused on various plant species for remediation
   purposes of soil contamination with heavy metals, emphasizing their role
   in the metal extraction or stabilization in the soil. The aims of this
   study were to measure the concentrations of Cr, Mn, and Ni in the soils
   and plants and to elucidate the phytoremediation potential of the
   studied plants. This study was performed at an abandoned site of
   serpentine mining in eastern Taiwan. Seven plant species were collected
   for analysis of Cr, Mn, and Ni, including Crotalaria micans, Miscanthus
   floridulus, Leucaena leucocephala, Bidens pilosa, Pueraria lobata,
   Melilotus indicus, and Conyza canadensis. The Cr and Ni concentrations
   in all studied plants were higher than those in general plants. In all
   species, the mean concentrations of Cr, Mn, and Ni in the shoots were
   lower than those in the root. None of the collected specimens exhibited
   hyperaccumulation of Cr, Mn, and Ni. All studied species may be used to
   remediate contaminated soils through phytostabilization of Cr and Mn,
   whereas M. floridulus and M. indicus are appropriate plants for
   phytostabilization of Ni. However, C. micans, L. leucocephala, B.
   pilosa, P. lobata, and C. canadensis have the potential to remove Ni
   from contaminated soils for the purpose of phytoextraction.},

Abstract = {Four herbaceous (Aeschynomene histrix, Stylosanthese fruticosa,

   forage legumes (Cajanus cajan and Leucaena leucocephala) were tested in

   the Borgou region of Benin over 3 consecutive rainy seasons (2000-2002).
   Leaf and stem production were measured as well as crude protein, crude
   fibre, ash and mineral concentrations in leaves.
   The number of original plants surviving declined in all species except
   leucaena as the study progressed. Browse legumes produced more leaf
   material (including stems < 5 mm in diameter, mean of 4450 kg/ha DM)
   (P<0.05) than herbaceous legumes (mean of 2370 kg/ha). While leaf
   production of leucaena increased with time, that of the remaining
   species declined as the study progressed. The lowest production (P<0.05)
   was recorded for M. pruriens (1480 kg/ha DM).
   Leaf:stem ratio for the browse legumes (0.35-0.49:1) was lower (P<0.05)
   than for the herbaceous legumes (0.87-1.10:1). Leaf material for all
   species was an acceptable source of crude protein (16-28\% DM) to
   complement available forage on natural pastures and savarmahs,

Abstract = {This paper reports research that attempts to rehabilitate toxic Pb/Zn
   mine tailings, in Guangdong, China, to achieve a healthy functional soil
   that supports sustainable vegetation. We studied the effects of the
   earthworm Pheretima guillelmi on the growth of a woody legume Leucaena
   leucocephala on Pb/Zn mine tailings diluted with varying amounts of
   mineral soil in pot experiments. L. leucocephala grew successfully on
   tailings with a 25\% (w/w) soil amendment, but P. guillelmi only
   survived and actively burrowed with a 50\% soil amendment. The presence
   of earthworms improved the yield of plants by 10-30\%. Whilst earthworms
   marginally increased available N and P in soil, they increased uptake of
   phosphorus (by about 10\%) to above-ground plant tissues. Six-month-old
   plants were more sensitive than 10-month plants to metal stress. P.
   guillelmi increased bioavailable metal concentrations in the amended
   spoils, accompanied by a direct increase of metal uptake by the plants.
   Increased metal uptake by plants was largely due to the higher dry
   matter production stimulated by earthworm activity, but this increased
   the rate of metal uptake into plants from spoil by at least 16\% and as
   much as 53\%. These results demonstrate that we should broaden the
   ecological context of phytoremediation by considering the

Abstract = {The feed value of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and groundnut (Arachis
   hypogaea) crop residues were evaluated on growing male landim goats
   tethered on native pasture during the 1992 and 1993 dry seasons in
   semi-arid Southern Mozambique. Treatments were native pasture alone as a
   control, native pasture+cowpea residue ad libitum and native
   pasture+groundnut residue ad libitum. During the second year, treatments
   with (0.5\% liveweight (LW) on dry matter (DM) basis) or without fresh
   leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) leaves were superimposed on the three
   treatments. During the 1993 dry season, both the cowpea and the
   groundnut groups gained more weight (p=0.0002) than the control group.
   The situation changed in 1993, a year with dry season rains. The
   unsupplemented group lost weight only in November and only during this
   period did some positive effect of supplementation occur. Over the
   season, there was no effect (p=0.48) of either residue or leucaena
   supplementation. The ammonia-nitrogen concentrations in the rumen fluid
   of the control group, measured in the 1993 dry season, were depressed by
   the inclusion of groundnut hay and increased by cowpea supplementation.
   Leucaena also depressed the ruminal NH3 in the crop residue diets but
   increased NH3 in the control group. The conclusion was that residue
   supplementation during the dry season was beneficial during a dry year.

Abstract = {Sorghum has been promoted in arid and semi-arid areas due to its drought
   tolerance which makes it survive under harsh environmental conditions,
   but grain yields are very low, e.g., averaging 514 kg ha(-1). The use of
   field edge rainwater harvesting techniques of tied contours and
   infiltration pits can be suitable options to capture rainfall and reduce
   runoff on the soils. Furthermore, integration of field edge rainwater
   harvesting with appropriate soil fertility management practices can
   potentially increase sorghum yields. The use of biomass transfer of
   nitrogen fixing trees such as Leucaena leucocephala is an agroforestry
   practice which can improve soil fertility through increasing mineral
   nitrogen, cation exchange capacity and porosity, water retention, and
   reduce soil bulk density. Other appropriate soil fertility management
   include integrated nutrient management (INM) where organic fertilisers
   such as cattle manure are mixed with inorganic fertilisers. These
   technologies are examples of climate smart agricultural practices that
   have the potential to increase sorghum yields. The integration of
   rainwater harvesting techniques and INM show improved sorghum yields
   ranging from 750 to 2100 kg ha(-1) with potential of increasing yields
   in clay soils. However, currently there is little data available on the
   implementation of these technologies in semi-arid areas. This paper
   reviews and analyses the potential effect of integration rainwater
   harvesting, biomass transfer and INM on sorghum yields in semi-arid
   areas of Zimbabwe.},

   with different numbers of replications. The following parameters were
   evaluated: volume in cubic meter (m(3)) and stereo meters (st) and
   survival. With regard to the volume in cubic meter, Sabia had the best
   production. The Jurema and the Sabia were the heaviest species. In
   relation to survival, the Ipe 2 and the Imburana had the highest

Abstract = {Sustainable increase in agricultural production was achieved in the past
   through the use of bush fallow farming system. Extensive land use due to
   urbanization, increase in population and high farming population has led
   to reduction in fallow period. As a consequence, rapid deterioration of
   soil structure and declining productivity constitute major problems of
   agricultural productivity. Amid the efforts to increase agricultural
   productivity, many developing countries are concerned about the
   environmental effects of agricultural technologies. The focus is on
   sustainable agricultural technologies that can increase yield as well as
   regenerate soil fertility without fallow, This was achieved;through
   alley farming developed by researchers in the International Institute of
   Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, Nigeria. This paper examines the
   impact of alley farming on crop and livestock production. Surveys
   indicate that farmers are adopting the technology and that the initial
   adopters continue to use alley farming. Crop yields increased with alley
   farming and hedgerows reduced erosion and runoff. When prunings from
   Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium planted in alley farms were
   fed to cattle and ruminant animals, there was increased survival and
   body weight. Moreover, dairy cow milk production increased
   significantly. Constraints to alley farming adoption include lack of
   knowledge about its benefits and lack of money. The paper concludes with
   suggestions for effective extension of alley farming to enhance
   adoption.},

   treeless (control) plots, maize grain yields decreased from 1.2 t ha(-1)
   in 1990 to 0.8 t ha(-1) in 1992, while groundnut yields declined from
   1.1 to 0.5 t ha(-1) during the same period. With the application of
   Leucaena prunings alone, groundnut yield was maintained around 1 t
   ha(-1) for 3 years while maize yields stabilized at 2.5 t ha(-1) in the
   second and the third year; the yields of both crops were greater over
   the 3 years than in the control. Leucaena prunings applied in

   that alley cropping without fertilizer was the only non-dominated
   alternative, with a marginal rate of return of 447\%. It was the best
   system at this early stage (3 years) of implementing the technology.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is a new introduction into Pakistan, as a fast
   growing tree with many properties of economic importance. In this it was
   decided to produce some mutants of the species with the help of X-rays
   radiations, with the object that, (a) any of the mutants may prove to be
   more suitable and useful than the original parents and (b) the mutants
   thus raised may provide breeding material to the future breeders. With
   this object, young seedlings, moist seeds and dry seeds of the species
   were subjected to the X-rays treatment. The young seedlings died after
   the treatment, the moist seeds failed to germinate; in both these cases
   X-rays were lethal enough to cause the death. However, in the third lot
   where treatment was given to the dry seeds 61\% of the seeds germinated,
   but only 36\% finally survived. The surviving 36\% exhibited certain
   morphological anatomical and physiological variations, indicating
   occurrence of some degree mutation of their genetic material. If these
   mutants survived, then, in the year to come more variation will appear
   in them as they will reach maturity. At this stage, it will be quite
   premature to speculate about their values of economic importance and
   usefulness, except that they may probably provide genetic material to
   any of the interested plant breeders in future.},

Abstract = {The Hawaiian Islands hold a unique geographic position that has resulted
   in plant species with remarkable evolutionary adaptations to island life
   as well as the highest proportion of plant endemism (90\%) in the world.
   Polynesians and Europeans significantly reduced the extent of native
   vegetation types, and Europeans introduced non-native plants that have
   become highly invasive. The Hawaiian Islands have been extremely
   susceptible to invasion due to the fact that they are oceanic islands;
   they contain low intensities of competition; they have altered
   disturbance regimes; and a relatively short time has passed since
   non-native plant introductions, suggesting that the situation can only
   get worse. African grasses, Leucaena leucocephala, Psidium sp., Miconia
   calvescens, and Schinus terebinthifolius, are some of the most
   aggressive invasive plant species in the Hawaiian Islands. Species
   databases, remote sensing methods, and geographic information system
   analyses are currently being developed and will be extremely important
   for identifying the extent and threat of invasive plants. The three main
   methods of invasive plant removal include manual/mechanical removal,
   herbicide application, and biological controls. A number of federal,
   state, and non-profit organizations are involved with the management of
   invasive plant species in the Hawaiian Islands. However, much more
   attention must be paid to protecting some of the most unique and
   endangered ecosystems on the planet.},

   (IVOMD) of grasses averaged 8.4\% and 58.8\%, respectively, regardless

   Leucaena and more persistent selections of M-E hybrids grown in an

Abstract = {The long dry season from March to December is a period of stress for
   cattle in Zambia as the grasses dry up and die. In some regions, the
   cool season in the middle of this dry season removes another source of
   fodder, the leaves of trees such as Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania
   sesban. It is especially difficult for small farmers to cope with this
   situation, as they lack the ability to store fodder for the dry season.
   Trials have been conducted for six years with indigenous trees whose
   pods are nutritious cattle feed. These trees are Faidherbia albida,
   Amblygonocarpus andongensis, Dichrostachys cinerea, Bauhinia
   (Piliostigma) thonningii, and Swartzia madagascariensis. The pods of all
   these trees mature in the middle of the dry season and are very
   palatable to local cattle. Pods are eaten whole or are crushed and mixed
   with other ingredients such as maize screenings and sunflower hulls. The
   nutritious leaves of F. albida, D. cinerea, and B. thonningii are an
   excellent source of fodder during the dry season. In many locations, F.
   albida was the only tree to retain its leaves during the winter of 1994,
   one of the coldest on record in Zambia, with several frosts and minimum
   temperatures falling as low as -4 degrees C. Attempts to grow F. albida,
   A. andongensis, B. thonningii, and S. madagascariensis are described in

   matter (DM) in Acacia auriculata to 25.27 g (100 g)-1 DM in Leucaena
   leucocephala, and crude fibre ranged from 11.22 g (100 g)-1 DM in Vigna
   unguiculata to 27.80 g (100 g)-1 DM in A. auriculata. Ether extract was
   generally low, although Glycine max and Cassia alata had respective
   values of 10.30 g (100 g)-1 and 9.14 g (100 g)-1 DM. Ash content was no
   more than 18.84 g (100 g)-1 DM in any of the species. Sodium, calcium
   and potassium were the most abundant minerals, and copper and manganese
   were the least abundant. Oxalate ranged from 25.36 mg (100 g)-1 DM in G.
   max to 223.16 mg (100 g)-1 DM in Bauhinia thoningii, and none was
   detected in Delonix regia. Phytin content varied from 5.07 mg g-1 DM in
   C alata to 82.28 mg g-1 DM in Calapogonium mucunoides, and
   phytin-phosphorus was no more than 23 mg g-1 DM in any of the species.},

Abstract = {The possibility of using Moringa oleifera as a ruminant protein
   supplement was investigated by comparison between nutritive and
   anti-nutritive value of its different morphological parts with that of
   conventionally used Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LL). Parameters
   determined were chemical composition, rumen degradable protein (RDP),
   acid detergent insoluble protein (ADIP), pepsin soluble protein (PESP),
   non-protein nitrogen (NPN) total soluble protein (TSP) and protein
   potentially digested in the intestine (PDI). Total phenols (TP) and
   total. extractable tannins JET) were also evaluated as anti-nutritive
   factors. In vitro gas production characteristics were measured and
   organic matter digestibility (OMD) was estimated basing on 24 h-gas
   production. Crude protein content ranged from 265-308 g/kg DM in M.
   oleifera leaves (MOL) and seed cake (MOC) respectively. Leucaena
   leucocephala and Moringa oleifera soft twigs and leaves (MOLSTL) had CP
   content of 236 and 195 g/kg DM while Moringa oleifera soft twigs alone
   (MOST) and Moringa oleifera bucks (MOB) had 160, 114 and 69.3 g/kg DM
   respectively RDP was highest in (MOC) (181 g/kg DM) followed by (MOL)
   (177 g/kg DM) and was lowest in MOB (40 g/kg DM). The proportion of the
   protein that was not available to the animal (ADIP) was (p < 0.05)
   higher in MOL and MOC (72 and 73 g/kg DM) respectively and lowest in LL
   (29 g/kg DM). The PDI was high in LL (74 g/kg DM) followed by MOC (55
   g/kg DM) then MOL (16 g/kg DM). PESP was highest (p < 0.05) in MOC
   followed by MOL then LL (273, 200 and.463 g/kg DM respectively). MOC
   exhibited highest NPN content (116 g/kg DM) and was lowest in MOB (18
   g/kg DM) (p < 0.05). Highly (p < 0.05) TSP was observed in MOC and MOL
   (308 and 265 g/kg DM respectively) followed by LL (236 g/kg DM). MOL had
   negligible TET (20 g/kg DM) when compared with about 70 g/kg DM in LL.
   Highly (p < 0.05) b and a+b values were observed for MOLSTL (602 and 691
   g/kg DM respectively) followed by MOL (490 and 538 g/kg DM). Highest c
   value was observed in MOSTL followed by MOC and MOL (0.064, 0.056 and
   0.053 rate/hour) respectively. OMD was highest (p < 0.05) for MOSTL
   followed by MOC and then MOL (579, 579 and 562 g/kg DM respectively). LL
   exhibited lower (p < 0.05) OMD (467 g/kg DM). It was concluded from this
   study that the high crude protein content in MOL and MOLST could be well
   utilized by ruminant animals and increase animal performance however,
   high proportion of unavailable protein to the lower gut of animals and
   high rumen degradable protein due to negligible tannin content render it
   a relatively poor protein supplement for ruminants. MOC can be a best
   alternative protein supplement to leaves and leaves and soft twigs for
   ruminants.},

Abstract = {Plant helps to stabilize the masses of soil via hydrological and
   mechanical means. The effects of vegetation on soil depend on the
   overall root growth, architecture and its hydro-mechanical functions.
   Three leguminous plants, Leucaena leucocephala, Pterocarpus indicus and
   Peltophorum pterocarpum were evaluated in terms of their
   hydro-mechanical characteristics and root architecture for soil
   reinforcement. The results show that L. leucocephala exhibited the
   highest hydrological properties such as diurnal transpiration, water
   absorption capacity and soil matric suction (SMS). Regarding mechanical
   characteristics, L. leucocephala exhibited the highest root tensile
   strength and cellulosic components in the root. Interestingly, L.
   leucocephala also showed a higher root length, volume and tips than
   Pterocarpus indicus and Peltophorum pterocarpum. The SMS was strongly (r
   = 0.79) correlated with leaf area index (LAI), indicating that high LAI
   improved SMS. In conjunction with the cellulosic composition, root
   tensile strength of the species studied was highly correlated with the
   alpha-cellulose content (r = 0.9) and showed that high alpha-cellulose
   content of roots improved mechanical properties of plants to provide
   reinforcement in the soil. The high-root tensile strength, root
   cellulosic composition and VH-type root of L. leucocephala make the
   species special for growing as a soil reinforcing plant. In conclusion,
   L. leucocephala properties revealed that it possessed excellent
   hydro-mechanical properties and root architecture and can be planted on
   slopes for soil reinforcement.},

   leucaena supplementation although digestibility of the whole diet did
   not alter. Rumen fluid ammonia-N was not altered by leucaena
   supplementation, but was increased by urea. This suggests that Tarramba
   foliage protein has some resistance to ruminal degradation. Liquid and
   solids passage rates were not affected by the treatments. Microbial
   nitrogen supply to the intestine (g/day), and the efficiency of
   microbial nitrogen synthesis (g/kg organic matter apparently digested in

Abstract = {Erosion losses were investigated in a field experiment, from 90 x 15 m
   erosion plots at 4\% slope in the western Himalayan valley region of
   India. The plots were planted with Leucaena leucocephala and Eucalyptus
   hybrid, either as block plantation or in alley farming with maize (Zea
   mays), Chrysopogon fulvus grass or turmeric (Curcuma longa). The
   treatments also included contour planting of sole maize, sole
   Chrysopogon fulvus grass and a clean weeded cultivated fallow. During
   the nine year study period, the average annual monsoon rainfall was
   about 1000 mm and it caused 347 mm runoff and 39 Mg ha(-1) soil loss per
   year from fallow plots. The runoff and soil loss were reduced by 27\%
   and 45\% by contour cultivation of maize. Contour tree-rows or leucaena
   hedges reduced the runoff and sail loss by 40\% and 48\%, respectively,
   over the maize plot, reducing soil loss to about 12.5 Mg ha(-1). This
   reduction in erosion was primarily due to the barrier effect of tree or
   hedgerows and micro-terraces formed through sediment deposition along
   the contour barriers. Such vegetative measures, that are productive
   while being protective, offer viable alternative for erosion control in
   areas with gentile slopes of the valley region. High density block
   plantations of eucalyptus and leucaena almost completely controlled
   erosional losses and can be recommended for steeper slopes that ale
   vulnerable to heavy erosion.},

   Leucaena, both mycorrhizal inoculations stimulated greater plant growth,
   P and N uptake compared to their non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants under both
   watering regimes. However, in Acacia and Albizia, these parameters were
   only stimulated by either ectomycorrhiza (Acacia) or VA mycorrhiza
   (Albizia). Growth reduction occurred as a result of inoculation with the
   other type of mycorrhiza. This was attributed to competition for carbon
   between Acacia and VA mycorrhizas and parasitic association between
   Albizia and ectomycorrhiza.
   Drought-stressed mycorrhizal and NM Leucaena, and drought-stressed
   mycorrhizal Acacia tolerated lower xylem pressure potentials and larger

   in terms of drought response index (DRI). The DRI may be a useful
   determinant of MD, as they are inversely related.},

Abstract = {We report that the smb20752 gene of the alfalfa symbiont Sinorhizobium
   meliloti is a novel symbiotic gene required for full N-2-fixation.
   Deletion of smb20752 resulted in lower nitrogenase activity and smaller
   nodules without impacting overall nodule morphology. Orthologs of
   smb20752 were present in all alpha and beta rhizobia, including the
   ngr\_b20860 gene of Sinorhizobium fredii NGR234. A ngr\_b20860 mutant
   formed Fix(-) determinate nodules that developed normally to a late
   stage of the symbiosis on the host plants Macroptilium atropurpureum and
   Vigna unguiculata. However an early symbiotic defect was evident during
   symbiosis with Leucaena leucocephala, producing Fix(-) indeterminate
   nodules. The smb20752 and ngr\_b20860 genes encode putative
   3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA (HIB-CoA) hydrolases. HIB-CoA hydrolases are
   required for l-valine catabolism and appear to prevent the accumulation
   of toxic metabolic intermediates, particularly methacrylyl-CoA. Evidence
   presented here and elsewhere (Curson et al., , PLoS ONE 9:e97660)
   demonstrated that Smb20752 and NGR\_b20860 can also prevent metabolic
   toxicity, are required for l-valine metabolism, and play an undefined
   role in 3-hydroxybutyrate catabolism. We present evidence that the
   symbiotic defect of the HIB-CoA hydrolase mutants is independent of the
   inability to catabolize l-valine and suggest it relates to the toxicity
   resulting from metabolism of other compounds possibly related to
   3-hydroxybutyric acid.},

   22 years on unreplicated pastures based on Kenya clover (Trifolium
   semipilosum cv. Safari) and Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru in coastal
   south-east Queensland. Safari persisted over this period but its
   presence and productivity fluctuated between years. There was a trend
   towards lower pasture and animal production towards the end of the
   22-year period. Liveweight gains averaged c. 460 kg/ha/yr in the first
   10 years, but declined to just under 400 kg/ha in the last 3 years. The
   variable growth of Safari in this environment will limit its commercial
   acceptability.
   Animal production from the leucaena pasture in the last 13 years (400
   kg/ha) was higher than in the first 10 years (310 kg/ha). This was
   despite a decline in the density of leucaena bushes from c. 8650
   plants/ha (1969) to 7000 (1980) and 4120 (1993). Infestation by psyllids
   was first noticed in 1988, but on this pasture, grazed on a 2 weeks on :
   6 weeks off rotation, damage was less serious than on other pastures
   with a longer rest. Clinical signs of mimosine toxicity and low serum
   thyroxine levels were measured only in 1981 and 1982 and then only in
   some animals. No DHP was detected in urine after dosing animals with

   taking two at the same time, without replication. The results of the
   palatability trials identified nine species with very high and high
   palatability, which ordered in a descending manner were: Albizia
   niopoides, Leucaena leucocephala, Erythrina fusca, Guazuma ulmifolia,
   Gliricidia sepium, Tithonia diversifolia, Clitoria fairchildiana,
   Spondias purpurea and Spondias mombin. The pair of species that showed
   the highest palatability was A. niopoides-L. leucocephala; and the
   species frequently present in combinations with high intake was A.
   niopoides. It is concluded that there are several native species with
   high relative palatability, whose forage potential is unknown by
   technicians and ranchers, and the high palatability of some species
   already known was confirmed.},

Abstract = {Some agricultural residues such as wheat or barley straw, as well as
   certain fast-growing plants like Leucaena leucocephala and Chamaecytisus
   proliferus, could be used as raw materials for the paper industry as an
   alternative to traditional plants (eucalyptus, pine, etc.). In the
   present study, four types of lignin obtained from the spent liquors
   produced by the pulping processes using the abovementioned feedstocks
   were isolated and characterized. Lignin samples were acquired through an
   acid precipitation from these spent liquors. The characterization of the
   precipitated lignin samples were performed using a Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and both liquid- and solid-state nuclear
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to analyse the chemical structure,
   and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for determining the thermal
   properties. Additionally, chemical composition of lignin fractions was
   also measured. Even though they were of different botanical origin, all
   the studied samples except for wheat straw lignin had a similar chemical
   composition and thermal behaviour, and identical chemical structure.
   Wheat straw lignin showed a greater amount of Klason lignin and lower
   carbohydrate content. Furthermore, this lignin sample showed a higher
   thermal stability and significantly different cross-peak patterns in the
   2D-NMR experiments. The molecular structures corresponding to
   p-coumarate (PCA), ferulate (FA) and cinnamyl aldehyde end-groups (J)
   were only detected in wheat isolated lignin.},

Abstract = {Non-typhoidal invasive Salmonella (NTiS) diseases are one of the most
   important zoonoses in the world. This study explored the antipathogenic
   potential of twenty-four plants used in Benin folk medicine against NTiS
   diseases. The in vitro antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of
   ethanolic plant extracts were screened against clinical resistant
   isolates and ATCC reference strains of Salmonella. Salmonella enterica
   serovar Typhimuriuminfected rat model was used to examine the in vivo
   antibacterial potential of plant extracts. Of the 24 plants, 18 plants
   exhibited antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica strains
   with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.156 to 1.25
   mg/mL. Anacardium occidentale, Artemisia afra, Detarium microcarpum,
   Detarium senegalense, and Leucaena leucocephala were the most active
   plant species. Extracts from A. afra, D. microcarpum, and D. senegalense
   showed biofilm inhibition greater than 50\% against Salmonella clinical
   isolates. In the rat model of infection, A. afra and D. senegalense
   extracts were found to have an effective dose of less than 100 mg/kg and
   to stop the salmonellosis after 10 days of treatment. Additionally,
   these extracts did not produce any toxic effects in the treated animals.
   These results indicate clear evidence supporting the anti-Salmonella
   activity of A. afra and D. senegalense. Further studies are now needed
   to isolate bioactive compounds and to ensure the safety of these plant
   species.},

Journal = {SOIL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The use of location-specific and underutilized organic residues (OR) as
   soil amendments in small-holder agro-ecosystems is promising. Six ORs
   (Leucaena leucocephala, Centrosema pubescens, Gliricidia sepium,
   Pueraria phaseoloides, Azadirachta indica, and Theobroma cacao) were
   amended to three tropical soils each at 24 mg g(-1) dry soil in 120-day
   incubation study to estimate their nitrogen (N) mineralization and
   microbial biomass carbon (C) dynamics. Inorganic N contents varied among
   ORs, soil type and incubation days. Regardless of soil type, Gliricidia
   had the highest inorganic N among the studied ORs. Mineralization rate
   of 1.4 to 1.5 mg N kg(-1) soil day(-1) was observed for Lego and Tec
   soils, respectively, and was twice higher than Nya soil. However, Nya
   soil released higher inorganic N than Tec and Lego soils, implying high
   N mineralization efficiency in the former. Consistent soil pH increase
   was respectively observed for Theobroma and Pueraria treatments in all
   soils. Moreover, Theobroma and Pueraria amendments showed the highest
   soil microbial biomass C (MBC) at the end of the incubation. The
   assessed soil properties likely affected by the dominant edaphic factors
   and management influenced differences in MBC and dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) while OR quality indices controlled N mineralization. Thus,
   we conclude that soil properties and OR type are important factors for
   optimal utilization of organic resources.},

Title = {Inhibitory Activities of Thai Culinary Vegetables against Key Enzymes
   Relevant to Diabetes Mellitus and the Kinetics of Enzyme Inhibitions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {2024},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most challenging noncommunicable
   diseases, as it causes significant costs for medical treatment as well
   as high morbidity and mortality rates. Dietary plants with antidiabetic
   properties have been explored as an alternative to synthetic medicines
   to treat DM because of their safety and nutrition. Hence, the objective
   of the present study was to determine the inhibitory activities of
   twenty commonly consumed Thai culinary vegetables against
   alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. All vegetables were extracted using
   deionized water, ethanol, and hexane at 150 rpm and 30 degrees C for 24
   hours. The enzyme inhibitory activities were performed using a
   colorimetric assay. Diverse results for alpha-glucosidase and
   alpha-amylase inhibitory activities were found for all vegetable
   extracts. The most potent anti-alpha-glucosidase activity was obtained
   from the ethanolic extract of Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit with
   the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 13.39 +/- 0.14 mu
   g/mL, followed by the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Polygonum
   odoratum Lour with IC50 of 25.60 +/- 0.42 and 49.03 +/- 0.72 mu g/mL,
   respectively. All the samples exhibited mixed, noncompetitive, and
   uncompetitive inhibition. It can be concluded that the alpha-glucosidase
   and alpha-amylose inhibitory effects of the investigated extracts may be
   an indicator of antidiabetic potency, and these extracts might
   potentially be beneficial as functional components for postprandial
   hyperglycemia treatment.},

   reductant for sustainable ironmaking},
Journal = {BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 26},
Abstract = {Renewable biomass is a potent, CO2 neutral substitute to fossil coal and
   coke in iron making. However, there has been relatively little work on
   the utilization of biomass for the production of directly reduced iron
   (DRI). The aim of the present work is to characterize Acacia nilotica
   (W1), Albizia lebbeck (W2), and Leucaena leucocephala (W3) biomass and
   to reduce iron ore pellets primarily with the volatile matter from the
   wood at high temperature, yielding charcoal simultaneously as a
   co-product. The chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the
   three biomass species were investigated. Effect of different biomasses
   and reduction parameters like C/O ratio, reduction temperature, and time
   on \%Reduction (\%R) was studied. DRI was characterized using
   \%Metallization (\%M), XRD, and SEM. Up to 89\% reduction was achieved
   in the simultaneous carbonization of biomass and the reduction of iron
   ore pellets at a temperature of 1000 degrees C. The pellets cooled in
   the furnace after reduction resulted in lower \%R (e.g., W1:57\%,
   W2:54\%, and W3:63\%) than the respective air-cooled pellets (e.g.,
   W1:88\%, W2:83\%, and W3:86\%). Oxidation was the cause for lower \%R in
   furnace cooled (slow cooling) reduction experiments than in the air
   cooled. Co-produced wood charcoal after the reduction of iron ore
   contained approximately 76-81\% carbon which competes well with a
   typical value for coal of 70\%.},

Abstract = {The perennial legume leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) is grown across
   the subtropics for a variety of purposes including livestock fodder.
   Livestock in Australia emit a significant proportion of the methane
   produced by the agriculture sector and there is increasing pressure to
   decrease emissions from beef cattle production systems. In addition to
   direct productivity gains for livestock, leucaena has been shown to
   lower enteric methane production, suggesting an opportunity for
   emissions mitigation and Commonwealth Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF)
   methodology development, where leucaena browse is adopted for high value
   beef production. Determining the proportion of leucaena in the diet may
   be one of the more challenging aspects in attributing mitigation.
   Current enteric emission relationships for cattle consuming mixed
   grass-leucaena diets are based on intensive respiration chamber work.
   Herd-scale methane flux has also been determined using open path laser
   methodologies and may be used to validate an on-farm herd-scale
   methodology for leucaena feeding systems. The methodology should also
   address increased potential for soil organic carbon storage by leucaena
   grazing systems, and changes in nitrous oxide production. This paper
   outlines the background, justification, eligibility requirements and
   potential gaps in research for an emissions quantification protocol that
   will lead to the adoption of a leucaena methodology by the Australian
   beef industry. Development of a methodology would be supported by
   research conducted in Australia.},

Abstract = {Cogongrass (Imperata cylindria) is an invasive weed and harmful to
   ecological systems and agricultural production in many countries. It was
   found that plant extracts and root exudates of sweet potato (Ipomoea
   batatas) exhibit allelopathic potential and inhibit the growth of
   cogongrass to a greater extent than either barnyardgrass (Echinochloa
   crus-galli), Indian goose-grass (Eleushine indica), or lettuce (Lactuca
   sativa) in bioassays. Greenhouse trials indicated that sweet potato soil
   reduced the emergence of the noxious weed by 50 \%, yet exhibited either
   weaker inhibition or the promotion of barnyardgrass, Bidens (Bidens
   pilosa), and Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), while the desired growth
   of upland rice (Oryza sativa) was not affected. In cogongrass fields,
   the incorporation of 1-2 tons aboveground parts and cultivation of sweet
   potato provided 80-85 \% weed control. On the other hand, the reduction
   of congograss in fields may be offset by the alternate invasion of B.
   pilosa which multiplied its biomass by 2-6 times with sweet potato
   amended soils. The findings of this study indicate that sweet potato is
   an effective crop in the biologic management of the invasive cogongrass
   in agricultural fields, thus the interactive mechanism between sweet
   potato and the invasive weed demands further investigation.
   Ecologically, this study highlights the specificity of allelopathic
   interactions between cogongrass and sweet potato that is helpful to
   minimize the disturbance from infestation of this invasive weed against
   native species and crops.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen fixing trees (NFTs) have the potential to contribute toward the
   sustainability of farming systems because they can provide wood for fuel
   and timber and fodder for animals; NFTs so sustain soil productivity
   through the addition of biomass as mulch and nitrogen fixation. In Papua
   New Guinea (PNG), the livelihood of about 75\% of the population depends
   on subsistence farming. With an annual population increase of 2.3\%, the
   traditional practice of shifting cultivation is unsustainable,
   especially in densely populated areas. As a result of the mandate given
   by the government of PNG to the Agriculture Research Division to develop
   sustainable farming systems based on low-input technology, studies to
   collect and evaluate various NFTs commenced in 1987. This paper reports
   on a study of six NFTs/shrubs in the highlands of Aiyura in PNG to
   identify suitable species for biomass production and use in cropping
   systems. Calliandra calothyrsus, Acacia angustissima, Leucaena
   diversifolia, and Leucaena mexicana produced more biomass than Leucaena
   leucocephala (cultivar K636) or Desmodium sequax, The four most
   productive species also contributed large amounts of major nutrients to
   the soil through hedge biomass whereas L. leucacephala (K636) and
   Desmodium sequax contributed the lowest. There was an increase in soil N
   and P levels and no change in soil K and organic carbon levels 2.5 years
   after planting NFTs.},

Journal = {REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {53},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic actions have caused soil degradation and revegetation is a
   way to recover degraded soils. However, salt-affected soils require the
   use of suitable species to extract salts from the soil. This study
   investigated the growth of shrub and tree species in a soil degraded by
   salts, alone or associated with a phytoextraction salt species,
   evaluating plant biomass yield and extraction of elements by plants. A
   field experiment was assembled with eight treatments: 1) Atriplex
   nummularia Lindl., 2) Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth, 3) Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) Wit, 4) Azadirachta indica A. Juss, 5) A. nummularia
   + M. caesalpiniifolia, 6) A. nummularia + L. leucocephala and 7) A.
   nummularia + A. indica; in randomized blocks with four replications.
   After 30 months of cultivation, plants were collected to measure biomass
   and concentrations of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, P, and N. A. indica plants had
   the highest total biomass (10.75 kg plant(-1)), about 15 times more than
   M. caesalpiniifolia, both in associated cultivation with A. nummularia.
   A. nummularia plants extracted more Na and Cl in the dry matter, maximum
   of 124.70 and 166.79 g plant(-1), respectively. The highest production
   of plant biomass (23.55 t ha(-1)) and total extraction of elements
   (1438.51 kg ha(-1)) were obtained by associated cultivation of A.
   nummularia and A. indica. Associated cultivation did not decrease the
   phytoextractor potential of Na and Cl by A. nummularia plants and it can
   be used to regenerate degraded areas.},

Title = {Contrasting effects of an invasive ant on a native and an invasive plant},

Abstract = {When invasive species establish in new environments, they may disrupt
   existing or create new interactions with resident species. Understanding
   of the functioning of invaded ecosystems will benefit from careful
   investigation of resulting species-level interactions. We manipulated
   ant visitation to compare how invasive ant mutualisms affect two common
   plants, one native and one invasive, on a sub-tropical Indian Ocean
   island. Technomyrmex albipes, an introduced species, was the most common
   and abundant ant visitor to the plants. T. albipes were attracted to
   extrafloral nectaries on the invasive tree (Leucaena leucocephala) and
   deterred the plant's primary herbivore, the Leucaena psyllid
   (Heteropsylla cubana). Ant exclusion from L. leucocephala resulted in
   decreased plant growth and seed production by 22\% and 35\%,
   respectively. In contrast, on the native shrub (Scaevola taccada), T.
   albipes frequently tended sap-sucking hemipterans, and ant exclusion
   resulted in 30\% and 23\% increases in growth and fruit production,
   respectively. Stable isotope analysis confirmed the more predacious and
   herbivorous diets of T. albipes on the invasive and native plants,
   respectively. Thus the ants' interactions protect the invasive plant
   from its main herbivore while also exacerbating the effects of
   herbivores on the native plant. Ultimately, the negative effects on the
   native plant and positive effects on the invasive plant may work in
   concert to facilitate invasion by the invasive plant. Our findings
   underscore the importance of investigating facilitative interactions in
   a community context and the multiple and diverse interactions shaping
   novel ecosystems.},

Title = {Regulation of exopolysaccharide synthesis in Rhizobium sp strain
   TAL1145 involves an alternative sigma factor gene, rpoH2},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 has
   been shown to be essential for effective nodulation on Leucaena
   leucocephala (leucaena). This paper reports the isolation and
   characterization of an alternative sigma factor gene, rpoH2, involved in
   the regulation of EPS synthesis in TAL1145. Disruption of this gene in
   TAL1145 resulted in a Calcofluor-dim mutant RUH102 that produced
   approximately 18\% of the amount of EPS made by TAL1145. This mutation
   did not affect the normal growth of RUH102 in free-living state. RUH102
   induced few nitrogen-fixing nodules, resulting in a significant
   reduction in total nitrogen content in leucaena. It was complemented for
   EPS production and nodulation by a 2(.)0 kb HindIII fragment of TAL1145.
   Sequence analysis of this fragment revealed the rpoH2 ORF of 870 bp that
   encoded a protein of 32 kDa. Expression of the rpoH2 ORF in Escherichia
   coli also revealed a 32 kDa protein. A PCR-constructed clone of 1263 bp,
   containing the rpoH2 ORF and its upstream putative regulatory region,
   complemented RUH102 for EPS defects. Comparison of the RpoH2 sequence to
   proteins in the databases showed significant similarity to RpoH-like
   sigma factors of other Gram-negative bacteria. By constructing several
   exo: : Tn3Hogus fusions and transferring them to the backgrounds of
   TAL1145 and RUH102, it was demonstrated that RpoH2 positively regulates
   the transcription of some exo genes.},

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {33},

Pages = {195-203},
Abstract = {Fast growing trees, in particular nitrogen fixing trees,are essential
   for the establishment of sustainable agroforestry practices by
   resource-poor and/or environmentally conscious farmers. An important
   selection factor for trees is therefore high N-2 fixing capability. This
   study was conducted to examine biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in
   Leucaena leucocephala L., as affected by growth in pots containing 4,
   10, 15 and 30 kg soil and when grown together with Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis. BNF was measured by the N-15 isotope dilution technique.
   Leucaena and Eucalyptus were grown either sole (SL, SE) or in two
   mixtures (1:1 - L1:EI and 1:2 - L1:E2) for a period of 6 months.
   Planting pattern influenced (P < 0.05) dry matter and N content of shoot
   and roots of Eucalyptus, as the sole planted trees gave the highest
   yield. Dry matter, N content and total amount of N fixed by Leucaena
   significantly decreased with decreasing rooting volume. Also, the
   smaller the rooting volume (or soil weight), the higher was the
   proportion (\%) of N derived from the atmosphere (\%Ndfa) by leucaena.
   For each rooting volume, the sole or mixed planting pattern did not
   significantly influence either the proportion (\%) or amount of N fixed
   by leucaena. For these trees, therefore, rooting volume rather than
   cropping pattern influenced the proportion and amount of nitrogen fixed.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {1990},
Volume = {3},

Pages = {424-428},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Mutants of Rhizobium sp. strain CIAT899 deficient in exopolysaccharide
   (EPS) were generated with Tn5 and ethyl methanesulfonate. The
   EPS-deficient mutants produced nonmucoid colonies on solid media and
   released 8.1-41.0\% of the amount of EPS produced by CIAT899 in broth
   culture. All eight mutants tested induced an interveinal chlorosis in
   the first trifoliolate leaf of their symbiotic host, common bean
   (Phaseolus, vulgaris), whereas CIA T899 caused slight chlorosis on a
   small proportion of inoculated plants. Two other bean-nodulating
   strains, R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli CE3 and KIM5s, did not induce
   chlorosis, and neither did EPS-deficient mutants derived from these two
   strains. CIAT899 and its EPS-deficient mutants all induced pink,
   effective nodules, indicating that the chlorosis was not due to a lack
   of nitrogen resulting from an ineffective symbiosis. One EPS-deficient
   mutant, CT9005, was applied to Leucaena leucocephala, and it was found
   to induce foliar chlorosis and  retained the ability to induce nodules
   on that host. Cultures of chlorosis-inducing strains lost the ability to
   induce chlorosis upon dilution, while retaining sufficient cells to
   nodulate abundantly, suggesting that nodulation is not sufficient for
   chlorosis induction. These data suggest that EPS-deficient mutants of
   CIAT899, and CIAT899 to a lesser extent, produce a chlorosis-inducing
   factor either in broth culture or in the rhizosphere.},

Abstract = {In Australia's central and southern Queensland regions, Leucaena
   leucocephala-grass pastures produce substantially more beef and higher
   profits than grass-only pastures and annual forage crops. Near infrared
   reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a rapid and cost-effective
   approach to assessing quality of available forage as well as the quality
   of the diet selected by cattle, but existing calibrations have not been
   comprehensively validated for leucaena-grass pastures. This study
   examined the reliability of existing northern Australian calibrations
   for NIRS to predict the crude protein (CP) concentration of the edible
   fraction of the leucaena plant, and the proportion of leucaena in the
   diet of grazing cattle. Samples of edible leucaena and cattle feces were
   analyzed by NIRS and the predictions plotted in a linear regression and
   fitted to a 1:1 line with Dumas analysis of CP for leucaena forage, and
   mass spectrometry of delta C-13 for cattle feces. Results demonstrated
   that prediction of the CP concentration of leucaena forage and the
   proportion of leucaena in the diet of grazing cattle using current broad
   northern Australian NIRS forage calibrations were associated with
   substantial error. However, it is likely that these errors can be
   reduced with the inclusion in the calibration data set of more samples
   representing leucaena forage and feces of cattle grazing leucaena from
   varying locations, seasonal conditions and management strategies.},

Abstract = {This study examined the influence of organic residue quality and N
   fertilizer on aggregate-associated soil organic matter (SOM) in maize
   (Zea mays L.) cropping systems of southern Ghana. Six residue treatments
   of differing quality {[}Crotalaria juncea L., Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lain.) de Wit, maize stover, sawdust, cattle manure, and a control with
   no residues added] were applied at 4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) both with and
   without fertilizer N additions (120 kgN ha(-1) season(-1)). Soils (0-15
   cm) were sampled 3 yr after study implementation and wet sieved into
   four aggregate size classes (8000-2000, 2000-250, 250-53, and < 53 mu
   m). Small macroaggregates (2000-250 mu m) were further separated into
   coarse particulate organic matter (> 250 pro), microaggregates within
   macroaggregates (53-250 mu m), and macroaggregate-occluded silt and clay
   (< 53 mu m). Nitrogen fertilizer additions reduced aggregate stability,
   as was evident from a 40\% increase in the weight of the silt and clay
   fraction (P = 0.014) as well as a decrease in microaggregates across all
   residue types (P = 0.019). Fertilizer similarly affected C and N storage
   within these aggregate fractions, while the effects of residue quality
   were largely insignificant. Our results suggest that fertilizer effects
   on soil aggregation may have important implications for long-tern, SOM
   dynamics.},

Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Diabetes management through dietary intervention has gained significant
   interest, particularly in the use of natural plant-based inhibitors of
   key enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion. The objective of this
   study was to assess the inhibitory effects of ten Thai culinary
   vegetables on alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, including Chinese
   chive (Allium tuberosum), holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum), star
   gooseberry (Phyllanthus acidus), galangal (Alpinia galanga), bamboo
   grass (Tiliacora triandra), Turkey berry (Solanum torvum), cassod tree
   (Senna siamea), dill (Anethum graveolens L.), noni (Morinda citrifolia),
   and pearl wattle (Leucaena leucocephala). All vegetables were extracted
   using deionized water at a 1 : 10 ratio in an ultrasonic bath operating
   at 350 W and a frequency of 50 Hz for 30 minutes. The alpha-glucosidase
   inhibitory activities of the vegetable extracts ranged from 13.42 +/-
   0.23\% to 79.84 +/- 0.47\%, while the inhibitory activities against
   alpha-amylase were relatively modest, ranging from 4.82 +/- 3.32\% to
   27.49 +/- 1.67\%. Cassod tree exhibited the highest alpha-glucosidase
   inhibition with the lowest IC50 at 126.38 +/- 0.98 mu g/mL, followed by
   galangal (203.17 +/- 1.05 mu g/mL) and holy basil (1,240 +/- 20.31 mu
   g/mL), respectively. These results may hold promise for encouraging the
   consumption of vegetables as a strategy for diabetes management through
   the targeting of key enzyme inhibition.},

Abstract = {Aims: This study focused on new fish feed additives that could supply a
   nutritional value and inhibit or eliminate mycotoxins. Four novel feed
   additives, including Albizia lebbeck (L.), Leucaena leucocephala leaf
   extracts, Serendipita indica and Bacillus megaterium were applied to
   contaminated fish feed; besides investigating the toxicity of these new
   fish feed additives.Methodology and results: Our data exhibited that the
   different tested feed additives were not toxic for brine shrimp larvae
   or fish. Albizia lebbeck extract at a concentration 0.5\% was highly
   effective in detoxifying mycotoxins with efficacy ratios of 88.01\%,
   93.89\% and 92.89\% for aflaB1, aflaG1 and CPA, respectively and L.
   leucocephala at 0.5\% had efficacy ratios of 93.52\% and 100\% for
   aflaG1 and CPA, respectively. The addition of S. indica with a
   concentration of 0.75\% was highly effective for the usage of good feed
   approximately free of mycotoxins, with efficacy ratios of 85.65\%,
   90.81\% and 100\% for aflaB1, aflaG1 and CPA, respectively. Moreover, B.
   megaterium, with a concentration of 0.75\% was recommended for
   detoxification. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: Studied
   new feed additives as feed additives in fish diets to eliminate
   mycotoxin with the potential of providing antioxidant activity. Results
   suggest that mycotoxins degradation can happen in vitro and in vivo by
   applying new fish feed additives in the fish diet.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {45},

Abstract = {The efficient/low-cost activated carbons were prepared from inedible
   fruits such as Cerbera odollam Gaertn, Terminalia catappa, Ficus lyrata,
   Couroupita guianensis Aubl and Hevea brasiliensis as well as biochars of
   Combretum quadrangulare and Leucaena Leucocephala (LL). The physical and
   chemical activation processes were applied to improve the Fe3+
   adsorption efficiency. As obtained results, LL heated at 500 degrees C
   for 2 h (LL502) exhibited best performance for Fe3+ adsorption with a
   q(e) value of Fe3+ (28.18 mg/g). The physicochemical properties of LL502
   such as BET surface area, total acid-base amount and pH(pzc) were 247.3
   m(2)/g, 2.2647 meq/g and 8.49, respectively. Moreover, the adsorption
   behaviors of Fe3+ onto the surface of LL502 were found to be monolayer,
   physisorption and rapid adsorption processes which could be confirmed by
   Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms and pseudo-second order
   kinetic models, respectively. Adsorption thermodynamics also indicated
   that the Fe3+ adsorption processes were endothermic and spontaneous in
   nature. In addition, 98\% of iron removal from ground/surface water was
   successfully achieved by using LL502. The quality of ground/surface
   water was acceptable based on comparison with a water quality standard.
   This research was as expected since as-prepared low-cost adsorbent could
   be verily applied in a practical treatment process.

   both cacp and cacyt. These transgenic plants exhibited significantly
   higher activity of beta-CAs as compared with wild-type plants. The
   percent increase in the CA activity of transgenic plants expressing
   leucaena cacyt or cacp was found to be similar to 51 and similar to
   55\%, respectively. The transgenic tobacco expressing both the leucaena
   beta-CA isoforms exhibited similar to 63\% increase in CA activity as

   activity of transgenic tobacco plants, no difference was observed in
   their phenotype, chlorophyll content and the overall dry weight compared
   with that of wild-type suggesting that C-3 beta-CAs are not involved in

   breast height (DBH) trees to 89\% in 12.5-15 cm DBH trees and in
   eucalyptus clones the corresponding values were 71\% in 2.5-5 cm DBH
   trees and 83\% in 12.5-15 cm DBH trees. Marketable biomass productivity
   was higher with leucaena (95 Mg ha(-1)) in comparison to eucalyptus (87
   Mg ha(-1)). Competition effects of trees on intercrops were observed
   from the 2 year (2002 post-rainy season). Intercrop yields were 45\% of
   the sole crop in eucalyptus system and 36\% in leucaena system during
   the 2 year. Sole eucalyptus and leucaena plantations and intercropping
   systems recorded higher gross and net returns over arable cropping.
   Therefore, it can be concluded that leucaena variety K636 and eucalyptus
   clonal based agroforestry systems are profitable alternatives to arable
   cropping under rainfed conditions.},

Abstract = {The utilization of biomass from plants is one efforts for the
   fulfillment an availability of alternative energy in indonesia.
   Gliricidia sepium is a tolerant species that can grow in dry land.
   However its utilization as renewable energy source is non-optimized.
   This study aims to analyze the potential carbon stocks and biomass from
   Gliricidia sepium as a raw material for alternative energy in East Nusa
   Tenggara. This study was conducted in November 2015 and located in
   Humusu Sainiup, Timor Tengah Utara Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province.
   The method used in collecting data was applied in three different
   land-use, namely monoculture Gliricidia sepium, polyculture between
   Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala, and polyculture between
   Gliricidia sepium and Zea mays. We used the allometric equation from
   Ketterings namely B = 0.11 rho D-2+0,D-62 and C = 0.5 x B. The results
   showed that the different land-use will give different value of carbon
   stocks which is in this study the biggest value of carbon stocks was
   found in monoculture of Gliricidia sp (35.35 tC ha(-1)) compared with
   Gliricidia sp + Leucaena sp (18.83 tC ha(-1)), and Gliricidia sp + Zea
   mays (13.79 tC ha(-1)). The value of biomass and carbon stocks was
   influenced by wood density, trees density, and diameter at breast height
   (dbh).},

Abstract = {A study was conducted to estimate the nutritive value of some selected
   acacia forages using palatability index, in sacco degradability and in
   vitro gas production characteristics. Ten wethers (mean wt. 18 +/-3.5
   kg) were offered Acacia tortilis, Acacia nilotica, Acacia mellifera,
   Acacia brevispica, Acacia senegal and Leucaena leucocephala (control)
   using a cafeteria system to determine the species preference by the
   animals. The acacia species were rich in nitrogen and showed variable
   palatability pattern. Significant (p <0.05) differences in relative
   palatability index (RPI) were detected among the species with the
   following ranking: brevispica > leucaena > mellifera > tortilis >
   senegal > nilotica. Acacia nilotica appeared to be of low relative
   palatability with RPI of 24\% and this was attributed to relatively high
   phenolic concentrations. The DM potential degradability (B) and rate of
   degradation (c) of the species were significantly (p <0.05) different,
   ranging from 40.1 to 59.1\% and 0.0285 to 0.0794/h respectively. Acacia
   species had moderate levels of rumen undegradable protein, much higher
   than that in leucaena. In vitro gas production results indicated the
   effect of polyphenolic compounds on the fermentation rate, with lower
   gas production recorded from A. nilotica and tortilis. Based on RPI, A.
   brevispica and mellifera were superior to the rest and comparable to L.
   leucocephala. Long-term feeding trials are required with the superior
   species when used as protein supplements to poor quality diets.},

   screened for their in vitro AH effect using the larval migration
   inhibition (LMI) assay. Three unrelated H. conforms' Mexican strains
   were used (CENID-INIFAP, UADY and UNAM). The role of tannins on the AH
   effect was confirmed by means of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (PVPP), an
   inhibitor of tannins. The different H. conforms strains showed different
   responses to the extracts. Only one plant extract (L. latisiliquum)
   affected the larval migration of the H. conforms strain obtained from
   Yucatan (UADY). Two plants extracts (A. pennatula and L. latisiliquum)
   inhibited the larval migration of the CENID-INIFAP strain. Meanwhile,
   three plant extracts affected larval migration of UNAM strain (A.
   pennatula, L. latisiliquum, P piscipula). Furthermore, UNAM strain was
   affected by extracts at lower doses than CENID-INIFAP and UADY strains.
   These results indicated that the larvae obtained from Yucatan, Mexico,
   were less sensitive to extracts of TRP from the same region suggesting a
   possible adaptation to tannins.},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {587-596},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Vegetation can significantly contribute to stabilise sloping terrain by
   reinforcing the soil: this reinforcement depends on the morphological
   characteristics of the root systems and the tensile strength of single
   roots. This paper describes all investigation on the reinforcing effect
   of soil-root matrix in the laboratory using a modified large shear box
   apparatus (300 mm X 300 mm). Four different species of plant namely
   Vertiveria zizanoides, Leucaena leucocephala, Bixa orellana and Bauhinia
   purpurea were planted in special boxes containing residual soil
   compacted to a known density. The results show that roots significantly
   contribute to the increase in soil shear strength. The presence of the
   roots only affects the apparent cohesion of the soil and no significant
   change in angle of friction is observed. L. leucocephala shows the
   outstanding increase in its root strength in which the strength varies
   with depth and time e.g., under soil suction-free condition (matric
   suction = 0), the roots have increased the cohesion by 116.6\% (0.1 m),
   225.0\% (0.3 m) and 413.4\% (0.5 m) after six months of growth. In
   twelve months, it is observed that the increase in cohesion is more than
   three-fold of the six months growth period at 0.1 m depth. The results
   also indicate that shear strength is influenced by root profile and to
   some extent, the physiological parameters of the plants.},

Abstract = {The ruderal babassu palm (Attalea speciosa) is expanding on large areas
   of degraded Amazon landscapes. Decomposition of leaves and roots is in
   the center of plant:soil interactions. We evaluated decomposition and
   nutrient concentrations of leaves and fine roots of babassu in
   comparison with two exotic reference species, Acacia mangium (slow
   degradability) and Leucaena leucocephala (fast degradability), in a
   138-day litterbag assay carried out in secondary forest stands of
   different age and babassu abundance. We chose 4-mm over 2-mm mesh
   litterbags based on a pilot study. Babassu leaves degraded slower than
   leaves of A. mangium and L. leucocephala, and also had lower nitrogen,
   phosphorus and calcium concentrations in all stages of decomposition. By
   contrast, potassium concentrations in babassu leaves were higher than in
   both reference species at 0 and 50 days. Roots of all three species
   decomposed slower than leaves. Compared to the leaves, both biomass loss
   and nutrient concentrations differed less between babassu and
   reference-species roots, except for lower nitrogen concentration in
   babassu roots. Leaf-litter decomposition of all three species was
   significantly faster in old than in young secondary forest, suggesting
   an acceleration of decomposition along succession. Babassu leaves
   decomposed faster in old babassu-dominated than non-dominated secondary
   forest, pointing to the existence of specialized decomposer communities
   in babassu-dominated stands.},

Abstract = {China has the largest afforestation effort in the world, which was
   implemented in response to large-scale deforestation that has occurred
   over centuries. Although the outcomes for vegetation coverage are clear,
   it remains unclear if these efforts also translate into broader
   conservation outcomes for fauna. Here we use ant communities to assess
   the conservation potential of vegetation undergoing natural regeneration
   and subject to afforestation plantings in valley-type savanna in the
   Hengduan Mountains of southwest China. Species richness was almost
   always highest in the oldest (30 year) sites irrespective of habitat
   type. The two sites that were monocultures of Leucaena leucocephala had
   notably low species richness (1 and 6 species respectively). Plant
   species richness had a significant positive relationship with total ant
   abundance and richness. The number of exotic ant species present had a
   negative relationship with total species richness. Multivariate analysis
   of species presence/absence data found no distinction between ant
   communities of plantation and rehabilitating sites, except for the two
   Leucaena plantation sites. PCA analysis of abundance data found that the
   separation of the sites was dependent upon the analyses conducted. We
   conclude that afforestation efforts are a useful conservation tool,
   regardless of whether these are of regenerating purely native vegetation
   or the creation of novel ecosystems using non-native species. However,
   for plantations the conservation benefits are dependent upon the species
   that are planted.},

Abstract = {The following paper presents research on the conversion of wood wastes
   accessible in Egypt into activated carbon. In this study, wood samples
   of four Egyptian tree species were used: Delonix regia, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Salix mucronata, and Tipuana tipu. The wood scraps were
   soaked in a KOH solution and then carbonized at 600 degrees C under the
   flow of nitrogen; the resulting materials were analyzed by means of
   microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, low-temperature adsorption of
   nitrogen, and an investigation of the surface area using nitrogen
   sorption. The addition of a chemical activator facilitated an increase
   of the surface area up to 603 m(2) g(-1) . In its second part, the work
   aims to experimentally confirm that synthesizing hybrid materials
   consisting of oligothiophene dye (OT) and the obtained activated carbon
   may contribute to improving the applicability of these carbons as dye
   adsorbents. Confocal microscopy, Raman spectra, and SEM-EDX microscopy
   were used to confirm the immobilization of oligomers on the surface of
   carbon hybrid materials. Confocal microscopy in particular is considered
   to be an appropriate technique of detecting the presence of adsorbed 6 T
   molecules on the carbon surface. The presented research is a major step
   towards the application of modified carbons as an attractive and
   inexpensive base for dye molecule adsorption. (C) 2020 Published by

Abstract = {Lignin biodegradation potential of Schizophyllum commune Fr. is studied
   by using sound wood blocks of Ailanthus excelsa, Azadirachta indica,
   Tectona grandis, Eucalyptus sp. and Leucaena leucocephala. Initially, in
   vitro wood decay test showed minor weight loss, but it became rapid
   after one month. After 120 days of incubation, weight loss was minimum
   in T. grandis (24.05\%) whereas it was maximum in A. excelsa (34.44\%).
   Treated test blocks were characterised by enlargement of pits on ray
   cell wall, formation of additional boreholes in rays, separation of
   fibres and cell wall thinning and formation of U'-shape notches. Fungal
   hyphae moved through the xylem cell lumen, and intercellular spaces
   formed in response to separation of fibres. Hyphae traverse in adjacent
   cell through the cell wall pits or by making additional boreholes. In
   all the species studied, xylem fibres and parenchyma (axial and ray)
   cells were more susceptible while vessels were resistant to fungal
   attack. In advanced stage of decay, fibres and axial parenchyma lost
   their rigidity while vessel walls showed uneven thinning. In the tension
   wood, G-fibres remained unaffected initially but loosening and
   separation of gelatinous layer facilitated fungal action and showed
   similar pattern of cell wall deterioration. Among the wood of different
   species studied, Tectona was more resistant whereas Ailanthus was more
   susceptible to fungal attack.},

   Caruaru, PE, Brazil. Treatments were allocated in a split-plot
   arrangement in a randomized complete block design, with four
   replications. Main plots consisted of cropping systems, while the
   split-plots were dedicated to manure sources. Cactus harvest was carried
   out after two years of regrowth. Response variables included both
   production and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium
   (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) concentrations. No differences were observed
   for cactus production between the cropping systems, with an average
   value of 22.1Mg dry matter ha(-1) 2 years(-1). In the intercropped
   systems, greater proximity to the legumes increased the production of
   the cactus in the treatments with the cattle and sheep manure, and
   increased the concentrations of P, K, and Mg, but not of N. The
   introduction of tree legumes, along with the application of manure,
   contributes to an increase in production and nutrient concentration of
   IPA-Sertania cactus.},

Title = {Physical and mechanical wood properties of 14 timber species from
   Northeast Mexico},

Abstract = {Background Thornscrubs are a vegetation type from Northeast Mexico,
   consisting of 60 to 80 tree and shrub species that are used for a wide
   range of constructive, decorative and energy purposes. However, basic
   research of the physical and mechanical wood properties are still needed
   to establish additional uses and, thereby, increase their value in the
   timber industry.
   Method In this research, wood from fourteen native species were studied
   with regard to their basic density (BD), modulus of elasticity (MOE),
   and modulus of rupture (MOR), as well as the relationships between these
   three properties.
   Results Results showed that the BD range was 0.48 g cm(-3) +/- 0.06 to
   0.93 g cm(-3) +/- 0.07, the lowest being for Leucaena leucocephala and
   the highest for Condalia hookeri. MOE range was 6.42 GPa +/- 1.23 to
   15.13 GPa +/- 2.72, corresponding to Diospyros texana and Acacia
   schaffneri respectively. MOR range was 101 MPa +/- 16 to 207 MPa +/- 33
   for Parkinsonia texana and Acacia schaffneri respectively. Correlations
   between BD and MOE, BD and MOR, and MOE and MOR were as follows: r =
   0.67, r = 0.64 and r = 0.87 respectively.
   Conclusion Values of modulus elasticity and rupture of studied species
   make them a promising general utility wood that can be recommended for a
   variety of structural and non-structural uses.},

Abstract = {Six metabolism trials were conducted using four male goats (local
   nondescript breed; BW 13.5. kg) in a crossover design to study the
   supplementary feeding value of fresh foliage of subabul (Leucaena
   leucocephala), sesbania (Sesbania grandiflora), acacia (Acacia
   auriculiformis), jack (Artocarpus heterophyllus), yellow gold mohur
   (Peltophorum ferrugineum) and cashew (Anacardium occidentale).
   Respective foliages were supplemented @ 300 g/head/day to goats fed ad
   libitum quantity of Napier Bajra green fodder as basal feed. The crude
   protein content of NB green fodder, subabul, sesbania, acacia, jack,
   yellow gold mohur and cashew were, respectively, 10.38, 21.31, 34.44,
   15.94, 12.82, 12.69 and 9.69 per cent. Total DM intake (g/day) of goats
   was 380, 444, 459, 477, 424 and 352, respectively, for the six
   experimental diets. Digestibility of DM and OM were enhanced (P<0.05) in
   goats fed on all the tree foliage-supplemented diets, except for that
   supplemented with cashew leaves. Greatest depression was observed in the
   digestibility of NDF (38.32\%) and ADF (23.86\%) when goats were fed on
   cashew (P < 0.05), followed by yellow gold mohur, and jack as
   supplementary feeds. Based on nitrogen and calcium retention and
   nutrient intake data, it was concluded that sesbania, subabul, jack and
   acacia foliage were better than yellow gold mohur and cashew in their
   supplementary role.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of TiO2
   nanocatalyst in fast pyrolysis. Leucaena leucocephala was used as the
   feedstock pyrolyzed in the presence of TiO2 catalyst in a bubbling
   fluidized bed reactor. The influence of pyrolysis temperature, catalytic
   zone temperature and TiO2 catalyst to biomass (T/W) ratio on bio-oil
   production was evaluated. The structure and surface chemistry of TiO2
   catalyst were characterized by various analytical techniques. The
   characteristics and composition of the biomass were also investigated.
   In the absence of the catalyst, the maximum bio-oil yield of 54.21\% was
   achieved at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 degrees C. Regarding the
   influence of catalytic zone temperature, pyrolysis at 600 degrees C
   using the T/W ratio of 1:1 resulted in an upgraded bio-oil product the
   yield of which was 59.98\%. The obtained bio-oil contained 27.1\% oxygen
   content with the HHV of 29.1 MJ/kg, indicating the TiO2 catalyst could
   enhance the yield of bio-oil, accompanied by a decrease in gas
   generation. Moreover, in this study, the maximum yield 67.1\% was
   obtained using 3:1 T/W ratio. The obtained bio-oil consisted of oxygen
   content 24.5\% and generated the highest HHV of 31.5 MJ/kg. Thus, the
   TiO2 catalyst had a potential for improving production efficiency of

Abstract = {Six carbonizing wood vinegars consisting of Dendrocalamus asper
   (Bamboo), Hevea brasiliensis (Rubberwood), Jatropha curcas (Jatropa),
   Leucaena leucocephala (White popinac), Eucalyptus camaldulensis

   anti-lipid peroxidation capacity. Total phenol content was also
   evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteu assay expressed as gallic acid
   equivalent. All wood vinegars exhibited better DPPH radical scavenging
   capacity than positive controls, ascorbic acid and BHT. The wood
   vinegars from bamboo and rubberwood exhibited good antioxidant capacity
   in all assays tested comparable or better than a positive control, BHT.
   In addition the DPPH radical scavenging capacity, hydroxyl free radical
   scavenging capacity, ferric reducing power and anti-lipid peroxidation
   capacity showed good correlations with their total phenolic contents
   with correlation, R-2 values ranging from 0.92-0.99. The results of the
   present study suggested that wood vinegars have high potential to be
   useful as beneficial natural antioxidant compound in feed additives and
   veterinary medicine. In addition the total phenol content in wood and

Abstract = {Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) can establish symbiotic associations
   with several Rhizobium species; however, the effectiveness of most
   strains at fixing nitrogen under field conditions is very low. PRF 81(T)
   is a very effective strain, usually referred to as Rhizobium tropici and
   used successfully in thousands of doses of Commercial inoculants for the
   common bean crop in Brazil; it has shown high rates of nitrogen fixation
   in all areas representative of the crop in the country. Here, we present
   results that indicate that PRF 81(T), although it belongs to the `R.
   tropici group', which includes 10 Rhizobium species, R. tropici, R.
   leucaenae, R. lusitanum, R. multihospitium, R. miluonense, R.
   hainanense, R. calliandrae, R. mayense, R. jaguaris and R. rhizogenes,

   differentiated PRF 81(T) from related species. Differences were also
   confirmed in the analysis of rep-PCR (sharing less than 45\% similarity
   with the other species), MLSA with recA, atpD and rpoB genes, and DNA
   DNA hybridization. The novel species, for which we propose the name
   Rhizobium freirei sp. nov., is able to establish effective root nodule
   symbioses with Phaseolus vulgaris, Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena
   esculenta, Crotalaria juncea and Macroptilium atropurpureum. The type

   resilience and nutrient poor adaptation in native plants under
   serpentine driven edaphic challenges},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {373},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Serpentine soils are characterized by high concentrations of heavy
   metals (HMs) and limited essential nutrients with remarkable endemic
   plant diversity, yet the mechanisms enabling plant adaptation to thrive
   in such harsh environments remain largely unknown. Full-length 16S rRNA
   amplicon sequencing, coupled with physiological and functional assays,
   was used to explore root-associated bacterial community composition and
   their metabolic and ecological functions. The results revealed that
   serpentine plant species exhibited significantly higher metal transfer
   factor values compared to non-serpentine plant species, particularly
   evident in Bidens pilosa, Miscanthus floridulus, and Leucaena
   leucocephala. The serpentine root-associated microbes showed a higher
   utilization of carboxylic acid, whereas carbohydrate utilization was
   higher in the non-serpentine site. Zymomonas mobilis and Flavabacterium
   sp. exhibited high resistance to heavy metal concentrations, showing
   greater adaptability, while, Staphylococcus carnosus showed sensitivity
   to HMs, showing limited adaptability. Moreover, Ni, Cr, and Co
   resistance genes were found, while nitrogen and phosphorous metabolism
   genes were less abundant in the serpentine site compared to the
   non-serpentine site. Furthermore, Flavobacterium sp. had a strong
   positive relationship with Cd and Cu, Zymomonas mobilis with Ni, and Cr,
   Streptomyces sp. with Co, and Staphylococcus carnosus with N and P
   cycling. These findings underscore critical role of root-associated
   bacterial communities and distinctive soil conditions of serpentine
   habitats in fostering ecological adaptation of native plant species to
   the challenges posed by HMs and nutrient deficiencies.},

Abstract = {Symbiotic nitrogen fixation between legumes and rhizobia involves a
   coordinated expression of many plant and bacterial genes as well as
   finely tuned metabolic activities of micro- and macrosymbionts. In spite
   of such complex interactions, symbiotic proficiency remains a resilient
   process, with host plants apparently capable of compensating for some
   deficiencies in rhizobia. What controls nodule homeostasis is still
   poorly understood and probably varies between plant species. In this
   respect, the promiscuous Sinorhizobium (Ensifer) fredii strain NGR234
   has become a model to assess the relative contribution of single gene
   products to many symbioses. Here, we describe how a deletion in nifQ of
   NGR234 (strain NGR Delta nifQ) makes nodules of Vigna unguiculata, V.
   radiata, and Macroptilium atropurpureum but not of the mimisoid tree
   Leucaena leucocephala, purple-red. This peculiar dark-nodule phenotype
   did not necessarily correlate with a decreased proficiency of NGR Delta
   nifQ but coincided with a 20-fold or more accumulation of coproporphyrin
   III and uroporphyrin III in V. unguiculata nodules. Porphyrin
   accumulation was not restricted to plant cells infected with bacteroids
   but also extended to the nodule cortex. Nodule metal-homeostasis was
   altered but not sufficiently to prevent assembly and functioning of
   nitrogenase. Although the role of NifQ in donating molybdenum during
   assembly of nitrogenase cofactor FeMo-co makes it essential in
   free-living diazotrophs, our results highlight the dispensability of
   NifQ in many legume species.},

Title = {Land use legacy effects on structure and composition of subtropical dry

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {335},
Pages = {270-280},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forests are subject to intense human pressure and land
   change, including conversion to agricultural crops, pasture or
   agroforestry, and urban encroachment. Decades, and even centuries, of
   conversion, expansion, regrowth, and changing land-use practices can
   result in a mosaic of secondary growth patches with different land-use
   histories. Whereas post-agricultural landscapes may appear as contiguous
   areas of forest regeneration, the successional trajectory of forest
   patches from historic land cover to their current state may differ
   substantially, with consequences for species composition and ecosystem
   structure and function. We examined the effect of different land-use
   histories on current forest structure, biomass, and composition in
   subtropical dry forests in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. We sampled
   three types of secondary forests that followed different regeneration
   pathways after centuries of sugarcane agriculture: 40-year old secondary
   forests that naturally regenerated after sugarcane abandonment, 40-year
   old secondary forests that were reforested with timber plantations
   before management ceased and they were overtaken by natural succession,
   and 10-year old secondary forests that were intensive pasture prior to
   recent forest regeneration. Secondary forests that naturally regenerated
   after sugarcane had similar structural characteristics, in terms of
   basal area, stem density, aboveground biomass, and species diversity
   compared to secondary forests of the same age that were former
   plantations. Species composition, however, remained distinct.
   Compositional differences between the two types of 40-year old secondary
   forests could be partially attributed to plantation species,
   specifically Swietenia mahagoni, whereas naturally regenerated forests
   were dominated by common secondary forest species, such as Melicoccus
   bijugatus and Cordia alba. The effects of hurricane damage helped to
   explain structural similarity and compositional dissimilarity between
   naturally regenerated secondary forests and former plantations. Forest
   age had a significant effect on forest structure and composition.
   Differences between 10-year old and both types of 40-year old secondary
   forests were driven by a dominance of the nitrogen-fixing species
   Leucaena leucocephala, which rapidly established in 10-year old
   secondary forests and resulted in greater stem density and lower basal
   area, biomass, and species richness. Our results show that land-use
   history plays an important role in shaping species composition,
   especially in post-agricultural tropical dry forests. Although forests
   with differing land-use histories may structurally resemble one another
   within decades of abandonment, species composition may remain distinct
   for much longer. Understanding the legacy of human land use is important
   for dry forests that have a long history of disturbance and for
   predicting their response to future environmental change. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Nitrogen (N), the nutrient most required for plant growth, is key for
   good yield of agriculturally important crops. Common bean (Phase his
   vulgaris L.) can benefit from bacteria collectively called rhizobia,
   which are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen (N-2) in root nodules
   and supplying it to the plant. Common bean is amongst the most
   promiscuous legume hosts; several described species, in addition to
   putative novel ones have been reported as able to nodulate this legume,
   although not always effectively in terms of fixing N-2. In this study,
   we present data indicating that Brazilian strains PRF 35(T), PRF 54,
   CPAO 1135 and H 52, currently classified as Rhizobium tropici, represent
   a novel species symbiont of common bean. Morphological, physiological
   and biochemical properties differentiate these strains from other
   species of the genus Rhizobium, as do BOX-PCR profiles (less than 60\%
   similarity), multilocus sequence analysis with recA, gyrB and rpoA (less
   than 96.4 \% sequence similarity), DNA-DNA hybridization (less than 50\%
   DNA-DNA relatedness), and average nucleotide identity of whole genomes
   (less than 92.8.\%). The novel species is effective in nodulating and
   fixing N-2 with P. vulgaris, Leucaena leucocephala and Leucaena
   esculenta. We propose the name Rhizobium paranaense sp. nov. for this
   novel taxon, with strain PRF 35(T) (=CNPSo 120(T)=LMG 27577(T)=IPR-Pv
   1249(T)) as the type strain.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of suckling calves
   fed diets with and without legume hay. The experimental period was of 60
   days, with solid food being offered ad libitum and available from the 10
   th day of the life of the animal, and milk in natura restricted to 4
   litres per day, divided into two equal meals. The following diets were
   evaluated: concentrated feed, concentrated feed and leucaena hay
   (Leucaena leucocephala Lam. De Wit) and concentrated feed with alfalfa
   hay (Medicago sativa L.). Fifteen Girolando animals were used,
   distributed over three treatments in an unbalanced random block design.
   The parameters under evaluation were: initial body weight (at birth -
   IBW), final body weight (FBW), average daily gain (ADG), wither height
   (HW), croup height (HC), thoracic perimeter (PT), dry matter intake
   (DMI) and feed conversion (FC). No difference was seen in animal
   performance in relation to the treatments, with averages of 32.9 (+/-
   2.9) kg, 67.7 (+/- 1.2) kg, 0.58 (+/- 0.02) kg, 13.1 (+/- 0.5) cm, 13.7
   (+/- 0.3) cm, 20.6 (+/- 0.7) cm, 0.46 (+/- 0.1) and 0.79 kg (+/- 0.1)
   for the parameters IBW, FBW, ADG, HW, HC, PT, DMI and FC respectively.
   The nutritional requirements of suckling calves are met by supplying
   milk and concentrated feed; there being no need to include legume hay in
   the diet.},

   the subtropics of northern Australia},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},
Pages = {332-342},
Abstract = {This study measured forage biomass production, diet quality, cattle
   liveweight gain, and economic performance of six forage types at 21
   sites across 12 commercial beef cattle properties in the Fitzroy River
   catchment of Queensland during 2011-2014 (28 annual datasets in total).
   The forages were annual forage crops (oats (Avena sativa), sorghum
   (Sorghum spp.) and lablab (Lablab purpureus)), sown perennial
   legume-grass pastures (leucaena-grass (Leucaena leucocephala spp.
   glabrata + perennial, tropical grass (C-4) species) and butterfly
   peagrass (Clitoria ternatea + perennial, C-4, grass species)), and
   perennial, C-4, grass pastures. The sown forages resulted in 1.2-2.6
   times the annual cattle liveweight gain per ha than perennial grass
   pastures. Annual cattle liveweight gain per ha, forage establishment and
   management costs, and cattle price margin (sale price less purchase
   price, \$/kg liveweight) all influenced gross margin, however, none was
   an overriding factor. The average gross margins (\$/ha. annum)
   calculated using contractor rates, ranked from highest to lowest, were:
   leucaena-grass pastures, 181; butterfly pea-grass pastures, 140; oats,
   102; perennial grass, 96; sorghum, 24; and lablab, 18. It was concluded
   that the tendency towards greater average gross margins for perennial
   legume-grass pastures than for annual forage crops or perennial grass
   pastures was the result of the combined effects of lower average forage
   costs and high cattle productivity.},

   some winter frost damage was not a problem, L. leucocephala K636 and
   hybrids containing L, diversifolia and L. pallida have the most promise.
   Lf total lack of damage to -7 degrees C is essential, species such as L.
   retusa, L. pulverulenta (seedlot 61, 62) and hybrids such as L. retusa x
   L. greggii (53) and L retusa x L. pulverulenta (55) have the greatest
   potential. This study examined only one family from each of the
   cold-hardy species as a parent in the promising hybrids. As extensive
   intraspecific genetic variation is present within these leucaena species
   there is great potential to find hybrids with much better combinations
   of cold hardiness, forage production, leaf protein and dry matter

   still reserves for further plant growth and appear therefore to be good
   mulch sources for annual crops. In contrast, wheat seedlings treated

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {46},

Abstract = {Invasive plant species (IPS) have a high potential for expanding within
   biodiversity hotspots and threatening global plant diversity. Hence, it
   is urgent to assess the expansion risk of IPS in regions of high plant
   diversity and their potentially negative effects throughout the world.
   We used the world's 36 worst IPS as focal study species and applied
   species distribution modeling to project the suitable habitat
   distributions of these IPS in centers of plant diversity at the global
   scale. Subsequently, we assessed the expansion risk of IPS based on
   habitat suitability across biomes and nature reserves. We found that
   IPS, particularly Chromolaena odorata, Eichhornia crassipes, Leucaena
   leucocephala, and Mimosa pigra, have high expansion potential in
   Tropical \& Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests, Tropical \& Subtropical
   Dry Broadleaf Forests, and Mangroves within global regions of high plant
   diversity. Furthermore, IPS such as Imperata cylindrica and L.
   leucocephala may expand dramatically into Vulnerable and Critical or
   Endangered biome areas, including nature reserves across Tropical \&
   Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests and Tropical \& Subtropical
   Coniferous Forests. We suggest that effective conservation management
   should be enhanced in order to reduce the expansion risk of IPS in the
   Vulnerable and Critical or Endangered biome areas, that temperature
   changes should be carefully monitored, and that conservation policies of
   nature reserves should be reviewed, particularly regarding IPS with high
   potential to naturally disperse into the nature reserves.},

Title = {What do farmers think? Farmer evaluations of hedgerow intercropping
   under semi-arid conditions},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-28},
Abstract = {Results from farmer evaluations of exploratory on-farm trials with
   hedgerow intercropping in a semi-arid region of Kenya (the Yatta Plateau
   of Machakos District) are presented. Hedgerows of Cassia siamea,
   Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala, which were managed by eight
   farmers to enhance soil fertility, were established in the mid-1980s.
   Although trial farmers appear convinced of the ability of the technology
   to increase crop yields, reduce erosion and provide firewood, most did
   not feel that the short-term risks (i.e. reduction in crop productivity)
   and the extra labour required were worth the long-term benefits. Hence,
   few of the eight farmers were willing to extend their hedges. The
   discussion suggests that in the risky production environment of the
   Yatta Plateau, where crop yields fluctuate constantly with the amount of
   rainfall, soil fertility is not of urgent concern to farmers. A
   participatory case study approach, which emphasizes farmers' opinions,
   preferences and ideas elicited through regular farmer evaluation
   exercises, as distinct from on-farm technology testing for validation,
   is recommended for on-farm research on new and complex agroforestry
   technologies. This approach permits better understanding of some of the
   complex socio-economic factors affecting the adoption of hedgerow
   intercropping and is the most cost-effective way to gather in-depth and
   contextual information on farmer decision-making and management of
   externally introduced agroforestry technologies.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Poisonous plants cause tremendous economic losses to the livestock
   industry. These economic losses are deterioration in their health,
   decreased productivity, deformed offspring, and reduced longevity. The
   current study is the first comprehensive report on poisonous plants of
   Azad Jammu and Kashmir which systematically documents the
   phytotoxicological effect and mode of action in livestock. The
   information was gathered from 271 informants including 167 men and 104
   women through semi-structured interviews and literature search through
   available databases. The data collected through interviews was analyzed
   with quantitative tools viz. the factor informant consensus and fidelity
   level. A total of 38 species of flowering plants belonging to 23
   families and 38 genera were reported. Family Asteraceae (5 spp) was the
   most dominant, followed by Solanaceae (4 spp), Fabaceae (4 spp),
   Euphorbiaceae (4 spp) and Convolvulaceae (3 spp). Among all the species
   collected, herbs were the dominant life form (22 spp, 57.89\%), trailed
   by shrubs (11 spp, 28.95\%), and trees (5 spp, 13.16\%). Whole plant
   toxicity was reported to be the highest (15 spp, 39.47\%), followed by
   leaf toxicity (12 spp, 31.58\%), seed toxicity (4 spp, 7.89\%), fruit
   toxicity (3 spp, 10.53\%), latex toxicity (2 spp, 5.26\%), flowers
   toxicity (1 spp, 2.63\%), and berries toxicity (1 spp, 2.63\%). The most
   toxic route of administration was found oral (39 spp, 40.63\%), followed
   by intraperitoneal (24 spp, 25\%), and intravenous (21 spp, 21.88\%).
   The most commonly affected organ was found liver (20.41\%), followed by
   gastrointestinal tract (20.341\%), CNS (16.33\%), skin (14.29\%),
   kidneys (12.24\%), lungs (4.04\%), reproductive organs (2.04\%), spleen
   (1.75\%), blood (1.75\%), heart (1.75\%), urinary tract (1.75\%), and
   pancreas (1.75\%). The maximum Fic value was found for dermatological
   disorders (0.91), followed by the endocrine system (0.90),
   gastrointestinal (0.82), neurology (0.77), nephrology (0.67),
   cardiovascular (0.67), urinary (0.67), respiratory (0.60), sexual (0.60)
   disorders. Senecio vulgaris, and Ageratum conyzoides were the most
   important plants with fidelity level (0.95) and (0.87). Nerium oleander,
   Lantana camara, Leucaena leucocephala, and Ricinus communis were the
   important poisonous plant with maximum fidelity level (100\%). Ricinus
   communis with reported lowest LD50 (<20 mg/kg) was the top-ranked
   poisonous plant followed by Lantana camara and Justicia adhatoda (25-50
   mg/kg), Nerium Oleander (157.37 mg/kg), and Datura innoxia (400 mg/kg).
   We found that knowledge about poisonous plants is less prevailing in the
   rural areas of Azad Kashmir compared to the knowledge about medicinal
   plants and poisonous nature of reported plants is due to production of
   toxic substances and presence of essential oils.},

Abstract = {Over the past few years, burning agricultural or crop residues has

   this study, constant endeavours were made to achieve the first-hand
   emission factors (EFs) of water-soluble ionic species (WSIS), organic
   carbon, elemental carbon, and selected metals emitted from the
   combustion of 17 plant species. The average EF values of organic carbon
   (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) ranged from 280 g kg??? 1 to 1441 g kg???
   1 and from 32 g kg??? 1 to 142 g kg- 1, respectively. Sugarcane burning
   shows the highest EFs of toxic metals, such as V, Cr, Co, Ni, and Pb,
   which is concerning because Thailand is the world???s second largest
   sugar exporter. The comparatively high percentage contribution of Cl???
   coupled with extremely low levels of K+ resulted in questions on its
   reliability as a chemical tracer for maritime aerosols and biomass
   burning particles, respectively. OC/EC ratios varied from 4.68 (Leucaena
   leucocephala) to 11.4 (Terminalia catappa) with the average value of
   8.88 ?? 1.72. Further attempts to investigate the most suitable
   diagnostic binary ratios of metals representing biomass burning were
   conducted using 2D plots of Zn/Mn, Fe/Zn, Fe/Cu, Ni/Co, Mn/Cr, Ni/V,
   Al/Si, and Pb/As. In this study, Mn/Cr versus Ni/V and Pb/As versus
   Al/Si can be used as diagnostic binary ratios to classify

Abstract = {Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), an annual tropical/sub-tropical
   tuber crop, was nutritionally evaluated as a foliage for ruminants
   especially for dairy cattle. Cultivation of cassava biomass to produce
   hay at three months after planting and followed every one-two months
   thereafter until one year, produced a collective DM yield of 11 786
   kg/ha. Intercropping of leguminous fodder in rows like Leucaena
   leucocephala would enrich soil fertility and provide additional fodder.
   Cassava hay contained 24.9\% CP and with very minimal HCN content (0.348
   mg\%). Feeding trials with cattle revealed high levels of DM intake
   (11.2 kg/hd/d, 3.2\% BW) and DM digestibility (71\%). Ruminal protein
   degradation of cassava hay was relatively low (48.8\%) since it
   contained tannin-protein complexes which would act as by-pass protein in
   the small intestine. Therefore, supplementation with cassava hay at 2-3
   kg/hd/d or provision as a sole source of roughage in dairy cattle could
   remarkably reduce concentrate supplementation and increase the fat and
   protein content of milk. Moreover, cassava hay supplementation in dairy
   cattle will significantly increase milk thiocyanate which could possibly
   enhance milk quality and milk storage especially in small holder-dairy
   farming. Cassava hay was therefore an excellent source of supplemental
   protein (by-pass protein) for dairy cattle especially during the long
   dry season and has the potential to increase productivity and

Abstract = {Albizia niopoides (Spruce ex. Bewth.) Burkart, a fast growing leguminous
   tree species, is an exotic in Nigeria. This nodulating species is
   evaluated for its potentials for agroforestry. Various investigations
   were carried out including those that have implications on research and
   later farmers' ability to easily establish plantings of this species,
   Seed germination was significantly better (50\%) after 4-hour treatment
   in warm water than in the control (26\%), No significant differences
   were observed in the cold-water treatment. A. niopoides seed also
   germinated much earlier and better at a sowing depth of 0.5 cm.
   Albizia niopoides and Leucaena leucocephala mulch supported better maize
   growth in the glasshouse than Millettia thonningii mulch. Stem and leaf
   dry weights of the test crop (maize) were significantly higher in the
   Albizia and Leucaena mulches than in the Milletia mulch treatment.
   Albizia requires rhizobium inoculation where native rhizobia is probably
   nor available. Inoculation with 10 ml of rhizobium triggered height
   (102.4 cm), diameter (1.18 cm), and also encouraged leaf number
   increment (20.1), leaf area increment (231.2 cm(2)) and other growth
   parameters including stem (61.0\%). leaf (18.83 g) and root (78.9 g) dry
   weights. With all this information now available on seed, seedling
   growth, etc., the agroforestry potential of Albizia niopoides is now
   better understood.},

Title = {Economic-environmental assessment of silvo-pastoral systems in Colombia:
   An ecosystem service perspective},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Cattle production in Colombia has an important social and economic role
   but causes considerable environmental impacts, such as deforestation and
   greenhouse gas emissions by ruminants, particularly methane. Thus,
   technological innovations aimed at reducing these impacts must focus on
   both economic and environmental sustainability. Silvo-pastoral systems
   (SPS) offer productivity increases while generating environmental
   benefits and ecosystem services and are therefore at the center of
   debate around sustainable production alternatives. The objective of this
   article is to evaluate the economic-environmental performance of two
   proposed SPS for a cattle fattening system for the Colombian context:
   (i) Urochloa brizantha cv. Toledo and (ii) Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman,
   both in association with Leucaena leucocephala trees for browsing and
   shade provision. They are compared with the respective base scenarios of
   only using the grasses in monocultures. The study consists of a
   financial analysis, which estimates potential profitability increases in
   beef production in the SPS, and an environmental evaluation, which
   estimates the monetary values of microclimatic regulation and reduction
   of methane emissions. The value of methane emission reductions is then
   integrated into a combined economic-environmental evaluation. Results
   show that both SPS improve the profitability indicators of the
   production system and reduce the probability of economic loss. Likewise,
   the reduction of methane emissions in the SPS is estimated at US\$6.12
   per cattle, and the economic value of microclimatic regulation at US
   \$2,026 per hectare.},

Abstract = {This study estimated 18.35 Mg C/ha in standing biomass of natural forest
   and 15 Mg C/ha in Hardwickia binata Roxb. plantation in a tropical dry
   deciduous forest located in the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. The
   study area of Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM), Bhopal,
   resembled a degraded dry scrubland in 1988 and for over about three
   decades, the degraded forest recovered remarkably, and ecological
   processes evolved favorably with canopy cover reaching over 60\% in some
   patches and about 50\% in general at most part of the campus. The study
   was conducted in 18 randomly laid plots in natural forest and over
   one-acre (0.405-ha) plantation area of Hardwickia binata for assessing
   the above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass and subsequent carbon
   content. The lower-diameter classes accounted for the maximum
   above-ground biomass, basal area and tree density. The forest is
   predominantly occupied by Leucaena leucocephala, an exotic tree species
   which showed higher standing biomass carbon storage of 3.79 Mg C/ha
   followed by Holoptelea integrifolia (2.11 Mg C/ha), Azadirachta indica
   (1.29 Mg C/ha), Gardenia latifolia (1.26 Mg C/ha) and Lannea
   coromandelica (1.24 Mg C/ha) besides Hardwickia binata plantation (15 Mg
   C/ha). It is recommended to plant and promote local native tree species
   in the urban forests of tropical dry deciduous nature as a means to
   mitigate climate change effects.},

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {35},

Pages = {155-163},
Abstract = {Two trials were carried out over five growing seasons in western
   Tanzania to investigate (a) forage production and quality of eight lines
   of Leucaena leucocephala, one of L. diversifolia and one of L. esculenta
   and (b) the effect of cutting height (25, 50 and 75 cm) on forage
   production of nine lines of L. leucocephala and one of L. diversifolia.
   The locally naturalized lines, T1 and K1, were consistently better in
   yield, out-producing the commercial L. leucocephala cultivars
   Cunningham, Peru and Ks in three or four out of the five seasons'
   harvests. Mean daily dry matter yields for all lines decreased as the
   dry season progressed. Mean yields were 54.9, 28.6 and 12.8 kg/ha/day in
   the rainy season, late rainy season/early dry season and late dry
   season, respectively. The concentrations of N (2.3 to 3.1\%), P (0.13 to
   0.17\%), K (0.7 to 1.3\%), Ca (0.6 to 1.6\%) and Mg (0.4 to 0.6\%) in
   the edible forage declined as the dry season became pronounced but were
   at levels sufficient for animal production except for P levels, which
   were low. Three distinct yield groups emerged from responses to cutting
   height: cv. Cunningham produced the greatest yields of edible forage at
   25 cm cutting height; cv. Peru, cv. K8, Korog, Tl, CPI 90790 and CPI
   58394 at 50 cm; and CPI 58398, CPI 84511 and CPI 85132 at 75 cm.},

Abstract = {Many browse plants are undervalued due to insufficient knowledge about
   their potential feeding value. The study was conducted to evaluate the
   chemical composition, in vitro ruminal dry matter degradability (DRD)
   and dry matter intake of Melia azedarach, Leucaena leucocephala, Searsia
   lancea, Moringa oleifera and Acacia hebeclada. Matured leaves were
   collected and dried at room temperature and then analyzed in a
   completely randomized design. Chemical composition, ruminal dry matter
   degradability and dry matter intake were determined and estimated,
   respectively. The crude protein (CP) content ranged from 108.0 to 258.3
   g/kg DM and neutral detergent fiber from 306.1 to 492.7 g/kg DM. In
   vitro dry matter degradability at all incubation periods for M. oleifera
   was significantly higher than those of other browse plants. There was a
   negative correlation between metabolizable energy and fiber content and
   a positive correlation to crude protein content. All browse species had
   CP values of above 10\% which is above the minimum required in diet for
   adequate digestive activities. M. oleifera, L. leucocephala and M.
   azedarach leaves had the highest metabolizable energy, dry matter
   intake, total digestible nutrients, relative feed value and dry matter
   degradability compared to other browse plants. The results from the
   study suggest that M. oleifera, M. azedarach and L. leucocephala can be
   recommended to be used as a supplement during dry season and in case of
   low-quality forage feeding.},

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {84},
Number = {2},
Pages = {287-297},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In seasonally dry environments maintaining year-round production of
   silvopastoral systems can be challenging due to drought effects on
   vegetation. Different tree species native to dry forests may show
   contrasting strategies to deal with drought, which could impact
   silvopastoral productivity. We assessed the differential effect of
   drought on seedlings of five tree species from a dry tropical forest
   with high forage potential. The species were subjected to three
   irrigation schemes (well-watered, mild drought, severe drought) in order
   to evaluate the effect of water stress on 12 growth and
   morpho-physiological traits involving above and below ground responses.
   The species comprised four species of the family Fabaceae (legumes)
   Albizia lebbeck, Leucaena leucocephala, Piscidia piscipula, and Lysiloma
   latisiliquum and one of the family Sterculiaceae, Guazuma ulmifolia.
   This one was the most productive species when well-watered, with the
   highest forage potential due to high leaf area, leaf mass and fast
   growth rates. This species was also the most vulnerable to drought,
   reducing leaf area and other growth parameters dramatically. In
   contrast, L. latisiliquum showed low leaf area and leaf mass, but was
   highly resistant to drought. An intermediate species was P. piscipula,
   which was the most productive of the legume species and exhibited
   adjustment mechanisms to drought which allowed reduced leaf excision
   during the severe drought. We propose that combining species with
   contrasting mechanisms in response to drought can promote year-round
   productivity in seasonally dry environments.},

Title = {Termite damage to maize grown in agroforestry systems, traditional
   fallows and monoculture on nitrogen-limited soils in eastern Zambia},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-69},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1 Termites cause significant damage to maize and other crops in southern
   Africa. Several studies were conducted with the objective of determining
   the difference in termite damage to maize in various land use systems
   between monoculture maize, maize grown using traditional fallows and
   improved fallows.
   2 In an experiment conducted at four sites on noncoppicing fallows,
   maize planted after Tephrosia candida 02971 fallows had lower termite
   damage compared with fully fertilized monoculture maize. However, the
   termite suppression was not low enough to warrant rotation of
   noncoppicing fallows for termite management..
   3 In four experiments comparing termite damage to maize grown in
   monoculture and in coppicing fallows, fully fertilized monoculture maize
   had a higher percentage of lodged plants compared with maize grown in
   pure Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Acacia anguistissima
   fallows or in a mixture of A. anguistissima + Sesbania sesban or
   Tephrosia vogelii + S. sesban.
   4 More than 50-75\% of the variance in maize yield was explained by
   preseason inorganic nitrogen and termite damage. However, termite damage
   to maize was not influenced by inorganic nitrogen, which represents
   nitrogen readily available to maize. The decomposition rate of biomass
   (related to lignin + polyphenol to nitrogen ratio) and water retention
   under fallows also appeared to influence termite damage.
   5 It is concluded that maize grown in L. leucocephala, G. sepium, A.
   anguistissima and S. sesban fallows suffers less termite damage and
   produces maize yields comparable with conventionally tilled and fully
   fertilized monoculture maize.},

   Isolates within cluster 9 grouped into a single cluster above a
   similarity level of 90.6\% in a cluster analysis based on protein
   SDS-PACE, and they were differentiated from defined rhizobial species.
   Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that isolate
   CCBAU 71623(T), representing cluster 9, was most related to Rhizobium
   gallicum and Rhizobium mongolense. The DNA-DNA homologies were lower
   than 42.4\% among cluster 9 and defined species, including R. gallicum
   and R. mongolense. These data indicated that cluster 9 was a unique
   genomic species. Isolates within this cluster could share their host
   plants. They could not nodulate Galega orientalis and Leucaena
   leucocephala and formed ineffective nodules on Phaseolus vulgaris. This
   group could also be differentiated from defined species by phenotypic
   characteristics. It is therefore proposed as a new species, Rhizobium
   yanglingense, with isolate CCBAU 71623 as the type strain.},

Abstract = {Agricultural use of waste office paper as a soil amendment is restricted

   Mixing of locally-available N sources of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lamb) de Witt) and chicken manure with paper or composting those
   mixtures for 49 days (d) reduced C:N ratios and the potential for N
   immobilization but increased Lignin and polyphenol contents of the
   mixtures. A minimum of between 64 to 74 percent leucaena or 82 to 85
   percent chicken manure to paper mixtures was needed to overcome N
   immobilization over a six month period in two common soils on Guam. Soil
   N mineralization was significantly related to total N, lignin,
   cellulose, d:N ratio and the cellulose:N ratios of the paper mixtures
   but not to the lignin:N and the (lignin+polyphenol):N ratios. In the
   field, an application of between 200 to 400 kg N ha(-1) of N fertilizer
   was required to overcome N immobilization in a crop of sweet corn to
   which 14 Mg ha(-1) of paper had been added. In addition, soil test
   results suggest that early season N loss by leaching of high rates of N
   fertilizer may have been reduced by N immobilization after waste paper
   was applied.},

Abstract = {Small-scale dairy farming in Bangladesh is constrained mostly due to
   acute shortage, high price and seasonal fluctuation of energy and
   protein supplements. Poor economic conditions of dairy farmers do not
   allow them to purchase adequate conventional energy and protein
   supplements. Locally available non-conventional energy and protein
   sources can be used as alternatives, cheaper than conventional energy
   and protein sources. Non-conventional feedstuffs are deficient in
   certain macro and micro nutrients. As a result, formulation of a
   least-cost balanced ration using non-conventional feedstuffs is a major
   challenge for marginal farmers. The current study presents a least-cost
   formulation plan for the small-scale dairy farmers using locally
   available low-cost non-conventional feedstuffs. A simple Microsoft Excel
   program with `Solver Add-ins' has been used to formulate least-cost
   rations for crossbred and indigenous dairy cows. The step by step
   logical procedure ensured that the ration was balanced for most of the
   key nutrients, was least-cost and gave the user significant control over
   the formulation process. Incorporation of multipurpose low cost
   neglected forages such as water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes),
   helencha (Enhydra fluctuans), ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala) and
   their subsequent effect on cost minimization is discussed. This
   formulation method may be recommended for use by small-scale dairy
   farmers as well as livestock extension workers who wish to formulate
   least-cost dairy rations using locally available feed sources to
   optimize the feeding of dairy animals at farm level.},

Abstract = {In 1961 de Wit typified Mimosa latisiliqua L., Sp. Pl. 1:519 (1753), the

   (L.) Gillis, by a Plumier illustration published by Burman in 1755 but
   based on one among 500 Plumier drawings seen by Linnaeus in Holland in
   1738. Gillis and Stearn (1974) rejected this typification on the ground
   that this illustration was not available to Linnaeus when preparing the
   Species Plantarum (1753); that there was no evidence of his making notes
   on these drawings in 1738 for later use and that he must have had
   another source of evidence. The second 2 suppositions can now be proved
   incorrect. Linnaeus''s notes were found in an interleaved copy of the
   1st edition of his Genera Plantarum (1737). They included a reference to
   the Plumier plant which he later named Mimosa latisiliqua and also to
   many other West Indian species drawn by Plumier. The type of M.

Abstract = {Tropical grassland soils, especially those with alkaline properties,
   often exhibit limited phosphorus availability due to its precipitation
   in insoluble forms. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and rhizobia
   have demonstrated their potential to enhance the availability of this
   nutrient and promote the growth of forage legumes. This study, conducted
   under controlled conditions in a mesh house, evaluated the effect of
   co-inoculation with PSB, including Micrococcus sp. Sfcm-14-01,
   Agrobacterium sp. Sfl-043-09, and Enterobacter sp. Sfcm-014-02 and
   Sfcm-054-06, along with rhizobia (Ensifer terangae R1-012-02 and
   Bradyrhizobium glycinis Rcm-025-01), under different levels of
   phosphorus fertilization on the legumes Leucaena leucocephala and
   Centrosema macrocarpum. The results indicate significant increases in
   various growth parameters, such as chlorophyll levels (SPAD), biomass
   (dry weight of roots and aerial parts) (mg), the foliar phosphorus
   concentration (ppm), and the concentration of available phosphorus in
   the soil, particularly under low-phosphorus fertilization conditions.
   The highest level of available phosphorus in the soil was achieved with
   75\% of the recommended fertilization dose, resulting in concentrations
   of 13.73 ppm for L. leucocephala and 7.69 ppm for C. macrocarpum,
   representing increases in phosphorus availability of 170.81\% and
   240.27\%, respectively, compared with no fertilization or inoculation.
   These findings suggest that the co-inoculation of PSB and native
   rhizobia is a promising strategy to enhance the biomass productivity and
   mineral content of forage in tropical grazing systems, especially under
   phosphorus-limited conditions.},

Abstract = {The objective of the research was to evaluate the structure and
   diversity of a fragment of dry deciduous forest in Manabi, Ecuador.
   Thirty plots of 0.10 ha were established, equally distributed in the
   human settlements La Pila Vieja, San Francisco, Quimis, Via a Membrillal
   and Las Mercedes, where individuals of tree species =2 m in height and
   diameter at 1, 30 m =5 cm, validated using the rarefaction curve.
   Structure and diversity were evaluated with the Shannon and Pielou
   Equity indices compared to the baseline of a conserved Macara forest in
   Loja. The affectation to the forest by community was carried out through
   a cluster analysis using the species and abundances, with the Dice
   similarity index and a correspondence analysis between the richness of
   species and communities. 1397 individuals belonging to 61 species were
   recorded. The cluster and correspondence analysis indicated differences
   in the structure of the forest in the five sectors, but without
   notoriety in relation to the baseline. Overall, Shannon diversity was
   rated as medium influenced by abundant and dominant species. Three
   structurally differentiated groups were identified. The ecologically
   important species were: Ceiba trichistandra, Bursera graveolens, Guazuma
   ulmifolia, Leucaena leucocephala and Cordia lutea; while on the other
   hand they register little natural regeneration despite being abundant in
   the adult mass. What should affect restoration actions as part of the
   management and conservation for the maintenance of the structure and
   composition in this fragment of forest.},

   homogeneous l-mimosine,
   alpha-amino-beta-(3-hydoxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridin-1-yl)-propanoic
   acid, a non-proteinogenic amino acid, has been successfully isolated and
   purified on an industrial scale from wild leaves of Leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala de Wit) which is a widely distributed legume in Okinawa, a
   sub-tropical island in Japan. Optical purity determinations used for
   quality control have been established through diastereomer formation.
   Physico-chemical properties and biological properties of purified
   mimosine have been clarified. Mimosine is sparingly soluble in water and
   organic solvents but can be dissolved in aqueous alkaline solution. The
   tyrosinase pathway is of particular interest in the cosmetic field,
   since mimosine is an analog of tyrosine. Thus the present purified
   mimosine have been tested in tyrosinase inhibitory assays. The IC50 for
   tyrosinase inhibitory activity of purified Mim was compared with kojic
   acid. Mimosine shows significant inhibition of melanin production in
   murine melanoma cells. The derivatization of mimosine has been
   investigated with a focus on its use in conventional peptide syntheses
   to generate mimosyl peptides. N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy)-mimosine
   and resin-bound mimosine for solid-phase syntheses have also been
   performed. Highly homogeneous Mim is a useful material for the
   development of functional cosmetics or active pharmaceutical

Abstract = {With recent advances in rhizobial phylogeny, questions are being asked
   as to how an ecological framework can be developed so that rhizobial
   classification and diversity could have greater practical applications
   in enhancing agricultural productivity in tropical ecosystems. Using the
   results of studies on tropical rhizobia which nodulate agroforestry tree
   legumes, three ecological aspects of rhizobial biodiversity were used to
   illustrate how its potential can be exploited. The results showed that
   legumes nodulate with diverse rhizobial types, thus contributing to the
   success of legumes in colonising a wide range of environments. There was
   an apparent shift in the relative dominance of rhizobia populations by
   different rhizobial types as soil pH changed. The Rhizobium tropici-type
   rhizobia were predominant under acidic conditions, Mesorhizobium spp. at
   intermediate pH and Sinorhizobium spp. under alkaline conditions. The R.
   tropici-type rhizobia were the most effective symbiotic group on all the
   host legumes. However, strains of Sinorhizobium spp. were as effective
   as the R. tropici types in N-2-fixation on Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra
   calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala; while Mesorhizobium strains were
   equally as effective as the R. tropici types on Sesbania sesban.
   Classification of rhizobia based on phenotypic properties showed a broad
   correlation with groupings based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis, although
   a few variant strains nested with the dominant groups in most of the
   clusters. Some of the phenotypic characters that differentiated
   different rhizobial groups are highlighted and a case is made for the
   need to standardise this method.},

Abstract = {The development of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) symbiosis was
   monitored in Leucaena leucocephala grown in an Oxisol subjected to
   incremental simulated erosion. The density of VAM infective propagules
   in the soil diminished as the level of simulated erosion (removal of
   surface soil) was increased from 0 to 50 cm. The level of infection on
   L. leucocephala roots observed at harvest was not significntly
   influenced by simulated erosion unless removal of surface soil exceeded
   25 cm. Inoculation of this soil and the uneroded soil with Glomus
   aggregatum enhanced the early onset of infection but did not
   significantly influence the level of infection observed at the time of
   harvest. Simulated erosion in excess of 7.5 cm of surface soil removal
   significantly delayed the development of VAM effectiveness monitored in
   terms of the P status of L. leucocephala subleaflets and also curtailed
   the level of maximum effectiveness observed. Decreases in VAM
   effectiveness were significantly correlated with decreases in soil
   chemical constituents. However, VAM effectiveness in a soil subjected to
   30 cm of surface soil removal was not restored to a significant extent
   unless the soil was amended with P, even though other nutrients were
   restored to sufficiency levels. Our results demonstrate that the
   development of VAM effectiveness is the phase of the VAM symbiosis that
   is most adversely influenced by simulated erosion and that this effect
   appears to be caused primarily by insufficient P in the soil solution.},

Journal = {CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Transformation of some oxygenated compounds in bio-oil derived from
   biomass pyrolysis via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) generally improves its
   quality and potentially produces bio-based chemicals. Although alumina
   (Al2O3) supported catalysts are normally applied for HDO, they have
   certain limitations, such as acidity and high susceptibility to water,
   which need to be improved. In this research, an Al2O3-incorporated
   zirconia (ZrO2) composite (AZ) was prepared as a support of nickel
   (Ni)-molybdenum (Mo) catalysts used for HDO of guaiacol (GUA) and real
   bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala trunks to
   produce phenols. In the absence of water, the NiMo catalyst supported on
   AZ at 1/1 Al2O3/ZrO2 molar ratio {[}NiMo/AZ(1/1)] having higher
   reducibility with a greater number of weak-medium acid sites provided
   >98\% GUA conversion with 87\% selectivity to phenols. In the presence
   of water, the NiMo/AZ(1/1) catalyst maintained its catalytic activity,
   whereas NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst showed its deactivation to obtain the
   lowering GUA conversion (27.1\% reduction). The FESEM and Al-27-NMR
   analyses revealed that the addition of ZrO2 improved the water tolerance
   of the catalyst by protecting the Al2O3 structure and preventing the
   transformation of Lewis acid-related tetrahedral Al to octahedral Al.
   Moreover, the NiMo/AZ(1/1) catalyst exhibited the highest HDO activity
   for real bio-oil without solvents, achieving a maximum oil yield of 25.2
   wt\% with 75.6\% selectivity to phenols and the lowest coke formation.},

Abstract = {Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) has potential in Florida as a pasture
   legume, but soils are often imperfectly drained making establishment
   difficult. We conducted 2 glasshouse studies to determine responses of 8
   leucaena and 1 Calliandra calothyrsus selection to different soil
   moisture conditions. In the first, freely drained and waterlogged soils
   were compared. In freely drained soil, seedling emergence was greater
   for leucaena (78-93\%) than for calliandra (53\%), but in waterlogged
   soil emergence of all entries was depressed (3-20\%). In the second, 4
   water regimens were compared: maintaining water level at 3 cm above the
   soil surface; at the soil surface; and 15 cm below the soil surface; and
   as freely draining soil. Water level at 15 cm below the soil surface
   gave best seedling growth. Water at or above the surface induced
   aerenchyma on stem bases, which enabled persistence under waterlogging.
   A field study examined the effects of bedding (raised and flat),
   propagule (seed and seedlings) and time of planting {[}July (during) and
   October (after rainy season)] on seedling survival of 5 leucaena
   selections. Leucaena K636 and K340, with > 80\% survival, established
   well in July or October with seed or seedlings, but K749, K784 and LxL,
   with 63-70\% survival, established best in October with seedlings.
   Results demonstrate that bedding may not improve survival of leucaena
   seedlings during high rainfall periods, with propagule, selection and
   time of planting being more important.},

   seed lots, except for Sida acuta under shade, over 50\% of all seedling
   emergence occurred in the first year and, for most seed lots, over 80\%
   of emergence. Most of this emergence occurred in the first 3 months (Oct

   9 months than in the first 3 months of the first year and these included
   5 legumes, 4 native/naturalised grasses and 1 forb.
   Overall, more legume seedlings emerged in the shade than in full
   sunlight whereas more seedlings of native/naturalised grasses emerged in
   full sunlight. No seedling emergence occurred in the fourth and fifth
   years in full sunlight whereas there were still low levels of seedling
   emergence under shade, especially of legumes and Sida acuta. No grass

Abstract = {Fur condition in wild ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, was recorded
   during September-November birth seasons 2001-2006 at Berenty Reserve,
   Madagascar. Body coat condition was scored on a scale from BS 0: full,
   smooth coat with guard hairs, to BS5: half or more of back and limbs
   hairless. Tail condition was scored from TS 0: full, to TS 5: half or
   more hairless. Where troop core areas included stands of Leucaena
   leucocephala, alopecia was dramatically more frequent than in similar
   areas without leucaena, including many animals with score BS5 or TS5,
   ``bald lemur syndrome.{''} Female coats were worse than males,' possibly
   related to female dominance and access to this preferred food. Tails in
   non-leucaena-feeding females tend to remain full, even if coats
   deteriorate, but with leucaena-feeding female tails are highly
   correlated with coat condition and equally bare. Coat and tail condition
   in L. catta reflected not only the dietary toxin but individual
   differences as well as differences between adjacent troops that may
   result from territorially mediated access to the environment. Leucaena
   contains the non-protein amino acid mimosine, a known cause of alopecia,
   wasting, and organ damage in livestock, although the effects are usually
   reversible. This is the first case of its effect in wildlife. Leucaena
   is an agroforestry tree introduced throughout the tropics. In high

   11.0 and 14.2 g/day, and similar between diets. The DM and CP
   digestibilities of the diets were 0.56 and 0.56 (Control), 0.62 and 0.56
   (Mixed), 0.59 and 0.49 (Sweet potato vines), and 0.54 and 0.45
   (Solanum), respectively. Faecal and urinary N excretions were highest in
   goats fed the Sweet potato vines and Solanum diets. Eggplant wastes were
   the least (P < 0.05) preferred. On average the goats spent 5\% of their
   8-hour time eating eggplant wastes, 34\% on sweet potato vines and 36\%
   on elephant grass. Growth performance and N retention were low due to
   the low intake of feed, especially eggplant wastes.},

Title = {Factors affecting production of COS and CS2 in Leucaena and Mimosa
   species},

Abstract = {Carbon disulfide (CS2) and carbonyl sulfide (COS) are colorless,
   foul-smelling, volatile sulfur compounds with biocidal properties. Some
   plants produce CS2 or COS or both. When used as an intercrop or
   forecrop, these plants may have agronomic potential in protecting other
   plants. Most of the factors which affect production of these
   plant-generated organic sulfides are unknown. We determined the effects
   of sulfate concentration, plant age, nitrogen fixation, drought stress,
   root injury (through cutting), and undisturbed growth on COS production
   in Leucaena retusa or Leucaena leucocephala and the effect of some of
   these factors on CS2 production in Mimosa pudica. In addition, we
   determined if organic sulfides were produced in all Leucaena species.
   When L. retusa and M. pudica seedlings were grown in a plant nutrient
   medium with different sulfate concentrations (50 to 450 mg S L(-1)), COS
   or CS2 from crushed roots generally increased with increasing sulfate
   concentration. COS production was highest (less than or equal to 74 ng
   mg(-1) dry root) for young L. retusa seedlings and declined to low
   amounts (<5 ng mg(-1) dry root) for older seedlings. Nitrogen fixation
   reduced the amounts of COS or CS2 produced in L. leucocephala and M.
   pudica. Under conditions of undisturbed growth, root cutting, or drought
   stress, no COS production was detected in 4- to 8-weeks-old L. retusa
   plants. COS or CS2 or both was obtained from crushed roots or shoots of
   all 13 known Leucaena species.},

Abstract = {The roost tree characteristics of Indian flying fox (Pteropus medius)
   were studied in the midland laterite hillocks of northern Kerala in
   peninsular India. A total of 170 trees belonging to 20 families, 32
   genera, and 37 species were identified as roost trees from eleven roost
   sites located in Kannur and Kasargod districts of northern Kerala. Roost
   tree parameters such as habit, origin, diameter at breast height (DBH),
   tree height, bole height, crown length, crown spread, and crown closure
   were analyzed. Families Ana-cardiaceae and Lamiaceae represented more
   number of roost trees in the study area. The mean bat abundance per tree
   for the entire study area was found to be 54.35 +/- 5.2 and it was
   highest for Ficus religiosa (peepal) followed by Tetrameles nudiflora
   (false hemp tree) and Leucaena leucocephala (subabul). Bats showed a
   preference for native trees and did not show any difference in the
   selection of evergreen and deciduous trees for roosting. The study also
   revealed that P. medius prefers large trees with greater height,
   diameter, crown length, and crown spread. As the midland laterite
   hillocks are under severe habitat degradation, the study recommends
   preserving large trees for better conservation of the remaining habitats
   of P. medius in the area. (c) 2022 National Science Museum of Korea

Abstract = {Antibacteria, a subtance inhibiting the growth of bacteria, can be
   obtained from tropical-almond (Terminalia catappa), morinda (Morinda
   citrifolia), and white leadtree (Leucaena leucocephala) plants, since
   the plants have phytochemical content functioning as antibacterial
   agent. Commonly, part of plant that contains higher antibacterial
   substances is its leaf. The objectives of this study were to determine
   antibacterial activity of tropical-almond, morinda, and white leadtree
   leaves extracts, and to analyse the potency of the three extracts as
   natural bactericide for soaking of skin or hide. The responses measured
   in this study were phytochemical contents, total flavonoid, tannin
   content, the inhibition zone, the minimum inhibitory concentration
   (MIC), and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Phytochemical
   contents containing the three leaves extracts were alkaloid, flavonoid,
   tannin, saponin, phenolic, and glycoside. Total flavonoid and tannin
   contents of the three extracts were tropical-almond extract of 1.14 \%
   and 1.51 \%, respectively; morinda extract of 0.61 \% and 0.36 \%,
   respectively; and white leadtree extract of 0.60 \% and 4.82 \%,
   respectively. White leadtree leaf extract gave the highest inhibition
   zone against B. subtilis, S. aureus and E. coli, i.e. 1.50, 1.3, and
   1.65 cm, respectively; and the lowest MIC and MBC against B. subtilis,
   S. aureus and E. coli, i.e. 1500, 3000, and 1500 mu g/ml, respectively.
   Therefore, the white leadtree leave extract had more potential as
   bactericide for soaking of skin or hide compared to those of the
   tropical-almond and morinda leaves extracts.},

Abstract = {Tree and shrub forage production were evaluated during the dry season in
   three soil within a silvopastoral system (SPS) complementary to
   traditional, local cattle systems in Yucatan, Mexico. Soils were
   Epileptic cambisol (CMlep, 24\%), Endoskelectic cambisol (CMnsk, 21.3\%)
   and Rodic luvisol (LVro, 28.4\%). Three, 100 m(2) quadrants were set in
   each soil and vegetation with > 1.0 cm maximun tree diameter at breast
   height inventoried in each quadrant. Experimental design was a
   stratified block arrangement with each soil being a block. Nine forage
   species were identified within the SPS. Bauhinia divaricata was the most
   abundant overall with 1,148 individuals and had the largest population
   (577 individuals) in the LVro. Piscidia piscipula, (n= 495) had the
   largest basal area (1.8 m(2)) of the forage species. After
   standardization cut, only three species produced new shoots: Leucaena
   leucocephala, P. piscipula and B. divaricada. Considering these three
   species, the highest forage yield was observed in the CMlep. In this
   soil, L. leucocephala produced higher amounts of DM per plant than B.
   divaricata and P. piscipula. L. leucocephala and P. piscipula had better
   overall yield in the CMlep. B. divaricata did not perform differently in
   the three studied soils but had greater yield, better cut response and a
   higher number of plants than L. leucocephala and P. piscipula. These
   three species are potentially useful as forage producers during the dry
   season and their yields could be improved by considering regional
   pedodiversity.},

   was the application method of foliar and basal sprays. The subplot was
   the concentration of liquid boron organic fertilizer (4.10\%B) was
   applied at 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150 mL L-1. The results showed no
   interactions between the method and the concentration of liquid organic
   boron fertilizer (LOBF) on growth and yield of tomato plants. However,
   the concentration of liquid organic fertilizer significantly affected
   tomato growth and the yield. An application rate of 25 mL L-1 of liquid
   organic boron fertilizer increased the number of flower clusters by
   22\%. It also increased fruit yield plant(-1) by 18\% and increased the
   number of tomato fruit plant(-1) by 14\% compared to the control
   treatment (no liquid organic boron fertilizer). Results showed that

Abstract = {Melissopalynology was used to determine the botanical origin of honey,
   which is important for its traceability. Forty samples of honey from the
   counties of Santa Helena (20) and Terra Roxa (20), the western region of
   Parana, Southern Brazil, were analyzed according to the pollen types and
   comparisons with pollen catalogs and specialized literature. Regarding
   analytics quality, 300 grains of pollen per sample were identified. In
   the samples from Santa Helena, 71 pollen types of 24 families were
   found, classified as Hovenia dulcis monofloral honey (8) and the
   remainder as polyfloral (12). In the samples from Terra Roxa, 64 pollen
   types belonging to 29 families were classified as monofloral Glycine max
   (7), Mimosa scabrella Benth (2), Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth (1),
   Mimosa verrucosa Benth (1), Mikania (1), and Senecio (1) and as
   polyfloral (7). The two locations have a high similarity index; however,
   the predominance of some pollen types indicates the botanical
   specificity of the locality. For Santa Helena, a greater significance
   was observed for H. dulcis pollen, Eucalyptus, Parapiptadenia rigida,
   and Leucaena leucocephala; in Terra Roxa, the pollen types G. max, M.
   scabrella, and Eucalyptus had more incidents. Despite the similarity
   index, the indicators show differences between the producing areas. The
   samples of honey from Santa Helena presented higher pollen diversity in
   relation to the samples of Terra Roxa, reflecting the predominant
   vegetative cover of riparian forests and agricultural crops,
   respectively, in each county.},

   state, Venezuela. 27 associated variables to the morpho structural
   behavior, the biomass availability and the chemical composition were
   evaluated. In the ACP corresponding to the morph structure and the
   availability variables three components were formed, with 80.435\% of
   the total variability extracted. The BT, BC and leaves availability, the
   number of branches, the survival and the symptoms of illnesses; all
   positively related to each other, explained the variance better. In the
   ACP associated with the chemical composition, five components were
   formed and 86.763\% of the experimental variance was extracted. The
   contents of crude protein, true protein, bound protein to the fibrous
   fraction and the fibrous fraction (FDN), all related positively to each
   other, excepting the FDN, explained the numeric fluctuations better. To
   evaluate the behavior of the mulberry as grazing plant in a
   silvopastoral context could be measured the number of branches, the
   availability of biomass, the survival and the appearance of illnesses.
   From the chemical point of view should only be considered some variables
   associated with the protein profile or the FDN. However, the majority
   secondary metabolites did not exhibit relevance, excepting to the
   saponins content, to characterize the species under silvopastoral

Abstract = {The objectives of this investigation were to isolate the rpoH2 gene
   encoding an alternative sigma factor from Sinorhizobium sp. BL3 and to
   determine its role in exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis, salt tolerance
   and symbiosis with Phaseolus lathyroides. The rpoH2 gene of Rhizobium
   sp. strain TALI 145 is known to be required for EPS synthesis and
   effective nodulation of Leucaena leucocephala. Three overlapping cosmid
   clones containing the rpoH2 gene of BL3 were isolated by complementing
   an rpoH2 mutant of TALI 145 for EPS production. From one of these
   cosmids, rpoH2 of BL3 was identified within a 3.0-kb fragment by
   subcloning and sequencing. The cloned rpoH2 gene of BL3 restored both
   EPS production and nodulation defects of the TALI 145 rpoH2 mutants.
   Three rpoH2 mutants of BL3 were constructed by transposon-insertion
   mutagenesis. These mutants of BL3 grew normally in complete or minimal
   medium and were not defective in EPS synthesis, nodulation and nitrogen
   fixation, but they failed to grow in salt stress conditions. The mutants
   complemented with cloned rpoH2 from either BL3 or TALI 145 showed higher
   levels of salt tolerance than BL3. The expression of rpoH2 in BL3
   started increasing during the exponential phase and reached the highest
   level in the mid-stationary phase. These results indicate that RpoH2 is
   required for salt tolerance in Sinorhizobium sp. BL3, and it may have
   additional roles during the stationary phase. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson

   Shinyanga, seven years old woodlots of Acacia polyacantha Willd. and

   wood, respectively. Intercropping of maize between trees was possible
   for two years without sacrificing its yield. The first maize crop
   following A. crassicarpa woodlots gave 29 to 113\% greater yield than
   the crop after natural fallow. Acacia polyacantha and L. leucocephala
   woodlots also increased the subsequent maize yields over a three-year
   period. The increase in crop yields after woodlots was attributed partly
   to accumulation of greater amounts of inorganic N in the topsoil
   compared to the traditional fallow, and partly to other effects. Thus
   medium-term rotational woodlots are likely to contribute to meet the
   wood requirements of rural people and thereby help protect the natural
   woodlands in sub-Saharan Africa.},

Abstract = {There is considerable interest from Western Australian (WA) pastoralists
   on the potential role of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) in northern
   WA, where the potential area for dryland production of species of the
   genus Leucaena is high. Although it is highly regarded for animal
   production in other countries and in Queensland, leucaena is a
   contentious species since its status as an environmental weed currently
   precludes it from use on pastoral leases in the Kimberley and Pilbara
   regions of WA. Development of sterile/seedless forms would overcome
   risks of spread of the species as a weed. The key environmental
   constraints to growth of leucaena are likely to be the length of the dry
   season and low fertility of most soils other than the grey/black
   cracking clays (vertosols). Psyllid resistance and cool temperature
   tolerance are likely to be of secondary importance. Opportunities for
   irrigated production are also emerging and may allow leucaena species to
   be used in environments previously considered well outside their
   home-range. It is desirable now to re-examine the diversity of the wider
   leucaena genus for adaptation to WA conditions generally and for the
   purpose of selecting elite parent material for use in a sterile/seedless
   leucaena breeding program. These perennial species that can be under
   production for 30 to 40 years need to be evaluated in the target
   environments for at least 3-5 years to fully understand their potential
   as adult plants.},

Abstract = {Cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) is the second gene of phenylpropanoid
   pathway responsible for the production of a variety of compounds
   including lignin. Transgenic tobacco plants were raised using antisense
   construct harbouring partial C4H gene from Leucaena leucocephala. C4H
   down-regulation in transgenic tobacco had profound effect on the
   transcript level of C4H and other lignin biosynthesis pathway genes
   investigated. Transgenics had reduced C4H transcript level, as low as
   about 5\% of the level in control plants in one of the transgenics. It
   was interesting to see higher reduction in the transcript level of
   phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), the enzyme preceding C4H in the
   pathway, than C4H itself. Reduction in the transcript level of
   4-Coumarate: CoA Ligase (4CL), the enzyme that follows C4H in the
   pathway, was comparable to that of C4H. Transcript levels of two other
   phenylpropanoid pathway genes, Caffeoyl coenzyme A 3-O-methyltransferase
   (CCoAOMT) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) were also found
   reduced compared to control. In the transgenic line AS9, a small
   reduction of about 11\% in the transcript level of C4H resulted in about
   88\% reduction in the transcript level of PAL and 19-29\% reduction in
   the transcript level of 4CL, CCoAOMT and CAD. In our knowledge, this is
   the first quantitative report of concomitant decrease in the transcript
   level of five phenylpropanoid pathway genes as a result of
   down-regulation of one of the pathway genes.},

Abstract = {The trees and shrubs of different Leucaena spp. contain a non-protein
   amino acid, mimosine which is toxic to animals and microorganisms. We
   found small amounts of mimosine in the nodules and the root exudate of
   Leucaena leucocephala. Some Leucaena-nodulating strains of Rhizobium
   degrade mimosine (Mid(+)) and use it as a source of nutrients. To
   determine if the ability to catabolize mimosine by Rhizobium has a role
   in symbiosis, we constructed mutants that cannot degrade mimosine
   (Mid(-)) from a Mid(+) competitive strain and tested them for growth in
   the presence of mimosine. When mimosine was added to a complete medium,
   it stimulated the growth of the Mid(+) wild-type strain but inhibited
   the growth of a mutant in which the gene encoding a mimosine-degrading
   enzyme was disrupted. L. leucocephala and Phaseolus vulgaris plants
   inoculated with these mutants formed effective nodules showing that
   mimosine catabolism by the microsymbiont has no direct effect on
   symbiosis. When mixtures of the wild-type strain and the Mid(-) mutants
   were used to inoculate L. leucocephala and P. vulgaris seedlings, most
   nodules in L. leucocephala were occupied by the wild-type strain,
   whereas, the nodule occupancies in P. vulgaris were proportional to the
   inoculant mixtures. These results show that the Mid(-) mutants are
   defective in nodulation competition on Leucaena but not on brans. This
   indicates that mimosine present in Leucaena provides a nodulation
   competition advantage to the mimosine degrading Rhizobium strains. (C)

Abstract = {Tetrastigma harmandii Planch. is utilized for culinary and medicinal
   purposes in the Philippines. However, its growing conditions,
   nutritional composition and asexual propagation are less known. Hence,
   this study characterized the growing environment of T. harmandii in
   northeastern Cagayan, Philippines and determined its proximate and
   nutrient compositions through proximate and elemental analyses,
   respectively. Asexual propagation was also done wherein T. harmandii
   stem cuttings (one, two and three nodes) with and without auxin
   (alpha-NAA) were propagated for 33 days inside the rooting bins. Results
   revealed that the species grows in various habitats such as hills,
   coastal areas, residential and agricultural land, grasslands, bodies of
   water, caves and secondary growth forests in 18-181 masl elevations. It
   was also found to thrive in moderately acidic soils with medium organic
   matter and high nutrient contents. The species grows mostly together
   with Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium. Moreover, the leaves
   of the plant have high crude fiber (5.20\%), potassium (3.28\%) and iron
   (207 ppm). The propagation of the plant using three-node stem cuttings
   without auxin application showed better survival (97.78\%) and rooting
   (86.67\%). Compared with one-node stem cutting, improved rooting was
   observed in the two-node (1.68 more roots and 0.30 denser roots) and
   three-node (2.92 more roots and 0.14 denser roots) stem cuttings. Hence,
   T. harmandii is easy to root when propagated asexually; better rooting
   can be achieved through three-node stem cuttings without auxin
   application.},

Abstract = {Aluminum (Al) resistance in some leguminous plants is achieved by
   enhanced citrate release from roots. Enhancement requires several hours
   for complete activation and is postulated to involve Al-responsive genes
   or components. We examined the mechanism of Al-induced citrate release
   by studying the relationship between citrate release and expression of
   the mitochondrial citrate synthase (mCS) gene in three leguminous trees.
   Root elongation in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit was arrested
   within 24 h by 30 mu M Al, whereas root elongation in Paraserianthes
   falcataria (L.) Neilson and Acacia mangium Willd. was inhibited < 50\%
   by a 48-h treatment with 100 mu M AI in calcium chloride solution. Roots
   of P. falcataria and A. mangium maintained enhanced release and
   accumulation of citrate for at least 28 days in response to Al
   treatment. Aluminum increased the accumulation of mCS transcripts in P.
   falcataria roots, but not in L. leucocephala roots, and thus
   up-regulation decreased following removal of Al. Lanthanum did not alter
   the expression level of mCS. Aluminum increased mCS activity
   concomitantly with enhanced mCS gene expression in P. falcataria,
   whereas it did not affect mCS activity in L. leucocephala. Aluminum
   content in root apices of P. falcataria was increased by cycloheximide,
   supporting the idea that de novo synthesis of proteins is a prerequisite
   for Al resistance. Our findings suggest that Al-inducible expression of
   mCS coupled with enhanced citrate release mediates Al resistance in P.

Abstract = {In Sudan, tree plantations remain the first choice and are widely used
   in protecting arable lands from sand movement. Decomposition and
   nutrient changes from leaves of some agroforestry trees (Eucalyptus
   microtheca, Ficus spp., and Leucaena leucocephala) and litter fall from
   guava (Psidium guajava) and mango (Magnifera indica) were monitored (in
   a 12-week litter-bag experiment). Rate of dry-matter weight loss from
   guava (0.098 wk(-1)) was significantly (P < 0.01) faster than from mango
   residues (0.04 wk(-1)). Corresponding values for Leucaena, Eucalyptus,
   and Ficus were 0.0533, 0.0524, and 0.0438 wk(-1), respectively. In
   general, micronutrients tend to accummulate during a decomposition
   period. Potassium (K) was the only element found to be consistently lost
   by leaching very rapidly from all litters. Nitrogen (N) was released at
   a significantly (P < 0.03) higher rate from Leucaena (0.0558 wk(-1))
   compared to Ficus (0.0399 wk(-1)) and Eucalyptus (0.0301 wk(-1)).
   Mobility of nutrients from the litters was in the order of K phosphorus
   (P) = N calcium (Ca) magnesium (Mg). It is concluded that ficus and
   mango leaves are suitable for improving quality of arid soils through
   buildup of soil organic matter and supplying easily released organic
   sulfur (S) (environmentally sound management practice) whereas litter
   from guava is suitable for temporary nutrient correction. Mixing of
   guava and mango residues may slow fast decomposition of the former.},

Abstract = {Allelopathic effects of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. were confirmed
   in Petri dish and pot experiments in our previous studies. However, the
   degree to which such effects under controlled experiments exist in more
   complex ecological settings remains to be tested. Thus, the present
   study was carried out by incorporating different proportions of ground
   litter of E. camaldulensis in soil. The growth of three agricultural
   crops: falen (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum
   L.), and arhor (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.), and two tree species, kala
   koroi (Albizia procera (Roxb.) Benth.) and ipil ipil (Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) were tested. There were inhibitory effects
   of leaf litter on germination, shoot and root growth, leaf number, and
   collar diameter as well as a reduction of nodulation by legume crops
   (25-80\% reduction). The extent of the effects was dependent on the
   proportion of leaf litter, the species and the type of traits. In
   contrast to shoot growth, the effect on root growth was more severe. No
   effect on germination was found with the agriculture crops while the two
   tree species showed reduced germination. The effect was greater in the
   presence of higher proportions of leaf litter mixed in soil while in
   some cases lower proportions stimulated growth. Not all species were
   suppressed; A. procera, C. cajan, V. unguiculata showed compatible
   growth while C. arietinum and L. leucocephala were found incompatible.
   This study provides evidence that E. camaldulensis has allelopathic
   potential under field conditions and a careful selection of associated
   crops in agroforestry systems is highly recommended.},

Abstract = {Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to

   sequence analysis of 4 chromosomal DNA regions. Five of the groups were
   placed within Rhizobium lusitanum, and the other group was placed within
   R. tropici type IIA. Therefore, the collection of Portuguese bean
   isolates was shown to include the two species R. lusitanum and R.
   tropici. In plant tests, the strains P1-7, P1-1, P1-2, and P1-16 of R.
   lusitanum nodulated and formed nitrogen-fixing symbioses both with
   Phaseolus vulgaris and Leucaena leucocephala. A
   methyltransferase-encoding nodS gene identical with the R. tropici locus

   24 others identified as R. lusitanum. A methyltransferase-encoding nodS

   this case the locus was that identified with the narrow-host-range R.
   etli. Representatives of isolates with the nodS of R. etli formed
   effective nitrogen-fixing symbioses with P. vulgaris and did not
   nodulate L. leucocephala. From sequence data of nodS, the R. lusitanum
   genes for symbiosis were placed within those of either R. tropici or R.
   etli. These results would support the suggestion that R. lusitanum was
   the recipient of the genes for symbiosis with beans from both R. tropici

   maize yield and grain N uptake by 157 and 163\%, respectively, compared
   to when prunings were removed. Addition of inorganic fertilizer further
   increased maize yield and N recovery. Pruning three times per season

   reduced leucaena biomass and N yield. Pruning twice per season, with the
   second pruning at 40 rather than at 30 DAP, increased biomass N yield

Journal = {PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {214},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) is a leguminous tree widely cultivated
   in tropical and subtropical regions due to its strong environmental
   suitability for abiotic stresses, especially drought. However, the
   molecular mechanisms and key pathways involved in Leucaena ` s drought
   response require further elucidation. Here, we comparatively analyzed
   the physiological and early transcriptional responses of Leucaena leaves
   and roots under drought stress simulated by polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   treatments. Drought stress induced physiological changes in Leucaena
   seedlings, including decreases in relative water content (RWC) and
   increases in relative electrolyte leakage (REL), malondialdehyde (MDA),
   proline contents as well as antioxidant enzyme activities. In response
   to drought stress, 6461 and 8295 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
   were identified in the leaves and roots, respectively. In both tissues,
   the signaling transduction pathway of plant hormones was notably the
   most enriched. Specifically, abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and
   signaling related genes ( NCED , PP2C , SnRK2 and ABF ) were strongly
   upregulated particularly in leaves. The circadian rhythm, DNA
   replication, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and secondary metabolites
   biosynthesis related pathways were repressed in leaves, while the
   glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and amino
   acid biosynthesis processes were promoted in roots. Furthermore,
   heterologous overexpression of Leucaena drought-inducible genes ( PYL5 ,
   PP2CA , bHLH130 , HSP70 and AUX22D ) individually in yeast increased the
   tolerance to drought and heat stresses. Overall, these results deepen
   our understanding of the tissue-specific mechanisms of Leucaena in
   response to drought and provide target genes for future
   drought-tolerance breeding engineering in crops.},

Title = {Soil amelioration through afforestation and self-repair in a degraded
   valley-type savanna},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {320},
Pages = {13-20},

Abstract = {Land degradation and soil deterioration are key environmental problems
   in the savanna of southwestern China. Restoration programs require
   scientific information about tree species that represent the best
   options for rehabilitating degraded lands and about the responses of key
   edaphic constraints to these tree species. Five plantations (Leucaena
   leucocephala, Albizia kalkora, Acacia auriculiformis, Azadirachta indica
   and Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and one self-repair treatment were
   established to restore a degraded savanna, and soil properties
   associated with these treatments were investigated four times during 22
   years of vegetation restoration.
   The results showed that treatment and sampling time have significant
   effects on the soil properties of the degraded savanna following
   vegetation restoration. Soil physical properties improved slowly
   relative to its microbial and chemical properties. After 22 years of
   vegetation restoration, soil amelioration via self-repair mechanisms was
   more successful than via the planting of A. kalkora, A. indica and E.
   camaldulensis but was inferior to or close to the planting of L.
   leucocephala and A. auriculiformis.
   The tree species control the soil amelioration process in the degraded
   savanna. The manual restoration of vegetation (i.e., afforestation)
   could not always accelerate soil amelioration relative to natural
   restoration (i.e., self-repair) in the savanna. L. leucocephala and A.
   auriculiformis are recommended as pioneer trees for soil amelioration of
   the degraded savanna. The cost-free self-repair of the degraded savanna
   is also a recommended approach to soil amelioration. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {Tree plantations are increasingly common in tropical landscapes due to
   their multiple uses. Plantations vary in structure and composition, and
   these variations may alter soil fauna communities. Recent studies have
   demonstrated the important role of soil fauna in the regulation of plant
   litter decomposition in the tropics. However, little is known about how
   plantation species affect soil fauna populations, which may in turn
   affect the biogeochemistry of the plantation system. We measured soil
   macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass in 9-year-old N-2-fixing
   Leucaena leucocephala, Casuarina equisetifolia, and non N-2-fixing
   Eucalyptus robusta plantations on a degraded site in Puerto Rico.
   Nutrient concentrations and standing stocks of forest floor litter were
   also determined to examine the relationship between litter chemistry and
   soil macroinvertebrates. Leucaena plantations had significantly higher
   abundances and biomass of millipede species than Casuarina and
   Eucalyptus. Earthworm biomass did not differ among plantation
   treatments. Nitrogen, P, and K concentrations were generally higher in
   Leucaena litter, which resulted in higher standing stocks of these
   nutrients in fragmented, moderately decomposed litter (Oe horizon).
   Millipede biomass was highly correlated to N concentration and C/N ratio
   in the Oi litter horizon. These results suggest that plantation species
   differ in their influence on soil fauna, and the biomass and abundance
   of soil fauna can be regulated through careful selection of plantation
   species in degraded tropical lands. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {We have cloned and sequenced the pckA gene of Rhizobium sp. NGR234, a
   broad host-range strain. The gene encodes phosphoenolpyruvate
   carboxykinase (PEPCK), a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis. The locus was
   isolated and subcloned from a genomic library of NGR234 employing
   hybridization with an R. meliloti pck gene probe and complementation of
   a Tn5 mutant in this species. The DNA sequence of pckA (NGR234) was
   determined and encoded a PEPCK protein of 535 amino acids with a
   molecular weight of 58.4 kDa. The deduced polypeptide sequence was
   compared to those of three known ATP-dependent PEPCKs. Slightly higher
   homology was observed with yeast and trypanosome polypeptides than with
   that of Escherichia coli. We have identified several regions that are
   conserved in all four PEPCK proteins. A mutant constructed in the pck
   gene by site-directed mutagenesis with interposon-OMEGA failed to grow
   on succinate, malate and arabinose but grew on glucose and glycerol as
   sole carbon sources. These data show that NGR234 requires PEPCK-driven
   gluconeogenesis to grow on TCA cycle intermediates. A host-dependent
   effect of the pckA mutation was observed on nodule development and
   nitrogen fixation. Nodules formed by the site-directed mutant on
   Leucaena leucocephala and Macroptilium atropurpureum were Fix(Red), but
   on Vigna unguiculata were Fix-. The expression of the gene was
   positively regulated in free-living cells of NGR234 by either succinate
   or host-plant exudates, and was subject to catabolite repression by
   glucose.},

Abstract = {Cattle and goats in Australia lack the ability to totally degrade
   3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone, also known as 3,4-dihydroxy pyridine (3,4
   DHP), the ruminal metabolite of mimosine, a toxic amino acid present in
   the leguminous shrub Leucaena leucocephala. Ruminants in Hawaii have
   this capacity due to the presence of micro-organisms able to rapidly
   degrade the DHP. A mixed bacterial population capable of rapidly
   degrading DHP in vitro was isolated from a goat on the island of Maui.
   Cultures were grown anaerobically, without added sugars, in Medium 98-5
   containing DHP. Cultures at a dilution of 1012 from the original rumen
   fluid were introduced into Townsville and further sub-cultured and
   multiplied in vitro in strict isolation at the Oonoonba Veterinary
   Laboratory, Townsville. Infusion of the culture into a goat and a steer
   fed a 100\% leucaena diet resulted in cessation of DHP excretion in the
   urine. After 60 days the serum thyroxine levels and thyroid size were
   normal and there were no clinical signs of disease. The ability of the
   rumen fluid to degrade DHP in vitro showed that the bacteria had become
   established in the rumen. In the absence of any disease in the animals,
   clearance has been given for the wider use of these cultures in areas
   where leucaena is grown. The limited evidence suggests that the leucaena
   toxicity problem can be solved by the use of these introduced bacteria.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of incorporating different protein
   sources (oil seed cakes versus Leucaena leucocephala hay) in a total
   mixed ration (TMR) on intake, digestibility, growth and carcass meat
   quality of Saanen goats. Sixteen Saanen male goats were allocated to TMR
   diets formulated with or without L. leucocephala hay at 25\% of total
   dry matter (DM). The TMRs were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous,
   isocaloric and iso-neutral detergent fibre using two sources of crude
   protein from Leucaena hay or oilseed cake meal (OSCM), which is a blend
   of soybean, sunflower and cottonseed cake meal. Data were collected on
   nutrient digestibility and carcass quality parameters. The goats fed TMR
   with Leucaena had greater (P <0.05) dry matter intake compared with
   those fed the control diet. In contrast, the digestibility of DM,
   organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent
   fibre and feed conversion ratio did not differ (P >0.05) between the two
   dietary treatments. Between treatments, no differences were detected for
   slaughter bodyweight, empty bodyweight carcass weight, and dressing
   percentage. Nor were differences detected (P >0.05) for cooking loss
   percentage, back fat cover, and area of eye muscle (longissimus dorsi)
   and Warner-Bratzler shear force between goats fed the two TMR diets.
   Replacing a portion of oilseed cake meal at 15\% DM with Leucaena hay at
   25\% DM in TMR for Saanen goats would help rural farmers to reduce the

Abstract = {Pastures are the fodder supply of Brazilian livestock, and are
   exhaustively degraded by nitrogen (N) deficiency. Intercropping with
   legumes, aside from nitrogen fixation, may have secondary effects on
   soil fertility, such as acidification or nutrient movement from deeper
   to the surface soil layers. This study evaluated the soil litter stock
   and fertility of degraded Brachiaria decumbens pastures after planting
   leguminous shrubs and forage trees. For this purpose, we sampled (March
   2010) degraded Brachiaria decumbens pasture planted in July 2008 in an
   intercropping experiment with sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia), leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala), mororo (Bauhinia cheilantha) and gliricidia
   (Gliricidia sepium), as well as N-fertilized and unfertilized
   brachiaria. Soil and litter was sampled (layers 0-10, 10-20 and 20-40
   cm) in three transects, at alternating points covered by grasses and by
   legumes, totaling seven composite samples per plot to determine soil pH,
   P, K, Ca, Mg, and Al and calculate sum of bases, effective cation
   exchange capacity and aluminum saturation. Litter was visually separated
   in legumes, grasses and unidentified material to quantify dry matter,
   organic matter, N, P, C, acid-detergent fiber, and lignin. The use of
   legumes increased the levels of total N in litter and reduced the C:N
   ratios, especially of gliricidia and sabia, although the lignin levels
   in the latter were high. There was a significant effect of legume soil
   cover, with no differences between them, on pH and K (layer 0-10 cm) and
   on pH, K and Al (layer 10-20 cm).},

Abstract = {The selection and use of appropriate plant materials to maintain a
   sufficiently high nutrient supply to meet crop needs remains a major
   challenge of nutrient management under low input systems. Therefore,
   research on plant biomass quality as it relates to decomposition and
   nutrient release has become imperative. This research was conducted at
   the Agroforestry Research Station of the Kwame Nkrumah University of
   Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana to determine the decomposition and
   nutrient release patterns of Tithonia diversifolia, a rarely used
   non-traditional species but of research interest in soil fertility
   improvement practices in Ghana. The decomposition and nutrient release
   patterns of T. diversifolia was compared with Senna spectabilis,
   Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia auriculiformis which
   are commonly used in biomass transfer systems. Results of the study
   confirmed significantly high N, P, K concentrations in T. diversifolia
   comparable to levels recorded for the four leguminous species. In
   addition, T. diversifolia recorded the highest percent decomposition and
   nutrient release rates which differed significantly (P < 0.05) from
   rates of the four leguminous species. It was apparent from the study
   that decomposition and nutrient release rates of species are related to
   quality of leaf material. Phosphorus and Mg concentration in particular
   were most influential in decomposition and nutrient release based on
   significant results. For this reason, it would be imperative to consider
   the concentrations of P and Mg among other factors in selecting high
   quality plant materials for green manuring.},

   semipermanent (II) II ) and temporary (III). III ). In each condition,
   14 rectangular sites of 1 000 m2 2 were established. All species were
   identified. The crown diameter of each individual was measured. The
   Importance Value Index (IVI) IVI ) was determined for each condition.
   Species richness and diversity was calculated with the Margalef (DMg) D
   Mg ) and Shannon- Wiener (H') H' ) indices. In addition, the similarity
   between conditions was determined using the Sorensen index (Is). Is ).
   32 species, 29 genus and 16 families were identified. Condition I
   recorded greater specific richness and greater diversity with 28 species
   and a diversity value H' = 2.41 +/- 0.710, where Salix nigra presented
   the highest IVI. . Condition II presented the highest Margalef richness

   leucocephala turned out to be the most important species. The similarity
   between conditions was greater than 50\%. The results demonstrate the
   structural variation of the vegetation in different hydrological

Abstract = {The objective of the present study was to evaluate the physiological
   adaptability of pregnant doe Kacang goats in a dryland area of
   Indonesia. Thirty pregnant doe Kacang goats aged 2-3 years were
   observed. The rearing system was semi-intensive without giving
   concentrated feeds. Local grasses and legumes such as Leucaena
   leucocephala leaves, Gliricidia sepium leaves, Sesbania grandiflora
   leaves, and drinking water were offered ad libitum. Experimental data
   such as respiration rate, rectal temperature, adaptability coefficient,
   heart rate, and heat tolerance coefficient, were collected during 2-3
   months of gestation. The mean and standard deviation were calculated
   using a descriptive analysis method. The average humidity in the morning
   and afternoon and the ambient temperature in the middle of the day were
   outside the normal range. The THI value indicates that the experimental
   animals are under medium heat stress. The average values of HTC, AC, RT,
   HR, and RR were still typical for goats. In conclusion, although the
   average ambient temperature at midday and humidity in the morning and
   afternoon were outside of the normal range, they did not cause any
   effects on feed and water intake, health, and fetus growth and
   development of pregnant doe Kacang goats. This happened because the
   Kacang goat is a local breed that can adapt well to extreme
   environments. Therefore, pregnant doe Kacang goats in Malaka District
   can be allowed to graze in the paddock throughout the day and housed at
   night.},

   increase of organic matter content and root growth. Root growth and
   proliferation of calliandra in A horizon were predominantly higher than
   that of leucaena, acacia and gliricidia species. In contrast, gliricidia
   roots penetrated into B horizon more densely than roots of other
   species. Better root growth of coconut in A horizon was observed in
   acacia and calliandra plots than other plots. The total coconut root
   biomass in AB and B horizons was higher in gliricidia and acacia plots
   than other species, which accounted for 91\% and 0.3\% in AB horizon and
   21\% and 23\% in B horizon for gliricidia and acacia, respectively
   compared to the control. Total root biomass of coconut in calliandra
   plots was reduced by 5\%, and 45\% in AB and B horizons respectively.
   Results indicated that soil physical conditions of Andigama series

   control) and distilled water (negative control). Data were analyzed
   using an ANOVA and treatments with a concentration -dependent effect
   were subjected to a regression analysis to determine lethal
   concentrations (LC50 and LC90). In addition, a phytochemical analysis
   was performed on the extracts to identify the presence of the main
   secondary metabolites. The best ovicidal and larvicidal activity was
   observed in HAE-Gu with 96.78 \% EHI at 6.25 mg/mL and 57.2 \% larval
   mortality at 75 mg/mL. Followed by HAE-Ba showing 90 \% EHI at 6.25
   mg/mL and 58.0 \% larval mortality at 75 mg/mL. The LC50 and LC90 of
   HAE-Gu on EHI were 2.7 and 4.4 mg/mL, respectively. While the LCs of
   this same extract on larvae were LC50= 64 and LC90= 125 mg/mL. The
   phytochemical analysis indicates that all extracts contain tannins,
   coumarins, flavonoids and terpenes. The fodder species G. ulmifolia and
   E. americana could be candidate plants for the control of H. contortus.},

Abstract = {Silvopastoral systems have been promoted as part of a strategy to
   improve livestock productivity and ecosystem services in the Cesar River
   Valley, Colombia. Between 2014 and 2017, patterns of diversity,
   structure, and composition of the vegetation (> 2.5 cm DBH) were studied
   in 35 plots of 1000 m 2 located in silvopastoral systems, conventional
   pastures, and forests in cattle farms of the region. A total of 1852
   individuals were registered, distributed in 281 morphospecies, 109
   genera, and 44 families. The most abundant families were Fabaceae
   (35\%), Bignoniaceae (7.5\%), and Myrtaceae (6.7\%). Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit , Eucalyptus cf. tereticornis Sm. , and
   Roseodendron chryseum (S.F. Blake) Miranda were the most abundant
   species. Forest fragments and riparian forests presented the highest
   values for plant density, canopy cover, leaf index, the total volume of
   vegetation, and species richness, followed by paddocks with scattered
   trees and mixed fodder banks. The largest trees were found in the
   relicts of forests and paddocks with scattered trees ( Peltogyne
   purpurea Pitter. , Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Jacq.) Griseb. , Anacardium
   excelsum (Bertero \& Balb.) Skeels. , Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn. , and
   Albizia saman (Jacq.) Merr.). Silvopastoral arrangements contribute to
   landscape connectivity and complement the role of forest fragments to
   conserve 14.2 \% of the tree species in the Cesar River Valley. However,
   restoring this landscape requires conserving and connecting existing
   forest fragments, scaling up livestock systems with trees and shrubs,
   and integrating a greater diversity of native species across all land
   uses.},

Abstract = {The objectives of the current study were, firstly to determine the
   molecular weight of condensed tannins (CTs) of 62-2-8 Leucaena-hybrid
   Bahru (LLB) and relating it to its protein binding ability, using the
   local Leucaena leucocephala (LLL) as control and; secondly to evaluate
   the effect of different levels of CTs of the hybrid LLB on rumen
   fermentation parameters, including dry matter and nitrogen digestibility
   and methane gas production. The weight-average molecular weights (M,) of
   purified CTs extracted from hybrid LLB and local LLL, determined using
   gel permeation chromatography were near similar, being 2737 and 2872 Da,
   respectively. However, the CTs of the hybrid LLB exhibited stronger
   protein binding ability than the local LLL (0.305 and 0.420 mg,
   respectively, for LLB and LLL to bind half maximum bovine serum
   albumin). The above results seems to suggest that molecular mass of CTs,
   at least for Leucaena forages, is not the sole factor in determining
   their capability to bind protein. Inclusion of about 20-40 mg of CT/g DM
   of the CTs from hybrid LLB effectively decreased (P<0.05) methane
   production and in vitro nitrogen digestibility. The above results
   suggested a potential of using Cfs from the hybrid LLB to protect
   dietary protein from rumen degradation for better utilization in the
   small intestine of ruminant animals, and in addition to mitigate their
   enteric methane emission, often implicated as a source of greenhouse
   gases. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In Jamaica large quantities of wood are harvested annually for the
   production of charcoal. In the process, many of the island's native
   forests have been over-harvested. In an effort to diminish harvesting
   pressures on local forests, we propose a framework to assist with
   identifying potential planting sites for five exotic fuelwood species
   (i.e., Acacia auriculiformis, Casuarina equisetifolia, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Prosopis juliflora, and Senna siamea) intended for the
   commercial production of biomass energy in Jamaica. Suitable planting
   sites are identified according to (i) the species' biophysical
   requirements, (ii) natural life-zone delimitations based, in part, on
   Digital Elevation Model (DEM)-based calculations of annual
   biotemperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration, and
   (iii) soil pH. The paper also provides a detailed scientific analysis of
   fuelwood growth and yield characteristics, as well as fuelwood-burning
   and charcoal-yielding characteristics for plants grown in a model
   fuelwood project on the southwest coast of Jamaica. Mass production of
   charcoal is considered feasible with two of the five fuelwood species
   considered, namely A. auriculiformis and L. leucocephala. Both species
   have high charcoal yields (> 20 Mg ha(-1)), comparatively good
   charcoal-to-dry weight conversion ratios (> 20\%), high heating value (>
   14.4 MJ kg(-1)), and an abundance of suitable planting sites across the
   island. S. siamea had a greater number of planting sites identified, but
   its heating potential (14.2 MJ kg(-1)) and charcoal yield (14\%) were
   the lowest among the five species evaluated.},

Abstract = {Farmers grow vegetables widely during the dry season in wetlands known
   locally as dambos in southern Africa. Declining soil fertility is one of
   the major factors limiting smallholder vegetable production in the
   dambos of eastern Zambia. An experiment was initiated with 43 farmers
   with the objective of assessing the agronomic and economic feasibility
   of foliar biomass of gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala) for production of cabbage, onion and a
   subsequent maize crop during the dry season. The treatments were, on a
   dry-matter basis, 8 and 12 t ha(-1) gliricidia, 12 t ha(-1) leucaena and
   10 t ha(-1) manure + half the recommended fertilizer rate, inorganic
   fertilizer at recommended rate, and a control without any inputs. Direct
   field measurements and informal enquiries were used for evaluating the
   effects of different treatments. The highest cabbage and onion yields
   were obtained from manure + half-rate fertilizer application. The
   gliricidia biomass transfer technology produced cabbage, onion and maize
   yields comparable with the full fertilizer application. In both cabbage
   and onion, manure + fertilizer gave generally higher net incomes.
   Biomass transfer also recorded higher net incomes than the control, and
   required lower cash inputs than the fully fertilized crop. Net incomes
   of the biomass treatments were substantially reduced by the labour costs
   for pruning and incorporation of the biomass. The results indicate that
   the gliricidia biomass transfer technology could be used as an
   alternative to inorganic fertilizers for vegetable production in dambos.},

Abstract = {The effect of maize-leucaena agroforestry system on the abundance and

   study covered 6 cropping seasons from September 1992 to august 1995 and
   was conducted at both Mtwapa and Amoyo in coastal and western Kenya,
   respectively. Treatments included monocropped and intercropped (maize
   {[}Zea mays], leucaena {[}Leucaena leucocephala]) plots, weeded and
   unweeded, mulched and unmulched plots, and 3 spacing regimes (1.5, 2.25,

   each rainy season. Rates of egg parasitism by Trichogramma sp. and
   Telenomus sp, were not affected by intercropping, but decreased with
   increased hedgerow spacing. Significantly more egg batches were preyed
   upon in the maize monoculture plots. Parasitoids recovered included the
   larval parasitiods Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron), Cotesia flavipes Cameron,
   Cotesia rufricus (Haliday), Glyptapanteles africanus (Cameron), Goniozus

   the hyperparsitoid if Aphanogmus fijiensis (Ferriere). Larval and pupal
   parasitism at Mtwapa were unaffected by the vegetation structure or
   cultural treatment. However, at Amoyo, the percentage of stem borer
   larvae and pupae parasitized were significantly greater in the maize
   monocrop plot than in the intercropped plots, whereas parasitism also
   significantly increased with increasing hedgerow spacing. However, at
   both sites, larval and pupal mortality were unaffected by the vegetation
   structure. The oviposition preference of the predatory Chrysopa species
   was not influenced by the cropping system.},

Abstract = {Soil amendment with organic materials (crop residues animal manure, and
   green manure) reportedly has positive effects on soil properties, from
   acidity to plant-nutrient availability. To examine that hypothesis, an
   incubation study was conducted to assess the changes in some chemical
   properties of three different tropical soils (Andisol. Ultisol, and
   Oxisol) amended with chicken manure and green manure (Leucaena
   leucocephala) at the rate of 10 t ha(-1). The results showed that
   organic amendments raised soil pH and EC, regardless of the type of
   manure used. Manuring lowered the concentrations of Mehlich-3
   extractable Ca. P, Mn and Si in all soils and decreased the
   concentration of Mg in the Ultisol and Oxisol. However, manure amendment
   led to increases in the concentrations of Mg and K in the Andisol.
   Organic amendments caused a decrease in KCI extractable Al. Initial
   soluble C levels were highest in the Oxisol (60 mu mol g(-1)) and lowest
   in the Andisol (20 mu mol g(-1)). The concentration of soluble C
   decreased exponentially with duration of incubation. Three low molecular
   weight organic molecules (acetic acid, catechol and oxalic acid) out of
   the eight tested were found in all manure-amended soils. This study
   quantified the release of some Al chelating organic acids, the reduction
   of exchangeable Al, and the changes in major plant-nutrients when
   organic materials were added to nutrient poor, tropical acid soils. (c)

Abstract = {The germination response of 13 promising and commonly used tropical and
   subtropical legumes in northern Australia was tested in the laboratory
   at 10 constant temperatures ranging from 8 to 44degreesC. Total percent
   germination for most species was high at temperatures from 16 to
   36degreesC, with Macroptilium atropurpureum, Lablab purpureus and
   Glycine latifolia germinating well at 12degreesC. Macroptilium
   atropurpureum and G. latifolia had less seed death than other species at
   8degreesC. There was no germination at 8 or 44degreesC for any species.
   Optimum temperature for rate of germination ranged from 24degreesC for
   G. latifolia up to 36degreesC for Macroptilium bracteatum. Leucaena
   leucocephala showed a 12-degree range (24-36degreesC) of optimum
   temperatures for rate of germination, but most species had a range of
   4-8degreesC. The ability to germinate at a broad range of temperatures
   indicates that the species are well adapted to northern Australia.
   Consideration of these responses could be useful in selection of future
   species or cultivars. Existing linear models with base, optimum and
   ceiling temperatures, and coefficients of germination rate above and
   below optimum temperature were tested to predict germination from
   thermal time. Predicted germination in real time explained 73-90\% of
   the variation in observed germination, with the closeness of fit poor at
   temperatures distant from optimum. Models using a series of step-wise
   linear equations describing each 5\% interval of germination explained
   over 99\% of the variation in cumulative germination with time, but
   required a large number of parameters.},

Year = {1991},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {177-192},
Abstract = {Perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp.) was grown as a
   multipurpose tree species in strips or blocks with annual crops
   (sorghum, sunflower and chickpea) on a shallow Vertisol from 1987 to
   1989.  The interaction between the perennial pigeonpea and annual crops
   was measured at the tree-crop interface (TCI) by comparing the plants at
   the interface (I) and in the middle of the block planting (N).
   Perennial pigeonpea I plants had significantly more branches and bigger
   stems than N plants at the onset of the following rainy season.  The
   greater number of flowers and grains of the I pigeonpea plants was
   partly due to a better lateral light level and partly due to a better
   access to water.  On the other hand the negative effect on annual crops
   at the TCI extended to 1.5 m during the rainy season and to 2.5 m during
   the post-rainy season.  Significant reduction in the growth of annual
   crops occurred at 30-40 days after sowing and was associated with the
   shading by the taller pigeonpea.  Measurements of root profile of
   pigeonpea at the interface indicated that competition for moisture was
   the major cause for yield reduction of chickpea during the post-rainy
   season but an allelopathetic effect may also be involved.  The results
   are compared with other TCI studies especially with Leucaena
   leucocephala in the semi-arid crops and the possible mechanisms for
   moisture interaction at the TCI are discussed.},

Abstract = {Conventional cattle ranching in Latin America has been based mostly on
   extensive pasture monocultures planted with minimum tree cover. The
   current trend towards replacing treeless pastures with silvopastoral
   systems that include tree and shrub species enhances productivity and
   provides environmental services within these systems. We studied the ant
   fauna in cattle farms at La Vieja river basin, Colombia, with the aim of
   analyzing the relations between tree cover and ant species diversity and
   composition in different land uses in this cattle-dominated landscape.
   Monitoring was performed between 2004 and 2007 in 21 plots representing
   seven contrasting land uses characteristic of this Andean landscape.
   Ants were sampled with baits (arboreal and ground) and pitfall traps. A
   total of 68,860 individuals belonging to 227 ant species was recorded.
   Ant diversity was positively related to the presence of woody
   vegetation. The largest number of ant species was found in secondary
   forests followed by improved pastures with trees. Pastures without trees
   had less than half the number of ant species in pastures with trees. Ant
   species richness in intensive Leucaena leucocephala (Mimosaceae)
   silvopastoral systems also surpassed that recorded in treeless pastures.
   This study provides evidence supporting the conservation value of
   silvopastoral systems at the landscape level in the Colombian Andes. The
   conservation of forest fragments in this area is vital, as they provide
   refuge for a unique regional ant fauna (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {With recent advances in rhizobial phylogeny, questions are being asked
   as to how an ecological framework can be developed so that rhizobial
   classification and diversity could have greater practical applications
   in enhancing agricultural productivity in tropical ecosystems. Using the
   results of studies on tropical rhizobia which nodulate agroforestry tree
   legumes, three ecological aspects of rhizobial biodiversity were used to
   illustrate how its potential can be exploited. The results showed that
   legumes nodulate with diverse rhizobial types, thus contributing to the
   success of legumes in colonising a wide range of environments. There was
   an apparent shift in the relative dominance of rhizobia populations by
   different rhizobial types as soil pH changed. The Rhizobium tropici-type
   rhizobia were predominant under acidic conditions, Mesorhizobium spp. at
   intermediate pH and Sinorhizobium spp. under alkaline conditions. The R.
   tropici-type rhizobia were the most effective symbiotic group on all the
   host legumes. However, strains of Sinorhizobium spp. were as effective
   as the R. tropici types in N-2-fixation on Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra
   calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala; while Mesorhizobium strains were
   equally as effective as the R. tropici types on Sesbania sesban.
   Classification of rhizobia based on phenotypic properties showed a broad

Abstract = {We studied the ecological characteristics of 45-50-yr-old subtropical
   dry forest stands in Puerto Rico that were growing on sites that had
   been deforested and used intensively for up to 128 yr. The study took
   place in the Guanica Commonwealth Forest. Our objective was to assess
   the long-term effects of previous land use on this forest-i.e., its
   species composition, structure, and functioning. Previous land-use types
   included houses, farmlands, and charcoal pits. Stands with these land
   uses were compared with a nearby mature forest stand. The speed and path
   of forest recovery after deforestation and land-use abandonment depended
   on the conditions of the land. Study areas where land uses had removed
   the forest canopy and altered soil conditions (houses and farmlands)
   required a longer time to recover and had a different species
   composition than study areas where land uses retained a forest canopy
   (charcoal pits). Different forest attributes recovered at different
   rates. Crown area index, stem density, and litterfall rate recovered
   faster than stemwood and root, biomass, tree height, and basal area.
   Where previous land uses removed the canopy, Leucaena leucocephala, a
   naturalized alien pioneer species, dominated the regrowth. Native
   species dominated abandoned charcoal pits and mature forest. The change
   in species composition, including the invasion of alien species, appears
   to be the most significant long-term effect of human use and
   modification of the landscape.},

Abstract = {Gully is formed when land is dramatically degenerated in Arid Hot
   Valley. In the Yuan Mou and hot valley of Jin Sha River, the speed of
   headward erosion is 50 cm/a to developmental gully, and the maximum
   speed reaches 200 cm/a. The gully density is 3-5 km/hm(2), the maximum
   density reaches 7.4 km/hm(2). The gully formation mainly attributes to
   the landform characteristics, the quality of geological stratification,
   the climate characteristics, and the surface structure of soil and the
   factor of anthropic activity in this region. The biological controlling
   is quite difficult, the species choice is difficult on the one hand, and
   the technology of comprehensive controlling is not consummate on the
   other hand. In view of these characteristics, this experimental project
   has conducted the massive research and obtained the effective way of
   gully controlling. After 12 years, the fact has proved that (1) Leucaena
   leucocephala is first choice species of gully controlling, as a result
   of its own reproduction ability, causes the system to form the biology

Abstract = {Leaf samples of nine browse species, viz., breadfruit (Artocarpus

   gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium), fleminga (Fleminga macrophylla),
   leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), sesbania (Sesbania grandiflora),
   mullberry (Morus alba), and vi (Spondias mombin) were collected in the
   dry and the rainy seasons from five countries in the South Pacific

   evaluated for comparative seasonal concentration of P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe,
   Mn, Cu, and Zn for grazing beef cattle, dairy cattle (dry and
   lactating), heifers, and goats. Macro- and micro-mineral concentrations
   in the browse species were affected by seasonal climatic conditions.
   Some of the browse species had higher concentrations of macro- and
   micro-minerals in either the dry or rainy seasons above the requirements
   of specific ruminant animals. The Fe concentration in most of the browse
   species was higher (P < 0.05) in the dry season compared to the rainy
   season. The Zn concentration was extremely low in the browse species.
   Some browse species met the macro- and micro-mineral requirements of
   grazing beef cattle, dairy cattle (dry and lactating), heifers, and
   goats, while others could not satisfy all the mineral requirements of
   specific ruminant animals. The seasonal variations in the concentration
   of the macro- and micro-minerals suggest that in formulating and (or)
   supplementing rations for ruminants, both the amount of minerals in
   legumes and biological availability of these minerals need to be
   considered in the South Pacific Region.},

Abstract = {The effects of legume-based soil management on soil dispersion were
   studied on an Alfisol between 1994 and 1995 in an experiment which was
   established in 1989 in southwestern Nigeria. The fallow systems, which
   constituted the main plots in the split-plot experiment, included
   natural fallow, Pueraria phaseoloides (Roxb.) Benth, and Leucaena
   leucocephala Lam de Wit. The subplots were 25, 33, 50 and 100 per cent
   cropping intensities. Apart from indices of soil dispersion such as
   water-dispersible clay and dispersion ratio, the fractal theory was
   applied to describe the fragmentation of soil aggregates less than 4 mm.
   under the systems and cropping intensities. Although water dispersible
   clay was less than 60 g kg(-1) in the 0-15 cm. soil depth because it was
   inherently low in clay content, the soil dispersion ratio was generally
   above 50 per cent. Also, the fractal dimensions, which ranged between
   2.75 and 2.89, were similar among the fallow systems with cropping
   intensities for the surface soil. However, the interaction of slope
   position with season caused significant differences in fractal
   parameters, suggesting that the processes of soil degradation were
   different for the upper and lower slopes even with similar
   microaggregate distribution. The soil was inherently vulnerable to soil
   dispersion, although, the fallow management systems with less than 100
   per cent cropping intensity would maintain soil structure at similar
   level as the forest. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {In alley-cropping systems, hedgerow trees are regularly cut back. Losses
   of N released from the decemposing prunings are minimized when N release
   is synchronized with crop N demand. In this study, the sensitivity of
   the decomposition of Leucaena leucocephala, Senna siamea, and
   Dactyladenia barteri leaf litter to the nature of the rainfall regime is
   correlated with the residue quality. The litterbag technique was used to
   measure decomposition. Four periods of 115 days, each starting at a time
   when hedgerow trees are normally pruned, were selected and the rain that
   fell during each of these periods in 1986 was simulated on a day-to-day
   basis by applying irrigation water on the litterbags. The number of
   rainfall events was better correlated with the percentage dry matter
   loss than with the total amount of precipitation. The relationship
   consisted of two lines. The slope of the first line, indicative of the
   sensitivity of the decomposition to varying numbers of rainfall events,
   correlated well with the water-soluble fraction (P < 0.05), the C:N
   ratio (P < 0.05), and the polyphenol:N ratio (P < 0.01) of the residues.
   The decomposition process was shown to be dominated by microbial
   catabolism, rather than leaching. Because the decomposition of the
   higher quality residues is affected by varying rainfall patterns and
   because rainfall may often be unpredictable in frequency and intensity,
   synchronization of N released from a significant part of the decemposing
   residue with crop N demand may require additional management practices.},

   cooking traits (CT), Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS) and palatability
   attributes by consumer panelists, at four ageing periods (2, 7, 14 and

   supplementation (P > 0.05). Consumers only detected significant
   differences on flavor intensity (P=0.04) favoring Leucaena
   supplementation, but in general, the CL steaks had a good consumer
   acceptability (> 57\%), even though the steaks from supplemented animal
   (concentrate or Leucaena) were categorized mostly as tender meat (>

   of tender beef, but their acceptability were affected negatively (<
   52\%). In conclusion, even though differences among treatments were not
   detected, meats from the supplemented animals with Leucaena had a good
   acceptability by consumers (58\%) and showed a high proportion (84\%) of
   tender meats (WBS < 3.88kg). Regardless of feed supplementation, steaks

Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation affects the biodiversity and function of
   aboveground organisms in natural ecosystems but has not been studied for
   effects on belowground species. In this paper, we consider the diversity
   of the rhizobia associated with the indigenous legume Dalea purpurea in
   3 residual prairie areas in Minnesota and Iowa. Using Dalea purpurea as
   a trap host, 218 rhizobia were recovered from these soils then
   characterized using BOXA1R PCR. Three major and 13 minor groups were
   distinguished based on a similarity of greater than 75\% in fingerprint
   patterns. Each major group consisted almost exclusively of rhizobia from
   a single prairie, with the diversity of Dalea rhizobia recovered from
   the Hayden Prairie less than that obtained with rhizobia from the other
   prairies. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, isolates from the
   Hayden, Ordway, and Kellogg-Weaver Dunes prairies were most similar to
   Rhizobium etli and Rhizobium leguminosarum, Rhizobium gallicum, and
   Mesorhizobium amorphae and Mesorhizobium huakuii, respectively. This
   variation in the dominant microsymbiont species across the 3 prairies
   studied was unexpected but could have been influenced by the limited
   number of samples that we were allowed to take, by unanticipated
   cross-nodulation between native legumes, and by variation in the range
   of legume species present in each residual prairie area. While some of
   the rhizobia from Dalea nodulated Phaseolus vulgaris, Macroptilium
   atropurpureum, Leucaena leucocephala, and Onobrychis viciifolia in
   addition to the Dalea species tested, others nodulated Astragalus

Abstract = {It is important to know the seasonal cycles of reserve carbohydrates in
   agroforestry trees because their ability to sprout after cutting may
   depend on reserve carbohydrate levels. Such information is lacking for
   tropical agroforestry trees. Reserve carbohydrate trends were examined
   in uncut, 12-year-old multipurpose trees in the seasonally dry climate
   of Ibadan, Nigeria. Species included Dactyladenia barteri, Gliricidia
   sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Pterocarpus soyauxii, and Senna siamea.
   Definite seasonal trends were observed. Concentrations of sugar and
   total reserve carbohydrates (sugar+starch) were highest during the dry
   season. Starch had two maxima, one early in the dry season, and one
   early in the wet season. Conversion of starch to sugar seemed to occur
   as trees developed drought tolerance. All carbohydrate values decreased
   as active growth resumed during the wet season. In general, all
   carbohydrate values were relatively low as active growth continued; they
   increased only when dry weather slowed growth. In several species,
   carbohydrate concentrations in the lower holes decreased during
   reproductive growth, especially during the last phase of fruit
   maturation. Significant linear correlations were found between
   concentrations of sugar and total reserve carbohydrates and a number of
   weather variables - rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and solar
   radiation. Correlations with starch were much lower than for sugar,
   although several were significant, suggesting that seasonal trends in
   starch are too complex to be described adequately by linear
   correlations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Marginal lands in Central Sri Lanka are steeply sloped, severely eroded,
   highly acidic, and partially or completely devoid of fertile topsoil. To
   rehabilitate these lands under a ruminant livestock system, a study was
   conducted to investigate the potential of leguminous and non-leguminous
   shrub species. Legumes (Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra calothyrsus,
   Flemingia macrophylla, Desmodium rensonii, Erythrina variegata, and
   Leucaena leucocephala) and non-legumes (Tithonia diversifolia and Morus
   alba) were established in double hedgerows 7 m apart. Leaf dry matter
   yields (LDMY) of hedgerows 100 m in length were estimated during a
   period of one year with a 16-week lopping cycle. The highest LDMY was
   obtained in E. variegata (276 +/- 23 kg/year) and the lowest was in D.
   rensonii (86 +/- 12 kg/year). The crude protein content of leguminous
   shrub species ranged from 210 to 270 g/kg dry matter (DM), whereas the
   range for non-legumes was from 120 to 180 g/kg DM. Acid detergent fiber
   in all the species was more than 300 g/kg DM while lignin content varied
   widely from 81 to 284 g/kg DM. The in vitro dry matter digestibility
   (IVDMD) was above 500 g/kg in all the species except F. macrophylla (466
   g/kg). This paper also provides information on soluble fraction and
   potential degradability. This study suggests that ruminant livestock
   production based on fodder trees is an option for the marginal lands of

   Interactions between inoculation and P, N and micronutrients on

   fertility and the presence of only a few native leucaena rhizobia. At
   one site, only inoculated plants were nodulated, while at the other of

   only a positive effect on nitrogenase activity. Phosphorus increased
   total nitrogen and phosphorus uptake and plant growth. A 75\% increase
   in shoot dry weight was obtained when 80 kg P ha-1 was applied to

Abstract = {Slope erosion and shallow failures occur in developed areas in Malaysia
   as a result of the natural vegetation removal, resulting in soil
   disturbance and greater exposure of bare ground. The use of
   bioengineering techniques through vegetation is a preferred solution to
   these problems by providing cover from rainfall and reinforcing the soil
   through root systems. Considering the potential of bioengineering in
   slope management, the current study aims to (i) review slope
   bioengineering techniques that uses vegetation to stabilise slope in
   Malaysia and (ii) highlight research gaps. Findings were discussed from
   17 original studies published between 2000 and 2020, which were selected
   from the output of four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Science
   Direct, and Google Scholar), several grey literature works, and local
   scientific publications. The studies on bioengineering using vegetation
   recorded that several slope species with superior performance in terms
   of beneficial traits, such as root length density and transpiration
   rate, were more prominent in Melastoma malabathricum and Leucaena
   leucocephala. Moreover, previous studies identified biomaterials that
   protected slopes, including empty fruit bunch and geotextiles, despite
   the currently critical limitations in the applicability of these
   techniques. This study highlighted the research gaps that may lead to
   the progress of the bioengineering techniques, such as beneficial traits
   and techniques, the exploration of mix-culture systems, and the
   utilisation of modelling techniques. This review serves as a structured
   and current overview of bioengineering knowledge for shallow slope
   instability and erosion management in Malaysia.},

Abstract = {The present study evaluated for the first time, some strength properties
   and the chemical compositions of seven hardwood species grown in
   Northeast Egypt, namely, Acacia saligna, Delonix regia, Erythrina
   humeana, Ficus elastica, Leucaena leucocephala, Melia azedarach, and
   Meryta sinclairii. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated
   that the effect of wood species on the mechanical properties and
   chemical compositions was significant (P < 0.01). The parameters used to
   describe the mechanical properties and chemical compositions of the wood
   of the seven species differed from one species to another. The cellulose
   contents of the studied species, except for L. leucocephala (43.2 \%),
   M. azedarach (44.1 \%), and M. sinclairii (44.0 \%), were found to be
   lower than those of common hardwood species. The variations in MOR, MOE,
   C-max, and tensile strength among the seven species were expected given
   the differences in wood density and chemical compositions. Except for E.
   humeana, the other hardwood species studied could be considered to have
   moderate hardness and are suitable for making floor parquets. Overall,
   based on the studied mechanical properties, the wood of M. azedarach and
   M. sinclairii showed good MOR, MOE, and C-max values, whereas E. humeana
   wood had the lowest such values. In terms of mechanical properties, the
   seven hardwood species studied in the present investigation can thus be
   concluded to have the following order: M. azedarach > M. sinclairii > L.
   leucocephala > D. regia > F. elastica > A. saligna > E. humeana.},

Abstract = {A study of the skin diseases in sheep and goats in the semiarid of the
   states of Paraiba, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte, Northeastern
   Brazil was performed. From January 2000 to November 2006, 656 cases in
   goats and 324 in sheep were presented to the Veterinary Hospital of the
   Federal University of Campina Grande in Patos, Paraiba. Additionally
   mailed in biopsy or necropsy skin samples from 31 goats and 45 sheep
   were studied histologically. Skin diseases were diagnosed in 35 goats
   (5.33\% of all cases in this species) and 45 sheep (13.88\% of the cases
   in this species). The most frequent skin disease was myiasis (10 cases
   in goats and 7 in sheep), followed by contagious echtyma (8 cases in
   goats and 2 in sheep), squamous cell carcinoma (4 cases in goats and 5
   in sheep), dermatophylosis (8 cases in sheep), and allergic dermatitis
   (1 case in goats and 1 in sheep). Two cases of pythiosis in sheep, two
   cases of epidermolysis bullosa in goats, one case of poisoning by
   Brachiaria brizantha (photosensitization) and another by Leucaena
   leucocephala (alopecia) in sheep, and one case of papillomatosis, one of
   pemphigus foliaceous, one of protothecosis and one of rhabdomyosarcoma
   in goats were also diagnosed. In 4 cases in sheep and 19 in goats the
   etiologic diagnosis was not obtained. With the information of the
   occurrence and epidemiology of the skin diseases is possible to
   determine efficient control measures.},

Abstract = {A model experiment was carried out at 15, 25, and 35 degrees C to
   investigate the changes in microbial biomass and the pattern of
   mineralization in upland soil during 8 weeks following the addition of 8
   organic materials including 6 tropical plant residues, ipil ipil
   (Leucaena leucocephala), azolla (Azolla pinnata a), water hyacinth
   (Eichhornia crassipes), dhaincha (Sesbania rostrata), cowpea (Vigna
   unguiculata), and sunhemp (Crotalaria juncea). The amounts of CO2-C
   evolved and inorganic N produced at 35 degrees C were about 2 times
   larger than those at 15 degrees C. At any temperature, the flush
   decomposition of C was observed within the first week and thereafter the
   rate of mineralization became relatively slow. A negative correlation
   was observed between inorganic N and C/N ratios of the added organic
   materials. The relationships between the amounts of cellulose or
   cellulose plus hemicellulose and the amount of mineralized N of the
   added organic materials were also negative.
   The changes in the microbial biomass were affected by temperatures. The
   amount of biomass C and N was maximum after 42 d of incubation at 15
   degrees C, and after 7 d at 25 and 35 degrees C, and thereafter
   decreased. The rate of biomass decline was slower at 15 degrees C and
   faster at 35 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. Regardless of the
   temperatures, the addition of organic materials enhanced microbial
   biomass formation throughout the incubation periods.},

Title = {Larger water use efficiency associated with greater dependence on deep
   water sources in hot-dry valleys with reservoirs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {630},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Identifying the carbon-water relationship of plants helps to understand
   their adaptive water use strategies. The relationship between WUE and
   the water source remains uncertain in the hot-dry valleys with
   reservoirs. The leaf delta 13C and soil and xylem water isotopes (delta
   2H and delta 18O) were determined to identify the WUE and water source
   contributions, respectively, in Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit
   communities. We propose a source contributing score (SCS), calculated as
   a value for the contribution of water from different soil layers (a
   higher SCS value indicates plants use deeper water sources). The
   positive relationship between leaf delta 13C and SCS (R2 = 0.16, P =
   0.022) and the negative relationship between leaf delta 13C and topsoil
   contribution (R2 = 0.21, P = 0.009) confirmed the close association of
   larger WUE with less reliance on shallow soil water. The redundancy
   analysis suggested a stronger connection between leaf delta 13C and
   d-excess than leaf delta 13C and topsoil moisture content, which
   emphasized the key role of soil moisture d-excess. Variation
   partitioning analysis (VPA) suggested soil properties and microclimate
   explain more than 89.8 \% of the variations in tree water use. VPA also
   suggested different roles of microclimate and soil properties in
   explaining tree water use strategies. Findings broadened the
   understanding of the relationship between WUE and water sources and
   emphasized the key role of soil moisture d-excess in hot-dry valleys
   with reservoirs.},

Abstract = {Objectives. To relate the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on
   Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus tick loads on cows grazing either in
   intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) (Lucerna) or in grass pastures
   associated with sugarcane plantations (La Isabela). Materials and
   methods. Tick counts were performed on 27 Lucerne breed animals that
   were in different physiological states, six of which were grazing on
   forage grass paddocks associated with commercial sugarcane plantations
   and the remaining animals grazed in an ISS based on Leucaena
   leucocephala and Cynodon plectostachyus. The tick counts were made every
   15 days. The data of temperature, humidity, and radiation were taken
   from a weather station that was inside the ISS. Results. There was a
   weak relationship between saturation deficit and tick load (R-2=0.34)
   and another between UV radiation and tick load (R-2=0.205) for animals
   grazing in ISS. There were differences in tick counts when comparing
   animals of similar productivity from both systems evaluated: in La
   Isabela (sugarcane grass paddocks) average counts were 311 ticks
   perceptible to the touch (TPT) and in Lucerna (ISS farm) average counts
   were 206 TPT (p=0.02). Additionally, there were greater tick counts in
   high productivity cows compared to low productivity cows. Conclusions.
   The abiotic and biotic factors of the ecosystem and animal productivity
   can affect the TPT counts. In ISS systems, tick counts can be lower than
   those observed in monoculture grazing systems.},

Abstract = {Feasibility of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for developing
   multi-species model for plantation timber was explored for estimation of
   holocellulose in un-extracted milled wood samples. Six commonly planted
   species of Eucalyptus tereticornis, E. camaldulensis, E. grandis,
   Leucaena leucocephala, Dalbergia sissoo and Populus deltoides from a
   wide range of locations and varying age groups were taken for the
   present study. Few samples of E. hybrid between E. tereticornis and E.
   camaldulensis were also included in the study to make the model useful
   for practical application. NIR models were evaluated using partial least
   squares regression (PLSR-1-full cross-validation,
   PLSR-2-cross-validation which leaves more than one out) and by dividing
   the samples into calibration and prediction (test) sets and
   interchanging them from calibration to prediction sets. The predictive
   ability of the model was assessed by calculating four ratios of
   multivariate statistics for individual species model and combined
   species models. A final combined model for all the species having
   component range of 76.14-63.03 \% and standard deviation of 2.586 \% was
   developed in the spectral range of 7502-4246 cm(-1) wave number using
   1st derivative plus multiplicative scatter correction using factor of
   nine by removing samples with outliers found in all the PLSR-2
   evaluation steps and in most of the models. The model remained stable
   even when 30 \% of the samples were left out with no outlier detected.},

Abstract = {This work details the structure and composition of the woody plant
   community of a gallery forest located in the La Silla River, between
   Monterrey and Guadalupe urban areas in Nuevo Le ` on, Mexico. For the
   analysis, the woody vegetation was categorized into upper and lower
   strata. The upper stratum maximum height was 38 m, and the canopy cover
   was 100\%. The canopy consisted of 22 species from 16 families, of which
   seven species represented 82.3\% of the importance value index (IV);
   Taxodium huegelii had the highest IV (34.32\%). The lower stratum
   maximum height was 2.5 m, and the cover was 48\%. Thirteen species from
   10 families were identified, five of which reached 81.3\% of the IV;
   Ricinus communis had the highest IV (23.42\%). The plant community
   diversity was 3.8 and 2.29, based on Margalef and Shannon indices,
   respectively. As one finding in the present study, it can be stated that
   the main threat is the presence of widely distributed exotic species
   such as Ricinus communis and Leucaena leucocephala, with high importance
   values. However, the presence of a well-established tree stratum, as
   well as the presence of species typical of the gallery forest, suggest a
   good state of conservation of this gallery forest. The present results
   highlight the importance of studying the composition, structure, and
   diversity, taking into consideration the flora of floristic provinces,

Abstract = {A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the effects of a rock
   phosphate-solubilizing fungus (Mortierella sp.) and an arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungus (Claroideoglomus claroideum (N. C. Schenck \& G. S.
   Sm.) C. Walker \& A. Schuler comb. nov.) on enhancing plant phosphate
   (P) uptake and growth of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) in three tropical
   soils that exhibited contrasting soil P sorption capacities.
   For this purpose, the three soils (Mollisol, Oxisol and Andisol) were
   amended with Huila rock phosphate (RP) at a P rate of 300 mg kg(-1) and
   inoculated with neither, one, or both fungi.
   The results indicate that a three-way interaction occurred for all
   variables studied and that the effectiveness of the PSM in increasing
   plant P uptake and growth was limited by the soil P sorption. For
   instance, PSM inoculation was ineffective in the Andisol (very high P
   sorption capacity) even when the mycorrhizal association was present,
   while in the Oxisol (medium P sorption) the PSM was only effective when
   the plant was concomitantly inoculated with the AMF (dual inoculation).
   In contrast, both individual PSM inoculation and individual AMF
   inoculation were effective in promoting plant P uptake and growth in the
   Mollisol (low soil P sorption); however, the effect was even higher in
   the presence of both (dual inoculation).
   Although the PSM effect was limited by soil P sorption, this limitation
   likely was overcome by the mycorrhizal association, which permitted a
   more efficient capture of the P released from RP dissolution.},

Abstract = {Citrus limon peel (kitchen waste) and Leucaena leucocephala seeds
   (agricultural waste) were used as a modifier for fabrication of modified
   carbon paste electrode for determination of mercury in aqueous sample
   using differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry. Mercury was
   adsorbed on electrode surface at open circuit and anodic stripping
   voltammetric scan was run from -0.5 to 0.5 V. Various electrochemical
   parameters including amount of modifier, supporting electrolyte,
   accumulating solvent, pH of the accumulating solvent, and accumulation
   time were investigated. The effect of presence of other metal ions and
   surfactants was also studied. In comparison C. limon peel proved to be a
   better modifier than L. leucocephala seed biomass. This was justified by
   electrode characterization using cyclic voltammetry that indicated
   decrease in resistance of electrode when C. limon peel was used as
   modifier and increase when modifier was L. leucocephala seeds. Maximum
   current response was obtained using 5 \% C. limon peel biomass,
   hydrochloric acid as supporting electrolyte, acetate buffer of pH 6 as
   an accumulating solvent, 10-min accumulation time, and scan rate of 50
   mV/s. Linear calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range
   100 to 1,000 mu g L-1 of mercury for accumulation time of 10 min with
   limit of detection of 57.75 mu g L-1 and limit of quantification of
   192.48 mu g L-1. This technique does not use mercury as electrode
   material and, therefore, has a positive environmental benefit.},

Abstract = {Two Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped bacterial strains (C5(T) and C16),
   isolated from root nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris L. in Jiangxi Province,
   PR China, were characterized by using a polyphasic taxonomical approach.
   The phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and three concatenated
   housekeeping genes (recA-glnll-atpD) revealed that C5(T) and C16 were
   members of the genus Rhizobium, yet were distinct from known species.
   The case for strain C5(T) representing a novel species was supported by
   genomic results. Pairwise digital DNA-DNA hybridization and average
   nucleotide identity values were much lower than the proposed and
   generally accepted species boundaries. The genome-based phylogenetic
   tree reconstructed by using the up-to-date bacterial core gene set
   consisting of 92 genes showed that the strains formed a monophyletic
   branch, further supporting this result. The symbiotic genes of nodC and
   nifH were identified in both strains; each could nodulate Phaseolus
   vulgaris and Glycine max but not Leucaena leucocephala, Pisum sativum or
   Medicago sativa plants. Major cellular fatty acids of C5(T) were summed
   feature 8 (C-18:(1) omega 7c/(C)(18)(:1) omega 6c; 58.8 \%), C-18:(1)
   omega 7c 11-methyl (14.2 \%) and C-18(:0) (8.1 \%). The DNA G+C content
   of C5(T) was 61.4 mol\%. Based on these genomic, chemotaxonomic and
   phenotypic characteristics, we propose a novel species: Rhizobium
   chutanense sp. nov. The type strain is C5(T) (=CCTCC AB 2018143(T) =LMG
   30777(T)).},

Abstract = {An in vitro gas production experiment was completed to determine effects
   of four tropical browse legumes (i.e., Acacia cornigere, AC; Albizia
   lebbekoides, AL; Enterolobium cyclocarpum, EC; Leucaena leucocephala,
   LL) at 0.15 or 0.30 of total substrate on microbial fermentation of the
   tropical grass Pennisetum purpureum CT-115 (PP). Two incubation runs
   with four bottles per treatment were completed, using two bottles for
   gas production measurements Lip to 96 h and two bottles for microbial
   Purine bases (PB) concentration analysis after 24h. Inclusion of AC, EC
   and LL linearly increased (P<0.05) gas production from PP alone at an
   initial stage of fermentation (5 h) because of their higher fermentation
   rate versus PP. However, whereas the linear increase in gas production
   was maintained at mid fermentation (i.e., 24h) with AC, there was no
   effect with LL and a linear reduction in;as volume at 24 and 96 h with
   EC, possibly because of its saponin, content. Gas production with AL was
   linearly reduced at 24 and 96h (P<0.01). There were no differences in
   microbial concentrations, either estimated from a partitioning factor or
   PB analysis, but PB concentration in the solid residue increased
   three-fold when LL were included. Differences among legume species in
   chemical composition, and in the nature of their secondary compounds,
   are responsible for the fermentation pattern of mixed substrates. (C)

   by pruning to alley-cropped cassava, as well as cassava yield
   characteristics in both alley-cropped and sole plots as affected by AMF
   inoculation and pruning regimes were monitored over two consecutive
   planting periods. During the first pruning year, AMF inoculation
   promoted dry season pruning production which was masked in Leucaena at 3
   months by biomass diversion into flowering and in Gliricidia with both
   flowering and mite infestation. No definite patterns were observed in
   the second pruning year due to development of indigenous AMF symbiosis
   in all plots. Total yield of cassava increased with inoculation in all
   plots but dry season leaf area values and tuber yield indices were
   relatively higher in cassava alley-cropped with Senna and sole cassava
   than in others. The low total yield of sole cassava makes cassava alley
   cropped with Senna (inoculated or uninoculated) the best option for
   maintaining steady tuber yield with time in a continuing alley-cropping

Abstract = {A long-term experiment was conducted to assess the performance of
   stocker ram lambs utilizing stockpiled foliage and forage from
   established Leucaena leucocephala- based silvopastoral system vis-a-vis
   natural pasture. The treatments were: (1) stockpiled foliage and forage
   in a L. leucocephala -based silvipasture (silvipasture) and (2)
   stockpiled forage in a natural grasslands (natural) consisting primarily
   Sehima nervosum, Heteropogon contortus, Dichanthium annulatum and
   Chrysopogon fulvus. Deccani ram lambs (36) were allowed to graze in both
   the treatment pastures from mid September to late March during 2006-09.
   Each treatment was replicated three times in a completely randomized
   design. Total forage production, nutrient contents and lambs average
   daily gain (ADG) was significantly (P<0.01) higher in silvipasture than
   natural pasture. Silvipasture system (4.11 t/ha) produced more (P<0.01)
   forage than the natural pasture (1.36 t/ha). When the foliage of L.
   leucocephala was excluded, the silvipasture system till produced higher
   (P<0.01) crude protein (CP) than natural pasture. Average daily gain
   (P<0.01) was 87.2 g for the ram lambs in the silvipasture and 59.1 g for
   the ram lambs in the natural pasture. Lambs weight gain per ha was
   greater (P<0.01) in the silvipasture than in the natural pasture (236
   vs. 160 kg) over the grazing season. The study showed that the
   stockpiled foliage and forage from the silvopastoral system would meet
   the nutrient requirements of ram lambs even during drier months of the

Abstract = {Itajahya rosea was found growing in association with Leucaena
   leucocephala plants at Savitribai Phule Pune University campus in India.
   The species identity was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis based on ITS
   and LSU regions of rDNA, wherein, our fugus was placed along with I.
   rosea in phylogenetic tree. It represents first record of I. rosea from
   India. Frequent visitation by Drosophila species on I. rosea fruiting
   body particularly on gleba was observed. The Drosophila got attracted to
   the detached gleba under the laboratory conditions and even sometimes,
   they prefer to sit over the gleba as compare to their food banana. It
   suggested that I. rosea gleba or pseudostipe produces some compounds for
   attraction and feeding behavior of Drosophila species. Therefore, we
   characterized the volatile attractants produced by gleba and pseudostipe
   of I. rosea by GC-MS analysis. Nineteen compounds were identified from
   gleba while nine compounds were recovered from the pseudostipe. Out of
   them, blends of three abundant odor producing volatile compounds were
   reported namely, Hexadecane, Pentadecane and Nonadecane, which are
   responsible for attraction of Drosophila toward the gleba. Three fatty
   acids namely 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z), hexadecanoic acid and
   benzoic acid ethyl ester produced are served as an appetitive signal
   through olfactory response of Drosophila, so the flies were feed on the
   gleba. Two pheromones' compounds, heneicosane and
   (+)-(5S,9S)-5,9-dimethylpentadecane, were also reported in pseudostipe
   and gleba, respectively, which play a role in Drosophila for breeding.
   Our study highlights an intriguing chemical ecology of fungus-Drosophila

Abstract = {Cover crop species represent an affordable and effective weed control
   method in agroecosystems; nonetheless, the effect of its use on
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has been scantily studied. The goal
   of this study was to determine root colonization levels and AMF species
   richness in the rhizosphere of maize plants and weed species growing
   under different cover crop and weed control regimes in a long-term
   experiment. The treatment levels used were (1) cover of Mucuna
   deeringian (Muc), (2) ``mulch{''} of Leucaena leucocephala (Leu), (3)
   ``mulch{''} of Lysiloma latisiliquum (Lys), (4) herbicide (Her), (5)
   manual weeding (CD), (6) no weeding (SD), and (7) no maize and no
   weeding (B). A total of 18 species of AMF belonging to eight genera
   (Acaulospora, Ambispora, Claroideoglomus, Funneliformis, Glomus,
   Rhizophagus, Sclerocystis, and Scutellospora) were identified from trap
   cultures. Muc and Lys treatments had a positive impact on AMF species
   richness (11 and seven species, respectively), while Leu and B
   treatments on the other hand gave the lowest richness values (six
   species each). AMF colonization levels in roots of maize and weeds
   differed significantly between treatment levels. Overall, the use of
   cover crop species had a positive impact on AMF species richness as well
   as on the percentage of root colonized by AMF. These findings have
   important implications for the management of traditional agroecosystems
   and show that the use of cover crop species for weed control can result
   in a more diverse AMF community which should potentially increase crop
   production in the long run.},

   seeds occur abundantly as waste biomass in tropical and subtropical
   parts of Asia, Africa, and the USA. An experimental investigation was
   carried out in large 300-L anaerobic digesters under semi-continuous
   feed mode for 90 days. The average specific methane production yield
   observed was 0.208 Nm(3)/kg volatile solids (VS) for A. nilotica, 0.227
   Nm(3)/kg VS for P. juliflora, 0.219 Nm(3)/kg VS for A. lebbeck and 0.210
   Nm(3)/kg VS for L. leucocephala which was found to be higher than cattle
   manure's yield of 0.146 Nm(3)/kg VS. Experimental analysis revealed an
   average methane content of more than 52\% for all the seeds and a total
   volatile solid mass removal efficiency of 41.60\% for A. nilotica,
   44.19\% for P. juliflora, 43.76\% for A. lebbeck, and 41.41\% for L.
   leucocephala which was higher than 29.7\% for cattle manure. The
   experimental investigations showed that they have a higher biogas
   production potential than cattle manure indicating their huge scope and
   suitability as alternative feedstocks, and their use can also mitigate

   results denote the potentiality of the sodic bentonite as protector of

Abstract = {Increasing global fuel demand has created challenges in sourcing raw
   materials, making agro-waste biomass utilization for energy production a
   critical alternative. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
   investigate the production of charcoal briquettes using different base
   materials such as coconut shells (TC1), Leucaena leucocephala wood
   (TC2), and assorted wood charcoal residues (TC3), along with binders
   derived from cassava industry by-products-namely, tapioca starch (TB1),
   cassava peel (TB2), and cassava tubers (TB3) at binder content (BC)
   ratios of 5, 10, 15, and 20 by volume. Initially, assessing the physical
   properties, including proximate and ultimate analyses, was crucial for
   predicting effective charcoal production. The TC2 briquettes, using TB2
   and TB3 binders at a BC20 concentration, were found to be optimal,
   displaying a high production capacity and low specific energy
   consumption. Using cassava peel and tubers as binders not only
   efficiently uses agricultural by-products, thereby reducing costs and
   avoiding competition with food resources (TC1) but also results in
   high-quality briquettes. In scenarios of raw material shortages, TC3 and
   TC2 can effectively replace TC1. Mechanically, TC3 and TC2 briquettes
   exhibited superior characteristics. Although BC20 enhances the
   mechanical properties and facilitates handling, it may compromise heat
   release. Thermally, a higher BC decreases the charcoal proportion,
   leading to increased ignition time, reduced calorific value, and heating
   effectiveness. In conclusion, the successful production of charcoal
   briquettes from agro-industrial waste using cassava industrial binders
   presents a viable pathway towards more sustainable energy practices,
   improves waste management, and adds value to agricultural waste.},

Abstract = {Bio-oil upgrading to produce biofuels and chemicals has become an
   attractive topic over the past decade. However, the design of cost- and
   performance-effective catalysts for commercial-scale production remains
   a challenge. Herein, commercial titania (TiO2) was used as the support
   of cobalt (Co)-based catalysts (Co/TiO2) due to its low cost, high
   availability, and practicability for commercialization in the future.
   The Co/TiO2 catalysts were made with two different forms of TiO2
   (anatase {[}TiO2-A] and rutile {[}TiO2-R]) and comparatively evaluated
   in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of 4-propylguaicol (4PG), a
   lignin-derived model compound. Both Co/TiO2 catalysts promoted the HDO
   of 4PG following a similar pathway, but the Co/TiO2-R catalyst exhibited
   a higher activity in the early stages of the reaction due to the
   formation of abundant Ti3+ species, as detected by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) and hydrogen-temperature programed reduction
   (H-2-TPR) analyses. On the other hand, the Co/TiO2-A catalyst possessed
   a higher acidity that enhanced propylcyclohexane production at prolonged
   reaction times. In terms of reusability, the Co/TiO2-A catalyst showed a
   higher stability (less Co leaching) and reusability compared to
   Co/TiO2-R, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
   inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)
   analyses. The HDO of the real bio-oil derived from pyrolysis of Leucaena
   leucocephala revealed that the Co/TiO2-A catalyst could convert high
   oxygenated aromatics (methoxyphenols, dimethoxyphenols, and
   benzenediols) to phenols and enhanced the phenols content, hinting at
   its potential to produce green chemicals from bio-feedstock.},

Abstract = {Salinity is one of the most detrimental abiotic stresses to the
   productivity of crops. Saline lands can be easily transformed into
   commercial forest plantations by growing high value tree species.
   Therefore, present investigation was undertaken to assess the effect of
   saline irrigation (ECiw similar to 9), including control, and ten
   different host species (Melia dubia, Dalbergia sissoo, Azadirachta
   indica, Casuarina equisetifolia, Acacia ampliceps, Citrus aurantium,
   Punica granatum, Syzygium cumini, Phyllanthus emblica, and Leucaena
   leucocephala) on growth, physiological processes and salinity tolerance
   of sandalwood (Santalum album L.). Results revealed that hosts D.
   sissoo, A. indica, and M. dubia maintained high (p < 0.05) K+ /Na+ ratio
   and resulted in higher growth of sandalwood under salinity stress. The
   plant growth traits of sandalwood showed variable trends of decline with
   different hosts under the same conditions. The biomass of sandalwood
   decreased by 41-75\% under salinity stress; resulting in the substantial
   differences for salinity tolerance varying from 25 to 59.8\%. Sandalwood
   grown with D. sissoo produced maximum (p < 0.05) biomass under salinity
   stress as well as depicted higher salinity tolerance. The growth
   parameters (collar diameter, height, and biomass) of sandalwood
   exhibited a highly negative (p < 0.05) correlation with Na+ ion under
   salinity stress. Hosts M. dubia, D. sissoo, and A. indica showed only a
   slight decline in growth and biomass of sandalwood under salinity
   stress. Results suggested that sandalwood growth is modulated mainly by
   host species under both control and salinity stress, and thus have
   immense potential for cultivation with suitable host in the degraded
   saline soils.},

Abstract = {A predator-proof fence was built at Kaena Point Natural Area Reserve,
   Hawaii in 2010 as part of an ecosystem restoration project. All
   non-native mammalian predators were removed and are now excluded.
   Non-native plants are being removed and native species are being
   outplanted. We monitored abundance and reproduction of Puffinus
   pacificus (wedge-tailed shearwaters), collected soil samples before and
   after fence construction, and examined the relationship between changes
   in shearwater numbers and soil nutrients. Shearwater numbers increased
   over time, from 11 young produced in 1994 to 3,274 in 2012. The average
   number of shearwaters produced during the 3 years before and after fence
   construction increased from 614 +/- 249 to 2,359 +/- 802 (384\%
   increase). The average number of shearwater pairs attempting to nest
   also increased during the same periods, from 3,265 +/- 827 to 4,726 +/-
   826 (45\% increase). Soil samples from 2010 to 2013 showed an overall
   decline in concentration of ammonium (NH4+) and no change in
   concentration of nitrate (NO3-) or orthophosphate (PO43-). However,
   there was a positive relationship between changes in shearwater numbers
   and changes in ammonium. Examination of spatial patterns in nutrient
   abundance showed that the highest nutrient concentrations occurred in
   areas dominated by the non-native nitrogen-fixing plants Leucaena
   leucocephala and Prosopis pallida. Removal of these plants caused local
   nutrient declines, but increases in shearwater numbers have countered
   this at some points. We anticipate that shearwaters and other seabirds
   will replace non-native plants as the dominant source of nitrogen and
   phosphorous and facilitate recovery of a native-dominated plant
   assemblage.},

Abstract = {Soil temperature and soil moisture are the most important environmental
   factors controlling soil respiration (SR) in ecosystems. However, SR and
   associated edaphic factors have not been widely studied in semi-arid
   regions. In this study, SR was measured in a riparian zone and the
   effect of soil temperature and soil moisture on SR was examined under
   five forest species of the semi-arid region. The mean daily SR rate was
   1.82, 2.08, 2.35, 2.27 and 2.07 g C m(-2) d(-1) in Jatropha curcas,
   Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica and Prosopis
   juliflora sites respectively. It was found that SR was significantly and
   positively correlated with soil moisture. A univariate model of
   sub-surface soil moisture could explain 77\% of temporal variation in
   soil CO2 efflux, irrespective of species and sites. The logarithmic
   model could best explain the relationship between SR and soil moisture
   at 10-20 cm of soil depth (P < 0.001). There were negative correlations
   between SR and soil temperature under majority of species. Overall,
   across all species, soil temperature poorly explained 26\% variation in
   SR as independent variable. For SR rate-temperature relationship, a
   bell-shaped function gave the best fit in this ecosystem. Under all the
   species, SR increases with increase in soil temperature up to 33 degrees
   C (+/- 2); thereafter it decreases gradually under all species. There
   was strong evidence that deficit of soil moisture rather than soil
   temperature was the main regulating factor of SR under the semi-arid
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Despite its detrimental impacts, mimosa, Mimosa pigra L., does have
   uses. It has been of botanical interest since the 19th century, which
   led to its introduction and cultivation in botanic gardens outside of
   its native range. As late as the 1980s, its ornamental value was still
   being promoted in a seed catalogue. Mimosa was purposely introduced to
   Thailand from Indonesia in 1947 as a green manure and cover crop in
   tobacco plantations. Mimosa fixes nitrogen and, in areas of Australia
   where it grows profusely, it increases soil fertility and redistributes
   nutrients from the lower soil profile to the surface. This may be
   beneficial for establishing vegetation after clearing mimosa. It is used
   for firewood, bean-poles and as temporary fences, and has been tested as
   a medium for growing mushrooms. Samples of fibreboard have been made
   from the wood in Thailand but the board was found to absorb too much
   moisture to be of commercial use. Mimosa has high protein content, and
   studies have been carried out in Thailand to evaluate its use as a
   substitute for Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in animal feed. It is
   heavily grazed by native animals in Nigeria and has been observed to be
   browsed by horses, buffalo, cattle and goats elsewhere. It has been used
   as a medicinal plant for colds, fever, toothaches, eye medicine,
   snakebite, weak heart and diarrhoea, and it has antimicrobial activity.
   In Australia, the harvest of mimosa to extract vegetable tannins and to
   provide biomass to generate electricity has been proposed under
   controlled conditions.},

   recycling in high density ('energy') plantations in arid climate of
   north-western India (29 degrees 10'N latitude, 75 degrees 46'E

   highest in the vegetation of 4-year-old stand of Leucaena leucocephala:
   N, 1159; P, 62; K, 563; Ca, 478 and Mg, 134 kg ha(-1); the values were
   two-fold greater than the stand of Acacia nilotica and threefold higher
   than that of Eucalyptus tereticornis. Leaves had the highest
   concentrations of nutrients followed by fruit and bark. Maximum amounts
   of nutrients were stored in the branches of A. nilotica and L.
   leucocephala, and in boles off. tereticornis. The transfer of nutrients
   through litterfall in the stand of L. leucocephala was significantly (p
   < 0.05) higher than in the remaining two species. In 8-year-old stands,
   nutrient contents in vegetation and their recycling rates through
   litterfall increased markedly, while rates of nutrients accumulated as
   the vegetation decreased. The enrichment quotients of vegetation were
   maximum for N, P and Mg in L. leucocephala and for K and Ca in E.
   tereticornis. Greater quantities of nutrients in the stands were in the
   soil compartment except phosphorus. Soil phosphorus may become a
   limiting factor in maintaining high productivity in subsequent rotations
   because boles and branches are completely removed from the ecosystem.

Abstract = {Litterfall and its subsequent decomposition in the soil are two
   essential ecosystem processes. In order to determine the biological
   potential of a species to aid soil restoration, it is necessary to
   evaluate litter production, its temporal variation, and rates of
   decomposition and nutrient cycling. In this study, we examined patterns
   of litterfall production, quality, and decomposition of two slow-growing
   (Crescentia alata and Eysenhardtia polystachya) and two fast-growing
   (Leucaena leucocephala and Pithecellobium dulce), multi-purpose
   indigenous species from seasonally dry tropical forest, in a 10-year-old
   plantation in Morelos, Mexico. Average litterfall was 7.82 +/- A 2.69 Mg
   ha(-1) year(-1) and varied significantly among species as follows: P.
   dulce > L. leucocephala > C. alata = E. polstachya. Leaf litter
   comprised the highest fraction in all species studied. In a litterbag
   experiment, all species had fast mass loss in the first 183 days of
   decomposition, coinciding with the rainy season. L. leucocephala had
   significantly higher decomposition than the other species. Nitrogen
   percentages increased significantly as decomposition progressed for all
   species except for E. polystachya while Carbon percentages during
   decomposition significantly decreased only in C. alata and L.
   leucocephala. C. alata had the highest average C/N ratio and L.
   leucocephala the lowest. We recommended for soil biological restoration,
   P. dulce because it is a fast-growing tree, with a rapid canopy closure
   and a high litter production and L. Leucocephala, which produces large
   amounts of rapidly decomposing mulch with high amount of nutrients,
   which can be rapidly released into the soil.},

Abstract = {Aims:
   To assess the phenotypic, symbiotic and genotypic diversity scope of
   Mesorhizobium spp. strains associated with Acacia seyal (Del.) isolated
   from different agro-ecological zones in Senegal, and uses of susceptible
   microbial inoculum in a reafforestation process.
   Methods and Results:
   A polyphasic approach including phenotypic and genotypic techniques was
   used to study the diversity and their relationships with other biovars
   and species of rhizobia. The geographical origins of the strains have
   limited effect on their phylogenetic and phenotypic classification.
   Nodulation tests indicated promiscuity of the strains studied, because
   they were capable of nodulating six woody legume species (Acacia
   auriculiformis, Acacia senegal, A. seyal, Acacia tortilis ssp. raddiana,
   Leucaena leucocephala and Prosopis juliflora). Sequencing and
   phylogenetic analyses of nodA, nodC and nifH genes pointed out that in
   contrast to nodA gene, the phylogenies of nodC and nifH genes were not
   consistent with that of 16S rRNA, indicating that these genes of the A.
   seyal-nodulating rhizobia might have different origins. Microbial
   inoculation on nonsterile soil had significant effect on the nodules
   number and the growth of the seedlings, indicating that these strains of
   rhizobia might be used as inoculum.
   Conclusions:
   The results indicated that A. seyal is a nonselective host that can
   establish effective symbiosis with Mesorhizobium spp. strains from
   diverse genomic backgrounds and that the selected A. seyal-nodulating
   rhizobia could enhance plant growth.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   These results showed the important role that A. seyal could play in the
   improvement of reafforestation process as a promiscuous host, which can
   establish effective symbiosis with rhizobia from diverse genomic
   backgrounds.},

   of three different grass cultivars intercropped with leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala). The treatments consisted of three grass cultivars (ruzi,

   at three row spacings (1, 2 and 4 m width) as the sub plots and leucaena
   cutting height (10 and 25 cm above ground levels) as sub-sub-plots.
   Dwarf napier consistently produced more dry matter than Taiwan A25 or
   ruzi and Taiwan A25 outyielded ruzi. Leucaena yield was highest in the
   ruzi plot and lowest in the dwarf napier plot. However, yields of grass
   plus leucaena were highest in the dwarf napier plot and were lowest in
   the ruzi plots. The difference was due mainly to the grass components.
   Increasing the spacing between rows of leucaena resulted in a lower
   leucaena yield but the reverse was true for the grasses. Cutting of
   leucaena at 10 cm above ground levels depressed yields of leucaena but
   did not affect the associated grasses. In terms of herbage quality, it
   was found that the crude protein of leaves and stems of the dwarf napier
   and Taiwan A25 were higher than that of the ruzi grass. Leucaena gave
   higher levels of crude protein than all grasses. The phosphorus and
   potassium levels of all grasses were higher than leucaena. ADF levels
   were higher in the grasses than in the legumes. Nutrient contents in the
   leaves and stems of grasses and leucaena were not affected by leucaena
   spacing and cutting height.},

Abstract = {On the margins of the Cauca River in the department of Caldas, livestock
   husbandry is the main agricultural activity which occupies almost 48,828
   has of the productive territory. The dominant systems are fattening, and
   dual purpose, based on grass monoculture, while the soil purpose is more
   directed to silvopastoral systems. In addition, the pastures are low
   quality and during the summer period they suffer deterioration in the
   quality and are scarce. The forage trees and shrubs are an alternative
   for this area; however, it is required to know the performance of
   species under the conditions of the area. The objective of this work was
   to evaluate the productive performance of five cut shrub forage species,
   in hillside zones and explore their acceptance by the animals. The
   evaluated species were: leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), Matarraton
   (Gliricidia sepium), mulberry (Morus alba), Nacedero (Trichanthera
   gigantea) and Sanjoaquin (Malvaviscus arboreus). A complete blocks at
   random design was used. The experimental unit was a 5m x 10m with 50
   plants plot. Additionally, crude protein and neutral detergent fibe were
   determined.. The analyzed data corresponded to the average of the
   observations made during three consecutive days. We used 5 unweaned
   calves. The best productive performance was obtained with mulberry,
   followed by matarraton, nacedero and sanjoaquin, respectively.
   Therefore, in this area, mulberry and matarraton species are more
   appropriate for the protein banks. Leucaena was the species which had
   the lowest production. However, it is well suited to the environment of
   the area of study, it fixes nitrogen and these features make leucaena an
   appropriate species to integrate silvopastoral systems.},

   tropici, and were 18\% related to each other. As determined by an
   analysis of partial 16S ribosomal DNA sequences, each of the genomic
   species was found to belong to a lineage independent from the lineages
   of previously described Rhizobium species. Nevertheless, they were
   included in the group formed by the fast-growing Rhizobium species. Both
   genomic species 1 and genomic species 2 contained a majority of strains
   which were capable of nodulating both P. vulgaris and Leucaena
   leucocephala, like R. tropici. However, they also contained strains with
   a nodulation phenotype restricted to P. vulgaris, like R. leguminosarum
   by. phaseoli and R. etli by. phaseoli. Our data are the first evidence
   that in Europe species other than R. leguminosarum nodulate P. vulgaris.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND The in vitro gas production (GP) technique has been useful
   for evaluating the potential degradability of feedstuffs in ruminal
   environments; GP is related to the components of feedstuff ingredients.
   RESULTS Linear models were generated and validated as alternatives of
   quantifying neutral detergent-soluble fiber, starch (St)/hemicellulose
   (Hem) and cellulose (Cel) through GP. Residuals of models obtained from
   the peaks of GP {[}0-8 h (GP-8), > 8-24 h (GP-24), > 24-48 h (GP-48) and
   > 24-81 h (GP-81)] of 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12 and 0.20 g of glucose
   (Glu), St and Cel respectively. The incubations were analyzed in
   mixtures of Glu, St and Cel. The best fitting models (r(2) from 0.709 to
   0.935) were tested on corn stover (CS) to quantify rapid fermentation
   fractions (RF; equivalent to Glu), medium fermentation fractions (MF;
   equivalent to St) and low fermentation fractions (LF48; equivalent to
   Cel); in CS, RF, MF and LF models had standardized residuals < 0.09. The
   analysis with Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam. de Wit) and star
   grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst) consider high-protein ingredients.
   CONCLUSION The in vitro GP of RF, MF and LF48 fractions equivalent to
   Glu, St and Cel are affected by maturity and harvest time even when the
   chemical composition remains similar, and so RF, MF and LF48 should be
   considered during the design of ruminant diets. In vitro GP could be
   used to quantify the components of some forages, although further
   studies are necessary. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry},

Abstract = {Livestock production in the tropics contributes significantly to global
   greenhouse gas emissions, so better understanding the role of
   silvopastoral systems (SPS) in mitigating such emissions is necessary.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the amounts of carbon stored in
   the biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) components of a Leucaena
   leucocephala cum Panicum maximum silvopasture system (SPS) compared to a
   deciduous tropical forest (DTF), and a grass monoculture (GM) in
   Michoacan, Mexico. The above- and below-ground biomass were measured by
   destructive sampling in the SPS and GM, while previously reported
   allometric equations were used to quantify biomass stocks in the DTF.
   The SOC concentration up to 30cm was determined by dry combustion
   method. The SPS and DTF contained more aboveground biomass (41.8 +/-
   3.30 and 36.7 +/- 5.72MgDMha(-1)) compared to GM (8.0 +/-
   0.76MgDMha(-1)). However, the SPS exhibited greater belowground biomass
   (16.4 +/- 1.95MgDMha(-1)) than the other systems. The DTF had the
   highest SOC fraction in all depth classes with values ranging from 3.1
   +/- 0.07\% to 3.7 +/- 0.06\%, respectively, compared to the other
   systems. The total carbon stocks in SPS was similar to DTF (120.7 +/-
   10.97 vs. 120.9 +/- 6.38MgCha(-1)) but was significantly higher than GM
   (78.2 +/- 8.41MgCha(-1)). In dry tropical conditions, SPS displays
   enormous potential for increasing biomass and soil carbon stocks
   compared to the GM and can thus be used as a greenhouse gas mitigation
   strategy in livestock production systems.},

Abstract = {Nine fodders commonly offered to the guinea pigs by the breeders in
   Lubumbashi (Democratic Republic of Congo) were compared for chemical
   composition and for both daily dry matter intake and palatability
   indices by using 13 three-month-old guinea pigs. Four different plant
   families were provided to each guinea pig, and each animal was exposed
   to all the experimental diets studied for 8 consecutive days. The fodder
   species were three grasses: Trypsacum laxum, Panicum maximum, and
   Pennisetum purpureum; three trees or bushes Moringa oleifera, Leucaena
   leucocephala, and Bauhinia variegata; and three flowering plants Bidens
   oligoflora, Bidens pilosa, and Commelina diffusa. Dry matter content
   varied from 14 to 44/100 g FM, and CP from 13 to 28/100 g DM. B.
   variegata and P. purpureum showed the lowest CP value and L.
   leucocephala the highest. The grasses and the Commelina had higher
   levels of hemicelluloses than the tree fodders, especially P. maximum
   (45/100 g DM). High levels of K were found in the grasses and Bidens,
   and high Ca in the tree fodders and Bidens. The guinea pigs preferred,
   in a descending order, P. purpureum (0.79), B. pilosa (0.78), C. diffusa
   (0.78), T. laxum (0.77), P. maximum (0.76), B. oligoflora (0.75), M.

Abstract = {Brazilian Semiarid region is the natural environment of many herbaceous
   and shrubby plants that can be consumed by ruminants. Our objective was
   to estimate nutritional potential and CH4 production of forages from
   Brazilian Semiarid region for ruminant diets. We evaluated Manihot
   pseudoglazziovii, Mimosa caesapiniifolia, Bauhinia cheilantha, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Clitorea ternatea and Gliricidia sepium by chemical
   composition, digestibility and degradation parameters and ruminal
   fermentation. The fractionation of carbohydrates and proteins was
   performed based on the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. The
   evaluation of the degradation of organic matter and ruminal fermentation
   products was performed by the semi-automatic in vitro gas production
   technique. The ruminal degradability and intestinal digestibility of
   protein were estimated using the in vitro three stage simulation
   technique. Clitorea, followed by Leucaena, had the highest concentration
   of the fraction B2 (potentially digestible fiber) while the
   concentration did not differ (P > 0.05) between the other species. The
   fractions C were found in greater quantities (P < 0.05) in the Mimosa
   and Bauhinia species. Manihot, Gliricidia and, to a lesser extent,
   Leucaena, resulted in higher (P < 0.05) true degradation of organic
   matter (g/kg organic matter) and higher partitioning factor (ratio of
   degradability and gas production). Leucaena showed greater intestinal
   protein digestibility (g/kg dry matter), especially as a protected
   source of protein ruminal degradation and available in the intestine.
   Gliricidia, Leucaena and Manihot showed potential for reducing the
   production of enteric methane, without compromising the degradation of
   nutrients, with high digestibility and readily fermentable
   carbohydrates.},

Abstract = {There is a growing interest in converting organic wastes to charcoal for
   use as a sustainable soil amendment with a potential to improve soil
   productivity and sequester C. Three consecutive greenhouse experiments
   were conducted to investigate the effects of charcoal with different ash
   and volatile matter (VM) contents on soil properties and maize (Zea
   mays) growth and to evaluate the effect of time on charcoal performance.
   Five charcoal amendments (high-VM corncob, low-VM corncob, Kiawe,
   Binchotan, and a gasification charcoal of Leucaena leucocephala) applied
   at a 2.5\% (wt/wt) rate were compared with a zero-charcoal control with
   and without fertilization. Only the gasification charcoal significantly
   increased maize growth without fertilization. The low-VM corncob
   charcoal with fertilization significantly increased maize growth by
   164\% compared with the fertilized control in the first planting cycle.
   Maize growth in the high-VM corncob charcoal supplemented with
   fertilizer treatment was significantly lower than that of the
   fertilizer-alone treatment in the first planting cycle. The negative
   effect of the high-VM charcoal on the fertilizer was caused by
   bioavailable carbon in the charcoal, which increased soil microbial
   activity and could have caused N immobilization. Both the beneficial and
   detrimental effects of charcoal did not persist beyond the first
   planting cycle, suggesting that charcoal impacts are temporary. Whereas
   charcoal ash and VM content seem to be important parameters for
   predicting charcoal behavior in the short-term, more research is needed
   to examine a broader spectrum of feedstocks exposed to varying thermal
   treatments.},

Abstract = {Two experiments involving different browse species were carried out
   during the early dry season in an area of subhumid Nigeria with adult
   Yankasa sheep. Experiment I involved preference studies of nine browse
   species offered simultaneously in different post-harvest treatments
   (fresh, wilted or dried state). Experiment 2 determined the short-term
   intake rate of top four browse species from Experiment 1 offered in two
   forms (unchopped versus chopped) as either fresh or sun-dried material.
   In Experiment 1, fresh material was most preferred, followed by wilted
   and sun-dried material. The overall order of preference of the first
   four browse species accepted by sheep were: Cajanus cajan, Gmelina
   arborea, Leucaena leucocephala and Adenodolichos paniculatus. Based on
   mean dietary preference across the three post-harvest treatments, Khaya
   senegalensis and Gliricidia sepuim were completely rejected by sheep.
   Experiment 2 mean dry matter (DM) intake rate was highest (34 g DM/kg
   LW0.75 h(-1)) for L. leucocephala and least (6 g DM/kg LW0.75 h(-1)) for
   A. paniculatus. Fresh material was consumed more readily than dried (24
   versus 10 g DM/kg LW0.75 h(-1)). Chopping of browse species before
   offering enhanced intake by around 60\%. As the study period progressed,
   the consumption of fresh and chopped materials remained moderately
   consistent, while those of dried and unchopped materials in turn
   increased gradually. Results from Experiment 21 were in agreement with
   observations from Experiment 1, particularly in terms of order of
   preference of fresh materials. which matched animals' relative
   short-term intake. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   non-grain showed maximum production at 70 days of age, with production
   of 2333,00 and 716.60 kg DM ha(-1), respectively. The parameters of
   degradation of DM evaluated decreased significantly with the increase in
   the maturity of the plant, in the same way the chemical composition
   presented behavior inherent to the advance of age. The effective

   degradation of Leucena. The ages assessed influenced the chemical
   composition of the Leucena (P<0.05), where the levels of dry matter,

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of tree
   foliage species supplemented in ruminant diets based on Pennisetum
   purpureum on the in vitro digestibility and fermentation, microbial
   biomass synthesis and enteric methane production. Seven experimental
   diets were evaluated, including a control treatment based on P.
   purpureum (PT) grass, and six additional treatments supplemented with
   30.0\% foliage from Neomillspaughia emargiata (NE), Tabernaemontana
   amygdalifolia (TA), Caesalpinia gaumeri (CG), Piscidia piscipula (PP),
   Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Havardia albicans (HA). A randomised
   complete block design repeated in two periods (block) was used. The
   highest gas production (P<0.05) was recorded in treatments TA and PT
   (237 and 228mLg(-1), respectively). The highest in vitro digestibility
   of dry matter (IVDMD) and organic matter (IVOMD) (P<0.05) was recorded
   in the control treatment PT (57.9\% and 66.1\%, respectively).
   Treatments LL, NE, TA and PP promoted greater microbial biomass
   synthesis (290, 223, 220 and 213mgg(-1), respectively) (P<0.05). The
   proportion of propionic acid also increased in these latter treatments
   and in treatments CG and HA (P<0.05). Additionally, treatments LL, PP,
   NE and TA decreased methane production (25.8, 29.5, 30.6 and 31.8Lkg(-1)
   of digested dry matter, respectively). In conclusion, supplementation
   with L. leucocephala, P. piscipula, N. emargiata and T. amygdalifolia in
   ruminant diets based on P. purpureum is one feed alternative that can
   promote greater efficiency and synthesis of microbial biomass, increase
   the proportions of propionic and butyric acid and decrease the
   production of enteric methane by 15.6 to 31.6\%.},

Abstract = {In order to evaluate the productive response and economic viability of
   diets that included hays as alternative forage for birds in a
   semi-intensive system, a performance test was held, in which 600 Label
   Rouge birds were distributed in a completely randomized design with five
   treatments, six replications, and twenty birds per plot. The control
   diet (RCO) was based on corn grain and soybean meal and used as a
   reference for the inclusion of forage hay, 20\% by hays Silk Flower
   (Calotropis procera), Maniva Cassava (Manihot esculenta), Mata Pasto
   (Senna obtusifolia), or Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala). The average
   for RCO feed intake, RMM, RFS, RMP, and RLE were 0.1050, 0.1470, 0.0888,
   0.1411, and 0.1441 kg/bird/day, respectively, and feed prices were
   1,489, 1,209, 1,189, 1,179, and 1,249 (R\$/kg), respectively. Therefore,
   the total costs of food in the 84-day period of semi-confinement of the
   birds per ration were 1950,67, 1790,70, 1061,90, 1676,04, and 1813,60

   power with regard to cost via including hay as an alternative forage in
   diets, but after evaluating the performance in weight gain and carcass
   yield of birds, the total revenue was lower in each of the feeds with
   hay forage and thus the economic efficiency and average cost rates were
   better with the RCO feed; however, the RMM had superior profitability
   compared to other diets with hay.},

Title = {Mycorrhizal Atriplex nummularia promote revegetation and shifts
   in microbial properties in saline Brazilian soil},
Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {153},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Soil microbial attributes are the most sensitive indicators of changes
   in soil quality caused by land use. The restoration of areas with
   salinity and sodicity problems via revegetation has a significant impact
   on soil attributes. Understanding the response of microbial indicators
   is essential to maintain the bioavailability of soil organic matter and
   provides an alternative to land reclamation. Therefore, the objective of
   this study was to evaluate the efficiency of revegetation on the
   regeneration of saline soil in a Brazilian semiarid area through
   evaluating the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and
   changes in the soil microbial structure and chemical attributes. A field
   experiment was performed with a randomized block design of eight
   treatments: a control (without plant cultivation), monocultures
   (Atriplex nummularia {[}Atri], Mimosa caesalpiniifolia {[}Sab], Leucaena
   leucocephala {[}Leu], and Azadirachta indica {[}Neem]), and intercrops
   (Atri and Sab, Atri and Neem, and Atri and Leu). Soil composite samples
   were collected from each plot during the dry and rainy seasons when the
   plants had completed 24 and 30 months of growth after transplanting,
   respectively. The cultivation of the saline soil allowed an increase in
   microbial biomass carbon in both seasons. In the rainy season, the soil
   basal respiration and metabolic quotient were lower in the cultivated
   area than in the control area. Spore density and mycorrhizal
   colonization were higher in the cultivated area than in the control area
   in both seasons. We provide the first data related to the beneficial
   effects of revegetation with naturally mycorrhized plants of A.
   nummularia in monoculture or intercrop on the soil quality of a semiarid
   area.},

Title = {Predicting field performance of five irrigated tree species using

Journal = {NEW FORESTS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {309-322},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Five exotic tree species (Acacia angustissima (Mil.) Kuntze, A. mangium
   Wild, Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Alp., Leucaena hybrid (LxL), and
   Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) were investigated to determine
   whether parameters of nursery seedling stock quality could be used to
   predict their field performance in a plantation irrigated with treated
   waste-water to produce fodder and wood. Plants were grown in the nursery
   in two contrasting rooting substrates (ordinary nursery soil and sand),
   predicted to have different effects on resource allocation. Three
   categories of morphological indicators were measured, i.e., plant
   dimensions (height, diameter, root length), plant weights (shoot, root
   and whole plant weights) and indices (sturdiness quotient `SQ',
   shoot:root dry weight ratio `SRR' and Dickson's quality index `DQI'). In
   the nursery, all species performed better in the ordinary nursery soil
   for all growth parameters except root length. Thus ordinary nursery
   substrate appeared superior to sand in terms of plant quality. However,
   a follow up at plantation phase revealed that only some morphological
   attributes or ratios were suitable to predict field performance for the
   five tested species in irrigated plantation. In addition, the effect of
   the substrate observed at the nursery stage had disappeared 12 months
   after out planting due to the availability of water and nutrients
   provided by the treated waste water used for the irrigation. The results
   showed that root collar diameter and DQI appeared to be the most
   appropriate indicators to predict the outplanting performance of the
   five tested species in a short-rotation irrigated plantation in
   semi-arid Burkina Faso. The former measure is simpler and
   non-destructive.},

Abstract = {In a complete random design, 12 commercial Zebu bulls were used with
   291.00 +/- 4.00 kg of liveweight (LW) to analyze their productive
   response with the supply of an activator of the rumen fermentation in a

   divided into two groups: one consumed 1.50 kg/animal/d of supplement
   activating the rumen fermentation and the control group, 50 g of mineral
   salt/animal/d. Both grazed in 6 ha of association in 100 \% of the
   leucaena area (Leucaena leucocephala), grasses (92 \%) and weeds (8 \%),
   divided in 8 paddocks, with stocking rate of 2 animals per ha and time
   of occupation and rest of 7 and 49 d, respectively The average daily
   gain (ADG) of LW was of 0.739 and 0.776 kg, respectively, for the
   animals of the control group and for those that consumed the activator.
   There were not differences between treatments. The grazing pressure was
   of 9.50 kg of DM per each 100.00 kg of LW and the capacity of ingestion
   estimated, of 7.99 kg/animal/d. The requirements of protein were covered
   and ME was slightly under the needs. The ADG obtained in the system was
   favorable, but did not improve with the utilization of this activator of
   the rumen fermentation. Other evaluations should be developed to
   validate the use of these activators in the fattening of bulls in
   silvopasture of leucaena with the increase of the energy level of the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {33-51},
Abstract = {A longterm experiment was conducted on Alfisols at Ibadan, Nigeria, to
   assess agricultural productivity and sustainability of different farming
   systems. The experiment, conducted for a 10 year period from 1979 to
   1988, was implemented in two phases. The effects of methods of land
   clearing on crop growth-yield were evaluated during Phase I from 1979 to
   1982. Effects of different farming systems on agronomic productivity
   were evaluated in Phase II from 1983 to 1988. Six land
   clearing-cum-tillage treatments evaluated in Phase I were: (i) manual
   clearing with no-till, (ii) manual clearing with plow-till, (iii)
   shearblade clearing with no-till, (iv) treepusher/rootrake clearing with
   no-till, (v) treepusher/rootrake clearing with plow-till, and (vi)
   traditional farming. Similarly, six farming systems evaluated in Phase
   II were: (i) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala, (ii) Mucuna
   fallowing on severely degraded soils (iii) Mucuna fallowing on
   moderately degraded soil, (iv) ley farming on severely degraded soil,
   (v) ley farming on moderately degraded soil, and (vi) natural fallow
   control. In Phase I, yields of maize (Zea mays), cowpea (Vigna
   unguiculata) and cassava (Manihoc esculenta) were higher on manually
   cleared with no-till and shearblade cleared with no-fill treatments than
   on other treatments. In Phase II, maize growth was higher on plots with
   Mucuna fallowing than in alley cropping or ley farming treatments. In
   contrast, cowpea growth was higher on alley cropped plots. Regardless of
   the farming system, maize grain yield declined with the cultivation
   duration. The relative decline in cowpea grain yield with cultivation
   duration was less than that of maize.},

Abstract = {Termites are major pests of houses and buildings, and also living plants
   such as agricultural crops, trees in forests, urban areas and gardens.
   However, in Japan, the basic ecology of termites nesting in living trees
   is not fully understood. In this study, we observed 255 colonies (nests)
   of the drywood termite Neotermes sugioi, collected in the field on
   Okinawa Island, and reported the frequency composition of the
   reproductive castes, the size of wood with termite gallery, the
   population size of colonies, and the relative position of the
   reproductive and non-reproductive castes within nests. Most colonies
   were headed by a primary queen and a primary king. However, colonies
   headed only by primary queens, primary kings, or neotenic kings, each
   accounted for approximately 5\% of the colonies. A colony size of 1,000-
   4,000 individuals (2058.2 +/- 1695.0 {[}mean +/- SD]) was common and the
   average length of colony branches was less than 100 cm. Queens and kings
   were found in the same or nearby nest areas, and more predominantly in
   the central or root side of nest wood areas. The termites may experience
   colony fragmentation and reproductive loss as a consequence of typhoons.
   Incipient colonies (i.e., colonies at an early stage of development)
   were found on 11.3\% of branches of Leucaena leucocephala that did not
   show any obvious signs of infestation. In future research, it will be
   necessary to update the list of trees damaged by this termite species,
   compare the damage by tree species, and evaluate the economic impact.},

Title = {Ability of a Generalist Seed Beetle to Colonize an Exotic Host: Effects

Journal = {NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The colonization of an exotic species by native herbivores is more
   likely to occur if that herbivore is a generalist. There is little
   information on the life-history mechanisms used by native generalist
   insects to colonize exotic hosts and how these mechanisms are affected
   by host properties. We examined the ability of the generalist seed
   beetle Stator limbatus Horn to colonize an exotic species. We compared
   its host preference, acceptability, performance, and egg size when
   ovipositing and developing on two native (Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.)
   Benth and Senegalia riparia (Kunth)) and one exotic legume species
   (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.)). We also analyzed the seed chemistry. We
   found that females recognize the exotic species as an unfavorable host
   for larval development and that they delayed oviposition and laid fewer
   and larger eggs on the exotic species than on the native species.
   Survivorship on the exotic host was 0\%. Additionally, seeds of the
   native species contain five chemical compounds that are absent in the
   exotic species, and the exotic species contains three sterols, which are
   absent in the native legumes. Genetically based differences between
   beetles adapted to different hosts, plastic responses toward new hosts,
   and chemical differences among seeds are important in host colonization
   and recognition of the exotic host. In conclusion, the generalist nature
   of S. limbatus does not influence its ability to colonize L.
   leucocephala. Explanations for the colonization of exotic hosts by
   generalist native species and for the success of invasive species must
   be complemented with studies measuring local adaptation and plasticity.},

Abstract = {The benefits of the cultivation of Leucaena leucocephala in various
   farming systems are now well documented and acknowledged. However, there
   are two possible environmental hazards associated with the use of
   leucaena. These are its potential for weediness and its ability to
   increase soil acidity with consequent increase in toxic aluminium and
   manganese that could affect production and reduce the crop options for a
   site. These potential hazards are explored and discussed in this paper.
   Although the major weed concern in the past has been associated with the
   use of L. leucocephala subsp. leucocephala (the `common' type), there is
   increasing evidence that L. leucocephala subsp. glabrata and L.
   diversifolia, which are increasingly used in farming systems, also have
   invasive traits, together with spontaneous hybrids. The use of bruchid
   seed beetles could prove to be very effective in greatly reducing the
   threat of weediness. Sterile triploid hybrids may have many benefits,
   including the prevention of spread. However, methods of propagation need
   to be developed before the technology can be widely applied. Soil
   acidification associated with the growth of nodulated legumes is
   inevitable. Changes of 1 pH unit to a depth of 60-80 cm have been
   measured over a 20-25 year period under grazed leucaena pastures. The
   rate of acidification is greatest from high yielding, pure stands which
   are cut and removed from the site; where soils are lightly textured and
   of low buffering capacity, and where pH is neutral to slightly acid,
   selection of lines with low ash alkalinity and, hence, lower potential
   for soil acidification, may be possible.},

Abstract = {Translocation of endangered plant species and facilitating in situ
   regeneration require knowledge of the factors that define suitable
   habitat characteristics. Four approaches were employed to define how
   antecedent and contemporary plant identity influenced Cycas seedling
   growth and survival in Guam, Yap, and the Philippines. Cycas micronesica
   K.D. Hill or Cycas nitida K.D. Hill \& A. Lindstr. seedlings growing
   beneath the canopy of the maternal parent tree reached 100\% mortality
   in 4 to 8 year. Cycas micronesica seedlings planted beneath a
   conspecific male adult tree reached 68\% mortality in two years while
   seedlings planted away from a conspecific individual exhibited 100\%
   survival. Cycas micronesica seedlings planted beneath monostands of
   invasive Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit or Vitex parviflora Juss.
   reached 40\% mortality in two years while seedlings planted in adjacent
   native forest cover exhibited 100\% survival. Cycas micronesica
   seedlings planted in soil conditioned for 9 months by conspecifics,
   heterospecific native species, Carica papaya L., L. leucocephala, or V.
   parviflora exhibited the greatest growth in the soils conditioned by
   heterospecific natives and the least growth in the soils conditioned by
   the three invasive species. The seedlings growing in soil conditioned by
   conspecifics exhibited the most coralloid roots and the greatest
   shoot:root ratio. These studies confirmed that the identity of
   antecedent and competitive plants strongly influenced the longevity and
   growth of Cycas seedlings. Conservationists may improve outcomes by
   avoiding degraded forests that have experienced invasive plant species
   when positioning translocation projects. Planting Cycas seedlings in
   biodiverse native forest but away from a conspecific individual may lead
   to the greatest success in population recovery.},

Title = {Successful creation of seedless (sterile) leucaena germplasm developed
   from interspecific hybridisation for use as forage},
Journal = {CROP \& PASTURE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {74},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {783-796},
Abstract = {Context. The legume shrub/tree leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit.) is highly regarded as a cattle fodder, although it is considered
   an environmental weed in many parts of Australia. Aims. We investigated
   the feasibility of developing a forage variety of triploid leucaena
   through interspecific hybridisation that is sterile (without seeds) as a
   strategy to mitigate its weed risk. Methods. A conventional breeding
   strategy was used to create triploid hybrids from hand crosses between
   tetraploid and diploid species of leucaena. Molecular markers were
   developed to confirm successful crosses and flow cytometry was used to
   confirm the ploidy level. The plants are being evaluated for flowering
   behaviour, seed and herbage production across two environmentally
   diverse sites at Carnarvon and Kununurra in northern Western Australia.
   Key results. During 2018/19 and 2019/20, 2260 crosses between 45
   different combinations of diploid females by tetraploid males and their
   reciprocals have created over 3000 putative triploid hybrid plants. This
   is the first time that triploids have successfully been created in
   Australia and 10 new parental combinations were created as a world
   -first. Conclusions. A cohort of sterile triploid plants has been
   identified and selections will be made based on their edible biomass
   productivity, insect tolerance, capacity for regrowth after cutting,
   nutritive value and plant chemistry (including anti-methanogenic
   responses). A sterile leucaena variety will have application not only in
   Australian grazing systems but also in other tropical regions of the
   world. Implications. A cost-effective technology for mass vegetative
   propagation of leucaena will be required for commercialisation of a
   sterile variety.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study uses the tree stumps of the three representative trees in
   Taiwan (Leucaena leucocephala, Syzygium samarangense, and Ziziphus
   jujuba) as the material source and recyclable oyster shell powder as an
   activator. A carbonization process for upgrading and recycling the tree
   stumps was developed with our homemade, digital-controlled,
   energy-saving carbonization system. First, the tree stumps are
   carbonized at a medium temperature of 500 degrees C and then heated to
   900 degrees C for high-temperature carbonization, followed by the
   activation procedure as required. With our method, we can produce
   biochar with a high proportion of fixed carbon and a high proportion of
   meso- and macropores while maximizing the yield of wood vinegar. The
   specific surface area of the meso- and macropores can reach up to 70
   m(2)/g or more. The effect of different activation materials on the pore
   characteristics and specific surface area of biochar was carefully
   examined. It was found that both KOH and oyster shell powder is the
   ideal activator for producing biochar with a high proportion of meso-
   and macropores. The FTIR spectrum, CEC, and contents of the ordinary
   elements and heavy metals of the biochar were also reported. It is clear
   from the FTIR data that the absorption peaks of the overall spectrum of
   the three types of biochar after carbonization at high temperature are
   cleaner than those of biochar carbonized at low temperature. This
   research can promote the recycling of agricultural residues, enhance
   soil carbon sequestration, preserve fertilizers, and suppress diseases
   and pests, moving towards approaching the goal of net-zero carbon
   emissions.},

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted to find out the malic acid and fumaric acid
   content of commonly available forages for ruminants by gas
   chromatography (GC). Six samples of sixteen commonly available fodder
   crops from various places of Tamil Nadu used for feeding ruminants were
   collected, dried and stored in an airtight container for malic acid and
   fumaric acid estimation. There was no significant difference in malic
   acid and fumaric acid contents between grasses/ shrubs and tree fodders.
   Among grasses/shrubs, Medicago sativa contained higher level of malic
   acid (0.596\%) and Saccharum officinarum contained lower level of malic
   acid (0.162\%). The malic acid content of other grasses/shrubs was
   ranged from 0.217 to 0.313\%. The Moringa oleifera (0.411\%) had higher
   level of malic acid and Sesbania grandiflora (0.127\%) had lower level
   of malic acid among tree fodders. The fumaric acid content was also
   highest in Medicago sativa (0.264\%) and lowest in Pennisetum typhoides
   x Pennisetum purpureum (0.051\%) in grasses/shrubs. Among tree fodders,
   Moringa oleifera also contained the maximum percentage of fumaric acid
   (0.182\%) followed by Sesbania grandiflora (0.170\%), Azadirachta indica
   (0.132\%) and least in Leucaena leucocephala (0.062 \%) and Acacia
   nilotica (0.041\%). A trend was observed that the fumaric acid content
   was lower when compared to the malic acid content in all forages. It was
   concluded that the forages which contained higher level of malic acid
   and fumaric acid can safely be included in the ruminant ration to reduce
   methane emission and increase productivity.},

   gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN). Current screening of nutraceutical
   plants is based on in vitro evidence of anthelmintic (AH) activity
   against different life stages of GIN, but nutritional information is
   omitted or scarce. This study proposes an integral in vitro screening
   protocol to identify the nutraceutical value of the foliage from plant
   species consumed by small ruminants, using Haemonchus contortus as a
   biological model. The leaves from Acacia collinsii, A. pennatula,
   Bunchosia swartziana, Gymnopodium floribundum, Havardia albicans,
   Leucaena leucocephala, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Mimosa bahamensis,
   Piscidia piscipula, and Senegalia gaumeri were evaluated for their
   chemical composition and in vitro digestibility. Acetone:water extracts
   (70:30) from leaves of each plant were evaluated using the egg hatch
   assay and larval exsheathment inhibition assay. Respective effective
   concentrations 50\% (EC50) were determined for each assay. The ten plant
   species showed good nutritional value for ruminants, including crude
   protein (>10\%), metabolizable energy (>2.9MJ/kg DM), and varied CT
   content (from 1.0 to 37.6\%). The best AH activity against H. contortus
   eggs (EC50=401.8g/mL) and L-3 (EC50=83.1g/mL) was observed for S.
   gaumeri extract. Although all the plant species showed in vitro
   nutraceutical potential, the leaves of S. gaumeri had the best values.
   The proposed in vitro protocol showed to be useful for the integral
   assessment of the nutraceutical potential of different plant species as
   it included the nutritional value and the AH activity against eggs and
   L-3 in the selected plant species.},

   and wet seasons respectively. Those systems with Tifton grass, Tanzania
   grass and Leucaena plants showed a higher number of individuals in both
   periods. The fire which occurred in the Andropogon grass before the
   first harvest resulted in a reduction in the amount and diversity of the
   soil fauna. The highest values for wealth, diversity and uniformity of
   fauna, were obtained from samples collected during the wet season. The
   forest presented a greater diversity and balance for both periods
   assessed. In a situation of water-stress, some groups, such as
   Collembola and Formicidae, predominated in the management systems,
   decreasing uniformity, while in the wet season, several groups were well
   represented, favouring uniformity. Principal-component multivariate
   analysis showed that systems of forest, Tifton grass, Tanzania grass and
   Leucaena plants were associated with several groups of soil fauna in the
   two periods evaluated, while the system of Andropogon grass, which
   suffered a fire, showed an affinity only with the Hepteroptera group
   during the dry season.},

Abstract = {The effects of various fallow management systems and cropping
   intensities on water infiltration were measured on an Alfisol at Ibadan
   in southwestern Nigeria. The objective was to determine the influence of
   the land use systems (a combination of crop-fallow sequences and
   intercropping types) on soil hydraulic properties obtained by disc
   permeameter and double-ring infiltration measurements. The experiment
   was established in 1989 as a split-plot design with four replications.
   The main plots were natural fallow, planted Pueraria phaseoloides and
   planted Leucaena leucocephala. The subplots were 1 year of maize/cassava
   intercrop followed by 3-year fallow (25\% cropping intensity), or 2-year
   fallow (33\% cropping intensity), or 1-year fallow (50\% cropping
   intensity), or no fallow period (100\% cropping intensity). Water
   infiltration rates and sorptivities were measured under saturated and
   unsaturated flow. Irrespective of land use, infiltration rates at the
   soil surface (121-324 cm h(-1)) were greater than those measured at 30
   cm depth (55-144 cm h(-1)). This indicated that fewer large pores were
   present below 30 cm depth compared with 0-30 cm, depth. Despite some
   temporal variation, sorptivities with the highest mean value of 93.5 cm
   h(-1/2) increased as the cropping intensity decreased, suggesting a more
   continuous macropore system under less intensive land use systems. This
   was most likely due to continuous biopores created by perennial
   vegetation under long fallow systems. Intercropped maize and cassava
   yields also increased as cropping intensity decreased. The weak
   relationship between crop yields and hydraulic conductivity/infiltration
   rates suggests that the rates were not limiting.},

Abstract = {The influence of weeds on maize intercropped with cassava was evaluated
   in three fallow management systems and four cropping frequencies from
   1989 to 1996 in Ibadan, Nigeria, West Africa. Fallow management systems
   consisted of natural bush, Leucaena leucocephala hedgerows and Pueraria
   phaseoloides fallow. Frequencies of cropping were continuous cropping, 1
   cropping year alternating with 1, 2 and 3 years of uncropped fallow.
   Shrubs and climbers contributed 60-70\% and herbs (predominantly weeds)
   30-40\% to the total dry matter produced in all treatments. Weed dry
   matter and seedbank increased with time in all treatments but was higher
   in natural bush fallow by the fifth and sixth years and in continuously
   cropped plots. Weed seed density increased with time in the continuously
   cropped plots and in plots cropped after 1 or 2 years of fallow but
   decreased with time when the fallow period was up to 3 years. Maize
   grain yield decreased over time in both unweeded and weeded plots
   irrespective of treatment with the exception of the weeded P.
   phaseoloides fallow treatment. Cassava tuber yield decreased over time
   in unweeded plots in all treatments while tuber yield increased in
   weeded P. phaseoloides fallow treatment and remained relatively constant
   in L. leucocephala and natural bush fallow plots. The results from this
   study suggest that planted fallow involving legume species is more
   effective in weed management in the long term than natural fallow.
   Fallow period was beneficial to crop yield and yield improvement
   increased with the length of the fallow cycle, particularly for cassava.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to compare the carbon (C) mineralization
   kinetics of three biochars (Formosan ash (Fraxinus formosana Hayata),
   ash biochar; Makino bamboo (Phyllostachys makino Hayata), bamboo
   biochar; and lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de. Wit), lead tree
   biochar) applied with two addition rates (2 and 5 wt \%) in three
   excessive compost-fertilized (5 wt \%) soils (one Oxisols and two
   Inceptisols), and to ascertain the increasing or decreasing effect of
   biochar and soil type in the presence of excessive compost. The study
   results of 400 days incubation indicated that, in general, the potential
   of the three biochars for C sequestration is similar in the three
   studied soils. The presence of excessive compost stimulated the
   co-mineralization of the more labile components of biochar over the
   short term (first two months). The potential of biochar addition for
   neutralizing soil pH and regulating the release of Al from soil for
   preserving soil organic carbon (SOC) might be the important mechanisms
   in biochar-compost interactions, especially in the presence of excessive
   compost. Overall, 5\% application rate of three high
   temperature-pyrolysis biochars showed the less detriments to studied
   soils. In these incubations of biochar, excessive compost, and soil, it
   is a decreasing effect overall, that is, the enhanced storage of both
   biochar-C and SOC, which is expected as a long-term carbon sequestration
   in soil. The recorded direction and magnitude of effect, both are
   strongly influenced by biochar and soil type. When co-applied with
   excessive compost, the negative (reducing CO2 release) effect with
   increasing biochar application rates was eliminated.},

Title = {Identifying potential distributions of 10 invasive alien trees:
   implications for conservation management of protected areas},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {190},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tree invasion has the potential to negatively affect biodiversity and
   ecosystems, with invasive alien trees (IATs) expanding widely in
   protected areas (PAs) across different habitats. Thus, the effectiveness
   of PAs might be reduced. Investigation of the distributions of IAT is
   urgently required to improve the effective conservation management of
   PAs. We projected the potential distributions of 10 IATs, which included
   Acacia mearnsii, Ardisia elliptica, Cecropia peltata, Cinchona
   pubescens, Leucaena leucocephala, Melaleuca quinquenervia, Miconia
   calvescens, Morella faya, Prosopis glandulosa, and Spathodea
   campanulata, that have a serious influence on global biodiversity and
   assessed the distribution possibilities of these IATs in PAs based on
   the PA categories of the International Union for Conservation of Nature
   (IUCN). The overall potential distributions of these 10 IATs included
   Latin America, central and southern Africa, southeastern Asia, eastern
   Australia and New Zealand, and western Europe. Annual mean temperature,
   temperature seasonality, annual precipitation, and soil bulk density
   were found to be important environmental variables for the potential
   distributions of these IATs. Overall, A. mearnsii, A. elliptica, C.
   peltata, L. leucocephala, M. quinquenervia, M. calvescens, and S.
   campanulata were distributed mainly in the IUCN PA categories of
   national parks and PAs with sustainable use of natural resources. We
   proposed the following for conservation management of PAs: (1)
   completion of species inventories for PAs, (2) better understanding of
   factors driving invasions in PAs, (3) assessment of the efficiency of
   management within particular PAs, and (4) evaluation of changes in
   trends regarding plant invasions in PAs under climate change conditions.},

Abstract = {Three novel strains, RITF741(T), RITF1220 and RITF909, isolated from
   root nodules of Acacia melanoxylon in Guangdong Province of China, have
   been previously identified as members of the genus Mesorhizobium,
   displaying the same 16S rRNA gene RFLP pattern. Phylogenetic analysis of
   16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the three strains belong to the
   genus Mesorhizobium and had highest similarity (100.0 \%) to
   Mesorhizobium plurifarium LMG 11892(T). Phylogenetic analyses of
   housekeeping genes recA, atpD and glnII revealed that these strains
   represented a distinct evolutionary lineage within the genus
   Mesorhizobium. Strain RITF741(T) showed >73 \% DNA-DNA relatedness with
   strains RITF1220 and RITF909, but <60 \% DNA-DNA relatedness with the
   closest type strains of recognized species of the genus Mesorhizobium.
   They differed from each other and from their closest phylogenetic
   neighbours by presence/absence of several fatty acids, or by large
   differences in the relative amounts of particular fatty acids. While
   showing distinctive features, they were generally able to utilize a wide
   range of substrates as sole carbon sources based on API 50CH and API
   20NE tests. The three strains were able to form nodules with the
   original host Acacia melanoxylon and other woody legumes such as Acacia
   aneura, Albizia falcataria and Leucaena leucocephala. In conclusion,
   these strains represent a novel species belonging to the genus
   Mesorhizobium based on the data obtained in the present and previous
   studies, for which the name Mesorhizobium acaciae sp. nov. is proposed.
   The type strain is RITF741(T) (=CCBAU 101000(T)=JCM 30534(T)), the DNA
   G+C content of which is 64.1 mol\% (T-m).},

Abstract = {Emissions of N2O were measured following addition of 15N-labelled
   residues of tropical plant species {[}Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), Mucuna
   pruriens and Leucaena leucocephala] to a Ferric Luvisol from Ghana at a
   rate of 100 mg N/kg soil under controlled environment conditions.
   Residues were also applied in different ratio combinations with
   inorganic N fertilizer, at a total rate of 100 mg N/kg soil. N2O
   emissions were increased after addition of residues, and further
   increased with combined (ratio) applications of residues and inorganic N
   fertilizer. However, 15N-N2O production was low and short-lived in all
   treatments, suggesting that most of the measured N2O-N was derived from
   the applied fertilizer or native soil mineral N pools. There was no
   consistent trend in magnitude of emissions with increasing proportion of
   inorganic fertilizer in the application. The positive interactive effect
   between residue- and fertilizer-N sources was most pronounced in the
   25:75 Leucaena:fertilizer and cowpea:fertilizer treatments where 1082
   and 1130 mg N2O-N/g residue were emitted over 30 days. N2O (log(e))
   emission from all residue amended treatments was positively correlated
   with the residue C:N ratio, and negatively correlated with residue
   polyphenol content, polyphenol:N ratio and (lignin + polyphenol):N
   ratio, indicating the role of residue chemical composition in regulating
   emissions even when combined with inorganic fertilizer. The positive
   interactive effect in our treatments suggests that it is unlikely that
   combined applications of residues and inorganic fertilizer can lower N2O
   emissions unless the residue is of very low quality promoting strong
   immobilisation of soil mineral N.},

Volume = {62},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1160-1172},
Abstract = {This review provides examples of the utilisation of plant bioactivity to
   mitigate enteric methane (CH4) emissions from the Australian ruminant
   production systems. Potential plant-based mitigation strategies that
   reduce CH4 without major impacts on forage digestibility include the
   following: (i) low methanogenic tropical and temperate grass, legume and
   shrub forage species, which offer renewable and sustainable solutions
   and are easy to adopt, but may have restricted geographical distribution
   or relatively high costs of establishment and maintenance; (ii)
   plant-based agricultural by-products including grape marc, olive leaves
   and fruit, and distiller's grains that can mitigate CH4 and provide
   relatively cheap high-nutrient supplements, while offsetting the impact
   of agricultural waste, but their use may be limited due to unfavourable
   characteristics such as high protein and water content or cost of
   transport; (iii) plant extracts, essential oils and pure compounds that
   are abundant in Australian flora and offer exciting opportunities on the
   basis of in vitro findings, but require verification in ruminant
   production systems. The greatest CH4 mitigation potential based on in
   vitro assays come from the Australian shrubs Eremophila species,
   Jasminum didymium and Lotus australis (>80\% CH4 reduction), tropical
   forages Desmanthus leptophyllus, Hetropogon contortus and Leucaena
   leucocephala (similar to 40\% CH4 reduction), temperate forages
   Biserrula pelecinus (70-90\% CH4 reduction), perennial ryegrass and
   white clover (similar to 20\% CH4 reduction), and plant extracts or
   essential oils from Melaleuca ericifolia, B. pelecinus and Leptospermum
   petersonii (up to 80\% CH4 reduction). Further research is required to
   confirm effectiveness of these plant-based strategies in vivo, determine
   optimal doses, practical modes of delivery to livestock, analyse
   benefit-cost ratios and develop pathways to adoption.},

Abstract = {A survey on toxic plants for ruminants and equidae was performed on the
   municipalities of Juazeiro do Norte, Crato, Barbalha, and Missao Velha
   on the Ceara state, Northeastern Brazil. Twenty one interviews were
   realized with farmers, veterinary practitioners, agronomists and
   agriculture technicians. Poisonings by Ipomoea asarifolia mentioned in
   38\% and 19\% interviews as toxic for bovines and sheep, respectively,
   and Enterolobium contotisiliquum, mentioned as toxic for cattle (47.6\%
   of the interviews) and sheep (4.7\%), were more frequent. Also occur in
   the region poisonings by Mascagnia rigida (38\% of the interviews),
   Anadenanthera colubrina var. cebil (=A. macrocarpa) (14\%), Ricinus
   communis (14\%), Thiloa glaucocarpa (9\%), and Sorghum halepense (4\%)
   in cattle, Mimosa tenuiflora in cattle, sheep, and goats (38\%),
   Brachiaria decumbens in sheep and cattle (38\%), Manihot spp. in cattle
   and goats (28\%), and Leucaena leucocephala in sheep and horses (4\%).
   Several plants previously unknown as toxic, but mentioned by the
   respondents as poisonous, were given to experimental animals at
   different doses. Only Casearia commersoniana was toxic to goats at the
   daily doses of 20g kg(-1) body weight during 2-4 days. Clinical signs,
   similar to those reported by the farmers, were stiffness, mild bloat,
   polaquiuria, vocalization, jugular engorgement and pulsation, swaying
   gait, falling, spasticity, paddling movements, opisthotonos, and
   tachyicardia and dyspnea followed by bradycardia and bradypnea. Deaths
   occurred 6 and 19 hours after first clinical signs. No significant gross
   or histologic lesions were observed. It is concluded that poisonings by
   plants are important cause of losses in the region, which has a
   population of 53,473 bovines, 4,799 goats, 9,149 sheep, and 7,060
   equidae.},

Abstract = {The intensification of beef cattle production in dryland areas of East
   Indonesia has the potential to substantially raise the incomes of
   smallholder farmers that dominate the sector. In this study we assess
   the potential for intensifying beef production on Sumbawa Island, by
   introducing a household feedlot production system (2-20 animals) based
   on the Leucaena leucocephala (leucanea) tree legume as an improved
   source of feed. We used a system dynamics approach to model the entire
   value chain, accounting for herd dynamics, demand dynamics and
   seasonality. Our findings complement the growing body of biophysical
   evidence about the potential success of this intervention, by simulating
   improvements in the annual profitability for beef farmers in the project
   area of up to 415\% by 2023. Increases in farm profit were shown to
   depend near equally on the higher productivity of the leucaena feeding
   system and an associated price premium, demonstrating the importance of
   supporting improved agricultural production with better marketing
   practices. The intervention was also shown to generate positive or
   neutral benefits for the main post-farm value chain actors. Importantly,
   it also reduced the GHG emission intensity of outputs from the beef herd
   by 16\% by 2020. We explored number of scale-out pathways, including a
   relatively moderate pace of autonomous adoption for our main analysis,
   resulting in the accumulation of 3,444 hectares of leucaena 20-years
   after the initial project phase, which could sustain the fattening of
   37,124 male cattle per year. More ambitious rates of scale-out were
   found to be possible without exceeding the animal and land resources of
   the island.},

Abstract = {A study was conducted at a farm near Colima, Mexico, to evaluate the
   reproductive performance of 60 hair sheep and 30 F1 crossbreds
   (Rambouillet or Dorset X Rambouillet) with progesterone and gonadotropin
   treatments. Sheep gazing was supplemented with a protein bank of
   Leucaena leucocephala. Ewes were supplied with a concentrate of 3 Mcal
   ME/kg and 18\% CP 1 month before and 1 month after lambing. Oestrus
   synchronization or induction was performed with progesterone and
   gonadotropins. Females were bred 48-69 h after sponge retrieval. Of the
   treated sheep 97\% showed oestrus. Average fertility was 66\%.
   Seasonally low lambing rate was from March to July in the absence of
   hormone treatments. Hormone treated sheep (hair sheep and crossbreds)
   showed increased (P < 0.01) fertility in 8 out of 12 months. Higher
   difference in fertility was due to treatment in January to May.
   Fertility was highest from June to December. Overall prolificacy of
   treated ewes was 1.93 +/- 0.32 versus 1.79 +/- 0.21 for controls.
   Hormone treated ewes had a greater percentage of twins, triplets and
   quadruplets than controls. Overall yield of lambs from treated ewes was
   29.86 kg per year compared to 19.99 kg for controls, however since
   controls had more single lambs, overall birth weight was in favour of
   controls (2.20 versus 1.85). It is concluded that crosses of Rambouillet
   or Rambouillet X Dorset males with Pelibuey and Barbados Blackbelly hair
   ewes increased lamb crop, birth weight, and number of parturitions per
   ewe per year under tropical conditions in Mexico. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {Confined West African Dwarf sheep and goats were offered chopped fresh
   Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham (leucaena) leaves at levels of 0,
   20, 40, 60 and 80\% in a diet with chopped fresh Panicum maximum (guinea
   grass) over a period of 16 weeks to measure intake, apparent
   digestibility and growth.  Leucaena forage depressed intake of feed by
   both species, and goats consumed less than sheep.  Dry matter intake was
   39.6, 35.1, 33.9, 33.7 and 27.0 g/kg0.75 for goats on 0, 20, 40, 60 and
   80\% leucaena diets, respectively.  The corresponding values for sheep
   up to the 60\% diet were 69.3, 67.3, 64.8 and 58.4 g/kg0.75.  At six
   weeks, the health of sheep on the 80\% leucaena diet deteriorated
   seriously and they were removed from the treatment.  The overall growth
   rate improved by up to 40\% for sheep (59.3 g/day) on addition of
   leucaena to the diet and 60\% for goats (33.1 g/day).  Sheep grew faster
   than goats (53.4 vs. 28.4 g/day).  Dry matter (DM) digestibility of the
   diet rose with increasing level of leucaena and goats digested DM more
   extensively than sheep (61.8 vs. 56.1\%).  Digestibility of other feed
   components followed the same pattern as that of DM.  It is suggested
   that to promote growth without adverse effects, leucaena should not
   comprise more than 40\% and 60\% of the diets of West African Dwarf
   sheep and goats, respectively, or less than 1.0 g mimosine/kg0.75.},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted in a wet tropical environment (Ciawi,
   West java, Indonesia) to assess the forage yields of mixtures of
   leucaena and grasses over a 1 year period in Plots which had been
   established 2 years earlier. The tree legume Leucaena leucocephala cv.
   Cunningham (plant density 1 m x 0.5 m), cut at either 30 cm or 100 cm,
   was interplanted with either a short grass (Setaria sphacelata var.
   splendida) or a tall grass (Pennisetum purpureum). Mineral nutrients
   were non-limiting.
   Highest leaf production was in the setaria monoculture (20.8 t ha-1
   yr-1) and the low-cut leucaena/setaria mixture (18.5 t ha-1 yr-1), with
   the grass dominating production (> 88\%) in the latter because of the
   ability of setaria to gain preferential access to light penetrating
   between the rows of leucaena early in each growth period. Leucaena shoot
   production in the low-cut leucaena treatments was reduced from a mean of
   8.8 t ha-1 yr-1 in the monocultures to 1.5 t ha-1 yr-1 in the mixtures.
   For the high-cut leucaena treatments, grass leaf yields were lower from
   the mixtures than from the monocultures but leucaena shoot yields were
   only reduced from monoculture yields in the mixture with pennisetum.
   The mixture of setaria and high-cut leucaena produced a considerable
   yield of setaria leaf (6.2 t ha-1 yr-1) with no reduction in leucaena
   leaf yields and intercepted a significantly greater percentage of total
   incident light (64\%) than the other three mixtures (42-52\%).},

Abstract = {The main task was to evaluate the effect of tree foliage species
   supplemented in cattle balanced diets on the in vitro fermentation and
   digestibility, synthesis of microbial biomass and methane (CH4)
   production. The experimental diets were isoenergetic and isoproteic
   balanced and formulated to meet the requirements of growing cattle (250
   kg BW). Seven treatments were tested: control treatment (CT1) with the
   grassPennisetum purpureumand six additional treatments substitutingP.
   purpureum(30\% of DM) with foliage ofNeomillspaughia

   andHavardia albicans(HA7). A randomised complete block design with
   blocks repeated over time was implemented. The highest gas production (P
   < 0.05) was found in CT1 and TA3 (244.10 and 235.13 mL g(-1),
   respectively). The highest in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and
   in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) (P < 0.05) were in CT1,
   TA3 and LL6 (IVDMD = 56.33\%, 56.85\% and 56.08\%; IVOMD = 62.41\%,
   66.86\% and 64.38\%, respectively). Synthesis of microbial biomass and
   volatile fatty acid concentration was similar among tree foliage
   supplementation and CT1, and the lowest CH(4)production (P < 0.05) was
   found in LL6 (35.94 L kg(-1)of digested dry matter). It is concluded
   that the supplementation withT. amygdalifolia,P. piscipulaandL.

Journal = {TREE GENETICS \& GENOMES},
Year = {2018},

Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cellulose synthase (CesA) plays a major regulatory role in the cellulose
   synthesis pathway in plants and is an important factor in controlling
   wood fiber quality and yield. In this study, two cellulose synthase
   genes, AmCesA1 and AmCesA2, were cloned from Acacia mangium using
   transcriptome de novo sequencing analysis and RACE. In silico analysis
   revealed that AmCesA1 cDNA was 3793bp in size, had a 3249bp ORF, and
   encoded a 1082 amino acid protein; AmCesA2 cDNA was 3743bp in size, had
   a 3228bp ORF, and encoded a 1075 amino acid protein. AmCesA1 was
   determined to have six transmembrane regions, and AmCesA2 was determined
   to have eight transmembrane regions. Cluster analysis showed that
   AmCesA1 had high degrees of similarity with Glycine max GmCesA1 and
   Arachis duranensis AdCesA1. AmCesA2 had high degrees of similarity with
   Leucaena leucocephala LlCesA7 and LlCesA8. Southern blot analysis showed
   that multiple copies of AmCesA1 were present in the Acacia mangium
   genome, but only a single copy of AmCesA2 was present. Real-time RT-PCR
   showed that both genes were widely expressed in roots, stems, and
   leaves, but AmCesA2 was more highly expressed in stems. The two genes
   responded to GA(3), 6-BA, and MeJA treatments, and the response to GA(3)
   was relatively strong. Here, we presume that the two genes are involved
   in the formation of primary cell walls and that AmCesA2 is also involved
   in the formation of secondary cell walls. The expression of both genes
   was upregulated under different hormone treatments, which indicated that
   the two genes positively regulate the hormone response.},

Abstract = {Methane emissions from ruminant livestock represent a loss of carbon
   during feed conversion, which has implications for both animal
   productivity and the environment because this gas is considered to be
   one of the more potent forms of greenhouses gases contributing to global
   warming. Many strategies to reduce emissions are targeting the
   methanogens that inhabit the rumen, but such an approach can only be
   successful if it targets all the major groups of ruminant methanogens.
   Therefore, a thorough knowledge of the diversity of these microbes in
   different breeds of cattle and sheep, as well as in response to
   different diets, is required. A study was undertaken using the molecular
   techniques denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, DNA cloning and DNA
   sequence analysis to define the extent of diversity among methanogens in
   ruminants, particularly Bos indicus cross cattle, on differing forages
   in Queensland. It was found that the diversity of methanogens in
   forage-fed cattle in Queensland was greater than in grain-fed cattle but
   there was little variability in methanogen community composition between
   cattle fed different forages. The species that dominate the rumen
   microbial communities of B. indicus cross cattle are from the genus
   Methanobrevibacter, although rumen-fluid inoculated digestors fed
   Leucaena leucocephala leaf were populated with Methanosphaera-like
   strains, with the Methanobrevibacter-like strains displaced. If ruminant
   methane emissions are to be reduced, then antimethanogen bioactives that
   target both broad groups of ruminant methanogens are most likely to be
   needed, and as a part of an integrated suite of approaches that redirect
   rumen fermentation towards other more useful end products.},

Abstract = {Residues of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (L), Senna siamea (S) and
   maize stover (M) were tested to evaluate their effect on soil organic
   matter accumulation and composition under sub-humid tropical conditions.
   On an Imperata cylindrica (I) dominated grass fallow, a total amount of
   30 Mg ha(-1) DM were applied within 18 months. Two months after the last
   application, changes in the light and heavy soil organic carbon fraction
   (LF and HF) and in the total soil organic carbon content (LF + HF) in
   the topsoil were observed. All organic materials increased the
   proportion of the LF fraction in the soil significantly. The increase in
   HF was 39 to 51\% of the increase in total organic carbon, depending on
   the source of the organic material. The potential of the tested organic
   materials to increase total soil organic carbon content (including all
   soil organic carbon fractions) was in the order L > S > M > I, whereas
   the order of increase of the HF fraction was L = S > I > M. Cation
   exchange capacity of the newly formed heavy soil organic carbon was
   highest with L and lowest with M. Ranking of the transformation
   efficiency of applied plant residues into the heavy soil organic carbon
   fraction was I > L = S > M. Transformation efficiency of the residues
   could neither be explained by lignin nor lignin/N ratio, but rather by
   extractable polyphenols (Folin-Denis extraction). The results show that
   accumulation of the HF fraction in tropical soils is feasible through
   the application of large quantities of plant residues, but depends
   strongly on the composition of the applied materials.},

Abstract = {The beneficial effects of planting mixtures comprising of fly ash at the
   rate of 66\%, 33\% and 17\% by soil volume were assessed for the early
   growth of two economic tree species, teak (Tectona grandis) and leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala) in rainfed Semi-Arid Tropical (SAT) Alfisols in
   India. Measurements of tree growth were made at six monthly intervals
   over a 3-year period. Fly ash at 66\% by soil volume of the planting pit
   significantly increased the diameter of teak at breast height (dbh). In
   leucaena, application of fly ash at 17\% by soil volume was found to be
   effective in increasing dbh during most of the study period. Changes in
   soil physicochemical properties (bulk density, water retention at 0.033
   and 1.5 MPa, profile moisture content, pH, soluble salt content and
   organic carbon) were simultaneously studied. Among these soil
   properties, plant available water (PAW) and organic carbon (OC) contents
   explained variations in diameter at breast height (dbh) in teak during
   most of the sampling period, while none of the soil properties
   significantly explained dbh in leucaena. The highest dose of fly ash
   applied (66\% by volume) decreased bulk density (BD) and increased PAW
   in teak and to an extent in leucaena during the first 2 years of tree
   growth. Higher profile moisture content was noted in pits treated with
   66\% fly ash during the dry period of November (after the end of
   seasonal rainfall which occurred from June to October) during the first
   and second year after application.},

   that AS, LL and AH diets decreased (P < 0.05) gas, CH4 and total
   protozoa compared to BH. Both AS and LL diets increased (P < 0.05)
   ruminal propionate and partitioning factor, while decreased, ammonia-N
   (NH3-N) concentrations, acetate, acetate/propionate ratio and protozoa
   count compared to the BH diet. In Experiment 2, the LL diet decreased (P
   < 0.05) dry matter intake and digestibility of crude protein compared
   with the BH diet. Rams fed both AS and LL diets showed greater (P <
   0.05) fecal N and retained N, while decreased (P < 0.01) urinary N
   excretion and exhibited 11.45 \% reductions in CH4 production. In
   conclusion, the partial replacement of BH with AS reduced N losses and
   CH4 emissions without negative effects on ruminal fermentation.},

Title = {Determinants of tree species preference for foraging by insectivorous

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {22},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The foliage palatability hypothesis predicts that avian insectivores
   will preferentially forage in tree species with the greatest abundance
   of their arthropod prey, which in turn are associated with the tree's
   foliage nutrition and palatability. We tested this hypothesis in a novel
   Prosopis-Leucaena woodland in Puerto Rico by determining foraging
   preferences of five insectivorous bird species for six tree species
   (five alien, one native) and relating preferences to foliage arthropod
   biomass and leaf chemistry. The most frequently preferred tree species
   for foraging were the alien Prosopis juliflora (preferred by five bird
   species) and Pithecellobium dulce (preferred by four bird species). Both
   species had high foliage arthropod biomass, high N content, low lignin/N
   ratios, and low hemicellulose content. Compounds, previously known to
   affect herbivore responses to Albizia lebbeck and Leucaena leucocephala,
   may explain low arthropod biomass despite high N content in Albizia and
   avoidance of Leucaena by four bird species despite its high arthropod
   biomass. The native Bucida buceras had tough leaves with low N content,
   low arthropod biomass, and only one bird species showed a weak
   preference for foraging in it. Biomass of predaceous arthropods showed
   strong negative correlations with the ratios of lignin/N and
   hemicellulose/N. Some alien tree species had highly palatable foliage
   with high arthropod biomass and hence were preferred for foraging by
   avian insectivores as predicted by the foliage palatability hypothesis.
   High foliage palatability of some alien tree species may weaken the
   effect of enemy release in some novel plant communities.},

Title = {Earthworm cast production and physico-chemical properties in two

Abstract = {Earthworm casts are known to contribute significantly to surface soil
   fertility in agroecosystems. Knowledge of their role in maintaining soil
   fertility is of primary importance in keeping a healthy soil ecosystem.
   Thus physicochemical properties of earthworm casts and their production
   rate were studied for a period of three years (2002 to 2004) in two
   agroforestry sites, Sakawrtuichhun (SKT) and Pachhunga University
   College (PUC), in the state of Mizoram in northeast India. Plants
   including Leucaena leucocephala, pineapple (Ananas comosus) and
   manadarin orange (Citrus reticulata) were present in both sites.
   Sampling of earthworm casts was done on the basis of occurrence of fresh
   worm casts. Four species of earthworms, viz. Metaphire houlleti,
   Perionyx excavatus, Eutyphoeus mizoramensis and Drawida sp., were common
   to both study sites, whereas Perionyx macintoshi was recorded only at
   PUC. Earthworm casts were mainly produced from June to September.
   Maximum cast production was recorded in October 2002 at SKT and July
   2003 at PUC. Annual cast production declined from the first year to the
   third year by 18 \% and 25.5 \% at SKT and PUC, respectively. This may
   be attributed to a decrease in population and food supply clue to local
   weeding practices. Among the physico-chemical parameters studied, only
   phosphorus levels showed significant correlation with worm cast
   production. Potassium showed the highest degree of difference between
   worm casts and its adjacent soil, while nitrogen showed the least
   difference. Our results show that worm cast production coincides with
   the rainy season and earthworm cast contains higher levels of inorganic
   nutrient compared to adjacent soil.},

Abstract = {Tanniferous forages may have bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal effect
   on different rumen microbial populations. We investigated the influence
   of the tropical tanniferous plants Styzolobium aterrimum (STA),
   Styzolobium deeringianum (STD), Leucaena leucocephala (LEU), and Mimosa
   caesalpiniaefolia (MIC) containing 20, 64, 56, and 105 g condensed
   tannis (CT)/kg dry matter (DM) and Cynodon spp. cv. Tifton 85 (CYN) as
   control on Fibrobacter succinogenes and methanogenic microbes in rumen
   liquor from sheep using the in vitro gas production technique (Hohenheim
   gas test). The relative gene expression of F. succinogenes at t(1/2)
   (time point when 50\% of the maximal gas production has been reached)
   analyzed by quantitative PCR was 0.20- and 0.28-fold lower than the
   control when LEU and STA was applied and 0.91- and 0.85-fold lower with
   MIC and STD. Methanogenic population was 0.29- and 0.58-fold reduced
   with STA and LEU compared to the control, but 5.50- and 1.43- fold
   higher with MIC and STD. At 24 h, F. succinogenes was reduced for all
   legumes as well as methanogenic bacteria, except for MIC which increased
   4.15-fold. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the
   methanogenic community resulted in different band patterns: CYN
   presented some strong bands, which became weaker in the analyzed
   treatments. Some bands appeared weaker, especially in MIC and STD, but
   not in STA and LEU. MIC seemed to increase the total number of weak
   bands. Overall, the tannin-rich plants negatively affected the F.
   succinogenes population and caused changes in the structure of the
   methanogenic community.},

Abstract = {The symbiosis island of Mesorhizobium loti strain R7A contains genes
   with strong similarity to the structural vir genes (virB1-11; virD4) of
   Agrobacterium tumefaciens that encode the type IV secretion system
   (T4SS) required for T-DNA transfer to plants. In contrast, M. loti
   strain MAFF303099 lacks these genes but contains genes not present in
   strain R7A that encode a type III secretion system (T3SS). Here we show
   by hybridization analysis that most M. loti strains contain the VirB/D4
   T4SS and not the T3SS. Strikingly, strain R7A vir gene mutants formed
   large nodules containing bacteroids on Leucaena leucocephala in contrast
   to the wild-type strain that formed only uninfected tumour-like
   structures. A rhcJ T3SS mutant of strain MAFF303099 also nodulated L.
   leucocephala, unlike the wild type. On Lotus corniculatus, the vir
   mutants were delayed in nodulation and were less competitive compared
   with the wild type. Two strain R7A genes, msi059 and msi061, were
   identified through their mutant phenotypes as possibly encoding
   translocated effector proteins. Both Msi059 and Msi061 were translocated
   through the A. tumefaciens VirB/D4 system into Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   and Arabidopsis thaliana, as shown using the Cre recombinase Reporter
   Assay for Translocation (CRAfT). Taken together, these results suggest
   that the VirB/D4 T4SS of M. loti R7A plays an analogous symbiotic role
   to that of T3SS found in other rhizobia. The heterologous translocation
   of rhizobial proteins by the Agrobacterium VirB/D4 T4SS is the first
   demonstration that rhizobial effector proteins are translocated into
   plant cells and confirms functional conservation between the M. loti and
   A. tumefaciens T4SS.},

Abstract = {The use of trees and herbaceous cover crops for weed management in
   smallholder farms is a promising alternative to the unsustainable
   traditional shifting cultivation system. The reported experiment was
   conducted from 1993 to 1996 in fallow plots established in 1989 to
   rehabilitate a degraded Alfisol after 10 years of continuous cultivation
   of maize/cassava. Treatments consisted of four plots each of woody
   legume species (Acacia auriculiformis, A. leptocarpa, Leucaena
   leucocephala, and Senna siamea), and a herbaceous legume cover crop
   (Pueraria phaseoloides). Two controls (natural bush fallow and
   continuous maize/cassava) were included. Each treatment was cleared and
   cultivated in 1993 and 1995 (after 4 and 6 year fallow). Cultivation was
   repeated in 1994 for plots cleared in 1993 and in 1996 for subplots
   cleared in 1995. In all the years, weed density and dry weight was lower
   in planted fallows than in the controls. Per capita weed population
   growth rate decreased in all the fallow treatments most notably in A.
   auriculiformis and S. siamea fallow. All fallow species except A.
   auriculiformis would require more than 6 years of fallow to prevent
   growth of the weed population over the long term. The weed seed bank was
   75\% lower in A. auriculiformis and P. phaseoloides fallow than the
   control plots. Canonical correspondence and redundancy analysis
   indicated differences in species composition between treatments in the
   aboveground weed flora and in the weed seed bank. Cynodon dactylon and
   Digitaria horizontalis dominated continuously cultivated maize/cassava
   plots. Chromolaena odorata occurred more in natural bush fallow. In
   contrast, annual broadleaf weeds dominated the planted fallow

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Decomposition and N release patterns from prunings of eight tree species
   were studied under field conditions. Leaves and stems (<1 cm diam) from
   4-yr-old hedgerows were sealed in separate litter bags and placed on
   soil surface at Low and high elevation (1150 m) sites in Haiti. Leaves
   decomposed faster than stems and leaf decomposition was described by a
   two-pool exponential model. At the low elevation, leaf C loss was
   highest (82\%) in gliricidia {[}Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex
   Walp.] and lowest (42\%) in flamboyant {[}Delonix regia (Bojer ex Hook)
   Raf.] after 48 wk. At the high elevation, leaf C loss after 48 wk was
   48\% in leucaena {[}Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit] and 29\% in
   Acacia angustissima (Mill.) Kuntze. Initial N concentrations correlated
   with leaf C loss (Phase I) at low elevation while C:N and lignin:N
   correlated with leaf C loss (Phase II) at low and high elevations,
   respectively. Nitrogen release resembled carbon loss. At the low
   elevation, gliricidia, Leucaena shannonii Donn. Sm., and leucaena
   released >50 kg N ha(-1) during the first 4 to 6 wk, whereas at high
   elevation A. angustissima contributed <40 kg N ha(-1) during the period.
   Leaf N release correlated negatively with (lignin + polyphenol):N at low
   elevation. At the low elevation, gliricidia, L. shannonii, and leucaena
   provided adequate N for maize production in alley cropping. At the high
   elevation, A. angustissima contained adequate N, but N release rate may
   not meet peak N demands of an associated crop.},

Abstract = {The study examines how varying harvesting intervals and processing
   methods affect the physicochemical and nutritional properties of Cogon
   grass (Imperata cylindrica Linn) silage. Its goal is to determine
   optimal practices for improving silage quality and nutritional value to
   support sustainable livestock feeding in tropical regions. A Completely
   Randomized Design (CRD) was used, with four treatments based on
   harvesting intervals (20, 25, 30, and 35 days) and three replications
   per treatment. Cogon grass silages were enhanced with 2.1\% urea
   molasses, 5.12\% maize bran, and 8.9\% Ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala)
   leaf meal to improve fermentation and nutrition. The 20-day interval
   (T1) had the highest dry matter (DM, 39.1\%) and crude protein (CP,
   9.25\%), while the 35-day interval (T4) had the lowest (30.2\% DM,
   5.66\% CP). Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was highest in T1 (78.0\%) and
   lowest in T3 (76.8\%). Gross energy ranged from 4606 to 4832 cal/g, with
   no significant differences. Silage pH decreased with longer harvest
   intervals, with T4 recording the lowest pH (4.64), indicating better
   fermentation. Total soluble solids (TSS) were highest in T1 (0.80
   degrees Brix) and lowest in T4 (0.12 degrees Brix). Sensory evaluations
   showed silages harvested at 20 and 25 days (T1 and T2) were most
   acceptable in color, odor, and moisture. Harvesting Cogon grass at 20-25
   days and supplementing with urea molasses, maize bran, and Ipil-ipil
   leaf meal produced high-quality silage with enhanced nutrition and
   fermentation, offering a sustainable feeding strategy for tropical
   livestock.},

Abstract = {Reconstructions of vascular plant mitochondrial genomes (mt-genomes) are
   notoriously complicated by rampant recombination that has resulted in
   comparatively few plant mt-genomes being available. The dearth of plant
   mitochondrial resources has limited our understanding of mt-genome
   structural diversity, complex patterns of RNA editing, and the origins
   of novel mt-genome elements. Here, we use an efficient long read
   (PacBio) iterative assembly pipeline to generate mt-genome assemblies
   for Leucaena trichandra (Leguminosae: Caesalpinioideae: mimosoid clade),
   providing the first assessment of non-papilionoid legume mt-genome
   content and structure to date. The efficiency of the assembly approach
   facilitated the exploration of alternative structures that are common
   place among plant mitochondrial genomes. A compact version (729 kbp) of
   the recovered assemblies was used to investigate sources of mt-genome
   size variation among legumes and mt-genome sequence similarity to the
   legume associated root holoparasite Lophophytum. The genome and an
   associated suite of transcriptome data from select species of Leucaena
   permitted an in-depth exploration of RNA editing in a diverse clade of
   closely related species that includes hybrid lineages. RNA editing in
   the allotetraploid, Leucaena leucocephala, is consistent with co-option
   of nearly equal maternal and paternal C-to-U edit components, generating
   novel combinations of RNA edited sites. A preliminary investigation of
   L. leucocephala C-to-U edit frequencies identified the potential for a
   hybrid to generate unique pools of alleles from parental variation
   through edit frequencies shared with one parental lineage, those
   intermediate between parents, and transgressive patterns.},

Abstract = {Puto barberi (Hemiptera: Putoidae) and Toumeyella coffeae (Hemiptera:
   Coccidae) are the most limiting species in the establishment of coffee
   crops in Norte de Santander, Colombia. In order to identify the host
   plants of the above pest species, farms with coffee crops from
   previously reported infested coffee areas were randomly selected. On
   each farm, transects were traced and weeds were pulled in order to
   record the number of plants present per morphospecies and the presence
   of P. barberi and T. coffeae on each one. For weed identification, two
   plants per morphospecies were preserved and the insects found were
   stored in 76 \% ethanol. Eighty-five transects were sampled, producing
   6,880 plants belonging to 22 families, 37 genera and 38 species for
   evaluation. P. barberi was recorded on 20 of the 38 plant species found,
   and predominated on Eirmocephala brachiata, Sida rhombifolia, Conyza
   bonariensis, Amaranthus hybridus, Leonurus japonicus and Emilia
   sonchifolia; with values ranging between 14 \% and 30 \%. Toumeyella
   coffeae was recorded on nine species, with Erato vulcanica (11.43 \%),
   Leucaena leucocephala (11. 11 \%) and Emilia sonchifolia (8.87 \%) being
   the most frequent hosts. Taking into account the most common botanical
   species found in the coffee areas of Norte de Santander, as well as the
   most frequent plants hosting both insect pests in the field, it was
   concluded that S. rhombifolia, E. sonchifolia, and C. bonariensis
   contained the highest populations of P. barberi and T. coffeae. This
   study provides a basis for the design and evaluation of cultural and
   agroecological control strategies for P. barberi and T. coffeae.},

Abstract = {Plant communities get disturbed due to open cast coal mining as large
   amount of overburden is dumped at the nearby areas of the mines. The
   vegetation on different age series of six overburden dumps (0, 4, 8, 12,
   16 and 20 years) were analyzed during the post monsoon period of 2011 in
   Sonepur Bazari area, West Bengal, India. The plant species and other
   relevant criteria were recorded using randomly placed quadrats. Species
   richness, Diversity indices and Importance value index (IVI) were
   calculated using standard methods. Among monocots, the IVI of Saccharum
   spontanium was highest at all the over burden dumps. Among dicotyledons,
   Croton bonplandianum was the most important on OBD-4 and 8. On OBD-12
   both Croton bonplandianum and Lantana camara were somewhat equally
   important. On OBD-16, Croton bonplandianum, Tephrosia perpurea and
   Evolvulus nummularius were most important where as on OBD-20 maximum
   importance value was shown by Chromalaena odorata and Hyptis suaveolens.
   Among tree species Leucaena leucocephala and Zizyphus mauritiana had
   highest IVI value on OBD-12 and Butea monosperma, Dalbergia sissoo and
   Lagerstoemia strictus on OBD-16. Finally Butea monosperma and Dalbergia
   sissoo showed highest IVI values on OBD-20. Diversity indices and
   species richness of non-grasses species was found getting increased with
   the age of OBD. Interestingly the grasses, specially Saccharum
   spontanium, were seen to grow as pioneers and got established under the
   prevailing high environmental adversity. On the contrary, other
   herbaceous and tree species were seen getting established at later
   stages of succession.},

Title = {Comparison of the formation of nicotinic acid conjugates in leaves of
   different plant species},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {There are three metabolic fates of nicotinic acid in plants: (1)
   nicotinic acid mononucleotide formation for NAD synthesis by the
   so-called salvage pathway of pyridine nucleotide biosynthesis; (2)
   nicotinic acid N-glucoside formation; and (3) trigonelline
   (N-methylnicotinic acid) formation. In the present study, the metabolism
   of {[}carbonyl-C-14]nicotinamide was investigated in leaves of 23 wild
   plant species. All species readily converted nicotinamide to nicotinic
   acid, and only a fraction of nicotinic acid was utilised for NAD and
   NADP synthesis. The remaining nicotinic acid is converted to the
   nicotinic acid conjugates. Only one plant species, Cycas revoluta,
   produced both nicotinic acid N-glucoside and trigonelline; the other 22
   species produced one or other of the conjugates. The nicotinic acid
   N-glucoside-forming plants are Cyathea lepifera, Arenga trewmula var.
   englri, Barringtonia racemosa, Hex paraguariensis, Angelica japonica,
   Scaevola taccada and Farfugium japonicum. In contrast, trigonelline is
   formed in C lepifera, Ginkgo biloba, Pin us luchuensis, Casuarina
   equisetifolia, Alocasia odora, Pandanus odoratissimus, Hylocereus
   undatus, Kalanchoe pinnata, Kalanchoe tubillora, Populus alba, Garcinia
   subelliptica, Oxalis corymbosa, Leucaena leucocephala, Vigna marina,
   Hibiscus tiliaceus and Melicope triphylla.
   The diversity of nicotinic acid conjugate formation in plants is
   discussed using these results and our previous investigation involving a
   few model plants, various crops and ferns. Nicotinic acid N-glucoside
   formation was restricted mostly to ferns and selected orders of
   angiosperms, whereas other plants produce trigonelline. In most cases
   the formation of both nicotinic acid conjugates is incompatible, but
   some exceptions have been found. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {Dairy cows often do not receive adequate nutrient supply during their
   lactation period. This condition can even be worse if the environmental
   temperature is not in comfortable range which may occur especially in
   tropical regions. The present research was aimed to simulate the effect
   of supplementary feeding on nutrient balance of lactating dairy cow at
   contrasting temperature regimes using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and
   Protein System (CNCPS) model. Treatments consisted of feeds (R1:
   Pennisetum purpureum, R2: P. purpureum + concentrate (60:40), R3: P.
   purpureum + Gliricidia sepium + Leucaena leucocephala (60:20:20), R4: P.
   purpureum + concentrate + G. sepium + L. leucocephala (60:20:10:10)) and
   environmental temperatures (T1: 20 degrees C, T2: 30 degrees C). The
   dairy cow inputs in CNCPS were Holstein breed, body weight of 500 kg,
   feed intake of 15 kg (dry matter basis) per day and produced milk 15
   kg/day. Based on the CNCPS model, there were negative balances of
   metabolisable energy (ME) and metabolisable protein (MP) if a lactating
   dairy cow fed only by P. purpureum. The ME balance was worse at higher
   temperature, while the MP balance was remain unchanged. Addition of
   concentrate mixture (R2) fulfilled the ME and MP requirements as well as
   other nutrients. Addition of leguminous tree leaves (R3 and R4) improved
   the nutritional status of the lactating cow model compared to R1, but
   did not better than R2. It was concluded that supplementary feeding is
   necessary for improving the nutrient balance of lactating dairy cow,
   especially when the cow is maintained under uncomfortable environmental
   temperature.},

Abstract = {Based on four years of plot measurements in Butare (Rwanda), the
   potential of agroforestry practices for soil conservation was analysed.
   The agroforestry system investigated is based on Grevillea robusta
   planted at a density of 200 trees per hectare. Supplementary erosion
   control measures consisted of hedgerows planted on microterraces (two
   species of leguminous shrubs: Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena
   leucocephala as well as the fodder grass Setaria splendida).
   On the agroforestry plots, crop management was in accordance with the
   principles of appropriate ({''}ecologic{''}) agriculture, including
   practices such as mixed cropping, the use of green manure, composting,
   and integration of livestock. Comparative measurements were carried out
   on bare fallow and on ``traditional farming{''} plots with monocropped
   cassava.
   With a mean annual precipitation of 1279 mm, a  rainfall erosivity
   factor of R = 385, and  a slope of 28 percent, high annual soil losses
   were recorded on the bare fallow plot (557 tons per hectare per year) as
   well as on the cassava plot (303 t . ha-1 . y-1).
   The high soil losses recorded on the Grevillea plot (111 t . ha-1 . y-1)
   demonstrate that the problem of accelerated erosion on steep slopes
   cannot be solved by simply planting trees and by introducing management
   practices that provide a better ground cover for only part of the year.
   In contrast, on agroforestry plots with supplementary erosion control
   hedges, erosion rates lower than 12,5 t . ha-1 . y-1 were measured.
   Agroforestry systems that include the integration of leguminous
   perennials as contour hedges offer a promising method for soil
   conservation even on slopes threatened by severe erosion.},

Abstract = {Giant leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata) can be managed as
   a profusely branched bushy plant by repeated harvest of its foliage for
   use as fodder. The objective of this research was to determine the
   effects of soil pH and salinity, age of the leaves, post-harvest storage
   duration, and psyllid infection on the nutritional qualities of leucaena
   fodder. To determine the effects of soil pH and salinity on fodder
   quality, giant leucaena K636 plants were grown in large pots containing
   soils adjusted to different pH and salinity levels. The effects of age
   of the leaves, post-harvest storage duration and psyllid infection on
   fodder quality were studied using leucaena samples collected from
   Waimanalo Research Station. Among five pH levels tested, pH 6.0 was
   found to produce the highest amounts of protein and structural fibers in
   the foliage. Mimosine contents were highest at pH 6 and 7 and lowest at
   pH 5.0. The growth of giant leucaena was retarded and the nutritional
   quality were adversely affected under salinity conditions. Compared to
   young leaves, old leaves contained 18.5\% less protein, 95\% less
   mimosine, 30\% less tannin and 40\% more structural fibers. Post-harvest
   storage duration up to 72 h, at room temperature did not seem to affect
   protein, tannin and structural fiber contents of the foliage; however,
   mimosine content was reduced by 25\%. These results will help to
   identify ideal soil pH, age of foliage, and post-harvest storage
   duration for obtaining high forage yield and nutritional quality for

Abstract = {Torrefaction is the thermal treatment techniques performed at relatively
   low temperature (< 300 degrees C) in an inert atmosphere, which aims to
   improve the fuel properties attractively. In this study, woody biomass
   (Leucaena leucocephala) was torrefied at various temperatures and
   holding times and the pyrolysis behaviors of the torrefied wood were
   examined in detail by using TG-MS technique. It was found that the
   carbon content and the calorific value of the torrefied leucaena
   increased significantly when temperature and holding time during the
   torrefaction increased. From the TG-MS analysis, the pyrolysis behaviors
   of the torrefied leucaena were significantly different from those of the
   raw leucaena. The char yield at 800 degrees C for the torrefied leucaena
   was increased when increasing the holding time during the torrefaction.
   On the other hand, the tar yield during the pyrolysis decreased
   significantly with the increase in the holding time during the
   torrefaction. Through the results from the TG-MS analysis, it was
   concluded that the structure of leucaena was changed by the torrefaction
   at temperature below 275 degrees C and the cross-linking reactions
   occurred during the pyrolysis resulting in increase in char yields and
   decrease in tar yields. It was also suggested that the longer the
   holding time during the torrefaction, the more the cross-linking
   reactions proceed during the pyrolysis. The results obtained from the
   study provide the basic information for the pyrolyser and/or gasifier
   design by using torrefied biomass as a fuel. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Few P and K fertility studies have been conducted on Haitian soils.
   Alley cropping is promoted in Haiti but has not been studied in relation
   to P and K fertility. The effects of P and K fertilizer and leucaena (
   Leucaena leucocephala ( Lam) De Witt) pruning mulch applications on corn
   ( Zea mays L.) were assessed in field experiments on Rhodudalfs over
   limestone at Salagnac, Lithic Hapludolls over limestone at Bergeau and
   Typic Hapludalfs over basalt at St. Georges, Haiti. Complete block
   designs arranged in incomplete factorials of P and K rates were carried
   out during three seasons. Additional treatments consisted of 30 Mg
   ha(-1) of leucaena prunings applied with and without 60 kg P and 40 kg K
   ha(-1). Grain yield and net income were analyzed and a surface response
   curve was fitted on treatments without pruning applications. The soils
   differed markedly in response to P and K with significant PXK
   interactions. Without leucaena prunings, response surface analysis
   predicted maximum yields with applications of 95-117 kg P ha(-1) and
   51-72 kg K ha(-1) and maximum net returns with applications of 0.22-89
   kg P ha(-1) and 43-79 kg K ha(-1). Leucaena pruning applications
   increased yield at all sites. Highest net income was obtained at
   Salagnac and St. Georges with leucaena prunings applied with P and K, at
   Bergeau with prunings applied without P and K, suggesting that alley
   cropping with judicial fertilizer use is a good economic alternative for
   low resource farmers. Soil parent material and mineralogy should be
   considered in making fertilizer recommendations.},

Abstract = {A study was carried out on three nitrogen (N-2)-fixing tree legumes,
   i.e., Gliricidia sepium cv. ILG50, Leucaena leucocephala cv. K28, and
   Albizia lebbeck to assess their differential phosphorus (P) nutrition
   capability over time. Dry-matter (DM) yields, P concentration, P uptake
   and partitioning in plants, and P use efficiency were estimated at 4, 8,
   12, and 16 months after planting (MAP). The trees showed a large
   interspecific variation both in DM yields and P uptake. Concentration of
   P ranged from 0.042 to 0.275\% and varied both among parts in each tree
   and among tree species over time. Leaves P concentrations showed a
   greater reduction with tree age than either stems or roots. Phosphorus
   uptake correlated significantly with plant DM (r=0.893-0.946) across
   tree species, and had a steady increasing pattern up to at least 12 MAP
   Over ages, Gliricidia outperformed the other species in P uptake.
   However, Leucaena was the most efficient user of P followed by Albizia
   and Gliricidia, in that order. Further, Leucaena revealed an attractive
   feature for alley cropping in that it stored up to 37\% of the P
   accumulated in its leaves in contrast to only 24.1\% for Gliricidia and
   19.2\% for Albizia. Therefore, the low P supply by trees into alley
   cropping is in part due to its unbalanced partitioning into stems to the
   expenses of leaves. The study shows also that P concentration in
   perennials is lower than it is reported in annual crops.},

Abstract = {The coast of the Gulf of Mexico is characterized by dry regions with
   high variation in climatic conditions. This area is rich in
   drought-tolerant or subhumid species. The species that are potentially
   useful for reforestation, regreening, agroforestry activities and the
   production of timber, fodder, fuelwood and human food have been
   overexploited, resulting in the gradual decrease and degradation of
   their populations. This study was undertaken in order to suggest ways of
   improving the regeneration of these species. Fifteen native and exotic
   multipurpose tree species of low dry shrubland planted in monoculture in
   four randomized blocks. Measurements of various growth parameters,
   volume of trees, fodder potential and agroforestry uses over 15 years
   were evaluated. Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh., E. microtheca F.
   Muell., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. (exotic species), Acacia
   farnesiana (L.) Wild and Parkinsonia aculeata L. (native species) tend
   to have better characteristics in terms of growing annual rate, economic
   value and management schemes, while Prosopis glandulosa Torr. and
   Helietta parvifolia (Gray) Benth. (native species) did not establish
   well due to biotics problems which arose under plantation conditions.
   Acacia rigidula Benth., A. wrightii Benth. and two Pithecellobium spp.
   (native species) had intermediate yields of great interest since their
   multipurpose potential is the best of all 15 species. The forage
   potential of the exotic species (483-1684 kg DM//ha/year) were notably
   superior to native species (76-721 kg DM/ha/year). The firewood
   production volume varied between averages of 0.3-1.2 (native species)
   and 0.4-2.5 m(3)/ha/year (exotic species).},

Abstract = {Seasonal variations in the feeding behaviour of Jamunapari and Barbari
   goat breeds and their utilization of browse and grass nutrients was
   evaluated in a promising 3-tier (Leucaena leucocephala- Dichrostachys
   nutan-Cenchrus ciliaris) reconstituted pasture during summer, rainy and
   winter season of the years 1987 and 1988. Distinct diurnal pattern of
   feeding was observed with both the breeds. Jamunapari goats spent
   significantly more time foraging during winter season (352.0 min)
   followed by summer (306.0 min) and least in rainy season (277.0 min).
   Though no significant difference was observed in the relative time spent
   by Barbari goats on grazing activities during summer and winter season,
   they spent significantly more (p < 0.05) time during rainy season as
   compared to other two seasons. The preference of grazing goats for
   certain plant species in relation to others was evident with distinct
   seasonal and breed variations. DM intake (g/kg BW0.75) varied
   significantly (p < 0.05) from season to season. Among the browse. L.
   leucocephala was prefered over D. nutan irrespective of breed over the
   seasons. There was no breed difference in DM intake, or proximate
   composition and nutrient digestibility of ingested herbage. The
   available nutrient content of ingested forage was found sufficient to
   meet the nutrient requirements of adult goats for maintenance (NRC,
   1981). The reconstituted 3-tier pasture dominated by plant species like
   L. leucocephala and Cenchrus species appear to have great potential to
   sustain the nutrient requirement of goats without adverse seasonal
   fluctuations in pasture quality.},

Abstract = {Decomposition and nutrient release patterns of prunings of three woody
   agroforestry plant species (Acioa barteri, Gliricidia sepium and
   Leucaena leucocephala), maize (Zea mays) stover and rice (Oryza sativa)
   straw, were investigated under field conditions in the humid tropics,
   using litterbags of three mesh sizes (0.5, 2 and 7 mm) which allowed
   differential access of soil fauna. The decomposition rate constants
   ranged from 0.01 to 0.26 week-1, decreasing in the following order;
   Gliricidia prunings > Leucaena prunings > rice straw > maize stover >
   Acioa prunings. Negative correlations were observed between
   decomposition rate constants and C:N ratio (P < 0.004), percent lignin
   (P < 0.014) and polyphenol content (P < 0.053) of plant residues. A
   positive correlation was observed between decomposition rate constant
   and mesh-size of litterbag (P < 0.057). These results indicate that both
   the chemical composition of plant residues and nature of the decomposer
   played an important role in plant residue decomposition.
   Nutrient release differed with quality of plant residues and litterbag
   mesh-size. Total N, P, Ca and Mg contents of plant residues decreased
   with time for Gliricidia and Leucaena prunings, maize stover, and rice
   straw, and increased with time for Acioa prunings. There was some
   indication of N immobilization in maize stover and rice straw; P
   immobilization in Leucaena prunings and rice straw; and Ca
   immobilization in maize stover, rice straw and Gliricidia and Leucaena
   prunings. Acioa prunings immobilized N, P, Ca and Mg. All plant residues
   released K rapidly. Nutrient release increased with increasing mesh-size
   of litterbags, suggesting that soil faunal activities enhanced nutrient
   mobilization.},

Abstract = {Infections caused by pathogenic bacteria are a recurrent problem in the
   livestock sector, generating important economic losses in the livestock
   industry. One of the main strategies includes antibiotic therapy;
   however, its use is limited since pathogenic bacteria present resistance
   to these drugs, which makes treatment against microbial infections
   difficult. Therefore, the hypothesis proposed was that ethanolic
   extracts of native plants from the state of Sonora, Mexico, can inhibit
   the growth of Gram (+) and Gram (-) pathogenic bacteria related to
   common infections in the livestock industry. The objective was to
   evaluate the phytochemical and antimicrobial profile of native plants
   from the state of Sonora, Mexico. In this study, 17 ethanolic extracts
   were obtained from native plants of Sonora, and the antimicrobial
   activity was evaluated by the agar diffusion method and by the
   microdilution technique using reference bacteria from the ATCC
   collection. The phytochemical profile was evaluated by spectrophotometry
   and the experimental design used was completely randomized with three
   replicates per treatment at 95 \% confidence. The results showed that
   extracts of Prosopis velutina, Ibervillea sonorae, Populus alba,
   Ambrosia ambrosioides, Krameria sonorae, and Leucaena leucocephala were
   effective in eliminating Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115,
   Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and
   Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (p <= 0.05). In
   addition, these extracts presented the highest concentration of total
   polysaccharides, flavones and flavonols, flavanones and
   dihydroflavonols, tannins and total chlorogenic acid (p <= 0.05).
   Therefore, plant extracts from Sonora, Mexico, represent a natural
   alternative for the control of Gram (+) and Gram (-) pathogens of
   importance to the livestock industry.},

   Grain, straw and biological yield of TPR over bare soil were increased
   by 31.9, 26.6 and 28.3\%, respectively. Uptake of Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu by
   rice under TPR were 52, 33, 36 and 33\% higher, respectively than AR

Title = {Mulching on family maize farms in the tropics: A systematic review},
Journal = {CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Family farms, predominantly reliant on family labour, produce
   approximately three-quarters of the World's food. Maize (Zea mays) is
   the world's most produced cereal. Yet in much of the tropics, actual
   maize yields are far below those attainable with best-bet practices.
   While any advantage of adding mulch might depend on soil fertility
   level, mulch quality, amount of rainfall, irrigation, and other factors,
   no ranking of their importance has been found. Our objectives were to
   disentangle these influences to assess how mulch affects yields on
   different fertility soils under different precipitation regimes. We
   conducted a systematic review in Web of Science, obtaining 50 papers on
   experiments from the tropics. Fewer trials have been conducted in Asia
   and Pacific (n = 10) than in Africa (n = 20) or Latin America and the
   Caribbean (n = 20). Twenty mulches had been tested of which Leucaena
   leucocephala had been used in 25\% of trials. Mulch was more commonly
   applied after (n = 15) than before (n = 18) sowing or at sowing (n =
   14); three trials did not mention application timing. Mulch increased
   grain yield and biomass. The positive effect of mulch was greater when
   combined with mineral fer-tilizer, implying a synergistic rather than a
   substitutional effect and demonstrating its applicability, even for
   farmers able to afford inputs. Mulch increased both maize grain yield
   and total biomass so is recommended as a sustainable practice in
   general, but particularly on low fertility soils in lower rainfall
   areas. Future work should model mass loss and nutrient release of
   different mulch types under different agroecological conditions.},

Abstract = {Symbiotic properties of rhizobia are important characteristics both to
   describe new genera and species of these bacteria and to select
   inoculant strains. To verify the specificity of Azorhizobium johannae
   strains and Sesbania virgata, with currently known rhizobia species and
   their original hosts, three greenhouse experiments were carried out in
   Leonard jars. In the first experiment, seven A. johannae strains (BR
   5401, UFLA 01-602, UFLA 01-54B, BR 5414, BR 5416, BR 5420, BR 5426) were
   tested separately, with ten legume species. These strains nodulated
   efficiently only Sesbania virgata. Although nodulation did occur with
   Sesbania rostrata, Phaseolus vulgaris and Macroptilium atropurpureum, it
   was inefficient. Nodulation was not observed with Acacia mangium,
   Glycine max, Leucaena leucocephala, Lupinus sp., Medicago sativa or
   Vigna unguiculata. In the second experiment, eight type or reference
   strains of known rhizobia species (ORS 571(T), USDA 205(T), NZP 5549(T),
   CIAT 899(T), UFLA 04-74B, NZP 2213(T), CFN 42(T) and BR 2001) were
   tested with S. virgata. Only the strains ORS 571T (Azorhizobium
   caulinodans) and BR 5401 (A. johannae) were able to nodulate S. virgata.
   In the last experiment seven strains of A. johannae (UFLA Ol-54B, UFLA
   01-602, BR 5401, BR 5414, BR 5416, BR 5420, BR 5426) were tested for
   ability to nodulate stems of S. rostrata. Only strain ORS 571(T),
   originally isolated from S. rostrata, was able to nodulate this species.
   The specificity of A. johannae and S. virgata symbiosis supports the
   proposition that S. virgata isolates as a new species of Azorhizobium.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to determine if adaptation of lambs to
   ingestion of tree leaf extracts of Salix babylonica and Leucaena
   leucocephala can modify in vitro gas production of Celtis ehrenbergiana,
   Ficus trigonata, Fraxinus excelsior and Prunus domestica. Samples of
   leaves were collected in triplicate (i.e., three individual samples of
   each tree leaf). Rumen inoculum was collected from 8 growing lambs fed a
   total mixed ration ad libitum (control; RC). Incubations were repeated
   with the rumen fluid collected from another 8 growing lambs of the same
   breed fed the same ration, but fed a daily dose of 30 ml/d of S.
   babylonica and L leucocephala extracts in a 1:1 (v:v) mixture
   (treatment; RX). Leaf samples were incubated with each rumen fluid
   (i.e., RC and RX inoculums) in 3 runs on different weeks. Data of each
   of the three runs within sample replicate were averaged and used as the
   mean value of each individual sample within tree species for statistical
   analysis in a 4 (tree species) x 2 (rumen inoculum) factorial design. In
   vitro gas production was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24,48 and 72 h
   of incubation. After 72 h, the incubation was stopped and supernatant pH
   was determined, and then filtered to determine apparent degraded
   substrate (ADS). Fermentation parameters, such as the 72 h partitioning
   factor (PF72), 24 h gas yield (GY(24)), in vitro organic matter
   digestibility (IVOMD), metabolizable energy (ME), short chain fatty
   acids concentration (SCFA), and microbial protein production (MP) were
   estimated. The crude protein content of the leaves ranged from 147 (F.
   trigonata) to 241 (C. ehrenbergiana) g/kg dry matter. The lowest fiber
   fraction values was in P. domestica, while F. excelsior had the highest,
   and C. ehrenbergiana and F. trigonata were intermediate. Secondary
   metabolites (i.e., total phenolics, saponins, aqueous fraction) were
   lowest in P. domestica and highest in F. trigonata. Accumulated gas
   production was highest (P<0.05) in F. excelsior during the first 24 h of
   incubation. All fermentation parameters (i.e., ADS,SCFA,GY(24), PF72,
   IVOMD, ME, MP) varied (P<0.01) among tree leaves. The ADS, SCFA and MP
   were highest (P<0.01) in F. excelsior, lowest (P<0.01) in F. trigonata,
   and intermediate in P. domestica and C. ehrenbergiana. Incubation of
   tree leaves with RX inoculum did not affect gas production in the first
   6 h, but it was lower (P<0.05) at 24-72 h, except for F. trigonata. C.
   ehrenbergiana had the highest (P<0.05) potential gas production, but
   rate of gas production and the discrete lag time did not differ among
   leaves. As incubation of tree leaves with RX inoculum lowered (P<0.05)
   all fermentation parameters, oral administrated extracts of S.
   babylonica and L. leucocephala did not seem to adapt the rumen microbial
   population to better utilize these tree leaves. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Although the capacity of plants to store carbon is known, obtaining
   information about the sequestration potential in the soil and in
   herbaceous, shrubby and tree biomass in land use systems is essential,
   even more so in landscapes dominated by livestock. The objective was to
   study the dynamics of carbon storage in three different forage systems
   in a livestock farm in Concepcion, Paraguay. For this, the carbon level
   was estimated at different soil depths (0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) and in
   the herbaceous/shrub biomass in three systems (Brachiaria brizantha cv
   Marandu, Panicum maximum cv Colonial and Leucaena leucocephala
   consortium with colonial), with an interval of 30 days between the three
   measurement moments. The results generated from the biomass indicated
   that the system constituted by the colonial forage consortium with L.
   leucocephala, presented the highest level of carbon (3.73 t.ha(-1)),
   showing a significant difference in relation to the B. brizantha (2.12
   t.ha(-1); p<0.05). On the other hand, the initial period showed higher
   carbon concentration (4.55 t.ha(-1); p<0.05). Likewise, a higher content
   was found at a depth of 0-20 cm (20.26 t.ha(-1); p<0.05). These results
   were obtained in a winter process. In this regard, it is important to
   mention that forage shrubs in systems with pastures constitute a
   fundamental nutritional resource in winter, in this sense it is
   recommended to use improved and consortium pasture systems, to increase
   carbon storage, achieve stable and productive systems, in correspondence
   with its potentialities.},

Abstract = {Nutrition is a major constraint in smallholder livestock production;
   hence, the use of alternative sources which are adaptive to long dry
   seasons is imperative. The study was conducted to establish options of
   improving nutrition and palatability and also to determine the
   performance of goats fed on cactus-browse hay as dry season supplements.
   Palatability and adequacy of nutrition was investigated using 32
   castrated male goat kids. The kids were housed in individual metabolism
   cages for 84 days in a complete randomised design (CRD) with eight
   replicates for the four treatment diets. Daily experimental diet, basal
   diet and water intake were measured, and live mass was measured at
   weekly intervals. Daily diet intake was significantly different (P <
   0.05) among treatments. Kids that were supplemented with cactus-Leucaena
   leucocephala meal (CLLM) consumed more than those on cactus-Acacia
   angustissima meal (CAAM), cactus-Gliricidia sepium meal (CGSM) and
   cactus-Pennisetum purpureum meal (CPPM) in that order. CGSM was not
   readily palatable as goat kids refused to take it when mixed with fresh
   cactus. Animals that were not supplemented with a source of nitrogen
   together with those that were supplemented with less palatable diet of
   CGSM lost weight significantly (P < 0.05) initially but gained weight
   slightly towards the end of the study. Significantly higher weight gains
   (P < 0.05) were observed in animals in CLLM and CAAM treatment. It was
   concluded that fresh cactus could be used to improve poor quality
   roughage intakes in goats, and therefore, there is need to promote its
   use in periods of feed deficit especially in smallholder sector.},

Title = {Effect of tree pruning and pruning application to trees on nitrogen
   fixation by Leucaena and Gliricidia},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-128},
Abstract = {A microplot study was conducted with Leucaena leucocephala and
   Gliricidia sepium to determine the effect of pruning the trees and
   applying the prunings to the soil (as either surface mulch or
   soil-incorporated green manure) on N-2 fixation by the trees. N-2
   fixation was estimated by the N-15 dilution method, and the
   non-N-2-fixing species Senna siamea was used as a reference species.
   Number and dry weight of nodules were reduced with applications of
   prunings in Leucaena, and increased in Gliricidia. For both species, the
   lowest rate of N-2 fixation (47\%) occurred under green manure
   incorporation after pruning, and the highest (66\%) with mulching and
   no-pruning. Incorporation of green manure into soil significantly
   depressed N-2 fixation by 19.1\% in Gliricidia and 20.6\% in Leucaena
   compared to no-pruning treatment. The deleterious effect of
   incorporation of prunings into soil also affected the amount of N-2
   fixed. During the nine months following pruning, green manure
   incorporation steadily decreased the percentage of N-2 fixed, whereas
   with no-pruning, pruning only and pruning with mulching, N-2 fixation
   increased with time. Reduction of N-2 fixation in pruned plants could
   imply that they would compete for N with interplanted food crops,
   causing lower N use efficiency by the latter. Despite lower dry-matter
   and N yields of Leucaena as compared with Gliricidia, its biological N-2
   fixation amounted to 73\% of its N requirement as opposed to the
   corresponding figures of 50\% for Gliricidia.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the current status of Leucaena leucocephala
   (leucaena) feeding systems and proposes research priorities for leucaena
   development in Argentina. Although research on leucaena as forage for
   cattle production began in the late 1960s, it was not widely adopted
   until 2010 (5 decades later). The recent adoption is related to the
   incorporation of the `Australian technology package', previously adapted
   for use by farmers in the neighboring region of the Paraguayan Chaco. In
   June 2018, we surveyed 8 properties with about 2,400 ha of leucaena in
   silvopastoral systems for beef cattle production in the Argentinean
   Chaco region, as well as 10 smallholder farms with about 10 ha of
   leucaena protein banks for dairy cattle in the northeast of Argentina.
   In the silvopastoral systems, leucaena condition was excellent on most
   properties in the 750. 1,350 mm/year rainfall zone and low/poor on only
   1 farm due to low rainfall (600 mm/year). In protein banks, leucaena
   condition was excellent or good on 6 of the properties and low/poor on
   the remaining 4, attributed to ingress of weeds and/or overgrazing.
   Grass condition was good in most of the systems but was low/poor in 2
   silvopastoral systems due to very high stocking rates imposed to
   restrict leucaena height. Although there is high potential for leucaena
   development in Argentina, expansion should take place carefully with
   leucaena planted only on areas suitable for successful establishment,
   and using appropriate management practices to reduce establishment
   failures and costs, restrict leucaena height, enhance grass persistence,
   improve grazing strategies and manage mimosine toxicity problems.},

Title = {Determination of Tropical Forage Preferences Using Two Offering Methods

Journal = {ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {524-529},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Two methods of feed preference trials were compared to evaluate the
   acceptability of 5 fresh foliages: Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa
   oleifera, Portulaca oleracea, Guazuma ulmifolia, and Brosimum alicastrum
   that was included as control. The evaluation included chemical analyses
   and forage intake by rabbits. The first method was a cafeteria trial; 12
   California growing rabbits aged 8 wk, allocated in individual cages,
   were offered the five forage plants at the same time inside the cage,
   while in the second trial 60 California growing rabbits aged 8 wk,
   allocated individually, were randomly distributed into 5 experimental
   groups (n = 12/group); for each group just one forage species was
   offered at a time. The testing period for each method lasted for 7 d,
   preceded by one week of adaptation. The results showed that B.
   alicastrum and L. lecocephala were the most preferred forages while on
   the contrary G. ulmifolia was the least preferred one by rabbits. The
   results also revealed that the CV\% value for the 2nd method (16.32\%),
   which the tested forages were presented separately to rabbits, was lower
   and methodologically more acceptable than such value for the 1st method
   (34.28\%), which all forages were presented together at the same time.
   It can be concluded that a range of tropical forages were consumed in
   acceptable quantities by rabbits, suggesting that diets based on such
   forages with a concentrate supplement could be used successfully for
   rabbit production. However, growth performance studies are still needed
   before recommendations could be made on appropriate ration formulations
   for commercial use.},

Title = {Grazing and browsing times of goats with three levels of herbage

Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {335-339},
Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {Goats have been reported to browse and graze in different proportions
   during the year varying with the quantity and quality of available
   forage. Nevertheless, the proportions of these behaviors when the
   standing crop of bush and herbaceous forage is kept constant in
   availability (dry matter/ha) and varied in height (canopy) has been
   largely ignored. In this experiment three adjacent mixed irrigated
   pastures of grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) and shrub (Leucaena leucocephala)
   were used. Grass height was maintained at 27, 14 and 7 cm for treatments
   I, II and III, respectively, while the height of bushes (6666 plants/ha)
   were all kept at 150 cm. Dry matter availability was estimated on a
   weekly basis. Six 2-month-old Saanen female goats were placed in the
   three pastures (two goats per pasture) every morning from 0700 to 0800.
   One person observed each treatment (pasture), registering the time that
   each animal spent browsing, grazing and engaged in other activities.
   Every week, pairs of animals were assigned to a different treatment. By
   the end of the experiment (21 weeks), each pair of goats, had been
   observed for 7 weeks in each treatment. Across treatments goats grazed
   63\%, browsed 32\% and were engaged in other activities for 3\% of their
   time. The time spent browsing declined (P < 0.05) while time spent
   grazing increased (P < 0.05) as grass height increased. Other behaviors,
   remained constant. It is concluded that height of the grazing strata can
   influence time goats spend grazing and browsing when accessibility to
   browse is held constant. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},

Volume = {162},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Despite several studies, role of eco-restoration strategies involving
   trees and grasses on soil organic carbon pools and fractions, response
   of soil enzymes in degraded land of tropical climate has remain largely
   overlooked. Four native fast growing fodder trees, namely, Ficus
   infectoria, Morus alba, Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala with
   combination of grasses viz., Cenchrus ciliaris, Chrysopogon fulvus and
   Panicum maximum were used as ecorestoration tool in Bundelkhand region.
   Total organic carbon (TOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), and activities of
   important soil enzymes were measured. After 9 years, land under Ficus,
   Morus, Acacia and Leucaena had-63, 105, 87 and 81\% greater TOC than
   fallow land in surface layer and Cenchrus, Panicum, and Chrysopogon
   increased TOC by 84, 91 and 77\% at surface layers, respectively, over
   fallow land. MBC increased by 2?2.5 folds in both soil layers. All C
   fractions responded positively to eco-restoration. Ficus, Morus, Acacia
   and Leucaena boosted up carbon management index (CMI) by 51, 84, 71 and
   65\% at surface layers, respectively over fallow land. Similarly,
   grasses also improved CMI by >60\%. Soil organic carbon accumulation
   under Ficus, Morus, Acacia and Leucaena were -55, 91, 77 and 71\% higher
   than fallow land at surface layers, and 71, 85, 95 and 69\% higher than
   fallow land at subsurface soil layers. We developed an index for
   comparing ecorestoration efficiency (ERE). We found Morus + Panicum,
   Acaia + Panicum to be effective restoration strategies for
   eco-restoration under degraded lands of tropical climates. Our study
   indicated that implementation of these ecological restoration strategies
   could be a quantitatively important component of national climate change
   mitigation strategies in India and thus should be continually paid a
   great attention.},

Abstract = {Two experiments using newly weaned heifers or steers compared leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala) (0.4 ha) + bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) (0.4
   ha) vs bahiagrass (0.8 ha) 13 replicates). In Experiment 1. 18 heifers
   were inoculated with dihydroxypyridine-degrading (DHP) bacteria and
   placed on treatments from June 1994-January 1995. Presentation yields of
   leucaena leaf in June were 1800 kg/ha with 30\% crude protein, and 62\%
   IVOMD. Liveweight gains (LWG) for 1994 were greater for heifers grazing
   leucaena + bahiagrass (34 kg/hd) vs bahiagrass: alone (12 kg/hd) even
   though heifers: ate little leucaena until September. Experiment I
   continued with the same group of heifers grazing the same treatments
   from April-December 1995. Leucaena leaf was 1200 kg/ha in April and
   virtually nil by June. LWGs were similar for both groups. In Experiment
   II. two different groups of 18 steers each grazed from July-November
   1996 and 1997. Initial presentation yields of leucaena leaf in July 1996
   and 1997 averaged 2200 kg/ha and declined to 400 kg/ha in November each
   year. Mean LWG over 112 days in 1996 and 1997 was 53 kg/hd for steers
   grazing bahiagrass + leucaena and 8 kg/hd fur steers grazing bahiagrass
   alone. Passive transfer of DHP-degrading bacteria was demonstrated.
   Leucaena is a dependable legume and can provide a high level of
   nutrition for weaned cattle in Florida providing its use is deferred
   until late summer when bahiagrass nutritive value is low. Weaned cattle
   not accustomed to leucaena may require adaptation by grazing with cattle
   used to grazing leucaena in order to hasten acceptance and permit
   transfer of rumen bacteria with DHP-degrading ability.},

Title = {Overhead-irrigation with saline and alkaline water: Deleterious effects
   on foliage of Rhodes grass and leucaena},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {173-182},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Saline and alkaline water represents a potentially valuable resource
   provided its irrigation does not decrease plant growth. Although the
   adverse effects of salts within the rooting environment are
   well-studied, comparatively little is known regarding the direct effects
   of overhead-irrigation of saline and alkaline water on plant foliage.
   The present study examined the potential deleterious effects of saline
   (electrical conductivity, EC, <= 15 dS m(-1)) and alkaline (<= 2000 mg
   L-1, CaCO3 equivalent) water on foliage of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana
   cv. Reclaimer) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala ssp. glabrata cv.
   Tarramba) under a range of growing-conditions. Foliage of leucaena was
   sensitive, with necrosis and chlorosis evident for saline water at an EC
   >= 3 dS m(-1) and alkaline water containing >= 500 mg L-1 (CaCO3
   equivalent). For leucaena, this damage to the foliage reduced relative
   shoot fresh mass and chlorophyll fluorescence for saline-treatments, but
   alkalinity did not reduce relative shoot fresh mass or chlorophyll
   fluorescence in any treatment. In contrast to leucaena, relative shoot
   fresh mass of Rhodes grass was not reduced by foliar-applied salinity in
   any treatment (nor did alkalinity reduce growth of Rhodes grass). It was
   noted that growing conditions influenced the magnitude of the
   deleterious effects, with salinization of the soil slightly increasing
   tolerance to foliar-applied saline water for leucaena. This study has
   demonstrated that whilst saline and alkaline water can potentially be
   used for overhead irrigation, differences in observed tolerance exist
   between plant species, and are influenced by growing conditions. (C)

Journal = {TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {220-232},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Annual crops and pastures in monoculture frequently have negative
   effects on ecosystem services due to soil and biodiversity losses.
   Silvopastoral systems (SSP) have been proposed as an alternative for
   livestock production systems; however, there are few studies that
   demonstrate their benefits on soil health. For that reason, this study
   was established to evaluate the effect of different land uses on soil
   health measured through chemical indicators. For this purpose, the
   following land uses managed for at least 19 years were evaluated: (i)
   intensive maize (Zea mays) production, (ii) a guinea (Megathyrsus
   maximus) and angleton (Dichantium aristatum) mixed pasture, (iii) SSP
   with grasses and shrubs of totumo (Cresentia cujete) and leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala), (iv) a multistrata SSP with the same grasses
   and shrubs plus tree fodder species: (Cassia grandis, Albizia saman and
   Guazuma ulmifolia); and (v) a secondary forest used as a reference. The
   evaluations were made in contrasting seasons (dry and rainy), in soils
   of the Middle Sinu river valley (Colombia), with a drainage gradient. In
   general, the soils of the SPS presented the highest values for MOS,
   total N, Mg, B, N-NO3 and CICE, the grass alone pasture presented the
   highest values in micronutrients: Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn and S and NH4, and
   lower values for pH, P and NO3, and the highest for Al; whereas,
   intermediate values for all chemical indicators were obtained in the
   secondary forest. In contrast, soils cultivated with corn presented the
   poorest chemical indicators. It is concluded that SSP improve the
   chemical indicators of soil health as compared to the grass alone
   pasture and corn monoculture.},

Journal = {ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objective: Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) is a perennial tropical
   legume that can be directly grazed or harvested and offered to ruminants
   as hay, silage, or fresh. However, Leucaena contain phenolic compounds,
   which are considered anti-nutritional factors as these may reduce
   intake, digestibility and thus animal performance. Therefore, the
   objective of this experiment was to determine effects of Leucaena silage
   (LS) feeding levels on rumen microbial populations, N-balance and
   microbial protein synthesis in dairy steers.
   Methods: Four, rumen fistulated dairy steers with initial weight of 167
   +/- 12 kg were randomly assigned to receive dietary treatments according
   to a 4x4 Latin square design. Treatments were as followings: T1 =
   untreated rice straw (RS; Control), T2 = 70\% RS+30\% LS, T3 = 40\%
   RS+60\% LS, and T4 = 100\% LS. Dairy steers were fed rice straw and LS
   ad libitum and supplemented with concentrate at 0.2\% of body weight/d.
   Results: Results revealed that the rumen microbial population,
   especially cellulolytic, proteolytic bacteria and fungal zoospores were
   enhanced in steers that received 60\% of LS (p<0.05), whereas the
   amylolytic bacteria population was not affected by treatments (p>0.05).
   Protozoal population was linearly decreased with increasing level of LS
   (p<0.05). Moreover, N-balance and microbial protein synthesis were
   enhanced by LS feeding (p<0.05) and were the highest in 60\% LS group.
   Conclusion: Based on this study, it could be concluded that replacement
   of RS with 60\% LS significantly improved microbial population and
   microbial protein synthesis in diary steers.},

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1999},

Abstract = {Although N-rich leaf biomass of multipurpose trees is known to be a good
   source of N to crops, integrating such trees into crop production
   systems is a major challenge in the development of viable agroforestry
   systems. An approach to integrating calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus
   Meissner) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit), two
   promising agroforestry tree species, into maize (Zea mays L.) production
   system was investigated in the subhumid highlands of central Kenya
   during four maize-growing seasons from 1994 to 1996. The experiment
   consisted of maize plots to which tree prunings obtained from hedgerows
   grown either in situ (alley cropping) or ex situ (biomass transfer from
   outside) were applied. When alley-cropped with leucaena, maize produced
   significantly higher yields compared to maize monoculture (both
   non-fertilized and fertilized) treatments, but when alley-cropped with
   calliandra, the yield of maize was less than that of the monocropped
   unfertilized control. Application of ex situ grown calliandra and
   leucaena prunings with or without fertilizer resulted in higher maize
   grain yield than in the nonfertilized and fertilized treatments. Yields
   of calliandra alley- cropped maize were 11\% to 51\% lower than those of
   nonalley-cropped treatments receiving calliandra prunings from ex situ
   grown trees; the decrease was 2\% to 17\% with leucaena, indicating that
   calliandra hedges were more competitive than leucaena hedges. The
   alley-cropped prunings-removed treatments produced the lowest maize
   yields. The study showed that, in the subhumid tropical highlands of
   Kenya, inclusion of calliandra hedges on cropland adversely affected
   maize yields. On the other hand, alley cropping with leucaena was
   advantageous.},

Abstract = {Substances produced by plants have huge importance regulating multiple
   functions as germination, development promoter/ enhancer, yield
   increaser and activator of plant defense system against diseases and
   pests. Due to diversity, each plant species produces different compounds
   and in different concentrations. This research evaluated the role of 20
   plants extracts obtained from different plant species or plant tissues
   on seed germination and seedlings establishment of maize and lettuce, in
   concentration of 5\%, 10\% or 20\%. For this, two experiments were
   carried out, the first analyzing 20 plant extracts and the effects on
   germination percentage and root and shoot length based on the
   germination test for the two species. The second was carried out in a
   greenhouse, in a completely randomized design with three and ten
   repetitions for maize and lettuce, respectively, using only the three
   extracts with the best results from the first experiment. Seedling
   height and seedling dry matter were evaluated. To germination test most
   of extracts showed negative or no effects in both species. Only Conyza
   bonariensis at 5\% and Richardia brasiliensis at 5\% and 20\% had
   positive effects on early seedling growth, increasing the seedlings
   length for maize seedlings. To seedlings establishment, Conyza
   bonariensis, Leucaena leucocephala and Richardia brasiliensis extracts
   did not show statistical difference to shoots height but increased the
   dry mass of shoots and roots. The results demonstrated that these plants
   extract have potential as growth promoters and can be a good option to a
   better seedling growth and establishment, collaborating to a more
   effective agriculture.},

Abstract = {A major challenge in developing agroforestry approaches that utilize
   tree-leaf biomass for provision of N to crops is to ensure synchrony
   between the N released from decomposing prunings and N demand by crops.
   A study was conducted in the subhumid highlands of Kenya to assess the
   rate of decomposition and mineralization of soil-incorporated Calliandra
   calothyrsus Meissner (calliandra) and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit (leucaena) tree biomass and maize roots (Zea mays L.) both in an
   alley cropping and a sole cropping system. The amount of mineralized N
   peaked four weeks after planting (WAP) maize in all the treatments
   during both seasons of 1995. Cumulative mineralized N at week 20 ranged
   from 114 to 364 kg N ha(-1) season(-1), the absolute control treatment
   giving the lowest and the prunings-incorporated treatments giving the
   highest amounts in the two seasons. Total N uptake by maize, ranging
   from 42 to 157 kg ha(-)1 season(-1), was lowest in the `alley-cropped,
   prunings-removed' treatments, and highest in the `non
   alley-cropped-prunings-incorporated' treatments. The apparent N recovery
   rate by maize was highest in the fertilizer applied treatments in the
   two seasons. Decomposition rate constants (kD) ranged from 0.07 to 0.21
   week(-1), and the rates among the different plant residues were as
   follows: leucaena < calliandra < maize roots. Nitrogen release rate
   constants (kN), ranging from 0.04 to 0.25 week(-1), followed a similar
   pattern as the rate of decomposition with leucaena releasing the highest
   amount of N followed by calliandra and lastly by maize roots.},

Abstract = {Long term incubation studies to determine the nitrogen (N)
   mineralization rates and kinetics in soils freshly amended with some
   commonly used green manures such as Sesbania rostrata, Gliricidia
   maculata, Leucaena leucocephala and Azolla pinnata are scarce. A long
   term aerobic study was, therefore, conducted by incubating soils freshly
   amended with the above-mentioned green manures in PVC columns at 35 +/-
   1 degrees C and with 0.01 Mpa moisture content. The soils were then
   leached at periodic intervals for up to 36 weeks.
   The N-mineralization rates were greatest during the first week and
   decreased with time in all soils. The green manure amended soils leached
   247 mg kg(-1) more NO3 + NO2 - N than the unamended control. In general,
   the total N mineralized (mean 61\%) was almost twice that of net N
   mineralized (mean 30\%) in the amended soils. The percent N mineralized
   (total and net), however, varied with the nature of green manure
   incorporated into the soil. It was greatest in the soil amended with
   sesbania and lowest in the soil amended with azolla. The kinetic
   parameters derived using the double exponential model indicated that
   green manure amended soils possessed significantly higher
   N-mineralization potentials and rate constants compared to the unamended
   control. The kinetic parameters also varied with the nature of green
   manure incorporated into the soil. Among the various parameters lignin
   content, lignin to N ratio and lignin + polyphenol to N ratio of the
   green manures were the key factors governing the rate of decomposition
   and subsequent N mineralization from the amended soils.},

Abstract = {Deep ravines along the Chambal river represent the worst form of land
   degradation by runoff water. Performance of seven tree species in terms
   of growth, biomass production, carbon stock (CS) and soil properties was
   observed after 8 years of plantation tree species and rejuvenation of
   natural vegetation (NV) on the degraded ravine land. The ravine area was
   treated with embankment type water harvesting structures (WHS) targeting
   complete control of runoff and support the vegetation. The total biomass
   CS was significantly higher in A. nilotica (13.44 Mg ha(-1)) followed by
   A. indica (8.97 Mg ha(-1)) and lowest in A. catechu (3.17 Mg ha(-1)).
   The soil CS was significantly higher in L. leucocephala (4.67 Mg catechu
   (3.86 Mg ha(-1)). Similarly in NV, higher biomass and CS were recorded
   with small trees followed by grasses, shrubs, climbers, and herbs. Under
   A. nilotica afforestation with NV, the highest mean annual CS rate was
   found to be 2.46 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). Tree plantation of L. leucocephala
   led to maximum improvement of organic carbon (OC), water holding
   capacity (WHC) and a sum of all macronutrient availability followed by
   A. indica, D. sissoo and A. nilotica in treated ravine land. Combined
   ranking in terms of survival, height, the diameter of stumped height
   (DSH) and biomass yield showed that the preferred choice for tree
   species was in the order of Acacia nilotica > Azadirachta indica >
   Prosopis juliflora > Leucaena leucocephala > Balanitesa egyptiaca >
   Dalbergia sissoo > Acacia catechu.},

Abstract = {In vitro studies using plant extracts suggest a relationship between
   their polyphenol contents and their anthelmintic (AH) activity against
   Haemonchus contortus. High polyphenol content appears to increase the
   efficacy of plant extracts against H. contortus as assessed by the
   larval exsheathment inhibition assay (LEIA) while appearing to reduce
   the AH efficacy measured using the egg hatch assay (EHA). In addition,
   some plants lack AH activity. Therefore, the present study investigated
   the relationship between the contents of condensed tannins (CT), total
   phenols (TP), and total tannins (TT) in methanol:water extracts (70:30)
   obtained from ten tropical plant species consumed by small ruminants as
   well as their AH activity against H. contortus evaluated by LEIA and
   EHA. Extracts of Acacia collinsii, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Havardia
   albicans, Senegalia gaumeri, Mimosa bahamensis, Piscidia piscipula,
   Acacia pennatula, Gymnopodium floribundum, Leucaena leucocephala, and
   Bunchosia swartziana were examined. Positive correlations were found
   between the effective concentration 50\% (EC50) (EHA) of extracts and
   their CT (r = 0.6809, P < 0.05, n = 10) and TP (r = 0.9152, P < 0.05, n
   = 10) content, suggesting that their concentration negatively affected
   AH activity against eggs. Based on the LEIA, there was no significant
   association between the EC50 and the CT, TP, or TT of all extracts
   evaluated. Thus, if sheep and goats consume a complex feed mixture with
   high amounts of CT, TP, and TT, it might be difficult to observe an AH
   effect against H. contortus egg hatching. However, the AH effect upon
   L-3 establishment might be feasible.},

Abstract = {It is widely accepted that selection for high milk yield in dairy cows
   has negatively affected their reproductive performance. After calving,
   dairy cows experience a nutritional imbalance due to an asynchrony in
   the occurrence of the lactation and dry matter intake peaks. In the
   tropics, this situation is exacerbated due to poor quality and/or
   availability of the diet. A study was carried out to describe the
   nutritional and reproductive behavior of two-to-four parturition
   crossbred cows (Gyr (Bos indicus) x Holstein (Bos taurus)) divided in
   two groups according to their calving to first service interval (CFSI):
   Group 1: <= 50 days CFSI, n= 7; Group 2: <= 50 days CFSI, n= 8. Animals
   were grazing in an intensive silvopastoral system (ISS) based on
   Leucaena leucocephala and Cynodon plectostachyus and also received
   protein, energy and mineral supplementation. Dry matter (DMI) and
   nutrient intake were individually estimated and correlations between
   reproductive and nutritional parameters were performed. Additionally,
   serum progesterone concentration was monitored. Group 2 had greater
   forage and total DMI and milk production than Group 1 (P<0.05). Hence,
   Group 2 had greater nutrient intake from forages than Group 1 (P<0.05).
   Group 1 had a positive nutritional balance and an optimum reproductive
   performance compared to Group 2, which had a negative energy balance and
   lengthier days with open intervals (P<0.05). It was corroborated that
   protein and energy are required in adequate levels, to ensure that
   uterus undergoes involution correctly and ovarian activity starts soon
   in the postpartum period.},

Abstract = {Rehabilitation of Shengou Creek, a small, steep mountain stream in
   southwestern China that is prone to debris flows, started more than 30
   years ago through an integrated program of engineering applications
   (check dams and guiding dikes), biological measures (reforestation), and
   social measures (reducing human disturbance). Small and medium-sized
   check dams and guiding dikes were constructed on key upper and middle
   sections of the creek to stabilize hillslopes and channel bed.
   Meanwhile. Leucaena leucocephala, a drought-tolerant, fast-growing, and
   highly adaptive plant species, was introduced to promote vegetation
   recovery in the watershed. The collective community structure of tree,
   shrub, and herb assemblages in the artificial L leucocephala forest,
   which developed after 7 years, enhanced soil structure and drastically
   reduced soil erosion on hillslopes. Cultivation of steep land was
   strictly controlled in the basin, and some inhabitants were encouraged
   to move from upstream areas to downstream towns to reduce disturbance.
   These integrated measures reduced sediment supply from both hillslopes
   and upstream channels, preventing sediment-related hazards. The
   development of natural streambed resistance structures (mainly step-pool
   systems) and luxuriant riparian vegetation aided channel stability,
   diversity of stream habitat, and ecological maintenance in the creek.
   These findings are compared with Jiangjia and Xiaobaini Ravines, two
   adjacent non-rehabilitated debris-flow streams which have climate and
   geomorphologic conditions similar to Shengou Creek. Habitat diversity
   indices, taxa richness, biodiversity, and bio-community indices are much
   higher in Shengou Creek relative to Jiangjia and Xiaobaini Ravines,
   attesting to the effectiveness of rehabilitation measures. (C) 2011

Abstract = {EARLY RECOVERY OF SUBTROPICAL DRY FOREST IN SOUTHWESTERN PUERTO RICO
   Tree cover and species composition were surveyed in 1998, 2003, and 2010
   after the elimination of grazing and fire on the lower 32 hectares of
   the Tinaja tract at Laguna Cartagena National Wildlife Refuge in
   south-western Puerto Rico. Surveys of the secondary subtropical dry
   forest showed that stems increased 3.9 times, trees 6.7 times, basal
   area 3.3 times, and biomass 4.4 times between 1998 and 2010. Notable
   differences occurred by site. Greater numbers of stems and trees,
   greater basal areas, and usually biomass were tallied on 10 plots along
   the southern boundary closer to residual tree cover than on the northern
   22 plots in all three years of measurement. Four plots situated in
   arroyos and one plot along a fence-line also showed greater values when
   compared to the respective mean values for all 32 plots on lower Tinaja.
   Other major trends between 1998 and 2010 were: exotics increased from 70
   to 84\% of the stems and from 70 to 86\% of the trees; the ratio of
   stems to trees declined from 2.3 to 1.3; Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.)
   DeWit increased from 7 to 53\% of the stems and from 14 to 64\% of the
   trees; Pilosocereus royenii (L.) Byles \& Rowley decreased from 10 to
   2\% of the stems and from 7 to 1\% of the trees, largely due to attack
   by the cactus mealybug, Hypogeococcus pungens; and tree species richness
   increased from 30 to 34.},

Abstract = {1 The herbivorous bug Heteropsylla cubana Crawford (Homoptera:
   Psyllidae) is a pest of the cattle fodder crop Leucaena (Leguminosae:
   Mimosoideae). The interaction between the psyllid and three varieties of
   its Leucaena host plant was investigated in relation to the apparent
   resistance of some Leucaena varieties (Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena
   pallida and their hybrids) to attack.
   2 Field trials demonstrated that adult psyllids distinguished among the
   different varieties of Leucaena over a distance, and were attracted to
   L. leucocephala in significantly higher numbers than to L. pallida or to
   the hybrid. Pesticide treatment increased the attractiveness of Leucaena
   plants, even of those deemed to be psyllid resistant. Numbers of psyllid
   eggs and nymphs, sampled in the field, reflect the arrival rates of
   adults at the three plant varieties.
   3 Wavelength reflectance data of the three Leucaena varieties were not
   significantly different from one another, suggesting that psyllids
   cannot discriminate among the three plants using brightness or
   wavelength cues. There was a differential release of caryophyllene among
   the three varieties. Release of caryophyllene in L. leucocephala and the
   hybrid appeared to be influenced by environmental conditions.
   4 Experiments demonstrated that caryophyllene (at least on its own) did
   not influence the behaviour of leucaena psyllids in relation to leucaena
   plants.
   5 The results suggest that host plant volatiles cannot be dismissed as
   significant in the interaction between the leucaena psyllid and its
   Leucaena host plants. Further avenues for investigation are recommended
   and these are related to novel ways of understanding resistance in
   insect plant inter-relationships.},

Abstract = {The legume species Sesbania virgata establishes a specific and efficient
   symbiosis with Azorhizobium doebereinerae. Previous studies have shown
   that A. doebereinerae occurrence correlates to the presence of S.
   virgata. This work aimed to evaluate the occurrence of A. doebereinerae
   and of other nitrogen-fixing Leguminosae-nodulating bacteria (NFLNB) in
   soil samples collected adjacent to and 10 m away from the stems of five
   S. virgata plants in pasture areas. Symbiotic characteristics of
   isolates from these NFLNB populations were also studied. S. virgata and
   the four promiscuous legume species Leucaena leucocephala, Macroptilium
   atropurpureum, Phaseolus vulgaris and Vigna unguiculata were inoculated
   with soil samples to trap A. doebereinerae and other NFLNB. NFLNB
   capable of inducing nodulation in at least one of these legumes were
   found in all samples. M. atropurpureum was the most promiscuous species,
   as it trapped the highest number of NFLNB cultural types from soil
   suspensions. The other species were less promiscuous in the following
   order: V. unguiculata, P. vulgaris, and L. leucocephala. Isolates of the
   promiscuous legumes were classified into seven cultural groups. One of
   these groups, isolated from all promiscuous species, showed fast-growth
   alkali-reaction in culture medium (like Azorhizobium); it was identified
   as Cupriavidus. This is the first report of symbiosis of Cupriavidus
   with Papilionoideae species. The symbiotic efficiency of promiscuous
   hosts with NFLNB varied, but it was always less than that of controls
   with mineral nitrogen or an inoculant strain. S. virgata was efficiently
   nodulated only by A. doebereinerae, which occurred mainly in samples
   collected close to the plant stem, corroborating a high stimulus by its
   host species. A high diversity of NFLNB occurs as saprophytes close to
   the S. virgata root system.},

Abstract = {A major production constraint in and and semiarid areas of Ethiopia is a
   lack of water for crop growth. Run off water can be harvested by
   channeling it into micro- catchments (MC) where it slowly infiltrates
   into the soil. The increased moisture provides more plant growth in
   these dry lands. An experiment using MC was conducted in eastern
   Ethiopia to study the growth of four multipurpose tree species
   intercropped with grass. Trees and grass were grown in 25 m(2) and 100
   m(2) MC. Plant height, root collar diameter, and mortality rate of trees
   were determined 12 months after planting. Dry matter yield of grasses
   and trees were measured and nutrient analysis of plant tissues was
   determined. In a separate experiment the biomass of trees was determined
   after 2.5 years of continuous growth without grass competition. Soil
   moisture, organic matter, texture and bulk density of the soils were
   also determined. Mean tree height was 10\% greater in the 100 m(2) than
   in the 25 m(2) MC. Root collar diameter and survival rate showed similar
   increase with 13\% and 7.8\% respectively. Acacia saligna and Leucaena
   leucocephala showed better growth in both plot sizes than the indigenous
   Acacia seyal and Acacia tortilis. The. dry matter yield of grass
   (Panicum maximum) was over 12 tons/ha and 8 tons/ha in the 100 m(2) and
   25 m(2) plots respectively. Soil moisture content was greater in MC than
   in control plots with no water harvesting structures with 31\% and 24\%
   during the wet and dry seasons respectively. The use of water harvesting
   can improve fodder production and carrying capacity of the dry lands of
   Ethiopia.},

Abstract = {We describe the isolation and characterization of alfalfa-nodulating
   rhizobia from acid soils of different locations in Central Argentina and
   Uruguay, A collection of 465 isolates was assembled, and the rhizobia
   were characterized for acid tolerance, Growth tests revealed the
   existence of 15 acid-tolerant (AT) isolates which were able to grow at
   pH 5.0 and formed nodules in alfalfa with a low rate of nitrogen
   fixation, Analysis of those isolates, including partial sequencing of
   the genes encoding 16S rRNA and genomic PCR-fingerprinting with MBOREP1
   and BOXC1 primers, demonstrated that the new isolates share a genetic
   background closely related to that of the previously reported Rhizobium
   sp. Or191 recovered from an acid soil in Oregon (B. D. Eardly, J. P.
   Young, and R. K. Selander, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58:1809-1815,
   1992), Growth curves, melanin production, temperature tolerance, and
   megaplasmid profiles of the AT isolates were all coincident with these
   characteristics in strain Or191, In addition to the ability of all of
   these strains to nodulate alfalfa (Medicago sativa) inefficiently, the
   AT isolates also nodulated the common bean and Leucaena leucocephala,
   showing an extended host range for nodulation of legumes. In alfalfa,
   the time course of nodule formation by the AT isolate LPU 83 showed a
   continued nodulation restricted to the emerging secondary roots, which
   was probably related to the low rate of nitrogen fixation by the largely
   ineffective nodules, Results demonstrate the complexity of the rhizobial
   populations present in the acidic soils represented by a main group of
   N-2-fixing rhizobia and a second group of ineffective and
   less-predominant isolates related to the AT strain Or191.},

Abstract = {Seasonal variation in the feeding behaviour of Jamunapari and Barbari
   goat breeds and their utilization of browse and grass nutrients was
   evaluated in a promising three-tier (Acacia nilotica-leucaena
   leucocephala-Cenchrus ciliaris) reconstituted pasture during the winter,
   summer and rainy season of the years 1987, 1988 and 1990. A distinct
   diurnal pattern of feeding was observed with both breeds, and they spent
   more time foraging (P < 0.05) during the rainy season (504.9 min) than
   in the winter (376.5 min) or summer (266.9 min). Preference of grazing
   goats for certain plant species in relation to others was evident, with
   distinct seasonal variations. Goats spent more time (52.9-62.0\%) on
   browse during summer and the rainy season, while in winter they spent
   more of their foraging time on grasses (52.0-61.9\%). Among the browse
   species, A. nilotica was preferred over L. leucocephala in all seasons
   irrespective of breed. DM intake (g per kg BW0.75) varied widely (P <
   0.05) from season to season, with minimal values in summer (49.2-52.8)
   that increased to 68.5-69.7 in winter and 84.3 in the rainy season.
   There was no breed difference in DM intake or proximate composition and
   nutrient digestibility of ingested herbage. Available nutrient content
   of ingested forage was found to be sufficient to meet nutrient
   requirements of adult goats for maintenance (NRC, 1981). Reconstituted
   three-tier pasture dominated by native plant species such as A. nilotica
   and Cenchrus species appears to have the potential to sustain the
   nutrient requirements of goats without adverse seasonal fluctuations in
   pasture quality. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Title = {Evaluation of the productivity and feed value of Wondergraze and
   Redlands leucaena cultivars under grazing},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {63},

Pages = {450-462},
Abstract = {Context. Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a leguminous shrub used for
   beef grazing in low-rainfall regions (< 600-700 mm). Newer cultivars
   have the potential to extend adoption of the species to higher rainfall
   (> 600-700 mm), frost-free areas of Australia. Aim. We compared
   productivity, nutritional value and animal performance of two leucaena
   cultivars, new psyllid-resistant Redlands and the 2010-released
   Wondergraze, under continuous grazing management in a higher rainfall
   environment. Methods. Growing steers were allocated to replicated
   established stands of Wondergraze or Redlands with inter-row mixed
   grass-legume pasture from January to July 2021. Pasture and leucaena
   were characterised for biomass and nutritive characteristics. Botanical
   composition was measured. Liveweight gain, rumen fermentation, and
   leucaena mimosine breakdown products were measured in grazing steers.
   Key results. At the beginning of the study, leucaena edible biomass was
   similar for both cultivars (P > 0.05), but at subsequent samplings,
   biomass of Redlands was lower than of Wondergraze (P < 0.01). Biomass of
   both cultivars declined rapidly over the grazing period. Pasture biomass
   increased between February and July and was significantly higher in
   Wondergraze paddocks (P < 0.05). Animal performance was not
   significantly different between cultivar treatments, averaging 0.8
   kg/day, but declined over time. Patterns of mimosine conversion to DHP
   isomers and their conjugation were similar for the two cultivars,
   suggesting that effectiveness of detoxification did not differ between
   them. Conclusion. The results demonstrate that leucaena can sustain high
   levels of animal performance when included in tropical grass pastures in
   a higher rainfall environment if present in a sufficient quantity (> 2 t
   leucaena edible dry matter/ha established leucaena).},

Abstract = {Degraded sites like mine spoils on hillslopes are characterized by poor
   soil physico-chemical environments and instability. Reclamation of such
   areas using low cost bioengineering and vegetative methods were carried
   out in an abandoned limestone mine in the lower western Indian Himalayas
   and the impact of these measures on vegetation diversity, secondary
   succession and growth of seeded Acacia catechu Willd. after two decades
   of protection are reported in this paper. Results reveal that
   introduction of fast growing leguminous species affected species
   diversity and hampered the regeneration and growth of native vegetation,
   due to the dense shade of the over-storey component. Species diversity
   (H') levels increased with the opening of the canopy at different
   elevations, with the highest diversity (1.624) being recorded on the
   hilltop with Acacia catechu and Wedlandia exserta dominating the area.
   Enumeration of various species in the growth stages indicated a large
   population in the pole stage followed by tree and sapling stage
   indicating scattered regeneration mostly by 1-2 species. Tree
   associations in the lower, middle and upper reaches were of Leucaena
   leucocephala-A. catechu, A. catechu-Boehemeria rugulosa and A.
   catechu-W. exserta, respectively. Seeded A. catechu plants now in the
   tree stage have attained an average height of 5.5 m and dbh of 10.44 cm
   with an average wood volume of 0.027 m3 in a period of 16-21 years. At
   current prices of heartwood (US \$435 per m(3)) of A. catechu which is
   used in the manufacture of `kattha', the investments made two decades
   ago (US\$ 13043) in the rehabilitation of the limestone mine are fairly
   justified. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Declining crop productivity is a major challenge facing smallholder
   farmers in central highlands of Kenya. This decline is caused by
   continuous cultivation of soils without adequate addition of external
   inputs in form of manures and fertilizers. With this background, an
   on-station trial was initiated at Embu in 1992 to evaluate the
   feasibility of using two leguminous shrubs; Calliandra calothyrsus and
   Leucaena leucocephala for improving food production. In 2000, an
   off-station farmers' participatory trial aimed at offering farmers soil
   enhancing technologies for replenishing soil fertility was established
   in Meru South District. The results from the Embu on-station trial
   indicate that, over the I I years of study, calliandra and leucaena
   biomass transfer with half recommended rate of inorganic fertilizer
   treatments gave the best average maize grain yields of 3.3 Mg ha(-1).
   Treatment where calliandra was alley cropped with maize but the prunings
   removed recorded the lowest maize yield of 1.2 Mg ha(-1). Treatments
   with calliandra and leucana biomass transfer had similar yields but
   treatments that were alley cropped with leucaena did better than those
   that were alley cropped with calliandra. On the other hand, results from
   the off-station trial in Meru South indicate that, on average, across
   the seven seasons, sole tithonia gave the highest maize grain yield
   followed closely by tithonia with half recommended rate of inorganic
   fertilizer with 6.4 and 6.3 Mg ha(-1) respectively. Control gave the
   lowest yield of 2.2 Mg ha(-1) across the seasons. On average,
   integration of organic an inorganic sources of nutrients gave higher
   yields compared to all the other treatments.},

Abstract = {To rehabilitate a degraded Alfisol at Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria,
   Senna siamea (non-N-fixing legume tree), Leucaena leucocephala, and
   Acacia leptocarpa (N-fixing legume trees) were planted in 1989, and
   Acacia auriculiformis (N-fixing legume tree) in 1990. Pueraria
   phaseoloides (a cover crop) and natural fallow were included as
   treatments. Litterfall and climatic variables were measured in 1992/1993
   and 1996/1997 while biomass production and nutrient concentrations were
   measured in 1993 and 1995. Total litter production from the natural and
   planted fallows was similar, with means ranging from 10.0 (L.
   leucocephala) to 13.6 t ha(-1) y(-1) (natural fallow) during the
   1996/1997 collection. Leaves constituted 73\% (L. leucocephala) to 96\%
   (A. auriculiformis) of total litterfall. Acacia auriculiformis grew most
   quickly but S. siamea produced the highest aboveground biomass which was
   127 t ha(-1) accumulated over four years, and 156 t ha(-1) accumulated
   over six years of establishment. The aboveground biomass of P.
   phaseoloides and natural fallow was only 6 to 9 t ha(-1) at six years
   after planting. Nitrogen concentration in the leaves/twigs of was 2.5\%
   for L. leucocephala, and 2\% for other planted species and natural
   fallow. Pueraria phaseoloides had concentrations of P, K, Ca and Mg
   comparable to levels in the leaves/twigs of the tree species. Through
   PATH analysis, it was found that maximum temperature and minimum
   relative humidity had pronounced direct and indirect effects on
   litterfall. The effects of these climatic variables in triggering
   litterfall were enhanced by other variables, such as evaporation, wind,
   radiation, and minimum temperature. Improvement in chemical properties
   by fallows was observed in the degraded soil.},

Abstract = {In a field trial using a continuous function design, CaCO3 was applied
   to a N deficient Hawaiian Oxisol at rates of 0-22 tons/ha, producing a
   gradient in soil pH of 4.7-7.1. Inoculated legumes representing 18 spp.
   were grown. Lime response curves showed no distinct general difference
   between tropical and temperate legumes. Within each group, individual
   species varied. Responsiveness rankings of species varied depending on
   criterion of response. The species ranked as followed according to the
   amount of lime needed for 90\% of the maximum attained yield: Coronilla

   S. fruticosa, S. guyanensis, V. sinensis (30-50\%). Improved Ca
   availability could account for plant responses to lime rates over 3-4
   tons/ha. Only 4 tons CaCO3 sufficed to raise soil pH to 6 and depress
   solution Al and Mg to low concentrations, but 6 tons were needed to
   raise soluble Ca to 1 meq/1 and 20 tons to raise it to 3 meq/l.},

   {[}berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.)-sorghum {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.)

   (Lam.) de Wit as sole crop, berseem-sorghum with Sesbania and
   berseem-sorghum with Leucaena hedgerows] were assessed under 3 moisture
   regimes (irrigation at 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 irrigation water(60 mm
   depth)/cumulative pan evaporation ratio). The green biomass (187
   tonnes/ha), dry matter (32 tonnes/ha) and crude protein (4.75 tonnes/ha)
   yields were significantly higher in a berseem-sorghum alley crop
   sequence with Leucaena hedgerows followed by the same alley crop
   sequence with Sesbania hedgerows. The berseem-sorghum alley sequence
   with Leucaena hedgerows provided green fodder for a longer duration
   including lean periods. The Sesbania species was found more sensitive to
   pruning and higher mortality was recorded in Sesbania. Irrigation at 0.5
   to 0.75 irrigation water (60 mm depth)/cumulative pan evaporation ratio
   significantly increased the green biomass, dry matter and crude protein
   yields. Further increases did not increase the yields significantly. The
   water use efficiency decreased with increasing soil moisture. Green
   biomass yield during third growing season was higher (230 tonnes/ha) in
   the berseem-sorghum crop sequence alley with Leucaena hedgerows
   irrigated at 1.0 IW/CPE ratio. The annual soil moisture depletion was
   higher (172.1 cm) in this cropping system.},

   piscipula, Gliricidia sepium, and Cochlospermum vitifolium were
   germinated in steam-sterilized soil and either remained uninoculated
   (nonmycorrhizal at transplanting) or were inoculated with mycorrhizal
   fungi in soils from early-seral (recently burned) or late-seral (mature
   forest) inoculum. Inoculum from the early-seral soil was largely Glomus
   spp., whereas a diverse community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were
   reintroduced from the mature forest including species of Scutellospora,
   Gigaspora, Glomus, Sclerocystis, and Acaulospora. Plants grew better
   when associated with the mature forest inoculum, unlike a previous
   experiment in which plants grew taller with the early-seral inoculum.
   Reasons for the different responses include a less-intense burn
   resulting in more residual organic matter. In addition to mycorrhizal
   responses, plants were severely affected by deer browsing. One tree
   species, C. vitifolium found in the region but not in the reserve, was
   eliminated by a resident fungal facultative pathogen. Several practical
   conclusions for restoration can be made. The common nursery practice of
   soil sterilization may be detrimental because it eliminates beneficial
   mycorrhizal fungi; species not native to the site may not survive
   because they may not be adapted to the local pathogens; and herbivory
   can be severe depending on the landscape context of the restoration.},

Abstract = {Phenotypic diversity was studied among 13 Rhizobium strains selected
   from a total of 160 Rhizobium isolates from root nodules of Leucaena
   leucocephala. Two strains from Acacia saligna and two strains from
   Sesbania sesban plants were included in the examination for host range
   in the greenhouse. The Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena) strains were different
   from the reference strains and fell into three distinct groups for the
   utilization of 95 different carbon sources. Four of the best symbionts
   constituted a group, the majority of the strains fell into a second
   group, and strain DS 91 was the only member of the third group. Strains
   were effective symbionts for their original hosts. Nine strains were
   tolerant to elevated temperature (>42 degrees C), and three strains were
   resistant to high salinity (>3\% NaCl). All Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena)
   strains effectively nodulated L. leucocephala and L. culensii, but
   nitrogen fixation was greater with L. leucocephala than with L.
   culensii. These strains failed to form effective symbioses with two
   other species of Leucaena (L. retusa and L. divursiflora) or with
   alfalfa, Medicago sativa. Rhizobium sp. (Leucaena) strains DS 65, DS 78,
   and DS 158 nodulated and efficiently fixed nitrogen with Phaseolus
   vulgaris, with DS 65 showing the highest symbiotic capability. Strain DS
   65 also nodulated and fixed nitrogen with Glycine max and Vigna
   sinensis. Nodulation of Leucaena by two Bradyrhizobium sp. (Acacia)
   strains was sparse. Strain DS 101 from Sesbania formed nodules on
   Leucaena, whereas the other strain from Sesbania, DS 110, failed to
   nodulate this genus.},

Abstract = {The dual-purpose function (livestock feed and soil improvement) of
   tropical forage legumes in general, is highlighted. Forage shrubs and
   trees that offer the advantage of additional purposes (fuelwood and
   others) are most useful for smallholder production systems and are
   suggested to have a higher potential to persist under grazing than
   herbaceous plants. The most widely used species, Leucaena leucocephala
   and Gliricidia sepium, however, are not adapted to the very acid, highly
   Al-saturated Oxisols and Ultisols that cover vast areas of the subhumid
   and humid tropics. Evaluation within the forage genetic resources
   collection kept at CIAT, Colombia, has shown that several, relatively
   unknown species grow well on such soils: Flemingia macrophylla, Cratylia
   argentea, a still undescribed Calliandra species, Desmodium velutinum,
   Tadehagi triquetrum, and Codariocalyx gyroides. Although their yield
   potential is considerably lower than that of the trees Leucaena or
   Gliricidia on non-acid soils, some agronomic characteristics of these
   species such as drought resistance, tolerance to insect pests and
   diseases, leafiness, and regrowth potential, are outstanding. However,
   the forage value of most species is severely constrained by high
   contents of condensed tannins that are associated with digestibilities
   as low as 20\% and lack of acceptability by grazing livestock, mainly
   during the rainy season. Cratylia argentea and Desmodium velutinum, in
   part also Codariocalyx gyroides, are exceptions and warrant further
   research for their possible use in the humid tropics (C. argentea, C.
   gyroides) and subhumid tropics (C. argentea, D. velutinum). The chances
   for adoption of cut-and-carry forage technologies based on relatively
   low-yielding species are discussed and a series of research topics is
   suggested.},

Abstract = {This study examined the tunneling activity and the behaviour of two
   subterranean termites, Globitermes sulphurues and Coptotermes gestroi
   treated with four plant extracts, namely Pyllanthus niruri, Azadirachta
   indica, Leucaena leucocephala and Andrographis paniculata. All plants
   were extracted with three different solvents (methanol, hexane and
   water) and were diluted into three concentrations (500, 5,000 and 10,000
   ppm). A group of 50 workers and 2 soldiers were tested and observed
   daily during the exposure in order to determine their survivorship and
   behaviour. Both sections were scored to determine their tunneling
   activities after seven days. There was a significant difference of
   tunneling activities of C. gestroi on sand treated with plant extracts
   (X-2(2) = 31.790, p < 0.0001) with a mean rank of 8.50 for methanolic
   extracts and 32.50 for both hexane and water extracts. Meanwhile, no
   significant difference was observed on tunneling activity of G.
   sulphurous on treated sand (X-2(2) = 2.200, p = 0.333) with a mean rank
   of 20.72 for methanolic extracts, 26.31 for water extracts and 26.47 for
   hexane extracts. Results showed that plants extracted with methanol
   demonstrated strong repellent properties with 0 tunneling activity on
   the treated sand and low survivorship of both termites. Moreover, both
   termites did not survive (0\%) when they were treated with methanolic
   extracts at 10,000 ppm. They also displayed a different behaviour
   post-exposure such as avoidance, gradually losing the ability to walk
   and low feeding consumption. These results indicate that there is a
   strong termiticidal activity of plants extracted with methanol against
   C. gestroi and G. sulphureus.},

Abstract = {Four adult goats (mean body weight 29.0 +/- 2.65 kg) were fed Dicanthium
   annulatum - Leucaena leucocephala (DA-LL) and Dicanthium annulatum -
   Hardwickia binata (DA-HB) in 50:50 ratio in switch-over experiment to

   Entodiniomopha were the most dominant (88.0\%) rumen protozoa on both

Journal = {BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {182-195},
Abstract = {A litter bag technique was used to study the decomposition and release
   of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg from Leucaena leucocephala and L. pallida
   prunings and cattle manure in a hedgerow intercropping trial conducted
   in the Ethiopian highlands. Hedgerow intercropping (also called alley
   cropping or alley farming) is an agroforestry system in which trees are
   grown in dense hedges between alleys where short-cycle crops are grown.
   The hedges are pruned periodically during the cropping period and the
   prunings are added to the soil as green manure. Manure was the most
   resistant to decomposition, losing only 15\% of its dry matter (DM) in
   15 weeks, compared to 41-57\% lost by Leucaena prunings. Large
   quantities of K (up to 104 kg ha(-1)) were mineralized from prunings and
   manure, but Ca and Mg were mostly immobilized. More N and P were
   released From prunings than from manure, which resulted in net
   immobilization of these nutrients in the initial stages of decomposition
   and net mineralization in later stages. Between the leucaenas more N was
   mineralized and less Ca and Mg were immobilized when L. leucocephala
   prunings were applied than when L. pallida prunings were applied.
   Fertilizer N increased DM decomposition and N mineralization.
   Mineralization of the nutrients was constrained by lignin and polyphenol
   contents. It is concluded that leucaena mulch and cattle manure may be
   significant sources of N and K for crop growth, but external sources of
   P, Ca and Mg may be required, particularly in acid soils which have low
   contents of these nutrients. However, this fertility effect has to be
   evaluated against the competition effect of trees to predict crop
   response.},

Abstract = {A study was conducted at Fasola (7 degrees 45' N and 3 degrees 5' E) in

   Guinea grass (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Ntchisi) mixture. After a
   uniform cut at the end of January 1990 (mid-dry season), the trees were
   cut according to the following cutting regimes: one cut after a 12-month
   regrowth (12M); two cuts after three- and nine-month regrowth (3-9M);
   two cuts every six months (6-6M); two cuts after nine- and three-month
   regrowth (9-3M); three cuts, two cuts every three months and the third
   cut after a six-month regrowth (3-3-6M), and four cuts every three
   months (3-3-3-3M). Grass was cut every six weeks between April and
   October followed by a cut in January. The hedge configuration was either
   one or three hedgerows of mixed stands of leucaena and gliricidia. There
   were twice as many trees and one-third less grass in the triple than in
   the single hedgerow hedge configuration.
   The 3-3-3-3M, 9-3M and 3-3-6M cutting regimes produced the highest total
   forage (tree foliage + grass) dry matter yields (DM) of 6.54, 5.80 and
   5.77 t DM ha(-1) annum(-1), respectively. The magnitude of the
   difference between the tree forage yields of the triple and single

Abstract = {In the current experiment we compared the effect of several green manure
   legumes incorporated into soil on the production of cabbage. The green
   manure legumes used were Cassia mimosoides, Cassia occidentalis, Cassia
   tora, Crotalaria juncea, Flemingia congesta, Glycine max, Leucaena
   leucocephala, and Sesbania cannabina. Biomass production of green manure
   legumes was higher in the following order: C. tora > Crotalaria > G. max
   > S. cannabina > C. occidentalis > F. congesta > C. mimosoides > L.
   leucocephala. Mineral uptake also varied among the plant species.
   Incorporation of the green manure legumes increased the production of
   cabbage grown in the bed as succeeding crop, and the highest production
   was obtained by the incorporation of C. occidentalis. Nitrogen,
   phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium concentrations in cabbage decreased
   by the incorporation of green manure while the calcium concentration
   increased. There was no clear correlation between the amount of N taken
   up by the green manure legumes and the production of cabbage crop. This
   phenomenon suggests that some factors other than nitrogen accumulation
   may affect the production of the succeeding crop. On the other hand, a
   significant positive correlation was observed between the potassium
   uptake by the green manure crops and the increase of cabbage production.
   Incorporation of green manure legumes also played an important role in
   the maintenance of soil minerals. Cabbage production showed a
   significant negative correlation with EC and a positive correlation with
   the potassium content in soil after harvest. This experiment indicated
   that the incorporation of green manure legumes was not only effective
   for the production of the succeeding crop but also for the maintenance
   of some plant nutrients like inorganic nitrogen and available
   phosphorus.},

Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {225-239},
Abstract = {In the national greenhouse inventory, methane emissions from the
   Australian tropical beef herd are derived from cattle fed two diets. In
   the experiments reported here, methane production was measured by
   open-circuit gas exchange from 13 Brahman cattle offered 22 diets from
   combinations of five tropical grass species and five legumes, with a
   minimum of three steers per diet. All diets were offered daily ad
   libitum, with the exception of three legume diets fed without grass and
   leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) mixed with grass, which were offered at
   15 g dry matter per kg liveweight. Diets were fed as long-chopped dried
   hay, with the exception of leucaena, which was harvested and fed within
   2 days. For the data from cattle fed diets of grass and grass mixed with
   legumes, methane production could be predicted as 19.6 g/kg forage dry
   matter intake (residual standard deviation 12.3). Observed methane
   yields were not predictable from a stoichiometry, which used volatile
   fatty acid proportions in rumen fluid. Mean methane emission rates
   across all diets were equivalent to 8.6-13.4\% of digestible energy
   intake, and 5.0-7.2\% of gross energy intake. The latter values are
   comparable to IPCC (2006) recommendations (5.5-7.5\%) for large
   ruminants fed low-quality crop residues and by-products. Methane yields
   per unit of ingested dry matter or digested organic matter were variable
   across diets but were related to digestibility and contents of fibre and
   protein. These results constitute a significant downward revision of the
   methane emissions attributable to the northern Australian beef herd
   grazing tropical pastures.},

Title = {The effect of plant succession on slope stability},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {139-147},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The aim of this field investigation was to study the enrichment of
   biodiversity of the slope at an early phase of succession, initiated by
   selected pioneers, and to study how this enrichment related to
   enhancement of the slope stability. Four experimental plots, with
   differing plant pioneers and number of species (diversity), were
   designed in order to assess the effects of plant succession on slope
   stability. Plant growth pattern was assessed by observing the increment
   in species diversity (number), species frequency and plant biomass.
   Higher vegetation biomass in a mixed culture situation (LLSS) in the
   field with Leucaena leucocephala as a pioneer, marked an increase in
   species diversity after 24 months of observation. In contrast, G
   (grasses and legume creepers) plot revealed the slowest rate of
   succession and the lowest above-ground biomass amongst the plots. The
   mixed-culture plot without L. leucocephala (SS) had also shown a lower
   biomass, a similar phenomenon observed in a plot grown by L.
   leucocephala (LL) with low plant diversity. Consequently, these plant
   growth patterns gave a positive effect on slope stability where the
   regression study showed that the shear strength was much affected by
   plant biomass. Meanwhile, throughout the succession process in LLSS
   plot, root length density reached the highest value amongst the plots,
   23 Km m(-3). In relation to this, the saturation level of the slope

Abstract = {Leaf and root (tuber) nutrient uptake patterns of cassava (Manihot
   esculenta Crantz) alley-cropped with gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium),
   leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), and senna {[}(Senna (syn. Cassia)
   siamea] as influenced by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM)
   inoculation in a degraded Alfisol were investigated in 3 consecutive
   years. The cassava plants were mulched with fresh prunings of each
   hedgerow tree species at 2-month intervals in the second and third years
   of alley cropping. While VAM inoculation significantly influenced the
   root uptake of nutrients, the leaf uptake was not affected except for
   the uptake of P. In most cases, there was no difference in the nutrient
   concentration between inoculated and uninoculated plants, either in the
   leaf or in the root, indicating that the productivity of cassava was
   regulated by the amount of nutrients the roots could absorb. In spite of
   similar total soil N in all inoculated and uninoculated alley-cropped
   cassava plots and similar exchangeable soil K contents in inoculated and
   uninoculated alley-cropped cassava plots with leucaena and senna,
   greater uptake of N, P, and K and greater concentrations of K were
   observed in roots of inoculated alley-cropped cassava with gliricidia
   and leucaena than with senna. These results indicated that greater
   mineralization and availability of nutrients to cassava roots from
   prunings of nodulating gliricidia and leucaena than from non-nodulating
   senna may be important, particularly with efficient VAM inoculation, in
   these alley-cropping systems. Also, for similar nutrients in the
   inoculated and uninoculated cassava soils alley-cropped with each
   hedgerow species, VAM inoculation significantly enhanced cassava root
   dry weights, indicating that an effective VAM fungus can be an agent of
   greater nutrient uptake in a competitive environment.},

   effective than traditional crops on eroded marginal soil and hence
   suggested for inclusion in the basket of conservation technologies.},

Abstract = {Leaf meals (LMs) from freshly harvested leaves of butterfly pea
   (Centrosema pubescens), devil bean (Mucuna pruriens), flamboyant flower
   (Delonix regia), Bauhinia tomentosa, coast wattle (Acacia
   auriculiformis), quick stick (Glyricidia sepium) and ipil-ipil (Leucaena
   leucocephala) were analysed for their nutrient and anti-nutritional
   content. Then, leaf protein concentrates (LPCs) were produced from the
   leaves by fractionation and characterised along with the fibrous
   residues. On average, the LM contained 181 g kg(-1) dry matter (DM) CP
   (range: 100-280 gkg(-1) DM), 139 gkg(-1) DM crude fibre (range: 77-230
   gkg(-1) DM) and 133 gkg(-1) DM ether extract (range: 86-165gkg(-1) DM)
   while the gross energy averaged 17.0MJkg(-1). On average, leaf protein
   fractionation enhanced the CP, ether extract and the gross energy in the
   LPC by 39.5\%, 33.5\% and 22.0\%, respectively, while the crude fibre of
   the LMs was reduced by 41\%, on average, in the LPCs. Fractionation
   reduced the mineral content of the leaves generally. The mean phytin
   content varied from 0.36 gkg(-1) in LPCs to 0.86 gkg(-1) in leaf meal,
   while the mean phytin-P content varied from 0.10 g kg(-1) in LPCs to
   0.24 gkg(-1) in leaf meal. The total phenol levels in the LMs were
   reduced by 33.7\% in the LPCs, on average. These results suggest that,
   while the LPCs from these plants could be used as protein supplements in
   non-ruminant feeds in regions where there is an acute shortage of plant
   protein, the LMs or LPC fibrous residues could be fed to ruminant
   animals.},

Abstract = {Macaranga tanarius is widely distributed in the abandoned lowlands of
   Taiwan where substantial amounts of leaves accumulate on the ground. A
   unique pattern of weed exclusion underneath trees is often found and
   thought to result from allelopathic interactions. Density-dependent
   phytotoxicity analysis of Lactuca sativa L. (lettuce) growing in soil
   mixed with the powder of M. tanarius leaves showed a significant
   deviation from the expected yield density relationship. Lettuce growth
   was most suppressed in the low seed density experiment suggesting that
   the phytotoxins produced during leaf decomposition inhibit the growth of
   lettuce seedlings. Bidens pilosa and Leucaena leucocephala, growing in
   soil mixed with the leaf powder of M. tanarius were also suppressed.
   Aqueous leaf extracts were bioassayed against lettuce and B. pilosa, and
   exhibited a significant suppression in radicle growth. Compounds
   identified from leaves included nymphaeol-A (1), nymphaeol-B (2),
   nymphaeol-C (3), quercetin (4), abscisic acid (ABA) (5), blumenol A (6),
   blumenol B (7), roseoside II (8), tanariflavanone A (9), and
   tanariflavanone B (10). ABA was the major growth inhibitor. At
   concentrations of 20 ppm, ABA suppressed lettuce germination, while at
   120 ppm it inhibited the growth of Miscanthus floridulus, Chloris
   barbata, and Bidens pilosa. At 600 ppm, quercetin, blumenol A, and
   blumenol B, caused 20-25\% inhibition of radicle and shoot growth of M.
   floridulus. The amount of ABA in M. tanarius leaves was approximately
   3-5 mug g(-1) dry weight, significantly higher than previously reported.
   We conclude that the pattern of weed exclusion underneath stands of M.
   tanarius and its invasion into its adjacent grassland vegetation results
   from allelopathic interactions.},

Abstract = {Key message Iron deficiency conditions as well as iron supplied as a
   Fe(III)-mimosine complex induced a number of strategy I and strategy II
   genes for iron uptake in leucaena. Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a
   tree-legume that can grow in alkaline soils, where metal-cofactors like
   Fe(III) are sparingly available. Mimosine, a known chelator of Fe(III),
   may facilitate Fe(III) uptake in leucaena by serving as a
   phytosiderophore. To test if mimosine can serve as a phytosiderophore,
   three sets of experiments were carried out. First, the binding
   properties and solubility of metal-mimosine complexes were assessed
   through spectrophotometry. Second, to study mimosine uptake in plants,
   pole bean, common bean, and tomato plants were supplied with mimosine
   alone and metal-mimosine complexes. Third, the expression of strategy I
   (S1) and strategy II (S2) genes for iron uptake from the soil was
   studied in leucaena plants exposed to different Fe(III) complexes. The
   results of this study show that (i) mimosine has high binding affinity
   for metallic cations at alkaline pH, Fe(III)-mimosine complexes are
   water soluble at alkaline pH, and that mimosine can bind soil iron under
   alkaline pH; (ii) pole bean, common bean, and tomato plants can uptake
   mimosine and transport it throughout the plant; and (iii) a number of S1
   and S2 genes were upregulated in leucaena under iron-deficiency
   condition or when Fe(III) was supplied as a Fe(III)-mimosine complex.
   These findings suggest that leucaena may utilize both S1 and S2
   strategies for iron uptake; and mimosine may play an important role in
   both strategies.},

Abstract = {During a 720-d experiment in a Holstein and Brown Swiss herd, two
   feeding regimens were compared during the grazing phase of dry cow
   management until confinement before expected calving. The two treatments
   involved rotational grazing (24-d cycles) at a stocking rate of 2.5
   animals per hectare in: (A) all-grass swards or (B) all-grass plus 3 h
   daily access to swards of Leucaena leucocephala and grasses. Large
   heifers were added as needed to maintain constant group size at pasture.
   A daily supplement of 2 kg/head of bulky concentrate was fed. During the
   first 19 mo of the study, while rainfall was adequate, dry cows in
   treatments A and B gained live weight (LW) satisfactorily (0.69 +/- 0.26
   and 0.67 +/- 0.23 kg/d) and increased in body condition score (BCS) on a
   scale of 1 to 5 at rates of 0.40 and 0.34 point/100 d, respectively.
   During the final 5 mo, pasture conditions and LW gains were poor because
   of prolonged drought. Monthly rainfall of 50 mm or more maintained
   grazing conditions adequate for use with the present level of
   supplemental feeding. There were no differences (P > 0.05) between
   treatments. Under common postpartum management, standard 305-d
   lactational milk yields were unaffected by previous treatments A or B.
   However, a positive trend (P < 0.10) was associated with higher
   prepartum BCS. Cows that scored <3.0, 3.0, 3.25, 3.5 and >3.5 produced
   4,013; 4,111; 4,367; 4,627 and 4,450 kg, respectively. Postcalving
   reproductive performance was not affected by previous treatment or by
   BCS prepartum or BCS at 6 wk postpartum.},

   HEDGEROW INTERCROPPING},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {143-158},
Abstract = {The paper describes a tree/crop interface (TCI) experiment designed to
   investigate the effects of row orientation using Leucaena leucocephala
   Lam.  Each TCI plot consisted of a regularly pruned Leucaena hedge in
   the middle and 12 crop rows on either side.  Eight such plots were
   arranged at 45-degrees around a sole Leucaena plot with rows oriented in
   four compass directions viz., North-South, East-West,
   Northeast-Southwest and Northwest-Southeast.
   Results of four years from 1984 to 1987 did not show any effect of row
   orientation, and similarly, no effect was seen on crop rows due to their
   location on the windward or leeward side of the hedge.  The TCI effect
   was positive on the first crop row in the first year because Leucaena
   grew slowly, but depressed the yield of the first 4 to 6 crop rows (1.8
   to 2.7 m from hedge) in subsequent years.  The negative effect of
   Leucaena was noted more on sunflower in a relatively dry year than on
   sorghum in other years.
   Results from the TCI plots were used to estimate the yield of five
   hedgerow intercropping (HI) systems with varying alley widths (2.7 to
   9.9 m).  Comparison with sole stands of Leucaena and crops indicated
   that HI was more productive particularly at close alley widths.  For
   example, hedges spaced at 2.7 m and 3.6 m averaged 37\% and 25\% higher
   productivity than the respective sole stands; but this advantage may be
   an overestimation of the real potential.
   The relevance of TCI experiments for studying agroforestry systems,
   their merits and limitations, especially of the design employed in this
   study are discussed.},

Abstract = {Decomposition and N release pattern from the leaves of three shrubs
   species were studied under field conditions. Leaves of Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.), Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) and Moringa oleifera
   (Lam.) and two mixtures, Leucaena + Moringa and Leucaena + Guazuma, in a
   complete randomized block design, were studied during the dry and wet
   seasons. Litterbags were randomly distributed in each experimental block
   and placed on the soil surface, and residues were recovered after 2, 4,
   8, and 16 weeks. Double exponential model decay was better fitted to
   describe the pattern of the decay of the release of various leaf
   constituents. Litter dry weight loss and N release were faster from
   Moringa, followed by the Leucaena + Moringa mixture, while the Guazuma
   leaf litter decomposed much slower. In the wet period, a rapid N release
   was observed for Moringa (60\%) and Leucaena + Moringa (43\%) in the
   first two weeks. In contrast, Guazuma and the Leucaena + Guazuma mixture
   released about 46\% of N in 16 weeks. In the dry period, leaves released
   most of their N during the first 8 to 16 weeks. Moringa and Leucaena +
   Moringa ranked first, having lost 81 and 75\% of its initial N,
   respectively. The ratios of condensed tannin and polyphenols to N were
   significantly correlated with the N released. It was concluded that the
   initial mass loss from the leaf litter was high and rapid in the rainy
   period in comparison to the dry period. The residue disappearance
   pattern of Moringa, Leucaena and Leucaena + Moringa followed an
   asymptotic model, with more than 80\% of the original residue released

   with sugared water + 40 mL EM4 for 3 days, was used to grow maize fodder
   hydroponically. Four male Kacang goats (13.05 +/- 1.32 kg) were assigned
   to four dietary treatments in a 4x4 latin square design over four 15-day
   periods (10 days for adaption, 5 days for data collection). The
   treatments were: 60\% grass silage + 10\% Leucaena leucocephala + 30\%
   concentrate (control, FCG0); 30\% grass silage + 30\% hydroponic maize
   fodder + 10\% L. leucocephala + 30\% concentrate (FCG1); 15\% grass

   dry matter intake (152.48 g/day) compared to FCG0 (226.83 g/day).
   Nutrient digestibility, including organic matter and crude fiber,
   improved (p<0.05) in FCG3 (77.21\% and 66.12\%) compared to FCG0
   (76.62\% and 52.27\%). Total volatile fatty acids (VFA) increased in

   hydroponic maize fodder enriched with fermented compost tea up to 75\%
   of the diet improved digestibility and rumen fermentation without
   negatively affecting intake, digestibility, or blood metabolites in
   Kacang goats, suggesting its potential as an alternative feed. However,
   complete substitution (100\%) reduced intake, indicating challenges at
   higher substitution levels.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The seasonal dynamics of foliage arthropod populations are poorly
   studied in tropical dry forests despite the importance of these studies
   for understanding arthropod population responses to environmental
   change. We monitored the abundance, temporal distributions, and body
   size of arthropods in five naturalized alien and one native tree species
   to characterize arthropod seasonality in dry novel Prosopis-Leucaena
   woodlands in Puerto Rico. A branch clipping method was used monthly to
   sample foliage arthropod abundance over 39 mo. Seasonal patterns of
   rainfall and abundance within various arthropod taxa were highly
   variable from year to year. Abundance for most taxa did not show
   significant seasonality over the 3yr, although most taxa had abundance
   peaks each year. However, Homoptera displayed high seasonality with
   significant temporal aggregations in each year. Formicidae, Orthoptera,
   and Coleoptera showed high variation in abundance between wet and dry
   periods, whereas Hemiptera were consistently more abundant in the wet
   period. Seasonal differences in mean abundance were found only in a few
   taxa on Tamarindus indica L., Bucida buceras L., Pithecellobium dulce,
   and (Roxburgh) Benth. Mean arthropod abundance varied among tree
   species, with highest numbers on Prosopis juliflora, (Swartz) De
   Candolle, Pi. dulce, Leucaena leucocephala, and (Lamarck) de Wit.
   Abundance of Araneae, Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera larvae, and
   all arthropods showed weak relationships with one or more climatic
   variables (rainfall, maximum temperature, or relative humidity). Body
   size of arthropods was usually largest during the dry periods. Overall,
   total foliage arthropod abundance showed no consistent seasonality among
   years, which may become a more common trend in dry forests and woodlands
   in the Caribbean if seasonality of rainfall becomes less predictable.},

   respectively, when t(R) was estimated on the basis of the tensile root
   strength crossing through the shear plane. The shear strength increment
   provided by plant roots with conspicuous oblique and vertical roots was
   greater than that of root structures in which lateral roots were
   dominant In comparison with other types of root architecture, the R-type
   root architecture was found to be the most effective root system against
   shear failure in the soil Its shear strength increment was slightly
   greater than that with the V-type root architecture, followed by the
   VH-type root architecture The shear strength increment provided by
   plants with the H-type root architecture Was less effective than that

Abstract = {An on-farm trial was conducted to determine dry matter production of
   four fodder tree species and their effect on soil water and maize
   production. The trees were planted in rows intercropped with maize. The
   four tree species selected were Acacia karroo Hayne (indigenous fodder
   tree), Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit (nitrogen fixing), Morus alba
   L. (fodder and fruit), and Gleditsia triacanthos L. (fodder and fuel).
   Volumetric soil water was measured in the upper 0.3 m of soil in each
   row of the trial using the time domain reflectometry technique. The
   neutron probe technique was used for monitoring the water content deeper
   in the soil. Geostatistical methods were used to analyse treatment
   differences in the upper 0.3 m of soil. The soil water content did not
   differ significantly between the maize and tree rows indicating that
   competition for water in the upper horizon was not the reason for lower
   maize yields. However, at greater soil depths (75-125 cm) trees in the
   wide spacing used less water than those in the narrow spacing. Light
   interception was an important factor in reducing maize yields in the row
   nearest to the trees. High soil water values recorded during summer
   indicated that in the current cycle of good rainfall the plants in the
   agroforestry trial were not stressed. Thus the trees do not compete with
   the crops for soil moisture in good rainfall seasons. However, this
   study would need further evaluation for the competition for water for
   the low rainfall years. Since the trees have access to water at greater
   depths, they are likely to be more productive into the dry season than
   shallow rooted crops.},

Abstract = {On a sandy tropical soil, organic materials (prunings of Leucaena
   leucocephala, Senna siamea and maize stover) with contrasting C/N ratio
   (13, 18 and 56, respectively) were applied at the rate of 15 t
   ha(-1)a(-1) in order to increase the amount of soil organic matter. Two
   light fractions (LF1 = LF > 2 mm and LF2 = 0.25 mm < LF < 2 mm) and the
   heavy fraction (HF) of the soil organic matter pool were determined by
   means of a combined density/particle size fractionation procedure and
   data obtained were related to soil nitrogen mineralization under
   controlled conditions and to nitrogen uptake by maize under field
   conditions. Under controlled conditions and when the LF1 fraction was
   excluded, nitrogen mineralization was found not to be correlated to
   total organic carbon content in the soil (R-2 = 0.02). The R-2-value of
   the linear regression increased considerably, when amount and C/N ratio
   of the LF2 fraction was taken into account in the regression analysis
   (R-2 = 0.88). Under field conditions, a multiple linear regression with
   amount and C/N ratio of HF, LF1 and LF2 better explained variation in
   crop nitrogen content and nitrogen uptake of maize (R-2 = 0.78 and 0.94)
   than a simple linear regression with total organic carbon (R-2 = 0.48
   and 0.76). The results illustrate the importance of the two light and
   heavy organic matter fractions for estimating soil nitrogen
   mineralization. Determination of light and heavy soil organic matter
   fractions by density/particle size fractionation seems to be a promising
   tool to characterize functional pools of soil organic matter.},

Title = {Mine soil properties as influenced by tree species and topography of the
   re-vegetated coal mine overburden dump},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {233},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Re-vegetation or natural succession of plant species is an important
   factor of soil development in postmining overburden dumps. As the parent
   material (sedimentary rocks and regolith) is more or less uniform in the
   dump, the topographic position and vegetation are the major factors that
   affects the mine soil quality. Accordingly, this study was designed for
   a relative evaluation of the influence of dump topographical position
   (crest, backslope, toeslope) and tree species (Azadirachta indica,
   Cassia siamea, and Leucaena leucocephala) on soil quality. Trees growing
   on the toeslope of the dump were significantly taller with larger
   diameter at breast height than those at backslope or crest. Soil
   moisture, pH, total S, available P, and Fe content were significantly (P
   < 0.05) affected by topographical position of the dump. All these
   properties were higher in the toeslope, except S in the crest. Tree
   species affected all the soil properties, except electrical conductivity
   and Mn. Organic carbon content was significantly lower for the nitrogen
   fixer L. leucocephala (2.03 \%) than A. indica (3.30 \%) or C. siamea
   (3.39 \%). Soil dehydrogenase activity (39.79 mg TPF/24hr/kg) and
   microbial biomass carbon (286 mu g/g) was higher under L. leucocephala,
   and C. siamea, respectively. Based on redundancy analysis (RDA), 87.5 \%
   of the data variation is explained by the tree species, whereas, only
   12.5 \% by the topography. Principal component analysis revealed that C.
   siamea contributes significantly for the variation in soil properties of
   the dump. Re-vegetated plant species are a dominant factor of soil
   development in post mining dump than the topographical position. C
   siamea and the toeslope are closely associated with soil microbial
   biomass carbon. It is recommended to plant C. siamea with relatively
   higher planting density in crest and backslope than toeslope of the
   dump.},

Title = {Could more efficient utilization of ecosystem services improve soil
   quality indicators to allow sustainable intensification of Amazonian
   family farming?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {127},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the Amazonian periphery, there are sources of numerous disservices,
   including deforestation, loss of wildlife habitat and biodiversity
   erosion. However, there are great opportunities to adopt appropriate
   agricultural management practices to take advantage of the benefits of
   ecosystem services for sustainable agricultural intensification. Thus,
   the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of certain ecosystem
   services provided by combined use of legumes with residue of low- and
   high-quality on soil quality indicators, nitrogen use efficiency and
   sustainability of maize grain yield in infertile tropical soil. The
   overarching objective is to determine how ecosystem services can
   contribute to the improvement of land-use policy to ensure the
   sustainability of cultivated lands, in such a way that forest can be
   preserved by avoiding deforestation of other new areas through shifting
   cultivation systems. Four leguminous tree species were used, two with
   high-quality residues Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) and Gliricidia
   sepium (gliricidia) and two with low-quality residues Clitoria
   fairchildiana (clitoria) and Acacia mangium (acacia). Maize grain yield
   was evaluated between 2011 and 2017 in these treatments. In 2018, to
   assess how ecosystem services affect crop performance, the treatments
   were divided into ten treatments with and without urea. We conclude that
   increased uptake of inorganic and organic N by maize resulting from
   improvement of the soil quality indicators may allow agricultural
   intensification. This improvement can help meet the challenges of
   sustainability and feasibility of agroecosystems of the Amazonian
   periphery by making the agroecosystem more productive year by year.
   Therefore, our results confirm that the utilization of an ecosystem
   services style approach can help meet the challenges of sustainability
   and feasibility in agrosystems of the Amazonian periphery. In addition,
   these results can contribute to the development of land-use policy in
   the Amazonian periphery, aiming for the intensification of agriculture
   in cropped areas to avoid deforestation of new areas from shifting
   cultivation systems.},

Title = {Effects of rumen-degradable-to-undegradable protein ratio in ruminant
   diet on in vitro digestibility, rumen fermentation, and microbial
   protein synthesis},
Journal = {VETERINARY WORLD},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {640-648},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background and Aim: Feeding ruminants must notice the degradability of
   feed, especially protein. Microbial rtunen requires ammonia from rumen
   degradable protein (RDP) beside that ruminant require bypass protein or
   rumen undegradable protein (RUP) and microbial crude protein. The aim of
   the study was to discover the best RDP:RUP ratio in beef cattle diets
   commonly used by Indonesian farmers using an in vitro methodology.
   Materials and Methods: Samples of Pennisetum purpureum, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Indigofera zollingeriana, cassava, maize, palm kernel
   cake, rice bran, and tofu waste were formulated into dietary treatments
   (dry matter {[}DM] basis). All experiments were carried out using a 3 x3
   x2 factorial, randomized block design with three replications.
   Treatments consisted of three protein levels (12\%, 14\%, and 16\%), two
   energy levels (65\% and 70\%), and three RDP:RUP ratio levels (55:45,
   60:40, and 65:35). The experimental diets were incubated in vitro using
   buffered rumen fluid for 48 h at 39 degrees C. After incubation, the
   supernatants were analyzed to determine pH, ammonia concentration, total
   volatile fatty acid (WA), and microbial protein synthesis. The residues
   were analyzed to determine DM, organic matter, protein, and RUP
   digestibility.
   Results: Increased protein, energy, and RDP levels increased
   digestibility, ammonia concentrations, total VFAs, and microbial protein
   synthesis (p<0.05), while rations with 16\% protein lowered these
   parameters (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: Increased dietary protein (from 12\% to 14\% DM), energy
   (from 65\% to 70\% DM), and RDP (from 55\% to 65\% crude protein {[}CP])
   levels increased nutrient digestibility, ammonia concentration, total
   VFA levels, and microbial protein synthesis. The diet containing 14\%DM
   dietary protein and 70\%DM energy, which contained 55\%, 60\%, or 65\%
   CP RDP optimally increased nutrient digestibility, ammonia
   concentration, total WA levels, and microbial protein synthesis. Thus,
   feed based on these RDP:RUP ratios can optimize ruminant productivity.},

   fallows in eastern Zambia},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {327-340},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is a major nutrient that limits Crop production in southern
   Africa. We hypothesized that coppicing tree legumes, which are
   integrated in cropping systems, would intercept leaching nutrients and
   could also increase topsoil N in nutrient-depleted soils. This
   hypothesis was verified in three ongoing experiments at Msekera
   (experiments 1 and 2) and Kagoro (experiment 3) in Zambia. Planted tree
   fallows of Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala. Acacia angustisma,
   and Sesbania sesban were compared with natural fallows and with
   continuous maize cropping with or without fertilizer (no-tree) controls.
   Top and subsoil samples were taken in the tree treatments and in the
   no-tree controls to establish short and long-term tree effects on soil N
   dynamics. N-15 was introduced at various soil depths down to 2 m to
   determine the vertical root-reach of coppicing trees. Samples taken oil
   two different dates showed that planted trees are capable of capturing
   subsoil N. The amounts retrieved by trees in experiment 2 did not vary
   with depth or dates except for A. angustisma which retrieved more N from
   the top 0.20 to than from the subsoil. L. leucocephala and C. sepium had
   similar characteristics in terms of coppice biomass production and N
   content, and both species rooted to at least 2 in G. sepium in a mixture
   with S. sesban, retrieved more applied N than when planted alone,
   implying that mixed fallows may be effective in resource capture. There
   was More inorganic-N in the topsoil of coppiced fallows than in
   unfertilized maize plots. Subsoil N accumulation was evident Under
   Fertilized maize plots. There was less subsoil nitrate-N beneath planted
   trees than beneath mono-cropped maize plots indicating that trees
   probably retrievcd subsoil N. Maize yields subsequent to coppicing tree
   fallows were at least 170 \% higher than unfertilized controls
   indicating improved soil fertility stains in the tree systems.},

Abstract = {Due to extensive land clearing in northeastern Mexico, there is an
   increasing need for restoration for which knowledge on plant
   establishment biology becomes a priority, for restoration practices. In
   here we tested the influence of current environmental variation on the
   establishment biology of common woody species from Tamaulipan
   thornscrub. Seedling establishment was monitored; four native species
   (Acacia berlandieri Benth., Ebenopsis ebano (Benth.) Coult, Havardia
   pallens (Benth.) Brintton and Rose, Prosopis laevigata (Humb \& Bonpl.
   ex. Wild.) M.C. Johston), and one exotic species (Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) de Wit). Seedling emergence, seedling survivorship, length of
   stems and number of leaves were evaluated over 1 year in environments
   with different light regimes: (i) dense thornscrub; (ii) thornscrub
   edge; (iii) cleared thornscrub (direct sunlight). Ten plots of 4m(2) (2
   m x 2 m) were sampled in each environment. Seedling emergence occurred
   on spring and late summer and was greater on dense thornscrub for all
   species. Native species had higher survivorship and growth and had more
   leaves in dense thornscrub than in other environments. Exotic L.
   leucocephala had similar survivorship, shoot length and number of leaves
   across environments. All seedlings from all species died by late spring,
   possibly due to environmental stress. Seedling survival was longer for
   all native plants, as there were surviving seedlings in early spring for
   all species but not of exotic L. leucocephala. Perhaps mainly as a
   result of high temperature and low humidity. Additional watering,
   shading and moisture retaining gels should thus be considered when
   rehabilitation programs are made with seeds and seedlings in the region.

Abstract = {Phytomediated synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles has become a key
   research area in nanotechnology due to its wide applicability in various
   biomedical fields. The present work explores the biosynthesis of zinc
   oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) using Leucaena leucocephala leaf extract.
   The synthesised ZnO-NPs were characterised by ultraviolet-visible
   (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) studies.
   Biosynthesised ZnO-NPs are found to have wurtzite hexagonal structure
   with particles distributed in the range of 50-200 nm as confirmed by TEM
   studies. The anticancer activity of ZnO-NPs against MCF-7 (breast
   cancer) and PC-3 (human prostate cancer) cell lines was evaluated using
   3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
   assay. From the assay, biosynthesised ZnO-NPs have better cytotoxic
   activity on PC-3 cell lines than MCF-7 cell lines. The in vitro
   cytotoxicity studies of biosynthesised ZnO-NPs against Dalton lymphoma
   ascites (DLA) cells reveal better antitumor activity of 92\% inhibition
   with concentration of 200 mu gml(-1) of ZnO-NPs, and as the
   concentration increases, the anticancer efficiency as well increases,
   and also, it has excellent photocatalytic activity to degrade crystal
   violet dye in aqueous solution after irradiation of 90 min. The result
   suggests that the green synthesis of ZnO-NPs could be easily recovered
   and reused several times without any significant loss of the catalytic
   activity. The advantage of this technique lies in its low cost, easily
   climbable and non-use of toxic agents.},

Abstract = {Transvaccenic acid (TVA), c9t11 conjugated linoleic acid (CIA), and the
   proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) in bovine milk are
   associated with human health benefits. The effect of nutritional
   supplementation without (NSO) or with sunflower seed oil (63.3\%
   linoleic acid and 28.3\% oleic acid) at 20 g/kg (SO20) of dry matter
   (DM) and 40 g/kg of DM (SO40) was evaluated in milk cows foraging on
   Leucaena leucocephala in intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS). Two
   experiments were performed, the first on a specialized tropical dairy
   farm (STDF) and the second on a dual-purpose tropical farm (DPTF), where
   cattle are fed an average of 5.8 kg/d and 2.0 kg/d of concentrate,
   respectively, in addition to grazing on pasture. Sunflower seed oil
   supplementation tended to decrease forage intake but did not affect milk
   yield or the milk protein and lactose percentages in either experiment.
   The proportion of fat, total solids, and milk urea nitrogen (MUN)
   decreased with oil supplementation on the STDF. However, on the DPTF,
   these three variables did not change significantly when SO20 or SO40
   were compared to NSO, but the values were higher for 5020 compared to
   SO40. The proportion of CLAc9t11 and TVA linearly increased with the two
   levels of supplementation in both experiments. Furthermore, the
   atherogenic FAs decreased, and the milk had greater amounts of
   unsaturated FM (UFAs) and a lower atherogenic index. Supplementing cows
   under an ISS with sunflower seed oil increases the proportion of
   beneficial milk FM. On the STDF oil supplementation produced milk with a
   lower fat content and a greater proportion of high-quality fatty acids,
   presenting an interesting possibility for fat restricted diets.},

   impact of sewage irrigation on soil qualities. Soils were analyzed for
   different physical, chemical, biological and biochemical parameters.
   Results have shown that use of sewage for irrigation improved the clay
   content to 18-22.7\%, organic carbon to 0.51-0.86\% and fertility status
   of soils. Build up in total N was up to 2,713 kg ha(-1), available N
   (397 kg ha(-1)), available P (128 kg ha(-1)), available K (524 kg
   ha(-1)) and available S (65.5 kg ha(-1)) in the surface (0.15 m) soil.
   Long-term sewage irrigation has also resulted a significant build-up of
   DTPA extractable Zn (314\%), Cu (102\%), Fe (715\%), Mn (197.2), Cd
   (203\%), Ni (1358\%) and Pb (15.2\%) when compared with the adjacent
   rain-fed reference soil. Soils irrigated with sewage exhibited a
   significant decrease in microbial biomass carbon (-78.2\%), soil
   respiration (-82.3\%), phosphatase activity (-59.12\%) and dehydrogenase
   activity (-59.4\%). An attempt was also made to identify the sensitive
   soil indicators under sewage irrigation, where microbial biomass carbon
   was singled out as the most sensitive indicator.},

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {251-266},
Abstract = {With the soaring cost and scarcity at times of inorganic fertilizers in
   the country, there is a need to find alternatives to inorganic
   fertilizers by making use of indigenous materials such as leaves of
   leguminous plants, mudpress, and so enhance growth and development of
   crops. Application of `ipil-ipil' (Leucaena leucocephala) green manure
   supplemented with inorganic P and K caused vigorous growth of cassava
   (Manihot esculenta). Application of ipil-ipil biomass at the rate of
   7.23 t ha(-1) resulted in high yield and better values of yield
   components of cassava. However, due to high expenses incurred in
   hauling, transport and cost of the green manure materials, their use is
   likely to be more economical and feasible only if ipil-ipil is readily
   available in the farm. With tare (Colocasia esculenta), combined
   application of ipil-ipil green manure and inorganic P and K promoted
   vigorous stand and higher yield of the crop. Significantly larger corms
   were formed resulting in higher total corm yields and marketability than
   the control (untreated) and those treated only with 60-39.6-74.7 kg
   ha(-1) N, P, and K from inorganic fertilizer. Increasing the rate of
   inorganic N applied to plants (90-36.9-74.7 kg ha(-1) N, P, K) during a
   third cropping, gave comparable yield to treatment involving 7.23 t hal
   ipil-ipil supplemented with inorganic P and K. Despite the relatively
   higher gross income obtained from organic and inorganic treatment
   combinations, slightly lower net income was obtained compared with
   inorganic fertilizer-applied plants due to higher production expenses
   incurred with the former treatments.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the impact of the moisture content of biomass on
   thermal efficiency and relative boiler size which directly represent the
   economic merits of biomass drying. A model for predicting the moisture
   content of bundled Leucaena (Leucocephala) trees under open environment
   was validated for tropical Hawaii. Cumulative precipitation and
   evapotranspiration (ET) are the major factors affecting the biomass
   moisture content change. ET was computed using Hargreave's model, which
   requires only temperature and solar radiation data. Integration of these
   models made it possible to calculate the thermal efficiency and relative
   boiler size when using bundled trees as a fuel under a given drying
   regime and for a specific geographical location. A geographic
   information system provided the temperature and precipitation data
   required for evaluating the spatial variation in boiler efficiency and
   size for the 1440 km(2) island of Kauai. Depending on the time of
   harvest, the Leucaena moisture content varied from 35 to 69\% (on wet
   basis) following a period of 6 months of in-field drying. Boiler
   efficiency using fuelwood with this range of moisture content varied
   from 49 to 73\%. Boiler relative size varied from 1.2 to 2.2 times the
   size required when Leucaena with 0\% moisture content is used as a fuel.
   The spatial and temporal effects on the value of biomass were thus found
   to be important factors for various sites in the study area. The methods
   for quantifying the merit of biomass moisture management proposed in
   this paper demonstrate how GIS modeling can lead to appropriate
   decision-making capability in bioenergy. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {The agronomic performance of 88 herbaceous legumes, including 65
   different species in 19 genera, was evaluated in one experiment and 39
   shrub and tree legumes, including 18 different species and 3
   unidentified species from 10 genera, were evaluated in 2 experiments, in
   small, single-row plots over 3 years at Ciawi, West Java. A number of
   agronomic attributes were measured or estimated by visual ranking at
   monthly intervals to assess establishment/persistence, vigour, yield,
   disease/pest resistance, habit, drought resistance and reproductive
   capacity. Multivariate classification analysis was used to group
   accessions with similar agronomic performance in 2 experiments. A fourth
   experiment contained only 13 tree accessions and therefore did not
   warrant classification analysis. Leaf damage to Leucaena accessions
   caused by the leucaena psyllid in the three tree experiments was
   assessed.
   Following initial assessment without defoliation, the herbaceous and
   tree legume experiments were cut 4 times over a 17-month period and 5
   times over a 20-month period, respectively. The most persistent and
   highest yielding herbaceous legume species were: Stylosanthes guianensis
   cvv. Graham, Cook and Endeavour, S. scabra cv. Seca, S. hamata cv.
   Verano, Neonotonia wightii cvv. Tinaroo and Clarence, Clitoria ternatea
   and Pueraria phaseoloides. Promising species for possible use in
   communal grazing areas and in cropping systems were also identified. The
   highest yielding tree species was Calliandra calothyrsus. High yields
   were also produced by Leucaena leucocephala prior to the appearance of
   the leucaena psyllid insect early in 1986. Some variation in
   susceptibility to the psyllid was recorded between accessions. Other
   promising species were: Gliricidia sepium, Sesbania formosa, S. sesban,
   Desmodium rensonii and Codariocalyx gyroides.},

   were housed in individual metabolism cages for sixty-three days in a
   randomised design with four replicates for the four treatment diets. The
   experimental and basal diet intakes were measured daily while live
   weights were taken weekly. Daily feed intakes measured were
   significantly different (p < 0.05) among treatments. Kids that were

   more than those on Cactus-Acacia angusitissima meal (CACT-AA) and
   Cactus-Macroptilium atropurpureum meal (CACT-MA) but not significantly
   different from the commercial growers meal. Pennisetum purpureum (bana)
   grass hay was offered as basal diet. It was observed that all diets were
   readily palatable. However, the commercial diet had significantly higher
   basal diet intake compared to other experimental diets. Average daily
   weight gains were higher in CACT-LL and commercial diet. Moreover, all
   treatment diets led to increased growth rates and live-mass gains in
   goats. Animals that were given commercial diet and CACT-LL performed
   better than those supplemented with CACT-AA and CACT-MA. The weights
   were significantly different. Fresh cactus can be mixed with different
   browse legume hay and provide cover for dry season quality feed deficit
   and at the same time improve growth rate and overall weight gain. (C)

Abstract = {Cassava (Manihot esculenta, Crantz), an annual tropical tuber crop, was
   nutritionally evaluated as a foliage for ruminants, especially dairy
   cattle. Cultivation of cassava biomass to produce hay is based on a
   first harvest of the foliage at three months after planting, followed
   every two months thereafter until one year. Inter-cropping of leguminous
   fodder as food-feed between rows of cassava, such as Leucaena
   leucocephala or cowpea (Vigna unculata), enriches soil fertility and
   provides additional fodder. Cassava hay contained 20 to 25\% crude
   protein in the dry matter with good profile of amino acids. Feeding
   trials with cattle revealed high levels of DM intake (3.2\% of BW) and
   high DM digestibility (71\%). The hay contains tannin-protein complexes
   which could act as rumen by pass protein for digestion in the small
   intestine. As cassava hay contains condensed tannins, it could have
   subsequent impact on changing rumen ecology particularly changing rumen
   microbes population. Therefore, supplementation with cassava hay at 1-2
   kg/hd/d to dairy cattle could markedly reduce concentrate requirements,
   and increase milk yield and composition. Moreover, cassava hay
   supplementation in dairy cattle could increase milk thiocyanate which
   could possibly enhance milk quality and milk storage, especially in
   small holder-dairy farming. Condensed tannins contained in cassava hay
   have also been shown to potentially reduce gastrointestinal nematodes in
   ruminants and therefore could act as an anthelmintic agent. Cassava hay
   is therefore an excellent multi-nutrient source for animals, especially
   for dairy cattle during the long dry season, and has the potential to
   increase the productivity and profitability of sustainable livestock
   production systems in the tropics.},

Title = {Leucaena interspecific fi c hybrid ` KX4-Hawaii' ` as a source of
   agricultural biomass in a water-scarce small island developing state},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Background: Leucaena leucocephala is a useful multipurpose tree species
   for agroforestry systems, but traditional seeded cultivars often become
   weedy and invasive. A seedless hybrid cultivar, ` KX4-Hawaii ` , offers
   a potential solution to this problem. However, relevant agronomic
   information and information on the performance of ` KX4-Hawaii ` under
   varying growth conditions is required. The goal of this research was to
   evaluate ` KX4-Hawaii ` as a source of agricultural biomass in Barbados,
   a small island developing state with limited arable land. Methods: `
   KX4-Hawaii ` air layers were imported into Barbados to create stock
   trees. Air layering was used to create propagation material and a fi eld
   study was established with a ` KX4-Hawaii ` hedgerow planted as a fi eld
   border. Three plant spacings (50, 75, and 100 cm) were evaluated and
   data on the growth and biomass yields of the trees were collected at
   4-month intervals. Precipitation data were used to investigate climatic
   effects on ` KX4-Hawaii ` productivity. Results: ` KX4-Hawaii ` was
   successfully propagated via air layers and could be planted directly in
   the fi eld with irrigation. All recorded growth and biomass yields were
   correlated with precipitation. However, the woody (lignified fi ed stems
   and branches) biomass was more responsive to precipitation than the
   green (leaves and green tender stems) biomass and made up a large
   fraction of the total biomass produced. ` KX4-Hawaii ` was productive
   even under drought conditions and biomass yields per meter of hedgerow
   increased with closer spacings. Of the tested spacing treatments, 75 cm
   was optimum for a 4-month pruning interval under the conditions seen in
   Barbados as it produced similar yields to the 50 cm spacing treatment
   but would require less propagation material.},

Abstract = {Bioactive plants might represent an alternative for Cooperia punctata
   control in grazing cattle. The objectives of this study were (1) to
   assess the ovicidal activity of extracts from 4 plant species against C.
   punctata, (2) to determine the role of the polyphenols in the plants'
   anthelmintic (AH) activity, and (3) to evaluate the best plant
   extraction procedure when searching for ovicidal activity. The egg hatch
   assay was used with different extraction procedures, aqueous (AQ),
   acetone: water (AW) and acetonic (AC), to evaluate the ovicidal activity
   of Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Guazuma ulmifolia and
   Cratylia argentea. Eggs of C. punctata were exposed in quadruplicate to
   0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 4.8 and 9.6 mg mL(-1) of each plant extract. The roles of
   the polyphenols were assessed using polyethylene glycol (PEG). The 12
   plant extracts inhibited egg hatching in a dose-dependent manner.
   Best-fit LC50 values were 1.03 +/- 0.17 and 7.90 +/- 1.19 mg mL(-1) for
   G. sepium-AC and L. leucocephala-AQ, respectively. Differences in AH
   activity were found among the extraction procedures (P < 0.05). At the
   highest concentration, L. leucocephala- AQ inhibited more than 50\% of
   C. punctata hatching. The G. sepium-AC extract fully inhibited egg
   hatching. The addition of polyethylene glycol revealed the role of the
   polyphenols in the bioactivity of most plant extracts; however, for G.
   sepium-AC, the polyphenols were not the main bioactive compounds.
   Overall, acetone: water extraction represented the best extraction
   procedure to obtain both ovicidal activity and higher yield. The
   inhibition rates suggested that L. leucocephala and G. sepium should be
   evaluated as a means of reducing larval density in pastures.},

   The trend of disappearance of dry matter was faster than crude protein

   almost similar during 72 hr of incubation in rumen. The faster rate of
   disappearance of crude protein from leguminous forages as compared to
   non-leguminous forages showed that legume proteins are readily available

Abstract = {Two pot experiments were conducted in the screenhouse of Forestry

   agroforestry alley cropping system and biochar production for
   sustainable soil productivity and crop production. The results indicated
   that plant growth rate, biomass production, and N-2-fixing potential of

   types, while the concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
   potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in plant tissues, in most
   cases, varied significantly with plant species, plant parts, and soil
   types. Total biomass was greatest for Gliricidia sepium in both Ultisol

   biomass in both soils. Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala had
   the least \%NdfF (percent N derived from fertilizer), 4.8 and 4.2,
   respectively, in the two soils, whereas Faidherbia albida and Acacia
   auriculaeformis had the highest \%NdfF of 9.6 in the Ultisol and 7.4 in
   the Alfisol respectively. Significant negative correlations were
   established between plant biomass and \%NdfF in the Ultisol
   (-0.888{*}{*}) and Alfisol (-0.898{*}{*}). Based on total biomass, shoot
   N concentration and \%NdfF, the NFTs were ranked with Gliricidia rated
   highest in the two soils as having the greatest potential for alley
   cropping and biochar production, closely followed by Leucaena, while
   Acacia auriculaeformis had the lowest potential in both soil types.},

   pubescens, Mucuna pruriens var. utilis, Cajanus cajan and Leucaena
   leucocephala) on fertility of the topsoil in the Sudanian region of
   Benin over 3 years was investigated. The plants were sown without
   fertiliser, harvested under a cut-and-carry regime and soil changes were
   compared with those under a natural fallow. Soil samples were collected
   before the study commenced and at the end of the 3-year study. These
   were analysed for pH, organic C, N, available P and exchangeable cations
   (Ca, Mg, K and Na). N, P and K contents of aerial parts were determined
   to estimate the exports of these elements. For the grasses, root
   biomass, depth and distribution were also measured. Three years after
   grasses and legumes were sown, the pH under the grasses (6.6-6.7) was
   higher than under the legumes (6.2-6.3) and C and N concentrations had
   declined from the initial levels. Owing to their deep rooting systems,
   A. gayanus BL and P. maximum, and probably C. cajan and L. leucocephala,
   appeared able to recycle nutrients from deeper soil layers. While these
   species could be used for ley pastures in savannah regions of west
   Africa, maintenance fertiliser applications would be required to prevent
   nutrient depletion under a cut-and-carry regime. Further studies to test
   the efficacy of farmyard manure in providing these nutrients and to
   examine the growth of the legumes when inoculated with appropriate
   rhizobia seem warranted.},

Abstract = {In tropical regions with well-defined wet and dry seasons, repeated
   wetting and drying cycles can harden exposed soils and inhibit root
   growth. While this phenomenon has been well documented, the
   relationships between plant productivity and chemical and physical soil
   parameters have not been well defined. The current study identifies the
   abiotic parameters that best relate to measures of plant development,
   specifically to corn productivity. The primary goal of this research was
   to provide information to improve agricultural sustainability in humid
   tropical ecosystems. The effects of using plant residues as a cover on a
   sandy soil were studied. Four leguminous species were planted in an
   alley cropping system, Leucaena leucocephala, Cajanus cajan, Clitoria
   fairchildiana and Acacia mangium, and corn was planted in January 2007
   between legume rows. We measured the most important chemical and
   physical soil parameters. Yield indicators included cob weight and the
   weight of 100 kernels. The application of plant residues altered soil
   conditions and increased rootable soil volume. This change was
   associated with an increase by 10\% in water retention above field
   capacity in the uppermost soil layer of the residue-covered sections of
   the experiment. In the control sections cobs were up to three times
   lighter (31.43-93.38 g) in the bare soil control than those from
   residue-covered sections of the experiment. Dynamic indicators related
   to nutrient absorption and crop evapotranspiration, such as the number
   of days with water stress and rootable soil volume, were the most
   suitable indicators for assessing soil quality. The response of corn was
   best related to complex physical indicators, including the amount of N
   applied via legume residues.},

Abstract = {Several indigenous and exotic browse species with potential for
   development of agroforestry technologies in the humid tropics of west
   Africa have been identified, but information on their fodder yield and
   quality, and how this is influenced by age of coppice regrowth is scanty
   and limited to a few species. The effect of age of coppice of regrowth
   (8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks) on fodder yield, and concentrations of crude
   protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF),
   acid detergent lignin (lignin), and acid detergent ash (ADF-Ash) in the
   fodder of 27 browse species was studied in the humid forest zone of
   southeastern Nigeria. The fodder yield, and concentrations of NDF, ADF
   and lignin increased (p < 0.05), while CP declined (p < 0.05) with
   increasing age of coppice regrowth for all the browse species. The
   ADF-Ash concentrations of eight browse species increased linearly (p <
   0.05), while that of 19 species followed a quadratic (p < 0.05) trend in
   response to increasing age of coppice regrowth. Bauhinia monandra,
   Calliandra calothyrsus, Dalbergia sissoo, Enterolobium cyclocarpum,
   Grewia pubescens, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Senna
   spectabilis, and Terminalia superba were identified to have high
   potential for the development of integrated crop-livestock agroforestry
   technologies in the west African humid tropics based on fodder yield,
   concentrations of CP, NDF, ADF and lignin. Coppice regrowth of the
   promising species could be harvested between 16 and 20 weeks to maximize
   yield and quality of the fodder. The results showed that fodder yield

   the development of agroforestry technologies for smallholder
   crop-livestock farming systems.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the specificity of Leucaena for strains of rhizobia that
   form effective N-fixing associations is confined mostly To Leucaena
   leucocephala. However, recognition of the agroforestry potential of
   other species has stimulated an assessment of rhizobial requirements of
   all 22 species in the genus. In N-free systems, Leucaena exhibits very
   significant genotype interactions with rhizobial strains that form
   effective symbioses. Specificity for effectiveness was observed both
   between and within species. In two glasshouse experiments, all tested
   rhizobial strains formed nodules with all species, but the level of
   effectiveness, based on plant dry weights, ranged from totally
   ineffective to more effective than plants supplied with mineral
   nitrogen. Plant dry weight and nitrogen content responses were used to
   place host genotypes into three broad similarity groups. No strain of
   Rhizobium was universally effective on all host accessions, although
   several reasonably wide spectrum strains were identified and recommended
   for field testing. Need-for-inoculation field experiments should be used
   to assess the effectiveness of background rhizobial strains and when
   found to be unsatisfactory, newly planted Leucaena should be inoculated
   with suitable Rhizobium. Strain CB3060 has demonstrated an intrinsic
   competitive ability in the field, but other elite strains (CB3126 and
   LDK4), identified in glasshouse trials require field testing. The main
   factors affecting nodulation and N-2 fixation are identified as: I)soil
   acidity and phosphorus deficiency; 2) high levels of nitrate-N in the
   soil; 3) moisture stress combined with high temperatures; and 4) the
   effects of defoliation. The importance of these observations to
   establishment of Leucaena in new areas, especially in acid soils, is
   discussed in relation to selection of suitable strains for successful
   early nodulation and plant growth.},

Title = {CHARACTERIZATION OF AUTOHYDROLYZED WOODS OF 5 CULTIVATED LEGUMES},
Journal = {MOKUZAI GAKKAISHI},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {38},
Number = {8},
Pages = {786-795},
Abstract = {The amounts of hemicellulose directly extractable from original wood
   meals with 12\% KOH were greater in Acacia mearnsii, A. melanoxylon and
   Robinia pseudoacacia, whose lignin was less in content and richer in
   syringyl residues. The lignin of young (one-year-old) stemwood of
   Leucaena leucocephala has the same S/V ratio (mole ratio of syringyl
   units to guayacyl units) as that of the mature wood, whereas its content
   was less in the former than in the latter.
   Upon autohydrolysis, substantial parts of hemicellulose and lignin
   became extractable with water and 90\% dioxane, respectively, although
   the solubilized amounts of lignin were different among wood species to
   some extents. Although the yield of xylose decreased with a prolonged
   time of autohydrolysis, the amount of solubilized lignin increased
   gradually. The enzymatic susceptibilities of these autohydrolyzed woods
   were the greatest in A. mearnsii and A. melanoxylon, and the least in L.
   leucocephala. A. mangium and R. pseudoacacia were ranked between them.
   The young stemwood of L, leucocephala showed much greater enzymatic
   susceptibility than the mature wood. These facts can be explained by the
   differences in the lignin contents, the lignin natures and the
   hemicellulose contents.
   The ultraviolet (UV) spectra of fiber secondary walls changes
   substantially upon autohyrolysis losing the absorption peak at about 280
   nm. The absorbance intensities decreased differently depending on the
   wood species. The UV absorbances of vessel secondary walls also
   decreased to the same levels as those of the fiber secondary walls of
   each wood species, and the cellulose of the secondary walls was degraded
   considerably by the enzymatic treatment of all species except for L.
   leucocephala.},

Journal = {PLANT COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {5},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {The Caesalpinioideae subfamily contains many well-known trees that are
   important for economic sustain- ability and human health, but a lack of
   genomic resources has hindered their breeding and utilization. Here, we
   present chromosome-level reference genomes for the two food and
   industrial trees Gleditsia sinensis (921 Mb) and Biancaea sappan (872
   Mb), the three shade and ornamental trees Albizia julibrissin (705 Mb),
   Delonix regia (580 Mb), and Acacia confusa (566 Mb), and the two pioneer
   and hedgerow trees Leucaena leucocephala (1338 Mb) and Mimosa
   bimucronata (641 Mb). Phylogenetic inference shows that the mimosoid
   clade has a much higher evolutionary rate than the other clades of
   Caesalpinioideae. Macrosynteny comparison suggests that the fusion and
   breakage of an unstable chromosome are responsible for the difference in
   basic chromosome number (13 or 14) for Caesalpinioideae. After an
   ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) shared by all Caesalpinioideae
   species (CWGD, similar to 72.0 million years ago {[}MYA]), there were
   two recent successive WGD events, LWGD-1 (16.2-19.5 MYA) and LWGD-2
   (7.1-9.5 MYA), in L. leucocephala. Thereafter, `40\% gene loss and
   genome-size contraction have occurred during the diploidization process
   in L. leucocephala. To investigate secondary metabolites, we identified
   all gene copies involved in mimosine metabolism in these species and
   found that the abundance of mimosine biosynthesis genes in L.
   leucocephala largely explains its high mimosine production. We also
   identified the set of all potential genes involved in triterpenoid
   saponin biosynthesis in G. sinensis, which is more complete than that
   based on previous transcriptome-derived unigenes. Our results and
   genomic resources will facilitate biological studies of Caesalpinioideae
   and promote the utilization of valuable secondary metabolites.},

Title = {NrcR, a New Transcriptional Regulator of Rhizobium tropici CIAT
   899 Involved in the Legume Root-Nodule Symbiosis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {The establishment of nitrogen-fixing rhizobium-legume symbioses requires
   a highly complex cascade of events. In this molecular dialogue the
   bacterial NodD transcriptional regulators in conjunction with plant
   inducers, mostly flavonoids, are responsible for the biosynthesis and
   secretion of Nod factors which are key molecules for successful
   nodulation. Other transcriptional regulators related to the symbiotic
   process have been identified in rhizobial genomes, including negative
   regulators such as NolR. Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 is an important
   symbiont of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), and its genome
   encompasses intriguing features such as five copies of nodD genes, as
   well as other possible transcriptional regulators including the NolR
   protein. Here we describe and characterize a new regulatory gene located
   in the non-symbiotic plasmid pRtrCIAT899c, that shows homology (46\%
   identity) with the nolR gene located in the chromosome of CIAT 899. The
   mutation of this gene, named nrcR (nolR-like plasmid c Regulator),
   enhanced motility and exopolysaccharide production in comparison to the
   wild-type strain. Interestingly, the number and decoration of Nod
   Factors produced by this mutant were higher than those detected in the
   wildtype strain, especially under salinity stress. The nrcR mutant
   showed delayed nodulation and reduced competitiveness with P. vulgaris,
   and reduction in nodule number and shoot dry weight in both P. vulgaris
   and Leucaena leucocephala. Moreover, the mutant exhibited reduced
   capacity to induce the nodC gene in comparison to the wild-type CIAT
   899. The finding of a new nod-gene regulator located in a non-symbiotic
   plasmid may reveal the existence of even more complex mechanisms of
   regulation of nodulation genes in R. tropici CIAT 899 that may be
   applicable to other rhizobial species.},

Abstract = {Pyrolysis of alternative biomasses, which contributes to the recovery of
   and soils and does not compete with alimentary biomass, could increase
   use of biomass as feedstock in energy production facilities. In this
   sense, in order to optimize this thermal process and gain better insight
   the origin and evolution of the main produced volatiles, nonisothermal
   thermogravimetry coupled to mass spectrometry (TG/MS) has been applied
   for samples of two biomasses {[}Leucaena Leucocephala (Leucaena) and
   Chamaecytisus Palmensis (Tagasaste)], which find application as energy
   crops and contribute to soil restoration. In a first stage,
   autocatalytic kinetics has been used in order to obtain the mass loss
   rate profiles (DTG) of each biomass pseudocomponent (hemicellulose,
   cellulose, lignin, and extractives) during pyrolysis. In a second stage,
   the experimental mass spectrometry signals of the main volatiles (CO,
   CO2, and H2O) have been simulated using a linear combination of the
   previously calculated DTG profiles. The accurate fitting obtained,
   explains the origin of these volatiles from a simple volatization
   process, mainly front lignin. In a third stage, in order to simulate the
   hydrogen signal, it has been necessary to consider the char produced
   during the volatization process. According to the model, the charring
   process explains close to 77 wt\% of the total hydrogen obtained during
   pyrolysis. Considering the specific char production of each biomass
   pseudocomponent, it is possible to measure their individual
   contributions to hydrogen production: hemicellulose, 27,5; cellulose,
   9.7; and lignin, 60.9 wt\%, for Leucaena. Taking into account the
   composition of the samples, the relation between the specific hydrogen
   productions of the single pseudocomponents (hemicellulose:cellu lose:
   lignin.) can be calculated: 3.4:1.0:7.6.},

Abstract = {Fourteen lactating HolsteinxZebu cows (450 +/- 28 kg) were used to
   evaluate the effect of supplementing forage tree foliage on Foliage Dry
   Matter Intake (FDMI), milk yield and milk composition. Cows were milked
   once daily and calves suckled twice a day. Animals grazed guinea grass
   and received 2 kg sun-cured foliage. Supplements were: BA (100\%
   Brosimun calicastrum), LL (100\% Leucaena leucocephala), LB (50\% L.
   leucocehpala+50\% B. alicastrum), LP (50\% L leucocehpala+50\% Piscida
   piscipula), LG (50\% L. leucocehpala+50\% Guazuma ulmifolia), LPG
   (33.3\% L. leucocehpala+33.3\% P. piscipula+33.3\% G. ulmifolia) and BPG
   (33.3\% B. alicastrum+33.3\% P. piscipula+33.3\% G. ulmifolia). Mixtures
   were prepared simulating the likely intake of these species in the area.
   There were differences in FDMI (p<0.05), with higher intakes for LB
   (1648 g DM days(-1)) and lower intakes for LP (1112.8 g DM day(-1)).
   There were no differences in saleable milk yield (p>0.05). Higher milk
   intake by the calf (MIC) was found in LL (2.6 kg day(-1)) (p<0.05) than
   in LB or LP (1.9 kg day(-1)). The highest total milk yield was for LL
   (6.1 kg day(-1)) and the lowest, for LPG (5.1 kg day(-1)) (p<0.05). No
   effect was found in milk composition (total solids, protein and fat).
   Milk urea levels were similar amongst treatments. It can be concluded
   that the use of tree foliage as a supplement in HolsteinxZebu cows, does
   not affect milk composition, but MY improvements might be limited by
   energy supply.},

Abstract = {In tropical ecosystems trees have the potential to supply nutrients

   leaf decomposition experiments were established at three sites in Haiti
   representing diverse soil types to assess the potential of leucaena
   leaves to supply P and K to crops and to determine their pattern of
   release. Mesh bags containing 17.4 g of air-dried leucaena leaves were
   placed in plots receiving 100 kg ha(-1) of N as ammonium sulfate and
   leucaena prunings as mulch with and without 60 kg ha(-1) of P and 40 kg
   ha(-1) of K fertilizers for each crop. One bag from each plot was
   retrieved periodically over a period of 32 weeks for ash free dry
   matter, P and K determination. In the three locations applications of
   P-K inorganic fertilizer had no significant effects on leucaena leaf ash
   free dry matter remaining, P and K concentration nor content of leaves.
   Cumulative leucaena leaf P content release after 32 weeks of decay for
   the three sites averaged 4.9 kg ha(-1). Cumulative leucaena leaf K
   content release for the three sites was about 35.4 kg ha(-1). The rate
   of K release was higher in very humid climate than in semi-humid
   climate. The pattern of leucaena leaf ash free dry matter remaining,

Abstract = {Mycorrhizal infection in the roots of 10 sweet potato cultivars was
   assessed 7 weeks after planting in three soils collected frm Ibadan,
   Fashola and Onne in southern Nigeria, three soils which contained 21.0,
   7.8 and 54.8 mg P Kg-1, respectively. Mycorrhizal infection averaged
   17\% in the soil from Ibadan, 24\% in the soil from Fashola and 7\% in
   the acid soil from Onne. The plants grown in the Fashola soil contained
   the same percentage of P as plants grown in the Onne soil. Although the
   percentage of P in sweet potato was lowest in the Ibadan soil, shoot dry
   weights were 35\% higher in this soil than in the other two soils. There
   ws no correlation between the level of mycorrhizal infection and plant
   dry weight in the partially sterilized soil from Ibadan. Sweet potato
   inoculated in this soil with infected roots of Leucaena leucocephala
   showed a higher level of mycorrhizal infection than uninoculated plants.
   Dry-matter production was, however, the same for all treatments. The
   sweet potato cultivars differed in their level of mycorrhizal infection
   and in their response to applied P. Cultivars TIS 2498 and TIS 70357
   consistently showed the lowest percentage of infection; and TIb 4, TIS
   8441 and TIS 8524 showed infection levels above 20\% in the Fashola and
   Ibadan soils. When the low-yielding cultivar, TIb 4, and an improved
   clone, TIS 9265, were grown in the presence of 50 and 100 mg single
   superphosphate per kg soil, TIb 4 produced more dry matter in the
   presnce of P fertilizer than it did without the fertilizer. Growth and
   mycorrhizal infection of TIS 9265 were not affected by the fertilizer.},

Abstract = {Consumption of wild edible plants has played a significant role in
   supplying food and nutritional requirements and increasing the health
   status of underprivileged communities in many rural parts of the world.
   The present investigation was to evaluate the nutritive value, mineral
   content, vitamin content, and toxicological status of ten wild edible
   plants viz. Phlogocanthus thrysiflorus, Lasia spinosa, Eriosema
   chinense, Polygonum microcephalum, Nasturtium indicum, Spinacia
   oleracea, Malva parviflora, Leucaena leucocephala, Elsholtzia blanda,
   and Sonchus oleraceus, consumed by the tribal people of Meghalaya State
   in India, as their nourishment. All investigated plants were collected
   from different areas of Meghalaya state, and their nutraceutical
   potential was evaluated following the standard food analysis methods
   described in the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. Protein
   contents were very high in several species, especially in N. indicum
   (24.75\%). Carbohydrate content ranged from 5.86\% (S. oleracea) to
   21.28\% (E. chinense). All plants contained significant amounts of
   minerals (Na, K, Ca, Fe, Zn, Mg), and water soluble vitamins such as
   vitamin C (0.24-5.79 mg/ 100 g of dry plant material), B1, B2, B3, B5,
   B6 and B9. Antinutrients such as oxalate, phytate, saponin and heavy
   metal (Pb, Cr, Cd, Hg) levels in all plants were estimated below fatal
   levels. The consequences of haemolytic toxicity, cytotoxicity and
   genotoxicity of water extracts of wild edible plants ensure safety for
   human consumption. Therefore, this study focuses on the utilization of
   wild edible plants as a source of dietary supplements, which may result
   in the commercialization of the produce; hence, it assesses consumer
   perceptions towards wild edible plants in India.\& COPY; 2023 SAAB.

Title = {Impact of continuous organic manuring on mechanisms and processes of the
   stabilisation of soil organic C under rice-wheat cropping system},
Journal = {SOIL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Understanding the mechanism of soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilisation
   may help in developing management strategies for SOC storage. A
   long-term organically managed rice-wheat cropping system was used for
   SOC stabilisation study. Soil samples were collected from control, FYM
   (farmyard manure to rice and wheat), GM (green manure; Sesbania aculeata
   to rice and Leucaena leucocephala to wheat), GB (GM with biofertiliser;
   blue green algae to rice and Azotobacter sp. to wheat), GF (GM with
   FYM), GFB (GM with FYM and biofertiliser). Sodium hypochlorite
   (NaOCl)-resistant C correlated significantly with ammonium oxalate and
   dithionate extractable Fe, Al and Si in soil. The GFB showed the highest
   enrichment of SOC (32\%) as well as NaOCl-resistant C (22\%) at 0-15 cm
   soil depth. At higher soil depth, GM alone showed the highest enrichment
   of SOC (39\% at 15-30 cm, 84\% at 30-60 cm). The NaOCl-resistant C was
   higher in FYM and GFB treatments at 15-30 and 30-60 cm depths
   respectively. The proportion of NaOCl-resistant C to SOC increased down
   the profile and was highest (30-52\%) in 30-60 cm soil depth. A multiple
   regression model developed between ammonium oxalate extractable Fe, Al
   and Si and SOC could well predict the stable SOC content. There was a
   substantial improvement in prediction when extractable Fe, Al and Si
   were combined together. Among the organic treatments, GFB showed the
   highest humification and aromaticity in humic acid with least polarity
   and more reduced form. The combination of all the organic sources (GFB)
   could be a promising nutrient management strategy for enhancing the
   stability of SOC in rice-wheat cropping systems of semiarid subtropical
   India.},

Title = {In vitro evaluation of ruminant feed from West Sumatera based on
   chemical composition and content of rumen degradable and rumen
   undegradable proteins},
Journal = {VETERINARY WORLD},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1478-1483},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Aim: This research aimed to discover the chemical composition, as well
   as the content of the degradable and undegradable protein of the
   ruminant feed commonly used as cattle feed by Indonesian farmers.
   Materials and Methods: In this study, Pennisetum purpureum, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Indigofera zollingeriana, Gliricidia sepium, cassava,
   maize, palm kernel cake, and rice bran were used as feed. Chemical
   composition was determined by proximate and Van Soest analyses performed
   in triplicate. Dry matter and organic matter digestibility, as well as
   the rumen degradable proteins (RDP) and rumen undegradable proteins
   (RUP) contents, were determined in vitro using the Tilley and Terry
   method.
   Results: The results showed that more proteins can be obtained from
   legumes than from grass or concentrates. The highest protein amount was
   obtained from I. zollingerian (31.22\%), while the lowest protein amount
   was obtained from cassava (3.59\%). Dry matter digestibility ranged from
   18.53\% (rice bran) to 49.21\% (G. sepium). Organic matter digestibility
   ranged from 35.71\% (cassava) to 59.57\% (1. zollingerian). Rice bran
   had the highest RDP from concentrate (73.26\%), whereas I. zollingerian
   had the highest RDP from forage (74.72\%). The highest RUP from
   concentrate was obtained from palm kernel cake (61.01\%), and the
   highest RUP from forage was obtained from L. leucocephala (49.23\%).
   Conclusion: The preparation of ruminant livestock rations must be based
   on RDP and RUP to meet the needs of both the rumen microbes and host
   animals. Information regarding the RDP and RUP of feeds is still
   limited, making this study useful in the preparation of ruminant
   livestock rations based on RDP and RUP ratios.},

Abstract = {The addition of Leucaena leucocephala herbage to the diet of sheep in
   Venezuela did not affect the concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA)
   in the rumen, the degradation of rice straw incubated in sacco, or the
   number of rumen fungi or bacteria. However, feeding Leucaena increased
   the concentration of ammonia in the rumen. In addition, two products of
   the degradation of the toxic amino acid mimosine were detected in the
   rumen when Leucaena was fed. One of these products, 2,3-dihydroxyl
   pyridine (2,3-DHP), was detected at concentrations of up to 1.1
   .mu.mol/ml. The other, 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone (3,4-DHP) was found at
   concentrations of up to 0.96 .mu.mol/ml. The examination of bacterial
   cultures isolated from the rumen of the sheep under investigation showed
   that feeding Leucaena increased the relative proportions of short
   Gram-negative rods and decreased the proportion of long rods and
   coccobacilli present. Although the animals fed Leucaena showed a small
   loss in weight during the feeding trial, no evidence of Leucaena
   toxicity was seen. A total of 18 cultures capable of degrading 2,3-DHP
   or 3,4-DHP were isolated from the rumen of the sheep before Leucaena was
   fed. These included both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and a
   Gram-positive sporeformer. It seems that 2,3-DHP and 3,4-DHP may be
   degraded by a much wider range of bacteria than has been recognised
   previously. The detection of these bacteria before Leucaena was fed
   suggests that they were indigenous members of the rumen microflora of
   sheep in Venezuela.},

Abstract = {An in vitro rumen batch culture study was completed to compare effects
   of common grasses, leguminous shrubs and non-leguminous shrubs used for
   livestock grazing in Australia and Ghana on CH4 production and
   fermentation characteristics. Grass species included Andropodon gayanus,
   Brachiaria ruziziensis and Pennisetum purpureum. Leguminous shrub
   species included Cajanus cajan, Cratylia argentea, Gliricidia sepium,
   Leucaena leucocephala and Stylosanthes guianensis and non-leguminous
   shrub species included Annona senegalensis, Moringa oleifera, Securinega
   virosa and Vitellaria paradoxa. Leaves were harvested, dried at 55
   degrees C and ground through a 1 mm screen. Serum bottles containing 500
   mg of forage, modified McDougall's buffer and rumen fluid were incubated
   under anaerobic conditions at 39 degrees C for 24 h. Samples of each
   forage type were removed after 0, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h of incubation for
   determination of cumulative gas production. Methane production, ammonia
   concentration and proportions of VFA were measured at 24 h.
   Concentration of aNDF (g/kg DM) ranged from 671 to 713 (grasses), 377 to
   590 (leguminous shrubs) and 288 to 517 (non-leguminous shrubs). After 24
   h of in vitro incubation, cumulative gas, CH4 production, ammonia
   concentration, proportion of propionate in VFA and IVDMD differed
   (p<0.05) within each forage type. B. ruziziensis and G sepium produced
   the highest cumulative gas, IVDMD, total VFA, proportion of propionate
   in VFA and the lowest A:P ratios within their forage types.
   Consequently, these two species produced moderate CH4 emissions without
   compromising digestion. Grazing of these two species may be a strategy
   to reduce CH4 emissions however further assessment in in vivo trials and
   at different stages of maturity is recommended.},

Abstract = {A study was designed to examine the relationships between protein,
   condensed tannin and cell wall carbohydrate content and composition and
   the nutritional quality of seven tropical legumes (Desmodium
   ovalifolium, Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala, L pallida, L
   macrophylla, Calliandra calothyrsus and Clitotia fairchildiana). Among
   the legume species studied, D ovalifolium showed the lowest
   concentration of nitrogen, while L leucocephala showed the highest.
   Fibre (NDF) content was lowest in C calothyrsus, L Leucocephala and L
   pallida and highest in L macrophylla, which had no measurable condensed
   tannins. The highest tannin concentration was found in C calothyrsus.
   Total non-structural polysaccharides (NSP) varied among legumes species
   (lowest in C calothyrsus and highest in D ovalifolium), and glucose and
   uronic acids were the most abundant carbohydrate constituents in all
   legumes. Total NSP losses were lowest in F macrophylla and highest in L
   leucocephala and L pallida. Gas accumulation and acetate and propionate
   levels were 50\% less with F macrophylla and D ovalifolium as compared
   with L leucocephala. The highest levels of branched-chain fatty acids
   were observed with non-tanniniferous legumes, and negative
   concentrations were observed with some of the legumes with high tannin
   content (D ovalifolium and F macrophylla). Linear regression analysis
   showed that the presence of condensed tannins was more related to a
   reduction of the initial rate of gas production (0-48 h) than to the
   final amount of gas produced or the extent (144h) of dry matter
   degradation, which could be due to differences in tannin chemistry.
   Consequently, more attention should be given in the future to
   elucidating the impact of tannin structure on the nutritional quality of
   tropical forage legumes. (C) 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.},

Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Introduction Sandalwood (Santalum album L.) is categorized as vulnerable
   in the IUCN Red list and is also an industrially important tree species
   valued for its heartwood and aromatic oil. Sandalwood is a semi-root
   parasite tree that relies on its host plants for its water and nutrient
   requirements. Therefore, there is need to understand the growth and
   physiological interactions between sandalwood and its hosts.Methods
   Sandalwood were planted with ten different host species viz., Syzygium
   cumini, Punica granatum, Phyllanthus emblica, Melia dubia, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Dalbergia sissoo, Casuarina equisetifolia, Citrus
   aurantium, Azadirachta indica and Acacia ampliceps to assess the
   interactive effect on the change in growth and physiology of both
   sandalwood and host tree species.Results The findings revealed that
   sandalwood grown with hosts D. sissoo and C. equisetifolia showed higher
   growth performance, while among hosts, S. cumini, followed by C.
   aurantium and L. leucocephala, showed better growth and
   physiobiochemical traits. The stepwise regression analysis and trait
   modeling indicated that the six traits, namely, plant height,
   photosynthetic rate, relative water content, water potential,
   intercellular CO2 concentration, and total soluble protein, contributed
   greater growth in the sandalwood, while four traits, namely, water
   potential, osmotic potential, leaf area, and total soluble protein,
   contributed greater growth in the host species. The traits modeling
   study predicted greater growth of sandalwood with the hosts D. sissoo
   and C. equisetifolia, whereas among host species, prediction revealed
   greater growth of S. cumini and C. aurantium.Discussion The study
   concluded that host-parasite interaction modulated the growth and
   physiological processes in both sandalwood and hosts and sandalwood
   plantations can be successfully developed with the hosts D. sissoo and
   C. equisetifolia.},

Year = {2003},
Volume = {48},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the first of a two-phased study, changes in rumen pH and
   concentrations of VIA were evaluated on diets based on pasture straw
   (negative control) or straw supplemented with alfalfa (Alfalfa diet),
   pods of Acacia sieberiana (Siebenana diet), Acacia nilotica (Nilotica
   diet) or Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena diet) for South African Merino
   rams. In the second phase, the effects of the same diets on the
   degradation of extracted straw in nylon bags and activities of microbial
   enzymes were investigated. The pH and total concentration of VFAs in
   rumen fluid ranged from 6.2 to 6.5 and 30-53 mmoll(-1), while
   degradation of DM and NDF varied from 126 to 269 g kg(-1) DM and 233-309
   g kg(-1) NDF, respectively, among diets. Variations in pH were not
   significant (P > 0.05), but diet influenced (P < 0.01) the concentration
   of VFAs, degradation of DM and cell wall constituents as well as enzyme
   activities of proteolytic and fibrolytic microorganisms. The results
   showed that the differences between the alfalfa and pod diets might have
   been due mainly to the presence of tannins in the pods. These compounds
   limit the growth and/or activity of ruminal microorganisms. However, a
   limitation in the supply of energy imposed by the pod diets may have
   reduced the efficiency of N capture by microorganisms leading to a
   depression in microbial activity. The tested legume pods could be used
   in limited quantities to supplement low-quality forage. The pods may
   need to be detoxified prior to inclusion at much higher levels in the
   diet. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Quantification of the movement of residue N through various biologically
   meaningful soil organic matter (SOM) fractions is essential in low-input
   tropical cropping systems for the development of management practices
   aimed at optimizing N-use efficiency. The flow of N derived from
   N-15-labeled leucaena {[}Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] and
   dactyladenia {[}Dactyladenia barteri (Hook f ex Oliv.) Engl.] leaf
   residues was followed through the SOM of different particle-size
   fractions during 858 d, A bioassay study with maize (Zea mays L.) was
   carried out to assess the availability of residue-derived N (RDN)
   incorporated in the particle-size fractions. At 53 d after residue
   application (DAA), most of the RDN was found in the fraction between
   0.250 and 2 mm (0250) in the leucaena treatment and in the fraction >2
   mm and the surface litter (O2000 + SL) in the dactyladenia treatment.
   The RDN content of all fractions (0.250 mm was significantly higher in
   the leucaena than in the dactyladenia treatment up to 471 DAA, The
   proportion of the total amount of RDN recovered in the fractions <2 mm
   shifted toward the smaller particle-size classes near the end of the
   experiment. Highly significant (P < 0.001) relationships between RDN
   present in the particulate organic matter (POM) and uptake of RDN by
   maize indicated the relatively high availability of RDN in the POM.
   Fractionating the SOM pool into different particle-size classes yielded
   useful information on the relative contributions of the different SOM
   fractions to N turnover and availability. This information is needed in
   identifying SOM pools with direct relevance to plant nutrition in
   low-input cropping systems.},

Abstract = {The effect of perennial mulches on moisture status, soil characteristics
   and on crop yields (maize-wheat rotation) was evaluated from 1986
   through 1989 in a silty loam acidic soil (pH 5.6, PWP 11.4 \& FC 25.6\%)
   at the Research Farm of the Central Soil \& Water Conservation Research
   \& Training Institute, Dahra Dun. Mulch materials, comprised of leaves
   of Leucaena leucocephala, Eucalyptus hybrid, Shorea robusta,
   Broussonatia paprifera or Pueraria hirsuta (chopped) @ 4 t/ha were
   applied just after sowing of wheat and the residual effect of applied
   mulch was seen in kharif maize each year.
   The distribution of profile moisture revealed that at the time of sowing
   of wheat the soil water content did not differ with depth (0-90 cm).
   With the advancement of time, the magnitude of moisture distribution
   changed. At various crop growth stages the highest amount of water was
   found in the plots mulched with S. robusta followed by E. hybrid. All
   the mulch materials, except B. paprifera, lowered the soil pH, the
   maximum effect was noted with E. hybrid (pH reduced from 5.6 to 5.0).
   After three years, N and K content of soil were found to be greatest
   with the application of L. leucocephala whereas the highest P content
   was observed in B. paprifera mulched plots.
   The highest wheat grain yield (2.46 t/ha) was recorded with L.
   leucocephala and minimum under control (2.11 t/ha) which represents a
   gain of 11.7 per cent. Maximum maize grain yield (0.73 t/ha) was found
   in S. robusta mulched plots followed by L. leucocephala (0.63 t/ha) and
   the minimum in the control (0.51 t/ha).},

Abstract = {Pot and field experiments were conducted in the greenhouse and at three
   field sites (Marondera, Domboshawa and Makoholi) in Zimbabwe to examine
   the effects of soils and fertilizers on nutrient uptake and growth of 6
   exotic tree species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. grandis, E.
   tereticornis, Leucaena leucocephala, Casuarina cunninghamiana, and
   Acacia holosericea). Plant growth, N and P contents of all species were
   increased by the application of N, P, K and micronutrient fertilizers.
   The effect of individual nutrients (N, P, K and micronutrients) and
   their combination on Eucalyptus species was further investigated in a
   pot experiment using soil from Domboshawa. Eucalyptus species responded
   only to N application and no significant interactions were found between
   N and the other elements. Nutrient uptake results showed that E.
   camaldulensis and E. tereticornis removed more cations than the N-fixing
   trees but only in the fertilized treatments. L. leucocephala and C.
   cunninghamiana were higher in P, but no clear trends were observed for
   N. Plant growth and nutrient uptake by E. camaldulensis. C.
   cunninghamiana and A. holosericea were assessed in the field at the
   three sites. Plant species grown in the Marondera site had greater
   height and diameter at breast height (DBH) than those in the two other
   sites. These results followed trends in soil nutrient contents. The
   analysis of foliage revealed differences in the nutrient concentration
   of leaves from different trees, but no effect of site was found. The
   interrelationships between plant characteristics, soil and foliage
   nutrients were examined. In a pot experiment, mineral N was the only
   variable correlated with growth response and nutrient uptake, while in
   the field the only significant correlation was obtained with soil pH.},

Title = {ANTI-THYROID PROPERTIES OF 3-HYDROXY-4(1H)-PYRIDONE - ANTIPEROXIDASE
   ACTIVITY AND EFFECT ON THYROID-FUNCTION},
Journal = {ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {1979},
Volume = {105},
Number = {2},
Pages = {342-347},
Abstract = {Confirmation of the antithyroid properties of the recently identified
   goitrogen 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone (DHP) was obtained by studying its
   effects on thyroid hormone levels in mice fed a restricted I diet
   containing 1\% (wt/wt) DHP. Besides producing hyperplastic goiters, the
   compound depressed serum T4 {[}thyroxine] concentration, caused a marked
   elevation in serum T3 {[}triiodothyronine] uptake and TSH
   {[}thyrotropin], and caused a slight increase in T3 concentration
   relative to controls. The effects of DHP on thyroid function were
   consistent with the histological changes and similar to those reported
   with other active antithyroid compounds. DHP is chemically distinct from
   any hitherto recognized goitrogen. Its mode of action was further
   investigated by testing for antiperoxidase activity, because many known
   goitrogens are general peroxidase inhibitors. A pig thyroid peroxidase
   preparation and a commercial lactoperoxidase were used. Like the known
   antithyroid agents resorcinol and 6-methyl-2-thiouracil, DHP was a
   potent inhibitor of 4 thyroid peroxidase- and lactoperoxidase-catalyzed
   reactions, namely oxidation of I- to I, iodination of thyroglobulin,
   iodination of bovine serum albumin and oxidation of guaiacol. Based on
   the conceentrations necessary for 50\% inhibition, the activity of DHP
   was less than that of resorcinol and about the same as that of
   6-methyl-2-thiouracil. The 2 major conjugated forms found in mammals,
   DHP-3-O-glucuronide and DHP-3-O-sulfate, were only weak peroxidase
   inhibitors. The relevance of these findings to the occurrence of goiter
   in ruminants grazing on the tropical legume Leucaena leucocephala is
   discussed. DHP is evidently the proximate goitrogen, formed by ruminal
   metabolism of the nonprotein plant amino acid mimosine.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is an important agroforestry species
   pan-tropically, but relatively little is known of the forage production
   potential of other species in the genus. The agronomic potential of 116
   accessions, representing the 28 species and subspecies of the Leucaena
   genus and several artificial hybrid accessions, was evaluated at Los
   Banos, Philippines and Brisbane, Australia over a 2.5-year period.
   Accessions were planted into replicated line plots, with 10 trees/plot
   spaced 50 cm apart, and with rows spaced 3 m apart. The L. pallidaxL.
   leucocephala KX2 F-1 hybrid accessions were highest yielding at both
   sites, producing dry matter (DM) yields of over 900 g/m row/month at Los
   Banos and approximately 320 g/m row/month at Brisbane. In the
   near-optimal growth conditions at Los Banos, L. leucocephala accessions
   were highly productive, with the best accessions producing total yields
   of over 500 g/m row/month. The superiority of KX2 hybrids was most
   pronounced at Brisbane, where high psyllid pressure during summer, and
   low temperatures during winter severely constrained growth of L.
   leucocephala accessions. In the Brisbane environment, psyllid resistant
   accessions of L. pallida, L. trichandra and L. diversifolia were more
   productive than L. leucocephala accessions. Leucaena greggii, L. retusa,
   L. cuspidata, L. confertiflora, L. pulverulenta, L. pueblana and L.
   involucrata were of inherently low productivity in both the Brisbane and
   Los Banos environments. Mortality over the experimental period was very
   low for most species, particularly for L. leucocephala and KX2
   accessions. The KX2 F1 hybrid accessions have considerable agronomic
   potential as alternatives to L. leucocephala for use in tropical
   agroforestry.},

Abstract = {This study examines the spatio-temporal dynamics of Acacia
   auriculiformis in Lubumbashi city, southeastern Democratic Republic of
   Congo, in the context of rapid urbanization following the liberalization
   of the mining sector. The city has experienced significant demographic
   growth and unplanned spatial expansion, resulting in a decrease in
   vegetation cover. The introduction and proliferation of A.
   auriculiformis, an exotic tree species, have occurred without strategic
   planning or monitoring. Utilizing digitized remote sensing imagery from
   2006, 2014, and 2021, we quantified the expansion of A. auriculiformis
   along the urban-rural gradient. Additionally, a floristic inventory
   conducted in 2021 provided insights into tree diversity within A.
   auriculiformis plantations. Our findings indicate a substantial increase
   in the number and area of A. auriculiformis patches, predominantly in
   urban zones. However, the patch values, highest in 2006, were shown to
   decline by 2021, especially in urban areas. The floristic inventory
   identified 39 tree species within A. auriculiformis plantations,
   including predominant species such as Albizia lebbeck, Albizia alba, and
   Leucaena leucocephala. Notably, 20 of these species are exotic, with
   half being invasive. In contrast, the 19 indigenous species were
   primarily found in peri-urban areas. While a greater number of tree
   species were observed in urban zones, larger average diameters were
   recorded in peri-urban zones. The persistence and expansion of A.
   auriculiformis in a landscape characterized by declining tree cover
   suggest its potential sustainability in this setting. However, A.
   auriculiformis plantations have facilitated the establishment of
   predominantly exotic and potentially invasive species. These findings
   highlight the need for the strategic management of A. auriculiformis and
   associated exotic flora to mitigate their spread and to consider their
   role in the restoration of degraded lands.},

Abstract = {The objectives of this work were to evaluate the floristic composition
   and dry biomass of weeds under the canopy of seven perennial species
   adapted to the Semi-Arid region of Brazil, and correlate these
   characteristics with growth traits of the perennial species. The
   following perennial species were evaluated in two experiments (E1 and
   E2): mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), juca (Caesalpinia ferrea), white
   popinac (Leucaena leucocephala), mofumbo (Combretum leprosum), neem
   (Azadirachata indica), sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia) and tamarind
   (Tamarindus indica). In E1, the seven species were evaluated in a random
   block design with four replicates and nine plants per plot. In E2,
   evaluation comprised four species (mesquite, juca, white popinac, and
   tamarind) in a random block design with eight replicates and nine plants
   per plot. A circle with an area of 1.77 m(2) was established around the
   trunk of each plant, two years after they were transplanted to the
   permanent location. The weeds collected within this circle were cut even
   with the ground, classified and weighed. At this time, plant height, and
   crown and stem diameters were evaluated in all trees of each plot. In E1
   there were no differences between tree species as to weed frequency
   under their canopies; however, weed growth was smaller under the canopy
   of sabia trees. Mesquite and sabia had the greatest plant height and
   crown diameter means, but only sabia had the greatest stem diameter. In
   E2, the perennial species were not different with regard to weed
   frequency and growth under their canopies, but mesquite had the greatest
   growth, as measured by plant height (with significant results for juca
   as well) and crown and stem diameter.},

Abstract = {Mimosine
   {[}alpha-amino-beta-(3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridin-1-yl)-propanoic
   acid] is a major constituent of Leucaena ( Leucaena leucocephala de Wit)
   and responsible for the strong allelopathic potential of the legume
   tree. Mimosine showed strong herbicidal activities on six plants in a
   bioassay. All plant parts of Leucaena contain mimosine. The quantity of
   mimosine in the young leaves and mature seeds was the greatest, 2.66 and
   2.38\% of dry weight, respectively, while the quantity in the root
   xylems and xylems was the lowest: 0.18 and 0.11\% of dry weight,
   respectively. Younger plant parts of Leucaena contained greater amounts
   of mimosine than the mature parts. Mimosine released from young parts
   and the seeds of Leucaena was proportional to the quantity of soaking
   water. Compared with the mature seeds, other mature parts of the plant
   did not give any mimosine through exuding. In soil to which mimosine was
   added, about 60\% of the mimosine was adsorbed in 1-5 days, and only a
   minor volume of mimosine was decomposed: 5.30 and 0.16\% after 1 and 5
   days, respectively. Using a mixture of FeCl3 and mimosine in a 4:6 ratio
   may be the most effective and economical method of lowering the toxicity
   of mimosine in Leucaena leaves, giving a safer cattle feed and
   decreasing the soil toxicity caused by mimosine in areas where Leucaena
   is grown. On the other hand, the incorporation of mimosine leaves into
   cultivated soils may be helpful for the biological control of weeds. The
   findings of this research reveal that mimosine may be useful for the
   development of bio-herbicides.},

Abstract = {Studies were carried out on an alfisol in Hyderabad (17 degrees 18'N, 78
   degrees 36'E) and on a vertisol in Bijapur (16 degrees 49'N, 75 degrees
   42'E) during 1986-88 and 1989-91 to evaluate the potential of hedgerows
   for forage production in dryland agriculture, Leucaena leucocephala
   (leucaena) paired hedgerows (60 cm between rows) were 7.8 m apart on the
   alfisol and 6.6 m apart on the vertisol. They were pruned at a height of
   10-15 cm. Sorghum and pearl millet were intercropped with leucaena on
   the alfisol. On the vertisol, leucaena was intercropped with sorghum and
   was subjected to root pruning. The leucaena on the vertisol was pruned
   at intervals of one, two, three, or six months. Results indicate that
   longer cutting intervals increase leucaena total biomass prodcution, but
   decrease leaf fraction in total biomass. Also, root pruning adversely
   affect leucaena prodcution. Sorghum intercropped during the rainy season
   produced 94\% of the yield of sorghum cropped alone, although it
   occupied only 86\% of the land in the system. Similarly, the area
   cropped to sorghum was 83\% on the vertisol, and it produced 82\% of the
   yield of sorghum cropped alone. The reduction in sorghum yield with
   leucaena on the vertisol compared with the yield in the alfisol appears
   to be due to the competition between leucaena and sorghum for the
   limited water stored in the soil. These studies demonstrate that the
   high forage production potential of leucaena hedgerows on these soils
   can be realized without significantly reducing the yields of arable
   intercrops, provided the hedgerows are managed appropriately.},

   plantations with Leucaena},

Abstract = {In the farmland/forest ecotone of southwest China, many areas are
   experiencing afforestation or reforestation by Eucalyptus in pure or
   mixed-species plantations for economic and ecological objectives.
   Compared with Eucalyptus monocultures, introducing nitrogen-fixing trees
   to Eucalyptus plantations with appropriate mixture proportions have the
   potential to increase productivity while maintaining soil fertility. Two
   mechanisms account for the improved nutrient availability: litter
   decomposition and root interaction. We hypothesise that the former
   mechanism may primarily contribute to the improvements in some arid
   regions where the soil is highly rocky. To test our hypothesis, the
   effects of admixed litter decomposition and root interaction on
   Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Leucaena leucocephala growth were
   investigated in a valley-type savanna.
   After 10 years, E. camaldulensis growth in the mixed-species plantations
   was unaffected by root overlapping with L. leucocephala. E.
   camaldulensis grew significantly faster in the plots with admixture of
   litters in the mixed-species plantations than those without admixture.
   The admixed litter decomposition, rather than root interaction, is a
   primary contributor to E. camaldulensis growth in plantations with L.
   leucocephala in the valley-type savanna. The rocky soils in the savanna
   may block root overlapping by greatly inhibiting root extension of both
   tree species. The admixture of litters produces an increase in the
   supply and availability of soil nutrients that are returned to the E.
   camaldulensis rows via the admixed litters, due to the enhancement of
   the quantity, quality and decomposition rates of the leaf mixtures.
   These factors promote the growth of E. camaldulensis, and this effect
   may have implications for the necessity of litter management for
   Eucalyptus plantations in certain regions with arid climate and rocky
   soil. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The nutritive value of four tropical forage legumes grown during the dry
   season was assessed by gas production, microbial adhesion and in vitro N
   degradation and intestinal digestion. Species tested were: Leucaena
   leucocephala (Ll), Cajanus cajan (Cc), Neonotonia wightii (Nw) and
   Stylosanthes macrocephala (Sin). Chemical analysis showed higher
   lignification of Sm (187 g acid detergent lignin, ADL/kg dry matter, DM)
   compared with Nw (92 g ADL/kg DM), and a higher concentration of
   extractable and fibre-bound condensed tannins (CT) in browse (Ll and Cc)
   than in herbaceous (Nw and Sm) legumes (82, 110, 6 and 6 total CT/kg DM,
   respectively). A higher total gas volume occurred for Nw (18 8, 163, 146
   and 130 ml gas/g DM for Nw, Ll, Cc and Sm, respectively; P < 0.001).
   Rates of fermentation at 24 h were 0.069, 0.027, 0.046 and 0.051 h(-1)
   for Nw, Ll, Cc and Sm (P < 0.001). The DM degradation of the legume
   species ranked them similar to gas production. There were no differences
   among legumes in microbial adhesion patterns, nor major differences in
   enzymatic activity against structural polysaccharides until 32 h, but
   then Nw showed higher total cellulase (P < 0.001), xylanase (P < 0.001),
   beta-glucosidase (P < 0.01) and P-xylosidase (P < 0.05) activities than
   Ll and Cc. In vitro nitrogen disappearance after 32 h incubation was
   higher for Nw, intermediate for Sin and lowest for Ll and Cc (P <
   0.001), probably because of the high CT concentration in the latter.
   Intestinal digestion of Ll and Cc was also low, suggesting that CT may
   still be impeding digestion to a certain extent at this site. (C) 2002

   families and 26 genera, with herbs comprising 62.068\% of the dominant
   types. Among the tested plants, Leucaena leucocephala, Rumex acetosa,
   Festuca rubra, and Salix balfouriana exhibited significantly higher
   metal enrichment and transfer capacities, rendering them for ecological
   restoration. Salix balfouriana with the highest comprehensive membership
   function score of 5.298 was identified as the preferred species for
   ecological restoration in the Dongchuan Cu tailing area. Correlation
   analysis revealed a positive relationship between the metal content in
   underground plant parts and both the total metal content and organic
   matter (OM) in the rhizosphere soil, whereas a negative correlation was
   observed with soil pH.Discussion The soil in the Dongchuan Cu tailing
   area is severely contaminated by metals, mainly Cu. Among the identified
   plants, S. balfouriana emerged as the most suitable candidate for metal
   accumulation. This study establishes a comprehensive theoretical
   framework for the application and promotion of phytoremediation
   technology in the Dongchuan copper tailings area.},

Abstract = {in this work, we characterized various unconventional pulping raw
   materials in terms of their contents in hollocelulose, a-cellulose,
   lignin, ethanol-benzene extractables, ash, and hot water and 1\% soda
   solubles. Also, we characterized pulp obtained from each material by
   using an ethyleneglycol concentration of 65\% at 180 degrees C for 75
   min, followed by beating at 1500 revolutions in a PFI refiner-all of
   which are compatible with existing facilities for Kraft and soda pulping
   processes.
   We characterized vine shoots, cotton stalks, Leucaena leucocephala and
   Chamaecytisus proliferus as pulping raw materials and found Ch.
   proliferus and cotton stalks to be the best for the intended purpose on
   the grounds of their increased contents in holocellulose (79.73 and
   72.86\%) and a-cellulose (45.37 and 58.48\%), and their decreased
   contents in ethanol-benzene extractables (2.64 and 1.42\%), hot water
   solubles (2.79 and 3.33\%) and 1\% soda solubles (16.67 and 20.34\%).
   These properties resulted in increased pulp yields and hence in
   efficient use of these two types of raw material.
   The paper sheets obtained of different pulps were characterized and
   those from Ch. proliferus found to be the best overall as they exhibited
   an increased breaking length (4644 m), stretch (2.87\%), burst index
   (2.46 kN/g) tear index (0.33 mN m(2)/g) and brightness (49.92\% ISO); in
   addition Ch. proliferus pulp was obtained with a high yield (62.88\%).
   On the other hand, vine shoots provided the poorest results among the
   studied raw materials. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Research on fly-ash utilization in dryland Alfisols in semi-arid
   tropical India may help successful establishment of agroforestry
   systems. A field study was conducted during 2001-2004 with the objective
   of evaluating fly-ash using different levels (0, 17, 33, and 66\% v/v)
   in tree microsites along with compost and tank silt mixtures.
   Specifically, the focus was to find the optimum dose of fly-ash mixtures
   for tree growth and nutrient release with time of both essential and
   heavy elements in fly-ash and soil: phosphorus (P), potassium (K),
   calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), aluminium (Al), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd)
   and their effect on plant tissues with respect to copper (Cu), Zn, Cd,
   nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb). The changes in
   plant-available or extractable status of elements and the growth of two
   major tree species {[}viz., teak (Tectona grandis) and leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala)] were monitored at 6-month intervals during
   2002-2004 in an agrisilvicultural system. Pit mixtures with 66\% fly-ash
   by volume of pit significantly increased the tree growth of teak
   throughout the study period. For leucaena, it positively influenced the
   growth at initial stages. The dose increased the status of available P,
   K, Ca, and Na during the study period. The exchangeable Al and available
   Zn content of microsites corresponding to the dose significantly
   increased during 2001-2003 but the levels were less than the toxic
   limits. The available Cd content showed an increase only during the
   initial stage of the study period. The variation in heavy-metal content
   (Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in plant tissues among the different
   treatments was found to be nonsignificant.},

   genomic fingerprints with BOX, ERIC, and REP primers. Cluster analysis
   of 16S rDNA restriction patterns with four tetrameric endonucleases
   grouped the Canarian isolates with the two reference strains,
   Bradyrhizabium japonicum USDA 110spc4 and Bradyrhizobium sp. strain
   (Centrosema) CIAT 3101, resolving three genotypes within these
   bradyrhizobia. In the analysis of IGS RFLPs with three enzymes, six
   groups were found, whereas rep-PCR fingerprinting revealed an even
   greater genotypic diversity, with only two of the Canarian strains
   having similar fingerprints. Furthermore, we show that IGS RFLPs and
   even very dissimilar rep-PCR fingerprints can be clustered into
   phylogenetically sound groupings by combining them with 16S rDNA RFLPs
   in computer-assisted cluster analysis of electrophoretic patterns. The
   DNA sequence analysis of a highly variable 264-bp segment of the 16S
   rRNA genes of these strains was found to be consistent with the
   fingerprint-based classification. Three different DNA sequences were
   obtained, one of which was not previously described, and all belonged to
   the B. japoaicum/Rhodopseudomonas rDNA cluster. Nodulation assays
   revealed that none of the Canarian isolates nodulated Glycine max or

Abstract = {Competition for growth resources between woody and crop species is said
   to be the main reason for failure of hedgerow intercropping
   (alleycropping) in semiarid tropics, but the mechanisms of competition
   are not clearly understood. Tn this study, conducted in the semiarid
   highlands of Kenya, soil-water changes and root dynamics were monitored
   during two rainy seasons from a long-term, replicated, alleycropping
   experiment. The treatments were (i) maize (Zea mays L.) grown alone,
   without fertilizer; (ii) maize, without fertilizer, intercropped between
   hedgerows of leucaena {[}Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit], with
   hedgerow prunings returned to the alleys; and (iii) maize grown alone,
   with fertilizer at 40 kg N and 18 kg P ha(-1). Available water in 1.25 m
   of soil depth under alleycropping was lower than with maize alone.
   Depletion of soil water by hedgerows continued after maize harvest and
   carried water deficits in alleycropping from one season to the next.
   Leucaena provided 1.45 Mg ha(-1) leaf biomass, which contained 41.6 kg N
   and 2.5 kg P ha(-1); moreover, it added 0.51 Mg ha(-1) season(-1) of
   root biomass to the soil, equivalent to 7 kg N and 0.2 kg P ha(-1).
   Therefore, N contributed through the alleycropping system was equivalent
   to the recommended fertilizer level; the system, however, did not meet
   the P requirements of the crop. Maize did not respond to fertilizer in
   both seasons, and the alleycropped maize yielded lower than the
   unfertilized maize. Our study indicates that under water-limiting
   conditions, alleycropping is detrimental to crop yields because
   competition of trees with crops for water outweighs the likely
   soil-fertility benefits.},

Abstract = {At present, the use of biofertilizers and protein plants in the
   nutrition of pastures and forage has increased. The investigation was
   carried out in the University Center of the municipality of Cumanayagua,
   county of Cienfuegos, Cuba with the objective of evaluating the response
   of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit to the inoculation of different
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) strains. The experiment was carried
   out in polyethylene bags. The experiment used a random blocks design
   with three replicates and the following treatments: \#1. Soil (Control
   treatment, without inoculation and NPK application), \#2. Soil +
   inoculation with the AMF strain F. mosseae/INCAM-2, \#3. Soil +
   inoculation with the AMF strain G. cubense/INCAM-4) and \#4. Soil + NPK
   fertilization at plant establishment application of NPK (25, 40 y 120 kg
   ha(-1) de N, P2O5 y K(2)0) + N at each cut at 70\% of the initial dose.
   The inoculation with AMF was simultaneous for all treatments. A
   establishment cut and five successive cuts were performed, with 51.33
   average days between them. The biomass production, the content of gross
   protein of L. leucocephala in each harvest and the cumulative total, as
   well as mycorrhizal effectiveness, were quantified. L. leucocephala
   positively responded to F. mosseae/INCAM-2 inoculation. Biomass
   production for cut increased between 31,50 \% (Treatment \#2) y 19,40 \%
   (Treatment \#3) with respect to control treatment. Inoculation with F.
   mosseae/INCAM-2 showed higher mycorrhizal effectiveness. The highest
   value in gross protein was obtained in the variant with mineral
   fertilization and the inoculated variants overcame the control
   treatment, with better performance than treatment \# 2 ( Soil+
   Funneliformis mosseae/INCAM-2).},

Abstract = {Infections caused by pathogenic bacteria are a recurring problem in the
   livestock sector, leading to significant economic losses in the
   livestock industry. One of the main strategies includes antibiotic
   therapy, however, its use is limited due to the fact that pathogenic
   bacteria present resistance to these drugs, which makes treatment
   against microbial infections difficult. Therefore, the proposed
   hypothesis was that the ethanolic extracts of native plants from the
   state of Sonora, Mexico, are capable of inhibiting the growth of Gram
   (+) and Gram (-) pathogenic bacteria related to common infections in the
   livestock industry. The objective was to evaluate the phytochemical and
   antimicrobial profile of native plants from the state of Sonora, Mexico.
   In this study, 17 ethanolic extracts of native plants from Sonora were
   obtained, and the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the agar
   diffusion method and by the microdilution technique using reference
   bacteria from the ATCC collection. The phytochemical profile was
   evaluated by spectrophotometry and the experimental design used was a
   completely randomized design with 3 repetitions per treatment at 95\%
   reliability. The results showed that the extracts of Prosopis velutina,
   Ibervillea sonorae, Populus alba, Ambrosia ambrosioides, Krameria
   sonorae, and Leucaena leucocephala were effective in killing Listeria
   monocytogenes ATCC 19115, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia
   coli ATCC 25922, and Salmonella enterica serovar. Typhimurium ATCC 14028
   (p <= 0.05). In addition, these extracts presented the highest
   concentration of total polysaccharides, flavones and flavonols,
   flavanones and dihydroflavonols, tannins and total chlorogenic acid (p
   <= 0.05). Therefore, the extracts of the plants of Sonora, Mexico,
   represent a natural alternative for the control of Gram (+) and Gram (-)
   pathogens of importance for the livestock industry.},

Abstract = {Two bacterial strains isolated from root nodules of soybean were
   characterized phylogenetically as members of a distinct group in the
   genus Ensifer based on 16S rRNA gene comparisons. They were also
   verified as a separated group by the concatenated sequence analyses of
   recA, atpD and glnII (with similarities <= 93.9\% to the type strains
   for defined species), and by the average nucleotide identities (ANI)
   between the whole genome sequence of the representative strain CCBAU
   251167(T) and those of the closely related strains in Ensifer glycinis
   and Ensifer fredii (90.5\% and 90.3\%, respectively). Phylogeny of
   symbiotic genes (nodC and nifH) grouped these two strains together with
   some soybean-nodulating strains of E. fredii, E. glycinis and Ensifer
   sojae. Nodulation tests indicated that the representative strain CCBAU
   251167(T) could form root nodules with capability of nitrogen fixing on
   its host plant and Glycine soja, Cajanus cajan, Vigna unguiculata,
   Phaseolus vulgaris and Astragalus membranaceus, and it formed
   ineffective nodules on Leucaena leucocephala. Strain CCBAU 251167(T)
   contained fatty acids 18:1 omega 9c, 18:0 iso and 20:0, differing from
   other related strains. Utilization of L-threonine and D-serine as carbon
   source, growth at pH 6.0 and intolerance of 1\% (w/v) NaCI distinguished
   strain CCBAU 251167(T) from other type strains of the related species.
   The genome size of CCBAU 251167(T) was 6.2 Mbp, comprising 7,581
   predicted genes with DNA G+C content of 59.9 mol\% and 970 unique genes.
   Therefore, a novel species, Ensifer shofinae sp. nov., is proposed, with
   CCBAU 251167(T) (=ACCC 19939(T) = LMG 29645(T)) as type strain. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Quantification of the fate of residue N is essential in low-input
   tropical cropping systems for the development of management practices
   that optimize N-use efficiency. The recovery of N from N-15-labeled
   leucaena {[}Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] and dactyladenia
   {[}Dactyladenia barteri (Hook f ex Oliv.) Engl.] leaf residues was
   followed in the soil, crop, and hedgerow of the respective alley
   cropping systems during three maize (Zea mays L.) and two cowpea (Vigna
   unguiculata L. Walp. subsp. unguiculata) seasons. More residue N was
   recovered in the top 5 cm of soil in the leucaena than in the
   dactyladenia microplot during the first 471 d after residue application
   (DAA). The first maize crop recovered 8.6 and 5.2\% of the N from
   leucaena and dactyladenia, respectively, while the two subsequent crops
   recovered <1\%. The cowpea plants in the leucaena and dactyladenia
   microplots contained 0.5 and 1.1\% of the residue N in the first
   harvest, Sixteen and 9\% of the residue N was recovered by the leucaena
   hedgerow in the first and second pruning following residue application.
   The dactyladenia hedges recovered maximally 3.1\% of the residue N in a
   single pruning, The total N recovery in the leucaena microplots was
   approximate to 90\% at 120 and 471 DAA, compared with 56 and 35\% in the
   dactyladenia microplots. At 858 DAA, 62\% of the added leucaena N was
   accounted for, compared with 25\% of the dactyladenia N. Residue quality
   was shown to have a major impact on the dynamics of applied residue N in
   alley cropping systems and will be an important factor in deciding which

Abstract = {The quantities of earthworm surface casts were monitored in traditional
   bush fallow regrowth (BFR), Pueraria phaseoloides live mulch (PLM),
   Leucaena leucocephala alley cropping (LAC) and undisturbed forest. The
   fallow systems were planted to maize/cassava intercrop either
   permanently or for one year after three years of fallow i.e. al 100 and
   25\% cropping frequencies. Earthworm casting activity was lower in
   fields cropped after clearing three year old fallow than in the
   respective permanently cropped fallow management system. The reduction
   in casting was related both to the degree of biomass removed through
   burning and to re-establishment of cover crops. Higher exchangeable
   cation concentration in the soil did not cause increased casting
   activity.
   Concentrations of organic C, total N and exchangeable Ca and Mg in casts
   were significantly higher than in the 0-15 cm topsoil. Exchangeable Ca
   and Mg in casts did not significantly differ between treatments, with
   the exception of significantly higher Mg in casts after three years of
   P. phaseoloides fallow. Topsoil (0-15 cm) exchangeable Ca and Mg were
   not correlated with cast exchangeable Ca and Mg,but concentrations of
   organic C and total N in casts were significantly correlated with
   organic C and total N in the topsoil. Coefficients of variability of
   organic C, total N and exchangeable Ca and Mg were about twice as high
   in the soil than in casts. Significant negative correlations between the
   cast to soil ratio (cast enrichment factor) of organic C, total N and
   exchangeable Ca and Mg and the respective concentrations in the soil
   show that earthworms are increasingly selective in organic carbon and
   nutrient uptake as these parameters of soil fertility are declining.},

Title = {Weed seedbank response to planted fallow and tillage in southwest
   Nigeria},

Year = {2005},
Volume = {63},

Pages = {299-306},
Abstract = {Planted fallows are an alternative to the unsustainable bush fallow for
   improved soil and weed management in the tropics. However, the
   interactive effects of planted fallows and tillage on the weed seedbank
   are not well documented in the tropical environment. The effect of
   fallow type and tillage on the weed seedbank in the soil was assessed in
   1995 and 1996 at Ibadan, southwest Nigeria. The planted fallow species
   consisted of a herbaceous legume (Pueraria phaseoloides) and three woody
   legumes (Acacia auriculiformis, Leucaena leucocephala, and Senna
   siamea). Natural bush fallow and continuous cassava/maize plots were
   controls. Tillage treatments were minimum tillage and mounding.
   Continuous maize/cassava plots had the largest weed seedbank in both
   years. After six years of continuous fallow, the weed seedbank was 86\%
   lower in A. auriculiformis, 79\% in R phaseoloides, 68\% in S. siamea,
   53\% in L. leucocephala, and 35\% in natural bush fallow plots than in
   continuously cultivated plots. Compared to minimum tillage, mounding
   reduced the seedbank by 47\% in 1995 and 66\% in 1996. Redundancy
   analysis showed that tillage contributed significantly to the variance
   in species composition. Euphorbia hyssopifolia, E. heterophylla, and
   Cynodon dactylon showed no preference in terms of tillage. Perennial and
   annual grasses (Digitaria horizontalis, Eleusine indica, Paspalum
   orbiculare, Cynodon dactylon) with Cyathula prostrata and Desmodium
   scorpiurus, an annual and perennial broadleaf, respectively, were most
   abundant in the seedbank of continuously cultivated plots. There were
   more annual broadleaf weeds in the seedbank of planted fallow plots than
   in the control plots. Species diversity of the seedbank was greatest in
   plots under minimum tillage. Mounding as a seedbed preparation method,
   especially within the improved fallow system, could reduce the high weed
   pressure experienced by smallholder farmers in southwest Nigeria.},

Title = {From alley cropping to rotational fallow: Farmers' involvement in the
   development of fallow management techniques in the humid forest zone of
   Cameroon},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {115-120},
Abstract = {Alley cropping was introduced in the humid forest zone of Cameroon to
   increase soil fertility in 1987, but until 1992 the adoption rate had
   remained low. To better understand the reasons behind this, three types
   of on farm trials were established from fully researcher controlled to
   fully farmer controlled. During the evaluation of the technology with
   farmers a number of modifications were registered (1) Pruning height and
   frequency: Because of the difficulties to consistently cut back at 30
   cm, farmers decided to slash at ground level as they normally do while
   slashing the natural fallow vegetation. This equally allowed for more
   flexibility in time of pruning. (2) Cropping intensity and pattern:
   Initially, alleys were cropped each year. This however had several
   shortcomings. Having observed the positive impact of incidental fallow
   period in a farmer's field, it was decided to introduce a fallow phase
   of at least one year. During the fallow period the plot can be used for
   fodder production, bee farming and production of stakes. (3) Residue
   management: Fire went incidentally in a farmer's tree plot after
   slashing, and the trees were not affected. This gave farmers an
   alternative way to manage the residue, by controlling the fire, before
   bringing in other crops such as groundnut and cassava. (4) Agroforestry
   species: Because Leucaena leucocephala, in spite of it soil fertility
   restoration potential, rapidly became a noxious weed, farmers have asked
   for a less invasive species. Calliandra calothyrsus was introduced for
   this purpose and became a good bee forage. With these modifications, the
   original alley cropping system has evolved into a rotational tree fallow
   with higher adoption potential. From about 15 farmers who were testing
   the technology in 1992, the number increased to 52 in 1996, 120 in 1997
   and 236 in 1998.},

Abstract = {The unintended impact of natural summer fire on soil is complicated and
   rather less studied than its above-ground impact. Recognising the impact
   of a fire on silvopastoral soils and their resilience can aid in
   improving the management of silvopastoral systems. We studied the
   immediate (after 1 week (W)) and short-term (after 3 months (M))
   recovery of different soil biological and chemical properties after the
   natural fire, with specific emphasis on phosphorus (P) dynamics. Soil
   samples were collected from four different layers (0-15, 15-30, 30-45,
   and 45-60 cm) of Morus alba, Leucaena leucocephala, and Ficus infectoria
   based silvopastoral systems. In the 0-15 cm soil layer, soil organic
   carbon (SOC) declined by-37, 42, and 30\% after the fire in Morus-,
   Leucaena-, and Ficus -based systems, respectively within 1W of fire.
   However, after 3M of fire, Morus and Leucaena regained-6 and 11.5\% SOC
   as compared to their status after 1W in the 0-15 cm soil layer. After 1W
   of the fire, soil nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and potassium availability
   declined significantly at 0-15 cm soil layer in all systems. Iron and
   manganese availability improved significantly after 1W of the fire.
   Saloid bound P and aluminium bound P declined significantly immediately
   after the fire, increasing availability in all systems. However, calcium
   bound P did not change significantly after the fire. Dehydrogenase and
   alkaline phosphatase activity declined significantly after the fire,
   however, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activity were unaltered.
   Resiliencies of these soil properties were significantly impacted by
   soil depth and time. Path analysis indicated microbial activity and
   cationic micronutrients majorly governed the resilience of soil P
   fractions and P avail-ability. Pasture yield was not significantly
   improved after the fire, so natural summer fire must be prevented to
   avoid loss of SOC, N, and S.},

Abstract = {Angola is one of the most neglected African countries in terms of
   botanical research, in respect of both native and naturalized species.
   We conducted a rapid assessment of invasive plant species in western
   Angola during August 2014. In thirteen primary vegetation types, we
   recorded populations of 44 naturalized plant species, nineteen of which
   are conclusively invasive (spreading far from introduction sites). Dense
   invasive populations of Chromolaena odorata, Inga vera and Opuntia
   stricta pose the greatest environmental and economic threats. Some
   species with known taxonomic and/or biogeographic uncertainties (e.g.
   Chromolaena odorata and Ageratina adenophora) or which lacked key
   characteristics for identification such as flowers during our survey
   (e.g. Eucalyptus spp.) were subjected to DNA barcoding for comparisons
   with available genetic data from other studies. This approach allowed us
   to confirm the identity of taxonomically challenging taxa such as Inga
   vera, Opuntia stricta and Prosopis chilensis, to conclusively
   differentiate Chromolaena odorata from Ageratina adenophora, and
   identify the subspecific identity of Acacia saligna. Canonical
   correspondence analysis was used to assess the presence and abundance of
   invasive plant species with respect to the major abiotic factors and
   vegetation types. Three fairly distinct groups of species emerge from
   this analysis: (i) species of dry lowland habitats (Calotropis gigantea,
   Leucaena leucocephala and Opuntia stricta); (ii) species of relatively
   wet habitats at mid elevations (Ageratum conyzoides, Bidens pilosa,
   Cardiospermum grandiflorum, Chromolaena odorata, Solanum mauritianum and
   Tithonia diversifolia); and (iii) upland species (Ageratina adenophora,
   Galinsoga parviflora and Tagetes minuta). Several invasive species that
   are widespread in other tropical and subtropical African countries are
   currently either missing (e.g. many Australian Acacia species, Azolla
   filiculoides, Broussonetia papyrifera, Clidemia hirta, Parthenium
   hysterophorus, Rubus rosaefolius, Salvinia molesta), have only very
   localized populations in Angola (e.g. Lantana camara, Prosopis
   chilensis) or exist only as planted individuals (e.g. Acacia mearnsii
   and A. saligna subsp. saligna).},

   consisted of three useful plants, totaling three plots per block, and
   four repetitions. Plants were cut at 1 m height at intervals of 70 days;
   samples of leaf plus stem with a diameter smaller than 4 mm were
   collected for determination of dry matter, crude protein, neutral
   detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, insoluble protein bound to acid
   detergent fiber and in vitro dry matter digestibility. The anatomical
   characterization occurred through the analysis of the proportion of
   plant tissue nonincubated and incubated in the rumen for a period of 48
   hours. The legumes had high crude protein, with an average of 26.1\% to
   Leucena, 22.4\% to Sabia and 18.5\% to Mororo, and low levels of in
   vitro digestibility of dry matter, with an average of 47.3\% to Leucena,
   42.8\% to Mororo and 37.2\% to Sabia. In the leaf blade of Sabia plants,
   much lignified tissues that differed from plants of Leucena and Mororo
   were observed. The degradation process was more visible in the leaves of
   the Leucena, Sabia and Mororo plants. The degradation was more
   pronounced in the spongy parenchyma, leaving the incubated material

Abstract = {An experiment was undertaken to determine the effect of intercropping
   corn (Zea mays) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) at the sowing time on the
   establishment of a silvopastoral system leucaena-guinea grass. A random

   leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv Peru) and guinea grass (Panicum
   maximum cv Likoni) intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata cv
   Cubanita 666), B) leucaena and guinea grass intercopped with cultivated
   corn (Zea mays), C) leucaena and guinea grass intercropped with
   non-cultivated com, two weeks after the sowing, and D) non-intercropped
   leucaena and guinea grass. The work was developed on a red ferralic
   soil. The sowing of leucaena and guinea grass was conducted in the rainy
   season. The former was sown in doble furrows 0.7 m apart and at 3 m of
   distance between them and at 0.50 m between plants. The grass was spread
   on the plot at a dosage of 0.5 kg/ha of PGS. The measurements were:
   population, plant height, yield of leucaena, guinea grass and the crops,
   as well as the presence of weeds. The leucaena population was affected
   when intercropped with the seasonal legume (P < 0.01). The leucaena
   yield was higher (P < 0.01) when intercropped with corn and there was
   cultivation. The poorest performance corresponded to the cowpea
   intercropping. The guinea grass yield was higher (P < 0.001) when
   intercropped with com. The weeds prevailed when there was no
   intercropping. It is recommended to increase the silvopastoral systems
   leucaena-guinea grass using the intercropping with com. Besides, it is
   necessary to deepen into the research on the cowpea variety Cubanita 666
   and further study other seasonal crops to diversify the use of this

Abstract = {Reforestation plays an important role in the carbon cycle and climate
   change. However, knowledge of ecosystem carbon sequestration through
   reforestation with mixed species is limited. Especially in dry hot
   valley of the Jinsha River, no studies cover total ecosystem carbon
   sequestration level in mature mixed plantations for a limited area of
   mixed plantations and difficulty in the sampling of plant roots and deep
   soil. In this study, carbon sequestration of seven mixed plantations of
   different ages in dry hot valley of the Jinsha River was investigated
   with analogous sites method. The results are as follows: 1) Deep soil
   organic carbon (SOC) storage significantly increased with stand age (p =
   0.025), possibly due to fine root exudates and dissolved organic carbon
   transportation into deep soil and retention. 2) Total biomass carbon
   storage in the 30-year-old mixed plantation was 77.78 t C ha(-1), 54
   times reference wasteland and 9 times reference natural recovery
   shrub-grassland. However, total biomass carbon storage of 30-year-old
   mixed plantation was insignificantly lower than that of reference
   natural forest (p = 0.429). After 30 years of reforestation, plantation
   biomass carbon storage recovered to reference level, and its
   sequestration rate was 2.54 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). 3) The total ecosystem
   carbon storage of 30-year-old mixed plantation was 185.50 t C ha(-1),
   2.38 times reference wasteland, 2.29 times reference natural recovery
   shrub grassland, and 29\% lower than reference natural forest. It
   indicated that niche complementary, good stand structure, and
   characteristics of dominant species Leucaena leucocephala in mixed
   plantations facilitate more rapid carbon sequestration, especially
   biomass carbon in the dry hot valley.},

Abstract = {Trees and shrubs have been recognized as a strategic resource to improve
   cattle systems. The objective of the present study was to identify woody
   species with fodder potentia I for the cattle systems in the northern
   mountains region of Chiapas, Mexico, incorporating the farmers'
   perceptions, chemical-nutritional analysis, and in vitro and in situ
   digestibility assays of the foliage. Through participatory workshops,
   the farmers recognized 60 useful woody species within the grazing areas.
   Of these, 18 are consumed by the cattle and they have multiple uses.
   Based on the perception and qualification of the farmers, the most
   promising fodder trees with the potential to be incorporated in a
   silvopastoral system were identified: Pithecellobium dulce, Guazuma
   ulmifolia, Leucaena leucocephola, Leucaena esculenta, Gliricidia sepium,
   Saurauia scabrida, Chromolaena sp, Erythrina chiapasana, Acacia
   pennatula, Acacia angustissima, Eysenhardtia adenostylis, Calliandra
   houstoniana and Mimosa albida. Samples of tree foliage from two seasons
   of the year and from different grazing areas were collected, chemical
   composition and in vitro digestibility parameters of the foliage of
   these trees differed significantly between the wet and dry season. By
   means of a digestibility in situ assay with bovines, foliage of: Acacia
   angusstisima, Acacia pennatula, Eysenhardtia adenostylis, Chromolaena
   sp, and Saurauia scabrida was evaluated and it was shown that among them
   there is a high variation in the potential of degradation, rate of
   degradation and effective degradability of the dry matter. Four species
   are promising for the tropical part of the region (Pithecellobium dulce,
   Guazuma ulmifolia, Leucaena leucocephala and L. esculenta), two for the
   temperate zone (Saurauia scabrida and Chromolaena sp) and three that can
   be used in a large altitudinal range (Erythrina chiapasana, Acacia

Pages = {91-106},
Abstract = {Adapted tree+grass combinations make a valuable contribution to forage
   production in the Indian peninsula, but knowledge of the interactive
   effects between trees and grasses on their production is limited. We,
   therefore, conducted a field experiment involving combinations of four
   trees and grasses, besides monospecific grass controls, for seven years,
   to investigate grass productivity in association with leguminous and
   non- leguminous multipurpose trees (MPT) having disparate canopy
   architecture, and to assess the end-of-rotation soil fertility changes.
   Post rotation changes in herbage productivity were evaluated by growing
   teosinte (Zea mexicana) for three years. The four MPTs were Acacia
   auriculiformis, Ailanthus triphysa, Casuarina equisetifolia and Leucaena
   leucocephala. Grasses included Pennisetum purpureum (hybrid napier),
   Brachiaria ruziziensis (congo signal), Panicum maximum (guinea grass)
   and teosinte. Lower tree branches were pruned from fifth year.
   Understorey herbage production increased until three years in all
   tree+grass combinations, but declined subsequently, as tree crowns
   expanded. Overall, casuarina among MPTs, and hybrid napier and guinea
   grass among forage crops, were more productive than others. Pruning MPTs
   generally favoured greater herbage production. Understorey light levels
   for acacia, ailanthus, casuarina and leucaena were 17, 60, 55 and 55\%
   of that in the open at five years. During the post-rotation phase, MPT
   plots were characterised by higher soil nutrient capital and
   consequently teosinte yields were higher than in the treeless control
   treatment. All previous tree-grass combinations showed an increasing
   trend till two years after MPT felling. Yield levels declined
   subsequently, despite at variable rates. Careful selection of the tree
   and grass components is, therefore, crucial for optimising herbage
   productivity in silvopastoral systems.},

Abstract = {oil organic matter (SOM) has a key role in maintaining soil fertility in
   weathered soils in the tropics. This study was conducted to determine
   the contribution of different SOM fractions to the cation exchange
   capacity (CEC) of a tropical soil as influenced by organic matter inputs
   of different biochemical composition. Soil samples were collected from a
   16-yr old arboretum established on a Ferric Lixisol, under five
   multipurpose tree species: Leucaena leucocephala, Dactyladenia barteri,
   Afzelia africana, Pterocarpus santalinoides, and Treculia africana.
   Fractions were obtained by wet sieving and sedimentation after
   dispersion with Na2CO3. Fractions larger than 0.053 mm were separated
   into mineral and organic components by flotation on water. Relationships
   between CEC and pH were determined using the silverthioureum-method. For
   all treatments the organic fractions had the highest CEC, expressed on a
   dry matter basis, and the CEC of the fractions smaller than 0.053 mm was
   inversely related to their particle size: clay (< 0.002 mm) > fine silt
   (0.002-0.02 mm) > coarse silt (0.02-0.053 mm). A positive correlation
   (significant at the 0.01 probability level) existed between the slope of
   the fitted CEC-pH relationships and the organic C concentrations of the
   whole soil and both silt fractions. The clay and fine silt fractions
   were responsible for 85 to 90\% of the CEC of the soil. Organic inputs
   with a high C/N and lignin/N ratio produced fine and coarse silt sized
   SOM fractions with the highest charge density. Therefore, inputs of
   slowly decomposing organic residues seem to be promising for increasing
   the CEC of highly weathered soils.},

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted in 1990 and 1991 at the International
   Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Nigeria to study the
   role of earthworms in the decomposition of plant residue mulches with
   different qualities. Five mulches of Dactyladenia barteri, Gliricidia
   sepium, Leucaena leucocephala prunings, maize (Zea mays) stover and rice
   (Oryza sativa) straw, which had a wide range of C-to-N ratio, lignin and
   polyphenol concentrations were studied. Based on their chemical
   compositions, Dactyladenia prunings were defined as low-quality mulch,
   Leucaena and Gliricidia prunings as high quality-mulches, and maize
   stover and rice straw as intermediate-quality mulches. The mean density
   of earthworms (Hyperiodrilus africanus and Eudrilus eugeniae) in the
   experimental plots decreased in the following order: high quality >
   intermediate quality > low quality mulches. High quality mulch (Leucaena
   and Gliricidia prunings) supported 54\% higher earthworm populations
   than the (no mulch) control, whereas low-quality mulch (Dactyladenia
   prunings) only increased earthworm density by 15\%, compared to the
   control in 1990. Plots with Leucaena and Gliricidia prunings had the
   highest earthworm populations at the initial stage of the experiment,
   while the other treatments showed increased earthworm numbers at a later
   stage. Effects of earthworms on mulch decomposition were examined in the
   field in large pots with or without earthworms (Eudrilus eugeniae). The
   effects of earthworms were more pronounced for Dactyladenia prunings
   (low quality), than for Leucaena and Gliricidia prunings (high quality).
   The results indicate that manipulation of earthworm activity with
   application of high- and low-quality mulches may improve the
   synchronization of soil nutrient supply and crop nutrient demand. (C)

Abstract = {Effect of supplementation of leaves from fodder trees such as Leucaena
   leucocephala, Sesbania grandiflora and Gliricidia maculata on dry matter
   (DM) intake and nutrient digestibility of hybrid napier grass (1.14\%
   nitrogen) based rations was evaluated in two experiments with native
   Nellore Brown sheep.
   In Experiment 1, sheep received four dietary treatments, hybrid napier
   grass (NB-21) ad libitum (control) or grass plus 600 g day(-1) of one of
   the three fodder tree leaves to have a grass:tree leaf ratio of 60:40 on
   DM basis. Supplementation with leucaena, sesbania and gliricidia
   decreased the total DM intake (g DM day(-1)) of the ration from 414
   (control) to 392, 351 and 387, respectively. However, the effect of
   supplementation on DM intake was not significant (P > 0.05). Crude
   protein digestibility was significantly (P < 0.05) improved in all
   supplementation treatments. Sheep in an the four treatments were in
   positive N, Ca and P balance.
   Rumen degradability of fodder tree leaves was studied using the nylon
   bag technique in association with the fermentation characteristics of
   sheep fed rations containing different tree leaves in Experiment 2.
   Sesbania leaf was highly degradable in the rumen with 73\% of the DM
   disappearing after 24 h incubation. In contrast, leucaena and gliricidia
   leaves exhibited a low degradability of 64.5\% and 72.7\%, respectively,
   after 48 h in the rumen. Effective degradation of DM was highest with
   sesbania (64.2\%), intermediate with gliricidia (55.9\%) and least with
   leucaena (41.6\%). The relative ability of the fodder tree leaves to
   improve the total tract digestion of NB-21 grass is discussed,
   particularly in relation to rumen degradability of DM.},

Abstract = {Major regional gaps exist in the reporting and accessibility of
   naturalized plant species distribution data, especially within Southeast
   Asia. Here, we present the Malesian Naturalized Alien Flora database
   (MalNAF), the first standardized island-group level checklist of
   naturalized vascular plant species for the Malesian phytogeographical
   region. We used MalNAF to investigate the composition, origins, and
   habitat preferences of the naturalized flora. The naturalized vascular
   flora of Malesia consists of at least 1177 species. Richness is highest
   in the Philippines (539 spp.) and lowest in the Maluku Islands (87
   spp.). But, the Lesser Sunda Islands had the highest naturalized species
   richness relative to native richness and Singapore has a higher
   naturalized plant species richness than would be expected given its
   size. When comparing the data for Malesia with a global dataset, we
   found that naturalized richness increased with area for islands but not
   for continental regions. Across the archipelago, 31 species are
   widespread, occurring in every island group, but the majority have a
   limited distribution of 2.4 +/- 2.3 (mean +/- SD) island groups per
   naturalized species. The naturalized plant species are representatives
   of 150 families, twenty of which are newly introduced to the region.
   Families richest in naturalized plant species in Malesia were Fabaceae
   (= Leguminosae) (160 spp.), Poaceae (= Gramineae) (138 spp.), and
   Asteraceae (= Compositae) (96 spp.). Most of these have a native range
   that includes tropical Asia, closely followed by those from Southern
   America (inclusive of the Caribbean, Central and South America),
   although at the island-group level, most have a higher proportion with a
   Southern American native range. Most naturalized species occur in
   anthropogenic habitats, but many are present in ``natural{''} habitats
   with fewer species, such as Leucaena leucocephala, reported from
   specialized habitats like drylands. MalNAF provides a baseline for
   future studies of naturalized plant species distributions in the region.},

Abstract = {The Center for Research in Sustainable Systems of Agricultural
   Production (CIPAV) has worked since 1991 on the establishment and
   management of intensive silvopastoral systems (ISPS) involving leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala). The initial work was carried out in the Valle
   del Cauca department, and afterwards in other regions of Colombia and
   abroad. This document presents the main characteristics of the work
   carried out on various farms in the tropical lowlands of Colombia,
   located between 0 and 1,300 masl, with 22-28 degrees C average annual
   temperature. The leucaena ISPS integrate this species with grasses,
   mainly Cynodon plectostachyus, C. nlemfuensis and Megathyrsus maximus,
   although other species have been used, such as Dichanthium annulatum,
   Urochloa humidicola (including cv. Llanero, formerly classified as
   Brachiaria dictyoneura) and Urochloa hybrids. Leucaena is planted at
   densities in excess of 10,000 plants per ha, in rows 1 to 1.5 m apart
   with 0.3-0.6 m between plants within rows. These ISPS are grazed by Bos
   indicus and B. taurus cattle and their crosses, in beef, dairy (tropical
   lowlands) and dual-purpose systems. The proper management of an ISPS
   requires a rotational grazing strategy with each paddock grazed for 1-3
   days (ideally 1 day) followed by a 42-46 day rest period. Stocking rates
   are 2.5-4.5 head/ha. Average daily gains by beef cattle are 650-800
   g/head (2-3 kg/ha/d). Production in dairy systems (tropical lowlands)
   fluctuates between 5 and 14 L milk/cow/d, depending on genetic makeup,
   season (dry or rainy) and supplementation, with up to 17,000 L
   milk/ha/yr. Information from various farms that use ISPS is presented
   including main ecological characteristics and animal performance.},

Abstract = {Most of the work discussed in the paper is part of the Agroforestry
   Research Network for Africa (AFRENA). In the sub-humid highlands the
   most common form of livestock management is a mixture of grazing,
   tethering and stall feeding. In the arid and semi-arid lowlands of Kenya
   the normal livestock management practice is grazing. Leucaena
   leucocephala was a popular fodder species until it was attacked by the
   leucaena psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana) to which other species like L.
   diversifolia, L. esculenta and L. pallida have shown some degree of
   tolerance. Sesbania spp. showed early promise but did not withstand
   intensive cutting management. In Kenya, when Calliandra calothyrsus is
   grown in 4:1 and 1:1 grass-legume combinations the fodder yields are
   higher than for pure hedgerows. Cutting C. calothyrsus 6 months before
   the height of the dry season gives maximum yield during that season. For
   dairy cows 1 kg of concentrates can be successfully replaced by 3 kg of
   fresh C. calothyrsus. At altitudes above 2300 m supplementation with
   Mimosa scabrella enabled local goats to gain 50 g day(-1) compared with
   31 g day(-1) for grass alone. In Kenya a survey was conducted on
   farmers' practices and knowledge of indigenous fodder trees. Some
   identified popular species were Commiphora zimmermanii, Triumfetta spp.,
   Tithonia diversifolia, Melia volkensii and Crotalaria goodiiformis. Both
   indigenous and exotic tree species are being fed to cattle to determine
   the exact parts that are consumed and to assess their nutritive value.
   Further research is needed on inclusion levels of tree fodder in diets,
   optimal management of fodder trees in the dry land farming systems and
   anti-nutritive factors in some tree species. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

   neutral detergent fibre (NDF), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE),
   metabolizable energy (ME), dry matter intake (DMI), dry matter
   digestibility (DMD) and relative feed value (RFV) as nutritive values,
   gas production (GP), methane production (MP), organic matter
   digestibility (OMD) as in vitro rumen fermentation parameters. Strained
   and anaerobically prepared rumen fluid was used for determining GP and
   OMD. Additionally, the correlations between chemical composition and
   fermentation characteristics were studied. The samples were collected in
   two rangeland areas in the Republic of Benin. The lowest and highest ADF
   contents were determined for CC (30.85\%) and PMCA (43.14\%). The lowest
   NDF content was found for CC (48.62\%). The highest GP (33.8\%) and ME
   (6.85 MJ/kg DM) have been determined for BR. The CC had the highest DMD
   (64.9\%) and RFV (124.1). The lowest MP (mL) was recorded in PMCA,

   content of forages was positively correlated with OMD, DMD, DMI, and
   RFV, while NDF was negatively correlated with GP, MP, OMD, DMD, DMI, and
   RFV. However, ADF was negatively correlated with GP, DMD, DMI, and RFV,

   materials used in the present study can be used as alternative forage
   sources in ruminant rations.},

   management},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {503},

Abstract = {The soil seed bank (SSB) in forests is a key indicator of their
   resilience after disturbances. Despite the growing interest in
   describing patterns of SSB and understanding potential processes
   underpinning those patterns, we still know little about SSB patterns and
   drivers in semi-deciduous tropical forests. Using the regeneration
   emergence method, we assessed the patterns of SSB (i) across four
   vegetation types with variable intensity of past human disturbances:
   typical dense forest - degraded dense forest - young preforest fallow -
   old preforest fallow, and (ii) in relationships to soil depth (0-5 cm,
   5-10 cm, 10-15 cm, 15-20 cm) in a protected tropical semi-deciduous
   dense forest in Benin, West-Africa. The standing vegetation (adults and
   regeneration) data and soil samples were collected using a systematic
   sampling of 60 plots of 10 m x 10 m in the four vegetation types.
   Herbaceous plants dominated (67\% - 78\%) the SSB. From the SSB, five
   tree species emerged: Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn., Dialium guineense
   Willd., Ficus sur Forssk., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit, and
   Lonchocarpus sericeus (Poir.) Kunth. Regarding tree species, the total
   densities of germinated seeds (seeds.m(-2)) were higher in typical dense
   forest (28.00 +/- 7.22) and young preforest fallow (16.67 +/- 7.07) than
   in old preforest fallow (10.00 +/- 6.75) and degraded dense forest (8.89
   +/- 3.81). When only tree species were considered, the SSB was more
   diverse and dense in typical dense forest than in other vegetation types
   suggesting negative effect of past human disturbances on SSB. The
   similarity of the species composition between the SSB and the
   surrounding vegetation was low (Jaccard's similarity index ranged from 0
   to 17.64\%, indicating that the majority of tree species in the
   surrounding vegetation were absent in the SSB. This study highlighted a
   need of planting effort of native tree species to restore degraded
   areas.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of an intensive
   silvo-pastoral system (ISPS), which is based on free access to Panicum
   maximum and Leucaena leucocephala, on the texture profile (TP),
   physico-chemical properties and ripening process of the Artisanal
   Tepeque Cheese (ATC), and to compare it with the ATC made with milk from
   the traditional production system (TPS). A batch of 48 cheeses was made,
   from this batch, 24 cheeses were made with milk from the ISPS and 24
   with milk from the TS; then they were divided into groups of six cheeses
   each and subjected to four periods of ripening (10, 45, 80 and 165
   days). All cheeses were subjected to a texture profile analysis (TPA). A
   completely randomized experimental design was used in order to determine
   the effect of the feeding system and ripening period on the TPA. No
   significant differences (P>0.05) were observed for most of the
   parameters of the TPA but hardness, which was higher in the ISPS
   (P<0.01). It is envisaged that the higher hardness in ISPS cheese could
   be attributed to the high content of polyphenols in leucaena forage.
   Polyphenols can be transported to the serum and the milk and therefore
   to the cheese. It is hypothesized that the presence of these antioxidant
   compounds probably reduced the proteolysis by the endogenous micro-flora
   of cheese, keeping for longer time its protein matrix, which is the main
   barrier to cheese deformation. Thus, it is suggested that the action of
   polyphenols resulted in a harder cheese. Significant differences
   (P<0,01) were observed between ripening periods as the ATC passes from a
   soft and sticky cheese to a hard and not sticky one. It is concluded
   that the ISPS has no significant effects on the overall TPA and its
   physico-chemical properties.},

   -0.13 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) from a worst-case millet-sorghum rotation to
   +0.43 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) on intensively managed agricultural fields.
   Agroforestry simulations involving Faidherbia albida (Del.) Chev. and
   Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) deWit. also resulted in promising carbon
   gain (+0.22 and +0.12 t C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively), suggesting that
   improving agricultural practices is key to enhancing food production and
   mitigating climate change. Results from a sensitivity analysis suggest
   that woody biomass carbon is more sensitive to long-term changes in
   precipitation and temperature than soil carbon. Other management
   strategies likely to result in lower rates of soil carbon sequestration,
   including short-term improved fallows, should also be considered viable
   opportunities because promoting too narrow a set of `best management
   practices' risks weakening local adaptability and opportunistic
   management regimes, both of which are crucial elements in small-scale
   farming systems in drylands. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 induced chlorosis in the leaves of its
   symbiotic hosts, common bean (Phaseohis vulgaris L.), siratro
   (Macroptilium atropurpureum Urb.), and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit. Chlorosis induction by strains CIAT899 and CT9005, an
   exopolysaccharide-deficient mutant of CIAT899, required carbon
   substrate. When the bacteria were added at planting in a solution of
   mannitol (50 g/liter), as few as 10(3) cells of CIAT899 were sufficient
   to induce chlorosis in bean plants. All carbon sources tested, including
   organic acids and mono- and disaccharides, supported chlorosis
   induction. The addition of a carbon source did not affect the growth
   rate or the population density of CT9005 in the bean plant rhizosphere.
   Cell-free filtrates of cultures of CT9005 did not induce detectable
   chlorosis. All type B strains of R. tropici tested also induced
   chlorosis in common bean. Type A strains of R. tropici and all other
   species of bacteria tested did not induce chlorosis. Several lines of
   evidence indicated that nodulation was not required for chlorosis
   induction. Strain RSP900, a pSym-cured derivative of CIAT899, induced
   chlorosis in wild-type P. vulgaris. In addition, NOD125, a
   nodulation-defective line of common bean, developed chlorosis when
   inoculated with CIAT899, but did not develop nodules. CIAT899
   consistently induced severe chlorosis in the leaves of the nonhost
   legumes alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and Berseem clover (Trifolium
   alexandrinum L.), and induced chlorosis in 29 to 58\% of the plants
   tested of sunflower, cucumber, and tomato seedlings, but it did not
   induce chlorosis in the leaves of corn or wheat. Chlorosis induction in
   nonhost plants also required carbon substrate. The data are consistent
   with the hypothesis that R. tropici type B strains produce a
   chlorosis-inducing factor that affects a wide range of plant species.},

Abstract = {Globally, biological invasions are considered as one of the major
   contributing factors for the loss of indigenous biological diversity.
   Hyperspectral remote sensing plays an important role in the detection
   and mapping of invasive plant species. The main objective of this study
   was to discriminate invasive plant species from adjacent native species
   using a ground-based hyperspectral sensor in two protected areas, Lehri
   Reserve Forest and Jindi Reserve Forest in Punjab, Pakistan. Field
   spectral measurements were collected using an ASD FieldSpec
   handheld2(TM) spectroradiometer (325-1075 nm) and the discrimination
   between native and invasive plant species was evaluated statistically
   using hyperspectral indices as well as leaf wavelength spectra. Finally,
   spectral separability was calculated using Jeffries Matusita distance
   index, based on selected wavebands. The results reveal that there were
   statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the different
   spectral indices of most of the plant species in the forests. However,
   the red-edge parameters showed the highest potential (p < 0.001) to
   discriminate different plant species. With leaf spectral signatures, the
   mean reflectance between all plant species was significantly different
   (p < 0.05) at 562 (75\%) wavelength bands. Among pairwise comparisons,
   invasive Leucaena leucocephala showed the best discriminating ability,
   with Dodonaea viscosa having 505 significant wavebands showing
   variations between them. Jeffries Matusita distance analysis revealed
   that band combinations of the red-edge region (725, 726 nm) showed the
   best spectral separability (85\%) for all species. Our findings suggest
   that it is possible to identify and discriminate invasive species
   through field spectroscopy for their future monitoring and management.
   However, the upscaling of hyperspectral measurements to airborne and
   satellite sensors can provide a reliable estimation of invasion through
   mapping inside the protected areas and can help to conserve biodiversity
   and environmental ecosystems in the future.},

Abstract = {West African livestock keepers need forage sources to feed animals
   without degrading the local fragile ecosystems. Establishing
   high-density forage protein banks for animal feeding was evaluated in
   three contrasting zones of Burkina Faso. The agronomic performance of
   the fodder species Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) and Morus alba
   (mulberry), planted for intensive forage production (25,000 plants/ha)
   was monitored through plant height (HEI), stem diameter (DIA), branch
   number (BrN) and branch length (BrL). Once plots were considered
   established (at 7 months) all trees were coppiced. Biomass yield
   subsequently was monitored over three bi-monthly harvests which began
   approximately 1 year after planting. For both species, a highly
   significant interaction between experimental site and dates was observed
   for all variables except BrN. Average HEI (103 cm) were similar. DIA (7
   +/- 0.4 cm) and BrL (55 +/- 2.2 cm) were higher in mulberry (6 +/- 0.1
   and 29 +/- 1.0 cm, respectively), whereas the BrN remained higher in
   leucaena (7 +/- 0.2 vs. 2 +/- 0.1 cm). No differences were observed in
   HEI between sites from June to August. However, from September to
   October, both species displayed a stronger growth rate at site 1. The
   biomass yields (t DM/ha/year) in three consecutive harvests were lower
   than values reported in other tropical regions (1.8 +/- 1.2 and 8.1 +/-
   3.9, for mulberry and leucaena, respectively). Differences between sites
   were due mainly to soil properties, rainfall pattern and termite
   attacks. This study demonstrated that L. leucocephala and M. alba,
   planted in high-density forage banks, successfully establish and have
   high forage yield across several edaphoclimatic conditions in Burkina
   Faso. Our findings suggest that this technology could significantly
   contribute to livestock feeding systems in the region, thus reducing
   negative effects of over-grazing on landscape degradation.},

   exotic fast-growing tree species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn.) did

   tree species in the central dry zone of Myanmar. MAI values appeared to
   be lower on land with a high gravel content in the soil or with a higher
   degree of erosion. In the eastern part of Sumba Island in Indonesia, MAI
   of planted Tectona grandis L. forest equaled 3.76 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) at a

   Batley, J. W. Redmond, and B. G. Rolfe, J. Plant Physiol. 120:331-349,

   nonlegume Parasponia. The parent strain, ANU280, effectively nodules all
   these legume species except Parasponia, on which it formed ineffective
   nodules. Ultrastructural examination of infection sites on the legume
   siratro showed that mutant strain ANU2861 caused root hair curling (Hac+
   phenotype), some cortical cell division (Noi+), but no infection threads
   (Inf-). Localized cellular responses, known to occur in
   phytopathological interactions, were observed in electron microgrpahs of
   the  epidermal tissue at or near the infection zone after inoculation
   with strain ANU2861 but not the wild-type parental strain. These include
   (i) the rapid (within 20 h) accumulation of osmiophilic droplets
   attached to membranes at potential sites of strain ANU2861 penetration
   and (after 48 h) in the epidermal cells in the immediate region of the
   curled root hairs, and (ii) localized cell death of the epidermal cells.
   In addition, strain ANU2861 can initiate a systemic response in
   split-root siratro plants which prevents the successful nodulation of
   strain ANU280. A 6.3-kilobase fragment of wild-type genomic DNA, which
   includes the site of Tn5 insertion in strain ANU2861, was cloned and
   introduced to strain ANU2861. All the phenotypic defects of the mutant

Abstract = {The evolution of the biodiversity in plants and soil was studied in the
   Institute of Animal Science during 2003, 2004, and 2005 in different
   tropical grasslands under exploitation with cattle presence: a)
   silvopastoral system based on Leucaena leucocephala-Panicum maximum, b)
   monoculture of Panicum maximum, and c) mixture of creeping legumes
   (Pueraria phaseoloides, Macroptilium atropurpureum, and Neonotonia
   wightii). The total number of individuals, the uniformity of the sample,
   and the biodiversity were determined. The samplings were performed twice
   per season by counting individuals from each plant species and edaphic
   fauna. The silvopastoral grassland showed increasing evolution of the
   edaphic biodiversity, with values of biodiversity between 1.69 and 2.17
   in the rainy season, and without differences in the dry season.
   Meanwhile, the plants reduced the biodiversity from 1.16 to 0.60 in the
   dry season, and from 1.46 to 0.88 in the rainy season, due to the
   disappearance of weeds and the strengthening and increment of Guinea
   grass as basic pasture. The grassland with monoculture had decline in,
   the edaphic biodiversity in the dry and rainy season, respectively (from
   1.83 to 0.78 and from 1.78 to 1.13). The vegetation was diversified by
   little desired plants and reached 1.76. The grassland with mixture of
   creeping legumes had similar performance to the silvopastoral. The plant
   biodiversity in this grassland diminished up to 1.01, and the fauna of
   the soil increased biodiversity up to 2.97. It is concluded that in
   silvopastoral grasslands and those with mixtures of legumes, he
   management and type of grassland favored the biodiversity. Nevertheless,
   in the system with monoculture, this indicator evolved due to the
   inadequate management. Further studies are recommended in other types of
   grasslands to go deeper into the performance of this indicator in our
   conditions in cattle areas.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted from 1994 to 1996 on a degraded Ultisol
   at the University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria, to monitor changes
   in nutrient status as influenced by the incorporation of prunings of
   planted Leucaena leucocephala and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) for a
   period of 60 weeks. Although increases in soil pH were small decreases
   in exchangeable acidity were observed to be highly significant in the
   first few weeks after incorporation of the prunings. The soil pH
   decreased by 47\% and 49\% in the leucaena and pigeon pea treated plots,
   respectively, and became stabilized thereafter while the exchangeable
   acidity increased steadily in the control plots. The total nitrogen
   levels in leucaena pruning incorporated plots increased by 120 and 213\%
   compared to 90 and 175\% respectively in pigeon pea within the first 6
   and 12 weeks, respectively. However, the soil nitrate levels were
   consistently higher in pigeon pea than in leucaena pruning incorporated
   plots. Increases in total phosphorus (P) levels were marginal in the
   first few weeks after incorporation. However by the 18th week,
   significantly higher values were observed in the pigeon pen pruning
   incorporated plots (18\%) than in leucaena pruning incorporated plots.
   The organic P followed a similar trend. The calcium-P (Ca-P) and the
   aluminum-P (AI-P) did not change significantly as a result of pruning
   incorporation. The exchangeable calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and
   potassium (K) levels increased significantly with time in the pruning
   incorporated plots. The increases were more rapid in the leucaena
   pruning incorporated plots. It was concluded that pigeon pea compared
   favorably with leucaena in terms of long-term nutrient releasing ability
   of their incorporated prunings and consequently may be better
   alternative to leucaena and other woody species because of its immediate
   cash and food values and ease of establishment and control.},

Abstract = {A ten-year-study (1983 to 1992) conducted on nine 15 x 90 m runoff plots
   at 4\% slope compared production efficiency of Leucaena leucocephala and
   Eucalyptus hybrid based agroforestry as well as monocropping landuse
   systems in the warm, subhumid climate of the western Himalayan region of
   India. Treatments for the first sequence were: monocropping systems of
   leucaena, eucalyptus, Chrysopogon fulvus grass and maize - wheat
   rotation, and alley cropping systems of grass and crops at 4.5 and 10.5
   m alley widths with paired contour tree rows of leucaena and eucalyptus.
   In the second sequence, alley width increased to 22.5 m in 1989, grass
   was replaced by turmeric Curcuma longa and paired contour rows of
   leucaena hedges were introduced in monocropping systems of grain crops
   and turmeric. Integration of leucaena and eucalyptus trees with crops
   caused severe reduction of crop yields ranging from 21 to 92\% for wheat
   grain, 59 to 69\% for maize grain, 60 to 67\% for dry grass and about
   50\% for turmeric rhizome depending upon the age of trees and alley
   width. The grain yield of crops stabilized at about 50\% reduction with
   22.5 m alley width. Total crop biomass (grain + straw) also revealed a
   similar trend; however, its magnitude of reduction was less severe than
   for grain. Production of biomass was much lower near the tree rows than
   in mid alleys. Managing leucaena as contour hedgerows eliminated crop
   yield reduction in alleys. Performance of grass and turmeric in alleys
   was not found to be satisfactory. Biomass produced from trees adequately
   compensated the crop yield reduction. Land equivalent ratios of
   agroforestry landuses were comparable or even better than monocropping
   systems indicating suitability of these systems for the western
   Himalayan valley region.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to determine the chemical composition
   and ruminal degradation of the crude protein (CP), total and individual
   amino acids of leaves from tropical forages: perennial soybean
   (Neonotonia wightii), cassava (Manihot esculenta), leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala) and ramie (Boehmeria nivea), and to estimate the
   intestinal digestibility of the rumen undegradable protein (RUDP) and
   individual amino acids of leaves from the tropical forages above cited,
   but including pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan). Three nonlactating Holstein
   cows were used to determine the in situ ruminal degradability of protein
   and amino acids from leaves (6, 18 and 48 hours of ruminal incubation).
   For determination of the intestinal digestibility of RUDP, the residue
   from ruminal incubation of the materials was used for 18 hours. A larger
   concentration of total amino acids for ramie and smaller for perennial
   soybean were observed; however, they were very similar in leucaena and
   cassava. Leucine was the essential amino acid of greater concentration,
   with the exception of cassava, which exhibited a leucine concentration
   40.45\% smaller. Ramie showed 14.35 and 22.31\% more lysine and
   methionine, respectively. The intestinal digestibility of RUDP varied
   from 23.56; 47.87; 23.48; 25.69 and 10.86\% for leucaena, perennial
   soybean, cassava, ramie and pigeon pea, respectively. The individual
   amino acids of tropical forage disappeared in different extensions in
   the rumen. For the correct evaluation of those forages, one should
   consider their composition of amino acids, degradations and intestinal
   digestibility, once the amino acid composition of the forage does not
   reflect the amino acid profiles that arrived in the small intestine.
   Differences between the degradation curves of CP and amino acids
   indicate that degradation of amino acids cannot be estimated through the
   degradation curve of CP, and that amino acids are not degraded in a
   similar degradation profile.},

   leucocephala (LEU) as ruminal N sources was examined. The N content
   (g/kg dry matter) was 38.0, 28.6, 35.1 and 46.7, and acid detergent
   insoluble N (ADIN; g/kg dry matter) was 9.0, 10.7, 18.7 and 19.8 for
   ACA, ALB, ENT and LEU, respectively. In vitro gas production at 24 h
   ranked ACA > ENT > LEU > ALB (P < 0.001), except that there were no
   differences between ENT and LEU after 12 h of incubation. The N
   degradability was estimated by the in vitro relationship between gas
   production and ammonia N concentration (NDg), N disappearance from
   incubation residue (NDd), and incubation with Streptomyces griseus
   enzymes (NDe). To determine NDg, legume samples (601 +/- 0.54 mg) were
   incubated with 0 mg (n = 3), 150 mg (n = 2) or 300 mg (it = 2) starch
   for 24 h in two experiments. Regression of ammonia (y, mg) on gas
   produced (x, ml) for each browse in each experiment (it = 7) yielded
   r(2) coefficients between 0.974 and 0.997. Average estimated NDg were
   0.32, 0.22, 0.63 and 0.22 for ACA, ALB, ENT and LEU, whereas NDd had N
   digestion coefficients of 0.40, 0.17, 0.70 and 0.36, and NDe 0.41, 0.24,
   0.44 and 0.36, respectively. NDg was lower than NDd and NDe for LEU, but
   higher than NDe for ENT (P < 0.05). However, methods correlation ranged
   from 0.73 to 0.92. In vitro estimated N digestion suggested that 0.52,
   0.17, 0.30 and 0.41 of undegraded N from ACA, ALB, ENT and LEU was
   intestinally digestible. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Scarce and poor-quality food resources limit smallholder dairy
   production in the tropics. Food resources for zero-grazing may be
   improved by intercropping Pennisetum purpureum (napier grass) with
   Leucaena leucocephala leguminous hedgerows. To evaluate dairy cow
   performance from this alley cropping system, 36 Ayrshire/Brown Swiss X
   Sahiwal cows in a 2 X 3 factorial design were individually fed from the
   3rd week of lactation for 14 weeks on diets of napier fodder harvested
   at 1.0 m or 1.5 m and offered ad libitum, supplemented with 0, 4 or 8 kg
   fresh weight leucaena fodder. Average daily milk yield during the 2nd
   week of lactation was a covariate in the analyses of milk yield, and
   post-partum live weight a covariate in the analyses of dry matter (DM)
   intake and live-weight change.
   Napier harvesting height and leucaena level had independent effects on
   performance. Napier height (1.0 m or 1.5 m) significantly (P < 0.01)
   affected daily napier DM intake (9.3 and 6.8 kg), total daily DM intake
   (10.5 and 7.9 kg), daily live-weight losses (165 and 490 g) and daily
   milk yield (8.6 and 6.9 kg respectively). Leucaena supplementation (0, 4
   or 8 kg) significantly (P < 0.01) increased total daily DM intake (7.8,
   9.3 and 10.4 kg), reduced daily live-weight loss (560, 235 and 175 g),
   and increased daily milk yield (7.3, 7.7 and 8.3 kg respectively). The
   results show that reasonable dairy performance can be achieved in the
   tropics by supplementing a napier fodder basal diet with leucaena
   forage, and highlight the importance of the stage of harvesting of the
   napier fodder. The results are discussed in relation to the nutrient
   requirements for milk production given by the Agricultural Research
   Council (1980 and 1984).},

Abstract = {In order to support livelihoods, enhance food security, restore
   ecosystem services, and reduce pressure on forests, degraded land can be
   restored by utilising alternative land-use systems (ALUS), such as
   silviculture, silvipasture, and hortipasture techniques. ALUS
   significantly modify the dynamics of soil nutrients in both the surface
   and subsurface layers. Soils from the 0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm layers
   of Leucaena leucocephala (S)-, Hardwickia binata (H)-, Emblica
   officinalis (A)-, and Azadiracta indica (N)-based silviculture systems,
   Acacia nilotica-based silvipasture systems (SPS), natural grassland
   (NT), and fallow land (F) were sampled in order to better understand the
   nutrient dynamics of ALUS. Soils under S, H, and SPS had similar to
   203\%, 195\%, and 129\% higher organic carbon (SOC), respectively, than
   fallow land in the 0-15 cm soil layer. In the subsequent soil layer,
   those land-use systems had similar to 199\%, 82\%, and 110\% higher SOC,
   respectively, than fallow land. Similarly, in the deeper layer, those
   land uses had similar to 232\%, 23\%, and 105\% higher SOC,
   respectively, than fallow land. SPS and NT also improved the SOC
   concentration significantly over fallow land. Plots under S, H, and SPS
   had similar to 198\%, 190\%, and 125\% higher available N, respectively,
   than fallow land in 0-15 cm soil layer. In the 15-30 cm soil layer,
   those land-use systems had similar to 19\%9, 82\%, and 110\% higher
   available N, respectively, than fallow land. These systems also improved
   the P and K contents in subsurface soil. Micronutrient concentrations
   were also improved in soils under S, H, and SPS. Hence, ALUS' adoption
   in degraded areas with trees provides a chance for C storage and
   improves the nutrient dynamics on degraded land.},

Abstract = {Competition for nutrients and water between crops and associated
   hedgerows reduces overall performance of contour hedgerow systems and
   hampers its acceptance by rural communities in tropical mountainous
   regions. Therefore, it is imperative to better understand competition
   leading to a decline in crop response close to hedges. In the highlands
   of North East Thailand spatial variability in grain yield of maize (Zea
   mays L., cv. Suwan 1) was assessed for two contour hedgerow systems
   based on Brachiaria ruziziensis Germain et Evrard (Ruzi grass) barriers
   or Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit hedges without or with fertilizer
   (60 kg N ha(-1) and 14 kg P ha(-1)). Available NO- (3) - N was analyzed
   across the slope. In addition, shoot N concentration and delta C-13
   values in leaves were measured for maize plants in the center of the
   alley and in the row next to and at the upper side of barriers or
   hedges. Despite variable field conditions, delta C-13 values were
   significantly (p < 0.05) less depleted close to the barriers or hedges,
   except for 2 out of 16 plots, suggesting that water deficiency was not
   the main driver for spatial variability along the alleys. The negative
   correrlatiom betweem C-13 isotopic discrimination and available NO- (3)
   - N in the soil, with R-2 ranging from 0.5 (p < 0.10) to 0.9 (p < 0.01),
   assigned a major role to N availability in the reduced crop response
   towards the barriers. The proposed framework of C-13 isotopic
   discrimination, together with plant and soil N data, is a new approach
   and was shown to be suitable to determine N and water competition
   between hedgerows and crops grown in alleys under field conditions.},

Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {195-205},
Abstract = {Although only Leucaena leucocephala is widely used, most members of the
   Leucaena genus have potential as multipurpose species for tropical
   agroforestry systems. To investigate the wood and biomass production
   potential of the Leucaena genus, 116 accessions covering the 22 species
   were evaluated over a two-year period at Brisbane, southeast Queensland,
   Australia. Trees were planted into replicated line plots 5 m long, with
   rows spaced 3 m apart. Trees were initially planted at 0.5 m spacings
   within the plots, but were thinned to 1 m spacings prior to the
   evaluation period. The hybrid accessions, KX2 (L. pallida x L.
   leucocephala) and KX3 (L. diversifolia x L. leucocephala), were the most
   productive, yielding over 50 kg dry matter (DM)/tree. L. trichandra
   OFI53/88 and L. diversifolia CPI33820 were the most productive
   non-hybrid accessions producing total yields of 41 and 37 kg DM/tree,
   respectively. Cultivar Tarramba (26 kg DM/tree) was the most productive
   of the 26 L. leucocephala accessions assessed in the trial but all these
   accessions suffered from psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana) attack at this
   site. A series of non-destructive growth measurements was recorded every
   three months over the two-year evaluation period. Root collar diameter
   (RCD), stem number and plant height were found to be the most useful of
   the measurements for non-destructive assessment of accession agronomic
   characteristics. A relationship between yield and a growth index
   (calculated as RCD(2) x Height/1000), was derived from data from all
   accessions and could be used as a reliable predictor of yield (r(2) =
   0.94). The widespread use of the F1 hybrid leucaenas is currently
   limited by a lack of seed. Technologies to economically produce F1
   hybrid seed on a commercial scale are required before the potential of
   these accessions in agroforestry systems can be fully realized.},

Title = {STEPWISE APPROACH TO ALLEY CROPPING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER
   IN THE FOREST ZONE OF CAMEROON},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {269-278},
Abstract = {Two projects on alley cropping research and development have been
   implemented in the Forest zone of Cameroon (FZC) since 1988. Their goal
   was to identify the main agricultural constraints in the FZC and to
   introduce alley cropping in the farming systems to improve soil
   fertility and crop yields.
   The first step in the implementation process was the participatory
   surveys which revealed that (a) the main agricultural constraint in the
   FZC is low soil fertility; (b) alley cropping is an agroforestry
   technology which may solve the problem; (c) alley cropping should be
   first targetted to farmers who own inherited or purchased lands.
   The second step was the on-station tree screening activity from which
   Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra calothyrsus and
   Paraserianthes falcataria were identified as promising tree species.
   The third activity was to test alley cropping with three promising tree
   species (Leucaena, Gliricidia and Calliandra) on farmers' fields.
   Results from the first year testing on farmers' fields showed that: (1)
   the direct seeding method used was ineffective: seedling emergence rate
   was 45\% for Leucaena and 52\% for Gliricidia; (2) Cassava suppressed
   the growth of Leucaena and Gliricidia by 57 and 45\%, respectively; (3)
   three-month-old Calliandra seedlings planted 1 m away from cassava
   plants had 96\% survival rate. Based on these third step findings, all
   new farms were established with Calliandra seedlings using maize as a
   test-crop in the year of establishment and the subsequent year. After
   two years of cropping, maize grain yield in alley plots was 52\% higher
   than maize grown on no-tree plots.
   In 1993, 52 farmers who had witnessed the alley farm maize growth in
   1992 requested to join the project. This sudden interest of farmers to
   start their own alley farms was considered as a positive sign for
   adoption and therefore a success in alley cropping (AC) introduction in
   the zone.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS},
Year = {1986},

Abstract = {The rapidly growing, woody perennial legume, Leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit), is adaptable to a wide range of neotropical
   soil conditions. Effective Rhizobium inoculation and endophyte
   mycorrhizal colonization are essential for high levels of production and
   symbiotic N2 fixation. The objective of this study was to determine
   growth, nodulation, nitrogenase activity and nodule composition of
   inoculated Leucaena as affected by mycorrhizal colonization and
   factorial soil  fertility treatments of a Typic Eutrustox. Highly
   significant increases in top growth, nodule fresh wt. and nitrogenase
   activity resulted with Glomus fasciculatum colonization, soil K and
   linear increases with low-soluble P fertilization to 300 mg P kg-1 soil.
   Highly significant interactions for increased nodulation and nitrogenase
   activity resulted with K x mycorrhiza. Interactions of all three factors
   P, K and mycorrhiza were highly significant for nodule fresh wt.
   However, responses comparing inoculation with G. fasciculatum and with
   combined G. fasciculatum, G. microcarpus and G. clavium were not
   significant. Highly significant increases with applied K levels to 300
   mg K kg-1 soil resulted with top and root growth, nodulation and
   nitrogenase when applied with soluble P at 100 mg kg-1 soil and 500 mg
   Ca kg-1 soil. Significant and highly significant interactions of P, Ca
   and K level resulted for all parameters. Plant nutrient element
   composition of nodules increased with the fertilization treatments for
   P, Ca and increased K levels. A highly significant inverse relation was
   apparent with decreased Na resulting with increased K levels. Half or
   more of total nodule K, P and Mg but less than 20\% of Ca and Na were
   within the nodule cytosol. Sodium, Mg, P, and Ca decreased in the
   cytosol fraction with increased K content.},

   molecular signaling and host-legume nodulation},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Background: Nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation are mediated by
   several genes, both of the host legume and of the bacterium. The
   rhizobial regulatory nodD gene plays a critical role, orchestrating the
   transcription of the other nodulation genes. Rhizobium tropici strain
   CIAT 899 is an effective symbiont of several legumes-with an emphasis on
   common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)-and is unusual in carrying multiple
   copies of nodD, the roles of which remain to be elucidated.
   Results: Phenotypes, Nod factors and gene expression of nodD1 and nodD2
   mutants of CIAT 899 were compared with those of the wild type strain,
   both in the presence and in the absence of the nod-gene-inducing
   molecules apigenin and salt (NaCl). Differences between the wild type
   and mutants were observed in swimming motility and IAA (indole acetic
   acid) synthesis. In the presence of both apigenin and salt, large
   numbers of Nod factors were detected in CIAT 899, with fewer detected in
   the mutants. nodC expression was lower in both mutants; differences in
   nodD1 and nodD2 expression were observed between the wild type and the
   mutants, with variation according to the inducing molecule, and with a
   major role of apigenin with nodD1 and of salt with nodD2. In the nodD1
   mutant, nodulation was markedly reduced in common bean and abolished in
   leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and siratro (Macroptilium
   atropurpureum), whereas a mutation in nodD2 reduced nodulation in common
   bean, but not in the other two legumes.
   Conclusion: Our proposed model considers that full nodulation of common
   bean by R. tropici requires both nodD1 and nodD2, whereas, in other
   legume species that might represent the original host, nodD1 plays the
   major role. In general, nodD2 is an activator of nod-gene transcription,
   but, in specific conditions, it can slightly repress nodD1. nodD1 and
   nodD2 play other roles beyond nodulation, such as swimming motility and
   IAA synthesis.},

   (leucaena); together with 3 accessions of Calliandra calothyrsus
   (calliandra), were evaluated on an acidic, nitosol soil in the tropical
   highland region of Soddo in southern Ethiopia for dry matter production,
   feed quality, soil fertility and responses to phosphorus fertilisation.
   At the first harvest (11 months after transplanting), over all
   accessions and for individual accessions, plant height, spread, basal
   stem diameter and dry matter yield showed significant responses to the
   application of phosphorus (P). There was also a significant interaction
   between accessions and P treatments for most of these growth parameters.
   Two regrowth harvests showed a significant response in dry matter
   production of both leaf + soft stem and hard-stem fractions to the
   application of phosphorus (P).
   L. leucocephala accessions had higher in vitro dry matter digestibility
   (IVDMD) values than the other Leucaena spp. Two of the 3 C. calothyrsus
   accessions had significantly higher values for ash, NDF and ADF, lower
   IVDMD and slightly lower protein than all leucaena accessions.
   The clearly superior growth performance of the calliandras and the
   leucaenas, other than L. leucocephala, over that of cv. Peru (control),
   emphasises the need to evaluate their feed value in vivo and at the farm
   level. While already being used quite widely as a multi-purpose tree,
   calliandra has not been collected and researched much around the world

Abstract = {Background DNA barcoding have been considered as a tool to facilitate
   species identification based on its simplicity and high-level accuracy
   in compression to the complexity and subjective biases linked to
   morphological identification of taxa. MaturaseK gene (MatK gene) of the
   chloroplast is very vital in the plant system which is involved in the

   determine the relative utility of the ``MatK{''} chloroplast gene for
   barcoding in 15 legume as a tool to facilitate species identification
   based on their simplicity and high-level accuracy linked to
   morphological identification of taxa. Methods and Results MatK gene
   sequences were submitted to GenBank and the accession numbers were

   These DNA sequences were aligned with database sequence using PROMALS

   Cassia fistula, Cassia javanica) and Schotia brachypetala were more
   closely to each other, respectively. The remaining four species of
   Erythrina humeana, (Sophora secundiflora, Dalbergia Sissoo, Tipuana
   Tipu) constituted the second clade. Conclusion Moreover, their sequences
   could be successfully utilized in single nucleotide polymorphism or as
   part of the sequence as DNA fragment analysis utilizing polymerase chain
   reaction in plant systematic. Therefore, MatK gene is considered
   promising a candidate for DNA barcoding in the plant family Fabaceae and
   provides a clear relationship between the families.},

Abstract = {The input of organic matter to the soil by legumes in alley cropping
   systems may be an alternative for a sustainable soil use in the humid
   tropics. The objective of this study was to compare the input of
   oxidizable organic matter in a combination of residues from different
   legumes in alley cropping systems on an Ultisol. Two legume species were
   evaluated: leucena (Leucaena leucocephala) and pigeon pea (Cajanus
   cajan), which have high-quality residues, and Philippine pigeonwings
   (Clitoria fairchildiana) and acacia (Acacia mangium), with low-quality
   residues. The residues were combined in the following treatments:
   Philippine pigeonwings + pigeon pea, leucena + pigeon pea, acacia +
   pigeon pea; Philippine pigeonwings + leucena; leucena + acacia, an area
   without legumes was used as control. Soil samples were taken from the
   layers 0-5 and 5-10 cm in the crop inter-row. Total organic carbon (TOC)
   was quantified and divided into four fractions (F1, F2, F3 and F4) with
   decreasing oxidation degrees. In the areas with Philippine
   pigeonwings/leucena, acacia/leucena and acacia/pigeon pea the TOC
   content was higher at the depth of 0-5 cm. In the area without legumes
   the TOC content was the lowest at the depth of 5-10 cm. The highest TOC
   proportion was observed in the F1+F2 fractions, and the carbon contents
   for these fractions were lower in the area without legumes. In the
   acacia/pigeon pea treatment the C content was higher in the F1 fraction
   at both depths, while the TOC proportions were greater in the treatment
   leucaena/pigeon pea in the fractions F3 + F4. The results indicate that
   the combination of high and low quality residues (acacia/pigeon pea)
   favors the increase of easily decomposable organic matter, while the use
   of high-quality residues resulted in higher carbon proportions in the
   more resistant fractions (F3 + F4).},

Abstract = {Leucaena, Leucaena leucocephala, a highly palatable, browse legume, may
   be useful in feeding systems for zoological ruminants in the tropics and
   subtropics, but determining Synergistes jonesii status, the rumen
   bacteria necessary to detoxify leucaena, in zoological ruminants is
   necessary before it can be used. The objective of this study was to
   determine if current methods developed for detecting S. jonesii in
   cattle feces are applicable to drier fecal materials commonly found in
   zoological ruminants by using sheep (Ovis sp.) as a model. Fresh feces
   and rumen fluid from cattle (Bos sp., n = 2) and sheep (n = 4) colonized
   with S. jonesii were collected and directly injected into culture media.
   Additionally, for the sheep only, a fecal slurry (1:4 wt. feces to vol.
   water) was made and injected into culture media. Changes in media color
   and precipitate were recorded at 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-wk incubation times.
   There was a species by incubation time interaction (P < .07) for fecal
   samples because S. jonesii was detected in samples sooner (P < .09) from
   sheep than cattle, but by 16-wk incubation time, detection level in the
   fecal samples did not differ (50 vs. 37\% for sheep and cattle,
   respectively; P = .71). Throughout the incubation period, the level of
   detection of S. jonesii in sheep was higher (P < .05) in rumen fluid
   samples than the average of the fecal samples (100 vs. 49\%,
   respectively, at 16 wk), but there was no difference (P = .53) in
   detection level in either fresh fecal or slurry samples (67 vs. 33\%,
   respectively, at 16 wk). This study indicated that current procedures
   are adequate for detecting S. jonesii with fecal samples, but on a whole
   herd not an individual animal basis.},

Title = {Leucaena hedgerow intercropping and cattle manure application in the
   Ethiopian highlands - II. Maize yields and nutrient uptake},
Journal = {BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {The effects of Leucaena leucocephala and L. pallida prunings and cattle
   manure on maize nutrient uptake and yield were investigated in a
   hedgerow intercropping trial in the Ethiopian highlands. Hedgerow
   intercropping (also called alley cropping) is an agroforestry system in
   which trees are grown in dense hedges between alleys where short-cycle
   crops are grown. The hedges are pruned periodically during the cropping
   period and the prunings are added to the soil as green manure. For each
   leucaena species, the experiment had 16 treatments resulting from a
   factorial combination of four levels of leucaena leaf prunings (no
   prunings applied; first prunings applied; first and second prunings
   applied: first, second and third prunings applied), two levels of
   air-dried cattle manure (0 and 3 t dry matter ha(-1)) and two levels of
   N fertilizer (0 and 40 kg N ha(-1) as urea). Uptake of N, P and K
   increased significantly with application of the three nutrient sources,
   but uptake of Ca and Mg either did not respond or decreased with
   application of prunings and manure. All the three factors increased
   maize grain and stover yields significantly, usually with no significant
   interactions between the factors. At least two applications of prunings
   were required to significantly increase nutrient uptake and maize yield.
   Maize in the: row closest to the hedge did not respond to these nutrient
   inputs. It is concluded that hedgerow intercropping, with or without
   manure application, can increase crop yields moderately (to 2-3 t ha(-1)
   maize grain yields) in the highlands, but P. Ca and Mg may have to be
   supplied from external sources if they are deficient in the soil.
   Additional N is still required for higher yields (>4 t ha(-1) maize
   grain yields). However, quantification of the competition effects of the
   trees is also required to confirm these results.},

Abstract = {Relatively few studies have compared the animal production potential
   from different cultivars of Leucaena leucocephala or from browse species
   other than L. leucocephala. This paper presents early results from
   experiments established for this purpose in Australia, Papua New Guinea
   and the Philippines where psyllid-tolerant accessions of L. pallida, L.
   diversifolia, L. trichandra and L. collinsii were compared with
   psyllid-susceptible L. leucocephala cultivars. At three sites, where
   comparisons were made with a grass only treatment, the planting of
   shrubs resulted in increased steer gains. This occurred despite low
   edible shrub dry matter yields of <600 kg/ha. L. leucocephala cv.
   Tarramba was the control at all sites and steer gains on this cultivar
   ranged from 397-664 g/d. Only at two sites were gains greater on any
   other accession - at Lansdown (Australia) where steers on cv. Cunningham
   gained 10\% higher and at Munum (PNG) where steers on L. collinsii OFT
   51/88 gained 19\% higher. Gains on L. pallida CQ 3439 ranged from
   253-423 g/d at the different sites with low acceptability, especially in
   the dry season. Steer performance and acceptability was intermediate
   between L. leucocephala and L. pallida on L. diversifolia CPI 33820 and
   L. trichandra CPI 46568 and OFI 53/88. Overall, steer gains were not
   significantly (P > 0.05) related to edible shrub yield, indicating the
   importance of shrub quality as opposed to quantity. Psyllid damage only
   occurred at one site (Lansdown) so the value of psyllid-tolerance was
   not fully assessed. However, even at Lansdown, the psyllid-susceptible
   cv. Cunningham gave highest steer gains. The experimental sites were all
   in the `lowland' tropics. Different results may well occur at higher
   altitudes and higher latitudes, where cool tolerant material such as L.
   diversifolia, L. trichandra and L. pallida and their crosses with L.
   leucocephala may perform better.},

Title = {The Perception of Farmers on Soil Erosion and Conservation Measures in
   the Surrounding Areas of Lake Ziway, Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {The level of sediment deposited in the Lake Ziway is increasing through
   time as a result of soil erosion, and eventually the depth of the lake
   has decreased. Therefore, the objective of the study was to assess
   farmers' perception of soil erosion and the conservation measures to the
   surrounding areas of Lake Ziway in the central Rift Valley of Ethiopia.
   The survey was made using purposive sampling techniques. The survey has
   considered the 14 Kebeles from the 3 districts adjacent to the lake.
   From each Kebele, 10 respondents were selected randomly. Totally, 140
   respondents were selected from the community. The descriptive statistic
   was used to compare the dependent variables. The majority of respondents
   (92.2\%) have observed the presence of soil erosion in the study area.
   The hillsides and slope areas are the major sources of soil erosion,
   according to 80\% of the respondents. The respondents that have
   identified the most and least susceptible soils to erosion by their
   textural classes are sand soil (Biyyo Chirecha) (57.1\%) and soft clay
   soil (Biyyo Bole) (1.4\%), respectively. The soil erosion is increasing
   in their cultivated land and surrounding areas. The study has found that
   most of the respondents (86.5\%) are participating in soil and water
   conservation activities. Leucaena leucocephala, Faidherbia albida,
   Azadirachta indica, and Schinus molle are the dominant tree species
   planted in the study area for soil and water conservation purposes. In
   conclusion, there is heavy soil loss due to erosion on cultivated land
   from the upland which directly deposited to Lake Ziway as sediment which
   decreases the lake depth. The study recommends that appropriate soil and
   water conservation measures and land management should be implemented on
   erosion prone areas in the Lake Ziway watershed with full participation
   of all stakeholders including the local farmers.},

Title = {Spatial distribution of plant root forces in root-permeated soils

Volume = {156},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {1-15},

Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the spatial distribution of root forces
   in root-permeated soils that are subject to shear. In-situ large shear
   tests, 1.0 m x 1.0m x 0.5 m, on plant root systems are carried out. The
   root system of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) (white popinac) and Acacia
   confusa (Formosa acacia) are used in this study. The axial forces
   developed in plant roots in soil that is subject to shear rely on the
   root location and orientation with respect to the shear direction. The
   majority of the roots in front of the tree stem, with respect to the
   shear direction, develop compressive forces during the shearing process,
   as the root orientation is low. Roots on the side of the tree stem tend
   to develop tensile forces during the shearing process. Most of the
   measured root forces at the back of the tree stem with respect to the
   shear direction are in tensile modes. Post-peak root forces continue to
   develop with increasing shear displacements. The percentage of the
   maximum mobilized root force in tensile modes during shear in this study
   reaches to approximately 68\% of its ultimate tensile resistance at a
   shear displacement of 10-25 cm, whereas most of the instrumented data
   are less than approximately 45\%. The maximum mobilized stress level for
   roots in front of the tree stem during the shearing process is low with
   respect to the ultimate tensile resistance of the root, and the maximum
   mobilized stress level for roots on the side and at the back of the tree
   stem is moderate. This study provides an in-depth look at the root
   forces developed in a plant root system subjected to shear. (C) 2015

Title = {Characterization of Rhizobium grahamii extrachromosomal replicons
   and their transfer among rhizobia},
Journal = {BMC MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background: Rhizobium grahamii belongs to a new phylogenetic group of
   rhizobia together with Rhizobium mesoamericanum and other species. R.
   grahamii has a broad-host-range that includes Leucaena leucocephala and
   Phaseolus vulgaris, although it is a poor competitor for P. vulgaris
   nodulation in the presence of Rhizobium etli or Rhizobium phaseoli
   strains. This work analyzed the genome sequence and transfer properties
   of R. grahamii plasmids.
   Results: Genome sequence was obtained from R. grahamii CCGE502 type
   strain isolated from Dalea leporina in Mexico. The CCGE502 genome
   comprises one chromosome and two extrachromosomal replicons (ERs),
   pRgrCCGE502a and pRgrCCGE502b. Additionally, a plasmid integrated in the
   CCGE502 chromosome was found. The genomic comparison of ERs from this
   group showed that gene content is more variable than average nucleotide
   identity (ANI). Well conserved nod and nif genes were found in R.
   grahamii and R. mesoamericanum with some differences. R. phaseoli
   Ch24-10 genes expressed in bacterial cells in roots were found to be
   conserved in pRgrCCGE502b. Regarding conjugative transfer we were unable
   to transfer the R. grahamii CCGE502 symbiotic plasmid and its
   megaplasmid to other rhizobial hosts but we could transfer the symbiotic
   plasmid to Agrobacterium tumefaciens with transfer dependent on
   homoserine lactones.
   Conclusion: Variable degrees of nucleotide identity and gene content
   conservation were found among the different R. grahamii CCGE502
   replicons in comparison to R. mesoamericanum genomes. The
   extrachromosomal replicons from R. grahamii were more similar to those
   found in phylogenetically related Rhizobium species. However, limited
   similarities of R. grahamii CCGE502 symbiotic plasmid and megaplasmid
   were observed in other more distant Rhizobium species. The set of
   conserved genes in R. grahamii comprises some of those that are highly
   expressed in R. phaseoli on plant roots, suggesting that they play an
   important role in root colonization.},

Journal = {CUBAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {42},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-74},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The study was conducted during three continuous years in areas of the
   Institute of Animal Science to determine a methodology for selecting the
   variables of the soil-plant system as indicators that allow monitoring
   the sustainability of grasslands in cattle production. The grasslands
   under study were: (i) silvopastoral system based on Panicum maximum and
   Leucaena leucocephala, (ii) monoculture of Panicum maximum, and (iii)
   association of grasses with a mixture of creeping legumes. The study
   began with the analysis of the peculiarities for each grassland, the
   selection of representative paddocks, and the decisions on the variables
   to be evaluated in each instance. Between 36 and 42 variables were
   determined in the plants, and 76, in the soil. The statistical
   evaluation was based on the multivariate analysis of principal
   components selecting as indicators those variables with preponderance
   values with +/- 0.78 and comprised in the principal components whose
   explained variance accumulated, at least, 65\%. Between 7 and 9
   indicators (pasture density, biomass availability, plant cover, and
   botanical composition) were selected in the plants, whereas there were
   between 9 and 11 in the soil (structure, resistance to penetration, n
   value, macrofauna, mesofauna, and underground phytomass). These
   indicators permitted to characterize the performance of the soil-plant
   system in each grassland. Tables with ranges of values indicating
   sustainability in the soil-plant system were obtained. They are
   practical tools to monitor the management effect on each grassland. It
   is concluded that it is possible to determine sustainability indicators,
   following this methodology, in different types of grasslands, which am
   characteristic of each type and permit to control efficiently the
   management effect. Further studies are recommended in other grassland
   types including the animal factor, as well as increasing the work time
   in the grasslands to validate the indicators selected.},

Journal = {NEW FORESTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},
Pages = {363-382},

Abstract = {Allometric equations are routinely used in the estimation of biomass
   stocks for carbon accounting within forest ecosystems. However, generic
   equations may not reflect the growth trajectories of afforestation
   species that are introduced to degraded farmland characterized by water
   and nutrient limitations. Using sequential measurements of the height,
   basal diameter, and above- and belowground biomass of juvenile trees, we
   developed allometric equations for five woody species (Moringa oleifera
   Lam., Leucaena leucocephala Lam., Jatropha curcas L., Anacardium
   occidentale L. and Parkia biglobosa Jacq.) subjected to a gradient of
   water and nutrient availability in an afforestation trial on degraded
   cropland in the semi-arid zone of Benin, West Africa. For three of the
   species studied, the allometric relationships between basal diameter and
   biomass components (i.e. leaves, stems and roots) were described best by
   a simple power-law model (R-2 > 0.93). The incorporation of
   species-specific height-diameter relationships and total height as
   additional predictors in the power-law function also produced reasonable
   estimates of biomass. Fifteen months after planting, roots accounted for
   10-58\% of the total biomass while the root-to-shoot ratio ranged
   between 0.16 and 0.73. The total biomass of the saplings ranged between
   1.4 and 10.3 Mg ha(-1), yielding 0.6-4.3 Mg C ha(-1), far exceeding the
   biomass in the traditional fallow system. The rate of stem carbon
   sequestration measured ca. 0.62 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Overall, the
   allometric equations developed in this study are generally useful for
   assessing the standing shoot and root biomass of the five afforestation
   species during the juvenile growth stage and can help in reporting and
   verifying carbon stocks in young forests.},

   (147), Senna (131), Leucaena (92), Acacia (80), and maize-cassava (14).
   Earthworm fresh weights in fallow plots were higher than in the
   maize-cassava plot, though this was significant for only 4 out of 11
   sampling dates. Higher earthworm numbers and biomass in fallow plots
   were attributed to higher litterfall, lower soil temperature, and higher
   soil moisture. The mean earthworm numbers were directly correlated with
   the mean soil moistures (r(2) = 0.80, P < 0.05) in fallow plots and
   N/polyphenol ratios of fallow litterfall (r(2) = 0,95, P < 0,05).
   Increase in earthworm population by fallows led to an increase in
   leaf-litter decomposition, soil organic matter, available P, and
   extractable cations and pH; and a decrease in soil bulk density and
   penetrometer resistance in the fallow plots.},

Title = {A ripening associated peroxidase from papaya having a role in defense

   experimental validation},

Abstract = {Fruit ripening associated full length cDNA of a peroxidase from papaya
   was cloned and heterologously expressed. The expressed peroxidase was
   activated by in-vitro re-folding in the presence of hemin and calcium.
   The purified recombinant peroxidase exhibited broad substrate affinity
   in the order of o-dianisidine > pyrogallol > guaiacol and was found to
   be a homotetramer of 155 kDa with each subunit having a size of 38 kDa.
   The basis of the distinctive preferences for various substrates was
   investigated through in-silico molecular modeling approaches. Thus, when
   the modeled papaya peroxidase-heme complex was docked with these
   substrates, the in-silico binding efficiency was found to be in
   agreement with those of wet lab results with the involvement of Arg37,
   Phe40, His41, Pro137, Asn138, His139, His167, and Phe239 as the common
   interacting residues in all the cases. However, the binding of the
   different substrates were found to be associated with conformational
   changes in the peroxidase. Thus, in the case of o-dianisidine (the most
   efficient substrate), the protein was folded in the most compact fashion
   when compared to guaiacol (the least efficient substrate). Protein
   function annotation analyses revealed that the papaya peroxidase may
   have biological roles in oxidation-reduction processes, stresses,
   defense responses etc. In order to further validate its role in
   lignifications, the papaya peroxidase was compared with a lignin
   biosynthetic peroxidase from Leucaena leucocephala, a tree legume. Thus,
   based on 3D structure superimposition and docking, both peroxidases
   exhibited a great extent of similarity suggesting the papaya peroxidase
   having a role in lignification (defense response) too. The predicted
   functions of papaya peroxidase in defense response and lignification
   were further validated experimentally using gRT-PCR analyses and
   measurement of oxidation of coniferyl alcohol. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The nutritive value of 20 forage plants commonly used for feeding pigs
   in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was studied to determine
   chemical composition, protein amino acid profiles, mineral content, and
   in vitro digestibility using a two-step method combining an enzymatic
   pepsin and pancreatin hydrolysis followed by a 72 h gas-test
   fermentation. The highest protein contents (270-320 g/kg DM) were
   obtained for Vigna unguiculata, Psophocarpus scandens, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Manihot esculenta, and Moringa oleifera. Grasses, Acacia
   mangium, and Eichhornia crassipes, showed the lowest crude protein (CP)
   and highest NDF contents. Cajanus cajan and Ttypsacum andersonii had the
   most balanced amino acid profile, being deficient in lysine and slightly
   deficient in histidine, while Megathyrsus maximus displayed the highest
   number of essential amino acids deficiencies. High mineral contents were
   obtained from, in ascending order, with M. oleifera, V. unguiculata, E.
   crassipes, Ipomea batatas and Amaranthus hybridus. In vitro dry matter
   digestibility ranged from 0.25 to 0.52, in vitro CP digestibility from
   0.23 to 0.80, in vitro energy digestibility from 0.23 to 0.52. M.
   esculenta, M. oleifera, I. batatas, Mucuna pruriens, V. unguiculata, P.
   scandens and A. hybridus showed high digestibilities for all nutrients.
   Gas production during fermentation of the pepsin and
   pancreatin-indigestible fraction of the plants varied from 42 mug DM for
   A. mangium to 202 mug DM for I. batatas (P<0.001). Short-chain fatty
   acid production during fermentation varied from 157 to 405 mg/g of the
   pepsin and pancreatin indigestible fraction. It is concluded that some
   of these species are interesting sources of proteins and minerals with a
   good digestibility that might be used more economically than
   concentrate, especially in smallholder production systems, to improve
   pig feeding, mineral intake and intestinal health in pigs reared in the
   tropics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Province of East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) had been one of the major beef
   cattle suppliers under traditional management system in Indonesia. The
   beef cattle fanning that based on grazing native pasture and the
   introduction of shrub legumes (Leucaena leucocephala) may contribute to
   around 15 - 50\% of the farmers' household income. In the last few
   years, supply of beef cattle tended to decline due to the decrease in
   cattle population in NTT. Some basic improvements in management and
   feeding toward increasing beef cattle productivities had been carried
   out in Nusa Tenggara, such as a baseline survey on Cattle Health and
   Productivity Survey (CHAPS) conducted in 1990 - 1992. The objective of
   the program was to identify the existing beef cattle productivity and
   health condition throughout Nusa Tenggara A collaborative research with
   the Ministry of Research and Technology (Integrated Prime Research) had
   also been carried out and the result showed that early weaning in Bali
   calves that can be practised as early as 3 - 6 months to prevent calves
   losses during the dry season. A program of the Assessment on Beef Cattle
   Base Farming Activities had also been conducted to improve fattening and
   breeding practices through the improvement in beef cattle management and
   feeding systems. At the latest development, fattening scheme has been
   introduced under a partnership approach involving private sectors and
   cooperatives. This needs to be facilitated by the government to
   accelerate the program such as access to capital and intensive extension
   services to build farmers awareness toward profit oriented beef cattle
   farming. Optimalization of the available potential resources and
   technology in NTT, will be an opportunity to enhance beef cattle
   production and gains back the reputation as one of the major producing
   beef cattle in the past. This will also support the national livestock
   program nowadays, called Beef Cattle Self Sufficiency Program 2014.},

Title = {Biochar enhancement of facilitation effects in agroforestry: early
   growth and physiological responses in a maize-leucaena model system},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {93},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Biochar, or pyrolyzed organic matter intended for use as a soil
   amendment, has a variety of properties of interest from the perspective
   of agroforestry, in particular its potential to increase soil C
   sequestration and enhance yields by increased retention of soil mineral
   nutrients. Nitrogen-fixing legumes commonly show large growth responses
   to biochar, and we hypothesized that combinations of legumes and
   non-legumes would show increased enhancement of yields in mixture due to
   enhanced facilitation related to increased nutrient retention. This
   hypothesis was tested in a glasshouse pot trial involving the leguminous
   tree leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), and maize (Zea mays) grown for
   120 days in mixture and monoculture in both an unamended soil and soil
   amended with a slow-pyrolysis coconut husk biochar at 10 t/ha. Responses
   were quantified in terms of biomass production and partitioning,
   leaf-level gas-exchange, leaf chlorophyll content, and (for leucaena)
   root nodule formation. Consistent with predictions, leucaena showed more
   pronounced growth and physiological responses to biochar than did maize.
   The system also showed increased total biomass yields relative to
   monocultures in the two-species mixtures with biochar (relative yield in
   mixture {[}RYM] = 1.69; 95\% CI 1.41-1.81), but not in the control
   treatment (RYM = 1.25; 95\% CI 0.93-1.76), and positive effects of
   biochar on yield were generally greater for both species when grown in
   mixture. Growth responses to biochar were most pronounced for stem and
   root biomass, and growth responses were consistent with changes in
   leaf-level photosynthesis and chlorophyll content. In addition, biochar
   had large effects on biomass partitioning, enhancing stem allocation in
   both species. Our results suggest that biochar additions may augment
   facilitative interactions in agroforestry and intercropped systems on
   acidic, nutrient-deficient soils by enhancing system nutrient retention.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Biological invasions pose a significant threat to biodiversity,
   especially on oceanic islands. One of the primary explanations for the
   success of plant invaders is direct suppression of competitors. However,
   indirect interactions can also be important, although they are often
   overlooked in studies on biological invasion. The shrub Leucaena
   leucocephala is a widespread island invader with putative allelopathic
   effects on the germination and growth of other species. We quantified
   the impact of Leucaena on plant communities richness on an oceanic
   Brazilian island and, through nursery experiments, investigated the
   potential for allelopathic effects on the germination of Erythrina
   velutina, a native species that is often absent from stands of Leucaena.
   Additionally, in a manipulative field experiment, we examined the direct
   and indirect effects (mediated by the native species Capparis flexuosa)
   of the invader on the development of Erythrina. The species richness in
   invaded sites was lower than in uninvaded sites, and Capparis was the
   only native species that was frequently present in invaded sites. In the
   nursery experiments, we found no evidence that Leucaena affects the
   germination of Erythrina. In the field experiments, the odds of
   Erythrina germination were lower in the presence of Leucaena litter, but
   higher in the presence of Leucaena trees. However, the survival and
   growth of Erythrina were considerably inhibited by the presence of
   Leucaena trees. The isolated effect of native Capparis on the
   germination and growth of Erythrina varied from positive to neutral.
   However, when Capparis and Leucaena were both present, their combined
   negative effects on Erythrina were worse than the effect of Leucaena
   alone, which may be attributed to indirect effects. This study provides
   the first empirical evidence that the balance of the interactions
   between native species can shift from neutral/positive to negative in
   the presence of an exotic species.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {381},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a key nutrient in silvicultural ecosystems, where its
   cycling influences both primary productivity and ecosystem development.
   Different trees affect P availability in distinct ways. Analyzing impact
   of various trees on soil P fractions and the its adsorption-desorption
   behavior helps better understand soil P availability in these
   ecosystems. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of
   silviculture systems (SCSs) on depth distribution of P fractions, the P
   adsorption-desorption pattern, and P availability in eco-restored land.
   Three distinct silviculture systems, namely Leucaena leucocephala (LL),
   Hardwickia binata (HB), and Azadirachta indica (AI) SCSs were compared
   with degraded fallow (F) to assess their influence on soil properties
   and P dynamics in a Typic Haplustepts of semi-arid ecosystem. Soil
   samples were collected from three different depths 0-15 cm, 15-30 cm,
   and 30-45 cm of these SCSs. The LL, HB and AI showed 2.50, 2.01 and 1.39
   times increase in available P over fallow, respectively. Microbial
   biomass phosphorus (MBP) content increased in LL by 99, 97, and 53 \% at
   0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm, respectively, over fallow. For acid
   phosphatase activity, LL, HB, and AI exhibited 3.15, 2.43, and 1.56
   folds increase over fallow. The distribution of different phosphorus
   fractions followed the order: Fe-P (39.9-36.7 \%)> Organic P (25.7-24.4
   \%) > Al-P (24.8-19.1 \%)> Ca-P (8.64-4.05 \%)> Res-P (8.61-7.37 \%)>
   Saloid P (0.63-0.50 \%). Additionally, P adsorption-desorption revealed
   that SCSs could lower the adsorption capacity and P desorption than
   fallow. Thus, different silviculture systems exhibit the potential to
   enhance the P-supplying capacity of soil and restore degraded soils in
   semi-arid regions.},

Abstract = {Plantation tree species have an immense potential for significantly
   reducing the atmospheric carbon dioxide and hence regulating climate
   change. The present study assessed the role of tree species to store
   carbon and soil enrichment in the eastern plateau and hill region of
   India. The species investigated were Leucaena leucophala, Gmelina
   arborea, Cassia siamea, and Eucalyptus tereticornis. The plantation of
   trees was found to have higher levels of soil organic carbon (SOC)
   (0.53-0.62\%), nitrogen (239.12-253.01 kg ha(-1)), phosphorus
   (37.02-38.79 kg ha(-1)), and potassium (175.47-237.22 kg ha(-1)) over
   the non-forested land (control) but was lower in the levels of pH
   (5.28-5.95) and bulk density (1.32-1.52 g cm(-3)). However, as soil
   depth increased, the nutritional status of both plantation and
   non-forested land soil decreased. The per cent SOC was the highest in
   surface layers, while the bulk density was the highest in sub-surface
   layers under different forest plantations. The maximum SOC (0.62\%) and
   bulk density (1.52 g cm(-3)) were present in Gmelina arborea and
   Eucalyptus tereticornis plantation, respectively. Among the studied tree
   species, the soil carbon density and carbon sequestration potential
   (CSP) were found to be maximum (13.56 t ha(-1) and 1.28 t ha(-1)
   year(-1)) in Gmelina arborea followed by Eucalyptus tereticornis, Cassia
   siamea, and Leucaena leucocephala, respectively, depicting that these
   tree species have a stronger capacity to sequester and store carbon,
   making them suitable as atmospheric carbon reducers. The study also
   demonstrated that forest plantation enhanced the SOC, nutrient stock,
   and other crucial soil fertility indicators compared to non-forested
   site.},

Abstract = {The effects of a high biochar rate on soil carbon mineralization, when
   co-applied with excessive compost, have been reported in previous
   studies, but there is a dearth of studies focusing on soil nitrogen. In
   order to ascertain the positive or snegative effects of a higher biochar
   rate on excessive compost, compost (5 wt. \%) and three slow pyrolysis
   (>700 degrees C) biochars (formosan ash (Fraxinus formosana Hayata), ash
   biochar; makino bamboo (Phyllostachys makino Hayata), bamboo biochar;
   and lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de. Wit), lead tree biochar)
   were applied (0, 2 and 5 wt. \%) to three soils (one Oxisols and two
   Inceptisols). Destructive sampling occurred at 1, 3, 7, 28, 56, 84, 140,
   196, 294, and 400 days to monitor for changes in soil chemistry. The
   overall results showed that, compared to the other rates, the 5\%
   biochar application rate significantly reduced the concentrations of
   inorganic N (NO3--N + NH4+-N) in the following, decreasing order: lead
   tree biochar > bamboo biochar > ash biochar. The soil response in terms
   of ammonium and nitrate followed a similar declining trend in the three
   soils throughout the incubation periods, with this effect increasing in
   tandem with the biochar application rate. Over time, the soil NO3--N
   increased, probably due to the excessive compost N mineralization;
   however, the levels of soil NO3--N in the sample undergoing the 5\%
   biochar application rate remained the lowest, to a significant degree.
   The soils' original properties determined the degree of ammonium and
   nitrate reduction after biochar addition. To reduce soil NO3--N
   pollution and increase the efficiency of compost fertilizer use, a high
   rate of biochar application (especially with that pyrolyzed at high
   temperatures (>700 degrees C)) to excessively compost-fertilized soils
   is highly recommended.},

Title = {Local Knowledge about Ecosystem Services Provided by Trees in Coffee
   Agroforestry Practices in Northwest Vietnam},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent decades in northwest Vietnam, Arabica coffee has been grown on
   sloping land in intensive, full sun monocultures that are not
   sustainable in the long term and have negative environmental impacts.
   There is an urgent need to reverse this negative trend by promoting good
   agricultural practices, including agroforestry, to prevent further
   deforestation and soil erosion on slopes. A survey of 124 farmers from
   three indigenous groups was conducted in northwest Vietnam to document
   coffee agroforestry practices and the ecosystem services associated with
   different tree species used in them. Trees were ranked according to the
   main ecosystem services and disservices considered to be locally
   relevant by rural communities. Our results show that tree species
   richness in agroforestry plots was much higher for coffee compared to
   non-coffee plots, including those with annual crops and tree
   plantations. Most farmers were aware of the benefits of trees for soil
   improvement, shelter (from wind and frost), and the provision of shade
   and mulch. In contrast, farmers had limited knowledge of the impact of
   trees on coffee quality and other interactions amongst trees and coffee.
   Farmers ranked the leguminous tree species Leucaena leucocephala as the
   best for incorporating in coffee plots because of the services it
   provides to coffee. Nonetheless, the farmers' selection of tree species
   to combine with coffee was highly influenced by economic benefits
   provided, especially by intercropped fruit trees, which was influenced
   by market access, determined by the proximity of farms to a main road.
   The findings from this research will help local extension institutions
   and farmers select appropriate tree species that suit the local context
   and that match household needs and constraints, thereby facilitating the
   transition to a more sustainable and climate-smart coffee production
   practice.},

   egg count (FEC) between 1450 and 2150 eggs per g/feces (EPG); MI group,
   medium FEC (592-1167 EPG); and the NI group, free from GIN infection.

   Leucaena leucocephala (low CT content, 3-5 \%), and Viguiera dentata
   (negligible CT content, 0.6-0.9 \%). Jacobs' selection indexes (JSIs)
   were estimated for the experimental foliage based on dry matter (DM),
   CT, or crude protein (CP) intake. During both study stages, individual
   fecal egg counts were estimated. The JSI patterns of different plant
   species, based on DM, CT, or CP, were similar irrespective of infection
   level during stage 1 (HI, MI, and NI) or no GIN infection (stage 2).
   Thus, irrespective of GIN infection, goats actively selected M.
   bahamensis (high CT, low CP content) and V. dentata (negligible CT, high
   CP content) but avoided G. floribundum (high CT, low CP content) and L.
   leucocephala (medium CT and high CP content). Thus, natural GIN
   infection did not influence goats' foliage selection.},

Abstract = {The immobilization of the glucose/mannose-binding lectin from
   Concanavalia ensiformis seeds (ConA) onto a monolayer made of a
   galactomannan extracted from Leucaena leucocephala seeds (GML), which
   was adsorbed onto - amino-terminated surfaces, was investigated by means
   of ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. The mean thickness of GML
   monolayer, which polysaccharide consists of linear 1 -> 4-linked
   beta-D-mannopyranosil units partially substituted at C-6 by
   alpha-D-galactopyranosyl units, amounted to (1.5 +/- 0.2) nm. ConA
   molecules adsorbed onto GML surfaces forming (2.0 +/- 0.5) nm thick
   layers. However, in the presence of mannose the adsorption failed,
   indicating that ConA binding sites were blocked by mannose and were no
   longer available for mannose units present in the GML backbone. The GML
   film was also used as support for the adsorption of three serotypes of
   dengue virus particles (DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3), where DENV-2 formed
   the thickest film (4 +/- 2) nm. The adsorbed layer of DENV-2 onto
   ConA-covered GML surfaces presented mean thickness values similar to
   that determined for DENV-2 onto bare GML surfaces. The addition of free
   mannose units prevented DENV-2 adsorption onto ConA-covered GML films by
   similar to 50\%, suggesting competition between virus and mannose for
   ConA binding sites. This finding suggests that if ConA is also adsorbed
   to GML surface and its binding site is blocked by free mannose, virus
   particles are able to recognized GML mannose unities substituted by
   galactose. interactions between polysaccharides thin films, proteins,
   and viruses are of great relevance since they can provide basis for the
   development of biotechnological devices. These results indicate that GML
   is a potential polysaccharide for biomaterials development, as those
   could involve interactions between ConA in immune system and viruses.

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Pages = {525-530},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Leaf quality (nutrient concentration) and herbivory were studied in a
   set of dominant tree species in regenerating, secondary tropical dry
   forests growing on limestone in the Yucatan Peninsula. The study's
   objective was to assess how variation in nutrient availability affects
   leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and herbivory. Our study
   included an area of young forest (10 y old), with phosphorus-poor soils,
   and an area of old forest (similar to60 y old), in which soil P was
   comparatively less limiting. The foliage of representative species of
   each site was studied, including Acacia gaumeri, Leucaena leucocephala
   and Lysiloma latisiliquum at the young forest site, and A. gaumeri,
   Bursera simaruba and Pithecellobium dulce at the old forest. Four
   independent plots (12 x 12 m) at each forest were either left intact
   (controls) or fertilized with N, with P, or with N plus P for three
   consecutive years. Relaxation of nutrient limitations at the young
   forest resulted in an increase in leaf phosphorus and herbivory in all
   species. In contrast, N and P fertilization at the old forest site did
   not consistently affect leaf nutrient concentration and leaf damage. In
   this site the main response to fertilization was an increase in leaf
   nitrogen only in B. simaruba and an increase in herbivory in A. gaumeri;
   leaf phosphorus was unaffected by soil fertilization. Overall, we
   observed that, subsequent to nutrient addition, leaf phosphorus
   concentration and herbivory in the leguminous species increased at the
   young site; leaf nitrogen concentration in the non-leguminous species
   increased at the old site while herbivory only increased in A. gaumeri,
   following a pattern similar to that observed in the young site. We
   conclude that the regulatory mechanisms of leaf quality and damage by
   herbivores will vary, depending on the details of the site's nutrient
   limitations and the identity of species.},

Abstract = {A litterbag experiment with Leucaena leucocephala and Senna siamea
   residues collected during four different pruning activities was carried
   out in no-tree-control and alley cropping plots. Decomposition was
   followed for 112 days after the respective pruning dates. Other factors
   studied were `'amount of residue'' confined in the litterbags and `'plot
   management'' (cropped or bare plots). The leaf litter of the same
   species, collected during the different prunings had different
   qualities. Older Leucaena and Senna residues had a lower N content.
   Older Leucaena residues contained substantially more polyphenols than
   residues younger than 8 weeks, while 8-week-old Senna residues contained
   more soluble polyphenols than residues of 29 weeks. The lignin content
   of the Leucaena residues was greatest for the oldest prunings; while for
   the Senna residues no clear trend was observed. The decomposition and N
   release patterns of the four Leucaena and Senna pruning residues were
   different. The first and second prunings decomposed following first
   order kinetics. For the third pruning, a negative exponential regression
   procedure against the number of days where rainfall exceeded pan
   evaporation (''rainy days'') yielded a better fit than against time.
   Less than 10\% of the dry matter of the fourth pruning decomposed after
   112 days. Significant correlations were found between the decomposition
   rate calculated against the number of `'rainy days'' and the N content,
   the C-to-N ratio and the (lignin + polyphenol)-to-N ratio. The N release
   rate, calculated against the number of `'rainy days'' correlated
   significantly with the polyphenol-to-N and (lignin + polyphenol)-to-N
   ratios. The presence of a fully established crop increased the
   decomposition and N release of the residues of the second pruning in the
   no-tree-control plots. The amount of residues confined in the litterbags
   and the presence of a tree canopy had little effect on residue
   decomposition. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Abstract = {The diversity of macro-invertebrates is related to the state of
   disturbance of the soil, caused mainly by the land-use change for
   agricultural activities. A strategy for the conservation of these
   organisms is the implementation of diversified production systems such
   as silvopastoral systems. However, in the Southeast of Mexico,
   information is still limited. The aim of the present study was to
   evaluate and compare the richness, abundance and composition of
   macro-invertebrates in four contrasting agro-ecosystems: two
   silvopastoral systems made of Leucaena leucocephala and associated
   pastures (i.e. Panicum maximum cv mombaza and Cynodon plectostachyus), a
   pasture of Brachiaria brizantha with scattered trees in low density and,
   a medium-statured tropical dry forest. In each system, an area of one
   hectare was delimited and a transect of 50 m in length was established
   in which five pit-fall traps were placed every 10 m. The sampling was
   carried out in February and May of 2018 and in each month five
   collections were made with five-day intervals. A total of 1 737
   organisms belonging to 10 orders of the class Insecta and one of the
   class Gastropoda were collected. The medium-statured tropical dry forest
   (923 individuals) and the silvopastoral systems of L. leucocephala with
   C. Plectostachyus (354 individuals) show the highest abundance of
   macro-invertebrates. The most abundant genera were: Hymenoptera,
   Coleoptera, Aracninae and Orthoptera. The higher macro-invertebrate
   diversity was found in the silvopastoral systems of L. leucocephala with
   P. maximum (H'= 1.58) and L. leucocephala with C. plectostachyus (H' =
   1.44). The results show that livestock systems managed with woody
   components (trees or shrubs) are home of an important abundance and
   richness of macro-invertebrates, compared to tropical forests. This
   diversity of macro-invertebrates may contribute to the integrity and
   functionality of the agro-ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Success in the remediation of mine spoil depends largely on the
   selection of appropriate tree species. The impacts of remediation on
   mine soil quality cannot be sufficiently assessed by individual soil
   properties. However, combination of soil properties into an integrated
   soil quality index provides a more holistic status of reclamation
   potentials of tree species. Remediation potentials of four tree species
   (Acacia auriculiformis, Cassia siamea, Dalbergia sissoo, and Leucaena
   leucocephala) were studied on reclaimed coal mine overburden dumps of
   Jharia coalfield, Dhanbad, India. Soil samples were collected under the
   canopies of the tree species. Comparative studies on the properties of
   soils in the reclaimed and the reference sites showed improvements in
   soil quality parameters of the reclaimed site: coarse fraction
   (-20.4\%), bulk density (-12.8\%), water holding capacity (+0.92\%), pH
   (+25.4\%), EC (+2.9\%), cation exchange capacity (+46.6\%), organic
   carbon (+91.5\%), N (+60.6\%), P (+113\%), K (+19.9\%), Ca (+49.6\%), Mg
   (+12.2\%), Na (+19.6\%), S (+46.7\%), total polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (-71.4\%), dehydrogenase activity (+197\%), and microbial
   biomass carbon (+115\%). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to
   identify key mine soil quality indicators to develop a soil quality
   index (SQI). Selected indicators include: coarse fraction, pH, EC, soil
   organic carbon, P, Ca, S, and dehydrogenase activity. The indicator
   values were converted into a unitless score (0-1.00) and integrated into
   SQI. The calculated SQI was significantly (P < 0.001) correlated with
   tree biomass and canopy cover. Reclaimed site has 52-93\% higher SQI
   compared to the reference site. Higher SQI values were obtained for
   sites reclaimed with D. sissoo (+93.1\%) and C. siamea (+86.4\%). (C)

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Phytophagous insects are excellent model organisms to study the genetic
   and ecological components of adaptation and morphological divergence,
   because their host plants are one of the main environmental factors
   influencing their early life stages. Although many lepidopterans are
   highly specialized in their host use, shifts to exotic plants have been
   reported for some species. Macaria mirthae is a native moth from
   Northern Chile that feeds preferentially on the Fabacea species Acacia
   macracantha, however due to habitat loss a host shift has recently been
   observed to the introduced fabacean Leucaena leucocephala. We studied
   the impact that different host plants have on the developmental
   instability levels in the moth's wing morphology evaluating both
   fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and directional asymmetry (DA). FA measures
   the small random deviations existing between the left and right sides of
   bilaterally symmetrical traits and it widely used as a biomonitor of
   environmental quality. DA refers to the tendency for a trait to be
   consistently developed in a different manner on the right and left sides
   of the body. It has been recently shown that subtle DA patterns seem to
   be a ubiquitous phenomenon among bilaterian animals. Our results
   confirmed the presence of FA in M. mirthae forewings by applying
   geometric morphometric techniques. Furthermore, it was found that the
   individuals feeding on the endemic tree (A. macracantha) showed marked
   DA levels, while the specimens inhabiting the exotic plant (L.
   leucocephala) did not. The absence of DA in the individuals occupying
   the exotic plant is striking, because it has been established that this
   asymmetry pattern is widespread among insect wings. This phenomenon
   could be related to the influence of L. leucocephala on normal wing
   development. Despite the reduced quality of L. leucocephala as host
   plant, its wider presence in the Azapa valley (Chile) could explain the
   host shift made by M. mirthae.},

Pages = {1039-1046},
Abstract = {The biological effect of tannins (proportion of the response in
   different parameters when tannins were inactivated with polyethylene
   glycol, PEG) as an easy, rapid way to estimate the magnitude of their
   effect on rumen microbial fermentation, was estimated in vitro for the
   tropical browse legumes Albizia lebbekoides, Acacia cornigera and
   Leucaena leucocephala, which differ in their phenolic and tannin
   content. Samples were incubated in rumen fluid for 24 h in four runs.
   The inactivation by PEG of tannins from A. lebbekoides increased gas
   production from 1.62- to 2.83-fold, with this biological effect
   increasing up to 8 h incubation, then being maintained and increasing
   after 16 h. In A. cornigera and L. leucocephala, the magnitude of the
   improvement of gas production was lower (from 1.1- to 1.32-fold and from
   1.29- to 1.56-fold) and constant. The inclusion of PEG increased total
   volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration (P = 0.019), reduced the molar
   proportion of acetate (P < 0.001) and increased that of butyrate (P <
   0.001) and branched-chain VFA (P < 0.001). Microbial protein mass in A.
   lebbekoides increased with PEG in a higher extent (P < 0.001) than in L.
   leucocephala, but it was reduced in A. cornigera. No biological effect
   was observed on the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis when it
   was related to VFA concentration (P > 0.10), but when related to the gas
   produced it was lowest with A. lebbekoides (P = 0.023). The biological
   effect of tannins, either in total extent or along the incubation period
   differed according to their origin. Irrespective of their amount or
   chemical nature, the biological effect gives a direct idea of how
   tannins affect both the extent and pattern of forages fermentation.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of tree-leaf biomass as a source of N to crops in
   agroforestry systems depends on the rate at which crops can obtain N
   from the biomass. A study was conducted to determine the fate of N-15
   labeled, soil-applied biomass of two hedgerow species, Calliandra
   calothyrsus Meissner (calliandra) and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit (leucaena), in the subhumid highlands of Kenya. Labeled biomass
   obtained from N-15 fertilized trees was applied to microplots in an
   alley cropping field and maize planted. N uptake and recovery by maize
   and hedgerow trees was periodically determined over a 20-week period
   during the short rain (1995) and the long rain (1996) growing seasons.
   In maize crop from treatments that received leucaena biomass, higher N
   uptake and recovery were recorded than in maize from the plots that
   received calliandra biomass. However, N uptake and recovery were higher
   in calliandra tree hedges than in leucaena hedges, indicating
   differences in N uptake by the two tree species. The largest fraction
   (55-69\%) of N in the applied tree biomass was left: in the soil N pool,
   8-13\% recovered by maize, 2-3\% by tree hedges, and 20-30\% could not
   be accounted for. Some of the unaccounted for N may have been left in
   the wood and root portions of the tree hedges and in the bulk soil below
   the 20-cm depth. The study shows that only a small fraction of the N
   contained in the N-rich biomass that is applied to the soil is taken up
   by the current season's crop, suggesting that a major benefit may be in
   the build-up of the soil N store.},

Abstract = {Transfer of a cosmid containing nodSU from Rhizobium sp. NGR234 to
   Rhizobium fredii USDA257 expands the host range for nodulation to
   include the perennial tropical legumes, Leucaena leucocephala and
   Leucaena diversifolia. Complementation experiments with a series of
   subclones established that nodS and its associated nod-box promoter from
   NGR234 are sufficient to confer this extended host-range phenotype to L.
   leucocephala. Strain USDA257 contains its own copy of nodSU, including
   upstream nod-box sequences. Although both nucleotide and deduced amino
   acid sequences of the reading frames are homologous between the two
   strains, there are gaps within the promoter region and the 5'-end of
   nodS of USDA257. Consequently, the deduced NodS protein of USDA257 is
   shorter than its counterpart from NGR234, and the distance between the
   nod-box and the initiation codon is greater. A 36 bp deletion
   encompasses the extreme right border of the USDA257 nod-box and extends
   into the upstream leader sequence. Transcriptional fusions with both
   nod-boxes confirmed that the promoter from NGR234 is
   flavonoid-inducible, and that the nod-box from USDA257 is not. These
   observations were corroborated by Northern analysis with a
   nodS-containing Xhol fragment as hybridization probe. Flavonoid-induced
   cells of NGR234 gave an intense signal, but those of USDA257 yielded
   only a weak trace of hybridization. EcoRI fragments with homology to
   nodSU of USDA257 are present in 17 of 35 tested strains, including
   several representatives of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Rhizobium sp., R.
   loti, and R. fredii. Two wild-type, leucaena-nodulating strains of
   Rhizobium sp. lack this homology. We conclude that a genetic defect in
   expression of nodS accounts for the inability of USDA257 to nodulate

Abstract = {The so-called common nodulation (nod) gene cluster of Bradyrhizobium
   japonicum is characterized by a unique composition of genes that are
   arranged in the following order: nodY, nodA, nodB, nodC,nodS, nodU,
   nodI, nodJ. As reported here, the identification of the two new genes
   nodS and nodU resulted from the DNA sequencing ofa 4.5-kilobase
   nodC-downstream region covering nodS, nodU, nodI, and nodJ. The
   predicted NodS, NodU, NodI, and NodJ proteins had the following
   respective amino acid (aa) lengths and molecular weights (Mr): 209 aa,
   Mr 23,405; 569 aa, Mr 62,068; 306 aa, Mr 34,127; and 262 aa, Mr 28,194.
   The 3'' end of nodC overlapped the 5'' end of nodS by 71 nucleotides.
   Using translational fusions of lacZ to nodC, nodS, and nodU, the
   expression of these genes was shown to be inducible by the isoflavone
   daidzein and depended on transcription from a DNA region farther
   upstream. These data and the adjacent location of all genes suggested
   the existence of a nodYABCSUIJ operon. The nodI and nodJ gene products
   shared about 70\% sequence similarity with the corresponding Rhizobium
   leguminosarum bv. viciae proteins; NodI belongs to the family of
   ATP-binding proteins that are constituents of bacterial binding
   protein-dependent transport systems. By interspecies hybridization, DNA
   regions homologous to nodSU were detected in other strains of
   Bradyrhizobium. Likewise, nodS-and nodU-like genes were identified in
   Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234 (A. Lewin, E. Cervantes, W. Chee-Hoong, and
   W. J. Broughton, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions 3:317-326, 1990)
   in which nodS confers host specificity for Leucaena leucocephala. We
   constructed B. japonicum nodS and nodU mutants that, however, had no
   altered nodulation behavior of soybean, cowpea, mung bean, and Siaratro.},

Abstract = {Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L. Moench) is a beneficial vegetable and
   oil crop that has found valuable use as food, paper, medicine, and oil.
   However, because of climate change, a lack of better okra cultivars that
   can resist drought has hampered okra production in sub-Saharan Africa
   (SSA) and across the world. This study aimed to investigate the economic
   production of this vegetable in a forest setting. The okra (A.
   esculentus L.) experiment was conducted underneath three forest trees
   (i.e. Albizia lebbeck, Melia azedarach, and Leucaena leucocephala) in
   the agroforestry area. A single-factor Randomised Complete Block Design
   (RCBD) with three replications was utilised. The sample was then
   separated into three groups: okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry, okra-M.
   azedarach agroforestry, and okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry. The findings
   of the study revealed that okra production had differed significantly in
   three agroforestry practices. The fresh okra yield was highest (10.20
   ton/ha) in the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry. The okra-L. leucocephala
   agroforestry (9.10 ton/ha) came in second, while the lowest yield was in
   the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry (8.90 ton/ha). Moreover, the okra-A.
   lebbeck agroforestry recorded the maximum benefit-cost ratio (3.97) for
   economic performance. This ratio was 21\% and 14\% higher compared to
   the respective performance of the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry and
   okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry. However, the highest amount of carbon
   sequestration (238.90 ton/ha/yr) was measured in the okra-M. azedarach
   agroforestry as well as (229.80 ton/ha/yr) in the okra-A. lebbeck
   agroforestry practice. Finally, the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry
   practice would significantly increase production, touching financial
   benefit and ensuring sound environmental quality using the vacant
   woodlot space.},

Abstract = {To test the applicability of alternate land use systems for improving
   soil functionality in restored ecologies, soils were sampled from 0-15,
   15-30 and 30-45 cm deep layers of Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Hardwickia
   binata (HB), Emblica officinalis (EO), Azadiracta indica (AI)-based
   silviculture systems; Acacia nilotica-based silvipasture systems (AN);
   and natural grassland (NG). These were compared with samples from fallow
   land (F). They were evaluated for their carbon management index (CMI),
   nutrient supply capacity (NSC), soil functionality (SF), ecorestoration
   efficiency (ERE) and 21-day cumulative microbial respiration (CO2-21) to
   assess their applicability in semiarid India. Soil functionality and
   functional diversity as impacted by restoration have remained largely
   overlooked. The LL had similar to 12, 7 and 11\% higher CMI than fallow
   in sampled soil layers. ERE of LL was similar to 55, 65 and 79\% higher
   than fallow land in sampled soil layers, respectively. However, ERE in
   surface layer was poorer than subsequent soil layers for all systems.
   The LL, HB and AN improved NSC and SF by: a) similar to 2.5-, 2.2- and
   1.6-times; and b) 9.3-, 5.3- and 5.1-times over fallow land in the
   surface soil layer. A similar trend was observed for SF in lower layers.
   However, the topsoil layer had >16\% mean SF values than subsequent
   layers. LL, HB and AN systems had similar to 4.2-, 2.3- and 1.9-times
   higher CO2-21 than fallow land in the top layer. CO2-21 was positively
   correlated with NSC and SF but could not predict ERE well. Hence, legume
   tree-based restoration tactics might be useful for improving land
   restoration and soil functionality in semiarid regions.},

Abstract = {The use of plant materials as soil amendments is an uncommon practice
   amongst major farming communities in Ghana, although it is necessary for
   soil fertility improvement. An examination of the effects of soil
   amendments is necessary to encourage the use of under-utilized organic
   resources in Ghana. Thus, a field experiment was conducted using 8
   different tropical plant materials mixed with chicken manure as soil
   amendments for growth of tomato as a test crop. The plant materials
   included Leucaena leucocephala, Centrosema pubescens, Sesbania sesban,
   Gliricidia sepium, Mucuna pruriens, Pueraria phaseoloides, Azadirachta
   indica, and Theobroma cacao. There were two other treatments: one with
   equivalent amounts of chemical fertilizers and the other with
   no-fertilizer input (control). Plant materials were mixed with chicken
   manure to obtain a uniform carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio of 5:1. Except
   the no-fertilizer control, all treatments received the same amount of
   nitrogen (N). To clarify the decomposition pattern of the plant
   materials in soil, an incubation experiment was conducted using only the
   plant materials before the field experiment. The Gliricidia treatment
   released significantly more mineral N than the other plant materials in
   the incubation experiment. However, the tomato fruit yield was not
   enhanced in the Gliricidia treatment in the field experiment. The known
   quality parameters of the tested plant materials, such as total N, total
   carbon (C), C:N ratio, and total polyphenols, had minimal effects on
   their mineralization dynamics. Azadirachta showed the best synergistic
   effect with chicken manure through significantly increasing soil
   microbial biomass and fruit yield of tomato. This result provides
   insights into the possible adoption of Azadirachta in combination with
   chicken manure as a soil amendment in small-scale agricultural holdings.},

Title = {Effects of Biochar to Excessive Compost-Fertilized Soils on the Nutrient
   Status},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Positive effects of a biochar-compost mix on soil nutrient status in
   infertile soil have been reported, but the potential effect of biochar
   amendments in excessive compost-fertilized soils has not been
   extensively studied. Excessive application of compost can result in the
   accumulation of nutrients and heavy metals (Cu and Zn). Thus, the
   objective of this study is to investigate the effect of
   biochar-excessive compost co-application on soil nutrient status. We
   hypothesized that biochar co-application could have positive effects on
   the absorption of excessive nutrients of Cu and Zn. A 371-day laboratory
   incubation study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the lead tree
   (Leucaena leucocephala(Lam.) de. Wit) biochar produced at 750 degrees C
   on the dynamics of the soil nutrients. Three Taiwan rural soils were
   selected, including slightly acidic Oxisols (SAO), mildly alkaline
   Inceptisols (MAI), and slightly acid Inceptisols (SAI). The biochar
   treatments include control (0\%) and 0.5\%, 1.0\%, and 2.0\% (w/w). In
   each treatment, 5\% (w/w) poultry-livestock manure compost was added to
   test excessive application. The results indicated that the biochar
   treatments had a significant increase effect on soil pH, total carbon
   (TC), total nitrogen (TN), C:N ratio, and available K concentration. The
   effect of biochar on electrical conductivity (EC) and available P, Ca,
   Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, and Zn was insignificant. The effect of biochar,
   with relatively low application rates (<2\% by wt), low surface area,
   and less surface function group, was eliminated by excessive compost
   (5\% by wt). In addition to carbon sequestration and nitrogen
   conservation, biochar addition has no effect on the absorption of the
   excessive nutrients Cu and Zn in three studied soils.},

Title = {RNA-seq analysis of the Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 transcriptome
   shows similarities in the activation patterns of symbiotic genes in the
   presence of apigenin and salt},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {Background: Rhizobium tropici strain CIAT 899 establishes effective
   symbioses with several legume species, including Phaseolus vulgaris and
   Leucaena leucocephala. This bacterium synthesizes a large variety of
   nodulation factors in response to nod-gene inducing flavonoids and,
   surprisingly, also under salt stress conditions. The aim of this study
   was to identify differentially expressed genes in the presence of both
   inducer molecules, and analyze the promoter regions located upstream of
   these genes.
   Results: Results obtained by RNA-seq analyses of CIAT 899 induced with
   apigenin, a nod gene-inducing flavonoid for this strain, or salt allowed
   the identification of 19 and 790 differentially expressed genes,
   respectively. Fifteen of these genes were up-regulated in both
   conditions and were involved in the synthesis of both Nod factors and
   indole-3-acetic acid. Transcription of these genes was presumably
   activated through binding of at least one of the five NodD proteins
   present in this strain to specific nod box promoter sequences when the
   bacterium was induced by both apigenin and salt. Finally, under saline
   conditions, many other transcriptional responses were detected,
   including an increase in the transcription of genes involved in
   trehalose catabolism, chemotaxis and protein secretion, as well as
   ribosomal genes, and a decrease in the transcription of genes involved
   in transmembrane transport.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first time that a
   transcriptomic study shows that salt stress induces the expression of
   nodulation genes in the absence of flavonoids. Thus, in the presence of
   both nodulation inducer molecules, apigenin and salt, R. tropici CIAT
   899 up-regulated the same set of symbiotic genes. It could be possible
   that the increases in the transcription levels of several genes related
   to nodulation under saline conditions could represent a strategy to
   establish symbiosis under abiotic stressing conditions.},

Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {205},
Pages = {42-48},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper was to propose a new approach to evaluate the
   effect of tannins on rumen microbial fermentation in terms of biological
   effect (proportion of the response if tannins are inactivated, BE) and
   reactivity (capability of tannins to bind chemically with different
   amounts of a reagent), by recording gas production in 24 h in vitro
   incubation of substrates with increasing levels (0.025-1 g/g substrate)
   of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Three tropical browse legumes with
   different tannin contents (Acacia cornigera, Albizia lebbekoides and
   Leucaena leucocephala) were chosen as model substrates. The reactivity
   index (RI, mg PEG) and absolute reactivity index (aRI, mg PEG/ml gas)
   were estimated from the rate coefficient of fitting gas production per
   unit of added PEG to an exponential equation for each incubation time.
   The RI characterises each specific tannin source, and depends on the
   potential fermentation of the plant. The average RI values of A.
   cornigera, L. leucocephala and A. lebbekoides were 70.4, 36.3 and 55.7
   mg PEG, respectively. The aRI is a tool for species comparison, because
   it is referred to the total volume of gas produced. It was higher in A.
   lebbekoides, intermediate in A. cornigera and lowest in L. leucocephala
   (1.57, 0.76 and 1.14 mg PEG/ml gas, respectively; P=0.012). This index
   was higher at 6 h than at 12 and 24 h (1.62, 0.96 and 0.89 mg PEG/ml
   gas, P<0.001). The estimation of these indexes is a simple and
   inexpensive tool that gives a more complete view of the biological
   activity pattern of tannins in practical conditions, complementing that
   of other biological effect indexes and avoiding the biases that arise
   from their chemical analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Asian tropical forests are under extreme stress from clearance,
   fragmentation, and logging. Because Singapore suffered these same
   impacts in the 19th century, it can act as an early warning system for
   the region. We identified invasive exotic tree species from a
   comprehensive survey, assessed their survival and growth in the open and
   under a forest canopy, and compared their traits with native pioneers
   and widely planted exotic species that have failed to naturalize. Nine
   species were invasive: Acacia auriculiformis (ear-leaf acacia), Cecropia
   pachystachya (trumpet tree), Falcataria moluccana (Moluccan albizia),
   Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena), Manihot carthaginensis subp. glazioyii
   (Ceara rubber tree), Muntingia calabura (Jamaican cherry tree), Piper
   aduncum (spiked pepper), Pipturus argenteus (white mulberry), and
   Spathodea campanulata (African tulip tree). Under the forest canopy, all
   grew little and suffered high (75-100\%) mortality, with Spathodea
   surviving best. At the open site, mortality was low (0-25\%) and height
   growth rapid (1.6-8.6 cm wk'), with Leucaena growing fastest. The only
   significant trait difference between native pioneer trees and invasive
   exotics was the dispersal syndrome; none of the common native pioneers
   are wind dispersed, while two invasive species are. Among exotics, there
   were highly significant differences between invasive and non-invasive
   species in wood density and seed size, with invasive species having only
   54\% of the mean wood density and 19\% of the dry seed mass of
   non-invasive species. Invasive exotics were also significantly farther
   from their native ranges than non-invasive species. None of these
   invasive tree species is a direct threat to the integrity of native
   closed-canopy forest, but they dominate on newly abandoned land and may
   pre-empt the recovery of native forest on such sites.},

Abstract = {The importance of the Northern Guam aquifer as a source of drinking
   water for the tropical Pacific island of Guam has stimulated public
   interest in the impact of forest clearing and conversion to agriculture
   on the region's environment. The objectives of this study were to
   determine the effects of land clearing, tillage, and fertilization of
   tropical secondary forest on soil organic and organic C fractions in the
   shallow, calcareous soil that overlies most of Northern Guam. A field
   experiment was established on a secondary forest site in Northern Guam
   to simulate land clearing, cultivation and fertilization with two
   separate applications of N, P and K fertilizer or leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) leaves. Initial aboveground biomass of
   secondary forest was relatively low in comparison to that of other moist
   tropical forest sites, possibly because of poor soil fertility, shallow
   soil depth, and frequent natural disturbance from tropical storms. Rates
   of litterfall were also affected by the high winds associated with storm
   activity. Clearing, cultivation and fertilization over a 325-day period
   significantly reduced microbial biomass C. Soil surface CO2 efflux was
   characterized by short-term flushes shortly after tillage and was
   affected by soil moisture content and possibly by the proportion of
   active organic C contained in the soil. A comparison of commercial
   fields with continuous cultivation histories of 1-26 years and forest
   sites in Northern Guam showed approximately a 44\% decrease in soil
   organic C within 5 years after conversion of secondary forest to
   continuous cultivation. Further information is needed on the
   effectiveness of minimum tillage, application of organic amendments, or
   improved crop residue management to maintain soil organic C in Northern
   Guam. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   depending on shrub regrowth. A treatment with high N and water supply
   was included in one of the cycles to quantify the effect of shade alone
   on potential growth.
   Aboveground biomass (DM) and leaf area index (LAI) of swards were not
   depressed by the reduction of incoming PAR. The reduction in transmitted
   PAR by shrubs was compensated by an increase in the radiation use
   efficiency (RUE) of shaded swards. Higher RUE of unfertilised, shaded
   stands may be explained by higher levels of N availability in the soil.
   This is supported by the analysis of curves relating sward N
   accumulation to sward DM accumulation. In fact, for similar measured
   biomass the accummulated N was higher in shaded stands, a consequence of
   their higher N concentrations. This allowed shaded leaves to improve
   their CO2 assimilation rates on a leaf area basis. Higher RUE reported
   on shaded stands may be the consequence of higher leaf CO2 assimilation
   rates and also possible changes in the shoot:root ratio. As with N, the
   amount of K taken up by the sward was higher under shade, whereas P data
   were higher under shade only during the driest cycle. A positive water
   balance, alone or in combination with high N fertilisation, eliminated
   the improvement of the N nutrition of shaded stands. Thus, the positive
   effects of shade may be only observed when N and water are limiting
   sward growth in the open.},

Title = {A STUDY OF THE POTENTIAL OF HEDGEROW INTERCROPPING IN SEMIARID INDIA

Abstract = {The potential of hedgerow intercropping with Leucaena leucocephala was
   explored on vertic Inceptisols over 4 years at ICRISAT Center,
   Patancheru, India. The study was conducted using a systematic layout
   involving different alley widths ranging from 1.35 to 4.95 m and with
   varying distances between hedge and crops. The alleys were cropped with
   alternate rows of sorghum and pigeonpea. Hedges composed double Leucaena
   hedgerows 60 cm apart were periodically harvested for fodder. Sole crops
   of  all components and a sorghum/pigeonpea intercrop were included in
   all four replications of the study. Starting in the second year,
   Leucaena was progressively more competitive to annual crops, causing
   substantial yield reduction. Competition (primarily for moisture) was
   most severe in narrow alleys and was greatest on pigeonpea. The growth
   of Leucaena was not sufficient to compensate for reduced crop yields.
   Land equivalent ratios (LERs) calculated on the basis of grain yield of
   crops and  Leucaena fodder yields showed that hedgerow intercropping
   (HI) was advantageous over sole crops only during the first two years
   using wide alleys, but disadvantageous in the last two years. LERs
   calculated on the basis of total dry matter indicated only a smaller
   advantage for HI (3-17 percent) over sole crops in wider (>4 m) alleys.
   Average returns per year from HI exceeded those of the most productive
   annual crop system (sorghum/pigeonpea intercropping) by 8 percent in
   4.05 m alleys, and by  16 percent in 4.95 m alleys. Fodder production
   during the dry season was 40 percent of the annual total in these alley
   widths. Thus hedgerow intercropping at 4-5 m alley width is not very
   attractive for farmers in semi-arid India, which has 600-700 mm of
   annual rainfall. There is a need to examine the potential of HI in wider
   alleys. The merits and limitations of the systematic design are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of the processes influencing the storage and dynamics
   of carbon (C) in soils under semi-arid agroforestry systems in
   Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is limited. This study evaluated soil C pools
   in woodlot species of Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth., Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) de Wit, Melia azedarach (L.), and Gmelina arborea Roxb.; and in
   farmland and Ngitili, a traditional silvopastoral system in northwestern
   Tanzania. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was analyzed in the whole soil to 1
   m depth and to 0.4 m in macroaggregates (2000-250 mu m), microaggregates
   (250-53 mu m), and silt and clay-sized aggregates (< 53 mu m) to provide
   information of C dynamics and stabilization in various land uses.
   Synchrotron-based C K-edge x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)
   spectroscopy was also used to study the influence of these land use
   systems on the soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry to understand the
   mechanisms of soil C changes. Whole soil C stocks in woodlots (43-67 Mg
   C ha(-1)) were similar to those in the reserved Ngitili systems (50-59
   Mg C ha(-1)), indicating the ability of the planted woodlots on degraded
   lands to restore SOC levels similar to the natural woodlands. SOC in the
   woodlots were found to be associated more with the micro and silt-and
   clay-sized aggregates than with macroaggregates, reflecting higher
   stability of SOC in the woodlot systems. The continuous addition of
   litter in the woodlots preserved recalcitrant aromatic C compounds in
   the silt and clay-sized aggregates as revealed by the XANES C K-edge
   spectra. Therefore establishment of woodlots in semi-arid regions in
   Tanzania appear to make significant contributions to the long-term SOC
   stabilization in soil fractions.},

Abstract = {Feeding roughage to cattle can produce a high methane emission from
   fermentation process in the rumen which pollute the environment. The
   objective of this study was to investigate the ruminal fermentability
   modification through the utilization of feed supplement to reduce
   methane emission from cattle. In vitro study was conducted using ruminal
   fluid to assess the fermentation characteristics of the three
   experimental rations. The basal ration consisted of field grass, urea
   and molasses. Urea and molasses were given in the ratio 1: 5 to fulfil
   the requirement of ruminal microbes. The other two experimental rations
   were obtained by adding soybean meal as protein feed supplement and
   ketepeng leaves-Cassia alata ( defined as SBM-K) or leucaena leaves (
   Leucaena leucocephala) as protein feed supplement and ketepeng leaves (
   defined as LL-K) to basal ration at the amount of 20 g/kg body
   weight(0.75). Ketepeng leaves contain quinone which can bind the
   hydrogen, thus, it may reduce the hydrogen used for methane formation.
   The cattle ruminal fluid was used as inoculum source. Gas production was
   measured according to gas test procedure with three replicates. The
   parameters of microbial fermentation included NH3 concentration and
   total gas production were not affected by the rations. The synthesis of
   microbial protein of the basal ration was higher than SBM-K and LL-K (
   P<0.05). Total volatile fatty acids production was not affected by the
   rations ( Table 3). However, the SBM-K and LL-K produced lower
   propionate and ratio of acetate: propionate than the basal ration (
   P<0.05). The LL-K generated numerically lower methane than basal ration.
   The utilization of feed supplement could maintain fermentation under
   normal condition and modification of ruminal fermentation has the
   potential to reduce the methane emission from cattle.},

Abstract = {Topsoil (0-15 cm) hulk density, aggregate stability soil dispersibility,
   water retention and infiltration were measured between 1989 and 1996 on
   an Alfisol under rehabilitation in southwestern Nigeria. The planted
   leguminous species were Pueraria phaseoloides, Senna siilnrrir, Leucaena
   leucocephala,, Acacia leptocarpa and A. auriculiformis. plots with
   natural fallow and maize/cassava intercropping were included. Level
   (minimum) and mound tillage with hoes was adopted for the cultivated
   areas under study after 4 and 6 year fallow periods. Under fallow, the
   soil bulk density decreased from 1.56 to 1.11 t m(-3). The continuously
   cropped treatment (level tillage) had significantly higher bulk density
   than the fallowed subplots after 6 years. Mean soil penetrometer
   resistance ranged from 75 to 157 kPa for fallowed plots and from 192 to
   295 kPa for the continuously cropped (level tillage) subplot. Surface
   soil water contents were similar for all the treatments during the soil
   strength measurements. Although soil aggregates were generally of low
   stability and not well formed, they were improved by fallowing.
   Soil structural improvement by planted fallows was similar to that by
   natural fallow, but the trees were more promising for long-term fallow
   (>6 years) than the herbaceous P. phaseoloides. However, the improvement
   in soil structure after 4 or 6 rear falloff could not be maintained in
   subsequent cropping. Furthermore, the significant improvement in soil
   bulk density caused by A. auriculiformis and natural fallow was more
   rapidly lost on the cultivated subplots compared with other fallow
   treatments. Thus, soil structure recovery under a fallow does not imply
   a sustained improvement when stress is applied to this soil. Post-fallow
   soil management options such as residue incorporation and tillage to
   ameliorate compaction or soil strength mill be necessary to enhance the
   improvements by fallow species.},

Abstract = {The fermentation kinetics of leaves of eleven tropical forage legumes
   varying in phenolic and condensed tannin content were investigated. The
   leaf samples were from Acacia cyanophylla, Chamaecytisus palmensis,
   Calliandra sp., Dioclea guianensis, Flemingia macrophylla, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Sesbania sesban, S. goetzei and three accessions of
   Tadehagi sp. (accession numbers 13269, 13275 and 23227). The phenolic,
   condensed tannin (bound condensed tannin and extractable condensed
   tannin) and non-starch polysaccharide (NSP = to dietary fibre) contents
   of leaves were determined. Leaves were incubated at 39 degrees C with
   rumen micro-organisms in a habitat-simulating medium and the
   fermentation kinetics investigated using a pressure transducer. The NSP
   content of leaves both pre-and post-incubation was quantified and
   proportional losses of the NSP constituents calculated. The NSP content
   of leaves ranged from 124-252 mg g(-1) dry matter, the major components
   in each case being cellulose-derived glucose and the uronic acids. In
   all samples, the most degradable NSP constituent was the uronic acids,
   closely followed by arabinose; cellulose-derived glucose and xylose were
   the least degradable NSP components. Samples ranked in terms of
   asymptotic gas-pool in descending order as follows: L. leucocephala = C.
   palmensis > D. guianensis > S. sesban > A. cyanophylla > S. goetzei >
   Tadehagi sp., (23227) > Tadehagi sp., (13269) > F. macrophylla >

   relationships between gas accumulation throughout the incubation and the
   NSP loss (NSPL) values at the end of the incubation. Moreover, the gas
   pool at the end of the incubation period and NSPL were significantly
   correlated (r = 0.90) with a yield constant (ml gas g(-1) NSP loss) of
   200 ml. Furthermore, there were significant (P less than or equal to
   0.05) negative relationships between both gas accumulation and NSPL and
   the phenolic and condensed tannin content of leaves.},

   collected during the spring of 1993 in Marin, County, Nuevo Leon,
   Mexico. Medicago sativa hay was used for comparison, Twelve ruminally
   cannulated male sheep (45 kg BW) were used (four sheep per plant) to
   incubate nylon bags (5 x 10 cm and 53 mu m pore size); containing 4 g of
   ground material (1 mm screen) of each plant. Bags were incubated at 0,
   4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h. The rate of CW degradation (c, \%) was highest (P
   < 0.001) in O. lindehimieri (9.8) and lowest in A. rigidula (2.8). Only
   0. lindehimieri and C. pallida (8.5) had higher CW degradation rates
   than M. sativa (7.1). Effective degradability of CW (EDCW), at outflow
   rates of 2\%, 5\% and 8\% h(-1) values were higher in C. pallida (74.3,

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The potential forage value and appropriate length of study on intake and
   relative palatability ranking of 40 multipurpose tree species (MPTs)
   were determined using 24 sheep blocked on live weight and age. As the
   MPTs had different dry matter contents, intakes were also expressed as a
   ratio of quantity offered (A(i)/D-i). Using daily Eragrostis tef straw
   offer (TD) and intake (T), relative palatability indices were calculated
   as
   R(i) = (A(i)/D-i)/(T-i/TDi).
   There was a significant (P < 0.0001) decrease in correlation of intake
   measured in day 1 and subsequent days (r = 0.88, 0.81 and 0.79 for days
   2-4, days 5-8 and days 9-12, respectively). A similar trend was observed
   on corresponding palatability indices. Individual animal preference and
   blocking did not affect intake and palatability indices significantly (P
   > 0.05), however significant (P < 0.0001) tree species differences were
   observed. Results on linear regression, correlation coefficients,
   palatability ranking and standard errors of means (adjusted palatability
   indices) indicate that, if palatability is done to predict long-term
   intake of MPTs, at least 5 days are appropriate in palatability
   assessment for sheep.
   Using mean palatability index (days 2-12), the MPTs were grouped into
   four clusters. The MPTs such as Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania
   sesban which are known to have good nutritive value had high
   palatability. In the same classification group, there were less known
   species such as Acacia venosa, A. persiciflora, A. melanoxylon, A.
   hockii, A. polyacantha, Tamarindus indica, Chamaecytisus palmensis,
   Tipuana tipu, Indigofera arrecta and Atriplex nummularia. Flemingia
   macrophylla, Erythrina abyssinica, Acacia salicina, Acacia coriacea,
   Albizia schimperiana, Ceratonia siliqua, Casuarina glauca and Erythrina
   burana had poor palatability. These species seem to have little forage
   value for animals with short-term adaptation periods. Gliricida sepium
   and Calliandra calothyrsus although currently being used by farmers had
   a medium palatability ranking.},

Abstract = {Background: Rhizobial bacteria is an important species among the soil
   bacteria that inter a relationship with leguminous plant and fix
   nitrogen symbiotically. Importance of this relation not only for soil as
   soil fertilizer but also to keep our environment without pollution.
   Methods: Survey was conducted to collect different strains of rhizobial
   from different area in Nineveh Governate in Iraq. Isolation and
   biochemical tests were done under laboratory conditions. Determination
   of exopolysaccharide and tolerance of heavy metal was conducted also.
   Data obtained was recorded after cultivation and incubation of rhizobial
   strains.Results: The rhizobial bacteria were isolated from the following
   leguminous plants: Vigna unguiculata L., Trifolium alexandrinum,
   Trigonella foenum-graecum L., Leucaena leucocephala L., Medicago sativa
   L., Phaseolus vulgaris L., Tribulus terrestris L. and Vicia faba L.
   Maximum exopolysaccharide production were reached to 3.70 gm/L by the
   isolate R. leguminosarum bv. Viciae RM25,after two days of incubation.
   The maximum cell dry weight was 2.90 gm/L. by the isolate E. meliloti
   RM14, after two days of incubation. Maximum reduction in pH were 4.30 by
   strain E. meliloti RM5, after two days incubation. All the local
   isolated rhizobia were tolerated to nickel chloride for the studied
   concentrations: 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 mu g/ ml. Also were tolerance to
   100 and 500 mu g/ ml of zinc sulfate and copper sulfate. 1000 mu g/ ml
   concentration of zinc sulfate were also tolerated by all rhizobial
   isolates.Conclusion: Rhizobium bacteria possess several mechanisms that
   allow them to tolerate heavy metal exposure. These mechanisms include
   the expression of efflux pumps, the presence of metal-resistance
   plasmids, the production of EPS, and the ability to adapt to
   environmental factors. Further research is needed to fully understand
   the mechanisms behind the heavy metal tolerance in Rhizobium and to
   explore the potential applications of these bacteria in bioremediation
   of heavy metal polluted soils.},

Abstract = {With limited use of inorganic fertilizers on smallholder farms, plant
   residues could be viable alternatives for soil fertility improvement.
   This study was conducted to determine how residue quality and
   decomposition of nine plant species influence soil N availability,
   microbial biomass, and beta-glucosidase activity during soil fertility
   improvement. Significant differences in N concentration were found among
   the species, ranging from 12.2 g kg(-1) in Zea mays to 39.2 g kg(-1) in
   Baphia nitida. The C/N ratio was the highest in Z. mays (34.4), whereas
   lignin and polyphenol concentrations were the greatest in Acacia
   auriculiformis. The highest decomposition rate (0.251\% per day)
   occurred in Tithonia diversifolia, and the lowest in A. auriculiformis,
   Albizia zygia, B. nitida, and Z. mays, with the half-lives of 28-56 d.
   Between 80\% and 89\% of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg were released from T.
   diversifolia in 7 d, compared with over 70\% retention in A.
   auriculiformis, B. nitida, and Z. mays. The decomposition and nutrient
   release half-lives of Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala,
   Azadirachta indica, and Senna spectabilis were less than 14 d. Soil
   mineral N, microbial biomass, and beta-glucosidase activity increased
   under all treatments, with T. diversifolia having the greatest effect.
   While N mineralization occurred in all of the species throughout the
   experiment, an initial N immobilization was recorded in the A. zygia, B.
   nitida, A. auriculiformis, and Z. mays treatments for up to 14 d.
   Decomposition and nutrient release rates, mineral N, soil microbial
   biomass, and beta-glucosidase activity were dependent on residue
   quality, and P and lignin levels, the lignin/N ratio, and the (lignin +
   polyphenol)/N ratio had the most significant effects (P <= 0.05).},

Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to assess effects of condensed tannins
   (CT) from tropical forage crops on Haemonchus contortus burdens, feed
   intakes and body weights of experimentally infected Mongolian gerbils
   (Meriones unguiculatus) and Pelibuey lambs. Forty weaned gerbils were
   assigned to 10 treatments with four replicates. Gerbils of treatments
   2-10 were orally fed 1000 exsheathed larvae and two levels (7.5 and 15
   mg/kg body weight, BW) of purified CT from Arachis pintoi, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Manihot esculenta or Albendazol. Nine days after oral
   infection, gerbils were killed and the number of larvae in the stomach
   was determined. There were effects on stomach larvae counts (P < 0.05)
   with the highest average count (135 larvae) occurring in the untreated
   control (P < 0.05) and the L-4 larvae (i.e., developing in intestinal
   submucosa phase) was lowest (18, 17 and 16 larvae) for gerbils receiving
   extracts from L. leucocephala, A. pintoi and M. esculenta, respectively.
   The uninfected control, and the Albendazol-treated groups, had
   practically no larvae. In the second experiment, fifty-two 45-day old
   Pelibuey lambs were randomly assigned to nine treatments: an uninfected
   control, or fed either Medicago sativa and/or three tannin containing
   forages (i.e., A. pintoi, Gliricidia sepium, M. esculenta), and an
   Albendazol-treated group. Treatments 2-9 were artificially infected with
   5000 exsheathed L-3 larvae (i.e., infective phase). Lambs were killed 36
   days after infection and the number of parasites in the abomasum was
   quantified. In lambs on the test diets, the number of larvae were
   decreased (P < 0.05) by up to 70\% compared to the untreated control
   (3801 larvae). Lambs consumed from 0.5 to 4.9 g/kg BW/day of CT. In
   neither of the experiment was feed intake or BW adversely affected by
   administration of CT. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Pigeon pea for fallow improvement in slash-and-burn systems in the hills
   of Laos?},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {39},

Pages = {45-57},
Abstract = {Slash-and-burn farmers in the hills of Laos urgently need techniques
   that can sustain rice yields and reduce weed pressure under short fallow
   periods. For this, the potential of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth)
   as a fallow crop was evaluated in variety, establishment, and cropping
   systems studies conducted at Houay Khot station (19 degrees N) from 1992
   to 1995. Introduced perennial varieties were not superior to local
   material for the parameters evaluated. Some semi-perennial varieties
   produced grain yields up to 2.2 t ha(-1) but were inferior in weed
   suppression and survival 12 months after planting. All varieties lost
   much of their weed competitiveness after the first picking of pods. In
   studies without weeding, < 10\% initially established plants were
   present 15 months after planting. Compared with pigeon pea, Gliricidia
   sepium and Leucaena leucocephala performed better in biomass production,
   weed suppression, persistence, and self-regeneration after cultivation
   of rice. In a rotation study, rice yield was 1.3, 1.5, 2.3, 1.6, 1.8,
   1.8, and 2.2 t ha(-1) (LSD 5\% = 0.5 t) for continuous rice, rice-pigeon
   pea intercropping, rice after pigeon pea, rice after cowpea, rice after
   Stylosanthes hamata, rice after maize, and rice after fallow,
   respectively. Compared with continuous rice, intercropping or rotation
   with pigeon pea reduced nematode (Meloidogyne graminicola) infestation
   of rice and weed biomass in the rice crop. In spite of the beneficial
   effects, rotation or intercropping systems with pigeon pea will only be
   viable if economic benefits from harvested grain or from using plant
   parts as livestock feed can be obtained. Because of high mortality and
   weed invasion pigeon pea is not suitable for fallow improvement if
   fallow duration is more than one year.},

Abstract = {The growth of the tree legumes Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium,
   Sesbania sesban, Sesbania grandiflora, Albizia falcataria and Calliandra
   calothyrsus was evaluated at four sites in Indonesia between 1984 and
   1986. Tree seedlings were planted at 10000 trees/ha and, after an
   establishment period of 9-12 months, harvested every 3 months for a
   2-year period.
   At Bambu Apus, West Java (2040 mm annual rainfall, 1 month dry period,
   lowland, latosol with pH 5.6 decreasing with depth), G. sepium and C.
   calothyrsus produced 13 and 10 t/ha per year of leaf dry matter,
   respectively. Other species did not grow well at this site and fewer
   than 60\% of the trees of these species survived until the end of the
   experimental period. At Sei Putih, North Sumatra (1550 mm annual
   rainfall, 3 months dry period, lowland, podzolic with pH 5.5 increasing
   with depth), no species produced > 6 t/ha per year of leaf dry matter.
   The highest yielding species were L. leucocephala and A. falcataria. At
   Cisarua, West Java (3340 mm annual rainfall, no dry periods, 925 m
   altitude, latosol with pH 5.6 increasing with depth) only C. calothyrsus
   grew well and produced 9 t/ha per year of leaf dry matter. At Grati,
   East Java (1500 mm annual rainfall, 6 months dry period, lowland,
   alluvial with pH 6.6 increasing with depth) L. leucocephala produced > 8
   t/ha per year of leaf dry matter, while none of the C. calothyrsus and
   A. falcataria trees survived the first dry season.
   Although L. leucocephala has been the most widely grown tree legume
   species in the tropics, C. calothyrsus and G. sepium performed better at
   the wetter sites and at high altitude.},

Abstract = {Litterfall, decomposition, and nutrient release to the soil are
   important biogeochemical cycling processes in agroecosystems. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of decomposition
   and nutrient release of the leaves of four tree legumes with
   agroforestry potential: Piscidia piscipula, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena
   leucocephala, and Lysiloma latisiliquum, common in the areas with
   natural regeneration after the abandonment of agriculture in
   south-eastern Mexico. We employed 112 litterbags with 40 g of dry leaf
   litter on ground surface for decomposition and recollected seven bags
   per species at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. The initial and recollected
   samples were oven-dried, and weighed to determine the remaining dry mass
   (DM), organic matter (OM), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) content, and the C:N
   ratio. The initial OM and N contents of L. leucocephala leaves were
   greater, compared to the rest of the legumes. P. piscidia and G. sepium
   showed the highest C content. P. piscidia, G. sepium, and L.
   latisiliquum had the highest C:N ratio, compared to L. leucocephala. The
   relative decomposition rate k values of DM, OM, C, and N were greater
   for L. leucocephala. The remaining DM, OM, C, and N were affected by the
   interaction between species and decomposition time. G. sepium and L.
   latisiliquum showed greater remaining mass from 30 to 60 days of
   decomposition. However, after 60 days L. latisiliquum showed the
   greatest remaining DM and OM until the end of the incubation period (120
   days). We conclude that L. leucocephala had the highest rate of
   decomposition and the fastest release of nitrogen, however, the
   asynchronous pattern of litter decomposition among the tree legumes
   showed the potential to supply OM and nutrients to the soil for a
   prolonged period if planted in combination in agroforestry systems.},

Abstract = {Forage legumes are commonly used as an absorbent additive in
   high-moisture silages. Thus this study was carried out to assess the
   nutritive value, fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability of
   Opuntia-legume browse mixed silages. Five browse legume species
   (Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia mellifera, Searsia lancea, Prosopis
   velutina, and Grewia flava) were mixed with Opuntia cladodes. The silage
   mixture was formulated at a ratio of 60 Opuntia cladodes: 40 leguminous
   browse species and ensiled in polythene bags and kept in a laboratory
   for 42 days to determine chemical composition and fermentation
   characteristics. Silage samples were also subjected to an aerobic
   stability test. One-way analysis of variance in a completely randomised
   design was used to analyse the data. The pH values for silages made from
   Opuntia cladodes with L. leucocephala, A. mellifera and G. flava were
   lower than 4.8, which is considered an indicator of good-quality silage.
   The water-soluble carbohydrates content of silages made with Opuntia
   cladodes and S. lancea and G. flava was within the range of 8-12 g/kg
   dry matter, which is sufficient for good fermentation. The highest CO(2
   )production, which signifies poor aerobic stability, was recorded for
   the control silage (Opuntia) compared to all Opuntia-legume mixed silage
   treatments. The addition of legume browse leaf-meal to Opuntia cladodes
   improved nutritive value, fermentation characteristics, and silage
   quality. Therefore, despite some limitations, Opuntia-legume browse
   silages, particularly Opuntia-G. flava and Opuntia-L. leucocephala,
   proved to be beneficial for livestock, as they meet the nutritional
   requirement of a ruminant.
   Significance:
   This study underlines the importance of co-ensiling Opuntia cladodes and
   high protein legume browse hay to offer an alternative feeding strategy
   for ruminant livestock and ensure sustainable provision of high-quality
   feed during dry periods.},

Abstract = {The present study was conducted to assess the supplementary effect of
   tropical browse species leaves on feed intake, nutrients utilization,
   rumen metabolites and water kinetics of goats fed Dichanthium annulatum
   grass based diets. In an experiment 4 adult male local goats, weighing
   30.0 +/- 2.1 kg, were fed Dichanthium annulatum-Hardwickia binata
   (DA-HB), Dichanthium annulatum-Securegeia virosa (DA-SV), Dichanthium
   annulatum-Leucaena leucocephala (DA-LL) and Dichanthium
   annulatum-Helectris isora (DA-HI) grass: tree leaves diets in 50: 50

   and 90 days of feeding to estimate rumen metabolites, while for water
   kinetics rumen liquor was drawn once at 90 days of feeding from an
   individual goat in each trial. DMI of goats was highest on DA-HI and
   lowest on DA-HB diet. Goats exhibited higher digestibility of CP, NDF,
   ADF and cellulose on DA-HI than other diets. Faecal N loss was higher
   from DA-LL, while urinary N loss was more from DA-HI and DA-LL. N
   balance (g/d) was highest in DA-LL and lowest in DA-HB. Goats had higher
   eating rate at first and fourth hour of feeding on tested diets, while
   meal consumption was highest on DA-LL and lowest on DA-HB diet. Goat
   rumen liquor had higher TVFA and N metabolites on DA-LL. Goats exhibited
   higher dilution rate and out flow rate on DA-HI and DA-LL diets than
   DA-SV and DA-HB diets. Results revealed that goats had higher DMI and

Title = {Quantitative Evaluation of Allelopathic Potentials in Soils: Total
   Activity Approach},
Journal = {WEED SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {258-264},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {The allelopathic potential of a plant has been evaluated on the basis of
   two indicators: specific activity, which is the specific concentration
   of the allelochemical to exert a half-maximum effect on a receiver plant
   (EC50), and total activity in a plant, which is the ratio of the
   concentration of an allelochemical in the producing plant to its EC50.
   In the present study, a new indicator, total activity in a soil, which
   takes into account the effects of a soil on the allelopathy activity, is
   proposed because allelopathic activity is affected by the presence of
   soils. The total activity in a soil was calculated by multiplying the
   ``total activity in a plant{''} with a ``soil factor.{''} In this
   calculation, we assumed simplified cases for comparison, such that the
   allelopathic plant materials are evenly incorporated in the soils and
   the allelochemicals are released from the plant materials to the soils
   at a constant rate. We conducted bioassay experiments in the presence
   and absence of soils and cited some published data to calculate the
   specific activities and total activities in a plant and in a soil. The
   results indicated that the allelopathies of buckwheat caused by
   (+)-catechin, Leucaena leucocephala by L-mimosine, Xanthium occidentale
   by transcinnamic acid, and Brassica parachinensis by cis-cinnamic acid
   were not significant in a volcanic ash soil, an alluvial soil, and a
   calcareous soil, but the allelopathy of sweet vernalgrass caused by
   coumarin and Spiraea thunbergii by cis-cinnamoyl glucosides was highly
   effective in those soils. The allelopathies of Juglans species caused by
   juglone plus juglone precursors and Mucuna pruriens by L-DOPA would
   depend highly on the soil types. Although some limitations exist for
   this approach, the total activity approach would allow for a better
   quantitative estimation of the allelopathic potential of plant materials
   in soils.},

Abstract = {The natural rhizobial populations of Calliandra calothyrsus , Gliricidia
   sepium , Leucaena leucocephala and Sesbania sesban were assessed in
   soils from nine sites across tropical areas of three continents. The
   rhizobial population size varied from undetectable numbers to 1.8 x
   10(4) cells/g of soil depending on the trap host and the soil.
   Calliandra calothyrsus was the most promiscuous legume, nodulating in
   eight soils, while S. sesban nodulated in only one of the soils.
   Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism
   (PCR-RFLP) analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and the internally transcribed
   spacer (ITS) region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes were used to
   assess the diversity and relative abundance of rhizobia trapped from
   seven of the soils by C. calothyrsus , G. sepium and L. leucocephala .
   Representatives of the 16S rRNA RFLP groups were also subjected to
   sequence analysis of the first 950 base pairs of the 16S rRNA gene.
   Eighty ITS groups were obtained, with none of the ITS types being
   sampled in more than one soil. RFLP analysis of the 16S rRNA yielded 23
   `species' groups distributed among the Rhizobium , Mesorhizobium ,
   Sinorhizobium and Agrobacterium branches of the rhizobial phylogenetic
   tree. The phylogeny of the isolates was independent of the site or host
   of isolation, with different rhizobial groups associated with each host
   across the soils from widely separated geographical regions. Although
   rhizobial populations in soils sampled from the centre of diversity of
   the host legumes were the most genetically diverse, soil acidity was
   highly correlated with the diversity of ITS types. Our results support
   the hypothesis that the success of these tree legumes in soils
   throughout the tropics is the result of their relative promiscuity
   (permissiveness) allowing nodulation with diverse indigenous rhizobial
   types.},

Abstract = {In agroforestry, trees produce lot of litter the and the allelochemicals
   released from it influence the companion/understorey crops, however, its
   influence varies with the tree crop combinations. Pigeonpea was found
   least susceptible and sesame the most sensitive to the bark leachates of
   acacia, casuarina, dalbergia, eucalyptus and tectona. Acacia nilotica
   reduces shoot biomass of wheat, berseem, chickpea and cotton.
   Pearlmillet grown with Acacia tortilis showed only 12\% germination at 5
   m distance from the tree and germination was enhanced to 78 and 92\% at
   10 and 15 m distance. A.nilotica had a greater depression effect on
   pearlmillet than clusterbean. Plant and soil extracts of A.nilotica and
   Cassia siamea inhibited the nodulation and N fixation of clusterbean (
   Cyamopsis tetragonoloba ). Contrarily dried leaves of glyricidia
   promoted the growth of tomato seedlings and the productivity of
   pigeonpea, sesame, castor and sorghum was increased under leuceana trees
   and that of sorghum, under eucalyptus. Leaf extracts of tectona, Albizia
   procera and Acacia nilotica showed stimulatory effects on germination,
   growth, chlorophyll, protein, carbohydrate and proline content of
   soybean.
   The trees in association with rice, fingermillet (Eleusine coracana) and
   Echinochloa frumantacea increased organic carbon by three times,
   available P and K status significantly in soils. Eucalyptus in
   association with legumes enhanced the organic carbon, total N, mineral N
   and exchangeable cation and available P in soils. The dehydrogenase
   activity in soil under tree species was in the order of Leuceana
   leucocephala < acacia < eucalyptus. The population of bacteria, fungi
   and azotobacter increased under Bambusa bambos, Casurina eguisetifolia,
   Ceiba pentandra, Eucalyptus tereticornis, Leucaena leucocephala, Tectona
   grandis.
   Therefore, to improve the productivity of agroforestry systems, it is
   essential to determine the allelopathic compatibility of crops with
   trees.},

   infection threads can rapidly multiply. To explore the effects on
   symbiosis of a slower rhizobia growth and metabolism, we deleted one or
   two copies of the three functional rRNA operons of the promiscuous
   Sinorhizobium fredii strain NGR234 and examined the impact of these
   mutations on free-living and symbiotic lifestyles. Strains with two
   functional rRNA operons (NGR Delta rRNA1 and NGR Delta rRNA3) grew
   almost as rapidly as NGR234, and NGR Delta rRNA1 was as proficient as
   the parent strain on all of the five legume species tested. By contrast,
   the NGR Delta rRNA1,3 double mutant, which carried a single rRNA operon
   and grew significantly slower than NGR234, had a reduced symbiotic
   proficiency on Cajanus cajan, Macroptilium atropurpureum, Tephrosia
   vogelii, and Vigna unguiculata. In addition, while NGR Delta rRNA1 and
   NGR234 equally competed for nodulation of V. unguiculata, strain NGR
   Delta rRNA1,3 was clearly outcompeted by wild-type. Surprisingly, on
   Leucaena leucocephala, NGR Delta rRNA1,3 was the most proficient strain
   and competed equally NGR234 for nodule occupation. Together, these
   results indicate that for strains with otherwise identical repertoires
   of symbiotic genes, a faster growth on roots and/or inside plant tissues
   may contribute to secure access to nodules of some hosts. By contrast,
   other legumes such as L. leucocephala appear as less selective and
   capable of providing symbiotic environments susceptible to accommodate
   strains with a broader spectrum of competences.},

Abstract = {One hundred and sixty isolates of rhizobia were sampled from the root
   nodules of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivated in Tunisian
   soil samples originating from three geographically distinct fields.
   Plasmid profiling was used as a primary method to rapidly screen the
   isolates, and then 38 plasmid types were recorded among the 160
   isolates. A sample representing the majority of plasmid types was chosen
   for further characterization by restriction fragment length polymorphism
   (RFLP) analysis of genomic DNA using chromosomal and symbiotic gene
   probes, and by their ability to nodulate a potential alternative host,
   Leucaena leucocephala. One third of the isolates showed a high
   similarity to Rhizobium gallicum isolated from common bean in France,
   another third showed the same characteristics as the R. etli-R.
   leguminosarum group, while the remaining isolates could not be related
   to any of the five species nodulating bean. When reexamined for
   nodulation, some of these isolates, showing similarities to R. tropici
   and Agrobacterium with respect to colony morphology and growth in
   different media, failed to nodulate their original host. The R.
   gallicum-like isolates, R, etli-like isolates, and R. leguminosarum-like
   isolates were recovered from regions where bean is frequently grown,
   while in fields which had not been cultivated with beans for at least
   the 10 previous years, solely unrecognized taxa of ineffective isolates
   were recovered. We detected variations in the symbiotic regions, but
   certain pSym RFLP patterns for nifH were conserved between Tunisian,
   French, and Austrian populations of bean rhizobia. Evaluation of sym
   biotic effectiveness showed that R. gallicum-like isolates and R.
   etli-like isolates were effective, whereas some R. leguminosarum-like
   isolates were ineffective. Furthermore, effective isolates were also
   found among the unrecognized taxa.},

Abstract = {Soil fertility problems associated with soil acidity in the humid
   tropics were identified by observing variations of some
   growth-controlling factors along response curves. Data for these curves
   were generated by liming an Oxisol and an Ultisol of Hawaii {[}USA] so
   that pH increased progressively, from < 5 to > 7. Legumes were grown
   across the pH gradients. Liming the Oxisol depressed Al concentration in
   the pH range 4.8 to 5.5 and Mn in the pH range 4.8 to 5.7. Liming did
   not change solution  Ca until pH 5.7 was reached, after which, solution
   Ca contents of saturation extracts increased exponentially. The
   beneficial effects of liming Leucaena leucocephala were linear from pH
   4.8 to 7.0. Soybean (Glycine max L.) yields increased abruptly at
   approximately pH 5.9 which corresponded to increased Ca concentration in
   soil saturation extracts. Indigenous soil microvariability in the humid
   tropics, although sometimes disastrous to conventional field plot
   experimentation, provides  opportunities for investigating soil-plant
   relations in ways that are difficult to duplicate by design. Such
   variability made possible an indigenous-function investigation using
   soybeans growing on an Alfisol of Nigeria. Increasing yield with
   increasing soil pH of the Alfisol was associated with increased N
   fixation, and this with decreased Mn in the foliage. Predicted N yield
   was zero at approximately 600 mg Mn kg-1 leaf tissue. Vigorous soybean
   plants contained 1.5\% leaf K, which was  associated with at least 0.25
   cmol K kg-1 soil. Exchangeable K was postively correlated with cation
   exchange capacity, and cation exchange capacity with soil pH. Results of
   this study demonstrate the complex relationships that exist between soil
   pH and crop nutrition in the humid tropics. It is unlikely that such
   complex relationships can be covered by simple unqualified statements
   about liming such soils.},

Abstract = {Hot arid zones represent vital reservoirs of unique species and
   ecosystems, holding significant importance for biodiversity. This study
   aimed to explore the plant diversity associated with tree plantations in
   urban ecosystems under hyper-arid climatic conditions in the Sahara
   Desert of Algeria. In May 2022, 30 quadrats measuring 1 m2 each were
   established at the base of Phoenix dactylifera, Leucaena leucocephala,
   and Tamarix aphylla, corresponding to the dominant tree species in each
   of three plantations. In each quadrat, the plant quantitative inventory
   was conducted to measure plant diversity and similarity among the
   studied plantations. Based on this, we assessed the plant functional
   traits and rarity/abundance status of the flora. The findings revealed a
   diverse flora associated with the studied plantations, comprising 29
   plant species grouped into 27 genera and 12 families. Notably, Poaceae
   (accounting for 30.8\% of the flora), Asteraceae (25.0\%), and
   Zygophyllaceae (21.6\%) were well-represented. With an overall density
   of approximately 555 individuals/m2, Zygophyllum album (120
   individuals/m2) and Polypogon monspeliensis (87 individuals/m2) emerged
   as the most abundant species. Functional trait analysis underscored the
   pivotal role of therophytes (constituting over 50.0\% of the flora) and
   anemochorous species (33.0\%-62.5\%). Phytogeographic analysis
   emphasized the prevalence of the Saharo-Arabic element (constituting
   over 31.0\% of the flora) and the Mediterranean Saharo-Arabic element
   (9.5\%-21.5\%). The Cosmopolitan element thrived under disturbance
   factors, recording percentages from 13.0\% to 20.0\% of the plant
   community. The rarity/abundance status of the flora emphasized the
   significance of rare, common, and very common species in the studied
   plantations. These findings could provide fundamental data for the
   effective control and management of biodiversity in hot hyper-arid urban
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Methane Emissions from Ruminant Livestock in Ethiopia: Promising Forage
   Species to Reduce CH4 Emissions},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},

Abstract = {This paper assesses the ability of fodder plants to reduce methane (CH4)
   emissions while simultaneously improving animal productivity in
   Ethiopia. Enteric CH4 emissions from ruminants in Ethiopia increased by
   12\% or approximate to 6197 Gg CO2-eq. in 2017 compared to the year
   2011. In this study, six tropical multipurpose forages (Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, Moringa stenopetala (Bak.f.) Cuf., Sesbania
   sesban (L.) Merr., Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp., Crotalaria juncea L., and
   Lablab purpureus L.(Sweet)) and maize stover were characterized in terms
   of chemical composition, in vitro CH4 production, and CH4 concentration
   (\%). The objective was to identify forages with low CH4 production
   potential but with adequate forage quality. The forages differed
   significantly in chemical composition and in enteric CH4 emission. The
   dry matter (DM), ash, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF),
   acid detergent fibre (ADF), and acid detergent lignin (ADL) ranged
   between 89.4-95.4\%, 6.08-12.5\%, 3.3-30.7\%, 20.4-76.0\%, 10.8-44.8,
   and 2.9-14.1\%, respectively. All forage plants, except maize stover,
   contained high CP content above a threshold value (i.e., 7\%). Cajanus
   c. generates the lowest amount of CH4 (32.83 mL/0.2 g DM incubated). CH4
   concentration (\%) was used as a potential indicator to determine the
   capacity of a plant to lower CH4 production. Among the studied species,
   L. purpureus showed the highest CH4 reduction potential (16\%) followed
   by C. juncea (23.45\%), M. stenopetala (24.2\%), and L. leucocephala
   (25.5\%). M. stenopetala was the most frequently preferred by the
   farmers followed by C. juncea and L. leucocephala. We concluded that M.
   stenopetala, C. juncea, and L. leucocephala can be promoted as valuable
   feed resources for ruminants while simultaneously reducing CH4
   emissions.},

Abstract = {Biological nitrogen fixation, performed by diazotrophic bacteria, plays
   an important role in the maintenance of agricultural systems, as it
   contributes with significant amounts of the nitrogen (N) needed for
   plant growth, totally or partially exempting the use of industrial N
   fertilisers. Twenty-five bacterial strains isolated from nodules of
   Leucaena leucocephala and Phaseolus vulgaris trap plants were studied.
   These nodules were formed after inoculation with suspensions of soil
   samples collected close to the root system of Sesbania virgata. In
   previous studies, these bacteria were identified as Cupriavidus necator.
   This study aimed to evaluate the ability of these strains to fix N-2 in
   the free-living state and to use carbon (C) sources; their resistance to
   antibiotics; growth in media with different pH values and salt
   concentrations and symbiotic efficiency with L. leucocephala and P.
   vulgaris. In each test, these strains were compared to C. taiwanensis
   LMG 19424(T). Although a high variability regarding antibiotic
   resistance, salt tolerance and use of C sources were observed among the
   25 C. necator strains, a large group behaved similar regarding salt
   tolerance (20 strains) and antibiotic resistance (22 strains). C.
   necator strains behaved in a different way of LMG 19424(T). Only one of
   the 25 strains studied, UFLA02-69, was not able to establish symbiosis
   with its trap species, P. vulgaris. Only the strains LMG19424(T) and
   UFLA01-672 were efficient in symbiosis with L. leucocephala. The ability
   to use C sources, grow in different pHs and salt concentrations and
   resistance to several antibiotics, may grant high saprophytic competence
   and greater competitivity to these strains in relation to the native
   Leguminosae-nodulating bacterial populations, suggesting potential use
   in inoculant strain selection studies for legumes cultivated in soils
   with a wide range of pH and salt concentrations.},

Journal = {TROPICAL AGRICULTURE},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {71},

Pages = {66-70},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Twenty young intact Menz-type male sheep were assigned to four levels of
   leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv. Peru) supplementation to chick pea
   haulm fed ad libitum: 0 (treatment A), 100 (B), 200 (C), and 300 (D) g
   day(-1) head(-1). Water and mineral lick were offered free choice. Dry
   matter digestibility, intake, body weight gain, N balance, rumen ammonia
   concentration, and molar proportions of volatile fatty acids (VFA) were
   determined. Body weight gains increased from 59 to 87 g day(-1) with
   increased leucaena leaf supplementation. Digestibility increased by 7.0,
   6.6, and 9.6 percentage units over the control diet when leucaena was
   offered at levels of 100, 200, and 300 g head(-1) day(-1), respectively.
   The concentrations of ammonia with treatments C and D were consistently
   higher than 20 mg 100-ml(-1) of rumen fluid at all times, but this high
   ammonia level was observed with treatment B only at 4 h after feeding.
   The optimum VFA production time was delayed with more than 200 g of
   leucaena leaf and the total VFA production declined when more than 100 g
   was fed. However, the rate of protein and carbohydrate degradation
   seemed to be better synchronized in treatment B than in C and D. The
   rate of protein degradation was faster than carbohydrate with treatments
   C and D. The percentages of N retained were similar for the supplemented
   groups, despite differences in apparently absorbed N and in dietary N
   concentration. This suggests insufficient energy (glycogenic substances)
   supply for efficient retention of N in the rumen and at tissue level. It
   is suggested that split feeding of leucaena leaf hay at the 200-g and
   300-g levels might lead to more efficient utilization of chick pea
   haulm, or additional energy supplementation may be required at the
   higher levels of leucaena supplementation.},

Abstract = {Forage tree legumes benefit agriculture through their multi-purpose
   contributions to livestock feeding, to productivity of farming systems,
   and to protection of the environment.
   Of the several hundred forage tree legume species regarded as having
   potential for forage only c. twenty are in common use. These are listed
   together with their agroecological range and tolerance of adverse
   environments including acid soils, cool temperatures, low rainfall, poor
   drainage and high salinity. The value of many species to ruminants is
   limited due to low nutritive value arising from low protein availability
   and low acceptability caused principally by high condensed tannin
   content. Only 10 of the 20 listed species are considered to have a high
   nutritive value viz. Albizia lebbeck, Chamaecytisus palmensis, Cralylia
   argentea, Desmodium rensonii, Desmanthus virgatus, Gliricidia sepium,
   Leucaena leucocephala, Leucaena diversifolia, Sesbania grandiflora,and
   Sesbania sesban.
   The germplasm in commercial use worldwide is often inferior and with a
   narrow genetic base. The need for farmer access to a greater diversity
   of planting material and improved varieties through better distribution
   systems is highlighted. However, plant improvement is often limited due
   to taxonomic confusion in many genera e.g. Albizia, Prosopis, and farmer
   access to new varieties is limited by lack of information and lack of
   resources to purchase high quality seeds. There is debate over whether
   to use fast growing exotic species or slower growing native species.
   There are as many as 150-200 M people use Gliricidia sepium worldwide
   but there is minimal use in its native range. Conversely, native Acacia
   communities are over-exploited in their native range with minimal use
   elsewhere. Conservation of native range is critical and in situ, ex situ
   and circa situm approaches are suggested. Issues of weediness potential
   are paramount when using exotic species requiring greater care in the
   evaluation of risk factors.
   Finally, the reasons for successes and failures in promotion of forage
   tree legume use in world farming systems are analyzed and suggestions
   made to extend the utilization of this important group of legume
   species.},

Abstract = {Alley cropping is being widely tested in the tropics for its potential
   to sustain adequate food production with low agricultural inputs, while
   conserving the resource base. Fast growth and N yield of most trees used
   as hedgerows in alley cropping is due greatly to their ability to fix
   N-2 symbiotically with Rhizobium. Measurements of biological N-2
   fixation (BNF) in alley cropping systems show that some tree species
   such as Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium and Acacia mangium can
   derive between 100 and 300 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) from atmospheric N-2,
   while species such as Faidherbia albida and Acacia senegal might fix
   less than 20 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Other tree species such as Senna siamea
   and S. spectabilis are also used in alley cropping, although they do not
   nodulate and therefore do not fix N-2 The long-term evaluation of the
   potential or actual amounts of N-2 fixed in trees however, poses
   problems that are associated with their perennial nature and massive
   size, the great difficulty in obtaining representative samples and
   applying reliable methodologies for measuring N-2 fixed. Strategies for
   obtaining representative samples (as against the whole tree or
   destructive plant sampling), the application of N-15 procedures and the
   selection criteria for appropriate reference plants have been discussed.
   Little is known about the effect of environmental factors acid
   management practices such as tree cutting or pruning and residue
   management on BNF and eventually their N contribution in alley cropping.
   Data using the N-15 Labelling techniques have indicated that up to 50\%
   or more of the tree's N may be below ground after pruning. In this case,
   quantification of N-2 fixed that disregards roots, nodules and crowns
   would result in serious errors and the amount of N-2 fixed may be
   largely underestimated. Large quantities of N are harvested with
   hedgerow prunings (> 300 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) but N contribution to crops
   is commonly in the range of 40-70 kg N ha(-1) season. This represents
   about 30\% of N applied as prunings; however, N recoveries as low as
   5-10\% have been reported. The low N recovery in maize (Zea mays) is
   partly caused by lack of synchronization between the hedgerow trees N
   release and the associated food crop N demand. The N not taken up by the
   associated crop can be immobilized in soil organic matter or assimilated
   by the hedgerow trees and thus remain in the system. This N can also be
   lost from the system through denitrification, volatilization or is
   leached beyond the rooting zone. Below ground contribution (from root
   turnover and nodule decay) to an associated food crop in alley cropping
   is estimated at about 25-102 kg N ha(-1) season(-1). Timing and severity
   of pruning may allow for some management of underground transfer of
   fixed Na to associated crops. However many aspects of root dynamics in
   alley cropping systems are poorly understood. Current research projects
   based on N-15 labelling techniques or N-15 natural abundance
   measurements are outlined. These would lead to estimates of N-2 fixation
   and N saving resulting from the management of N-2 fixation in alley
   cropping systems.},

Abstract = {Desmanthus paspalaceus (Lindm.) Burkart belongs to the D. virgatus
   complex, subfamily Mimosoidae. The known potential as livestock fodder
   of several of these legumes prompted us to undertake a phenotypic,
   molecular, and symbiotic characterization of the D. paspalaceus
   symbionts in the Santa Fe province, Argentina. The rhizobia
   collected-containing isolates with different abiotic-stress
   tolerances-showed a remarkable genetic diversity by PCR fingerprinting,
   with 11 different amplification profiles present among 20 isolates. In
   selected isolates 16S-rDNA sequencing detected mesorhizobia (60\%) and
   rhizobia (40\%) within the collection, in contrast to the genus of the
   original inoculant strain CB3126-previously isolated from Leucaena
   leucocephala-that we typified here through its 16S rDNA as Sinorhizobium
   terangae. The results revealed the establishment by diverse bacterial
   genera -rhizobia, sinorhizobia, and mesorhizobia-of full N-2-fixing
   symbiotic associations with D. paspalaceus. This diversity was
   paralleled by the presence of at least two different nodC allelic
   variants. The identical nodC alleles of the Mesorhizobia sp. 10.L.4.2
   and 10.L.5.3 notably failed to group within any of the currently
   described rhizo-/brady-/azorhizobial nodC clades. Interestingly, the
   nodC from S. terangae CB3126 clustered close to homologs from common
   bean nodulating rhizobia, but not with the nodC from S. terangae WSM1721
   that nodulates Acacia. No previous data were available on nod-gene
   phylogeny for Desmanthus symbionts. A field assay indicated that
   inoculation of D. paspalaceus with the local Rhizobium sp. 10L.11.4
   produced higher aerial-plant dry weights compared to S. teranga
   CB3126-inoculated plants. Neither the mesorhizobia 10.L.4.2 or 10.L.5.3
   nor the rhizobium 10L.11.4 induced root nodules in L. leucocephala or P.
   vulgaris. The results show that some of the local isolates have
   remarkable tolerances to several abiotic stresses including acidity,
   salt, and temperature; while exhibiting prominent N-2 fixation; thus
   indicating suitability as candidates for inoculation of D. paspalaceus.},

Abstract = {Evaluation of soil aggregate stability under managed fallow systems is
   very relevant in the assessment of their agricultural sustainability. It
   is also important to identify the parameters that are most responsive to
   the effects of these fallow systems on aggregate stability. This study
   was carried out in southwestern Nigeria to quantify the effects of
   various fallow management systems on the macroaggregate stability of
   surface soil (0-15-cm depth) using a long-term fallow management trial
   established in 1989 on an Alfisol toposequence. Data were collected
   between 1994 and 1995. Three fallow systems (bush fallow, Pueraria
   phaseoloides, and Leucaena leucocephala) and three fallow periods (1-3
   years after 1-year cropping) were evaluated. Cropping consisted of maize
   + cassava intercropping. A split-plot design with fellow systems as main
   plot and cropping intensities as subplot in four replications was used
   in the trial. Soil aggregate samples were wet-sieved to evaluate their
   mean-weight diameter (MWD) and fractal dimension (D). The means of MWD
   for the fallow systems and cropping intensities ranged from 2.4 to 6.4
   mm. The mean D values ranged from 2.29 to 2.72 while the mean intercepts
   (log k) of the regression ranged from 2.01 to 2.28. Low D values
   (cohesive and stable aggregates) were associated with fallowing whereas
   high D values (fragmented aggregates) were associated with cultivation.
   Fallowing enhanced soil aggregate stability. The Pueraria system also
   enhanced soil aggregate stability more than the bush fallow and Leucaena
   systems when continuous cropping was practised. The subplots, which were
   fallowed for 2 or 3 years after 1 year of cropping, were usually similar
   in aggregate stability to the secondary forest soil. Fractal analysis
   showed further that soil aggregates in the dry season and on the upper
   slope of the toposequence were more cohesive than in the wet season and
   on the lower slope. Observed D and log k values were also significantly
   influenced by laboratory method. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {Harry Stobbs Memorial Lecture, 1994 - Potential and prospects of
   legume-based pastures in the tropics},
Journal = {TROPICAL GRASSLANDS},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {81-94},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper consists of two parts. First the N fixation, C storage and
   animal production of legume-based pastures are reviewed; then the
   adoption of pasture legume technology is discussed in terms of
   technical, biological and socio-economic constraints. Different forage
   production systems and their place in livestock production systems are
   described. The prospects for legume use in Australia, south-east Asia,
   Africa south of the Sahara and Latin America are discussed in relation
   to forage and animal production systems.
   Tropical legumes fix as much N as temperate ones. Measured amounts of N
   added to pasture systems range from 30-290 kg/ha/yr for herbaceous
   legumes in mixtures with grasses to 575 kg/ha/yr far a pure stand of
   Leucaena leucocephala. Soil N increments under tropical legumes were up
   to 140 kg/ha/yr in Australia and 128 kg/ha/yr in Costa Rica.
   Legume-based tropical pastures store more C than pure grass or native
   pastures. In Colombia, an improved grass-legume mixture had accumulated
   237 t/ha C to a depth of 1 m over 6 years compared with 186 t by a
   grass-only pasture.
   The highest cattle liveweight gain recorded from an irrigated pure stand
   of L. leucocephala was 2000 kg/ha/yr in the Kimberleys, Western
   Australia. On herbaceous legume-grass pastures the highest liveweight
   gain measured was 937 kg/ha/yr on Brachiaria brizantha - Arachis pintoi
   in the humid tropics of Costa Rica. Maximum milk production on tropical
   grass-legume pastures without concentrates is around 10-12 kg/cow/d.
   However, due to high carrying capacities, milk yields per ha of about
   8000 kg/ha/yr have been recorded in north Queensland and in Malaysia.
   There is reasonable adoption of legume-based technology in tropical
   Australia and parts of south-east Asia and Latin America. However, many
   countries, particularly in Africa, have such a low development status
   that problems related to land tenure, infrastructure and social justice
   need to be solved first.},

Title = {Assessment of antioxidant and antibacterial efficacy of some indigenous

Abstract = {The rapid dietary changes experienced by indigenous people worldwide
   threaten the use of traditional foods, which are often undervalued. This
   study focused on evaluating the antioxidant and antibacterial efficacy
   of five vegetables typically consumed by the Manipuri ethnic groups in
   the Sylhet region of Bangladesh: Yongchak seed (Parkia speciosa),
   Telikadam seed (Leucaena leucocephala), Phakphai leaf (Persicaria
   odorata), Sheuli leaf (Nyctanthes arbor-tristis), and bamboo shoot
   (Bambusa spp.). The samples were dried and powdered to assess the
   antioxidant activity through total phenolic content (TPC), total
   flavonoid content (TFC), total tannin content (TTC), and
   2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity.
   Antibacterial efficacy was determined by measuring the zone of
   inhibition (ZOI), minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum
   bactericidal concentration (MBC). Leafy vegetables exhibited higher TPC,
   TFC, and TTC than seeds and shoots, with N. arbor-tristis leaf showing
   the highest TPC (99.16 +/- 2.07 mg GAE/g DW) and P. odorata leaf
   exhibiting the highest TFC (9.19 +/- 0.7 mg QE/g) and TTC (3.59 +/- 0.26
   mg TAE/g). However, Bambusa spp. shoot extract showed the highest
   antioxidant potential (IC50: 1.66 +/- 0.05 mg/mL). All samples exhibited
   higher ZOI against gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus spp. and
   Staphylococcus spp.), ranging from 10 +/- 2.65 to 19.33 +/- 2.08 mm. L.
   leucocephala seed extract showed the highest antibacterial activity
   against both the tested gram-positive bacteria with a MIC of 15.6 mg/mL.
   Conversely, the P. odorata leaf extract exerted the strongest
   antibacterial effect against gram-negative bacteria, with the lowest MIC
   values for Klebsiella spp. (31.25 mg/mL) and Escheria coli (62.5 mg/mL).
   The findings of this investigation suggest that the selected indigenous
   vegetables could be valuable sources of phytochemicals with potential
   antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Incorporating and promoting
   these traditional foods into the diet may improve food security, dietary
   diversity, and public health in Bangladesh.},

Title = {Soil greenhouse gas emissions from different land utilization types in
   Western Kenya},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SOIL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {IntroductionThere is a vast data gap for the national and regional
   greenhouse gas (GHG) budget from different smallholder land utilization
   types in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) at large. Quantifying soil
   GHG, i.e., methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O)
   emissions from smallholder land utilization types, is essential in
   filling the data gap.MethodsWe quantified soil GHG emissions from
   different land utilization types in Western Kenya. We conducted a
   26-soil GHG sampling campaign from the different land utilization types.
   The five land utilization types include 1) agroforestry M (agroforestry
   Markhamia lutea and sorghum), 2) sole sorghum (sorghum monocrop), 3)
   agroforestry L (Sorghum and Leucaena leucocephala), 4) sole maize (maize
   monocrop), and 5) grazing land.Results and discussionThe soil GHG fluxes
   varied across the land utilization types for all three GHGs (p <=
   0.0001). We observed the lowest CH4 uptake under grazing land (-0.35 kg
   CH4-C ha-1) and the highest under sole maize (-1.05 kg CH4-C ha-1). We
   recorded the lowest soil CO2 emissions under sole maize at 6,509.86 kg
   CO2-Cha-1 and the highest under grazing land at 14,400.75 kg CO2-Cha-1.
   The results showed the lowest soil N2O fluxes under grazing land at 0.69
   kg N2O-N ha-1 and the highest under agroforestry L at 2.48 kg N2O-N
   ha-1. The main drivers of soil GHG fluxes were soil bulk density, soil
   organic carbon, soil moisture, clay content, and root production. The
   yield-scale N2O fluxes ranged from 0.35 g N2O-N kg-1 under sole maize to
   4.90 g N2O-N kg-1 grain yields under agroforestry L. Nevertheless, our
   findings on the influence of land utilization types on soil GHG fluxes
   and yield-scaled N2O emissions are within previous studies in SSA,
   including Kenya, thus fundamental in filling the national and regional
   data of emissions budget. The findings are pivotal to policymakers in
   developing low-carbon development across land utilization types for
   smallholders farming systems.},

Abstract = {Microbial biomass, beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase activities,
   and availability, storage, and age of soil organic C were investigated
   after 26 years of conversion from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) to
   forest (Eucaliptus robusta or Leucaena leucocephala), pasture (mixture
   of tropical grasses), and to vegetable cropping (agriculture) in a
   vertisol in Puerto Rico. Soil organic C (SOC) at 0-100 cm was similar
   under Leucaena (22.8 kg C/m(2)), Eucalyptus (18.6 kg C/m(2)), and
   pasture (17.2 kg C/m(2)), which were higher than under agriculture (13.0
   kg C/m(2)). Soil organic N (SON) at 0-100 cm was similar under the land
   uses evaluated which ranged from 1.70 (under agriculture) to 2.28 kg
   N/m(2) (under Leucaena forest). Microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN) of
   the 0-15-cm soil layer could be ranked as: pasture > Leucaena =
   Eucalyptus > agriculture. The percentages of SOC and SON present as MBC
   and MBN, respectively, were nearly 1\% in pasture and less than 0.50\%
   in forest under Leucaena or Eucalyptus and agricultural soil. The
   activity of beta-glucosidase of the 0-15-cm soil layer could be ranked
   as: Leucaena = Eucalyptus > pasture > agriculture; while
   beta-glucosaminidase activity was ranked as: Eucalyptus > Leucaena =
   pasture > agriculture. The soil delta C-13 changed from 1996 to 2006 in
   forest under Eucalyptus (18.7aEuro degrees to 21.2aEuro degrees), but
   not under Leucaena (20.7aEuro degrees to 20.8aEuro degrees). The soil
   under Leucaena preserved a greater proportion of old C compared to the
   forest under Eucalyptus; the former had an increased soil mineralizable
   C from the current vegetation inputs. The soil under agriculture had the
   lowest enzyme activities associated with C cycling, lowest percentage of
   SOC as MBC, highest percentage of SOC present as mineralizable C, and
   highest percentage of MBC present as mineralizable C compared to the
   other land uses.},

Abstract = {The expediency of replacing cost prohibitive and often inaccessible
   traditional protein supplements prompted the current investigation of
   blood biochemical profile and rumen fermentation pattern in local female
   goats (12) and rumen fistulated bucks (3), respectively fed supplements
   containing either a leaf meal mixture (LMTM) of Leucaena
   leucocephala-Morus alba-Tectona grandis (2:1:1) or traditional protein
   supplements groundnut cake (GNC) or soybean meal (SBM) and wheat straw
   as basal diet. The periodic monitoring of hematological parameters was
   carried out in female goats at 0, 30, 60 and 90 days post feeding. Rumen
   environment was studied in bucks in a 3x3 switch over design. Rumen
   liquor was collected at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post feeding after 4 weeks of
   feeding. The goats fed on LMTM or GNC had similar dry matter intake
   (g/kg W-0.75), which was significantly (p<0.05) higher than SBM. Except
   for packed cell volume (PCV), none of the blood biochemical constituents
   (Hemoglobin, serum glucose, total protein, serum albumin (A) and
   globulin(G), A:G ratio, alkaline phosphatase, transaminases) varied
   significantly due to replacement of 50\% dietary protein by LMTM
   throughout the experiment. GNC group had significantly higher level of
   PCV than other treatments. However, the level of serum total protein
   (p<0.01) tended to increase from 60th day onwards irrespective of
   dietary treatments. The average rumen pH was significantly higher
   (p<0.001) on SBM followed by LMTM and GNC, respectively. Total volatile
   fatty acid (TVFA) production was comparable in goats given LMTM or GNC
   supplements, the corresponding values were significantly different
   (p<0.001) when compared with SBM. The ammonical-N, total-N and
   TCA-precipitable-N (mg/100 ml SRL) did not differ significantly among
   dietary treatments. It may be concluded that supplementing wheat straw
   with LMTM based concentrate had no adverse effect on voluntary intake,
   blood biochemical profile and rumen fermentation pattern of the goats.},

Abstract = {Two village surveys were carried out in six villages in southwestern
   Nigeria to assess goat feeding under traditional management ranging from
   free roaming to permanent confinement. Three of the villages are located
   in the lowland rainforest zone (FZ) and three in transition between FZ
   and the derived savannah (TZ). Cassava products (tuber and peel) and
   maize offal (a by-product from local maize processing) were the most
   frequently used feeds. In FZ, breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) was also
   important. There were more feeds in FZ than in TZ. DM digestibilities of
   the most frequently used feeds were: cassava: 89+/-2 (\%+/-SE);
   breadfruit: 88+/-2 and maize offal: 75+/-1. Of these feeds only maize
   offal had a high CP content (19\%). Under free roaming, considerable
   amounts of feed were given (29-49 g kg(-0.75) day(-1)); however, CP
   content was low (7-10\%). The animals may have balanced their diet
   through scavenging and browsing. Larger amounts were offered to
   permanently confined stock (70 g kg(-0.75) day(-1)), but CP content was
   low (10\%); this may have limited weight gain. Some feeds frequently
   reported to be fed did not contribute much quantitatively. This shows
   that care must be taken when quantitatively interpreting the results of
   a qualitative survey. It is concluded that Gliricidia sepium and
   Leucaena leucocephala could replace maize offal and/or increase the
   total amount of feed offered per animal. Suitability appeared to depend
   on the labour needed to harvest and feed browse, cost of maize offal and
   value of the extra production. Within the socio-economic setting ct thr
   time of !he survey, feeding small amounts of browse to balance
   protein-deficient diets seemed the most attractive option. Feeding
   larger amounts of browse or using browse to replace maize offal seems to
   be feasible only if harvesting and feeding can be combined with other
   on-farm activities.},

Abstract = {This study presents the first results from Brazil using SF6 tracer

   caesalpiniaefolia Benth (MIM) to reduce enteric CH4 production in Santa
   Ins sheep. Twelve male lambs {[}27.88 +/- 2.85 kg body weight (BW)] were
   allocated in individual metabolic cages for 20-day adaptation followed
   by 6 days for measuring dry matter intake (DMI) and CH4 emission. All
   lambs received water, mineral supplement, and Cynodon dactylon v.
   coast-cross hay ad libitum. The treatments consisted of soybean meal
   (710 g/kg) and ground corn (290 g/kg) {[}control (CON)]; soybean meal
   (150 g/kg), ground corn (30 g/kg), and Leucaena hay (820 g/kg) (LEU);
   soybean meal (160 g/kg), ground corn (150 g/kg), and Mucuna hay (690
   g/kg) (STA); and soybean meal (280 g/kg), ground corn (190 g/kg), and
   Mimosa hay (530 g/kg) (MIM); all calculated to provide 40 g/kg CT
   (except for CON). DMI (in grams of DMI per kilogram BW per day) was
   lower for LEU (22.0) than CON (29.3), STA (31.2), and MIM (31.6). The
   LEU group showed emission of 7.8 g CH4/day, significantly lower than CON
   (10.5 g CH4/day), STA (10.4 g CH4/day), and MIM (11.3 g CH4/day).
   However, when the CH4 emission per DMI was considered, there were no
   significant differences among treatments (0.37, 0.36, 0.33, and 0.35 g
   CH4/g DMI/kg BW/day, respectively, for CON, LEU, STA, and MIM). The
   sheep receiving STA had shown a tendency (p = 0.15) to reduce methane
   emission when compared to the CON group. Therefore, it is suggested that
   tropical tanniniferous legumes may have potential to reduce CH4 emission
   in sheep, but more research is warranted to confirm these results.},

Abstract = {Weeds are part of biodiversity and elements of natural resources when
   they are not a nuisance. Their biology and selective control to avoid
   competition with the crop is a major preoccupation. The aim of this work
   is to get knowledge about weeds and their control in banana production
   around the volcanic areas in humid south western Cameroon. Weeds, their
   classification and control practices are to be identified. The effect of
   shade through agroforestry is to be validated. Fallow areas are to be
   identified and farms around characterized for weed diversity.
   Three main categories of weeds were identified and include the common
   grasses which are widespread, like Imperata (Imperate cylindrica),
   Guinea grass (Panicum maximum) and elephant grass (Pennies
   tumpurpureum). The Mariscus category, like the common grasses but more
   hardy and angular include Mariscus (Mariscus alterniflius) and Cyperus
   (Cyperus rotundus). Latifoliates or climbing and twining grasses include
   Chromolaena (Chromolaena odorata), Euphorbia (Euphorbia heterophylla),
   Mimosa (Mimosa invisa), Tridax (Tridax procumbens), Ageratum (Ageratum
   conyzoides), water leaf (Talimum triangulare) and Commelina (Commelina
   beghalensis). These weeds showed rhizomes and other underground bodies,
   their stem, and seeds as elements of rapid invasion of banana farms. The
   most suitable agroforestry materials for the zone and the banana crop
   include Calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus) and Leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala), Cassia (Cassia spectabilis, Cassia alata), and Gliricidia
   (Gliricidia sepium) that simulate mulch, and their shade for weed
   control in production is clearly identified. Mucuna (Mucuna pruriens or
   utilis), Pueraria (pueraria phaseoloides), Mimosa (Mimosa invisa), and
   pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) are identified as cover crops which together
   with Tephrosia (Tephrosia candida) suppressed to a great amount of weeds
   in banana farms and banana fallow areas. Canavalia (Canavaliae
   nsiformis) is particularly good in areas of bimodal rainfall patterns.
   They shorten the fallows or periods in which weeds are eradicated.
   Selective eradication of weeds in banana farms was noted under trees
   where most weeds had disappeared. It was so under food crop trees like
   Njangsa, Bitter Kola and the Oil Palm and under the Mahogany, Ground
   Nuttree, Iroko and White Wood.},

Abstract = {Pantelleria is a volcanic island located in the Sicily Channel (Italy),
   between Sicily and Tunisia. The island, designated a National Park in
   2016, hosts an interesting vascular flora of over 600 species including
   9 narrow endemics. The island's incredible biodiversity is, however, at
   risk due to anthropogenic influences, climate change, and, recently, the
   presence and spread of alien plant species. The Pantelleria alien flora
   has never been thoroughly investigated, probably because many non-native
   species were not yet present or so widespread on the island. Now,
   however, with the increased general awareness of the risks associated
   with invasive alien species, documentation of the presence of non-native
   species has been steadily increasing. In this study, field and
   literature research was carried out to investigate the alien flora of
   the island. Here, we report the status of a number of non-native plants
   with known invasive potential. Cenchrus setaceus (=Pennisetum setaceum)
   is reported for the first time as naturalized in the island with clear
   invasive behaviour, while, particularly remarkable for their invasive
   potential are other studied plants such as: Acacia saligna, Ailanthus
   altissima, Boheravia coccinea, Carpobrotus edulis, Leucaena leucocephala
   subsp. glabrata, Malephora crocea, Melia azedarach, Nicotiana glauca,
   Opuntia ficus-indica, Parkinsonia aculeata, Washingtonia robusta and a
   few others less important at the moment, but to be monitored. Although
   most taxa showed a relatively limited distribution, the trend is to
   observe an increased invasiveness, which indicates that they can
   potentially become invasive in Pantelleria as well in the next years or
   decades. Their limited current distribution suggests that these species
   are in the early stages of the general invasion curve, when intervention
   is feasible and most likely to succeed. Therefore, it is most prudent to
   prioritize management for as many potentially problematic nonnatives as
   possible, which will contribute greatly to the conservation of native
   species and ecosystems of Pantelleria. Prevention and management of
   invasive non-native species-both future arrivals and those already
   present-are necessary to preserve the peculiar volcanic landscape of
   Pantelleria, which was shaped by man over the last millennia.},

Title = {Assessment of phytochemical content, polyphenolic composition,
   antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Leguminosae medicinal plants
   in Peninsular Malaysia},
Journal = {BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Background: Many medicinal plants from Leguminosae family can be found
   easily in Malaysia. These plants have been used as traditional medicines
   by local ethnic groups, where they are prepared as decoction, pastes for
   wound infections, and some have been eaten as salad. This paper focused
   on the assessment of antioxidant potential, antibacterial activity and
   classes of phytochemicals of nine plants from the Leguminosae family.
   Methods: Acacia auriculiformis, Bauhinia kockiana, Bauhinia purpurea,
   Caesalpinia pulcherrima, Calliandra tergemina, Cassia surattensis,
   Leucaena leucocephala, Peltophorum pterocarpum, and Samanea saman were
   extracted with aqueous methanol and dichloromethane: methanol mixture to
   test for antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The Folin-Ciocalteu
   assay was conducted to quantify the total phenolic content and 2,
   2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was used to determine the free
   radical quenching capacity. Antibacterial activity was assessed using
   disc diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) assay. Screening for major classes of
   phytochemical was done using standard chemical tests.
   Results: B. kockiana flowers and C. pulcherrima leaves contained high
   total phenolic content (TPC) and strong DPPH radical scavenging ability
   with TPC of 8280 +/- 498 mg GAE/100 g, IC50 of 27.0 +/- 5.0 mu g/mL and
   TPC of 5030 +/- 602 mg GAE/100 g, IC50 of 50.0 +/- 5.0 mu g/mL
   respectively. Positive correlation was observed between TPC and free
   radical scavenging ability. Most extracts showed antibacterial activity
   against Gram positive bacteria at 1 mg, while none showed activity
   against Gram negative bacteria at the same dose. All extracts (except
   Samanea saman flower) showed antibacterial activity against two strains
   of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with MID values
   ranging between 100 mu g/disc and 500 mu g/disc.
   Conclusion: The potential source of antioxidant and antibacterial
   agents, especially for MRSA infection treatments were found in B.
   kockiana, C. pulcherrima, C. tergemina and P. pterocarpum. These
   preliminary results would be a guide in the selection of potential
   candidates for further pharmacological study and in search of new drug
   candidate in treating MRSA infections.},

Abstract = {Root nodule bacteria were recovered from the leguminous tree, Dalbergia
   sissoo growing in the states of Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, eastern Uttar
   Pradesh and Tarai belt of Uttaranchal (26.45degreesN to 34.25degreesN
   Lat. and 74.57degreesE to 82.10degreesE long). Greenhouse trials were
   carried out on Dalbergia sissoo clones PSC-2, PS-31 and D for two
   consecutive years to screen the bacterial strains (35) for nodulation
   specificity and improvement of plant growth potential. Considerable
   strain variation in host genotype specificity with respect to nodulation
   and nitrogen fixation was observed. During the first year trial
   involving 35 strains, 19 nodulated D. sissoo clone PSC-2. In all the
   treatments that were positive for nodulation, nitrogen percent per g
   shoot dry wt. ranged from 0.4-1.8, DSNP2d was an exception where N level
   was 0.1\%. Eighteen bacterial strains which were positive for nodulation
   in the first year trial were further tested on clone PS-31 and D.
   Nodulation and effectiveness of nodulation was plant host-genotype
   dependent. All eighteen strains formed nodules on clone PS-31 whereas
   only eight nodulated clone D. Bacterial strains DSNPNA13 and DSNJKS7
   effectively nodulated clone PS-31 as confirmed by nitrogenase activity
   (280.6 and 399.5 mumole of ethylene / g nodule fresh wt. / min); they
   were however ineffective against clone D. The nodule number did not show
   any correlation with the level of ethylene formed or the plant shoot dry
   weight. The number of nodules per plant in DSNPNJ8 treated clone D and
   clone PS-31 was 39.4 and 76.6 whereas shoot dry wt. in the corresponding
   treatments was 3:9 and 2.2 g, respectively. The amount of ethylene
   formed was 96.4 and 2050.0 mumole, respectively. Considerable
   variability amongst the strains has been observed at the genetic level
   based on whole cell protein profiles. This could partly explain
   variations in nodulation and nitrogenase activity of strains vis-a-vis
   host genotype. Among D. sissoo bacterial strains, 20 nodulated Sesbania

Abstract = {With the aim to evaluate the biological activity of purified condensed
   tannins of tropical forages we conducted two in vitro experiments. In
   the first, using a radial diffusion technique, the protein precipitation
   of free condensed tannins (FCT) from Manihot esculenta, leucaena
   leucocephala, Arachis pintoi, Guazuma ulmyfolia, Gliricidia sepium and
   of tannic acid on bovine serum albumin (ASB), papain, pepsin and trypsin
   at pH 5.0 and 6.8 was evaluated with a three-way analysis of variance.
   Significant effects (P less than or equal to 0.05) for the tannin type,
   protein source, pH and their interactions were observed. Pepsin showed
   the highest protein precipitation (PP) at a pH of 5.0 (82.9 mug) with
   FCT of G ulmyfolia and the lowest (0 and 0.2 mug) of BSA with G sepium
   and A pintoi at pH 6.8. Experiments were then conducted using completely
   randomized designs in order to observe the effect of adding 0, 1.25 or
   2.50 mg of FCT from M esculenta and L leucocephala to the rumen
   fluid-buffer in an in vitro dry matter digestibility test (IVDMD) of
   Medicago sativa and Brachiaria decumbens, The IVDMD value of M sativa
   (757 g kg(-1)) decreased with L leucocephala tannins, although with
   those of M esculenta it was increased (824 g kg(-1) and 871 g kg(-1),
   respectively) for 1.25 and 2.5 mg of FCT. The IVDMD value of B decumbens
   (774 g kg(-1) without tannins) diminished with any tannin and any dose
   (P < 0.05). We conclude that there are differences in the FCT contents
   of fodder crops and in their biological activity measured as the
   capacity to precipitate proteins, which is modified by the type of
   tannin, the protein and the pH. The result of an IVDMD is regulated by
   the type of tannin and its dose. (C) 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.},

Abstract = {The effects of particle size on the nitrogen degradability of four
   tropical forages were studied in 1991 in Guadeloupe. Samples of pangola
   grass (Digitaria decumbens) 22 and 47 days old, Gliricidia sepium and
   Leucaena leucocephala were prepared as follows: grasses were (1) freshly
   cut with scissors to 0.5-1.0 cm in length and frozen at -18-degrees-C;
   or for later study were dried at 80-degrees-C and ground to pass a (2)
   0.5 mm, (3) 1.0 mm or (4) 2.0 mm screen. Nitrogen degradability (ND) was
   determined by placing samples in nylon bags with two different pore
   sizes (25 and 46 mum) which were then put into the rumen of cows for 2,
   4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 h. The kinetics of nitrogen degradation were
   examined using Orskov's model. Particle losses through the nylon bags,
   dry matter (DM) and nitrogen solubility of the samples were also
   measured in vitro. The sample preparation and the type of forage were
   the main sources of variation in the rapidly degradable nitrogen
   fraction, the slowly degradable nitrogen fraction, the degradation rate,
   the potentially degradable nitrogen fraction and ND. Nitrogen
   degradability was 55.8, 46.7, 64.0 and 46.5\% for pangola grass (at 22
   and 47 days regrowth), Gliricidia and Leucaena samples, respectively.
   Mean ND was 47.9, 59.4, 56.1 and 49.6\% for freshly cut and 0.5, 1.0 and
   2.0 mm dried ground samples, respectively. Sample preparation had little
   effect on nitrogen solubility. For samples dried and ground at 0.5 and
   1.0 mm, particle losses were 18.8 and 15.0\% of DM, respectively. The
   insoluble but degradable fraction was 60.8, 51.9, 42.5 and 42.7\% for
   freshly cut and 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mm dried ground samples, respectively.
   The freshly cut material appeared to be suitable for the estimation of

Abstract = {The study was conducted at the Regional University Center located in
   Temozon, north of Yucatan (Mexico). The dietary preferences of 10 white
   tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) subspecies yucatanensis were
   estimated in the selection of eleven plants growing in the state of
   Yucatan, using a cafeteria study type. The chemical composition and in
   vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of the diet and the different
   vegetal species were determined, as well as the nutritional balance of
   the deer (30.2 +/- 2.65 kg of BW) fed with those species. The deer
   selected mainly the arboreal ones (76.52\%), with a smaller proportion
   of forbs (19.37\%), herbaceous (5.81\%) and a minimum Of graminae
   (0.29\%). The legumes Leucaena leucocephala and Brosimum alicastrum

   city matter, 17.64\% crude protein. 42.53\% cell walls with an IVDMD of
   56.90\%. The results of multiple linear regression analyses showed that
   the arboreal species have a significant impact (P < 0.0006) in the food
   consumption, whereas the crude protein tended (P < 0.096) to modify it.
   The analysis of variance showed that dry matter percentage influences

Abstract = {The study of diet and physiological peculiarities of the digestive
   system of neotropical deer is not well known and the literature shows
   inconsistencies. To better understand the digestive system of these
   mammals the difference in the gastro-intestinal transit time of four
   species of neotropical deer (Mazama americana, Mazama gouazoubira,
   Mazama nana, Blastocerus dichotomus), kept ill captivity, was evaluated.
   Four plants (Neonotonia wightii, Morus albans, Medicago sativa, Leucaena
   leucocephala) were utilized and two variables were measured, mean time
   of the beginning of the elimination (BE) and mean time of permanence
   (TP). The results obtained for BE indicated similarity among the deer
   species, with significant differences between M. gouazoubira (mean =
   13.62 hr) and M. Americana (mean = 19.25 hr). For the plants, the BE was
   faster with N. wightii and L. leucocephala, and slower for M. sativa.
   The TP results for B. dichotomus showed longer time when compared to the
   other species, whereas M. gouazoubira had a lower permanence. Overall,
   N. wightii had the highest retention time in the digestive tract of all
   the deer species studied. Associated with this observation, N. wightii
   had the highest quantity of plant fiber of the plants tested. In a
   similar fashion M. sativa showed the lowest TP in the digestive tract of
   the deer and had the lowest quantity of acid detergent fiber. The data
   from this study showed that, within species, the shape of the excretion
   curve of the plants was similar when the animals consumed N. wightii or
   M. sativa. Blastocerus dichotomus and M. gouazoubira had the highest and
   the lowest gastro-intestinal transit time, respectively. This suggests
   that these species characterize different abilities to digest high fiber
   food, and consequently, represent the two extremities in the
   morphophysiological adaptation within the deer species evaluated. This
   information is vital because it is important to know the digestive
   physiology to define the diet of captive animals, particularly regarding
   the quantity and quality of fiber. Zoo Biol 25:47-57, 2006. (C) 2005

Abstract = {In the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa, where deforestation and
   cropland soil degradation occur at alarming rates, the (re-)introduction
   of trees on degraded lands can improve and sustain farming systems and
   landscapes. The shoot and root morphological traits of five woody
   species introduced to degraded cropland were assessed with a particular
   focus on the survival, early establishment and growth of saplings
   subjected to manuring (1 kg per plant) and drip irrigation (0.5 L of
   water per plant per day). Functional traits of the woody above- and
   belowground organs of field-grown plants were monitored for the first 15
   months after planting, covering two growing (rainy) seasons and one dry
   season. The high survival rate (>60\%), combined with a very low
   incidence rate (<1\%), for all species was evidence of successful
   establishment overall. The highest survival rates (94-100\%) were
   observed in Jatropha curcas L, Leucaena leucocephala Lam. and Moringa
   oleifera Lam. The mortality rate of the most drought-sensitive species
   Parkia biglobosa Jacq. could be reduced ten-fold through supplemental
   irrigation during the dry season. The fast-growing L. leucocephala, M.
   oleifera and.). curcas had higher values for shoot-level traits than did
   the slow-growing Anacardium occidentale L. and P. biglobosa.
   Fertilization and irrigation enhanced the shoot growth of both the fast
   and slow growers during the dry and growing seasons. In contrast,
   belowground development was either increased or reduced by fertilization
   and irrigation during the growing and dry seasons, but the slow growers
   demonstrated a more plastic response to these treatments than did the
   fast growers. Among the studied traits, the relative growth rate of
   plant as a whole (i.e. shoots and roots combined) exhibited the greatest
   plastic response to resource availability, thus suggesting its
   application in screening candidate species for afforestation efforts.
   Overall, the five studied species were considered suitable for the
   afforestation of degraded croplands, while the early growth and
   establishment of saplings could be boosted by irrigation and a supply of
   manure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala(Lam.) de Wit) and pearl millet
   (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.) were grown together in an alley cropping
   system in a semi-arid area of India. The five treatments included sole
   millet (SM), sole leucaena (SL) planted in double rows to form hedges
   with an alley width of 2.8 m, and alley cropping treatments LM5, LM6,
   and LM6P with alley widths of 2.8, 3.3 and 3.3 m and five, six and six
   rows of millet, respectively. LM6P differed from LM6 in that a vertical
   polytene barrier separated the root systems of leucaena and millet to a
   depth of 50 cm. Dry matter production and light interception data for
   millet and leucaena are presented to allow comparison of light capture
   and utilisation efficiency by the two species under contrasting hedge
   management in the rainy seasons of 1986 and 1987.
   Dry matter yields of leucaena did not differ significantly between
   treatments in either rainy season, but were much higher in 1987 than in
   1986 because of the less severe lopping regime. The higher yields in
   1987 resulted from a greater mean fractional light interception by
   leucaena, which increased shading of alley cropped millet when compared
   with 1986. The dry matter yields of millet in treatments LM5 and LM6
   were reduced relative to the sole crop in both years. In 1986, this
   reduction appeared to result primarily from shading, while in 1987 the
   mean fractional light interception and the pre-anthesis conversion
   coefficient were both lower in LM5 than in SM. Above- and below-ground
   competition interacted in 1986, so that when root competition was
   reduced (LM6P) the millet was able to grow taller, eventually matching
   the leucaena in height and partially escaping the shading and yield
   reduction experienced in LM5 and LM6. In 1987, the hedges were always
   more than 1 m taller than the millet and the root barrier failed to
   remove the detrimental competition between leucaena and millet.},

Title = {Forest landscapes increase diversity of honeybee diets in the tropics},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Honeybees (Apis mellifera) depend entirely on floral resources (pollen
   and nectar) in their surrounding landscape to satisfy their dietary
   needs. Honeybee diets in temperate areas have been well studied, and
   there is increasing evidence that floral diversity is critical for
   honeybee health. Tropical forests often contain high floral diversity
   but honeybee diets have been rarely studied in the tropics. We aim to
   compare the botanical sources in bee bread between landscapes with and
   without surrounding forest cover in the eastern highlands of Papua New
   Guinea. We collected bee bread from 24 hives across 8 sites over two
   years and examined floral sources, diversity measures and major plant
   groups using DNA metabarcoding. We identified a total of 89 taxa across
   34 orders, 41 families, 84 genera and 61 species of botanical sources in
   bee bread. Bee bread from hives in sites with surrounding forest
   contained significantly greater species diversity (H' Forest = 1.4, H'
   No forest = 1.1) and species evenness (J Forest = 0.68, J No forest =
   0.6). Trees were the most abundant source of bee bread, regardless of
   landscape, and constituted 52\% of total abundance. Herbaceous plants,
   mostly introduced species, were the second most abundant floral sources
   at - 26\% of total bee bread abundance, particularly in forest
   landscapes. We found the most abundant sources such as introduced tree
   species Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) and native tree species
   Syzigium unipunctatum (Myrtaceae) were foraged on in both landscapes;
   other common species included introduced species Hylodesmum nudifloram
   (Facbaceae) and Bidens pilosa (Asteraceae), and native food crop Entada
   phaseoloides (Fabaceae). Interestingly, many wind pollinated species
   were found in both landscapes including Araucaria (Araucariaceae), Pinus
   (Pinaceae), Nothofagaceae species and Poaceae species. Our work suggests
   that bees are seeking out floral tree resources even in landscapes where
   trees are scarce. Thus beekeeping in tropical environments would benefit
   from preserving remaining forest cover and incorporating more trees to
   existing, open landscapes to optimize the diversity in honeybee diets.},

   value of leaves of the shrub legumes Acacia angustissima (Miller)
   Kuntze, Calliandra calothyrsus Meissn and Leucaena leucocephala ( Lam.)
   de Wit were determined in two studies in Zimbabwe. In the first study,
   the effects of shade-, sun- and oven-drying leaves on chemical
   composition and protein precipitation capacity of tannin extracts were
   studied. Drying method affected (P < 0.01) chemical composition, with
   cell wall polysaccharides increasing from shade drying to oven drying.
   Calliandra calothyrsus leaves had the highest total phenolics, tannin
   phenolics and the lowest N content. About 40\% of phenolics in L.
   leucocephala were non-tannin compared to less than 15\% in A.
   angustissima and C. calothyrsus. Extractable proanthocyanidins and their
   capacity to precipitate protein were affected ( P < 0.01) by drying
   method; extracts from shade- dried leaves were 10\% and 20\% more
   reactive than extracts from sun- and oven-dried leaves, respectively.
   The relative degree of polymerisation of the proanthocyanidins was
   higher (P < 0.01) for oven-dried (1.44) leaves compared to shade-dried
   (1.01) and sun-dried (1.00) leaves. Drying temperature influences the
   nutrient - polyphenolic interactions in A. angustissima, C. calothyrsus
   and L. leucocephala leaves and these interactions have important
   implications for feed evaluation protocols and for use of these leaves
   in ruminant feeding systems. The second study considered the effects of
   feeding sun- dried or fresh leaves of the three shrub legumes as
   supplements to native pasture hay on nutrient intake and digestion by
   goats. Feeding the fresh or dry leaves made no difference in terms of
   dry matter intake and digestion, and N digestion. This offers farmers
   flexibility in terms of feeding strategies, as they can feed the browse
   in any form that suits their farm situation. Increasing the level of C.
   calothyrsus in the diet increased faecal N. Nitrogen retention was lower
   for animals fed with C. calothyrsus compared to those fed with the other
   browses.},

Journal = {AGRONOMY JOURNAL},
Year = {1979},
Volume = {71},
Number = {6},
Pages = {903-908},
Abstract = {Most plant species, including the major crops, from symbiotic
   mycorrhizal associations between their roots and certain fungi which
   influence nutrient uptake, especially P, from infertile soils. How
   well-supplied the phosphate must be before mycorrhizae cease to enhance
   P uptake is not known, nor have the effects of mycorrhizae on external P
   requirements of crops been adequately determined in the field. The
   influence of mycorrhizae on the P requirements of crops in a tropical
   field environment on a Tropeptic Eutrustox was studied. Plant growth and
   P uptake by non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants (methyl
   bromide-fumigated and non-fumigated soil) were measured at 10 levels of
   soil P using 7 plant species. Brassica chinensis, which does not form
   symbiotic mycorrhizal associations, consistently grew better and took up
   more P from the fumigated than from the non-fumigated soil. All other
   species growing in non-fumigated plots formed association with
   mycorrhizae. In general, plants growing on fumigated soil did not become
   infected with mycorrhizae. In P-deficient situations, plant
   concentration of P was enhanced by the mycorrhizal associations. The
   levels of soil P at which fumigation ceased to make a difference in the
   P percentage in plants of the various species were as follows: Glycine
   max (L.) Merr. (0.1 .mu.g P/ml), Vigna unguiculata L. (0.2 .mu.g P/ml),
   Allium cepa L. (0.8 .mu.g P/ml), Leucaena leucocephala (1.6 .mu.g P/ml),
   Stylosanthes hamata and Manihot esculenta (1.6 + .mu.g P/ml). This
   listing may be the order in which these species depend on mycorrhizae in
   P-deficient soils. As a mean of 6 spp. growing on the 2 lowest soil P
   levels, P uptake by mycorrhizal plants was 25 times greater than that by
   plants without mycorrhizal associations. Thus, some crops appear to be
   quite dependent upon a mycorrhizal association for P absorption from a
   soil of high sorption capacity.},

Title = {Catalytic Steam Reforming of Biomass-Derived Tar over the Coal/Biomass
   Blended Char: Effect of Devolatilization Temperature and Biomass Type},
Journal = {ENERGY \& FUELS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Catalytic tar steam reforming over char was conducted in a two-stage
   fixed-bed reactor. This reactor was divided into two zones: the
   ``devolatilization zone{''}, where the biomass tar is released, and the
   ``tar reforming zone{''}, where the tar and char are contacted and
   reformed into products. The temperature of the tar reforming zone was
   maintained at 800 degrees C for all experiments. The effects of
   devolatilization temperature (600, 700, and 800 degrees C) and biomass
   type (rice straw, RS, and Leucaena leucocephala wood, LN) on the
   catalytic performance of char during tar steam reforming were
   investigated. Biomass chars and coal/biomass blended chars (C/RS and
   C/LN) were prepared as the catalyst for tar steam reforming. Results
   revealed that compared with biomass chars, C/RS and C/LN performed a
   better catalytic activity in tar steam reforming, resulting in a higher
   carbon conversion into gas and a lower carbon conversion into tar. The
   main catalytic roles of the coal/biomass blended char can be explained
   by the improvement of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area
   during co-pyrolysis and the existence of alkali and alkaline earth
   metallic species (AAEMs), particularly K, as the stable silicate form.
   Considering the effect of devolatilization temperature, the tar released
   at 700 degrees C can be mostly converted among all types of char. Tars
   containing the mixture of phenolic compounds (i.e., phenol and methyl
   phenol) and aromatic compounds (i.e., naphthalene and methyl
   naphthalene) were favorable to reform over the char surface to achieve
   the relatively high tar conversion. In addition, LN tar was easier to
   convert than the RS tar in both cases of with and without char because
   of the lower proportion of a stable aromatic compound. The outcome of
   this study can be beneficial for the design and operation of the tar
   removal process during biomass gasification using the low-cost
   carbon-based catalyst.},

Abstract = {Worldwide, increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have become a major
   concern as they are now considered to be the cause of global warming.
   Several strategies have been planned and taken by different countries
   including Indonesia to mitigate this situation. Agriculture is
   considered to be one of major contributors to GHG, especially methane
   coming from ruminant digestive processes. More than 85\% of the methane
   produced by ruminants comes from enteric fermentation. Several options
   have been proposed to lower this enteric methane production. This paper
   describes a review on diet manipulation using feed additives, especially
   plant bioactive compounds, to mitigate the GHG emission from ruminant
   livestock. Plant bioactive compounds have been found with various
   chemical structures. Some of them such as saponin, tannin, essential
   oils, organosulphur compounds, have been reported to have ability to
   reduce enteric methane production. Indonesia has many plant resources
   that have potential as methane reducing agents. Sapindus rarak fruit
   especially its methanol extract contain saponins which reduce the
   activity of methanogens in the rumen in vitro, hence reduce methane
   production (11\%). Feeding S. rarak to sheep increased daily weight gain
   but not that of local cattle. Shrub legumes such as Calliandra
   calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala contain tannins which can reduce
   methanogenesis (3 - 21\% methane reduction). Besides tannin, these shrub
   legumes are a good source of protein. Feeding shrub legumes can be
   beneficial as a protein source and a methane reducer. Other sources of
   methane reducing agents have been tested in other countries and some can
   be applied for Indonesian situation. The strategy to reduce methane by
   plant bioactive compounds should be developed to be simple and
   relatively cheap so it will benefit the local farmers. Extraction of
   these compounds may be expensive, therefore, costs should be considered
   carefully when proposing to use the extract as a feed additive for
   livestock raised by small farmers. It is recommended to develop a
   feeding system for ruminant using tannin containing plants/legumes,
   saponin containing plants or other plants.},

Abstract = {Thirty Angora (16+/-2 kg) and 20 Spanish (19+/-2 kg) 8-month-oid
   doelings, having not previously consumed Leucaena leucocephala, were
   used to determine effects of dietary inclusion of a moderate level of
   Leucaena on fleece shedding and subsequent fibre characteristics. A diet
   of 22.5\% Leucaena leaf meal (0.17\% mimosine in total diet dry matter)
   was consumed ad libitum for 8 days starting on November 13, with daily
   mimosine intake in the first 3 d averaging 56 mg/kg body weight. At d
   10, fleece shedding was clearly visible in 17 of the 30 Angora doelings
   and in 9 of the 20 Spanish doelings. Doelings in which the visual
   shedding score was above 2 (5-point scale: 1 = no shedding and 5 =
   excessive shedding; mean of cashmere and guard shedding scores for
   Spanish doelings) on d 19 were categorized as exhibiting a shedding
   response to Leucaena. By d 35, six Angora and three Spanish doelings had
   completely shed fleece. Clean mohair growth rate in Angora doelings was
   lower (P<0.05) for shedding vs nonshedding doelings on d 8 to 40 (0.29
   vs 0.68 mg/(cm(2) d(-1))) but similar (P>0.10) between shedding groups
   on d 41 to 63 (1.51 vs 1.46 mg/(cm(2) d(-1))), although cashmere growth
   rate was not different (P>0.10) between shedding groups on either d 8 to
   40 or d 41 to 63. Secondary follicle activity was lower (P<0.05) on d 8
   for shedding than for nonshedding Angora doelings (89 vs 99\%), but
   activity on d 63 was similar (95 and 96\%, respectively). Secondary
   follicle activity for Spanish does was similar between shedding groups
   on d 8 and 63 (P>0.10) In conclusion, feeding of Leucaena holds promise
   as a means of inducing fleece shedding in goats, apparently without
   marked subsequent effects on productivity. However, further research
   with higher dietary levels of mimosine is necessary.},

   degradable CP fractions ranged from 0.70 to 0.83 of total CP, with
   higher (P<0.001) CP fractions for legumes vs. grasses/cereals. Overall,
   legumes had a higher unavailable CHO fraction than the grasses or
   cereals. Legumes were more fully degraded in vitro than in grasses and
   cereals, being highest (P<0.001) in GOL and least in SOT. After 24 h of

   than grasses or cereals. Loss of energy as CH4 was higher (P<0.001) in
   AHL and GOL than in the other forages, although there were no
   differences among the groups; cereals, grasses and legumes. Only ADF and
   cellulose were positively correlated (P<0.05) with CH4 production (g/kg

   CH4, knowledge of the CH4 potential of these forages will help in
   formulating low CH4 producing diets for ruminants. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   these active extracts were further fractionated and bio-assayed to yield
   four photosensitisers, all of which are based on the pheophorbide-a and
   -b core structures. Our results suggest that the main photosensitisers
   from terrestrial plants are likely based on the cyclic tetrapyrrole
   structure and photosensitisers with other structures, if present, are
   present in minor amounts or are not as active as those with the cyclic

   leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit and Delonix regia (Boj. ex Hook. Raf.)
   resulted in 23 and 13\% higher soil N than the control, respectively,
   after 5 years. There were no differences in total N at the other sites
   but soil N was highest under Leucaena hybrid and Acacia angustissima
   (Mill.) Kuntze, respectively at the basaltic and high elevation sites.
   Soils under D. regia (calcareous) and A. angustissima and Leucaena
   hybrid (high elevation) had higher organic C than the respective
   controls. Carbon and N mineralization and C turnover were highest when
   soils were amended with leaves of Leucaena diversifolia (Schlecht.)
   Benth (calcareous and basaltic soils) and A. angustissima (high
   elevation) and lowest in non-amended control soils. Stem-amended soils
   showed differences in C mineralization for calcareous and high elevation
   soils whereas N mineralization was similar among treatments within
   sites. Carbon and N mineralization (high elevation soil) correlated
   positively with N concentrations of leaf prunings. Amendments with leaf
   prunings increased soil C and N mineralization and turnover rates,
   suggesting greater nutrient availability for the crop during a short
   period than in non-amended control soils.},

Abstract = {Two concurrent factorial experiments investigated the relative merits of
   the following management options to maximise liveweight gains in
   finishing cattle: breed {[}Hereford (Bos taurus) v. Belmont Red (B.
   taurus x B. indicus)]; implantation with zeranol; feed energy source
   (sorghum grain, molasses + urea, tropical grass pastures); feed protein
   source (sunflower meal, Leucaena leucocephala, tropical pasture
   legumes). These combinations of treatments were delivered by using nil,
   intermittent, or continuous grazing systems. Sixty steers of initial
   liveweight (+/- s.e) 321 +/- 3.6 kg were held on their respective
   treatments for 77 or 98 days, by which time all except those on pasture
   without supplement had attained at least 400 kg liveweight. Steers were
   slaughtered in a commercial abattoir and carcass characteristics
   recorded.
   Zeranol-implanted cattle grew faster than untreated (0.84 v. 0.66
   kg/day), and there was a trend (P = 0.14) for Belmont Red cattle to grow
   faster than Herefords (0.83 v. 0.67 kg/day). In all systems, cattle
   given ad libitum sorghum grain grew significantly (P<0.05) better than
   those given molasses + urea (1.54-0.55 v. 0.72-0.45 kg/day). The poor
   performance of molasses-fed cattle was associated with low voluntary
   feed consumptions. The highest rates of gain (1.54 kg/day) were for
   penned cattle on a sorghum grain + sunflower ration. The provision of
   either supplement promoted better gains than that found for
   unsupplemented steers grazing tropical grass-legume pastures (-0.29 to
   +0.25 kg/day). However, cattle continuously grazing (10 steers/ha)
   leucaena-grass pastures and those given sunflower meal had significantly
   (P<0.05) higher rates of gain (0.82 and 0.91 kg/day, respectively) than
   cattle given molasses supplements or grazing alone. Cattle given sorghum
   had higher carcass weights and fat contents than those fed molasses or
   with grazing alone, although only those in the feedlot had acceptable
   fat cover at slaughter. There was no significant effect of treatments on
   the fatty acid composition of subcutaneous fat.},

Abstract = {The foraging response of goats and sheep to tannin-rich plants (TRP)
   could be influenced by their physiological adaptation to eat fodder from
   a specific ecological niche. The aims of this study were: (1) to
   describe the amino acid profile of the protein from whole saliva of
   adult goats and hair sheep browsing/grazing native vegetation, (2) to
   measure the interaction of whole saliva from goats and hair sheep with
   tannic acid, (3) to compare the tannin-binding capacity of lyophilized
   whole saliva from goats and sheep to precipitate tannins extracted from
   the fodder of tropical TRP (Acacia pennatula, Lysiloma latisiliquum,
   Leucaena leucocephala and Piscidia piscipula). Fresh whole saliva was
   obtained from 42 adult goats and 51 adult hair sheep. A second batch of
   saliva (obtained from 75 adult goats and 93 adult hair sheep) was
   lyophilized whole saliva. Protein from whole saliva in both animal
   species had a similar pattern of amino acid composition. Histidine and
   arginine were found, accounting for 30\% and 24\% of the amino acid
   content, respectively. Whole saliva from goats and sheep showed a linear
   dose response to increasing concentrations of tannic acid at each time
   point measured (P<0.001). Saliva from goats was able to precipitate
   higher quantities of TRP extracts from A. pennatula and L. latisiliquum
   than from P. piscipula and L. leucocephala (P < 0.05). Saliva from sheep
   precipitated higher quantities of L latisiliquum and P. piscipula
   extracts (P<0.01). Also, salivary proteins from goats had higher
   capacity to precipitate tannins from A. pennatula than sheep, while
   salivary protein from sheep had higher capacity to precipitate tannins
   from P. piscipula than goats (P<0.05). The results provide evidence of
   the differences between goats and sheep in the capacity of their saliva
   to interact with local sources of tannins, which could explain the
   different feeding behaviour of goats and sheep. The presence of
   histatins may help to explain the in vivo AH effects of TRP fodder. (C)

Abstract = {Thirty each of growing male kids and ram lambs were stall fed ad libitum
   on fresh, hand chopped Napier Bajra-21 (NB-21) and supplemented with
   either concentrates (Maize grain (MG) + deoiled groundnut cake (GNC)
   alone (T-1) or along with groundnut haulms (T-2), dried leaf meal of
   Leucaena leucocephala (T-3), Sesbania grandiflora (T-4), Gliricidia
   maculata (T-5) or Ficus bengalensis (T-6) to meet 30 \% of DM
   requirements. The effect of supplementation on rumen fermentation
   pattern, digestibility of nutrients and growth performance was studied
   in two parallel growth trials (180 days). The concentration of rumen
   metabolites except total N was higher (P<0.01) in rams than in bucks
   across treatments and among the treatments, T-1 or T-4 sustained higher
   (P <0.01) concentration of rumen metabolites. Nutrient digestibility
   except CP was higher (P<0,01) in kids than in lambs while among
   treatments, the digestibility of OM, CF, ADF and cellulose was
   comparable. The digestibility of CP and NDF was lower (P<0.05) in T-6
   than in other treatmems. The nitrogen retention (g/d) and \% of intake
   or absorbed in lambs was higher (P < 0.05) in kids than in lambs and
   among treatments, higher (P < 0.01) nitrogen retention was observed in
   T-3 or T-4 fed animals. The ADG was less (P<0.01) and the EFU was
   inferior (P<0.01) in kids than in lambs due to lower (P<0.01) DM1 from
   NB21 and roughage supplements. Among treatments, the ADG was comparable
   while the EFU was superior (P<0.01) in animals fed T-3, T-4 or T-5 than
   in T-2 or T-6. Supplementation with legume tree leaves (T-3 to T-5) was
   beneficial for economic and sustainable production of ram lambs whereas,
   intensive system of management was not successful with kids due to low
   DMI from basal roughage and roughage supplements.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The goal of the present study was to assess a soil seed bank as an input
   seed source for revegetating lead/zinc (Pb/Zh) mine tailings. The seed
   bank source was abandoned farmland, whose top 10-cm layer of topsoil
   contained 6,850 +/- 377 seeds/m(2) from 41 species. The seeds in the
   soil were principally distributed in the upper 0-2 cm, which held 75.8\%
   of total seeds and 92.7\% of species composition. The top 2-cm layer of
   topsoil may be sufficient to serve the purpose of providing a seed
   source for revegetation on derelict lands, including mined lands. Four
   different thicknesses of topsoil (1, 2, 4, and 8 cm, redistributed from
   the total 0-10-cm layer from the farmland) were field-tested on the
   Pb/Zn mine tailings. There was no significant difference in seedling
   density among the 4 thickness treatments. Many seeds in the treatments
   with more than 1-cm of topsoil were unable to emerge from the deeper
   layer. Seedlings in plots with topsoil of 1-, 2- and 4-cm failed to
   establish within 1 year due to the extremely high acidity (pH 2.39 to
   2.76). A shallow layer of topsoil cannot neutralize the sulfuric acid
   generated from oxidation of pyrites in the tailings. For establishment
   of seedlings on metalliferous lands, an insulating layer such as
   subsoil, building rubble, or domestic refuse is necessary before
   covering with valuable topsoil. The woody legume Leucaena leucocephala
   grown on the tailings with a topsoil cover of 8-cm was the most dominant
   species. Lead was accumulated in root, branch, stem bark, and xylem,
   which accounted for more than 80\% of the total metal concentration in
   the plant. This portion of Pb will reside in the plant for a long
   period, while the smaller portion of Pb in the leaf (about 15\%) could
   be returned to the environment as litter during growth. Woody plants may
   have an advantage in metalphyto-remediation over herbaceous plants.},

Number = {9-10},
Pages = {1483-1498},
Abstract = {The effects of different fallow management systems on aggregate
   stability were studied on an Ultisol and an Alfisol in southern Nigeria.
   Aggregate stability was measured in natural regrowth, and planted
   fallows of Pueraria phaseoloides Benth. and Leucaena leucocephala Lam de
   Wit in a trial established in 1989 on an Alfisol at Ibadan (7 degrees
   30'N, 3 degrees 54'E), southwestern Nigeria. Soil samples (0-30 cm depth
   at this instance) were wetted by immersion for 2 and 10 minutes before
   wet-sieving at 30 rpm for 5 to 35 minutes at 5 minute increments.
   Mean-weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD) and
   proportions of water-stable aggregates (WSA) were calculated. GMD and
   WSA were not affected by the length of pre-wetting or by the length of
   the wet-sieving period. Thus, wet-sieving for more than 5 minutes at 30
   rpm was not necessary for these sandy soils. The trends observed for
   soil aggregate stability differed between the Alfisol and Ultisol, and
   for the Alfisol, it differed between a degraded and a managed fallow
   site. Thus, soil aggregate stability was influenced by soil type and
   soil management. The GMDs for the natural regrowth at 0-10 cm soil depth
   (0-15 cm soil depth sampling at 5 cm increment in this case) were
   between 1.12 and 1.42 mm, 1.14 and 1.46 mm for the Pueraria system, and
   1.12 and 1.33 mm for the Leucaena system. An adjacent forest soil (0-10
   cm) had GMDs between 1.24 and 1.54 mm. On a continuously cropped
   Alfisol, aggregate stability was significantly higher in the Pueraria
   live mulch system than in Leucaena alley cropping and natural regrowth.
   Fallowing for 2 or 3 years after 1 year cropping was essential under any
   of the systems to keep aggregate stability within the range of the
   forest soil. The fallow management practices enhanced surface soil
   aggregate stability.},

Abstract = {Insertion sequence (IS) element ISRLdTAL1145-1 from Rhizobium sp.
   (Leucaena diversifolia) strain TAL 1145 was entrapped in the sacB gene
   of the positive selection vector pUCD800 by insertional inactivation. A
   hybridization probe prepared from the whole 2.5-kb element was used to
   determine the distribution of homologous sequences in a diverse
   collection of 135 Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium strains. The IS probe
   hybridized strongly to Southern blots of genomic DNAs from 10 rhizobial
   strains that nodulate both Phaseolus vulgaris (beans) and Leucaena
   leucocephala (leguminous trees), 1 Rhizobium sp. that nodulates Leucaena
   spp., 9 R. meliloti (alfalfa) strains, 4 Rhizobium spp. that nodulate
   Sophora chrysophylla (leguminous trees), and 1 nonnodulating bacterium
   associated with the nodules of Pithecellobium dulce from the Leucaena
   cross-inoculation group, producing distinguishing IS patterns for each
   strain. Hybridization analysis revealed that ISRLdTAL1145-1 was strongly
   homologous with and closely related to a previously isolated element,
   ISRm USDA1024-1 from R. meliloti, while restriction enzyme analysis
   found structural similarities and differences between the two IS
   homologs. Two internal segments of these IS elements were used to
   construct hybridization probes of 1.2 kb and 380 bp that delineate a
   structural similarity and a difference, respectively, of the two IS
   homologs. The internal segment probes were used to analyze the
   structures of homologous IS elements in other strains. Five types of
   structural variation in homolog IS elements were found. The predominate
   IS structural type naturally occurring in a strain can reasonably
   identify the strain's cross-inoculation group relationships. Three IS
   structural types were found in Rhizobium species that nodulate beans and
   Leucaena species, one of which included the designated type IIB strain
   of R. tropici (CIAT 899). Weak homology to the whole IS probe, but not
   with the internal segments, was found with two Bradyrhizobium japonicum
   strains. The taxonomic and ecological implications of the distribution
   of ISRLdTAL1145-1 are discussed.},

Abstract = {Yields under alley cropping might be improved if the most limiting
   nutrients not adequately supplied or cycled by the leaves could be added
   as an inorganic fertilizer supplement. Three historic leaf management
   strategies had been in effect for 3 years in a Leucaena leucocephala
   alley cropping trial on the Lilongwe Plain of central Malawi: 1) leaves
   returned; 2) leaves removed; and 3) leaves removed, with 100 kg
   inorganic N ha(-1) added. An initial soil analysis showed P status to be
   suboptimal under all strategies. A confounded 3(4) factorial experiment
   was conducted with the following treatments: leaf management strategy
   (as above), N fertilizer rate (0, 30, and 60 kg N ha(-1)), P fertilizer
   rate (0, 18, and 35 kg P ha(-1)), and maize population(14,800, 29,600,
   and 44,400 plants ha(-1)). Both N and P were yield limiting, and
   interacted positively to improve yields. The addition of 30 kg N and 18
   kg P ha(-1) improved yields similarly under all leaf management
   strategies by an average of 2440 kg ha(-1). Increasing the rates to 60
   kg N and 35 kg P ha(-1) improved yields an additional 1990 kg ha(-1) in
   the `leaves returned' and `leaves removed + N' strategies, but did not
   improve yields under the `leaves removed' strategy. Lower yields were
   related to lack of P response at the highest P rate in this treatment,
   which may have induced Zn deficiency. Plots receiving leaves had higher
   organic C, total N, pH, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, and S, and lower C/N
   ratios in the 0-15 cm soil layer than did plots where leaves had been
   removed. Leaf removal with N addition was similar to leaf removal alone
   for all soil factors measured except for organic C and total N, which
   were higher where N had been added. The results show that N and P were
   the primary yield-limiting nutrients. Historic N application maintained
   the soil's ability to respond to N and P on par with leaf additions.},

Abstract = {India is one of the major producers/consumers of paper and pulp products
   (3-4\% of global share). Approximately one-fourth of industry raw
   material has come from wood-based plantations from the 1990s onwards.
   The greatest development challenge faced by the industry since that time
   is sourcing robust raw material from agroforestry on private lands.
   Following genetic improvement of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and
   realization of its potential as a multiple-use species, it was
   introduced into India in 1980 under an international cooperation effort
   with support from the Swedish International Development Cooperation
   Agency (SIDA). It has since spread across the country as a panacea for
   rural needs of fuel wood, small timber and cattle forage. The paper
   industry has found that it has potential as raw material for paper
   making. One of the largest Indian paper companies is JK Paper Ltd, which
   has an annual production capacity of 550,000 t/yr with 3 integrated pulp
   and paper plants located at Songadh (Gujarat), Rayagada (Orissa) and
   Kagaznagar (Telangana) producing writing and printing paper and virgin
   packaging boards.
   This case study describes the leucaena farm forestry plantation program
   initiated by JK Paper Ltd, Unit CPM (Central Pulp Mills). The unit,
   under its agroforestry and farm forestry plantation approach, planted
   leucaena plantations in 2009-2010 in parts of Gujarat, Maharashtra and
   Madhya Pradesh States. To motivate farmers in the mill's catchment area,
   and to build confidence in on-farm plantations, exposure visits were
   arranged to Andhra Pradesh, where huge tracts of agricultural land were
   under leucaena plantations. As a result, to date, this unit has engaged
   >7,800 farmers who have established leucaena plantations covering an
   area of >18,400 ha. A robust plantation R\&D network addressed issues
   such as seed treatment, seed germination, rhizobial inoculation,
   geometry of plantations, agro-forestry models, selection and development
   of high production clones, establishment of clonal seed orchards,
   genetic improvement through mutation techniques and hybridization
   programs for wood quality improvement.},

   experiment was conducted under greenhouse condition in plastic pots (4
   kg). Eight treatments and eight replicates per treatment were performed
   in a completely randomized design. The treatments were: (1) complete
   treatment (C) (NPK fertilization + micronutrients + liming + MR that is
   inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia); (2) C minus N (C
   -aEuro parts per thousand N that is as C without the addition of N); (3)
   C -aEuro parts per thousand N -aEuro parts per thousand M (as C -aEuro
   parts per thousand N without inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal

   determined the yield of individual plants, nodulation, mycorrhizal
   colonization, and nutrient contents. Phosphorus was the most limiting
   nutrient for plant growth, followed by nitrogen. L. leucocephala and S.
   virgata had the most robust response to the addition of micronutrients
   and liming, showing an increase in nutrient content, plant height, and
   root and shoot dry matter. When compared to the single inoculation, the
   dual inoculation increased growth of all plants, except that of A.
   lebbeck, which did not respond to either rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungi
   inoculation.},

Title = {Defaunating capacity of tropical fodder trees:: Effects of polyethylene
   glycol and its relationship to in vitro gas production},
Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {313-327},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {The defaunating effect of multipurpose fodder trees, and the effect of
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) on this capacity, were evaluated with Acacia
   angustissima, A. gaumeri, A. farnesiana, Bursera sitnaruba, Calliandra
   calothyrsus, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Erythrina indica, E. standleyana,
   Gliricidia maculata, G. sepium, Guazuma ulmifolia, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Lysiloma latisiliquum, Piscidia piscipula and Vitex
   gaumeri. The crude protein (CP) content ranged from 112, in V gaumeri,
   to 266 g/kg dry matter (DM) in L. leucocelphala. The fodder trees with
   highest CP content were L. leucocephala (266 g/kg DM), E. indica (213),
   G. maculata (216) and G. sepiun (208). The neutral detergent fibre
   content ranged from 283 to 515 g/kg DM and ADF from 166 to 402 g/kg DM.
   In E. cyclocarpum and A. angustissima polyphenol, condensed tannins (CT)
   and saponins were detected. In vitro gas production and protozoa numbers
   were negatively correlated with CT content in the absence of PEG and, in
   both the presence (P = 0.057) and absence (P = 0.001) of PEG, with
   saponins. Saponins had a strong correlation with gas production with (P
   = 0.074) and without (P = 0.089) PEG. L. latisiliquum, B. simaruba, A.
   angustissima, C calothyrsus and A. farnesiana had CT contents higher
   than 100 g/kg DM. Addition of PEG increased gas production in A.
   angustissima, A. farnesiana, C. calothysus and L. latysiliquum, but had
   an effect on IVDMD and IVOMD in only A. angustissima and A. farnesiana.
   Protozoa counts decreased to zero by 24 h in A. farnesiana, C.
   calothyrsus, L. latisiliquum and E. cyclocarpum, and by 48 h in A.
   angustissima. Addition of PEG maintained protozoa populations up to the
   72 h in A. farnesiana, C. calothyrsus and L. latisiliquum, but not in E.
   cyclocarpum and A. angustissima, indicating an effect of saponins in
   these plants. PEG can be used to differentiate defaunating effects of CT
   from other secondary plant compounds, such as saponins. (c) 2005

Title = {Interactive Effect of Residue Quality and Agroecologies Modulate Soil C-
   and N-Cycling Enzyme Activities, Microbial Gene Abundance, and Metabolic
   Quotient},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {2024},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Understanding interactive effect of agroecology explained by rainfall,
   temperature, elevation, and biochemical composition of residues on soil
   microbial abundance and functions is crucial for unraveling soil
   ecological processes. This study aimed to investigate how agroecology
   and residue quality influence enzymatic activities, gene abundance, and
   metabolic quotient (qCO(2)). A field experiment was conducted using
   Leucaena leucocephala (LL) (high-quality residue) and Acacia decurrens
   (AD) (low-quality residue) in soils of highland and midland
   agroecologies. These residues differed in decomposability, characterized
   by a ratio of (lignin + polyphenol)/N of 5.0 for high-quality residue
   versus 21.0 for low-quality residue. Two experimental setups were
   employed: soil with litter mixture in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes and
   residues buried in the surface soil using litterbags. Soil samples were
   collected after 30, 120, and 270 days of incubation and analyzed for
   biochemical properties, enzyme activities, and the abundance of
   nitrifying and total archaea and bacteria. Soil respiration was also
   measured at different intervals in the field. qCO(2) was calculated
   using microbial biomass (MBC) and daily respiration (DCO2). Linear mixed
   model (P < 0.05) revealed that combined factors of agroecologies and
   residue qualities affected enzymatic activities, microbial abundance,
   soil properties, and qCO(2). Agroecological differences exerted a
   greater influence than residue qualities. Positive and negative
   significant correlations (P < 0.05, r = 0.27 to 0.67) were found between
   different C and N pools as well as enzymatic activities. Positive
   correlations (P < 0.05) were observed between the abundance of total
   bacteria, total archaea, and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria versus
   leucine-aminopeptidases. qCO(2) was influenced more by beta-xylosidase,
   leucine-aminopeptidases, and thermolysin-like neutral metalloproteases
   (TLP) than by beta-D-glucosidase and beta-D-cellobiohydrolase.
   Leucine-aminopeptidases and TLP were identified as rate-limiting factors
   for protein and peptide decomposition, while beta-xylosidase controlled
   hemicellulose degradation. In summary, this study provides insights into
   the intricate relationships between agroecology, residue quality,
   enzymatic activities, and microbial communities, shedding light on key
   processes governing soil ecological functions.},

Title = {Improving the Nitrogen Cycling in Livestock Systems Through
   Silvopastoral Systems},
Booktitle = {NUTRIENT DYNAMICS FOR SUSTAINABLE CROP PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Pages = {189-213},
Abstract = {Conventional livestock are monoculture systems where the major species
   are native grasses or African grasses, with biomass production being
   limited by seasonality of rainfall and low soil fertility. In animal
   production systems, the pasture degradation is associated with the
   nitrogen (N) cycle. Therefore, if farmer applied no subsequent
   fertilizer, milk production or live weight gains have been gradually
   reduced. As animals slowly gain weight, they produce more methane (CH4)
   and nitrous oxide (N(2)0). This has led to the search for strategies to
   help minimize the impacts of livestock, and the excessive application of
   fertilizers, on the environment and natural resources. One strategy with
   promising results that has been developed in Latin America is the
   conversion of traditional livestock systems to silvopastoral systems
   (SPS), which include the establishment of shrub legumes at high
   densities and forage grasses aimed at increasing livestock
   profitability. With the association of legumes and forage grasses,
   forage quality can increase, more than 100\%, compared to
   monoculture-based pastures and, consequently, production costs related
   to the purchase of imported cereal grains and nitrogen fertilizers are
   reduced. On the other hand, changes in climate and grazing pressure to
   increase stocking rate have resulted in extensive degradation of
   existing vulnerable pastures, which favour poorly palatable, perennial
   species, affecting directly livestock production and enhancing
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the loss of soil carbon and nitrogen
   stock severely affecting soil fertility. The importance of the
   association of species of legumes with grasses and Leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala L., (Lam.) de Wit) is an environmentally friendly proposal
   of positive interactions to improve soil fertility and animal
   productivity. Overall, improving forage quality and N efficiency of
   dietary nutrients is an effective way of decreasing GHG. Silvopastoral
   systems (SPS) are used successfully in many regions around the world,
   and there is considerable evidence that SPS can increase production
   efficiency, increase carbon sequestration and improve N cycling on land
   used for livestock production.},

Title = {A tannin-blocking agent does not modify the preference of sheep towards
   tannin-containing plants},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {106-111},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Sheep have been suggested to use their senses to perceive plant
   properties and associate their intake with consequences after ingestion.
   However, sheep with browsing experience do not seem to select against
   tannin-rich browsing materials in cafeteria trials. Thus, the objective
   of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the
   chemical composition, selectivity index (SI), preference and intake rate
   (IR) of tannin-containing forage trees offered to sheep in cafeteria
   experiments. Four trees were selected for their condensed tannin content
   and their varying biological activities. Havardia albicans (high
   biological activity), Leucaena leucocephala (medium biological
   activity), Acacia gaumeri (low biological activity) and Brosimum
   alicastrum (very low biological activity) were used in this study. Ten
   hair sheep (23.7 kg +/- 1.43 LW) with eight months of browsing
   experience in native vegetation were used in this study. Polyethylene
   glycol (PEG 3600 MW) was administered to five sheep during all
   experiments. In experiment 1, fresh foliage from all trees was offered
   ad libitum for 4 h. In experiment 2, B. alicastrum was withdrawn and the
   preference was determined again. The forage preference in experiment 1
   was A. gaumeri (14.77 g DM/kg LW) > B. alicastrum (11.77 g DM/kg LW) >
   H. albicans (3.71 g DM/kg LW) = L. leucocephala (1.87 g DM/kg LW) (P <
   0.05). The preference in experiment 2 was A. gaumeri > H. albicans = L
   leucocephala. PEG administration had no effect on the preference or fit
   The intake rate seemed to have been affected by the plant density.
   Moreover, fiber compounds were found to be better predictors of DM
   intake than polyphenolic compounds at levels typically found in the
   evaluated forages. It was concluded that tannins and PEG did not modify
   the preferences of sheep in cafeteria trials. Thus, tannins are not
   involved in the preference regulation of animals with browsing
   experience. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.},

Title = {Application of poultry processing industry waste: A strategy for
   vegetation growth in degraded soil},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {316-322},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The disposal of poultry processing industry waste into the environment
   without proper care, can cause contamination. Agricultural monitored
   application is an alternative for disposal, considering its high amount
   of organic matter and its potential as a soil fertilizer. This study
   aimed to evaluate the potential of poultry processing industry waste to
   improve the conditions of a degraded soil from a desertification
   hotspot, contributing to leguminous tree seedlings growth. The study was
   carried out under greenhouse conditions in a randomized blocks design
   and a 4 x 2 factorial scheme with five replicates. The treatments
   featured four amounts of poultry processing industry waste (D-1 =
   control 0 kg ha(-1); D-2 = 1020.41 kg ha(-1); D-3 = 2040.82 kg ha(-1);
   D-4 = 4081.63 kg ha(-1)) and two leguminous tree species (Mimosa
   caesalpiniaefolia Benth and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit). The
   poultry processing industry waste was composed of poultry blood, grease,
   excrements and substances from the digestive system. Plant height,
   biomass production, plant nutrient accumulation and soil organic carbon
   were measured forty days after waste application. Leguminous tree
   seedlings growth was increased by waste amounts, especially M.
   caesalpiniaefolia Benth, with height increment of 29.5 cm for the waste
   amount of 1625 kg ha(-1), and L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, with
   maximum height increment of 20 cm for the waste amount of 3814.3 kg
   ha(-1). M. caesalpiniaefolia Benth had greater initial growth, as well
   as greater biomass and nutrient accumulation compared with L.
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. However, belowground biomass was similar
   between the evaluated species, resulting in higher root/shoot ratio for
   L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Soil organic carbon did not show
   significant response to waste amounts, but it did to leguminous tree
   seedlings growth, especially L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. Poultry
   processing industry waste contributes to leguminous tree seedlings
   growth, indicating that it can be part of a long-term strategy to
   increase soil organic carbon in degraded soil from a desertification
   hotspot. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {46},

Pages = {197-212},
Abstract = {In a long-term study (1980 to 1993), the survival, growth performance
   and biomass production of two grass species viz. Chrysopogon fulvus
   (Spreng.) Chiov. and Eulaliopsis binata (Retz.) C.E. Hubb. were assessed
   when intercropped with four tree species viz. Albizia lebbek (L.)
   Benth., Grewia optiva Drumm., Bauhinia purpurea L. and Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lamk.) de Wit. on the bouldery riverbed lands of Doon
   Valley of north-west India. The survival of grass clumps was higher
   under the canopy of B. purpurea (48.3\% in 1993 of the initial planting
   density of 20,000 clumps ha(-1) in 1980) and G. optiva (47.4\%) than of
   L. leucocephala (31.1\%) and A. lebbek (29.4\%), and at 75\% intensity
   of tree lopping (40.9\%) than at 50\% (37.1\%). The effect of tree
   species on different growth parameters of grasses was not uniform, with
   G. optiva and B. purpurea causing comparatively more synergistic effect
   on clump height and clump diameter respectively. Although the
   performance of grasses was good under A. lebbek and L. leucocephala in
   the early years (1980-1987), these tree species resulted in the lowest
   grass dry weight in the later years up to 1993. The beneficial effect of
   higher lopping intensity of 75\% was observed on the growth and biomass
   production of grasses over 50\% lopping, presumably due to increased
   light penetration into the under-storey. The biomass production of
   grasses reached a maximum at four years of growth in 1983, after which,
   it decreased gradually to less than half in 1993. Eulaliopsis binata
   showed higher survival, growth and biomass production than C. fulvus
   throughout the period of study. The total biomass production was highest
   in association with B. purpurea followed by G. optiva, which appeared to
   be the most suitable tree species along with E. binata for sustainable
   silvopasture development on the marginal lands of Doon Valley of
   north-west India.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {There is a very high potential for forage growth during summer in the
   tropics and subtropics, but there are many problems associated with
   realising this potential in terms of milk production. The tropical
   grasses are capable of yielding 50t DM/ha/yr, though in practice yield
   is less than one-third of this, and the high structural fibre and low
   protein contents of these grasses severely restrict milk production
   during autumn. Twining tropical pasture legumes are unstable under
   commercial stocking rates and effort is now directed to species suited
   to heavy grazing, such as Pinto peanut (Arachis pintoi cv. Amarillo) and
   lotus (Lotus pedunculatus cv. Maku), and browse shrubs such as leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala). Lucerne (Medicago sativa) is recognised as an
   outstanding forage for grazing or conservation, but present varieties
   are unsuited to most soil types on dairy farms.
   Water use efficiency is a high priority for research into summer forage
   crops. In dryland areas forage and grain sorghums (Sorghum spp.) are
   used to maximise dry matter production with limited moisture supply.
   There is a strong trend towards maize (Zea mays) for silage in irrigated
   areas, and areas requiring further research include delineation of areas
   suited to the crop, agronomy and integration into farming systems.
   Legume crops promote higher intakes than grass crops, though at present
   there is heavy dependence on Lablab purpureus varieties developed over
   20 years ago. Other crop legumes, including the soybeans, may be useful,
   particularly if combined with water-efficient cultural practices.
   There is general concern at the cost of fertiliser inputs and their fate
   once they leave the pasture-soil complex. In particular, efficient
   methods of using nitrogen fertiliser are required. As the forage systems
   for the tropics and subtropics develop there will be a greater emphasis
   on quality of forage, emphasising characteristics such as low structural
   fibre content, high protein content, low degradability of protein in the
   rumen, a favourable amino acid composition of protein, and adequate
   mineral content.},

Abstract = {Three harvest frequencies (based on attained plant height), 3 population
   densities and 2 plant types of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit) were evaluated at North Kohala, Hawaii {[}USA] (120 m elevation,
   Typic Ustropept). Plants of K341 (a shrubby Hawaiian type) and K8 (an
   arboreal Salvador type) were grown at spacings of 15 .times. 50, 30
   .times. 50 and 45 .times. 50 cm, and harvested when plants attained
   average heights of 55, 105 or 155 cm. Stem elongation rates and yields
   were highest during periods of high solar radiation and high night
   temperature. Selection K341 tended to flower at an early stage,
   especially at the lower planting densities, with consequent reduction in
   vegetative growth. Selection K8 increased in height more rapidly than
   K341 and thereby intercepted more sunlight until about 14 wk when light
   interception values were similar at 96\%. Yields increased with less
   frequent cutting. Total dry matter yields when cut at attained heights
   of 55, 105 and 155 cm (about 2 1/2, 3 and 4 mo. growth duration) were
   11.9, 16.9 and 20.8 metric tons/ha, respectively. However, the
   percentage forage fraction was higher under more frequent cutting;
   averaging 79, 68 and 59\% for the same 3 treatments. Percentage forage
   fraction also tended to be slightly higher at the highest plant density,
   since leucaena was unable to compensate for wide spacing by producing
   more shoots. Plant type, spacing and cutting treatments did not affect
   the levels of N or mimosine in the forage fraction (4.3 and 6.7\%,
   respectively) or in the stem fraction (1.5 or 0.9\%, respectively). K341
   yielded nearly 600 kg N ha-1 yr-1, in the forage fraction while K8
   yielded about 500 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Dense planting (15 .times. 50 cm) and
   cutting when the plants were approximately 1 m in height were desirable
   management practices considering forage yield, percentage forage
   fraction, forage quality, flowering behavior and average cutting

Title = {Twenty-one years' impact of using organic amendments on the productivity
   of rice-wheat rotation and soil properties},
Journal = {FIELD CROPS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {309},

Abstract = {Shifting from chemical -intensive practices to organic -based farming
   within the rice -wheat rotation (RWR) is crucial for its long-term
   sustainability. This highly productive system holds a significant carbon
   (C) sequestration potential if managed efficiently. The dynamics of soil
   organic -C profoundly impacts the global climate change and crops'
   productivity, necessitating the continuous monitoring of organic carbon
   to ensure soil vitality. Hence, we have evaluated the long-term
   (twenty-one years) impact of organic amendments on yields of the RWR,
   soil properties and C -dynamics. After 21 years, we observed that
   organic -based amendments increased the rice and wheat grain yields by
   33.4-52.5\% and 20-42.8\%, respectively, over the control (no organics).
   On an average, in top 0.0-0.15 m soil layer, the organic-manured plots
   had 21.6\%, 21.3\% and 23.4\% greater available nitrogen (N),
   phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) over the control plot, respectively.
   Furthermore, such organic-manured plots recorded 32.9-50.8\% and
   6.04-32.3\% greater microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dehydrogenase
   activity (DHA) over the control. Also, the use of organic amendments had
   a significant (p <= 0.05) and positive impact on the soil carbon
   dynamics (0.0-0.45 m). In 0.0-0.45 m soil depth, the organic-manured
   treatments registered a 25.9-44.2\% greater total organic carbon (TOC)
   than the control. These treatments improved the active (labile, very
   labile) and recalcitrant (less labile, non -labile) -C pools especially
   in upper soil layers. In summary, the synergistic use of Sesbania green
   manure, Leucaena leucocephala leaf manuring, farmyard manure, and
   biofertilizers (blue-green algae/ Azotobacter etc.) proves effective in
   restoring soil health and enhancing crop productivity by increasing soil
   organic carbon and ensuring nutrients availability. Thus, these organic
   amendment treatments can be advocated to farmers to sustain the
   productivity of the rice -wheat ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Alien species pose a potential threat to biodiversity, necessitating
   vigilant monitoring to inform effective control strategies and prevent
   their invasiveness. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate
   the impact of alien species on the richness, horizontal structure, and
   diversity of the tree-shrub layer within a Cerrado-Pantanal transition
   region fragment. A floristic census was conducted across a fragment of
   approximately 3.0 ha, measuring all individuals with an aboveground
   diameter (DAG) >= 5.0 cm. The study assessed the statistical
   significance of diversity variation in the presence and absence of alien
   species using the Hutcheson t-test and examined the correlation between
   the proportion of alien species and various community parameters through
   Pearson's correlation. The findings revealed a total of 84 species
   belonging to 34 families, with a total of 2218 recorded individuals.
   Notably, eight species (9.52\%) were identified as alien, distributed
   across five families. Among the alien species, Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) de Wit exhibited the highest importance value. However, the
   analysis indicated that the presence of alien species did not yield a
   significant variation in diversity, as demonstrated by the applied test
   with a 5.0\% probability level, at both the plot and community levels.
   Moreover, the correlation analysis indicated that the community
   variables exhibited a low association with the proportion of individuals
   belonging to alien species. Specifically, the correlation decreased in
   the following order: Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index, density of native
   species, basal area of native species, and richness of native species.
   The observed low correlation coefficients (r) and nonsignificant
   p-values (p < 0.05) suggested that the presence of alien species did not
   exert a significant influence on the richness, structure, and diversity
   of the tree-shrub layer within the studied fragment. This outcome was
   likely facilitated by the absence of dominant populations of alien
   species. Thus, the study concludes that, at least within this specific
   context, alien species do not exert a significant influence on the
   assessed community parameters.},

Title = {Transcriptional Analyses of Genes Related to Fodder Qualities in Giant
   Leucaena Under Different Stress Environments},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala subsp. glabrata (giant leucaena) is a tree legume,
   whose foliage is used as a fodder for animals because of its high
   protein content. In spite of being a highly nutritious fodder, giant
   leucaena foliage has two undesirable secondary metabolites, mimosine and
   tannin. The amounts of mimosine and tannin in giant leucaena foliage are
   known to vary under different environmental conditions. Giant leucaena
   was grown under different salinity, pH and nitrogen availability
   conditions. It produced the highest amounts of mimosine at pH 6.0-7.0,
   whereas, variation in soil pH did not affect tannin concentrations.
   Salinity stress had negative effects on both mimosine and tannin
   concentrations, while nitrogen abundance promoted both mimosine and
   tannin production. Seven genes for mimosine and tannin metabolism were
   isolated from a transcriptome library of giant leucaena. These were
   mimosine synthase, mimosinase, chalcone synthase, flavanone 3
   beta-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol reductase, leucoanthocyanidin
   reductase, and anthocyanidin reductase. The highest level of mimosine
   synthase activity was observed in the absence of salt in the soils.
   Mimosine synthase activities had strong positive correlation with
   mimosine concentrations in the foliage (R-2 = 0.78) whereas mimosinase
   expression did not appear to have a direct relationship with salt
   concentrations. The expression of mimosine synthase was significantly
   higher in the leucaena foliage under nitrogen abundant condition than in
   nitrogen deficiency conditions, while mimosinase expression was
   significantly higher under nitrogen deficiency condition than in
   nitrogen abundance conditions. Mimosine concentrations in the foliage
   were positively correlated with the expression levels of mimosine
   synthase but not mimosinase. Similarly, the concentrations of tannin
   were positively correlated with expression levels of dihydroflavonol
   reductase, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, and anthocyanidin reductase.
   Understanding of the environmental conditions that promote or inhibit
   transcription of the genes for mimosine and tannin biosynthesis should
   help to design environmental conditions that inhibit transcription of
   these genes, resulting in reduced levels of these compounds in the
   leucaena foliage.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is native to Mexico and Central America
   and is currently naturalized in the majority of Latin American
   countries. Over the last 2 decades, considerable research and promotion
   of leucaena have been carried out in Colombia, Mexico, Cuba, Brazil,
   Paraguay and Argentina. Research focused on the agronomic and management
   options for feeding beef, dairy or dual-purpose animals, with some
   studies on germplasm, weediness issues, toxicity, organic fertilizer
   application and environmental services.
   Over the past 10-15 years, establishment and management of leucaena
   feeding systems in Latin America have varied according to country. For
   instance, intensive Silvopastoral Systems (iSPS) models are widely
   promoted and successfully adopted in Colombia, Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela
   and Northeast Brazil. In iSPS, leucaena is planted at high density
   (>10,000 trees/ha), in combination with improved tropical grass and
   high-value timber species (200-400 trees/ha), and intensively managed
   employing rotational grazing.
   In Paraguay and Argentina, leucaena is planted in single or double
   hedgerows with inter-row alleys of 6-8 m, following the configuration
   used in Australia and mainly focused on beef production. In Mexico,
   leucaena is also cultivated with Tithonia diversifolia or lemon trees.
   Meanwhile, in other countries such as Cuba, leucaena has been
   established as protein banks using single/twin rows with inter-row
   spacing of 2-4 m for feeding beef, dairy or dual-purpose animals.
   Overall, paddock sizes for protein banks and iSPS range between 0.3 and
   50 ha, while single and twin hedgerow systems are generally established
   over larger areas (20-500 ha). Despite the significant benefits
   demonstrated by research on leucaena feeding systems over the past 2
   decades, coupled with successful outcomes for farmers who have adopted
   these systems, total area sown remains low across Latin America. This
   review provides a comparison between Latin American and Australian
   leucaena pasture systems, and recommendations for future collaborative
   research between countries.},

Abstract = {Phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated sites using trees may be
   preferred over crops due to capacity of trees to accumulate heavy metals
   in the wood which is biologically non-hazardous. An investigation was
   undertaken to assess the cadmium (Cd) phytoextraction potential of four
   multipurpose tree species viz. eucalyptus (Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm.),
   subabul {[}Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit], dhrek (Melia azedarach
   L.) and shisham (Dalbergia sissoo Roxb.) at six rates of Cd applied in
   solution form through CdCl2 center dot H2O (0, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 120 mg
   Cd kg(-1) soil) and harvested after 18 months of growth in an alkaline
   loamy sand soil in earthen pots. Dry matter (DM) of leaves, stems and
   roots, Cd content of these constituents and that of soil before planting
   and after harvesting the tree species were determined. Subabul had the
   highest and eucalyptus the lowest total DM production at all levels of
   Cd. Total DM did not decrease significantly up to application of 40 mg
   Cd kg(-1) soil (P > 0.05). The highest Cd level resulted in 49, 41, 26
   and 43\% reduction in total DM of eucalyptus, subabul, dhrek and
   shisham, respectively over control. Cadmium concentration was higher in
   leaves whereas uptake was higher in stems than the other components.
   Subabul had significantly highest uptake (0.05-71.4 mg pot(-1)) of Cd at
   various levels due its higher biomass whereas shisham had the lowest
   (0.05-28.2 mg pot(-1)) (P 0.05). Available Cd in the soil after
   harvesting of plants was the lowest in subabul and the highest in
   shisham pots. The upper critical level of available Cd in the soil at
   20\% reduction in DM was the highest for dhrek (85 mg kg(-1)) and the
   lowest for eucalyptus (46 mg kg(-1)). Therefore, dhrek was more tolerant
   to Cd but subabul had the greatest potential for phytoextraction of Cd
   from the soil.},

Abstract = {Survival, emergence, and branch girdling by Oncideres pustulata LeConte
   on huisache, Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd., and leucaena, Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit, the preferred host plants, were compared in
   field studies in northeastern Mexico during 2003-2005. Most mortality of
   medium- to large-sized larvae was attributed to predation by birds,
   while small larvae were killed by cold temperatures (<4 degrees C)
   during the winter of 2004. Birds observed preying upon O. pustulata were
   the bronzed cowbird, Molothrus aeneus (Wagler), and red-winged
   blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus L. Predation by birds was two to three
   times greater on leucaena than huisache, probably because of the softer
   wood of leucaena. Consequently, emergence of adults from huisache was
   50-80\% greater than from leucaena. The relationship between cumulative
   emergence rate and time was sigmoidal (r(2) = 0.99), with 50\% emerging
   during early October, irrespective of host plant or year. The sex ratio
   of emerging adults throughout the study was skewed toward females
   (1.6:1) regardless of host plant or year. The relationship between
   cumulative rates of branch girdling and time was also sigmoidal (r(2) >=
   0.98) with no significant difference between host plants. The number of
   branches girdled per tree ranged from 4.6 in 2003 to 0.1 in 2005 as a
   consequence of the impact of subfreezing temperatures during the
   previous winter. Although the number of branches girdled by O. pustulata
   was similar in both host plants, the average diameter of girdled twigs
   was significantly greater in leucaena (2.8 cm) than huisache (2.2 cm),
   probably because of the softer wood of leucaena. O. pustulata
   successfully utilized both huisache and leucaena as host plants.
   However, our results suggested that more O. pustulata survived and
   emerged on huisache. This probably is because of less predation by birds
   on larvae in huisache because of its harder wood, as compared to
   leucaena.},

Volume = {87},

Abstract = {A combination of human, climatic, geomorphological and pedological
   factors has led to extensive degradation of the soils of the Cabo Verde
   Islands. To survive in fragile conditions, the stabilisation of the
   farming systems and the maintenance of high and sustainable yields have
   become absolute priorities for farmers. The project described here is
   part of a programme of water resource optimisation on the island of
   Santiago in a semi-arid mountainous area near Godim. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the influence of two conservation techniques
   (light mulching with maize (Zea mays L.) haulms and hedging with bushes
   and grass) on runoff, erosion and phytomass production under natural
   rainfall. The main data were collected on five runoff plots of 100 m(2)
   and 10 pairs of 4 m2 plots scattered over the hillslope. Although,
   rainfall erosivity was higher than in Sahelian areas, runoff occurred
   only for rainfall higher than 40 mm and intensities over 40 mm/h. Soil
   losses reached 12 mm/year on bare plots, 48 min with traditional crops,
   3.1 mm, with hedges and less than 0.03 mm under mulching on 50\% slopes.
   This study confirmed that mulching alone, or associated with the
   plantation of hedges, reduces runoff and erosion on the steep slopes of
   the Cabo Verde mountains. However, the ability to improve the use of the
   water resources by grain-producing crops in semi-arid regions was
   questionable. Plant material for mulching was only available and
   efficient during the wet years. The efficiency was therefore irregular
   and depended on the abundance of rainfall, weed production and the
   degree of satisfaction of plant water and nutrient requirements at the
   critical moment when the crops are in flower. Hedges of Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit or Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth (Congo pea),
   without ditches or banks, planted on the flat and mulched could
   contribute to the supply of fodder in the dry season as well as blocking
   rivulet runoff and erosion in the Sahelian area. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {Silvopastoral systems can be a good alternative for sustainable
   livestock production because they can provide ecosystem services and
   improve animal welfare. Most farm animals live in groups and the social
   organization and interactions between individuals have an impact on
   their welfare. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe
   and compare the social behaviour of cattle (Bos indicus x Bos taurus) in
   a silvopastoral system based on a high density of leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala) combined with guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus), star
   grass (Cynodon nlenfuensis) and some trees; with a monoculture system
   with C. nlemfuensis, in the region of Merida, Yucatan. Eight heifers in
   each system were observed from 0730 to 1530 h each day for 12
   consecutive days during the thy season and 12 consecutive days during
   the rainy season. The animals followed a rotation between three
   paddocks, remaining 4 days in each paddock. The vegetation was
   characterized in the paddocks of the silvopastoral system to estimate
   the average percentage of shade provided. To make a comparison between
   systems, we used a t test with group dispersion, and Mann Whitney tests
   with the frequency of affiliative and agonistic behaviours. We assessed
   differences in linearity and stability of dominance hierarchies using
   Landau's index and Dietz R-test, respectively. The distance of cows with
   respect to the centroid of the group was shorter, and non-agonistic
   behaviours were 62\% more frequent in the intensive silvopastoral system
   than in the monoculture one. Heifers in the silvopastoral system had a
   more linear and non-random dominance hierarchy in both seasons (thy
   season: h' = 0.964; rainy season: h' = 0.988), than heifers in the
   monoculture system (thy season: h' = 0.571, rainy season: h' = 0.536).
   The dominance hierarchy in the silvopastoral system was more stable
   between seasons (R-test = 0.779) than in the monoculture system (R-test
   = 0224). Our results provide the first evidence that heifers in the
   silvopastoral system maintain more stable social hierarchies and express
   more sociopositive behaviours, suggesting that animal welfare was
   enhanced.},

Abstract = {Rhizobia are nitrogen-fixing bacteria that establish endosymbiotic
   associations with legumes. Nodule formation depends on various bacterial
   carbohydrates, including lipopolysaccharides, K-antigens, and
   exopolysaccharides (EPS). An acidic EPS from Rhizobium sp. strain NGR234
   consists of glucosyl (Gic), galactosyl (Gal), glucuronosyl (GlcA), and
   4,6-pyruvylated galactosyl (PvGal) residues with beta-1,3, beta-1,4,
   beta-1,6, alpha-1,3, and alpha-1,4 glycoside linkages. Here we examined
   the role of NGR234 genes in the synthesis of EPS. Deletions within the
   exoF, exoL, exoP, exoQ, and exoY genes suppressed accumulation of EPS in
   bacterial supernatants, a finding that was confirmed by chemical
   analyses. The data suggest that the repeating subunits of EPS are
   assembled by an ExoQ/ExoP/ExoF-dependent mechanism, which is related to
   the Wzy polymerization system of group 1 capsular polysaccharides in
   Escherichia coli. Mutation of exoK (NGR Omega exoK), which encodes a
   putative glycanase, resulted in the absence of low-molecular-weight
   forms of EPS. Analysis of the extracellular carbohydrates revealed that
   NGR Omega exoK is unable to accumulate exo-oligosaccharides (EOSs),
   which are O-acetylated nonasaccharide subunits of EPS having the formula
   Gal(Glc)(5)(GlcA)(2)PvGal. When used as inoculants, both the
   exo-deficient mutants and NGR Omega exoK were unable to form
   nitrogen-fixing nodules on some hosts (e.g., Albizia lebbeck and
   Leucaena leucocephala), but they were able to form nitrogen-fixing
   nodules on other hosts (e.g., Vigna unguiculata). EOSs of the parent
   strain were biologically active at very low levels (yield in culture
   supernatants, similar to 50 mu g per liter). Thus, NGR234 produces
   symbiotically active EOSs by enzymatic degradation of EPS, using the
   extracellular endo-beta-1,4-glycanase encoded by exoK (glycoside
   hydrolase family 16). We propose that the derived EOSs (and not EPS) are
   bacterial components that play a crucial role in nodule formation in
   various legumes.},

Abstract = {The bark of trees is an abundant material for chemical by-products. The
   combination effects of different concentrations of Acer saccharum var.
   saccharum inner (IB) and outer (OB) bark acetone extracts with citric
   acid (CA) applied to Leucaena leucocephala wood were evaluated against
   the growth of three common molds (Trichoderma viride, Fusarium
   subglutinans, and Aspergillus niger). IB, OB, and CA solutions were
   prepared at 0.25\% and 0.5\% and their combinations were formulated in
   equal amounts. Acetone extracts of IB and OB were analyzed for their
   chemicals composition and phenolic compounds using GC/MS and PHLC,
   respectively. The IB acetone extract contained
   4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone (31.67\%), palmitic acid (15.52\%), and
   linoleic acid (11.14\%), while the OB acetone extract contained
   1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(2-ethylhexyl) ester (9.34\%),
   (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadien-1-ol (8.86\%), and
   cis-tetrahydro-6-methoxy-2H-pyran-3-ol (5.72\%). The HPLC analysis
   indicated the presence of 14 phenolic compounds in IB extract with major
   constituents caffeine (362.88 mu g/g extract), and p-hydroxy benzoic
   acid (358.06 mu g/g extract), while OB contained 12 compounds with major
   constituents p-hydroxy benzoic acid (8950.5 mu g/g extract), gallic acid
   (5261 mu g/g extract) and salicylic acid (572.38 mu g/g extract). High
   total phenolic content in OB (292.67 mg GAE/g) was associated with high
   antioxidant activity with an IC50 values of 1.77 and 4.14 mu g/mL, as
   measured by DPPH and beta-Carotene-linoleic acid, respectively. The
   combination treatment of IB0.25\%+ OB0.25\%+CA0.25\% produced the
   highest antifungal effects against growth of T. viride with an
   inhibition percentage (IP) of 10.37\%, IB0.5\%+CA0.5\% (IP 16.66\%) with
   F. subglutinans, while CA0.5\% and OB0.25\%, showed IP of 27.77\% and
   23.70\% with A. niger, respectively. The combination effects of IB, OB
   and CA could be used as biocide agents for preventing mold growth on
   wood.},

Abstract = {Where there is limited availability of conventional fertilizers, the use
   of organic materials is considered a viable alternative to increase the
   productive capacity of soils. Many potential plant residues remain
   underutilized due to limited research on their use as a nutrient source.
   In this study, the nitrogen supplying capabilities of ten rarely-used
   leaf biomass sources (Acacia auriculiformis, Baphia nitida, Albizia
   zygia, Azadirachta indica, Senna siamea, Senna spectabilis, Tithonia
   diversifolia, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Zea mays)
   were tested based on their nutrient content, N mineralization patterns
   and effect on maize yield (in comparison with inorganic fertilizer). N
   mineralization was studied in the laboratory using an incubation
   experiment. Field trials were also established using a randomized
   complete block design. Plant residues were applied at 5 t dry matter
   ha(-1) a week before planting maize while fertilizer was split-applied
   at 90 kg N ha(-1) on designated plots. From the results on plant residue
   chemistry, most of the plant residues recorded relatively high N
   concentration (24.9 g kg(-1)) and low C/N ratio (20.1) although neither
   N content nor C/N ratio significantly (p > 0.05) affected their N
   mineralization patterns. Leaf biomass application of B. nitida, A.
   auriculiformis, A. zygia and maize stover resulted in an initial net N
   immobilization that lasted for 14 days. Application of all plant
   materials significantly increased the biological yield and N uptake of
   maize with G. sepium and T. diversifolia producing the greatest impact
   especially in the major rainy season. Relative to the control, total
   grain yield after four cropping seasons was comparable between inorganic
   fertilizer (9.2 t ha(-1)), G. sepium (8.8 t ha(-1)) and T. diversifolia
   (9.4 t ha(-1)) treatments. The results on maize biological yield were
   significantly correlated with the effects of the treatments on N uptake.
   The findings suggest that in locations where inorganic fertilizers are
   limited, leaf biomass from G. sepium and T. diversifolia could offer the
   most suitable option in comparison with the other species used in this
   study.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-9},
Abstract = {Experiments have promise in determining mechanisms by which communities
   resist invasion. Growth and survivorship of transplanted seedlings of
   introduced tree species (Leucaena leucocephala, Muntingia calabura,
   Adenanthera pavonia, and Clausena excavata) were used to assess abiotic
   (light regime) and biotic resistance (herbivory) to invasion of
   rainforest on Christmas Island (Indian Ocean). At four sites, seedlings
   were transplanted into the forest edge along roadside verges and into
   adjacent intact forest; half were caged to prevent access by the
   dominant seedling consumer, the red land crab (Gecarcoidea natalis). Red
   crab densities did not differ between roadside and forest plots. Red
   crabs initially reduced survivorship of Leucaena in both edge and
   interior plots but virtually all seedlings in the forest interior were
   dead after 41 weeks. Survivorship of Muntingia was also initially
   reduced by crabs in the forest edge, but again, all but one seedling
   died by the end of the experiment. Seedlings of Adenanthera and Clausena
   fared much better overall, surviving well in both locations. Red crabs
   had no overall effect on Adenanthera survival but significantly reduced
   survival of Clausena in forest plots. For both species, seedling
   performance was greater in the forest edge than in the forest interior.
   Red crabs had no effect on height increment for either species; however.
   for Clausena, red crabs reduced seedling mass in the forest interior.
   Both Adenanthera and Clausena were able to persist in the intact forest.
   Clausena is now actively invading intact rainforest, but Adenanthera
   appears dispersal-limited. Resistance factors in intact forest appear
   hierarchical: biotic resistance afforded by land crabs can impede
   establishment of some plant invaders but seedling responses to abiotic
   factors (e.g., the light regime) largely overwhelm its effect. Together,
   these two community attributes are likely to restrict the range of plant
   invaders to a small suite of species that can successfully establish in
   intact rainforest on the island. However, increased propagule pressure
   from a variety of shade-tolerant species and further declines in the
   abundance of the dominant seedling consumer may lead to increasing
   invasion success in this island rainforest.},

Volume = {93},

Abstract = {Allelopathy is considered a major cause of biodiversity reduction in
   Eucalyptus plantations. Eucalyptus can produce allelochemicals through
   various ways, such as volatilization and root exudation. However, there
   are few studies of the roles of rain leachates in mediating eucalyptus
   allelopathy. Thus, we conducted a greenhouse experiment to assess the
   allelopathic effects of rain leachates from Eucalyptus urophylla on some
   vital traits of three native (Leucaena leucocephala, Pterospermum
   lanceaefolium, and Schefflera octophylla) and one introduced (Albizia
   lebbeck) tree species. We compared the effects of rain leachates from E.
   urophylla foliage, litter, and foliage+litter. To identify specific
   chemicals from rain leachates that can mediate allelopathy, we used gas
   chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to isolate and
   determine allelochemicals from leachates. The results showed that litter
   leachates and foliage+litter leachates significantly inhibited seed
   germination of L. leucocephala, P. lanceaefolium, and S. octophylla. The
   inhibitory effects on seed germination of litter leachates alone were
   relatively stronger than that of foliage+litter leachates; however,
   foliage leachates alone did not inhibit seed germination and seedling
   survival, except for P. lanceaefolium. We also did not find significant
   negative effects of rain leachates on biomass, root length, and shoot
   length of the target species; foliage+litter and foliage leachates even
   increased fresh weight and dry weight of L. leucocephala and S.
   octophylla, respectively. Seedling survivorship was lower under the
   leachate treatments for all the target species except A. lebbeck. GC-MS
   analysis suggested that phenol acids, ester, alkanes, and alcohol are
   the main components in leachates. The diversity and content of
   allelochemical components detected in litter leachates and
   foliage+litter leachates were much higher than foliage leachates. We
   concluded that rain leachates from E. urophylla primarily cast a
   negative impact on seed germination and seedling survival of the
   receptor species, and allelopathy of E urophylla may be partly
   responsible for the loss of understory species. Different sources of
   rain leachates vary significantly in their inhibitory effects, and rain
   leachates from litter are likely to be an important pathway of
   allelopathy.},

   application of 25 kg N ha(-1) through crop residue (CR, byre waste)
   along with 25 kg N ha(-1) through Leucaena lopping (Leucaena
   leucocephala) to rabi sorghum gave significantly higher grain and stover
   yield and Sustainable Yield Index (14.61 and 36.11 q ha(-1) and 0.47,
   respectively) which was on par with T-7, where 25 kg N ha(-1) through

   grain and stover yield (13.95 and 34.46 q ha(-1) and 0.44,

   were also influenced significantly due to integrated nitrogen management
   (Rs. 59,796, Rs. 47,353 ha(-1), and 3.13, respectively). This was also
   reflected in residual soil fertility status of soil after harvest of
   rabi sorghum. The organic carbon content and available nitrogen content
   of soil, as well as nitrogen uptake and moisture use efficiency for
   grain, were also increased. The total microbial count of bacteria,
   fungi, and actinomycetes was more where FYM or CR addition was done. The
   count of N fixers and P solubilizers was more under Leucaena application
   either alone or with CR or urea. Application of CR at 4.8 t ha(-1) (25
   kg N ha(-1)) along with Leucaena lopping at 3.5 t ha(-1) (25 kg N

Abstract = {Two experiments were designed to investigate the effect of legume
   tree-pods and ensiling on the intake and relative palatability of six
   feeds by goats and sheep. In the first experiment, the feeds offered
   were pasture hay (Themeda triandra), alfalfa ( Medicago sativa), pods of
   Acacia sieberiana, Acacia nilotica and Leucaena leucocephala. In the
   second, silage from the pods of A. sieberiana was included as the sixth
   feed in order to examine the effect of ensiling on intake and
   palatability since this process was devised as a means of detoxifying
   cyanogenic glocosides known to be present in the leaves and pods of this
   species. Intake (Ti) and relative palatability ( Pi) were determined
   using 3 goats and 3 sheep in each experiment. Since the feeds had
   different dry matter contents, intake was expressed as a ratio of the
   quantity offered (Ti/Ai). Using the hay offered (A1) and intake (T1), as
   standard, relative palatability indices were calculated as Pi = (
   Ti/Ai)/(T1/A1) where i represented the other feeds. In experiment 1,
   goats consumed more hay than alfalfa or pods. Sheep consumed more
   leucaena than all the other feeds. In experiment 2, the intake of all
   feeds except nilotica increased over time. Hay and leucaena had the
   highest Pi for goats and sheep, respectively, in experiment 1. In
   experiment 2, silage from pods of A. sieberiana had the highest Pi while
   the ranking for goats remained unchanged. The nilotica meal had the
   lowest Pi in both experiments. Pi was affected ( p < 0.0001) only by
   feed type in experiment 1 but in experiment 2, feed type, animal species
   and weight significantly ( p < 0.01) affected Pi. The results show that
   the pods of L. leucocephala and A. nilotica were the most and least
   preferred by goats and sheep, respectively, and that ensiling
   significantly improved the intake and palatability of the pods of A.
   sieberiana. However, some feeds that are least preferred in times of
   abundance and variety could be relished during periods of scarcity and
   severe feed shortages, based on animal survival instinct.},

Abstract = {The mineralization of sulfur (S) was investigated in a Vertisol and an
   Inceptisol amended with organic manures, green manures, and crop
   residues. Field-moist soils amended with 10 g kg(-1) of organic
   materials were mixed with glass beads, placed in pyrex leaching tubes,
   leached with 0.01 M CaCl2 to remove the mineral S and incubated at 30
   degreesC. The leachates were collected every fortnight for 16 weeks and
   analzyed for SO4-S. The amount of S mineralized in control and in
   manure-amended soils was highest in the first week and decreased
   steadily thereafter. The total S mineralized in amended soils varied
   considerably depending on the type of organic materials incorporated and
   soil used. The cumulative amounts of S mineralized in amended soils
   ranged from 6.98 mg S (kg soil)(-1) in Inceptisol amended with wheat
   straw to 34.38 mg S (kg soil)(-1) in Vertisol amended with farmyard
   manure (FYM). Expressed as a percentage of the S added to soils, the S
   mineralized was higher in FYM treated soils (63.5 to 67.3 \%) as
   compared to poultry manure a-mended soils (60.5 to 62.3 \%). Similarly
   the percentage of S mineralization from subabul (Leucaena leucocephala)
   loppings was higher (53.6 to 55.5 \%) than that from gliricidia
   (Gliricidia sepium) loppings (50.3 to 51.1 \%). Regression analysis
   clearly indicated the dependence of S mineralization on the C : S ratio
   of the organic materials added to soil. The addition of organic
   amendments resulted in net immobilization of S when the C : S ratio was
   above 290:1 in Vertisol and 349:1 in Inceptisol. The mineralizable S
   pool (S-o) and first-order rate constant (k) varied considerably among
   the different types of organic materials added and soil. The S,, values
   of FYM treated soils were higher than in subabul, gliricidia, and

Abstract = {The high nutritive value of Leucaena leucocephala forage is well
   documented, but little is known about the forage quality of other taxa
   in the genus. Preliminary in vitro evaluations of the chemical
   composition of the Leucaena genus, to identify accessions worthy of
   further evaluation, were conducted in Honduras by the Oxford Forestry
   Institute and in Australia by the University of Queensland. In vitro dry
   matter digestibility (IVDMD), condensed tannin (CT), crude protein (CP),
   neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and mineral composition measured in the
   Australian trial are presented and discussed in the context of the
   results of the Honduran study. Direct comparison of the data generated
   at both sites was confounded by differences in environment, sample
   tissue and laboratory procedures, although it was possible to compare
   the ranking of taxa at the two sites. The IVDMD of the genus was high
   compared to other tropical forages, ranging from 42-70\%. There was
   considerable variation in CT content within taxa and across the genus
   (undetectable - 31\% DM). The CP content (15-40\% DM) of the genus
   exceeded recommended concentrations for ruminants. However, CP
   digestibility and IVDMD may be reduced in accessions containing high
   concentrations of CT. Generally low NDF contents (15-38\% DM) were
   observed. All Leucaena spp. contained adequate levels of the essential
   elements measured, except Na and Cu. Many were marginal in Mg. Based on
   chemical composition, there were a number of taxa with the potential to
   exceed the excellent forage quality of L, leucocephala, including L.
   collinsii, L. lanceolata, L. lempirana, L. macrophylla, L. magnifica, L.
   shannonii, and L. trichodes. A number of limitations to the
   interpretation of in vitro analyses were identified, including the use
   of different sampling tissue, sample preparation and laboratory
   techniques, and the possibility of environmental effects on plant
   chemical composition. The effects of environmental factors, such as soil
   nutrient deficiency, water stress, temperature, and insecticide
   phytotoxicity, on the CT content of the Leucaena genus were discussed.
   Future research priorities were identified.},

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted to investigate the efficacy of a cultured
   Synergistes jonesii inoculum in degrading the Leucaena leucocephala
   (leucaena) toxins: 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridone and 3-hydroxy-2(1H)-pyridone
   (3,4- and 2,3-DHP). Sixteen stall-housed Bos indicus steers naive to
   leucaena were fed varying combinations of forage-harvested leucaena and
   Chloris gayana (Rhodes grass). Dietary treatments, offered at 25 g dry
   matter/kg LW.day, were: 25\% leucaena; 50\% leucaena; 100\% leucaena;
   and 50\% leucaena, switched to 50\% Medicago sativa (lucerne) after 6
   weeks at time of inoculation. The experiment was 10 weeks in duration,
   consisting of a 6-week pre-inoculation period, followed by inoculation
   with cultured S. jonesii, and a 4-week post-inoculation period. Mean
   daily dry matter intake was recorded. Twenty-four-hour urine collections
   and rumen fluid samples were obtained weekly for estimation of total
   urinary DHP, and detection of S. jonesii using nested polymerase chain
   reaction analysis including presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNP), respectively. In the pre-inoculation period, total urinary DHP
   increased quickly to high levels, then gradually declined after Week 3
   with 2,3-DHP the dominant isomer through to Week 6. Indigenous strains
   of S. jonesii were sporadically detected by PCR analysis, indicating S.
   jonesii was present before inoculation but at the lower limits of
   detection. After inoculation there was no change in the rate of total
   DHP degradation or the frequency of detection of S. jonesii, although
   there was increased rate of degradation of 2,3-DHP. SNP indicated the
   presence of different strains of S. jonesii in both indigenous and
   cultured S. jonesii. DMI was low, especially in the 100\% treatment, due
   in part to the high stem content of the forage-harvested leucaena and
   probable DHP toxicosis. It was concluded that the cultured S. jonesii
   inoculum did not fully protect animals against leucaena toxicity.},

Title = {Effects of biochar on soil properties and erosion potential in a highly
   weathered soil},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {225-233},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Highly weathered soils in humid Asia are characterized by low soil
   fertility and high soil erosion potential. This study evaluates the
   influences of biochar made from the waste wood of white lead trees
   (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) on the physicochemical and
   biological properties of long-term cultivated, acidic Ultisol. This
   study used three application rates (0\%, 2.5\%, and 5\% (wt/wt)) of the
   biochar with an incubation time of 105 d for all cases. Soils were
   collected at 21 d, 42 d, 63 d, 84 d and 105 d during the incubation
   period to evaluate changes in soil properties over time. A simulated
   rainfall event (80 mm h(-1)) was performed to estimate soil loss for all
   treatments at the end of the incubation time. Experimental results
   indicate that applying biochar improved the physicochemical and
   biological properties of the highly weathered soils, including
   significant increases in soil pH from 3.9 to 5.1, cation exchange
   capacity from 7.41 to 10.8 cmol (+) kg(-1), base cation percentage from
   6.40 to 26.0\%, and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) from 835 to 1262 mg
   kg(-1). Compared with the control (i.e., no biochar), biochar
   application decreased bulk density from 1.4 to 1.1 Mg m(-3), increased
   K-sat by 1.8 times and increased the mean weight diameter (MWD) of soil
   aggregates from 2.6 cm to 4.0 cm. Incorporating biochar into the soil
   significantly reduced soil loss by 50\% and 64\% at 2.5\% and 5\%
   application rates, respectively, compared with the control. The
   formation of macroaggregates in the biochar-amended soils is the
   critical factor to improve soil erosion potential. Based on these
   results, a 5\% application rate of biochar is considered as suitable for
   highly weathered soil because this application rate efficiently improves
   soil physiochemical properties and reduces soil loss. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) and pearl millet
   (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.) were grown together in an alley cropping
   system in a semi-arid area of India. The five treatments included sole
   millet (SM), sole leucaena (SL) planted in double rows to form hedges
   with an alley width of 2.8 m, and alley cropping treatments LM5, LM6 and
   LM6P with alley widths of 2.8, 3.3 and 3.3 m, respectively. Millet rows
   within the alleys were spaced at 47 cm, giving five rows in LM5 and six
   rows in both LM6 and LM6P. LM6P differed from LM6 in that a vertical
   polytene barrier separated the root systems of leucaena and millet to a
   depth of 50 cm.
   Light interception, wind speed. saturation deficit and air, soil and
   leaf temperatures were monitored during the 1986 and 1987 rainy seasons
   in treatments SM, SL and LM5. This paper describes the experimental
   design and instrumentation and presents representative diurnal time
   courses illustrating the nature of the microclimatic changes associated
   with alley cropping. These indicate that alley cropping altered the
   microclimate experienced by millet to an extent which depended on its
   proximity to the hedge, hedge shape and the relative size of the two
   components.
   The larger leucaena canopy in 1987 than in 1986 resulted in more
   substantial reductions in wind speed and incident light in the alleys of
   LM 5 as compared with SM. Leaf and soil temperatures within the alleys
   tended to he warmer during the night and cooler during the day than in
   SM and temperature differences between rows within LM5 were related to
   the degree of shading by leucaena. Analysis of integrated data predicted
   little effect of the observed changes in saturation deficit on the
   productivity of millet, while thermal time analysis for 1987 suggested a
   2-3 day delay in flowering for millet adjacent to the hedge as compared
   with sole millet.},

Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {The objectives of this study were to evaluate the in vitro acaricidal
   effects of lyophilized extracts of four tannin rich plants (Acacia
   pennatula, Piscidia piscipula, Leucaena leucocephala and Lysiloma
   latisiliquum) against diverse stages of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus)
   microplus, and to asses whether tannins were involved in the acaricidal
   effect using polyethylene glycol (PEG) to block tannins. Larval
   immersion (LIT) and adult immersion (AIT) tests were used to evaluate
   the acaricidal effect of each of the lyophilized extracts against larval
   and adult stages of R. microplus respectively. Larvae and adult ticks
   were exposed to increasing concentrations of each plant extract (0,
   1200, 2400, 4800, 9600 and 19,200 mu g ml(-1)) for 10 min. Larval
   mortality was recorded at 48 h post-incubation. Adult mortality was
   recorded daily over 14 days, at which point their reproductive
   efficiency was evaluated. PEG was added to the extracts to verify
   whether tannins were involved in the acaricidal effect. The effect on
   egg laying inhibition and larval mortality was analyzed using the GLM
   procedure in SAS. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the effect of
   PEG on LIT results. Calculation of the lethal concentration 50 (LC50)
   was performed using a probit analysis. All extracts reduced the
   viability of R. microplus larval stages (P<0.001), and viability was
   restored with the addition of PEG suggesting an important role of
   tannins in the acaricidal effect (P < 0.001). The LC50 values of L.
   latisiliquum and P. piscipula plant extracts were 6.402 and 2.466 mu g
   ml(-1). None of the tannin-rich plant extracts affected adult mortality
   (P > 0.05). Lysiloma latisiliquum extract inhibited egg hatching of R.
   microplus (P < 0.01). Tannin-rich plant extracts from A. pennatula, P.
   piscipula, L leucocephala and L latisitiquum showed potential acaricidal
   activity. Further in vivo studies are needed to confirm this finding.

   areas of Tanzania},
Journal = {HELIYON},

Abstract = {This study assessed and classified the phytoremediation potentials of
   selected plant species around gold mining areas in restoring the
   environments contaminated by heavy metals. The geographic focuses of the
   study were the Golden Pride Gold Mine (GPGM) and Geita Gold Mine (GGM)
   in Tanzania. The shoots and roots of plant species surrounding the
   mining areas and the samples of associated soils were collected and
   analysed for total concentrations of lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), cadmium
   (Cd), copper (Cu), arsenic (As), manganese (Mn) and nickel (Ni) using
   Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) and UV-VIS spectrophotometry.
   Results indicated that the soils from study areas were loamy textured
   and slightly acid (pH 6.1-6.5), soil organic carbon and organic matter
   were low (0.6-2.0\%), total nitrogen was very low (<0.10\%), phosphorous
   ranged from low (6-12 mg kg(-1) soil) to high (13-25 mg kg(-1) soil),
   and cation exchange capacity ranged from low (6.0-12.0 cmol((+)) kg(-1)
   soil) to medium (12.1-25.0 cmol((+)) kg(-1) soil). In assessing heavy
   metals using plant parts, the roots of giant rats-tail grass (Sporobolus
   pyramidalis) accumulated highest Pb (757.78 mu g g(-1)), Creeping
   Blepharis (Blepharis maderaspatensis) the Cd (158.11 mu g g(-1)),
   lantana (Lantana camara) the As (68.61 mu g g(-1)), and leuceana
   (Leucaena leucocephala) accumulated higher Mn (2734.61 mu g g(-1)) and
   Ni (4464.33 mu g g(-1)). In shoots, L. leucocephala accumulated higher
   Cr (1276.67 mu g g(-1)) and higher Cu (2744.44 mu g g(-1)) in L. camara.
   Although S. pyramidalis, M. repens, L. camara, B. maderaspatensis and L.
   leucocephala are likely to pose hazards to herbivores (grazing animals)
   while entering the food chain, they are still potential
   hyperaccumulators thus can be used to decontaminate metalliferous
   affected soils. Blepharis maderaspatensis has never been reported
   anywhere as Pb, Cd, Cu, Mn and Ni uptake plant hence this can be
   regarded as a new finding.},

Abstract = {In small ruminant production, resource inventory is necessary. Among
   these, forage inventory and assessment are essential considering the
   fact that it is a major source of feedstuff for animals. In the
   Philippines, pioneering Halal goat research have been conducted in
   Region XII, however, forage inventory utilized in Halal goat production
   has not been done. This study aims to provide information on different
   species of plant utilized by goat raisers as forage. The study was
   conducted in 3 provinces of Region XII, namely North Cotabato, Sultan
   Kudarat and South Cotabato, and General Santos City. Four (4)
   municipalities/cities in each province were included in the assessment.
   Respondents in each area were selected based on the following criteria
   from the drafted Philippine National Standards for Halal goat
   production: a.) a believer of Islam b) with 5 to 24 breeder does; and
   c.) willingness of the farm owner to participate in the survey in
   addition to the established basic consideration for Halal goat raising.
   Respondents were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. A
   total of 61 species of plants belonging to 19 families were utilized as
   forage by the respondents. Carabao grass (Paspalum conjugatum Bergius)
   is the most common species of forage with a relative abundance of
   0.0949. This was followed by walis-walisan (Sida acuta Burm.f.)
   (0.0586), napier (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) (0.0566), paragrass
   (Brachiaria mutica (Forssk.) Stapf.) (0.0566), ipil-ipil (Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit-) (0.0545), and paragis (Eleusine indica (L.)
   Gaertn.) (0.0525). Higher diversity of forage species was recorded in
   Columbio, Sultan Kudarat based on the computed Simpson's Diversity
   (0.05322), Simpson's Index of Diversity (0.9468) and Shannon-Weiner
   Index (3.097). Differences in forage species diversity in all sampling
   sites were observed. Although all sampling sites are within one region,
   variability in land covers and climatic conditions can be attributed to
   species diversity difference.},

Abstract = {Phosphorus availability in soil as a mobile mineral influences forage
   growth. The purpose of doing this research is to enhance the soil
   phosphorus availability and grass production of Panicum maximum cv
   Riversdale by intercropping system with legums. The experiment was
   conducted based on with randomized design with five treatments of
   mixcropping of: (i) Gliricidia sepium + P. maximum; (ii) Calliandra
   calothyrsus + P. maximum; (iii) Leucaena leucocephala cv Taramba + P.
   maximum; (iv) Calopogonium mucunoides + P. maximum; (v) P. maximum as
   negative control. Plants were grown in pots with split-root technique
   using partition with a whole to allow some legume roots grew in the
   grass side. After growing for three months, on the legume areas P-32
   isotop solution was injected for 50 ml (11.23 mu ci/ml). After 21 days
   incubation samples were collected from both soil areas and both plants.
   The translocation of P-32 was determined using geiger counter from
   legumes into the grass and the concentration of P-32 was also determined
   in all plants. Forage productions was determined both in the legumes and
   grass. Result showed that soil phosphorus concentration in the grass
   area was significantly improved by intercropping with G. sepium and C.
   callothyrsus, while the one with L. leucocephala was similar, and the
   one with C. mucunoides was significantly lower than that of negative
   control (without legume). Detection of P-32 showed that there was P
   translocation in the system. P. maximum grass production depending on
   kind of legumes (P<0.05) those with G. sepium was significantly higher,
   L. leucocephala and C. callothyrsus were not significantly higher, while
   the one with C. mucunoides was 26.2\% lower from the control although
   not significantly. However, C. mucunoides produced the highest forage
   from the legume plant. It is concluded that grass-legume intercropping
   had a positive impact on phosphorus soil concentration in the grass area
   and grass production. Kind of legumes influenced the effectivity.},

Abstract = {Though improved fallows have been widely promoted as low-input
   technologies suitable for soil fertility replenishment in smallholder
   agriculture in southern Africa, their interaction with soil
   invertebrates has not been studied. In the present study we compared the
   population of soil macrofauna in maize grown in gliricidia (Gliricidia
   sepium), leucacna (Leucaena leucocephala), Leucaena diversifolia,
   sesbania (Sesbania sesban) and acacia (Acacia anguistissima) and
   continuously cropped monoculture maize. The objectives of the study were
   to determine (1) the effect of the type and length of fallows on soil
   macrofauna communities and functional groups, and (2) the long-term
   effect of legume fallows on maize yield. The number of invertebrate
   orders per sampling unit was significantly influenced by the type of
   fallow but not by the length of fallow period. Maize grown in legume
   fallows had more numbers of invertebrate orders than monoculture maize.
   Among the soil invertebrate macrofauna, centipede and millipede
   populations were significantly influenced by fallow type. The density of
   earthworms varied with both the type and length of fallow practice.
   Earthworm populations under maize grown in gliricidia fallows were
   significantly higher than those under fully fertilized monoculture
   maize. The population densities of other invertebrate orders and
   functional groups did not significantly differ between maize grown
   continuously in monoculture and in legume fallows. The highest maize
   grain yield (3.0-6.0 t ha(-1)) was recorded in fully fertilized
   monoculture. Maize grown in gliricidia and leucaena fallows consistently
   gave 2.0-4.0 t ha(-1) throughout the study period, while maize grown
   without fertilizer yielded less than 2 t ha(-1). These legumes produced
   0.4-2.9 t ha(-1) of re-sprout biomass annually, which released nutrients
   contributing to higher maize yields over a long period of time. It is
   concluded that these legume fallows can improve maize yields in addition
   to their positive impact on the diversity and functions of soil
   invertebrates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Wild edible vegetables (WEVs) are integral for sustained nutrition and
   livelihood of forest-dwelling tribal communities. Shelf-life enhancement
   of WEVs is crucial to overcome their perishability and ensure
   availability. Chemical preservatives are detrimental to their commercial
   `organic' status, and modern processing technologies are often
   challenging to be implemented by the marginalized farmers. In this
   study, four nutritionally important WEVs popularly cultivated, consumed
   and marketed in the hilly, forest-covered state of Mizoram, India,
   namely, Solanum aethiopicum (ST), Solanum torvum (TP), Solanum anguivi
   (TT) and Leucaena leucocephala (JZ), were subjected to brining and
   drying to enhance their shelf-lives. The drying method was standardized
   using response surface methodology at 80 degrees C and 540 minutes,
   obtaining the lowest moisture content with the highest total phenolic
   content (TPC) and DPPH radical scavenging activity (DRSA). A strong
   positive correlation was obtained between TPC and DRSA values of ST (R =
   0.738), TP (R = 0.760), TT (R = 0.977) and JZ (R = 0.935). Both brined
   bottled and dried vacuum-packaged samples were studied over 35 days of
   storage. Packaged dried samples were stored at room temperature (RT) and
   under refrigeration (RF). Brined WEVs showed a decrease in moisture and
   carbohydrate contents. Microbial conversion of sugars to lactic acid was
   evidenced by lowering pH to below 3.0. Bacterial activity also markedly
   enhanced TPC, flavonoids and DRSA values by causing free phenolics
   release and their structural transformation. However, overall microbial
   population in terms of aerobic coliform bacteria and fungal species were
   efficiently retarded up to more than 65\% by the two treatments.
   Vacuum-packaged RF samples exhibited lowered microbial metabolism.
   Pigment degeneration and tissue structure changes were indicated by
   changed color and hardness. Dried tissue brittleness enhanced the
   extractability of bioactive compounds. Vacuum-packaging improved
   antioxidant retention in the processed WEVs.

Title = {Agronomic and Economic Evaluation of Mulching in Rainfed Maize-Wheat
   Cropping System in the Western Himalayan Region of India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT},

Abstract = {Mulching is highly beneficial for resource conservation under rainfed
   conditions, but non-availability of organic biomass and easy
   availability of fertilizers and herbicides has led to a gradual
   discontinuation of this practice. Various vegetative materials,
   including some troublesome weedy perennials, are available locally,
   which can be recycled for enhanced soil moisture and nutrient
   conservation. A field experiment was conducted at Dehradun, India, from
   2001-2004 to study the effect of mulching with kudzu (Peuraria hirsuta),
   wild sage (Lantana camara), and subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) applied
   at 30 and 60 days of growth of maize (Zea mays), maize harvest, and
   sowing of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Application of 10 t/ha (fresh
   biomass) added 1.6-2.3 t dry matter through Peuraria, 2.5-3.2 t through
   Lantana, and 2.9-3.9 t/ha through Leuceana, which contributed 47.7-60.9
   kg N, 58.4-70.9 kg N, and 118.4-148.4 kg N/ha, respectively. All
   mulching materials were beneficial and improved productivity of maize
   significantly by 16.6-20.6\% over no mulching. Wheat yield also
   increased because of mulching in previous maize (+ 11.2\%), and the
   beneficial effect was relatively greater (12.4-25.1\%) when mulching was
   done at maize harvest or wheat sowing. Mulching showed improvement in
   organic C and total N status, and a decrease in bulk density associated
   with an increase in infiltration rate across three cropping cycles.
   Wheat gave three to five times more net profit than maize, and the net
   benefit-cost ratio of the system was the highest (1.34-1.35) when
   mulching was done at 60 days of maize growth with Peuraria and Leucaena.
   It was concluded that mulching with available vegetative materials in
   standing crop of maize or after harvest was beneficial for improving
   moisture conservation, productivity, and profitability of a maize-wheat
   cropping system under Doon valley conditions.},

Abstract = {Plants in which growth was reduced by low and high Al applications were
   designated as Al-sensitive plant (Hordeum vulgare) and Al-medium
   tolerant plants (Leucaena leucocephala, Ischaemum barbatum, Stylosanthes
   guianensis, and Fagopyrum esculentum), respectively, while plants in
   which growth was not affected or was stimulated by Al application were
   designated as Al-tolerant plant (Brachiaria ruziziensis) and
   Al-stimulated plants (Melastoma malabathricum, Melaleuca cajuputi,
   Acacia mangium, Hydrangea macrophylla, Vaccinium macrocarpon, Polygonum
   sachalinense, and Oryza sativa), respectively. Plants tolerant to or
   stimulated by Al were further classified based on the criteria of Al
   accumulation: 1) Al-excluders such as M. cajuputi, A. mangium, L.
   leucocephala, I. barbatum, S. guianensis, and O. sativa, 2) Al
   root-accumulators such as V. macrocarpon, B. ruziziensis, and P.
   sachalinense, and 3) Al-accumulators such as M. malabathricum, H.
   macrophylla, and F. esculentum. The growth and N, P, and Ii uptake in M.
   malabathricum, iii. cajuputi, A. mangium, L. leucocephala, H.
   macrophylla, V. macrocarpon, I. barbatum, P. sachalinense, F.
   esculentum, and O. sativa were stimulated by Al application, especially
   P uptake, while in H. vulgare (Al-sensitive plant) they were reduced by
   Al application. Ca and Mg uptake of many plants was inhibited by Al
   application, while that of some plants adapted to low pH soils was not
   affected at all (Ca and Rig: M. cajuputi, H. macrophylla, V.
   macrocarpon, I. barbatum, and S. guianensis; Mg: B. ruziziensis and P.
   sachalinense). In M. malabathricum, the relationship between Al and Ca
   (or Mg) was antagonistic because the Ca and Mg contents decreased by Al
   application even though dry matter, N, P, and K accumulation was
   stimulated by Al application. Plants adapted to low pH soils grew poorly
   in the no-Al treatment. Since the effect of the pH on plant growth was
   less conspicuous than that of Al, growth stimulation by Al application
   was ascribed not only to the alleviation of H+ toxicity but also to the
   increase of root activity such as P uptake.},

Abstract = {Extensive cattle production currently occupies more than 27\% of the
   rural landscapes in Latin America, and continues to expand. This
   activity, deeply rooted in the culture and rural economy of the region,
   requires an urgent transformation if it is to become both more efficient
   and environmentally friendly. Silvopastoral systems that incorporate
   native trees and shrubs are instrumental for the productive
   rehabilitation of cattle production and for biodiversity conservation in
   agricultural landscapes. We discuss research progress and adoption of
   intensive silvopastoral systems in Colombia and Mexico. Intensive
   silvopastoral systems (ISS) are a sustainable form of agroforestry for
   livestock production that combines fodder shrubs planted at high
   densities (more than 10,000 plants ha(-1)), trees and palms, and
   improved pastures. High stocking and the natural production of milk and
   meat in these systems are achieved through rotational grazing with
   electric fencing and a permanent supply of water for the cattle. While
   milk and meat production and cattle reproduction are enhanced,
   production costs decline as external inputs are replaced by natural
   processes related to fertility and biological control. We also discuss
   the importance of the ISS with native trees for climate change
   adaptation and mitigation, the barriers for their adoption, and how
   these have been successfully addressed using payment for environmental
   services, special credits and technical assistance. Finally, we
   highlight the need for enhancing landscape connectivity by integrating
   SPS to conservation corridors with native species to promote
   biodiversity conservation and other environmental services demanded by
   society. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions from Ethiopian agriculture are significantly
   increasing, with the largest share is from enteric fermentation and
   manure left on pasture. An investigation was conducted to evaluate the
   anti-nutrient composition and effect of commonly used medicinal plant
   extracts on enteric methane emission from fibrous feeds using maize
   stover as substrate feed. Total phenols, flavonoid, tannin and essential
   oil contents were analyzed using established standards. Effects of leaf
   extracts of Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, three varieties of
   Cymbopogon citratus (Cymbopogon citratus-I, Cymbopogon citratus java and
   Cymbopogon citratus upper awash), Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa
   stenopetala, three varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosmarinus
   officinalis I, Rosmarinus officinalis II and Rosmarinus officinalis III)
   and Thyme schimperi, seed of three Coriandrum sativum varieties
   (Coriandrum sativum Batu, Coriandrum sativum Tulu and Coriandrum sativum
   Waltai) and root of Echinops kebericho on total gas production,
   digestibility and methane production of maize stover were investigated
   at different doses using the standard procedures. The results indicated
   that leaf extracts of Acacia nilotica had the highest (P < 0.001) total
   phenolic and total tannin contents. Compared to other evaluated plant
   species, all varieties of Cymbopogon citratus had the highest (P <
   0.001) flavonoid content. Significantly high (P < 0.001) essential oil
   content was observed in Rosmarinus officinalis II than other varieties
   of Rosmarinus officinalis and other plant species. Significant reduction
   (P < 0.001) of methane production was observed with extracts of
   Cymbopoon citratus java (22.5 \% less methane than the control) and
   thyme schimperi (16.7 \% less methane than the control) at dose of 50
   mg/kg DM. There was also significant (P < 0.001) interaction effect
   between plant species and dose rates at 50 mg/kg DM for both plant
   species. It can be concluded that the use of 50 mg/kg DM of Cymbopoon
   citratus java and Thyme schimperi extract to maize stover reduced
   methane production without negatively affecting feed digestibility.
   Further studies are necessary to examine the storability of the extracts
   in different time durations and evaluate their effects in vivo with
   animals.},

Abstract = {In livestock production systems, the combination of pasture and woody
   perennials improves the yield and reduces the negative environmental
   impact. In 2006, a silvopastoral system was established at the
   experimental station (Posta Zootecnica: PZ) of the Universidad
   Veracruzana. It contained 791 native tropical trees of the following
   species: quickstick (Gliricidia sepium; Glse), copite (Cordia
   dodecandra; Codo), West Indian elm (Guazuma ulmifolia; Guul), (Diphysa
   robinioides; Diro) and tihuixtle (Caesalpinia cacalaco; Caca). Starting
   from the second year after the trees were planted, livestock was brought
   into the PZ to browse on them. The objective of this study was to
   quantify the development and survival of five native species, 11 years
   after they were planted. The resulting support data was gathered from
   August to November 2017. Due to their specific characteristics, the
   survival and development of the said species is expected to be different
   under similar conditions. The experimental design was a series of
   blocks, with five treatments (species) and 156 replicates per treatment.
   Thirteen rows of trees were planted in a 2-ha surface, using the
   following repeated arrangement: Glse+Codo+Guul+Diro+Cala. The trees were
   planted 3 m apart from each other and the distance between rows was 5 m.
   Eleven years after they were planted, the specimens of each species were
   counted, the diameter of their trunks or main branches was measured and
   the height at which this measurement was carried out was recorded. The
   overall survival rate was 57.7\% (p=0.02); there was a difference
   between species in the diameter of the trunk or main branch (p=0.03) and
   the height at which they were measured (p=0.003). Eight species of trees
   that had grown naturally in the system or that were planted to provide
   shade or serve as windbreak were identified: Indian siris (Albizia
   lebbeck), Australian pine (Casuarina equisetifolia), Spanish cedar
   (Cedrela odorata), lead tree (Leucaena leucocephala), Elephant-ear tree
   (Enterolobium cyclocarpum), trumpet tree (Tabebuia rosea), teak (Tectona
   grandis) and sea grape (Coccoloba uvifera). Native tropical trees
   maintain the silvopastoral system and they are available for browsing.},

Abstract = {In a preliminary in vitro study, leaves of Acacia nilotica, Prosopis
   juliflora, Cajanus cajan, Leucaena leucocephala and seed kernel of
   Mangifera indica were identified as potential candidates in mitigating
   ruminal methane (CH4) production. The objective of the current study was
   to investigate the combination efficiency of these unconventional feeds
   with concentrate mix (CM) or Chloris gayana grass in CH4 reduction. Two
   feed combinations in different proportions were incubated in vitro with
   buffered rumen fluid at Hohenheim Gas test. In combination 1, C. gayana
   and CM were included as basal substrates, while in combination 2, A.
   nilotica, P. juliflora, C. cajan, L. leucocephala or M. indica seed
   kernel were included as CH4 reducing supplements at different
   proportions. The CH4 reducing potentials of feed combinations were
   presented as the ratio of CH4 to net gas production and expressed as
   percentage (pCH(4)). The pCH(4) for CM and C. gayana was 16.7\% and
   16.9\%, respectively, while it ranged from 3.18\% in A. nilotica to
   13.1\% in C. cajan. The pCH(4) was reduced (p < 0.05) from 14.6\% to
   9.39\% when A. nilotica was combined with CM. In combination of L.
   leucocephala or C. cajan with CM, the pCH(4) (p < 0.05) was reduced from
   16.5\% and 16.6\% with the lowest proportion to 15.1\% and 15.2\% with
   the highest inclusion rate respectively. The combination of C. gayana
   with L. leucocephala or C. cajan reduced (p < 0.05) the pCH(4) from
   16.3\% and 16.4\% to 15.1\% and 14.9\% respectively. The pCH(4) was
   reduced (p < 0.05) from 13.4\% to 7.60\% when A. nilotica was combined
   with C. gayana. Estimated digestible organic matter (dOM) and
   metabolizable energy (ME) increased (p < 0.05) with increasing
   proportions of M. indica seed kernel with CM or C. gayana. In
   conclusion, the combination of the basal substrates with unconventional
   supplements resulted in CH4 reduction without affecting the dOM and ME
   at lower inclusion rates. Animal-based experiments await to validate in
   vitro findings.},

Abstract = {Bouldery riverbed lands occupy about one-third of the geographical area
   in Doon Valley of north-west India. These marginal lands need
   rehabilitation through establishment of silvopasture system for meeting
   the biomass requirements of resource-poor farmers. A study was carried
   out for 14 years (1980 to 1993) at Dehradun, involving four
   multi-purpose tree species viz. Albizia lebbek (L.) Benth., Grewia
   optiva Drumm., Bauhinia purpurea L. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lamk.) de
   Wit.; and two grass species viz. Chrysopogon fulvus (Spreng.) Chiov. and
   Eulaliopsis binata (Retz.) C.E. Hubb. Fifty and 75\% of the tree crown
   was lopped once a year after four years of age. Tree survival decreased
   with age, and was highest with L. leucocephala (86.9\% in 1993 of
   initial density of 625 trees ha(-1)) and lowest with B. purpurea
   (49.3\%). Canopy parameters of trees progressed differently, presumably
   due to their varying growth habits. The trees of A. lebbek were taller
   with more crown spread, whereas G. optiva had more crown height with
   lesser crown spread. Stem diameter growth of A. lebbek was highest
   followed by B. purpurea. Lopping intensity did not affect tree survival
   and also canopy growth in most years, but collar diameter and diameter
   at breast height (dbh) decreased significantly at the higher intensity
   of lopping. Intercropped grass species E. binata caused a greater
   adverse effect on the tree survival and growth parameters than C.
   fulvus. The biomass production (leaf and branch wood weight of lopped
   material) was highest at eight years of age in 1987 but showed no
   definite trend over the study period. Bauhinia purpurea produced the
   highest biomass and L. leucocephala the lowest, despite opposite trends
   in their survival. The performance of A. lebbek was on par with B.
   purpurea in the later years (1990-1993), but G. optiva was inferior
   despite its superiority in the early years (1984-1985). The effects of
   lopping intensity were not appreciable, but intercropping with E. binata
   decreased leaf and branch wood production significantly compared with C.
   fulvus throughout. However, the adverse effect was comparatively less
   pronounced on B. purpurea and A. lebbek than on G. optiva and L.
   leucocephala. The fibre yield of G. optiva also decreased due to
   intercropped E. binata compared with C. fulvus.},

Abstract = {The response of legumes to inoculation with rhizobia can be affected by
   many factors. Little work has been undertaken to examine how indigenous
   populations of rhizobia affect this response. We conducted a series of
   inoculation trials in four Hawaiian soils with six legume species
   (Glycine max, Vigna unguiculata, Phaseolus lunatus, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Arachis hypogaea, and Phaseolus vulgaris) and
   characterized the native rhizobial populations for each species in terms
   of the number and effectiveness of the population for a particular host.
   Inoculated plants had, on average, 76\% of the nodules formed by the
   inoculum strain, which effectively eliminated competition from native
   strains as a variable between soils. Rhizobia populations ranged from
   less than 6 .times. 100/g of soil to 1 .times. 104/g of soil. The
   concentration of nitrogen in shoots of inoculated plants was not higher
   than that in uninoculated controls when the most probable number MPN
   counts of rhizobia were at or above 2 .times. 101/g of soil unless the
   native population was completely ineffective. Tests of random isolates
   from nodules of uninoculated plants revealed that within most soil
   populations there was a wide range of effectiveness for N2 fixation. All
   populations had isolates that were ineffective in fixing N2. The
   inoculum strains generally did not fix more N2 than the average isolate
   from the soil population in single-isolate tests. Even when the inoculum
   strain proved to be a better symbiont than the soil rhizobia, there was
   no response to inoculation. Enhanced N2 fixation after inoculation was
   related to increased nodule dry weights. Although inoculation generally
   increased nodule number when there were less than 1 .times. 102 rhizobia
   per g of soil, there was no corresponding increase in nodule dry weight
   when active populations were effective. Most species compensated for 
   reduced nodulation in soils with few rhizobia by increasing the size of
   nodules and therefore maintaining a nodule dry weight similar to that of
   inoculation plants with more nodules. Even when competition by native
   soil strains was overcome with a selected inoculum strain, it was not
   always possible to enhance N2 fixation when soil populations were above
   a threshold number and had some effective strains.},

Abstract = {The current study aimed to explore the traditional knowledge and
   practices of indigenous communities in Bahawalpur and adjacent regions,
   Pakistan, to treat a variety of diseases with a particular focus on the
   usage of ethnomedicinal wild plants. The objective of the study was to
   collect and evaluate local and indigenous knowledge regarding the
   quantity, variety, use and management of resources by the people. Data
   were gathered using Rapid Appraisal Approach (RAA), which involved
   in-person interviews. The data were analyzed using descriptive
   statistics methods as well as common ethnobotanical analytical
   techniques viz. use value (UV), relative frequency of citation (RFC),
   informant consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL), relative
   importance (RI), frequency index (FI), family use value (FUV), family
   importance value (FIV), popular therapeutic use value (POPUT), plant
   part value (PPV), preference ranking (PR), cultural significance index
   (CSI), rank order priority (ROP) and Jaccard index (JI). A total of 158
   plant species from 49 families were identified. The perennial herbs made
   up 72\% of the documented species of therapeutic plants. There were 21
   different species in each of the two major plant families i.e., Fabaceae
   and Poaceae. The maximum ICF were calculated for gonorrhea and paralysis
   (1.0) and maximum POPUT was calculated for skin disorders (0.088) and
   cough (0.077), respectively. The maximum UV was found for Rumex crispus
   (0.57) and RI for Leucaena leucocephala (4.38). Heliotropium crispum had
   the highest FL value (83\%) and is used to treat kidney diseases. Alhagi
   maurorum had the greatest RFC (0.009) and FI (0.93). Arecaceae (0.45)
   and Fabaceae (13.39\%) had the greatest FUV while Poaceae and Fabaceae
   had the highest FIV (13.29 for each). Leaves were the most frequently
   used plant part (35\%). Alhagi maurorum (4.0) and Rumex crispus (32.57)
   had the highest CSI and ROP, respectively. The maximum JI (28.31) was
   calculated for Cholistan desert. These results showed the local
   population's reliance on herbal remedies to treat prevalent illnesses.
   To demonstrate the viability of species, it ` s crucial to emphasize
   both the use and conservation of these species. Adopting innovative

Abstract = {A long-term field experiment was established on a kaolinitic Alfisol in
   Ibadan, Nigeria, in 1972. The land was cleared manually from secondary
   forest and used for (i) continuous no-till cropping with maize (Zea mays
   L.) and maize/cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) intercropping, (ii)
   planted fallow of guinea grass (Panicum maximum Jacq.), leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala de Wit), and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan Millsp.),
   and (iii) natural bush regrowth in a randomized complete block design
   with three replications. At the end of 15 years, the fallow plots were
   cleared manually and cropped with maize for three years. The chemical
   and physical soil properties and crop performance of the newly-cleared
   plots were compared with those under 15 years of continuous cultivation.
   A total of 26 woody species were identified on the bush regrowth plots.
   Above-ground biomass accumulation of the bush plots was 157 Mg ha(-1)
   containing 1316 kg N ha(-1). Guinea grass, leucaena and natural bush
   regrowth plots had comparable organic C concentrations (approximately 20
   g kg(-1)) in the surface soil (0 to 10 cm) after 15 years. The organic C
   concentration in the surface soil under pigeon pea was the lowest (9.5 g
   kg(-1)) among the four fallow treatments. Soil under 15 years of
   continuous no-till maize with and without residue mulch, respectively,
   contained approximately half (10 g kg(-1)) and a quarter (5.7 g kg(-1))
   of the organic C under natural bush or guinea grass fallow. The levels
   of exchangeable Ca, K, Mg and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC)
   were lower in the soils under continuous cultivation than in those under
   natural bush and planted fallow. Soil acidification occurred in soils
   under continuous cropping as depicted by the lower pH values and greater
   exchangeable Al and Mn concentrations compared to the fallow plots.
   Grain yield of maize (3 to 5 Mg ha(-1)) without fertilizer application
   in the plots newly cleared from natural bush, guinea grass and leucaena
   fallow was comparable with that of continuous no-till maize with residue
   mulch and chemical fertilizer (N, P, K, Mg, Zn) applications. Among the
   four fallow treatments, maize grain and stover yields were the lowest in
   plots cleared from pigeon pea fallow.},

Abstract = {Phosphate mining in Florida yields waste products of phosphatic clay and
   quartz sand tailings, each making up about one-third of the original
   matrix (PO4 ore, sand, and clay). Phosphatic clay ponds typically occupy
   about 50\% of the mined sites and normally require 10 to 15 yr before 40
   of 50\% solids are obtained. These clays contain no phytotoxic materials
   and are high in most plant nutrients. When surface water has
   disappeared, these clays are classified as clayey Haplaquents. A
   split-plot field experiment was conducted to study biomass yield,
   quality, plant nutrient concentrations, changes in soil nutrients, and
   226Ra. Seven biomass crops.sbd.(i) elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum
   L. `'PI 300086''), (ii) leucaena {[}Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De
   Wet], (iii) alemangrass {[}Eschinochloa polystachya (H.B.K.) Hitche],
   (iv) erianthus {[}Erianthus arundinaceum (Retz) Jesw `'IK 76-63''], (v)
   desmodium (Desmodium cinerascens A. Gray), (vi) sweet sorghum {[}Sorghum
   bicolor (L.) Moench `'USDA M 81E''], and (vii) forage sorghum {[}Sorghum
   bicolor (L.) Moench `'Pioneer 931''].sbd. were grown on the phosphatic
   clay with and without a 5-cm surface layer of quartz sand tailings.
   Nitrogen was the only fertilizer element applied for grass species and
   no fertilizer was applied for legumes during the 4-yr period. Dry
   biomass yield averaged over 4 yr for erianthus, leucaena, and
   elephantgrass averaged 139.6, 58.5, and 56.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively.
   Crude protein and digestibility were low in mature, whole-plant samples
   except for leucaena (122.0 g kg-1). Generally, all whole plants
   contained adequate concentrations of nutrients averaging (g kg-1) P,
   2.05; K, 11.5; Ca, 4.3; Mg, 2.77 and (mg kg-1) Cu, 4.0; Zn, 26; Fe, 68;
   and Mn, 35. Mehlich-I-extractable soil nutrient concentrations changed
   little over the 4-yr period. Radium-226 concentration in plant tissue
   (0.23 pCi g-1) was nearly six times higher than the concentration
   measured in plants from an unmined surface  Spodosol (0.04 pCi g-1).
   Data indicate that these present-day waste lands can be a valuable
   resource for biomass production.},

Abstract = {Moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam.) is commonly known to Filipinos as
   ``Malunggay{''}. This tree is abundant in the rural areas, and is a rich
   source of digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, which are essential
   components of animal feeds. Thus, it has great potential as feed
   resource, especially for livestock and poultry smallholder farmers.
   Using livestock and poultry species, feeding experiments were conducted
   to determine the effects of moringa on the growth performance of goats
   and broiler chickens; and on the laying performance of chickens and
   quails and on the quality of their eggs. A grass-legume (60: 40) diet
   consisting of para grass (Brachiaria mutica) in combination with either
   moringa or Ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala) or katuray (Sesbania
   grandiflora) were fed to goats for 60 days. Dry matter intake was
   measured daily, while the body weight (BW) was measured monthly. Dry
   matter intake was higher in goats fed with para grass and moringa
   (P<0.05), which resulted in higher weight gains (P<0.05). In other
   experiments, moringa leaves and seeds in different preparations, i.e.,
   fresh, extract and meals were investigated in poultry. Effects on egg
   production, egg weight, and percentage of broken eggs, yolk color and
   feed conversion ratio (FCR) were assessed in quail and layer chickens,
   while the influence on live weight and return on income were evaluated
   in broiler chickens. Egg production was higher, while egg weight was
   heavier, yolk color was darker and the FCR was better in layer quail
   supplemented with 5\% moringa leaf meal (All, P<0.05) as well as in
   White Leghorns provided with 100 mL moringa leaves extract added L-1 of
   water (P<0.05). On the other hand, the supplementation of moringa seed
   meal in the diet of Babcock layers reduced the percentage of broken eggs
   (0.017 vs. 0.032; P<0.05). Meanwhile, the ad libitum feeding of fresh
   moringa leaves to broiler chickens, did not affect body weight gain;
   however, the net income per bird increased by 6 Philippine pesos. Based
   on the findings, moringa leaves and seeds can be used as a supplement in
   the diet of livestock, layers and broilers because it increased
   production performance and income, and improved the quality of eggs
   produced.},

Title = {SEASONAL DYNAMIC, HOST-RANGE AND SYMBIOTIC EFFICIENCY OF NATIVE
   RHIZOBIAL POPULATIONS IN 3 SOIL HORIZONS OF 4 CONTRASTING SAVANNA SITES},
Journal = {SYMBIOSIS},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-63},
Abstract = {A strong seasonality was detected in the size of the native rhizobial
   populations (NRP) located in three soil horizons of four savanna sites
   with contrasting soil and vegetation features. Within individual soil
   sites the increased size of NRP during the rainy season was attributed
   to the improved soil water content and lower temperatures brought about
   by rains. A highly significant negative and positive correlations were
   detected between the size of NRP and the temperature and water content
   of soils, respectively. On the other hand, differences in the size of
   NRP among sites and soil horizons at both seasons was ascribed to the
   deleterious effect excerted by the soil chemical properties on the
   native rhizobia. The size of NRP was significantly positive correlated
   with the soil pH and cation exchange capacity and significantly negative
   correlated with the soil exchangeable acidity regardless of the season.
   There was also a significant positive correlation between the size of
   NRP and the legume density in the 4 savanna sites. Ln the savanna, the
   highest rhizobial number were detected in the rhizosphere of native
   legumes. Among them, Chamaecrista tetraphila, Desmodium barbatum,
   Galactia jussieuana, Indigophera Iespedezioides, Phaseolus gracilis,
   Stylosanthes sp. and Zornia curvata, widely distributed among savanna
   sites, proved to be important reservoirs of NRP during the dry season.
   NRP were composed by Bradyrhizobium sp. (Vigna), Bradyrhizobium spp.
   (Centrosema, Leucaena, Psophocarpus and Stylosanthes), Rhizobium tropici
   and R. etli. Whereas, R. leguminosarum bv viceae and B. japonicum were
   absent in all soil sites. Under controlled conditions the NRP proved to
   be symbiotically inefficient in whole soil inoculated Centrosema
   pubescens, Leucaena leucocephala, Psophocarpus tetragonolobus and
   Phaseolus vulgaris regardless of the site and month of soil collection.
   A growth promotion and a relative ureide content similar to that
   elicited by the commercial Bradyrhizobium sp. (Vigna) strain I-125
   (Hup(+)) were only obtained in Vigna unguiculata plants inoculated with
   whole soils or with several efficient native Bradyrhizobium sp. (Vigna)
   isolates, all found to be Hup(-). There was an apparent non-relationship
   between the cultural characteristics of the native isolates and the
   displayed efficiency on V. unguiculata.},

Abstract = {The effect of moisture on seedling growth of Albizia lebbeck (L) Benth.,
   Leucaena leucocephala Lam. and Dalbergia sissoo Roxb. was evaluated in
   central India during 2018. One month old seedlings raised in
   polyethylene bags containing about 3 kg of garden soil were subjected to
   three watering frequencies as irrigating daily (control), and
   withholding irrigation upto 14 days (intermediate stress) and 21 days
   (severe stress). Observations were made according to different watering
   frequencies on eight quantitative traits viz. plant height, root length,
   survival percentage, relative water content, excised leaf water loss,
   total chlorophyll content, proline content and total biomass. All the
   traits considered were significantly decreased as stress increased.
   Under optimum moisture condition A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala
   performed well than D. sissoo. At intermediate stress D. sissoo had
   maximum reduction of 81.36\%, 54.33\%, 43.62\% and 20.0\% for traits
   like total biomass, root length, total chlorophyll content and survival
   percent, respectively. In severe stress condition also the pattern was
   similar as D. sissoo had maximum reduction for total biomass (84.75\%),
   root length (63.77\%), total chlorophyll content (46.30\%) and survival
   percent (40.0\%). While L. leucocephala had higher reduction for plant
   height by 26.46\% and 40.03\% at intermediate stress and severe stress,
   respectively and it also had higher reduction for total biomass
   (84.92\%) at severe stress. In contrast, A. lebbeck had minimum
   reduction for the traits like total biomass (60.87\%), root length
   (25.94\%), survival percent (no reduction), total chlorophyll content
   (17.38\%) and plant height (17.37\%) at intermediate stress. Also the
   reduction pattern was similar at severe stress for total biomass
   (63.77\%), root length (38.03\%), survival percent (no reduction), plant
   height (32.79\%) and total chlorophyll content (27.02\%). In both stress
   levels, A. lebbeck had higher relative water content, proline
   accumulation and lower excised leaf water loss than L. leucocephala> D.
   sissoo. Based on physiological and biochemical trait expressions and
   minimum percent reduction for putative traits the species A. lebbeck
   indicated better drought resistance as compared with L. leucocephala >
   D. sissoo. Hence, A. lebbeck can be a choice of species for better a
   groforestry programmes in drought thriving arid and semi-arid regions.},

Abstract = {The species Phaseolus vulgaris is a promiscuous legume nodulated by
   several species of the family Rhizobiaceae. During a study of rhizobia
   nodulating this legume in Portugal, we isolated several strains that
   nodulate P. vulgaris effectively and also Macroptilium atropurpureum and
   Leucaena leucocephala, but they form ineffective nodules in Medicago
   sativa. According to phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene
   sequence, the strains from this study belong to the genus Rhizobium,
   with Rhizobium rhizogenes and Rhizobium tropici as the closest related
   species, with 99.9 and 99.2\% similarity, respectively, between the type
   strains of these species and strain P1-7(T). The nodD and nifH genes
   carried by strain P1-7(T) are phylogeneticafly related to those of other
   species nodulating Phaseolus. This strain does not carry virulence genes
   present in the type strain of R. rhizogenes, ATCC 11325(T). Analysis of
   the recA and atpD genes confirms this phylogenetic arrangement, showing
   low similarity with respect to those of R. rhizogenes ATCC 11325(T)
   (91.9 and 94.1\% similarity, respectively) and R. tropici IIB CAT 899(T)
   (90.6 \% and 91.8 \% similarity, respectively). The intergenic spacer
   (ITS) of the strains from this study is phylogenetically divergent from
   those of R. rhizogenes ATCC 11235(T) and R. tropici CAT 899(T), with
   85.9 and 82-8 \% similarity, respectively, with respect to strain
   P1-7(T). The tRNA profile and two-primer random amplified polymorphic
   DNA pattern of strain P1-7(T) are also different from those of R.
   rhizogenes ATCC 11235(T) and R. tropici CAT 899(T). The strains isolated
   in this study can be also differentiated from R. rhizogenes and R.
   tropici by several phenotypic characteristics. The results of DNA-DNA
   hybridization showed means of 28 and 25 \% similarity between strain
   P1-7(T) and R. rhizogenes ATCC 11235(T) and R. tropici CIAT 899(T),
   respectively. All these data showed that the strains isolated in this
   study belong to a novel species of the genus Rhizobium, for which we
   propose the name Rhizobium lusitanum sp. nov.; the type strain is
   P1-7(T) (= LMG 22705(T) = CECT 7016(T)).},

Abstract = {Biserrula pelecinus is a pasture legume species new to Australian
   agriculture. The potential N benefit from B. pelecinus pastures in
   agricultural systems may not be realised if its symbiotic interactions
   with Mesorhizobium spp. are not well understood. This study evaluated
   the symbiotic interactions of four strains of Biserrula root-nodule
   bacteria (WSM1271, WSM1283, WSM1284, WSM1497) with four genotypes of B.
   pelecinus (cv. Casbah, 93GRC4, 93ITA33, IFBI1) and with a range of
   related legumes, including species known to be nodulated by strains of
   Mesorhizobium loti and other Mesorhizobium spp. Structures of root
   nodules were studied using light and electron microscopy enabling the
   ultrastructure of effective and ineffective nodules to be compared. B.
   pelecinus always formed typical indeterminate, finger-like nodules. The
   number of bacteroids inside symbiosomes varied between host X strain
   combinations, however, nodules formed by ineffective associations had
   well developed peribacteroid membranes and abundant bacteroids.
   Considerable variation was found in N-2-fixing effectiveness of strains
   isolated from B. pelecinus on the four B. pelecinus genotypes. Strains
   WSM1271, WSM1284 and WSM1497 nodulated Astragalus membranaceus, only
   strains WSM1284 and WSM1497 nodulated Astragalus adsurgens. Strain
   WSM1284 also nodulated Dorycnium rectum, Dorycnium hirsutum, Glycyrrhiza
   uralensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus edulis, Lotus glaber, Lotus
   maroccanus, Lotus ornithopodioides, Lotus pedunculatus, Lotus
   peregrinus, Lotus subbiflorus and Ornithopus sativus. The four strains
   from B. pelecinus did not nodulate Amorpha fruticosa, Astragalus
   sinicus, Cicer arietinum, Hedysarum spinosissimum, Lotus parviflorus,
   Macroptilium atropurpureum or Trifolium lupinaster. M. loti strain SU343
   nodulated all four genotypes of B. pelecinus. However, M. loti strain
   CC829 only nodulated B. pelecinus genotypes 93ITA33 and 1171311 and the
   nodules were ineffective. The root nodule isolates from H. spinosissimum
   (E13 and H4) nodulated B. pelecinus cv. Casbah whereas the commercial
   inoculant strain for Cicer (CC1192) could not nodulate any genotype of
   B. pelecinus. These results indicate that strains WSM1271, WSM1283 and
   WSM1497 isolated originally from B. pelecinus have a specific host range
   while strain WSM1284 is promiscuous in its capacity to nodulate with a
   broad range of related species. As B. pelecinus can be nodulated by
   Mesorhizobium spp. from other agricultural legumes, particularly Lotus,
   there is an opportunity to utilise this trait in cultivar development.

Title = {Growth rate of male Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) fed leucaena and
   rice straw diets with increasing levels of cassava},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {64},
Number = {13},
Abstract = {Context. The planting and use of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) to
   fatten cattle is both practical and profitable for smallholder farmers
   in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Currently smallholder farmers feed
   leucaena as the primary component of a cattle fattening diet. However,
   the high protein content in leucaena could be more effectively used if
   combined with a fermentable energy source, such as cassava (Manihot
   utilissima). Aim. An experiment was conducted to determine the ratio of
   leucaena to cassava corresponding to largest average daily gain and most
   efficient feed conversion for gain. Methods. Thirty growing male Bali
   cattle (Bos javanicus) similar to 18 months of age with an initial live
   weight of 164 +/- 1.8 kg (mean +/- s.e.) were allocated to one of six
   experimental treatments in a randomised block design. Bulls were held in
   individual stalls and had access to experimental diets and water ad
   libitum. The diets were 20\% rice straw + 80\% leucaena hay (A), 20\%
   rice straw + 65\% leucaena hay + 15\% cassava meal (B), 20\% rice straw
   + 50\% leucaena hay + 30\% cassava meal (C), 20\% rice straw + 35\%
   leucaena hay + 45\% cassava meal (D), 20\% rice straw + 20\% leucaena
   hay + 60\% cassava meal (E) and 20\% rice straw + 5\% leucaena hay +
   75\% cassava meal (F). A mineral mix was provided at 1\% DM of total
   diet and urea was added to the cassava meal at 2\% DM. In consideration
   of animal welfare concerns, the trial was concluded on Day 77 due to
   observations indicating that bulls receiving the highest level of
   cassava (F) were experiencing significant weight loss. Key results. The
   optimum level of inclusion of cassava was 29.5\% (based on the quadratic
   response curve) but there was little difference in average daily gain up
   to 45\% inclusion. Feeding a high level of cassava meal (more than 45\%
   of diet) reduced feed intake, average daily gain and income over feed
   cost. Conclusion. Cassava meal can be successfully and profitably
   incorporated into leucaena-based rations of Bali bulls for fattening.
   Implications. Formulating rations with cassava meal and leucaena can be
   economically beneficial in cattle fattening systems.},

Title = {Nutritional Quality, Voluntary Intake and Enteric Methane Emissions of
   Diets Based on Novel Cayman Grass and Its Associations With Two
   Leucaena Shrub Legumes},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation in cattle are an
   important source of greenhouse gases, accounting for about 40\% of all
   agricultural emissions. Diet quality plays a fundamental role in
   determining the magnitude of CH4 emissions. Specifically, the inclusion
   of feeds with high digestibility and nutritional value have been
   reported to be a viable option for reducing CH4 emissions and,
   simultaneously, increase animal productivity. The present study aimed to
   evaluate the effect of the nutritional composition and voluntary intake
   of diets based on tropical forages upon CH4 emissions from zebu steers.
   Five treatments (diets) were evaluated: Cay1: Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman
   (harvested after 65 days of regrowth: low quality); Cay2: cv. Cayman
   harvested after 45 days of regrowth; CayLl: cv. Cayman + Leucaena
   leucocephala; CayLd: cv. Cayman + Leucaena diversifolia; Hay: Dichantium
   aristatum hay as a comparator of common naturalized pasture. For each
   diet representing different levels of intensification (naturalized
   pasture, improved pasture, and silvopastoral systems), CH4 emissions
   were measured using the polytunnel technique with four zebu steers
   housed in individual chambers. The CH4 accumulated was monitored using
   an infrared multigas analyzer, and the voluntary forage intake of each
   animal was calculated. Dry matter intake (DMI, \% of body weight) ranged
   between 0.77 and 2.94 among diets offered. Emissions of CH4 per kg of
   DMI were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in Cay1 (60.4 g), compared to
   other treatments. Diets that included Leucaena forage legumes had
   generally higher crude protein contents and higher DMI. Cay1 and Hay
   which had low protein content and digestibility had a higher CH4
   emission intensity (per unit live weight gain) compared to Cay2, CayLl
   and CayLd. Our results suggest that grass consumed after a regrowth
   period of 45 days results in lower CH4 emissions intensities compared to
   those observed following a regrowth period of 65 days. Diets with
   Leucaena inclusion showed advantages in nutrient intake that are
   reflected in greater live weight gains of cattle. Consequently, the
   intensity of the emissions generated in the legume-based systems were
   lower suggesting that they are a good option for achieving the emission
   reduction goals of sustainable tropical cattle production.},

Title = {Effect of plant extracts from several tanniferous browse legumes on
   in vitro microbial fermentation of the tropical grass
   Pennisetum purpureum},
Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {168},

Pages = {188-195},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {To what extent microbial fermentation of tropical grasses is affected by
   tannins from browse legumes was studied in vitro using acetone extracts
   from tanniferous plants in four 48 h incubation experiments. A
   proportion of plant extracts equivalent to 240 mg of Acacia cornigera
   (AC), Albizia lebbekoides (AL) and Leucaena leucocephala (LL) were added
   to each bottle with 800 mg Pennisetum purpureum as substrate, and
   contrasted with P. purpureum alone (PP) or with 64 mg quebracho tannins
   (QT). Gas production was lowest with QT and AL (P < 0.05), and AC and LL
   reduced gas volume compared to PP from 10 to 24 h (P < 0.001) and from 4
   to 8 h (P < 0.01), respectively. Compared with PP, total VFA
   concentration was reduced with AL and QT after 12 h (P < 0.01), and the
   same trend (P=0.06) occurred with AC and AL after 24 h. Acetate molar
   proportion at 24 h was reduced, and that of propionate increased, with
   AC and AL compared with PP (P < 0.05), whereas AL and QT reduced
   butyrate proportion (P < 0.05). Estimated methane concentration per unit
   fermented organic matter after 24h was lower with AC and AL than with PP
   (P < 0.01). Proportion of R. albus was reduced with LL, AC and AL
   compared with PP at 12 h (P < 0.01) and 24 h (P < 0.001) of incubation,
   and the relative concentration of F. succinogenes tended (P=0.08) to be
   reduced with QT at 12 h, whereas there was no effect on R. flavefaciens.
   Plant extracts from A. cornigera, A. lebekkoides and L leucocephala
   affected microbial fermentation of the tropical grass P. purpureum,
   reducing the rate of gas production from 4 to 16 h and increasing
   propionate at the expense of acetate, to the largest extent with A.
   lebbekoides. A reduction of methanogenesis, and therefore an increase in
   efficiency of energy utilisation, is consequently expected. No major
   effect on the bacterial population attached to the substrate occurred,
   but concentrations of R. albus seemed to be sensitive to tannins. (C)

Title = {Integration of legume trees in maize-based cropping systems improves
   rain use efficiency and yield stability under rain-fed agriculture},

Abstract = {Water availability is a major constraint to crop production in
   sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where agriculture is predominantly rain-fed.
   This study aimed to investigate the effect of the nitrogen-fixing legume
   tree Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and inorganic fertilizer on rain
   use efficiency (RUE), a robust measure of productivity and land
   degradation, in three long-term (11-12 years) experiments conducted in
   Zambia and Nigeria. On the two Zambian sites, sole maize (Zea mays)
   grown continuously (for 11-12 years) with the recommended fertilizer
   achieved the highest RUE (3.9-4.6 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) followed by maize
   intercropped with Leucaena (2.5-3.4 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)). This translated
   to 192-383\% increase in RUE over the control (maize grown without
   nutrient inputs), which is the de facto resource-poor farmers' practice.
   RUE was more stable in fully fertilized sole maize on the first Zambian
   site and not statistically different from the maize-Leucaena
   associations on the second site. On the Nigerian site, RUE was higher in
   maize planted between Leucaena hedgerows supplemented with 50\% of the
   recommended fertilizer (3.9-4.6 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)), maize grown between
   Leucaena hedgerows without fertilizer (3.0 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) and sole
   maize receiving the recommended fertilizer (2.8 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)), which
   translated to increases in RUE of 202\%, 139\% and 85\%, respectively,
   over the control. RUE was more stable in the maize grown between
   Leucaena hedgerows than in the fully fertilized maize. On all sites RUE
   was least stable in the control. Yield stability in the maize-Leucaena
   association was not significantly different from the fully fertilized
   maize on the Zambian sites. On the Nigerian site, maize yields were more
   stable in maize grown in Leucaena hedgerows than in fully fertilized
   sole maize. Supplementation of maize grown in Leucaena hedgerows with
   50\% of the recommended fertilizers resulted in greater yield stability.
   It is concluded that intercropping cereals with legume trees and
   supplementation with inorganic fertilizer can increase rain use
   efficiency and yield stability in rain-fed agriculture in SSA. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli is a serious threat to human and animal
   health, with antimicrobial drug resistance contributing to the problem.
   Alternative mechanisms of prevention and treatment of E. coli-induced
   diarrhoea include those targeting biofilm production and quorum sensing,
   properties that have been associated with some investigated plant
   extracts. Plants were selected from various genera, including Vachellia,
   Senegalia, Morus, Leucaena, Salix, Grewia, Ziziphus, Searsia,
   Dichrostachys and Ceratonia, based on their known antimicrobial
   activity. The antibacterial effects of leaf extracts against
   multidrug-resistant E. coli O157:H7 were investigated using a broth
   microdilution method, and cytotoxicity to normal mammalian cell lines
   was studied using a tetrazolium colorimetric assay. Subsequently,
   antibiofilm activity and inhibition of extracellular polymeric substance
   (EPS) production by plant extracts against E. coli O157:H7 was
   investigated using crystal violet as a staining dye after 0 and 24 h
   incubation and carbohydrate estimation 5 \% phenol-sulfuric assay. The
   biosensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472 was used to study
   the anti-quorum sensing potential of the selected plant extracts. Cell
   motility, cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH), and aggregation were also
   investigated. All plant extracts had weak antibacterial activity (MIC >
   0.62 mg/ml) with relatively low cytotoxicity. The acetone extracts of
   Salix babylonica and Leucaena leucocephala prevented bacterial cell
   attachment (0 h) by 81.21 \% and 89.36 \%, respectively. Approximately
   28 \% of plant extracts eradicated established biofilms by more than 50
   \%, however, they were unable to inhibit EPS production above 30 \%. The
   halfmaximal concentration of extracts generally inhibited violacein
   production (ranging from 0.01 to 0.02 mg/ ml), with V. erioloba acetone
   extract being the most effective at quorum quenching. Some plant
   extracts exhibited a significant difference (p<0.05) in motility,
   aggregation and hydrophobicity compared to untreated cells. This study
   highlights the potential of selected plant extracts to act via different
   mechanisms of action to decrease virulence of enteric E. coli,
   motivating further investigation of the bioactive compounds in the
   leaves. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

Title = {Wild harvest: distribution and diversity of wild food plants in rice

Abstract = {Rice fields provide not only a staple food but are also bio-diverse and
   multi-functional ecosystems. Wild food plants are important elements of
   biodiversity in rice fields and are critical components to the
   subsistence of poor farmers. The spatial and seasonal distribution of
   wild food plants were analysed across different sub-systems occurring
   within paddy ecosystems in two adjacent rice farming villages in
   Kalasin, Northeast Thailand. Data were collected in 102 sampling sites
   corresponding to seven subsystems including tree rows, mounds, field
   margins, shelters, ponds, pond margins and levees. Frequency of
   occurrence and absolute abundance were quantified for each species in
   the two seasons of two years, and data on uses of wild food plant
   species were collected through focus group discussions. A total of 42
   species from 28 botanical families were reported, and one third of these
   have been classified as weeds of rice by other authors. Results show
   that species abundance, frequency of occurrence and diversity varied
   seasonally and spatially within paddy rice ecosystems. Higher diversity
   indexes were observed in the monsoon in most sub-systems. The most
   diverse sub-systems in the monsoon were shelters, mounds and pond
   margins, and tree rows and mounds in the dry season. Field margins,
   ponds and levees presented lower diversity, but are habitat of aquatic
   species important for the local diet, such as Ipomoea aquatica and
   Marsilea crenata. The herbs Lobelia sp. and Glinus oppositifolius,
   classified as rice weeds, were most abundant species in the dry season
   and frequently consumed. Leucaena leucocephala, of which the roots,
   leaves and fruits are commonly consumed as vegetable, was the most
   abundant tree in most subsystems. More than half of the species were
   specific to one or two sub-systems due to particular niche requirements.
   Three quarters of wild food plant species had additional uses besides
   food; with ten different types of use and multiple use categories
   occurring in the different sub-systems. This study highlights that the
   development of more productive lowland rice systems may jeopardize the
   diversity of wild food plant species in the rice landscape, which is
   important for the food security of the rural poor. (C) 2016 Royal

Abstract = {In a switch-over experiment, eight male animals, four each of sheep and
   goats of local breeds with mean body weight of 26. 8 +/- 2.0 and 30.0
   +/- 2.1 kg, were fed Dichanthium annulatum (DA) grass and four browse
   species viz. Helictris isora, Securengia virosa, Leucaena leucocephala
   (LL) and Hardwickia binnata (HB) in four feeding trials to assess their
   supplementary effect on activity of rumen enzymes. The sheep and goats
   were offered DA grass with individual browse in 75:25 and 50:50
   proportions, respectively, for more than 3 months during each feeding
   trial, and rumen liquor samples were collected twice at 0 and 4 h post
   feeding after 60 and 90 days of feeding. Glutamate oxaloacetate
   transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and glutamate
   dehydrogenase (GDH) enzymes were determined in the bacteria and protozoa
   fractions of rumen liquor, while cellulase enzyme activity was measured
   in mixed rumen liquor. LL and HB had the highest and lowest contents of
   CP, while fibre contents were lower in early than later browse leaves.
   Supplementation of browse leaves significantly (P < 0.05) affect the
   specific activity of GDH enzyme in bacteria fraction of rumen liquor of
   animal species, while GDH activity was similar in protozoa fraction of
   rumen liquor of sheep and goats on all DA grass-browse-supplemented
   diets except DA-HB (42.8 units/mg protein), where activity was
   significantly (P < 0.05) low. Specific activities of GOT and GPT enzymes
   in both bacteria and protozoa fractions of rumen liquor differ
   significantly (P < 0.05) due to supplementation of browse leaves to DA
   grass. Browse leaves significantly (P < 0.05) affect the cellulase
   enzyme activity in animal rumen liquor, being highest on DA-LL (193.4)
   and lowest on DA-HB diet (144.8 mu g sugar/mg protein). Goat exhibited
   higher activities of GOT and GPT than sheep in both bacteria and
   protozoa fraction of rumen liquor, while cellulase activity was similar
   between the animal species on the grass-browse leaves diets. Results
   indicate that browse leaves supplementation affect the enzyme activities
   of sheep and goats rumen, while the goats rumen liquor had higher
   activities of GOT, GPT and GDH enzyme than sheep.},

Abstract = {Thirty-one rhizobial strains isolated from nodules of legumes native of
   Xinjiang, China, were characterized. These strains were classified as
   belonging to the genus Rhizobium based on amplified 16S rDNA restriction
   analysis (ARDRA). The strains were distinguished from recognized
   Rhizobium species using analysis of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacers
   (IGS-RFLP), SDS- PAGE analysis of whole proteins and BOX-PCR; the test
   strains always formed a distinct cluster with patterns that were quite
   different from those of the reference rhizobial strains used. According
   to the phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene, the test
   strains belonged to the genus Rhizobium, with Rhizobium tropici,
   Rhizobium rhizogenes and Rhizobium lusitanum as the closest related
   species, with 99.6, 99.2 and 99.4\% sequence similarities, respectively,
   between the type strains of the three Rhizobium species and strain CCBAU
   83401 T. Phylogenetic analyses of the representative strains using IGS
   and atpD, recA and glnll genes all confirmed the phylogenetic
   arrangements obtained using the 16S rRNA gene. The DNA-DNA relatedness
   values between strain CCBAU 83401(T) and strains CCBAU 83364, CCBAU
   83345. and CCBAU 83523 ranged from 80.8 to 100 \%, showing that they
   belong to the same species. The DNA-DNA relatedness between strain CCBAU
   8340 1 T and R. tropici IIB CIAT 899(T), R. tropici IIA CFN 299, R.
   rhizogenes LMG 150(T) and R. lusitanum P1-7(T) were 26.9, 27.7, 38.2 and
   22.6 \%, respectively, clearly indicating that strain CCBAU 83401(T)
   represents a novel species. Phenotypic characterization of four
   representative strains, CCBAU 83401, CCBAU 83364, CCBAU 83345 and CCBAU
   83523, showed several distinctive features that differentiated them from
   closely related species. The 31 strains had identical nodD and nifH
   genes, which were very similar to those of the bean-nodulating R.
   lusitanum, Devosia neptuniae and R. tropici IIB. Based upon these
   results, the strains from this study are considered to represent a novel
   species, for which the name Rhizobium multihospitium sp. nov. is
   proposed. The DNA G + C content ranged from 65.3 to 66.0 mol\% (T(m)).
   The type strain is CCBAU 83401(T) (=LMG 23946(T)=HAMBI 2975(T)), which
   nodulates Robinia pseudoacacia, but not Leucaena leucocephala, Phaseolus

Abstract = {The widespread planting of Sesbania sesban fallows for replenishing soil
   fertility in eastern Zambia has the potential of causing pest outbreaks
   in the future. The pure S. sesban fallows may not produce enough biomass
   needed for replenishing soil fertility in degraded soils. Therefore, an
   experiment was conducted at Kagoro in Katete district in the Eastern
   Province of Zambia from 1997 to 2002 to test whether multi-species
   fallows, combining non-coppicing with coppicing tree species, are better
   than mono-species fallows of either species for soil improvement and
   increasing subsequent maize yields. Mono-species fallows of S. sesban
   (non-coppicing), Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia
   angustissima ( all three coppicing), and mixed fallows of G. sepium+ S.
   sesban, L. leucocephala + S. sesban, A. angustissima + S. sesban and
   natural fallow were compared over a three-year period. Two maize (Zea
   mays) crops were grown subsequent to the fallows. The results
   established that S. sesban is poorly adapted and G. sepium is superior
   to other species for degraded soils. At the end of three years, sole G.
   sepium fallow produced the greatest total biomass of 22.1 Mg ha(-1) and
   added 27 kg ha(-1) more N to soil than G. sepium + S. sesban mixture.
   During the first post-fallow year, the mixed fallow at 3.8 Mg ha(-1)
   produced 77\% more coppice biomass than sole G. sepium, whereas in the
   second year both sole G. sepium and the mixture produced similar amounts
   of biomass (1.6 to 1.8 Mg ha(-1)). The G. sepium + S. sesban mixture
   increased water infiltration rate more than sole G. sepium, but both
   these systems had similar effects in reducing soil resistance to
   penetration compared with continuous maize without fertilizer. Although
   sole G. sepium produced high biomass, it was G. sepium + S. sesban mixed
   fallow which resulted in 33\% greater maize yield in the first
   post-fallow maize. However, both these G. sepium-based fallows had
   similar effects on the second post-fallow maize. Thus the results are
   not conclusive on the beneficial effects of G. sepium + S. sesban
   mixture over sole G. sepium.},

Abstract = {A feeding and management system of female calves was used to study their
   performance and development in an association of grasses with a mixture
   of legumes. Forty crossbred (Holstein x Zebu) female calves with 145 kg
   live weight and eight months of age were selected, according to a
   completely randomized design. They were distributed in two treatments:
   A) star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis), associated with a legumes Mixture
   of kudzu (Pueraria phaseoloides). butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea).
   teramnus (Teranums labialis), stylo (Stylosanthes guianensis), centro
   (Centrosema pubescens), glycine (Neonotonia wightii) and leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala), as natural stake and B) star grass. Both groups
   rotated in six paddocks with a stocking rate of 1.5 LAU/ha. The
   occupation time on each paddock was five and seven days in the rainy and
   dry seasons, respectively. The pasture was neither irrigated nor
   fertilized. The annuals from group B were given, in both seasons, 1
   kg/animal/d of a supplement with 86\% dry matter (DM), 11.84\% crude
   protein (CP) and 10.8 MJ/kg of DM of metabolizable energy (NE), whereas
   group A received this supplement only in the dry season. The animals
   were weighed every 15 d and cross height, thorax perimeter and body
   length were measured. Pasture availability and DM, CP, Ca and P content
   were determined monthly. Duncan's test was used when necessary. The
   forage balance was positive for the group that grazed the
   multi-association. The eatable DM supply for this group surpassed 5
   kg/100 kg of live weight. The increase in daily live weight (452 vs 336
   g/animal/d) showed differences (P < 0.001) and favored the female calves
   in the associated system. The thorax perimeter of the animals increased
   differently (P < 0.001) between the groups studied and it was higher
   (15.7 vs 12.1 cm) in the multi-association treatment, which evidenced
   its superiority in feeding. The results showed an adequate potential for
   live weight gain.. specifically in the dry season (452 g). This was in
   correspondence with the high growth and development of the female cattle
   in the calf stage.},

Title = {Invasive plants facilitated by socioeconomic change harbor vectors of
   scrub typhus and spotted fever},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Background
   Ecological determinants of most emerging vector-borne diseases are
   understudied, particularly for neglected tropical disease. Moreover,
   although socioeconomic impacts can have significant downstream effects
   on human risks to vector-borne diseases via a change in land cover,
   particularly facilitating the invasion of exotic plants, related studies
   remains very scarce. Scrub typhus and spotted fever are neglected
   diseases emerging around the globe and are transmitted by chigger mites
   and ticks infective of Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp.,
   respectively, with small mammals as the primary hosts of both vectors.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We investigated how invasions of the plant Leucaena leucocephala caused
   by widespread abandonment of farmlands driven by industrialization
   affected abundance of chiggers and ticks in Penghu Island, Taiwan. We
   determined ectoparasite abundance by trapping small mammals in three
   types of habitats (invasion site, agricultural field, human residential)
   every two months for a year. Based on ectoparasite burdens, invasion
   sites harbored more chiggers and ticks than the other two habitats.
   Furthermore, hosts maintained higher burdens of both vectors in early
   winter and burdens of chiggers were more stable across seasons in
   invasion sites, suggesting that sites with invasive plants could be a
   temporary refuge for both vectors and might help mitigate the negative
   influence of unfavorable climate. Infective rates of 0. tsutsugamushi in
   chiggers and Rickettsia in ticks were also consistently not lower in
   invasion sites. Top soil temperature and relative humidity were similar
   across the three habitats, but invasion sites contained more of the rat
   Rattus losea, on which chiggers and ticks were more engorged than those
   from the most commonly trapped species (Suncus murinus shrew),
   indicating that abundance of the host R. losea instead of microclimate
   might better determine the abundance of both vectors.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This study highlights an important but largely neglected issue that
   socioeconomic change can have unexpected consequences for human health
   induced particularly by invasive plants, which could become a hotspot
   for emerging infectious diseases but usually are very hard to be
   eradicated. In the future, a more comprehensive approach that integrates
   socioeconomics, land use, exotic species, and human health should be
   considered to fully understand potential emergence of vector-borne
   diseases.},

Abstract = {To decrease adverse environmental impacts of fertilizer N and to
   decrease input costs in agroecosystems, there is a renewed interest in
   using green manure to maintain soil fertility. Nitrogen mineralization
   from the leaves of two leguminous {[}Leucaena leucocephala (Lamb.) de
   Witt. and Acacia nilotica (Linn.) Willd. ex Del.] and two nonleguminous
   (Azadirachta indica A. Jussieu and Melia azedarach L.) tree species was
   compared in a sandy loam soil (Typic Camborthids) at constant
   temperature (35 degrees C) and moisture (-0.03 MPa). The cumulative
   amounts of mineralized N from the leaves of four tree species increased
   with increasing incubation periods; however, the magnitude of N
   mineralization decreased with an increase in the incubation period and
   the amount of tree leaves applied to the soil. Mineralization patterns
   of all four species were almost identical, but the mineralization rate
   differed markedly among leaf materials. Ar 100 mg of leaf material added
   per gram of soil, the amount of net mineralized N was of the order L.
   leucocephala (323 mg kg(-1) soil) > M. azedarach (315 mg kg(-1) soil) >
   A. indica (269 mg kg(-1) soil) > A. nilotica (70 mg kg(-1) soil). The
   nitrogen mineralization potentials (N-0) differed markedly among the
   four tree species. It ranged from 71 (A. nilotica) to 284 mg per
   kilogram of soil (L. leucocephala) at 25 mg of leaf material added per
   gram of soil, and from 82 to 332 mg per kilogram of soil at 100 mg of
   leaf material added per gram of soil for the same corresponding tree
   species. Irrespective of added leaf material concentrations, the
   mineralization potential (N-0) of the leaves was also of the order L.
   leucocephala > M. azedarach > A. indica > A. nilotica. The N
   mineralization rate constants (k) did not differ significantly among L.
   leucocephala, M. azedarach, and A. indica except between L. leucocephala
   and M. azedarach or A. indica at 25 mg of leaf material material per
   grams of soil amendment but were significantly higher than those of A.
   nilotica at all concentrations of added leaf material. In this study the
   N content and C/N ratio were found to best describe N mineralization

Title = {Great Facilitation of Thirty Years of Reforestation with Mixed Species
   to Ecosystem Nitrogen Accumulation in Dry-Hot Valley in the Jinsha River},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Nitrogen is a key factor influencing ecosystem structure and function in
   reforestation, but knowledge of ecosystem nitrogen accumulation through
   reforestation with mixed species is limited. Especially in the dry-hot
   valley of the Jinsha River, no studies cover total ecosystem nitrogen
   accumulation in mature plantations and its allocation for difficulty in
   collecting tree roots and deep soil from dry red soil. In this study,
   nitrogen accumulation of seven mixed plantations in the dry-hot valley
   in the Jinsha River was studied after thirty years of reforestation with
   an analogous sites method. The results were as follows: (1) Soil
   nitrogen stocks decreased with depth in the soil profile. Deep soil
   nitrogen storage (20-80 cm) was significantly correlated with stand age
   (R-2 = 0.752, p = 0.000; n = 7), accounting for 56-63\% of total soil
   nitrogen storage and 43-47\% of soil nitrogen accumulation in the
   dry-hot valley. (2) Total biomass nitrogen stock of the 30-year-old
   plantation was 1.22 t ha(-1), 61 times that of degraded wasteland and
   7.6 times that of natural recovery shrub grassland, and it recovered to
   the reference level of natural forest following 30 years of
   reforestation. (3) Total ecosystem nitrogen stock in the 30-year-old
   plantation was 12.72 t ha(-1), 1.4 times the reference wasteland and
   1.19 times the natural recovery shrub grassland. The contribution of
   soil nitrogen to ecosystem nitrogen storage and accumulation was 90\%
   and 67\%, respectively. Litter nitrogen accounted for 1.6\% ecosystem
   nitrogen storage. It indicated that reforestation with mixed plantation
   of Leucaena leucocephala and other species greatly facilitated more
   ecosystem nitrogen accumulation, especially soil nitrogen (including
   deep compartment). Secondary biomass nitrogen, especially litter, could
   not be overlooked. This study filled the gap of ecosystem nitrogen
   storage and distribution during reforestation in the dry-hot valley.
   Mixed plantation with legume species such as L. leucocephala and other
   species and an important role of secondary biomass, especially litter in
   nitrogen accumulation, provided a reference for the strategy formulation
   of reforestation and forest nitrogen management in the dry-hot valley
   and other semi-arid or arid regions.},

Title = {Efficacy, persistence and presence of Synergistes jonesii in
   cattle grazing leucaena in Queensland: on-farm observations pre- and
   post-inoculation},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {53},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1065-1074},
Abstract = {A study of eight commercial cattle herds grazing leucaena (Leucaena
   leucocephala subsp. glabrata) pastures was undertaken to determine (1)
   the efficacy of in vitro Synergistes jonesii inoculum (produced in an
   anaerobic fermenter) in degrading the dihydroxypyridone (DHP) isomers
   produced during digestion of leucaena forage; and (2) the persistence of
   the inoculum in the rumen of cattle following a period grazing
   non-leucaena pastures.
   Cattle were introduced to the leucaena pastures for an initial period
   varying from 17 to 71 days. Fourteen to fifteen animals were then
   sampled for (1) urine and blood plasma to determine toxicity status as
   indicated by concentration of DHP;(2) faeces for estimation of diet
   composition; and (3) rumen fluid for detection of S. jonesii by nested
   polymerase PCR analysis. After a further 42-56 days, animals were
   resampled as before to confirm toxicity status and inoculated with the
   in vitro S. jonesii inoculum; the herds were then sampled a third time
   (42-60 days after inoculation) to test the effectiveness of the inoculum
   in degrading DHP.
   Five of the herds were then removed from leucaena pastures for periods
   ranging from 80 to 120 days and returned to leucaena pastures for 21
   days to check persistence of the inoculum as indicated by retention of
   capacity to degrade DHP.
   The data indicated (1) a very slow build up of capacity to degrade DHP
   isomers on some properties before inoculation; (2) frequent occurrence
   of high levels of 2,3-DHP in urine indicating partial toxin degradation,
   both before and after inoculation; (3) a low incidence of detection of
   S. jonesii in rumen fluid after inoculation based on nested PCR
   analysis; (4) failure of inoculation to degrade DHP on one of two
   properties tested; and (5) loss of capacity to degrade DHP on some
   properties after <4 months on alternative non-leucaena pastures.
   It was concluded that while most herds showed some capability to degrade
   DHP due to some residual capability from previous exposure, they did not
   achieve the same rapid and complete DHP degradation reported in the
   1980s. Nevertheless, it was concluded that the in vitro inoculum was at
   least partially effective and should continue to be used by graziers
   until improved sources of inoculum and/or inoculation methodologies are
   demonstrated.},

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Agroforestry systems involving leaf removal for animal fodder may result
   in rapid depletion of soil fertility. The purpose of this research was
   to determine if the effects of leaf removal on soil fertility parameters
   and maize yield in a Leucaena leucocephala alley cropping system could
   be reversed. Three leaf management strategies in a Leucaena alley
   cropping trial that had been in effect from 1987 to 1991 were
   investigated: 1) leaves returned, 2) leaves removed, and 3) leaves
   removed, with 100 kg inorganic N ha(-1) added. In the 1990/91 season, a
   3(4) confounded factorial design was utilized to investigate the effects
   of leaf management strategy, N rate (0, 30 and 60 kg N ha(-1)); maize
   plant population (14,800, 29,600, and 44,400 plants ha(-1)); and P rate
   (0, 18, and 35 kg P ha(-1)). In the 1991/92 and 1992/93 seasons, leaves
   were applied equally to all plots, and no P was applied. The N rate and
   plant population treatments were continued, and the same confounded
   factorial design was implemented to investigate residual leaf management
   strategy, residual P rate, n rate, and plant population. The yield gap
   between the plots where leaves had been returned vs. removed narrowed
   each season due to uniform leaf application. Application of N improved
   yields during both seasons. Residual effects of the initial P
   application decreased to only 10\% of the total yield in 1992/93. Plant
   population affected yields only during the season of very good rainfall.
   Leaf additions resulted in a relative increase in soil pH, total N, and
   exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K and a decrease C/N ratio in plots that had
   not previously received leaves. Leaves supplied more K and Zn to the
   upper 15 cm of soil than were being extracted by the maize crop, but
   uniform leaf additions eliminated differences in K and Zn uptake. Plant
   Zn uptake decreased with increasing P rate and plant population, and
   increased with increasing N rate and a history of leaf return. The
   results show that applying leaves equilibrated yields within two
   seasons, and resulted in a relative improvement of several soil
   properties. The residual effect from P applications was not adequate to
   maximize yields.},

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {The effect of tannins in browse supplements on intake, digestibility and
   live weight changes was evaluated using sixty-six male Ethiopian Menz
   sheep in a 90-day trial. Teff straw (Eragrostis tef) was fed ad libitum
   (control diet), or supplemented with 190 g dried leaves of six Sesbania
   sesban accessions with increasing levels of condensed tannin (S1, S2,
   S3, S4, S5 and S6), lablab (Dolichos lablab), tagasaste (Chamaecytisus
   palmensis), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and goetzei (Sesbania
   goetzei), in a completely randomized block design. The condensed tannins
   were highest in goetzei, S6, S5 and leucaena, intermediate in S4, S3, S2
   and S1, and lowest in tagasaste and lablab. The forages differed
   significantly (P < 0.05) in their rates of degradation and truly
   undegradable dry matter. Lablab had lower water solubility and higher (P
   < 0.05) truly undegradable dry matter than the other browse supplements.
   With increasing tannin levels among Sesbania accessions, there was a
   significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the rate of degradation. Animals
   supplemented with forage legumes with low condensed tannin levels such
   as lablab, S1, S2, and S3 had a lower teff straw intake than those on
   the control diet. The converse was true for those fed with the high
   tannin supplements such as S4, S5, S6 and goetzei. Supplementation
   significantly (P < 0.05) increased total dry matter intake and live
   weight gains (LWG). The animals on the control diet lost weight (-1.9
   g/kgW(0.75)), while the supplemented animals gained between 2.9 and 4.4
   g/kgW(0.75) daily. Leucaena supplementation promoted higher (P < 0.05)
   LWG than lablab, S1 and goetzei. With increasing tannin levels among
   Sesbania accessions, there was an increase (S1 < S2 < S3 < S4) followed
   by a decrease (S6 > S5 > goetzei) in LWG. The digestibilities of total
   DM and the supplements did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) between
   the diets, although the neutral detergent fibre (NDF) digestibility
   decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with supplementation. The control
   diet had significantly higher NDF digestibility than the leucaena, S3,
   S4, S5 and S6 supplemented diets. Results have beneficial attributes at
   low levels in ruminants. Condensed tannins confer important advantages
   in ruminant nutrition with respect to the prevention of excessive
   degradation of protein in the rumen.},

Abstract = {Background: After suffering from an acute problem of excess water for a
   long time, the Oasis of Ouargla benefited from an aerated lagoon
   treatment plant, producing biologically treated domestic effluents. The
   aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of reusing this
   effluent for watering plants. The experiment was conducted in the
   Ouargla WWTP, which is located in the region of Said Otba (northeast of
   Ouargla), north of the national road NR 49.
   Methods: The study area was selected based on the originality of the
   study and availability of water. The plants used were Acacia farnesiana
   and Leucaena leucocephala. The selection of Leucaena was based on the
   following criteria: It is used as a windbreak, it is very tolerant to
   drought, and it is used as a fodder to maintain soil fertility. And,
   Acacia was selected because it is used as a fodder, protects the soil
   against erosion, and to fix nitrogen. The watering of these plants is
   done jointly by treated wastewater from the WWTP and well water (WW), of
   which the latter was used as a control. Sampling and analysis of the
   irrigation water were performed according to the experimental protocol.
   To show the growth rate of the two plants studied, biometric
   measurements were taken weekly for 25 weeks.
   Results: The physicochemical analyses show that the treated wastewater
   is of poor quality belonging to the last class of Riverside's C5-S4,
   with an excessive salinity (EC) of 13.51 dS/m and an Sodium adsorption
   ratio (SAR) of 12.61 against EC of 2.49 dS/m and 2.13 for the WW. At the
   end of the experiment, it was found that irrigation with purified
   wastewater (PWW) gave less growth compared to that with WW. Statistical
   analyses of the biometric measurements confirmed that there is a highly
   significant difference atP < 0.05.
   Conclusion: The reuse of WWTP effluent gives less interesting results
   but is still possible. It is recommended to choose Salt-tolerant crops,
   as well as the dilution of these waters by the addition of less salty
   waters.},

Abstract = {Soil biota have strong effects on plants, but we have a poor
   understanding of how plant chemistry might modify these effects. We
   examined the effect of soil biota associated with an exotic invasive
   tree, Prosopis juliflora, versus that associated with native species,
   from seven sites across India on conspecifics and two other plant
   species. We then measured changes in species-specific soil biota effects
   (identified as plant-soil feedbacks, PSFs) when leaf leachate from P.
   juliflora or from native plant species was added to soil containing
   respective live and sterile soil inoculum.We quantified the amino acid
   L-tryptophan from leaf leachate of P. juliflora, Leucaena leucocephala
   (another invader), and two native species. We also tested effects of P.
   juliflora or native species soil inoculum amendment of tryptophan on P.
   juliflora, P. cineraria and L. leucocephala across seven sites. We then
   quantified the microbially metabolized derivatives of tryptophan,
   phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and intermediates after adding
   tryptophan into P. juliflora and native soils.Soil biota associated with
   P. juliflora generated positive effects on conspecifics and L.
   leucocephala, but negative effects on the native congener P. cineraria.
   When P. juliflora leaf leachate was added to soil with live P. juliflora
   inoculum, PSFs became more positive for P. juliflora and other species,
   compared to leaf leachate amended with sterile soil inoculum. Native
   leaf leachate interacted weakly with soil biota to impact biomass of
   conspecifics and heterospecifics.There was roughly 10x more tryptophan
   in the leaf leachate of P. juliflora than in the leaf leachate of other
   species. Tryptophan generally increased positive PSFs associated with P.
   juliflora relative to soil biota associated with other plant species.
   When tryptophan was added to live P. juliflora soil, IAA and its
   intermediates were produced at five of seven sites, and at four of these
   sites soil biota from P. juliflora had positive PSFs.Synthesis. These
   results provide the first experimental evidence that a chemical leached
   from the leaves of an invader regulates PSFs. Our results indicate that
   canopy effects and PSFs, which are usually studied independently, can
   interact in ways that strongly affect conspecifics and neighbouring
   species.},

   provided by native trees, and contribute to biotic homogenization. To
   quantify the degree of invasion by non-native trees in the United
   States, we combined two broad-scale datasets: (1) tree species
   occurrence data from the national Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)
   plot network and (2) ecoregions characterized by relatively homogeneous
   environmental conditions. Using the FIA statistical design, we created
   an indicator of non-native tree regeneration success by estimating the
   proportion of small trees (seedlings and saplings) relative to all trees
   for non-native species in the conterminous United States and southeast
   Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Species with at least 75 percent of
   their stems consisting of smaller stems were classified as highly
   invasive while those with 60 percent to 75 percent of smaller stems were
   classified as moderately invasive. Above these thresholds, non-native
   species are of ecological concern because they are established and
   reproducing successfully and therefore likely to continue to spread in
   the future. For the conterminous United States and southeast Alaska, we
   identified 16 highly invasive and four moderately invasive non-native
   tree species. Widespread highly invasive and relatively well-established
   species included Ailanthus altissima, Triadica sebifera, and Ulmus
   pumila. The richness of highly invasive species was the highest in parts
   of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic States, followed by much of the
   Southeast. In Hawaii, we identified seven highly invasive and three
   moderately invasive non-native tree species. The most widespread highly
   invasive and well-established tree species in the archipelago were
   Psidium cattleyanum, Psidium guajava, Ardisia elliptica, and Syzygium
   cumini. The largest numbers of highly invasive species were inventoried
   in the lowland/leeward dry and mesic forests of O'ahu and the lowland
   wet and mesic forests of Hawai'i Island. Puerto Rico had 17 highly
   invasive and two moderately invasive tree species. The most widespread
   and well-established non-native species were Leucaena leucocephala,
   Spathodea campanulata, Coffea arabica, Syzygium jambos, and Melicoccus
   bijugatus. The results of this assessment offer insights into which
   species are most likely to alter forest ecosystems and which forests may
   be effectively managed to control invasive trees.},

Abstract = {In present study 20 Dichanthium annulatum-DA grass based diets
   formulated with browse foliage from 5 tree leaves (Hardwickia binata-HB,
   Albizia lebbek-AL, Grewia optiva-GO, Anogeissus pendulla-AP and Leucaena
   leucocephala-LL) and five shrubs (Dichrostachys cineria-DC, Securengia
   virosa-SV, Zizyphus xylophyrus-ZX, Helictris isora-HI and Acacia
   catechu-AC) in 50:50 and 75: 25 ratios were assessed for in vitro
   nutrients degradation, metabolites and gas production using sheep and
   goat rumen liquor. CP, NDF, ADF and cellulose contents differ
   significantly (P<0.05) amongst the diets. CP contents were higher in DA:
   LL (9.55) and DA: AL (8.58) diets and lowest in DA: HB diet (4.87\%),
   while NDF, ADF and cellulose contents were higher in DA: AL (62.86,
   42.09 and 32.82\%) and lowest in DA: LL (55.15, 31.75 and 24.24 \%).
   Mean values of DM, CP, NDF and ADF degradability varied significantly
   across diets in rumen inoculum of both species. DA: LL, DA: SV and DA:
   GO diets had higher DM, CP, NDF and ADF degradability in rumen liquor of
   both animal species. TVFA, total-N and ammonia-N contents were higher in
   sheep and goat from DA: LL, DA: SV and DA: GO diets. Sheep and goat
   rumen liquor had higher mean total-N contents at 50:50 ration of
   grass-foliage diets (45.36 and 47.57) than at 75: 25 ratio (36.00 and
   36.96 mg/dl, respectively. Mean values of IVDMD (\%), gas (mug) and
   partition factor differed across the diets in both species. Diets mean
   values for IVDMD and gas tended to be more for goats (167.50 and 54.13)
   than sheep (142.99 ml/g and 52.25\%), while partition factor values
   tended to be more for sheep (3.58) than goats (3.01). DA: LL, DA: GO and
   DA: SV diets had higher gas and IVDMD in rumen liquor of both species
   and lowest for DA: DC diet. Results showed that DA: LL, DA: GO and DA:
   SV have higher nutrients digestibility with higher metabolites
   concentration on fermentation in sheep and goat rumen liquor.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the livestock areas of a
   community that borders on a nature reserve in Chiapas. Pasturing units
   were classified, net aerial primary production was calculated as well as
   the digestibility of the predominant grass species (Brachiaria
   brizantha). Additionally, grazing burden was calculated and compared to
   the carrying capacity of the pastures. Three types of pastoral units
   were identified in relation to their tree density: Low Tree Density
   Pasture (24\%), Medium Tree Density Pasture (54\%), and High Tree
   Density Pasture (22\%). Tree community composition mainly included
   citrus species such as orange (Citrus cinensis) and mandarine (Citrus
   aurantium), as well as forage trees such as Guazuma ulmifolia,
   Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala. The grass species Bra
   chiaria brizantha was identified in 85\% of the pasture areas. In order
   to evaluate the effect of the type of pastoral unit and the cutting date
   on the primary production year(-1) ha(-1) of B. brizantha, a divided
   parcel design was designed with random complete blocks. No significant
   differences were found between types of pastoral units, but they were
   found between distinct cutting dates (15,30 and 45 days), with the
   primary production reaching its height at 45 days (11 398 yearl ha(-1)).
   Dry matter content and in vitro digestibility of B. brizantha were not
   influenced by the cutting date, but were influenced by the type of
   pastoral unit. The greatest dry matter content was obtained in Open
   pasture (37.9\%), while the Medium tree density had the highest
   Digestibility (41.1\%). The optimum point for grass use efficiency
   (found by combining highest primary production and digestibility) was
   found at 24 days. A total of 547 bovines were identified in the
   community, which represent 497 animal units and an apparent animal
   burden of 1.34 AU ha(-1). Taking the carrying capacity of pastures and
   an assignation of 5\% as a reference, each hectare of pasture can
   sustain a maximum of 1.17 AU per day. Results suggest that 45\% of
   producers overgraze their pastures, 43\% underuse them, and 12\% achieve
   an appropriate use of pastures. These data can be used by conservation
   institutions to plan and regulate livestock raising activities in areas
   of conservation and high diversity.},

Abstract = {A system of management and feeding of female cattle between the 12
   months of age and their incorporation to reproduction (heifer stage) was
   studied to know their performance and development when grazing in an
   assosiation of grasses with a mixture of legumes. Thirty crossbred
   (Holstein x Zebu) heifers of 170 kg of liveweight and approximately 12
   months of age were selected according to completely randomized design.
   They were distributed in two treatments: A) Grazing of Pennisetum (Cuba
   CT-115) associated with a mixture of legumes including glycine
   (Neonotonia wightii) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and B) Grazing
   of star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis). Both groups rotated in six paddocks
   with a stocking rate of 1.5 LAU/ha remaining in the paddock for five and
   seven days in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. The sward was
   neither irrigated nor fertilized. The animals in group B were given, in
   both seasons, 1 kg/animal/d of a supplement with 86 \% dry matter (DM),
   11.84 \% crude protein (CP) and 10.8 MJ of metabolizable energy (ME) per
   kilogram of dry matter. The group A only received 0.5 kg of this
   supplement in the dry season. The heifers were weighed every 15 d. The
   availability of pasture and DM, CP, Ca and P were determined monthly.
   The forage balance manifested that in the group that grazed the
   multiassociation the DM supply was higher than 5 kg/100 kg of liveweight
   in both seasons. This did not occurred in the system with only the
   grass. The daily liveweight increase differed (P < 0.001) and was higher
   in the heifers that grazed in the associated system. The thoraxic
   perimeter was increased in the asssociated group (P < 0.001), being
   superior in 3.5 cm (15.7 cm vs 12.1 cm). This group manifested also its
   superiority in feeding. The results indicated that CT-115, associated
   with legumes and rotational management, balanced the DM supply in both
   seasons and showed a good potential for liveweight gain. This surpassed
   500 g/d, corresponding to a good growth and development for this stage
   in female cattle.},

Abstract = {The nine tree forages Carissa spinarum, Ficus roxburghii, Hippophae
   rhamnoides, Leucaena leucocephala, Melia azedarach, Quercus incana,
   Robinia pseudoacacia, Zizyphus jujuba, Zizyphus nummularia, and the
   three conventional forages paddy straw, wheat straw and mixed grass hay
   were analysed for chemical composition, phenolics, protein precipitation
   capacity (PPC), polyethylene glycol binding capacity (PEGBC) and rumen
   fermentation characteristics. The rumen degradability characteristics
   with and without polyethylene glycol (PEG) were studied in vitro by gas
   production. The crude protein content was more than 200 g/kg dry matter
   (DM) in H. rhamnoides, L. leucocephala, M. azedarach, R. pseudoacacia
   and Z. jujuba. The ash content (g/kg DM) was high in E roxburghii (217)
   and paddy straw (178) while R. pseudoacacia and C. spinarum contained
   higher neutral detergent insoluble N and non-structural carbohydrates,
   respectively. Total phenolics (g/kg DM) ranged from six in paddy straw
   to 122 in H. rhamnoides, concurrent with the highest total tannin
   phenols (103) and hydrolysable tannins (89). The condensed tannins
   ranged from 0.2 in wheat straw to 56 in C. spinarum and H. rhamnoides,
   and C. spinarum had the highest PPC (0.593) and PEGBC (42.3\%). In vitro
   gas production (ml/g) to 24 It ranged from 48.5 in Q. incana to 218.3 in
   M. azedarach. Addition of PEG increased gas volume and in vitro
   disappearing N, and decreased the partitioning factor in C. spinarum, H.
   rhamnoides, Q. incana, Z. jujuba and Z nummularia. The in vitro true
   degradability of DM ranged from 0.337 in local grass hay to 0.820 in M.
   azedarach, which increased upon addition of PEG, except for M. azedarach
   and the conventional forages. Degradability values were negatively
   correlated with neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and
   lignin. Among the tree forages, the nutritional value of M. azedarach,
   L. leucocephala and Z jujuba were ranked as very good on the basis of
   these parameters. Values of the in vitro gas production parameters
   determined in the presence or absence of PEG indicate the relative
   effects of tannins in these forages on substrate degradability and
   nutrient partitioning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Five tropical multi-purpose tree species (MPTS), Enterolobium
   cyclocarpum, Moringa oleifera, Millettia griffoniana, Pterocarpus
   santalinoides and Treculia Africana, and one exotic species (Leucaena
   leucocephala), which acted as the control, planted in a randomized
   complete block design, were selected to evaluate the potentials as feed
   supplements for herds in dry seasons of south-western Nigeria. Samples
   of the MPTS leaves were collected in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, weighed,
   dried and milled for estimation of biomass production, chemical analysis
   and measurement of in vitro gas production. Results showed significant
   differences (P<0.001) in the biomass production of the MPTS. E.
   cyclocarpum consistently recorded the highest biomass production, height
   and collar diameter throughout the experimental period. There were also
   differences (P <= 0.001) in dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether
   extract (EE) and ash contents of the MPTS across species and years after
   planting. M. oleifera recorded the highest CP content of 240 g/kg DM.
   Interactions were observed between species and year for neutral
   detergent fibre (NDFom), acid detergent fibre (ADFom) and lignin
   contents of the MPTS. M. griffoniana and M. oleifera had lower tannin
   contents, whereas E. cyclocarpum, P. santalinoides, T. africana and L.
   leucocephala had higher tannin contents. The values reported for mineral
   contents showed that their levels in the MPTS were adequate for
   ruminants and there were no differences in the contents of most
   minerals. In vitro gas production results showed that the potential gas
   production `b' was highest in M. griffoniana and lowest in P.
   santalinoides and there were species and year interactions (P <= 0.001)
   for volatile fatty acid profiles of the supernatant after 96 h
   incubation. The estimated organic matter digestibility (OMD) and
   metabolizable energy (ME) of the MPTS were generally high. The high
   biomass production, CP and low fibre contents, as well as in vitro
   fermentation characteristics found for the MPTS evaluated in the current
   study suggest that these are better alternatives in comparison with L.
   leucocephala. It can be concluded that the MPTS evaluated have potential
   as sources of feed supplements for ruminants in dry seasons, especially
   in south western Nigeria.},

Abstract = {A 12-week greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the effect of
   the polyphenol, lignin and N contents of six legumes on their N
   mineralization rate in soil and to compare estimates of legume-N release
   by the difference and N-15-recovery methods.  Mature tops of alfalfa
   (Medicago sativa L.), round leaf cassia (Cassia rotundifolia Pers., var.
   Wynn), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala Lam., deWit), Fitzroy stylo
   (Stylosanthes scabra Vog., var Fitzroy), snail medic (Medicago
   scutellata L.), and vigna (Vigna trilobata L., var verde) were
   incorporated in soil at the rate of 100 mg legume N kg-1 soil.  The
   medic and vigna were labeled with N-15.  Sorghum-sudan hybrid (Sorghum
   bicolor, L. Moench) was used as the test crop.  A non-amended treatment
   was used as a control.  Net N mineralization after 12 weeks ranged from
   11\% of added N with cassia to 47\% of added N for alfalfa.  With the
   two legumes that contained less than 20 g kg-1 of N, stylo and cassia,
   there was net N immobilization for the first 6 weeks of the experiment. 
   The legume (lignin + polyphenol):N ratio was significantly correlated
   with N mineralization at all samplings dates at the 0.05 level and at
   the 0.01 level at 6 weeks (r2 = 0.866).  Legume N, lignin, or polyphenol
   concentration or the lignin:N ratio was not significantly correlated
   with N mineralization at any time.  The polyphenol:N ratio was only
   significantly correlated with N mineralization after 9 weeks (r2 =
   0.692).  The (lignin + polyphenol):N ratio appears to be a good
   predictor of N mineralization rates of incorporated legumes, but the
   method for analyzing plant polyphenol needs to be standardized. 
   Estimates of legume-N mineralization by the difference and N-15 recovery
   methods were significantly different at all sampling dates for both
   N-15-labeled legumes.  After 12 weeks, estimates of legume-N
   mineralization averaged 20\% more with the difference method than with
   the N-15 recovery method.  This finding suggests that estimates of
   legume N available to subsequent crops should not be based solely on
   results from N-15 recovery experiments.},

Abstract = {Purified condensed tannins (CT) extracted from the legumes Calliandra
   calothyrsus (var. San Ramon CIAT 22310 and var. Patulul CIAT 22316),
   Flemingia macrophylla (CIAT 17403) and Leucaena leucocephala (CIAT 734)
   were added to soybean meal in proportions of 0 (control), 300, 600 or
   900mg/g of the incubated crude protein (CP). Effects on degradation in
   ruminal fluid and ruminal fluid followed by incubation in HCl/pepsin
   were evaluated using a modified two-step in vitro method. When CT were
   added, dry matter (DM) and CP degradation in ruminal fluid were reduced
   (P<0.001). With the highest concentration of CT (i.e., 900 mg/g CP),
   ruminal DM degradation was reduced to 30\% of the CT-free control. There
   was a 25-63\% reduction in CP degradation in the rumen due to the
   addition of CT. The extent of the effect was dependent on the CT source
   (P<0.001). Depending on CT source, an increase in CT concentration also
   reduced (P<0.001) total DM and CP degradation (ruminal fluid+HCl/pepsin)
   by 24-73\% and 16-55\%, respectively. The proportion of incubated CP
   which was not degraded in ruminal fluid (estimated rumen escape CP) but
   degraded in HCl/pepsin increased by 18 and 412\% depending on CT source
   and CT concentration (P<0.001). The highest increase was observed with
   CT from C. calothyrsus and the lowest with CT from L. leucocephala.
   HCl/pepsin degradability of rumen escape CP was also reduced with CT
   addition by 10 and 82\% depending on CT concentration and source
   (P<0.001). In ruminal fluid, CT from L. leucocephala seemed to have less
   effect on degradation of soybean meal than CT from E macrophylla and C
   calothyrsus. In contrast, when HCl/pepsin was added to soybean meal, the
   complexes formed between CP and CT from L. leucocephala were more
   resistant to degradation than those formed with the other CT. This
   suggests that CT from L. leucocephala were less effective in increasing
   degradable rumen escape CP than CT from either C. calothyrsus or E.
   macrophylla. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Digestibility of some tropical browse species varying in tannin content},

Abstract = {The nylon bag dry matter digestibility (NBDMD) of one grass and 12
   tropical shrubs (10 legumes and two non-legumes) varying in tannin
   content was measured in the rumens of five Droughtmaster steers. Five
   terminal and fully expanded leaves of each shrub were harvested by hand
   plucking, chopped fresh to about 3 mm lengths and incubated (either as
   fresh or after oven-drying at 65 degrees C for 24 h) for 48 h. Chemical
   contents of freeze-dried samples varied widely among species:
   1.59-3.84\% for N, 25.93-53.21\% for NDF, 19.17-39.44\% for ADF and
   1.97-19.36\% for ADL. Extractable condensed tannin levels ranged from
   0.3 to 11.6\% for vanillin/HCl and from 0 to 9.3\% for butanol/HCl
   extraction. Bound tannins also varied, the protein bound component of
   both Gliricidia sepium and Bauhinia rufescens exceeding 2\% of the dry
   matter. B. rufescens also had a high fibre-bound tannin level of 0.9\%.
   Oven drying consistently increased the NDF values and also increased the
   ADF and ADL levels in all species except Calliandra calothyrsus where
   there was a slight depression. However, the effect of oven drying on
   digestibility with this species was dramatic - 78\% for fresh versus
   41\% for dried. For most of the other species NBDMD was similar for
   fresh and dried samples. NBDMD differed among species (p<0.001) from 18
   to 78\% for dried material and from 20 to 78\% for fresh material. It
   was generally low in high tannin species and vice versa except for
   Callinndra calothyrsus which had high NBDMD for fresh material and high
   tannin, and Acacia currasavica which had low NBDMD but only average
   tannin levels. Only 5 of the 10 leguminous browse species evaluated were
   considered to be useful in sown pastures on the basis of their
   digestibility these were Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium,
   Albizia lebbek, Albizia richardiana and Calliandra calothyrsus. The
   non-leguminous, non-tanniniferous Combretum erythrophloeum had the
   highest NBDMD of all the browse species tested. Significant correlations
   existed between NBDMD and NDF, ADF, ADL and extractable tannins but not
   with the bound tannins. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {The use of green manures as alternatives to minimize the usage of
   chemical fertilizers that are very expensive and also environmentally
   unfriendly is considered as a good agronomic practice. However, the
   effect of each green manure on soil properties and crop yield depends on
   its chemical composition. Hence field experiments were conducted in
   sandy soil during 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 to compare impacts of green
   manures (GM) and N15:P15:K15 fertilizer on soil properties, growth, root
   yield, mineral, starch and hydrocyanic acid (HCN) contents of cassava.
   The GM from leaves of: Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.), Moringa
   (Moringa oleifera Lam.), Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp.) and
   Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) were applied at 5 t
   ha(-1), and the NPK fertilizer was applied at 400 kg ha(-1). There was a
   no fertilizer (control). Application of GMs reduced soil bulk density
   and increased soil organic matter (OM), N, P, K, Ca, Mg, growth and
   fresh root yield of cassava compared with the control. The NPK
   fertilizer had no effect on soil bulk density and soil OM, but increased
   soil N, P, K, Ca, Mg, growth and fresh root yield of cassava compared
   with the control. Gliricidia increased growth and fresh root yield of
   cassava compared with other GMs and NPK fertilizer. In the first year
   (2015/2016) and compared with control; Gliricidia, Moringa, Leucaena,
   Neem and NPK fertilizer increased fresh root yield of cassava by 53, 33,
   30, 29 and 28\%, respectively. In the second year (2016/2017), these
   treatments increased fresh root yield of cassava by 85, 65, 61, 60 and
   36\%, respectively. The GMs and NPK fertilizer increased mineral and
   starch contents and reduced HCN content in the cassava tuber roots
   compared with the control. Use of GM has potential to improve soil
   properties, and growth, fresh root yield and nutritional contents of
   cassava than does NPK fertilizer. The Gliricidia treatment best improved
   soil properties and cassava productivity as indicated by the
   benefit:cost ratio. For those growing cassava for fresh root quantity
   Gliricidia is recommended as green manure. Moringa is recommended as
   green manure for those that desire fresh root quality.},

Title = {Feed resource selection of Criollo goats is the result of an interaction
   between plant resources, condensed tannins and Haemonchus
   contortus infection},
Journal = {APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {208},
Pages = {49-55},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The tropical deciduous forest (TDF) is an ecosystem with a heterogeneous
   array of plant species containing different condensed tannin (CT)
   content. Recent studies explored the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   or Haemonchus contortus infection on the intake and feed resource
   selection of goats. These factors have not been investigated
   simultaneously. The present study evaluated the role of infection with
   the abomasal parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus and the effect of
   neutralizing CT with PEG on the feed resource selection of Criollo goats
   in a cafeteria trial. A group of 22 Criollo goats (31.7 +/- 4.8 kg)
   habituated to browse the TDF, were assigned to four groups: two groups
   were artificially infected with H. contortus (6000 L-3 per os) and
   received PEG (50 mg/day) (INF + PEG group) or no PEG (INF group) and the
   other two groups were kept free of infection with moxidectin (0.4 mg/kg
   BW sub-cutaneously) and received either PEG (MOX + PEG) or no PEG (MOX).
   Intake and resource selection of four shrub plant species (Havardia
   albicans, Gymnopodium floribundum, Leucaena leucocephala and Piscidia
   piscipula) by goats, and the dynamics of faecal H. contortus egg
   excretion were determined daily. Intake varied depending on the
   interaction between plant resource and the infection level (P < 0.001),
   and between plant resource and whether goats were dosed with PEG (P <
   0.001). Excretion of H. contortus eggs was decreased by 69\% and 72\%
   for groups with and without PEG administration, respectively. Infected
   groups had a higher CT intake. The use of PEG reduced intake of L.
   leucocephala and increased the selection of H. albicans, a high-CT and
   high crude protein (CP) resource. Animals infected with H. contortus
   ingested more high CT resources. Furthermore, CP intake was lower in PEG
   dosed goats, possibly to reduce the energetic cost associated with
   urinary nitrogen excretion. Selection of feed resources varied depending
   on parasite infection, PEG dosage and plant resource. We concluded that
   biological interactions influencing intake and selection of feed
   resources in goats are complex, rather than arising from a single factor
   such as parasite infection or secondary compounds such as CT. These
   findings support that goats' resource selection is a complex process
   aimed at nutritional optimization.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the quality of leucaena, gliricidia, and
   pornunca silages with different levels of old man saltbush inclusion in
   their composition. A completely randomized design was used with five
   levels of old man saltbush (Atriplex nummularia) inclusion (0, 25, 50,
   75, and 100\%) in leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), gliricidia
   (Gliricidia sepium), and pornunca (Manihot sp.) silages, with 5
   replications per treatment, totaling 75 experimental mini-silos
   maintained in a covered shed and free of opportunistic animals. Silos
   were opened after 100 days of ensilage, and the silage of the first 15
   cm of their ends was discarded. The remaining material was homogenized
   and sampled for determining the bromatological composition, in vitro
   digestibility, and fermentation profile. Old man saltbush inclusion
   levels in leucaena silages promoted a negative linear effect for dry
   matter, organic matter, crude protein, ethereal extract, pH, and
   ammoniacal nitrogen, while a positive linear effect was found for
   mineral matter, in vitro dry matter digestibility, total carbohydrates,
   non-fibrous carbohydrates, and propionic acid (P < 0.05). This silage
   also had a quadratic effect for lactic acid. Gliricidia silages showed a
   positive linear behavior for dry matter, mineral matter, and total
   carbohydrates, whereas organic matter, crude protein, and ethereal
   extract presented a negative linear behavior (P < 0.05). The contents of
   organic lactic, acetic, and propionic acids showed a quadratic effect
   for gliricidia silage as old man saltbush levels increased (P < 0.05).
   Regarding pornunca silage, dry matter, mineral matter, total
   carbohydrates, propionic acid, and butyric acid presented a linear
   increasing behavior, while organic matter, crude protein, ethereal
   extract, and non-fibrous carbohydrates presented a linear decreasing
   behavior (P < 0.05). Lactic acid and acetic acid concentrations for
   pornunca silage showed a quadratic behavior according to the increasing
   old man saltbush inclusion levels (P < 0.05). The highest contribution
   of old man saltbush in the silages promoted changes in the profile of
   organic acids, allowing an improvement in silage quality, favoring
   lactic fermentation rather than acetic fermentation. Butyric acid
   contents were low for all treatments and indicated the control of
   undesirable fermentation processes. These results indicate that old man
   saltbush inclusion in silage composition may contribute to
   bromatological composition and fermentation process of the studied
   silages.},

Title = {Comparison of the effects of mesquite pod and Leucaena extracts
   with phytoestrogens on the reproductive physiology and sexual behavior

Abstract = {Mesquite (Prosopis sp.) and Leucaena leucocephala are widespread
   legumes, widely used to feed several livestock species and as food
   source for human populations in several countries. Both mesquite and
   Leucaena contain several phytoestrogens which might have potential
   estrogenic effects. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the
   effects of mesquite pod and Leucaena extracts on several aspects of
   behavior and reproductive physiology of the male rat. The effects of the
   extracts were compared with those of estradiol (E-2) and of two
   isoflavones: daidzein (DAI) and genistein (GEN). The following
   treatments were given to groups of intact male rats: vehicle; mesquite
   pod extract; Leucaena extract; E-2; DAI; GEN. The results indicate that
   mesquite pod and Leucaena extracts disrupt male sexual behavior in a
   similar way to DAI and GEN, but less than E-2. The main disruptor of
   sexual behavior was E-2, however after 40 and 50 days of administration,
   both extracts and phytoestrogens disrupted sexual behavior in a similar
   way to E-2. The extracts also increased testicular germ cell apoptosis,
   decreased sperm quality, testicular weight, and testosterone levels, as
   phytoestrogens did, although these effects were less than those caused
   by estradiol. The number of seminiferous tubules with TUNEL-positive
   germ cells increased in extracts treated groups in a similar way to
   phytoestrogens groups, and E-2 caused the greatest effect. The number of
   TUNEL-positive cells per tubule increased only in Leucaena extract and
   E-2 groups, but not in mesquite- and phytoestrogens-treated groups.
   Spermatocytes and round spermatids were the TUNEL-positive cells
   observed in all experimental groups. This effect was associated with
   smaller testicular weights without atrophy in experimental groups
   compared with control. Testicular atrophy was only observed in
   estradiol-treated males. Testosterone decreased in males of all
   experimental groups, compared with control, this androgen was
   undetectable in E-2 treated males. These results suggest that mesquite
   pod and Leucaena extracts cause effects similar to those of
   phytoestrogens in male rat reproduction, these effects were lower than
   those caused by E-2. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of feeding alfalfa and pods of tree
   legumes on rumen pH and ammonia concentration as well as in sacco
   degradability of dry matter and fibre constituents of maize stover,
   alfalfa hay and their neutral detergent extracts. The feeds were
   incubated in the rumens of five South African Merino sheep fed
   individually in an incomplete (5 x 4) Latin square design using five
   diets. The diets comprised equal proportions of pasture hay and either
   alfalfa (Alfalfa diet) or pods of Acacia sieberiana (Sieberiana diet),
   Acacia nilotica (Nilotica diet) or Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena
   diet). The fifth diet was composed of pasture hay alone (Hay diet) and
   served as a negative control. Supplementation of hay with either legume
   pods or alfalfa significantly (p < 0.05) increased rumen ammonia
   concentration from 56 to a maximum of 86 mg l(-1). The pH of the rumen
   fluid ranged between 6.2 and 6.5 for all diets, but variations in pH
   were not significant. Diet did not affect (p > 0.05) the degradability
   constants lag time (LT), slowly degradable fraction (B), potential
   degradability (PD), effective degradability (ED) and rate of degradation
   (C) of dry matter (DM) but significantly (p < 0.01) affected ED of the
   fibre constituents of the incubated feeds. The effective degradabilities
   of the incubated feeds differed (p < 0.001), with alfalfa and maize
   stover having average values of 555 and 318 g kg(-1) DM respectively.
   The rate of degradation of alfalfa was also higher (p < 0.01) than that
   of maize stover. Neutral detergent extraction improved ED of the cell
   wall constituents of maize stover but produced the opposite effect for
   alfalfa. The interactions between incubation feed and extract were
   significant (p < 0.01) for ED and C of neutral detergent fibre and
   hemicellulose. The observations show that pods from tree legumes are
   comparable to alfalfa in the provision of rumen ammonia but limit
   microbial activity in the degradability of fibre constituents. They also
   show that maize stover and alfalfa differ in their degradabilities and
   that the differences may be attributed to their cell wall chemistry. (C)

   patterns of bamboo and traditional species in agroforestry system in
   Ghana},
Journal = {CLEANER MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding leaf litter decomposition dynamics is imperative owing to
   nutrient release rates and synchronization. The overarching aim is to
   sustainably manage agroforestry systems and ensure environmental
   integrity. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the decomposition
   and nutrient release of leaves of different bamboo species
   (Oxytenanthera abyssinica, Bambusa balcooa, Bambusa vulgaris), rarely
   used woody perennials in agroforestry system in Ghana, and compared with
   commonly used agroforestry species; Albizia lebbeck, Senna siamea,
   Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Eucalyptus grandis.
   Litterbag technique was used and freshly fallen leaves of the species
   (equivalent to 100 g on a dry weight basis) were collected and placed
   into 30 cm x 45 cm nylon litterbags with a 2-mm mesh size. The weight of
   the samples in the litterbags was based on local plant litter
   application rates (5 t dry matter ha1) for maize production in the study
   location. There was a total of 216 litterbags (27 per species) for the
   study. Eight transects spaced at 1.0 m apart were laid in a randomized
   complete block design and twenty-seven litter bags spaced 0.5 m apart
   were placed on each transect. The litterbags were buried at 2 cm depth
   and three samples of each species were retrieved and weighed for 210
   days to determine weight loss and nutrient release. Compared with
   Oxytenanthera abyssinica (8 weeks) and Senna siamea (6 weeks) half-life,
   rate of decomposition was analogous and higher than the other species.
   Further, Bambusa balcooa and the other non-bamboo species showed similar
   rate of decomposition. However, Bambusa vulgaris had marginally slower
   rate of decomposition compared to the traditional species. The highest
   rate of N, P, K and Ca release was recorded for Albizia lebbeck.
   Nonetheless, rates of P, Ca and Mg release were comparable to the other
   non-bamboo species. Eucalyptus grandis and Bambusa vulgaris also showed
   dominance in initial nitrogen and lignin concentrations and release.
   Therefore, with the observed substantial and comparable litter quality
   and decomposition rate among the species, it may be imperative to
   consider using the bamboo species for soil amendment and green manure in
   agroforestry system.},

   Leucaena F-1 hybrids in comparison with species-level selections in two
   distinctly different environments. A total of 19 Leucaena spp. and
   hybrid selections were tested for 2 yr at the Waimanalo and Mealani
   Research Stations in Hawaii. Thirteen species and hybrid selections were
   replicated three times and included species selections from L. pallida
   Britton \& Rose; L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit; L. diversifolia
   (Schlechtend.) Benth. (2n = 4x); and L. trichandra (Zucc.) Urban {[}syn.
   L. diversifolia (Schechtend.) Benth. subsp. trichandra (Urban) F.J. Pan]
   (2n = 2x). Additionally, five selections were interspecific F-1 hybrids
   and two were advanced-generation interspecific hybrids. Six other
   selections were augmented in the trials. Over 2 yr, L. pallida x L.
   leucocephala F-1 hybrids (K748 x K636 and K748 x K584) had the highest
   DM yield at both locations. At Waimanalo, K748 x K636 produced 53.4 Mg
   ha(-1) total DM biomass of which 24.6 Mg ha(-1) was forage, while at
   Mealani, K748 x K636 produced 29.4 Mg ha(-1) total DM biomass and 9.6 Mg
   ha(-1) forage. These yields were twice those of L. leucocephala at
   Waimanalo and eight times greater at Mealani. Leucaena leucocephala was
   the most susceptible to psyllid damage (P < 0.001), while the most
   resistant was L. trichandra (2n = 2x). Leucaena pallida hybrids had
   intermediate levels of psyllid resistance. Psyllid damage was negatively
   correlated with forage DM once at Waimanalo (r = -0.37, P < 0.05, n =
   42). Forage phenolic concentration averaged 110 mg g(-1) for all
   treatments at both locations and was correlated once to psyllid damage
   (r = 0.32, P < 0.05, n = 42) at Waimanalo. Superior yield, psyllid
   resistance and cold tolerance of L. pallida x L. leucocephala hybrids
   was observed at low and high elevation sites.},

   average body weight of 16.3 kg were allocated into three dietary
   treatments (T1, T2, and T3) with five animals in each group. Animals
   were offered dry mixed grass, berseem hay and concentrate mixture to
   meet their nutrient requirements. In concentrate mixture of T1,
   (Control) MSC was used as protein source, while in T2 and T3 groups, 25
   and 50\% of MSC was replaced by leucaena leucocephala seeds. On
   completion of three months (90 days) of feeding, a digestion
   cum-metabolism trial was conducted to determine DMI, nutrient
   utilization, and nitrogen balance. Changes in body weight were recorded
   at 15 day internals and eating patterns were recorded for 3 consecutive
   days at the end of the feeding trial. MSC had higher CP contents than
   leucaena seeds (27.0\%). Mimosine contents in leucaena seeds were 1.1
   compared to 0.2 and 0.4\% in concentrate mixture of T2 and T3 group,
   respectively. Dry matter intake varied non-significantly (79.3+/-1.2 to
   83.4+/-1.3 g/kg w(0.75)) across the dietary treatments. Digestibility of
   DM and cell wall polysaccharides (NDF, ADF. Cellulose and hemicellulose)
   were comparable, however CP digestibility was relatively lower in
   leucaena luecocephala seeds based groups (T2 45.5+/-1.7 and T3
   46.7+/-3.5) compared to MSC supplemented group (T1 47.7+/-0.9\%). The
   growth rate of lambs was non-significantly higher in T1 (79.2+/-5.4)
   compared to T2 (73.8+/-8.8) and T3 (73.9+/-7.0), respectively. The
   animals were in positive nitrogen balance and N-balance varied from 1.8
   to 2.9 g/d across treatment groups. The eating rate (\% of total
   offered) of concentrate up-to 15 min was relatively higher in T1 (82.4)
   than T2 (74.2) and T3 (77.8\%). However no effect of leucaena seeds was
   recorded on total DMI of animals. The results of the study revealed that
   the inclusion of up to 50\% leucaena seeds, as protein source in
   concentrate mixture of lambs had no adverse effect on DMI, nutrient
   utilization, eating patterns, nitrogen balance and growth performance of
   lambs.},

Abstract = {Livestock, especially ruminant, production is an important component of
   farming systems in upland areas of the Philippines. Moreover, since
   upland agriculture is becoming unsustainable because of soil erosion and
   productivity of crops is limited by poor soils, livestock production is
   a particularly valuable source of income to complement crop production.
   Farmers rely heavily on livestock to provide a source of savings, cash
   income, draft power and nutritious food. Nevertheless, scarcity and poor
   quality of feed are major constraints to improved livestock productivity
   in upland areas. Introduction of planted forages in these systems has
   the potential to increase substantially the quality and quantity of
   available forages, thus providing fodder to supplement low-quality
   naturally occurring forages and crop residues; concurrently, forage
   plants promote sustainability by improving soil quality and reducing
   soil erosion.
   Adoption of forages by smallholder farmers in the rainfed upland areas
   of the Philippines is conditioned by the dual-purpose role of forage
   plants. A number of forage species have been used as contour hedgerow
   species for the reduction of soil erosion. These include Gliricidia
   sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Setaria spp., napier grass (Pennisetum
   purpureum) and vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides). These species were
   chosen as hedgerow species because of their value as fodder for
   livestock, in addition to their roles in reducing soil erosion,
   controlling weed growth, and improving and stabilising fallow areas.
   A number of constraints affect the widespread adoption of forages for
   use as hedgerow species by smallholder farmers in the Philippine
   uplands. These factors include: the limited availability of seed; high
   mortality amongst the forage species planted; a lack of collective
   action; and the high initial cost of investment. Insufficient attention
   has been given to policy and socio-economic factors affecting adoption
   of forages. For example, the effects of socio-economic factors such as
   human capital (education, age), income and access to institutions (e.g.
   credit and extension) have not been studied in association with the
   adoption of forage species. Therefore, policy and technology options to
   address these issues are warranted.
   This paper uses an econometric approach (i.e. probit) to identify the
   factors affecting adoption of forages by smallholder fanners in the
   upland areas of the Philippines, using data from a survey conducted in
   1996 by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The survey
   examined farmers who had adopted contour hedgerow technology at 2 upland
   sites, Cebu, Visayas and Claveria, Mindanao, the Philippines.},

Title = {ESTIMATION OF THE PROPORTION OF C-3 AND C-4 PLANT SPECIES IN THE DIET OF
   ANIMALS FROM THE RATIO OF NATURAL C-12 AND C-13 ISOTOPES IN THE FECES},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE},
Year = {1979},
Volume = {92},
Number = {FEB},
Pages = {91-100},
Abstract = {The relation between the ratio of the natural 12C and 13C isotopes of C
   in the feed and resultant feces of animals was studied to develop a
   technique for estimating the proportion of C3 species (tropical legumes)
   and C4 species (tropical grasses) selected by grazing animals. The
   .delta.13C values of feces from rabbits, sheep, goats and cattle were
   lower (more negative) than those of the corresponding feeds by from
   0.4-2.0. This was possibly due to contamination in the gut by tissues or
   fluids with lower .delta.13C values. When C4 and C3 feeds were
   alternated, cattle took about a week to fully achieve the new level
   (.delta.13C of -28.7 on the C3 feed and -13.1 on the C4 feed) in the
   feces. This time lag is associated with the time taken for the feed to
   move through the digestive tract. When mixed C3 and C4 feeds were fed to
   rabbits, sheep, goats and cattle there was a negative linear relation
   between percentage legume (C3) in the feed and the .delta.13C of the
   feces (P < 0.01). A decrease in 1 unit in the .delta.13C value was
   associated with an increase of 7.0-8.5\% legume in the diet. Estimation
   of the percentage legume in the feed from the .delta.13C value of the
   feces and of the C3 and C4 components of the diet, resulted in a
   consistent over estimation of the legume component because the feces had
   lower values than the corresponding feeds. This bias was removed if the
   prediction was based on the .delta.13C of the feeds minus 1 unit. The
   legume percentage in the diets of the sheep, goats and cattle could then
   be estimated with a precision of about .+-. 5\%. Differences in
   digestibility between the C3 and C4 components greatly bias the
   estimations. This bias in the diets fed to rabbits was effectively
   removed by using in vitro organic matter digestibility values of the 2
   components to correct for the differences. Legume percentage in the diet
   could then be estimated with a RSD {[}relative standard deviation] of
   .+-. 3\%. Advantages and disadvantages compared with alternative methods
   of estimating the diet of grazing animals were discussed. {[}Grasses and
   legumes in the study included the following: Stylosanthes humilis, Vigna
   sinensis, S. hamata cv. Verano, Macroptilium atropurpureum cv. Siratro,

Abstract = {The data from 149 Siboney de Cuba upgraded heifers of 128.9 +/- 5.01 kg
   of I iveweight (LW) with 9.2 +/- 0.4 Months of age were used, as well as
   those from 30 yearlings-heifers of 12 months of age and 227.8 +/- 7.01
   kg of LW, to study the growth and reproduction in systems of management
   and feeding with grasses and legumes, in correspondence with the growth
   stage. The heifers and yearling-heifers were spread in two treatments:
   A) grazing on a mixture of Pangola grass (Digharia decumbens) and stylo
   (Stylosanthes guianensis), and B) grazing of Pangola grass without
   association for calves; A) mixture of tree legumes (Leucaena
   leucocephala cv. Peru) with Guinea grass Likoni (Panicum maximum) and B)
   Guinea grass Likoni for yearlings-heifers. The calves were grazing in 12
   paddocks and the yearlings-heifers, in six. The grazing time was in the
   afternoon and at night (4:00 p.m. to 10:00 a.m., with 1.3 LAU/ha, in
   both groups and categories). The pasture availability, was determined
   both in rainy and dry conditions. The animals were weighed every 30 d.
   Blood and soil samples were collected for the analysis. The data were
   analyzed through linear model. In calves, the grass associated had
   values of crude protein (CP) of 9.75\% and the non-associated grass, of
   7.03\%. The increment in LW of the calves was different (P < 0.001) and
   favored that grazing in the association. In yearlings-heifers, the
   association reached yield of 0.478 t of DM/rotation, and during the
   study there was daily increase of weight of 513.8 +/- 22.4. The blood
   metabolites were kept within the physiological ranges established for
   the species and category. The content of nitrogen in the grass without
   association was of 5.1\% of CP (SD +/- 0.021), whereas in the associated
   grass it was of 7.37 \% (SD +/- 0.110). The age of incorporation to
   reproduction was of 21.3 months, the interval
   incorporation-insemination, of 18.5 d, and the gestation, of 22 months.
   The results show the potentials of legumes and their contribution to the
   system under study to attain a quality heifer, production, especially
   when used according to the physiological growth stage.},

Abstract = {The nutritive value of leaf materials from five each of nitrogen (NFT),
   namely, Acacia nilotica, Albizia lebbeck, Butea monosperma, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Pongamia pinnata and non-nitrogen fixing multipurpose tree
   (non-NFT) species, namely, Anogeissus pendula, Azadirachta indica, Ficus
   bengalensis, Terminalia arjuna and Syzgium cumini grown at National
   Research Centre for Agroforestry, were evaluated by chemical and in
   sacco methods. Mean organic matter (OM) concentration (g kg(-1) dry
   matter) was comparable between NFT (902+/-5.3) and non-NFT (916+/-6.5).
   However, significantly (P<0.05) higher mean crude protein (CP) contents
   (g kg-L DM) were recorded in NFT (174 +/- 10.7) than non-NFT (96 +/-
   1.5) with maximum in L. leucocephala (228) and minimum in F. bengalensis
   (88), respectively. Mean neutral detergent fibre (NDF) contents were
   relatively lower in NFT than in non-NFT. Significantly (P < 0.05) higher
   contents of NDF, acid detergent fibre (ADF) and lignin (g kg(-1) DM)
   were observed in F. bengalensis (597, 458 and 222) and S. cumini (566,
   483 and 279) than in any of the other trees. Total phenolics (TP)
   concentration was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in NFT except for A.
   nilotica, but higher (P < 0.05) in non-NFT except in F. bengalensis.
   Mean condensed tannins (CT) concentration differed significantly (P <
   0.05) between NFT and non-NFT and ranged from 17 to 31 and 14 to 94 g
   kg(-1) DM, respectively. In sacco degradability of DM differed
   significantly (P < 0.05) amongst the MPTs and ranged from 504 to 809 for
   NFT and 513 to 881 g kg(-1) DM for non-NFT, respectively. Mean CP
   degradability (g k(-1) DM) was similar for (P < 0.05) NFT (659 +/- 24.1)
   and non-NFT (661 +/- 62.5). Cell wall contents degradability was
   relatively higher in non-NFT than NFT. However, a poor correlation was
   observed between anti-nutritional characters and in sacco degradability,
   whereas strong negative correlations were recorded between DM
   degradability and NDF, ADF and cellulose contents. The NFT contained
   high CP and low cell wall contents and anti-nutritional characters,
   however the in sacco degradability of nutrients was less for non-NFT,
   Nutritive value of the toes indicated that all the species could
   potentially be used as protein banks to supplement grass or crop
   residues in dry seasons. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {In vitro techniques were evaluated to determine the nutritive value of a
   selection of tanniniferous tree and shrub legumes (Calliandra
   calothyrsus, Leucaena leucocephala L. diversifolia and L. pallida)
   compared with lucerne (Medicago sativa). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was
   also added to some in vitro fermentations (10 mg PEG/50 mg plant
   substrate) to assess the effects of tannins on digestion of dry matter
   (DM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and nitrogen (N),
   Total tannin content was poorly correlated with digestibility of dry
   matter and nitrogen. Apparent digestibility of dry matter and N were
   significantly different between plants and ranked in the following ol
   der: lucerne > L. leucocephala > L. diversifolia > L. pallida > C,
   calothyrsus. Ammonia was not produced (net accumulation) during 72 h
   fermentation of C. calothyrsus, L, diversifolia and L. pallida although
   apparent nitrogen digestion in these plants ranged from 36.9 to 34.3\%.
   Acid-pepsin digestion resulted in a further 17-22\% of dry matter
   digestion in the shrub legumes compared with 8\% in lucerne following 72
   h fermentation. The amount of acid-pepsin digestible N available was
   lowest for lucerne (8.4\%) and highest for L. pallida (38.9\%) with the
   other legumes ranging from 26.5 to 36.8\%.
   The PEG addition caused a significant increase in rate and extent of DM
   and NDF digestibility and ammonia production for all the tannin
   containing shrub legumes but not for lucerne. However, DM loss and
   fermentability of these plants appeared to be poorly correlated because
   PEG addition resulted in an increase in volatile fatty acid production
   ranging from 3.7 to 202\% compared with an increase in apparent DM
   digestibility of 9.1-30\%.
   It is concluded that in vitro evaluation of apparent DM and N
   digestibility of tannin containing plants provides a poor indication of
   true digestion (fermentability) and thus measurements offermentation
   end-products (ammonia and short and branched chain fatty acids) should
   also be undertaken to evaluate nutritive value. Also, addition of PEG to
   in vitro fermentations can be used to determine the effect of tannins on
   N digestibility. Based on the in vitro methods of rumen fermentation
   used in this study, nutritive value of the tanniniferous forages is
   ranked as follows: L. leucocephala > L. diversifolia and L. pallida > C.

Abstract = {The silvopastoral system (SPS) has been suggested to ensure
   sustainability in animal production systems in tropical ecosystems. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate pasture characteristics, herbage
   intake, grazing activity and milk yield of Holstein x Zebu cows managed
   in two grazing systems (treatments): SPS dominated by a graminaceous
   forage (Brachiaria decumbens) intercropped with different leguminous
   herbaceous forages (Stylosanthes spp., Pueraria phaseoloides and
   Calopogonium mucunoides) and legume trees (Acacia mangium, Gliricidia
   sepium and Leucaena leucocephala), and open pasture (OP) of B. decumbens
   intercropped only with Stylosanthes spp. Pastures were managed according
   to the rules for organic cattle production. The study was carried out by
   following a switch back format with 12 cows, 6 for each treatment, over
   3 experimental years. Herbage mass was similar (P > 0.05) for both
   treatments, supporting an average stocking rate of 1.23 AU/ha. Daily dry
   matter intake did not vary (P > 0.05) between treatments (average of
   11.3 +/- 1.02 kg/cow per day, corresponding to 2.23 +/- 0.2\% BW). Milk
   yield was higher (P < 0.05; 10.4 +/- 0.06 kg/cow per day) in the SPS
   than in the OP (9.5 +/- 0.06 kg/cow per day) during the 1st year, but
   did not significantly differ (P > 0.05) in subsequent years. The highest
   (P < 0.05) values for herbage mass and milk yield were observed during
   the 3rd year. In the SPS, with moderate shade (19\% shade relative to a
   full-sun condition), the grass CP was higher (P < 0.05) than in the OP,
   although the NDF content and digestibility coefficient were not
   modified. The animals spent more time (P < 0.05) idling in the SPS than
   in OP. The higher legume proportion in the SPS was associated with the
   higher CP level in B. decumbens relative to the OP, which could explain
   the better (P < 0.05) performance of the cows in silvopastoral areas
   during the 1st year. However, during the 2nd and 3rd years, similarities
   in the legume percentages of both systems resulted in similar (P > 0.05)
   milk yields. Low persistence of Stylosanthes guianensis was observed
   over the experimental period, indicating that the persistence of forage
   legumes under grazing could be improved using adapted cultivars that
   have higher annual seed production. The SPS and a diversified botanical
   composition of the pasture using legume species mixed with grasses are
   recommended for organic milk production.},

Abstract = {Four silage diets were prepared from tropical grass and legume mixtures
   and fed to intestinally fistulated sheep to determine the sites and
   extent of digestion of the different silage components in the digestive
   tract. Pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens) was ensiled either alone or
   with the addition, 33\% (w/w), of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala cv.
   Cunningham), gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) or cowpea (Vigna unguiculata
   cv. Caloona). All forages were grown at the University of Queensland
   farm in 1985. All silages were well preserved as indicated by low pH (<
   4.1), ammonia N (< 9\% total N), acetic acid (< 13 g/kg dry matter (DM))
   and ethanol (< 19 g/kg DM) contents, and high DM (> 290 g/kg) and lactic
   acid (> 41 g/kg DM) contents. The inclusion of leucaena and gliricidia
   significantly increased the total N content of the silages. The addition
   of legumes at ensiling significantly increased rumen ammonia N (pangola
   59 mg N/1, legume diets 110-115 mg N/1) and the proportion of propionic
   acid in rumen fluid. Sheep given pangola + leucaena silages had
   significantly higher DM intakes (66.3 g/kg W0.75 per day) than sheep
   given pangola and pangola + cowpea silages (52.4 and 53.2 g/kg W0.75 per
   day respectively). The inclusion of gliricidia significantly depressed
   silage intake (43.1 g/kg W0.75 per day). There were no significant
   effects of diet on DM (551-609 g/kg) and organic matter (550-612 g/kg)
   digestibility. Sheep given pangola + leucaena silages had higher N
   intakes, N balances, rates and efficiencies of microbial N synthesis and
   total non-ammonia N (NAN) flows to the small intestine than did sheep
   given the other silages. Apparent degradabilities of silage N in the
   rumen were similar for all diets (0.491-0.559 g N/kg N intake), but
   sheep given pangola + leucaena silages had lower true (corrected for
   endogenous N) N degradabilities (0.648 g N/kg N intake) than those given
   the other diets (0.751-0.775 g N/kg N intake). The values obtained in
   this experiment were compared with those reported for temperate grass
   silages, and it was concluded that whilst the digestibility of tropical
   grass/legume silages was low, intakes and rumen fermentation
   characteristics were similar to those found for temperate grass silages.},

Abstract = {Agriculture has been most successful in the temperate and subtropical
   semi-humid climatic zones, where seasons of adequate rainfall alternate
   with dry seasons, and the soils are deep and rich. It was difficult to
   create a productive agriculture in large regions of the humid tropics,
   where rain falls throughout the year, or in the arid and semi-arid
   lands, where rains are highly erratic. Plants {[}36] are described that
   now grow in limited regions but could be transplanted to wide areas.
   Some of these were already domesticated, i.e., modified genetically for
   man''s own purposes. Others are still wild, although they may be more or
   less haphazardly cultivated. Examples of domesticated plants are the
   winged bean {[}Psophocarpus tetragonolobus], which is now cultivated in
   Papua, New Guinea and some areas of Southeast Asia but could become a
   major source of protein, edible oil, carbohydrate, and livestock feed
   throughout the wet tropics in both lowland and mountain environments;
   cocoyam {[}Xanthosoma sasittifolium], a high-yielding tuber with an
   adequate ratio of protein to carbohydrate, and ramie, which produces a
   fiber several times as strong as cotton or silk and much more durable
   than cotton. Much research is necessary to make these plants more useful
   to man: for the winged bean, to develop strong stemmed dwarf varieties
   that will not require staking and in which most of the beans mature and
   can be harvested at about the same time; for the cocoyam, to produce
   virus-free tubers; and ramie, development of more efficient and
   economical methods of removing the cover of tenacious inert gum from the
   fibers. Fast growing trees that can provide fuel for cooking and fodder
   for domestic animals are as essential as food crops in the tropical
   regions. In the semi-humid lowland tropics, the Mexican and Central
   American tree, Leucaena leucocephala, appears most suitable. Dense
   plantations of the recently discovered Salvador variety of Leucaena
   yield a larger quantity of wood than any known tree, from 12 to > 50
   tons/ha. Six bags of dried Leucaena leaves contain the same quantity of
   N as 1 bag of ammonium sulfate. Hence, in areas where land can be
   substituted for other resources Leucaena is economically useful as a
   substitute for chemical fertilizer. In areas of shifting cultivation
   where fallow periods of 10 or 12 yr were traditionally used, the fallow
   period can be reduced to .apprx. 2 yr by reseeding with Leucaena after
   crop plants have depleted the soil.},

Abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) has an important effect on the physicochemical
   status of highly weathered soils in the tropics. This work was conducted
   to determine the contribution of different SOM fractions to the cation
   exchange capacity (CEC) of a tropical soil and to study the effect of
   organic matter inputs of different biochemical composition on the CEC of
   SOM. Soil samples were collected from a 20-year-old arboretum
   established on a Ferric Lixisol, under seven multipurpose tree species:
   Afzelia africana, Dactyladenia barteri, Gliricidia sepium, Gmelina
   arborea, Leucaena leucocephala, Pterocarpus santalinoides, and Treculia
   africana. Fractions were obtained by wet sieving and sedimentation after
   ultrasonic dispersion. Relationships between CEC and pH were determined
   using the silver thiourea-method and were described by linear
   regression. The CEC of the fractions smaller than 0.053 mm was inversely
   related to their particle size: clay (<0.002 mm) > fine silt (0.002-0.02
   mm) > coarse silt (0.02-0.053 mm), except for the soils under T
   africana, D. barteri, and L. leucocephala, where the CEC of the fine
   silt fraction was highest or comparable to the CEC of the clay fraction.
   The clay and fine silt fractions were responsible for 76-90\% of the
   soil CEC at pH 5.8. The contribution of the fine silt fraction to the
   CEC at pH 5.8 ranged from 35 to 50\%, which stressed the importance of
   the fine silt fraction for the physicochemical properties of the soil.
   Differences in CEC between treatments for the whole soil and the
   fractions could be explained by the differences in carbon content.
   Except for the intercept for the clay fraction, SOM had a significant (P
   < 0.001) contribution to both the intercepts (=estimated CEC at pH 0)
   and slopes (=pH-dependent charge) of the CEC-pH relationships for the
   whole soil and the fractions. The CEC of SOM at pH 5.8 varied between
   283 cmol(c) kg(-1) C for particulate organic matter, and 563 cmol(c)
   kg(-1) C for the fine silt fraction. The biochemical composition of the
   organic inputs did not have an important effect on the CEC of SOM. In
   total, SOM was responsible for 75-85\% of the CEC of these soils. (C)

Title = {Comparison of rumen fluid from South African game species and from sheep
   to digest tanniniferous browse},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {453-460},
Abstract = {The hypothesis that South African game animals that use browse
   containing condensed tannins (CT) could have rumen microbial populations
   better able to ferment tanniniferous forages was explored. Rumen fluid
   (RF) from a range of browsing ruminants was used to ferment
   tanniniferous forages in vitro and the results were compared with the
   values obtained with rumen fluid from sheep. Leaves of the shrub legumes
   Leucaena leucocephala, L. pallida, L. trichandra, Calliandra
   calothyrsus, Gliricidia sepium, and Acacia boliviana were used as
   substrates. In vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD) and nitrogen
   (IVND) was measured in the presence or absence of polyethylene glycol
   (PEG) 4000 to assess the adverse effects of the CT in the feeds. Rumen
   fluid from giraffe, greater kudu, eland, duiker, impala, nyala, goat,
   and gnu was compared with that from sheep. Ability to metabolise or
   block the adverse effects of CT was expected to result in only a small
   or no response to PEG in terms of IVDMD and IVND with rumen fluid from
   browsers, and therefore to result in a significant animal x feed and
   animal x PEG interaction.
   There were no significant (P > 0.05) animal x feed interactions. For
   every animal species there was a response to PEG in terms of IVND, and
   this response was linearly related to the CT in the feed as measured by
   PEG binding using C-14-labelled PEG.
   Rumen fluid from browsers had a lower pH (5.78 +/- 0.060 v. 6.68 +/-
   0.052) and a higher dry matter content (1473 +/- 102 mg v. 415 +/- 4.3
   mg/100 mL RF) than that of grazers (sheep and gnu). However, when
   measured at 2 pH levels (6.7 and 5.8), IVDMD and IVND of the feeds were
   not improved at the lower pH with rumen fluid from the browsers. Rather,
   digestibility was depressed at the lower pH with rumen fluid from all
   animal species.
   We conclude from these in vitro studies that rumen microbial populations
   from browsers are not able to ferment tanniniferous forages better than
   rumen microbial populations from grazers. It seems likely that these
   browsers do not have rumen bacteria capable of degrading the CT in these
   shrub legumes. Production on such tanniniferous feeds may well depend on
   tannin binding with proline-rich saliva rather than on metabolism of or
   tolerance to CT by rumen bacteria.},

Abstract = {In the first two of four experiments, sheep were fed, ad libitum,
   sorghum stover supplemented with graded levels of foliage of the shrub
   leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) or mulga (Acacia aneura), which
   provided between 0 and 0.34 or between 0 and 0.43 of the dietary dry
   matter (DM) respectively. A second treatment (with or without urea) was
   superimposed in a factorial design. The effect of treatments on
   liveweight (LW) was explainable by their effects on voluntary intake of
   apparently digestible organic matter (DOMI). DOMI was increased by
   mulga, largely due to an increase in the total voluntary intake of
   organic matter (OM). Leucaena increased DOMI by increasing the ration OM
   digestibility and, at low levels of inclusion, intake of the basal diet.
   Roughage intake was greatest when leucaena provided 0.15-0.20 of the
   dietary DM. Leucaena increased rumen ammonia, and whenever roughage
   intake was increased by urea, leucaena also increased it.
   In the third experiment, when diets were made isonitrogenous with urea,
   roughage intake was slightly greater when leucaena, rather than its ash
   or a mineral mixture, was supplemented. Total OM intake and DOMI were
   greatest when leucaena was fed.
   In the final experiment, sheep were fed one of ten treatments: three
   basal diets (two of sorghum stover and the third of native pasture hay)
   each supplemented with legumes (leucaena to the hay and one stover diet
   and cowpea straw to the second stover diet), ash of the respective
   legume and formaldehyde-treated casein. The tenth treatment was sorghum
   stover plus urea. For sorghum stover diets with leucaena-based or cowpea
   straw-based supplements, DOMI responded linearly to the non-urea
   nitrogen concentration of the diet. On the other hand, for native hay
   with leucaena-based supplements, the response of DOMI to non-urea N was
   negligible. It was noted that the native hay (predominantly Flinders
   grass, Iseilema vaginiflorum), contained lower concentrations of
   polyphenols than sorghum stover.
   It was concluded that browse foliage can increase the voluntary DOMI of
   sheep consuming low quality roughages by providing nitrogen and
   sometimes minerals and OM of greater digestibility. The
   slowly-degradable proteins in leucaena, cowpea straw or
   formaldehyde-treated casein are more effective with polyphenol-rich
   sorghum stover than with native hay of otherwise similar composition.},

Abstract = {Inadequate soil management practices adopted in the Brazilian semi-arid
   region contribute to erosive processes. Agroforestry systems (AFs) have
   been considered an alternative to reduce water erosion. This study aimed
   to evaluate the impact of two alternatives AFs, a traditional and an
   intensive cropping system on the losses of sediments, water, organic
   carbon and nutrients caused by water erosion in comparison to the
   natural vegetation (caatinga) in a semi-arid region of northeastern
   Brazil. The agroecosystems studied were: agrosilvopasture (AGP) which
   consisted of an alley cropping system, cultivated with Leucaena
   leucocephala and maize, within an area composed by 22\% of native trees
   (200 native trees per hectare) which was grazed during the dry season;
   silvopasture (SILV) that was composed by 38\% of native trees (260 trees
   per hectare) with a stocking rate of 20 ewes during whole year;
   traditional agrosilvopasture (TRAG) being managed as following: total
   deforestation, burning of the residues, cropped with maize for 2 years
   (1998 and 1999) and fallow during 8-10 years; and intensive cropping
   (IC) system which was deforested and burned in 1997 followed by
   cultivation of maize from 1998 to 2002, and thereafter by a fallow
   period of 8-10 years similar to TRAG. Two areas of native forest (NF1,
   NF2) known as `caatinga', used as grassland during the dry season and as
   a source of wood, were selected and used as reference of steady state in
   the comparative study in relation to the cultivated sites. Sediment and
   water losses as a result of erosion were collected during two rainy
   seasons, i.e. 2003 and 2004, and nutrients and organic carbon contents
   were determined. Soil samples were collected and organic carbon, pH in
   water, pH in KCl, water dispersible clay (WDC) and hydraulic
   conductivity (K(0)) were measured. In 2003, sediment and water losses
   did not differ significantly among all treatments. However, in 2004,
   TRAG (0.70 Mg ha(-1)) and NF1 (1.37 Mg ha(-1)) showed the highest
   sediment losses, whereas TRAG and IC presented the highest water losses.
   On average, nutrients losses in cropped areas were lower than in natural
   vegetation (NF1, NF2). The alternative AFs (AGP, SILV) were efficient to
   reduce water erosion effects when compared to the most common
   agricultural practices adopted in the region, being highly recommended
   as sustainable technical alternatives for food production in the region.},

Abstract = {In vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the suitability of
   several mixtures of high tanniniferous non legumes with low
   tanniniferous legumes on in vitro gas production (IVGP), dry matter
   degradation, Ammonia-N, methane production and microbial population.
   Eight treatments were examined in a randomized complete block design
   using four non-legumes and two legumes (Carallia integerrimaxLeucaena
   leucocephala (LL) (Trt 1), C. integerrimaxGliricidia sepium (GS) (Trt
   2), Aporosa lindeliyanaxLL (Trt 3), A. lindeliyanaxGS (Trt 4), Ceiba
   perntandraxLL (Trt 5), C. perntandraxGS (Trt 6), Artocarpus
   heterophyllusxLL (Trt 7), A. heterophyllusxGS (Trt 8). The condensed
   tannin (CT) content of non legumes ranged from 6.2\% (Carallia
   integerrima) to 4.9\% (Ceiba perntandra) while the CT of legumes were
   1.58\% (Leucaena leucocephala) and 0.78\% (Gliricidia sepium). Forage
   mixtures contained more than 14\% of crude protein (CP) while the CT
   content ranged from 2.8\% to 4.0\% respectively. Differences (p<0.05)
   were observed in in vitro gas production (IGVP) within treatments over a
   48 h period dominated by C. perntandraxG sepium (Trt 6). The net gas
   production (p<0.05) was also high with Trt6 followed by A.
   heterophyllusxL. leucocephala (Trt 7) and A. heterophyllusxG sepium (Trt
   8). Highest (p>0.05) NH3-N (ml/200 mg DM) production was observed with
   the A. heterophyllusxG sepium (Trt 8) mixture which may be attributed
   with it's highest CP content. The correlation between IVGP and CT was
   0.675 while IVGP and CP was 0.610. In vitro dry matter degradation
   (IVDMD) was highest in Trt 8 as well. Methane production ranged from
   2.57 to 4.79 (ml/200 mg DM) to be synonimous with IVGP. A higher
   bacteria population (p<0.05) was found in C. perntandraxG sepium (Trt 6)
   followed by Artocarpus heterophyllus+G sepium (Trt 8) and the same trend
   was observed with the protozoa population as well. The results show that
   supplementing high tannin non leguminous forages by incremental
   substitution of legume forage increased gas production parameters,
   NH3-N, IVDMD and microbial population in the fermentation liquid.
   Methane production was not significantly affected by the presence of CT
   or different levels of CP in forage mixtures. Among non legumes, Ceiba
   perntandra and Artocarpus heterophyllus performed better in mixture with
   L. leucocephala and G sepium.},

Abstract = {Thirty crossbred West African lambs were assigned randomly to three
   different feeding systems: T1: grass pasture grazing (Cenchrus ciliaris)
   +2 h/day of grazing leucaena; T2: grazing pasture +300 g of feed
   concentrate and T3: grazing only on grass pasture in order to determine
   the effect of feed supplementation on carcass characteristics,
   non-carcass components, retail cut percentages and quality of lambs
   carcasses. Full live weight and empty live weight were 22 and 30\%
   heavier (p < 0.05) for T1 and T2 with respect to T3. T2 differed from T1
   and T3 in hot carcass weight (2.1 and 3.6 kg more) and cold carcass
   weight (1.2 and 2.2 kg more), respectively. T2 had a higher dressing
   percentage (p < 0.05) than T1 and T3 (40.77 vs. 37.88 and 35.07),
   respectively. T1 and T2 were 24 and 29\% more in ribeye area than T3.
   The conformation was not very favorable in any of the treatments. The
   conformation of the leg in T1 and T2 was poor (slightly concave) and for
   T3 very poor (concave). T1 and T2 lambs had lighter feet (0.22
   percentage points) and heavier testicles (0.52 and 0.60 percentage
   points), with respect to T3, respectively. The livers in T2 weighed 14
   and 107 g more than in T1 and T3, respectively. T1 and T3, however, had
   a higher proportion of full intestines (6.32 and 2.64 percentage points,
   respectively) than T2. There were no differences between treatments (p >
   0.05) for the chop, leg and shoulder neck percentages but there was a
   difference (p < 0.05) in the loin percentage in TI and T2 with respect
   to T3 (4.69 and 4.57 vs. 3.93) respectively. T2 showed higher
   percentages of internal and fat deposits in kidneys than T1 and T3. T1
   and T3 had light while T2 had moderate external carcass fat. T1 and T2
   had slightly dark red muscle color while the muscle color for T3 was
   cherry red. It was concluded that the combination of feed concentrates
   and/or Leucaena leucocephala is an alternative in the production of
   well-finished lamb carcasses with good external fat, meat of better
   quality and appearance for the consumer and higher percentages in retail
   cuts. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Isolating α-Cellulose from Different Lignocellulosic Precursors for the
   Eco-Friendly Fiber Industry},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Alpha-cellulose, a unique, natural, and essential polymer for the fiber
   industry, was isolated in an ecofriendly manner using eleven novel
   systems comprising recycling, defibrillation, and delignification of
   prosenchyma cells (vessels and fibers) of ten lignocellulosic resources.
   Seven hardwood species were selected, namely Conocorpus erectus,
   Leucaena leucocephala, Simmondsia chinensis, Azadirachta indica, Moringa
   perigrina, Calotropis procera, and Ceiba pentandra. Moreover, three
   recycled cellulosic wastes were chosen due to their high levels of
   accumulation annually in the fibrous wastes of Saudi Arabia, namely
   recycled writing papers (RWPs), recycled newspapers (RNPs), and recycled
   cardboard (RC). Each of the parent samples and the resultant
   alpha-cellulose was characterized physically, chemically, and
   anatomically. The properties examined differed significantly among the
   ten resources studied, and their mean values lies within the cited
   ranges. Among the seven tree species, L. leucocephala was the best
   cellulosic precursor due to its higher fiber yield (55.46\%) and
   holocellulose content (70.82\%) with the lowest content of Klasson
   lignin (18.86\%). Moreover, RWP was the best alpha-cellulose precursor,
   exhibiting the highest holocellulose (87\%) and the lowest lignin (2\%)
   content. Despite the high content of ash and other additives accompanied
   with the three lignocellulosic wastes that were added upon fabrication
   to enhance their quality (10\%, 11\%, and 14.52\% for RWP, RNP, and RC,
   respectively), they can be considered as an inexhaustible treasure
   source for cellulose production due to the ease and efficiency of
   discarding their ash minerals using the novel CaCO3-elimination process
   along with the other innovative techniques. Besides its main role for
   adjusting the pH of the delignification process, citric acid serves as
   an effective and environmentally friendly additive enhancing lignin
   breakdown while preserving cellulose integrity. Comparing the thermal
   behavior of the ten cellulosic resources, C. procera and C. pentandra
   exhibited the highest moisture content and void volume as well as having
   the lowest specific gravity, crystallinity index, and holocellulose
   content and were found to yield the highest mass loss during their
   thermal degradation based on thermogravimetric and differential thermal
   analysis in an inert atmosphere. However, the other resources used were
   found to yield lower mass losses. The obtained results indicate that
   using the innovative procedures of recycling, defibrillation, and
   delignification did not alter or distort either the yield or structure
   of the isolated alpha-cellulose. This is a clear indicator of their high
   efficiency for isolating cellulose from lignocellulosic precursors.},

   Modify In Vitro Ruminal Fermentation, Methane and Gas Production without
   a Tight Correlation with the Microbiota},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Ruminants produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as a
   byproduct of microbial activity during ruminal fermentation. To lessen
   greenhouse gases emissions, it is necessary to evaluate methane-reducing
   feeding alternatives for ruminants, such as the use of tropical trees
   and shrubs. The secondary metabolites produced by these plants have been
   shown to reduce ruminal methane emissions. Here, we evaluated the effect
   of the foliage of eleven tropical trees and shrubs edible for cattle in
   ruminal fermentation, methane production and microbiota in an in vitro
   assay. The content of condensed tannins and saponins in the foliage was
   variable between the species of plants. We observed a reduction in
   methane production and changes in microbial populations depending on the
   species of tree or shrub. Additionally, condensed tannins reduced
   methane production. The inclusion of the foliage of tropical trees and
   shrubs in the diet of ruminants may be a step towards diminishing
   greenhouses gases emissions, and therefore reducing the contribution to
   global warming from cattle production. Ruminants, mainly cattle,
   contribute to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions as methane (CH4) is
   produced by ruminal fermentation. Hence, various anti-methanogenic feed
   strategies have been studied, including the use of plants with secondary
   metabolites. This study evaluated in vitro ruminal fermentation metrics,
   microbial composition by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and the CH4
   production of the foliage of several tropical trees and shrubs: Leucaena
   leucocephala, Moringa oleifera, Albizia lebbeck, Enterolobium
   cyclocarpum, Piscidia piscipula, Brosimum alicastrum, Lysiloma
   latisiliquum, Guazuma ulmifolia, Cnidoscolus aconitifolius, Gliricidia
   sepium and Bursera simaruba, using Cynodon plectostachyus grass as
   control. The results showed a wide variation in the chemical composition
   of the foliage, as well as in the ruminal microbiota. The crude protein
   (CP) content ranged from 11 to 25\%, whereas the content of condensed
   tannins (CT) and saponins (S) was from 0.02 to 7\%, and 3.2 to 6.6\%,
   respectively. The greatest dry matter degradability (DMD) after 72 h was
   69\% and the least 35\%, the latter coinciding with the least gas
   production (GP). A negative correlation was found between the CT and CH4
   production, also between protozoa and fungi with the SGMT group of
   archaea. We concluded that the foliage of some tropical trees and shrubs
   has a high nutritional value and the potential to decrease CH4
   production due to its CT content.},

Title = {Naturalized and invasive alien flora of Ghana},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},

Abstract = {The paper provides an inventory of the naturalized vascular flora of
   Ghana, based on newly gathered information from the literature and
   consultations with local experts. We adopted a rather conservative
   approach by including only species for which strong evidence exists that
   they are alien in Ghana. We recorded 291 species of naturalized alien
   plants; for 237 of them there is information on their distribution in
   the 10 administrative regions of Ghana. Twenty-five species (i.e. 8.6\%
   of the total number of naturalized species) are classified as invasive.
   There are 21 widely distributed species (7.2\% of the total naturalized
   flora) that occur in at least eight regions, and five of them are
   distributed all over the country: Azadirachta indica, Echinochloa
   colona, Leucaena leucocephala, Senna occidentalis and S. siamea. Of
   these five, the first three are classified as invasive. The naturalized
   flora of Ghana includes 71 families, with Leguminosae (66 species),
   Compositae (22) and Poaceae (18) most represented. The majority of
   species have their native range in South and North America, contributing
   161 and 127 species, respectively. Tropical Asia (98 species) and Africa
   (37 species) are less represented and only three species have their
   origin in Europe. The dominance of the Americas as a source region is
   even more pronounced for the subset of invasive species, with this
   continent accounting for 18 species out of 25 (72\%). Annual and
   biennial/perennial herbs, shrubs and trees are evenly represented in the
   naturalized alien species pool. Among invasive species,
   biennial/perennial herbs are markedly over-represented compared to their
   contribution to the naturalized flora as a whole (52\% vs 38\%). The
   same is true for aquatic species (12\% vs 2\%). Species that occur as
   naturalized in more than 40 regions in Africa are also more widely
   distributed within Ghana. The numbers of naturalized species in the
   administrative regions of Ghana varied from 34 in Upper West to 173 in
   Greater Accra. These numbers increased with human population density and
   decreased with distance from the sea, but this pattern was driven by the
   city of Accra region. The only predictor that remained significant after
   removing this outlier was the amount of precipitation in the dry period,
   which was positively associated with the regional richness of
   naturalized species. This study could serve as a stimulus for other
   countries in hitherto understudied tropical regions to work towards
   comprehensive inventories, for which basic data on the alien flora often
   is still incomplete.},

Title = {Reproductive capacities and development of a seed bruchid beetle,

   rearing of the parasitoid, Dinarmus basalis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},

Abstract = {The reproductive capacities and development of the seed beetle
   Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae),
   found in Togo, were determined under natural conditions in a Guinean
   zone for its use as a substitute host for the mass rearing of the
   parasitoid Dinarmus basalis Rond (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), a
   biological agent for the control of beetles that are pests of cowpea,
   Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walpers (Fabales: Fabaceae). Population dynamics
   at the field level; and survival, fecundity and offspring production by
   A. macrophthalmus under laboratory conditions were measured when fed on
   its natural plant-host Leucaena leucocephala (Lamark) deWit (Fabales:
   Fabaceae). The data resulting from the laboratory study were used to
   calculate the demographic parameters of A. macrophthalmus by
   establishing its fertility and life tables. Contrary to cultivated
   leguminous food plants, L. leucocephala is a perennial sub-spontaneous
   leguminous plant whose pods are available year round. Although A.
   macrophthalmus was present in nature throughout the year, its
   infestation rate of the pods fluctuated according to the phenology of
   the plant. The maximum infestation of L. leucocephala pods was observed
   between August and December. Four larval stages and one pupal stage of
   A. macrophthalmus were identified in the laboratory. The total mean
   development time varied on average 33.75 +/- 2.87 days on the mature
   pods and 33.39 +/- 2.02 days on seeds. The adult female lived from one
   to two weeks. During its life time, the female laid an average of 62.3
   +/- 19 and 43.1 +/- 13 eggs on the mature pods and seeds respectively
   and produced an average of 36.7 +/- 11.3 offspring on the mature pods
   and 21.8 +/- 8.4 offspring on seeds. On seeds, the net reproduction rate
   was 5.88 females per female and the intrinsic rate of population
   increase 0.051 per day. The generation time was 34.59 days and the
   doubling time 13.59 days. The demographic parameters of A.
   macrophthalmus in this study are close to those of Callobruchus
   maculatus F. (Bruchidae), the natural host of D. basalis in a previous
   study. A. macrophthalmus could therefore be used as substitute host for
   the mass rearing of D. basalis and subsequently its release in farmers'
   storage containers. The data presented in this study provide some
   baseline information regarding the reproductive capacities of A.
   macrophthalmus that may be useful for its promotion as a substitute host
   for mass rearing of D. basalis.},

Abstract = {Three drafts of Bos indicus cross steers (initially 178-216 kg) grazed
   Leucaena-grass pasture {[}Leucaena leucocephala subspecies glabrata cv.
   Cunningham with green panic (Panicummaximum cv. trichoglume)] from late
   winter through to autumn during three consecutive years in the Burnett
   region of south-east Queensland. Measured daily weight gain(DWG(Actual))
   of the steers was generally 0.7-1.1 kg/ day during the summer months.
   Estimated intakes of metabolisable energy and dry matter (DM) were
   calculated from feeding standards as the intakes required by the steers
   to grow at the DWG(Actual). Diet attributes were predicted from near
   infrared reflectance spectroscopy spectra of faeces (F. NIRS) using
   established calibration equations appropriate for northern Australian
   forages. Inclusion of some additional reference samples from cattle
   consuming Leucaena diets into F. NIRS calibrations based on grass and
   herbaceous legume-grass pastures improved prediction of the proportion
   of Leucaena in the diet. Mahalanobis distance values supported the
   hypothesis that the F. NIRS predictions of diet crude protein
   concentration and DM digestibility (DMD) were acceptable. F. NIRS
   indicated that the percentage of Leucaena in the diet varied widely
   (10-99\%). Diet crude protein concentration and DMD were usually high,
   averaging 12.4 and 62\%, respectively, and were related asymptotically
   to the percentage of Leucaena in the diet (R-2 = 0.48 and 0.33,
   respectively). F. NIRS calibrations for DWG were not satisfactory to
   predict this variable from an individual faecal sample since the s. e.
   of prediction were 0.33-0.40 kg/ day. Cumulative steer liveweight (LW)
   predicted from F. NIRS DWG calibrations, which had been previously
   developed with tropical grass and grass-herbaceous legume pastures,
   greatly overestimated the measured steer LW; therefore, these
   calibrations were not useful. Cumulative steer LW predicted from a
   modified F. NIRS DWG calibration, which included data from the present
   study, was strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.95) with steer LW but
   overestimated LW by 19-31 kg after 8 months. Additional reference data
   are needed to develop robust F. NIRS calibrations to encompass the
   diversity of Leucaena pastures of northern Australia. In conclusion, the
   experiment demonstrated that F. NIRS could improve understanding of diet
   quality and nutrient intake of cattle grazing Leucaena-grass pasture,
   and the relationships between nutrient supply and cattle growth.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the effect of feeding dried foliage (leaves
   and petioles) of Acacia saligna, Leucaena leucocephala or Moringa
   oleifera on the performance, digestibility, N utilisation, caecal
   fermentation and microbial profiles in New Zealand White (NZVV) rabbits.
   One hundred weaned male NZW rabbits weighing 819.2 +/- 16.6 g and aged
   35 +/- 1 d were randomly allocated into 4 groups of 25 rabbits each.
   Rabbits were fed on pelleted.diets containing 70\% concentrate mixture
   and 30\% Egyptian berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum) hay (Control diet) or
   one of the other 3 experimental diets, where 50\% of berseem hay was
   replaced with A. saligna (AS), L. leucocephala (LL) or M. oleifera (MO).
   Compared to Control diet, decreases in dry matter (DM; P=0.004), organic
   matter (P=0.028), crude protein (CP; P=0.001), neutral detergent fibre
   (P=0.033) and acid detergent fibre (P=0.011) digestibility were observed
   with the AS diet. However, DM and CP digestibility were increased by 3\%
   with the MO diet, and N utilisation was decreased (P<0.05) with AS.
   Rabbits fed AS and LL diets showed decreased (P=0.001) average daily
   gain by 39 and 7\%, respectively vs. Control. Feed conversion was
   similar in Control and MO rabbits, whereas rabbits fed AS diet ate up to
   45\% more feed (P=0.002) than Control rabbits to gain one kg of body
   weight. Caecal ammonia-N was increased (P=0.002) with LL, while acetic
   acid was decreased (P=0.001) with AS diet vs. other treatments. Caecal
   E. coli and Lactobacillus spp. bacteria counts were decreased with MO by
   about 44 and 51\%, respectively, vs. Control. In conclusion, under the
   study conditions, tree foliage from M. oleifera and L. leucocephala are
   suitable fibrous ingredients to be included up to 150 g/kg in the diets
   of growing rabbits, and can safely replace 50\% of berseem hay in diets
   of NZW rabbits without any adverse effect on their growth performance.
   Foliage from M. oleifera had a better potential as a feed for rabbits
   than that from L. leucocephala. Although foliage from A. saliga may be
   also used at 150 g/kg in the diets of growing rabbits, this level of
   inclusion may result in reduced feed digestibility and growth
   performance.},

Volume = {166},

Abstract = {The capacity of vegetation fallow to replenish carbon and nutrients in
   degraded soil is related largely to the nature of the fallow vegetation,
   particularly the chemical composition. Therefore, a study was conducted
   at Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria (humid tropics), to look into these
   relationships using, fallow species with varying chemical compositions.
   The treatments include three woody species, Senna siamea, Acacia
   leptocarpa and Leucaena leucocephala, planted in 1989, and the natural
   shrub Chromolaena odorata. A continuous cropping of maize/cassava was
   maintained as a control (no fallow). Composite surface soil (0-15 cm) at
   three distances from a tree hedgerow (0.5, 2.0, and 3.5 m) was sampled
   in 1996 for the determination of soil C and nutrient stocks. Maize and
   cassava were planted as a test crop of soil productivity after
   fallowing. Litterbags were placed to determine the N immobilization
   during the decomposition of fallow leaves. Soil. organic C (SOC) within
   0-15 cm ranged from 19,100 (continuous cropping) to 26,400 kg ha(-1)
   (Leucaena fallow), whereas total N ranged from 1820 (continuous
   cropping) to 3110 kg ha(-1) (Leucaena fallow). High polyphenols in
   fallow leaves favored SOC and N accumulation. The amount of potentially
   mineralizable N was increased from 41 kg ha(-1) in continuous cropping
   to 159 under Leucaena fallow and 176 under der Acacia fallow. The
   percentage increase in mineralizable N stock under fallow was, on
   average, 5.5 times greater than that in total N, implying that fallow
   causes change in soil organic matter quality.. The available P (Olsen)
   was 8.6 kg ha(-1) in the continuous cropping and ranged from 14.1, kg
   ha(-1). (natural fallow) to 29.2 kg ha(-1) (Leucaena fallow). Greater
   maize and cassava yields were obtained in the fallow plots than in the
   control during, the subsequent cropping. The maize grain yield after
   fallow could be predicted by the potentially mineralizable N in surface
   soil (0-15 cm). Leucaena and Acacia are promising species for planted
   fallows for soil regeneration in the humid tropics. The binding of
   protein by polyphenols during leaf decomposition, as confirmed by higher
   N immobilization with the increase in leaf polyphenols, could be the
   main mechanism in the contribution of polyphenols to SOC and N
   replenish, ment in the degraded soil. The study suggests the possibility
   of stabilizing C and N in tropical ecosystems by manipulating
   polyphenols in vegetation.},

Abstract = {In order to know the performance of pasture and soil stability
   indicators, a study was developed between 2002 and 2003 in a system with
   dairy heifers on hydrated red ferralitic soil, based on Cynodon
   nlemfuensis as basic pasture and a tree mixture (Lysiloma bahamensis,
   Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia falcatoria, Gmelina arborea, Terminalia
   sp, Azadirachta indica (Neem) and Eritrina mysorensis). The following
   indicators were measured: botanical composition, density and frequency
   of appearance of species, macrofauna, biological diversity of the
   edaphic fauna, biomass availability and aggregate distribution in humid
   and dry conditions. The analysis of principal components permitted
   determining the indicators that explained the best the variability in
   the system. Between the plant variables, those explaining the best the
   variability were the percentage of star grass, legumes and weeds, as
   well as the biomass availability. The highest aggregates on soil were of
   3 mm and from 0.5 to 0.2 mm of diameter in the sieving in humid
   conditions, whereas in the sieving in dry conditions, from I to 0.5 mm,
   from 2 to I mm and higher than 10 mm. In the dry season, the percentage
   of star grass and legumes was increased in the sampling years whereas
   the weeds disappeared. In the rainy season, there was decrease of
   Cynodon nlemfuensis and legumes, as well as an increment from 21.6\% to
   35.1\% of weeds. However, in both seasons, Cynodon nlemfuensis was kept
   as predominant species with more than 55\%. The system availability had
   significant difference between seasons. The aggregates higher than 3 mm
   were increased between the years for the depth from 0 to 15 mm whereas
   for more than 30 cm, they decreased between 0.5 and 0.2 mm. This
   improves the soil structure. Besides, the resistance to penetration had
   adequate values and was kept stable, while the biological diversity of
   the edaphic fauna increased in the second year. It is concluded that the
   biomass availability tended to be stable in the system, the biological
   diversity was increased and the physical conditions of the soil were
   improved. Despite the fluctuations in the botanical composition, Cynodon
   nlemfuensis was preserved as predominant species. It is recommended to
   continue the systematic control of the indicators selected to know the
   effects of the management and validate their effectiveness to monitor
   the plant and edaphic performance.},

Title = {The relations of stomatal closure and reopening to xylem ABA
   concentration and leaf water potential during soil drying and rewatering},
Journal = {PLANT GROWTH REGULATION},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {77-86},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Two tropical tree species, Acacia confusa and Leucaena leucocephala,
   were used to study the relationships among stomatal conductance, xylem
   ABA concentration and leaf water potential during a soil drying and
   rewatering cycle. Stomatal conductance of both A. confusa and L.
   leucocephala steadily decreased with the decreases in soil water content
   and pre-dawn leaf water potential. Upon rewatering, soil water content
   and pre-dawn leaf water potential rapidly returned to the control
   levels, whereas the reopening of stomata showed an obvious lag time. The
   length of this lag time was highly dependent not only upon the degree of
   water stress but also on plant species. The more severe the water
   stress, the longer the lag time. When A. confusa and L. leucocephala
   plants were exposed to the same degree of water stress (around -2.0 MPa
   in pre-dawn leaf water potential), the stomata of A. confusa reopened to
   the control level 6 days after rewatering. However, it took L.
   leucocephala about 14 days to reopen fully. A very similar response of
   leaf photosynthesis to soil water deficit was also observed for both
   species. Soil drying resulted in a significant increase in leaf and
   xylem ABA concentrations in both species. The more severe the water
   stress, the higher the leaf and xylem ABA concentrations. Both leaf ABA
   and xylem ABA returned to the control level following relief from water
   deficit and preceded the full recovery of stomata, suggesting that the
   lag phase of stomatal reopening was not controlled by leaf and/or xylem
   ABA. In contrast to drying the whole root system, drying half of the
   root system did not change the leaf water relations, but caused a
   significant increase in xylem ABA concentration, which could fully
   explain the decrease of stomatal conductance. After rewatering, the
   stomatal conductance of plants in which half of the roots were dried
   recovered more rapidly than those of whole-root dried plants, indicating
   that the leaf water deficit that occurred during the drying period was
   related to the post-stress stomatal inhibition. These results indicated
   that the decrease in stomatal conductance caused by water deficit was
   closely related to the increase in xylem ABA, but xylem ABA could not
   fully explain the reopening of stomata after relief of water stress,
   neither did the leaf ABA. Some unknown physiological and/or
   morphological processes in the guard cells may be related to the
   recovery process.},

   OTHER GENERA FOR HEAVY CLAY SOILS},

Abstract = {There is a dearth of pasture and ley legume cultivars for use on
   alkaline and clay soils in tropical areas. Recognizing this, the
   collaborative Australia-UWI Forage Research Programme, with field
   studies in Belize and Antigua, took advantage of the proximity of these
   soils, the rich floras with high endemism and researchers' sustained
   residency in the area, and assembled a genetic resource collection of
   potentially useful legumes. This chapter provides details of an initial
   assessment for local needs of part of this collection undertaken in
   Belize.
   The evaluation of the accessions began at the point of collection, with
   the acquisition of information on the climates and soils. It was
   continued with a simple field experiment designed to provide specimens
   for identification, for the taxonomic status of many was uncertain, and
   to broadly categorize a selection of the accessions in terms of
   perenniality, persistence and vigour of growth in the wet and dry
   seasons under 1460-1860 mm of rainfall. Evaluation was carried out on a
   heavy clay soil with a neutral pH in a wet tropical environment that
   contrasts with the much lighter acid soils that most previous forage
   research had been carried out on.
   It was found that some species that had been successful and provided
   cultivars for wetter conditions elsewhere were also successful here,
   notably Centrosema pubescens and Macroptilium atropurpureum, both of
   which demonstrated much potentially useful variation. Desmodium incanum,
   a species that has shown promise elsewhere, also showed potential.
   However, Stylosanthes guianensis and the widely used dryland species S.
   scabra both failed to survive. `New species' of particular interest were
   found in Galactia and Desmanthus, with the latter genus affording a new
   form of pasture legume in between the tree legume Leucaena leucocephala
   and suffruticose perennial herbs such as Desmodium incanum. The
   potential of Desmanthus as fodder is discussed.
   This retrospective analysis, when viewed in the light of more recent
   findings, illustrates the potential value of a genetic resource
   component in aid projects. It has resulted, for instance, in the first
   domestication of the species Desmanthus pubescens and has demonstrated
   that novel genetic variation was captured in this and other species. The
   results focus attention on potentially useful genotypes both in species
   already in domestication and others that remain undeveloped. Brief
   mention is made on the value of germplasm collections generally and
   their utility in the face of global climate change and the loss of plant
   biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Four crossbred (Alpine x Beetal) milch goats (24 months; 30 kg live
   weight) in early lactation received during 31 days increasing levels of
   Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM): 25, 50, 75 and 100\% of dietary
   DM during first, second, third and fourth week onwards, respectively.
   Remaining dietary DM was supplied through green berseem and a
   concentrate mixture which constituted the whole diet after the 31 days
   feeding on LLM. Mimosine and 3-hydroxy-4 (1H) pyridone (3,4 DHP)
   contents of the LLM were 1.88 and 0.78\% respectively. Daily average
   mimosine, 3,4 DHP and total toxin intake was 196, 82 and 278; 339, 141
   and 480; 553, 230 and 783; and 648, 269 and 971 g kg(-1) live weight (W)
   during first, second, third and from fourth week onwards, respectively.
   DM intake on sole feeding of LLM was 65.9 g kg(-1) W-0.75. NO clinical
   toxicity symptoms were noted. Milk yield started declining from Day 27
   onwards and reached the lowest level on Day 33 though LLM was
   discontinued from Day 31 onwards. Milk yield started improving from Day
   37 and reached a peak by Day 49. The milk samples were free of mimosine
   and DHP, possibly due to some kind of barrier between blood and udder.
   Mimosine was not detectable in blood serum samples. The 3,4 DHP
   concentration in the blood serum, however, ranged from 97 on Day 8 to
   402 mu g ml(-1) on Day 29 and disappeared completely by Day 36 when
   animals were on conventional diet. During metabolism trial faecal
   excretion of mimosine and 3,4 DHP was 4.43 and 17.9\% of total toxin
   intake, respectively. Urinary excretion of mimosine was 1.59\% while
   that of 3,4 DHP and 2,3 DHP through farces and urine was 52.17\% of
   total toxin consumed. DCP and TDN values of LLM in goats were 16.03 and
   61.58\%, respectively. Goats were in positive N balance. The T-3 and T-4
   levels declined but DM intake was not affected. The SGOT and SGPT values
   were in the normal range. The study indicated that LLM could form a
   substantial portion of milch goat ration and milk of such goats being
   free of mimosine and DHP should be fit for human consumption. (C) 1999

Title = {Effects of invasive species on the ecosystem services of a tropical
   insular protected area in Brazil},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {72},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) represent a global problem for biodiversity
   conservation, and a growing concern involving IAS is related to their
   impacts on ecosystem services. However, their effects on ecosystem
   services in insular ecosystems are poorly known, which are particularly
   relevant and concerning due to the fragility and limited resources in
   these areas for several organisms, including humans. Therefore, the
   present study aimed to inventory ecosystem services and assess the
   impact of IAS on these services and the terrestrial ecosystems of the
   Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, Brazil, which is a tropical protected
   area. The approach was applied to four IAS: black rat (Rattus rattus),
   domestic cat (Felis catus), tegu lizard (Salvator merianae), and lead
   tree (Leucaena leucocephala). A worksheet for ecosystem services was
   created, using the subdivisions defined in the zoning of the protected
   areas of Fernando de Noronha as management units, namely Urban Area,
   Beach Area, Green Area, Primitive Area, and Secondary Island.
   Additionally, two quantitative approaches were combined: the INvasive
   Species Effects Assessment Tool (INSEAT) to assess the positive and
   negative effects of IAS on ecosystem services, based on a questionnaire
   applied to experts; and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services
   and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software to estimate the risk of impacts from
   IAS. In total, 21 ecosystem services, 41 benefits, and 10 groups of
   benefitting social actors were identified in Fernando de Noronha. In
   general, all IAS presented risks to the ecosystem services of Fernando
   de Noronha, especially F. catus and R. rattus. According to the impact
   index, the IAS caused negative effects to most ecosystem services
   considered, but the effects were more pronounced on the provisioning and
   cultural ecosystem service groups. On the other hand, a positive effect
   was found for L. leucocephala on regulating and maintenance services,
   although with a low impact index. With the exception of the Urban Area,
   all management units showed a high risk of being impacted by IAS,
   especially the Primitive Area. The main social actors impacted by the
   IAS were the local community, the floating population, and the
   Administration. The present study is the first to combine these
   quantitative techniques (INSEAT and InVEST) and represents a set of
   guidelines for ecosystem-based management to mitigate the impact of IAS,
   aiming at the maintenance and improvement of ecosystem services within
   protected areas in insular environments.},

Title = {Feed resource selection of Criollo goats artificially infected with
   Haemonchus contortus: nutritional wisdom and prophylactic
   self-medication},
Journal = {ANIMAL},

Volume = {12},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Previous cafeteria studies suggested that a moderate natural
   gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infection did not modify the resource
   selection of adult Criollo goats towards tannin-rich plants compared
   with worm-free goats. A higher infection with Haemonchus contortus could
   trigger a change in the resource selection behaviour towards tannin-rich
   foliage. Alternatively, goats might select plant species solely to meet
   their nutritional requirements. A cafeteria study investigated the
   effect of a high artificial infection with H. contortus on the feed
   resource selection of goats. Adult Criollo goats (37.5 +/- 4.8 kg BW)
   with browsing experience were distributed in two groups: the infected
   group (IG) with six animals artificially infected with H. contortus
   (6000 L-3/animal); and the non-infected group (NIG) with six animals
   maintained worm-free. The experiment included two 5-day periods with
   additional 5-day adaptation period. In the first period, animals were
   offered foliage of five plant species with a decreasing gradient of
   condensed tannins (CT) (Mimosa bahamensis, Gymnopodium floribundum,
   Havardia albicans, Acacia pennatula, Lysiloma latisiliqum), and three
   plant species with negligible CT content (Leucaena leucocephala,
   Piscidia piscipula and Brosimum alicastrum). In the second period the
   foliage of B. alicastrum was withdrawn. A grain-based concentrate feed
   was offered daily at 1\% BW in DM basis. Dry matter and nutrient intake
   was determined. Foliage selection of each experimental group was
   determined using the Chesson selection index. The H. contortus egg count
   per gram of faeces (EPG) was determined for infected goats twice daily.
   Chesson index showed a similar pattern of foliage selection on periods 1
   and 2. Mean EPG of goats in IG was 2028 +/- 259 EPG during period 1 and
   1 293 +/- 198 EPG during period 2 (P > 0.05). During period 1, the
   selection pattern was highest for B. alicastrum (tannin-free), followed
   by a tannin-rich plant (M. bahamensis). These two plants remained as
   highly selected during period 2. The Chesson index showed that both
   experimental groups (IG and NIG) selected the same plant species in both
   periods. Thus, a high H. contortus infection did not affect selection of
   goats fed with CT-rich plants. Apparently, goats balanced their nutrient
   intake with the plants selected, showing evidence of nutritional wisdom.
   This balance may have helped to prevent excess protein in the diet and
   also to maintain a low GIN infection, both considered as examples of
   prophylactic self-medication.},

Title = {Effect of foliages containing condensed tannins and on gastrointestinal
   parasites},
Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {121},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {77-87},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {Many different commercial products are available to remove internal
   parasites from small ruminants in which the drugs are available and
   produced in several different physical forms, and sold under various
   brand names. It is increasingly evident that gastrointestinal parasite
   (GIP) control programs based on dewormers are failing because of
   increased dewormer resistance; thus, alternative GIP control strategies
   are necessary.
   Leaves from multipurpose trees are often rich in N and minerals, and
   especially important for animal production during critical periods of
   the year when both the quantity and quality of pasture is limited.
   However, leaves or foliage of multipurpose tree species often contain
   high amounts of secondary compounds, especially tannins, which may have
   a limited impact on increasing the productivity of the animals.
   Tannins play a significant role in the nutrition of animals, causing
   either adverse or beneficial effects on nutrient utilization, health and
   production. The ideal concentration of CT in forage legumes generally
   ranges from 20-40 g/kg DM, at which level they may bind with the dietary
   proteins during mastication and protect the protein from microbial
   attack in the rumen. CT have biological effects on the control of GIP;
   possible direct effects could be mediated through CT-nematode
   interactions, which reduce nematode viability.
   Recent studies in Vietnam have reported that anti-parasitic agents
   extracted from plant materials for the control of parasites in goats
   were successful and have been introduced in practice as Citrullus
   vulgaris for tapeworms, Gliricida sepium and Artocarpus heterophilus for
   common intestinal worms, and Areca catechu for liver fluke. Alternative
   forages of Mimosa, Papaya, Leucaena leucocephala, Goava leave Mimisa
   spp. and Flerningia macrophylla have effects on larvae of Haemonchus in
   vitro. Research on the effects of Cassava, Jackfruit and Leucaena
   leaves, Guinea grass and Ruzi grass or cutting height of guinea grass in
   diets on infection rates of intestinal nematodes and live weight gain of
   goats has been undetaken. The strongyle egg counts and coccidial oocyt
   counts were much lower with goats fed foliage of Leucaena, Jackfruit and
   Cassava in comparison with goats fed Guinea grass and Ruzi grass. This
   indicates a reduced need for anthelmintic drugs to control GIP in
   grazing goats fed CT-containing foliage.
   The results showed that differences in parasite infection between
   forages were probably due to differences in their CT concentration,
   although further research into the effect of feeding forage legumes
   containing CT on parasite infections is required. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The xylem ureide method, based on analysis of xylem sap for N solutes
   associated with N-2 fixation (ureides) and soil-N use (NO3-, alpha
   amino-N), is used for estimating Pfix (proportion of plant N derived
   from N-2 fixation) of herbaceous species of the leguminous tribes
   Phaseoleae and Desmodieae and may have application for tree legumes. We
   report experiments, involving Calliandra calothyrsus, Leucaena
   leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Sesbania grandiflora, Desmodium
   rensonii and Codariocalyx gyroides, to: (i) determine for each species
   the composition of N solutes of xylem sap and to calibrate, where
   possible, the xylem ureide method using N-15 isotope dilution as an
   independent measure of Pfix; and (ii) establish appropriate procedures
   for sampling xylem sap in field studies. In the first experiment, the
   tree legumes were grown for 55-77 weeks and sampled repeatedly (6-9
   times) for vacuum-extracted xylem sap, shoot dry matter, total N and
   N-15. Asparagine was the predominant amino compound in xylem sap of all
   species. The relative abundance of ureide-N in xylem sap (ureide-N as a
   proportion of ureide-N + alpha amino-N + NO3--N) was compared with Pfix
   for five of the six tree legumes. Sap of S. grandiflora,a could not be
   analysed for ureides and NO3- using the standard colorimetric methods
   because of high levels of non-specific, background colour. For D.
   rensonii and C. gyroides, relative ureide-N ranged from less than 20\%
   (Pfix of zero) to around 65 and 40\%, respectively (Pfix of 100\%).
   Functions describing the relationships between relative ureide-N (y) and
   Pfix (x) were: y = 18.3 + 0.446x (r = 0.91) for D. rensonii; and y =
   8.49 + 0.279x (r = 0.92) for C. gyroides. With the other three species,
   relative ureide-N was not related to Pfix. We concluded that the xylem
   ureide technique is suitable for estimating Pfix for D. rensonii and C.
   gyroides only. In the second experiment, established trees of G. sepium,
   D. rensonii, C. calothyrsus and C. gyroides were used to assess sampling
   protcols. Results indicated that vacuum extraction of sap should proceed
   immediately the branch is cut, that plants need to be sampled around
   noon to eliminate diurnal effects and that branch-re-branch variation in
   relative ureide-N values within a single tree was minor.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Seven experiments were used to evaluate nutritional screening techniques
   in terms of their usefulness for rapidly characterising new plant
   introductions. Characteristics were the ability to grow and nodulate on
   different soil types, reaction to waterlogging, the response to
   phosphorus fertiliser, growth on an acid soil of low calcium and
   phosphorus status, ability to nodulate and grow at various pH and
   calcium levels, and the reaction to high manganese, aluminium and
   salinity. Legumes were Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham,
   Macroptilium lathyroides cv. Murray, M. atropurpureum cv. Siratro,
   Centrosema schiedianum cv. Belalto, Stylosanthes guianensis cv. Cook, S.
   hamata cv. Verano, S. hamata CPI 33205, and S. scabra cw. Seca and
   Fitzroy. Plants were grown in soil, sand and solution cultures in a
   glasshouse at Townsville, north Queensland.
   Where it was possible to validate the responses of the test species with
   findings from previous studies, the screening techniques provided a
   reasonable assessment of the nutritional value of the legumes. The 9
   legumes reacted differently (in terms of growth) on the 3 contrasting
   soils, failed to nodulate effectively on those soils, but responded
   differently to waterlogging, phosphorus application and high solution
   levels of manganese and aluminium. Techniques for assessing the plants
   under acid, low calcium conditions and salinity did not appear to be
   successful, possibly because the species were tolerant of those
   conditions.
   Murray, Siratro, Belalto, Verano and Fitzroy grew well on all 3
   contrasting soils, but the other legumes reacted differently to soil
   type with added nitrogen fertiliser. The legumes responded differently
   to phosphorus application on a red earth soil of low phosphorus status,
   with Cunningham, S. hamata 33205, Seca and Fitzroy giving relatively low
   yield responses compared to the other legumes. Under waterlogged
   conditions, Cunningham, Murray, Verano, Seca and Fitzroy performed
   better than the others. Reactions to conditions of low pH and low
   calcium status varied between legumes, and with culture conditions. On
   the yellow earth, growth was generally poor, with Murray, Belalto and
   Seca being more tolerant of low soil calcium than the other legumes. In
   sand culture conditions, Belalto alone responded quite markedly to
   increasing pH and calcium concentration. Elevated salt concentration
   (1.2 mM NaCl) did not greatly affect any legumes, but additional
   manganese reduced yield of Siratro only to 61\% and high aluminium
   markedly reduced yields of all legumes except Fitzroy. Results generally
   agreed well with previous experience with these legumes under field and
   glasshouse conditions.},

Abstract = {Temporal changes in soil chemical and nutritional properties were
   evaluated in a long-term experiment conducted on Alfisols in West
   Africa. Effects of land use and cropping duration on soil chemical
   properties at 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths were evaluated for five
   treatments: (1) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala established on
   the contour at 4-m intervals; (2) mucuna (Mucuna utilis) fallowing for 1
   year followed by maize (Zea mays)-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cultivation
   for 2 years on severely degraded land; (3) fallowing with mucuna on
   moderately degraded soils; (4) ley farming involving growing improved
   pastures for 1 year, grazing for the second year, and growing
   maize-cowpea for the third year on severely degraded land; (5) ley
   farming on moderately degraded soils. Soil chemical properties were
   measured once every year from 1982 through 1986 during the dry season,
   and included pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TSN),
   Bray-P, exchangeable cations, and effective cation exchange capacity
   (CEC). Regardless of the cropping system treatments, soil chemical
   quality decreased with cultivation time. The rate of decrease at 0-5 cm
   depth was 0.23 units year(-1) for pH, 0.05 per cent year(-1) for SOC,
   0.012 per cent year(-1) for TSN, 0.49 cmol kg(-1) year(-1) for Ca2+,
   0.03 cmol kg(-1) year(-1) for Mg2+, 0.018 cmol kg(-1) year(-1) for K+,
   and 0.48 cmol kg(-1) year(-1) for CEC. Although there was also a general
   decrease in soil chemical quality at 5-10 cm depth, the trends were not
   clearly defined. In contrast to the decrease in soil properties given
   above, there was an increase in concentration at 0-5 cm depth of total
   acidity with cultivation time at the rate of 0.62 cmol kg(-1) year(-1)
   and of Mn3+ concentration at the rate of 0.081 cmol kg(-1) year(-1).
   Continuous cropping also increased the concentration of Bray-P at 0-5 cm
   depth due to application of phosphatic fertilizer. Trends in soil
   chemical properties were not clearly defined with regards to cropping
   system treatments. In general, however, soil chemical properties were
   relatively favorable in ley farming and mucuna fallowing treatments
   imposed on moderately degraded soils. Results are discussed in terms of
   recommended rates of fertilizer use, in view of soil test values,
   expected yields, and critical limits of soil properties.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Silvopastoral systems can modulate the thermoregulatory behavior of
   buffaloes decreasing the heat stress and improving the animal welfare in
   the tropics. The objective of this study was to compare the behavior of
   heifer buffaloes in a silvopastoral systems with Leucahena leucocephala
   trees and a conventional system without trees under two heat stress
   condition (intense heat stress and moderate heat stress) in Cuba. The
   results show that despite intense heat stress conditions, the animals
   spent more time feeding in the silvopastoral system than in the
   conventional system. Besides, the silvopastoral system reduced the use
   of water in the wallowing areas. We conclude that pastures with trees
   increase fodder offer while improve grazing behavior and animal welfare
   for buffalo farming in tropical conditions.
   In the wake of climate change and global warming, the production systems
   of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) are receiving increasing attention
   in the tropics, where the silvopastoral systems can improve animal
   welfare and production conditions. The objective of this study was to
   characterize the behavior of heifer buffaloes in a silvopastoral system
   (SPS) with Leucaena leucocephala (600 trees/ha) and in a conventional
   system (CVS), under intense heat stress and moderate heat stress in
   Cuba. We observed nine animals, with an average weight of 167.9 kg at
   the beginning of the study, during the daylight period, from 6:00 to
   18:00 h, at 10 min intervals, for 12 days. Activities recorded were
   grazing, ingestion of tree leaves, rumination, water intake, walking,
   lying, standing, sheltering in the shade of trees, and wallowing.
   Sheltering in the shade of trees and wallowing were collectively
   considered as thermoregulatory behavior (TB). TB was different in both
   systems and conditions of heat stress (p < 0.05), with 4.06 in CVS and
   3.81 h in SPS in the intense heat stress period, while it was 2.91 and
   1.08 h for SPS and CVS, respectively, during the moderate heat stress
   period. The wallowing activity showed statistically significant
   differences (p < 0.05) in the intense heat stress season with 1.18 and
   2.35 h for SPS and CVS, respectively. Time spent on feeding behavior was
   highest in the SPS system (p < 0.05). Longer times of thermoregulatory
   and feeding behavior indicate the importance of trees in animal welfare
   for this species in tropical conditions, thus supporting avoided
   deforestation and the replanting of trees in existing production systems
   and landscapes.},

   for 24 h, and the remaining PEG in the supernatant measured to estimate
   the PEG bound to the sample. PEG binding was then related to IVND and to
   the difference between the IVND of the samples measured with and without
   PEG. In the absence of PEG, the ranking of the species for IVDMD was:
   Gliricidia sepium>Panicum maximum>Leucaena leucocephala>L. trichandra>L.
   pallida>Calliandra calothyrsus>Acacia boliviana. PEG increased IVDMD for
   A. boliviana, decreased it for L. pallida and had no effect on the other
   species (p>0.05). The CIVDMD values for the legumes were all higher with
   + PEG by a mean of 8.6\% units, though the species ranking remained the
   same. IVND varied from 82\% for G. sepium to 49\% for C. calothyrsus in
   the absence of PEG. The rankings were similar to those for IVDMD. PEG
   increased the IVND of all species except the grass and reduced the range
   from 86.6\% with G. sepium to 75.5\% with P. maximum. There are no
   condensed tannins in P. maximum and so PEG had no effect on IVDMD or
   IVND. PEG binding of the legume species in mg/g DM (x) was negatively
   related to IVND\% (y) in the absence of PEG: y=92.3-0.322x; r(2)=0.941,
   and to the IVND difference between the + and - PEG treatments (y): y=
   -7.5+0.303x; r(2)=0.923.
   The results show that the tannins in these shrub species can have a
   large effect on IVDMD and an even larger effect on IVND, consequently
   the potential value of A. boliviana and C. calothyrsus for improving
   animal production should be questioned. The digestibility of the
   psyllid-tolerant L. pallida and L. trichandra was also shown to be lower
   than that of the proven high quality but psyllid susceptible L.
   leucocephala. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Title = {Longterm alley cropping with four hedgerow species on an Alfisol in
   southwestern Nigeria - effect on crop performance, soil chemical

Abstract = {A longterm alley cropping trial was undertaken on an eroded Oxic
   paleustalf in the forest-savanna transition zone of southwestern Nigeria
   from 1981-1993. Two nitrogen fixing hedgerow species (Gliricidia sepium
   and Leucaena leucocephala) and two non legume hedgerow species
   (Alchornea cordifolia and Dactyladenia barteri) were used in the trial
   compared to a control (with no hedgerow) treatment. Plots were
   sequentially cropped with maize (main season) followed by cowpea (minor
   season). With 4 m interhedgerow spacing and pruning at 0.75 m height,
   the mean annual pruning biomass yields were observed in the following
   order: Leucaena (7.1 t ha(-1)) > Gliricidia (4.9 t ha(-1)) > Alchornea
   (3.7 t ha(-1)) > Dactyladenia (3.0 t ha(-1) ). Alley cropping with the
   four woody species greatly enhanced the total plot (woody species +
   crop) biomass yield/ha as follows; Leucaena (21.8 t ha(-1)) > Gliricidia
   (17.7 t ha(-1)) > Alchornea (11.7 t ha(-1)) > Dactyladenia (9.5 t
   ha(-1)). Total biomass yield of crops in control plot was 5.3 t ha(-1).
   Higher biomass yields with alley cropping also increased nutrient yield
   and cycling. Gliricidia and Leucaena showed higher nutrient yields than
   Alchornea and Dactyladenia. Alley cropping with Gliricidia and Leucaena
   could sustain maize yield at moderate level (>2 t ha(-1)), which would
   require a N-rate of 45 kg N ha(-1) with sole cropping. Application of N
   in Gliricidia and Leucaena alley cropping still improved maize yield.
   Higher nitrogen rates are required for alley cropping with Alchornea and
   Dactyladenia hedgerows. A low rate of phosphorus application is needed
   for sustaining crop yields with all treatments. Occasional tillage is
   recommended to increase maize yield. Alley cropping and tillage showed
   little effect on cowpea seed yield. Surface soil properties declined
   with time with continuous cultivation. Alley cropping with woody species
   maintained higher soil organic carbon, phosphorus and potassium levels.
   Plots alley cropped with Gliricidia and Leucaena showed lower pH and
   extractable calcium level. Leucaena alley cropped plot also showed lower
   magnesium level. The decline in soil pH and extractable cations may be
   due to increased cation leaching with application of high rates of
   Gliricidia and Leucaena prunings. Alley cropping with the four woody
   species showed no effect on population of parasitic nematodes.},

Abstract = {In present study 20 diets were formulated using Heteropogon contortus
   (HC) grass with 5 tree leaves (Hardwickia binata-HB, Albizia lebbek-AL,
   Grewia optiva-GO, Anogeissus pendulla-AP and Leucaena leucocephala-LL)
   and 5 shrubs (Dichrostachys cineria-DC, Securengia virosa-SV, Zizyphus
   xylophyrus-ZX, Helictris isora-HI and Acacia catechu-AC) in 75:25 and
   50:50 ratios, which were evaluated for their nutritional composition and
   in vitro nutrients digestibility, fermentation and gas production in
   sheep and goat rumen inoculums to select grass: tree leaves/shrubs
   species and their ratio for silipastoral system of small ruminants.
   Diets differed significantly (P < 0.05) in CP, NDF, ADF, cellulose and
   lignin contents. Diets with 50:50 and 75:25 ratios of HC grass with
   foliage also differed significantly (P < 0.05) in CP and fiber contents.
   Nutrients degradability differed significantly (P < 0.05) amongst diets
   in rumen inoculums of both sheep and goats and were similar between
   HC-foliage diets in 50:50 and 75:25 ratios. Sheep and goats had similar
   nutrients degradability, while sheep and goats tended to degrade more
   nutrients at 75:25 than 50:50 ratios, respectively. Diets degradability
   values for DM, CP, NDF and ADF were 62.73, 57.90, 47.22 and 42.75 in
   sheep and 63.22, 62.06, 49.22 and 42.77\% in goats, respectively. Diets
   differed significantly (P < 0.05) for in vitro TVFA, total N and ammonia
   N concentration in rumen inoculum of sheep and goats. Total-N and
   ammonia-N was higher (P < 0.05) from diets with 50: 50 ratio of HC
   grass-foliage diets than 75:25 ratio. Mean TVFA, total-N and ammonia-N
   contents were 62.38, 40.20 and 9.31 in sheep and 63.40 meq/l, 41.72
   mg/100 ml and 9.45 mg/100 ml in goat's rumen liquor. Diets differed
   significantly (P < 0.05) in IVDMD, gas production and partition factor
   in both species. Gas production tended to be more in sheep (156.73) than
   goats inoculums (142.76 ml/g). Results showed that HC:LL and HC: GO
   diets are superior in nutrients content, digestibility and metabolites
   production, while sheep and goat exhibited relatively higher nutrients
   utilization and more total volatile fatty acid production at 75:25 and

Title = {In vitro rumen biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids in
   tropical grass-legume rations},
Journal = {VETERINARY WORLD},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {661-668},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of various
   combinations of tropical grass-legume species in rations on the
   biohydrogenation (BH) activity of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), C18:0
   composition, and fermentation profile in an in vitro rumen system.
   Materials and Methods: Samples of the following five fodder plants were
   used: One species of grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and four species of
   tree legumes (Leucaena leucocephala, Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra
   calothyrsus, and Indigofera zollingeriana). The following eight
   experimental diets were evaluated: 50\% P. purpureum + 50\% L.
   leucocephala ( LL I); 50\% P. purpureum + 50\% G. sepium (GS I); 50\% P.
   purpureum + 50\% C. calothyrsus (CC I); 50\% P. purpureum + 50\% I.
   zollingeriana (IZ I); 75\% P. purpureum + 25\% L. leucocephala (LL II);
   75\% P. purpureum + 25\% G. sepium (GS II); 75\% P. purpureum + 25\% C.
   calothyrsus (CC II); and 75\% P. purpureum + 25\% I. zollingeriana (IZ
   II). Each ration was replicated 3 times. In vitro rumen incubation was
   performed for 48 h, according to the Tilley and Terry method.
   Determination of the FA profiles of the forage materials and rumen fluid
   samples was performed using gas chromatography.
   Results: The percentage of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) in the forage
   materials ranged from 34.18\% (P. purpureum) to 74.51\% (C.
   calothyrsus). The percentage of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) ranged from
   5.06\% (P. purpureum) to 8.71\% (L. leucocephala). The percentage of
   saturated FA (SFA) was the lowest at 19.12\% (C. calothyrsus) and
   highest at 60.76\% (P. purpureum). In vitro BH of C18:3 n-3, C18:2 n-6,
   C18:1 n-9, and C18 PUFA in the experimental diets ranged from 72\% to
   100\%. The BH of C18:1 n-9 in GS I (80\%) and IZ I (72\%) was
   significantly different (p<0.05). The percentage of C18:0 was 10-50\%
   and significantly different (p<0.05) among treatments, with the highest
   (of 50\%) in GS II. No significant differences (p>0.05) were observed in
   the fermentation parameters (pH, total volatile FAs, in vitro dry matter
   digestibility, and in vitro organic matter digestibility) among the
   treatments, except in NH 3 concentration (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: The various combinations of tropical legumes do not have
   significant inhibitory effects on the BH of C18:2 n-6, C18:3 n-3, and
   C18 PUFA after in vitro incubation for 48 h. Furthermore, an increase in
   the tropical legume ratio in the ration tends to suppress C18:0
   formation after the fermentation simulation process. IZ I has the
   potential to reduce C18:1 n-9 (MUFA) disappearance and yield an ideal
   rumen fermentation profile.},

Abstract = {Leucaena leucocephala is cultivated at close spacings that do not permit
   intercropping. This has been a discouraging factor for small landholders
   who need regular income to establish leucaena plantations and benefit
   horn the rapidly expanding market for wood. Therefore, on-farm
   experiments were conducted near Bhadrachalam, Khammam district, Andhra
   Pradesh, India, from August 2001 to January 2006, to study the effect of
   reducing tree density and modifying tree geometry on the growth of
   leucaena and productivity of intercrops. The inter-row spacing of 1.3 m
   in farmers' practice was increased up to 13 m to examine whether
   wide-row planting and grouping of certain rows would facilitate extended
   intercropping without sacrificing wood yield. Tree density treatments
   tried were 1.3 x 1.3 m, 3 x 0.75 m, 3 x 1 m, 5 x 0.8 m and 3 x 2 m which
   gives densities 5919, 4444, 3333, 2500 and 1666 trees ha(-1),
   respectively. Tree geometry treatments tested were 7 x 1 in paired row
   spacing (7 x 1 PR), 10 x 1 m triple row spacing (10 x 1 TR) and 13 x 1 m
   four rows (13 x 1 FR) with a constant tree population of 2500 trees ha
   I. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) was the intercrop. While changes in tree
   density affected diameter at breast height (DBH) significantly,
   modification of tree geometry did not affect tree height and DBH.
   Marketable wood and dry biomass productivity was highest with 3 x 0.75 m
   spacing, and reducing tree density and alteration of tree geometry
   reduced the biomass considerably. In 2001, 2002 and 2003 seasons,
   respectively, tree spacing at 3 m produced mean yields of 97, 23 and
   11\% of the sole clop cowpea yield whereas modified tree geometry
   treatments produced mean yields of 97, 61 and 20\% of sole crop yield.
   The widest spacing (13 x 1 FR) recorded 95, 73 and 30\% of the sole crop
   yields during 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Net returns from
   intercropping of leucaena in 3 x 0.75 m spacing was 36\% higher than
   that of the farmers' practice. Although wider tree geometry treatments
   recorded lower net returns, they provided higher intercrop yields and
   returns in the first two years of plantation establishment. Therefore,
   it can be concluded that in regions where annual rainfall is around 1000
   mm, leucaena can be planted at a spacing of 3 x 0.75 m for improving
   intercrop performance; higher tree productivity and returns.},

Title = {Profitability of cassava-maize production under different fallow systems

Abstract = {Population pressure has diminished the role of the traditional bush
   fallow system in restoring the fertility of depleted soils following
   several years of cultivation in the derived savanna of Southwest
   Nigeria. The search for alternative fallow systems led to the
   development of alley cropping using Leucaena leucocephala and cover
   cropping using Pueraria phaseoloides. These soil-conserving systems also
   embody the principles of sustainability by ensuring stable crop yields
   in spite of an increase in land-use intensity. Simulating smallholder
   farm conditions and based on a split-plot experiment with the three
   fallow systems as the main plots and four different land-use intensities
   (LUI) as the subplots, simple direct observation and record keeping were
   used to collect data on labour use in all farm operations including
   fuelwood cutting and stacking in alley cropping systems with fallow
   phases. Data collection covered a period of four years (1993-96),
   corresponding to one out of the three phases (or complete cycles) of the
   trial. Partial budget analysis was used to estimate profitability of
   cassava (Manihot utilissima)-maize (Zea mays) under each LUI Results
   based on crop production indicate that each of the cassava-maize
   enterprises was profitable but the level of profit varied from 10 819 to
   50 289 Naira ha(-1). Production under cover cropping has a net benefit
   advantage of 4-25\% (over that under bush fallow) and 25-60\% (over
   alley cropping). Profitability increased as the LUI decreased, depicting
   the overall importance of fallow periods on soil fertility restoration.
   Results based on crop production plus fuelwood operations indicate that
   production with cover cropping has a net benefit advantage over that of
   both bush fallow and alley cropping under both zero-fallow and one-year
   fallow LUIs. However, results from two- and three-year fallows indicate
   that fuelwood yield generated sufficient revenue to put alley cropping
   at a net benefit advantage of 29-42\% over bush fallow and 26-37\% over
   cover cropping. From these results, cover cropping is recommended,
   especially to farmers in areas where, although land shortage is a
   problem, fuelwood and the other sources of domestic energy are still
   cheap and easily accessible. However, in areas with abundant land and
   where farmers can still wait for fallow periods of at least two years,
   alley cropping is recommended since, in addition to soil fertility
   improvement, substantial revenue is obtained. However, considerations of
   yield variability, labour scarcity, as well as risk-aversion behaviour
   among farmers may alter their technology choice.},

Abstract = {To supplement high costs of inorganic fertilizers, smallholder farmers
   in the tropics are likely to increase the use of appropriate plant
   residues as an alternative source of plant nutrients especially nitrogen
   (N) and phosphorus (P). To maximize benefit accrued from these
   materials, synchronizing nutrient release patterns of the materials with
   crop's nutrient requirements need to be understood. Consequently, this
   study was undertaken to: (1) evaluate the effect of plant residues on
   mineralization and N-release patterns, (2) evaluate the N release
   patterns of mixtures of low and high quality organic materials and
   synchrony with maize uptake. Incubation studies were established for 12
   weeks using six selected plant residues: which included Leucaena
   leucocephala, Croton macrostachyus, Calliandra calothyrsus, Tithonia
   diversifolia, Sorghum bicolor and rice (Oryza sativa) husks. Soil
   samples were taken at 2 weeks interval for ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N)
   and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) determination.
   The organic residues differed in their chemical composition and this was
   found to influence mineralization rates and nitrogen release patterns.
   Two distinctive NO3--N + NH4+N release patterns were observed over the
   incubation period. L. leucocephala, C. macrostachyus, C. calothyrsus, T
   diversifolia had a net N release throughout while S. bicolor and rice
   husks (O. sativa) had a significant N immobilization. Nitrogen-release
   was best correlated with ON ratio (r(2)= -0.84 to -0.90) for most of the
   sampling periods. Polyphenol:N ratio also had a significantly high
   correlation with cumulative N mineralized (r(2) = -0.65 to -0.95).
   Two organic resource with contrasting C:N and PP:N ratios i.e. C.
   macrostachyus and O. sativa were selected for use and in depth effect of
   mixing high quality C. macrostachyus (Cm) and low quality O. sativa (Os)
   at different ratios on mineralization N release patterns. Agronomic
   effectiveness of the best mixture, which was based on N release, was
   measured using maize as the test crop in a glasshouse experiment. The
   dynamics of N-mineralization of the various mixture of C. macrostachyus
   (Cm) and O. sativa (Os) were in general not significantly different from
   those predicted from the O. sativa and C. macrostachyus treatments alone
   with the exception of the 3/4 Cm + 1/4 Os which gave significant N
   immobilization at 6-8 weeks and the 1/4 Cm + 3/4 Os which enhanced N
   mineralization at 2 and 12 weeks respectively. Addition of plant
   residues significantly increased maize biomass in the glasshouse with
   potted mixtures of plant residues giving the highest maize dry matter
   yield and N uptake.},

Abstract = {Slow establishment of green barriers together with competition for
   nutrients and water between crops and contour hedges hamper their
   acceptance by rural communities in tropical mountainous regions.
   Alternatively, a combination of hedges/barriers and minimum tillage may
   shift the pathway of N losses from water erosion towards leaching. In
   Northeast Thailand, run-off, soil loss, N leaching (by resin cores) and
   crop response were monitored in grass barriers (Vetiveria zizanioides,
   Brachiaria ruziziensis) and hedgerow (Leucaena leucocephala) based soil
   conservation systems in fertilized/unfertilized treatments from their
   establishment in 2003 to 2005. In all treatments, maize was grown on a
   moderate slope gradient (21-28\%) under minimum tillage conditions and
   relay cropped with a legume cover crop (Canavalia ensiformis). After 3
   years, maize grain yields increased from 1.5 and 3.2 to 3.8 and 5.5 Mg
   ha(-1) in the unfertilized and fertilized control plots. Over the same
   period, yield increases were lower for soil conservation treatments
   reaching yields of 2.0-2.7 Mg ha(-1) without fertilizer and 3.9-4.2 Mg
   ha(-1) with fertilizer. After 3 years, runoff (190-264 m(3) ha(-1)) and
   soil loss (0.2-1 Mg ha(-1)) in fertilized plots with barriers showed an
   average decrease of 72\% and 98\%, respectively, compared to 2003, the
   reduction being lower in unfertilized plots. The control had a much
   higher soil loss in the first year (24.5 Mg ha(-1)), but also showed
   much reduced erosion (1.6-2.5 Mg ha(-1)) in the third year, partly due
   to reduced rainfall but also due to the combined effects of minimum
   tillage and surface mulch. Runoff, however, did not decrease on the
   control plots over the years in the same way as it did under soil
   conservation (runoff only after >12 mm day(-1)). Average cumulative N
   losses by runoff, soil loss and leaching were reduced from 55 kg N
   ha(-1) in the control to 37-40 kg N ha(-1) in the barrier treatments.
   The dominant N loss pathway shifted from above ground N losses to
   leaching with the establishment of barriers and hedges. Due to the
   positive maize yield development and partial control of soil loss,
   minimum tillage combined with legume relay cropping under the trial
   conditions indicates a potential alternative to contour barrier/hedge
   row systems for soil conservation on moderate slopes in tropical
   mountainous regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Hedgerow or alley cropping is being advocated for sustainable land
   productivity and improved soil health in the developing world. The
   suitable food-fodder species grown on bed and furrow system with soil
   moisture conservation practices need to be adopted for the success of
   alley cropping under rainfed semi-arid region. A field experiment was
   conducted during 2013-2016 to assess different food-fodder based alley
   cropping systems with resource conservation practices (RCP) for
   enhancing productivity, economic returns and energetics. The perennial
   Pennisetum tri-specific hybrid (TSH) grass and legume shrubs were
   planted on a raised bed of 1.5 m wide. One row of shrub was planted in
   the middle of the bed along with two rows of TSH grass on both side of
   the shrub row. The seasonal crops were grown in furrow (2.2 m) placed
   between two beds (1.5 m). In RCP, one supplement irrigation treatments
   to crops were given i.e. one pre-sowing irrigation (rabi) + other
   irrigation as per theoretical calculation i.e. 30\% of total rainfall-ET
   losses. In-situ moisture conservation practices include residue
   retention (stubble height 15 cm + mulching (green weed biomass +
   litterfall) in furrows. The result indicates that among woody
   perennials, Sesbania sesban as a hedgerow was superior to Desmanthus
   virgatus but found at par with Leucaena leucocephala in terms of DM
   production. Furthermore, TSH grass grown on the side of woody legumes
   produced about 15-20 Mg DM ha(-1) across the treatment per year. The
   grain yield of the annual crops was in the order of barley > chickpea >
   pigeonpea across the years and not significantly influenced by perennial
   components. The highest system productivity (112.2 Mg ha(-1)) was found
   under TSH + S. sesban + (sorghum + cowpea-barley) cropping systems
   leading to higher net monetary returns (US\$ 1430 ha(-1)). While alley
   cropping with sorghum + pigeonpea was the lowest yielder. Among resource
   conservation practices, one supplement irrigation and in-situ soil
   moisture conservation treatments were comparable and produced about
   12-14\% higher yield than control. The TSH + S. sesban + (sorghum +
   cowpea-barley) cropping system accumulated highest bio-energy (497 GJ
   ha(-1)) but maximum value of energy use efficiency was computed in TSH +
   Sesbania + (sorghum + pigeonpea). The soil organic carbon was enhanced
   substantially under 4 years of hedgerow systems over antecedent level.
   Findings of this study suggest that TSH + S. sesban hedgerow system
   grown in bed with seasonal crops (sorghum + cowpea-chickpea) in furrow
   could improve food and fodder production, ensure green fodder
   availability during dry season and sustain natural resources in rainfed
   semi-arid agro-ecologies.},

Title = {The non-flavonoid inducible nodA3 and the flavonoid regulated
   nodA1 genes of Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 guarantee nod
   factor production and nodulation of different host legumes},

Abstract = {Aims The symbiosis between rhizobia and their host legumes is initiated
   by a complex molecular dialogue in which the activation of bacterial
   NodD proteins by appropriate plant flavonoids triggers the expression of
   the bacterial nodulation (nod) genes. These genes are involved in the
   synthesis and export of the Nodulation factors (NF), which are signal
   molecules that, when recognized by plant receptors, launch the symbiotic
   process. The core of NF is synthesized by proteins encoded by the nodABC
   genes, whereas the rest of the nod genes protein products are involved
   in the decoration of NF with different chemical substituents and their
   export to the environment. Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899, the microsymbiont
   of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), is characterized for tolerating
   multiple physical stresses and for synthesizing a large variety of NF
   not only in the presence of inducing flavonoids but also when high
   concentrations of salt are present. In addition, another interesting
   feature of the R. tropici CIAT 899 genome is the presence of three
   different nodA genes on the symbiotic plasmid, although their exact
   roles remain to be elucidated. In this work, we characterize the role of
   the three NodA proteins of R. tropici CIAT 899 in symbiosis.
   Methods We have analyzed by quantitative PCR the expression of the
   nodA1, nodA2 and nodA3 genes of CIAT 899, showing that only nodA1 and
   nodA2 are inducible by flavonoids. We have also constructed single,
   double and triple non-polar mutants in these genes in order to study
   their importance in NF production and in nodulation of four different
   host legumes of CIAT 899: P. vulgaris, Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus
   japonicus, and L. burttii.
   Results The nodA1 and nodA2 genes of CIAT 899 (both inducible by
   flavonoids) are more related between them than with nodA3 (non-flavonoid
   inducible). Interestingly, the presence of NodA1 or NodA3 is crucial for
   nodulation with L. leucocephala and L. japonicus, since both NodA1 or
   NodA3 guarantee Nod factor production upon apigenin induction.
   Interestingly, osmotic-stressing conditions increase the quantity and
   diversity of the Nod factors synthesized by NodA2, being these molecules
   able to induce the formation of nodule primordia on P. vulgaris.
   Conclusions We concluded that R. tropici CIAT 899 requires at least the
   flavonoid-induced nodA1 or the flavonoid-independent nodA3 genes for
   ensuring symbiotic success in the four assayed host-legumes. The
   inducible nodA2 gene is sufficient to induce nodulation on P. vulgaris
   and L. burttii but not in L. leucocephala and L. japonicus. To our
   knowledge, in this work we report for the first time that a
   non-flavonoid inducible copy of nodA is enough to induce nodulation on
   legumes.},

Abstract = {The rate of adoption of leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala)-grass pastures
   is rising rapidly in northern Australia as graziers realise the extent
   of the triple-bottom-line benefits. Leucaena pastures are suited to >13
   M ha of Queensland, with a current estimated 150 000 ha producing 37 500
   kg of liveweight gain valued at >\$69 M each year. Despite high costs of
   establishment, this area is expected to expand to 300 000-500 000 ha by
   2017. The main factor driving high levels of adoption is the ability of
   leucaena pastures to meet graziers' needs for a highly productive and
   profitable system that meets market requirements for grass-fed beef of
   superior quality. Production benefits include: increased animal
   production/ ha (up to 4-fold) resulting from a combination of greater
   animal liveweight gains and increased carrying capacity; longevity
   (30-40 yr); and potential to intensify production within the constraints
   of recent changes to the Queensland Vegetation Management Act and
   escalating land prices. Other benefits are: increased marketing
   flexibility; superior capital appreciation of leucaena pastures, and
   positive animal welfare outcomes.
   Social factors are also important, with many farmers converting marginal
   dryland cropping cultivation to leucaena pasture owing to concerns about
   the impact of drought, global warming, and decreased profitability and
   sustainability of dryland farming. Importantly, technical information
   regarding the establishment and management of leucaena pastures is now
   available to graziers, giving them the confidence to adopt the
   technology.
   Environmental benefits include: dryland salinity mitigation; soil
   erosion control and improved water quality; improved soil fertility
   through biological nitrogen fixation; and greenhouse gas mitigation.
   Given an average season, existing leucaena pastures fix approximately
   7500 t N and reduce cattle methane emissions by approximately 91 000 t
   carbon dioxide equivalent carbon (C0(2)-e) annually. These pastures also
   have the potential to sequester >4 M t of CO2-e. However, leucaena is an
   environmental weed in northern Australia, largely as a result of its
   historical introduction and use as an ornamental and for slope
   stabilisation. While most current weed infestations are not due to
   grazier plantings, a voluntary Code of Practice, where graziers take
   responsibility for any spread from their properties, has been developed
   to limit seed production and dispersal. Soil acidification will not be a
   problem on the alkaline clay soils (high pH buffering capacity) in
   Queensland where most leucaena pastures are planted. There is need for
   greater factual appreciation of the environmental aspects of large-scale
   leucaena plantings, and for a thorough cost:benefit analysis to be
   conducted.},

Abstract = {Agriculture produces an estimated 14.5\% of global anthropogenic
   greenhouse gases, with livestock emissions being the largest source of
   enteric methane. Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production
   and processing of beef cattle will become increasingly important with
   time, particularly in line with global efforts to mitigate rising GHG
   emissions. The present study compared several GHG emission scenarios
   from beef cattle grazing on irrigated Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de
   Wit cv. Cunningham (leucaena) in Queensland, Australia. Animals began
   grazing the leucaena paddocks when they were 16 months old and continued
   until similar to 240 days, before being sold to market. Three scenarios
   were modelled with cattle grazing leucaena and the resulting GHG
   emissions calculated, representing (1) the current leucaena paddock
   (current leucaena scenario), (2) clearing native vegetation and
   extending the leucaena paddock (extended leucaena scenario) and (3)
   extending the leucaena paddock onto previously cleared paddocks
   (alternative leucaena scenario). These were compared with a pre-scenario
   baseline, where the steers grazed on native vegetation until the time of
   sale. Herd GHG emission intensities (EI) were reduced in comparison with
   the baseline (EI of 8.4 tCO(2)-e/t liveweight sold) for all the leucaena
   scenarios, where reductions were modelled for the current, extended and
   alternative leucaena scenarios, which had an EI of 3.9, 3.7 and 3.6
   tCO(2)-e/ t liveweight sold, respectively. Reductions were attributed to
   the higher growth rates of the steers on leucaena and the
   anti-methanogenic potential of leucaena. Where leucaena was planted on
   previously cleared paddocks, carbon stocks (t C/ha) nearly doubled a
   decade following planting, with most carbon sequestered in the soil.
   However, total carbon stocks on the property reduced over the modelled
   period (112 years), where native vegetation, e.g. eucalyptus woodland,
   was cleared for leucaena planting, but soil carbon yield increased. The
   combined sequestration of leucaena and the reduction of GHG emission
   intensities resulted in overall net reductions of GHG emissions for the
   three leucaena scenarios compared with the baseline. These results
   demonstrated that the use of leucaena for grazing can be an effective
   means for farmers to reduce the GHG emissions and increase productivity
   of their herds. The study also demonstrated that it would take 9 years
   of reduced emissions to compensate for the carbon lost as emissions from
   clearing the eucalyptus woodland, suggesting that farmers should use
   other methods of intensifying production from existing leucaena paddocks
   if their sole purpose is short-term emissions abatement.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion, a serious problem in Submontane Punjab, India, has been
   intensively studied by a number of investigators. Various soil
   management practices, such as the use of diverse crops, strip cropping,
   increasing crop cover, multiple cropping, agroforestry, mulching,
   conservation tillage, ridging, and furrowing have decreased erosion.
   Maize at a spacing of 60 cm x 22.5 cm showed minimum soil loss by
   runoff. Crops with erect growth and limited tilling allowed for high
   runoff and soil loss. The intercropping of groundnut with maize gave the
   highest net return with the least amount of soil loss by erosion; maize
   with urd (Vigna mungo L.) gave the second highest net return with the
   least amount of soil loss by erosion. Maize and guar (Cyamopsis
   tetragonoloba L.) in alternating strips of 9-m width showed minimal
   runoff (9\%) and soil loss (3.3 Mg ha-1). The agroforestry practice of
   growing Leucaena leucocephala Lam. intercropped with maize, guar, or urd
   also was effective in reducing runoff and soil loss; the yield was
   reduced for maize by 34\%, urd by 27\%, and guar by 21\% as compared to
   pure crop but compensated by a relatively higher yield of fodder and
   fuel from L. leucocephala. The application of 4 Mg ha-1 of mulch
   decreased runoff by 57.6\%, soil loss by 71.7\%, and nutrient loss by
   60\% and increased the yield of maize. Deep tillage increased
   infiltration and decreased run-off and soil loss. A combination of mulch
   and tillage further reduced soil losses. Contour cultivation reduced
   soil loss from 6.3 Mg ha-1 to 2.9 Mg ha-1 as compared to slope
   cultivation. Ridging and furrowing at sowing was most effective in
   controlling soil loss (0.3 Mg ha 1); ridging and furrowing 30 days after
   sowing was the second most effective way to control soil loss (1.6 Mg
   soil loss ha-1). On sloping lands contour bunding (embankments)
   decreased soil loss from 2.56 Mg ha-1 to 0.59 Mg ha-1 and increased
   wheat yields above 20\%. Bench terracing proved to be more suitable for
   land with slopes between 6-33\%. Structures such as waterways, drop
   structures, and control dams reduced sheet, rill, and gully erosion from
   80\%, 11\%, and 3.6\% to 15\%, 2\%, and nil, respectively. The goal of
   control practices has been to mitigate erosive capacity of rainfall by
   integrated management of crop, soil, and runoff and thus to decrease the
   soil and nutrient loss from arable soils to tolerable limits.},

Abstract = {Chemical composition, microbial rumen fermentation, energetic values and
   degradation of some Saudi Arabia sub-tropical browses were investigated
   in comparison with alfalfa hay as a high quality roughage using
   Hohenheim gas test in vitro. A gas test technique was performed using
   buffered rumen fluid collected from three rumen fistulated sheep.
   Cumulative gas production was recorded at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96
   h of incubation in vitro. The investigated sub-tropical plants were blue
   panic (Panicum antidotale), moringa (Moringa peregrina), leucaena
   (Leucaena leucocephala). prosopis (Prosopis juliflora), casuarina
   (Casuarina glauca) and acacia (Acacia saligna). The sub-tropical plants
   were collected at the dry season in Saudi Arabia. Alfalfa and leucaena
   plants had the highest crude protein (CP) content, while the blue panic
   and moringa had the lowest value. The ether extract (EE) content of
   moringa and casuarina plants was 5.4 and 3.0\%, respectively. The
   neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADP) were higher
   in blue panic, acacia and moringa, while the prosopis and casuarina
   plants showed the lowest content of the fiber constituents. The
   secondary compounds analysis showed negligible contents of these feeds
   for total phenol (TP), total tannins (TT) and condensed tannins (CT)
   except moringa plant. The potential gas production was highest (p<0.05)
   for prosopis, alfalfa and blue panic plants, while the moringa plant
   recorded the lowest gas production. Leucaena, casuarina and moringa
   plants had the longest lag time (L, h(-1)) and lowest rate of gas
   production (mu h(-1)). The longest L value (2.339 and 1.95 h(-1)) was
   noted with leucaena and casuarina plants, while prosopis plant showed
   the short L value (0.617 h(-1)). There were wide variations among
   investigated plants in rumen fermentation characteristics, degradation
   and energetic values. The ranking order of the investigated plants on
   the basis of their true degradation of dry and organic matter was
   prosopis>leucaena>casuarina>blue panic>moringa>acacia. Concentration of
   NH3-N was high (p<0.05) in prosopis, blue panic and alfalfa hay, while
   in moringa plant appeared the low concentration (26.0 mg/100 g buffered
   rumen fluid) of NH3-N. The prosopis showed the highest (p<0.05) volatile
   fatty acids concentration. In conclusion, significant variations in in
   vitro fermentation and degradation were observed among different browse
   species collected from Saudia Arabia through the dry season. The results
   suggest that prosopis, leucaena and blue panic plants might be promising
   alternative feed resources and it could be incorporated in ruminants
   feed mixtures to replace conventional roughage sources (alfalfa) without
   major problems.},

Abstract = {Twenty-four Mesorhizobium strains were isolated from desert soils in the
   Xinjiang region of China and were characterized by a polyphasic
   approach. These strains grouped into three clusters in IGS-RFLP,
   SDS-PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins and BOX-PCR analysis,
   corresponding to genomic species V, VI and VII as found in a previous
   study. The results were supported by sequencing analyses of rrs, IGS,
   atpD and recA genes. Genospecies VII was most related to Mesorhizobium
   septentrionale, while genospecies V and VI were both most closely
   related to Mesorhizobium tianshanense, but were distinct from each other
   and from M. tianshanense. The DNA-DNA hybridization value between the
   representative strain CCBAU 83284 (genospecies VII) and the type strain
   of M. septentrionale was 90.1 \%. Genospecies VII was thus defined as M.
   septentrionale. The DNA-DNA relatedness value for representative strains
   of genospecies V or VI with the related reference strains of recognized
   species were always lower than 60 \%. Low values of DNA-DNA
   hybridization (32.79 \%) between representative strains of genospecies V
   (CCBAU 83330(T)) and of VI (CCBAU 83306(T)) were also observed. Based
   upon these results, two novel species are proposed: Mesorhizobium
   gobiense sp. nov. represented by genospecies V (type strain, CCBAU
   83330(T) = LMG 23949(T) = HAMBI 2974(T)) and Mesorhizobium tarimense sp.
   nov. represented by genospecies VI (type strain, CCBAU 83306(T) = LMG
   24338(T) = HAMBI 2973(T)). Strain CCBAU 83278 grouped as the most
   peripheral member with genospecies VI in SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins
   and BOX-PCR analysis and in the phylogenetic tree of 16S-23S rRNA
   intergenic spacer (IGS) sequences. The results of analyses of rrs, atpD
   and recA gene sequences, as well as those of DNA-DNA hybridization
   studies, strongly supported the suggestion that this strain belonged to
   a species quite different from genospecies V and VI and from any other
   recognized species of the genus Mesorhizobium. As only one strain has
   been isolated to date, strain CCBAU 83278 was not proposed as a novel
   species in this study. Mesorhizabium gobiense sp. nov. and Mesorhizobium
   tarimense sp. nov. could be differentiated from each other as well as
   from recognized species of the genus Mesorhizobium on the basis of
   phenotypic characteristics. The symbiotic loci (nodC and nifH) of the
   two novel species formed two phylogenetic branches related to
   Mesorhizobium loti and M. tianshanense. The type strains of the two
   novel species were able to nodulate Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Lotus
   corniculatus, Oxytropis glabra and Robinia pseudoacacia but not
   Astragalus membranaceus, Leucaena leucocephala, Phaseolus vulgaris,
   Pisum sativum or Medicago sativa.},

Abstract = {Environmental degradation resulting from current climate changes,
   including prolonged drought, land degradation, desertification, and loss
   of biodiversity, is presenting enormous challenges to achieve food
   security and eradication of poverty in the marginal regions (about 90\%
   of the total area) of Egypt. In addition to the natural constraints of
   high temperature, wind erosion, sand dune movement, and recurrent
   drought, such regions are subjected to improper land and water
   management. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge, technologies, and
   experiences to match with the current severe climatic changes. There is
   a great need for establishing sustainable integrated ecosystem
   rehabilitation and management programs to overcome such problems in the
   marginal areas, particularly in the Sinai Peninsula due to its strategic
   and social importance. A series of research and development programs
   have been conducted in 2006 to improve the livelihoods of smallholders
   through enhancing the efficient management and utilization of local
   resources that can cope with the drastic changes of climate in the Sinai
   Peninsula. An integrated livestock/salt-tolerant fodder crop system was
   introduced, in 2010 by the project teamwork of Desert Research center,
   Egypt, to many smallholders in the South Sinai region, where studies
   were conducted at both the general research and individual farmer
   levels. The most important results were: (1) adoption of the most
   salt-tolerant genotypes of three forage crops: pearl millet (Pennisetum
   glaucum L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and Sudan grass (Sorghum
   sudanense (Piper) Stapf.); two cereal crops (triticale and barley); and
   two oil crops: safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) and Brassica (Mustard).
   Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. and Medicago arborium), cowpeas (Vigna
   sinensis L.), fodder beets (Beta vulgaris L.), clumping desert
   bunchgrass (Panicum turgedum), ryegrass (Lolium perenne) Ray grass,
   forage shrubs (Kochia indica, Atriplex nummularia, Sesbania sesban L.),
   and Acacia cyanophila, Leucaena leucocephala, Porsopis cheilanses, and
   Prosopis jioflora were also evaluated; (2) active participation of
   farmers in development of management strategies to improve irrigation
   water use efficiency, forage production, and livestock production; and
   (3) economic evaluation at the farmer level, which showed that feeding
   livestock salt-tolerant fodders produced an increase of about 60\% in
   milk production and 80\% in meat production, and reduced feed costs by
   about 40\%. Accordingly, a 70\% increase of family income was achieved.
   It is concluded that better utilization of fragile ecosystem resources
   and growing salt-tolerant fodder crops may contribute to the development
   of marginal areas and enhance the living standards of local people
   through providing high-quality livestock feed materials and producing
   economical animal products.},

Abstract = {Lectins are plant secondary metabolites (PSM) found in many forages and
   which may confer anthelmintic properties to gastrointestinal parasites
   through disrupting the development of parasitic larvae throughout its
   life cycle. In experiment 1, the ability of the plant lectins jacalin
   (JAC), concanavalin A (Con A), phytohemagglutinin E2L2 (PHA-E2L2),
   phytohemagglutinin L4 (PHA-L4), phytohemagglutinin E3L (PHA-E3L), kidney
   bean albumin (KBA), Robinia pseudoacacia agglutinin (RPA), Maackia
   amurensis lectin (MAA), Maclura pomifera agglutinin (MAA), Dolichos
   biflorus agglutinin (DBA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and Galanthus
   nivalis agglutinin (GNA) to disrupt the feeding of the first stage
   larvae (L-1) of the sheep gastro-intestinal nematodes (GIN) Teladorsagia
   circumcincta, Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis
   was investigated using a larval feeding inhibition test (LFIT). Only
   PHA-E3L, WGA and Con A had a potent effect on disrupting larval feeding
   of all of the three species of GIN investigated. The lectin
   concentration required to inhibit feeding in 50\% of L1 (IC50) was 7.3
   +/- 1.2, 8.3 +/- 1.4 and 4.3 +/- 1.7 mu g/ml for PHA-E3L; 59.1 +/- 32.4,
   58.7 +/- 11.9 and 8.1 +/- 7.0 mu g/ml for Con A and 78.9 +/- 11.2, 69.4
   +/- 8.1 and 28.0 +/- 14.1 mu g/ml for WGA for T. circumcincta, H.
   contortus and T. colubriformis larvae, respectively (P = 0.006). The
   addition of the lectin inhibitors fetuin, glucose/mannose or
   N-acetylglucosamine for PHA-E3L, Con A and WGA, respectively, caused an
   increase in the proportion of larvae that had fed at all concentrations
   for PHA-E3L only. In experiment 2, the effect of extracts from the
   tropical plants Azadiractha indica, Trichanthera gigantea, Morus alba,
   Gliricidia sepium and Leucaena leucocephala on the feeding behaviour of
   H. contortus L-1, was examined. A. indica, T. gigantea and M. alba
   failed to inhibit 50\% of larvae from feeding at concentrations up to 10
   mg plant extract per ml. In contrast, both G. sepium and L leucocephala
   demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on larval feeding with respective
   IC50 estimates (mean +/- s.e.) of 0.015 mg/ml +/- 0.001 and 3.465 mg/ml
   +/- 0.144, effects which were partly reversed by the inclusion of either
   the tannin inhibitor polyethylene glycol or the lectin inhibitor Fetuin.
   These studies demonstrate that plant lectins can have an inhibitory
   effect on the feeding behaviour of first stage larvae of ovine GIN in
   vitro. Moreover they also provide novel evidence that lectins may
   contribute to the anthelmintic properties of some tropical forage plant
   extracts, such as G. sepium and L leucocephala. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Year = {2016},
Volume = {184},
Pages = {64-70},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to establish a database on nutrients and
   mineral profile, in vitro dry matter digestibility (DMD) and in situ
   ruminal degradability characteristics of leaves from 21 fodder tree
   species commonly fed to livestock in semi-arid and arid zones of
   Northern Pakistan. Leaves from 13 fodder tree species: Albizia lebbeck,
   Ailanthus altissima, Bauhinia variegata, Butea frondosa, Celtis
   australis, Ficus carica, Grewia oppositifolia, Leucaena leucocephala,
   Mallotus philippensis, Melia azedarach, Morus alba, Morus papyrifera and
   Ziziphus mauritiana were sampled from semi-arid zone. Leaves from 8
   fodder tree species: Acacia modesta, A. lebbeck, Capparis aphylla, Olea
   cuspidata, Prosopis juliflora, Tecomella undulata, Ziziphus jujuba and
   Ziziphus mauritiana were sampled from arid zone. Within each ecological
   zone, leaves of each tree species were collected at four sub-locations,
   from three randomly selected trees. The results showed a large variation
   in the concentration of all measured chemical components, DMD and
   ruminal degradation characteristics among the tree species. The contents
   of crude protein (CP) varied from 8.76\% (T.undulata) to 24.0\% (M.
   alba); ash from 7.41\% (0. cuspidata) to 22.4\% (C australis); and
   neutral detergent fibre from 20.6 (L leucocephala) to 56.5\% (C
   aphylla). Except for T. undulata, leaves from all tree species had CP
   content of > 10\%, and 60\% of the species had leaves with > 15\% CP,
   demonstrating that leaves from majority of tree species can be used as
   low-cost CP supplement. The mineral composition revealed that, except
   for C. aphylla, leaves from all tree species were rich sources of Ca,
   whilst most of the species were deficient in P, Na and Cu. The DMD of
   the majority (66\%) of tree leaves were < 50.0\%, ranging from 33.1\%
   (M. philippensis) to 67.6\% (M. alba). The in situ data further showed
   that a large fraction of ruminal degradable dry matter was
   instantaneously degraded (soluble). The potentially rumen degradable (D)
   fraction and rate of degradation (kd) was highly variable, ranging from
   0.234 to 0.958 and 0.026 to 0.99/h, respectively. The effective ruminal
   dry matter degradability (EDDM) was higher than the in vitro DMD,
   ranging from 0.34 to 0.84, at an outflow rate of 0.05/h. This
   information on nutrients and mineral profile, in vitro DMD and in situ
   ruminal degradability characteristics of leaves from 21 fodder tree
   species, obtained under well replicated and uniform experimental
   conditions can be used to optimize diet formulation in terms of
   nutrients supply to the animals that will ensure better utilization of
   this nutrients-rich feed resource and will increase economic
   profitability of subsistence livestock farmers in the region. (C) 2015

Title = {A note on dehorning of river buffaloes as an alternative for decreasing
   the deterioration of live fences and trees},
Journal = {CUBAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {38},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Twenty-nine female buffaloes with horns and 25 dehorned were used at
   seven days of age. Both groups were allocated in different grasslands
   with perimetral live fences and access to lead trees (Leucaena
   leucocephala) for comparing the effect of dehorning on the decrease of
   plant deterioration. A total of 208 plants was evaluated, out of which
   131 were used as live fences in both grasslands (65 in the grassland
   with females buffaloes with horns and the rest in that of dehorned). At
   the beginning, the number of live fences and trees, the diameter of the
   stems at their base (at 15 cm of height, approximately) and the number
   of plants per species were measured. A year later, the effect of
   dehorning was assessed in these categories. Partial damages were those
   produced in any part of the stem that caused damages to the bark and not
   the death of the plant. Total damages were those that caused the death
   of the plants. An analysis of proportions of the damages caused to live
   fences and trees was made to compare the effects produced. A reduction
   (P < 0.001) of the level of both damages to live fences and the partial
   damages to the trees was observed, while the level of total damages to
   the trees was lower (P < 0.05) in the group of dehorned animals. In the
   group of animals with horns, 98.5 and 100 \% of the live fences and
   trees were damaged, while, in that of dehorned animals, the damages were
   reduced to 4.1 and 1.9 \%, respectively, and all were partial. Out of
   the lesions caused to live fences by the animals with horns, the highest
   proportion (57.3 \%) provoked the death of the plants, but in the trees,
   most of damages (91 \%) were partial. They were higher in 8.3 and 9.2 \%
   in the live fences of Nicaraguan cocoashade (Gliricidia sepium),
   compared to West Indian birch (Bursera simaruba) and pito (Erythrina
   berteroana), respectively; while the total damages were higher in 4.2
   and 8.3 percental units in West Indian birch and pito, compared to
   Nicaraguan cocoashade. The greatest damage provoked by the horns was
   observed in the plants with diameter lower than 7 cm. This caused the
   death of the plant in 100 \% of the live fences and trees. Also, 16.7 \%
   of the total damages in live fences were found with diameter in the stem
   from 7 to 10 cm. The rest of the partial damages occurred in the stems
   of greater diameter. It is concluded that the horns of the buffaloes
   seem to produce great deterioration in live fences and trees, mainly in
   those with stems of lower diameter. For reducing such damages, dehorning
   is suggested, as well as the use of these plants of diameter higher than
   7 cm.},

Title = {Local knowledge regarding ecosystem services and disservices from
   invasive alien plants in the arid Kalahari, South Africa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {159},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {22-33},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Across the globe, many invasive alien plants were purposefully
   introduced because of their usefulness. These plants continue to provide
   multiple goods and services, such as fodder, fuelwood, medicines,
   fruits, shade and aesthetic appeal. However, as they invade negative
   impacts arise. This often leads to conflicts of interests and trade-offs
   between the benefits and costs of these species and, ultimately, the
   environment and local livelihoods. Traditionally, invasive plant species
   research in dryland systems has tended to focus on the impacts of these
   species on large-scale natural systems, primarily rangelands and river
   courses. Limited work has been undertaken regarding the role of these
   species in providing services and disservices within homesteads and
   settlements in these harsh environments. Such knowledge is important
   with regards to management. The primary aim of this study was therefore
   to assess the assimilation of invasive plant species into the lives of
   households in several small farming settlements in the arid Kalahari
   region of the Northern Cape, South Africa. Specific objectives were to:
   1) assess the diversity, prevalence and size structure of invasive
   plants in resident's homesteads; 2) identify sources, local practices,
   knowledge and beliefs related to the invasive plants present as well as
   local management practices; and 3) understand residents' perceptions of
   the ecosystem services and disservices these species deliver. To do
   this, we used household and `drive-past' surveys, in-depth interviews
   and measurement of plants in homesteads. From the `drive-past' survey,
   we identified 12 officially listed and one proposed invasive plant
   species in the settlements, 10 of which were covered in the household
   survey. Eight native tree species were also present, but these were at
   much lower frequency and density than introduced species. Thirteen
   different goods and services from the invasive plants were recognised
   with the most common being shade, aesthetics and fuelwood. Some species,
   such as Morus alba and Opuntia ficus-indica, were important for fruit,
   while eight species were mentioned as being used for fodder. Respondents
   also mentioned that O. ficus-indica, Prosopis spp., Leucaena
   leucocephala and Melia azedarach imposed costs. These disservices
   included reductions in water supply, damage to buildings and human
   health impacts. Some of these species were also perceived to be
   spreading beyond homesteads in some settlements and invading rangeland.
   Less than a quarter of households had no invasive plants in their yards,
   and these were mainly new dwellings in the growing informal areas around
   the settlements. Invasive plants were obtained from variety of sources
   suggesting various pathways of introduction. We conclude by discussing
   some options for management focusing on Prosopis, as the invasive plant
   perceived to most rapidly expanding and generating the most disservices.
   We also highlight what further research is needed with regard to filling
   research gaps on invasive plant species within social-ecological systems
   in arid areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Traditional weed control practices in Mexico use legumes as cover crops
   or manures. Legumes used in these practices play a dual role in
   agroecosystems by protecting the soil from erosion and by enriching it
   with organic matter and N through Rhizobium symbiosis. Farmers in the
   tropical regions of Mexico use Mucuna spp., Canavalia spp. and other
   legumes to control weeds in their fields. We conducted in vitro
   bioassays and greenhouse experiments to evaluate the toxic effect of
   four legumes velvetbean {[}Mucuna deeringiana (Bort) Merr.], jackbean
   {[}Canavalia ensiformis (L.) DC.], jumbiebean {[}Leucaena leucocephala
   (Lam.) de Wit], and wild tamarind {[}Lysiloma latisiliquum (L.) Benth.]
   on weed growth, and on the survival of insects and nematodes. The
   aqueous leachates (1\%) of the four legumes were tested on three test
   plants by seed germination and radicle growth bioassays in petri dishes.
   The aqueous leachates of all four legumes exhibited strong phytotoxic
   effect on the radicle growth of the test plants. The effects of
   velvetbean and jackbean leachates were also evaluated on the survival of
   phytopathogenic nematodes. Both leachates had nematotoxic effects.
   Greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of the four
   legumes dried leaves incorporated as mulches to potting soil, on the
   number and biomass of weeds, and on the biomass of tomato (Lycopersicon
   esculentum L.) plants. The decomposition of velvetbean and jackbean
   leaves in potting soil significantly reduced (>50\%) the development of
   phytopathogenic nematodes in the roots of tomato. A 5-yr field
   experiment conducted at the University of Yucatan (UADY) evaluated the
   effect of velvetbean and jackbean used as living cover crops, and
   jumbiebean and wild tamarind used as dead mulches incorporated on soil
   surface, on weed growth, and corn (Zea mays L.) yield. The experimental
   field was treated with the traditional slash and burn system in February
   1994. In July 1994 the experiment was performed using the local
   agricultural practices in a complete randomized block design with three
   repetitions. The treatments were: corn + velvetbean, corn + jackbean,
   corn + jumbiebean, corn + wild tamarind, corn + Paraquat
   (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium ion) herbicide, corn weeded by hand,
   and plots without corn weeded by hand. The number, biomass, diversity,
   and relative importance of weeds, as well as corn yield, were evaluated.
   In addition, taxonomic composition of weeds was determined. All legumes
   reduced weed growth with velvetbean (as living cover crop) producing the
   largest weed biomass reduction (68\%). These legumes also improved the
   yield of corn during the first 2 yr of the experiment. For better
   management of natural resources, the use of legumes as biological tools
   in agriculture to control weeds and improve soil conditions should be
   encouraged through coordinated efforts between farmers, academic, and
   governmental institutions.},

Abstract = {Palatability indices of dry and wilted 18 multipurpose tree species
   (MPTs) were determined using 12 wethers and 12 bucks (mean +/- SD
   liveweight 17.5 +/- 1.24 kg and 20.5 +/- 1.46 kg, respectively), blocked
   into two groups on liveweight and age, housed in a roofed and
   half-walled shed with individual feeding pens. The 18 MPTs were randomly
   grouped into sets of six by form (dried and wilted), such that each
   animal received three samples of each form. Each animal received 0.5 kg
   teff straw (Eragrostis tef) in addition to 0.4 kg and 0.2 kg of the
   wilted and dry forms of the appropriate MPTs, respectively, daily at
   08:00 h over a 12-day experimental period. Dry matter intake of MPTs on
   day 1 (A(1)), average intakes on days 2-4 (A(2)), days 5-8 (A(3)), days
   9-12 (A(4)) and days 2-12 (A(5)) were compared. A significant (P <
   0.0001) decrease in intake, with correlation coefficients of r = 0.92
   (A(1) and A(2)), r = 0.88 (A(1) and A(5)) and r = 0.85 (A(1) and A(3))
   in sheep, was observed. A similar trend was observed for palatability
   indices R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4. A close relationship was observed between
   R-2 and R-5 (r = 0.91), R-3 and R-5 (r = 0.97), and R-4 and R-5 (r =
   0.94). R-1 was poorly correlated with R-5 (r = 0.61). The same trend was
   found in goats. Linear regressions of A(5) on A(1), A(5) on A(2), A(5)
   on A(3) and A(5) on A(4) (adj. r(2) = 0.81, 0.95, 0.97, 0.94 and r(2) =
   0.64, 0.90, 0.97, 0.94 in sheep and goats, respectively) showed that the
   best relationship existed between A(5) and A(3). The results of analysis
   of variance for palatability index R-5 showed that the palatability
   index significantly (P < 0.001) depended on previous clustering and
   animal species. The cluster means for R-5 were 1.34, 1.02, 0.68 and 0.54
   for clusters 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. However, the palatability
   indices for goats were more than double those for sheep (1.33 vs. 0.48).
   There were no significant interaction effects for cluster, form and
   animal species. In this study the form of feed (wilted or dry) did not
   affect the palatability index. Acacia persiciflora, Leucaena
   leucocephala and Chamaecytisus palmensis were ranked high by both sheep
   and goats. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Title = {Growth and yield of eight agroforestry tree species in line plantings in
   Western Kenya and their effect on maize yields and soil properties},

Year = {1997},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Between October 1988 and August 1992, field experiments were carried out
   in West Kenya to evaluate the suitability of Leucaena leucocephala, L.
   collinsii, Gliricidia sepium, Calliandra calothyrsus, Sesbania sesban,
   S. grandiflora, Senna siamea and S. spectabilis to provide a range of
   agroforestry products and services. The initial objective was to
   establish the growth rates and wood and leaf yields of these tree
   species, when planted in single rows. After the initial evaluation, it
   was evident that valuable additional information could be collected if
   the trees were converted to hedges and their effect on intercropped
   maize and soils was studied. At 21 months after planting, different
   species and provenances ranged in height between 3.5 and 6 m and varied
   considerably in phenotypic appearance. Wood production (1988-1990)
   varied from 3 to 33.8 t ha(-1) and leaf production varied from 0.62 to
   10.1 t ha(-1). During intercropping (1990-1992), leaf production varied
   from 0 to 10.9 t ha(-1). Maize yields were higher in association with
   Leucaena and Gliricidia than with Calliandra, Sesbania and Senna.
   Cumulative maize grain and stover yields over four seasons were
   positively correlated with the total amount of tree leaves applied (r(2)
   range, 0.70-0.95). Tne effect of tree leaf mulch on crop yields
   decreased over time for all species. Leaves with high nutrient contents,
   which decompose fast (Leucaena, Gliricidia, Sesbania) are likely to have
   been more effective in sustaining crop yields than leaves with lower
   nutrient contents (Senna) or more complex decomposition patterns
   (Calliandra). Simple `'leaf input-crop output'' budgets to calculate the
   reserves for N, P and K in different systems explained crop yield
   differences in some cases, Compared to the fertility status of
   `'zero-mulch'' control plots, the status of soil C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg and
   S was to varying degrees improved under Leucaena, Gliricidia and
   Sesbania, much less under Calliandra but not under Senna. First season
   grain yields were related to the soil fertility status at the end of the
   tree fallow. The results of these experiments suggest that under
   subhumid tropical conditions with soils of relatively poor nutrient
   status, where light and water are not likely to be the major limiting
   factors to crop production, the application of sufficient quantities of
   high quality tree mulch may positively influence maize yields. When
   agroforestry tree species with contrasting decomposition and nutrient
   release patterns are evaluated jointly, it is more difficult to
   demonstrate a general relationship between quantities of mulch applied

Abstract = {The effects of forage type and season on retention time (RT) and the
   fatty acid (FA) profile of the rumen fluid (RF) of steers grazing a
   range of grasses and a legume/grass mix were evaluated. Four rumen
   cannulated steers (790 +/- 17 kg body weight (BW) grazed individual wet
   season pastures (herbage mass 2600-6200 kg DM/ha of C3 ryegrass Lolium
   perenne and C4 grasses pangola Digitaria eriantha, signal grass
   Brachiaria decumbens, star grass Cynodon dactylon, kikuyu Penniseturn
   clandestinum, and speargrass Heteropogon contortus in both seasons, and
   a mixture of leucaena Leucaena leucocephala and green panic Panicum
   maximum in the dry season. Each grazing period consisted of at least 21
   d, followed by a 3 d collection period. On d 22 CrEDTA was used to
   estimate RT (182 mg Cr/100 kg BW via the cannula) and RF samples were
   collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 28, 32 and 48 h after dosing for Cr
   analysis. Diet crude protein (CP) and dry matter digestibility (DMD)
   were estimated by faecal NIBS. Concentration of NH3N and volatile fatty
   acids (VFA) in RF was determined at 0, 8 and 16 h after dosing. Dry
   season speargrass had the lowest CP (18 and 39 g/kg DM in plucked sample
   (PS) and estimated by faecal NIRS, respectively) and DMD (49\%), which
   was associated with a low NH3N (9 mg NH3N/L) and VFA concentration (70
   mM) in RF, and much longer RT of Cr (20 h) than the other grasses. The
   RT of Cr of the other wet season grasses was similar across all forage
   species (8- to 11 hours). Total VFA in RF was lowest for steers grazing
   dry season grass, intermediate for grasses in the wet season and highest
   for steers grazing the legume/grass mix. Speargrass had the highest
   non-glucogenic:glucogenic VFA. Ryegrass had higher CP (190 g/kg DM) and
   DMD (68\%), but steers grazing this pasture had similar NH3N
   concentration in RF to steers grazing kikuyu and leaucaena/grass mix
   (above 100 mg NH3N/L). Palmitic and stearic acid in RF were much higher
   than in plucked samples, but all grasses had similar total saturated FA
   in RF with a greater degree of saturation for ryegrass. A higher CLA
   c9,t11 in RF of steers grazing ryegrass most likely resulted from the
   linoleic content in the forage and the higher intake of ryegrass
   resulting in accumulation in RF. Total unsaturated FA (TUFA) content of
   RF was reduced markedly compared to forage samples with some small
   differences between species indicating an extensive biohydrogenation
   despite the grass type and season. It was concluded that RT of Cr in the
   rumen of cattle grazing wet season grasses was similar across all forage
   species (8 to 11 hours) and would not result in different times for
   biohydrogenation within the rumen.},

   Ethiopian Menz sheep - 2. Nitrogen metabolism},
Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {39},

Pages = {161-173},
Abstract = {The effect of different condensed tannins concentrations on protein
   metabolism from browse supplements was investigated in a 90-day trial
   using sixty-six male Ethiopian Menz sheep. Teff straw (Eragrostis tef)
   was fed ad libitum (control diet), or supplemented with 190 g dried
   leaves of six Sesbania sesban accessions with increasing levels of
   condensed tannin (SI, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6), lablab (Dolichos lablab),
   tagasaste (Chamaecytisus palmensis), leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala)
   and goetzei (Sesbania goetzei) in a completely randomized block design.
   The condensed tannins were highest in goetzei; S6, S5 and leucaena,
   intermediate in S4, S3, S2 and S1, and lowest in tagasaste and lablab.
   The supplemented animals had significantly (P < 0.05) higher total dry
   matter and nitrogen (N) intake than the ones fed teff straw alone. The
   digestibility of N was lower for the control diet than for any other
   treatment (P < 0.05). S1 and S2 supplemented diets had significantly
   higher (P < 0.05) N digestibilities than all other diets. Faecal N,
   urinary N and urinary N per kg N excreted were significantly different
   (P < 0.0001) between diets. With increasing tannin levels (among
   Sesbania accessions) there was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in
   urinary N (S1 > S2 > S3 >S4 > S5), and an increase (P < 0.05) in faecal
   N (S1 < S2 < S3 < S4 < S5). Supplementation increased faecal N output
   significantly (P < 0.0001) as well as the N retention. Among the forage
   supplements, N retention was significantly (P < 0.0001) lower in
   lablab-, tagasaste; leucaena-, S4- and goetzei-supplemented diets, than
   for Si, S2, S5 and S6. Apparent nitrogen digestibility was positively
   correlated (P < 0.001) with the supplement dry matter and crude protein
   (CP) degradation after 24 h (r = 0.93 and r = 0.85, respectively), the
   CP content (r = 0.87), and was negatively cor related with acid
   detergent fibre and neutral detergent fibre (r = -0.87 and -0.87,
   respectively). The CP degradability characteristics of the forages
   differed (P < 0.001) in water solubility (93-470 g kg(-1) CP), rate of
   degradation (2.58-9.73 \%/h), lag phase (-1.36-13.37 h), and estimated
   escape protein (262-619 g kg(-1) CP). With increasing tannin levels
   (among Sesbania accessions), there was a significant decrease (P <
   0.0001) in the rate of degradation (S1 > S2 > S3 > S4 > S5), and an
   increase in the estimated escape protein. The estimated rumen degradable
   protein (supplements) varied from 482 to 744 g kg(-1) CP, while
   intestine digestible protein and the undegradable protein varied from
   140 to 314 g kg(-1) CP, hence the browses can supply adequate levels of
   rumen degradable and bypass protein.},

Abstract = {Runoff and soil erosion were measured in a two-phase experiment for
   seven consecutive years from 1979 through 1986 on a 44.3 watershed
   comprising 12 sub-watersheds of 2-4 ha each. These experiments were
   conducted at Ibadan, Nigeria, which is characterized by two growing
   seasons per year. The first season lasts from mid-March through
   mid-July, and the second season from mid-August to early November.
   Experiments were conducted in two phases comprising different
   treatments. The six treatments during Phase I (1979-1981), involving
   different combinations of land clearing and tillage methods, were: (1)
   manual clearing (MC) with plough-till (PT); (2) MC with no till (NT);
   (3) shear-blade (SE) clearing with NT; (4) tree-pusher (TP) clearing
   with PT; (5) TP clearing with NT; (6) traditional clearing and farming
   (TF). The five farming-system treatments during Phase II (1982-1987)
   were: (A) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala planted on the
   contour at 4 m intervals, (B) fallowing with mucuna (Mucuna utilis) on
   severely degraded soils; (C) fallowing with mucuna on moderately
   degraded soils; (D) ley farming on severely degraded soils; (E) ley
   farming on moderately degraded soils. The traditional farming treatment
   of Phase I was discontinued in 1982 at the beginning of Phase II and the
   land was returned to natural fallowing. Runoff, soil erosion, and
   nutrient losses in runoff were monitored using a 4.5 feet I-I-Flume,
   FW-1 waterstage recorder and Coshocton Wheel sampler. From the mean
   annual rainfall of 1320 mm, mean annual runoff amounts for the 3-year
   period from 1979 through 1981 during Phase I were 5.6 mm (0.42 per cent
   of rainfall) for MC-NT, 5.7 mm (0.43 per cent) for TF, 43.2 mm (3.27 per
   cent) for SB-NT, 43.5 mm (3.30 per cent) for MC-PT, 68.3 mm (5.17 per
   cent) for TP-NT, and 113.1 mm (8.57 per cent) for TP-PT treatments.
   Runoff losses were consistently more during the first compared with the
   second growing season. Trends in soil erosion were similar to those of
   runoff, and annual soil erosion amounts were 0.1 Mg ha(-1) for MC-NT,
   0.2 Mg ha(-1) for TF, 1 5 Mg ha(-1) for SB-NT, 3.6 Mg ha(-1) for MC-PT,
   5.1 Mg ha(-1) for TP-NT, and 8.3 Mg ha(-1) for TP-PT treatments.
   Measurements made during Phase II showed that there were no significant
   differences in runoff or soil erosion among the restorative farming
   systems adopted. Nutrient concentrations in runoff and nutrient loss
   were generally high in uncropped treatments, e.g. mucuna fallow during
   the fallowing phase and ley farming during the grazing phase.},

Title = {Productivity and profitability of alternative steer growth paths
   resulting from accessing high-quality forage systems in the subtropics
   of northern Australia: a modelling approach},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Beef producers have to determine the best allocation of a limited
   resource of high-quality forage. This analysis assessed the most
   profitable way of incorporating high-quality forages into the
   whole-of-life steer growth path on forage systems in central Queensland,
   using property-level, regionally relevant herd models that determine
   whole-of-business productivity and profitability over a 30-year
   investment period. Twenty-two growth paths (liveweight change over time)
   from weaning to marketing were investigated for steers grazing buffel
   grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) pastures with and without access to
   leucaena-grass pastures (Leucaena leucocephala spp. glabrata +
   perennial, tropical grass (C4) species) or forage oats (Avena sativa)
   for varying intervals throughout their growth path. The production,
   economic and financial effect of each growth path was assessed by
   comparison to a base scenario that produced finished, slaughter steers
   (605 kg) from buffel grass pastures. The relative profitability of
   marketing steers at feedlot entry (feed-on) weight (474 kg) instead of
   slaughter weights was also assessed. The growth paths were applied
   within two beef enterprises, namely (1) steer turnover and (2) breeding
   and finishing. For both enterprises, grazing steers on leucaena-grass
   pastures from weaning until they achieved feedlot entry weight (474 kg)
   was substantially more profitable than any other growth path. Compared
   with the base scenario, this optimal growth path improved profitability
   by 121\% and 37\% for the steer turnover and the breeding and finishing
   enterprises respectively. The purchase of additional breeders for the
   latter enterprise was required to optimise utilisation of the
   leucaena-grass pastures immediately. Incorporating leucaena-grass
   pastures at any steer age improved the profitability of the steer
   turnover enterprise (AU\$7368-AU\$106508 extra profit/annum), and
   similarly for the breeding and finishing enterprise (AU\$1754-AU\$31383
   extra profit/annum) except for two scenarios where leucaena-grass
   pastures were provided to older steers targeted at the feed-on market
   (AU\$4816 and AU\$23886 less profit/annum). However, incorporation of
   leucaena-grass into steer growth paths also resulted in increased peak
   deficit levels and financial risk to the business compared with buffel
   grass-only production systems, with payback periods for the most
   profitable growth path of 8 and 14 years for the steer turnover and the
   breeding and finishing enterprise respectively. All growth paths that
   incorporated forage oats and leucaena-grass resulted in lower economic
   and financial performance than did comparable growth paths that
   incorporated leucaena-grass only. Furthermore, incorporating oats into
   buffel grass-only growth paths always reduced the enterprise
   profitability. There was no relationship, across scenarios within an
   enterprise, between change in profit and the number of extra weaners
   produced or the amount of extra beef produced per hectare.},

Abstract = {Two experiments with the gas pressure transducer technique were
   conducted to investigate the effects of different types and levels of
   tannins. Forage samples were incubated in batch cultures together with
   rumen fluid and digestion medium in order to model rumen fermentation
   dynamics in vitro. In Experiment 1, graded levels (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100
   mg/g of forage dry matter (DM)) of purified condensed tannins (CT)
   obtained from four tanniniferous tropical shrub legumes, Flemingia
   macrophylla, Leucaena leucocephala and two provenances of Calliandra
   calothyrsus (San Ramon and Patulul), were added to a CT-free mixture of
   the grass Brachiaria humidicola and the herbaceous legume Vigna
   unguiculata. The statistical models used for data evaluation included
   the two main effects (origin and level of CT) and their interaction.
   Apart from dose-dependent effects (P<0.001) there were clear
   plant-specific effects (mostly P<0.001) in fermentation dynamics, in
   vitro DM degradation and apparent degradation of N-containing compounds.
   Tannins from C calothyrsus had the most pronounced effects on
   fermentation dynamics and nutrient degradation, followed by E
   macrophylla and L. leucocephala. Within C. calothyrsus, CT from the
   provenance San Ramon suppressed asymptotic gas production and DM
   degradation to a larger extent (P<0.05) than CT from the provenance
   Patulul. Low addition (25 mg/g DM) of CT from C. calothyrsus was only
   slightly detrimental while high CT levels (75 and 100 mg/g DM) had
   clearly negative effects on asymptotic gas production and DM
   degradation. In a first incubation in Experiment 2, the grass in
   mixtures with foliage of the different tanniniferous shrub legumes was
   incubated with graded levels of polyethylene glycol (PEG) corresponding
   to 0/3, 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3 of the contents of CT in these mixtures. In a
   second incubation, all mixtures based on tanniniferous shrub legumes and
   mixtures containing non-tanniniferous shrub legumes (Cratylia argentea,
   Desmodium velutinum) or a herbaceous legume (V. unguiculata) were tested
   without PEG and with 80 g/kg supplementary PEG. In general, addition of
   PEG had no effect (P>0.05) on fermentation parameters in
   non-tanniniferous legumes. With tanniniferous species, response curves
   in fermentation parameters were mostly non-linear reaching a plateau at
   a PEG:CT-ratio between 1:3 and 2:3. One exception was that undegraded
   dietary N decreased (P<0.05) with increasing PEG addition until the
   highest level. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that to a large
   extent the effects of CT-rich plants on in vitro ruminal fermentation
   can be explained by the specific CT properties. Furthermore, apart from
   binding CT, PEG seems to have no major side-effects on ruminal
   fermentation, and for most fermentation variables and species, PEG
   supplementation equivalent to the CT content in the forage mixtures
   seems sufficient to prevent negative effects of CT on fermentation
   parameters. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Enzymatically hydrolysed yeast is a novel form of yeast
   culture with positive effects as prebiotics used to improve
   gastrointestinal health in ruminants. However, their effect on ruminal
   nutrient digestion is unclear. This study evaluated the effects of a
   combined yeast culture and enzymatically hydrolysed yeast on dry matter,
   fibre, and crude protein ruminal digestibility in vitro. Seven different
   substrates inclusive of legume and grass forages and commercial
   supplemental feedstuffs were incubated for 24 and 48 h, with or without
   enzymatically hydrolysed yeast, and again for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48
   h to determine crude protein degradability. Enzymatically hydrolysed
   yeast improved the fibre digestion of Brachiaria arrecta by 32\%, while
   the dry matter and crude protein digestibility in soybean meal and
   Glircidia sepium were reduced by 16.2\% and 38.5\%, respectively, after
   24 h of incubation. Therefore, enzymatically hydrolysed yeast has
   potential to improve ruminal fibre digestibility and modify the crude
   protein degradation of different substrates, which may contribute to the
   improved utilization of fibrous feedstuffs and efficiency in nitrogen
   and crude protein metabolism in ruminants.Abstract Live yeast cultures
   have been a popular additive in ruminant feeds to improve fermentation
   efficiency, rumen, and intestinal health. However, very little is known
   about inactive yeast culture and hydrolysable yeast cells on nutrient
   digestibility in ruminants. Therefore, this study was conducted to
   determine the effects of a combined yeast culture and enzymatically
   hydrolysed yeast (YC+EHY) on in vitro dry matter and nutrient
   digestibility. Seven chemically contrasting substrates, including the
   leaves and petiole of forage plants (Trichanthera gigantea, Gliricidia
   sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, and Brachiaria arrecta), agriculture
   by-products (soybean meal and rice hulls), and a commercial concentrate
   feed, were incubated in vitro with and without YC+EHY to determine dry
   matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), and acid
   detergent fibre (ADF) digestibility after 24 and 48 h of incubation. A
   second experiment evaluated in vitro CP degradability by incubating
   substrates for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h with and without YC+EHY.
   Incubation with YC+EHY reduced 24 h DM and CP digestibility in soybean
   meal and G. sepium by 16.2\% and 38.5\%, respectively. Conversely, the
   ADF digestibility of B. arrecta incubated with YC+EHY increased by 32\%.
   In vitro ruminal DM and nutrient digestibility were unaffected by YC+EHY
   after 48 h of incubation. The rate of CP degradability in the commercial
   concentrate and rice hull inoculated with YC+EHY increased sharply
   between 16 and 24 h post-incubation and generally plateaued afterwards.
   Similarly, YC+EHY significantly increased CP degradability in L.
   leucocephala after 8 and 16 h of incubation. The 16 h CP degradation in
   T. gigantea without YC+EHY was significantly higher. It was therefore
   concluded that YC+EHY has potential to improve ruminal ADF digestibility
   and modify ruminal CP degradation dependent on the type of substrate.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Currently there is an urgent need to modify food
   production systems, including the influence of ruminants, due to
   extensive land use and environmental impacts. Grazing cattle excreta
   emit considerable amounts of methane and nitrous oxide. The objectives
   of this work were to assess the production and quality of the forage,
   milk production, and methane and nitrous oxide emissions from the cattle
   feces and urine in two production systems: conventional grazing (grass
   in a monoculture) and a silvopastoral system (association of leguminous
   shrubs with grass). The inclusion of legumes in the diet of grazing
   cattle increases forage quality and reduces the methane and nitrous
   oxide emissions from urine and feces. In Mexico, pasture degradation is
   associated with extensive pastures; additionally, under these
   conditions, livestock activities contribute considerably to greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions. Among the options to improve grazing systems and
   reduce GHG emissions, silvopastoral systems (SPS) have been recommended.
   The objectives of this work were to quantify the N outflow in a
   soil-plant-animal interface, as well as the CH4 emissions and milk
   production in an SPS with woody legumes (Leucaena leucocephala) that is
   associated with stargrass (Cynodon nlemfuensis). This was then compared
   with stargrass in a monoculture system (MS) in the seasons (dry and
   rainy period) over a two-year period. Dung was collected from the
   animals of each of the grazing systems and applied fresh to the land
   plots. Fresh dung and urine were collected from the cows of each grazing
   system and were applied to the experimental plots. In addition, the soil
   CH4 and N2O contents were measured to quantify the emissions. Average
   milk yield by seasons was similar: MS (7.1 kg per animal unit
   (AU)/day(-1)) and SPS (6.31 kg per AU/day(-1)). Cows in the MS had a
   mean N intake of 171.9 g/UA day(-1) without seasonal variation, while
   the SPS animals' mean N intake was 215.7 g/UA day(-1) for both seasons.
   For the urine applied to soil, the N2O outflow was higher in the MS
   (peak value = 1623.9 \& mu;g N-N2O m(-2) h(-1)). The peak value for the
   SPS was 755.9 \& mu;g of N-N2O m(-2) h(-1). The N2O emissions were
   higher in the rainy season (which promotes denitrification). The values
   for the feces treatment were 0.05\% (MS) and 0.01\% (SPS). The urine
   treatment values were 0.52\% (MS) and 0.17\% (SPS). The emissions of CH4
   showed that the feces of the SPS systems resulted in a higher
   accumulation of gas in the rainy season (29.8 g C ha(-1)), followed by
   the feces of the MS system in the dry season (26.0 g C ha(-1)). Legumes
   in the SPS helped to maintain milk production, and the N2O emissions
   were lower than those produced by the MS (where the pastures were
   fertilized with N).},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate effects of different doses of
   Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Solix babylonica (SB) extracts, rich in
   secondary metabolites, and their mixture (LLSB, 1:1, v/v) on in vitro
   gas production and some ruminal fermentation patterns such as truly
   degraded substrate (TDS), short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and microbial
   protein production (MP) of a high concentrate diet (HCD) fed to growing
   lambs. The HCD contained (g/kg DM): crude protein (CP), 208; ether
   extract (EE), 12; neutral detergent fibre (NDFom), 364; acid detergent
   fibre (aADFom), 41. Plant extracts were prepared at 1 g DM/8 ml of
   solvent mixture (methanol:ethanol:water, 1:1:8) and added at levels of
   0, 0.6, 12 and 1.8 ml/g DM. Rumen liquor was collected from 8 growing
   lambs (Katandin x Pelibuey, LW 24 +/- 0.3 kg) fed the same HCD. In vitro
   gas production (GP) was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h
   of incubation. After 72 h, the incubation was stopped and the inoculants
   pH was determined and filtered to determine TDS. Ruminal fermentation
   parameters such as 24 h partitioning factor (PF24), gas yield (GY(24)),
   in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), metabolizable energy
   (ME), SCFA, and MP were also estimated. Tree species x extract level
   interaction (P<0.05) only occurred for gas production at 24 (GP(24)), 48
   (GP) and 72 h (GP(72)) of incubation, but there were no interactions
   before 24 h of incubation. Relative to control, addition of extracts
   increased (P<0.05) gas volume GP(24), GP(48) and GP(72), except LLSB
   extract which had lower (P<0.05) values during the first 48 h of
   incubation versus control (Le., 0 ml/g DM). There was no significant
   impact of extracts on gas production parameters (i.e., b; asymptotic gas
   production. c; rate of gas production and L; discrete lag time prior to
   gas production), while the L tended to decrease (P = 0.073) with
   increasing extract dose only in LL and SB extracts. Addition of either
   dose of supplemental LL and SB extracts increased (P<0.05) gas
   production and this increase was higher (P<0.05) for 1.2 ml and 1.8 ml
   than 0.6 ml extract/g DM for GP(24), GP(48) and GP(72). In general, gas
   productions were higher (P<0.05) in SB than LL extract. There were no
   interaction in final ruminal pH, PF24 and GY(24), while some
   fermentation parameters (i.e., TDS, IVOMD, ME, SCFA, and MP) were higher
   (P<0.05) in LL and SB extract doses versus control. The highest two
   extract doses (i.e., 1.2 and 1.8 ml/g DM) increased (P<0.05) TDS, IVOMD,
   ME, SCFA and MP values versus 0.6 ml/g DM. The SB extract also had
   higher positive impacts (P<0.05) on rumen fermentation parameters versus
   LL extract. It is suggested that the},

Abstract = {In vitro gas production, dry matter and nitrogen degradabilities of
   fresh and sun-dried foliages of four fodder trees (FTs) (Sesbania
   sesban, Leucaena leucocephala, Chamaecytisus palmensis (tagasaste),
   Vernonia amygdalina) and of teff straw were estimated. In Experiment 1,
   feed samples were incubated in three different rumen environments
   (ecologies) created by feeding sheep the following: teff straw, teff
   straw + 174 g dry matter (DM) of sesbania and teff straw + 167 g DM of
   leucaena. In Experiment 2, different rumen ecologies were created by
   feeding teff straw supplemented with 119, 178 or 232 g DM day-1 of
   sesbania or with 117, 175 or 232 g DM day-1 of leucaena.
   Gas production constants were estimated following the equation: GP
   =B(1-e(-Ct)) where GP is gas produced at time t, B is potential gas
   production and C is the rate of gas production at time t. Rumen fluid
   was sampled at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h after feeding in Experiment 2 and
   pH, NH3-N, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and minerals determined. Plasma
   urea nitrogen (PUN) concentrations were estimated in blood taken from
   the sheep at 3, 6, 9 and 12 h.
   Drying relatively increased the neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid
   detergent fibre (ADF) and NDF-nitrogen concentrations in all foliages
   except in leucaena. Dry sesbania, tagasaste and vernonia had lower
   nitrogen concentrations than the fresh ones but the opposite trend was
   observed for leucaena. Dry matter disappearance (DD) at incubation times
   of 3-48 h and degradation constants differed among the four foliages (P
   < 0.05). Compared with the other foliages, sesbania had lower fibre
   fractions and degraded faster. Drying of foliages reduced degradability.
   Supplementation did not affect (P < 0.05) the DD of fresh foliages but
   enhanced (P <0.05) the rate of dry foliages. There was not feed type x
   rumen ecology interaction (P>0.05) for either dry or fresh foliages. The
   rate of teff straw degradation in sheep fed supplemented diets was
   increased (P<0.06).
   Gas production was lower in dry than in fresh foliage. Gas production
   values (ml per 200 mg DM) for dry foliages were: sesbania, 55.5;
   tagasaste, 54.5; vernonia, 49.5; leucaena, 45. Corresponding values for
   fresh foliages were: tagasaste, 81.8; sesbania, 62.7; leucaena, 51.1;
   vernonia, 51. The rates of gas production (h-1) were highest for dry
   tagasaste (0.0779), followed by sesbania (0.0718), leucaena (0.0563) and
   vernonia (0.0477). Corresponding values for fresh foliages were:
   leucaena, 0.0541; tagasaste, 0.0528; sesbania, 0.0478; vernonia, 0.0366.
   Supplementation increased levels of all rumen metabolites measured.
   Rumen NH3-N was highly correlated (r = 0.88; P < 0.05) with PUN.
   Correlations among the other metabolites were either low or negative.
   The results are discussed in relation to the chemical composition, type
   and form of fodder tree and the rumen ecology resulting from feeding
   these foliages.},

Title = {GROWTH AND N FIXATION OF SOME TROPICAL FORAGE LEGUMES AS INFLUENCED BY
   SOLAR-RADIATION REGIMES},
Journal = {AGRONOMY JOURNAL},
Year = {1982},
Volume = {74},
Number = {4},
Pages = {703-709},
Abstract = {Decreased solar radiation due to cloud cover or shading by plantation
   crops or associated grass can severely limit the production of tropical
   forage legumes. The response of 6 legumes (3 replicated and 3 not
   replicated) to 4 radiation regimes (100, 70, 45 and 27\% of unshaded
   solar radiation, hereafter termed full sun) with polypropylene netting
   in the field was evaluated. The 3 replicated legumes had significant
   yield reductions at 27\% full sun, with intermediate reductions at 70
   and 45\%. Dry matter (DM) yields at full sun {[}metric tons (mt)
   ha-1yr-1 and proportional yields at 27\%] were Desmodium intortum cv.
   Greenleaf (20.0, 46\%); Centrosema pubescens cv. Centro (13.7, 44\%);
   and Macroptilium atropurpureum cv. Siratro (12.9, 20\%). Cultivar
   Greenleaf was relatively tolerant of moderate shading; proportional
   yields at 70 and 45\% of full sun were 93 and 75\%, respectively.
   Cultivars Centro and Siratro yields declined linearly as shortwave
   radiation (hereafter termed radiation) decreased, but cv. Siratro yields
   declined significantly more than cv. Centro. Marked seasonal differences
   were noted in the response of the legumes to shade and this was
   attributed to differences in the ability of the legumes to utilize solar
   radiation during periods of cool temperatures. The 3 non-replicated
   legumes were evaluated similarly, except that yields were adjusted for
   replication effects. Dry matter {[}DM] yields and proportional yields at
   27\% full sun were Leucaena leucocephala cv. Hawaiian Giant (23.5,
   40\%); Stylosanthes guianensis cv. Schofield stylo (17.0, 17\%); and
   Desmodium canum cv. Kaimi Clover (12.2, 32\%). Cultivars Hawaiian Giant
   and Greenleaf yielded similarly at 45 and 27\% full sun. Cultivar Kaimi
   Clover DM yield tended to be slightly higher (13.8) at 70\% full sun,
   but thereafter yields declined linearly with reduced radiation. Cultivar
   Schofield stylo was the most sensitive to shading. DM and N
   concentrations were not significantly elevated by reduced radiation or
   cool weather except that N increased during the cool season.
   Concentrations of N differed among species being highest for cultivars
   Centro and Hawaiian Giant (3.4\%) and lowest for cv. Kaimi Clover
   (2.6\%). Total N yields were associated with DM yields. N yields (kg N
   ha-1yr-1) of replicated legumes at full sun and proportional yields at
   27\% full sun were cv. Greenleaf (540, 45\%), cv. Centro (461, 44\%) and
   cv. Siratro (362, 27\%); and for the non-replicated legumes cv. Hawaiian
   Giant (751, 38\%), cv. Schofield (496, 18\%) and cv. Kaimi Clover {[}340
   (361 at 70\% full sun), 38\%]. Acetylene reduction rates by nodules in
   soil cores were highly correlated with radiation regimes. Correlation of
   acetylene reduction rates with DM yields ranged from 0.80-0.996. The
   higher yielding legumes, cultivars Greenleaf, Centro and Hawaiian Giant
   (plus Kaimi clover for .apprx. 70\% full sun only) appear well-suited
   for areas of low solar radiation because they have relatively constant
   concentrations of DM and N and fixed significant quantities of N even
   under dense shade.},

   ESTABLISHMENT AND SYMBIOTIC PERFORMANCE OF INTRODUCED RHIZOBIA ON
   FIELD-GROWN LEGUMES},

Abstract = {Indigenous rhizobia in soil present a competition barrier to the
   establishment of inoculant strains, possibly leading to inoculation
   failure. In this study, we used the natural diversity of rhizobial
   species and numbers in our fields to define, in quantitative terms, the
   relationship between indigenous rhizobial populations and inoculation
   response. Eight standardized inoculation trials were conducted at five
   well-characterized field sites on the island of Maui, Hawaii. Soil
   rhizobial populations ranged from 0 to over 3.5 x 10(4) g of soil-1 for
   the different legumes used. At each site, no less than four but as many
   as seven legume species were planted from among the following: soybean
   (Glycine max), lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), cowpea (Vigna
   unguiculata), bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), peanut (Arachis hypogaea),
   Leucaena leucocephala, tinga pea (Lathyrus tingeatus), alfalfa (Medicago
   sativa), and clover (Trifolium repens). Each legume was (i) inoculated
   with an equal mixture of three effective strains of homologous rhizobia,
   (ii) fertilized at high rates with urea, or (iii) left uninoculated. For
   soybeans, a nonnodulating isoline was used in all trials as the
   rhizobia-negative control. Inoculation increased economic yield for 22
   of the 29 (76\%) legume species-site combinations. While the yield
   increase was greater than 100 kg ha-1 in all cases, in only 11 (38\%) of
   the species-site combinations was the increase statistically significant
   (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05). On average, inoculation increased yield
   by 62\%. Soybean (G. max) responded to inoculation most frequently,
   while cowpea (V. unguiculata) failed to respond in all trials.
   Inoculation responses in the other legumes were site dependent. The
   response to inoculation and the competitive success of inoculant
   rhizobia were inversely related to numbers of indigenous rhizobia. As
   few as 50 rhizobia g of soil-1 eliminated inoculation response. When
   fewer than 10 indigenous rhizobia g soil-1 were present, economic yield
   was significantly increased 85\% of the time. Yield was significantly
   increased in only 6\% of the observations when numbers of indigenous
   rhizobia were greater than 10 cells g of soil-1. A significant response
   to N application, significant increases in nodule parameters, and
   greater than 50\% nodule occupancy by inoculant rhizobia did not
   necessarily coincide with significant inoculation responses. No less
   than a doubling of nodule mass and 66\% nodule occupancy by inoculant
   rhizobia were required to significantly increase the yield of inoculated
   crops over that of uninoculated crops. However, lack of an inoculation
   response was common even when inoculum strains occupied the majority of
   nodules. In these trials, the symbiotic yield of crops was, on average,
   only 88\% of the maximum yield potential, as defined by the fertilizer N
   treatment. The difference between the yield of N-fertilized crops and
   that of N2-fixing crops indicates a potential for improving inoculation
   technology, the N2 fixation capacity of rhizobial strains, and the
   efficiency of symbiosis. In this study, we show that the probability of
   enhancing yield with existing inoculation technology decreases
   dramatically with increasing numbers of indigenous rhizobia.},

Title = {Legume effect for enhancing productivity and nutrient use-efficiency in
   major cropping systems - An Indian perspective: A review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-86},
Abstract = {Inclusion of legumes in the cropping system has been known since times
   immemorial. Legume is a natural mini-nitrogen manufacturing factory in
   the field and the farmers by growing these crops can play a vital role
   in increasing indigenous nitrogen production. Legume help in
   solubilizing insoluble P in soil, improving the soil physical
   environment, increasing soil microbial activity, and restoring organic
   matter, and also has smothering effect on weed. The carryover of N
   derived from legume grown, either in crop sequence or in intercropping
   system for succeeding crops, is also important. In a country like India,
   where the average consumption of plant nutrients from chemical
   fertilizers on national basis is very low, the scope for exploiting
   direct and residual fertility due to legumes has obviously a great
   potential. This article deals with the beneficial effect of important
   legumes on increasing productivity and nutrient use-efficiency in
   various systems. Sorghum, pearl millet, maize, and castor are mainstay
   in dry lands and marginal and sub-marginal lands. Sorghum yield
   increased when sown after cowpea, green gram, and groundnut. Grain
   legumes like groundnut or cowpea provide an equivalent to 60 kg N ha on
   the Subsequent crop of pearl millet. Various studies have shown that
   among legume/cereal intercropping system, the combination of
   maize/pigeon pea is considered to be highly suitable with a minimum
   competition for nutrients, while legume/legume intercropping system,
   pigeon pea/groundnut system is the most efficient one in terms of
   resource use-efficiency. In alley cropping system, Leucaena leucocephala
   (Subabul) prunings provide N to the extent of 75 kg, which benefits the
   intercrop castor and sorghum. Nitrogen economy through intercropped
   legume is still a researchable issue because the key point for
   leguminous crop grown in intercropping system is the problem of
   nodulation. Incorporation of whole plant of summer green gram/black
   grain into soil (after picking pods) before transplanting rice resulted
   in the economizing (40-60 kg N ha(-1), 30 kg P2O5, and 15 kg K2O per ha)
   of rice in rice-wheat system. Similarly, 6-8 weeks old green manure crop
   of sunhemp or dhaincha accumulates about 3-4 t ha(-1) dry matter and
   100-120 kg N ha(-1) which, when incorporated in situ, supplements up to
   50\% of the total N requirement of rice. Legumes with indeterminate
   growth are more efficient in N, fixation than determinate types. Fodder
   legumes in general are more potent in increasing the productivity of
   succeeding cereals. The carryover of N for succeeding crops may be
   60-120 kg in berseem, 75 kg in Indian clover, 9 t, 75 kg in cluster
   bean, 35-60 kg in fodder cowpea, 68 kg in chickpea, 55 kg in black gram,
   54-58 kg in groundnut, 50-51 kg in soybean, 50 kg in Lathyrus, and 36-42
   kg per ha in pigeon pea. Direct and residual effect of partially
   acidulated material and mixture of rock phosphate + single
   superphosphate were observed to be better when these were applied to
   green gram in winter season than to rice in rainy season simply because
   of legume effect.},

Title = {The diversity and quality of forages and their potency as herbal
   anthelmintic for swamp buffalo in Brebes District, Central Java},
Journal = {VETERINARY WORLD},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Background and Aim: Swamp buffaloes play an important role in the rural
   economy of Indonesia. They consume various forages during their grazing
   time, including those with anti-parasitic potential. However, the
   information about the type and quality of forages and their potential as
   a natural anthelmintic for swamp buffalo is very limited. This study
   aimed to identify the diversity, quality, and anthelmintic potency of
   forages consumed by swamp buffaloes reared in Bantarkawung Subdistrict,
   Brebes District, Central Java Province, Indonesia.Materials and Methods:
   Samples of forages were obtained during three observation periods of the
   study, with a 12-week interval between each period. Forage diversity was
   evaluated by identifying its consumption by swamp buffaloes during their
   grazing activity in the field and feeding time in their shed. The
   quality of forages was analyzed using proximate analysis to measure
   their dry matter (DM), crude fiber (CF), crude protein (CP), crude fat
   (CFat), and ash contents. This is followed by the calculation of their
   total digestible nutrient based on the proximate analysis results.
   Botanical composition analysis was then conducted to measure the
   predominance of forages consumed by the livestock during their grazing
   activity. Literature reviews were carried out to explore forage's
   anthelmintic activity.Results: The results showed that swamp buffaloes
   consume nine species of forage in the shed and 47 in the grazing area,
   including nine legumes, 18 grass, and 20 others. Swamp buffaloes
   consumed forages of lower quality, which contained high CF contents and
   varying levels of other nutrients below their daily nutritional needs.
   The grazing activity allowed swamp buffaloes to consume a higher variety
   of forages with better nutritional quality, thereby enabling them to
   meet their nutritional needs. Legumes and other forages served as the
   major protein sources, providing CP of 20.03\% DM and 11.53\% DM, and CF
   levels of 17.01\% DM and 20.35\% DM, respectively. The results also
   showed that the consumption of these forages increased during the rainy
   season. The predominant species of legumes consumed were Leucaena
   leucocephala and Acacia spp., while Alternanthera sessilis and Merremia
   umbellata were the predominant species of other forages. A total of 13
   of the 47 species could potentially be used as natural anthelmintic due
   to their secondary metabolites, namely, tannin, flavonoid, saponin,
   terpenoid, diterpenoid, and mimosine. These compounds exert anthelmintic
   effects by inhibiting egg-hatching and larval development, as well as
   damaging the surface structure of both larvae and adult worms,
   ultimately leading to the death of the parasites.Conclusion: Overall,
   swamp buffaloes consumed more variety of forages during grazing compared
   to when they were kept in sheds. While the low-variety and low-quality
   forages provisioned for swamp buffaloes in their shed resulted in a low
   nutrient intake below their daily requirement. Furthermore, daily
   grazing activities allowed swamp buffaloes to fulfill and supplement
   their need by consuming a variety of grasses, legumes, and other forages
   in their respective grazing areas. Some of these forages also have the
   potential to become natural anthelmintic because they contain secondary
   metabolites, such as tannins, flavonoids, saponins, terpenoids,
   diterpenoids, and mimosine.},

Abstract = {The effects of Sokoto phosphate rock ( PR) and plant residues on soil
   phosphorus ( P) fractions and crop performance was studied in the field
   on an alfisol in the derived savanna of southwestern Nigeria. The plant
   residues studied were leaves of Dactyladenia barteri, Flemingia
   macrophylla, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, maize ( Zea mays)
   stover and rice ( Oryza sativa) straw. They were applied alone or in
   combination with phosphate rock. The PR was applied at a rate of 60 kg P
   ha(-1) and the plant residues at 5 ton dry matter ha(-1) during the
   onset of the major rainy season. Plots without PR and plant residues
   application were included as control. After four weeks incubation period
   of PR and plant residues, Crotalaria ochroleuca ( shrub legume) was
   planted in 1999 and maize ( Zea mays) was planted in 2001 as test crops.
   When PR was not combined with plant residues, incubation of Dactyladenia
   residues increased resin P from 0.13 to 0.79 mg P kg(-1) at 4 weeks
   after incubation ( WAI). Other plant residues did not cause appreciable
   changes in resin P. Application of Leucaena residues increased
   NaOH-extractable inorganic P ( Pi) from 14.36 to 20.47 mg P kg(-1) at 4
   WAI. Total extractable P increased under all the plant residues at 4 WAI
   but decreased at 8 WAI. When PR was combined with plant residues, there
   were increases in almost all the P fractions under the plant residues at
   4 WAI followed by decreases at 8 WAI. Averaged across P levels, addition
   of Leucaena residues resulted in higher resin P, NaOH- Pi, residual P
   and total extractable P compared with the other plant residue
   treatments. Averaged across residue treatments, resin P increased from
   0.12 mg P kg(-1) to 0.75 mg P kg(-1) at 4 WAI and decreased to 0.08 mg P
   kg- 1 at 8 WAI. All other P pools showed similar trends but with less
   pronounced decreases at 8 WAI. When PR was not applied with plant
   residues, Crotalaria dry matter correlate positively with NaHCO3- Pi (
   R-2 = 0.59), NaOH- Pi ( R-2 = 0.53) and total extractable P ( R-2 =
   0.50), while Crotalaria P uptake correlate positively with NaHCO3- Pi (
   R2 = 0.50) at 4 WAI. Maize grain yield and P uptake did not correlate
   with any of the P fractions. However, when PR was applied with plant
   residues, maize P uptake was positively correlated with resin P ( R-2 =
   0.53) while Crotalaria dry matter ( R2 = 0.60) and P uptake ( R-2 =
   0.49) correlate positively with NaOH- Po at 4 WAI. Application of PR
   alone did not affect yields and P uptakes of Crotalaria and maize crops.
   Compared with the control without residues, Crotalaria dry matter
   production and P uptake increased significantly when residues were
   applied. Interaction effects between PR and Leucaena and rice straw
   residues on Crotalaria dry matter production and P uptake was
   significant. Interaction effects between PR and plant residues on maize
   yield and P uptake were not significant. Our results suggest that
   combined application of PR with selected plant residues may enhance P
   dissolution from PR and improve crop performance in some cases.},

Title = {Opening the ``black box{''} of nodD3, nodD4 and nodD5
   genes of Rhizobium tropici strain CIAT 899},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Background: Transcription of nodulation genes in rhizobial species is
   orchestrated by the regulatory nodD gene. Rhizobium tropici strain CIAT
   899 is an intriguing species in possessing features such as broad host
   range, high tolerance of abiotic stresses and, especially, by carrying
   the highest known number of nodD genes-five-and the greatest diversity
   of Nod factors (lipochitooligosaccharides, LCOs). Here we shed light on
   the roles of the multiple nodD genes of CIAT 899 by reporting, for the
   first time, results obtained with nodD3, nodD4 and nodD5 mutants.
   Methods: The three nodD mutants were built by insertion of Omega
   interposon. Nod factors were purified and identified by LC-MS/MS
   analyses. In addition, nodD1 and nodC relative gene expressions were
   measured by quantitative RT-PCR in the wt and derivative mutant strains.
   Phenotypic traits such as exopolysaccharide (EPS), lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS), swimming and swarming motilities, biofilm formation and indole
   acetid acid (IAA) production were also perfomed. All these experiments
   were carried out in presence of both inducers of CIAT 899, apigenin and
   salt. Finally, nodulation assays were evaluated in up to six different
   legumes, including common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.).
   Results: Phenotypic and symbiotic properties, Nod factors and gene
   expression of nodD3, nodD4 and nodD5 mutants were compared with those of
   the wild-type (WT) CIAT 899, both in the presence and in the absence of
   the nod-geneinducing molecule apigenin and of saline stress. No
   differences between the mutants and the WT were observed in
   exopolysaccharide (EPS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profiles, motility,
   indole acetic acid (IAA) synthesis or biofilm production, either in the
   presence, or in the absence of inducers. Nodulation studies demonstrated
   the most complex regulatory system described so far, requiring from one
   (Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus burtii) to four (Lotus japonicus) nodD
   genes. Up to 38 different structures of Nod factors were detected, being
   higher under salt stress, except for the nodD5 mutant; in addition, a
   high number of structures was synthesized by the nodD4 mutant in the
   absence of any inducer. Probable activator (nodD3 and nodD5) or
   repressor roles (nodD4), possibly via nodD1 and/or nodD2, were
   attributed to the three nodD genes. Expression of nodC, nodD1 and each
   nodD studied by RT-qPCR confirmed that nodD3 is an activator of nodD1,
   both in the presence of apigenin and salt stress. In contrast, nodD4
   might be an inducer with apigenin and a repressor under saline stress,
   whereas nodD5 was an inducer under both conditions.
   Conclusions: We report for R. tropici CIAT 899 the most complex model of
   regulation of nodulation genes described so far. Five nodD genes
   performed different roles depending on the host plant and the inducing
   environment. Nodulation required from one to four nodD genes, depending
   on the host legume. nodD3 and nodD5 were identified as activators of the
   nodD1 gene, whereas, for the first time, it was shown that a regulatory
   nodD gene-nodD4-might act as repressor or inducer, depending on the
   inducing environment, giving support to the hypothesis that nodD roles
   go beyond nodulation, in terms of responses to abiotic stresses.},

Abstract = {Four swamp buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) and four crossbred Bos indicus x
   B. taurus cattle, fistulated at the rumen and abomasum or duodenum, were
   offered rice straw with mineral supplements in two experiments. In Expt
   1, the straw was supplemented with 5 \% of leaf of Leucaena
   leucocephala, and in Expt 2 with either urea or urea with sunflower meal
   and rice grain. Intake of supplements of urea or urea/sunflower/rice
   respectively was 935 and 681 g/kg offered in buffaloes and 566 and 789
   in cattle.
   Buffaloes ruminated longer than cattle (Expt 1, 635 v. 452 min/day; Expt
   2, 626 v. 466 min/day, P < 0.01). In Expt 1, voluntary intake and
   frequency of `A' sequence forestomach contractions of both species was
   not affected by species, but buffaloes had a greater (P < 0.05)
   contraction force in the rumen and omasum, lower rate of `B' sequence
   rumen contractions, and faster (P < 0.001) rate of gastrointestinal
   passage than cattle. In Expt 2, voluntary intake of both species was
   similar, and addition of concentrates did not affect voluntary roughage
   consumption, nor in situ rate of digestion of rice straw. Rate and
   predicted extent of digestion of dietary materials did not differ
   between species in Expt 1, despite lower concentrations of ammonia in
   rumen fluid in cattle than buffaloes; however in Expt 2, the rate of
   digestion of rice straw was higher (P < 0.05) and predicted extent of
   digestion was 14-20 \% (P < 0.05) lower in buffaloes. Digestibility of
   cell wall constituents was lower (P < 0.05) in buffaloes than in cattle
   in both experiments, but in Expt 2, provision of concentrates reduced (P
   < 0.01) the proportion of digestible cell wall constituents digested in
   the forestomach of buffaloes, but not of cattle. Plasma urea
   concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) and transfer of urea to the rumen
   tended to be higher (7-4 v. 3.7 g N/day; P < 0.10) in buffaloes. Faster
   fractional outflow rates of microbes and of small digesta particles from
   the rumen were observed in buffaloes in Expt 1.
   In Expt 1, more microbial N left the abomasum (35 v. 30 g per kg organic
   matter apparently digested in the forestomach; P < 0.05) of buffaloes
   than cattle, and in Expt 2 more non-ammonia N (43 v. 31 g per kg organic
   matter apparently digested in the forestomach) flowed into the
   intestines of buffaloes. In Expt 1 microbial retention time was shorter
   (26 v. 47 h; P < 0.01) in the rumen of buffaloes.
   Patterns of appearance of plastic particles with time after dosing
   indicated faster escape from the rumen of buffaloes of non-chewed
   particles, and a greater proportion of particles subjected to ruminative
   chewing, than in cattle. Ruminative chewing of plastic particles in
   buffaloes was progressively more efficient than in cattle with
   increasing particle length and decreasing specific gravity. Analysis of
   faecal particle distribution indicated buffaloes tended to excrete
   smaller particles than cattle.
   The adaptive significance of faster digesta passage in the buffaloes
   appeared to derive from a more balanced supply of absorbed protein
   relative to digestible energy.},

Abstract = {Agroforestry systems (AFS) in general and silvipastoral systems (SPS) in
   particular, have been studied intensively in Brazil since the 1980's.
   The majority of the research work has been conducted in the wet tropical
   Amazon region, in the semi-arid conditions of the Northeast, and under
   subtropical soil and climatic conditions in the Southeast or in the
   South. Research emphasis has been placed on interactions between the
   main components of AFS: tree, pasture, soil and microclimatic elements.
   Evaluation of animal performance in SPS generally has not been the main
   objective of experiments. A recent survey of research on SPS using
   Eucalyptus spp. in Brazil, showed that only 6.5\% of the references in
   such articles pertained to the productive performance of sheep and beef
   cattle under grazing (Couto et al., 1998). In the Tropics, the native
   rain forest is the most important arboreal substrate, because it has to
   be preserved for environmental and biodiversity maintenance.
   Accordingly, research has focused on identification of either native or
   exotic timber tree/palm tree species to be used in SPS. At the present
   time, SPS using species of Pinus, rubber tree, mango tree, brazilian
   chestnut tree and coconut tree are common in this region. Brachiaria
   brizantha cv. Marandu, B. humidicola, Paspalum atratum BRA-009610,
   Desmodium ovalifolium CIAT-350, Pueraria phaseoloides BRA-0612 and
   Centrosema macrocarpum CIAT-5065 are some of the shade tolerant forage
   species showing promise for SPS in the Amazon region. In the Caatinga
   ecosystem, in the Northeast, research has shown that browsing of native
   shrubs associated with the utilization of Leucaena leucocephala protein
   bank and/or buffelgrass pasture allows substantial increases of
   liveweight gain or milk production by sheep, goats and dairy cows. In
   the Southeast region, in Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo states, SPS consist
   mainly in the association of Eucalyptus spp and Panicum maximum. Studies
   involving two-year-old eucalypt plantations showed that sheep or beef
   calves grazing P maximum cv. Coloniao allowed from 52 to 93\% reduction
   of forest establishment and maintenance costs, as a result of selling
   animal products and reduction of grass competition by grazing. In the
   South, the most important exotic arboreal materials are Eucalyptus,
   Pinus and Acacia species, while Mimosa scabrella and Araucaria
   angustifolia are potential useful native trees. Species of Trifolium and
   annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) mixtures have been used as
   cool-season pastures while P. maximum cultivars and B. brizantha cv.
   Marandu are used as warm-season pasture grasses. Beef calf liveweight
   gains on SPS consistently outyielded those obtained by grazing the
   native pasture in full sunlight, at two locations in Rio Grande do Sul
   state.
   Although there is a reasonable amount of information on the
   establishment and management of SPS within each ecoclimatic brazilian
   region, the level of adoption of this new technology at the farm level
   is still considered very low. The benefits and possible eventual adverse
   consequences of the tree x pasture association on animal production,
   along with a discussion of the future prospects of research and
   potential adoption of SPS in Brazil are addressed in this paper.},

Abstract = {Conversion of tropical forest ecosystems to agricultural land use can
   have drastic impact on quality of natural waters as related to temporal
   changes in the sediment load and concentrations of dissolved nutrients.
   Long-term experiments were conducted in two phases to assess seepage
   acid runoff water quality changes from an Alfisol owing to changes in
   land use in a sub-humid region of southwestern Nigeria. Phase I, from
   1978 to 1981, studied the impact of deforestation and tillage methods,
   and Phase II, from 1982 to 1987, evaluated the impact of cropping
   systems and soil restorative practices. The six treatments evaluated in
   Phase I, involving combination of deforestation and tillage methods,
   were: (1) manual clearing (MC) with no-till (NT); (2) MC with plow-till
   (PT), which involved plowing to about 20 cm depth followed by harrowing;
   (3) shear blade (SE) clearing with NT; (4) treepusher-rootrake (TP)
   clearing with NT; (5) TP clearing with PT: (6) traditional farming (TF)
   involving slash-and-burn agriculture without use of fertilizer and
   amendments. The TF treatment was discontinued during Phase II.
   Therefore, the five treatments evaluated in Phase II were: (1) alley
   cropping with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit planted on the contour
   at 4 m interval; (2) restorative fallowing with mucuna (Mucuna utilis
   Lam.) on severely degraded soil; (3) mucuna fallowing on moderately
   degraded watersheds; (4) ley farming, involving establishment of
   pastures and grazing, on severely degraded watersheds; (5) ley farming
   on moderately degraded watersheds. Pastures included a mixture of Guinea
   grass (Panicum maximum Jacq.) and centro (Centrosema pubescens Benth).
   All treatments were imposed on watersheds of 2-4 ha each, and were
   replicated twice. Each watershed was equipped with a rate measuring
   H-Flume, a water stage recorder, a runoff sampler and a storage tank. In
   addition, a single lysimeter was installed in each treatment to monitor
   crop water use and nutrient transport in seepage water.
   Sediment concentration in water runoff was measured for both phases
   whereas nutrient concentrations in runoff and seepage waters were
   measured in Phase II only. Land clearing and tillage methods affected
   sediment concentration in runoff water. Mean sediment concentration
   during the first season after deforestation was 5.5gl(-1) for MC and
   9.7gl(-1) for TP. Within the NT system, mean sediment concentration was
   4.0 gl(-1) for MC, 3.9 gl(-1) for SE, and 8.0 gl-1 for TP. Sediment
   concentration was also low for NT compared with PT, 5.3gl(-1) vs.
   9.1gl(-1). Alley cropping decreased sediment concentration under maize
   (Zea mays L.) from 2.5gl(-1) to 0.44gl(-1) Mean sediment concentration
   was 4.3gl(-1) under maize and 0.2gl(-1) under cowpea (Vigna unguiculata
   L. Walp) with alley cropping, compared with 1.4gl(-1) under maize and
   0.04gl(-1) under cowpea grown after pastures. There were seasonal and
   cropping system effects on sediment concentration. Both alley cropping
   and mucuna cover decreased sediment concentration. Nutrient
   concentration in runoff was influenced by cropping systems treatments,
   and was higher without than with alley cropping. Although the total
   runoff was less, nutrient concentration was greater in water runoff from
   pastures and mucuna fallow than from maize. The maximum nutrient
   concentrations were much higher in seepage water than in surface runoff.
   Manual clearing, no-till, alley cropping and use of cover crops
   decreased transport of sediments and dissolved elements in surface
   runoff and seepage water.},

Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {123},

Abstract = {Short term preference for five tree fodders by cattle was assessed by
   their chemical composition, as well as in situ and in vitro gas
   production, in two studies. In study 1, five heifers (341 36 kg
   liveweight) were offered Brosimun alicastrun (BA), Piscidia piscipula
   (PP), Leucaena leucocephala (LL), Lysilonza latisiliquum (TL) and
   Guazwna ulmifolia (GU) in a 6h `cafeteria' study over 5 consecutive
   days. In study 2, the same 5 heifers and tree fodders were used, but
   each heifer was offered a single tree fodder and fresh Taiwan grass
   (Pennistetum purpureum) ad libitum for 6 h. After 6 It, refusals were
   weighed and, for the rest of the day, only Taiwan grass was offered ad
   libitum. Forages offered in both studies were analyzed for dry matter
   (DM), crude protein, ash, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre,
   lignin, total polyphenols and condensed tannins, as well as for in situ
   DM degradation (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h) and in vitro gas
   production (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96 and 120
   h). In situ degradability was fitted to the equation p = a + b(1
   -e(-ct)), while the equation gas = GV(1 + (B/t)(c-1)) was used for in
   vitro gas production. Residues from in vitro gas production were used to
   estimate in vitro DM and organic matter digestibility. Relationship
   between tree fodder intake, chemical composition, and in situ and in
   vitro digestibility was assessed using Pearson correlation analysis. In
   study 1, tree fodder intake (g DM/kg LW0.75) was: PP 5.41, TL 5.62, LL
   15.62, GU 17.31 and BA 55.36 (S.E.D. 1.63). Intake was correlated with
   lignin (Pearson coefficient, -0.898, P=0.039), IVDMD (r=0.916, P=0.029)
   IVOMD (r=0.902, P=0.036), parameter `b' and `c' from in situ
   degradability (r = 0.926, P=0.034 and r = 0.926, P=0.024, respectively)
   and with the 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96h measurements, as well as parameter
   GV from in vitro gas production (r= 0.873, P=0.053) and 12, 15, 18, 21,
   24, 30, 36 and 48 h cumulative gas readings. In study 2, tree fodder
   intake (g DM/kg LW0.75) was: PP 17.74, TL4.08, LL 22.18, GU 13.47 and BA
   38.56 (S.E.D. 0.52). Grass intake (g DM/kg LW0.75) during the same time
   was: 79.41, 89.64, 87.69, 86.30 and 77.43 (S.E.D. 0.83) when PP, TL, LL,
   GU and BA, respectively, was offered. Total DM intake (in 6 h) increased
   (P<0.05) when LL and BA were offered. Tree fodder intake was related to
   IVDMD (r=0.950, P=0.013), IVOMD (r=0.942, P=0.017), parameter `c' from
   in situ degradability (r=0.908, P=0.033) and 12 and 24h measurements, as
   well as parameter GV from in vitro gas production (r=0.910, P=0.032)
   and3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 2 1, and 24 h cumulative gas readings. As feed
   preference is a short term response, lignin might be an indicator of
   intake preference. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Condensed tannin (CT) can dramatically reduce the utilisation of protein
   in ruminants. However, at low levels (<3-6\% DM) it is hypothesised that
   CT can be advantageous. The ability of CTs to protect protein in the
   rumen could increase the flow of bypass protein and, provided they do
   not reduce the flow of microbial protein, increase the total supply of
   protein for absorption. To assess these hypotheses, the effect of
   inactivating tannins by treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the
   nutritive value of Leucaena leucocephala (K636) was assessed. In
   addition, three other Leucaena species (L. trichandra CPI 46568, L.
   pallida CQ 3439, L. collinsii OFI 51/88) were compared to L.
   leucocephala (K636). All Leucaena species were fed fresh to sheep in
   metabolism crates. Purified CTs from the Leucaena species were assessed
   for their abilities to bind protein in vitro. Also measured was the
   ability of the CTs to release previously complexed protein, between the
   abomasum and end of the small intestine in sheep. The high CT Leucaena
   species (L. trichandra CPI 46568 and L. pallida CQ 3439) were associated
   with poor retentions and apparent digestibilities of N, and lower dry
   matter digestibilities, compared to the lower tannin L. leucocephala
   (K636) and virtually tannin devoid L. collinsii. The CT content (i.e.,
   untreated v. PEG treated) of L. leucocephala (K636) enhanced its ability
   to supply protein to the abomasum (1.003 v. 0.635 g/g N intake, pooled
   s.e. = 0.138, P < 0.10) by increasing the amount of feed protein that
   bypassed the rumen (0.499 v. 0.077 gig N intake, pooled s.e. = 0.138, P
   < 0.10) without inhibiting the supply of microbial protein (0.554 v.
   0.558, pooled s.e. = 0.043, P > 0.10). Part of the advantageous effect
   of L. leucocephala (K636) CTs on the delivery of protein post-rumen may
   be attributed to their weaker ability to bind protein, especially at
   abomasal pH. On a g/g basis, purified L. leucocephala (K636) CT had
   approximately half the binding power of L. pallida (CQ 3439), L.
   trichandra (CPI 46568), Lotus pedunculatus (cv. Maku) and Acacia aneura
   CTs at pH 5, and no measurable binding at pH 2.5, in vitro. There was
   also an indication that L. leucocephala CT was better able to release
   protein between the abomasum and end of the small intestine than L.
   pallida (CQ 3439) and Acacia aneura CT. L. leucocephala (K636) may be an
   example of a forage with a CT fraction that stimulates a better than
   expected supply of protein to ruminants. However, the authors, and
   others, have been unable to directly link enhanced protein flow to
   enhanced N retention. It is postulated that this lack of translation is
   because gains in protein delivery are offset by enhanced losses of
   endogenous protein due to interactions between CT and proteolytic
   enzymes and/or the gut wall distal to the rumen. The data indicate a
   promising future for L, leucocephala (K636) and L. collinsii (51/88)
   forage in productive feeding systems for ruminants in the tropics. In
   contrast, L. pallida (CQ 3439) and L. trichandra (CPI 46568), whose
   protein availabilities are dramatically inhibited by CT, should not be
   recognised as valuable protein supplements.},

Abstract = {In the development of short fallow systems as alternatives to shifting
   cultivation in West Africa, a long-term trial was established at the
   International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) on an Alfisol in
   the forest-savanna transitional zone of southwestern Nigeria, comparing
   three fallow systems; natural regrowth fallow, cover crop fallow and
   alley cropping on soil productivity and crop yield sustainability. The
   natural fallow system consisted of natural regrowth of mainly
   Chromolaena odorata shrub as fallow vegetation. The cover crop fallow
   system consisted of Pueraria phaseoloides, a herbaceous legume as fallow
   vegetation. The alley cropping system consisted of woody hedgerows of
   Leucaena leucocephala as fallow vegetation. The fallow lengths were 0
   (continuous cropping), 1, 2 and 3 years after 1 year of maize/cassava
   intercropping. Biomass produced from natural fallow and cover crop
   fallow was burnt during the land preparation. Fertilizer was not applied
   throughout the study. Without fertilizer application, maize yield
   declined from above 3.0 t ha(-1) to below 0.5 t ha(-1) during 12 years
   of cultivation (1989-2000) on a land cleared from a 23-year old
   secondary forest. Temporal change in cassava tuber yield was erratic.
   Mean maize grain yields from 1993-2000 except for 1999 were higher in
   cover crop fallow system (1.89 t ha(-1)) than in natural fallow system
   (1.73 t ha(-1)), while natural fallow system outperformed alley cropping
   system (1.46 t ha(-1)). During the above 7 years, mean cassava tuber
   yield in cover crop system (7.7 t ha(-1)) did not differ from natural
   fallow system (8.2 t ha(-1)), and both systems showed higher cassava
   tuber than the alley cropping system (5.7 t ha(-1)). The positive effect
   of fallowing on crop yields was observed for both crops in the three
   systems, however, insignificant effects were seen when fallow length
   exceeded 1 year for cover crop and alley cropping, and 2 years for
   natural fallow. Soil pH, organic carbon, available P and exchangeable
   Ca, Mg and K decreased considerably after 12 years of cultivation, even
   in a 3-year fallow subplot. After 12 years, soil organic carbon (SOC)
   within 0-5 cm depth in alley cropping (13.9 g kg(-1)) and natural fallow
   (13.7 g kg(-1)) was higher than in cover crop fallow (11.6 g kg(-1)).
   Whereas significant increase in SOC with either natural fallow or alley
   cropping was observed only after 2 or 3 years of fallow, the SOC in the
   1-year fallow alley cropping subplot was higher than that in continuous
   cropping natural fallow subplot. It can be concluded from our study that
   in transforming shifting cultivation to a permanent cropping, fallow
   with natural vegetation (natural fallow), herbaceous legumes (cover crop
   fallow) and woody legumes (alley cropping) can contribute to the
   maintenance of crop production and soil fertility, however, length of
   fallow period does not need to exceed 2 years. When the fallow length is
   reduced to 1 year, a better alternative to natural regrowth fallow would
   be the cover crop for higher maize yield and alley cropping for higher
   soil organic matter. For fallow length of 2 years, West African farmers
   would be better off with the natural fallow system.},

Abstract = {This study aims to determine cases of animal toxicosis attributed to the
   consumption of a particular plant species. The study was conducted in 12
   areas namely Pigcawayan, Aleosan, Carmen, Kabacan, Columbio, Pres.
   Quirino, Tacurong, Isulan, Tantangan, Tupi, Polomolok and General
   Santos. A total of 131 respondents were interviewed. Face to face
   interview was done on selected respondents. A semi-structured
   questionnaire was used which include cases of toxicosis due to
   consumption of specific forage. A total of 11 plant-related toxicosis
   were recorded based on the observation and experience of goat raisers.
   The most common case is diarrhea due to overconsumption of Gmelinaleaves
   (29\%). Other toxicity cases recorded were attributed to the consumption
   of Chromolaenaodorataleaves Phaseoluslunatusleaves (12\%),
   Vignaradiatafruit (3\%) and overconsumption of
   Leucaenaleucocephala(3\%), Saccharumspontaneum(3\%) and
   Manihotesculenta(3\%). Rangeland where these goats are raised is
   dominated with these plants which increases the possibility of
   consumption, thus, enhances cases of toxicosis. The result of the study
   reflects the necessity of establishing proper feeding ratio and
   management can be done to eliminate the toxic effects if some of these
   plants will be used as feed for goats.},

Abstract = {Twelve herbaceous and shrub legume species were grown in pot and field
   experiments in five sites representing three agroecological zones in
   moist savanna in Nigeria. The objectives were to: (1) assess natural
   nodulation of the legumes and characterize their indigenous rhizobia,
   (2) determine their need for rhizobia inoculation and (3) estimate the
   amount of N-2 fixed by each of these legumes. At 4 weeks after planting
   (WAP), Crotolaria verucosa was not nodulated at any of the sites while
   Centrosema pascuorum had the highest number of nodules in all sites. At
   8 WAP, all legumes were nodulated, with Mucuna pruriens having the least
   number of nodules and Stylosanthes hamata the highest. The number of
   nodules, however, was inversely correlated to the mass of nodules.
   Significant differences in nodulation of the legume species grown in the
   field also occurred between and within sites. Mucuna pruriens and Lablab
   purpureus produced more shoot and nodule biomass than the other legumes
   in all sites. Growth of most of these legumes responded to fertilizer
   application, except for C. verrucosa and Aeschynomene histrix. Except
   for C. verrucosa, average proportion of N-2 fixed was about 80\% and
   this was reduced by about 20\% with N fertilizer application. The
   majority of rhizobia isolates (60\%) were slow growing, belonging to the
   Bradyrhizobia spp. group. Selected rhizobia isolates evaluated on
   Cajanus cajan, C. pascuorum, M. pruriens and Psophocarpus palustris
   varied from ineffective to highly effective in Leonard jar conditions.
   However, only growth of M. pruriens responded to inoculation in potted
   soils, whereas it was lower than that obtained with N fertilizer
   application. This indicated the need to screen more rhizobia in order to
   improve N-2 fixation and growth of legume species such as M. pruriens
   when it is introduced in soils deficient in N.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aim: The study was conducted to evaluate eight tree leaves based on
   polyphenolic content and rumen in vitro incubation and gas production
   technique (RIVIGPT) for their nutritive potentiality.
   Materials and Methods: Eight selected tree leaves, namely Sesbania
   grandiflora, Melia dubia, Dillenia spp., Artocarpus heterophyllus,
   Commiphora caudata, Moringa oleifera, Leucaena leucocephala, and Acacia
   auriculiformis, were selected for proximate composition, forage fiber
   fractions, total phenolics (TPs), non-tannin phenols (NTPs), total
   tannins (TTs), condensed tannins (CTs), and hydrolysable tannins (HTs);
   RIVIGP with and without polyethylene glycol (PEG); and in vitro dry
   matter digestibility (IVDMD) (modified in vitro two stage) analysis was
   conducted. On the basis of RIVIGPT, the in vitro digestible organic
   matter (IVDOM) and dry matter intake (DMI) was calculated.
   Results: Crude protein (CP) content of tree leaves ranged from 9.59 to
   25.81\%, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) 28.16 to 53.33\%, acid detergent
   fiber (ADF) 21.26 to 41.7\%, acid detergent lignin (ADL) 3.62 to
   21.98\%, TP 1.83 to 17.35\%, TT 0.40 to 15.47\%, and CTs 0.02 to
   15.26\%. IVDMD (\%) was ranged from 64.95 to 88.12. The mean
   metabolizable energy (ME) (MJ/Kg) of tree leaves estimated with and
   without PEG was 7.75 +/- 0.56 and 8.75 +/- 0.39, in vitro gas production
   at 24 h (IVGP(24)) (ml) 31.06 +/- 4.14 and 37.09 +/- 2.64, initial gas
   production (a) (ml) 0.49 +/- 0.63 and 1.33 +/- 0.72, potential gas
   production (D) (ml) 38.74 +/- 4.27 and 43.79 +/- 2.44, rate of gas
   production (k) (h(-1)) 0.11 +/- 0.02 and 0.11 +/- 0.013, t(1/2) (ml)
   9.81 +/- 2.41 and 7.42 +/- 0.80, in vitro gas production at 96 h
   IVGP(96) (ml) 39.50 +/- 4.430 and 45.14 +/- 2.65, the predicted IVDOM
   (\%) 55.44 +/- 4.15 and 61.98 +/- 3.03, and DMI (g/Kg W-0.75) 103.1 +/-
   14.76 and 104.3 +/- 10.16, respectively. The addition of PEG showed an
   improvement in IVGP(24), IVGP(96), ME, predicted IVDOM, and predicted
   DMI. CP was positively correlated with ME, IVGP(24), IVGP(96), a+b, k
   (r=0.749, p<0.05), IVDMD, IVDOM, and DMI (r=0.838, p<0.05) and
   negatively correlated with a and t(1/2). NDF, ADF, and ADL contents were
   negatively correlated with ME (r=0.899, p<0.05), IVGP(24) (r=-0.867,
   p<0.05), IVGP(96) (r=-0.858, p<0.05), a+b (p<0.05), k (r=-0.828,
   p<0.05), IVDMD, IVDOM (r=-0.853, p<0.05), and DMI and positively
   correlated with a and t(1/2). TP, TT, and CT were negatively correlated
   with ME, IVGP, IVGP(96), a+b, k, IVDMD, IVDOM, and DMI and positively
   correlated with a (r=0.808, p<0.05)and t(1/2). ME (MJ/Kg) was positively
   correlated with IVGP(24) (r=0.938, p<0.05), IVGP(96) (r=0.875, p<0.05),
   a+b (r=0.813, p<0.05), k (r=0.731, p<0.05), IVDMD, IVDOM (r=0.985,
   p<0.05), and DMI (r=0.727, p<0.05) and negatively correlated with a and
   t(1/2).
   Conclusion: In the present study, the potentiality of tree leaves was
   assessed based on CP, ADF, ADL, TP, CT, IVGP, ME, IVDMD, predicted
   IVDOM, and predicted DMI. Based on this, it can be concluded that S.
   grandiflora, M. dubia, M. Oleifera, and L. leucocephala were graded as
   best; A. heterophyllus and C. caudata as moderate; and Dillenia spp. and
   A. auriculiformis as lowest potential ruminant feed.},

Abstract = {There is increasing interest to improve the N-2 fixation and P use
   efficiency of herbaceous and shrub legumes currently being introduced in
   cereal-based cropping systems in the moist savanna zones of West Africa.
   Knowledge about N and P nutrition of these legumes can assist in
   adapting them to new areas where fertilizer use is not feasible by the
   smallholder farmers. Pot and field experiments were carried out to
   examine variation among potential herbaceous and shrub legumes for their
   ability to nodulate and to use P efficiently. These legumes were grown
   at two P levels (0 and 7 kg P ha(-1)) in soils collected from two fields
   with different cropping histories (compound and degraded fields) at
   Yamrat in the northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria. In the compound field,
   animal manure and household residues are applied annually whereas in the
   degraded field, cereals are grown continuously with minimal organic
   inputs. Significant differences in growth, P content and mycorrhizal
   infection rate occurred among the different legumes as affected by P and
   cropping history. Legumes grown in soil from the degraded field
   responded more to P application than those grown in soil from the
   compound field. Phosphorus responsive legume species e.g. Mucuna
   pruriens var. utilis (black seed) and Crotolaria ochroleuca, had a low
   mycorrhizal infection rate compared to lower P responsive species such
   as Lablab purpureus and Cajanus cajan. A significant relationship was
   found between mycorrhizal infection rate and plant growth but not with
   nodulation of these legumes. All legumes nodulated naturally and the
   proportion of N derived from atmospheric N, ranged from 38\% for
   Centrosema brasilianum to 90\% for L. purpureus. Application of P
   increased the weight of nodules but did not improve the proportion of
   N-2 fixation. This study showed that species such as L. purpureus has a
   high N-2 fixing capability and can also adapt to low P soils conditions
   in the northern Guinea savanna of West Africa.},

Abstract = {The effect of spacing between plants (1, 2 and 4 plants/m) and frequency
   of harvesting (2, 3 and 4 times/year) on the production of tagasaste
   grown in hedges, was measured for 4 years following establishment. In
   the first 2 years, yield per metre of hedge increased with reduced
   spacing between plants; in the third and fourth years, however, there
   was little difference in the yields of the 2 closest plantings which
   still out-yielded the sparsest planting (1 plant/m).
   Total annual yields of both dry matter and `edible' dry matter were
   greatest with only 2 harvests per year, but there was very little
   difference between yields from 3 or 4 harvests per year.
   With a spacing of 4 plants/m and 2 harvests per year, total annual dry
   matter yields of over 4.5 kg/m of hedge were achieved in the third and
   fourth years after establishment. Approximately 66\% of the forage
   harvested was considered edible with this level of production. Pasture
   production adjacent to the hedges was generally unaffected by the
   tagasaste hedges. The protein content, digestibility and production of
   the tagasaste warrants further testing of its performance in larger
   scale plantations, rather than in isolated hedges.},

Abstract = {A nursery essay was carried out in La Canada de Urdaneta, Venezuela to
   evaluate the effect of different levels of fertilization on dry matter
   production of Acacia mangium plants. The treatments applied were: 45, 30
   and 20 and 90, 60 and 40 mg/plant of NPK, respectively; 45, 30, 20 and 1
   mg/plant of NPK + Mo, 45, 30, 20 and 4 000 mg/plant of NPK + Ca, 45 and
   30 mg/plant of NP, 45 and 20 mg/plant of NK, 30 and 20 mg/plant of PK,
   45 mg N/plant, 30 mg P/plant, 20 mg K/plant and the control. A
   completely randomized design was used. The indexes were dry weights of
   leaves, stem s' roots leaf:stem dry weights ratio and the ratio of the
   dry weight of the aerial and radicular part. Fertilization significantly
   affected (P < 0.01) leaf dry weight and the treatment of 90, 60 and 40
   mg/plant of NPK shaved the highest value (2.97 g/plant). Fertilization
   had a significant effect (P < 0.01) on stem dry weight, being the
   highest weight (0.67 g/plant) the application of 45, 30 and 20 mg/plant
   of NPK + Mo. Root dry weight was affected (P < 0.01) by fertilization,
   and the highest value was with 30 and 20 mg/plant of PK (2.85 g/plant).
   The ratio leaf :stem dry weights was significantly affected by the
   treatments (P < 0.01), that of 30 and 20 mg/plant of PK produced the
   highest ratio (6.50). The treatments significantly(P < 0.01) affected
   the aerial :root dry weight ratio and the highest was with 45 and 30
   mg/plant of N and P (3.06). These results show that the lack of
   nutrients reduced growth indicators and vigour of plants and the growth
   of the aerial radicular system on transplanting. Studies on the
   depressive effect of Ca in the presence of N, P and K on growth are
   warranted.},

Title = {Soil fertility in contour hedgerow systems on sloping oxisols in
   Mindanao, Philippines},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {159-167},
Month = {MAR 22},
Abstract = {Although contour hedgerows are widely advocated to sustain food crop
   production in cereal-based farming systems in the tropics, little is
   known about the nutrient dynamics of these systems or the spatial
   gradients in soil fertility that may develop in the terraces that evolve
   behind the vegetative barriers. We studied the effects on soil chemical
   properties of four contour hedgerow systems: double rows of a tree
   legume Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) (G); a row of G, sepium and a row of a
   native pasture grass Paspalum conjugatum (GPas); a row of G, sepium and
   a row of a productive fodder grass Penisetum purpureum (napier grass)
   (GPen); and a double row of P. purpureum (Pen). An open-field control
   (C) without hedgerows was included. The research was conducted in
   Mindanao, the Philippines on two Oxisols (Ferralsols) with slopes
   ranging from 20\% to 30\%; average alley width was 4.7 m and the average
   hedgerow width was 0.8 m. The prunings of Gliricidia were mulched on the
   alley (food-crop planting) area, the clippings of Penisetum were removed
   from the plots, and no pruning was done for Paspalum. Crop residues were
   distributed uniformly on the alley area as mulch. Each of the two crops
   in the rotation, rice (Oryza sativa L.) and corn (Zea mays L.), received
   20 kg ha(-1) each of P and K and 60 kg ha(-1) of N. After 4 years of
   experimentation exchangeable Mg was about 40\% lower in the Pen
   treatment compared to that in the C treatment. There was a tendency for
   the Pen treatment to have the lowest exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg and
   Bray-2 extractable P Exchangeable Ca and Bray-2 P increased while
   exchangeable AI decreased linearly with a decrease in soil elevation in
   the alleyways in the hedgerow treatments, although these gradients were
   not always significant at the p = 0.05 level. Exchangeable K decreased
   linearly with the decrease in the soil elevation in the Pen treatment (p
   = 0.12). The use of Penisetum grass as hedgerow crop and at the same
   time for supplying fodder, mined the soil nutrients indicating that the
   system is unsustainable unless accompanied by fertilization or manuring.

Abstract = {Leaf of Gliricidia sepium contains high amino acid that required for
   protein synthesis in the muscle. Supplementation of the legume leaves to
   low quality basal diet would improves amino acids amount to obtain an
   optimum growth of animal. The aim of experiment was to investigate the
   effect of Gliricidia sepium leaves supplementation to low quality basal
   diet on protein synthesis in muscle of animal. Eighteen sheeps were
   divided into three groups based on live weight (27.6 +/- 1.72, 27.1 +/-
   2.26 and 27.5 +/- 1.56 kg) of feed treatment, namely Mitchell grass hay
   (MG), Gliricidia (GS), and hay combined with Gliricidia (MGGS). All the
   diet was offered with the amount was determined to meet the maintenance
   metabolizable energy (ME) requirement of the animals. Feed utilization
   and amino acid metabolism in muscle of sheep was measured with
   radioactively labeled leucine, water and sodium bicarbonate. Results
   indicated that sheep in MG group had a negative energy balance, whereas
   sheep in MGGS group had the highest amount of ME available for growth.
   The rate of protein synthesis was higher in the MGGS group and tended to
   take up these amino acids in their hind-limb muscles, while animals in
   MG and GS groups tended to have net outputs of amino acids from their
   hind-limb muscles. Animals in the MGGS group synthesised more protein in
   their muscle than those in the GS and MG groups. It was concluded that
   the supplementation of Gliricidia at a ratio of 40: 60 improved feed
   utilization of low quality basal diet. The improvement would be
   manifested in better digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) with
   subsequent better utilization of amino acids. (C) 2018 Atom Indonesia.

Abstract = {Pruning of hedgerow trees is an important management practice for the
   successful establishment of an alley cropping system. Although pruning
   affects biomass production, only meager evidence of this management on
   distribution of nutrients among the different plant organs after tree
   regrowth is available. This study examined the effect of pruning on the
   distribution and use efficiency of N and P in a N-2 fixing leguminous
   tree species, Gliricidia sepium, and two non-N-2 fixing leguminous tree
   species, Senna siamea and S. spectabilis, grown in a field on an Alfisol
   (low in P) at Fashola (Guinea Savanna Zone), Southwestern Nigeria. Four
   P rates, 0, 20, 40 and 80 kg P ha(-1) as single superphosphate were used
   and management treatments included pruned versus unpruned plants. The
   N-15 isotope dilution technique was used to measure N-2 fixation in G.
   sepium. Partitioning of total P among different plant organs was
   influenced by plant species and pruning management, but was not affected
   by P application rates. The distribution of total P in the various plant
   organs followed that of dry matter yield while N partitioning had a
   different pattern. Pruned plants distributed about 118\% more total P to
   branches and had a higher physiological P use efficiency (PPUE) than
   unpruned plants. Leaves were the biggest sink for total N and N
   allocation in the other plant organs was influenced by plant species and
   pruning management. G. sepium had relatively more of its total N and P
   partitioned into roots (about double that of the non-N-2 fixing trees)
   but had a lower PPUE. Unpruned-and pruned G. sepium derived 35 and 54\%
   respectively of their total N from atmospheric N2, with about 54\% of
   the fixed N2 being allocated to leaves and roots. Results showed that N
   and P pools turned over in the branches during plant regrowth after
   pruning but the causative factors associated with this phenomenon were
   not clear.},

   in low P soils},
Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1994},

Abstract = {Identification of tree species or cultivars/provenances that are
   tolerant to low levels of available soil P will decrease the dependence
   on P fertilizer for the good establishment and growth of N2-fixing
   trees. The effects of phosphorus uptake and use efficiency on N2
   fixation and growth of provenances of Gliricidia sepium were determined
   in the greenhouse and also under field conditions. Three selected
   provenances out of 23 provenances that had in an earlier experiment been
   examined at low and high P levels (20 mg and 80 mg P kg' soil) were
   further studied at four levels of P application in the greenhouse at
   IITA, Ibadan using an Alfisol collected from Fashola. The field
   experiment was conducted at Fashola (Guinea Savanna Zone), southwestern
   Nigeria. Large differences in growth occurred among the G. sepium
   provenances at both low and high P levels. Growth responses of the three
   provenances to increasing P levels were linear in the pot experiment but
   variable (linear and quadratic) in the field experiment. Field data show
   that the growth of one provenance (G1) did not respond to P application
   while provenance G3 required 80 kg P ha' to achieve maximum biomass.
   Provenance G2 responded to P application up to 40 kg P ha-1 and further
   addition of P depressed its growth, P uptake and N2 fixation. The
   results of the pot experiment were not completely duplicated in the
   field experiments. Differences between G. sepium provenances to P uptake
   and growth were largely related to differences in physiological P use
   efficiency and root length, especially at low P, both in the pot and
   field experiments. In general, nodulation was improved by P application,
   but varied among provenances. G. sepium fixed approximately 61\% and
   40\% of its N from atmospheric N2 in pot and field, respectively. The
   percentage of N fixed was affected by the low rate of P application i.e.
   20 kg P ha-1 and at high rates of P, no further increase in percentage
   N2 fixed occurred.},

Abstract = {The variation in P uptake and use efficiency and N accumulation by
   Gliricidia sepium (N-2-fixing tree), Senna siamea and S. spectabilis
   (leguminous non-N-2-fixing trees) were examined in the field at Fashola

   80 kg P ha(-1). Growth of G. sepium and S. spectabilis responded to P
   application at 24 weeks after planting (WAP) and average yield increases
   of 58\% and 145\% were observed by the application of 40 kg P ha(-1) for
   the two species, respectively. Such a P response was not found in S.
   siamea at 24 WAP and for any of the species at 48 WAP. G. sepium
   accumulated more P (on average 162\%) than S. siamea and S. spectabilis
   at 24 WAP and had greater root length and a higher percentage of
   mycorrhizal infection. However, at 48 WAP S. siamea had 2.5 times more P
   than G. sepium. Differences in the physiological P use efficiency (PPUE)
   between G. sepium and the non-N-2-fixing trees were significant at the 0
   P level, being higher for S. siamea (average, 0.61 g shoot mg(-1) P)
   than for G. sepium (0.27 g shoot mg(-1) P). G. sepium had a consistently
   lower atom \% N-15 than S. spectabilis, while that of S. siamea for most
   of the time did not differ from that of G. sepium. The reference plant
   affected N-2 fixation extimates, with negative values and a higher
   variability (CV 60\%) associated with S. siamea than with S. spectabilis
   (CV<20\%). Consequently, S. spectabilis was selected as a better
   reference plant for measuring N-2 fixation in G. sepium. G. sepium fixed
   on average 35\% and 54\% of its N at 24 and 48 WAP, respectively. Except
   at the lowest P rate, percentage and amount of N fixed were not

Abstract = {The biological performance of phytophagous organisms and bioregulators
   in an area of lysiloma for animal shade was studied to determine its
   influence on the balance between the phytophagous organisms and the
   bioregulators. The research was developed for three years ill cattle
   rearing areas of the Institute of Animal Science ill Cuba. The
   experimental procedure was the populational sampling of arthropods. A
   General Linear Model was used with the year and season factors for the
   data analysis. Also, the space distribution of the organisms was
   determined through the test of goodness of fit divided by(2). The
   results showed that Heteropsylla cubana and Empoasca sp are the
   phytophagous insects of highest incidence, although the values did not
   Surpass 0.5 average individual s/m(2). Chrysoperla sp., Pheidole
   megacephala, Brachimeria sp., and Peucetia viridians were among the
   bioregulators. The season was not significant for the organisms under
   Study. However, the year factor showed differences (P < 0.001), both for
   H. cubana and Empoasca sp. and for the bioregulators. The collected
   species of highest incidence had a space distribution of the Contagion
   Type. It is concluded that a scarce number of arthropod, phytophagous
   and beneficial species cohabitated in the area of Lysiloma bahamensis
   control ling pests and, thus, not producing economic harms. This
   performance may be related to the chemical composition of the plant,
   which should be demonstrated in further Studies. It is recommended to
   promote the use of lysiloma as shade trees to improve the comfort of the

Abstract = {In north-eastern India, the hot humid climate favours luxuriant weed
   growth that results in reduction of crop yield. Field evaluation was
   carried out for two consecutive years in four agroforestry systems on
   the occurrence and distribution dynamics of weed flora. The four systems
   were compared simultaneously with the traditional abandoned jhum (AJh)
   and agricultural crops (sole). The four agroforestry systems (AFS)
   investigated were mandarin (Citrus reticulata), alder (Alnus
   nepalensis), cherry (Prunus cerasoides) and albizia (Paraserianthes
   falcataria) with different cropping systems. Among the six systems
   compared, it was observed that the number of weed species remained
   consistently higher in the abandoned jhum, followed by the sole crop and
   was least in the four AFS with the number of perennial weed species
   being higher in the former than in the latter. Annual weeds
   (therophytes) dominated the four AFS and sole crop situations with the
   density of weeds like Ageratum conyzoides, A. haustonianum, Bidens
   pilosa and Galinsoga parviflora being high during the cropping season.
   In the abandoned jhum situation, perennial grass species like
   Arundinaria bengalensis, Imperata cylindrica and Digitaria sanguinalis
   were dominant. Weed biomass was lower in the AFS due to regular soil
   working, intercultural operation and competition of resources with the
   associated crops. Species diversity (R) of both grasses and herb species
   was highest in the AJh situation over the four seasons. Among the four
   AFS, the mandarin based AFS had a higher species diversity compared with
   the sole crop situation. Ordination by Correspondence Analysis (COA)
   indicated that the occurrence of weeds across seasons varied among the
   systems due to the higher abundance of one or more weed species. The
   weed species showed fluxes in their abundance patterns which are linked
   with the spring and rainy season. The study indicates that weed
   infestation could be greatly reduced under suitable agroforestry systems
   in north-eastern India which in turn can contribute to enhancement of
   crop yields and provide additional benefits to farmers by way of fruits,
   firewood, and soil amelioration and at the same time protect the
   environment.},

   diet (negative control) supplemented with dried leaves from four
   herbaceous legumes: Macrotyloma axillare cv. Archer(MAA), Stylosanthes
   scabra cv. Seca (SSS) and Neonotonia wightii cv. Mpwapwa (NWM); or with
   Fish meal (FM) as positive control in a 6x6 Latin square design. All
   treatments with protein were formulated to provide the same energy and
   protein levels of intake. The digestible organic matter intakes were
   13.9, 13.6, 14.2, 13.8 and 13.6 g per kg body weight (BW) per day in
   treatments supplemented with MAA, SSS, FM and NWM respectively and these
   were similar(P > 0.05) but significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared to
   the negative control. The crude protein contents of the DM consumed
   ranged from 8.6 to 9.5\% among the supplemented diets and these were
   higher than the unsupplemented treatment of only 3.9\%. Nitrogen intake,
   faecal nitrogen output, urinary nitrogen output and nitrogen balance
   were significantly higher (P < 0.001) ir. the supplemented diets
   compared with the negative control. For the negative control treatment,
   nitrogen balance was 0.09 g per kg W-0.75 whereas N balance ranged from
   0.19-0.32 g per kg W-0.75 in the other treatments. The ranking was: FM >
   SSS > MAS > MAA > NWM but they were not significantly different from
   each other. Only when calculated as percent N retained, was FM superior
   to NWM (P < 0.05). It is concluded that using leaves from these legumes
   as protein supplements will have an effect on N balance in growing
   Mpwapwa bulls comparable to fish meal. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {A complete random design was used to assess the effect of the

   with grasses (mixture of natural pastures) in the whole area on the
   microbial rumen Population, specifically on mimosine and 3 hydrohy-4
   (1H) pyridone degrading bacteria. Therefore, twenty-seven bulls of 147
   kg of average LW were randomly selected. The treatments were: (A)
   grasses, (B) grasses + 30\% of the area of L. leucocephala, and (C) L.
   leucocephala associated at 100\% with grasses. All the animals were fed
   also sugarcane and mineral salts ad libitum. The population of
   cellulolytic bacteria was of 2.93, 3.67, and 6.83 x 10(6) cfu/mL for A,
   B, and C, respectively. The inclusion of grazing in L. leucocephala did
   not modify the population of total viable bacteria, but the protozoa
   were reduced in 3.20 and 2.74 times when including 30 and 100\% of L.
   leucocephala, respectively. The mimosine and 3,4-DHP degrading bacteria
   were counted on the order of 10(6) cfu/mL, without differences between

   grasses in 100\% of the area did not vary the population of bacteria
   degrading mimosine and 3-4 DHP and, at the same time, increased the
   cellulolytic microorganisms and reduced the effect on the protozoa

Title = {Toxicology of Non-Protein Amino Acids},
Booktitle = {AMINO ACIDS IN HIGHER PLANTS},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {507-537},
Abstract = {The appearance of a wide range of non-protein amino acids in foliage,
   fruits, seeds and root exudates is an important expression of secondary
   metabolism in higher plants. The ubiquitous distribution of these amino
   acids is exemplified by their presence in food and forage plants as well
   as in temperate and tropical species. Canavanine occurs widely in
   legumes such as Canavalia ensiformis, Medicago sativa, Gliricidia
   sepium, Dioclea megacarpa and Robinia pseudocacia. Significant
   concentrations of the selenoamino acids and of S-methylcysteine
   sulfoxide are present in Brassica oleracea, including broccoli, cabbage,
   Brussels sprouts and kale. In contrast, the signalling agonists
   beta-N-oxalylamino-L-alanine and beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine occur in
   unrelated species, namely Lathyrus sativus and Cycas circinalis,
   respectively, while gamma-aminobutyrate accumulates in plants in
   response to biotic and environmental stimuli. The aromatic amino acid,
   mimosine, occurs primarily in Leucaena leucocephala, a tropical legume
   yielding timber and prolific quantities of palatable forage. Of all the
   non-protein amino acids cited in this chapter, hypoglycin is unique in
   its natural distribution; two forms, hypoglycin A and its glutamyl
   derivative, hypoglycin B, occur in the arils of the unripe fruit of
   Blighia sapida.
   Representative examples of non-protein amino acids have been selected
   for review to emphasize the relationship between allelochemical activity
   and toxicity in diverse living organisms. Canavanine and its metabolites
   in the canaline-urea cycle share striking structural analogy with
   corresponding amino acids in the ornithine-urea cycle. Additive and
   synergistic phytotoxic effects of canaline-urea cycle amino acids are
   reversed by their respective analogues in the ornithine-urea cycle. A
   similar canavanine-arginine antagonism has been demonstrated in insects
   and higher animals. Equally noteworthy are the structural analogues of
   the sulfur amino acids. On replacement of the sulfur atom with selenium,
   a wide range of congeners are formed, notably selenomethionine,
   Se-methylselenocysteine and Se-allylselenocysteine. It is universally
   recognized that the selenoamino acids are toxic to both plants and
   animals, their effects being characterized by inability to thrive.
   Selenoamino acids interfere with cellular biochemical reactions, and
   methionine status decreases with the accumulation of tissue
   selenomethionine in plants. Another analogue, S-methylcysteine
   sulfoxide, is associated with haemolytic anaemia in ruminant animals.
   Both beta-N-methylamino-l-alanine and gamma-aminobutyrate affect plant
   development; however, in humans, the former amino acid, together with
   beta-N-oxalylamino-l-alanine, have been implicated, respectively, in
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinsonism-dementia (or Guam
   dementia) and in neurolathyrism. The phytotoxicity of mimosine is now
   unequivocal and with wide-ranging effects, including inhibition of seed
   germination, root growth, lignification and key enzymes. Mimosine is
   also detrimental to animals, but the effects in ruminants are modulated
   by differences in microbial ecology. In contrast, hypoglycin is
   specifically associated with the seasonal incidence of a human disorder
   known as `vomiting sickness'.
   The adverse effects of non-protein amino acids are mediated via diverse
   mechanisms generally consistent with unifying principles of
   allelochemical activity and metabolic mimicry. Canavanine competes with
   arginine for cellular transport and in the modulation of nitric oxide
   synthesis. In addition, canavanine may replace arginine in protein
   synthesis, enhance arginase activity and depress polyamine synthesis.
   Selenium analogues of the sulfur amino acids act by competing with
   methionine and cysteine at the levels of transport and protein
   synthesis. Both beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine and
   beta-N-oxalylamino-L-alanine operate as potent glutamate receptor
   agonists. The allelochemical action of mimosine has been linked with
   inhibition of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and peroxidase. This diversity
   of mechanisms has been compared with the complex mode of action of the
   xenobiotic non-protein amino acid, beta-aminobutyric acid.
   The phytotoxic effects of canavanine and associated metabolites are
   reversed by respective analogues in the ornithine-urea cycle. In
   animals, deleterious effects may be substantially reduced through
   controlled feeding of forages containing toxic non-protein amino acids
   or by provision of appropriate nutritional supplements. Under commercial
   conditions, substantial-mitigation has been achieved by the manipulation
   of rumen function to metabolize mimosine to innocuous residues.
   The emerging consensus confirms that non-protein amino acids and their
   associated derivatives display considerable potential as plant
   protectants and as models for the development of novel pharmaceuticals.
   However, it is imperative that food safety and medicinal efficacy are
   not compromised in the quest for diversification. It is also essential
   that any ecological risks associated with the commercial exploitation of
   these compounds are minimized.},

Title = {Effects of mimosine administered to a perfused area of skin in Angora
   goats},

Volume = {75},

Abstract = {The effect of mimosine on a perfused area of skin tissue was studied
   using an isolated perfusion technique. Four mature Angora wethers (body
   weight 35 (se 2.3)kg) were cannulated bilaterally with indwelling
   silicone catheters in the superficial branches of the deep circumflex
   iliac artery and vein. Mimosine (40 mg/kg metabolic weight (W-0.75) per
   d) was infused intra-arterially into one iliac artery of each goat for 3
   d and saline was infused in the contralateral (control) iliac artery.
   Iliac venous blood samples were taken from both sides along with
   arterial samples from the carotid artery. Mimosine infusion elevated
   plasma mimosine in the carotid artery (52.6 (SEM 19.21) mu mol/l) and
   iliac vein on the saline-treated side to 54.1 (SEM 16.31) mu mol/l and
   in the iliac vein on the mimosine-treated side to 191.3 (SEM 19.14) mu
   mol/l (P < 0.01). Mimosine decreased feed intake (2.3 v. 0.6kg/d, SEM
   0.29; P < 0.001) and water consumption (5.2 v. 1.3 litres/d, SEM 0.67; P
   < 0.001). Mimosine did not cause defleecing in the area of infusion and
   was cleared from the bloodstream within 12 h of cessation of infusion.
   The following effects were also observed during mimosine infusion:
   decrease in plasma amino acids to half pre-infusion values (methionine
   22.7 v. 13.1 mu mol/l, SEM 1.41; lysine 95.9 v. 37.4 mu mol/l, SEM 4.28;
   P < 0.001); decreases in plasma triiodothyronine (1495 v. 695 ng/l, SEM
   43.1; P < 0.001), thyroxine (61.5 v. 19.5 mu g/l, SEM 1.8; P < 0.001)
   and insulin (28.7 v. 17.3 mu IU/ml, SEM 189; P < 0.01) concentrations;
   increase in plasma cortisol (14 v. 62 mu(g/l, SEM 0.35; P < 0.001)
   concentration; decreases in levels of plasma Zn and Mg (0.97 v. 0.49
   mg/l, SEM 0.063; P < 0.001 and 21.4 v. 14.6 mg/l, SEM 1.74; P < 0.001
   respectively). All reported variables returned to their normal values 24
   h after cessation of mimosine infusion except feed intake which was
   affected for a longer period. Mohair length and diameter were not
   affected by mimosine infusion. The toxicity of mimosine may be due to
   the drastic depletion of Zn and Mg in the blood as mimosine possesses
   very strong chelating properties and is excreted in the urine as a
   chelate.},

Abstract = {The study was conducted on the Agua Turva Stream bank, in the
   Hydrographic Microbasin of the Jirau Alto River, in Dois Vizinhos
   county, Parana state, aiming to evaluate the environmental impacts of
   the urban occupations and agricultural activities on the floristic
   composition and the phytosociological structure of the arboreal stratum
   of the riparian forest, to obtain information on species diversity and
   biological invasion, which will enable the establishment of future
   forest restoration programs. The data collect was realized in ten sample
   points demarcated along the stream, where 20 sample plots of 10.0 x 10.0
   m (100.0 m(2)) were demarcated, 10 in each stream margin. The species
   were identified and evaluated regarding the following variables: the CAP
   (Circumference at Breast Height) and total height of all the trees with
   CAP >= 15.0 cm (DBH >= 4.8 cm). The vegetation structure was analyzed
   based on the phytosociological estimators and the indexes of diversity,
   equability and environmental impact index of exotic species. It was
   concluded that the riparian forest of the Agua Turva creek is quite
   impacted, both in the rural and urban areas, with invasion of exotic
   species, mainly Hovenia dulcis (japanese grape) and Musa sp. (banana
   tree).},

   showed negative balance, whereas in the field with biomass incorporation
   a high positive N-balance was found. Concerning phosphorus, positive
   balances were determined in plots without biomass incorporation,
   however, the uptake of P increased significantly after biomass
   incorporation in all crops used. The results indicate that pigeonpea

Title = {Naturalized alien flora of the world: species diversity, taxonomic and
   phylogenetic patterns, geographic distribution and global hotspots of
   plant invasion},
Journal = {PRESLIA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {89},
Number = {3},
Pages = {203-274},
Abstract = {Using the recently built Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF)
   database, containing data on the distribution of naturalized alien
   plants in 483 mainland and 361 island regions of the world, we describe
   patterns in diversity and geographic distribution of naturalized and
   invasive plant species, taxonomic, phylogenetic and life-history
   structure of the global naturalized flora as well as levels of
   naturalization and their determinants. The mainland regions with the
   highest numbers of naturalized aliens are some Australian states (with
   New South Wales being the richest on this continent) and several North
   American regions (of which California with 1753 naturalized plant
   species represents the world's richest region in terms of naturalized
   alien vascular plants). England, Japan, New Zealand and the Hawaiian
   archipelago harbour most naturalized plants among islands or island
   groups. These regions also form the main hotspots of the regional levels
   of naturalization, measured as the percentage of naturalized aliens in
   the total flora of the region. Such hotspots of relative naturalized
   species richness appear on both the western and eastern coasts of North
   America, in north-western Europe, South Africa, south-eastern Australia,
   New Zealand, and India. High levels of island invasions by naturalized
   plants are concentrated in the Pacific, but also occur on individual
   islands across all oceans. The numbers of naturalized species are
   closely correlated with those of native species, with a stronger
   correlation and steeper increase for islands than mainland regions,
   indicating a greater vulnerability of islands to invasion by species
   that become successfully naturalized. South Africa, India, California,
   Cuba, Florida, Queensland and Japan have the highest numbers of invasive
   species. Regions in temperate and tropical zonobiomes harbour in total
   9036 and 6774 naturalized species, respectively, followed by 3280
   species naturalized in the Mediterranean zonobiome, 3057 in the
   subtropical zonobiome and 321 in the Arctic. The New World is richer in
   naturalized alien plants, with 9905 species compared to 7923 recorded in
   the Old World. While isolation is the key factor driving the level of
   naturalization on islands, zonobiomes differing in climatic regimes, and
   socioeconomy represented by per capita GDP, are central for mainland
   regions. The 11 most widely distributed species each occur in regions
   covering about one third of the globe or more in terms of the number of
   regions where they are naturalized and at least 35\% of the Earth's land
   surface in terms of those regions' areas, with the most widely
   distributed species Sonchus oleraceus occuring in 48\% of the regions
   that cover 42\% of the world area. Other widely distributed species are
   Ricinus communis, Oxalis corniculata, Portulaca oleracea, Eleusine
   indica, Chenopodium album, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Stellaria media,
   Bidens pilosa, Datura stramonium and Echinochloa crus-galli. Using the
   occurrence as invasive rather than only naturalized yields a different
   ranking, with Lantana camara (120 regions out of 349 for which data on
   invasive status are known), Calotropis procera (118), Eichhornia
   crassipes (113), Sonchus oleraceus (108) and Leucaena leucocephala (103)
   on top. As to the life-history spectra, islands harbour more naturalized
   woody species (34.4\%) than mainland regions (29.5\%), and fewer annual
   herbs (18.7\% compared to 22.3\%).
   Ranking families by their absolute numbers of naturalized species
   reveals that Compositae (1343 species), Poaceae (1267) and Leguminosae
   (1189) contribute most to the global naturalized alien flora. Some
   families are disproportionally represented by naturalized aliens on
   islands (Arecaceae, Araceae, Acanthaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae,
   Convolvulaceae, Rubiaceae, Malvaceae), and much fewer so on mainland
   (e.g. Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Boraginaceae). Relating the numbers
   of naturalized species in a family to its total global richness shows
   that some of the large species-rich families are over-represented among
   naturalized aliens (e.g. Poaceae, Leguminosae, Rosaceae, Amaranthaceae,
   Pinaceae), some under-represented (e.g. Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae),
   whereas the one richest in naturalized species, Compositae, reaches a
   value expected from its global species richness. Significant
   phylogenetic signal indicates that families with an increased potential
   of their species to naturalize are not distributed randomly on the
   evolutionary tree. Solanum (112 species), Euphorbia (108) and Carex
   (106) are the genera richest in terms of naturalized species;
   over-represented on islands are Cotoneaster, Juncus, Eucalyptus, Salix,
   Hypericum, Geranium and Persicaria, while those relatively richer in
   naturalized species on the mainland are Atriplex, Opuntia, Oenothera,
   Artemisia, Vicia, Galium and Rosa. The data presented in this paper also
   point to where information is lacking and set priorities for future data
   collection. The GloNAF database has potential for designing concerted
   action to fill such data gaps, and provide a basis for allocating
   resources most efficiently towards better understanding and management
   of plant invasions worldwide.},

Abstract = {The trend of using wood biomass as a renewable energy source must be
   supported by a more extensive feedstock through the utilization of
   degraded land. However, not all regions have information on land
   potential in the provision of wood biomass. This study aims to develop a
   system dynamic model that can describe the potential of wood biomass
   production from degraded land rehabilitation. The main steps include
   problem identification, mapping causal loop diagrams, integrating
   mathematical models in a stock and flow diagram, evaluating the model,
   and simulating the conditions in the next 20 years based on existing
   conditions and three alternatives of policies scenarios. The result
   showed that all scenarios able to reduce the degraded land area by 16\%.
   Energy wood plantations can reduce the number of unemployed by half of
   the simulated amount while applying a moderate, optimistic, or very
   optimistic scenario, the number of unemployed will only be a quarter
   left in 2040. The optimistic scenario was considered to be applied in
   the rehabilitation of degraded land. The expected goals must be
   supported by the use of superior seedlings and effective forestry
   extension by increasing the number of extension officers and extension
   assistants.},

Abstract = {The main constraints in the ruminant production systems in the tropics
   are low availability and quality of forage during the dry season. An
   alternative that could mitigate the lack of food during periods of
   scarcity is the use of trees/shrubs in fodder banks. However, the growth
   and production response of these plants may be influenced by several
   factors. The aim of the study was to evaluate the total height of
   plants, forage yield and crude protein (CP) concentration of Morus alba
   and Gliricidia sepium in mixed and pure fodder bank systems with three
   planting densities (i.e., 10,000, 13,333 and 20,000 plants ha(-1)). A
   completely randomized design with a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement was
   used, with four replicates per treatment. The total height of plants was
   similar among fodder banks. However, G. sepium and mixed fodder banks
   had a greater forage yield (5.48 and 5.50 t DM ha(-1), respectively) and
   more CP concentration (20.07 and 20.41\%, respectively) than M. alba
   fodder banks. There was no significant effect of planting densities on
   total height of plants, forage yield and CP concentration, in fodder
   bank systems. There was no significant effect of interaction between
   fodder banks and planting densities on total height of plants and forage
   yield. However, the CP concentration was greater in the M. alba and
   mixed fodder banks in three planting densities, together with G. sepium
   fodder bank in a density of 10,000 plants ha(-1), compared to G. sepium
   fodder banks at planting densities of 13,333 and 20,000 plants ha(-1).
   We conclude that the mixed fodder bank of M. alba and G. sepium can
   increase the production and forage quality of the system.},

Abstract = {To study the effect of mineral supplementation on 2,3-DHP toxicity, 16
   mature Angora wethers were randomly allocated to four treatment groups
   (M, DM, D and C). Two hours after the morning feeding; group M received
   a mineral mixture of 2 g of Fe-2(SO4)(3) . 7H(2)O, 2 g of MgSO4 . 7H(2)O
   and 2 g of ZnSO4 . 7H(2)O intraruminally in 80 mt of water; group DM
   received a similar mineral mixture plus 6 g of 2,3-DHP (DHP chelated
   with metal ions), group D received 6 g of 2,3-DHP in 80 mt of water and
   group C received 80 mt of water. In group D, two animals died within 24
   h of receiving DHP and the other two animals were sacrificed to prevent
   suffering. Ruminal concentration of DHP was approximately 18 X higher in
   group D than in group DM (2.8 vs. 0.16 mmol L(-1); P < 0.05) 4 h
   following treatment. Plasma DHP concentration, 6 h post treatment, was
   lower in group DM than in group D (15.2 vs. 85.9 nmol mL(-1), P < 0.05).
   Urinary excretion of 2,3-DHP was much faster in group DM than in group D
   (P < 0.05), Plasma triiodothyronine in group D was lower (110 vs. 211 ng
   dL(-1); P < 0.05) than in group DM.
   It appears that mineral supplementation prevented 2,3-DHP toxicity.
   Faster urinary excretion of chelated 2,3-DHP suggests that 2,3-DHP must
   be chelated to be efficiently transported and cleared by the kidney.},

Abstract = {Response of Faidherbia albida (Del.) to five levels of Kodjari rock
   phosphate (KRP) application (0, 310, 620, 1240 and 2480 ppm P,
   equivalent to 0, 775, 1550, 3100 and 6200 kg P/ha) and
   vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (VAMF) Glomus manihotis Howeler,
   Sieverding \& Schenck or Glomus aggregatum Schenck \& Smith emend. Koske
   was evaluated in an alkaline sandy soil. The F. albida seedlings grew
   poorly without mycorrhizal colonization and without KRP applications.
   For non-VAM Faidherbia, the maximum growth response and both P and N
   uptake in shoots was achieved with the 620 ppm P. However, even without
   KRP application, VAM plants achieved better results in terms of biomass.
   VAM plants with G. manihotis and G. aggregatum improved plant growth and
   increased nutrient contents at any KRP application rate. Although
   mycorrhizal colonization was comparable at all levels of KRP
   application, the impact of nutrient content of the shoot varied.
   Finally, VAM plants did not accumulate more biomass than non-VAM plants
   at 620 ppm P and above. Growth response and mycorrhizal dependency
   decreased as KRP applied levels increased. These results suggest that
   VAM Faidherbia seedlings take up more P from soil and KRP than non-VAM.},

Journal = {PLANT AND SOIL},

Volume = {179},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The severity and increase of the Imperata cylindrica constraint as a
   weed, the decline of the traditional fallow systems as a means of soil
   fertility management and the lack of inorganic fertilizer appear to have
   created opportunities for adoption of mucuna (Mucuna pruriens)
   technology by smallholder farmers in some areas in the derived savanna
   of West Africa. What is not known, however, is the extent to which the
   establishment and N contribution of mucuna in these areas depend on
   symbiotic properties such as effective nodulation and mycorrhizal
   infection. Short term surveys carried out in 34 farmer's arable fields
   located in four different sites in the derived savanna, southern Benin,
   West Africa, together with results of greenhouse and field experiments
   showed that mycorrhizal infection rate of mucuna ranged from 2 to 31\%
   and correlated positively with nodulation and shoot dry matter
   production. Nodulation occurred in 79\% of the fields with numbers of
   nodules ranging from 0 to 135 plant(-1). Mucuna responded both to
   inoculation and N fertilizer in degraded soils but growth response
   depended on the rhizobia strains and mucuna varieties. Mucuna
   accumulated in 12 weeks about 313 kg N ha(-1) as either a sole crop or
   166 kg N ha(-1) when mixed/intercropped with maize, respectively. Across
   all cropping systems it derived an average of 70\% of its N from
   atmospheric N-2 (estimates made by the N-15 isotope dilution method),
   representing 167 kg N ha(-1) per 12 weeks in the field. Mucuna
   interplanted with maize obtained a greater proportion of its nitrogen
   (74\%) from fixation than did mucuna grown alone (66\%) suggesting that
   competition for soil N influences the proportion of nitrogen fixed by
   mucuna. The total amount of N-2 fixed per hectare was, however, reduced
   significantly by intercropping mucuna with maize. A preceding mucuna
   crop provided a maize yield equivalent to 120 kg N kg ha(-1) of
   inorganic N fertilizer.},

Journal = {SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-42},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A growth trial of 120 days duration was conducted on 16 crossbred lambs
   less than 6 months of age to study the replacement value of subabul leaf
   meal (SLM) for a costly and commonly used mustard cake (MSC). Lambs were
   divided into four groups (four lambs per group) that received a
   concentrate mixture providing 40\% of the CP requirement. The remaining
   60\% was met through groundnut cake (GNC; T1), MSC (T2) and SLM to
   replace 50 (T3) or 75\% (T4) of CP supplied by MSC. In addition, lambs
   consumed ad libitum a dried grass mixture. Dietary inclusion of SLM did
   not deleteriously affect nutrient or energy utilization. Intakes of DM,
   DCP and ME were similar among treatments, ranging from 69.7 to 78.7 g,
   3.82 to 4.49 g and 149.1 to 151.8 kcal kg BW0.75 day(-1), respectively.
   Apparent digestibilities (\%) of DM, OM, CP, EE, NDF, ADF and cellulose
   tended (p>0.05) to be lower, but N balance (g day(-1)) tended (p>0.05)
   to be increased by SLM. The intake and concentration of ME in the total
   diet ranged from 1256 to 1296 kcal day(-1) and 1.88 to 2.15 kcal g(-1),
   respectively and were comparable among treatments. Average daily gain
   (g) was similar among treatments (73, 65, 75 and 73 g day(-1) for T1,
   T2, T3 and T4, respectively; Pooled SE, 8.72). However, feed cost per kg
   of weight gain for T4 was 19\% less than for control diets (i.e. TI and
   T2). Concentration of plasma protein and urea N in blood did not differ
   significantly among the treatments, but glucose concentration (mg
   dl(-1)) was lower (p<0.05) for T1 (56.01) than for T2 (62.21), T3
   (61.01) and T4 (61.59) treatments. It was concluded that SLM can safely
   and inexpensively replace part of MSC in growing lamb diets. (C) 1999

Abstract = {Nine provenances of Gliricidia sepium were evaluated to identify the
   most productive when managed under alley cropping at Kawinga in
   Machinga, Malawi. Individual provenances constituted plots arranged in
   randomized block design with six replications. One year after
   establishment, survival of the provenances ranged between 82 and 97\%,
   whereas height and diameter varied between 1.6 and 2.2 m and 16.7 and
   23.5 mm respectively. Wood basic density ranged between 393 and 450 kg  
   M-3, whereas average above ground biomass for the 3 year period varied
   between 7.0 and 10.9 t ha-1 per year. Foliar nutrient content varied
   from 2.58 to 3.15\% (nitrogen), 0.17 to 0.20\% (phosphorus), 0.98 to
   1.77\% (potassium), 1.56 to 2.97\% (calcium), 0.67 to 2.55\% (magnesium)
   and 0.04 to 0.05\% (sodium).
   Although biomass production between provenances varied significantly
   only at certain lopping stages, within-provenance variations were
   noticed throughout in all the traits assessed. Such variations indicate
   that both provenance and individual tree selection methods can be used
   in the genetic improvement of G. sepium for specific agroforestry uses.
   The overall most productive provenances were Retalhuleu (14/84),
   Pontezuela Bolivar (24/86), Volcan Suchitan (13/84) and Francisco
   (37/85) provenances. These provenances are therefore recommended for
   further testing to address appropriate agroforestry requirements in
   different agroecological zones.},

Abstract = {Droughtmaster steers from the CSIRO Research Station at Lansdown, 50 km
   south of Townsville, Queensland, were assessed at slaughter for
   indications of leucaena toxicity and the presence of the 3,4
   dihydroxypyridine (DHP)-degrading bacterium Synergistes jonesii. This
   bacterium had been introduced to the herd 25 years earlier. Absence of
   clinical signs of ulceration of the oesophagus, absence of DHP in the
   urine, the presence of normal thyroid glands and the ability of rumen
   fluid to degrade high levels of mimosine from leucaena shoot tips in
   vitro all confirmed that these steers had an active bacterial culture
   capable of degrading mimosine and its degradation products 3,4 and 2,3
   DHP. Steers had been away from the Research Station and away from
   leucaena pastures for long periods but had clearly not lost the bacteria
   or if they had, they had regained them on return to leucaena pastures on
   Lansdown. It is postulated that the bacteria may spread via the faeces
   in cattle yards and remain in the rumen for long periods, even at low
   levels, in the absence of leucaena in the diet. Reasons other than the
   effectiveness of the bacterium should be explored to explain the failure
   of cattle in some Queensland herds to fully degrade 3,4 and 2,3 DHP.},

Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},

Abstract = {Co-inoculation of microorganisms has been frequently used to promote
   greater plant growth in degraded soils. However, the use of this
   biotechnological strategy for the revegetation of soils contaminated by
   heavy metals in mining areas is still poorly understood. In our study,
   we analyzed the influence of the co-inoculation of rhizobia and
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the initial growth of Mimosa
   caesalpiniaefolia and its tolerance to excessive manganese (Mn) in a
   soil degraded by mining. In an experiment in a greenhouse, the species
   M. caesalpiniaefolia was cultivated to evaluate the establishment
   potential considering the contribution of the co-inoculation of rhizobia
   and AMF together or in isolation. In addition, we use control plants,
   under ideal levels of nutrients. Co-inoculated plants showed greater
   tolerance to excessive Mn and had their initial growth stimulated. The
   highest mycorrhizal colonization rate (64\%) was observed in the
   treatment with AMF alone, while the highest abundance of AMF spores in
   the soil (419.7) was found when the plants were co-inoculated. In
   addition to favoring the balance of nutrients in the plant and the use
   of nitrogen and phosphorus from the soil, co-inoculation also provided
   higher levels of Mn in the roots and lower levels of Mn in the shoot.
   Morphological and physiological changes, which helped the plants to
   withstand the excess of Mn in the soil, were also evidenced when they
   were co-inoculated. Taken together, our results suggest that
   co-inoculation in M. caesalpiniaefolia regulates toxicity, maximizes
   early growth, and increases tolerance to excessive Mn in soils degraded
   by mining.},

   Green leaves of C. macrostachyus had significantly higher nutrient

   leaves had significantly higher ( P< 0.05) C, N and P and significantly
   lower ( P< 0.05) lignin and polyphenol concentrations than abscised
   leaves. Fifty percent of the biomass applied was lost during the first 7
   weeks in C. macrostachyus, which was about 3 times faster than that of
   M. ferruginea. The half-lives of N and P were 5 - 8 weeks and 4 - 6
   weeks, respectively, in C. macrostachyus; the corresponding values for

   ferruginea. Generally, leaves with higher initial lignin, polyphenol,
   lignin: N and C: N ratios had lower decomposition and mineralization
   rates. In both species, removal of leaf biomass before abscission ( e.

Abstract = {Flemingia macrophylla (Willd.) Merrill is a drought-tolerant, tropical
   multipurpose shrub legume especially suited to low-input smallholder
   production systems, as a dry season forage supplement, live soil cover,
   mulch and living barrier, among others. The diversity of the world
   collection of 70 accessions classified as E macrophylla was assessed
   using 14 morphological and phenological traits, and in terms of
   agronomic and forage potential. One erect and three semi-erect
   morphotypes were identified based on differences in plant height, flower
   and seed colour, inflorescence and peduncle length, and stem pubescence.
   Large variability in dry matter (DM) production (5-586 and 2272 g
   plant(-1) in the maximum and minimum rainfall periods, respectively), in
   vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD, 307-543 g kg(-1)) and crude protein
   content (169-237 g kg(-1)) was measured. The accessions CIAT 18437, CIAT
   21083 and CIAT 21090 were identified as promising in terms of
   productivity and digestibility. Their IVDMD ranged up to 541 g kg(-1) in
   the maximum and up to 507 g kg(-1) in the minimum rainfall period. DM
   yield and IVDMD in the three selected accessions were superior to the
   control CIAT 17403. An exploratory cafeteria grazing trial showed that F
   macrophylla was palatable in the minimum but not consumed in the maximum
   rainfall period. Further morphological studies on inflorescence
   characteristics of herbarium specimens and molecular marker studies are
   warranted to clarify the taxonomic status (subspecies or varieties) of
   the four morphotypes identified. Further development, such as
   palatability studies with a selected set of accessions, can make
   Flemingia a valuable feed alternative. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Mimosine and albizziine are non-protein amino acids produced by certain
   legume species that possess allelopathic activity. Although these
   allelochemicals have exhibited phytotoxicity in some bioassays, all test
   plants were not affected. We tested these compounds at various
   concentrations ( 10(-3) to 10(-5) M) for allelopathic effects on seed
   germination, growth, and greening of weeds and crops: hemp sesbania
   (Sesbania exaltata) and sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia) and wheat
   (Triticum aestivum). We also examined in vitro effects of these
   chemicals on the enzymatic activity of cysteine synthase from sicklepod
   tissue. Mimosine at 10(-3) M reduced germination (by similar to 40\%) in
   both wheat and sicklepod. The greatest growth inhibition occurred, when
   these compounds were supplied via seed imbibition, but some inhibition
   also was noted in root feeding and sprays of the chemicals on seedlings.
   Mimosine and albizziine inhibited chlorophyll development in hemp
   sesbania and sicklepod cotyledons at all concentrations tested.
   Chlorophyll inhibition ranged from 25 to 40 \% for albizziine and from
   20 to 97\% for mimosine. Both compounds caused a small inhibition (10\%)
   of sicklepod cysteine synthase activity. Generally mimosine was the more
   phytotoxic compound.},

Abstract = {Blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon R. Br.) is a species with poor apical
   dominance, and in plantations, silvicultural interventions are required
   to improve stem form. Planting blackwood with a nurse crop and pruning
   to remove large branches and multiple leaders are common methods used in
   blackwood plantations. An experiment was established to determine
   whether applications of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) or magnesium (Mg)
   could also be used to improve stem growth and form. Other aims of the
   experiment were to compare responses of the blackwood and the Pinus
   radiata D. Don nurse crop to fertiliser application, and to identify
   changes in blackwood physiology resulting from fertilising. Application
   of P had a more marked positive effect on blackwood stem growth than
   application of N or the combination of N and P. Mg had no effect on stem
   growth. The response to P may have been related to a substantial
   increase in root nodulation and a 35\% increase in coarse root dry mass.
   Foliar nutrient analysis suggested that these responses led to an
   improvement in plant nutrition. In contrast N application reduced root
   nodulation by 60\%. P application improved stem form in the short term
   by increasing biomass partitioning to stems at the expense of branches.
   However this response was no longer apparent 24 months after
   fertilising, suggesting that frequent applications of P may be necessary
   for long-term improvements in stem form. While light-saturated CO2
   assimilation was increased by applications of N, this was not translated
   into greater biomass production, probably because of shading of many of
   the blackwood crowns by the nurse crop. The P. radiata nurse crop
   responded to fertilising differently to the blackwood, with greatest
   growth increases following application of either the combination of N
   and P or Mg alone. This highlights the need to understand responses to
   fertilising of both blackwood and the nurse crop. The most favourable
   nurse crop:blackwood height ratio was observed following P application,
   meaning that this treatment is the least likely to result in suppression
   of the blackwood by the nurse crop.},

   seed inoculation or application of alginate bead inoculant. A third
   experiment was conducted using filtermud inoculant in Leonard jars and
   unsterilised Muguga nursery soil from Kenya, containing a large
   population of indigenous rhizobia. Application of liquid inoculant to
   seedlings was better than seed inoculation. On the basis of our study,
   we recommend that C. calothyrsus seedlings raised in the nursery should
   be inoculated with a liquid inoculant immediately or soon after

Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Two feeding trials were conducted to study the combined effects of (i)
   varying degrees of selective consumption and (ii) supplementation with
   cowpea (Trail 1) or groundnut haulms (Trial 2), on intake of organic
   matter (IOM) from sorghum stover, and total intake of digestible organic
   matter (IDOM). In both trials, 36 rams were allocated to 36 different
   treatments: six levels of feeding sorghum stover (25, 40, 60, 90, 120
   and 160 g organic matter (OM) kg(-0.75) per day) combined with six
   levels of supplementation (0, 5, 12.5, 20, 40, and 60 g OM kg(-0.75) per
   day). Each diet was offered for a 21 day period; intake and
   digestibility were recorded during the last 9 days. Non-linear
   regression models were used to describe the combined effects of varying
   amounts of stover (x) and supplements (s) offered. All animals ate the
   full amount of supplement offered, but not the sorghum stover For
   animals without supplement, maximum intake (m) of stover (i.e. IOM at
   high levels of x) was estimated at 50.7 g kg(-0.75) per day in Trial 1
   and 45.7 g kg(-0.75) per day in Trial 2. In both trials, m decreased
   linearly with s at the rate 0.4 g g(-1). Also, the shape of the curve
   relating intake of stover to x was affected by level of supplementation.
   Digestibility of whole stover (0.47 in Trial 1; 0.40 in Trial 2) was
   much lower than that of cowpea haulms (0.70) and groundnut haulms
   (0.62), but in both trials animals selected material of higher
   digestibility when excess stover was offered. Thus, the negative effect
   of supplementation on intake of stover was partly compensated by higher
   digestibility of consumed stover. For rations without cowpea in Trial 1,
   the maintenance level of IDOM was reached by offering 61 g sorghum OM
   (kg(-0.75) per day) of which 47 g was consumed. With the same amount of
   offered sorghum 9, 18, 28, 38 and 48 g cowpea OM were needed to attain
   intake levels equivalent to 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 times
   maintenance, respectively. In the trial with groundnut, maintenance was
   not reached with sorghum alone and larger amounts of supplement were
   required for the levels of intake mentioned above. Isoproduction curves
   describing which amounts of stover and supplement gave the same IDOM,
   were not linear with constant slope corresponding to the comparative
   digestibility of whole stover and supplements, but strongly curved. Such
   curves can be used to derive optimum combinations of stover and higher
   quality feeds, depending on feed prices, desired production level and
   taking into account the effects of selective consumption. With prices of
   cowpea and groundnut haulms 4 times higher than that of stover, the
   results of Trial 1 indicate that least cost rations for feeding at 1.2 M
   (maintenance) would consist of 72 g sorghum OM (kg-(0.75) per day)
   combined with 7 g cowpea haulms. For feeding at 1.6 M this would be 70 +
   26 g, and at 2 M, 54 + 50 g. Similarly, with the feeds used in Trial 2,
   optimum combinations of sorghum stover and groundnut haulms for the same
   levels of feeding would be 58 + 24, 51 + 47, and 11 + 78 g OM kg(-0.75)
   per day. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   measured using the N-15 isotope dilution method 12 weeks after planting.
   On average, G. sepium derived 45\% of its total N from atmospheric N2.
   Significant differences in fixation were observed between provenances.
   The percentage of N derived from atmospheric N2 ranged from 26 to 68\%

Abstract = {Assessments of the effects of deforestation, post-clearance tillage
   methods and farming systems treatments on soil properties were made from
   1978 through 1987 on agricultural watersheds near Ibadan, southwestern
   Nigeria. These experiments were conducted in two phases: Phase I from
   1978 through 1981 and Phase II from 1983 to 1987, with 1 year (1982) as
   a transition phase when all plots were sown with mucuna (Mucuna utilis).
   There were six treatments in Phase I involving combinations of land
   clearing and tillage methods: (1) manual clearing with no-till (MC-NT);
   (2) manual clearing with plough-till (MC-PT); (3) shear-blade clearing
   with no-till (SB-NT); (4) tree-pusher/root rake clearing with no-till
   (TP-NT); (5) tree-pusher/root-rake clearing with plough-till (TP-PT);
   (6) traditional farming (TF). The six treatments were replicated twice
   in a completely randomized design. The traditional treatment of Phase I
   was discontinued during Phase II. The five farming systems studied
   during Phase II with a no-till system in all treatments were: (1) alley
   cropping with Leucaena leucocephala established on the contour at 4-m
   intervals; (2) and (3) fallowing with Mucuna utilis on severely degraded
   and moderately degraded watersheds, respectively, for 1 year followed by
   maize-cowpea rotation for another; (4) and (5) ley farming involving
   establishment of pasture in the first year on severely and moderately
   degraded plots, respectively, controlled grazing in the second year, and
   growing maize (Zea mays)-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) in the third year.
   All treatments, imposed on watersheds of 2-4 ha each, were replicated
   twice. The soil properties analyzed were particle size distribution,
   total aggregation and mean weight diameter of aggregates, soil bulk
   density, penetrometer resistance, water retention characteristics,
   infiltration capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. These
   properties were measured under the forest cover in 1978, and once every
   year during the dry season thereafter during Phases I and II. Prior to
   deforestation, mean soil bulk density was 0.72 Mg m(-3) and 1.30 Mg
   m(-3), soil penetration resistance was 32.4 KPa and 90.7 KPa, and mean
   weight diameter of aggregates was 3.7 mm and 3.2 mm for 0-5 cm and 5-10
   cm depths, respectively. The infiltration rate was excessive (54-334 cm
   hr(-1)) and saturated hydraulic conductivity was rapid (166-499 cm
   hr(-1)) under the forest cover. Furthermore, water transmission
   properties varied significantly even over short distances of about 1 m.
   Deforestation and cultivation increased soil bulk density and
   penetration resistance but decreased mean weight diameter of aggregates.
   One year after deforestation in 1980, mean soil bulk density was 1.41 Mg
   m(-3) for 0-5 cm depth and 1.58 Mg m(-3) for 5-10 cm depth. Soil bulk
   density and penetration resistance were generally higher for NT than for
   PT methods, and the penetration resistance was extremely high in all
   treatments by 1985. During Phase II, soil bulk density was high during
   the grazing cycle of the ley farming treatment. Sand content at 0-5 cm
   depth increased and clay content decreased with cultivation duration.
   Soon after deforestation, saturated hydraulic conductivity and
   equilibrium infiltration rate in cleared and cultivated land declined to
   only 20-30 per cent of that under forest. Mean saturated hydraulic
   conductivity following deforestation was 46.0 cm hr(-1) for 0-5 cm depth
   and 53.
   7 cm hr(-1) for 5-10 cm depth. Further, infiltration rate declined with
   deforestation and cultivation duration in all cropping systems
   treatments. During Phase I, mean infiltration rate was 115.
   8 cm hr(-1) under forest cover in 1978, 20.9 cm hr(-1) in 1979, 17.4 cm
   hr(-1) in 1980 and 20.9 cm hr(-1) in 1981. During Phase II, mean
   infiltration rate was 8.5 cm hr(-1) in 1982, 11.9 cm hr(-1) in 1983,
   11.0 cm hr(-1) in 1984, 11.3 cm hr(-1) in 1985 and 5.3 cm hr(-1) in
   1986. Infiltration rate was generally high in ley farming and mucuna
   fallowing treatments. Natural fallowing drastically improved the
   infiltration rate from 19.2 cm hr(-1) in 1982 to 193.2 cm hr(-1) in
   1986, a ten-fold increase within 5 years of fallowing. High-energy soil
   water retention characteristics in Phase I were affected by those
   treatments that caused soil compaction by mechanized clearing and
   no-till systems. Soil water retention at 0.01 MPa potential in 1979 was
   19.2 per cent (gravimetrics) for SE, 17.9 per cent for TP, 15.9 per cent
   for MC and 17.8 per cent for TF methods. With regards to tillage, soil
   water retention was 17.8 per cent for NT compared with 16.8 per cent for
   PT. During Phase II, water retention characteristics were not affected
   by the farming system treatments. Mean soil water retention (average of
   4 years' data from 1982 to 1986) at 0.01 MPa for 0-5 cm depth was 16.6
   per cent for alley cropping, 16.7 per cent for mucuna fallowing and 16.8
   per cent for ley farming. Mean soil water retention for 1.5 MPa suction
   was 9.3 per cent for alley cropping, 8.7 per cent for mucuna fallowing,
   and 9.3 per cent for ley farming. Water retention at 1.5 MPa suction
   correlated with the clay and soil organic carbon content.},

Abstract = {In a world marked by shifting climate patterns, a growing human
   population, and rising demand for ruminant-derived protein, producers
   face the need to implement strategies that enhance productivity, reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), promote adaptability, and improve the
   sustainability of milk and meat production while optimizing resource
   use. One promising strategy to address these challenges is the adoption
   of silvopastoral production systems, which combine livestock with trees
   and shrubs. These systems are widely used in Latin America due to their
   proven benefits in terms of production, reduced emission intensity, land
   utilization efficiency, and other ecosystem services. Transferring
   technology from one region to another necessitates adapting these
   techniques to suit the receiving environment. This review suggests that
   the successful silvopastoral systems employed in the Latin America
   context can be effectively introduced in Nigeria, offering potential
   advantages for livestock owners. The research encompassed in this review
   demonstrates that the utilization of silvopastoral systems in ruminant
   farming can contribute to achieving several sustainable development
   goals, including enhancing food security, increasing milk and meat
   yields, supporting conservation efforts, bolstering biodiversity, and
   reducing GHG emissions. At the level of individual farms, the adoption
   of silvopastoral systems (SPS) can enhance the stability and resilience
   of farmers' livelihoods, boost milk production, facilitate animal
   growth, and improve animal welfare.},

Abstract = {Glomus aggregatum and Acacia mangium were interacted in an acid
   manganese (Mn)-rich oxisol unamended or amended with hydrated lime
   {[}Ca(OH)2] or gypsum (CaSO4) at soil phosphorus (P) concentrations
   considered optimal for mycorrhizal host growth. Vesicular-arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungal (VAMF) colonization as well as VAMF function was
   significantly curtailed if soil was unamended with gypsum or lime. The
   highest mycorrhizal inoculation effect (MIE) was observed in the soil
   treated with gypsum at the rate of 0.32 g of calcium (Ca)/kg followed by
   the limed soil. Higher concentrations of gypsum deleteriously affected
   VAMF infectivity and effectivity. The first increment of gypsum
   compensated for part of the VAMF colonization and for all of the
   mycorrhizal inoculation effect that was lost due to low pH. The better
   MIE observed in the gypsum treated soil compared to that which was
   amended with lime suggests that the sensitivity of the acacia-VAMF
   association to soil acidity was more a function of Ca inadequacy than it
   was of pH or associated increases in Mn concentration.},

Abstract = {A 10-week trial was conducted to evaluate the performance and
   haematological indices of weaned rabbits served fluted pumpkin (T.
   occidentalis) leaves extract (FPLE). Twenty four six-weeks old weaned
   rabbits averagely weighing 507.5 g were matched for weight and sex and
   distributed to four treatments which contained 0, 50, 100 and 150 ml
   FPLE per litre of water for A, B, C and D, respectively, in a completely
   randomized block design. Each treatment was replicated three times. The
   rabbits were fed the same growers diet. Feed and water were served
   ad-libitum. The experiment lasted 10 weeks and the FPLE was offered at 4
   days interval throughout the period of the experiment. The results
   revealed that FPLE was rich in protein and minerals but low in fibre,
   tannin and oxalate, hence a good protein and mineral supplement for
   weaned rabbits during dry season in humid tropical environment. Results
   of final live weight, average body weight gain (ABWG), feed conversion
   ration, protein efficiency ratio (PER), feed cost per kg live weight
   gain, packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (Hb) and white and red blood
   cells were significantly (p<0.05) different among the treatments. The
   ABWG, PER, PCV, Hb and RBC were for the weaned rabbits served 150 ml
   FPLE 1515 g/rabbit, 1.74, 66.33\%, 7.33 g/100 ml and 5.39 x 10(6) L-1
   and for control 930 g/rabbit, 0.85, 58.00\%, 6.83 g/100 ml and 5.02 x
   10(6) L-1, respectively. The aforementioned parameters progressively and
   significantly (p<0.05) increased with increased concentrations of FPLE.
   For improved rabbit production and blood formation, 150 ml FPLE is
   recommended for weaned rabbits as 0-100 ml FPLE had lower performance
   effects in terms of ABWG, PER, RBC and relative cost advantage.},

Abstract = {This study compares the types and density of tree species in continuous
   cultivation farms at the fringe of Ibadan city, Nigeria, with shifting
   cultivation farms in a rural district near the city. Both categories of
   farm are used for cultivating field crops of maize, cassava and yams
   that are intercropped. Tree density is much higher in continuously
   farmed plots at the city outskirts, where tree density averaged 511
   trees/ha compared to 143 trees/ha in shifting cultivation farms in the
   countryside. In spite of the general similarity in tree flora between
   the two categories of farmlands, certain tree species are more abundant
   in one than the other. Gliricidia sepium, an exotic tree legume that
   improves soil fertility, is more abundant on the continuous cultivation
   farms while the oil palm, Elaeis guineensis, is more abundant on the
   shifting cultivation farms. Certain tree species such as Myrianthus
   arboreus, Alchornea laxiflora and Blaghia sapida were restricted to the
   shifting cultivation farms and Trema guineensis to the continuously
   cultivated plots. It seems that the farmers at the urban fringe, having
   eliminated the bush fallow period, depend mainly on trees on the
   farmland, especially G. sepium, for the maintenance of soil fertility,
   as they do not apply fertilizers, while the shifting cultivators retain
   mainly trees of economic and utilitarian importance on their farms. It
   is advocated that the shifting cultivators should preserve more trees as
   farmers at the urban fringe do. This will not only facilitate tree
   regeneration, on which restoration of soil fertility during the fallow
   period largely depends, but also help to conserve soil fertility during
   cropping and to augment farmers' fuelwood supplies. (C) 2001 published

Abstract = {A study was carried out to examine the effect of supplementing
   urea-sprayed maize stover with incremental levels of Tithonia
   diversifolia (Tithonia) forage on dry matter (DM) intake, digestibility
   and live weight changes. Fifteen crossbred bucks were used in a
   completely randomised design for a duration of 7 weeks. The treatments
   comprised of a control: the basal diet (maize stover sprayed with 1\%
   urea) plus 100 g maize germ offered alone or supplemented with: 10 (T1),
   20 (T2), 30 (T3) or 40\% (T4) Tithonia on a dry matter basis. All
   animals were allowed ad libitum access to water and mineral lick.
   Supplementing maize stover with Tithonia resulted in increased total DM
   intake (p < 0.05) from 376.7 (control), to 444.1 (T1), 533.1 (T2), 519.7
   (T3) and 578.9 g/day (T4) but did not significantly (p > 0.05) influence
   the intake of stover. Diet DM digestibility increased with
   supplementation with T3 recording the highest value of 66.5\% which was
   1.0.6\% higher than the control. Supplementation significantly increased
   daily weight gains (p < 0.05). T4 had the highest ADG (43.7 g/day), even
   though there was no difference between T4 and T3 (35.7 g/day). In goats,
   Tithonia should be included up to 30\% of ration on a DM basis for
   optimum production. The higher level of inclusion (40\%) may be used for
   higher total output in terms of meat and' milk but with few animals.},

Abstract = {Chemical composition, in vitro gas production with and without

   Gliricidia sepium and Haematoxylum brasiletto were determined. The
   preference test was run for 15 days: the first 10 days as adaption
   period and the 5 days served as evaluation period. It was conducted in
   ten developing female Creole goats of 6 months old, weighing 14 +/- 2.0
   kg in order to determine goat preference for any of the three foliages.
   Productive performance of 35 male creole kids of 6 months old (14 +/-
   3.0 kg) was also determined by ad libitum feeding of the foliage of the
   tree: the 30 and 15 \% of each of the P. dulce (T1, T2), G. sepium (T3,
   T4), and H. brasiletto (T5, T6) foliages were added to the experiment
   diets, while T7 served as control diet that did not contain any foliage.
   The crude protein (CP), total phenols (TP), condensed tannins (CT),
   IVDMD, and IVOMD were different among the foliages. The PEG determined
   the biological activity of the TP and CT of H. brasiletto. Goats
   preferred to consume the foliage of P. dulce because of its higher
   content of CP and IVDMD and low content of TP and CT. In the productive
   response, dry matter intake (DMI) was higher in kids fed T1 diet and was
   stimulated by higher IVDMD and IVOMD, which resulted in the higher daily
   weight gain (DWG). The contribution with TP and CT of H. brasiletto to
   T5 and T6 and the rejection by the animals of G. sepium in T3 and T4
   explain the negative effects on the DMI and the DWG. Findings of the
   study suggested higher kid performance for P. dulce foliage. Possible
   attributes may include its better CP, low TP and CT, and higher
   digestibility.},

Abstract = {With the soaring cost and scarcity of concentrate feeds worldwide, use
   of un-conventional tree foliages in the animal diets can be effective in
   curtailing the feeding costs to economise livestock production. The
   present experiment was conducted with the aim to assess incorporation of
   Himalayan Elm (Ulmus wallichiana) leaf meal (ELM) as partial replacement
   to conventional concentrate feed mixture (CFM) in total mixed ration
   (TMR) of sheep. In Experiment-I (in vitro study), the effect of graded
   increasing levels (0, 10, 20, 30. 40 and 50\%) of ELM inclusion as
   replacement to CFM constituting 40\% in the basal TMR on nutrient
   degradability was assessed. The results revealed the effective level for
   optimal nutrient degradability at 30\% ELM inclusion. In Experiment-II
   (in vivo study), a feeding trial was conducted for 30 days on sheep (16)
   distributed equally into two groups, offered basal TMR as control (Cont)
   and TMR containing ELM replacing CFM at 30\% level as treatment group
   (ELMG), the level selected based on results of optimum nutrient
   degradability in in vitro assay. Without affecting dry matter and
   organic matter intakes, ELM included diet enhanced crude protein and
   neutral detergent fibre digestibility. Moreover, content and the intakes
   of digestible nutrients were similar between the two groups. with total
   digestible nutrients intake being 56.66\% and 61.88\% more than the
   recommendation in control and ELMG groups, respectively. Animals of both
   the groups were in positive balances of N, Ca and P, though N balances
   (g/d) and live weight gain (g/d) were comparable while Ca and P balances
   (g/d) were higher in ELMG. Cost of production lowered with 35.84\%
   reduction in feed cost per kg live weight gain in ELMG group compared to
   control. It was concluded that 30\% CFM in TMR for sheep could be
   replaced with ELM safely as a sustainable strategy to alleviate the
   conventional feed shortage for profitable sheep rearing.},

   spacings. All relative open ranges (relative interrow open ranges,
   relative interplant open ranges, relative canopy open ranges and
   relative space-volumed open ranges) decreased with increasing age. The
   wider interrow or interplant spacings of trees offered wider (relative)
   interrow or interplant open ranges for intercrops. All of the tree

   nine, spacing 1.5 x 2 x 6 m showed no marked disadvantage in growth
   performance as compared to the other three spacings, but provided wider
   interrow open ranges for intercrops. Starting with tree stands of age
   four years, the yields of interplanted wheat (Triticum aestivum),
   soybean (Glyciae max) and rape (Brassica napus) decreased significantly
   as a result of the decrease of open ranges in tree stands. The yields of

   for milk yield and composition of crossbred dairy cattle. In experiment
   one chemical composition of the two feeds and their dry matter

Title = {A Systematic Analysis of Nutritional and Mineral Composition and
   Toxicity in Acacia Species Leaves},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the present study, the nutritive composition and mineral content of
   the leaves of eight species of Acacia trees were evaluated to assess
   their potential for different purposes, such as food resources for
   ruminants and mineral sources in soils. Caco-2 cells were employed to
   assess cytotoxicity, revealing that the extracts exhibited no cytotoxic
   effects after cellular incubation, suggesting their suitability as an
   alternative animal feed. The leaves proved to be a promising source of
   protein and fiber, offering an alternative to meet the needs of
   ruminants. The protein content differed among species, ranging from
   18.96\% in A. cyclops to 14.04\% in A. melanoxylon. Similarly, fiber
   content varied from 35.52\% in A. melanoxylon to 16.43\% in A. cyclops.
   The species displayed moderate to high levels of minerals, particularly
   concentrations of Ca, P, and K. These values varied among species,
   ranging from 8452.90 to 28,465.31 mg/kg DM for Ca, 309.61 to 1293.82
   mg/kg DM for P, and 5557.24 to 11,475.85 mg/kg DM for K, respectively.
   Each species displayed a distinct profile regarding the analyzed
   parameters, suggesting varied potential for their respective use.
   Additionally, vibrational spectroscopy analysis proved to be a highly
   valuable and dependable method for distinguishing between species.},

Title = {In vitro efficacy of Elephantorrhiza elephantina root
   extracts against adult Paramphistomum cervi in goats},
Journal = {PARASITE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CONTROL},
Year = {2020},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Elephantorrhiza elephantina is a medicinally important plant whose roots
   are used to control gastrointestinal parasites in goats. The use of
   plant-based anthelmintics as potential alternatives to synthetic
   anthelmintics in controlling gastrointestinal worms in ruminants is a
   promising area of research. The study was carried out to ascertain the
   efficacy of E. elephantina in controlling goat trematodes. Standard
   procedures were used to quantify the phytochemicals in the water,
   ethanol and methanol root extracts of E. elephantine. The quantitative
   phytochemical analysis revealed that alkaloids (93.24 +/- 1.68\%),
   condensed tannins (450.52 +/- 0.15 mg CE/ g), flavonoids (803.93 +/-
   0.13 mg QE/g), phenols (476.11 = 0.37 mg GAE/g) and saponins (83.28 +/-
   1.72\%) were present in E. elephantine root extracts. Paramphistomum
   cervi adult worms recovered from the rumen of freshly slaughtered goats
   were used. In vitro screening of ethanol, methanol and water extracts of
   E. elephantine for potential anthelmintic activity against adult P.
   cervi worm motility showed time and dose-dependent significant effects.
   Ethanol extracts showed a highly significant (P < 0.05) inhibition of
   motility (86.67 and 96.67\%) al concentrations 7.5 and 15 mg/ml,
   respectively, after 12 h of treatment, while methanol and water extracts
   exhibited a significant (P < 0.05) inhibition of motility (96.67 and
   66.67\% respectively) at concentration of 15 mg/ml, 16 h post-exposure.
   Our findings confirm the efficacy of E. elephantine in controlling goat
   tremalodes. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Title = {Effect of boiling water, seed coat structure and provenance on the
   germination of Acacia melanoxylon seeds},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {139-147},
Abstract = {Acacia melanoxylon (Mimosoideae or Mimosaceae) is a high quality timber
   tree with an extensive natural distribution in Australia and a wide
   genetic and phenotypic diversity. Seeds from three widely differing
   provenances in Tasmania were tested to determine whether they had
   different responses to various dormancy-breaking treatments. All
   provenances had limited germination (< 11\%) if seeds were untreated and
   between 85\% and 91\% germination after 40 days if the seeds were
   nicked. For all provenances short (<= 60 s) exposure to boiling water
   gave high germination percentages. These values were generally lower,
   although usually not significantly so, than the germination percentages
   following nicking. Germination percentages decreased with increasing
   time of exposure to boiling water, although one provenance had a
   significantly greater tolerance to one of the longer (20 min)
   treatments. Nicked seeds germinated quickly and uniformly, whereas those
   subjected to the boiling-water treatments germinated after a longer
   period and more gradually. In untreated seeds, the lens was a low,
   elliptically shaped dome (similar to 110-135 mu m wide, 140-190 mu m
   long). In more than 99\% of the seeds examined, the structure of the
   lens was markedly altered after a 10-s exposure to boiling water. A wide
   diversity of altered lens structure was found, from a circular hole
   between the macrosclereids, to a short fissure where the macrosclereids
   did not separate to their bases. Nicked seeds had a 200-375 times
   greater area for water uptake than a fully disrupted lens and this was
   probably the principal reason why the nicked seeds germinated sooner and
   more rapidly.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {133-142},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Trees' resistance to fire-induced mortality increases with bark
   thickness, which varies widely among species and generally increases
   with stem diameter. Because dry forests are more fire-prone than wetter
   forests, bark may be thicker in these forests. However, where
   disturbances such as hurricanes suppress stem diameter, trees may not
   obtain fire-resistant bark thickness. In two hurricane-prone Caribbean
   dry-forest types in Puerto Rico-deciduous forest and scrub forest-we
   measured bark thickness on 472 stems of 25 species to test whether tree
   species obtain bark thicknesses that confer fire resistance, whether
   bark is thicker in the fire-prone scrub forest than in the deciduous
   forest, and how bark thickness in Caribbean dry forest compares with
   other tropical ecosystems. Only 5\% of stems within a deciduous-forest
   stand had bark thickness that would provide < 50\% probability of
   top-kill during low-intensity fire. In contrast, thicker-barked trees
   dominated the scrub forest, suggesting that fires influenced it.
   Compared with trees of similar diameter in other regions of the tropics,
   bark in Caribbean dry forest was thinner than in savanna, similar to
   other seasonally dry forests, and thicker than moist-to-wet forests.
   Dry-forest species appear to invest more in fire-resistance than species
   from wetter forests. However, Caribbean dry forests remain highly
   vulnerable to fire because the trees rarely reach large enough diameters
   to be fire resistant.},

Volume = {86},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-75},

Abstract = {Due to rapid loss of soil fertility in traditional cropping systems and
   subsequent yield decline, plantain fields in Southeastern Nigeria are
   usually reverted to fallow after three years. This study investigates
   the potential of mulch-based systems for long term plantain production:
   alley cropping with Dactyladenia barteri and natural bush, and a
   cut-and-carry technique with Pennisetum purpureum. Model results
   simulate yields decline observed under traditional cropping systems due
   to a decrease in soil fertility. The adoption of mulch-based
   technologies is conditioned by capital availability. However, when
   adequate capital is available, mulch-based systems are quite profitable.
   Under baseline conditions, the alley cropping system with natural bush
   outperforms the other two improved technologies with a 154\% and 72\%
   increase in net returns over continuous and shifting traditional
   systems, respectively. The traditional system had the worst performance
   without fertilizer use. A sensitivity analysis shows that the increase
   in net return due to fertilizer in the alley cropping and traditional
   systems is at least 25\%. This analysis indicates that credit programs
   that reach small farmers and land reform that gives them secure title
   are essential to widespread adoption of mulch-based plantain systems.

Abstract = {The responses of Acacia nilotica L. var. cupriciformis to phosphorus
   application and inoculation with the indigenous consortium of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi were evaluated in a nursery experiment using soil
   from a marginal wasteland. A positive growth response to mycorrhizal

   either inoculation or additional P at the highest soil P of 40 ppm.
   Colonization was negatively correlated to soil P but P content of both
   shoot and root were positively correlated. Inoculation with the
   indigenous AM consortium significantly increased the uptake of P at all
   levels of applied P. Acacia is moderately dependent upon the AM
   symbiosis and exhibited a maximal mycorrhizal dependence (MD) of 18.25\%
   at 20 ppm Olsen-P level under the conditions studied. A sharp and
   considerable reduction in MD and dry matter yield observed at 40 ppm P
   suggests that the external P requirement for maximal production of
   biomass was met at approximately 20 ppm Olsen-P.},

Abstract = {Exploiting genetic differences among trees to fix N2 can improve tree

   biological N2 fixation (BNF) and the mineral N use efficiency of 9
   provenances of uninoculated, inoculated and N-fertilized Gliricidia
   sepium were studied in a greenhouse experiment. Both the N-15 isotope
   dilution and A-value methods were used to estimate BNF. Soil in the
   uninoculated and inoculated treatments were labelled with either 20 mg N
   kg-1 soil of 10 atom \% N-15 excess KNO3 (designated unfertilized), or
   100 mg N kg-1 soil of 2 atom \% N-15 excess KNO3 (designated
   fertilized). Significant variation was found between provenances in
   shoot dry weight within uninoculated (up to 62\% differences) and
   inoculated (up to 35\% differences) treatments. There were no
   significant differences in atom \% N-15 excess between the N-fertilized
   G. sepium provenances. Atom N-15 excess of the uninoculated unfertilized
   plants varied significantly between 1.413 and 2.440, and nodules were
   observed on the roots. The method used to measure BNF influenced the
   values obtained; the isotope dilution method gave significantly lower
   values than the A value method. Lower values of the isotope dilution
   method were attributed to the nodulation which occurred when reference
   plants were grown at the lower, but not higher, N rate. The A value
   method was consequently judged to provide more reliable estimates of
   BNF. The percentage of N derived from atmospheric N2 varied among
   provenances and ranged from 56\% for provenance 24/86 to 74\% for
   provenances 14/84 and 15/84 all from Guatemala. Growth of provenances
   11/86 from Costa Rica and 41/85 from Mexico responded well to
   inoculation but not to fertilizer, although having similar total N with
   both treatments. Various provenances gave no response to inoculation or

Abstract = {Impact of prior chlorophyll removal (PCR) and drying methods (freeze-
   and oven-drying) on characteristics and antioxidant activities of the
   ethanolic extracts (EEs) from Cladophora (C.) glomerata, freshwater
   macroalgae, were investigated. The extraction yields were found in the
   range of 7.18\%-13.15\% with total phenolic (TPC) and total chlorophyll
   (TCC) contents of 19.40-25.69 mg GAE/g dry extract and 3.58-7.94 mg/g
   dry extract, respectively. Yield, TPC and TCC decreased when
   dechlorophyllization was implemented before extraction, regardless of
   drying method (p <= .05). Increase in L{*} value with coincidental
   decrease in Delta E{*} value was observed in the EE with PCR.
   Freeze-dried EE with PCR (FEE-PCR) showed greater antioxidant
   efficiencies (both in vitro and oxidation model systems) than that
   oven-dried EE with PCR (p <= .05). Liquid chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis indicated that quercetin-3-O-glucoside was
   the most abundant phenolic compounds identified in the FEE-PCR.
   Therefore, freeze drying in combination with PCR was effective
   preparation method to maximize antioxidant activity and improve color of
   EE.
   Practical applications Lipid oxidation is one of important reactions
   affected on the deterioration of food quality and safety. Many
   antioxidants have been widely used to retard lipid oxidation. Due to
   their health hazard of synthetic antioxidants, the search for safer
   ingredients with potent antioxidant activity resources is attracted
   interest. Phenolic compounds, the bioactive substances distributed in
   aquatic plants, have been known as antioxidant with health benefit.
   However, chlorophyll associated algal extract influenced on color and
   bioactivity of phenolic compound, which limits its utility. Moreover,
   drying technologies also have an impact on a stability of active
   components in algal sample. To maximize the utility of alga, the
   appropriate pretreatments by chlorophyll removal along with effective
   drying method could be a better choice for preservation of bioactive
   compounds. As a consequence, a wider application can be achieved. The
   corresponding extracts could therefore be used as an alternative natural
   antioxidant for food applications, instead of synthetics in a future.},

Abstract = {The feeding value of Ficus religiosa (FR) was investigated with West
   African dwarf (WAD) goats, by feeding FR with Panicum maximum grass (PM)
   at different ratios of 0: 100 (i.e. solely PM), 25:75, 50:50, 75:25
   (which were mixture of forages) and 100:0 (solely FR). The study lasted
   for 105 days, during which feed intake, weight gain, digestibility and
   nitrogen utilization were monitored in 20 goats using a completely
   randomized design. The DM, OM and NDF intakes (g/kg W-0.75/day) were
   similar among the diets of FR-PM mixtures (means equal to 58.08, 51.68
   and 39.27, respectively), but were significantly higher than those of
   the sole FR and PM forage diets, which were also similar (means equal to
   36.13, 31.97 and 24.33, respectively). Crude protein intake (g/kg
   W-0.75/day) was highest in the 75\% FR diet (6.16), but similar to those
   of other mixed forages and sole FR, and the significantly lowest value
   was in the sole PM diet (2.54). Live weight gain followed the trend of
   CP intake with the highest value in 75\% FR (34.3 g/day) and the least
   from sole PM (8.9 g/day). The digestibility of DM, OM, CP and NDF were
   generally high, but best in the 75\% FR diet. The N balance (g/kg
   W-0.75) and retention (\%) were also highest in 75\% FR (0.63 and 65.40)
   and lowest in the solely PM diets (0.14 and 37.11). Results indicate
   that feed intake, weight gain, digestibility and N utilization can be
   enhanced by feeding FR in mixture with PM, and it can be used in diet
   mixtures up to 75\% of DM fed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   The ingredients of diets were Alfalfa, wheat straw, corn silage, corn,
   barely, bran and mineral-vitamin supplement by a ratio of concentrate
   and forage at 50:50. Rumen fluid was taken from fistulated cow and
   dromedary camels and in vitro digestibility of experimental diets was
   determined. The obtained data were analyzed in a split plot design. The
   lowest digestibility of dry matter in dromedary camel (73.1\%) and
   cattle (71.9\%) was found in the treatment contain ing 100\% of Subabul
   (p<0.05). But digestibility of natural detergent fiber (NDF) and acid
   detergent fiber (ADF) of diets containing different levels of Subabul
   instead of Alfalfa were not different in cow and camel (p>0.05).
   Digestibility of NDF and ADF in the treatment containing 100\% Subabul
   in the cattle were 70.36 and 68.21\%, respectively, and in the dromedary
   camel were 71.19\% and 69.02\%, respectively (p<0.05). Treatments

   containing 50 and 100\% Subabul in compared with control treatment was
   72.4 and 67.6 vs 73.5 \%, respectively, and NDF digestibility was 72.45,
   69.65 and 75.33 \% in treatments containing 50 and 100\% Subabul and
   control, respectively (p<0.05). As per the result, the digestibility of
   DM, NDF and ADF of Subabul were not different between cow and dromedary
   camel (p>0.05).The result of these experiments showed that in vitro
   digestibility of 50 \% Subabul instead of Alfalfa in diet of cow and
   camel was better than other levels, therefore it can be used in cow and
   dromedary camel nutrition.},

Abstract = {The suitability of six hedgerow species for alley cropping was assessed
   on an acid infertile soil in the highlands of Burundi between 1988 and
   1993. The fastest growing species was Sesbania sesban, followed by
   Calliandra! calothyrsus and Leucaena diversifolia. The slowest growing

Abstract = {Phosphorus deficiency is widespread in the subhumid highlands of eastern
   Africa but there are few data on the effect of P deficiency on the
   growth of agroforestry tree species, We studied the effect of P
   application on growth, nutrient uptake and dry matter partitioning in
   young trees of Calliandra calothyrsus, Cedrela serrulata, Eucalyptus
   grandis, Grevillea robusta, Markhamia lutea, Senna spectabilis, and
   Sesbania sesban on a P-deficient soil (Kandiudalfic Eutrudox,
   bicarbonate-EDTA extractable P = 1 mg kg(-1)) in western Kenya. The
   trees were grown at two P levels (control and 500 kg added P ha(-1)) at
   1 m(2) spacing in a randomized complete block design with three
   replications. Leaf K concentrations were in the low range for all
   species (5-9 mg g(-1)) and K deficiency may have limited responses to P.
   Averaged over species, P addition increased aboveground shoot dry matter
   by a factor of 2.6 at 62 and 124 days, but the response decreased to 1.3
   at 325 days. The increases at 62 days were large in sesbania (5.4) and
   eucalyptus (3.2) but small in calliandra (1.4) and markhamia (1.1).
   Relative response to P was more strongly correlated with shoot growth
   rate per unit root length among species than with shoot growth rate
   alone. Calliandra, which had high early growth rate but low response to
   added P, had an exceptionally high root length (6.0 km m(-2)) compared
   with the other species (0.3-2.1 km m(-2). P addition increased N and P
   content but decreased final shoot K content in sesbania and calliandra,
   and had little effect on K content in the other species. The
   high-yielding species (eucalyptus, sesbania and calliandra) accumulated
   more than 30 g N and 2 g P m-2 in shoots in 325 days of growth. The
   proportion of total shoot N in wood (branch + stem) was in a higher
   range (67-75\%) in the shrubby species (sesbania, calliandra, senna)
   than in the upperstorey tree species (38-43\%). Slow early shoot growth
   relative to total root length, and high specific root length (root
   length per unit root mass) are proposed as criteria for the selection of
   species and provenances that are well adapted to P deficient soils. (C)

   cutting heights in two seasons. SixtyG. ulmifoliatrees were selected and
   distributed in two heights (25 and 50 cm) and three regrowth ages (30,

   nutritional content increased (P < 0.05) with increasing regrowth age,
   except for crude protein (CP), which was decreased in the dry season (P
   < 0.05) at a cutting height of 25 cm. In the rainy season, the
   parameters, dry matter and CP were higher at a cutting height of 25 cm
   and at 60 and 90 days after regrowth (P < 0.05), while NDF, ADF and

   digestibility was higher in the rainy period (P < 0.05), although in the
   dry season, digestibility at a cutting height of 25 cm was greater. In
   the rainy period, forage should be collected at a height of 25 cm and

Abstract = {Intercropping Ginkgo and crop species in southern China is receiving
   increasing attention because it offers potential advantages for resource
   utilization, higher economic income to farmers and increased
   sustainability in crop production, We carried out a 2-year field
   intercropping system composed of Ginkgo with wheat, broad bean, and
   rapeseed, respectively, to determine the competitive interactions
   between the different species, and productivity and the economic yield
   of each intercropping system. The density of Ginkgo and crop species was
   varied systematically in a two-way density matrix composed of three
   monoculture densities and nine intercropping of all possible pairwise
   combinations of monoculture densities. Intercropping systems were
   assessed on the basis of several intercropping indices such as land
   equivalent ratio, relative crowding coefficient, relative competition
   intensity and vector competition analysis. The results showed that the
   combined biomass production of the component crop species was
   significantly greater in the Ginkgo/crop mixtures than in monocultures
   crops (Ginkgo, broad bean, wheat, and rapeseed). Ginkgo: rapeseed ratio
   24:12, Ginkgo: bread bean ratio 24:5, and Ginkgo: wheat ratio 24:200 had
   the best total biomass production. Ginkgo: rapeseed (and broad bean)
   ratio 24:5 and Ginkgo: wheat ratio 24:200 in respective Ginkgo/crop
   mixtures had the maximum economic yield. Vector competition analysis
   showed that Ginkgo/rapeseed mixture exhibited an antagonistic
   interaction type and therefore is not suitable for intercropping.
   Ginkgo/broad bean mixture demonstrated the most beneficial effects among
   the three intercropping systems.},

Abstract = {The area of sown pastures in northern Australia should expand to 7.5 Mha
   by 2010, supporting about 4 M beef cattle (30-35\% of the northern
   herd). The main constraints to the future use of sown tropical pasture
   plants are perceived to be: declining research funds; the high costs of
   establishing and maintaining improved pastures; uncertain commodity
   prices; an unreliable climate; the limited availability of well-adapted
   legumes in some areas; instability of legume based pastures,
   particularly in relation to weed invasion; diseases and pests of
   legumes; and concerns about the environmental impact of introduced
   plants. Several of these constraints are amenable to research.
   Incremental gains in reliability or reductions in costs of establishment
   are predicted. Well-planned collection, introduction and evaluation of
   exotic plants will continue to provide a steady flow of new pasture
   cultivars, but it will be necessary to address concerns about the
   environmental impact of introduced plants. There will be restrictions in
   future on the release of new cultivars that could become environmental
   weeds. Stable control of anthracnose disease of style is achievable
   within a 10-year timeframe, using modern plant-breeding techniques.
   Several possible approaches to reducing the maintenance fertiliser
   requirements of sown pastures are discussed. In order to achieve
   satisfactory progress in the face of these constraints, it will be
   necessary to maintain an adequate level of research funding and a
   balanced research portfolio that addresses a range of industry
   priorities.},

Abstract = {A study to compare the effects of supplementing Delonix elata, Grewia
   similis, Tamarindus indica and sunflower seed cake on intake and growth
   rate of dual-purpose goats fed low quality Buffel grass (Cenchrus
   ciliaris) hay was carried out. Twenty-eight male goats aged five to
   seven months (mean weight 12.93 +/- 3.94 kg) were randomly allocated to
   four dietary groups in a completely randomised design. The diets were
   hay plus Grewia similis, hay plus Delonix elata, hay plus Tamarindus
   indica and hay plus sunflower seed cake. All diets were supplemented
   with maize bran. The experimental period was 90 days. Voluntary dry
   matter intake of the supplements was higher for Tamarindus indica (275.5
   g/day) and Grewia sitnilis (201.8 g/day) and lowest for sunflower seed
   cake (81 g/day). Goats supplemented with Grewia similis had the highest
   hay intake (183.8 g/day) while those supplemented with sunflower seed
   cake had the lowest hay intake (98.9 g/day). Animals fed browse
   supplements gained significantly more weight (p < 0.001) than those with
   sunflower seed cake. There were no significant differences in live
   weight change between goats fed the different browses. However, those
   fed Tamarindus indica gained an average of 20.79 g/d which was slightly
   higher than the gains for those on Grewia similis and Delonix elata
   while those fed sunflower seed cake lost weight. Correspondingly, goats
   supplemented with browse leaf meals had higher feed conversion ratios
   than those supplemented with sunflower seed cake and required 23.91 to
   35.06 g DM of feed to produce one g of weight gain per day In a separate
   study, the DM disappearance pattern indicated that Grewia similis and
   Delonix elata were highly degradable compared to Tamarindus indica. At
   24 h of incubation, DM degradability was 627, 588 and 345 g/kg DM for
   Grewia similis, Delonix elata and Tamarindus indica, respectively. In
   another study in vivo DM digestibility ranged from 46.1\% (for hay
   alone) to 56.2\% (for hay plus Grewia similis). It was concluded that
   the addition of Tamarindus indica, Grewia similis and Delonix elata leaf
   meals to Cenchrus ciliaris hay resulted in increased total DM intake, in
   vivo digestibility and growth rate. Therefore, leaf meals of indigenous
   browses particularly Tamarindus indica and Grewia similis could be used
   as supplementary feeds for small ruminants grazing on poor quality
   roughages during the dry season rather than use of expensive, less
   effective and intermittently available sunflower seed cake.},

Title = {Optimization of furfural production by acid hydrolysis of
   Eucalyptus globulus in two stages},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to optimize the production of furfural by
   hydrolysis with dilute acid of Eucalyptus globulus wood in two stages,
   using a factorial experimental design and multiple regression models to
   maximize furfural yields. The two-stage process could provide a solid
   phase with less degraded cellulose and older applications that the solid
   phase of a conventional acid hydrolysis. The selectivity for furfural of
   the process was increased by effect of the glucan and lignin fractions
   being efficiently removed after the first acid hydrolysis stage.
   The operational ranges are especially suitable for the extraction of
   xylose, which was virtually quantitative at 170 C and virtually
   independent of the operation time. It is therefore advisable to use
   non-isothermal conditions or short times. This is quite important if one
   considers the low acid concentration used. The liquid phase obtained
   after autohydrolysis of the raw material under the optimum conditions
   contained 2.3\% glucose, 9.8\% xylose, 2.5\% xylo-oligomers, 0.6\%
   arabinose, 1.1\% furfural and 0.1\% 5-OH methyl furfural.
   After the residual solid from the first hydrolysis stage is removed, the
   acid concentration is the most influential variable on the conversion of
   xylo-oligomers or xylose into furfural. Conversions to furfural were
   quite substantial (greater than 10 g/L). Hemicelluloses in the raw
   material were extracted by 32-57.7\% and xylan by 40.5-84\%. The highest
   conversions to furfural were obtained by using a medium operation time
   (15 min) and low temperature (170 degrees C) and pH = 2.
   The process additionally provides hemicellulose derivatives that are
   scarcely contaminated with cellulose derivatives. The concentrations of
   gluco-oligomers were very low and those of glucose in the region of 3\%
   of the raw material. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted to assess the effects of polyethylene glycol
   (PEG-6000) and urea on dry and organic matter digestibility (IVDMD and
   IVOMD, respectively) and gas production in vitro. Raisin stalk contained
   8.6\% crude protein, 85\% dry matter, 7\% ash, 13.95\% total extractable
   phenol (TEPH) and 2.13\% total extractable tannin (TET). The
   experimental treatments were: raisin with no supplementation as control
   (C); supplemented with 3\% urea (U 3\%), 5\% urea (U 5\%) or 3\% urea
   plus 5\% PEG (U-PEG) per DM. The rumen liquor fluid was obtained from
   two ruminal-cannulated fat-tailed sheep. TEPH and TET were determined
   and in vitro incubation was also conducted. The results indicated that
   the PEG increased IVOMD and IVDMD. The gas produced from time 0 to 3 and
   3 to 6 h of incubation were significantly higher in PEG treatment than
   that of other groups (P < 0.05). The U-PEG treatment increased the total
   gas production in 96 h, but it was not statistically significant (P =
   0.06). Gas production in 96 h incubation using 300 mg fresh sample was
   significantly higher than 200 mg sample (P < 0.05). It is concluded that
   the negative effect of tannin on DM and OM digestibility and also gas
   production of raisin stalk in vitro could be alleviated by PEG
   treatment.},

Title = {Effect of dietary utilization of a mixture of tropical tree foliage

Abstract = {The global goat population continues to grow, and simultaneously, fodder
   demand is increasing, despite the fact that feed resources are limited,
   and thus, new unconventional feed resources should be explored. The
   present study focuses on the nutrient utilization of ten top feeds viz.
   Acacia nilotica, Celtis australis, Ficus palmata, Ficus religiosa,
   Grewia optiva, Melia azadarach, Morus alba, Quercus incana, Salix alba
   and Zizyphus jujuba. Twelve adult, non-descript local male goats (27.02
   +/- 2.93 kg, 14 +/- 2 months old) were randomly assigned to two equal
   groups. The control group was fed a conventional concentrate mixture
   (CON), while the treatment group received a leaf meal-based concentrate
   mixture (LMM). Both groups were provided ad libitum access to wheat
   straw as forage. The outcome of body weight changes revealed
   non-significant (P > 0.05) variations between groups. The dry matter
   intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI), and balance of nutrients
   (viz. calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen) showed non-significant
   differences (P > 0.05) between groups. The digestibility of all the
   nutrients were similar between groups. All the blood biochemicals were
   within normal physiological range without any significant difference (P
   > 0.05) between dietary treatments. The animals provided with LMM based
   rations showed better humoral immune response, however, cell-mediated
   immune (CMI) response was similar (P > 0.05) among both groups. So, it
   can be concluded that leaf meal mixture can be incorporated up to 15\%
   level in the concentrate mixture of adult goats without affecting their
   nutrient intake, nutrient digestibility, blood-biochemical profile, and
   cell-mediated immune response, with better humoral immune response.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritive value of
   selected fruits (pods and seeds) and leaves of acacia tree species
   namely; Acacia nubica (nubica), Acacia tortilis (tortilis) and Acacia
   brevispica (brevispica), Acacia reficiens (reficiens) and Acacia senegal
   (senegal). A wide variability in chemical composition, polyphenolics and
   gas production was recorded. The crude protein (CP) ranged from 131 to
   238 g/kg DM. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (BDF)
   and lignin (ADL) were higher in senegal and significantly different
   (p<0.05) from other species. The nitrogen bound to fiber tended to be
   higher in leaves than the fruits, ranging from 2.6 to 11.3 g/kg NDF and
   1.6 to 3.2 g/kg ADF. The leaves of reficiens and senegal had higher
   concentrations of total extractable phenolics (TEPH), total extractable
   tannins (TET) and total condensed tannins (TCT), but lower in NDF, ADF
   and ADL than the fruits of nubica, tortilis and brevispica. Mineral
   concentrations varied among species; all were relatively poor in
   phosphorus, moderate in calcium and magnesium, and rich in
   microelements. A significant (p<0.05) variation in gas production after
   12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h was recorded between species. Nubica had the
   highest (p<0.05) rate of gas production (0.0925) while the highest
   potential gas production was recorded in tortilis. A strong negative
   correlation between TEPH and TET with gas production after 24, 48, 72
   and 96 was established (r=-0.72 to -0.82). Crude protein and TCT
   correlated negatively but also weakly with gas production
   characteristics. Organic matter digestibility calculated from gas
   production after 48 h (OMD48) ranged between 465 g/kg DM in reficiens
   and 611 g/kg DM in tortilis. The results of this study indicate that
   acacia species have the potential to be used as feed supplements.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to assess the suitability of two fallow species
   that are indigenous to West Africa, M. thonningii (Schum and Thonn) and
   P. santalinoides (L'Her), for alley cropping with maize and their effect
   on soil chemical properties. It was carried out during the rain-fed
   cropping season at Ibadan, Nigeria and Mbalmayo, Cameroon in 1993 and
   1994. Total dry matter of P. santalinoides prunings was higher at the
   two sites than that of M. thonningii by about 35\% to 37\%. Maize,grain
   yield in plots supplied with prunings was significantly higher (P <
   0.05) than in control (no prunings or fertilizer application) at Ibadan.
   Grain yield in plots supplied with prunings plus 40 kg ha(-1) urea
   fertilizer gave significantly higher yields than plots supplied with 80
   kg N ha(-1) urea fertilizer only. At Mbalmayo, there was no significant
   difference between grain yield in plots supplied with 80 kg N ha(-1) and
   plots supplied with prunings plus 40 kg N ha(-1) urea fertilizer though
   the latter had higher yields. Grain yield was also higher in the middle
   rows than in rows adjacent to the hedgerows and these were not
   significantly different. Weed dry matter was reduced by 27\% to 43\%
   when Pterocarpus prunings were applied and 13\% to 31\% with application
   of Millettia prunings. Weed flora in both locations changed from grasses
   to broad leaved. Soil chemical changes at soil depth 0 to 10 cm showed
   significant increases (pH, C, N, P and Ca) after two cropping seasons in
   plots supplied with prunings or prunings plus fertilizer than the
   initial values. At Mbalmayo, K was lower after cropping in treatments
   than the initial values while at Ibadan, K and Mg were lower except in
   plots supplied with Pterocarpus prunings only. P. santalinoides and M.
   thonningii have significant potential for agroforestry in this

Journal = {BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {81},

Abstract = {The sickle bush (Dichrostachys cinerea (L.) Wight \& Arm) comprises a
   woody legume shrub which is widely distributed throughout of the
   tropical areas of Africa, Asia and Oceania, being found as well in Cuba
   where it represents a difficult to control invasive plant. It holds
   great silvopasture and energy crop potentials. In southwestern Spain a
   two year field trial was conducted contemplating also another six
   hardwood taxa commonly used as energy crops. The sickle bush above
   ground dry biomass fraction was 60.4\%; sickle bush displayed a high
   transpiration rate during hot days (3.02 kg m(-2) d(-1) to 6.82 kg m(-2)
   d(-1)); cold winter temperatures (<-2 degrees C) together with hot and
   dry summer air (<20\% relative humidity) committed survival and growth.
   The physical-chemical wood properties and the pellets thereof derived
   were analyzed and compared to those of the other energy crop taxa. The
   within other woody species normal chemical composition range coupled to
   a high wood density and energetic use properties (19.2 MJ kg(-1) higher
   heating value, 29 g kg(-1) ash content) all allow for an industrial use.
   Pellets evidenced also good physical and mechanical properties (690 kg
   m(-3) bulk density, 42 g kg(-1) moisture content). However, the
   mechanical durability (93.9\%) was slightly less than that required by
   the non-industrial use standards, therefore further improvements should
   be studied. All of the above could encourage scrubland cuts in Cuba as a
   mechanical control method, in addition to the expansion of plantations
   within of their tropical climate based natural habitats. (C) 2015

Abstract = {A study was conducted to investigate the effect of feeding napier grass
   (Pennisetum purpureum) with or without legume supplementation on
   nutrient intake and live-weight gains (LWG) in dairy heifers.
   Thirty-two, 1-year-old Friesian and Sahiwal heifers were used. Eight
   heifers, four from each breed, were randomly allocated to the following
   four diets: napier grass alone (D1, control), napier/desmodium (D2,
   inter-cropped in the field), napier grass supplemented with lucerne hay
   (D3) and napier grass supplemented with desmodium hay (D4). Feed intake
   was recorded daily while LWG was measured fortnightly over the 120-day
   feeding period. In a separate experiment, two fistulated steers were
   used to estimate the rumen DM degradation of the diets. Heifers on diets
   D2, D3 and D4 showed significantly higher nutrient intake and LWG (P <
   0.05) than those on D1. Heifers on D1 gained 0.41 kg day(-1), while
   those on D2, D3 and D4 gained 0.45, 0.52 and 0.42 kg day(-1),
   respectively. Diet D3 showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) solubility,
   degradation rate, potential and effective degradation compared to the
   other diets. Diet costs computed from forage production data, showed
   that D2 was the cheapest diet. Results from the study indicated that
   legume supplements enhanced animal performance and that the cost of
   live-weight gain is lower when the legume is grown as an inter-crop with
   napier grass. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The non-proteinogen aminoacid mimosine interfered seriously with
   cultured carp hepatocytes when added to the culture medium for 6 h in a
   concentration of 0.1 M. Cell transformation started with condensation of
   the chromatin into an unusual network of fibrils and segregation of the
   reticulate nucleolus into its fibrillar and granular components. Then
   chromatin condensation spread homogeneously across the entire nucleus.
   At the end of the condensation period the nuclear envelope extended
   towards the cytoplasm and the nuclear interior resulting in a very
   confusing nuclear boundary. Later, the nucleus expanded and the
   chromatin was gradually decondensed but the segregated nucleolus
   persisted until nuclear lysis. The DNA staining pattern did not change
   throughout the condensation period. DNA was even present in most
   decondensing nuclei. The cytoplasmic organelles were only slightly
   affected during chromatin condensation but significantly altered
   thereafter. The observed course of mimosine-induced cell transformation
   is very unusual. The first period covering chromatin condensation with
   structural intactness of the cell organelles resembles in some aspects
   apoptosis but additionally includes some special signs. The following
   phase of cellular disintegration, however, is similar to necrosis. Due
   to this unique course of cell death, mimosine should be further tested
   for its potential suitability in experimental cell research and cancer
   chemotherapy.},

Abstract = {Provenance evaluation of Calliandra calothyrsus was conducted at
   Minkoameyos in Yaounde and Nkoemvone, in Ebolowa, southern Cameroon. The
   aim was to assess early growth performance in provenances of the species
   in acid soils of the region. The soils of Minkoameyos are regarded as
   moderately acid (pH 1:1 soil:water 5 to 6 and Al saturation < 20\%)
   while that of Nkoemvone is referred to as very acid (pH 1:1 soil:water <
   5 and Al saturation > 40\%). Germination potential of the seeds was
   assessed at two weeks after planting. The growth per performance was
   evaluated at three, six, nine and twelve months for height, diameter,
   biomass, number of stems and phenological developments. In terms of all
   the parameters measured, significant (P < 0.05) difference was detected
   between provenances. Effect of site or the interaction of site by
   provenance was significant for only some parameters at certain periods.
   Variation in the over all growth performance between provenance was high
   and differences between sites was minimal. This indicates that C.
   calothyrsus grow well both on very acid and moderately acid soils of
   southern Cameroon. The large genetic variation in growth and biomass
   production suggest that further screening to isolate desirable traits
   for genetic improvement effort is essential. In short-term, the current
   result will allow for immediate selection of superior provenances with
   desirable traits for use in appropriate agroforestry systems in southern

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal variation of pre-dispersal seed predation was
   investigated in a population of Mimosa bimucronata trees located in the
   south-east region of Brazil. Three main hypotheses were addressed: (1)
   that the life stages of the seed predator Acanthoscelides schrankiae are
   synchronised with the reproductive stages of its host plant; (2) that
   seed predation levels vary spatially as a result of differences in
   fruiting phenology synchrony and fruit production among trees; and (3)
   that predation levels should be affected by the proximity of trees,
   showing a spatial structure. Also investigated was the oviposition
   pattern of A. schrankiae among seeds and fruits. Twenty spatially
   referenced trees were monitored throughout a year to examine tree
   phenology and egg laying and adult emergence. The bruchine's life stages
   were synchronised with the reproductive stages of M. bimucronata trees.
   Egg distribution among seeds and fruits was aggregated. Infestation
   rates of adult bruchines were not spatially related to fruiting
   phenology and there is evidence that seed predation is a spatially
   density-independent process, because the relationship between
   infestation rates and fruit production was not significant. Finally, it
   was observed that the distribution of adult bruchines was spatially
   structured, because similar levels of infestation were found among
   nearby trees.},

   from five different trees per species at the University of the North
   (now University of Limpopo) in April 2003, in a completely randomized
   design. Packed volume ranged from 1.50 mL/g for A. karroo to 3.00 mL/g
   for A. hebeclada whilst water retention ranged from 3.71 g/g for A.
   galpinii to 4.98 g/g for A. sieberiana. These results suggest that all
   the tree leaves have a high intake potential. All the Acacia species had
   crude protein levels above 100 g/kg dry matter (DM), ranging from 103
   g/kg DM for A. rhemniana to 183 g/kg DM for A. sieberiana. Crude protein
   levels of this magnitude in a diet are adequate to support the
   maintenance requirements of cattle, sheep and goats at low to medium
   production levels. The Acacias contained medium to high levels of
   neutral and acid detergent fibres with ranges of 489 to 622 and 415 to
   545 g/kg DM, respectively. In vitro DM and organic matter
   degradabilities varied from 345 to 534 and 254 to 474 g/kg DM,
   respectively. Acacia hebeclada, A. sieberiana and A. galpinii contained
   traces of total phenolics whilst A. tortilis contained approximately 90
   g/kg DM of total phenolics and A. karroo, A. nilotica and A. rhemniana
   contained intermediate concentrations. Extract condensed tannin (CT)
   content ranged from 1.1 g/kg in A. hebeclada to 80.7 g/kg in A. karroo.
   At level above 50 g/kg, CT tends to negatively affect intake and
   digestibility in ruminants. Consequently, reduced intakes of A.
   galpinii, A. karroo and A. tortilis could be expected because they
   contained CT values above 50 g/kg. Only A. nilotica showed a sharp curve
   in the potassium iodate test, reflecting its considerable content of
   hydrolysable tannins (HT). All the other species had flat curves
   reflecting low levels of HT in them. The results showed that all the
   species except for A. galpinii, A. karroo and A. tortilis are of good
   nutritive value and have a potential for integration into livestock
   feeding systems in the Limpopo Province.},

Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Polyethylene glycol (PEG 4000), Browse Plus (TM) (BP), wood ash (WA) and
   boiling water were evaluated as tannin deactivation methods on tannins
   in Acacia nilotica fruits. Twenty four Matebele goats of mean body mass,
   38.7 +/- 3.12 kg, were used in a digestibility and nitrogen balance
   trial. A completely randomized design was used, and the initial weight
   was used as a covariate in data analysis. The goats were randomly
   allocated to the treatments and were fed for 28 days on a basal diet of
   hay and A. nilotica fruits treated with PEG (MW 4000), BP, WA or boiling
   water. Acacia nilotica fruits had 4.39\% catechin equivalents of
   condensed tannins, thus the amount of PEG, BP and WA used to treat the
   fruits was 1.5 parts per part of condensed tannin in the fruits. It was
   hypothesized that treating the fruits would deactivate the tannins in
   them and increase intake, digestibility and nitrogen retention. Treating
   the fruits for condensed tannins had no effect on hay and fruit intake.
   None of the treatments had an effect on the apparent digestibility of
   dry matter, organic matter, neutral and acid detergent fibre and
   nitrogen retention in the goats. The goats that were fed on the boiled
   fruits had a negative N retention of -1.03 g/day. It was concluded that
   none of the detannification methods improved feed intake, apparent
   nutrient digestibility and nitrogen retention. It is recommended that
   each detannification method should be tested on different types of
   tannins and at different concentrations before totally dismissing the
   treatments as not useful.},

Abstract = {Expansion of the nature conservation estate in northeastern New South
   Wales, Australia, has captured weed-infested timber plantations amid a
   mosaic of high conservation value lands. We adopted a
   state-and-transition approach to test the hypothesis that restoration
   barriers restrict the natural regeneration of native species in
   Eucalyptus grandis plantations infested by Lantana camara in Bongil
   Bongil National Park, New South Wales. Plantation tree thinning and weed
   control were applied in factorial combination at three sites (totaling
   to 4.5 ha). Topsoil chemistry responses to these interventions were
   attributable to the ``ash bed{''} effect, with temporary increases in
   topsoil pH(W) and nitrate, particularly where canopy reduction was
   greatest. Other soil changes were minor, indicating that thinning and
   burning did not risk soil degradation. Plant species richness and
   functional group representation in the regenerating understorey were
   improved by the interventions. Regeneration of native potential canopy
   trees, understorey trees, shrubs and woody climbers, and perennial forbs
   all increased with canopy retention. Grass cover dominated the
   regeneration where canopy cover was less than 50\%. In the absence of
   weed control, the cover of introduced shrubs increased with reduction in
   canopy cover, as did the rate of understorey regeneration generally.
   These responses indicate that thinning and weed control can reinstate
   succession, leading to structurally and compositionally diverse forest.
   Given the abundance of native woody regeneration under retained canopy,
   the lantana understorey was more important in inhibiting native
   regeneration. The experimental approach will promote efficient use of
   resources across the remaining 200 ha of low conservation value
   plantations in this national park.},

Abstract = {Sinorhizobium meliloti is a well-known symbiont that fixes nitrogen with
   plants of three genera of the family Leguminosae, Tribe Trifolieae:
   Medicago, Melilotus, and Trigonella. We have found that S. meliloti
   strain RCR2011 forms ineffective nodules on a distantly related legume
   species. Sesbania macrocarpa. Nodules are indeterminate and lack
   leghemoglobin. Although S. meliloti deformed root-hairs of S.
   marcocarpa, infection threads were not detected in these cells. Instead,
   cells of S. meliloti were found in infection Dockets between cortical
   cells and within infection threads that had penetrated into these cells.
   Bacteria eventually were released and gave rise to symbiosomes, which
   contained large quantities of an amorphous matrix with parallel arrays
   of electron-dense striations. Mutants of strain RCR2011 lacking nodA or
   nodH failed to nodulate S. macrocarpa, inactivation of nodG or nodE
   resulted in smaller nodules, while inactivation of region IIa, which
   contains nodIJ, had no apparent effect on nodulation. (C) 1998

Abstract = {A field study was conducted at Hetian, southern Xinjiang, northwest
   China, to investigate root morphology as affected by interspecific
   interactions between jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) and wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L.). The treatments comprised (1) sole wheat, (2) 3-, 5- and
   7-year-old sole jujube trees, and (3) intercropping of wheat/3-, 5- and
   7-year-old jujube trees. Roots were sampled by auger in each plot down
   to 100 cm depth at 20 cm intervals in the soil profile and horizontally
   up to 150 cm away from the base of the trees at 30 cm intervals. All
   jujube/wheat intercropping systems had advantages of intercropping with
   a land equivalent ratio (LER) > 1. There were significant differences in
   the contours of both root length density (RLD) and root diameter (RD) in
   intercropped wheat and jujube in the vertical and horizontal direction
   at corresponding soil depths but the RLD and RD of the 7-year-old
   jujube/wheat intercropping system were less influenced by intercropping
   in this respect than 3- and 5-year-old jujube intercropped with wheat.
   The roots of both intercropped wheat and jujube had smaller RLD, RD and
   larger specific root lengths (SRLs) at corresponding soil depths than
   did sole wheat and jujube. The older the jujube the larger were the SRL
   values of intercropped wheat and the smaller the RLD and RD of
   intercropped wheat. The greater the distance from the jujube the less
   influence there was on the RLD, SRL and RD of intercropped wheat and
   jujube and the greater the distance from the jujube the smaller was the
   SRL of intercropped wheat and the greater the RLD and RD of intercropped
   wheat (but still less than the monoculture wheat). The older the jujube
   the more developed were the jujube roots so that the smaller the SRL of
   jujube the bigger the RLD and RD of jujube. Jujube tree roots showed a
   mainly downward trend and extended laterally 150 cm from the trees
   resulting in the roots of the jujube trees and the wheat having niche
   overlap at a soil depth of 20-40 cm. The mechanisms underlying the
   thinner roots of wheat and jujube require further investigation.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing is the only technology that can systematically monitor
   physical properties of the biosphere over a vast region. However, it is
   still a challenge to make these measures meaningful for assessing the
   impacts of environmental perturbation. Here, we integrate an optical
   remote sensing system termed EcoiRS (Ecosystem observation by an
   integrated Remote Sensing system) specifically for this purpose. EcoiRS
   consists of three subsystems: an off-the-shelf atmospheric correction
   model (ACORN), a cloud/shadow removal model, and an advanced spectral
   mixture analysis model (AutoMCU). The core of ACORN is a set of
   radiative transfer codes that can be used to remove the effects of
   molecular/aerosol scatterings and water vapor absorption from remotely
   sensed data, and to convert these digital signals to surface
   reflectance. Shadow and cloud cover that would obscure the reflective
   properties of land surfaces in an image can be minimized by referring to
   their optical and thermal spectral profiles. AutoMCU executes iterative
   unmixing for each pixel using selected spectral end-members based upon
   the rule of Monte Carlo simulation. The main outcomes of EcoiRS include
   cover fractions of green vegetation, non-photosynthetically active
   vegetation and bare soils, along with uncertainty measures for each
   pixel. The dynamics of these derived products are significant indicators
   for monitoring the change of states of terrestrial environments, and
   they can be used for investigating different environmental
   perturbations. Here, we demonstrate studies of implementing EcoiRS to
   map three major but relatively less studied cases in a western Pacific
   island (Taiwan): typhoons, tree diseases and alien plant invasion.},

Abstract = {In balance experiments with rats either 25 or 50\% of the casein protein
   in the control diet was replaced with one of the following eight
   sun-dried tropical biomass products: water spinach plants (WS) (Ipomoea

   included 102 rats with six individuals per treatment group. In three of
   the 16 biomass treatment groups. feed intake and weight gain of the rats
   were unacceptably low, and therefore they were excluded from the
   statistical evaluation. The crude protein (CP) content of the biomass
   products varied between 20.9\% (Tric) and 33.2\% (DW). whereas the
   content of NDF varied between 18.5\% (Ind) and 32.2\% (DW) of dry matter
   (DM). The total content of essential amino acids (g/16 g N) was
   comparable with that of alfalfa meal. except for GF and Tric, which were
   inferior. Between plant species, differences in dietary digestibility of
   organic matter (dOM) and CF (dCP) were observed (p <0.001). Also, the
   replacement level negatively influenced dOM and dCP (p <0.001). The
   lowest values for dOM (p <0.001) were observed for diets including
   biomass products with the highest content of NDF (GF, Tric. Mb. LL).
   Digestibility of CP was negatively affected by level of protein
   replacement. Significant (p<0.001) differences were found in N-retention
   and biological value among diets with different biomass products. The
   most favourable overall results were obtained for DW, WS and CL. The
   main factors affecting the nutritive value of the diets tested were
   their NDF content, dCP and AA profile of the biomass. Also
   antinutritive: component(s) may have influenced the process of digestion
   and metabolism of some of the biomass products.},

Abstract = {The current research was undertaken to scrutinize the effect of leaf
   meal mixture as concentrate mixture in the ration of goats. Leaf meal
   mixture (LMM) was prepared using equal quantities of ten top-foliages
   namely Acacia nilotica, Celtis australis, Ficus palmata, Ficus
   religiosa, Grewia optiva, Melia azadarach, Morus alba, Quercus incana,
   Salix alba and Zizyphus jujube obtained from district Poonch of Jammu
   region in western Himalayas. The LMM prepared was substituted for 15\%
   in the concentrate mixture being fed to the goats. The study constituted
   of two trials. Concentrate mixture offered to the animals was in mash
   and multi-nutrient block in first and second trial respectively. A total
   of twelve non-descript, adult male goats were selected for each trial.
   Goats of 0-14 months age (27.71 +/- 2.96 kg live body weight) of for
   first trial while goats of 12-16 months age (27.02 +/- 2.93 kg live
   weight) for second trial were divided into control and treatment groups
   as per randomized block design and fed ad-lib wheat straw and
   concentrate mixture @ (20 g/kgW(0.75)). No significant variation was
   observed (p > 0.05) in body weight, feed and DM intake among all groups
   in both trials. Comparable intake as well as digestibility of various
   nutrients like DM, OM, CP, EE, CF, NFE, NDF, ADF and TDN were found
   between the two groups during individual trials. There was a positive
   nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balance among all experimental animals

   parameters like total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin: globulin and
   blood urea nitrogen (BUN) showed no significant differences during both
   trials in all groups, being within normal physiological levels. However,
   haemoglobin concentration was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in
   treatment group with respect to the control group in first trial. On the
   basis of current results, it can be established that leaf meal mixture
   can successfully be used to replace concentrate mixture up to 15\% in
   the ration of goats without expecting any adverse impacts on their
   growth and overall health.},

Abstract = {The coordination of iron(III) ion to hyaluronic acid (Hyal) in aqueous
   solutions and solid state was accomplished by potentiometric titrations
   and infrared spectroscopy. The potentiometric titration studies provided
   the binding constants for the complexes found in the systems and the
   speciation of these species according to the variation of pH values. The
   complexes found presented a complexing ability through both the
   chelating moieties of Hyal (via the N-glucosamine and D-glucoronic
   acid), showing no special preference for either one while in solid
   state, but when in aqueous solution the complexation via the
   N-glucosamine moiety was the preferred, forming two complexed species,
   ML and ML2 (log K-ML = 8.2 and log K-ML2=7.9). The presence of a mu-oxo
   complex via the D-glucoronic acid was also detected in both aqueous (log
   K=6.7) and solid states via the N-glucosamine and D-glucoronic acid
   simultaneously linked to two Hyal chains. A structure for this latter
   complex was suggested. The results indicated that these complexes could
   be used in eliminating the excess iron(III) in living organisms. (C)

Abstract = {Planted fallows are a potential means for regenerating soil fertility in
   the humid tropics. N-fixing leguminous trees are often recommended for
   this purpose, but precise criteria for efficient fallow trees do not
   exist. A combined field and laboratory study was undertaken, including 9
   tree species of five years age, of which 6 were N-fixing, and a
   spontaneous fallow dominated by Chromolaena odorata on a Ferralic
   Cambisol in the Central Gate d'Ivoire. Although the trees differed
   widely in growth, litterfall and root mass, differences in total soil C
   and N were small. Soil respiration and N-mineralization were measured by
   incubating topsoil in the laboratory. The initial CO2-flush after
   rewetting differed significantly between species, but non-significant
   differences afterwards indicated comparable stability and size of the
   labile C pools of the soils. Total N-mineralization differed
   significantly between species, with highest values for the control.
   There was no relationship between the ability of the plants to fix N and
   N-mineralization or total N-accumulation in the soils. To test the
   effect of the trees on a subsequent crop, rice was grown in pots filled
   with topsoil from all plots. Total above-ground dry matter of the rice
   differed significantly between species and was significantly correlated
   with N-mineralization in the soil. and N-concentration in the rice
   leaves. N-mineralization was closely related to the amount of litterfall
   for 7 of the 9 tree species, and to root-mass for the 6 N-fixing tree
   species. Litterfall and root mass are identified as potential criteria
   for fallow tree efficiency, but the long-term effect of high
   N-mineralization rates on available soil-N pools needs further
   investigation. The importance of soil biological measurements in
   comparison to chemical soil tests for the assessment of fallow effects
   is stressed.},

Abstract = {The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of
   leguminous fodder silage on rumen fermentation, nutrient digestibility,
   and utilization in beef cattle crossbreds. Four cattle, with an average
   live weight of 280 +/- 10 kg, were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design
   with supplementation of various levels of sunnhemp silage (SHS).
   Sunnhemp silage was fed to cattle at 0, 1, 1.5, and 2 kg DM
   SHS/head/day. The DM, OM, and CP digestibilities were increased (P <
   0.05), and the highest value was found by feeding 2 kg DM SHS/head/day.
   Total volatile fatty acids and individual volatile fatty acid (VFA)
   especially C-3 were increased (P < 0.01), while C-2 and C-2:C-3 ratios
   were decreased (P < 0.01) when SHS was supplemented. Nitrogen
   utilization efficiency and urinary purine derivatives were increased (P
   < 0.01) by the SHS supplementation. In conclusion, these data suggest
   that feeding SHS at 1.5 to 2 kg DM/ head/day can significantly increase
   rumen fermentation end-products, nitrogen utilization efficiency, and
   microbial protein synthesis. Sunnhemp silage can be practically
   processed and provided as a good roughage source for ruminants.
   Therefore, sunnhemp silage is recommended as a feeding intervention in
   the sub-tropical and tropical regions to support the sustainable
   livestock production.},

Abstract = {The effect on milk yield, milk composition and ration digestibility of

   Elephant grass diet and a concentrate containing 20\% soybean meal was
   compared with a concentrate where the soybean meal was replaced with the
   same amount of Moringa leaf meal. In the third diet commercially
   available components were used to compose an ``Iso{''} concentrate with
   the same energy and protein content as the concentrate containing
   Moringa leaf meal. The intake of dry matter, organic matter, neutral
   detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre did not differ significantly
   between treatments and averaged 15.4, 13.9, 7.2 and 5.9 kg day(-1),
   respectively, while crude protein (CP) intake was higher (P<0.001) for
   the soybean meal treatment compared to the other treatments, 1.7 and 1.2
   kg CP day(-1), respectively. The treatments did not differ with regard
   to digestibility with the exception of CP digestibility, which was
   significantly higher in the soybean meal treatment compared with the Iso
   concentrate, 0.70 and 0.62. respectively. Mean daily milk yield was
   significantly higher (P<0.05) when cows were given soybean meal compared
   with both Moringa leaf meal and the optimized concentrate, 13.2, 12.3
   and 12.1 kg day(-1), respectively. There was no significant difference
   between treatments in either the milk composition, or the organoleptic

Title = {Extraction of metals from mildly acidic tropical soils: Interactions
   between chelating ligand, pH and soil type},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {248},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Naturally occurring and synthetic chelating ligands can act as
   suppressants for fungal pathogens, nematodes and weeds, based on their
   ability to alter micronutrient bioavailability in soil, particularly
   iron. Chelators are also used as detergents, for remediation of heavy
   metal contamination and for supplying metals as fertiliser. The aim of
   this work was to test the ability of chelators to solubilise metals, in
   particular iron, in tropical soils over an environmentally relevant pH
   range. Six topsoils from farms in North Queensland, Australia were
   adjusted to pH 5, 6 and 7 and then extracted with CaCl2, EDTA, DTPA,
   EDDHA and mimosine. The extracts were analysed for concentrations of
   aluminium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, strontium and
   zinc. EDDHA solubilised iron effectively under all of the conditions
   tested, indicating its likely suitability for pest suppression. The
   concentration of aluminium in EDDHA extracts was positively correlated
   with pH, and at pH 7 the concentration of aluminium was far greater than
   that of iron. An increase in the mobility of aluminium from EDDHA
   application to soil may lead to aluminium toxicity in plants, which
   should be considered further in any practical application of EDDHA.
   Mimosine, which is also a strong chelator, was a poor extractor of all
   metals, possibly due to adsorption to the soil. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {An in vitro regeneration system was developed using organogenic callus
   derived from in vitro grown cotyledonary explants of Gleditsia caspica
   Desf., an important leguminous tree. Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal
   medium augmented with 0.2 g L-1 myo-inositol and various concentrations

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate with the N-15 natural
   abundance method if inoculation with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (VAM) fungi affects the N-2 fixation of legume trees grown under
   Ethiopian nursery conditions. A further aim was to test if VAM fungi
   influence the delta(15)N values of non-fixing plants.
   Five different VAM inocula and/or phosphorus fertilizer were applied to
   the standard, non-sterile nursery soil in which seedlings of four
   different Acacia species and Eucalyptus globulus were grown. After 3-5
   months the acacia shoot dry weights and the fraction of the fine roots
   which were colonized VAM fungi was increased by four of the VAM inocula.
   However, inoculation did not influence the delta(15)N values of
   non-nodulated A nilotica or E. globulus; i.e., roots with low and high
   VAM colonization did not differ in discrimination against N-15. With E
   globulus used as a reference species grown under the same conditions and
   in the same time period as A. abyssinica, the N, fixation of A.
   abyssinica accounted for 5.1 to 46.7\% of the seedling N content,
   dependent on the soil treatment. Deep shade reduced the N-2 fixation of
   A. abyssinica from 36.2 to 5.1\%.
   The lower delta(15)N values of most VAM inoculated, nodulated acacias
   indicate that N, fixation was increased by those VAM fungi which also
   promoted shoot dry weight. However, VAM inoculation generally did not
   affect shoot N concentrations or nodule dry weights, and the delta(15)N
   values were not correlated with shoot N concentrations. N, fixation may
   not be important for the N nutrition and growth of seedlings in
   nutrient-rich nursery soils, but it is an important seedling property
   after outplanting in N deficient field soils.},

Abstract = {To ascertain the potential of various leguminous biomass such as L.
   leucocephala, C. proliferus, P. alba and S. sesban, both energetic and a

   at different heating rates by using the analytical method of

   Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), determination of some thermodynamic
   parameters and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (Py-GC/MS). It was concluded that biomass such as L. leucocephala or C.
   proliferus are more suitable for pyrolysis since less energy is required
   to degrade them, more evident in the final stages of degradation in
   which P. alba and S. sesban present very high activation energies
   calculated by KAS. All leguminous biomass produced volatile compounds
   with high phenol content at the peak of maximum degradation of
   hemicellulose, most of the heavy derivates are derived from lignin, such
   as ferulaldehyde or methoxyeugenol, because sufficient energy has not
   yet been provided to break down the structure. At this peak it can see
   some furans and saccharides in the case of C. proliferus since it has a
   higher C5 content in its composition. A wide range of compounds were
   detected at the peak of maximum degradation of cellulose, L.
   leucocephala and C. proliferus produce more short-chain compounds that
   give rise to bio-oils whereas, S. sesban and especially P. alba, in
   addition, produce a quantity of high added value of saccharides such as

Abstract = {High soil mineral N and broadcast sowing four perennial pasture legumes
   inoculated with a mixture of three strains of Bradyrhizobium led to the
   failure of the inoculant to establish in host plant rhizospheres. This
   contrasted with much better survival of the same three strains within
   the rhizospheres of four annual and two perennial legumes when sown in
   drill rows into an adjacent area of the same soil that had low nitrate
   concentrations. Use of adhesive with the inoculum enhanced its
   establishment within the rhizosphere and increased the nodule
   representation for most legume-strain combinations compared to
   inoculation without adhesive.
   When adhesive was used and when seed was drill-sown into the soil low in
   nitrate, changes in rhizosphere populations of inoculum strains
   generally exhibited three distinct phases. The first phase occurred
   between sowing and seedling emergence, and typically involved a decline
   in the size of the inoculum population from that on the seed to that in
   rhizosphere at emergence. This was followed by a period of rapid
   colonization of the rhizosphere to a common population density. Finally,
   the third phase was usually, but not always, characterized by a further
   increase in numbers with the onset of nodule decay. For these freely
   nodulating pasture legumes, neither the seed inoculum level nor
   establishment within the rhizosphere was reflected in competitive
   ability for nodule formation, and saprophytic competence was not a
   function of nodule representation. Strain CB756str generally performed
   poorly compared to two other strains. Counts of inoculum strains in the
   rhizosphere of freely nodulating legumes had no predictive capacity for
   the nodulation success of a strain.},

Abstract = {Six spontaneous antibiotic (streptomycin + rifampicin) resistant strains
   of Bradyrhizobium were tested for rhizosphere and nodulating
   competitiveness on Desmodium intortum.
   The resistant strains were obtained from parental strains that were
   selected from indigenous soil populations nodulating D. intortum in
   south east Queensland. The parental strains represented five dominant
   groups of isolates obtained using intrinsic antibiotic resistance and
   serological typing techniques. The sixth parental strain CB627 was that
   recommended for D. intortum. Test strains were reintroduced into their
   soil of origin and into two other soils in numbers approximately equal
   to the populations in the original soils. The number of each test strain
   in the soil and rhizosphere and the proportion of nodules formed by
   these strains were assessed for two sowing occasions.
   All strains colonized the soil and rhizosphere. There was an overriding
   effect of soil type on numbers of bradyrhizobia in the soil and the
   rhizosphere and only a small interaction effect between soil and strain.
   There were markedly different responses in the proportion of nodules
   formed by the test strains. A strain from Beerwah soil (CB3098) failed
   to form nodules in Tumbulgum soil in the first sowing, but all strains
   formed nodules in Beerwah and Samford soils. Strain CB3097, from
   Tumbulgum soil, was the most competitive of all strains throughout the

Abstract = {This review analyzes and discusses alternatives or options related to
   agricultural systems in which tropical legumes (trees and creeping) are
   essential part of them and matters related to agronomy and milk and beef
   production. This review compiles data of the tropical area and that
   obtained in Cuba. Forms of decreasing the negative effects in the
   establishment of these species are indicated. Also, an important group
   of data is analyzed noting the real possibilities for the feeding of
   heifers, milk and beef production in these systems, as well as the
   possibility of substituting concentrates and fertilizers. The need for
   the special management of creeping legumes is noted to attain an
   adequate balance between them and the grass. The data provide sufficient
   scientific and technical elements that widen the existing concepts to
   achieve an adequate establishment and rangelands, stable and productive
   in a sustainable form. The studies should be continued for the
   obtainment of new integral technologies for the efficient exploitation
   of other tropical legumes.},

Abstract = {Ample evidence has indicated that mixed tree plantations are the most
   appropriate option for providing a broad range of goods and
   environmental services, but still debate continues about whether mixed
   plantations can achieve greater productivity than can monocultures. In
   this study, a meta-analysis of published studies was performed to
   synthesize results of growth in mixed plantations and monocultures
   across differing regions and species. A total of 14 studies representing
   46 tree species from tropical and temperate ecosystems were included to
   test three hypotheses: stand composition affects tree height growth
   rate; stand composition affects tree diameter growth rate; and presence
   of nitrogen-fixing tree species in mixed tree plantations affects the
   diameter growth rate of non-fixing species. It was found that mixed
   plantations did not have larger height growth rates, but that the
   diameter growth rate was higher in mixed plantations, with a moderate
   but statistically significant effect size. Nitrogen-fixing tree species
   had a positive effect on the diameter growth rate of non-fixing species,
   with a large and statistically significant effect size. This study
   suggests that mixing tree species generally increases plantation growth
   rate. Furthermore, mixed tree plantations can play an important role in
   satisfying economic needs by shortening rotations yet adding other
   ecological benefits. Silviculturalists should adopt mixed plantations
   more widely across degraded landscapes, as well as nitrogen-fixing tree
   species to maximize positive interactions in mixed plantations. (C) 2007

Abstract = {Fish meal is the major protein source in shrimp and fish diets but its
   continuous use would make it scarce and expensive. There are, however,
   potential substitutes like soybean or leaf meals. Papaya or camote leaf
   meals have not been tested as partial replacement for fish meal in diets
   for tiger shrimp. Thus, two feeding trials were made to test diets with
   leaf meals against a control shrimp diet. Both experiments used 50 mg
   shrimp stocked at 10 per 40 liters of sea water following standard water
   management. Trial 1 had diets containing either 17\% soaked or unsoaked
   camote leaf meal or 16\% papaya leaf meal. Results indicated that weight
   gain, specific growth rate ard feed conversion ratio of the unsoaked
   papaya group were similar to the control, higher than the unsoaked
   camote, but not significantly different (alpha = 0.05) from the soaked
   camote and papaya groups. Survival was not significantly different among
   treatments. Trial 2 used the best diet from Trial 1 - unsoaked papaya
   leaf meal - at 16\%, 19\% or 22\% of the diet. The weight gain (1846\%)
   of the Shrimp fed 16\% papaya leaf meal was not significantly different
   (alpha = 0.05) from the control 2034\% but higher than the 22\% group
   (1535\%). Therefore, papaya leaf meal can partially replace (10\%)
   animal protein in shrimp diets and serve as a source of exogenous
   proteolytic enzyme. However, its efficacy in culturing shrimp in ponds
   must be tested.},

Abstract = {The effects of supplementing Gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus) with
   varying levels of hay from cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) and dried
   cassava root chip on growth and diet digestibility were studied using
   local male goats with an average initial body weight of 14.0 kg.
   Thirty-two animals were allocated to a completely randomized 2x2
   factorial design with eight animals per treatment. The factors were two
   levels of cassava hay (25\% and 35\% of an expected dry matter (DM)
   intake of 3\% of body weight) and cassava root chips (0 or 1\% of body
   weight) on an individual basis with grass offered ad libitum. Another
   four animals were assigned to a 4x4 Latin square design to study
   digestibility, and were given the same four diets as in the growth
   experiment. Total DM intake was significantly higher in the group fed
   diets with cassava hay and root while the DM intake of Gamba grass was
   not significantly different between treatments. The supplementation with
   cassava hay and root increased the apparent digestibility of DM, organic
   matter and N and resulted in a higher N-retention. The apparent
   digestibility of neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fiber was
   not affected significantly. The average daily gain of animals fed diets
   supplemented with both cassava hay and root was significantly higher
   than for the animals supplemented with cassava hay alone. The highest
   daily gain recorded was 70 g/day. In conclusion, supplementing a basal
   diet of Gamba grass with cassava hay and root chips improved DM intake,
   digestibility, N-retention and weight gain. In order to minimize the
   waste of cassava hay, the inclusion level of cassava hay can be
   recommended to be 25\% of expected DM intake, which would give
   acceptable intake and growth performance when cassava root is included
   in the diet.},

Abstract = {Digestion, growth and laboratory studies evaluated the replacement value
   of the tropical tree legume Gliricidia sepium for a concentrate feed in
   kinggrass (Pennisetum purpureum) based diets for growing goats. In the
   growth trial, 24 intact male goats (10-18 kg) were allotted to three
   treatments in a randomized design. Nine additional goats used to study
   digestibility and N balance of the diets were allotted to the treatments
   in a randomized complete block design with two periods giving six
   observations per treatment. The (positive) control diet contained 40\%
   concentrate, and gliricidia replaced 0, 50 or 100\% of the concentrate,
   yielding diets containing 0\% (GO), 20\% (G20) and 40\% (G40)
   gliricidia. Gliricidia was greater in total N concentration than
   kinggrass, and a greater percentage of the N in gliricidia was
   potentially ruminally degradable than that in kinggrass. The ruminally
   degradable N fraction in gliricidia was degraded in situ at a faster
   rate than that in kinggrass, resulting in a greater estimated pool of N
   available for rumen function. In the digestion trial, apparent dietary
   organic matter (OM) and fiber digestibilities, dietary N retained and
   absorbed, and N utilization efficiency declined in a linear (P<0.05)
   manner with increasing gliricidia level in the diet. In the growth
   trial, OM intake was similar (P=0.64) among treatments. Differences in
   daily gain and pin/feed ratio were greater (P<0.06) between the GO (110
   g, 0.19) and G20 (75 g, 0.13) diets than between the G20 and G40 (75 g,
   0.13) diets. Lower animal performance on gliricidia-supplemented diets
   was likely due to lower available dietary energy resulting in lower N
   digestion and assimilation. All goats on gliricidia-supplemented diets
   gained weight and maintained a positive N balance, suggesting that
   gliricidia may replace some of the concentrate used in kinggrass-based
   diets for growing goats. High costs of grain imports may economically
   favor lower rates of gain in tropical areas of the world.},

Abstract = {There is substantial evidence that fertilizer tree systems are capable
   of maintaining increased and sustainable crop production on low
   fertility soils in southern Africa, thus reducing the required amount of
   chemical fertilizer. However, crop yield increase in soils amended by
   fertilizer tree systems can only be optimized if nutrient release by the
   organic materials and nutrient demand by the crop are in synchrony. The
   decomposition and N release patterns of high quality tree prunings
   (gliricidia and sesbania) and crop residues (pigeon pea leaves and
   roots, and maize stover) were studied to understand the N use efficiency
   of fertilizer tree systems. The treatment were (1) quality pruning
   residues from gliricidia (Gs) and sesbania (Ss), (2) three medium
   quality residue levels including pigeon pea leaves (Pea-L), pigeon pea
   leaves + roots (Pea-LR) and pigeon pea roots (Pea-R), and (3) two rates
   of maize stover (Stover-1 and Stover-2) as low quality residues, and
   control (no crop residues, no tree prunings). The treatment combinations
   were laid out as a randomized complete blocks design. Mixtures of tree
   prunings with 2.5 t ha-1 maize stover increased maize N uptake and grain
   yield whereas 5 t ha-1 maize stover reduced maize N uptake and grain
   yield during the wetter season. Mixtures of Pea-R, Stover-1 or Stover-2
   with tree prunings depressed yields during the drier season. Stover-2
   had the highest N fraction immobilized N, respectively 15 and 35\% N
   during the wetter and drier conditions. We conclude that (1) mixing of
   high quality tree prunings with crop residues may enhance the
   decomposition of low quality crop residues but there is no special
   interaction, and (2) remineralization of N immobilized early in the
   season by the low quality organic materials is stimulated by well
   distributed rainfall.},

Abstract = {Forage grass nutritional quality directly affects animal feed intake,
   productivity, and enteric methane (CH4) emissions. This study evaluated
   the nutritional quality, in vitro enteric CH4 emission potential, and
   optimization of diets based on two widely grown tropical forage grasses
   either alone or mixed with legumes. The grasses Urochloa hybrid cv.
   Cayman (UHC) and U. brizantha cv. Toledo (UBT), which typically have low
   concentrations of crude protein (CP), were incubated in vitro either
   alone or mixed with the legumes Canavalia brasiliensis (CB) and Leucaena
   diversifolia (LD), which have higher CP concentrations. Substitution of
   30\% of the grass dry matter (DM) with CB or LD did not affect gas
   production or DM degradability. After 96 h of incubation, accumulated
   CH4 was 87.3 mg CH4 g(-1) DM and 107.7 mg CH4 g(-1) DM for the grasses
   alone (UHC and UBT, respectively), and 100.7 mg CH4 g(-1) DM and 113.2
   mg CH4 g(-1) DM for combined diets (70\% grass, 15\% CB, and 15\% LD).
   Diets that combined legumes (CB or LC) and grass (UHC or UBT) had higher
   CP contents, gross, and metabolizable energy (GE, ME, respectively)
   densities, as well as lower concentrations of neutral detergent fiber
   (NDF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL). The ME and nutritional variables
   such as NFD, tannins (T), and CP showed a positive correlation with in
   vitro net gas production, while ruminal digestibility was affected by
   CP, ADL, T, and GE. Optimal ratios of components for ruminant diets to
   reduce rumen net gas production and increase protein content were found
   with mixtures consisting of 60\% grass (either UHC or UBT), 30\% CB, and
   10\% LD. However, this ratio did not result in a decrease in CH4

Abstract = {The utilization of N-2-fixing trees (NFTs) in agroforestry, in semiarid

   to evaluate the N-2-fixing capacity of trees growing under natural
   conditions for 10 years with neither chemical fertilizer nor inoculum
   application. For this purpose, natural isotopic N-15 abundance
   (delta(15)N) of leaves harvested from NFTs and reference plants (ren
   growing in three agroecological zones of Senegal were analyzed. Ar each
   sire (one site per zone), average ref was calculated N contents and
   delta(15)N values increased from the north in the Sudano-Sahelian zone
   (Bambey and Nioro) to the south in the sub-Guinean zone (Djibelor). The
   percentage of fixed N-2 (\%Ndfa) was low at both Bambey (Ndfa less than
   or equal to 22\%) and Nioro (Ndfa less than or equal to 39\%) and very
   high at Djibelor (76\% less than or equal to Ndfa less than or equal to
   95\%). To explain the law levels of Ndfa observed at Bambey and Nioro,
   the hypothesis of lack of Bradyrhizobium strains in these soils was
   made. This hypothesis was confirmed by results obtained from a trial
   conducted under controlled conditions, which showed absence of
   nodulation on Gliricidia sepium growing under optimal conditions of
   water and nutrient supply. Improvement of N-2 fixation of NFTs in the
   semiarid zone is a prerequisite for implementation of sustainable

Title = {Influence of Salix babylonica extract in combination or not with
   increasing levels of minerals mixture on in vitro rumen gas
   production kinetics of a total mixed ration},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effects of increasing levels
   of two feed additives composed of Salix babylonica (SB) extract and
   minerals mixture (MM) or their combination on in vitro gas production
   (GP) and dry matter (DM) degradability of total mixed ration (TMR; 50
   concentrate: 50 corn silage, on DM basis). Combinations of four levels
   of SB extract (0, 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mL/g DM) with four levels of MM (0,
   0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 g/100 g DM) were evaluated in a completely random
   design. Samples of TMR (1 g) were weighed in 120 mL serum bottles with
   addition of SB extract and/or MM. Then, 10 mL of particle free ruminal
   fluid were added followed by 40 mL of the buffer solution. The GP was
   recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation. Addition
   of SB extract, without MM, increased (P<0.05) asymptotic GP (mL/g DM),
   the rate of GP (/h), GP and DM degradability (DMD). Addition of MM,
   without SB, increased (P<0.05) b and decreased c and ruminal pH.
   Increasing the levels of SB increased (P<0.05) b, c, L, and GP in
   addition to linearly increase (P<0.001) DMD. Increasing levels of MM
   increased (P<0.05) b and c while decreased pH. An interaction occurred
   between different SB extract and MM levels: the most effective levels of
   SB extract and MM on ruminal fermentation and kinetics were 1.8 mL SB
   extract/g DM and 2.5 g MM/100 g DM.},

Title = {Energy requirements for maintenance and growth of entire male Bali
   cattle in East Timor},
Journal = {ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {54},
Number = {7},
Pages = {908-914},
Abstract = {The metabolisable energy (ME) requirements for maintenance and growth of
   entire male Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) were determined by regressing
   liveweight change on ME intake. Cattle were fed either a diet(DM basis)
   of 52.5\% urea-treated rice straw plus 47.5\% fresh leucaena forage
   (Expt 1), or fresh leucaena forage alone (Expt 2). In each experiment,
   liveweight change and feed intake were measured over 4 weeks, after a
   1-week introductory period, and feed constituent digestibilities were
   measured during the final week. In Expt 1, 10 bulls between 1.5 and 3
   years of age and weighing 123.7 +/- 11.79 kg (mean +/- s.d.) were
   allocated to DM intakes estimated to provide 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75,
   or 2.0 times the estimated ME requirement for maintenance (based on
   calculations made from published CSIRO equations for tropical cattle
   species other than B. javanicus), with either one or two bulls per
   treatment. In Expt 2, the bulls were given treatments estimated to
   provide 0.85, 1.0, 1.4, 1.8, or 2.2 times the ME requirement for
   maintenance, with two bulls allocated to each treatment. The measured ME
   requirements for maintenance were 0.42 +/- 0.369 and 0.40 +/- 0.153
   MJ/kg LW0.75. day (coefficient +/- standard error, Expts 1 and 2,
   respectively). The ME requirement for `production' (i.e. positive
   liveweight change of male Bali cattle under the specific conditions of
   the experiment) was calculated to be 39.2 MJ/kg liveweight gain in Expt
   2. The calculated efficiency of use of dietary ME for production in Expt
   2, was 0.34},

Title = {Effect of dietary inclusions of different types of Acacia
   mearnsii on milk performance and nutrient intake of dairy cows},
Journal = {VETERINARY AND ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of including different types of
   Acacia mearnsii (tannin extract and forage) on nutrient intake and milk
   performance in dairy cattle. Holstein-Friesian x Jersey dairy cows (n
   per Experiment = 24) that had 200 days in milk were selected for this
   study in a completely randomized study design. This study was conducted
   under on-farm conditions at Springfontein dairy farm, a farm that lacked
   a functional bodyweight scale to measure the cow bodyweight and a
   computer system to register cow parity. Cows were assigned Acacia
   mearnsii tannin extract (ATE) pellets which were added with 0 (0ATE),
   0.75 (0.75ATE), 1.5 (1.5ATE) or 3 (3ATE) \% ATE in pellets while 0ATE
   was a commercial protein concentrate (Experiment 1). Cows were assigned
   Acacia mearnsii forage (AMF) at a rate of 0 (0AMF), 5 (5AMF), 15 (15AMF)
   or 25 (25AMF) \% AMF inclusion in corn silage-based diet (Experiment 2).
   For both Experiments, treatments had six cows each, in which they were
   adapted (14 d) to diets before data collection (21 d). All AMF
   inclusions decreased (P<0.0001) dry matter intake (DMI), crude protein
   intake (CPI), neutral detergent fibre intake (NDFI), acid detergent
   fibre intake (ADFI) and organic matter intake (OMI) at 25AMF. Linear
   (P<0.0001) and quadratic (P<0.001) effects were observed on DMI, CPI,
   NDFI, ADFI and OMI. Inclusions of AMF in corn silage diets affected milk
   yield, protein yield, lactose yield and milk protein percentage
   (P<0.001). Linear effect was present in milk yield per DMI (P<0.0001).
   In conclusion, the dairy cow diet supplemented with ATE pellets did not
   have a beneficial effect on the nutrient intakes and milk yield.
   However, the AMF supplemented in corn silage of the dairy cow diet,
   increased milk production due to positive effects on nutrient intake,
   which was favourably influenced from a nutritional point of view.},

Abstract = {The fruits of leguminous trees are part of the natural diet of goats;
   however, they should be evaluated to quantify its food and nutritional
   values. Chemical composition, in vitro gas production (with and without
   polyethyleneglycol (PEG-4000 MW)), in vitro digestibility of dry matter
   (IVDMD) and organic matter (IVOMD) of fruits from Pithecellobium dulce
   and Acacia cochliacantha were determined. The content of acid detergent
   fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), total phenols (TP) and
   condensed tannins (CT) was correlated (r) with the in vitro gas
   production (IVGP), IVDMD, IVOMD and metabolizable energy (ME) of the
   fruits. In Exp. 1 the preference test was developed during 10 days of
   adaptation, plus five days of evaluation in 10 six months-old female
   Creole goats, with 14 + 2.0 kg body weight (BW) that were allocated in a
   completely randomized design to simultaneously receive P. dulce and A.
   cochliacantha fruits in individual feeders to determine goats preference
   to any of the two fruits, and the chemical compound of fruits with dry
   matter intake (DMI) of goats was correlated, too. In Exp. 2 the
   productive performance was assessed of 25 six months-old male Creole
   kids (14 + 3.0 kg BW) that were allocated in a completely randomized
   design to feed ad libitum with fruits added to experimental diets with
   30\% and 15\% of each fruit; P. duke (T1 and T2), A. cochliacantha (T3
   and T4), and T5=control diet without fruit. The chemical composition,
   IVDMD, IVGP and IVOMD were different (P < 0.001) among fruits; the r was
   negative (-0.83 to -0.99, P <0.01) among the contents of ADF, NDF, TP
   and CT with IVGP, IVDMD, IVOMD and ME. Goats preferred the fruit of A.
   cochliacantha: DMI (11.7 g/kg W-0.75, P <0.001), selectivity (11.5
   frequency of intake, P < 0.01) and preference coefficient (1.3, P <
   0.001). DMI was positive r with the CP content (r=0.90, P< 0.001), NDF
   (r=0.91, P< 0.001), ADF (r=0.91, P <0.001) and ash (r=0.75, P <0.05) of
   the fruits. The productive performance was higher (P <0.01) in fed kids'
   diets T3 and T4 with DMI 108.3 and 101.3 g/kg W.75, there was a higher
   daily weight gain of 92.4 and 137.3 g, and feed conversions 8.1 and 6.0
   g, respectively. In conclusion the fruit of A. cochliacantha has higher
   nutritional value in goats that stimulated the dry matter intake; it
   increases the weight gain and feed conversion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Sixteen Alpine wethers (average BW 35 +/- 2 kg) were used to evaluate
   the effect of continuous 48-h intravenous infusions of saline (CON),
   mimosine (MIM; 200 mg.kg(.75).d(-1)), 2-hydroxy-3(1H)-pyridine (2,3-DHP;
   200 mg.kg(.75).d(-1)), or MIM+2,3-DHP (100 mg of MIM plus 100 mg of
   2,3-DHP.kg(.75).d(-1)) on hepatic function and selected blood metabolite
   and circulating hormone concentrations. Neither MIM nor 2,3-DHP affected
   plasma ammonia N, glucose, cortisol; or insulin concentrations over time
   (P > .10). Jugular plasma total protein concentration was greater in the
   MIM group (P < .07). Plasma triiodothyronine (P < .01) and thyroxine (P
   < .08) concentrations were higher in the goats receiving the MIM,
   2,3-DHP, and MIM+2,3-DHP infusions than in the goats receiving the CON
   infusion. Plasma urea N concentration was decreased by MIM (P < .10) and
   MIM+B,S-DHP (P < .03) compared with the CON infusion. A Propionate Load
   Test was conducted at 24 to 28 h into the infusion to assess the toxins'
   effects on the liver's ability to increase circulating glucose
   concentrations in the presence of elevated propionate levels. The
   results indicated that neither 2,3-DHP nor MIM reduced the liver's
   ability to respond to a bolus dose of propionate (P > .10). Following a
   Urea Load Test, circulating ammonia N and glucose concentrations in the
   MIM, 2,3-DHP, and MIM+2,3-DHP treatments had lower peak values than that
   in the,CON treatment (P < .01). It is concluded that continuous
   short-term infusion of MIM and 2,3-DHP increased circulating thyroid
   hormone concentrations in goats and improved the goats' ability to
   detoxify a bolus dose of urea N without affecting its glucogenic
   capacity in response to elevated propionate levels.},

Abstract = {Our objective was to investigate the effect of the replacement of aruana
   grass by gliricidia on the fermentative losses, chemical composition,
   and aerobic stability of silages. For ensiling, whole-crop aruana grass
   (75 d of growth) was chopped (275 g kg(-1) dry matter - DM) and ensiled
   alone or associated with gliricidia (270 g kg(-1) DM; 150 d of growth).
   For gliricidia, we used only the leaves and stalks to ensile. The
   evaluated treatments were different ratios of aruana grass to gliricidia
   (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100), with four replicates
   (mini-silos). The silage composed only of gliricidia exhibited a lower
   pH than the other silages. Dry matter recovery was not affected by the
   treatments, although effluent losses were affected. The replacement of
   aruana grass by gliricidia 50\% at ensiling resulted in a higher lactic
   acid bacteria count. The aruana grass silages displayed lower protein
   contents and a higher neutral detergent fiber content than the
   gliricidia silages after 40 d of fermentation. Consequently, the silage
   consisting of 100\% gliricidia showed higher in vitro DM digestibility,
   presenting an increase of 8.13\% after 40 d of fermentation compared
   with 100\% of aruana grass silage. After silo opening, the gliricidia
   silage was very stable (>72 h). The low quality of aruana grass silage
   is improved by replacing this grass with significant amounts of
   gliricidia (approximately 75\%).},

   SOC stock (-15 mg/ha) as compared with sown and natural pastures. Labile
   carbon (LC -185 mg/kg) and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC -378 mu

Abstract = {Maerua angolensis and graded levels of maize germ meal were offered to
   Small East African goats to assess the effects on voluntary feed intake,
   diet digestion, nitrogen balance and growth. The M. angolensis was
   offered at a rate of 20 g kg(-1) W(0.75) to all animals and maize germ
   meal treatment diets was given at five graded levels (0, 15, 20, 25, and
   30 gDM kg(-1) W(0.75)) designated as MGO, MG15, MG20, MG25 and MG30, in
   a completely randomized block design with 4 animals per treatment with
   the basal diet of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay fed ad libitum. The
   CP levels were 320, 200 and 61.4 g kg(-1) DM for M. angolensis, maize
   germ and C. gayana hay, and NDF contents were 449, 393 and 528 g kg(-1)
   DM, respectively. The DMI was 461-599 g DM d(-1) which increased with
   energy supplementation (P<0.05) although the supplemented groups did not
   differ and the goats consumed the feed at 3.72-4.53\% of their live
   weight. The ADG was 4.92, 23.7, 26.4, 34.4 and 35.7 g d(-1),
   respectively, with MG25 and MG30 being similar (P>0.05). The rumen
   NH(3)-N was in the normal range of 1.85-2.63 mg 100 ml(-1) while the

   rhizobium strain ISRA 604 induced nodulation more than ISRA 605 in G.
   sepium with an increase of 38.28\% for nodules number. Frequency (\% F)
   and intensity (\% M) of mycorrhization were highest at 0, 20 and 40 mg P
   kg(-1) soil applied however rhizobial inoculation has influenced
   frequency of mycorrhization. In the rhizobium-AM fungus interaction,
   plant shoot total N content increased when trees were inoculated with G.
   aggregatum whatever the rhizobial strain inoculated. Roots N fixed
   (Ndfa) increased when plant was inoculated with ISRA 604 and amended

Abstract = {Human population growth in Central America during the last thirty years
   has lead to encroachment of forests for food production and resulted in
   the replacement of forests with pastureland. Deforestation and
   degradation of productive soils have prompted researchers to investigate
   agroforestry as an alternative approach to land management.
   Silvopastoral systems in particular have been studied and their capacity
   to augment nutrient cycling, enhance soil processes, supply forage for
   livestock, and provide habitat for flora and fauna have been documented.
   Despite conclusive research findings, Central American producers are
   reluctant to integrate well-researched silvopastoral systems into their
   farming systems. Thus, it is imperative that researchers investigate the
   reasons for scant adoption, and that adoption is given precedence. We
   suggest that adoption research be made a priority on local, national,
   and regional silvopastoral research agendas. To explore incidence of low
   adoption, research should identify specific barriers, assess the
   technology generation process, examine the risks that silvopastoral
   adoption presents, and evaluate the potential for the integration of
   silvopastoral technologies on-farm. In addition, we recommend that the
   future Central American silvopastoral research agenda include the
   development of a clear understanding of the process of adoption specific
   to potential silvopastoral adopters in the region.},

Title = {PCR detection of the pyridinediol-degrading ruminal bacterium,
   Synergistes jonesii, in the rumen fluid of cattle},
Journal = {SYMBIOSIS},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-38},
Abstract = {Synergistes jonesii, a Gram-negative rumen bacterium, can catabolize a
   toxic pyridinediol, 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone, which is produced from
   mimosine present in Leucaena fodder in the rumen. Thus, it protects
   ruminants from the harmful effects of this toxin. A PCR-based method was
   developed to detect the presence of this pyridinediol-degrading
   bacterium in the rumen fluid of cattle. A unique 0.9-kb DNA sequence was
   identified by sequencing several fragments from a genomic library of S,
   jonesii strain 78-1 and four pairs of primers were designed and used for
   PCR amplification of specific fragments. The PCR conditions were
   optimized with one pair of primers that amplified a 349-bp fragment from
   S. jonesii DNA but not from any other bacterial DNA tested. This method
   could detect the presence of 1 to 10 bacteria in a sample. The method
   was tried on rumen fluid samples added with a known number of the
   bacterium With a simple pretreatment of the mixed sample, the PCR method
   reached a sensitivity only 100 fold lower than with pure-culture
   samples. Application of this method detected the presence of S. jonesii
   in some of the rumen fluid samples from cattle in Hawaii. This method
   will be a valuable tool to determine the effects of inoculation of
   cattle with S, jonesii and to monitor the population dynamics of this
   pyridinediol-degrading bacterium in cattle fed with different amounts of
   Leucaena.},

Abstract = {The production of beef and milk has a significant impact on climate
   change, as these activities are responsible for a large proportion of
   the greenhouse gases emitted in agriculture. We used the static closed
   chamber technique to measure the rate of CH4-C, N2O-N and CO2-C
   emissions from pastures (102days) and bovine excretions (27days) in an
   intensive pasture monoculture (PM) and an intensive silvopastoral system
   (ISS) in the Cauca Valley of Colombia. Mean soil CO2-C (mgm(2)h(-1)),
   CH4-C and N2O-N emissions (gm(-2)h(-1)) were 236.7 versus 113.4; 46.7
   versus 1.01 and 344.7 versus 40.1 for the PM and ISS, respectively. The
   accumulated flows for PM and ISS during the evaluation period were 751.6
   and 424.3; 4.39 and -0.41; and 12.75 and 1.55 (kgha(-1)) for CO2-C,
   CH4-C and N2O-N, respectively. Regarding manure, the PM had lower CO2-C
   and CH4-C emissions (498.6 vs. 981.2mgm(-2)h(-1), and 1.9 vs.
   4.7gm(2)h(-1); p>0.05), and higher N2O-N emissions (2967.3 vs.
   1179.8gm(-2)h(-1); p=0.02) than the ISS, respectively. For the urine
   patches, the ISS emitted only 47.9, 2.2 and 11.6\% of the CO2-C, CH4-C
   and N2O-N emissions observed in the PM, respectively. Moreover,
   comparing both systems with a forest, CH4-C and N2O-N emissions from the
   ISS were not different (p>0.05), but the PM presented higher emissions
   for the three gases (p<0.0001). The emissions reported in the present
   study differ from the emission factors suggested by the IPCC and other
   authors for manure and urine. PM presented higher N losses than the ISS
   from both manure (1.77 vs. 1.37\%) and urine (3.47 vs. 0.3\%) (p<0.05).
   The ISS might contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions from
   grasslands in contrast to traditional grazing systems, despite the high
   stocking rates and legume densities, producing emissions similar to
   those of a forest.},

   potential in rainfed conditions of Eastern Ghats region in India. Thirty
   experimental plots, each of 18 x 12 m dimension with 2 \% slope having
   different multitier agroforestry treatments were assessed for soil
   erosion, nutrient loss and crop yield. Results revealed that multitier
   plantation of drumstick (Moringa oleifera) with Gliricidia sepium
   hedgerow and ginger (Zingiber officinale): pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan)
   (8:2) intercropping enumerated minimum mean runoff (8.26 \%) and soil
   loss (3.45 Mg ha(-1)). This treatment saved 74 \% more soil organic
   carbon, 64 \% more phosphorus and 66 \% more potassium, respectively
   than broadcasted finger millet cultivation (traditional farmers'
   practice). An increase of 24-27 \% drumstick fruit yield was observed in
   Gliricidia hedgerow based multitier agroforestry systems over
   non-Gliricidia systems. The findings will contribute as a technical
   reference for the promotion of hedgerow based multitier agroforestry for

Abstract = {Weeds are a major constraint to crop production in smallholder farms in
   tropical Africa. The weed seedbank and annual recruitment are the main
   sources of weed infestation in crops. This study was carried out in
   Ibadan, Nigeria, to evaluate the effect on the seedbank of two types of
   planted fallow (alley cropping with leucaena and live mulch with
   tropical kudzu) and a natural bush fallow under four land-use
   intensities. Type of fallow was the main plot. Land-use intensities,
   consisting of continuous cropping of maize intercropped with cassava, 1
   cropping yr of maize-cassava followed by 1, 2, and 3 yr of fallow, were
   the subplots. Averaged over a 3-yr period, the seedbank was 55\% lower
   in the tropical kudzu plots and 43\% lower in the leucaena plots
   compared with natural bush. The difference in seedbanks between plots
   cultivated after leucaena and natural fallow was 23\%. Seed density of
   annual broadleaf weeds was high and dominated the seedbank of both
   planted and natural fallow. Overall, seeds of grasses occurred at low
   densities in all plots cultivated after 2 to 3 yr of fallow, whereas
   seeds of sedges occurred more in continuously cultivated plots and plots
   cultivated after 1 yr of fallow in all the fallow types. Seed density of
   perennial broadleaf weeds increased as land-use intensity decreased.
   Live mulch with tropical kudzu, especially when combined with 2 to 3 yr
   of fallow, lowered the seedbank more than the leucaena and traditional
   bush fallow systems.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the preparation of biochar from sludge generated in a
   wastepaper-based paper mill operating on the Zero liquid discharge
   principles. Biochar has been prepared from sludge, hereafter referred to
   as Zero liquid discharge sludge, in a laboratory muffle furnace using
   the slow pyrolysis method. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and
   pyrolysis time on biochar' yield, surface area, and pore volume of
   biochar has been studied by applying response surface methodology. The
   pyrolysis temperature and pyrolysis time were maintained in the range
   450-750 degrees C and 100-200 min. respectively, under the central
   composite design. It was found that temperature and time significantly
   impacted the biochar's yield, surface area, and pore volume of biochar
   showing strong linear, quadratic, and interaction effects. ANOVA of the
   empirical models developed in this study was found to be efficient with
   high R-predicted(2), (R-adjusted(2) - R-predicted(2)) < 0.2, adequate
   precision > 4, and non-significant lack of fit value. The optimum
   pyrolysis temperature and pyrolysis time were determined to be 539.65
   degrees C and 176.67 min correspondingly having desirability value
   0.651. The optimized values of biochar's yield, surface area, and pore
   volume for Zero liquid discharge sludge biochar were found to be
   63.95\%, 40.23 m(2)/g, and 0.048 cm(3)/g respectively. The
   physicochemical (proximate and CHNS) and instrumental (XRD, TGA, DSC,
   FT-IR, and SEM) analyses along with their comparison with other biochar
   reported in the literature confirmed the use of this biochar as an
   adsorbent in wastewater treatment.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, new loci involved in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis have
   been identified by transposon mutagenesis and/or complementation. Wide
   dispersal of the symbiotic loci in Rhizobium species NGR234, as well as
   the large number of potential host-plants to be screened, greatly
   reduces the efficiency of these techniques. As an alternate strategy
   designed to identify new NGR234 genes involved in the early stages of
   the symbiosis, we combined data from competitive RNA hybridisation,
   subtractive DNA hybridisation and shot-gun sequencing. On the assumption
   that the expression of mast nodulation genes is triggered by compounds
   released by the host-plant, we identified, in the ordered cosmid library
   of the large symbiotic plasmid pNGR234a, restriction fragments that
   carry transcripts induced by flavonoids. To target genes not present in
   the closely related strain R. fredii USDA257, we selected fragments that
   also carried sequences purified by subtractive DNA hybridisation.
   Shot-gun sequencing of this subset of fragments lead to the
   identification of sequences with strong homology to diverse prokaryotic
   genes/proteins. Amongst these, a symbiotically active ORF from pNGR234a,
   is highly homologous to the leucine responsive regulatory protein of
   Escherichia coli (Lrp), is induced by flavonoids, and is not present in
   USDA257.},

Abstract = {The objectives of the current study were to determine the effect of
   supplementing Acacia karroo leaf-meal on growth performance, blood
   chemistry and carcass characteristics of Nguni steers. Thirty 19-month
   old Nguni steers (241.5 +/- 14.62 kg) were randomly allotted to three
   dietary treatments: A. karroo leaf-meal (AK), sunflower cake (SF) and
   control with no supplement (CN). Steers on the AK and SF diets were
   offered additional 150 g of protein through A. karroo and sunflower cake
   per day for 60 days. Serum concentrations of nutritionally-related blood
   metabolites were measured every fortnight. Steers that were given
   supplementary diets had higher (P<0.05) total protein, urea,
   non-esterified fatty acids, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and iron
   concentrations, and larger eye muscle area than those that received the
   CN diet. Albumin concentration was higher (P<0.05) in steers that
   received supplementary diets than those that did not. Steers
   supplemented with the AK and SF diets had lower (P<0.05) glucose and
   cholesterol concentrations than those that received the CN diet. Steers
   fed an the SF diet had the highest average daily gain, body condition
   score, slaughter weight, warm carcass weight and cold carcass weight
   followed by those on the AK diet (P<0.05). Steers that were supplemented
   with AK and SF diets had similar (P>0.05) gross margins. It was
   concluded that A. karroo improves the nutritional status, growth
   performance, and carcass traits of Nguni steers reared on natural

Abstract = {Parkland systems in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa are commonly
   perceived as a resilient agroforestry practice well adapted to the
   semi-arid climatic conditions of the region. However, there exist
   several knowledge gaps regarding the interplay between the different
   components of this agro-silvopastoral land use system. A literature
   review with subsequent meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the
   effects of woody perennials on soil, crops and livestock, for which our
   study found very context-specific responses. A scoring of tree and shrub
   species indicated a general trend of trade-off between positive impact
   on crops and livestock vs. impact on soil organic carbon content. The
   study further confirmed that Faidherbia albida (Del.) Chev. is one of
   the most promising parkland species, but also revealed that there are no
   multipurpose single species that should be promoted exclusively. The
   focus should rather shift to species mixtures that satisfy multiple
   human and environmental needs. The study also pointed out that
   information on the nutritional properties of the majority of browse
   species is particularly limited. Transdisciplinary modelling is
   suggested as a tool to assess the complex interactions between the
   different components that shape this agro-silvopastoral system at
   different scales.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to assess the effects feeding level on
   body weight changes and semen parameters in adult Sardinian rams reared
   under intensive conditions in a semi-arid area of southern Italy. During
   an experimental period of 90 days, 24 healthy Sardinian rams were
   divided into three equal groups that differed in their feeding level, in
   terms of concentrate amount. The control-concentrate (CC; n=8) group
   received 1.0 times their maintenance requirements, the
   medium-concentrate (MC; n=8) group received a diet that supplied 1.2
   times their maintenance requirements, and high-concentrate (HC, n=8)
   group received a diet that supplied 1.5 times their maintenance
   requirements. Mixed vetch-oat hay was offered ad libitum to ram groups
   and water and mineral licks were freely available. Body weight and feed
   intake was recorded weekly, and semen characteristics were determined
   every 2 weeks. Dietary treatment affected final body weight (P<0.01) as
   feeding level increased. Total dry matter and protein intake changed
   significantly (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively) among experimental
   groups. Semen volume and concentration were positively influenced by
   feeding level for HC group, whereas no differences were observed in
   sperm viability and scrotal circumference of rams. It was concluded that
   dietary level with higher concentrate supplementation resulted in
   im-proved body weight gain, feed intake, sperm production, and semen
   quality in Sardinian rams.},

Abstract = {The experiment was conducted at Debre Zeit Research Station of the
   International Livestock Research Institute in Ethiopia for 126 days.
   Fifty-four male Menz sheep with initial live weight (LW) of 15.7 +/-
   0.32 kg (mean +/- S.D.) were blocked on initial LW and randomly assigned
   to one of the nine treatments, giving six animals per treatment. The
   basal feed used in the experiment was tef (Eragrostis tef) straw. The
   supplement treatments consisted of wheat bran (positive control) or
   dried foliage of the multipurpose trees (MPT), Sesbania sesban 1198, S.
   sesban 15019, Acacia angustissinia 15132, and Leucaena pallida 14203, or
   the mixtures of S. sesban 1198 and S. sesban 15019 with either L.
   pallida 14203 or A. angustissima 15132 at a ratio of 2:1. The level of
   supplementation was at 0.9\% of LW on dry matter (DM) basis. The
   objectives of the experiment were to evaluate the effects of
   supplementation on feed intake, plasma activities of certain enzymes,
   daily LW and scrotal circumference gains. The crude protein (CP) content
   in the MPT leaves and their mixtures ranged between 21.6\% and 27.8\% of
   DM. Supplementation with mixtures of MPTs promoted higher organic matter
   (OM) (P < 0.01), supplement and total DM (P < 0.001) intakes and higher
   feed conversion efficiency (FCE) (P<0.001) than sole MPTs. Mixtures of
   MPTs also promoted higher (P<0.05) daily LW and scrota] circumference
   gains than wheat bran or sole MPTs. Plasma activities of alanine
   aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), and
   aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were not different (P>0.05) between
   treatments at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. It is
   concluded that supplementation with mixtures of MPTs promoted better
   utilization of nutrients and animal performance compared to sole MPTs or
   wheat bran in sheep fed on a basal diet of tef straw. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {Two experiments designated A and B were conducted to evaluate the effect
   of supplementing napier grass with lucerne on dry matter intake (DMI)
   and weight gain (ADG) of Friesian and Sahiwal heifers. In experiment A
   which lasted 92 days, 24 heifers from each of Sahiwal and Friesian
   breeds were blocked by breed and randomly allocated to the following
   treatments: young napier + 0 kg lucerne (T1); young napier + 1.5 kg
   lucerne (T2); old napier + 0 kg lucerne (T3); old napier + 1.5 kg
   lucerne (T4); old napier + 2.5 kg lucerne (T5); old napier + 3.5 kg
   lucerne (T6) heifer(-1).day(-1). Supplementation significantly (p <
   0.05) increased DMI from 4.3 to 6.7 kg.day(-1) in Sahiwals and 5.2 to
   7.8 kg.day(-1) in Friesians (p < 0.05). Similarly, supplementation
   positively influenced ADG which significantly (p < 0.05) improved from
   0.29 to 0.64 kg.day(-1) for Sahiwals and 0.30 to 0.65 kg.day(-1) for
   Friesians. In Experiment B, diets from experiment A were incubated in
   the rumen for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 and 336 h using four steers to
   estimate degradation. The rumen degradation of lucerne-containing diets
   were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those with napier grass alone.
   It was concluded from the study that lucerne has a great potential to
   improve animal performance in smallholder dairy farms.},

Title = {Feeding value of wild Napier grass (Pennisetum macrourum) for
   cattle supplemented with protein and/or energy rich supplements},
Journal = {ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2003},

Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the feeding value of
   Pennisetum macrourum, commonly known as wild Napier grass, as a feed for
   cattle. Experiment 1 was a nutritive value determination using four
   crossbred steers and four diets in a 4 x 4 Latin square design
   experiment. The four diets were: wild Napier grass + mineral/vitamin
   mixture (WN), wild Napier grass + 0.5 kg fishmeal + 0.5 kg maize bran +
   mineral/vitamin mixture (MB + FM), wild Napier grass + 0.5 kg molasses +
   mineral/vitamin mixture (MO) and wild Napier grass + 0.5 kg fishmeal +
   0.5 kg molasses + mineral/vitamin mixture (MO + FM). Wild Napier grass
   contained 668, 256 and 78 g/kg DM of NDF, ADF and CP, respectively. The
   DM intake (67.9, 118.9, 96, 132.9 g/kg for animals on WN, MB + FM, MO
   and MO + FM, respectively) differed (P < 0.05) among diets.
   Metabolizable energy (ME) intake increased (P < 0.05) from 17.6 to 32.7
   (MJ per day) for steers on diets WN and MO + FM, respectively and N
   retention was increased (P < 0.05) from 7.6 to 51.5 g per day in diets
   WN and MO + FM, respectively. N absorbed was more efficiently retained
   (P < 0.05) with MO + FM supplements. Experiment 2, used 16 milking cows
   fed on similar diets to Experiment 1 in a completely randomized
   experiment. DM intake differed (P < 0.05) among diets, except between BM
   + FM and MO and ranged from 6.3 to 8.7 kg in diets WN and MO + FM,
   respectively. All cows lost weight, with those on MO diet losing (P <
   0.05) the most weight. Milk yield differed (P < 0.05) among diets
   ranging from 7.8 to 15.5 kg per cow per day for cows on WN and MO + FM,
   respectively. Although steers and cows performed better when
   supplemented with FM, its high cost suggests that feeding of molasses as
   an inexpensive source of fermentable carbohydrates in the rumen may be
   recommended as it results in adequate performance. (c) 2003 Published by

Abstract = {Genotypic variability of the symbiotic nitrogen fixation ability on
   Acacia cyanophylla Lindl. The phenotypic and functional characteristics
   of four rhizobium strains isolated from nodules of Acacia cyanophylla
   Lindl., syn. Acacia saligna (Labill.) H. Wendl., and the inoculated
   host-plant genetic variability were evaluated. The evaluation used
   permitted the ranking of the tested rhizobium strains and seedlots
   according to their performance. The growth pattern of these strains
   indicated that A. cyanophylla was al,le to nodulate and fix N-2 With
   slow- and fast-growing rhizobium strains. The acetylene reduction
   activity test reflected a variable effectiveness of the strains
   depending on their site of isolation. Strains RFH383 and RFH483 were
   more effective than RFH183 and RFH283. The high antibiotic resistance
   acquisition by RFH183 and RFH283 strains seemed to be inversely related
   to their effectiveness. Acacia cyanophylla seedlings from five seedlots
   displayed a high variability regarding their growth, nodulation, and
   ability to fix nitrogen. The ability to fix nitrogen was greater in the
   seedlings from KL seedlot than those from EN, KR, and TZ seedlots. The
   qualitative assessment of the seedlots using correspondence factorial
   analysis showed that the seedlings from KL seedlot preformed better than
   those from KR and TZ. The seedlings from TN and EN seedlots displayed an
   intermediate behaviour pattern. Seed origin seemed to affect the growth,
   nodulation, and nitrogen fixation of inoculated A. cyanophylla. The
   behaviour of this species and that of its associated rhizobium strains
   appeared to be very sensitive to variations in site characteristics.
   Results suggested that the association between plants derived from KL
   seedlot and RFH383 strain may represent the best partnership allowing
   the improvement of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.},

   of banana-based systems in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo},
Journal = {LEGUME SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Intercropping banana and shorter annual crops in small holder systems is
   inevitable despite shade being a limitation. Current production is also
   limited to the wet seasons. Strategies to exploit the spaces under
   banana shade and drier seasons are crucial for optimal production of
   these systems. We determined the performance of two legume cover crops,
   Mucuna pruriens and Crotalaria juncea, and chickpea (Cicer arietinum), a
   grain legume, under different banana shade levels and over the wet and
   dry seasons in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Banana and legume
   monocrops served as controls. Shade reduced weed biomass and legume root
   nodulation, biomass, and grain yields. Chickpea root nodulation had a
   lower sensitivity to shade (3-9\% reduction) compared with mucuna
   (30-60\%) and crotalaria (31-71\%). Legume biomass yield declines varied
   from 37-83\%, 56-93\%, and 80-98\% for mucuna, crotalaria, and chickpea,
   respectively. Higher nodulation occurred in the rainy compared with the
   dry season. Biomass yield declines, albeit low occurred in the dry
   season for mucuna (15\%) and crotalaria (30\%). In contrast, chickpea
   biomass and grain yields increased by 394\% and 4487\%, respectively, in
   the dry season. A higher banana vegetative growth occurred in the
   intercropped plots. Land equivalent ratios of 1.15-1.34 under dense
   shading for mucuna and crotalaria and 1.10-1.62 for chickpea occurred
   irrespective of the seasons. These findings suggest that these cover
   crops and chickpea could be exploited to enhance biomass (for fodder,
   mulch, or manure) and grain yields under banana shade and over the drier
   seasons.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Agroforestry systems may alleviate challenges relating to soil
   degradation and low livestock production for smallholder farmers.
   Species-adjusted management regimes will determine how agroforestry fits
   in farming systems. Long-term productivity of biomass in agroforestry
   systems managed for fodder production requires tree species that coppice
   after repeated cutting. This study evaluated the effect of different
   cutting heights (0.3 and 1.0 m) and repeated harvests (1-5) on biomass
   production and chemical composition of the leguminous trees Acacia
   angustissima, Leucaena pallida and Mimosa scabrella in a field study on
   an Anthropic Ferralsol in Southern Rwanda. Shoot biomass production was
   highest at 0.3 m cutting height for A. angustissima and L. pallida, but
   M. scabrella could not survive that cutting height. Shoot biomass was
   highest for A. angustissima and lowest for M. scabrella, which did not
   adapt to repeated harvests. Leaf:stem ratio was not affected by cutting
   height. Cutting height did not affect crude protein (CP), but neutral
   detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and total polyphenol
   (TP) concentrations were higher at 1.0 m cutting height than at 0.3 m.
   Crude protein was highest in A. angustissima and lowest in M. scabrella,
   while NDF and ADF were highest in M. scabrella. Although all species
   provided high feed quality in terms of high CP content at both cutting
   heights, low cutting height (0.3 m) is recommended for A. angustissima
   and L. pallida for higher overall quality and biomass production.},

   Ethiopian sheep},

Abstract = {This study compared the effect of supplementing maize stover (MS) with
   cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) haulms or commercial concentrate (CC) on feed
   intake, nutrient digestibility, live weight gain and carcass yield of
   male Ethiopian Highland sheep. Two cowpea genotypes, 12688 (forage) and
   IT96D-774 (dual-purpose), were used. A randomised block design was
   applied with groups of eight sheep, blocked by weight, allocated to one
   of six treatments; MS ad libitum either unsupplemented or supplemented
   daily with 150 or 300g dry matter (DM) of either cowpea or CC. MS
   contained more neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF)
   and lignin than either cowpeas or CC Crude protein (CP) content of the
   forage-type cowpeas was higher than either dual-purpose or CC, while MS
   had the lowest CP content Relative to the negative control group, cowpea
   at either level significantly (P < 0.01) increased both MS intake and
   total NDF and lignin. Supplementation significantly (P < 0.01) increased
   nitrogen (N) intakes relative to the negative control, with N intake for
   CC and dual-purpose cowpea (high level) being similar to the intakes for
   cowpeas at 150g. N intake with the forage-type cowpea offered at higher
   levels was significantly (P < 0.01) greater than the other groups. No
   significant differences (P > 0.01) in MS intake were identified between
   cowpeas at either level or CC and, although intake level of CC
   increased, it did not differ significantly from the negative control
   group. Supplementation significantly (P < 0.01) improved average daily
   gain, with the negative control group losing weight over the
   experimental period, and increased final live weight, carcass cold
   weight and dressing percentage. Supplementation significantly improved
   the apparent digestibility of DM, organic matter and NDF, with no
   significant difference found between cowpeas at either level. N
   retention was negative for sheep offered only MS, but positive with all
   supplements, with cowpeas improving N retention to a greater extent than
   CC. Interestingly, N retention/N intake was higher with cowpeas offered
   at the lower level suggesting an improvement in utilisation efficiency.
   The results indicate that the supplementation of MS with cowpea enhanced
   ruminant production through improvements in digestibility and intake.
   Further, as production improvements associated with the two levels of
   supplementation did not differ significantly, it is suggested that where
   limited quantities of cowpea are available, it may be of greater
   nutritional benefit to offer smaller quantities over an increased number
   of animal days.},

Abstract = {In vitro propagation was initiated from 2-week-old and 7-month-old
   explants of Acacia mangium. Juvenile explants (2 week-old) of 5- to
   10-mm lengths composed of two leaves were cultured on Murashige and
   Skoog (MS) medium containing 1.0 or 2.0 mg L-1 6-benzyladenine (BAP).
   After 6 weeks, most explants had formed a large cluster of 14-18
   axillary shoots produced by prolific branching of the primary axillary
   shoot after elongation. The maximum multiplication rate (40) was
   obtained in the first subculture; the rate decreased to 10-20 in the
   second one. The mean length of shoots was not significantly affected by
   BAP concentrations during the subsequent cultures. Rooting ability of
   juvenile explants was greatly affected by BAP concentrations used in the
   multiplication medium. When both types of explants were multiplied on a
   MS medium containing 1.0 mg L-1 BAP and transferred to a half-strength
   MS medium containing 0.05 mg L-1 IBA, only 10\% of the juvenile explants
   were rooted versus 70\% of the 7-month-old explants. Rooted plants
   transferred onto artificial substrate were all nodulated, when
   inoculated with a specific Bradyrhizobium sp. strain.},

Title = {Predicting ecosystem changes by a new model of ecosystem evolution},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {In recent years, computer simulation has been increasingly used to
   predict changes in actual ecosystems. In these studies, snapshots of
   ecosystems at certain points in time were instantly constructed without
   considering their evolutionary histories. However, it may not be
   possible to correctly predict future events unless their evolutionary
   processes are considered. In this study, we developed a new ecosystem
   model for reproducing the evolutionary process on an oceanic island,
   targeting Nakoudojima Island of the Ogasawara Islands. This model
   successfully reproduced the primitive ecosystem (the entire island
   covered with forest) prior to the invasion of alien species. Also, by
   adding multiple alien species to this ecosystem, we were able to
   reproduce temporal changes in the ecosystem of Nakoudojima Island after
   invasion of alien species. Then, we performed simulations in which feral
   goats were eradicated, as had actually been done on the island; these
   suggested that after the eradication of feral goats, forests were
   unlikely to be restored. In the ecosystems in which forests were not
   restored, arboreous plants with a high growth rate colonized during the
   early stage of evolution. As arboreous plants with a high growth rate
   consume a large amount of nutrient in soil, creating an oligotrophic
   state. As a result, plants cannot grow, and animal species that rely on
   plants cannot maintain their biomass. Consequently, many animals and
   plants become extinct as they cannot endure disturbances by alien
   species, and the ecosystem loses its resilience. Therefore, even if
   feral goats are eradicated, forests are not restored. Thus, the founder
   effect from the distant past influences future ecosystem changes. Our
   findings show that it is useful to consider the evolutionary process of
   an ecosystem in predicting its future events.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {Silvopastoral systems are a prototype of agroforestry with a livestock
   component, which may be characterized as cleaner production as they
   provide a variety of goods and services to society; one of their
   functions is to help adapt to and mitigate climate change. In this
   article, traditional silvopastoral systems with cattle are
   characterized, and 35 pastures with silvopastoral management in
   communities of the Lower Grijalva hydrographic region of Chiapas and
   Tabasco in Southeastern Mexico are evaluated. This article discusses the
   general context as well as technical and economic aspects of the cattle
   raising units (CRU). The high frequency (71\%) of land use conversion
   from maize fields to pastures demonstrates that a significant process of
   increased establishment of cattle raising is under way. Pastures have an
   average age of 17.9 years, soils are of medium to high quality, and the
   dominant herbaceous species are grasses. Scattered trees (ST) in
   pastures are remnants of the original vegetation which has largely
   disappeared due to change in land use, with 53 species belonging to 24
   botanical families and an average density of 12.3 trees ha(-1). In
   living fences (LF), 32 tree species belonging to 18 botanical families
   were found, with an average density of 45.8 trees per 100 linear m. It
   is estimated that on average, one hectare of pasture with a dominance of
   Cynodon plectostachyus grass (13.10 Mg C ha(-1)) surrounded by a living
   fence (7.28 Mg C ha(-1)) and containing scattered trees (3.00 Mg C
   ha(-1)) has a total accumulation of 23.38 Mg C ha(-1). Finally,
   provision of several environmental services, levels of production or
   yields, and animal products of the CRU with treeless pastures and with
   two types of silvopastoral systems are analyzed. In order to be
   considered a form of sustainable development, traditional silvopastoral
   systems must gradually be transformed into intensive silvopastoral
   systems. This requires the commitment and co-responsibility of all
   social actors involved in order to plan community-based, municipal,
   state-wide, and national policy related to agroforestry with an animal
   component. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Although many studies have been conducted on seeds with a
   water-impermeable seed or fruit coat (physical dormancy), the primary
   site of water entry into these seeds after dormancy-breaking treatments
   is still controversial. Thus, the role of lens, hilum, micropyle and
   extrahilar regions in water uptake of seeds treated to break physical
   dormancy was examined in Vigna oblongifolia and Sesbania sesban
   (Fabaceae) following pretreatment with sulphuric acid and hot water.
   Morphology of seed surfaces in treated versus non-treated seeds of both
   species was examined with scanning electron microscopy. Most seeds of V
   oblongifolia first cracked in the hilum when pretreated with sulphuric
   acid, but they cracked in both the hilum and extrahilar regions when
   pretreated with hot water. However, in S. sesban seeds, a crack formed
   only in the lens following either acid scarification or hot-water
   treatments, and the seeds imbibed water only through the lens. These
   results indicate that the primary site of water entry into seeds
   following physical dormancy break can vary with species and treatments.
   Slow, early imbibition via the hilum, and subsequent rapid imbibition
   via the lens, may not be detected unless seeds are monitored for several
   days. Time allowed for imbibition studies may, at least in part, explain
   various interpretations about the role of the lens in physical dormancy
   reported in the literature.},
